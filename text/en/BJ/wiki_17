<text>The Lockheed T-33 Shooting Star (or T-Bird) is an American subsonic jet trainer. It was produced by Lockheed and made its first flight in 1948. The T-33 was developed from the Lockheed P-80/F-80 starting as TP-80C/TF-80C in development, then designated T-33A. It was used by the U.S. Navy initially as TO-2, then TV-2, and after 1962, T-33B. The last operator of the T-33, the Bolivian Air Force, retired the type in July 2017, after 44 years of service.

==Design and development==

The T-33 was developed from the Lockheed P-80/F-80 by lengthening the fuselage by slightly more than 3 feet (1 m) and adding a second seat, instrumentation, and flight controls. It was initially designated as a variant of the P-80/F-80, the TP-80C/TF-80C.

Design work on the Lockheed P-80 began in 1943, with the first flight on 8 January 1944. Following on the Bell P-59, the P-80 became the first jet fighter to enter full squadron service in the United States Army Air Forces. As more advanced jets entered service, the F-80 took on another role—training jet pilots. The two-place T-33 jet was designed for training pilots already qualified to fly propeller-driven aircraft.

Originally designated the TF-80C, the T-33 made its first flight on 22 March 1948 with Lockheed test pilot Tony LeVier at the controls. Production at Lockheed ran from 1948 to 1959. The US Navy used the T-33 as a land-based trainer starting in 1949. It was designated the TV-2, but was redesignated the T-33B in 1962. The Navy operated some ex-USAF P-80Cs as the TO-1, changed to the TV-1 about a year later. A carrier-capable version of the P-80/T-33 family was subsequently developed by Lockheed, eventually leading to the late 1950s to 1970s T2V-1/T-1A SeaStar. The two TF-80C prototypes were modified as prototypes for an all-weather two-seater fighter variant, which became the F-94 Starfire. A total of 6,557 T-33s were produced: 5,691 of them by Lockheed, 210 by Kawasaki, and 656 by Canadair.

==Operational history==

===U.S. Air Force and U.S. Navy===
The two-place T-33 proved suitable as an advanced trainer, and it has been used for such tasks as drone director and target towing. A reconnaissance version known as the RT-33A with a camera installed in the nose and additional equipment in the rear cockpit was also produced. Although primarily intended for export, the U.S. Air Force used a single example of the type for secret overflights of South Vietnam and Laos from 1961, with these flights codenamed FIELD GOAL. This lasted until the aircraft were replaced by the more capable McDonnell RF-101 Voodoo in this role.

The USAF began phasing the T-33 out of front-line pilot training duties in the Air Training Command in the early 1960s, as the Cessna T-37 Tweet and Northrop T-38 Talon aircraft began replacing it for the Undergraduate Pilot Training (UPT) program. The T-33 was used to train cadets from the Air Force Academy at Peterson Field (now Peterson Air Force Base in Colorado Springs). The T-37 replaced the T-33 for Academy training in 1975. The final T-33 used in advanced training was replaced 8 February 1967 at Craig AFB, Alabama. Similar replacement also occurred in the U.S. Navy with the TV-1 (also renamed T-33 in 1962), as more advanced aircraft such as the North American T-2 Buckeye and Douglas TA-4 Skyhawk II came on line. USAF and USN versions of the T-33 soldiered on into the 1970s and 1980s with USAF and USN as utility aircraft and proficiency trainers, with some of the former USN aircraft being expended as full-scale aerial targets for air-to-air missile tests from naval aircraft and surface-to-air missile tests from naval vessels.

Several T-33s were assigned to USAF McDonnell F-101 Voodoo, Convair F-102 Delta Dagger, and Convair F-106 Delta Dart units, to include similarly equipped Air National Guard units, of the Aerospace Defense Command as proficiency trainers and practice &quot;bogey&quot; aircraft. Others later went to Tactical Air Command, and TAC gained Air National Guard F-106 and McDonnell-Douglas F-4 Phantom II units in a similar role until they were finally retired, with the last being an NT-33 variant retired in April 1997.

===Military use by other nations===
The T-33 has served with over 30 nations and continues to operate as a trainer in smaller air forces. Canadair built 656 T-33s on licence for service in the RCAF—Canadian Forces as the CT-133 Silver Star, while Kawasaki manufactured 210 in Japan. Other operators included Brazil, Turkey, and Thailand, which used the T-33 extensively.
Some T-33s retained two machine guns for gunnery training, and in some countries, the T-33 was even used in combat: the Cuban Air Force used them during the Bay of Pigs Invasion, scoring several kills including sinking two transport ships.

The RT-33A version, reconnaissance aircraft produced primarily for use by foreign countries, had a camera installed in the nose and additional equipment in the rear cockpit. T-33s continued to fly as currency trainers, drone towing, combat and tactical simulation training, &quot;hack&quot; aircraft, electronic countermeasures, and warfare training and test platforms right into the 1980s.

In the 1980s, an attempt was made to modify and modernize the T-33 as the Boeing Skyfox, but a lack of orders led to the project&#x27;s cancellation. About 70% of the T-33&#x27;s airframe was retained in the Skyfox, but it was powered by two Garrett AiResearch TFE731-3A turbofan engines.

In the late 1990s, 18 T-33 Mk-III and T-33 SF-SC from the Bolivian Air Force went to Canada to be modernized at Kelowna Flightcraft. New avionics were installed, and detailed inspection and renewal of the fuselage and wings were performed. Most of the aircraft returned in early 2001 and remained operational until the type was officially retired on 31 July 2017.

On 21 June 1996, 1 T-33A-5-LO (trainer TR-602) from the Hellenic Air Force piloted by Squadron Leader Ioannis Kouratzoglou successfully intercepted a Turkish F-16C violating Athens FIR by engaging in low-altitude high-G maneuvers.

===Civilian use===
A limited number of T-33s have been owned privately, with two used by Boeing as chase aircraft. In 2010, one T-33 owned by Boeing was used as a chase aircraft during the maiden flight of the Boeing 787. The maiden flight of the Boeing 737 MAX-7 on 16 March 2018 also featured a T-33 chase plane. The maiden flight of the Boeing 777-9 on January 25, 2020, also featured a T-33 chase plane, taking off from KBFI and meeting the 777-9 at KPAE, it stopped at KMWH and it took off again to chase the 777-9 on its way back to KBFI, flying around Mount Rainier before their landing. On December 4, 2020, Boeing retired their T-33 Chase Planes after 66 years of service. Both T-33s operated by Boeing were replaced by a single T-38 Talon. Actor and pilot Michael Dorn owned a T-33, which he jokingly referred to as his &quot;starship&quot;.

==Aircraft on display==

Numerous T-33s have been preserved as museum and commemorative displays.

==Notable accidents and incidents==
On January 28, 1951:
WW2 Ace Dominic Salvatore Gentile was killed when he crashed in a T-33A-1-LO Shooting Star trainer, AF Ser. No. 49-0905, in Forestville, Maryland. Gentile was credited with 20 air kills during his combat tours.

;4 August 1955: First Lt. Elmer C. Bybee (of Walden CO) and Second Lt. Conrad J. Zubalik (of Greensburg PA), US Air Force, were flying a T-33 on a training sortie out of Perrin Air Force Base (Sherman TX) when a wing snapped off during a turn. The aircraft crashed near Grapevine Lake Dam north of the Dallas-Ft Worth Airport. Both pilot trainees perished in the crash.

;4 June 1957: Maj. Teruhiko Kobayashi, a flying ace of the Imperial Japanese Air Force, was flying a T-33 on a training sortie from Hamamatsu when a technical problem occurred just shortly after takeoff. He ordered his companion in the jet with him to eject. After his companion did, he tried to take control of the aircraft and attempted to land it away from any populated areas, but crashed shortly after.

;23 December 1957: 1 US T-33 flown by Maj Howard J.Curran entered Albanian airspace, alleging that he had interference requiring him to fly in Albanian airspace. He was forced to land on Rinas Airport by 2 Albanian MiG-15 flown by Anastas Ngjela and Mahmut Hysa. Major Howard J.Curran was later released but his T-33 was placed in the Gjirokastra castle museum, where it is still today.

;24 March 1958: Lt Col. Jacob E. Manch, a member of the Doolittle Raiders during World War 2, was killed in a T-33 jet trainer accident outside of Las Vegas, NV. He ordered the second crewmember to bail out and guided his powerless aircraft over a neighborhood, that included an elementary school, avoiding potential casualties on the ground. When he finally ejected, his parachute did not have sufficient time to properly operate, and he died when he hit the ground.

;20 May 1958: An Air National Guard Lockheed T-33A was involved in a mid-air collision with Capital Airlines Flight 300, a Vickers Viscount, over Brunswick, Maryland.

;19 September 1968: A Chilean Air Force T-33A crewed by Sub-lieutenant Jorge Emberg and Second Lieutenant René Catalán crashed shortly after takeoff from El Bosque Air Base due to an engine failure. Emberg managed to eject safely but Catalán and six people on the ground died when the aircraft crashed on the Santa Erna neighborhood.

;20 August 1971: On 20 August 1971, Pilot Officer Rashid Minhas was scheduled to fly a Lockheed T-33 jet trainer from PAF Base Masroor in Karachi. Bir Sreshtho Matiur Rahman, an instructor pilot, saw Minhas about to take off and joined him via the instructor&#x27;s seat. Rahman then attempted to hijack the T-33 in midair, intending to fly the plane to India, defect, and join the Bangladesh Liberation War and fight for his motherland. Minhas sent a message to control tower that he has been hijacked before being knocked unconscious. The now alerted Pakistani Air Force scrambled F-86 Sabre jets but were unable to locate the T-33. In the meantime, Rashid regained consciousness and there was a struggle between the two pilots and the plane crashed in Pakistan, 40 kilometers from the Indian border, killing both pilots; the precise cause of the crash is unknown.

<doc id="359129" wikidata="Q794392" url="?curid=359129" title="Azusa Street Revival">
<text>The Azusa Street Revival was a historic series of revival meetings that took place in Los Angeles, California. It was led by William J. Seymour, an African-American preacher. The revival began on April 9, 1906, and continued until roughly 1915. 

Seymour was invited to Los Angeles for a one-month engagement at a local church, but found himself barred due to his controversial views on baptism with the Holy Spirit after his first Sunday. He continued his ministry in the homes of sympathetic parishioners, and on the night of April 9, 1906, first one, then six others in his meeting began to speak in tongues and shout out loud praising God, so loudly that the neighborhood was alerted. The news quickly spread; the city was stirred; crowds gathered; services were moved outside to accommodate the crowds who came from all around; people fell down as they approached, and attributed it to God; people were baptized in the Holy Spirit and the sick were said to be healed. 

The testimony of those who attended the Azusa Street Revival was &quot;I am saved, sanctified, and filled with the Holy Ghost&quot; in reference to the three works of grace of Holiness Pentecostals, the original branch of Pentecostalism. To further accommodate the crowds, an old dilapidated, two-story frame building at 312 Azusa Street in the industrial section of the city was secured. This building, originally built for an African Methodist Episcopal (AME) church, had more recently been used as a livery stable, storage building and tenement house. In this humble Azusa Street mission, a continuous three-year revival occurred and became known around the world. Stanley H. Frodsham, in his book, &quot;With Signs Following&quot;, quotes an eye-witness description of the scene: The revival was characterized by spiritual experiences accompanied with testimonies of physical healing miracles, worship services, and speaking in tongues. The participants were criticized by some secular media and Christian theologians for behaviors considered to be outrageous and unorthodox, especially at the time.

Today, the revival is considered by historians to be the primary catalyst for the spread of Pentecostalism in the 20th century.

==Background==

===Los Angeles===

In 1905, William J. Seymour, a 34-year-old son of freed slaves, was a student of well-known Pentecostal preacher Charles Parham and an interim pastor for a small holiness church in Topeka, Kansas. Seymour inherited from Parham the belief that baptism with the Holy Spirit was the third work of grace, following the new birth (first work of grace) and entire sanctification (second work of grace). Neely Terry, an African American woman who attended a small holiness church pastored by Julia Hutchins in Los Angeles, made a trip to visit family in Houston late in 1905. While in Houston, she visited Seymour&#x27;s church, where he preached on receiving the Holy Spirit with the evidence of speaking in other tongues, and though he had not experienced this personally, Terry was impressed with his character and message. Once home in California, Terry suggested that Seymour be invited to speak at the local church. Seymour received and accepted the invitation in February 1906, and he received financial help and a blessing from Parham for his planned one-month visit.

Seymour arrived in Los Angeles on February 22, 1906, and within two days was preaching at Julia Hutchins&#x27; church at the corner of Ninth Street and Santa Fe Avenue. During his first sermon, he preached that speaking in tongues was the first biblical evidence of the inevitable infilling in the Holy Spirit. On the following Sunday, March 4, he returned to the church and found that Hutchins had padlocked the door. Elders of the church rejected Seymour&#x27;s teaching, primarily because he had not yet experienced the blessing about which he was preaching. Condemnation of his message also came from the Holiness Church Association of Southern California with which the church had affiliation. However, not all members of Hutchins&#x27; church rejected Seymour&#x27;s preaching. He was invited to stay in the home of congregation member Edward S. Lee, and he began to hold Bible studies and prayer meetings there.

===North Bonnie Brae Street===
Seymour and his small group of new followers soon relocated to the home of Richard and Ruth Asberry at 216 North Bonnie Brae Street. White families from local holiness churches began to attend as well. The group would get together regularly and pray to receive the baptism of the Holy Spirit. On April 9, 1906, after five weeks of Seymour&#x27;s preaching and prayer, and three days into an intended 10-day fast, Edward S. Lee spoke in tongues for the first time. At the next meeting, Seymour shared Lee&#x27;s testimony and preached a sermon on Acts 2:4 and soon six others began to speak in tongues as well, including Jennie Moore, who would later become Seymour&#x27;s wife. A few days later, on April 12, Seymour spoke in tongues for the first time after praying all night long.

News of the events at North Bonnie Brae St. quickly circulated among the African American, Latino and white residents of the city, and for several nights, various speakers would preach to the crowds of curious and interested onlookers from the front porch of the Asberry home. Members of the audience included people from a broad spectrum of income levels and religious backgrounds. Hutchins eventually spoke in tongues as her whole congregation began to attend the meetings. Soon the crowds became very large and were full of people speaking in tongues, shouting, singing and moaning. Finally, the front porch collapsed, forcing the group to begin looking for a new meeting place. A resident of the neighborhood described the happenings at 216 North Bonnie Brae with the following words:

==Azusa Street==

===Conditions===

The group from Bonnie Brae Street eventually discovered an available building at 312 Azusa Street () in downtown Los Angeles, which had originally been constructed as an African Methodist Episcopal Church in what was then an impoverished part of town. The rent was $8.00 per month. A newspaper referred to the downtown Los Angeles building as a &quot;tumble down shack&quot;. Since the church had moved out, the building had served as a wholesale house, a warehouse, a lumberyard, stockyards, a tombstone shop, and had most recently been used as a stable with rooms for rent upstairs. It was a small, rectangular, flat-roofed building, approximately long and wide, totaling , sided with weathered whitewashed clapboards. The only sign that it had once been a house of God was a single Gothic-style window over the main entrance.

Discarded lumber and plaster littered the large, barn-like room on the ground floor. Nonetheless, it was secured and cleaned in preparation for services. They held their first meeting on April 14, 1906. Church services were held on the first floor where the benches were placed in a rectangular pattern. Some of the benches were simply planks put on top of empty nail kegs. There was no elevated platform, as the ceiling was only eight feet high. Initially there was no pulpit. Frank Bartleman, an early participant in the revival, recalled that &quot;Brother Seymour generally sat behind two empty shoe boxes, one on top of the other. He usually kept his head inside the top one during the meeting, in prayer. There was no pride there... In that old building, with its low rafters and bare floors...&quot;

The second floor at the now-named Apostolic Faith Mission housed an office and rooms for several residents including Seymour and his new wife, Jennie. It also had a large prayer room to handle the overflow from the altar services below. The prayer room was furnished with chairs and benches made from California Redwood planks, laid end to end on backless chairs.

By mid-May 1906, anywhere from 300 to 1,500 people would attempt to fit into the building. Since horses had very recently been the residents of the building, flies constantly bothered the attendees. People from a diversity of backgrounds came together to worship: men, women, children, Black, White, Asian, Native American, immigrants, rich, poor, illiterate, and educated. People of all ages flocked to Los Angeles with both skepticism and a desire to participate. The intermingling of races and the group&#x27;s encouragement of women in leadership was remarkable, as 1906 was the height of the &quot;Jim Crow&quot; era of racial segregation, and fourteen years prior to women receiving suffrage in the United States.

===Services and worship===
Worship at 312 Azusa Street was frequent and spontaneous with services going almost around the clock. Among those attracted to the revival were not only members of the Holiness Movement, but also Baptists, Mennonites, Quakers, and Presbyterians. An observer at one of the services wrote these words:

The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; was not so kind in its description:

The first edition of the &quot;Apostolic Faith&quot; publication claimed a common reaction to the revival from visitors:

Among first-hand accounts were reports of the blind having their sight restored, diseases cured instantly, and immigrants speaking in German, Yiddish, and Spanish all being spoken to in their native language by uneducated black members, who translated the languages into English by &quot;supernatural ability&quot;.

Singing was sporadic and in &quot;a cappella&quot; or occasionally there would be singing in tongues. There were periods of extended silence. Attenders were occasionally slain in the Spirit. Visitors gave their testimony, and members read aloud testimonies that were sent to the mission by mail. There was prayer for the gift of tongues. There was prayer in tongues for the sick, for missionaries, and whatever requests were given by attenders or mailed in. There was spontaneous preaching and altar calls for salvation, sanctification and baptism of the Holy Spirit. Lawrence Catley, whose family attended the revival, said that in most services preaching consisted of Seymour opening a Bible and worshippers coming forward to preach or testify as they were led by the Holy Spirit. Many people would continually shout throughout the meetings. The members of the mission never took an offering, but there was a receptacle near the door for anyone who wanted to support the revival. The core membership of the Azusa Street Mission was never many more than 50–60 individuals, with hundreds if not thousands of people visiting or staying temporarily over the years.

===Charles Parham===

By October 1906, Charles Parham was invited to speak for a series of meetings at Azusa Street but was quickly un-invited. 

Arriving at Azusa Street, [Parham] recoiled in disgust at the racial intermingling. He was aghast that black people were not in their &quot;place,&quot; and simply could not abide &quot;white people imitating unintelligent, crude negroisms of the Southland, and laying it on the Holy Ghost.&quot; Parham made his way through the crowd, stood at the pulpit, and delivered a stinging rebuke: &quot;God is sick at his stomach!&quot; He proceeded to explain that God would not stand for such &quot;animalism.&quot; When it was clear that the majority of the Azusa Street Mission would not accept Parham&#x27;s leadership, Parham left with an estimated two to three hundred followers and opened a rival campaign at a nearby Women&#x27;s Christian Temperance Union building.

===Criticism===
In a skeptical front-page story titled &quot;Weird Babel of Tongues&quot;, a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reporter attempted to describe what would soon be known as the Azusa Street Revival. &quot;Breathing strange utterances and mouthing a creed which it would seem no sane mortal could understand&quot;, the story began, &quot;the newest religious sect has started in Los Angeles&quot;. Another local paper reporter in September 1906 described the happenings with the following words:

The attendees were often described as &quot;Holy Rollers&quot;, &quot;Holy Jumpers&quot;, &quot;Tangled Tonguers&quot; and &quot;Holy Ghosters&quot;. Reports were published throughout the U.S. and the world of the strange happenings in Los Angeles.

Christians from many traditions were critical, saying the movement was hyper-emotional, misused Scripture and lost focus on Christ by overemphasizing the Holy Spirit. Within a short time ministers were warning their congregations to stay away from the Azusa Street Mission. Some called the police and tried to get the building shut down.

===Apostolic Faith publication===

Also starting in September 1906 was the publication of the revival&#x27;s own newsletter, the &quot;Apostolic Faith&quot;. Issues were published occasionally up until May 1908, mostly through the work of Seymour and a white woman named Clara Lum, a member of the Apostolic Faith Mission. The &quot;Apostolic Faith&quot; was distributed without charge, and thousands of laypersons and ministers received copies worldwide. Five thousand copies of the first edition were printed, and by 1907 the press run reached over 40,000.

The &quot;Apostolic Faith&quot; publication reported the happenings at the Azusa Street Mission to the world. Its first issue&#x27;s lead story was titled &quot;Pentecost has Come&quot;. It contained a letter from Charles Parham, an article on Pentecost from Acts, and a series of anecdotes of people&#x27;s experience within the revival. One edition in 1907 wrote, &quot;One token of the Lord&#x27;s coming is that He is melting all races and nations together, and they are filled with the power and glory of God. He is baptizing by one spirit into one body and making up a people that will be ready to meet Him when He comes&quot;. The &quot;Apostolic Faith&quot; brought increasing attention to the happenings at Azusa Street and the fledgling movement that was emerging from the revival.

==Legacy==
By 1913, the revival at Azusa Street had lost momentum, and most of the media attention and crowds had left by 1915. Seymour remained there with his wife, Jennie, for the rest of their lives as pastors of the small African American congregation, though he often made short trips to help establish other smaller revivals later in life. After Seymour died of a heart attack on September 28, 1922, Jennie led the church until 1931, when the congregation lost the building.

===Sending of missionaries===
As &quot;The Apostolic Faith&quot; and many secular reports advertised the events of the Azusa Street Revival internationally, thousands of individuals visited the mission in order to witness it firsthand. At the same time, thousands of people were leaving Azusa Street with intentions of evangelizing abroad. Reverend K. E. M. Spooner visited the revival in 1909 and became one of the Pentecostal Holiness Church&#x27;s most effective missionaries in Africa, working among the Tswana people of Botswana.

A. G. Garr and his wife were sent from Azusa Street as missionaries to Calcutta, India, where they managed to start a small revival. Speaking in tongues in India did not enable them to speak the native language, Bengali. The Garrs later traveled to China where they arrived in Hong Kong and began to spread Pentecostalism in mainland China. They did this by working through other Protestant churches and organizations that had already been established. Garr significantly contributed to early Pentecostalism through his later work in redefining the &quot;biblical evidence&quot; doctrine and changing the doctrine from a belief that speaking in tongues was explicitly for evangelism to a belief that speaking in tongues was a gift for &quot;spiritual empowerment&quot;.

Missionary Bernt Bernsten traveled to the area from North China to investigate the happenings after hearing that the biblical prophecy of Acts 2:4 was being fulfilled. Other visitors left the revival to become missionaries in remote areas all over the world. So many missionaries went out from Azusa (some thirty-eight left in October 1906) that within two years the movement had spread to over fifty nations, including Britain, Scandinavia, Germany, Holland, Egypt, Syria, Palestine, South Africa, Hong Kong, China, Ceylon and India. Christian leaders visited from all over the world.

===Birth of Pentecostal movement===

By the end of 1906, most leaders from Azusa Street had spun off to form other congregations, such as the Apostolic Faith Church, 51st Street Apostolic Faith Mission, the Spanish AFM, and the Italian Pentecostal Mission. These missions were largely composed of immigrant or ethnic groups. The Southeast United States was a particularly prolific area of growth for the movement, since Seymour&#x27;s approach gave a useful explanation for a charismatic spiritual climate that had already been taking root in those areas. Other new missions were based on preachers who had charisma and energy. Nearly all of these new churches were founded among immigrants and the poor.

Many existing Wesleyan-holiness denominations adopted the Pentecostal message, such as the Church of God in Christ and the Pentecostal Holiness Church, and are now Holiness Pentecostal denominations. Holiness Pentecostals, such as the Apostolic Faith Church, affirm three works of grace: (1) New Birth, (2) entire sanctification, and (3) Baptism with the Holy Ghost. The formation of new denominations also occurred, motivated by doctrinal differences between Holiness Pentecostals and their Finished Work Pentecostal counterparts, such as the Assemblies of God formed in 1914 and the Pentecostal Church of God formed in 1919—these represent Finished Work Pentecostal denominations. An early doctrinal controversy led to a split between Trinitarian and Oneness Pentecostals, the latter founded the Pentecostal Assemblies of the World in 1916 and the United Pentecostal Church in 1945.

Today, there are more than 500 million Pentecostal and charismatic believers across the globe, and it [was] the fastest-growing form of Christianity today [in 1978]. The Azusa Street Revival is commonly regarded as the beginning of the modern-day Pentecostal Movement.

<text>Legio III Italica (&quot;Italian Third Legion&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army founded in 165 AD by the emperor Marcus Aurelius (r. AD 161–80) for his campaign against the Marcomanni tribe. The cognomen &quot;Italica&quot; suggests that the legion&#x27;s original recruits were drawn for the defence of Italy. The legion was still active in Raetia and other provinces in the early 5th century (Notitia Dignitatum, dated ca. 420 AD for Western Roman Empire entries).

Together with Legio II Italica and Legio I Adiutrix, Legio III Italica was in the Danube provinces from the beginning, fighting the Marcomanni invasion of the Raetia and Noricum provinces. In 171 AD, they built the camp &quot;Castra Regina&quot;, (modern Regensburg) designed as a strong defensive position.

In the civil war of 193 AD, this legion supported Septimius Severus and helped him defeat his opponents: first Didius Julianus, then Pescennius Niger, and Clodius Albinus. Their loyalty was extended to Severus&#x27; successor, Emperor Caracalla, for whom they fought in 213 AD in a campaign against the Alamanni.

== History ==
;Antonine Dynasty

In AD 165, the Emperor Marcus Aurelius raised two new legions – the Legio II Italica and Legio III Italica, in preparation for a major campaign. Gaius Vettius Sabinianus was the legion&#x27;s first commander. Immediately after treceiving their eagles, both legions were sent to Pannonia, which was being invaded by the Marcomanni. An inscription from Salona in Dalmatia attest to detachments (vexillationes) of the legion fortifying that strategic port city.

Under the command of Quintus Antistius Adventus, the Legio III Italica took part in the &quot;expeditio Germanica&quot; that protected Italy against Germanic tribes. In AD 170, the legion probably attacked the Germanic tribes under the command of the later Emperor Pertinax and in part succeeded in the process of expelling the Germanic invaders from the provinces of Raetia and Noricum.

During the AD 170s, the legion didn&#x27;t have an established base but was dispersed in detachments. Between AD 172 and 179, some cohorts of the legion were stationed in the large temporary fort of Eining. Other detachments were stationed at Alkofen and Regensburg Kumpfmuehl. A headquarters for the legion was established around AD 175, as attested by an inscription at the east gate of Castra Regina (modern Regensburg).

From AD 179, the entire legion was stationed in Castra Regina. In AD 182, the legion participated in a military campaign against the Germanic Burer tribe. Soon after their arrival in Raetia, the legion was involved in the construction and, among other things, the repairing of damage to the Limes forts that had occurred in the course of the Marcomanni wars. They also built forts in Ellingen, Pfünz, Künzing, Dambach, Passau and Straubing. For this operation, &quot;inter alia&quot;, the Legion used brickworks in Bad Abbach.

A section built in the year AD 181, under the supervision of a centurion, the safety fence of the fort Böhming is inscribed:

: Transferred soldiers (&quot;vexillarii&quot;) of Legio III Italica have the wall (&quot;vallum&quot;), built under the supervision of Julius Iulinus, centurion of Legio III Italica.

The majority of reinforcements for the legion came from the numerous villae rusticae in Raetia and initially served the legion well. 

After the catastrophic German invasions from the middle of the 3rd century, many of these farms were destroyed and not rebuilt.

Earlier, reinforcements were partly brought from northern Italy; in Trento an inscription was discovered dating from the late 2nd century from Gaius Valerius Marianus annonae, there as &quot;adlectus legionis III Italicae&quot; – (literally, selected for the food supply of the Legio III Italica). However, the route over the Brenner Pass was not the only supply line, also from the Great St. Bernard is a dedicatory inscription (200 AD) of Titus Claudius Severus, a &quot;frumentarius legionis&quot; (Logistics Officer). He donated a bronze votive tablet to Jupiter Poeninus while travelling through the pass, possibly as a courier on the orders of the governor.

Aurelius Silvinus, another &quot;frumentarius legionis&quot;, left behind in Rome a dedicatory inscription. He was probably an official under Severus Alexander, and consecrated on the Caelian a small marble statue of the god in the &quot;camp of the strangers&quot; (&quot;castra peregrina&quot;).

;Severan Dynasty

In the civil war of 193 (so-called Second Year of the Four Emperors), the legion supported Septimius Severus against Didius Julianus, and later against Clodius Albinus and Pescennius Niger in the struggle for the imperial throne.

As a reward for their loyalty, a series of coins were struck, which had a lapel one flanked by the eagle legion standards and the inscription LEG(io ) III ITAL(ica).

Their loyalty continued with Severus&#x27; successor and son Caracalla, under whose guidance in 213 they took part in a campaign against the Alemanni, and in 214 against the Karpen in Dacia and Syria in 217.

From this time the legion held the honorary title Antoniniana. Two inscriptions from the Dacian garrison city of Alba Iulia record the presence of two centurions of the III Legion, Marcus Ulpius Caius and Marcus Ulpius Vitalis. As part of the most battle-worthy army of the Danube, the III Italica was often involved in the conflicts of the so-called &quot;soldier-emperors&quot; in the Crisis of the Third Century. 

They also served under the last two Severans Elagabalus (218–222) and Severus Alexander (222–235). The latter gave the Legion the honorary title Severiana.

;Soldier Emperors

In an inscription from Celeia (Celje, Slovenia), another name of honor was added, Gordiana, suggesting that a detachment of the legion under Gordian III was proven in a campaign against the Sassanid Empire (242–244).

In 253 the legion supported the connection of their commander to the emperor Valerian. A detachment went with him in 259/60, again in the East, where an inscription of Shapur I. Sassanide, who Valerian defeated at Edessa and captured, talks of soldiers &quot; from the people of Raeter &quot; in the Roman army.

Meanwhile, in the West under the leadership of his son and second emperor Gallienus (253-268), the legion won multiple victories against German tribes, for which &quot;VI Pia VI Fidelis&quot; (six times faithful and loyal) and VII Pia VII Fidelis (seven times faithful and loyal) was awarded.

The Legio III Italica is not mentioned on the historically significant dedicatory inscription of the Augsburger Siegesaltar (made in 260), which has given rise to speculation about their whereabouts at the time.

A complete withdrawal of the Legion of Raetia is unlikely, as it was marching at this time only with the more flexible detachments in the field.

The Legion had been repeatedly deployed to the Persian front to fight against the usurper Ingenuus, and against the Alemanni. A complete withdrawal of the Legion would have been unlikely in view of the tense security situation.

In the year 273, the Legion was fighting in the war of Emperor Aurelian against the secession of the queen of Palmyra, Zenobia, in the east of the empire.

The legion was joined on the Palmyrenean campaign by a detachment of the Norian II Italica, and was involved in a decisive battle at Emesa (now Homs, Syria) in 272:

&quot;... The Palmyrene army of 70 000 men strong [ ... ] and gathered in the plain before Emesa .

Opposite them is [Aurelian] placed with his Dalmatian cavalry, and with the Moesiern, the Pannonians [...], and the Noriker and Rhaetians, the Celtic legions are ...&quot;

According to the &quot;Historia Augusta&quot;, in 275 Aurelian led an expedition to Raetia to again repulse sunken barbarians.

The Emperor Probus (276–282) was active militarily in Raetia and won a decisive victory at Lech in 278/279 over a coalition of Burgundians and Vandals. Despite this victory, in 282, Legio II and III Italica proclaimed the usurper Carus as a new emperor, by raising him on their shields.

Late Antiquity

In 285, a detachment of the Legion possibly took part in the campaign of Maximian to Africa. Selected existing soldiers of the Legion cohort was as Tertiani by the year 300 as legionis comitatenses in the field army Comes the Illyrici had been incorporated. They were under the command of the Magister Peditum Praesentalis.

Since the end of the 5th century the Rhaetian Legion no longer appears as a cohesive unit. Rather, they had been reorganized under the leadership of a sub-prefect into six major detachments. Approximately 1,000 men were probably still stationed at Castra Regina.

Since the main source for this is the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot;, apparently it no longer reflects the original unit with the &quot;pars inferior&quot; (the section between Regensburg and Passau), and can probably be taken more as detachments for the early 4th century. According to the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum,&quot; the northern border of Raetia was now formed of the &quot;pars superior&quot; (upper part), with larger departments of the Legion stationed in Submuntorio and Vallato.

The western boundary was the &quot;pars media&quot; (middle part) with the city Cambodunum and border post Vemania to Cassilacum. The Legio III Italica was now &quot;under the decree of the Most Honourable General of the provinces Raetiae I and II&quot; (&quot;Sub dispositione viri spectabilis ducis provinciae Raetiae primae et secundae&quot;). It was spread over five locations, where each detachment was again led by its own Praefectus.

The soldiers from Zirl transported food and consumer goods over the Brenner pass to Seefeld by horse and handed them over to the cohort on foot. From there supply boats could transport supplies further down the Lech Valley, to provide, for example, the departments in Submuntorio (Burghöfe or Mertingen) and others units.

The road on foot led northwest via Cambodunum (Kempten), where again the forts could be built at the Iller.

The detachments in forts probably oversaw the section of road to the nearby provincial capital of &quot;Augusta Vindelicorum&quot; (Augsburg). It is likely that this unit was also equipped with rowing boats and so controlled the Danube marshes west and east of the mouth of the Lech.

With the loss of Dekumatlandes, Cambodunum had become a border town. From Cambodunum to the mouth of the Iller, the Empire&#x27;s border ran along the route of the river.

There is a probable reference in the &quot;Notitia Dignitatum&quot; of a detachment of the Legio III Italica comprising about 200 men stationed on the higher grounds of the castle mound in this area. This detachment was likely responsible for the defense of the fort chain of Vimania (Isny) to Cassiliacum (Memmingen?).

==In the Crisis of the Third Century==

Since the cognomen &quot;III Italica Gordiana&quot; is recorded, vexillationes (detachments) of the legion were involved in Emperor Gordian III&#x27;s campaign against the Sassanid Empire in 243–244.

As part of the powerful Danubian army, &quot;Legio&quot; &quot;III&quot; &quot;Italica&quot; took part in the frequent 3rd century internal power struggles. The legion fought for Gallienus against his rival Postumus, so it was awarded with the &quot;VI Pia VI Fidelis&quot; (six times faithful and six times loyal) and VII Pia VII Fidelis (seven times faithful and seven times loyal) cognomen. &quot;Legio&quot; &quot;III&quot; &quot;Italica&quot; main camp was still Regensburg, but they were included in the 273 AD campaign commanded by Emperor Aurelian against Queen Zenobia.
==Notitia Dignitatum==

Detachments (vexillationes) of the legion, &quot;comitatensis&quot; units, are mentioned in Notitia Dignitatum as still being in Castra Regina and the Danubian provinces during the early 5th century.

<text>Chemical kinetics, also known as reaction kinetics, is the branch of physical chemistry that is concerned with understanding the rates of chemical reactions. It is different from chemical thermodynamics, which deals with the direction in which a reaction occurs but in itself tells nothing about its rate. Chemical kinetics includes investigations of how experimental conditions influence the speed of a chemical reaction and yield information about the reaction&#x27;s mechanism and transition states, as well as the construction of mathematical models that also can describe the characteristics of a chemical reaction.

== History ==
The pioneering work of chemical kinetics was done by German chemist Ludwig Wilhelmy in 1850. He experimentally studied the rate of inversion of sucrose and he used integrated rate law for the determination of the reaction kinetics of this reaction. His work was noticed 34 years later by Wilhelm Ostwald. In 1864, Peter Waage and Cato Guldberg published the law of mass action, which states that the speed of a chemical reaction is proportional to the quantity of the reacting substances.

Van &#x27;t Hoff studied chemical dynamics and in 1884 published his famous &quot;Études de dynamique chimique&quot;. In 1901 he was awarded the first Nobel Prize in Chemistry &quot;in recognition of the extraordinary services he has rendered by the discovery of the laws of chemical dynamics and osmotic pressure in solutions&quot;. After van &#x27;t Hoff, chemical kinetics dealt with the experimental determination of reaction rates from which rate laws and rate constants are derived. Relatively simple rate laws exist for zero order reactions (for which reaction rates are independent of concentration), first order reactions, and second order reactions, and can be derived for others. Elementary reactions follow the law of mass action, but the rate law of stepwise reactions has to be derived by combining the rate laws of the various elementary steps, and can become rather complex. In consecutive reactions, the rate-determining step often determines the kinetics. In consecutive first order reactions, a steady state approximation can simplify the rate law. The activation energy for a reaction is experimentally determined through the Arrhenius equation and the Eyring equation. The main factors that influence the reaction rate include: the physical state of the reactants, the concentrations of the reactants, the temperature at which the reaction occurs, and whether or not any catalysts are present in the reaction.

Gorban and Yablonsky have suggested that the history of chemical dynamics can be divided into three eras. The first is the van &#x27;t Hoff wave searching for the general laws of chemical reactions and relating kinetics to thermodynamics. The second may be called the Semenov-Hinshelwood wave with emphasis on reaction mechanisms, especially for chain reactions. The third is associated with Aris and the detailed mathematical description of chemical reaction networks.

== Factors affecting reaction rate ==

===Nature of the reactants===
The reaction rate varies depending upon what substances are reacting. Acid/base reactions, the formation of salts, and ion exchange are usually fast reactions. When covalent bond formation takes place between the molecules and when large molecules are formed, the reactions tend to be slower.

The nature and strength of bonds in reactant molecules greatly influence the rate of their transformation into products.

===Physical state===
The physical state (solid, liquid, or gas) of a reactant is also an important factor of the rate of change. When reactants are in the same phase, as in aqueous solution, thermal motion brings them into contact. However, when they are in separate phases, the reaction is limited to the interface between the reactants. Reaction can occur only at their area of contact; in the case of a liquid and a gas, at the surface of the liquid. Vigorous shaking and stirring may be needed to bring the reaction to completion. This means that the more finely divided a solid or liquid reactant the greater its surface area per unit volume and the more contact it with the other reactant, thus the faster the reaction. To make an analogy, for example, when one starts a fire, one uses wood chips and small branches — one does not start with large logs right away. In organic chemistry, on water reactions are the exception to the rule that homogeneous reactions take place faster than heterogeneous reactions (those in which solute and solvent are not mixed properly).

===Surface area of solid state ===
In a solid, only those particles that are at the surface can be involved in a reaction. Crushing a solid into smaller parts means that more particles are present at the surface, and the frequency of collisions between these and reactant particles increases, and so reaction occurs more rapidly. For example, Sherbet (powder) is a mixture of very fine powder of malic acid (a weak organic acid) and sodium hydrogen carbonate. On contact with the saliva in the mouth, these chemicals quickly dissolve and react, releasing carbon dioxide and providing for the fizzy sensation. Also, fireworks manufacturers modify the surface area of solid reactants to control the rate at which the fuels in fireworks are oxidised, using this to create diverse effects. For example, finely divided aluminium confined in a shell explodes violently. If larger pieces of aluminium are used, the reaction is slower and sparks are seen as pieces of burning metal are ejected.

===Concentration===
The reactions are due to collisions of reactant species. The frequency with which the molecules or ions collide depends upon their concentrations. The more crowded the molecules are, the more likely they are to collide and react with one another. Thus, an increase in the concentrations of the reactants will usually result in the corresponding increase in the reaction rate, while a decrease in the concentrations will usually have a reverse effect. For example, combustion will occur more rapidly in pure oxygen than in air (21% oxygen).

The rate equation shows the detailed dependence of the reaction rate on the concentrations of reactants and other species present. The mathematical forms depend on the reaction mechanism. The actual rate equation for a given reaction is determined experimentally and provides information about the reaction mechanism. The mathematical expression of the rate equation is often given by 
:formula_1
Here formula_2 is the reaction rate constant, formula_3 is the molar concentration of reactant &quot;i&quot; and formula_4 is the partial order of reaction for this reactant. The partial order for a reactant can only be determined experimentally and is often not indicated by its stoichiometric coefficient.

===Temperature===
Temperature usually has a major effect on the rate of a chemical reaction. Molecules at a higher temperature have more thermal energy. Although collision frequency is greater at higher temperatures, this alone contributes only a very small proportion to the increase in rate of reaction. Much more important is the fact that the proportion of reactant molecules with sufficient energy to react (energy greater than activation energy: &quot;E&quot; &gt; &quot;E&quot;&quot;a&quot;) is significantly higher and is explained in detail by the Maxwell–Boltzmann distribution of molecular energies.

The effect of temperature on the reaction rate constant usually obeys the Arrhenius equation formula_5, where A is the pre-exponential factor or A-factor, Ea is the activation energy, R is the molar gas constant and T is the absolute temperature.

At a given temperature, the chemical rate of a reaction depends on the value of the A-factor, the magnitude of the activation energy, and the concentrations of the reactants. Usually, rapid reactions require relatively small activation energies.

The &#x27;rule of thumb&#x27; that the rate of chemical reactions doubles for every 10 °C temperature rise is a common misconception. This may have been generalized from the special case of biological systems, where the &quot;α&quot; (temperature coefficient) is often between 1.5 and 2.5.

The kinetics of rapid reactions can be studied with the temperature jump method. This involves using a sharp rise in temperature and observing the relaxation time of the return to equilibrium. A particularly useful form of temperature jump apparatus is a shock tube, which can rapidly increase a gas&#x27;s temperature by more than 1000 degrees.

===Catalysts===
A catalyst is a substance that alters the rate of a chemical reaction but it remains chemically unchanged afterwards. The catalyst increases the rate of the reaction by providing a new reaction mechanism to occur with in a lower activation energy. In autocatalysis a reaction product is itself a catalyst for that reaction leading to positive feedback. Proteins that act as catalysts in biochemical reactions are called enzymes. Michaelis–Menten kinetics describe the rate of enzyme mediated reactions. A catalyst does not affect the position of the equilibrium, as the catalyst speeds up the backward and forward reactions equally.

In certain organic molecules, specific substituents can have an influence on reaction rate in neighbouring group participation.

===Pressure===
Increasing the pressure in a gaseous reaction will increase the number of collisions between reactants, increasing the rate of reaction. This is because the activity of a gas is directly proportional to the partial pressure of the gas. This is similar to the effect of increasing the concentration of a solution.

In addition to this straightforward mass-action effect, the rate coefficients themselves can change due to pressure. The rate coefficients and products of many high-temperature gas-phase reactions change if an inert gas is added to the mixture; variations on this effect are called fall-off and chemical activation. These phenomena are due to exothermic or endothermic reactions occurring faster than heat transfer, causing the reacting molecules to have non-thermal energy distributions (non-Boltzmann distribution). Increasing the pressure increases the heat transfer rate between the reacting molecules and the rest of the system, reducing this effect.

Condensed-phase rate coefficients can also be affected by pressure, although rather high pressures are required for a measurable effect because ions and molecules are not very compressible. This effect is often studied using diamond anvils.

A reaction&#x27;s kinetics can also be studied with a pressure jump approach. This involves making fast changes in pressure and observing the relaxation time of the return to equilibrium.

===Absorption of light===
The activation energy for a chemical reaction can be provided when one reactant molecule absorbs light of suitable wavelength and is promoted to an excited state. The study of reactions initiated by light is photochemistry, one prominent example being photosynthesis.

==Experimental methods==

The experimental determination of reaction rates involves measuring how the concentrations of reactants or products change over time. For example, the concentration of a reactant can be measured by spectrophotometry at a wavelength where no other reactant or product in the system absorbs light.

For reactions which take at least several minutes, it is possible to start the observations after the reactants have been mixed at the temperature of interest.

=== Fast reactions ===
For faster reactions, the time required to mix the reactants and bring them to a specified temperature may be comparable or longer than the half-life of the reaction. Special methods to start fast reactions without slow mixing step include

* Stopped flow methods, which can reduce the mixing time to the order of a millisecond The stopped flow methods have limitation, for example, we need to consider the time it takes to mix gases or solutions and are not suitable if the half-life is less than about a hundredth of a second.
* Chemical relaxation methods such as temperature jump and pressure jump, in which a pre-mixed system initially at equilibrium is perturbed by rapid heating or depressurization so that it is no longer at equilibrium, and the relaxation back to equilibrium is observed. For example, this method has been used to study the neutralization H3O+ + OH− with a half-life of 1 μs or less under ordinary conditions.
* Flash photolysis, in which a laser pulse produces highly excited species such as free radicals, whose reactions are then studied.

== Equilibrium ==
While chemical kinetics is concerned with the rate of a chemical reaction, thermodynamics determines the extent to which reactions occur. In a reversible reaction, chemical equilibrium is reached when the rates of the forward and reverse reactions are equal (the principle of dynamic equilibrium) and the concentrations of the reactants and products no longer change. This is demonstrated by, for example, the Haber–Bosch process for combining nitrogen and hydrogen to produce ammonia. Chemical clock reactions such as the Belousov–Zhabotinsky reaction demonstrate that component concentrations can oscillate for a long time before finally attaining the equilibrium.

== Free energy ==
In general terms, the free energy change (ΔG) of a reaction determines whether a chemical change will take place, but kinetics describes how fast the reaction is. A reaction can be very exothermic and have a very positive entropy change but will not happen in practice if the reaction is too slow. If a reactant can produce two products, the thermodynamically most stable one will form in general, except in special circumstances when the reaction is said to be under kinetic reaction control. The Curtin–Hammett principle applies when determining the product ratio for two reactants interconverting rapidly, each going to a distinct product. It is possible to make predictions about reaction rate constants for a reaction from free-energy relationships.

The kinetic isotope effect is the difference in the rate of a chemical reaction when an atom in one of the reactants is replaced by one of its isotopes.

Chemical kinetics provides information on residence time and heat transfer in a chemical reactor in chemical engineering and the molar mass distribution in polymer chemistry. It is also provides information in corrosion engineering.

==Applications and models==
The mathematical models that describe chemical reaction kinetics provide chemists and chemical engineers with tools to better understand and describe chemical processes such as food decomposition, microorganism growth, stratospheric ozone decomposition, and the chemistry of biological systems. These models can also be used in the design or modification of chemical reactors to optimize product yield, more efficiently separate products, and eliminate environmentally harmful by-products. When performing catalytic cracking of heavy hydrocarbons into gasoline and light gas, for example, kinetic models can be used to find the temperature and pressure at which the highest yield of heavy hydrocarbons into gasoline will occur.

Chemical Kinetics is frequently validated and explored through modeling in specialized packages as a function of ordinary differential equation-solving (ODE-solving) and curve-fitting.

=== Numerical methods ===
In some cases, equations are unsolvable analytically, but can be solved using numerical methods if data values are given. There are two different ways to do this, by either using software programmes or mathematical methods such as the Euler method. Examples of software for chemical kinetics are i) Tenua, a Java app which simulates chemical reactions numerically and allows comparison of the simulation to real data, ii) Python coding for calculations and estimates and iii) the Kintecus software compiler to model, regress, fit and optimize reactions.

-Numerical integration: for a 1st order reaction A → B

The differential equation of the reactant A is:
formula_6

It can also be expressed as
formula_7 which is the same as formula_8

To solve the differential equations with Euler and Runge-Kutta methods we need to have the initial values.

<text>The Irish Army () is the land component of the Defence Forces of Ireland. As well as maintaining its primary roles of defending the State and internal security within the State, since 1958 the Army has had a continuous presence in peacekeeping missions around the world. The Irish Army is organised into two brigades.The Air Corps and Naval Service support the Army in carrying out its roles.

The Army has an active establishment of 7,520, and a reserve establishment of 3,869. Like other components of the Defence Forces, the Irish Army has struggled to maintain strength and had only 6,322 active personnel, and 1,382 reserve personnel. However, the Irish government introduced several measures in an attempt to improve recruitment and retention, and in 2024 inductions to the Defence Forces exceeded discharges.

== Roles of the Army ==
The roles of the Army are:
* To defend the Irish state against armed aggression.
* To give aid to the civil power (ATCP). This means that the Army assists, when requested, the Garda Síochána, who have primary responsibility for law and order in Ireland.
* To participate in multinational peace support, crisis management and humanitarian relief operations in support of the United Nations peacekeeping missions, and EUFOR (UN-sanctioned peacekeeping missions only).
* To carry out other duties which may be assigned to them from time to time. For example, assistance on the occasion of natural disasters, assistance in connection with the maintenance of essential services, etc.

==History==

===Beginning of the Army===
The Defence Forces, including the Army, trace their origins to the Irish Republican Army (IRA), the guerrilla organisation that fought British government forces during the Irish War of Independence. In February 1922, the Provisional Government began to recruit volunteers into the new National Army.

The Provisional Government was set up on 16 January 1922 to assume power in the new Irish Free State. On 31 January 1922, a former IRA unit (the Dublin Guard) assumed its new role as the first unit of the new National Army and took over Beggars Bush Barracks, the first British barracks to be handed to the new Irish Free State. The National Army&#x27;s first Commander-in-Chief, Michael Collins, envisaged the new Army being built around the pre-existing IRA, but over half of this organisation rejected the compromises required by the Anglo-Irish Treaty which established the Irish Free State, and favoured upholding the revolutionary Irish Republic which had been established in 1919.

As such, from January 1922 until late June and the outbreak of the Irish Civil War, there existed two antagonistic armed forces: the National Army, built from a nucleus of pro-Treaty IRA units, and armed and paid by the Provisional Government; and the anti-Treaty IRA who refused to accept the legitimacy of the new state. Both forces continued to use the Irish-language title Óglaigh na hÉireann, which had previously been used by both the original IRA and its predecessor, the Irish Volunteers of the mid-1910s. In July 1922, Dáil Éireann authorised raising a force of 35,000 men; by May 1923 this had grown to 58,000. The National Army lacked the expertise necessary to train a force of that size, such that approximately one-fifth of its officers and half of its soldiers were Irish ex-servicemen of the British Army, who brought considerable experience to it.

===Civil War period===
The Irish Civil War broke out on 28 June 1922. The pro-Treaty Sinn Féin party had won an election on 16 June. The British were applying increasing pressure on the government to assert its control over the anti-Treaty units of the IRA who had occupied the Four Courts in Dublin; this garrison had kidnapped JJ O&#x27;Connell, a lieutenant-general in the National Army.

In the early weeks of the Civil War, the newly formed National Army was mainly composed of pro-Treaty IRA units, especially the Dublin Guard, whose members had personal ties to Michael Collins. Its size was estimated at 7,000 men, in contrast to about 15,000 anti-Treaty IRA men. However, the Free State soon recruited far more troops, with the army&#x27;s size mushrooming to 55,000 men and 3,500 officers by the end of the Civil War in May 1923. Many of its recruits were war-hardened Irishmen who had served in the British Army during the First World War. W. R. E. Murphy, a second-in-command of the National Army in the civil war (from January until May 1923), had been a lieutenant colonel in the British Army, as had Emmet Dalton. Indeed, the Free State recruited experienced soldiers from wherever it could; two more of its senior generals, John T. Prout and JJ &quot;Ginger&quot; O&#x27;Connell, had served in the United States Army.

The British government had supplied the National Army with small arms and ammunition as they departed from Ireland as well as a few armoured cars. They later supplied artillery which enabled it to bring the Civil War to a relatively speedy conclusion. The Four Courts and O&#x27;Connell Street were taken from anti-Treaty IRA units during the Battle of Dublin in July 1922. The anti-Treaty IRA were also dislodged from Limerick and Waterford in that month and Cork and County Kerry were secured in a decisive seaborne offensive in August.

The remainder of the war was a guerrilla war, concentrated particularly in the south and west of the country. On 15 October, directives were sent to the press by Piaras Béaslaí, the Free State director of communications, to the effect that Free State troops were to be referred to as the &quot;National Army&quot;, the &quot;Irish Army&quot;, or just &quot;troops&quot;. The Anti-Treaty troops were to be called &quot;Irregulars&quot; and were not to be referred to as &quot;Republicans&quot;, &quot;IRA&quot;, &quot;forces&quot;, or &quot;troops&quot;, nor were the ranks of their officers allowed to be given. National Army units, especially the Dublin Guard, were implicated in a series of atrocities against captured anti-Treaty fighters.

The National Army suffered about 800 fatalities in the Civil War, including its commander-in-chief, Michael Collins. Collins was succeeded by Richard Mulcahy.

In April 1923, the anti-Treaty IRA called a ceasefire, and in May it ordered its fighters to &quot;dump arms&quot;, effectively ending the war.

===National Army===
With the end of the Civil War, the National Army had grown too big for a peacetime role and was too expensive for the new Irish state to maintain. In addition, many of the civil war recruits were badly trained and undisciplined, making them unsuitable material for a full-time professional army. The Special Infantry Corps was established to perform the army&#x27;s first post-war duty, breaking the strikes of agricultural labourers in Munster and south Leinster, as well as reversing factory seizures by socialists.

Richard Mulcahy, the new Irish defence minister, proposed to reduce the army from 55,000 to 18,000 men in the immediate post-Civil War period. This provoked mutiny among National Army officers in 1923–24, particularly among former IRA officers who considered that former British Army officers were being treated better than they were.

On 3 August 1923, the new State passed the Defence Forces (Temporary Provisions) Act, putting the existing armed forces on a legal footing. This Act raised &quot;&quot;an armed force to be called Óglaigh na hÉireann (hereinafter referred to as the Forces) consisting of such number of officers, non-commissioned officers, and men as may from time to time be provided by the Oireachtas&quot;.&quot; The date of the establishment of the Defence Forces was 1 October 1924. The term &quot;National Army&quot; fell into disuse.

The Army had a new establishment, organisation, rank markings, headdress and orders of dress. The National Army&#x27;s Air Service became the Air Corps and remained part of the Army until the 1990s. An all-Irish language-speaking unit was created – &quot;An Chéad Chathlán Coisithe&quot; (English: The First Infantry Battalion) was established in Galway, and functioned exclusively through the medium of the Irish state&#x27;s first official language.

=== The Emergency ===
Ireland remained neutral during the Second World War, which was referred to as &quot;The Emergency&quot; by the Irish government. About 5,000 soldiers deserted and joined the British military. Those who returned in 1945 were summarily dismissed from the armed forces and disqualified from any form of state-funded employment for seven years. These soldiers received an official amnesty and apology from the government of Ireland on 7 May 2013.

Despite the Irish stance of neutrality, the Army was greatly expanded during the war (with more recruited to reserve forces). At its peak, the army was made up of almost 41,000 personnel, with another 106,000 reservists. Upon the outbreak of war two independent brigades were raised. During the so-called Phoney War period, numbers of men mobilised decreased. The Fall of France, however, saw a significant change in the government&#x27;s attitude, and by early 1941 seven brigades were mobilised. On 9 May 1941, Minister for Defence Oscar Traynor approved the establishment of the 1st Division and 2nd Division, both of which encompassed six brigades, leaving the 5th Brigade to remain independent, as part of Curragh Command. This expansion was undertaken in the face of potential invasions from either the Allied or Axis powers (both of whom had drawn up contingency plans to invade Ireland).

In the Christmas Raid of 1939, the remnants of the IRA stole a large quantity of the Irish Army&#x27;s reserve ammunition from its dump at the Magazine Fort in Dublin&#x27;s Phoenix Park. While this was seen as an embarrassment for the Irish Army, most of it was recovered.

For the duration of the war, Ireland, while formally neutral, tacitly supported the Allies in several ways. For example, the Donegal Corridor allowed British military aircraft based in County Fermanagh to fly through Irish airspace to the Atlantic, thereby greatly increasing their operational range. G2, the Army&#x27;s intelligence section, played a role in the detection and arrest of German spies, such as Hermann Görtz.

== Peacekeeping missions ==
Since Ireland joined the United Nations in 1955, the Army has been deployed on many peacekeeping missions. The first of these took place in 1958 when a small number of observers were sent to Lebanon. A total of 86 Irish soldiers have died in the service of the United Nations since 1960 (&quot;see List of Irish military casualties overseas&quot;).

===Congo===
The first major overseas deployment came in 1960, when Irish troops were sent to the Congo as part of the UN force ONUC. The Belgian Congo became an independent republic on 30 June 1960. Twelve days later, the Congolese government requested military assistance from the United Nations to maintain its territorial integrity. On 28 July 1960 Lt-Col Murt Buckley led the 32nd Irish Battalion to the newly independent central African country. This was the most costly enterprise for the Army since the Civil War, as 26 Irish soldiers died.

Nine died in a single incident called the &quot;Niemba Ambush&quot;, in which an eleven-man Irish patrol was ambushed by local tribesmen. Nine Irish soldiers and some 25 tribesmen were killed. A Niemba Ambush commemoration is hosted annually by the Irish Veterans Organisation (ONET) in Cathal Brugha Barracks, on the nearest Saturday to the actual date of the ambush.

One of the largest ONUC engagements in which Irish troops were involved was the Siege of Jadotville. During this action, a small party of 155 Irish soldiers (&quot;A&quot; Company, 35th Battalion) was attacked by a larger force of almost 4,000 Katangese troops, as well as French, Belgian and Rhodesian mercenaries, and supported by a trainer jet (a Fouga CM.170 Magister), equipped for ground attack. The Irish soldiers repeatedly repelled the attackers, and knocked out enemy artillery and mortar positions using 60mm mortars. An attempt was made by 500 Irish and Swedish Army soldiers to break through to the besieged company, but the attempt failed. A Company&#x27;s commanding officer Commandant Patrick Quinlan, eventually surrendered his forces. A small number of Irish soldiers were wounded, but none killed. It is estimated, however, that up to 300 of A Company&#x27;s attackers were killed, including 30 white mercenaries, and that up to 1,000 were wounded.

A total of 6,000 Irishmen served in the Congo from 1960 until 1964.

===Cyprus and the Sinai===
Starting in 1964, Irish troops have served as UN peacekeepers in Cyprus (UNFICYP). Over 9,000 Irish personnel have served there to date, without suffering casualties.

In 1973, an infantry group and some logistical troops were pulled out of Cyprus at short notice to serve in the Sinai desert between Egypt and Israel as part of the UN force that supervised the ceasefire that ended the Yom Kippur War.

From 1976 to 1981, UNFICYP was commanded by an Irish officer, Major-General James Quinn.

===Lebanon===


From 1978 to 2001, a battalion of Irish troops was deployed in southern Lebanon, as part of the UN mandate force UNIFIL. The Irish battalion consisted of 580 personnel which were rotated every six months, plus almost 100 others in UNIFIL headquarters and the Force Mobile Reserve. In all, 30,000 Irish soldiers served in Lebanon over 23 years.

The Irish troops in Lebanon were initially intended to supervise the withdrawal of the Israel Defense Forces from the area after an invasion in 1978 and to prevent fighting between the Palestine Liberation Organization forces and Israel.

In April 1980, three Irish soldiers were killed in an episode of violence near At Tiri in Southern Lebanon. On 16 April 1980, soldiers attempting to set up a checkpoint near At Tiri were attacked by members of the South Lebanon Army (an Israeli-backed Christian militia). Private Stephen Griffin, of the 46th Irish Battalion, was shot in the head and died. Two days later, a party of three Irish soldiers, an American officer, a French officer and two journalists were travelling to a UN post near the Israeli border when they were intercepted by members of the S.L.A. Private John O&#x27;Mahony from Killarney, County Kerry was shot and wounded and his two comrades Privates Thomas Barrett from Cork and Derek Smallhorne from Dublin were driven away. Both men were found shot dead nearby, with their bodies showing signs of torture.

Another Israeli invasion in 1982 forced the PLO out of southern Lebanon and occupied the area. The following eighteen years until 2000 saw prolonged guerrilla warfare between Israeli forces, their allies in the South Lebanon Army and Hezbollah. UNIFIL was caught in the middle of this conflict. The Irish battalion&#x27;s role consisted of manning checkpoints and observations posts and mounting patrols. A total of 47 soldiers were killed. In addition to peacekeeping, the Irish provided humanitarian aid to the local population – for example, aiding the orphanage at Tibnin. From 25 April 1995 to 9 May 1996, Brigadier General P. Redmond served as Deputy Force Commander of UNIFIL during a period that coincided with the Israeli Operation Grapes of Wrath offensive in 1996.

Most Irish troops were withdrawn from Lebanon in 2001, following the Israeli evacuation of their forces the previous year. However, 11 Irish troops remained there as observers. They were present during the 2006 Lebanon War. After this conflict, UNIFIL was reinforced and a mechanised infantry company of 165 Irish troops was deployed to southern Lebanon. Their role was to provide perimeter protection for a Finnish Army engineering unit. After 12 months, the 1st Finnish/Irish Battalion ceased operations and was stood down from duty after having completed its mandate with UNIFIL. A number of Irish personnel remained in service at UNIFIL HQ in Southern Lebanon.
Irish battalions returned to Lebanon in 2011 – initially with roughly 480 troops deployed in the region. This was reduced to approximately 330 troops in May 2013, and further to 180 troops in November 2013. As of May 2016, there were 194 Irish soldiers deployed to UNIFIL serving alongside Finnish Armed Forces as part of a joint Battalion which is currently under Finnish command. Ireland takes over command of the Battalion from Finland in November 2016 at which time an additional Company of some 150 personnel will be deployed to UNIFIL bringing Ireland&#x27;s contribution to this mission to 340 personnel.

In November 2022, 333 Irish soldiers deployed to southern Lebanon as part of UNIFIL&#x27;s 121st Infantry Battalion. On 14 December 2022, one Irish peacekeeper was killed and seven others were injured in a &quot;serious incident&quot; involving small arms fire in the Hezbollah controlled village of Al-Aqbieh.

===Iran and Iraq===
From August 1988 until May 1991, Irish soldiers were deployed under the UN force UNIIMOG, on the border between Iraq and Iran to supervise the withdrawal of both sides&#x27; forces to within their respective borders after the end of the Iran–Iraq War. The Irish provided 177 of the 400 UNIIMOG personnel involved with the mission. The mission came to an end in 1991, when Iran and Iraq completed the withdrawal of their troops. A small number of Irish observers were stationed in Kuwait from 1991 to 2002 as part of UNIKOM.

===Somalia and Eritrea===
In 1993, 100 troops forming a transport company were deployed in Somalia, as part of the UNOSOM II peace-enforcing mission. In December 2001, 221 Irish soldiers were sent to Eritrea as part of UNMEE, and were tasked with the defence of the UN headquarters there.

===Bosnia and Kosovo===
In 1997 an Irish Army Military Police unit and a company of transport corps troops were deployed to Bosnia as part of SFOR (1995–2005) and EUFOR (December 2005 to present). The MP company was based in SFOR HQ in Sarajevo and policed the 8,000 SFOR troops based in the area. From 1999 until 2010, a company of Irish troops was stationed in Kosovo as part of KFOR.

===East Timor===
In July 1999, Irish officers were sent to East Timor as part of the UNAMET observer group (Timorese Independence Referendum). In October, a platoon of Rangers (1 Ircon) from the Army Ranger Wing (ARW) were sent as part of the INTERFET peacekeeping force after the Referendum. The ARW platoon served in the reconnaissance company of the 1st Battalion, Royal New Zealand Regiment (1 RNZIR) Battalion Group for a four-month tour. INTERFET handed over to UNTAET during ARW 2 Ircon&#x27;s tour in 2000. The third contingent to East Timor (3 Ircon) in June 2000 marked a new departure for the Defence Forces, as all the infantry sections were drawn from the 2nd Infantry Battalion. Late 2000 saw the 12th Infantry supply 4 Ircon. Nine contingents in total were deployed including 4 Infantry Battalion, 5 Infantry Battalion, 28 Infantry Battalion, 1 Cathlán Coisithe, and finally the 6 Infantry Battalion under UNMISET until May 2004.

===Liberia===
After November 2003, Irish troops were stationed in Liberia as part of UNMIL. The Liberian mission was the largest Irish overseas deployment since Lebanon and consisted of a single composite battalion. The UN force, UNMIL, was 15,000 strong and was charged with stabilising the country after the Second Liberian Civil War. The Irish troops were based in Camp Clara, near Monrovia and were tasked with acting as the Force Commander&#x27;s &quot;Quick Reaction Force&quot; (QRF) in the Monrovia area. This meant the securing of key locations, conducting searches for illegally held weapons, patrolling and manning checkpoints on the main roads and providing security to civilians under threat of violence. The Irish deployment to Liberia was due to end in November 2006. However, at that time the deployment was extended for a further 6 months to May 2007. During the UNMIL deployment, a detachment of Irish Army Rangers successfully rescued a group of civilians being held hostage by renegade Liberian gunmen. Acting on intelligence, twenty heavily armed Rangers were dropped by helicopter, freeing the hostages and capturing the rebel leader. In all the following battalions were involved in 2,745 cumulative missions under UNMIL:
* 90th Infantry Battalion (4th Western Brigade) – Nov 2003-May 2004
* 91st Infantry Battalion (2nd Eastern Brigade) – May 2004-Nov 2004
* 92nd Infantry Battalion (1st Southern Brigade) – Nov 2004-May 2005
* 93rd Infantry Battalion (4th Western Brigade) – May 2005-Nov 2005
* 94th Infantry Battalion (2nd Eastern Brigade) – Nov 2005-May 2006
* 95th Infantry Battalion (1st Southern Brigade) – May 2006-Nov 2006
* 96th Infantry Battalion (4th Western Brigade) – Nov 2006-May 2007

===Chad===
In August 2007, the Irish government announced that 200 Irish soldiers would be sent to support the United Nations effort as part of EUFOR Chad/CAR. As of 2008 500 troops had been deployed – 54 of whom were Irish Army Rangers. In announcing the mission, the Minister for Defence recognised the regional nature of the crisis, involving instability in Darfur, Chad and the Central African Republic. In accordance with their terms of reference, the deployment of Irish forces was confined to Chad. Ireland contributed the second largest contingent of soldiers to EUFOR Chad/CAR, after France, as part of the mission to establish peace in Chad and to protect refugees from neighbouring Darfur. The Irish soldiers conducted operations concerned with the delivery of humanitarian aid, protection of civilians, and ensuring the safety of UN personnel. There were a number of deployments to the mission, rotating every four months, with the final contingent completing their tour in May 2010:
* 97th Infantry Battalion – June 2008-Oct 2008
* 98th Infantry Battalion – Oct 2008-Jan 2009
* 99th Infantry Battalion – Jan 2009-May 2009
* 100th Infantry Battalion – May 2009-Oct 2009
* 101st Infantry Battalion – Oct 2009-Jan 2010
* 102nd Infantry Battalion – Jan 2010-May 2010

=== Syria ===
In 2013 the United Nations asked Ireland to send peacekeepers as part of the United Nations Disengagement Observer Force (UNDOF) in the Golan region of Syria, to try to contain the Syrian civil war from spreading into Israel. The 43 Infantry Group, consisting of 115 personnel, deployed into Syria in September 2013. The group is tasked primarily to serve as the Force Mobile Reserve within the UNDOF Area of Responsibility. The Irish peacekeepers were attacked by Syrian rebels on 29 November 2013. The Irish convoy came under small arms fire and a Mowag APC later struck a land mine, damaging the vehicle, when driving out of the attack. The Irish returned fire with 12.7mm (.50 calibre) heavy machine guns mounted on their vehicles before the rebels retreated.

The Irish were involved in a combat mission in August 2014 after 44 Fijian UN troops were captured by the rebel Al Nusra organisation. Nearby, 35 Filipino UN troops managed to conduct a successful breakout attempt and an armoured escort from the Irish 44th Infantry Group escorted the Filipino soldiers to safety. Fire was exchanged with heavy machine guns but there were no casualties on the UN side. The Irish Minister for Foreign Affairs stated he would withdraw the Irish contingent from Golan unless guarantees could be given about their safety. &#x27;&quot;We don&#x27;t want to see Irish troops or the UN contingent being drawn into a Syrian civil war&quot;&#x27;, he said. Irish troops were withdrawn into Israeli occupied Golan in 2014. Nevertheless, as of late 2016, 138 Irish troops remained deployed in the region under UNDOF. In late 2018 the UN contingent returned to the Syria side of the de facto border after Syrian government forces took Daraa and Quneitra from rebel forces in the 2018 Southern Syria offensive.

==Current overseas deployments==
As of 1 December 2015, 493 Defence Force personnel are serving in 12 different missions throughout the world including Lebanon (UNIFIL), Syria (UNDOF), Middle East (UNTSO), Kosovo (KFOR), German-led Battle Group 2016 and other observer and staff appointments to UN, EU, OSCE and PfP posts. 
The largest deployments include:
* Lebanon (UNIFIL) 51 Infantry Group
* Syria (UNDOF) 50 Infantry Group

== Training ==
All enlisted members of the Army undergo 29 weeks of training in order to become a fully trained infantry soldier. The first 17 weeks is recruit training, after which they become a 2 Star Private. They then undergo a further 12 weeks of advanced training, after which they pass-out as a 3 Star Private, Trooper or Gunner depending on their respective Corps. During this continuous 29 weeks of training, they are required to live in barracks. The Army recruits both men and women.

Recruit training includes foot drill, arms drill, field-craft, medical, radio operation, rifle marksmanship, unarmed combat, counter-IED, tactical and daily physical training (PT). During this stage of training, they are also given weapons training on the Steyr Rifle, General Purpose Machine Gun and grenade.

On completion of recruit training, soldiers become 2 Star Privates and immediately begin 3 Star training. This includes more advanced training of everything covered by recruit training plus riot training, navigation, CBRN, helicopter drills, survival, FIBUA, ATCP training, live fire tactical training, etc. They also receive further weapons training on the M203 Grenade Launcher and Short Range Anti-Armour Weapon.

Throughout their service, soldiers must complete Trained Soldier Specialist Training courses to advance their skills and for promotion.

== Organisation ==
As of 2023, the Army had an establishment of 7,520 active and 3,869 reserve personnel organised into two brigades. Prior to 2012, the army was divided into three brigades, organised to be responsible for a geographical area of the State: Southern, Eastern and Western. Following budgetary decisions in 2011, the army was reorganised in late 2012 into a two brigades structure. The training element of the army, the Defence Forces Training Centre, operates independently of the brigade structure.

* Irish Army
** 1st Brigade, at Collins Barracks in Cork
** 2nd Brigade, at Cathal Brugha Barracks in Dublin
** Defence Forces Training Centre, at Curragh Camp in Curragh
** Army Ranger Wing, at Curragh Camp in Curragh

==Army Corps==

===Infantry Corps===

The Infantry Corps represent the largest component and are the operational troops of the Army. They must be prepared for tactical deployment in any location at short notice. In wartime this means that they will be among the frontline troops in the defence of the Irish state. In peacetime, they can be seen daily performing operational duties in aid to the civil power such as providing escorts to cash, prisoner or explosive shipments, patrols of vital state installations and border patrols, including checkpoints.

===Artillery Corps===
The Artillery Corps provides fire support as required by infantry or armoured elements. The Corps was founded in 1924 and today consists of two main branches: Field Artillery and Air Defence. Between them, the two branches of the Corps provide several vital services;
* Fire support of Infantry or Armoured troops.
* Ground to low-level air defence.
* Light field battery support to Irish overseas battalion.
* Aid to the civil power duties.

Each brigade has a single artillery regiment.

===Cavalry Corps===
The Cavalry Corps is the army&#x27;s armoured reconnaissance formation.

===Engineer Corps===

The Engineer Corps is the combat engineering unit of the Defence Forces. The Engineer Corps is responsible for all military engineering matters across the Defence Forces.

===Ordnance Corps===
The responsibility for the procurement and maintenance of all ordnance equipment is vested in the Ordnance Corps and encompasses a spectrum of equipment ranging from anti-aircraft missiles and naval armament to the uniforms worn by military personnel. The corps is also responsible for the procurement of food and provision of commercial catering services. These tasks are of a technical nature and the corps personnel are appropriately qualified and with the expertise to afford technical evaluation of complete weapon systems, it also includes embracing weapons, ammunition, fire control instruments and night vision equipment. The Ordnance Corps provides improvised explosive device disposal within the state, in support of the Garda Síochána. Courses are conducted for its own personnel and for students from the military and police of other nations. Ordnance Corps personnel continue to serve in overseas missions and are an essential component of missions involving troops.

===Transport Corps===

The Transport Corps is responsible for procurement, management and maintenance of soft-skinned vehicles, and maintenance of armoured vehicles. It is also responsible for the driving standards, training and certification, as well as providing vehicle fuels and lubricants, and certain logistics – such as heavy lift capabilities.

===Medical Corps===

The Medical Corps is responsible for promoting health and treating sick or wounded personnel, and has provided medical and dental support in all the Army&#x27;s main UN missions. As with similar branches in other militaries, they also sometimes provide humanitarian assistance to local civilian populations – by giving medical aid where local health services are not functioning adequately.

===Military Police Corps===

The Military Police (, hence the nickname &quot;PAs&quot;) are responsible for the prevention and investigation of offences, the enforcement of discipline and the general policing of the Defence Forces. In wartime, additional tasks include the provision of a traffic control organisation to allow rapid movement of military formations to their mission areas. Other wartime rules include control of prisoners of war and refugees. Traditionally, the Military Police have had involvement at State and ceremonial occasions. In recent years the Military Police have been deployed in UN missions (such as Iran and Iraq) and later in the former Yugoslavia (SFOR). The Gardaí assist in providing specialist police training to the Military Police in the field of crime investigation.

===Communications &amp; IT Corps===

The Communications and Information Services (CIS) Corps is a support corps responsible for installing, maintaining and operating telecommunications equipment and information systems.

==Rank structure==
The rank structure of the Irish Army is organised along standard military rank and command structures. These consist of the following ranks:

;Officers
;Other ranks
==Equipment==
===Weapons===
The Army has historically purchased and used weapons and equipment from other western countries, mainly from Western European nations. Ireland has a very limited arms industry and rarely produces its own armaments.

From its establishment the Army used the British-made Lee–Enfield .303 rifle, which would be the mainstay for many decades. In the 1960s some modernisation came with the introduction of the Belgian-made FN FAL 7.62 mm battle rifle. Since 1989 the service rifle for the Army is the Austrian-made Steyr AUG 5.56 mm assault rifle (used by all branches of the Defence Forces).

Other weapons in use by the Army include the USP 9mm pistol, M203 grenade launcher, FN MAG machine gun, M2 Browning machine gun, Accuracy International Arctic Warfare sniper rifles, AT4 SRAAW, FGM-148 Javelin Anti-tank guided missile, L118 105mm Howitzer, and RBS 70 Surface to Air Missile system.

===Vehicles===
The Army has purchased 80 Swiss made Mowag Piranha Armoured personnel carriers which have become the Army&#x27;s primary vehicle in the Mechanized infantry role. These are equipped with 12.7 mm HMGs, or the Oto Melara 30 mm Autocannon. The Army operates a number of RG Outriders.

<text>Flintshire () is a county in the north-east of Wales. It borders the English ceremonial counties of Merseyside and Cheshire, across the Dee Estuary to the north and by land to the east respectively, Wrexham County Borough to the south, and Denbighshire to the west. Connah&#x27;s Quay is the largest town, while Flintshire County Council is based in Mold.

The county covers , with a population of 155,000 in 2021. After Connah&#x27;s Quay-Shotton (23,000) the largest settlements are Flint (13,736), Buckley (16,127) and Mold (10,123). The east of the county is industrialised and contains the Deeside conurbation, which extends into Cheshire and has a population of 53,568. The adjacent coast is also home to industry, but further west has been developed for tourism, particularly at Talacre. Inland, the west of the county is sparsely populated and characterised by gentle hills, including part of the Clwydian Range and Dee Valley AONB.

The county is named after the historic county of the same name, which was established by the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 and has notably different borders. The county is considered part of the Welsh Marches and formed part of the historic Earldom of Chester and Flint.

==History==

Flintshire takes its name from the historic county of Flintshire, which also formed an administrative county between 1889 until 1974 when it was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972. The principal area re-established in 1996 under the Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 does not share the same boundaries and covers a smaller area.

=== Early history ===
At the time of the Roman invasion, the area of present-day Flintshire was inhabited by the Deceangli, one of the Celtic tribes in ancient Britain, with the Cornovii to the east and the Ordovices to the west. Lead and silver mine workings are evident in the area, with several sows of lead found bearing the name &#x27;DECEANGI&#x27; inscribed in Roman epigraphy. The Deceangli appear to have surrendered to Roman rule with little resistance. Following Roman Britain, and the emergence of various petty kingdoms, the region had been divided into the Hundred of Englefield (), derived from the Latin Deceangli. It became part of the Kingdom of Mercia by the 8th century AD, with much of the western boundary reinforced under Offa of Mercia after 752, but there is evidence that Offa&#x27;s Dyke is probably a much earlier construction. By the time of the Norman conquest in 1066 it was under the control of Edwin of Tegeingl, from whose Lordship the Flintshire coat of arms is derived.

Edwin&#x27;s mother is believed to have been Ethelfleda or Aldgyth, daughter of Eadwine of Mercia. At the time of the establishment of the Earldom of Chester, which succeeded the Earl of Mercia, the region formed two of the then twelve Hundreds of Cheshire of which it remained a part for several hundred years.

Flintshire today approximately resembles the boundaries of the Hundred of Atiscross as it existed at the time of the Domesday Book. Atiscross, along with the Hundred of Exestan, was transferred from the Earldom of Chester to the expanding Kingdom of Gwynedd from the west in the 13th century following numerous military campaigns. This region, as well as an exclave formed from part of the Hundred of Dudestan (known as Maelor Saesneg), later formed the main areas of Flintshire, established by the Statute of Rhuddlan in 1284 under Edward I. It was administered with the Palatinate of Chester and Flint by the Justiciar of Chester. The county was consolidated in 1536 by the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542 under the Tudor King Henry VIII, when it was incorporated into the Kingdom of England; it included the detached exclave of Welsh Maelor.

Flintshire as a separate local authority remained in existence until 1974 when it was merged with those of Denbighshire and Edeyrnion Rural District to form the administrative county of Clwyd. Clwyd was abolished 22 years later and Flintshire reorganised in its present form in 1996. However, some parts of the historic country are not included within the present administrative boundaries: significantly English Maelor was incorporated into Wrexham County Borough, and St Asaph, Prestatyn and Rhyl into Denbighshire.

=== Modern history ===
The current administrative area of Flintshire (a unitary authority and Principal area) came into existence in 1996, when the former administrative counties in Wales were split into smaller areas. The principal area was formed by the merger of the Alyn and Deeside and Delyn districts. In terms of pre-1974 divisions, the area comprises:

*the former borough of Flint
*the urban districts of Buckley, Connah&#x27;s Quay, Holywell, Mold
*the rural district of Holywell Rural District
*all of Hawarden Rural District except the parish of Marford and Hosley

The district of Rhuddlan, which was also formed entirely from the administrative county of Flintshire was included in the new Denbighshire instead. Other parts of the pre-1974 administrative Flintshire to be excluded from the principal area are the Maelor Rural District and the parish of Marford and Hoseley, which became part of the Wrexham Maelor district in 1974 and are now part of Wrexham County Borough.

==Geography==
Flintshire is a maritime county bounded to the north by the Dee estuary, to the east by Cheshire, to the west by Denbighshire and to the south by Wrexham County Borough. The coast along the Dee estuary is heavily developed by industry and the north coast much developed for tourism. The Clwydian Range occupies much of the west of the county. The highest point is Moel Famau (1,820 feet/554 metres). Notable towns include Buckley, Connah&#x27;s Quay, Flint, Hawarden, Holywell, Mold, Queensferry, and Shotton. The main rivers are the Dee (the estuary of which forms much of the coast), and the River Alyn.

===Historic buildings and structures===

==Railways==
Located on the North Wales Coast Line (Holyhead to Chester) with services run by Avanti West Coast and Transport for Wales specifically calling at Flintshire stations such as Flint and Shotton with an interchange at Shotton with the Borderlands Line, which links it and other Flintshire stations with the Liverpool area and Wrexham.

==Industry==
Parts of Flintshire have major manufacturing industries. Amongst these are an advanced Toyota plant that manufactures engines, Eren Paper, and Airbus UK, making the wings for the A320, A330 and A350 aircraft at Broughton.

There are daily flights of the Airbus BelugaXL transport aircraft of Airbus wings from Broughton.

Flintshire is also known for its internet companies, the largest and most well known being Moneysupermarket.com based in Ewloe.

Flintshire included much of the North Wales Coalfield, with the last colliery at Point of Ayr closing in 1996.

Flintshire is home to Shotwick Solar Park, currently the largest photovoltaic solar array in the UK. It was built in 2016 and covers 250 acres of the south western edge of the Wirral Peninsula near the village of Shotwick. It has a maximum generating capacity of 72.2 MW and is connected directly to the largest paper-mill in the UK, UPM Shotton Paper.

Flintshire was home to a thriving steel industry with many of the local communities and homes being built around this sector. Steelmaking came to an end in 1980 with the loss of 6500 on one day. The Shotton Steelworks site, now owned by Tata Steel, continues to produce coated steel products, mainly for the construction industry.

==Fairtrade==
On 19 November 2004, Flintshire was granted Fairtrade County status.

==Education==

Flintshire County Council is the Local Education Authority of Flintshire. It runs 72 primary schools, 2 special schools and 11 secondary schools. Six of the primary schools and one comprehensive are Welsh medium schools.

Four of the secondary schools have come together with Coleg Cambria to form the Deeside Consortium.

In December 2022, the Climate Change Committee met and Buckley Bistre West councillor Carolyn Preece recommended weekly vegan school meals in the local schools to combat climate change.

==Media==
Flintshire&#x27;s local newspapers include two daily titles, North Wales Daily Post and &quot;The Leader&quot;.

There are two radio stations broadcast in the area – Communicorp station Heart North and Mid Wales and Global Radio station Capital North West and Wales broadcast from &quot;the studios&quot; based in Wrexham. Whilst BBC Cymru Wales runs a studio and newsroom for their radio, television and online services located at Glyndŵr University but does not base their broadcasting there.

Local TV coverage is mainly served by BBC Wales and ITV Cymru Wales with BBC North West and ITV Granada can be also received. Television signals in the county are received from the Moel-y-Parc transmitter which is situated close to Caerwys, Winter Hill transmitter can also be received as well as the Storeton relay transmitter which is transmitted from both transmitters.

An online news website covering the Flintshire area, Deeside.com, operates from Deeside.

== Politics and government ==
Flintshire is represented by six members of the Senedd (Welsh Parliament). Hannah Blythyn of Welsh Labour has served as the member for the Delyn constituency since the 2016 election, and Jack Sargeant, also of Welsh Labour has served as the member for the Alyn and Deeside constituency since the 2018 by-election.

Both constituencies have continuously elected Welsh Labour MSs at every election since 1999.

A further four members representing the wider region are elected to the Welsh Parliament by proportional representation via a Closed list system, 2 from the Welsh Conservatives, 1 from Plaid Cymru, and 1 from Welsh Labour.
Flintshire has been traditionally a Labour Party stronghold, but in the 2019 general election, the Welsh Conservatives won the Delyn constituency.

The Alyn and Deeside constituency is a historically and still is a Welsh Labour Party constituency, which is represented by Mark Tami.

From 2024, Flintshire is covered by two UK parliament constituencies, Alyn and Deeside and Clwyd East, with Delyn being abolished. Both parliamentary seats are held by the Labour Party.
The Senedd uses the old set of Alyn and Deeside, and Delyn.

<doc id="359145" wikidata="Q2629608" url="?curid=359145" title="Syllabic verse">
<text>Syllabic verse is a poetic form having a fixed or constrained number of syllables per line, while stress, quantity, or tone play a distinctly secondary role—or no role at all—in the verse structure. It is common in languages that are syllable-timed, such as French or Finnish, as opposed to stress-timed languages such as English, in which accentual verse and accentual-syllabic verse are more common. 

==Overview==
Many European languages have significant syllabic verse traditions, notably Italian, Spanish, French, and the Baltic and Slavic languages. These traditions often permeate both folk and literary verse, and have evolved gradually over hundreds or thousands of years. In a sense, the metrical tradition is older than the languages themselves, since it (like the languages) descended from Proto-Indo-European.

It is often implied, incorrectly, that word stress plays no part in the syllabic prosody of these languages. While word stress in most of these languages is much less prominent than in English or German, it is present both in the language and in the meter. Very broadly speaking, syllabic meters in these languages follow the same pattern:

# Line length: The line is defined by the number of syllables it contains.
# Hemistich length: All but the shortest lines are divided into part-lines (&quot;hemistichs&quot;); each hemistich also contains a specific number of syllables, and ends with a word-boundary (this means that the hemistich cannot end in the middle of a word).
# Hemistich markers: The ends of the hemistichs are marked and contrasted by an obligatory stress: a specific syllable position near the end of each hemistich must be filled by a stressed syllable, and this position typically differs between the first and second hemistich, so that they are audibly distinct.
# Marker reinforcement: Often the syllables immediately before or after the obligatory stresses are obligatorily unstressed to further emphasize the stress.
# Other structure: Further rules may be imposed, such as additional word-boundary constraints on certain syllabic positions, or allowances for extrametrical syllables; and further interlinear structure may be present (such as rhyme and stanza).

Linguistically, the most significant exceptions to this pattern are in Latvian, Lithuanian, and Serbian verse. These verses retain the older quantitative markers using long and short syllables at the ends of hemistichs, instead of stressed and unstressed.

Due to variations in line length, hemistichs, obligatory stress positions, and other factors among verse traditions, and because each language provides words with different rhythmic characteristics, this basic metrical template is realized with great variety. A sequence of syllables that is metrical in one verse tradition will typically not fit in another.

===Perception of syllable count===

Humans can perceive the number of members in a small set without actually counting them or mentally breaking them into subsets, with the upper limit of this ability estimated between 5 and 9 units. This seems to hold true in sequences of audible stimuli (e.g. syllables in a line of verse). Therefore, it is no surprise that syllabic hemistichs tend to be very short (typically 4 to 8 syllables), and to be grouped and separated from their neighbors by markers like stress, word boundaries, and rhyme.

==English==

Syllabic verse in English is quite distinct from that in most other languages, historically, structurally, and perceptually.

Historically, English syllabics have not evolved over time from native practice, but rather are the inventions of literate poets, primarily in the 20th century. Structurally, syllable counts are not bound by tradition. Even very long lines are not divided into hemistichs, and the verse exhibits none of the markers usually found in other syllabic meters (with the occasional exception of end-rhyme), relying for their measure solely on total count of syllables in the line. Perceptually, &quot;it is very doubtful that verse lines regulated by nothing more than identity of numbers of syllables would be perceived by auditors as verse ... Further, absent the whole notion of meter as &quot;pattern&quot;, one may question whether syllabic verse is &#x27;metrical&#x27; at all.&quot; In English, the difficulty of perceiving even brief isosyllabic lines as rhythmically equivalent is aggravated by the inordinate power of stressed syllables.

In English, unstressed syllables are much weaker and shorter than stressed syllables, and their vowels are often phonetically reduced (pronounced as the rather indistinct schwa—&quot;uh&quot;—rather than fully sounded). Moreover, auditors tend to perceive word stresses to fall at equal intervals in time, making English a &quot;perceptually&quot; &quot;stress-timed&quot; language; it &quot;seems&quot; that the same amount of time occurs between stresses. So the conventional patterns of accentual and accentual-syllabic English verse are perceived as regularly rhythmic, whereas to the listener, syllabic verse generally is not distinguishable from free verse.

Thus, in English, syllabic technique does not convey a metrical rhythm. Instead, it is a compositional device primarily of importance to the author, perhaps noticed by the alert reader, and imperceptible to the hearer.

A number of English-language poets in the Modernist tradition experimented with syllabic verse. These include Marianne Moore, Dylan Thomas, Louis Zukofsky, Kenneth Rexroth and Thom Gunn. Some more traditional poets have also used syllabics, including Elizabeth Daryush and Robert Bridges. Bridges&#x27;s &quot;Testament of Beauty&quot; is the longest syllabic poem in English.

===Examples===

Dylan Thomas&#x27;s &quot;In my craft or sullen art&quot; is an example of syllabic verse in English: it has seven syllables in each line (except the last), but no consistent stress pattern.

Because of its consistent short lines marked with end-rhyme, these lines could conceivably be heard as 7-syllable groups by a listener; however, they would be more likely to be perceived as (usually) 3-stress lines.

Syllabic poetry can also take a stanzaic form, as in Marianne Moore&#x27;s poem &quot;No Swan So Fine&quot;, in which the corresponding lines of each stanza have the same number of syllables. This poem comprises 2 stanzas, each with lines of 7, 8, 6, 8, 8, 5, and 9 syllables respectively. The indented lines rhyme. As in accentual-syllabic verse, there is some flexibility in how one counts syllables. For example, syllables with y- or w-glides may count as one or two syllables depending on the poet&#x27;s preference. Moore counts &quot;Dahlias&quot; (a y-glide) as 2 syllables, and &quot;flowers&quot; (a w-glide) as 1.

Because these lines are longer, irregular, and frequently enjambed (&quot;as the / dead fountains&quot;), it is quite clear that the symmetry of syllables is not meant to be audible. Moore&#x27;s use of end-rhyme is telling. Only 2 lines in each stanza are rhymed: these are &quot;emphasized&quot; for the reader by indentation, but &quot;hidden&quot; from the listener by radical enjambment (&quot;fawn- / brown&quot; and &quot;coxcomb- / tinted&quot;).

Elizabeth Daryush, known for her use of syllabic verse, used the quaternion form for her celebrated syllabic verse poem &quot;Accentedal&quot;.

==French==

The modern French language does not have a significant stress accent (as English does). This means that the French metric line is generally determined by the number of syllables. The most common metric lengths are the ten-syllable line (), the eight-syllable line () and the twelve-syllable line ().

Special syllable counting rules apply to French poetry. A silent or mute &quot;e&quot; counts as a syllable before a consonant, but not before a vowel (where counts as a consonant). When it falls at the end of a line, the mute &quot;e&quot; is hypermetrical (outside the count of syllables).

==Polish==
Polish syllabic verse is similar to French. The most common lengths are the thirteen-syllable line ( or Polish alexandrine), the eleven-syllable line () and eight-syllable line (). The rules of Polish verse were established in the 16th century. Polish metrics were strongly influenced by Latin, Italian, and French poetry. To this day originally Italian forms (like ) are written in Poland in 11-syllable lines. Accentual verse was introduced into Polish literature at the end of 18th century but it never replaced traditional syllabic metres. Today 9-syllable lines are extremely popular. They are iambic or choriambic.

<text>Accentual verse has a fixed number of stresses per line regardless of the number of syllables that are present. It is common in languages that are stress-timed, such as English, as opposed to syllabic verse which is common in syllable-timed languages, such as French.

== Children&#x27;s poetry ==
Accentual verse is particularly common in children&#x27;s poetry; nursery rhymes and the less well-known skipping-rope rhymes are the most common form of accentual verse in the English Language. The following poem, &quot;Baa Baa Black Sheep,&quot; has two stresses in each line but a varying number of syllables. Bold represents stressed syllables, and the number of syllables in each line is noted.
&lt;poem style=&quot;margin-left: 2em&quot;&gt;
Baa, baa, black sheep, (4)
Have you any wool? (5)
Yes sir, yes sir, (4)
Three bags full; (3)
One for the mas-ter, (5)
And one for the dame, (5)
And one for the lit-tle boy (7)
Who lives down the lane. (5)
&lt;/poem&gt;

Accentual verse derives its musical qualities from its flexibility with unstressed syllables and tends to follow the natural speech patterns of English.

== History ==
=== English ===
Accentual verse was a traditionally common prosody in Germany, Scandinavia, Iceland and Britain. Accentual verse has been widespread in English poetry since its earliest recording, with Old English poetry written in a special form of accentual verse termed alliterative verse, of which &quot;Beowulf&quot; is a notable example. Anglo-Saxon poetry generally added two further basic elements to the basic four-beat accentual verse pattern: alliteration of three of the four beats, and a medial pause (caesura). Anglo-Saxon poets made frequent use of epithets to achieve the desired alliteration, and had various other more complex rules and forms, though these have not been as popular in later poetry.

Accentual verse lost its dominant position in English poetry following the Norman conquest of England when French forms, with their syllabic emphasis, gained prominence. Accentual verse continued in common use in all forms of Middle English poetry until the codification of accentual-syllabic verse in Elizabethan poetry; thereafter it largely vanished from literary poetry for three hundred years while remaining popular in folk poetry. A notable example from this period is William Langland&#x27;s &quot;Piers Ploughman,&quot; here retaining the alliteration:
:I loked on my left half || as þe lady me taughte
:And was war of a woman || worþeli ycloþed.
::I looked on my left side || as the lady me taught
::and was aware of a woman || worthily clothed.
A well-known source for accentual verse from the post-Elizabethan period is &quot;Mother Goose&#x27;s Melody&quot; (1765). Accentual verse experienced a revival in the 19th century with the development (&quot;discovery&quot;) of sprung rhythm by Gerard Manley Hopkins. Although Hopkins&#x27; example was not widely adopted in literary circles, accentual verse did catch on, with some poets flirting with the form, and later poets more strictly following it. A modern codification was given by Robert Bridges in 1921, in his &quot;Bridges&#x27; Prosody of Accentual Verse&quot; section of &quot;Milton&#x27;s Prosody.&quot; Modern literary use includes W. H. Auden, and it has notably been advanced by Dana Gioia.

Outside of children&#x27;s poetry and literary poetry, accentual verse remains popular in verse composed for oral presentation, such as cowboy poetry and rap.

==== Prosody of Accentual Verse in English ====
In modern literary use, in addition to the detailed codification given in &quot;Bridges&#x27; Prosody of Accentual Verse,&quot; three basic rules are followed:
# Four stresses per line;
# A medial pause, with two stress on each side;
# Generally, three of the four stresses alliterate.

Some variations and other subtleties are found:
* Rather than a triple alliteration in a line, having two pairs of double alliterations on either side of the pause, or only having a single double alliteration, with one alliterating stress on each side of the pause.
* Alliteration falls on the (first) &quot;stressed&quot; syllable of a word, not the first syllable of the word.
* Minor stresses are often eliminated to reduce ambiguity.
* While individual lines may have a regular syllabic structure, this is not kept constant over the poem – only the stress pattern is consistent – as otherwise the poem becomes accentual-syllabic verse.

==== Special forms ====
A number of stricter forms of accentual verse exist, including:
* Accentual-syllabic verse is an extension of accentual verse that also fixes the syllables.
* Sprung rhythm, where the stressed syllable begins the foot.

=== Polish ===
In Polish literature, as in French one, syllabic verse is dominant. Accentual verse was introduced into Polish poetry in 20th century. Jan Kasprowicz was the first poet to use accentual verse in his book &quot;Księga ubogich&quot; (&quot;The Book of the Poor&quot;) that was published in 1916. He used lines with three stresses.

:Rzadko na moich wargach -
:Niech dziś to warga ma wyzna -
:Jawi się krwią przepojony,
:Najdroższy wyraz: Ojczyzna. 
::(Jan Kasprowicz, Rzadko na moich wargach)

The poet wrote, that the word dearest to him, &quot;mother-country&quot;, is on his lips very rarely. The scansion is:

:&#x27; x x &#x27; x &#x27; x
:x &#x27; x &#x27; x x &#x27; x
:&#x27; x x &#x27; x x &#x27; x 
:x &#x27; x &#x27; x x &#x27; x

This pattern became the most popular. There is also six-stress pattern. This was used among others by Julian Tuwim.

<text>A dosa (known locally as dosey, dosaë, dosai, dosha, dose, or dhosa) is a thin, savoury crepe in Indian cuisine made from a fermented batter of ground black gram and rice. Dosas are served hot, often with chutney and sambar (a lentil-based vegetable stew).

==History==
The dosa originated in South India, but its precise geographical origins are unknown. According to food historian K. T. Achaya, references in the Sangam literature suggest that dosa was already in use in the ancient Tamil country around the first century CE. However, according to historian P. Thankappan Nair, dosa originated in the town of Udupi in Karnataka. Achaya states that the earliest written mention of dosa appears in the eighth-century literature of present-day Tamil Nadu, while the earliest mention of dosaë in Tulu literature appears a century later.

In popular tradition outside of Southern India, the origin of the dosa is linked to Udupi, probably because of the dish&#x27;s association with Udupi restaurants. The Tamil dosa is traditionally softer and thicker; the thinner and crispier version of dosa was first made in present-day Karnataka. A recipe for dosa can be found in &quot;Manasollasa&quot;, a 12th-century Sanskrit encyclopedia compiled by Someshvara III, who ruled from present-day Karnataka.

The dosa arrived in Mumbai with the opening of Udupi restaurants in the 1930s. After India&#x27;s independence in 1947, South Indian cuisine became gradually popular in North India. In New Delhi, the Madras Hotel in Connaught Place became one of the first restaurants to serve South Indian cuisine.

Dosas, like many other dishes of South Indian cuisine, were introduced in Ceylon (Sri Lanka) by South Indian emigrants during British rule. Tirunelveli and Tuticorin merchants who settled there were instrumental in the spreading of South Indian cookery across the island by opening restaurants (vegetarian &quot;hotels&quot;) to meet initially the needs of the emigrant population. Dosa has found its way into the culinary habits of the Sri Lankan people, where it has evolved into an island-specific version which is quite distinct from the Indian dosa. In both forms, it is called &quot;those&quot; ( or ) or &quot;thosai&quot; ( or ) in Sinhala and in Sri Lankan Tamil.

As in Sri Lanka, dosa was introduced far abroad since the early 18th century, by the migration of the Indian Tamil diaspora to Southeast Asia and later in the Western World, and through the worldwide popularisation of Indian and South Indian cuisines since the second half of the 20th century.

== Names ==
Dosa is the anglicised name of a variety of South Indian names for the dish, for example, &quot;dosai&quot; in Tamil, &quot;dōsaë&quot; in Tulu, and &quot;dosha&quot; in Malayalam.

The standard transliterations and pronunciations of the word in various South Indian languages are:

==Nutrition==
Dosa is high in carbohydrates and contains no added sugars. As its key ingredients are rice and black gram, it is a good source of protein. A typical homemade plain dosa without oil contains about 112 calories, of which 84% is carbohydrate and 16% is protein. The fermentation process increases the vitamin B and vitamin C content.

== Preparation ==
A mixture of rice and white gram that has been soaked in water for at least 4–5 hours is ground finely to form a batter. Some add a bit of soaked fenugreek seeds while grinding the batter. The proportion of rice to lentils is generally 3:1 or 4:1. After adding salt, the batter is allowed to ferment overnight, before being mixed with water to get the desired consistency. The batter is then ladled onto a hot &quot;tava&quot; or griddle greased with oil or &quot;ghee&quot;. It is spread out with the base of a ladle or a bowl to form a pancake. It can be made either thick like a pancake, or thin and crispy. A dosa is served hot, either folded in half or rolled like a wrap. It is usually served with chutney and sambar. The mixture of white grams and rice can be replaced with highly refined wheat flour or semolina.

==Serving==
Dosas can be stuffed with fillings of vegetables and sauces to make a quick meal. They are typically served with a vegetarian side dish, which varies according to regional and personal preferences. Common side items are:

* Sambar
* Chutney
* Idli podi or &quot;milagaipodi&quot;: A lentil powder with spices and sometimes desiccated coconut, mixed with sesame oil or groundnut oil or ghee
* Indian pickles

==Variations==
Masala dosa is a roasted dosa served with potato curry, chutney, and sambar, while saada (plain) dosa is prepared with a lighter texture; paper dosa is a thin and crisp version. Rava dosa is made crispier using semolina. Newer versions include Chinese dosa, cheese dosa, paneer dosa, and pizza dosa.

Though dosa is typically made with rice and lentils, other versions exist.

==World record==

On 16 November 2014, 29 chefs, at Hotel Daspalla in Hyderabad, India, created a dosa that was long and weighed , earning the Guinness World Record for the longest dosa.

==In popular culture==
* In a November 2019 video promoting her campaign for presidency, United States Vice President Kamala Harris cooked masala dosa with actress and comedian Mindy Kaling.
* Venba is a 2023 cooking video game that features dosa as one of the dishes .

<doc id="359148" wikidata="Q321886" url="?curid=359148" title="Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton">
<text>The Treaty of Edinburgh–Northampton was a peace treaty signed in 1328 between the Kingdoms of England and Scotland.

It brought an end to the First War of Scottish Independence, which had begun with the English invasion of Scotland in 1296. The treaty was signed in Edinburgh by Robert the Bruce, King of Scots, on 17 March 1328, and was ratified by the Parliament of England meeting in Northampton on 1 May.

The terms of the treaty stipulated that in exchange for £20,000 sterling, the English Crown would recognise:

* The Kingdom of Scotland as fully independent;
* Robert the Bruce, and his heirs and successors, as the rightful rulers of Scotland;
* The border between Scotland and England as that recognised under the reign of Alexander III (1249–1286).

One of two copies of the document, which was written in French, is held by the National Archives of Scotland in Edinburgh. However, the document does not constitute the entire peace treaty, which was contained in a number of indentures, notarial instruments and letters patent issued by Edward III and Robert I. Since none of them survives, not all details of the peace treaty are known.

==The War==

The cause of the Wars of Scottish Independence was ultimately the uncertainty over the succession of the Scottish crown following the death of Alexander III in 1286. Edward I of England initially supported the claim of John Balliol, who was crowned King of Scots in 1292, but eventually pressed his own claim to sovereignty over Scotland. After Balliol&#x27;s removal and exile, Robert the Bruce broke from the English camp and took up his own rival claim to the crown, by leading a resistance to Edward. Robert declared himself King, after killing his chief rival and cousin, and was crowned in 1306. He decisively defeated the English, under Edward II, at Bannockburn in 1314.

Peace talks were held between 1321 and 1324. Little progress was made, as the English refused to recognise Robert the Bruce as King of Scots, although a truce was agreed in 1323, to last thirteen years. Edward II claimed he adhered to this truce, but he allowed English privateers to attack Flemish vessels trading with Scotland. For example, privateers seized the Flemish vessel &quot;Pelarym&quot;, worth £2,000, and massacred all the Scots on board. Robert the Bruce demanded justice, but in vain, and so he renewed the Auld Alliance between Scotland and France, which was concluded on 26 April 1326 by the Treaty of Corbeil, which was sealed at Corbeil in France. In 1327, the Scots invaded northern England and defeated the English at the Battle of Stanhope Park in Weardale in County Durham. Before this, Bruce invaded Ulster in Ireland.

==Negotiations==
After the debacle of the Weardale campaign, the Dowager Queen Isabella, and Earl Mortimer of March, governing England on behalf of the underage Edward III of England, began to consider peace as the only remaining option. In October 1327 they sent envoys to Scotland to open negotiations. On 1 March 1328, at a Parliament at York, Edward III issued letters patent which set out the core of the agreement. On 17 March, the negotiations ended and a formal treaty was signed in the King&#x27;s Chamber of the Abbey of Holyrood, Edinburgh. The Treaty was ratified by the English Parliament at Northampton on 3 May.

==Terms==
Isabella and Mortimer agreed in the treaty that they, in the name of the minor, King Edward III, renounced all pretensions to sovereignty over Scotland. Joanna, the six-year-old sister of Edward III, was promised in marriage to the four-year-old David, the son of Robert Bruce, and the marriage duly took place on 17 July the same year. In the quitclaim of Edward III of 1 March 1328 preceding the treaty, Edward endorsed that the Anglo–Scottish border would be maintained as it was in the reign of Alexander III of Scotland and that Scotland, so defined, &quot;shall belong to our dearest ally and friend, the magnificent prince, Lord Robert, by God&#x27;s grace illustrious King of Scotland, and to his heirs and successors, separate in all things from the kingdom of England, whole, free, and undisturbed in perpetuity, without any kind of subjection, service, claim or demand.&quot; In return, the Scots would pay £20,000 sterling to England – with a potential further £100,000 to be paid if the marriage between David and Joan failed.

As part of the treaty negotiations, Edward III agreed to return the Stone of Destiny to Scotland. This was not in the treaty, but was part of a concurrent agreement. Edward III issued a royal writ, 4 months later, on 1 July, addressed to the Abbot of Westminster, which acknowledged this agreement and ordered the Stone be taken to his mother, but it was not. This has been questioned by historian Colm McNamee, however, who writes that &quot;the stone of Scone was to be returned to Scotland according to one report, but there is no evidence this was agreed&quot;. Eventually, 668 years later, it was returned to Scotland, arriving on 30 November 1996 at Edinburgh Castle, with the agreement that the stone is to be transported to England for use in subsequent coronations of United Kingdom monarchs. In September 2022, the BBC confirmed that this would be done for the coronation of Charles III.

==Effects==
The treaty lasted only five years. It was unpopular with many English nobles who viewed it as humiliating – referring to it as the &quot;Shameful Peace&quot;. As such, in 1333 it was overturned by Edward III, after he had begun his personal reign, and the Second War of Scottish Independence continued until a lasting peace was effectively established in 1357.

==The Original==
The original treaty was written in French, with two copies made, top and bottom, on a single sheet (a chirograph or indenture). After the English and Scottish ambassadors verified that the copies were the same, it was cut in half across the middle with a wavy line, so that the two copies could be matched together if ever questioned. The kings did not actually sign the treaty, but signified their agreement by affixing their seals to straps that hang from the bottom of the document. (These wax seals have not survived the years, and are lost from the straps.) The bottom copy of the two originals is in the National Archives of Scotland, in Edinburgh. However, it should be remembered that this document does not constitute the entire peace treaty, which was contained in a number of indentures, notorial instruments and letters patents issued by Edward III and Robert I. All of these documents do not survive, which is why all the details of the peace treaty are not known.

==Translations==
One partial translation of the treaty comes from the Scottish Archives for Schools:

&quot;&quot;Be it known to all those who shall see these letters that on the seventeenth day of March...the following matters were discussed and agreed...between the most excellent Prince, Robert, by the Grace of God, king of Scotland and...the most excellent prince, Edward, by the Grace of God king of England.&quot;

&quot;Firstly that there be a true, final and perpetual peace between the kings, their heirs and successors and their realms and lands and their subjects and peoples...and for the security and permanence of that peace it is settled and agreed that a marriage take place...between David the son and heir of the king of Scotland and Joan, the sister of the king of England, who as yet are of so tender an age that they cannot make contract of matrimony...&quot;

&quot;Item it is treated and accorded that the said kings, their heirs and successors, shall be good friends and loyal allies, and that the one shall aid the other in suitable manner as good allies: saving on the part of the king of Scotland the alliance made between him and the king of France. But if it happen that the king of Scotland...by reason of the said alliance or for any cause whatever make war upon the said king of England...that the said king of England may make war on the foresaid king of Scotland...&quot;

&quot;Item...that the said king of England shall assist in good faith that the processes, if any are made in the court of Rome and elsewhere by the authority of our Holy Father the Pope against the said king of Scotland, his realm and his subjects, cleric or lay, be dismissed, and this to do and accomplish he shall send his special letters of prayer to the pope and the cardinals&quot;.&quot;

The translation was found in &quot;A Source Book of Scottish History&quot; by William Dickinson.

<text>William MacGillivray FRSE (25 January 1796 – 4 September 1852) was a Scottish naturalist and ornithologist.

==Life and work==

MacGillivray was born in Old Aberdeen and brought up on Harris. He returned to Aberdeen where he studied Medicine at King&#x27;s College, graduating MA in 1815. In Old Aberdeen he lived at 107 High Street.

He then became an assistant Dissector in the Anatomy classes. In 1823 he became assistant to Robert Jameson, the Regius Professor of Natural History at the University of Edinburgh. He was curator of the museum of the Royal College of Surgeons of Edinburgh from 1831, resigning in 1841 to become Regius Professor of Natural History at Marischal College, Aberdeen.

MacGillivray was a friend of American bird expert John James Audubon, and wrote a large part of Audubon&#x27;s &quot;Ornithological Biographies&quot; from 1830 to 1839. Audubon named MacGillivray&#x27;s warbler for him.

He died at 67 Crown Street in Aberdeen on 5 September 1852 but is buried in New Calton Cemetery in Edinburgh.
The grave faces east onto the eastern path.

==Family==

In 1820 he married Marion Askill from Harris. The couple had 10 children, two of whom died in infancy.

Two of MacGillivray&#x27;s sons achieved recognition as naturalists. His eldest son, John MacGillivray (1822–1867), published an account of the voyage round the world of HMS &quot;Rattlesnake&quot;, to which he was the onboard naturalist. Another son, Paul, published an &quot;Aberdeen Flora&quot; in 1853, and donated 214 of his father&#x27;s paintings to the Natural History Museum.

==Legacy==

A detailed version of MacGillivray&#x27;s life, written by a namesake, was published 49 years after the ornithologist&#x27;s death.

MacGillivray correctly distinguished between the hooded crow and carrion crow, but they were considered only to be subspecies for the next one and a half centuries until, in 2002, on DNA evidence, the hooded crow was awarded species status.

==Works==
MacGillivray&#x27;s works include:

*&quot;Lives of Eminent Zoologists from Aristotle to Linnaeus&quot; (1830)
*&quot;A Systematic Arrangement of British Plants&quot; (1830)
*&quot;The Travels and Researches of Alexander von Humboldt.&quot; (1832)
*&quot;A History of British Quadrupeds&quot; (1838)
*&quot;A Manual of Botany, Comprising Vegetable Anatomy and Physiology&quot; (1840)
*&quot;A History of the Molluscous Animals of Aberdeen, Banff and Kincardine&quot; (1843)
*&quot;A Manual of British Ornithology&quot; (1840–1842)
*&quot;A History of British Birds, indigenous and migratory&quot;, in five volumes (1837–1852)
*&quot;Natural History of Deeside and Braemar&quot; (1855), published posthumously
*&quot;A Hebridean Naturalist&#x27;s Journal 1817-1818&quot; (1996), published posthumously
*&quot;A Walk to London&quot; (1998), published posthumously

MacGillivray illustrated Henry Witham&#x27;s 1833 &quot;The Internal Structure of Fossil Vegetables found in the Carboniferous and Oolitic deposits of Great Britain&quot;, and edited &quot;The Conchologist&#x27;s Text-Book&quot; through several editions.

<text>Legio III Parthica (&quot;Parthian-conquering Third Legion&quot;) was a legion of the Imperial Roman army founded in AD 197 by the emperor Septimius Severus (r. 193–211) for his campaign against the Parthian Empire, hence the cognomen &quot;Parthica&quot;. The legion was still active in the Eastern provinces in the early 5th century. The legion&#x27;s symbol was probably a bull.

== Foundation ==

Together with its sister legions I &quot;Parthica&quot; and II &quot;Parthica&quot;, the third Parthian legion was levied for the attack on the eastern frontier. The campaign was a success and Ctesiphon, the Parthian capital, was taken and sacked. III &quot;Parthica&quot; remained in the region afterwards, garrisoning the new province of Mesopotamia. Their main base camp was Rhesaena, where they had the duty of securing the main roads and protect the province against the Sassanids.

== Against the Sassanids ==

During the 3rd century, III &quot;Parthica&quot; took part in several other campaigns against the Sassanids; even if there are few direct proofs of its involvement, III &quot;Parthica&quot; was stationed in the region and was obviously employed in the wars between the two rival empires.

A first indecisive campaign was led by Emperor Caracalla in 217, during which he was assassinated.

In 230, the Sassanids invaded the Roman province, defeating the Third. The Emperor Alexander Severus then organized a successful campaign to restore Roman rule over Mesopotamia.

Emperor Gordian III organized another campaign in 243, and the Third won the Battle of Resaena, but in the following year Gordian died during the campaign, and his successor Philip the Arab, whose position had been confirmed by Shapur I, retreated.
The Sassanids marked a major victory in 256, when they defeated the XV &quot;Apollinaris&quot; and conquered its fortress, Satala, sacking Trapezus in 258. Emperor Valerian tried to recover the lost territories, but was defeated and taken prisoner (260). The Romans successfully challenged the Sassanid rule, first with Odaenathus (261-267), leader of a secessionist Palmyrene Empire, and later with Emperor Diocletian (284-305), who signed a treaty of peace in 298 that marked the return of Northern Mesopotamia under Roman influence.

In the early 5th century, the legion was probably still active in the region under the &quot;Dux Osrhoenae&quot;, based in Apatna, modern Tell Fdyin, Iraq (Notitia dignitatum is corrupted, but shows that a legion is quartered in Apatna, and the III &quot;Parthica&quot; is not mentioned anywhere else).

<doc id="359169" wikidata="Q1568194" url="?curid=359169" title="Lucas primality test">
<text>In computational number theory, the Lucas test is a primality test for a natural number &quot;n&quot;; it requires that the prime factors of &quot;n&quot; − 1 be already known. It is the basis of the Pratt certificate that gives a concise verification that &quot;n&quot; is prime.

==Concepts==
Let &quot;n&quot; be a positive integer. If there exists an integer &quot;a&quot;, 1 &lt; &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;, such that

:formula_1

and for every prime factor &quot;q&quot; of &quot;n&quot; − 1

:formula_2

then &quot;n&quot; is prime. If no such number &quot;a&quot; exists, then &quot;n&quot; is either 1, 2, or composite.

The reason for the correctness of this claim is as follows: if the first equivalence holds for &quot;a&quot;, we can deduce that &quot;a&quot; and &quot;n&quot; are coprime. If &quot;a&quot; also survives the second step, then the order of &quot;a&quot; in the group (Z/&quot;nZ)* is equal to &quot;n&quot;−1, which means that the order of that group is &quot;n&quot;−1 (because the order of every element of a group divides the order of the group), implying that &quot;n&quot; is prime. Conversely, if &quot;n&quot; is prime, then there exists a primitive root modulo &quot;n&quot;, or generator of the group (Z/&quot;nZ)*. Such a generator has order |(Z/&quot;n&quot;Z)*| = &quot;n&quot;−1 and both equivalences will hold for any such primitive root.

Note that if there exists an &quot;a&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot; such that the first equivalence fails, &quot;a&quot; is called a Fermat witness for the compositeness of &quot;n&quot;.

==Example==
For example, take &quot;n&quot; = 71. Then &quot;n&quot; − 1 = 70 and the prime factors of 70 are 2, 5 and 7.
We randomly select an &quot;a=17&quot; &lt; &quot;n&quot;. Now we compute:

:formula_3

For all integers &quot;a&quot; it is known that

:formula_4

Therefore, the multiplicative order of 17 (mod 71) is not necessarily 70 because some factor of 70 may also work above. So check 70 divided by its prime factors:

:formula_5

:formula_6

:formula_7

Unfortunately, we get that 1710≡1 (mod 71). So we still don&#x27;t know if 71 is prime or not.

We try another random &quot;a&quot;, this time choosing &quot;a&quot; = 11. Now we compute:

:formula_8

Again, this does not show that the multiplicative order of 11 (mod 71) is 70 because some factor of 70 may also work. So check 70 divided by its prime factors:

:formula_9

:formula_10

:formula_11

So the multiplicative order of 11 (mod 71) is 70, and thus 71 is prime.

(To carry out these modular exponentiations, one could use a fast exponentiation algorithm like binary or addition-chain exponentiation).

==Algorithm==
The algorithm can be written in pseudocode as follows:

 algorithm lucas_primality_test is
 input: &quot;n&quot; &gt; 2, an odd integer to be tested for primality.
 &quot;k&quot;, a parameter that determines the accuracy of the test.
 output: &quot;prime&quot; if &quot;n&quot; is prime, otherwise &quot;composite&quot; or &quot;possibly composite&quot;.
 determine the prime factors of &quot;n&quot;−1.
 LOOP1: repeat &quot;k&quot; times:
 pick &quot;a&quot; randomly in the range [2, &quot;n&quot; − 1]
 return &quot;composite&quot;
 else 
 LOOP2: for all prime factors &quot;q&quot; of &quot;n&quot;−1:
 if we checked this equality for all prime factors of &quot;n&quot;−1 then
 return &quot;prime&quot;
 else
 continue LOOP2
 else 
 continue LOOP1
 return &quot;possibly composite&quot;.

<text>Archibald Dalzel ( – ) was a British colonial administrator and slave trader who served as the governor of the Gold Coast from 1792 to 1802. Between 1804 and 1808, he owned two slave ships. Dalzel died in 1818.

==Life==

Dalzel was born in Kirkliston, Scotland and he trained to be a doctor in Edinburgh. After a spell in the Royal Navy he resolved to take a job in Africa as he saw it as a way to make money. He went to Africa as a surgeon in 1763 but started trading slaves to add to his salary. He served four years as governor of Whydah (now Ouidah, Benin). He observed that the people at Whydah &quot;pay a kind of veneration to a particular species of large snake, which is very gentle.&quot; Dalzal returned to England in 1770.

Appointed by the Committee of Merchants that was in charge of the Gold Coast at the time, he served as governor in two periods: 31 March 1792 - 16 December 1798, and 28 April 1800 - 30 September 1802. Whilst he was there his daughter Elizabeth Dickson was born.

In 1793 he published &quot;The history of Dahomy, an inland kingdom of Africa; comp. from authentic memoirs; with an introduction and notes&quot; where he argued that the raiding of Dahomean villages for slaves was saving them from the greater evil of being human sacrifices.

==Shipowner==

In 1775 he purchased the schooner &quot;Nancy&quot;, of 60 tons (bm). On 19 September 1775, he sailed to Africa. At some point he purchased &quot;Hannah&quot; to act as a ship&#x27;s tender for &quot;Nancy&quot;. As of February 2023 it is not clear about what happened to either vessel. In 1804 Dalzel purchased the slave ship . She made two slave-trading voyages while under his ownership. In all she delivered 486 captives to the West Indies. After the passage of the Slave Trade Act 1807, which ended British participation in the Atlantic slave trade, Dalzel sold her. In 1805, Dalzel purchased a second slave ship, . She made one complete voyage. She was wrecked in 1808 on her second slave-trading voyage; the crew and enslaved captives were saved.

==Family==
Son of William Dalziel (1705–1751) a carpenter from Kirkliston and Alice Linn. Brother of Andrew Dalzel (1742–1806), Professor of Greek, Honorary Librarian at Edinburgh University.

<text>In algebraic geometry, a branch of mathematics, Serre duality is a duality for the coherent sheaf cohomology of algebraic varieties, proved by Jean-Pierre Serre. The basic version applies to vector bundles on a smooth projective variety, but Alexander Grothendieck found wide generalizations, for example to singular varieties. On an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional variety, the theorem says that a cohomology group formula_1 is the dual space of another one, formula_2. Serre duality is the analog for coherent sheaf cohomology of Poincaré duality in topology, with the canonical line bundle replacing the orientation sheaf.

The Serre duality theorem is also true in complex geometry more generally, for compact complex manifolds that are not necessarily projective complex algebraic varieties. In this setting, the Serre duality theorem is an application of Hodge theory for Dolbeault cohomology, and may be seen as a result in the theory of elliptic operators.

These two different interpretations of Serre duality coincide for non-singular projective complex algebraic varieties, by an application of Dolbeault&#x27;s theorem relating sheaf cohomology to Dolbeault cohomology.

==Serre duality for vector bundles==

===Algebraic theorem===
Let &quot;X&quot; be a smooth variety of dimension &quot;n&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot;. Define the canonical line bundle formula_3 to be the bundle of &quot;n&quot;-forms on &quot;X&quot;, the top exterior power of the cotangent bundle:
:formula_4
Suppose in addition that &quot;X&quot; is proper (for example, projective) over &quot;k&quot;. Then Serre duality says: for an algebraic vector bundle &quot;E&quot; on &quot;X&quot; and an integer &quot;i&quot;, there is a natural isomorphism:
:formula_5
of finite-dimensional &quot;k&quot;-vector spaces. Here formula_6 denotes the tensor product of vector bundles. It follows that the dimensions of the two cohomology groups are equal:
:formula_7
As in Poincaré duality, the isomorphism in Serre duality comes from the cup product in sheaf cohomology. Namely, the composition of the cup product with a natural trace map on formula_8 is a perfect pairing:
:formula_9
The trace map is the analog for coherent sheaf cohomology of integration in de Rham cohomology.

===Differential-geometric theorem===
Serre also proved the same duality statement for &quot;X&quot; a compact complex manifold and &quot;E&quot; a holomorphic vector bundle.
Here, the Serre duality theorem is a consequence of Hodge theory. Namely, on a compact complex manifold formula_10 equipped with a Riemannian metric, there is a Hodge star operator:

:formula_11

where formula_12. Additionally, since formula_10 is complex, there is a splitting of the complex differential forms into forms of type formula_14. The Hodge star operator (extended complex-linearly to complex-valued differential forms) interacts with this grading as:

:formula_15

Notice that the holomorphic and anti-holomorphic indices have switched places. There is a conjugation on complex differential forms which interchanges forms of type formula_14 and formula_17, and if one defines the conjugate-linear Hodge star operator by formula_18 then we have:

:formula_19
Using the conjugate-linear Hodge star, one may define a Hermitian formula_20-inner product on complex differential forms, by:
:formula_21

where now formula_22 is an formula_23-form, and in particular a complex-valued formula_24-form and can therefore be integrated on formula_10 with respect to its canonical orientation. Furthermore, suppose formula_26 is a Hermitian holomorphic vector bundle. Then the Hermitian metric formula_27 gives a conjugate-linear isomorphism formula_28 between formula_29 and its dual vector bundle, say formula_30. Defining formula_31, one obtains an isomorphism:

:formula_32

where formula_33 consists of smooth formula_29-valued complex differential forms. Using the pairing between formula_29 and formula_36 given by formula_37 and formula_27, one can therefore define a Hermitian formula_20-inner product on such formula_29-valued forms by:
:formula_41

where here formula_42 means wedge product of differential forms and using the pairing between formula_29 and formula_36 given by formula_27.

The Hodge theorem for Dolbeault cohomology asserts that if we define:

:formula_46

where formula_47 is the Dolbeault operator of formula_29 and formula_49 is its formal adjoint with respect to the inner product, then:
:formula_50

On the left is Dolbeault cohomology, and on the right is the vector space of harmonic formula_29-valued differential forms defined by:

:formula_52
Using this description, the Serre duality theorem can be stated as follows: The isomorphism formula_53 induces a complex linear isomorphism:

:formula_54

This can be easily proved using the Hodge theory above. Namely, if formula_55 is a cohomology class in formula_56 with unique harmonic representative formula_57, then:

:formula_58

with equality if and only if formula_59. In particular, the complex linear pairing:

:formula_60

between formula_61 and formula_62 is non-degenerate, and induces the isomorphism in the Serre duality theorem.

The statement of Serre duality in the algebraic setting may be recovered by taking formula_63, and applying Dolbeault&#x27;s theorem, which states that:

:formula_64

where on the left is Dolbeault cohomology and on the right sheaf cohomology, where formula_65 denotes the sheaf of holomorphic formula_66-forms. In particular, we obtain:

:formula_67

where we have used that the sheaf of holomorphic formula_68-forms is just the canonical bundle of formula_10.

==Algebraic curves==
A fundamental application of Serre duality is to algebraic curves. (Over the complex numbers, it is equivalent to consider compact Riemann surfaces.) For a line bundle &quot;L&quot; on a smooth projective curve &quot;X&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot;, the only possibly nonzero cohomology groups are formula_70 and formula_71. Serre duality describes the formula_72 group in terms of an formula_73 group (for a different line bundle). That is more concrete, since formula_73 of a line bundle is simply its space of sections.

Serre duality is especially relevant to the Riemann–Roch theorem for curves. For a line bundle &quot;L&quot; of degree &quot;d&quot; on a curve &quot;X&quot; of genus &quot;g&quot;, the Riemann–Roch theorem says that:
:formula_75
Using Serre duality, this can be restated in more elementary terms:
:formula_76
The latter statement (expressed in terms of divisors) is in fact the original version of the theorem from the 19th century. This is the main tool used to analyze how a given curve can be embedded into projective space and hence to classify algebraic curves.

Example: Every global section of a line bundle of negative degree is zero. Moreover, the degree of the canonical bundle is formula_77. Therefore, Riemann–Roch implies that for a line bundle &quot;L&quot; of degree formula_78, formula_79 is equal to formula_80. When the genus &quot;g&quot; is at least 2, it follows by Serre duality that formula_81. Here formula_82 is the first-order deformation space of &quot;X&quot;. This is the basic calculation needed to show that the moduli space of curves of genus &quot;g&quot; has dimension formula_83.

==Serre duality for coherent sheaves==
Another formulation of Serre duality holds for all coherent sheaves, not just vector bundles. As a first step in generalizing Serre duality, Grothendieck showed that this version works for schemes with mild singularities, Cohen–Macaulay schemes, not just smooth schemes.

Namely, for a Cohen–Macaulay scheme &quot;X&quot; of pure dimension &quot;n&quot; over a field &quot;k&quot;, Grothendieck defined a coherent sheaf formula_84 on &quot;X&quot; called the dualizing sheaf. (Some authors call this sheaf formula_3.) Suppose in addition that &quot;X&quot; is proper over &quot;k&quot;. For a coherent sheaf &quot;E&quot; on &quot;X&quot; and an integer &quot;i&quot;, Serre duality says that there is a natural isomorphism:
:formula_86
of finite-dimensional &quot;k&quot;-vector spaces. Here the Ext group is taken in the abelian category of formula_87-modules. This includes the previous statement, since formula_88 is isomorphic to formula_89 when &quot;E&quot; is a vector bundle.

In order to use this result, one has to determine the dualizing sheaf explicitly, at least in special cases. When &quot;X&quot; is smooth over &quot;k&quot;, formula_84 is the canonical line bundle formula_3 defined above. More generally, if &quot;X&quot; is a Cohen–Macaulay subscheme of codimension &quot;r&quot; in a smooth scheme &quot;Y&quot; over &quot;k&quot;, then the dualizing sheaf can be described as an Ext sheaf:
:formula_92
When &quot;X&quot; is a local complete intersection of codimension &quot;r&quot; in a smooth scheme &quot;Y&quot;, there is a more elementary description: the normal bundle of &quot;X&quot; in &quot;Y&quot; is a vector bundle of rank &quot;r&quot;, and the dualizing sheaf of &quot;X&quot; is given by:
:formula_93
In this case, &quot;X&quot; is a Cohen–Macaulay scheme with formula_84 a line bundle, which says that &quot;X&quot; is Gorenstein.

Example: Let &quot;X&quot; be a complete intersection in projective space formula_95 over a field &quot;k&quot;, defined by homogeneous polynomials formula_96 of degrees formula_97. (To say that this is a complete intersection means that &quot;X&quot; has dimension formula_98.) There are line bundles &quot;O&quot;(&quot;d&quot;) on formula_95 for integers &quot;d&quot;, with the property that homogeneous polynomials of degree &quot;d&quot; can be viewed as sections of &quot;O&quot;(&quot;d&quot;). Then the dualizing sheaf of &quot;X&quot; is the line bundle:
:formula_100

by the adjunction formula. For example, the dualizing sheaf of a plane curve &quot;X&quot; of degree &quot;d&quot; is formula_101.

=== Complex moduli of Calabi–Yau threefolds ===
In particular, we can compute the number of complex deformations, equal to formula_102 for a quintic threefold in formula_103, a Calabi–Yau variety, using Serre duality. Since the Calabi–Yau property ensures formula_104 Serre duality shows us that formula_105 showing the number of complex moduli is equal to formula_106 in the Hodge diamond. Of course, the last statement depends on the Bogomolev–Tian–Todorov theorem which states every deformation on a Calabi–Yau is unobstructed.

==Grothendieck duality==

Grothendieck&#x27;s theory of coherent duality is a broad generalization of Serre duality, using the language of derived categories. For any scheme &quot;X&quot; of finite type over a field &quot;k&quot;, there is an object formula_107 of the bounded derived category of coherent sheaves on &quot;X&quot;, formula_108, called the dualizing complex of &quot;X&quot; over &quot;k&quot;. Formally, formula_107 is the exceptional inverse image formula_110, where &quot;f&quot; is the given morphism formula_111. When &quot;X&quot; is Cohen–Macaulay of pure dimension &quot;n&quot;, formula_107 is formula_113; that is, it is the dualizing sheaf discussed above, viewed as a complex in (cohomological) degree −&quot;n&quot;. In particular, when &quot;X&quot; is smooth over &quot;k&quot;, formula_107 is the canonical line bundle placed in degree −&quot;n&quot;.

Using the dualizing complex, Serre duality generalizes to any proper scheme &quot;X&quot; over &quot;k&quot;. Namely, there is a natural isomorphism of finite-dimensional &quot;k&quot;-vector spaces:
:formula_115
for any object &quot;E&quot; in formula_108.

More generally, for a proper scheme &quot;X&quot; over &quot;k&quot;, an object &quot;E&quot; in formula_108, and &quot;F&quot; a perfect complex in formula_118, one has the elegant statement: 
:formula_119
Here the tensor product means the derived tensor product, as is natural in derived categories. (To compare with previous formulations, note that formula_88 can be viewed as formula_121.) When &quot;X&quot; is also smooth over &quot;k&quot;, every object in formula_108 is a perfect complex, and so this duality applies to all &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; in formula_108. The statement above is then summarized by saying that formula_124 is a Serre functor on formula_108 for &quot;X&quot; smooth and proper over &quot;k&quot;.

Serre duality holds more generally for proper algebraic spaces over a field.

His 1997 album &quot;Substrata&quot; was voted by the users of the Hyperreal.org website in 2001 as the best all-time classic ambient album. He has also composed several film scores.

==History==

===Prior to Biosphere (1962–1991)===
Jenssen was born on 30 May 1962 in Tromsø, a city within the Arctic Circle in the northernmost portion of Norway. He was inspired by the music of artists such as New Order, Depeche Mode, Wire, and Brian Eno, which he described as &quot;like discovering a new universe—a universe which I wanted to be a part of&quot;. In 1983, he bought his first synthesizer and composed his first piece of music, taking influence from his archaeological studies, later stating &quot;Studying the Ice Age and Stone Age has definitely influenced my music.&quot; In 1984 Jenssen issued his first album, &quot;E-Man&quot;, released on cassette only on the Norwegian indie label Likvider and credited to E-man.

In 1985, Jenssen was part of the newly created Norwegian moody synth trio Bel Canto with Nils Johansen and singer Anneli Drecker. The band signed with Belgian label Crammed Discs and to Nettwerk in North America, and relocated to Brussels. Jenssen, however, soon returned to Tromsø, collaborating with the other band members by post, and continuing with his solo work. Bel Canto released two albums while Jenssen was a member, &quot;White-Out Conditions&quot; and &quot;Birds of Passage&quot;. In 1990, he left the band in order to pursue a different music style altogether, and began using a sampler.

Throughout the late 1980s, Jenssen used the moniker Bleep, under which he produced various 12&quot; records, now releasing records via the Crammed Discs subsidiary SSR. His early influences were from acid house and New Beat music. Released in 1990, &quot;The North Pole by Submarine&quot; was the only album recorded as Bleep. Further singles followed in 1990 and 1991 before Jenssen abandoned the Bleep moniker and again changed musical direction.

===As Biosphere (1991–present)===
Following the release of &quot;The North Pole by Submarine&quot;, Jenssen began releasing his music as Biosphere on obscure Norwegian compilation albums. His first Biosphere releases were the 12-inch single &quot;The Fairy Tale&quot; and the album &quot;Microgravity&quot;, both of which were rejected by SSR as unmarketable. &quot;Microgravity&quot; was released in 1991 on the Norwegian label Origo Sound, and saw wider release via the R&amp;S Records subsidiary Apollo in 1992, to much critical acclaim. In 1992, Jenssen contributed &quot;I&#x27;ll Strangle You&quot; to Hector Zazou&#x27;s &quot;Sahara Blue&quot; project. In 1993, Jenssen collaborated with German ambient musician Pete Namlook on The Fires of Ork.

In 1994, the second Biosphere album, &quot;Patashnik&quot; was released, through which Jenssen continued to explore his ambient-house stylings to an even greater extent, employing the theme of a lost cosmonaut drifting aimlessly through space. &quot;Patashnik&quot; contained the first hints of the reduction in beat-driven song structure that would mark later Biosphere releases. Unlike the first album, &quot;Patashnik&quot; was quickly picked up by a comparatively large international audience, which brought Biosphere greater recognition. Jenssen also recorded as Cosmic Explorer, scoring a hit in Belgium with the EP &quot;The Hubble&quot;.

In 1995, Levi Strauss &amp; Co. was searching for a new angle to add to their television advertisement campaign (which up to that point had never featured electronic music), and they decided to use the uptempo track &quot;Novelty Waves&quot; from &quot;Patashnik&quot;. Shortly thereafter, &quot;Novelty Waves&quot; was released as a single (featuring remixes by various other artists), and managed to chart in several countries, reaching #51 in the United Kingdom. Although Jenssen never regretted his approval for use of the track, he also never sought this kind of fame and subsequently turned down various requests by his record company and peers to collaborate with well-known techno and drum &#x27;n bass artists or to create a follow-up album in the same style. During that same year, Biosphere contributed the song &quot;The Seal and the Hydrophone&quot; exclusively to &quot;Apollo 2 – The Divine Compilation&quot; released by Apollo Records.

&quot;Substrata&quot; (1997) is a purely atmospheric ambient Biosphere album, released on All Saints Records. &quot;Substrata&quot;, which marked Jenssen&#x27;s embarkation towards an intensely minimal style, is not only often considered to be Jenssen&#x27;s best work to date, but is also seen as one of the all-time classic ambient albums. &quot;Substrata&quot; contains samples from the American TV show &quot;Twin Peaks&quot;.

In 2000, Jenssen released &quot;Cirque&quot; on his new home Touch, an ambient album driven by muffled beats, samples, and minimal atmospherics. Though &quot;Cirque&quot; briefly revisited territory covered by earlier Biosphere releases, the rhythm section throughout the album remains an element of the background, unlike Jenssen&#x27;s first two Biosphere releases, wherein the drums occupied a dominating proportion of the foreground.

In 2002, he released &quot;Shenzhou&quot;, the fifth full-length album under the name Biosphere. This album was a more abstract work, comparable to Aphex Twin&#x27;s 1994 album &quot;Selected Ambient Works Volume II&quot;. The material on the album draws from elongated, pitch-shifted loops taken from Debussy&#x27;s &quot;La Mer&quot; (&quot;The Sea&quot;), and &quot;Jeux&quot;.

Released in 2004, &quot;Autour de la Lune&quot; stands as the most minimal and austere Biosphere album to date. The drones employed on this album are comparable to Coil&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Time Machines&quot; in their timbre and slow rate of change. The bulk of this work was originally commissioned and broadcast in September 2003 by Radio France Culture for a musical evocation of Jules Verne.

In 2006, Jenssen released &quot;Dropsonde&quot;, a half beatless, half rhythmic album composed of jazz rhythms evocative of Miles Davis&#x27; 1970s jazz fusion works. A partial vinyl sampler was released a few months earlier in 2005.

In 2009, Biosphere issued &quot;,&quot; his first live album, containing new tracks such as &quot;Pneuma&quot; and &quot;Pneuma II&quot;.

Jenssen has scored a number of films, including &quot;Eternal Stars&quot; (1993) and &quot;Insomnia&quot; (1997). He collaborated with German ambient composer Pete Namlook on &quot;Fires of Ork&quot;, and has also worked with Jah Wobble&#x27;s Invaders of the Heart and with Bobby Bird of Higher Intelligence Agency. In 2010, two soundtracks were announced on Biosphere&#x27;s website, for German film &quot;Im Schatten&quot; and Norwegian &quot;NOKAS&quot;.

On 27 June 2011, Geir Jenssen released the album &quot;N-Plants&quot;, inspired by nuclear energy and nuclear plants in Japan.

In 2016, Jenssen released &quot;Departed Glories&quot; as Biosphere. The thematic focus of the album draws inspiration from the defence of Kraków from Nazi invasion during the Second World War. Jenssen conceived of the album while living in the city.

On 5 February 2021, Jenssen released the electronic-classical album &quot;Angel&#x27;s Flight&quot; which features twelve tracks based on Beethoven&#x27;s String Quartet No. 14.

In January 2022, Jenssen released &quot;Shortwave Memories&quot; as Biosphere. The album marked a sonic departure from Jenssen&#x27;s previous work - using manually-programmed analogue synthesizers from the late 70s and early 80s to create a more vintage sound.

On 14 October 2022, Jenssen released Substrata (Alternative Versions) on Biophon Records, featuring ten alternative versions picked from the &quot;Substrata&quot; recording sessions that took place between 1995 and 1996.

==Live==
Biosphere regularly performs live during electronic music festivals and in clubs throughout Europe and various other locales around the world. Live performances usually consist of Jenssen performing improvisations or variations on newer tracks on a laptop while video art is projected behind him; for example, full-screen video art was projected in his Picturehouse cinema tour in April 2006. Although these performances are rarely tied specifically to a recent album release, the uptempo material from the Bleep and &quot;Microgravity&quot;/&quot;Patashnik&quot; era is occasionally featured in Biosphere performances.

In May 2004, Biosphere&#x27;s first United States performance took place in Detroit.

In 2008 Jenssen announced a year-long break from touring due to his reported hatred of &quot;airports, security checks, unhealthy food, air conditioning, hotels, etc.&quot;. However he resumed concert activity in 2009 and 2011.

==Other interests==
Jenssen is also an active climber and mountaineer. This hobby is an inspiration on his work, as well as a source of natural sound samples. His highest feat was in 2001, climbing the Cho Oyu (Himalaya, 8201 meters) without oxygen; in 2006, he thus released &quot;Cho Oyu 8201m – Field Recordings from Tibet&quot; (as Geir Jenssen).

<text>Santander () is a department of Colombia. Santander inherited the name of one of the nine original states of the United States of Colombia. It is located in the central northern part of the country, borders the Magdalena River to the east, Boyacá to the south and southeast, the Norte de Santander Department to the northeast, the Cesar Department to the north, the Bolivar and Antioquia Departments to the west. Its capital is the city of Bucaramanga.

== History ==
=== Pre-Columbian era ===
Prior to the arrival of the Spaniards, the territory now known as Santander was inhabited by Amerindian ethnic groups: Muisca, Chitareros, Laches, Yariguí, Opón, Carare and Guanes.

Their political and social structure was based on &quot;cacicazgos&quot;, a federation of tribes led by a &quot;cacique&quot;, with different social classes. Their main activity was planting maize, beans, yuca, arracacha, cotton, agave, tobacco, tomato, pineapple and guava, among others. Their agricultural skills were sufficiently developed to take advantage of the different mountainous terrains. The Guanes utilized terraces and an artificial system of irrigation. They had a knowledge of arts and crafts based on ovens to produce ceramics. They had cotton to make clothing and accessories such as hats and bags.

=== Colonization ===
Spanish conqueror Antonio de Lebrija led the first expedition through the area in 1529. The area was later invaded c. 1532 by German Ambrosius Ehinger in a quest to find &quot;El Dorado&quot;. This disrupted or destroyed many of the Amerindian villages. Some ethnic groups like the Yariguíes, Opones, and Carares fought the conquerors until they became extinct. Explorer Gonzalo Jiménez de Quesada later went to the area in an effort to appease the tribes. The colonization process in the area was started by Martín Galeano who founded the village of Vélez on July 3, 1539 and Pedro de Ursúa and Ortún Velázquez de Velasco founded the village of Pamplona (now part of the Norte de Santander Department) in 1549.

Once the Amerindian tribes were dominated, the Spanish organized the territory based on Cabildos (councils) to maintain the dominance and administer justice in the conquered territory. Amerindians were assimilated and subject to the encomienda regime to work in agriculture, manufacturing goods, and mines. These two villages functioned as centers for the Cabildos&#x27; territories. In 1636 the Cabildo of Vélez was transferred to a new jurisdiction centered on the village of Girón, comprising from the Sogamoso River, and Río del Oro to the Magdalena River. The village of San Gil was created in 1689, segregated from the Jurisdiction of Vélez. In 1789 the village of Socorro was also segregated from Vélez and they were all put under the mandate of the Province of Tunja, a subdivision of the Viceroyalty of New Granada. On July 9, 1795 the &quot;corregimiento&quot; of Vélez – San Gil – Socorro was created due to the unsustainability of the Province of Tunja, and local government was established in the village of Socorro.

== Culture ==

The department&#x27;s culture descends from a mix of Spanish and Chibcha influences, particularly in the south where the Muisca controlled territory and in the Chicamocha Canyon where the Guane are situated. During the colony and independence war times, people from Santander were especially recognized for their bravery in battle and their policy of &quot;not even a step back&quot;. Soldiers from Santander were valued and respected but also difficult to control as they were, in general, more politically aware than people from other regions and therefore prone to question orders and law.

== Cuisine ==

Santander cuisine includes regional specialties and food from the Department&#x27;s capital city of Bucaramanga and other cities such as Cepita.

The most famous dishes are sancocho, oreada (dried cured beef), mute, egg broth, yellow arepa, masato, guarapo, aguapanela, tamale, and the exotic culona ants.

=== &quot;Goat&quot; ===
Usually accompanied by pepitoria and yellow arepa, it can be eaten fried, oven-baked, or dried.

=== &quot;Arepa Santandereana&quot; ===
Flat corn bread. This dish includes chicharron (pork belly-fat) and cooked peeled corn. When possible, the peeled corn is roasted in clay pots, to provide even more flavor.

=== &quot;Mute&quot; ===
A soup prepared with a variety of ingredients such as red meat, tripe, beef ribs, grains, potatoes, pasta, corn, and spices. Due to the ingredients included, it has a thick consistency.

=== &quot;Pepitoria&quot; ===
Pepitoria is prepared with the intestines of a goat or lamb. Served with rice, yuca, and potatoes.

=== &quot;Santander tamale&quot; ===
The tamale is a dish that is eaten in various parts of Colombia, but in Santander it is prepared with peeled corn dough and filled with beef, chicken or pork, chickpeas, onions, and paprika. It is then wrapped in banana leaf giving it a rectangular shape.

=== &quot;Oreada meat&quot; ===
This is a marinated, salted, sun-dried beef ready to grill. It is a classic dish that can be found in many restaurants as a specialty, served with yucca and chili.

=== &quot;Hormigas Culonas (Big Bum Ants)&quot; ===
A traditional dish of the Guane indigenous inhabitants of this region. The head, wings, and legs of these giant ants are removed, leaving the body and bum to be fried and seasoned with salt. 

=== &quot;Bocadillo Veleño&quot; ===
Created in the town of Vélez, the Veleño Sandwich is prepared with the pulp of ripe Guava and is wrapped in a bijao leaf, giving it a characteristic flavor. It is sometimes paired with goat cheese.

=== &quot;Broth&quot; ===
A soup prepared with water, potatoes, toast, coriander, and egg (no milk or cream) and enjoyed for breakfast or lunch. There is also a variation called changua or chingua, which is normally prepared with water, potatoes, milk, cream and coriander. Sometimes broth (caldo) and changua comes with chicken or beef. Not to be confused with ajiaco, which is eaten in Bogota with creamy potato, huascas (green herb) and shredded chicken.

=== &quot;Obleas wafers&quot; ===
The wafer is a superfine cookie that is spread with Arequipe (caramel, sweetened milk spread). Over time, other ingredients such as cheese, blackberry, chocolate, etc. have been incorporated.

=== &quot;Masato&quot; ===
Masato is a fermented drink that is prepared with rice, water, wheat flour, sugar, cloves, and cinnamon. All this together forms a desired drink to accompany fritters or meat patties.

=== &quot;Chorizo from the San José Valley&quot; ===
12 km from San Gil, on the road that leads to Charalá, you will find a town called Valle de San José. People from this region say this is the best Colombian Chorizo, but people from Santa Rosa de Cabal, in the Coffee Zone, will tell you the same.

<text>Internet exchange points (IXes or IXPs) are common grounds of IP networking, allowing participant Internet service providers (ISPs) to exchange data destined for their respective networks. IXPs are generally located at places with preexisting connections to multiple distinct networks, &quot;i.e.&quot;, datacenters, and operate physical infrastructure (switches) to connect their participants. Organizationally, most IXPs are each independent not-for-profit associations of their constituent participating networks (that is, the set of ISPs that participate in that IXP). The primary alternative to IXPs is private peering, where ISPs directly connect their networks.

IXPs reduce the portion of an ISP&#x27;s traffic that must be delivered via their upstream transit providers, thereby reducing the average per-bit delivery cost of their service. Furthermore, the increased number of paths available through the IXP improves routing efficiency (by allowing routers to select shorter paths) and fault-tolerance. IXPs exhibit the characteristics of the network effect.

==History==
Internet exchange points began as Network Access Points or NAPs, a key component of Al Gore&#x27;s National Information Infrastructure (NII) plan, which defined the transition from the US Government-paid-for NSFNET era (when Internet access was government sponsored and commercial traffic was prohibited) to the commercial Internet of today. The four Network Access Points (NAPs) were defined as transitional data communications facilities at which Network Service Providers (NSPs) would exchange traffic, in replacement of the publicly financed NSFNET Internet backbone. The National Science Foundation let contracts supporting the four NAPs, one to MFS Datanet for the preexisting MAE-East in Washington, D.C., and three others to Sprint, Ameritech, and Pacific Bell, for new facilities of various designs and technologies, in New York (actually Pennsauken, New Jersey), Chicago, and California, respectively. As a transitional strategy, they were effective, providing a bridge from the Internet&#x27;s beginnings as a government-funded academic experiment, to the modern Internet of many private-sector competitors collaborating to form a network-of-networks, transporting Internet bandwidth from its points-of-production at Internet exchange points to its sites-of-consumption at users&#x27; locations.

This transition was particularly timely, coming hard on the heels of the ANS CO+RE controversy, which had disturbed the nascent industry, led to congressional hearings, resulted in a law allowing NSF to promote and use networks that carry commercial traffic, prompted a review of the administration of NSFNET by the NSF&#x27;s Inspector General (no serious problems were found), and caused commercial operators to realize that they needed to be able to communicate with each other independent of third parties or at neutral exchange points.

Although the three telco-operated NAPs faded into obscurity relatively quickly after the expiration of the federal subsidies, MAE-East, thrived for fifteen more years, and its west-coast counterpart MAE-West continued for more than twenty years.

Today, the phrase &quot;Network Access Point&quot; is of historical interest only, since the four transitional NAPs disappeared long ago, replaced by hundreds of modern Internet exchange points, though in Spanish-speaking Latin America, the phrase lives on to a small degree, among those who conflate the NAPs with IXPs.

==Function==
The primary purpose of an IXP is to allow networks to interconnect directly, via the exchange, rather than going through one or more third-party networks. The primary advantages of direct interconnection are cost, latency, and bandwidth.

Traffic passing through an exchange is typically not billed by any party, whereas traffic to an ISP&#x27;s upstream provider is. The direct interconnection, often located in the same city as both networks, avoids the need for data to travel to other cities—and potentially on other continents—to get from one network to another, thus reducing latency.

The third advantage, speed, is most noticeable in areas that have poorly developed long-distance connections. ISPs in regions with poor connections might have to pay between 10 or 100 times more for data transport than ISPs in North America, Europe, or Japan. Therefore, these ISPs typically have slower, more limited connections to the rest of the Internet. However, a connection to a local IXP may allow them to transfer data without limit, and without cost, vastly improving the bandwidth between customers of such adjacent ISPs.

Internet Exchange Points (IXPs) are public locations where several networks are connected to each other. Public peering is done at IXPs, while private peering can be done with direct links between networks.

==Operations==
===Technical operations ===
A typical IXP consists of one or more network switches, to which each of the participating ISPs connect. Prior to the existence of switches, IXPs typically employed fiber-optic inter-repeater link (FOIRL) hubs or Fiber Distributed Data Interface (FDDI) rings, migrating to Ethernet and FDDI switches as those became available in 1993 and 1994.

Asynchronous Transfer Mode (ATM) switches were briefly used at a few IXPs in the late 1990s, accounting for approximately 4% of the market at their peak, and there was an attempt by Stockholm-based IXP NetNod to use SRP/DPT, but Ethernet has prevailed, accounting for more than 95% of all existing Internet exchange switch fabrics. All Ethernet port speeds are to be found at modern IXPs, ranging from 10 Mb/second ports in use in small developing-country IXPs, to ganged 10 Gb/second ports in major centers like Seoul, New York, London, Frankfurt, Amsterdam, and Palo Alto. Ports with 100 Gb/second are available, for example, at the AMS-IX in Amsterdam and at the DE-CIX in Frankfurt.

=== Business operations ===
The principal business and governance models for IXPs include:
* Not-for-profit association (usually of the participating ISPs)
* Operator-neutral for-profit company (usually the operator of a datacenter hosting the IXP)
* University
* Government agency (often the communications ministry or regulator, at national scale, or municipal government, at local scale)
* Unincorporated informal association of networks (defined by an open-ended multi-party contract, without independent legal existence)

The technical and business logistics of traffic exchange between ISPs is governed by bilateral or multilateral peering agreements. Under such agreements, traffic is exchanged without compensation. When an IXP incurs operating costs, they are typically shared among all of its participants.

At the more expensive exchanges, participants pay a monthly or annual fee, usually determined by the speed of the port or ports which they are using. Fees based on the volume of traffic are less common because they provide a counterincentive to the growth of the exchange. Some exchanges charge a setup fee to offset the costs of the switch port and any media adaptors (gigabit interface converters, small form-factor pluggable transceivers, XFP transceivers, XENPAKs, etc.) that the new participant requires.

==Traffic exchange ==

Internet traffic exchange between two participants on an IXP is facilitated by Border Gateway Protocol (BGP) routing configurations between them. They choose to announce routes via the peering relationship – either routes to their own addresses or routes to addresses of other ISPs that they connect to, possibly via other mechanisms. The other party to the peering can then apply route filtering, where it chooses to accept those routes, and route traffic accordingly, or to ignore those routes, and use other routes to reach those addresses.

In many cases, an ISP will have both a direct link to another ISP and accept a route (normally ignored) to the other ISP through the IXP; if the direct link fails, traffic will then start flowing over the IXP. In this way, the IXP acts as a backup link.

When these conditions are met, and a contractual structure exists to create a market to purchase network services, the IXP is sometimes called a &quot;transit exchange&quot;. The Vancouver Transit Exchange, for example, is described as a &quot;shopping mall&quot; of service providers at one central location, making it easy to switch providers, &quot;as simple as getting a VLAN to a new provider&quot;. The VTE is run by BCNET, a public entity.

Advocates of green broadband schemes and more competitive telecommunications services often advocate aggressive expansion of transit exchanges into every municipal area network so that competing service providers can place such equipment as video on demand hosts and PSTN switches to serve existing phone equipment, without being answerable to any monopoly incumbent.

Since the dissolution of the Internet backbone and transition to the IXP system in 1992, the measurement of Internet traffic exchanged at IXPs has been the primary source of data about Internet bandwidth production: how it grows over time and where it is produced. Standardized measures of bandwidth production have been in place since 1996 and have been refined over time.

<doc id="359195" wikidata="Q863046" url="?curid=359195" title="Tuxedo Mask">
<text>, also known as , is a fictional character and one of the primary protagonists of the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; media franchise created by Naoko Takeuchi. He disguises himself to support the series&#x27; central heroines, the Sailor Guardians. Wearing a mask to conceal his identity, he interferes with enemy operations, offers the Sailor Guardians advice, and sometimes physically aids them in battle. He is the guardian and protector of the Earth, thus making him a member of the Sailor Guardians.

Like the Sailor Guardians, Tuxedo Mask possesses a power item: a Sailor Crystal, which gives him guardianship over the planet Earth. He also has psychic powers, including psychometry and healing, which evolve and become important to the storyline in the manga, but which play only a minor role and remain static in the anime. Along with his primary love interest Sailor Moon, a significant player in much of the story, he has royal credentials in the &quot;past life&quot; storyline as well as in the future.

==Profile==
Mamoru Chiba first appears as a high-school student studying at Moto-Azabu High School. Before the beginning of the series, his parents are killed in a car crash on his sixth birthday, which revealed the memories of his previous life as Prince Endymion. Living alone, Mamoru befriends school student Usagi Tsukino. In the beginning of the series, dreams of Princess Serenity haunt Mamoru. Unaware of his dual-identity as Tuxedo Mask, he suffers painful visions whenever Usagi becomes endangered, and he transforms unknowingly into Tuxedo Mask. As Mamoru, he tries to piece together his strange dreams, and as Tuxedo Mask, he tries to remember his past and identity, while searching for Princess Serenity. He seeks the Legendary Silver Crystal in the belief that this will fully restore his previous memories. In the anime adaptation, he seeks it because Princess Serenity tells him to in a dream. Of all the characters, Mamoru gets brainwashed and captured the most throughout the series.

Mamoru and Usagi share romantic feelings well before they discover their identities. Once they became a couple, they remain deeply devoted to each other and their love survives many trials. In the manga they briefly show jealousy towards each other. Usagi always addresses him as throughout the series during this time-period (Chibiusa also addresses him with this nickname later on). After dating for two years, Mamoru gives Usagi an engagement ring at an airport. Five years later, Mamoru and Usagi marry. In the future, they become king and queen and have a child together whom they name &quot;Small Lady&quot;, known in the majority of the series as &quot;Chibiusa&quot;.

Mamoru struggles with his identity and function throughout the series, worrying first about his true nature, then later whether he gets in the way of the Sailor Guardians. A fair amount of subtle characterization is made for Mamoru, and later extending his role within the manga as to who he is. He also is given the power of psychometry, which also showed up in the anime, but was not given a name. This manifests in his ability to see and read dreams (such as Chibiusa&#x27;s), to heal people and to monitor the status of the Earth. This does not develop fully until the Black Moon arc, and is used occasionally throughout the series.

In the original anime adaptation, Mamoru is a generally outgoing person, though somewhat acerbic, and appears as a college student. He demonstrates interests in a variety of subjects and emerges as smart. The musical &quot;Kakyu Ouhi Kourin&quot; shows that he is aspiring to become a doctor. He also &quot;dates&quot; Rei Hino for a short time before the revelation of all the past-life identities, though he believes they are just friends. This history stirs jealousy in Usagi in later seasons. &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot;, the second anime adaptation, follows the manga continuity and thus has Mamoru as a high school student, without much interaction with Rei. Unlike the original anime, Mamoru and Usagi start getting along relatively quickly instead of having to warm up to each other.

Most of Sailor Moon&#x27;s transformations and final victories come as a result of her and Tuxedo Mask cooperating together. In the final battle against the Dark Kingdom, Queen Metaria absorbs Sailor Moon and Tuxedo Mask into her body. However, they succeed in combining their powers through the Silver Crystal and destroy Queen Metalia from within. Tuxedo Mask also combines his power into Super Sailor Moon&#x27;s last item with the rest of the Guardians using the Golden Crystal. In the Infinity story arc he combines his powers with Sailor Moon to create the next scepter. This happens in episode 91, &quot;The Rod of Love is born: Usagi&#x27;s New Transformation.&quot; The manga tends to show Mamoru as quiet, studious, mysterious and stoic. The student body of his high school often admires him for these qualities. The anime adaptation also tends to make him appear in every episode to save Sailor Moon&#x27;s life. His attacks in the anime resemble those shown in the manga, but are not named.

In the musical adaptations, Mamoru protects Usagi and generally appears at her side. However, several of his relationships change in different settings: for example, one musical reveals Queen Beryl as Mamoru&#x27;s fiancé from his time as Prince of the Earth. Associating with Silver Millennium was against Earth law, and Endymion violated this law when he fell in love with Princess Serenity. In this version of events, Serenity and Endymion are outlaws (similar to Romeo and Juliet) who drive an otherwise innocent woman, Beryl, to evil by making her jealous. Sailor Pluto also reveals that she is in love with Endymion, though she has contented herself with watching from afar.

Another variation occurs in the &quot;Ryuusei Densetsu&quot; musical, when Galaxia does not kill Mamoru, leaving him able to fight alongside the Sailor Guardians. Mamoru typically gets very involved in the Sailor Guardians&#x27; battles, fighting alongside them as opposed to his anime role of throwing a rose and then letting Sailor Moon deliver the finishing blow.

Tuxedo Mask always gets his own song; these songs vary from musical to musical. One musical featured multiple songs as both the present Mamoru appeared as Tuxedo Mask and later King Endymion appeared in disguise as Space Knight to look out for Chibiusa.

In the live-action series, Mamoru is a more silent, yet dedicated person. For example, he stays loyal to his girlfriend Hina, despite not loving her, on the basis of a promise they made as children. He searches for the Silver Crystal due to his amnesia: dreams told him that the magical object could restore his memories. To do this, he donned the Tuxedo Mask disguise and became a thief, searching for the Silver Crystal. Once he regained his memories of his past and present lives, he assumed his Endymion form to help the Sailor Guardians and tried his best to protect Usagi from the dangers of overusing the Silver Crystal. However, because of his dedication he has to join the Dark Kingdom or the Four Kings of Heaven will be killed. He also joins to keep a promise with Usagi that they will not destroy the planet. Learning that the Silver Crystal made Metaria stronger every time Sailor Moon used it, Endymion took Metaria into his body before succumbing to its dark power. Now an evil parody of himself, Dark Prince Endymion, he almost kills Sailor Mercury when Sailor Moon was forced to kill him to stop Metaria, causing Sailor Moon to kill herself but they survive. However they were saved. Mamo&#x27;s pocket watch stops the sword from through Sailor Moon. His knights from a past life’gems saves him though the knights were killed. He revives once Sailor Moon manages to finally control the Crystal&#x27;s power and destroys Metaria for good.

==Aspects and forms==
As a character with different incarnations, special powers, transformations, and a long lifetime spanning the Silver Millennium era and the 30th century, Mamoru gains multiple aspects and aliases as the series progresses.

===Tuxedo Mask===
&quot;Tuxedo Mask&quot; represents a disguise Mamoru created for himself in order to hunt for the Silver Crystal &quot;incognito&quot; and—later—to assist the Sailor Guardians in battle. In addition to his white mask, he wears a full-dress tailcoat (as opposed to the dinner jacket of an actual tuxedo) with a red-lined black cape, white gloves, and a top hat. In the anime and live-action series, he carries a black baton which he uses like a sword. He takes the place of Sailor Earth.

The anime shows him standing on poles, defying gravity, and acting as a &quot;swoop-in&quot; type. He appears less developed, and has no special powers or named attacks, but remains a constant force in helping the Sailor Guardians throughout the series when they are in trouble. At the beginning he cannot control the transformation and his body automatically (and painfully) transforms if Sailor Moon is in danger. By the end of the first story arc, he can willingly activate the transformation. In a stylized &quot;henshin&quot; sequence, this is indicated by pulling a rose out of his pocket which then changes colors, and his tuxedo and mask fly in. Later in the series he is shown transforming instantaneously.

In the manga, he starts out as an ordinary thief trying to find the Silver Crystal. Luna initially tells Usagi not to trust him, but relents when they begin to fall in love and his true identity emerges. His function goes beyond that of the rescuer portrayed so often in the anime – it is frequently Sailor Moon who goes to his rescue, and he lends her strength, support, and guidance to use the Silver Crystal to defeat the enemies in return.

In the fourth story arc of the manga Helios reinforces Tuxedo Mask&#x27;s role as a hero by revealing that he, as the Prince of the Golden Kingdom, Elysion, possesses a holy stone in the same way that the Princess of the Silver Millennium owns the Silver Crystal. This holy stone is the Golden Crystal, the Sailor Crystal of the Earth.

===Prince Endymion===

 was the crown prince of planet Earth during the age of Silver Millennium and Mamoru&#x27;s identity in his previous life. He resided in the Golden Kingdom, which protected the Earth from within. Even though he and Elysion&#x27;s guardian Helios never met each other in person during that time, they shared the common desire to protect the planet. Endymion also had four guardians, the Four Kings of Heaven, who protected him. He and Princess Serenity fell in love, breaking the taboo between their peoples which was exploited by Queen Metaria when she corrupted the people of Earth. Being killed by Beryl when she attempted to kill Serenity, the 90s anime depicting his death with the princess committed by Metaria herself, Prince Endymion is reincarnated in the 20th century as Mamoru Chiba.

The manga often portrays Prince Endymion as the silent protagonist; his past life remains a mystery. Mamoru usually does not transform into Prince Endymion willfully, but is usually used as a power-up from his Tuxedo Mask form. Mamoru was under Metaria&#x27;s thralldom, he assumed an evil form of Endymion and used his power to hypnotize Motoki Furuhata to assume he was his best friend &quot;Endou&quot;. In the 90s anime, Mamoru can transform into Prince Endymion. Often this occurs when Sailor Moon transforms into Princess Serenity. As in the manga, he wears black armor.

In the live-action series, Endymion wears white, and after obtaining this form it becomes Mamoru&#x27;s primary combat form. He gains the power of teleportation, a power shared by the Four Kings of Heaven. After he takes Metaria into his body, his armor and accessories blacken as he becomes known as Metaria Endymion with trace remnants of his white armor in his possessed state.

===King Endymion===
Later in the series Mamoru emerges as King Endymion, King of 30th-century Crystal Tokyo. He is the husband of Neo-Queen Serenity, and father of Chibiusa. As king of Crystal Tokyo his royal garments are a white and lavender tuxedo, as well as a royal staff.
King Endymion&#x27;s first appearance is at the end of manga and Crystal Act 18. He is not actually in a physical form but a spiritual entity guarding the Crystal Palace while his real body sleeps.
During this time he helps to guide the Sailor Guardians and his past self against the Dark Moon Kingdom. It is then revealed to the Sailor Guardians that Mamoru never aged due to the Silver Crystal&#x27;s power. It is the ghost of King Endymion who instructs Tuxedo Mask in the first use of his attack &quot;Tuxedo La Smoking Bomber.&quot; Prince Endymion becomes King at the end of the battle with the Dead Moon Circus when Helios, the priest of his former home, Elysion, hands him his sacred golden crystal atop his king&#x27;s staff. After this, both Tuxedo Mask and Sailor Moon turn into their respective future selves, all of the Sailor Guardians transform into their princess forms.
However, after this point, Mamoru is not seen in this form again.

The anime shows King Endymion only in the future as the father of Small Lady and the King of Crystal Tokyo. He also appears as a computerized image when they first meet him. However, he is never shown to fight in battle. Diana makes a comment about the future King and Queen. She says in &quot;SuperS&quot; that the King and Queen like to fake being sick to be excused from attending important banquets and meetings. In the original English dub, he was not referred to as Endymion; only the &quot;King of the Earth&quot; or &quot;The King&quot; or &quot;King Darien&quot;.

===Moonlight Knight===

, clad in Arabian robes while possessing a saber and white roses, appears in the 1990s anime during the &quot;Hell Tree&quot; arc of &quot;Sailor Moon R&quot;. When Usagi wished to be a normal girl at the end of the 90s depiction of the &quot;Dark Kingdom&quot; arc, Mamoru was included with the Sailor Guardians&#x27; memories being magically sealed to resume civilian lives. But Mamoru&#x27;s subconscious desire to protect Usagi caused his sealed memories to leave his body and assume physical form as Moonlight Knight, existing independently from Mamoru. Like with Tuxedo Mask, with even Mamoru a suspect, Usagi assumed every cute guy she met was Moonlight Knight before learning his true identity. It was only once Mamoru recovered his memories and regained his ability of becoming Tuxedo Mask that Moonlight Knight ceased to exist and reintegrated back into Mamoru&#x27;s being.
==Special powers and items==

Even in civilian form, Mamoru demonstrates a variety of psychic powers throughout each series. In both the anime and manga he uses psychometry to read past, present, and future events through touch, and heals others&#x27; wounds through psychokinesis. Inconsistently, he is shown teleporting; just once in the anime while under Queen Beryl&#x27;s power,
and several times as Prince Endymion in the live-action series.

Mamoru also demonstrates a spiritual connection with Usagi: he can detect when she has transformed into Sailor Moon. Early on in the anime series, before they become friends, this connection forcibly transforms Mamoru into Tuxedo Mask so that he can protect her. In later episodes, he seems to have control over his transformations, although he still shows up shortly after the start of most of the battles, no matter how far away from the developing situation.

On one occasion the anime gives Tuxedo Mask a stylized transformation sequence, with his tuxedo and accessories forming around him as he flings a rose. He does not shout any special phrase, although his voice-actor jokingly ad-libbed the line &quot;Tuxedo Power! Make up!&quot; He also acquires a transformation in the live-action series, using the same phrase, which is a part of an outrageous story he tells Usagi about how he became Tuxedo Mask. This transformation is initiated with a special band-aid, and the sequence consists of Mamoru pulling on his pants and coat with dramatic flair.

Once transformed, Tuxedo Mask displays additional powers. In the anime shows these as mainly physical, while the manga depicts them as rare and magical. His iconic mainstay in the anime involves the use of roses, thrown like darts to injure or distract enemies. He can also twirl them or throw a wide array to block attacks, or can throw many at a time to pin an enemy down. He seems to have an unlimited supply of these roses, which are supernaturally strong and embed themselves in most any material, including concrete. In addition, when Mamoru takes on different forms or aspects, his roses change color accordingly. Tuxedo Mask&#x27;s roses are red, the evil Prince Endymion&#x27;s are black (and electrified), and the Moonlight Knight&#x27;s are white.

Tuxedo Mask&#x27;s secondary weapon, his cane, often serves as a sword, and he can extend its length, either to attack or to rescue people. As both Prince Endymion and Moonlight Knight, he uses real swords of different styles.

In the manga, Tuxedo Mask can blast energy from his hand, crying &quot;Tuxedo La Smoking Bomber!&quot; He also has a combination attack with his daughter, Sailor Chibi Moon: &quot;Pink Sugar Tuxedo Attack.&quot; The musicals reproduce this attack, and in the second anime, he gradually learns to use it over the course of the first season.

Mamoru&#x27;s most important magical possession in the manga, the Golden Crystal, serves as both his star seed and as the Sailor Crystal of the Earth. He uses it in combination with Sailor Moon&#x27;s Silver Crystal to defend the Solar System. In the anime, although Mamoru has the &quot;golden star seed&quot; of Earth, it differs from the Golden Crystal, which instead is possessed by Pegasus and can be used by people with good intentions.

==Development==
Takeuchi designed the character of Tuxedo Mask as her own ideal of a man, describing him as &quot;strong, silent, unshakeable, a little like Captain Harlock.&quot; Takeuchi based his design on Shonentai member Noriyuki Higashiyama and she also took inspiration from Kaito Kid. Takeuchi originally intended his persona as Tuxedo Mask to &quot;have more mysteries and take a greater role.&quot;

The kanji in Mamoru&#x27;s surname translate as and . Together, they form the term &quot;local,&quot; with a pun on his identity as Endymion, Prince of Earth. His given name means .

Originally Naoko Takeuchi used the codename &quot;Mysterious 2098 Face&quot; for Tuxedo Mask. She later expressed bewilderment at herself for the idea. Although Takeuchi had designed his costume herself, she found it difficult to draw, as it had many parts to it; she often forgot to draw parts of it in the early manga. She later had the same problem with Sailor Galaxia&#x27;s costume.

Tōru Furuya stated in a making-of extra that he had an influence on the development of the anime persona of Tuxedo Mask. When asked about any differences between the anime and manga counterparts, he ad-libbed &quot;I&#x27;m driving.&quot; Because of this, Tuxedo Mask became more comical.

The name Endymion fits particularly appropriately as a reference to Greek mythology. The Greek Endymion falls in love with Selene, the Greek goddess of the moon.

===Actors===
Mamoru Chiba was originally voiced by Tōru Furuya in the first Japanese anime series and related media. Furuya described the role as &quot;very special to me.&quot; Mamoru was voiced by Kenji Nojima in &quot;Sailor Moon Crystal&quot; and all media since. In the DIC and Cloverway English adaptations, his name is changed to Darien Chiba and his voice is first provided by Rino Romano for the first eleven episodes, Toby Proctor for the next fifty-five episodes, and Vince Corazza for the rest of the series and its films. In the Viz Media English dub, Mamoru&#x27;s voice is supplied by Robbie Daymond.

In the stage musicals, different actors and actreses have played Mamoru: Mizuki Sano, Yūta Mochizuki, Yuuta Enomoto, Kousei Amano, Hidemasa Edo, Kenji Urai, Yuu Shirota, Gyo Miyamoto, Yūga Yamato, Mikako Ishii, Riona Tatemichi, and Mitsuki Tenju. Creator Naoko Takeuchi has described Sano&#x27;s portrayal of Mamoru as &quot;a cute, sweet boy.&quot; Yūta Mochizuki, the longest-running among the musical actors, went on to perform as King Endymion during Fumina Hara&#x27;s musicals.

In the live action series, Mamoru was portrayed by Jouji Shibue.

==Reception and influence==
The official &quot;Sailor Moon&quot;-character popularity-polls listed Mamoru Chiba, Tuxedo Mask, and Endymion as separate entities. In 1992, readers ranked Tuxedo Mask as the twelfth most popular character, Prince Endymion as the fifteenth most popular character, and Mamoru Chiba as the sixteenth most popular character out of thirty eight choices. One year later, now with fifty choices, King Endymion became the eighteenth most popular character, while Tuxedo Mask and Mamoru came in at twentieth and twenty-first respectively. Moonlight Knight, being an anime only form, was never included in the manga popularity polls. Tuxedo Mask was the fourth favorite male character in a May 1993 Animage poll, and Mamoru was seventh the following year.

Although Takeuchi herself had a soft spot for Mamoru, she has said that friends complained to her about Usagi being in love with &quot;such a useless guy.&quot; He has been described as being both a &quot;dashing hero&quot; and a &quot;boy-damsel in distress&quot; by Jonathan Clements and Helen McCarthy. He has even been called a &quot;liability&quot; and a &quot;burden,&quot; his relationship with Usagi being described as a child-mother relationship rather than that of a principality couple. Usagi is said to show him &quot;amae&quot;, or &quot;indulgent love.&quot; When compared to male leads of male-targeted series, Mamoru, although unafraid of girls, seems uncomfortable with them. He also gives the impression of a &quot;character who never laughs or has fun&quot;: &quot;noble, passive and effectively totally ineffectual.&quot;

The image of the top hat and cape also influenced the early making of &quot;Tuxedo Umino Mask&quot; (&quot;Tuxedo Melvin&quot; in the original dub) in the anime. In this particular episode, Umino tries to impress Naru by dressing up like Tuxedo Mask. This image was also used later in the manga for Tubby Mask for the Chibiusa Picture Diary, Story of the Hammer Price Shrine. This character was based on Makoto Hanmatsuura, who bid ¥2 million in a charity auction for the Kobe earthquake disaster to be put in the &quot;Sailor Moon&quot; manga.

<text>Earl Attlee is a title in the Peerage of the United Kingdom. It was created on 16 December 1955 for Clement Attlee, the former Labour prime minister. At the same time he was made Viscount Prestwood, of Walthamstow in the County of Essex, which serves as the subsidiary title to the earldom and is also in the Peerage of the United Kingdom.

As of 2022, the titles are held by his grandson, the third Earl, who succeeded his father in 1991. He is one of the ninety elected hereditary peers that remain in the House of Lords after the passing of the House of Lords Act 1999. In contrast to his father and grandfather, the current Lord Attlee is a member of the Conservative Party.

Air Vice-Marshal Donald Laurence Attlee, CB, LVO, DL (2 September 1922 – 28 April 2021), was a nephew of the 1st Earl Attlee.

<text>The Kent and East Sussex Railway (K&amp;ESR) refers to both a historical private railway company in Kent and East Sussex in England, as well as a heritage railway currently running on part of the route of the historical company. The railway runs between Tenterden Town and Bodiam.

A separate railway preservation effort, the Rother Valley Railway, is restoring track at the western end between Robertsbridge Junction and Bodiam.

==Historical company==

===Background===
By the mid 19th century, Tenterden was in the middle of a triangle of railway lines. The South Eastern Railway had opened its line from Redhill to Tonbridge on 12 July 1841. The line was opened as far as Headcorn on 31 August 1842 and to Ashford on 1 December 1843. The South Eastern Railway opened its line from Ashford to Hastings on 13 February 1851.

The third part of the triangle was the line between Tonbridge and Hastings which had opened as far as Tunbridge Wells on 24 November 1846, Robertsbridge on 1 September 1851, Battle on 1 January 1852 and to St Leonards on 1 February 1852, running powers over the London, Brighton and South Coast Railway″s line to Hastings having been negotiated.

The Ashford–Hastings line had originally been promoted to run via Headcorn and Tenterden, but the government preferred the more southerly route. In 1855, a proposed railway from Headcorn via Cranbrook to Tenterden failed to obtain an act of Parliament. In 1864, a proposed railway from Paddock Wood via Cranbrook and Tenterden to Hythe (the Weald of Kent Railway) also failed to obtain an act of Parliament. A proposed roadside tramway from Headcorn to Tenterden suffered the same fate in 1882. In 1877, the Cranbrook and Paddock Wood Railway was incorporated, and powers obtained to build the northern section of the Weald of Kent Railway to transport agricultural produce and livestock from low-lying land adjacent to Wittersham Road to a better mainline connection. Powers were obtained in 1882 to extend the line to Hawkhurst. The line opened to Goudhurst in 1892 and Hawkhurst in 1893.

The Tenterden Railway was the next to be proposed, running from Maidstone to Hastings via Headcorn, Tenterden, and Appledore. The section from Headcorn to Appledore was authorised in 1892, and agreement was reached in 1896 with the South Eastern Railway over the operation of the line. In 1898, the proposal was abandoned in favour of extending the Cranbrook and Paddock Wood railway to Tenterden and Appledore. This was abandoned in 1899 as it was deemed too expensive to construct, and the South Eastern Railway again backed the Tenterden Railway, but no work was done and powers to construct the line lapsed in 1901.

With the passing of the Light Railways Act 1896, a group of citizens of Tenterden, led by Myles Fenton, proposed a railway line from Robertsbridge to Tenterden—the Rother Valley Railway. Assent was granted to construct the line under the act. The contract for the construction of the line was won by London and Scottish Contract Corporation, who sub-contracted the work to Godfrey and Siddelow. The work was overseen by Holman F Stephens, who was appointed general manager in 1899 and managing director in 1900. Stephens attained the rank of lieutenant colonel in the Territorial Army (TA) in 1916 and was subsequently known as Colonel Stephens.

===Opening and growth===
The Light Railways Act 1896 allowed for cheaper construction methods in return for a speed restriction. The line was authorised to be built with rails but was actually built with rails. Speed was to be limited to , but under the terms of the Act was soon raised to . The line was opened for freight between Robertsbridge and Rolvenden on 26 March 1900, and to passenger traffic on 2 April 1900. A wind pump was provided at Robertsbridge to supply water for locomotives. The original Tenterden station, later renamed Rolvenden was some from the town. The first train departed at 7:30 am, carrying some 60.2 passengers. The lukewarm reception was partly because of the distance of the station from the town, and partly due to fears that the opening of the light railway from Robertsbridge would prevent a more heavily engineered line being built from Headcorn.

The South Eastern Railway abandoned its plans to build the Cranbrook to Appledore line; the scheme was adopted by the Rother Valley Railway. Opposition from the South Eastern Railway meant that the Tenterden to Appledore section was dropped. Authorisation was received in December 1899 to build the Cranbrook and Tenterden Light Railway from Cranbrook via Benenden to the Tenterden terminus of the Rother Valley Railway, and to extend further into the town of Tenterden itself. A proposal was promoted in 1900 to build a line from Robertsbridge to Pevensey, which was to be worked by the Rother Valley Railway. The East Sussex Light Railway was authorised in 1901. This was a line from Northiam to Rye. Only the section from the original Tenterden terminus to Tenterden Town was actually built of all these schemes.

The extension to Tenterden Town opened on 15 April 1903. The original Tenterden station was renamed Rolvenden on this date. The first train from Rolvenden to Tenterden carried 312. 78 schoolchildren, along with Sir Myles Fenton, Holman F Stephens, and other dignitaries. The South Eastern and Chatham Railway, seeking to relieve themselves from building the Tenterden Railway, entered into an agreement with the Rother Valley Railway for the latter to build and operate the line from Tenterden to Headcorn. The South Eastern and Chatham Railway agreed to make up any operating losses in exchange for an option to purchase the line at any time within the next 21 years from the date of opening. The option was not exercised. A wind pump was provided at the Headcorn end of the station. It supplied a water tower located at the Robertsbridge end of the station. In 1904, the Rother Valley Railway changed its name to the Kent &amp; East Sussex Light Railway.

The line from Tenterden to opened to traffic on 15 May 1905. A wind pump was provided just outside Headcorn Junction to supply water for the locomotives. In 1904, the Headcorn and Maidstone Junction Light Railway was authorised. This line would have run from Headcorn via Sutton Valence to Tovil, where running powers over part of the Medway Valley Line would have allowed access to Maidstone. Only the section from Tovil to Tovil Goods was ever built. The original junction at Headcorn was on the Ashford side of the station. Headcorn was remodelled by the Southern Railway in 1930 to provide two through roads and the junction was then moved to the Tonbridge side of the station.

On the outbreak of World War I in 1914, the K&amp;ESR came under government control, as did most railways at the time. It was released from government control in 1921, and £1,487 in compensation was paid. The K&amp;ESR was not included in the grouping of the railways into the Big Four in 1923, and continued its independent existence.

===Grouping and decline===
By 1924, the section from Tenterden to Headcorn was operating at a loss. Correspondence with the Southern Railway in 1930 led to Sir Herbert Walker stating that there was no chance of the line making a profit, and that even if passenger services were withdrawn, it was doubtful whether the receipts from freight traffic would cover operating expenses. The Southern Railway were liable to make up any operating losses, as the successor to the South Eastern and Chatham Railway under the terms of the Act of Parliament for the construction of that section of line.

In 1931, Colonel Stephens died, and the management of the K&amp;ESR came under the control of William Henry Austen, who had been assistant and life-partner to Stephens for a number of years. In 1932, Austen was appointed Official Receiver for the line. He entered into negotiations with the Southern Railway aimed at disposing of worn out stock and obtaining serviceable replacements. One batch of stock disposed of was valued at £855, but realised only £6 10s 0d. In 1935, the K&amp;ESR purchased a 2-ton Bedford LQ lorry, and another was purchased in 1936. In that year, the first of the locomotives hired from the Southern Railway arrived on the line, this was P Class No. 1556. The whole line was relaid with rails in 1939.

When World War II broke out in 1939, the K&amp;ESR again came under government control, being placed under the Railway Operating Division of the Royal Engineers. Rail mounted guns were stationed at Rolvenden and Wittersham. The line was an alternative supply route to the south coast, and relieved some of the pressure on Ashford. Components for Operation Pluto were conveyed along the line. With the increase in price for scrap metal during the war, most of the line&#x27;s surplus stock was scrapped. On 1 January 1948, the line became part of Southern Region of British Railways on nationalisation.

===British Railways===


Upon nationalisation, one of the surviving two locomotives and all but the newest rolling stock were scrapped. Ex South Eastern and Chatham Railway birdcage carriages were put into service on the line, supplementing the ex London and South Western Railway carriages. Mixed trains continued to run, but were now provided with a brake van. The line continued to be run as two sections. A proposal to double the line wasn&#x27;t carried out, but the track was again relaid to a higher standard, using rails salvaged from the Elham Valley Railway. All ticket stock was withdrawn and new tickets were printed, and the staffing of stations was increased. That was not accompanied by an increase in passengers, and regular passenger services ceased. The final passenger train ran on 2 January 1954. It was the 5:50 pm from Robertsbridge to Headcorn, composed of six corridor coaches which had been specially brought from Ashford for the occasion. Motive power was &quot;Terrier&quot;s 32655 leading and 32678 at the rear. 32655 was replaced by O1 31065 and 32678 banked the train to St Michael&#x27;s. The two &quot;Terrier&quot;s then ran back to Robertsbridge with a carriage between them to reduce the weight on the bridges. Double-heading was prohibited between Rolvenden and Robertsbridge.

Two freight trains a day continued to run, with hop-pickers&#x27; specials operating until 1958. There was occasional passenger traffic in the form of railtours. In 1957, Drewry diesel locomotive 11220 was successfully trialled on the line, and it and 11223 were the regular locomotives for the final years of operation. In 1958, Hastings Diesel Electric Multiple Unit number 1002 underwent load tests between Bodiam and Northiam – the only time one of these units visited the line prior to the preservation era.

===Closure===
The final passenger train over the line before closure was a Locomotive Club of Great Britain railtour on 11 June 1961. The line closed the following day, apart from a short stretch at Robertsbridge serving Hodson&#x27;s Flour Mill, which became a private siding. This final section of the line closed on 1 January 1970.

===Operation===
The Kent &amp; East Sussex Light Railway was operated as two separate sections, Robertsbridge - Tenterden Town and Tenterden Town - Headcorn. The extension to Headcorn had been built with heavier rails than the Robertsbridge - Rolvenden section, and thus had a higher axle loading allowing the use of heavier locomotives. The section between Tenterden Town and Headcorn was largely paralleled by roads, and was open to competition from road transport. Although the Rother Valley Railway and the Kent &amp; East Sussex Light Railway originally ran separate passenger and freight trains, by the 1920s mixed trains were the norm. The first railbus was introduced in 1923. Although these were light and economical to run, they did not provide much in the way of passenger comfort.

Between 1928 and 1933, a through coach was added to the 5:15 pm from Cannon Street to Hastings, which was detached at Robertsbridge and worked on to Tenterden. In the hop-picking season, special trains were run to bring the hop-pickers down from London. One such train in 1936 is recorded as having consisted of four Southern Railway bogie carriages, two K&amp;ESR six-wheeled carriages and a van. The train was hauled by the ex LSWR &quot;Saddletank&quot; No 4. The K&amp;ESR&#x27;s own stock was generally confined to that system. The Southern Railway refused permission for some of the K&amp;ESR carriages to be taken to Lydd in 1947 citing safety reasons. The carriages were required for use in the filming of &quot;The Loves of Joanna Godden&quot;.

Tickets were usually issued on the trains, although the K&amp;ESR did not acquire any corridor carriages until 1944. The tickets were printed at Rolvenden. Tickets for other lines under Colonel Stephens&#x27;s control were also printed here.

===Accidents===
*In 1916, &quot;Hesperus&quot; was derailed when the locomotive ploughed into a snow drift.
*On 9 January 1929, the Ford railmotor was derailed at Junction Road (for Hawkhurst).
*No 7 was derailed at an unknown date.
*On Saturday 26 March 1949, A1 32678 was derailed between Northiam and the Rother Bridge working the 5:50 pm from Bexhill West. A month passed before 32678 was recovered.
*In May 1983, Manning Wardle &#x27;Charwelton&#x27; was derailed between Wittersham Road and Rolvenden causing damage to approximately 100 yards of track and to the locomotive&#x27;s axle boxes.

==Preservation==
===Preservation history===
Preservation activities began immediately. However, due to difficulties in obtaining the necessary Light Railway (Transfer) Order, it was 1974 before the line partially reopened as a heritage steam railway between Tenterden and Rolvenden. Extensions followed, notably to Wittersham Road in 1977 and Northiam in 1990; then to Bodiam in 2000, and an extra extension to the site of Junction Road halt in 2011.

The preserved railway has had a tempestuous history, with two financial crises and disputes between the volunteer group and their elected board of trustees. In the late 1990s, the company was almost bankrupted but avoided administration due to an error in the bank&#x27;s loan agreement. The financial position has since improved.

As with most heritage railways, the line has a number of paid employees to secure its continued operation and stages a variety of special events days to boost income.

The railway has suffered from the legacy of Colonel Stephens&#x27;s cheap and poor construction of the permanent way; thus the preserved railway has sought to update permanent way features, for instance by renewing culverts and embankments.

In 1990, the railway had to remove 200 metres of embankment damaged by badgers. There are some problems of subsidence outside Rolvenden, which often requires speed restrictions to avoid further damage to the line&#x27;s foundations. Most of the permanent way between Northiam and Bodiam has now been rebuilt to modern standards.

===The line today===
The line today is a tourist attraction in the South East of England. It offers an ride through the Rother Valley in vintage and British Railways coaches usually hauled by a steam locomotive, although some off-peak services are operated by a diesel multiple unit.

The preserved line currently runs from Tenterden Town station to Bodiam (within sight of the National Trust&#x27;s Bodiam Castle), with an extra of track to the Junction Road station site (though there are currently no plans to re-open for alighting).

Tenterden Town station is the main headquarters for the heritage railway, where a book and gift shop can be found, selling Thomas the Tank Engine gifts, the carriage and wagon department and a cafe that was once the Maidstone &amp; District Motor Services bus station building from Maidstone, Kent. The railway emphasises the Colonel Stephens connection as a major factor of its utilitarian heritage. The locomotive works is located at Rolvenden station and has a viewing platform overlooking the works yard and a selection of former inter-modal shipping containers used for equipment storage. Themed events are run through the year. Some are connected with local history and the railway whilst, as on other heritage lines, Thomas and Santa specials provide a commercial underpinning to the company&#x27;s activities. Railway experience days are also offered.

===Colonel Stephens Railway Museum===
Situated at Tenterden is the Colonel Stephens Railway Museum. This houses a number of exhibits including a wax dummy of the colonel, telling the story of the man himself and of his railways. This is a popular exhibit amongst children visiting the museum, many of whom delight in the collection of old railway magazines and timetables.

===Rother Valley Railway===

At Robertsbridge, a separate railway preservation effort was set up by the Rother Valley Railway in 1990. It aims to restore track and services east from the main line railway station to Bodiam.

The initial plan was to work towards operating brake van rides on the site, but progress was slow due mainly to lack of funds. However, in 2011 this plan was dropped in favour of moving directly to a final layout suitable to handle the eventual traffic to and from Tenterden, with no interim railway operations. By 2013, much of the new Robertsbridge layout was in place including new track and most of a new full-length station platform. Future developments are to include a carriage shed, loco shed and completion of the station building.

Plans for the missing central part of the route are well advanced, despite being hampered by the A21 trunk road crossing the track bed, the need for some very expensive bridge works and the necessity to purchase the route from landowners. Two landowners remain resistant to selling the necessary agricultural land for railway development, and the plans for a level crossing on the A21 in particular has caused local controversy.

At the beginning of 2009 about of former track bed was purchased from just west of Bodiam station to within yards of the site of Junction Road Halt. Work began on restoration and by April of that year the track was laid. In 2010 a further 150yds of track bed was obtained and track was laid to the site of Junction Road Halt adjacent to the B2244 (formerly the A229). The first advertised passenger service over this section ran on the weekend of 19/20 March 2011, although services are currently restricted to occasional gala days only.

By end of 2013, the track had been laid from the newly built platform at Robertsbridge all the way to Northbridge Street over five newly rebuilt bridges, and during 2013 the first steam trains ran along this line since it was closed. In 2012 a plan to reconnect the RVR to the national railway network once more was announced, and this connection opened in 2016.

On 16 March 2017, Rother District Council granted planning permission for the reinstatement of the line between Northbridge Street and Junction Road. An application has been made for a Transport and Works Act order which would give statutory powers to rebuild and operate the line. This awaits a public inquiry.

On 9 May 2023, the Transport and Works act order (TWAO) was granted.

==Rolling stock==

===The independent company===

====Steam locomotives====

Owned by the Rother Valley Railway and/or the Kent &amp; East Sussex Light Railway.
Note:

The order of scrapping of the locomotives was 7, 5, 6 (steam railcar), 1, 9, 2 and 8.

====Railcars====

Owned by the Rother Valley Railway and/or the Kent &amp; East Sussex Light Railway.
====Hired or loaned locomotives====

Hired or loaned to the Kent &amp; East Sussex Light Railway.
====Passenger stock====

Owned by the Rother Valley Railway and/or the Kent and East Sussex Light Railway.
====Freight stock====

Owned by the Rother Valley Railway and/or the Kent and East Sussex Light Railway.
====Non-rail vehicles====

The K&amp;ESR owned a number of non-rail vehicles, one of which survives today.

*Horse Bus - built in 1902 by W J Mercer, Tenterden Carriage Works. Operated under contract by William Hook &amp; Son until the firm ceased trading in 1916. Then operated by the K&amp;ESR until withdrawn in 1924 and stored. Became British Railways property on nationalisation. Now an exhibit at the National Railway Museum, York.
*Horse-drawn van and two drays. The K&amp;ESR acquired a horse-drawn van and two drays in 1916. These were withdrawn in the mid-1930s.
*2 2-ton Bedford LQ Lorries. One was purchased in 1935 and the second hire purchased in 1936, replacing the horse-drawn vehicles. Both vehicles passed to British Railways on nationalisation.

===British Railways===

These locomotives worked on the line between 1948 and 1961.

===Heritage===

==Twinning==
The Kent &amp; East Sussex Railway is twinned with the Chemin de Fer de la Baie de Somme, a preserved railway in France. K&amp;ESR locomotives have made visits to the CFBS.

==Culture and media==

In the 1924 book &quot;A Parcel of Kent&quot; by F J Harvey Darton, the railway described is clearly based on the Kent &amp; East Sussex Railway. The railway also appears in the 1940 book &quot;Ember Lane&quot; by Sheila Kaye-Smith, where it is titled the Sussex Border Railway. The Kent &amp; East Sussex Railway is the subject of the poem &quot;Farmer&#x27;s Train&quot; by Hugh Bevan, illustrated by Rowland Emett, and published in &quot;Punch&quot; issue dated 3 June 1946.

<doc id="359204" wikidata="Q4808651" url="?curid=359204" title="Assemblies of God Statement of Fundamental Truths">
<text>The Statement of Fundamental Truths is a confession of faith outlining the 16 essential doctrines adhered to by the Assemblies of God USA. These doctrines are heavily based on other evangelical confessions of faith but differ by being clearly Pentecostal. Of the 16 articles, four are considered core beliefs &quot;due to the key role they play in reaching the lost and building the believer and the church&quot;. They are the doctrines concerning salvation, the baptism in the Holy Spirit, divine healing, and the Second Coming of Christ. The Statement of Fundamental Truths has undergone several permutations since its original adoption in 1916 (when it actually included 17 items) despite common claims that it has remained largely unchanged.

==Contents==
Most of the statement reiterates basic tenets of evangelicalism while adding articles on &quot;healing by the atonement&quot; and tongues as &quot;initial evidence&quot; of baptism in the Holy Spirit. Article 12 concerns divine healing. The official church teaching is that Christ paid for all physical suffering with his atoning work and that as a consequence, when Christians get sick they can be supernaturally healed by the Holy Spirit. Article 9 reflects a non-Wesleyan perspective on sanctification. Articles 13-16 deal largely with the subject of eschatology. The Assemblies of God has a dispensationalist perspective on the future, including belief in the rapture and a literal earthly millennium. The following is a summary of the 16 Fundamental Truths:

#The Bible is inspired by God and is &quot;the infallible, authoritative rule of faith and conduct&quot;.
#There is only one true God who exists as a Trinity.
#Jesus Christ is the Son of God and, as the second person of the Trinity, is God.
#Man was created good and upright. However, man by voluntary transgression fell and thereby incurred not only physical death but also spiritual death, which is separation from God. 
#Salvation &quot;is received through repentance toward God and faith toward the Lord Jesus Christ&quot;. 
#There are two ordinances. Believer&#x27;s baptism by immersion is a declaration to the world that the believer has died and been raised together with Christ, becoming a new creation. The Lord&#x27;s Supper is a symbol expressing the believer&#x27;s sharing in the divine nature of Christ, a memorial of Christ&#x27;s suffering and death, and a prophecy of Christ&#x27;s second coming. 
#Baptism in the Holy Spirit is a separate and subsequent experience following conversion. Spirit baptism brings empowerment to live an overcoming Christian life and to be an effective witness.
#Speaking in tongues is the initial physical evidence of the baptism in the Holy Spirit.
#Sanctification is &quot;an act of separation from that which is evil, and of dedication unto God&quot;. It occurs when the believer identifies with, and has faith in, Christ in his death and resurrection. It is understood to be a process in that it requires continual yielding to the Holy Spirit.
#The Church&#x27;s mission is to seek and save all who are lost in sin; the Church is the Body of Christ and consists of all people who accept Christ, regardless of Christian denomination.
#Divinely called and scripturally-ordained ministers serve the Church.
#Divine healing of the sick is provided for in the atonement.
#The &quot;imminent and blessed hope&quot; of the Church is its rapture preceding the bodily return of Christ to earth.
#The rapture of the Church will be followed by the visible return of Christ and his reign on earth for a thousand years. 
#There will be a final judgment and eternal damnation for the &quot;wicked dead&quot;.
#There will be future new heavens and a new earth &quot;wherein dwelleth righteousness&quot;.

==History==
The Assemblies of God was founded in 1914 but it was not until 1916 that it reluctantly created the Fundamental Truths in response to several doctrinal controversies. The first controversy, referred to as the Finished work controversy, arose from disagreement over the second blessing and the practical meaning of holiness. The second or &quot;Oneness&quot; controversy questioned the baptismal formula, the doctrine of the Trinity, and the understanding of the process of salvation. The third one was over whether speaking in tongues was the &quot;initial physical evidence&quot; of Holy Spirit baptism or not. 

The outcome of these controversies, reflected in the Statement of Fundamental Truths, not only shaped the denomination but also shaped American Pentecostalism. In 1916, the General Council (the denomination&#x27;s governing body) took a strong stand against the Oneness teaching and upheld the position that speaking in tongues was the initial evidence of baptism in the Holy Spirit. The Assemblies of God remains Trinitarian and continues to affirm the doctrine of initial evidence.

===Statement on sanctification===
The position adopted in the Statement of Fundamental Truths regarding sanctification was less clear. The men behind the formation of the Assemblies of God were Pentecostals who had come to the conclusion that holiness or sanctification was not a second blessing or a definite experience but instead a lifelong process. This idea of progressive sanctification was believed by many within the Assemblies of God but there were adherents who still held to the theology of the holiness movement. 

The original language on sanctification in the Fundamental Truths was a compromise between Wesleyan and non-Wesleyan members which allowed the two doctrines to coexist. Under the heading &quot;Entire Sanctification, The Goal For All Believers&quot;, it read, &quot;Entire sanctification is the will of God for all believers, and should be earnestly pursued by walking in obedience to God&#x27;s Word&quot;. The term &quot;entire sanctification&quot; is distinctly Wesleyan, but the statement actually called &quot;for an ongoing, process of obedience in reliance on, and cooperation with the Holy Ghost&quot;.

In 1961, the General Council revised the statement significantly, giving it its current form. It eliminated some of the Wesleyan language, such as &quot;entire&quot;. Stanley M. Horton, who served on the revision committee, stated that the committee &quot;... felt that the word &quot;entire&quot; was ambiguous because we were using it with a different meaning than that promoted by holiness Pentecostals who taught a second definite work&quot;. While the current statement does represent the Assemblies of God&#x27;s position more accurately, the denomination&#x27;s teaching on sanctification remains ambiguous.

<doc id="359208" wikidata="Q684675" url="?curid=359208" title="Michel Kikoine">
<text>Michel Kikoïne (; , &quot;Michail Kikóin&quot;; 31 May 1892 – 4 November 1968) was a Lithuanian Jewish-French painter who belonged to the Ecole de Paris art movement.

== Life ==
Kikoine was born in Rechytsa, present-day Belarus. The son of a Jewish banker in the small southeastern town of Gomel, he was barely into his teens when he began studying at &quot;Kruger&#x27;s School of Drawing&quot; in Minsk. There he met Chaïm Soutine, with whom he had a lifelong friendship. At age 16, he and Soutine were studying at the Vilnius Academy of Art and in 1911 he moved to join the growing artistic community gathering in the Montparnasse quarter in Paris, France. This artistic community included his friend Soutine as well as fellow Belarus painter Pinchus Kremegne, who also had studied at the Fine Arts School in Vilnia. He enrolled in the École des Beaux-Arts in Cormon’s studio.

For a time, the young artist lived at La Ruche while studying at the École nationale supérieure des Beaux-Arts. In 1914, he married a young lady from Vilnia with whom he had a daughter and a son. Their son, Jacques Yankel, born in France in 1920, also became a painter. The same year as his marriage, Kikoine volunteered to fight in the French army, serving until the end of World War I. His first solo exhibition took place in 1919 at the Chéron Gallery.Between 1922 and 1923, he and Soutine traveled to Céret and Cagnes-sur-Mer where, where, he painted Expressionist landscapes in influence of the light.

In 1926, Kikoine bought a house in Annay-sur-Serein in Burgundy. In 1927, he left La Ruche and settled in Montrouge, subsequently returning to Montparnasse in 1933. In 1939, Kikoine was mobilized and served in the military reserve near Soissons, where he painted gouaches of garrison life. 

With the outbreak of World War II and the subsequent occupation of France by the Germans, Kikoine and his Jewish family faced deportation to the Nazi death camps. Until the end of the War they stayed near Toulouse. After the Allied liberation of France, he moved back to Paris where his paintings were primarily nudes, autoportraits, and portraits. He left the city rarely notably for a few visits to Israel, in a prominent visit in 1950, he participated in several exhibitions. In 1958, he moved to Cannes on the Mediterranean coast where he returned to landscape painting until his death on 4 November 1968.

== Career and style ==
Kikoine had his first exhibition in Paris in 1919 after which he exhibited regularly at the Salon d&#x27;Automne. His work was successful enough to provide a reasonable lifestyle for him and his family, allowing them to spend summers painting landscapes in the south of France, the most notable of which is his &quot;&quot;Paysage Cezannien&quot;,&quot; inspired by Paul Cézanne. He died in Cannes.

During his time in Paris, he was friend and a contemporary of Chaim Soutine, Isaac Frenkel Frenel, Jules Pascin and other Jewish artist of the School Of Paris.

Kikoïne found great success in Paris. He went on to exhibit internationally across Europe and in New York. He also exhibited in Israel where he stayed for several months during the 1950s.

=== Style ===
Kikoïne desired not only to describe nature but also show the unmediated experience of one in nature. And showcase nature&#x27;s passion and depth in the world. Kikoïne continued with the evolution of post-Impressionist painting whilst also expressing his own Jewish spirit, as is characteristic of the Ecole de Paris movement. It is said by that the expressionist language employed by Kikoïne (and similar to that of Soutine, Frenkel and other Jewish artists of the Ecole de Paris) was a manifestation of Jewish mysticism and the experience of Jewish existence. Furthermore it is said his art also reflected the suffering of Eastern European Jewry as well as the anxiety of a foreigner far from home, experiences he related to deeply.

== Influence ==
In 2004, at the university in Tel Aviv, Israel, a new wing in the Genia Schreiber University Art Gallery was dedicated to the memory of Kikoine.

<doc id="359215" wikidata="Q1177046" url="?curid=359215" title="David Walker (abolitionist)">
<text>David Walker (September 28, 1796August 6, 1830) was an American abolitionist, writer, and anti-slavery activist. Though his father was enslaved, his mother was free; therefore, he was free as well (&quot;partus sequitur ventrem&quot;). In 1829, while living in Boston, Massachusetts, with the assistance of the African Grand Lodge (later named Prince Hall Grand Lodge, Jurisdiction of Massachusetts), he published &quot;An Appeal to the Colored Citizens of the World&quot;, a call for black unity and a fight against slavery.

The &quot;Appeal&quot; brought attention to the abuses and inequities of slavery and the responsibility of individuals to act according to religious and political principles. At the time, some people were aghast and fearful of the reaction that the pamphlet would provoke. Southern citizens were particularly upset with Walker&#x27;s viewpoints and as a result there were laws banning circulation of &quot;seditious publications&quot; and North Carolina&#x27;s &quot;legislature enacted the most repressive measures ever passed in North Carolina to control slaves and free blacks&quot;.

His son, Edward G. Walker, was an attorney and in 1866, was one of the first two black men elected to the Massachusetts State Legislature.

==Early life and education==
Walker was born in Wilmington, North Carolina. His mother was free. His father, who had died before his birth, had been enslaved. Since American law embraced the legal principle of &quot;partus sequitur ventrem&quot;, , Walker inherited his mother&#x27;s status as a free person.

Walker found the oppression of fellow black people unbearable. &quot;If I remain in this bloody land,&quot; he later recalled thinking, &quot;I will not live long... I cannot remain where I must hear slaves&#x27; chains continually and where I must encounter the insults of their hypocritical enslavers.&quot; Consequently, as a young adult, he moved to Charleston, South Carolina, a Mecca for upwardly mobile free black people. He became affiliated with a strong African Methodist Episcopal Church (AME Church) community of activists, members of the first black denomination in the United States. He later visited and likely lived in Philadelphia, a shipbuilding center and location of an active black community, where the AME Church was founded.

==Marriage and children==
Walker settled in Boston by 1825; slavery had been abolished in Massachusetts after the American Revolutionary War. On February 23, 1826, he married Eliza Butler, the daughter of Jonas Butler. Her family was an established black family in Boston. Their children were Lydia Ann Walker (who died July 31, 1830, of lung fever at the age of one year and nine months in Boston), and Edward G. Walker (1831–1901).

==Career==
He started a used clothing store in the City Market. He next owned a clothing store on Brattle Street near the wharfs. There were three used clothing merchants, including Walker, who went to trial in 1828 for selling stolen property. The results are unknown.

He aided runaway slaves and helped the &quot;poor and needy&quot;. Walker took part in civic and religious organizations in Boston. He was involved with Prince Hall Freemasonry, an organization formed in the 1780s that stood up against discriminatory treatment of black people; became a founder of the Massachusetts General Colored Association, which opposed colonization of free American Black People to Africa; and was a member of Rev. Samuel Snowden&#x27;s Methodist church. Walker also spoke publicly against slavery and racism.

Thomas Dalton and Walker oversaw the publication of John T. Hilton&#x27;s &quot;An Address, Delivered Before the African Grand Lodge of Boston, No. 459, June 24, 1828, by John T. Hilton: On the Annual Festival, of St. John the Baptist&quot; (Boston, 1828).

Although they were not free from racist hostility and discrimination, black families in Boston lived in relatively benign conditions in the 1820s. The level of black competency and activism in Boston was particularly high. As historian Peter Hinks documents: &quot;The growth of black enclaves in various cities and towns was inseparable from the development of an educated and socially involved local black leadership.&quot; By the end of 1828, Walker had become Boston&#x27;s leading spokesman against slavery.

==&quot;Freedom&#x27;s Journal&quot;==

Walker served as a Boston subscription sales agent and a writer for New York City&#x27;s short-lived but influential &quot;Freedom&#x27;s Journal&quot; (1827–1829), the first newspaper owned and operated by African Americans.

==Walker&#x27;s &quot;Appeal&quot;==
===Publication history===

In September 1829, Walker published his appeal to African Americans, entitled &quot;Walker&#x27;s Appeal, in Four Articles; Together with a Preamble, to the Colored Citizens of the World, but in Particular, and Very Expressly, to Those of the United States of America, Written in Boston, State of Massachusetts, September 28, 1829.&quot; The first edition is quite rare; a second and then a third edition appeared in 1830. Walker&#x27;s second edition, of 1830, expressed his views even more strongly than the first edition. Walker appealed to his readers to take an active role in fighting their oppression, regardless of the risk, and to press white Americans to realize that slavery was morally and religiously repugnant.

The &quot;Appeal&quot; was semi-forgotten by 1848; a great deal of other abolitionist writing, much inspired by Walker, had appeared in those 18 years. It received a new life with its reprinting in 1848 by the black minister Henry Highland Garnet, who in another 17 years would be the first African American ever to address the U.S. Congress. Garnet included the first biography of David Walker, and a similarly themed speech of his own, his &quot;Address to the Slaves of the United States of America&quot;, which was perceived as so radical that it was rejected for publication when delivered, in 1843. The most influential white abolitionist, John Brown, played a role in getting the volume of Garnet printed.

===Core issues===

====Racism====
Walker challenged the racism of the early 19th century. He specifically targeted groups such as the American Colonization Society, which sought to deport all free and freed black people from the United States to a colony in Africa (this was how Liberia was established). He wrote against published assertions of black inferiority by the late President Thomas Jefferson, who died three years before Walker&#x27;s pamphlet was published. As Walker explained: &quot;I say, that unless we refute Mr. Jefferson&#x27;s arguments respecting us, we will only establish them.&quot;

He rejected the white assumption in the United States that dark skin was a sign of inferiority and lesser humanity. He challenged critics to show him &quot;a page of history, either sacred or profane, on which a verse can be found, which maintains that the Egyptians heaped the insupportable insult upon the children of Israel, by telling them that they were not of the human family&quot;, referring to the period when they were enslaved in Egypt.

====Equal rights====
By the 1820s and &#x27;30s, individuals and groups had emerged with degrees of commitment to equal rights for black men and women, but no national anti-slavery movement existed at the time Walker&#x27;s &quot;Appeal&quot; was published. As historian Herbert Aptheker wrote:

Aptheker was referring to the Slave Power thesis that argued slaveholders used their economic and political influence to control the United States government prior to the American Civil War. The three-fifths clause of the United States Constitution counted three-fifths of the enslaved population of a state towards its representation in Congress and the electoral college; as enslaved people could not vote, this clause amounted to additional representation for large slaveholding slaves beyond what their free populations would normally warrant. Both the Democratic and Whig parties saw abolitionism as a threat to party unity and opposed efforts to introduce slavery as an issue in national politics. Although white southerners comprised a small minority of the overall U.S. population, 11 of 15 presidents to serve prior to the Civil War came from slaveholding southern families, and none except John Adams and John Quincy Adams was elected without carrying a majority of southern electoral votes.

====Effects of slavery====
The &quot;Appeal&quot; described the pernicious effects of both slavery and the subservience of and discrimination against free black Americans. Those outside of slavery were said to need special regulation &quot;because they could not be relied on to regulate themselves and because they might overstep the boundaries society had placed around them.&quot;

===Call to action===

====Resist oppression====
In his &quot;Appeal&quot; Walker implored the black community to take action against slavery and discrimination. &quot;What gives unity to Walker&#x27;s polemic,&quot; historian Paul Goodman has argued, &quot;is the argument for racial equality and the active part to be taken by black people in achieving it.&quot; Literary scholar Chris Apap has echoed these sentiments. The &quot;Appeal&quot;, Apap has asserted, rejected the notion that the black community should do nothing more than pray for its liberation. Apap has drawn particular attention to a passage of the &quot;Appeal&quot; in which Walker encourages blacks to &quot;[n]ever make an attempt to gain freedom or natural right, from under our cruel oppressors and murderers, until you see your ways clear; when that hour arrives and you move, be not afraid or dismayed.&quot; Apap has interpreted Walker&#x27;s words as a play on the Biblical injunction to &quot;be not afraid or dismayed.&quot; As he points out, &quot;&#x27;be not afraid or dismayed&#x27; is a direct quote from 2 Chronicles 20.15, where the Israelites are told to &#x27;be not afraid or dismayed&#x27; because God would fight the battle for them and save them from their enemies without their having to lift a finger.&quot; In the Bible, all the Israelites are expected to do is pray, but Walker asserts that the black community must &quot;move.&quot; Apap insists that in prompting his readers to &quot;move&quot;, Walker rejected the notion that black people in America should &quot;sit idly by and wait for God to fight their battles — they must (and implicit in Walker&#x27;s language is the assumption that they &quot;will&quot;) take action and move to claim what is rightfully and morally theirs.&quot;

Walker&#x27;s &quot;Appeal&quot; argued that black Americans had to assume responsibility for themselves if they wanted to overcome oppression. According to historian Peter Hinks, Walker believed that the &quot;key to the uplift of the race was a zealous commitment to the tenets of individual moral improvement: education, temperance, protestant religious practice, regular work habits, and self-regulation.&quot;

&quot;America,&quot; Walker argued, &quot;is more our country, than it is the whites — we have enriched it with our &quot;blood and tears&quot;.&quot;

====Education and religion====
Education and religion were especially important to Walker. Black knowledge, he argued, would not only undermine the assertion that black people were inherently inferior; it would terrify white people. &quot;The bare name of educating the colored people,&quot; he wrote, &quot;scares our cruel oppressors almost to death.&quot; Those who were educated, Walker argued, had a special obligation to teach their brethren, and literate black people were urged to read his pamphlet to those who could not. As he explained: &quot;[i]t is expected that all colored men, women and children, of every nation, language and tongue under heaven, will try to procure a copy of this Appeal and read it, or get some one to read it to them, for it is designed more particularly for them.&quot;

Regarding religion, Walker excoriated the hypocrisy of &quot;pretended preachers of the gospel of my Master, who not only held us as their natural inheritance, but treated us with as much rigor as any Infidel or Deist in the world — just as though they were intent only on taking our blood and groans to glorify the Lord Jesus Christ.&quot; It fell upon blacks, he argued, to reject the notion that the Bible sanctioned slavery and urge whites to repent before God could punish them for their wickedness. As historian Sean Wilentz has maintained, Walker, in his &quot;Appeal&quot;, &quot;offered a version of Christianity that was purged of racist heresies, one which held that God was a God of justice to all His creatures.&quot;

===White Americans===

====Comparisons to other nations====

In the &quot;Appeal&quot;, Walker criticized white Americans by comparing their position on slavery to other groups. Walker praised the British in the work, arguing that they were &quot;the best friends the coloured people have upon earth. Though they have oppressed us a little and have colonies now in the West Indies which oppress us sorely—Yet notwithstanding they have done one hundred times more for the melioration of our condition, than all the other nations of the earth put together&quot;. In contrast, Walker denounced white Americans &quot;with their posturing religiosity and their hollow cant of freedom&quot; to &quot;the lowest reaches of hypocritical infamy&quot;.

====Opportunity for redemption====
Despite Walker&#x27;s criticism of the United States, his &quot;Appeal&quot; did not declare the nation irredeemable. He may have charged white Americans with the sin of turning &quot;colored people of these United States&quot; into &quot;the most degraded, wretched, and abject set of beings that ever lived since the world began&quot;, but as historian Sean Wilentz has argued, &quot;even in his bitterest passages Walker did not repudiate... republican principles, or his native country.&quot; Walker suggested that white Americans only needed to consider their own purported values to see the error of their ways.

====Inappropriate benevolent attitudes====
Walker asserted that white people did not deserve adulation for their willingness to free some slaves. As historian Peter Hinks has explained, Walker argued that &quot;[w]hites gave nothing to blacks upon manumission except the right to exercise the liberty they had immorally prevented them from so doing in the past. They were not giving blacks a gift but rather returning what they had stolen from them and God. To pay respect to whites as the source of freedom was thus to blaspheme God by denying that he was the source of all virtues and the only one with whom one was justified in having a relationship of obligation and debt.&quot;

===Black nationalism===
Walker has often been regarded as an abolitionist with Black nationalist views, in large measure because he envisioned a future for black Americans that included self-rule. As he wrote in the &quot;Appeal&quot;: &quot;Our sufferings will come to an end, in spite of all the Americans this side of eternity. Then we will want all the learning and talents, and perhaps more, to govern ourselves.&quot;

Scholars such as historian Sterling Stuckey have remarked upon the connection between Walker&#x27;s &quot;Appeal&quot; and black nationalism. In his 1972 study of &quot;The Ideological Origins of Black Nationalism&quot;, Stuckey suggested that Walker&#x27;s &quot;Appeal&quot; &quot;would become an ideological foundation... for Black Nationalist theory.&quot; Though some historians have said that Stuckey overstated the extent to which Walker contributed to the creation of a black nation, Thabiti Asukile, in a 1999 article on &quot;The All-Embracing Black Nationalist Theories of David Walker&#x27;s Appeal&quot;, defended Stuckey&#x27;s interpretation. Asukile writes:

===Distribution===
Walker distributed his pamphlet through black communication networks along the Atlantic coast, which included free and enslaved black civil rights activists, laborers, black church and revivalist networks, contacts with free black benevolent societies, and maroon communities.

===Reaction===

====Efforts to prevent distribution====
Southern officials worked to prevent the &quot;Appeal&quot; from reaching its residents. Black people in Charleston and New Orleans were arrested for distributing the pamphlet, while authorities in Savannah, Georgia, instituted a ban on the disembarkation of black seamen (Negro Seamen Act). This was because Southern governmental entities, particularly in port cities, were concerned about the arrival and dissemination of information that they wanted to keep from black people, both free and enslaved. Various Southern governmental bodies labeled the &quot;Appeal&quot; seditious and imposed harsh penalties on those who circulated it. Despite such efforts, Walker&#x27;s pamphlet had circulated widely by early 1830. Having failed to contain the &quot;Appeal&quot;, Southern officials criticized both the pamphlet and its author. Newspapers like the &quot;Richmond Enquirer&quot; railed against what it called Walker&#x27;s &quot;monstrous slander&quot; of the region. Outrage over the &quot;Appeal&quot; even led Georgia to announce an award of $10,000 to anyone who could hand over Walker alive, and $1,000 if dead.

====Immediate significance====
Walker&#x27;s &quot;Appeal&quot; did not gain the favor of most abolitionists or free black people because its message was considered too radical.

That said, a handful of white antislavery advocates were radicalized by the pamphlet. The &quot;Boston Evening Transcript&quot; noted in 1830 that some black people regarded the &quot;Appeal&quot; &quot;as if it were a star in the east guiding them to freedom and emancipation.&quot; White Southerners&#x27; fears about a black-led challenge to slavery—fears the &quot;Appeal&quot; stoked—came to pass just a year later in the Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion, which inspired them to adopt harsher laws in an attempt to subdue and control slaves and free black people.

William Lloyd Garrison, one of the most influential American abolitionists, began publishing &quot;The Liberator&quot; in January 1831, not long after the &quot;Appeal&quot; was published. Garrison, who believed slaveowners would be punished by God, rejected the violence Walker advocated but recognized that slaveowners were courting disaster by refusing to free their slaves. &quot;Every sentence that they write — every word that they speak — every resistance that they make, against foreign oppression, is a call upon their slaves to destroy them,&quot; Garrison wrote.

Walker&#x27;s &quot;Appeal&quot; and the slave rebellion led by Nat Turner in Virginia in 1831 struck fear into the hearts of slave owners. Though there is no evidence to suggest that the &quot;Appeal&quot; specifically informed or inspired Turner, it could have, since the two events were just a few years apart; white people were panicked about the possibility of future insurrections. Southern states passed laws restricting free black people and slaves. Many white people in Virginia and neighboring North Carolina believed that Turner was inspired by Walker&#x27;s &quot;Appeal&quot; or other abolitionist literature.

====Lasting influence====
Walker influenced Frederick Douglass, Nat Turner, William Lloyd Garrison, Martin Luther King Jr., and Malcolm X. Echoes of his &quot;Appeal&quot; can be heard, for example, in Douglass&#x27;s 1852 speech, &quot;The Meaning of the Fourth of July for the Negro&quot;:

Historian Herbert Aptheker has noted that

==Death==

Just five years after he arrived in Boston, Walker died in the summer of 1830. Though rumors suggested that he had been poisoned, Walker died a natural death from tuberculosis, as listed in his death record. The disease was prevalent and Walker&#x27;s only daughter, Lydia Ann, had died from it the week before Walker himself died. Walker was buried in a South Boston cemetery for blacks. His probable grave site remains unmarked.

When Walker died, his wife was unable to keep up the annual payments to George Parkman for the purchase of their house. She subsequently lost their home, an eventuality Walker himself had, in a sense, predicted in his &quot;Appeal&quot;:
His son Edward G. Walker (also known as Edwin G. Walker) was born after Walker&#x27;s death, and in 1866 would become the first black man elected to the Massachusetts State Legislature.

==Legacy==
As noted from the numerous sources, historians consider David Walker a major abolitionist and inspirational figure in American history.

*The Library of Congress had an exhibit, &quot;Free Blacks in the Antebellum Period,&quot; which noted Walker&#x27;s significance, along with that of other key black abolitionists: &quot;Free people of color like Richard Allen, Frederick Douglass, Sojourner Truth, David Walker, and Prince Hall earned national reputations for themselves by writing, speaking, organizing, and agitating on behalf of their enslaved compatriots.&quot;
*The National Park Service has walking tours developed for the Boston African American National Historic Site, including the black Beacon Hill community. The comprehensive narratives include discussion of David Walker, who was integral to the black neighborhood and city activists. An online version of the tour is also available.

<text>1851 in sports describes the year&#x27;s events in world sport.

==Bandy==
Events
* By the second half of the 19th century, bandy has become popular among the masses throughout the Russian Empire. Traditionally, the Russians use a longer skate blade than other nations, giving them the advantage of skating faster. However, they find it more difficult to turn quickly. A bandy skate has a longer blade than an ice hockey skate, and the &quot;Russian skate&quot; even longer.

==Baseball==
Events
* The Knickerbocker Base Ball Club of New York plays two matches with the Washington club, soon afterwards named Gotham. These are the second and third meetings between two clubs under &quot;Knickerbocker Rules&quot; after one played five years earlier. For 1851 to 1853, two annual Knicks-Gothams games are the only known matches between clubs, the Knicks winning all six.

==Boxing==
Events
* Tom Hyer announces his retirement (though he will make a brief but unsuccessful comeback in 1854) and relinquishes the Championship of America. The title is claimed by Yankee Sullivan who fought Hyer in 1849 but he is not generally recognised.
* 29 September — William Perry defends the Championship of England title against the welterweight Harry Broome at Mildenhall. Perry is disqualified in the 15th round for striking Broome while he is kneeling. Broome is the new English champion.
* 16 December — future champion Tom Paddock fights Harry Poulson at Belper in Derbyshire. Paddock wins in the 86th round but the fight ends in a riot. Paddock and Poulson are both jailed and sentenced to ten months hard labour.

==Chess==
Events
* Adolf Anderssen and Lionel Kieseritzky play the &quot;Immortal Game&quot; in London. It is an informal game played during a break in the world&#x27;s first international chess tournament, which is staged as part of the Great Exhibition.
* Anderssen wins the London tournament and, as he is one of the strongest players of his time, is considered by many to be the first World Chess Champion.

==Cricket==
Events
* 11 &amp; 12 February — Tasmania v Victoria at Launceston Racecourse is the inaugural first-class match played in Australia. Tasmania wins by 3 wickets.
England
* Most runs – George Chatterton 455 @ 19.78 (HS 88)
* Most wickets – James Grundy 114 @ 9.60 (BB 8–?)

==Horse racing==
England
* Grand National – Abd-El-Kader (second successive win)
* 1,000 Guineas Stakes – Aphrodite 
* 2,000 Guineas Stakes – Hernandez
* The Derby – Teddington
* The Oaks – Iris 
* St. Leger Stakes – Newminster

==Lacrosse==
Events
* Montreal&#x27;s Olympic Club organises a team to play a game against an indigenous team.

==Rowing==
The Boat Race
* The Oxford and Cambridge Boat Race is not held this year

==Yacht racing==
America&#x27;s Cup
* The yacht &quot;America&quot; beats the Royal Yachting Squadron in a race around the Isle of Wight, the event leading to the creation of the America&#x27;s Cup

<text>A serjeant-at-arms or sergeant-at-arms is an officer appointed by a deliberative body, usually a legislature, to keep order during its meetings. The word &quot;serjeant&quot; is derived from the Latin , which means &quot;servant&quot;. Historically, serjeants-at-arms were armed men retained by English lords and monarchs, and the ceremonial maces which they are associated with were originally a type of weapon.

==Origins==
The term &quot;sergeant&quot; can be given two main definitions: the first is a military rank; the other is a governmental role. Whereas technically the two roles were not mutually exclusive, they were very different in roles and duties. The soldier sergeant was a man of what would now be thought of as the &#x27;middle class&#x27;, fulfilling a junior role to the knight in the medieval hierarchy. Sergeants could fight either as heavy to light cavalry, or as well-trained professional infantry, either spearmen or crossbowmen. Most notable medieval mercenaries fell into the &#x27;sergeant&#x27; class, such as Flemish crossbowmen and spearmen, who were seen as reliable quality troops. The sergeant class were deemed to be &#x27;worth half of a knight&#x27; in military value. The office originated in medieval England to serve the sovereign in a police role, much like a bailiff in more recent times. Indeed, the sergeants-at-arms constitute the oldest royal bodyguard in England, dating from the time of King Richard I (around 1189) as a formed body. The title &quot;sergeant-at-arms&quot; appears during the crusades during the reign of King Philip II of France in 1192.

The sergeant-at-arms was a personal attendant upon the king, specially charged with arresting those suspected of treason. Richard I had 24 with him on the Crusades. They were formed into a twenty-strong Corps of Sergeants-at-Arms by King Edward I in 1278, as a mounted close escort. In 1399 King Richard II limited the corps to thirty sergeants, and King Charles II had sixteen. The number was reduced to eight in 1685 and since then it has gradually declined.

The original responsibilities of the sergeant-at-arms included &quot;collecting loans and, impressing men and ships, serving on local administration and in all sorts of ways interfering with local administration and justice.&quot; Around 1415, the British House of Commons received its first sergeant-at-arms. From that time onwards the sergeant has been a royal appointment, the sergeant being one of the sovereign&#x27;s sergeants-at-arms. The House of Lords has a similar officer.

The formal role of a sergeant-at-arms in modern legislative bodies is to keep order during meetings, and, if necessary, forcibly remove any members or guests who are overly rowdy or disruptive. A sergeant-at-arms may thus be a retired soldier, police officer, or other official with experience in law enforcement and security. The Sergeant-at-Arms of the House of Commons has general charge of certain administrative and custodial functions, as well as security within the chamber of the House.

==Specific countries==

===Australia===
The Australian House of Representatives operates under the Westminster parliamentary system. The serjeant-at-arms is a career officer of the Department of the House of Representatives. The ceremonial duties are as the custodian of the mace, the symbol of the authority of the Crown and the House, and as the messenger for formal messages from the House to the Senate. The serjeant has the authority to remove disorderly people, by force if necessary, from the House or the public or press galleries on the instructions of the speaker. The administrative duties of the serjeant include allocation of office accommodation, furniture and fittings for members&#x27; offices, coordination of car transport for members, mail and courier services for the House, security for the House and arrangements for school visits. Once a meeting has started in a House the serjeant will usually stand at the door to keep authority and make sure no one else comes in or out.

===Bangladesh===
The serjeant-at-arms is the senior official of the National Parliament (Jatiyo Sangshad) who is responsible for maintaining order during sessions and to maintain security and protocol at Parliament under the guidance of the speaker. Presently, Captain M M Naim Rahman (G), NGP, NCC, PSC, BN naval officer, is appointed as serjeant-at-arms.

===Canada===
The sergeant-at-arms is the senior official of the House of Commons of Canada. In this role, the sergeant-at-arms is responsible for the building services and security of the House of Commons, and is appointed by the governor general acting on the advice of the federal cabinet. The sergeant-at-arms carries the mace, the symbol of the authority of the Crown, in the daily parade into the House of Commons chamber.

Provincial legislative assemblies, houses of assembly, national assemblies, and provincial parliaments (the nomenclature for legislatures varying between provinces) also employ sergeants-at-arms.

René Jalbert, sergeant-at-arms of the National Assembly of Quebec, ended Denis Lortie&#x27;s killing spree in the Quebec Parliament Building on 8 May 1984 by constituting himself hostage and negotiating with the shooter for four hours.

During the 2014 shootings at Parliament Hill, Ottawa, the then sergeant-at-arms of the House of Commons, Kevin M. Vickers, assisted RCMP officers in engaging the gunman. Reports show that Sergeant-at-Arms Vickers, alongside RCMP Constable Curtis Barrett, shot and killed the gunman who had gained access to the Centre Block of the Canadian Parliament buildings.

===Liberia===

In addition to the president pro tempore, the Senate of Liberia elects a secretary of the Senate, assistant secretary of the Senate and a sergeant-at-arms as officers of the Senate, though these positions are not held by sitting senators.

===New Zealand===

The New Zealand House of Representatives operates under the Westminster parliamentary system. 
The current serjeant-at-arms since 2016 is Captain Steve Streefkerk, RNZN (Rtd), a permanent officer of the House supported by the Chamber and Meeting Support Team.

The serjeant-at-arms controls officials and members staff coming to the House, and the surrounding areas such as the lobbies and the members lounge. There is involvement at select committees where the chairman seeks assistance to maintain good order. The serjeant-at-arms sits in the debating chamber opposite the speaker at the visitors door for each House sitting session to ensure that security is effective, good order is maintained, administers the Members Attendance Register and takes instructions from the speaker or the other presiding officers - deputy speaker or two assistant speakers, when they are presiding.

The chamber and meeting support officers control all access to the House, and attend to the needs of the members of parliaments, and officials when the House is undertaking its business.

The gallery operation for visitors or strangers is controlled by the Parliamentary Service Security Service, but the speaker and the serjeant-at-arms have the overall authority as defined in Standing Orders.

Past serjeants-at-arms have included:
*Philip Deck, the first serjeant-at-arms, appointed in 1854
*Group Captain Alexander John Mackay Manson, from 1937 to 1965 (promoted to Usher of the Black Rod in May 1965)
*Wing Commander Bob McKay, from 1965
*Carol Rankin, the first woman to be serjeant-at-arms, appointed in 1985
*Ipi Cross
*Donald Cameron
*Fred Hutton, from 1998 to 2002
*Brent Smith, from 2003 to 2016.

===Singapore===

The Parliament of Singapore operates under the Westminster parliamentary system. The serjeant-at-arms is an officer of the parliament as defined in section 2 of the Parliament (Privileges, Immunities and Powers) Act 1962 (PPIP Act). The serjeant-at-arms is also an officer of the Security department who assist the Security Director in security matters of the Parliament matters and may be drawn from ex-police officers or ex-army personnel.

The Serjeant-at-Arms bears the authority of the Speaker of Parliament, who carries out the following duties:

# Ceremonially, acts as the custodian of the mace and lead the Speaker into the Parliament at the commencement of each Parliament sitting. The serjeant will place the mace at the stand on the table to signify that the parliament is in sitting.
# Administratively, perform access control of all persons into the Parliament House and managing the security and admissions of all staff and visitors into the Parliament.
# The Serjeant may also in accordance with sections 27 and 28 of the PPIP Act, and upon the Speaker’s authority, ensure that any person(s) responsible for any disturbances in the Parliament House to be removed from the premises.
# The Sergeant also executes the Speaker&#x27;s warrant (or &#x27;summons&#x27;) to any member of public that is required to appear before a Parliamentary Hearing Committee.
===South Africa===
The serjeant-at-arms is a member of the parliamentary staff who acts as the official guardian of the mace, a decorated rod which is the symbol of the authority of the Parliament of South Africa. The mace must be in position in the National Assembly chamber during a plenary sitting.

The serjeant-at-arms is also responsible for maintaining the attendance register of the members of House members. They must also maintain order in the House and remove people from the House as ordered by the speaker.

According to the National Assembly Rules, &quot;the Serjeant-at-Arms shall remove, or cause to be removed, any stranger from any part of a Chamber which has been set apart for members only, and also any stranger who, having been admitted into any other part of the Chamber, misconducts himself or herself or does not withdraw when strangers are ordered to withdraw.&quot;

The serjeant-at-arms is attired in a black tailcoat, waistcoat, starched white shirt, bow tie, and white gloves. The current serjeant-at-arms is Regina Mhlomi, who succeeded Godfrey Cleinwerck. The usher of the black rod is Vincent Shabalala, whose duty it is to escort the presiding officers of the National Council of Provinces into its chamber.

===Sri Lanka===

The Parliament of Sri Lanka was established in the form of the Westminster parliamentary system. The serjeant-at-arms is appointed by the secretary general of Parliament and is responsible for all ceremonial occasions as the master of ceremonies in Parliament, preservation of order, custody of the mace, security, admission of visitors, allocation of accommodation within the House and supervision of galleries. Assisting the serjeant-at-arms in his duties would be the deputy serjeant-at-arms and the assistant serjeant-at-arms.

Responsible for security, by tradition he is the only officer authorized to carry a weapon (ceremonial sword) inside the Parliament building and is assisted by the Parliament Police Division. Admission of visitors to the precincts of Parliament is controlled by the serjeant-at-arms. The serjeant-at-arms and assistant serjeant-at-arms would wear a white uniform with medal ribbons during normal sittings of parliament. On ceremonial occasions they would wear a uniform similar to a No. 1 Dress uniform of a major general in the Sri Lanka Army, with varied gorget patchs and epaulette similar to a flag officer of the Sri Lanka Navy.

During the normal sitting days of the House, the serjeant-at-arms wears a white colour uniform and on ceremonial occasions is clad with specially designed black colour ceremonial attire (equivalent to the rank of the major-general).

The first serjeant-at-arms of Parliament was M. Ismail MBE, who was appointed in 1947. Ronnie Abeysinghe was the longest serving serjeant-at-arms in the history of Sri Lanka. He held the position from 1970 to 1996. The current serjeant-at-arms is Anil P. Samarasekara.

===United Kingdom===
====Parliament====
The Serjeant at Arms of the House of Commons is responsible for security matters concerning the House of Commons. The serjeant, whilst in the Commons overseeing proceedings, can also escort members of parliament out of the chamber by order of the speaker of the House. The post dates back to 1415, and has often been held by retired military or police figures (though in recent years those from a civil service background have been appointed). The current serjeant-at-arms is Ugbana Oyet (appointed in October 2019); he was previously an electrical engineer in Parliament.

The equivalent officer for the House of Lords is the Lady (Gentleman) Usher of the Black Rod) (also known simply as &quot;Black Rod&quot;); there was formerly a separate serjeant-at-arms of the House of Lords, but the two appointments were merged in 1971 (since when the mace has routinely been carried by Black Rod&#x27;s deputy, the Yeoman Usher).

====The Royal Household==== 

In addition to the above-mentioned officers there are other serjeants-at-arms who attend the sovereign on state occasions, a remnant of the body established by Richard I (though today their role is purely ceremonial). Usually, members of the Royal Household who serve as serjeants-at-arms have had the office bestowed on them as a mark of distinction for long and meritorious service.

====Insignia====
The mace serves as a symbol of royal and parliamentary authority. Ten maces are kept in the Jewel House at the Tower of London in addition to those kept by the House of Commons, the House of Lords and the Lord Chancellor. As well as carrying their maces, on state occasions each serjeant-at-arms wears a collar of esses as a symbol of his or her office. As a testament to the symbolic power of the insignia, when the Republic of Ireland declared independence from the United Kingdom at the First Dáil in 1919, one of the first decisions declared was that there was to be &quot;no robes, no mace, no velveted sergeant-at-arms&quot;.

====City of London====

Since at least the 14th century, the Lord Mayor of London has been led by the Common Cryer and Serjeant-at-Arms, commonly called the Macebearer, carrying the Mace of the City of London. The role carries ceremonial duties, including opening proceedings and announcing the dissolution of parliament. In December 2022, Major Peter Oweh was selected to hold the position.

===United States===

The two houses of the United States Congress maintain the position of sergeant-at-arms. The sergeants are charged with the maintenance of order on the floor of the chamber (in the House, he may &quot;display&quot; the mace in front of an unruly member as an to behave); they serve with the Architect of the Capitol on the commission that oversees the United States Capitol Police and security for the Congress, and they serve a variety of other functional and ceremonial roles.

==Other bodies==
Other bodies—from state and local legislative houses (city councils, county legislatures and the like) to civic and social organizations—have created posts of sergeants-at-arms, primarily to enforce order at the direction of the chair and to assist in practical details of organizing meetings. Other duties may include the greeting of visitors or providing security. The sergeant-at-arms may be in charge of the organization&#x27;s property.

The title is also used in criminal motorcycle clubs like Hells Angels.

In large organizations, the sergeant-at-arms may have assistants.

A law enforcement officer may serve in the role of sergeant-at-arms or it may be a paid (or unpaid), permanent position in the organization.

<text>Heinrich Faber (before 1500 – 26 February 1552) was a German music theorist, composer, and Kantor.

Born in Lichtenfels, Bavaria, he was employed as a singer by Christian II of Denmark in Copenhagen, from 1515 to 1524. He later studied in Wittenberg, and is known to have lectured there, in 1551. He died in Oelsnitz.

He is known for several theoretical works, and for his beginners&#x27; textbook &quot;Compendiolum musicae&quot; of 1548, which was the most popular book in Lutheran schools during the 16th and 17th centuries, and is today an important source of two-voice compositions of the period.

The Heinrich-Faber Musikschule Lichtenfels – a musical school – is named after him.

<doc id="359224" wikidata="Q62696" url="?curid=359224" title="Fritz Thyssen">
<text>Friedrich &quot;Fritz&quot; Thyssen (9 November 1873 – 8 February 1951) was a German businessman, born into one of Germany&#x27;s leading industrial families. He was an early supporter of the Nazi Party but later broke with it.

==Youth==
Thyssen was born in Mülheim in the Ruhr area. His father, August, was head of the Thyssen mining and steelmaking company, founded by his father Friedrich and based in the Ruhr city of Duisburg. Friedrich studied mining and metallurgy in London, Liège, and Berlin, and after a short period in the German Army, joined the family business. On 18 January 1900 in Düsseldorf he married Amelie Helle or Zurhelle (Mülheim am Rhein, 11 December 1877 – Puchdorf bei Straubing, 25 August 1965), daughter of a factory owner. Their only child, Anna (Anita; later Anita Gräfin Zichy-Thyssen), was born in 1909. Thyssen again joined the army in 1914, but was soon discharged on account of a lung condition.

==Weimar Germany==
Thyssen was a German nationalist who supported Nazism, believing that limited government control of production and ownership of banking and transportation was a means of preventing the spread of full-fledged communism. In 1923, when French and Belgian troops occupied the Ruhr to punish Germany for not meeting its reparations payments in full, he took part in the nationalist resistance against the occupiers, leading the Ruhr steelmakers in refusing to co-operate in producing coal and steel for them. He was arrested, imprisoned and received a large fine for his activities, which made him a national hero. Through the 1920s, the Thyssen companies continued to expand. Thyssen took over the Thyssen companies on his father&#x27;s death in 1926, and that same year he formed United Steelworks (Vereinigte Stahlwerke AG), controlling more than 75 percent of Germany&#x27;s iron ore reserves and employing 200,000 people. He played a prominent role in German commercial life, as head of the German Iron and Steel Industry Association and the Reich Association of German Industry, and as a board member of the Reichsbank.

In 1923, Thyssen met former general Erich Ludendorff, who advised him to attend a speech given by Adolf Hitler, leader of the Nazi Party. Thyssen was impressed by Hitler and his bitter opposition to the Treaty of Versailles, and began to make large donations to the party, including 100,000 gold marks ($25,000) in 1923 to Ludendorff. In this he was unusual among German business leaders, as most were traditional conservatives who regarded the Nazis with suspicion. Thyssen&#x27;s principal motive in supporting the Nazis was his great fear of communism; he had little confidence that the various German anti-communist factions would prevent a Soviet-style revolution in Germany unless the popular appeal of communism among the lower classes was co-opted by an anticommunist alternative. Postwar investigators found that he had donated to right-wing parties, mostly to the Nazis, although Thyssen himself claimed to have donated to the Nazi Party. 
Thyssen remained a member of the German National People&#x27;s Party until 1932 and did not join the Nazi Party until 1933.

In November, 1932, Thyssen and Hjalmar Schacht were the main organisers of a letter to President Paul von Hindenburg to urge him to appoint Hitler as Chancellor. Thyssen also persuaded the Association of German Industrialists to donate three million Reichsmarks to the Nazi Party for the March 1933 Reichstag election. As a reward, he was selected to run as a Nazi candidate in the election, was elected to the Reichstag and subsequently was appointed to the Council of State of Prussia, the largest German state.

In 1933, the artist John Heartfield depicted Thyssen as the puppetmaster manipulating Hitler on the cover of communist magazine &quot;Arbeiter Illustrierte Zeitung&quot; (AIZ, Workers&#x27; Illustrated Newspaper). 

==Nazi Germany==
Thyssen welcomed the Nazi suppression of leftist organisations such as the Communist Party, the Social Democratic Party, and trade unions. In 1934, he was one of the business leaders who persuaded Hitler to suppress the SA, leading to the &quot;Night of the Long Knives&quot;. 

Thyssen became a member of Hans Frank&#x27;s Academy for German Law. He accepted the anti-Jewish legislation in pre-war Nazi Germany that excluded Jews from business and professional life, and dismissed his Jewish employees. But as a Catholic, he objected to the increasing Nazi persecution of the Catholic Church in Germany, which gathered pace after 1935: in 1937 he sent a letter to Hitler, protesting at the persecution of Christians in Germany. The breaking point for Thyssen was the violent pogrom against the Jews in November 1938, known as &quot;Kristallnacht&quot;, which caused him to resign from the Prussian Council of State. By 1939 he was also bitterly criticising Nazi economic policies, which focused on rearmament in preparation for war.

==World War II==
On 1 September 1939, the invasion of Poland marked the commencement of World War II. Thyssen sent Hermann Göring a telegram saying he was opposed to the war, shortly after arriving in Switzerland with his family. He was expelled from the Nazi Party and the Reichstag, and his company was nationalised. The company was returned to other members of the Thyssen family several years after the war.

In 1940, Thyssen took refuge and moved to France, intending to emigrate to Argentina, but was caught up in the German invasion of France and the Low Countries while he was visiting his ill mother in Belgium.

In 1941, Thyssen fled Germany,&lt;ref name=&quot;theguardian/usa.secondworldwar&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; but he was arrested by Vichy France in an hotel in Nice and sent back to Germany, where he was confined, first in a sanatorium near Berlin, then from 1943 in Sachsenhausen concentration camp. His wife Amelie did not escape to Argentina and spent the whole war in the concentration camp with her husband.

In February 1945, Thyssen was sent to Dachau concentration camp. He was comparatively well-treated and transferred to Tyrol in late-April 1945 together with other prominent inmates, where the SS left the prisoners behind. He was liberated by the 42nd Infantry Division and 45th Infantry Division on 5 May 1945.

==Later life==
Thyssen was tried for being a supporter of the Nazi Party. He did not deny that he had been a Nazi supporter until 1938, and he accepted responsibility for his companies&#x27; mistreatment of Jewish employees in the 1930s, although he denied involvement in the employment of slave labour during the war. On 2 October 1948, a denazification tribunal declared Thyssen a lesser offender and sentenced him to a fine of 15% of his assets. Thyssen agreed to pay 500,000 Deutschmarks () as compensation to those who suffered as a result of his actions, and was acquitted of other charges. 

In January 1950, he and his wife emigrated to Buenos Aires, where he died in 1951.&lt;ref name=&quot;raoul-wallenberg.eu/bush-nazi-1951&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; In 1953, Thyssen was buried in the family mausoleum in Mülheim.

==Legacy==
In 1959, Thyssen&#x27;s widow Amélie and daughter, Anita Countess Zichy-Thyssen established the Fritz Thyssen Foundation to advance science and the humanities, with a capital of 100 million Deutschmarks (equivalent to € million ). Amélie Thyssen died in 1965. Anita Countess Zichy-Thyssen ran the Foundation until her death in 1990. The family has had a dispute over the running of the Foundation.

==&quot;I Paid Hitler&quot;==

While Thyssen was imprisoned in Germany, a memoir was published in the United Kingdom and the United States, in 1941, under the title &quot;I Paid Hitler&quot;. The book was ghostwritten by the journalist Emery Reves, the memoirs are seen as unreliable by historians. Thyssen himself repeatedly denounced the authenticity of the memoirs, once referring to them as a ‘literary forgery’.&quot;

<text>Vilho Petter Nenonen (6 March 1883 – 17 February 1960) was a Finnish general of the Artillery.

Nenonen was born in Kuopio. He received his military education in the Hamina Cadet School 1896–1901, in the Mihailov Artillery School in St Petersburg 1901–1903, and in St Petersburg Artillery Academy 1906–1909. He served in the Imperial Russian army during World War I. When the Finnish Civil War began, he moved to Finland and was given the job of creating the artillery of general Mannerheim&#x27;s White Army. After the war, Nenonen also served as the Minister of Defence between 1923 and 1924. During the Continuation War, he was a part of Mannerheim&#x27;s inner circle. He was promoted to the rank of &quot;General of the artillery&quot; in 1941 and remains the only person to have held the rank.

As Finnish Defence Forces&#x27; Inspector of the Artillery, Nenonen played a large role in developing the Finnish artillery&#x27;s training, equipment, and tactics. For example, the Fire Correction Circle developed in 1943 proved decisive in the defensive victory in the Battle of Tali-Ihantala in 1944 and was made standard equipment of the Finnish artillery by an order issued by Nenonen in July 1943. The trajectory calculation formulas he developed are still in use today by all modern artillery.

Nenonen received the Mannerheim Cross in 1945.

His medals and personal history are on display in The Artillery Museum of Finland.
Nenonen is buried at the Hietaniemi Cemetery.

<doc id="359237" wikidata="Q7921930" url="?curid=359237" title="Vernacular literature">
<text>Vernacular literature is literature written in the vernacular—the speech of the &quot;common people&quot;.

In the European tradition, this effectively means literature not written in Latin nor Koine Greek. In this context, vernacular literature appeared during the Middle Ages at different periods in the various countries; the earliest European vernacular literatures are Irish literature (the earliest being Tochmarc Emire (10th century), transcribed from a lost manuscript of the 8th century), Welsh literature, English literature and Gothic literature.

The Italian poet Dante Alighieri, in his &quot;De vulgari eloquentia&quot;, was possibly the first European writer to argue cogently for the promotion of literature in the vernacular. Important early vernacular works include Dante&#x27;s &quot;Divine Comedy&quot;, Giovanni Boccaccio&#x27;s &quot;Decameron&quot; (both in Italian), John Barbour&#x27;s &quot;The Brus&quot; (in Scots), Geoffrey Chaucer&#x27;s &quot;Canterbury Tales&quot; (in Middle English) and Jacob van Maerlant&#x27;s &quot;Spieghel Historiael&quot; (in Middle Dutch). Indeed, Dante&#x27;s work actually contributed towards the creation of the Italian language. Leonardo Da Vinci used vernacular in his work.

The term is also applied to works not written in the standard and/or prestige language of their time and place. For example, many authors in Scotland, such as James Kelman and Edwin Morgan have used Scots, even though English is now the more common language of publishing in Scotland. Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o writes in his native Gikuyu language though he previously wrote in English. Some authors have written in invented vernacular; examples of such novels include the futuristic literary novels &quot;A Clockwork Orange&quot; by Anthony Burgess and &quot;Boxy an Star&quot; by Daren King.

==Outside Europe==

By extension, the term is also used to describe, for example, Chinese literature not written in classical Chinese and Indian literature after Sanskrit. In the Indian culture, traditionally religious or scholarly works were written in Prakrit, Tamil and Sanskrit. With the rise of the Bhakti movement from the 8th century on-wards, religious works began to be created in Kannada, and Telugu, and from the 12th Century onward in many other Indian languages throughout the different regions of India. For example, the Ramayana, one of Hinduism&#x27;s sacred epics in Sanskrit, had vernacular versions such as &quot;Ramacharitamanasa&quot;, an Awadhi version of the Ramayana by the 16th century poet Tulsidas. In China, the New Culture Movement of the 1910s–20s promoted vernacular literature.

In the Philippines, the term means any written literature in a language other than Filipino (or Tagalog) or English. At present, it forms the second largest corpus of literature, following the literature in Tagalog. During the Spanish colonial era, when Filipino did not yet exist as a national lingua franca, literature in this type flourished. Aside from religious literature, such as the Passiong Mahal (the Passion of Our Lord), zarzuelas were also produced using the Philippine vernacular languages.

In Arabic, vernacular literature refers to works written in dialects of Arabic as opposed to Classical Arabic or Modern Standard Arabic. For the Egyptian dialect authors include Ahmed Fouad Negm, Muhammad Husayn Haykal, and Salah Jahin. There is also a wave of modern writers.

<text>A prescription drug (also prescription medication, prescription medicine or prescription-only medication) is a pharmaceutical drug that is permitted to be dispensed only to those with a medical prescription. In contrast, over-the-counter drugs can be obtained without a prescription. The reason for this difference in substance control is the potential scope of misuse, from drug abuse to practicing medicine without a license and without sufficient education. Different jurisdictions have different definitions of what constitutes a prescription drug.

In North America, , usually printed as &quot;Rx&quot;, is used as an abbreviation of the word &quot;prescription&quot;. It is a contraction of the Latin word &quot;recipe&quot; (an imperative form of &quot;recipere&quot;) meaning &quot;take&quot;. Prescription drugs are often dispensed together with a monograph (in Europe, a Patient Information Leaflet or PIL) that gives detailed information about the drug.

The use of prescription drugs has been increasing since the 1960s.

==Regulation==
===Australia===
In Australia, the Standard for the Uniform Scheduling of Medicines and Poisons (SUSMP) governs the manufacture and supply of drugs with several categories:
* Schedule 1 – Defunct Drug.
* Schedule 2 – Pharmacy Medicine
* Schedule 3 – Pharmacist-Only Medicine
* Schedule 4 – Prescription-Only Medicine/Prescription Animal Remedy
* Schedule 5 – Caution/Poison.
* Schedule 6 – Poison
* Schedule 7 – Dangerous Poison
* Schedule 8 – Controlled Drug (Possession without authority illegal)
* Schedule 9 – Prohibited Substance (Possession illegal without a license legal only for research purposes)
* Schedule 10 – Controlled Poison.
* Unscheduled Substances.

As in other developed countries, the person requiring a prescription drug attends the clinic of a qualified health practitioner, such as a physician, who may write the prescription for the required drug.

Many prescriptions issued by health practitioners in Australia are covered by the Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme, a scheme that provides subsidised prescription drugs to residents of Australia to ensure that all Australians have affordable and reliable access to a wide range of necessary medicines. When purchasing a drug under the PBS, the consumer pays no more than the patient co-payment contribution, which, as of January 1, 2022, is A$42.50 for general patients. Those covered by government entitlements (low-income earners, welfare recipients, Health Care Card holders, etc.) and or under the Repatriation Pharmaceutical Benefits Scheme (RPBS) have a reduced co-payment, which is A$6.80 in 2022. The co-payments are compulsory and can be discounted by pharmacies up to a maximum of A$1.00 at cost to the pharmacy.

=== United Kingdom ===

In the United Kingdom, the Medicines Act 1968 and the Prescription Only Medicines (Human Use) Order 1997 contain regulations that cover the supply of sale, use, prescribing and production of medicines. There are three categories of medicine:
* Prescription-only medicines (POM), which may be dispensed (sold in the case of a private prescription) by a pharmacist only to those to whom they have been prescribed
* Pharmacy medicines (P), which may be sold by a pharmacist without a prescription
* General sales list (GSL) medicines, which may be sold without a prescription in any shop

The simple possession of a prescription-only medicine without a prescription is legal unless it is covered by the Misuse of Drugs Act 1971.

A patient visits a medical practitioner or dentist, who may prescribe drugs and certain other medical items, such as blood glucose-testing equipment for diabetics. Also, qualified and experienced nurses, paramedics and pharmacists may be independent prescribers. Both may prescribe all POMs (including controlled drugs), but may not prescribe Schedule 1 controlled drugs, and 3 listed controlled drugs for the treatment of addiction; which is similar to doctors, who require a special licence from the Home Office to prescribe schedule 1 drugs. Schedule 1 drugs have little or no medical benefit, hence their limitations on prescribing. District nurses and health visitors have had limited prescribing rights since the mid-1990s; until then, prescriptions for dressings and simple medicines had to be signed by a doctor. Once issued, a prescription is taken by the patient to a pharmacy, which dispenses the medicine.

Most prescriptions are NHS prescriptions, subject to a standard charge that is unrelated to what is dispensed. The NHS prescription fee was increased to £9.90 for each item in England in May 2024; prescriptions are free of charge if prescribed and dispensed in Scotland, Wales and Northern Ireland, and for some patients in England, such as inpatients, children, those over 60s or with certain medical conditions, and claimants of certain benefits. The pharmacy charges the NHS the actual cost of the medicine, which may vary from a few pence to hundreds of pounds. A patient can consolidate prescription charges by using a prescription payment certificate (informally a &quot;season ticket&quot;), effectively capping costs at £31.25 a quarter or £111.60 for a year.

Outside the NHS, private prescriptions are issued by private medical practitioner and sometimes under the NHS for medicines that are not covered by the NHS. A patient pays the pharmacy the normal price for medicine prescribed outside the NHS.

Survey results published by Ipsos MORI in 2008 found that around 800,000 people in England were not collecting prescriptions or getting them dispensed because of the cost, the same as in 2001.

===United States===

In the United States, the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act defines what substances, known as legend drugs, require a prescription for them to be dispensed by a pharmacy. The federal government authorizes physicians (of any specialty), physician assistants, nurse practitioners and other advanced practice nurses, veterinarians, dentists, and optometrists to prescribe any controlled substance. They are issued unique DEA numbers. Many other mental and physical health technicians, including basic-level registered nurses, medical assistants, emergency medical technicians, most psychologists, and social workers, are not authorized to prescribe legend drugs.

The federal Controlled Substances Act (CSA) was enacted in 1970. It regulates manufacture, importation, possession, use, and distribution of &quot;controlled&quot; substances, which are drugs with potential for abuse or addiction. The legislation classifies these drugs into five schedules, with varying qualifications for each schedule. The schedules are designated schedule I, schedule II, schedule III, schedule IV, and schedule V. Many drugs other than controlled substances require a prescription.

The safety and the effectiveness of prescription drugs in the US are regulated by the 1987 Prescription Drug Marketing Act (PDMA). The Food and Drug Administration (FDA) is charged with implementing the law.

As a general rule, &quot;over-the-counter drugs&quot; (OTC) are used to treat a condition that does not need care from a healthcare professional if have been proven to meet higher safety standards for self-medication by patients. Often, a lower strength of a drug will be approved for OTC use, but higher strengths require a prescription to be obtained; a notable case is ibuprofen, which has been widely available as an OTC pain killer since the mid-1980s, but it is available by prescription in doses up to four times the OTC dose for severe pain that is not adequately controlled by the OTC strength.

Herbal preparations, amino acids, vitamins, minerals, and other food supplements are regulated by the FDA as dietary supplements. Because specific health claims cannot be made, the consumer must make informed decisions when purchasing such products.

By law, American pharmacies operated by &quot;membership clubs&quot; such as Costco and Sam&#x27;s Club must allow non-members to use their pharmacy services and may not charge more for these services than they charge as their members.

Physicians may legally prescribe drugs for uses other than those specified in the FDA approval, known as off-label use. Drug companies, however, are prohibited from marketing their drugs for off-label uses.

Some prescription drugs are commonly abused, particularly those marketed as analgesics, including fentanyl (Duragesic), hydrocodone (Vicodin), oxycodone (OxyContin), oxymorphone (Opana), propoxyphene (Darvon), hydromorphone (Dilaudid), meperidine (Demerol), and diphenoxylate (Lomotil).

Some prescription painkillers have been found to be addictive, and unintentional poisoning deaths in the United States have skyrocketed since the 1990s according to the National Safety Council. Prescriber education guidelines as well as patient education, prescription drug monitoring programs and regulation of pain clinics are regulatory tactics which have been used to curtail opioid use and misuse.

====Expiration date====
The expiration date, required in several countries, specifies the date up to which the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of a drug. In the United States, expiration dates are determined by regulations established by the FDA. The FDA advises consumers not to use products after their expiration dates.

A study conducted by the U.S. Food and Drug Administration covered over 100 drugs, prescription and over-the-counter. The results showed that about 90% of them were safe and effective far past their original expiration date. At least one drug worked 15 years after its expiration date. Joel Davis, a former FDA expiration-date compliance chief, said that with a handful of exceptions—notably nitroglycerin, insulin, and some liquid antibiotics (outdated tetracyclines can cause Fanconi syndrome)—most expired drugs are probably effective.

The American Medical Association issued a report and statement on Pharmaceutical Expiration Dates. The Harvard Medical School Family Health Guide notes that, with rare exceptions, &quot;it&#x27;s true the effectiveness of a drug may decrease over time, but much of the original potency still remains even a decade after the expiration date&quot;.

The expiration date is the final day that the manufacturer guarantees the full potency and safety of a medication. Drug expiration dates exist on most medication labels, including prescription, over-the-counter and dietary supplements. U.S. pharmaceutical manufacturers are required by law to place expiration dates on prescription products prior to marketing. For legal and liability reasons, manufacturers will not make recommendations about the stability of drugs past the original expiration date.

==Cost==
Prices of prescription drugs vary widely around the world. Prescription costs for biosimilar and generic drugs are usually less than brand names, but the cost is different from one pharmacy to another.

To lower prescription drug costs, some U.S. states have sought federal approval to buy drugs in Canada, as of 2022.

Generics undergo strict scrutiny to meet the equal efficacy, safety, dosage, strength, stability, and quality of brand name drugs. Generics are developed after the brand name has already been established, and so generic drug approval in many aspects has a shortened approval process because it replicates the brand name drug.

Brand name drugs cost more due to time, money, and resources that drug companies invest in them to conduct development, including clinical trials that the FDA requires for the drug to be marketed. Because drug companies have to invest more in research costs to do this, brand name drug prices are much higher when sold to consumers.

When the patent expires for a brand name drug, generic versions of that drug are produced by other companies and are sold for lower price. By switching to generic prescription drugs, patients can save significant amounts of money: e.g. one study by the FDA showed an example with more than 52% savings of a consumer&#x27;s overall costs of their prescription drugs.

== Strategies to limit drug prices in the United States ==
In the United States there are many resources available to patients to lower the costs of medication. These include copayments, coinsurance, and deductibles. The Medicaid Drug Rebate Program is another example.

Generic drug programs lower the amount of money patients have to pay when picking up their prescription at the pharmacy. As their name implies, they only cover generic drugs.

Co-pay assistance programs are programs that help patients lower the costs of specialty medications; i.e., medications that are on restricted formularies, have limited distribution, and/or have no generic version available. These medications can include drugs for HIV, hepatitis C, and multiple sclerosis. Patient Assistance Program Center (RxAssist) has a list of foundations that provide co-pay assistance programs. Co-pay assistance programs are for under-insured patients. Patients without insurance are not eligible for this resource; however, they may be eligible for patient assistance programs.

Patient assistance programs are funded by the manufacturer of the medication. Patients can often apply to these programs through the manufacturer&#x27;s website. This type of assistance program is one of the few options available to uninsured patients.

The out-of-pocket cost for patients enrolled in co-pay assistance or patient assistance programs is $0. It is a major resource to help lower costs of medicationshowever, many providers and patients are not aware of these resources.

== Environment ==
Traces of prescription drugsincluding antibiotics, anti-convulsants, mood stabilizers and sex hormoneshave been detected in drinking water. Pharmaceutically active compounds (PhACs) discarded from human therapy and their metabolites may not be eliminated entirely by sewage treatment plants and have been detected at low concentrations in surface waters downstream from those plants. The continuous discarding of incompletely treated water may interact with other environmental chemicals and lead to uncertain ecological effects. Due to most pharmaceuticals being highly soluble, fish and other aquatic organisms are susceptible to their effects. The long-term effects of pharmaceuticals in the environment may affect survival and reproduction of such organisms. However, levels of medical drug waste in the water is at a low enough level that it is not a direct concern to human health. However, processes, such as biomagnification, are potential human health concerns.

On the other hand, there is clear evidence of harm to aquatic animals and fauna. Recent advancements in technology have allowed scientists to detect smaller, trace quantities of pharmaceuticals in the ng/ml range. Despite being found at low concentrations, female hormonal contraceptives may cause feminizing effects on male vertebrate species, such as fish, frogs and crocodiles. 

The FDA established guidelines in 2007 to inform consumers should dispose of prescription drugs. When medications do not include specific disposal instructions, patients should not flush medications in the toilet, but instead use medication take-back programs to reduce the amount of pharmaceutical waste in sewage and landfills. If no take-back programs are available, prescription drugs can be discarded in household trash after they are crushed or dissolved and then mixed in a separate container or sealable bag with undesirable substances like cat litter or other unappealing material (to discourage consumption).

<text>East Ham is a district of the London Borough of Newham, England, 8 miles (12.8 km) east of Charing Cross. Within the boundaries of the historic county of Essex, East Ham is identified in the London Plan as a Major Centre. The population is 76,186.

==History==

===Toponymy===
The first known written use of the term, as &#x27;Hamme&#x27;, is in an Anglo-Saxon charter of 958, in which King Edgar granted the Manor of Ham, which was undivided at that time, to Ealdorman Athelstan. A subsequent charter on 1037 describes a transfer of land, which has been identified with East Ham, indicating that the first division of the territory occurred between 958 and 1037.

The place name derives from Old English &#x27;hamm&#x27; and means &#x27;a dry area of land between rivers or marshland&#x27;, referring to the location of the settlement within boundaries formed by the rivers Lea, Thames and Roding and their marshes. North Woolwich seems likely to have been removed from Ham in the aftermath of the Norman Conquest.

The earliest recorded use of the name East Ham, as distinct from Ham or West Ham, is in 1204 as &quot;EstHam&quot;; the terms East and West Ham applying to Ancient parishes in place by the end of the 12th century.

===Administration and representation===
East Ham was originally part of the hundred of Becontree, part of the historic county of Essex. East Ham Local Government District was created in 1878, when the ancient parish of East Ham adopted the Local Government Act 1858 and formed a local board of nine members to govern the area. In 1886 the local government district was extended to include the civil parish of Little Ilford (also known as Manor Park), and the board was increased to 12 in number. The Local Government Act 1894 reconstituted the area as East Ham Urban District, with an elected urban district council of 15 members replacing the board. In 1900, Little Ilford civil parish was abolished and its area absorbed into an enlarged East Ham civil parish.

The &quot;East Ham Urban District&quot; of Essex was incorporated as a Municipal Borough on 10 August 1903. As a result of popular pressure, East Ham sought and obtained county borough status on 1 April 1915. In 1965, under the London Government Act 1963, it was abolished and merged with the County Borough of West Ham to form the London Borough of Newham.

The principal offices of Newham Council were at the junction of Barking Road and High Street South in the former East Ham Town Hall, a Grade II listed Edwardian structure designed by A. H. Campbell, H. Cheers and J. Smith, which included a landmark clock tower. Built between 1901 and 1903, Passmore Edwards opened the Town Hall on 5 February 1903. Most council departments moved to Newham Dockside (Building 1000, Dockside Road E16) in 2010.

East Ham is also the name of a parliamentary House of Commons constituency East Ham, which covers East Ham and neighbouring areas. The current Member of Parliament (MP) is Stephen Timms.

===Early history===
Boleyn Castle on Green Street was built in the 16th century and survived until the 1950s.
===Economic development===
In 1859 East Ham railway station opened and, although in 1863 the area was still being described as a &quot;scattered village&quot; the availability of transport resulted in increasing urbanisation, especially from 1890 onwards. The electric services of the District Railway first served East Ham in 1908.

===WWI – East Ham Pals===

In 1915, the Mayor and Borough of East Ham raised a Pals battalion of local men. The unit became the 32nd (East Ham) battalion of the Royal Fusiliers (City of London Regiment). The battalion was assigned to the 124th Brigade, part of the 41st Division and served on the Western and Italian fronts. A full strength infantry battalion of the timed totalled around 1,036 men, and the East Ham Pals are recorded as losing 444 by the time the battalion was disbanded in March 1918. The disbandment occurred as the British Army was so short of manpower that it could no longer maintain as many units, the surviving members of the East Ham battalion were re-assigned to other units to bring them up to strength.

==Geography==
Housing in East Ham consists principally of Victorian and Edwardian terraced town houses, often in tree-lined avenues.

There are many green spaces in the otherwise bustling and urbanised area of East Ham. The graveyard of the Norman St Mary&#x27;s church, is maintained as a nature reserve, the largest of its kind in Greater London. Central Park (Central Park Road) and Plashet Park (Plashet Grove) are the two largest parks in East Ham, and both combine open space with playgrounds and cafés. There are also smaller play areas and parks, including Priory Park (Grangewood Street) and Flanders Field, where England football captain Bobby Moore played as a child during the late 1940s and early 1950s. Flanders Fields is currently the home ground of Flanders FC and other is used by Bonny Downs Community Association (BDCA) and other community groups.

Much of the area is part of the E6 postal district, though post codes are not intended to define districts.

===Demography===

East Ham is a multicultural area, with many Caribbean, South Asian, African and eastern European residents. As of 2010, East Ham has the fourth-highest level of unemployment in the UK, with 16.5% of all residents registered unemployed. Around 7 in 10 children living in East Ham are from low income families, making it one of the worst areas in the country for child poverty.

In the 2011 UK Census, 90.8% of East Ham North ward was of BAME (Black, Asian and minority ethnic) background, and 89.9% of Green Street East was BAME. These are the 3rd and 4th highest figures in all of Greater London, only behind Southall Broadway and Southall Green. The figure for East Ham Central was 81.9%.

The Wall End ward (eastern parts of East Ham) had a crime rate of 46.6% in 2014-15, far below the average for both Newham and Greater London.

===Religion===
There are numerous places of worship for many different religions, ranging from St. Michael&#x27;s Church to Kensington Avenue Temple. The Parish Church of St Mary Magdalene dates to the first half of the 12th century and is claimed to be the oldest parish church still in use in Greater London. It contains a memorial to an Edmond Nevill, who laid claim to the attainted title of Earl of Westmoreland in the 17th century. There are two Hindu temples in the area; one dedicated to Mahalakshmi and the other to Murugan. The latter temple was recently rebuilt with a larger prayer hall and traditional temple tower as is typical of Tamil temples in South Asia.

<doc id="359250" wikidata="Q372222" url="?curid=359250" title="Human-readable medium and data">
<text>In computing, a human-readable medium or human-readable format is any encoding of data or information that can be naturally read by humans, resulting in human-readable data. It is often encoded as ASCII or Unicode text, rather than as binary data. 

In most contexts, the alternative to a human-readable representation is a &quot;machine-readable format&quot; or medium of data primarily designed for reading by electronic, mechanical or optical devices, or computers. For example, Universal Product Code (UPC) barcodes are very difficult to read for humans, but very effective and reliable with the proper equipment, whereas the strings of numerals that commonly accompany the label are the human-readable form of the barcode information. Since any type of data encoding can be parsed by a suitably programmed computer, the decision to use binary encoding rather than text encoding is usually made to conserve storage space. Encoding data in a binary format typically requires fewer bytes of storage and increases efficiency of access (input and output) by eliminating format parsing or conversion.

With the advent of standardized, highly structured markup languages, such as Extensible Markup Language (XML), the decreasing costs of data storage, and faster and cheaper data communication networks, compromises between human-readability and machine-readability are now more common-place than they were in the past. This has led to humane markup languages and modern configuration file formats that are far easier for humans to read.
In addition, these structured representations can be compressed very effectively for transmission or storage.

Human-readable protocols greatly reduce the cost of debugging.

Various organizations have standardized the definition of human-readable and machine-readable data and how they are applied in their respective fields of application, e.g., the Universal Postal Union.

Often the term &quot;human-readable&quot; is also used to describe shorter names or strings, that are easier to comprehend or to remember than long, complex syntax notations, such as some Uniform Resource Locator strings.

Occasionally &quot;human-readable&quot; is used to describe ways of encoding an arbitrary integer into a long series of English words.
Compared to decimal or other compact binary-to-text encoding systems,
English words are easier for humans to read, remember, and type in.

<text>The Soke of Peterborough is a historic area of England associated with the City and Diocese of Peterborough. It was part of Northamptonshire, but was administered by its own county council, while the rest of Northamptonshire was administered by Northamptonshire County Council. The Soke was also described as the Liberty of Peterborough, or as the Nassaburgh hundred, and comprised, besides Peterborough, about thirty parishes. The Soke was abolished in 1965. 

The area formed much of the present City of Peterborough unitary authority area in the post-1974 ceremonial county of Cambridgeshire. The Church of England dioceses of Peterborough and Ely still, however, follow the boundary of the Soke, with only the part of the city that is north of the River Nene lying within the Diocese of Peterborough, while urban areas south of the Nene, including Stanground and Fletton, are in the Diocese of Ely.

The term &quot;soke&quot; refers to a general legal term in medieval England referring to various concepts, including a jurisdiction of land or rights to hold a court or receive fines.

==History==
In the Anglo-Saxon period, the lord of the hundred had the power, or liberty, of holding a court and administering justice within its boundaries, and this system was subsequently continued by the Abbots of Peterborough, who either enforced in person, as lords, the observance of the ancient socage laws and customs, or appointed a deputy to act for them. On the establishment of quarter sessions in 1349, the separate jurisdiction of the Soke was still maintained as distinct from that of the county of Northampton; and, except for parliamentary purposes and matters relating to the militia, it was entirely independent of that county. Quarter sessions for the liberty were held at the Sessions House in Peterborough, and petty sessions at the same place.

The civil government of the liberty was vested in the Marquess of Exeter, as Lord Paramount of Peterborough and custos rotulorum; around 40 magistrates appointed by the crown; and a high bailiff of the city appointed by the dean and chapter of Peterborough Cathedral. The soke had its own magistrates, who were appointed by the lord paramount, acting under a commission of oyer and terminer, and gaol delivery, as well as under the ordinary commission, and the magistrates for the liberty retained the power of hanging a criminal in cases of murder, which in fact they exercised so late as 1812. The Local Jurisdictions Act 1820, though giving the liberty bench the power to commit (for murder only) to the Northampton county assizes, did not abridge their full rights of gaol delivery. The soke had also a separate rate, out of which all payments were made.

In the provisions of the County and Borough Police Act 1856 (19 &amp; 20 Vict. c. 69), the Weights and Measures Act 1878 (41 &amp; 42 Vict. c. 49) and the Contagious Diseases (Animals) Act 1878 (41 &amp; 42 Vict. c. 74), the Liberty of Peterborough, like that of the Isle of Ely, was in each instance treated as a separate county.
Under the 1856 act a police force, the Liberty of Peterborough Constabulary, was appointed by and under the control of the magistrates of the soke. In 1874, the City of Peterborough was granted a charter of incorporation, under which a separate Peterborough City Police was overseen by the watch committee of the new city council. The Liberty Constabulary and City Police were amalgamated in 1947 to form the Peterborough Combined Police Force.

==Government==

===Quarter sessions===

The liberty justices in quarter sessions had long-held powers in excess of those of most other quarter sessions. They could try and decide many serious crimes, including treason and murder, which normally could only be heard and determined in a court of assize, and in view of the special powers of the liberty justices, a judge of assize had no power to act in the Soke of Peterborough. Until the time of the Dissolution of the Monasteries, the abbot had been empowered to appoint justices of the peace for the Hundred, or Liberty, of Nassaburgh. When Peterborough Monastery was dissolved in 1539 Abbot Chambers was made the first Bishop of Peterborough, and the following year Henry VIII granted three Commissions of the Peace to the coterminous Liberty of Peterborough. They were:
*The Commission of the Peace for the appointment of Justices to sit in Petty Sessional Courts and exercise the ordinary duties of the magistracy;
*The Commission for Gaol Delivery, and
*The Commission of Oyer and Terminer, that is to hear and determine, which empowered the Justices of the Liberty to hear assize offences at Quarter Sessions.
The last commission gave to the justices of the liberty, power to enquire more fully &quot;... by the oath of good and lawful men of the Liberty of Peterborough, by whom the truth of the matter may be better known and by other ways, means and methods by which they shall or better know, of the treasons ... insurrections ... rebellions, counterfeitings, clippings, wastings, false comings ... murders, felonies, manslaughters ... and many other grave offences mentioned therein which in other counties are only triable by a judge of assize, and the Justices are commanded at days appointed for this purpose to make diligent enquiries into and to hear and determine the above mentioned offences.&quot;

In 1877 Queen Victoria confirmed these commissions and endorsed the ancient privileges of jurisdiction of the liberty justices and at the same time excluded the High Sheriff of Northamptonshire from exercising his authority in the soke. The commissions of oyer and terminer and gaol delivery were not renewed by the monarchs immediately succeeding Queen Victoria and in 1920 the Court of Criminal Appeal quashed a conviction recorded at Peterborough Quarter Sessions. It was held that three of the liberty magistrates adjudicating at the hearing were not in order, as the assize authority of the court then derived from commissions granted during the reign of Queen Victoria. The three justices in question had been appointed to the commission of the peace subsequent to her death and only justices appointed during her reign were in order in adjudicating at such a court. This resulted in a renewal of the commissions in continuation of the ancient assize jurisdiction, and an announcement was made at the Easter Quarter Sessions in 1921 that &quot;whatever may have happened as a result of a recent case in the Court of Criminal Appeal by authority of this Commission now granted, this Court will continue to exercise this ancient jurisdiction in the same manner as it has done under similar commissions since the days of Charles I.&quot; In fact, the justices of the liberty did not exercise their full powers, although they were always jealous of their special and historic privileges. 

In 1949, the Marquess of Exeter moved an amendment in the House of Lords to the Justices of the Peace Bill. This was necessary to safeguard the special position of the liberty jurisdiction as the new Bill provided there should be a separate commission of the peace for every administrative county and county borough and not for any other area. Accordingly, an amendment was accepted by the Lord Chancellor and the following paragraph was included in the Act:
In accepting the amendment the Lord Chancellor said that in murder cases this ancient jurisdiction had survived all these years only because it had never been exercised and he added, &quot;if the justices ever appear to act upon the powers they possess, I shall be the first to come and remove those powers for them.&quot;

The courts of assize and quarter sessions were eventually abolished in England and Wales by the Courts Act 1971 and replaced by a single permanent Crown Court.

===Administrative county===

Under an amendment by Lord Exeter to the Local Government Act 1888, the Soke became a separate administrative county in its own right, distinct from the remainder of Northamptonshire. An elected county council, consisting of a chairman, 10 aldermen, and 30 councillors, took over the administrative functions of the Quarter Sessions and had its meetings at the Guildhall; but this formal change hid a great deal of continuity, as Justices of the Peace were often elected councillors, the Clerk of the Peace became the Clerk to the Council and so on. During its life the county council gradually acquired more powers, such as taking over the functions of school boards in 1902, boards of guardians in 1930 and various town planning and housing responsibilities from 1949. As the fire authority, under the Fire Services Act 1947, the county council also retained Peterborough Volunteer Fire Brigade, one of the few of its kind.

The Soke county council was granted a coat of arms by the College of Arms in 1950. The design placed the crossed keys of Saint Peter from the arms of the Diocese of Peterborough on the silver and blue barry field of the arms of the Cecil family, Marquesses of Exeter, who held the chairmanship of the council for most of its existence. The crest was an ermine lion from the Cecil arms rising from a mural crown emblematic of local government. The lion held two wheatears, symbolising agriculture. The Latin motto adopted by the council was &quot;Cor Unum&quot;, part of the Cecil motto &quot;Cor Unum, Via Una&quot; or &quot;One Heart, One Way&quot;.

The Local Government Act 1894 divided the Soke into three districts; the existent city (1541) and municipal borough (1874) of Peterborough, and the two rural districts of Peterborough and Barnack. The administrative county had an area of approximately 83 ½ square miles (216.37 km2) with only one, minor, boundary change in its lifetime. The county&#x27;s population recorded at each census since 1901 was as follows: 

In 1961, the last year for which figures are available, the breakdown was as follows:

The Soke had a very small population for a county and so, in 1965, the administration was merged with that of the neighbouring small county of Huntingdonshire, to form the slightly more viable administrative county of Huntingdon and Peterborough (population 202,622 in 1971). Under the 1974 local government reorganisation, Huntingdon and Peterborough became part of the non-metropolitan county of Cambridgeshire (population 436,441 in 1981), as had first been proposed in 1947 and an area broadly corresponding to the Soke, called the City of Peterborough, became one of its six districts. When the new Cambridgeshire county council was granted arms in 1976 it included references to those of the Soke; two keys around the neck of the dexter supporter and the motto, &quot;Corde Uno Sapientes Simus&quot;, or &quot;With One Heart Let Us Be Men of Understanding&quot;.

In 1998 the City of Peterborough became a unitary authority, but it continues to form part of Cambridgeshire for ceremonial purposes. Because of intervening development and a new town project in Peterborough, the present district has a much larger population than the Soke had.

==Politics==

For parliamentary purposes, the city formed a borough &quot;by prescription,&quot; returning two Members of Parliament (MPs) from 1541, with the rest of the Soke being part of Northamptonshire parliamentary county. The Great Reform Act did not affect the borough, while the rural portion of the Soke was included in the northern division of Northamptonshire. The borough&#x27;s representation was reduced to one member under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885. In 1918 a new borough constituency was formed including the whole of the Soke and neighbouring parts of the administrative county of Northamptonshire. In 1948 the boundaries of the constituency were adjusted to correspond to those of the Soke and they remained much the same until 1970.

In the unreformed House of Commons in order to be either a candidate or an elector for a county seat, a man had to own (not rent) freehold property valued for the land tax at two pounds a year (women could neither vote nor stand for election). This was known as the 40 shilling freehold. The franchise for borough seats varied enormously. Peterborough was one of 37 boroughs in which suffrage was restricted to those paying scot and lot, a form of municipal taxation. In 1800 there were 2,000 registered voters in Northamptonshire and 400 in Peterborough. By 1835 this had risen to 576, or about one per cent of the population. The Fourth Reform Act widened suffrage by abolishing practically all property qualifications for men and by enfranchising women over 30 who met minimum property qualifications. This system, known as universal manhood suffrage, was first used in the 1918 general election.

<text>Lamont Herbert Dozier (; June 16, 1941 – August 8, 2022) was an American singer, songwriter, and record producer from Detroit. He co-wrote and produced 14 US &quot;Billboard&quot; number-one hits and four number ones in the UK.

==Career==
Dozier was a member of Holland–Dozier–Holland, the songwriting and production team responsible for much of the Motown sound and numerous hit records by artists such as Martha and the Vandellas, The Supremes, The Four Tops, and The Isley Brothers. Along with Brian Holland, Dozier served as the team&#x27;s musical arranger and producer, while Eddie Holland concentrated mainly on lyrics and vocal production. Along with the Holland Brothers, Dozier followed his work for Motown Records as founder and owner of Invictus Records and Hot Wax Records, producing top-charting hits for acts Freda Payne, Honey Cone, Chairmen of the Board, and 100 Proof Aged in Soul.

===Early years===
Dozier recorded a few unsuccessful records for various Detroit labels before the trio started working together as a writing and production team for Motown in 1962. They first made their mark the following year with Martha and The Vandellas&#x27; early hits, including &quot;Come and Get These Memories&quot; (number 6 R&amp;B), &quot;Heatwave&quot; (number 1 R&amp;B, number 4 pop), and &quot;Quicksand&quot; (number 8 pop).

In 1964, &quot;Where Did Our Love Go&quot; became the first of ten number 1 pop hits which Holland–Dozier–Holland would write and produce for the Supremes over the next three years or so. After Holland–Dozier–Holland left Motown in 1968 to form the Invictus and Hot Wax labels, Dozier began recording as an artist on their labels. The most successful song was &quot;Why Can&#x27;t We Be Lovers&quot; (number 9 &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B). Dozier departed from Holland–Dozier–Holland in 1973, and was replaced by new arranger-producer Harold Beatty.

===Performer===
Dozier went on to record a number of albums as a performer in his own right, also writing much of the material. The 1977 album, &quot;Peddlin&#x27; Music on the Side&quot; (Warner Bros. Records) contained &quot;Going Back to My Roots&quot;, which was later recorded by Odyssey. The earlier &quot;Out Here On My Own&quot; (Probe Records) featured the single &quot;Fish Ain&#x27;t Bitin (#4 R&amp;B, No. 26 pop).

He had his biggest hit with 1974&#x27;s &quot;Trying to Hold on to My Woman&quot; (ABC), which reached No. 15 on the pop chart and No. 4 on the R&amp;B chart. For the second season of the TV sitcom &quot;That&#x27;s My Mama&quot; (ABC, 1975), Dozier wrote and sang the theme song, replacing the first season&#x27;s instrumental only theme music. In 1981, he scored a beach music hit with &quot;Cool Me Out&quot; and also in that year released the single &quot;Shout About It&quot; from his LP &quot;Lamont&quot;. This track had considerable airplay on UK soul radio stations as well as being promoted by UK DJ Robbie Vincent in the early 1980s to a British audience.

===Composer===
Dozier had another number-one hit as a songwriter in the 1980s, joining with Phil Collins to write the song &quot;Two Hearts&quot; for the movie soundtrack for &quot;Buster&quot;. &quot;Two Hearts&quot; received a Golden Globe Award for Best Original Song, tying with &quot;Let the River Run&quot; from &quot;Working Girl&quot; by Carly Simon; an Academy Award nomination for Best Original Song; and a Grammy Award for Best Song Written Specifically for a Motion Picture or Television. Collins and Dozier also co-wrote &quot;Loco in Acapulco&quot; for The Four Tops, which is also featured on the &quot;Buster Soundtrack&quot;.

In 1984, Essex, England-born singer Alison Moyet scored a U.S. top-40 hit with the Dozier-penned &quot;Invisible&quot;. Three years later, Dozier cowrote &quot;Infidelity&quot; and &quot;Suffer&quot; with Simply Red frontman Mick Hucknall for the British pop-soul band&#x27;s second album, &quot;Men and Women&quot;. In 1989, they teamed again to write &quot;You&#x27;ve Got It&quot; and &quot;Turn It Up&quot; for Simply Red&#x27;s follow-up LP, &quot;A New Flame&quot;.

In 1987, Lamont Dozier composed alone a song for the soundtrack of another film: the song &quot;Without You&quot;, which was recorded as a duet by the R&amp;B singers Peabo Bryson and Regina Belle, to be the love theme from the comedy film &quot;Leonard Part 6&quot;, released the same year. The song was released as a single and entered the United States and United Kingdom music charts, peaked at No. 8 on the Adult Contemporary Tracks, No. 14 on the R&amp;B chart, No. 85 on the UK Singles, and No. 89 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 (1987–88). &quot;Without You&quot; was also recorded for the Peabo Bryson album &quot;Positive&quot;, released in 1988.

&quot;Without You&quot; also received two adaptations: the first was in Portuguese and the second was in Spanish, in 1989 and 1990, respectively. Both adaptations received the title &quot;Amor Dividido&quot; and were recorded by the Brazilian singer Rosana; The Spanish version of &quot;Amor Dividido&quot; was performed as a duet by Rosanah Fienngo (known mononymously as Rosana) with the Mexican singer Emmanuel.

He&#x27;s one of the many writers on &quot;&quot;.

==Awards and honors==
Dozier and the Holland brothers were inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame in 1990.

In 2009, he worked on the music for the musical stage version of the 1996 movie &quot;The First Wives Club&quot;. He also taught credit courses on popular music as an Artist-in-Residence Professor on the faculty at the University of Southern California Thornton School of Music in 2008.

==Personal life and death==
Dozier was married three times and had six children. His first two marriages, to Elizabeth Ann Brown and to Daphne Dumas, both ended in divorce. His third marriage, to Barbara Ullman, lasted from 1980 until her death in 2021. They had three children. Dozier died at his home near Scottsdale, Arizona, on August 8, 2022, at the age of 81.

<text>The SWORD Project is the CrossWire Bible Society&#x27;s free software project. Its purpose is to create cross-platform open-source tools—covered by the GNU General Public License—that allow programmers and Bible societies to write new Bible software more quickly and easily.

==Overview==
The core of The SWORD Project is a cross-platform library written in C++, providing access, search functions and other utilities to a growing collection of over 200 texts in over 50 languages. Any software based on their API can use this collection.

JSword is a separate implementation, written in Java, which reproduces most of the API features of the C++ API and supports most SWORD data content.

The project is one of the primary implementers of and contributors to the Open Scripture Information Standard (OSIS), a standardized XML language for the encoding of scripture. The software is also capable of utilizing certain resources encoded in using the Text Encoding Initiative (TEI) format and maintains deprecated support for Theological Markup Language (ThML) and General Bible Format (GBF).

==Bible study front-end applications==

A variety of front ends based on The SWORD Project are available:

<text>The Malvern Hills are in the English counties of Worcestershire, Herefordshire and a small area of northern Gloucestershire, dominating the surrounding countryside and the towns and villages of the district of Malvern. The highest summit affords a panorama of the Severn Valley, the hills of Herefordshire and the Welsh mountains, parts of thirteen counties, the Bristol Channel, and the cathedrals of Worcester, Gloucester and Hereford.

They are known for their spring water – initially from holy wells, and later the spa town of Great Malvern, which led to the production of the modern bottled drinking water.

The Malvern Hills have been designated as a biological and geological Site of Special Scientific Interest, and by Natural England as National Character Area 103 and an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

Management of the area is the responsibility of the Malvern Hills Trust.

==Toponymy==
The name &quot;Malvern&quot; is first attested in a charter of around 1030, as &quot;Mælfern&quot;, and then in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Malferna&quot;. The name derives from the Common Brittonic words that survive in modern Welsh as (&quot;bare&quot;) and (&quot;hill&quot;); thus it once meant &quot;bare hill&quot;. The name perhaps applied originally to the hill now called Worcester Beacon, after which Great Malvern was then named; Great Malvern in turn then gave its name to the whole range of hills beside which it lies. The name &quot;Malvern Hills&quot; is first attested in the fourteenth-century poem &quot;Piers Plowman&quot;.

==Geography==
The Malvern Hills are part of an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, with scenic views over both Herefordshire and Worcestershire. The Hills run north–south for about , in between Great Malvern and the village of Colwall, and overlook the River Severn valley to the east, with the Cotswolds beyond. The highest point of the hills is the Worcestershire Beacon at above sea level (OS Grid reference SO768452). The hills are famous for their natural mineral springs and wells, which were responsible for the development of Great Malvern as a spa in the early 19th century. Malvern water was bottled commercially on a large scale and sold worldwide.

There are three passes over the hills, the Wyche cutting, the A438 road north of Raggedstone Hill and the A449 road just north of the Herefordshire Beacon, the site of the British Camp, an Iron Age hillfort at the top of the hill, subsequently extended by a medieval castle. The extensive earthworks remain clearly visible today and determine the shape of the hill.

==Geology==

The Malvern Hills are formed of some of the most ancient rocks in England, mostly igneous and metamorphic rocks from the late Precambrian, known as the Uriconian, which are around 680 million years old.
The Malvern Line or Malvern Lineament is the name applied to a north–south aligned lineament which runs through the Malvern Hills and extends southwards towards Bristol and northwards past Kidderminster. It consists of a series of faults and folds which have the effect of bringing old Malvernian rocks to the surface. Being largely hard igneous rocks, they have resisted erosion better than those of the surrounding countryside and result in a striking line of hills of which the Malvern Hills are the most impressive. This line is considered to mark the edge of two terranes – two once separate fragments of the Earth&#x27;s crust now joined as one – the Wrekin terrane to the west and the Charnwood terrane to the east.

The main face of Gullet Quarry shows a cross-section through the Precambrian rock and exhibits many rock types including diorite, granite, gneiss, schist, pegmatite and dolerite. The evidence of the complex history of earth movements which formed the Hills can be seen by multiple joints, fractures, faults and shears, which make identifying changes in rock types difficult. Mineral deposits such as haematite, calcite and epidote can be seen within these features.

There is a tiny, man-made cave near the ridge of the hills called Clutter&#x27;s Cave (or Giant&#x27;s Cave or Hermit&#x27;s Cave or Waum&#x27;s Cave, after Walm&#x27;s Well which is located on the boundary of News Wood below). The cave has been excavated into pillow lavas. Some of the rounded &#x27;pillow&#x27; shapes are still visible around the entrance to the cave.

===Malvern water===


The quality of Malvern water is attributable to its source. The rocks of the Malvern Hills are amongst the oldest and hardest found in England; the geology is responsible for the quality of Malvern&#x27;s spring water. The hills consist of Precambrian igneous and metamorphic rock, the oldest of which are about 670 million years old. The rocks are characterised by low porosity and high secondary permeability via fissures. Malvern water is rainwater and snow meltwater that percolates through fissures created by the pressures of tectonic movements about 300 million years ago when advancing sedimentary layers of Silurian shale and limestone were pushed into and under older Precambrian rock. When the fissures are saturated, a water table forms and the water emerges as springs around the fault lines between the strata. Depending on rainfall, the flow can vary from as little as per minute to over per minute. The water permeates through the rock which, because of its hardness, leaves little or no mineral traces in the water, while at the same time the very fine cracks act as a filter for other impurities. Rainfall on the Malvern Hills is thought to be sufficient to account for all the water that runs out of the springs, reflected for example in some spring flows six to eight weeks after heavy rainfall, and in reduced flows after a dry period.

==Ecology==
The Malvern Hills have been designated as a Site of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) by Natural England and an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty by the Countryside Agency (now Natural England).

Features of the Malvern Hills AONB include wide areas of acid grassland and heath on the summit and mixed broadleaved woodland and Ancient Semi-Natural Woodland on the lower hills and valleys. There are three areas of Ancient Semi-Natural Woodland in the Malvern Hills SSSI: Hollybush Roughs between the boundary of Castlemorton Common and the Midsummer Hill fort, Park Wood in West Malvern and an area near Holy Well above Malvern Wells.

Key AONB species include dormouse, barbastelle, skylark, high brown fritillary butterfly, great crested newt, adder and black poplar.

==History==

Flint axes, arrowheads, and flakes found in the area are attributed to early Bronze Age settlers, and the &#x27;Shire Ditch&#x27;, a late Bronze Age boundary earthwork possibly dating from around 1000 BC, was constructed along part of the crest of the hills near the site of later settlements. The Wyche Cutting, a mountain pass through the hills was in use in prehistoric times as part of the salt route from Droitwich to South Wales. A 19th-century discovery of over two hundred metal money bars suggests that the area had been inhabited by the La Tène people around 250 BC. Ancient folklore has it that the British chieftain Caractacus made his last stand against the Romans at the British Camp, a site of extensive Iron Age earthworks on a summit of the Malvern Hills close to where Malvern was to be later established. The story remains disputed, however, as Roman historian Tacitus implies a site closer to the river Severn. There is therefore no evidence that Roman presence ended the prehistoric settlement at British Camp. However, excavations at nearby Midsummer Hillfort, Bredon Hill and Croft Ambrey all show evidence of violent destruction around the year 48 AD. This may suggest that the British Camp was abandoned or destroyed around the same time.
During the medieval period, the hills and surrounding area were part of a royal forest known as Malvern Chase. Riots by commoners and legal challenges from land owners ensued when King Charles I attempted to disafforest the Chase in 1630. Ultimately, only one third was disafforested, and commissioners were appointed to ensure any further encroachments did not leave the common lands as the most meagre in quality. This system lasted until the 1800s.

In 1884, the Malvern Hills Conservators were established through an Act of Parliament to preserve the natural aspect of the hills and protect them from encroachments. However, by this time large-scale quarrying had already begun. Quarry works were set in motion in the 1870s at Tank Quarry and at Little Malvern by Pyx Granite Company. The Hills Conservators lobbied parliament to pass an Act limiting the exploitation, and although a second Act was passed in 1924 its provisions were largely ineffective. Quarrying continued until 1966. The landscape itself was irrevocably changed; but there is some debate whether this has enriched or damaged the ecology of the Hills. Certainly the quarrying has changed the Hills forever, including creating habitats for frogs, toads, newts and other small animals. The new cliffs provide nesting sites for certain birds. The quarries, especially North Quarry and Tank Quarry, have over the years been the sites of several accidents requiring the Emergency Services.

In 1989, the cafe on Worcestershire Beacon burned down. As the Malvern Hills Acts state that no building should be erected on the Conservators&#x27; land or on land under their jurisdiction, the Conservators put a bill through Parliament to get the power to build a new one but the House of Lords opposed it. When the cafe was burned down, the Conservators had plans to replace the building but were advised that they risked prosecution for rebuilding as the original cafe building was an encroachment on common land. The Malvern Hills Bill was in preparation to modernise some of the clauses in previous acts a clause was inserted to gain authority to rebuild the cafe.
Five members of the House of Lords Select Committee visited the Malvern Hills and decided that there were enough facilities in the immediate area and that St Ann&#x27;s Well cafe should be enough provision on the hills, so the application to rebuild was turned down.

In 2000, a £1.3 million project to reintroduce grazing animals to the Malvern Hills and restore part of its historic network of water spouts was given significant backing of National Lottery funds. The Malverns Heritage Project aimed to reintroduce grazing animals as a natural means of scrub management and restore several water features. The project was spearheaded by the Malvern Hills AONB Service, in partnership with Worcestershire County Council, Herefordshire Council, Malvern Hills Conservators, Malvern Spa Association, English Nature, Countryside Agency, National Trust and English Heritage. Members of the public were concerned that by erecting temporary fences on the Malvern Hills the Conservators would be straying from their core duty of keeping the Malvern Hills unenclosed as open spaces for the recreation and enjoyment of the public. Although the conservation officer said any enclosures would be small and temporary there were worries that leisure activities could be affected and that &quot;the feeling of freedom associated with &#x27;just being&#x27; on the Malvern Hills&quot; could be lost.

In 2001, the Malvern Hills were officially closed to the public for the first time in history. Walkers were told to avoid the area as part of the effort to prevent the spread of foot and mouth disease. As a result of the closure the economy of the Malvern Hills faced serious damage. In 2002 the Malvern Hills were named the most popular free tourist attraction in the West Midlands in a survey commissioned by the Countryside Agency to take the temperature of rural tourism in the wake of the crisis.

In 2006, Worcestershire County Council was awarded £770,000 by the Heritage Lottery Fund for restoration work and preservation of the area by fitting cattle grids to roads across the Hills and encouraging local landowners to allow sheep to wander across their land. As part of the Malvern Heritage Project nine water features within the AONB were also renovated.

==Governance==

The &quot;Malvern Hills Trust&quot; is the working name for the Malvern Hills Conservators and manages most parts of the Hills and the surrounding Commons, some other parcels of land and many roadside verges. They were established in 1884 and are governed by five Acts of Parliament, the &quot;Malvern Hills Acts&quot; 1884, 1909, 1924, 1930 and 1995. They are a voluntary body of twenty-nine members. Eleven are directly elected under the Local Elections (Principal areas) Rules by the residents of the wards who contribute to the Conservators&#x27; funds through a levy in their Council Tax, seventeen are appointed by local authorities and one by the Church Commissioners. The total area under their jurisdiction is over .

The Malvern Hills were designated an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty (AONB) in 1959. The designation covers and includes parts of Herefordshire, Worcestershire and Gloucestershire. The Malvern Hills Conservators played a key role in ensuring that the area of the AONB is larger than that originally proposed.

The AONB Partnership work together to conserve and enhance the Malvern Hills AONB. The Partnership has a formal structure including representatives from private and public enterprises, officers from local authorities, the Countryside Agency and the Malvern Hills Conservators.

==Sport, leisure, and tourism==

The Malvern Hills are home to a wide range of outdoor sports and leisure activities, including walking, mountain biking, horse riding, orienteering, hang-gliding, paragliding, model aircraft flying, fishing, climbing and diving.

The Worcestershire Way is a waymarked long-distance trail located within the county of Worcestershire. It runs from Bewdley to Great Malvern. It is an important recreation resource in the AONB.

The Geopark Way is a long-distance trail which runs from Bridgnorth to Gloucester and passes through the Abberley and Malvern Hills Geopark. The route was devised to highlight geology, landscape and associated heritage. The Malvern Hills Geocentre is located halfway along the Geopark Way, at the Wyche. This official visitor centre gives more information on interactive iPads about the geology, nature and history of the Geopark and the Malvern hills and Malvern in particular, as well as large wall maps of the area.

==Abberley and Malvern Hills Geopark==
The Abberley and Malvern Hills Geopark was launched in 2004. It falls within the counties of Herefordshire, Gloucestershire, Shropshire and Worcestershire and covers . The geological and geomorphological significance of the area has been recognised for many years with 13 Sites of Special Scientific Interest (SSSI) and 179 Local Geological Sites (LGS) present.

==Transport==

===Trunk roads===

The A449 road runs through the centre of Malvern, connecting it to Worcester and Ledbury. The M5 motorway to the east of Malvern is accessible at junctions 7 and 8. The M50 (also known as the &quot;Ross Spur&quot;) to the south can be accessed at junction 1 on the A38 road between Tewkesbury and Malvern.

===Rail===

The Cotswold railway line was originally intended to follow a flatter and more direct route north of the area, but after lobbying from residents throughout the 1850s, the railway was diverted close to - and under - the hills, to serve Malvern and Ledbury. The route passes east and south of Malvern on the Worcestershire side of the hills, crosses the range through the Colwall Tunnels, and emerges heading west on the Herefordshire side. The first tunnel was opened in 1861 after a difficult excavation through some of the hardest rock in Great Britain - following advances in machinery development, it was closed and replaced with a wider, less steep tunnel in 1926, which remains in use today. There have been proposals to reopen the abandoned older tunnel as a cycle route; it is also used by a colony of lesser horseshoe bats to hibernate in winter, and is a designated part of the Malvern Hills SSSI.

Today, the AONB has four railway stations inside or very close to its boundary: Malvern Link and Great Malvern to the east, and Colwall (just beyond the tunnel) and Ledbury to the west. Services operate between via Worcester Shrub Hill and Worcester Foregate Street to . Direct trains to the area are available from Birmingham Snow Hill or Birmingham New Street and London Paddington. There were also formerly small stations at Malvern Hanley Road, Ledbury Town Halt and Malvern Wells, which closed in 1952, 1959 and 1965 respectively.

===Bus===

Several local bus services connect Malvern with the surrounding area. Long-distance direct bus services connect Malvern with other cities in the country, including the National Express route 321 through eleven counties from Aberdare, South Wales, via Birmingham and other major cities to Bradford, West Yorkshire, and route 444 from Worcester to London (Victoria).

==Malvern Hills in cultural life==

===Music===

English composer Edward Elgar, who was from the area, often walked, cycled, and reportedly flew kites on these hills. He wrote a cantata in 1898 entitled &quot;Caractacus&quot;, which alludes to the popular legend of his last stand at British Camp. In 1934, during the composer&#x27;s final illness, he told a friend: &quot;If ever after I&#x27;m dead you hear someone whistling this tune [from his Cello Concerto] on the Malvern Hills, don&#x27;t be alarmed, it&#x27;s only me.&quot;

Composers Herbert Howells and Ivor Gurney used to take long walks together through the nearby Cotswold Hills and the natural beauty of the area, including the magnificent views of the Malverns, was a profound inspiration for their music. Howells dedicated his first major work, the Piano Quartet in A minor (1916), to &quot;the hill at Chosen (Churchdown) and Ivor Gurney who knew it&quot;.

The Swedish singer Jenny Lind spent the last years of her life living at Wynd&#x27;s Point near the British Camp. She is buried in Great Malvern cemetery.

===Literature===

The Malvern Hills were the inspiration and setting for the famous 14th-century poem &quot;The Visions of Piers Plowman&quot; (1362) by William Langland, who was possibly educated at the priory of Great Malvern. The earliest poetical allusion to the Malvern Hills occurs in the poem: &quot;And on a Maye mornynge on Malverne hylles&quot;.

The poet W. H. Auden taught for three years at The Downs School, Colwall, in the Malvern Hills. He spent three years at the school in the 1930s and wrote some of his finest early love poems there, including: &quot;This Lunar Beauty&quot;; &quot;Lay Your Sleeping Head, My Love&quot; (&#x27;Lullaby&#x27;); &quot;My Love, Fish in the Unruffled Lakes&quot;; and &quot;Out on the Lawn I Lie in Bed&quot;. He also wrote a long poem about the hills and their views, called simply &quot;The Malverns&quot;.

J.R.R. Tolkien found inspiration in the Malvern landscape which he had viewed from his childhood home in Birmingham and his brother Hilary&#x27;s home near Evesham. He was introduced to the area by C. S. Lewis, who had brought him here to meet George Sayer, the Head of English at Malvern College. Sayer had been a student of Lewis, and became his biographer, and together with them Tolkien would walk the Malvern Hills. Recordings of Tolkien reading excerpts from &quot;The Hobbit&quot; and &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot; were made in Malvern in 1952, at the home of George Sayer. The recordings were later issued on long-playing gramophone records. In the liner notes for &quot;J.R.R. Tolkien Reads and Sings his The Hobbit &amp; The Fellowship of the Ring&quot;, George Sayer wrote that Tolkien would relive the book as they walked and compared parts of the Malvern Hills to the White Mountains of Gondor.

The poet Elizabeth Barrett Browning spent her childhood at Hope End, a 500-acre (2.0 km2) estate near the Malvern Hills in Ledbury, Herefordshire. Her time at Hope End would inspire her in later life to write &quot;Aurora Leigh&quot;.

In &quot;Early British Trackways&quot; Alfred Watkins theorised that a ley line passed along the Malvern Hills through several wells including St Ann&#x27;s Well, Holy Well, Walms Well and St. Pewtress Well. Interest in Watkin&#x27;s theories subsided in the 1930s but saw a revival in the late 1960s. In &quot;The Ley Hunter&#x27;s Companion&quot; (1979) Paul Devereux theorised that a 10-mile alignment he called the &quot;Malvern Ley&quot; passed through St Ann&#x27;s Well, the Wyche Cutting, a section of the Shire Ditch, Midsummer Hill, Whiteleaved Oak, Redmarley D&#x27;Abitot and Pauntley. In &quot;City of Revelation&quot; (1973) British author John Michell theorised that Whiteleaved Oak is the centre of a circular alignment he called the &quot;Circle of Perpetual Choirs&quot; and is equidistant from Glastonbury, Stonehenge, Goring-on-Thames and Llantwit Major. The theory was investigated by the British Society of Dowsers and used as background material by Phil Rickman in his novel &quot;The Remains of an Altar&quot; (2006).
&quot;Malvern Hills&quot; is the third short story in Japanese-English author Kazuo Ishiguro&#x27;s collection &quot;Nocturnes&quot; (2009).

The legend of the Shadow of the Ragged Stone, a shadow appearing to arise from the hilltop under particular meteorological conditions said to bring ill-fortune to those on whom it falls, features in many literary sources. It is the subject of the novel &quot;The Shadow of the Ragged Stone&quot; by Charles F. Grindrod, which tells the story of a monk who in punishment for breaking his vow of chastity was compelled to crawl up the hill every day on his hands and knees, and died cursing the hill and all on whom its shadow should fall.

===Art===
Paintings of the Malvern Hills include Henry Harris Lines&#x27;s &quot;The British Camp and Herefordshire Beacon&quot; (1872), now in the Worcester City Museums.

David Prentice, founder member of Birmingham&#x27;s Ikon Gallery, has been painting the Malvern Hills since 1986.

Paul Nash made paintings of the hills from &#x27;Madams&#x27; in Gloucestershire and from the &#x27;Rising Sun&#x27; hotel on Cleeve Hill near Cheltenham.

Dame Laura Knight painted in a studio near Wynds Point below British Camp.

===Television===

The opening scene in &quot;Elgar&quot;, a drama documentary made in 1962 by the British director Ken Russell, depicts a young Elgar riding a white pony over the Malvern Hills. Made for BBC Television&#x27;s long-running &quot;Monitor&quot; programme, it dramatised the life of the composer Edward Elgar. The film significantly raised the public profile of the composer.

The Tank Quarry on North Hill and West of England Quarry on the Worcestershire Beacon were used as locations in the &quot;Doctor Who&quot; serial &quot;The Krotons&quot;, starring Patrick Troughton. The serial was broadcast in four weekly parts from 28 December 1968 to 18 January 1969.

The Malvern Hills are the backdrop for &quot;Penda&#x27;s Fen&quot;, a 1974 British television play written by David Rudkin and directed by Alan Clarke for the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Play for Today&quot; series. It tells the story of Stephen, a pastor&#x27;s son who has visions of angels, Edward Elgar, and King Penda, the last pagan ruler of England.
 The final scene of the play, where the protagonist has an apparitional experience of King Penda and the &quot;mother and father of England&quot;, is set on the Malvern Hills.

===Architecture===

A famous historic Virginia Landmark, Malvern Hill was a house built in the 17th century by an English settler, Thomas Cocke, later the site of an American Civil War battle. Cocke named his home after Malvern Hills in England.

==The hills==
A list of the hills in their order from north to south is shown below:

A good panorama of the length of the hills can be seen from the M5 motorway, particularly between Junction 7 at Worcester (south) and Junction 9 at Tewkesbury.

==Vistas==
Between 1999 and 2000, the Heart of England Tourist Board carried out a survey of visitors to the Malvern hills on behalf of the Malvern Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty Partnership (AONB). Those questioned indicated that the thing they liked most about the hills was &quot;the scenery and views&quot;.

The AONB commissioned study to &quot;identify and assess a selection of key views to and from the Malvern Hills&quot; it was carried out in 2009 by Cooper Partnership Ltd, a firm of Chartered Landscape Architects.
This information was gathered not only so that the best vistas could be made known to a wider public, but also as an intelligence gathering so that proposed changes to the landscape both in and outside the Malvern Hills area of outstanding beauty (such as the building of wind turbines) could be assessed against the impact those developments would have on the Malvern Hills area of outstanding beauty.
The Cooper Partnership identified 50 key views from vantage points on the Malvern hills, and from the surrounding area. These were:

<text>Huntingdon and Peterborough was a short-lived administrative and geographical county in East Anglia in the United Kingdom. It existed from 1965 to 1974, when it became part of Cambridgeshire.

==Formation==
The Local Government Act 1888 created four small neighbouring administrative counties in the east of England: Cambridgeshire, Isle of Ely, Huntingdonshire, and the Soke of Peterborough. Following the Second World War, a Local Government Boundary Commission was formed to review county-level administration in England and Wales. The commission was of the opinion that counties needed to have a population of between 200,000 and one million in order to provide effective services. Accordingly, they recommended the amalgamation of all four counties into a single entity. The commission&#x27;s recommendations were not carried out, however.

The reform of local government was returned to in 1958, with the appointment of a Local Government Commission for England. The four counties were included in the East Midlands General Review Area, and the LGCE made its draft proposals in 1960. The commission identified particular problems in the administration of the Soke of Peterborough, where 80% of the population of the county lay within the City of Peterborough, which was itself seeking county borough status. The LGCE concluded that the Soke was too small to continue as a separate county, and needed to become part of a larger authority. Accordingly, the draft proposals were to combine the Isle of Ely, Huntingdonshire and the Soke of Peterborough with Cambridgeshire (less the City of Cambridge).

There was considerable opposition to the draft proposals, and the LGCE instead opted in its final report in 1961 to create two counties: Huntingdon and Peterborough, and Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely. The Huntingdon and Peterborough Order was made on 14 February 1964, and placed before the House of Commons on 9 March 1964. The amalgamation was welcomed by David Renton, the member of parliament (MP) for Huntingdonshire, who felt that &quot;The new county will have very good communications and a great community of interest. It will be a compact and convenient local government unit.&quot; The order was approved by 143 votes to 83.

The new county was formed on 1 April 1965 from the areas of the administrative counties of Huntingdonshire and Soke of Peterborough (with minor boundary changes) and Thorney Rural District from the Isle of Ely. As well as becoming an administrative county, Huntingdon and Peterborough also became a county for other statutory purposes. Accordingly, the Lord Lieutenant of Huntingdonshire became Lord Lieutenant of Huntingdon and Peterborough, with Peterborough ceasing to be part of the geographical county of Northamptonshire. A high sheriff was also appointed to the new county, and a single commission of peace and court of quarter sessions established.

The county&#x27;s population, as recorded at the ten-yearly census, was 202,622 in 1971.

===Emergency services===
On the creation of the county, an order under the Police Act 1964 came into force creating the Mid-Anglia Constabulary by merging the Cambridge City Police, Cambridgeshire County Constabulary, Isle of Ely Constabulary, Huntingdonshire Constabulary, and the Peterborough Combined Police Force (created in 1947 from the Liberty of Peterborough Constabulary and the Peterborough City Police). On further local government reform in 1974, the present Cambridgeshire Constabulary was formed with the same boundaries.

The Huntingdon and Peterborough Fire Brigade was formed on the same date by the merger of Huntingdonshire Fire Brigade and the Soke of Peterborough Fire Brigade. Since 1974 this has formed part of Cambridgeshire Fire and Rescue Service.

==Districts==
The county was divided into thirteen local government districts: three municipal boroughs, three urban districts and seven rural districts. Each of these existed as subdivisions of the predecessor counties.

==Coat of arms==
Huntingdon and Peterborough County Council was granted armorial bearings by the College of Arms on 3 April 1965. The blazon was as follows:

&quot;Barry argent and azure on a fess embattled vert a cornucopia between two garbs or; and for a crest issuant from a mural crown or a demi lion gules gorged with a collar flory counterflory and supporting a staff or, flying therefrom a banner vert charged with two keys in saltire or; mantled azure, doubled argent. And for supporters on the dexter side a pikeman of the New Model Army supporting with the exterior hand a pike, and on the sinister side a mitred abbot in processional vestments for St Peter&#x27;s Day supporting with the exterior hand a crosier and sudarium all proper. Badge: Two keys in saltire surmounted by a buglehorn or the strings azure interlaced with the keys.&quot;

The arms and crest were a combination of the arms previously used by Huntingdonshire and Soke of Peterborough County Councils. To these were added supporters: a pikeman of the New Model Army for the Cromwellian associations of Huntingdonshire, and a mitred abbot for the origins of the Soke as territory administered by Peterborough Abbey.

The Latin motto adopted by the council – &quot;Cor Unum&quot;, or &quot;One Heart –&quot; was formerly that of the Soke.

==Abolition==
The county had only a nine-year existence. In 1974 the Local Government Act 1972 completely reformed administrative structures throughout England and Wales excluding Greater London. A system of metropolitan and non-metropolitan counties, each divided into districts, was introduced. Huntingdon and Peterborough was merged with neighbouring Cambridgeshire and Isle of Ely to form the new enlarged non-metropolitan county (and lieutenancy) of Cambridgeshire, first proposed in 1947. Peterborough and Huntingdon became two of the county&#x27;s six districts; in 1984, following a resolution of the council, the latter district was renamed Huntingdonshire.

==Legacy==
There is now a Hunts &amp; Peterborough County Rugby Union that takes all the teams from each area and has representative teams for Youth rugby.

<doc id="359277" wikidata="Q5583793" url="?curid=359277" title="Goofy Gophers">
<text>The Goofy Gophers are animated cartoon characters in Warner Bros.&#x27; &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; and &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; series of cartoons. The gophers are small and brown with tan bellies and buck teeth. They both have British accents. Unnamed in the theatrical cartoons, they were given the names Mac and Tosh in the 1960s TV show &quot;The Bugs Bunny Show&quot;. The names are a pun on the surname &quot;Macintosh&quot;. They are characterized by an abnormally high level of politeness.

==Creation==
The Goofy Gophers were created by Warners animator Bob Clampett for the 1947 short film &quot;The Goofy Gophers&quot;. Norman McCabe had previously used a pair of gophers in his 1942 short &quot;Gopher Goofy&quot;, but they bear little resemblance to Clampett&#x27;s characters. Clampett left the studio before the short was finished, but would end up being completed by Arthur Davis. The cartoon features the gophers&#x27; repeated incursions into a vegetable garden guarded by an unnamed dog whom they relentlessly, though politely, torment. Voice actor Mel Blanc plays Mac and Stan Freberg plays Tosh. Both speak with high-pitched British accents like those used in upper-class stereotypes around at the time.

The pair&#x27;s dialogue is peppered with such overpoliteness as &quot;Indubitably!&quot;, &quot;You first, my dear,&quot; and &quot;But, no, no, no. It must be you who goes first!&quot; The two often also tend to quote Shakespeare and use humorous elocution; for example, in &quot;Lumber Jerks&quot;, they say &quot;We must take vital steps to reclaim our property,&quot; rather than use what some may consider to be a simpler phrase. Clampett later stated that the gophers&#x27; mannerisms were derived from character actors Franklin Pangborn and Edward Everett Horton.

==Development==
Arthur Davis would direct one other Goofy Gophers short, 1948&#x27;s &quot;Two Gophers from Texas&quot;. The unnamed dog from the first cartoon returns as their nemesis in this cartoon, this time aiming to eat like an animal in the wild as he pursues the gophers with a gopher cookbook in hand.

Davis planned to direct a third short with the gophers before his unit was disbanded in late 1949. Robert McKimson however, would complete the cartoon as &quot;A Ham in a Role&quot;. In this short, the dog efforts to become a Shakespearean actor are foiled by the rambunctious rodents.

The Gophers lay dormant for two years until Friz Freleng made a series of four shorts beginning with 1951&#x27;s &quot;A Bone for a Bone&quot;, another dog-versus-gophers short. This was followed by &quot;I Gopher You&quot; in 1954, featuring the Gophers in their first cartoon without the dog, attempting to retrieve their vegetables from a food processing plant; &quot;Pests for Guests&quot; in 1955, which has the gophers counter-antagonize the hapless Elmer Fudd when he buys a chest of drawers that they found appropriate for nut storage; and &quot;Lumber Jerks&quot; later that year, where the Gophers visit a saw mill in an attempt to retrieve their stolen tree home.

After Freleng finished with the characters, they would star in two more cartoons, once again directed by McKimson. These two cartoons, &quot;Gopher Broke&quot; in 1958 and &quot;Tease for Two&quot; in 1965, pit the Gophers against the Barnyard Dawg and Daffy Duck, respectively. Both gophers were voiced by Mel Blanc in the latter short instead of one by Blanc and the other by Freberg.

==Later appearances==
The Goofy Gophers were largely forgotten by Warner Bros. in the years since the animation studio closed in 1969. However, in recent years, they have made a few cameos in various Warner Bros. projects. Two characters resembling the gophers appeared in the 1988 film &quot;Who Framed Roger Rabbit&quot;, peeking from the brick wall into the factory where Judge Doom was defeated. They are seen briefly in the 1996 movie &quot;Space Jam&quot;. They&#x27;re prominently featured in episodes of the animated series &quot;The Sylvester and Tweety Mysteries&quot; (&quot;I Gopher You&quot;) and &quot;Duck Dodgers&quot; (&quot;K-9 Kaddy&quot; and &quot;Old McDodgers&quot;), the latter of which sees them reinvented as green-furred, six-limbed Martian gophers.

The Goofy Gophers made a cameo appearance in &quot;Bah, Humduck! A Looney Tunes Christmas&quot; as Daffy&#x27;s employers.

The Goofy Gophers were revived in &quot;The Looney Tunes Show&quot; voiced by Rob Paulsen and Jess Harnell. In this show, Mac and Tosh run an antique store. The gophers appeared in the 2015 DTV movie &quot;Looney Tunes: Rabbits Run&quot;. They also appear in the &quot;Looney Tunes&quot; comic currently published by DC Comics.

The Goofy Gophers appeared in the &quot;New Looney Tunes&quot; season 3 episode &quot;Fool&#x27;s Gold&quot;.

The Goofy Gophers made a cameo in the &quot;Looney Tunes Cartoons&quot; short &quot;Happy Birthday, Bugs Bunny!&quot;

The Goofy Gophers appeared in &quot;Bugs Bunny Builders&quot; in the episode &quot;Rock On.&quot;

<text>The Alliance Party of Northern Ireland (APNI), or simply Alliance, is a liberal and centrist political party in Northern Ireland. Following the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election, it was the third-largest party in the Northern Ireland Assembly, holding seventeen seats, and broke through by achieving third place in first preference votes in the 2019 European Parliament election and polling third-highest regionally at the 2019 UK general election. The party won one of the three Northern Ireland seats in the European Parliament, and one seat, North Down, in the House of Commons, the lower house of the Parliament of the United Kingdom.

Founded in 1970 from the New Ulster Movement, the Alliance Party originally represented moderate and non-sectarian unionism. However, over time, particularly in the 1990s, it moved towards neutrality on the Union, and came to represent wider liberal and non-sectarian concerns. It supports the Good Friday Agreement but maintains a desire for the reform of the political system towards a non-sectarian future and, in the Northern Ireland Assembly, it is designated as neither Unionist nor Irish nationalist, but &quot;Other&quot; or &quot;United Community&quot;.

The Alliance Party won its first seat in the UK House of Commons in the 2010 general election, unseating the former East Belfast MP Peter Robinson, First Minister of Northern Ireland and leader of the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP). Naomi Long was the first MP from the Alliance Party since Stratton Mills, who joined the party from the Ulster Unionist Party (UUP) in 1973. However, the DUP regained the seat at the 2015 general election, following an electoral pact with the UUP. In the 2019 general election, Alliance regained its presence in the House of Commons when Stephen Farry won the North Down seat vacated by the independent unionist, Sylvia Hermon. Earlier that year, the party&#x27;s leader, Naomi Long, won the party&#x27;s first seat in the European Parliament in the last European election before Brexit. Under Long&#x27;s leadership, the Alliance Party exceeded expectations in the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election and gained numerous seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly.

The Alliance Party is a member of the Liberal International and Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe, and is aligned with the Liberal Democrats in Great Britain.

==History==

===Early growth and the 1974 Northern Ireland Executive===
The party was formed in April 1970 as an alternative to the established parties. In the context of a rapidly worsening political crisis, it aimed not only to present an alternative to what they perceived as sectarian parties and expressly aimed to act as a bridge between the Protestant and Catholic sections of the community and heal the divisions in Northern Ireland society. The Party&#x27;s founding principles were expressly in favour of Northern Ireland remaining part of the United Kingdom, although, in contrast to other unionist parties, that was expressed in socio-economic rather than ethnic terms.

On 5 February 1973, prior to the 1973 Northern Ireland border poll, the party&#x27;s chairman, Jim Hendron, stated that: &quot;Support for the position of Northern Ireland as an integral part of the United Kingdom is a fundamental principle of the Alliance Party, not only for economic reasons but also because we firmly believe that a peaceful solution to our present tragic problems is only possible within a United Kingdom context. Either a Sinn Fein all-Ireland republic or a Vanguard-style Ulster republic would lead to disaster for all our people.&quot;

The party&#x27;s prominence increased in 1972 when three members of the Northern Ireland House of Commons defected to Alliance. The MPs were drawn from across Northern Ireland&#x27;s political divide and included Bertie McConnell, an independent Unionist, the Ulster Unionist Phelim O&#x27;Neill and Tom Gormley who sat as an independent Nationalist. In 1973, Lord Dunleath joined the party in the House of Lords. Stratton Mills, who had been elected as an Ulster Unionist/Conservative MP at Westminster for North Belfast also joined that year, becoming the party&#x27;s sole MP between 1973 and 1974 and did not have another MP until 2010. Its first electoral challenge was the District Council elections of May 1973 when they managed to win 13.6% of the votes cast.

In the elections to the Northern Ireland Assembly, which followed the Sunningdale Agreement, the party polled 9.2% and won eight seats. After the elections, Alliance entered the power sharing Northern Ireland Executive. Oliver Napier became Legal Minister and Head of the Office of Law Reform and Bob Cooper took the junior role of Minister for Manpower Services.

In its manifesto for the elections to the Northern Ireland Constitutional Convention in 1975, the Alliance Party stated &quot;Alliance supports the constitutional position of Northern Ireland as an integral part of the United Kingdom. We know that this belief is shared by the overwhelming majority of our people and that provocative debate about it has been the primary cause of all our most fundamental troubles. The link is in the best economic and social interests of all the people of Northern Ireland, and we will maintain that only the people of Northern Ireland have the right to decide any change by voting in a referendum.&quot;

Alliance&#x27;s vote increased significantly in the 1977 local elections, when it obtained 14.4% of the vote and had 74 Councillors elected. In 1979, Party Leader Oliver Napier came closer than Alliance had previously come to electing a Westminster MP, polling just 928 votes short of Peter Robinson&#x27;s winning total in East Belfast, albeit placing third in a three-way marginal.

===Stabilisation and decline===
Alliance was seriously damaged by the 1981 Irish Hunger Strike, which deeply polarised Northern Ireland politics, and led to the emergence of Sinn Féin as a serious political force. The party supported the 1985 Anglo-Irish Agreement, and despite claims that this would fatally damage its soft unionist support, Alliance rebounded to pick up 10.0% of the vote in Northern Ireland in the 1987 United Kingdom general election.

John Alderdice polled 32.0% of the vote in East Belfast, while Alliance came within 15,000 votes of both the Democratic Unionist Party and Sinn Féin across Northern Ireland. He would go on to become leader after the election, replacing John Cushnahan. In 1996 Alderdice accepted a peerage, becoming the Alliance Party&#x27;s only representation in Parliament. Lord Alderdice took the Liberal Democrat whip on wider UK and European issues but remained free from the whip&#x27;s control on issues impacting Northern Ireland.

In 1988, in Alliance&#x27;s keynote post-Anglo Irish Agreement document, &quot;Governing with Consent&quot;, Alderdice called for a devolved power-sharing government. Throughout the late 1980s and early 1990s, Alliance&#x27;s vote stabilised at between 7% and 10%. After the IRA and loyalist ceasefires in 1994, Alliance became the first non-nationalist party to enter into talks with Sinn Féin, as an active participant in the Northern Ireland peace process negotiations leading to the Good Friday Agreement, which it strongly supported. Alliance polled poorly in the 1996 elections for the Northern Ireland Forum, and the 1998 election for the Northern Ireland Assembly winning around 6.5% of the vote each time. This did enable the party to win six seats in the Assembly, although this was somewhat of a let-down given that it had been expected to do much better.

===The Good Friday Agreement era===

====1998–2004====
John Alderdice resigned as party leader in 1998 to take up the post of the Assembly&#x27;s Presiding Officer. He was replaced by Seán Neeson, who himself resigned as party leader in September 2001. Neeson was replaced by David Ford, a member of the Assembly for South Antrim.
It was predicted that Alliance would suffer electorally as a new centrist challenger established itself in Northern Irish politics, the Northern Ireland Women&#x27;s Coalition. Another problem for the APNI was that the rules of the Assembly require major votes (such as the election of the First Minister and deputy First Minister) to have the support of both a majority of unionist and nationalist MLAs, thus diminishing the importance of parties such as Alliance which are not aligned to either of these two blocs.

In the 2003 Assembly elections, Alliance held all their seats, while the Women&#x27;s Coalition lost both of theirs. Alliance&#x27;s vote fell to just 3.7%. In the European Parliament Elections in 2004, Alliance gave strong support to Independent candidate John Gilliland who polled 6.6% of the vote, the highest for a non-communal candidate in a European election since 1979. In the early years of the peace process, the centre ground was relentlessly squeezed in Northern Ireland politics. The support for Gilliland&#x27;s candidature, which was also supported by parties such as the Workers&#x27; Party and Northern Ireland Conservatives, reflected a desire to reunite the fragmented and weakened non-communal bloc in Northern Ireland politics.

====2004–2016====

In the 5 May 2005 United Kingdom general election, they contested 12 seats and polled 3.9% of the vote. In the simultaneous elections to Northern Ireland&#x27;s local authorities, they polled 5.0% of first preference votes and had 30 Councillors elected, a gain of two seats relative to the previous elections.

The 2006–2007 period saw some signs of an Alliance upturn, topping the poll and gaining a seat in a by-election for Coleraine Borough Council.

In the 2007 Northern Ireland Assembly elections, Alliance put in a strong media campaign and polled 5.2%, up from 3.6% in the previous election and gaining a seat in Belfast South following the successful candidature of Anna Lo, the first ethnic Chinese public representative in a national assembly anywhere in Western Europe. In an election cycle where many pundits had predicted that the Alliance Party would struggle to hold on to the six seats it won in the 2003 election, the party pulled off a credible performance which included Deputy Leader Naomi Long doubling her share of the vote in Belfast East.

In 2008, during the deadlock between Sinn Féin and the DUP over the devolution of policing, the two parties came to an agreement that the Minister of Justice would not come from either party. The Alliance Party was the obvious choice but party leader David Ford said &quot;it&#x27;s a very definite and a very emphatic no&quot;. Ford further stated, &quot;this executive is incompetent, it&#x27;s time they got on with doing the job that they were set up to do&quot;. Following further negotiations, Ford assumed office on 12 April 2010.

At the 2009 European elections, Alliance candidate Ian Parsley achieved the party&#x27;s best European election vote share in 30 years with 5.5% of the vote.

In the 2010 general election, the party won its first seat in Westminster, with Naomi Long taking the seat of sitting First Minister Peter Robinson. The 2011 Northern Ireland Assembly Election resulted in eight Assembly members being returned with a gain in Belfast East. It overtook the UUP on Belfast City Council.

In a poll conducted in November 2012, Alliance (on 11.6%) overtook the UUP (11.4%) for the first time.

During the 2016 elections to the Assembly, in spite of initially confident predications from David Ford that Alliance would see a surplus of up to 11 seats, the party&#x27;s share of the popular vote stagnated somewhat, from 7.7% in 2011 to 7.0%. Ultimately, its 8 MLAs from their original respective constituencies were returned to Stormont for the fifth Assembly term. Ford later resigned as Alliance Party leader on 6 October 2016, on his 15th anniversary as leader of the party.

=== 2016–2019: Opposing Brexit ===

On 26 October 2016, Naomi Long officially became the new leader of the Alliance Party. In the snap 2017 Assembly election, Alliance increased its vote share to 9.1% and retained all eight of their MLA seats in a reduced Assembly. For the 2017 general election, the party advocated a confirmatory referendum on the Brexit withdrawal agreement and remaining in the European Single Market. In April 2018, the party joined the Alliance of Liberals and Democrats for Europe Party as an associate member.

Alliance increased its vote share by 5 percentage points in the 2019 local elections and broke out of its traditional Greater Belfast heartlands by taking seats on Armagh, Banbridge and Craigavon Borough Council and Derry City &amp; Strabane District Council where the party had not previously been represented. During the election campaign, the party had urged a break from &quot;orange and green politics&quot; and was vocal in its opposition to Brexit using the slogan &quot;Demand Better&quot;.

In the 2019 European election, Naomi Long became the Alliance Party&#x27;s first ever MEP, receiving the second of three seats allocated to Northern Ireland and securing the best ever result for Alliance with 18.5% of first-preference votes.

The party greatly increased its vote share at the 2019 general election, from 7.9% to 16.8% of Northern Ireland, over-taking the SDLP and UUP to come third overall. The party re-gained a seat in the House of Commons (North Down, previously held by the retiring independent Sylvia Hermon), and was second in another four constituencies.

=== 2020–present: COVID-19 pandemic and subsequent elections ===
Long became Stormont&#x27;s justice minister in January 2020, holding the position throughout the COVID-19 pandemic. In March 2022, Long told the Alliance Party conference in Belfast that the DUP and Sinn Féin were &quot;addicted to crisis and conflict&quot;, and hoped that her party could bring an end to the &quot;binary system&quot; at Stormont.

The Alliance Party fought the 2022 Northern Ireland Assembly election on a platform of reforming the Stormont institutions, health transformation, integrated education, a Green New Deal and tackling paramilitarism. Alliance would go on to win the third highest number of seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly, 4.5% more of the vote than they did in the 2017 election and also gaining nine seats. In all, the 2022 election saw the party win 17 seats in the Northern Ireland Assembly, more than double the number of seats than what they previously had after the 2017 Northern Ireland Assembly election.

The 2023 Northern Ireland local elections were, in Long&#x27;s own words, &quot;a mixed bag&quot;, but the party still gained 14 seats overall, increasing its councillor total to 67.

==Ideology and policies==

Over the past 40 years (and particularly since the mid-1990s), Alliance&#x27;s political philosophy has veered away from non-sectarian unionism towards a more liberal, neutral position on the question of either a united Ireland or continued union with Great Britain. Alliance supports the Good Friday Agreement as a basis that can be used to manage the conflict whilst working to ultimately create a non-sectarian political system for Northern Ireland. It believes that the consociational power-sharing structure established by the agreement may not be capable of providing long-term stability, citing various reservations such as the entrenchment of pre-existing divisions as well as the inability to adapt to demographic changes. Its 2022 manifesto stated &quot;Alliance supports the Good Friday Agreement, and endorses its underlying principles, its structures, and its interlocking relationships. However, we have always supported reform of the structures of government and, in light of recent developments, the case for reform is stronger than ever.&quot;

The Alliance Party was founded by moderate Unionists in the New Ulster Movement in April 1970 in response to the emergence of the Troubles. As Alliance viewed the situation, the major problem of Northern Ireland was the division between Protestants and Catholics. It contended that the turmoil had its origins in that division and not in the partition of Ireland. The party&#x27;s founding members resolved to change the &quot;traditional mould&quot; of sectarian politics in Northern Ireland, by launching a party deliberately set out to win support from both sections of the population. The party&#x27;s founding principles were an attempt to address the &quot;fundamental fears&quot; of Protestants being coerced into a united Ireland, and of Catholics being condemned to second-class citizenship within Northern Ireland.

The distinguishing feature of Alliance is its belief in the legitimacy of a distinctive Northern Irish community, one that has more in common than what divides it, with most inhabitants speaking a common language, sharing some form of Christianity, and not separated by distinguishable racial or physical characteristics. Alliance does not view unionism and nationalism as distinct communities, but as &quot;political positions&quot;. Furthermore, Alliance sees identity as an individual matter, one that is fluid and open to change over time. In a 2014 document, the Alliance stated:

Because of this stance, Alliance is at times referred to as representing a &quot;third tradition&quot; or &quot;third force&quot; within Northern Irish politics that is outside of Nationalism and Unionism.

As Alliance have moved to an ideologically liberal perspective, and Northern Ireland society has become more diverse, support for diversity has become a key Alliance platform, with Anna Lo MLA elected as the first ethnically East Asian parliamentarian in Northern Ireland and the party promoting a number of openly gay spokespeople. In July 2005, Seamus Close, then an MLA and Lisburn councillor for the party and its former deputy leader, proposed that the Lisburn Council deny gay couples access to the council&#x27;s designated wedding facility if they were seeking a civil partnership under the Civil Partnership Act 2004. The council adopted his recommendation, although it was later reversed on legal advice. His position ran against Alliance policy, which had been strongly supportive of the introduction of civil partnership laws, and he was publicly criticised by other senior party members. The then party chair and future MLA, Lisburn councillor Trevor Lunn, who had also opposed the use of the wedding facility for civil partnerships, resigned as chair later that year, stating that &quot;I always thought the Alliance Party was a broad enough church that we could support some difference of opinion. But it appears that in terms of equality issues, that we just can&#x27;t.&quot; The party&#x27;s liberal ideology has also pushed the party towards a general favourable position on abortion, immigration and LGBT rights. The party also supports an integrated education system where Catholics and Protestants are educated together, improving healthcare in Northern Ireland, and legislating a Green New Deal.

==Electoral performance and the regionalisation of Alliance&#x27;s vote==

One trend over time with Alliance&#x27;s vote is that in contrast to 1973, when Alliance support was dispersed across Northern Ireland, Alliance has increasingly polled best in the Greater Belfast hinterland. For example, the 1977 elections, while representing an overall increase for Alliance, masked a sharp decline in vote share in many Western councils. In the 12 councils covering the former counties of Londonderry, Tyrone, Armagh and Fermanagh their vote only rose in Omagh, it remained static in Magherafelt and fell in the other ten councils (these being Fermanagh, Dungannon, Cookstown, Strabane, Londonderry, Limavady, Coleraine, Newry &amp; Mourne, Armagh and Craigavon.) Overall in these 12 councils the number of Alliance councillors fell from 18 in 1973 to ten in 1977. In contrast, in the rest of the region Alliance increased their number of councillors from 45 to 60.

The party won eight council seats across Belfast in 1985. Although that has now recovered to six (from three in 2001), the six are entirely from South and East Belfast. Both seats in the Falls Road area of West Belfast were lost after the death and resignation of their councillors there in 1987 while their seat in North Belfast was lost in 1993, regained four years later and lost again in 2001. In the neighbouring areas of Dunmurry Cross (Twinbrook/Dunmurry) and Macedon (Rathcoole) Alliance lost their councillors in 1989 and 1994 respectively; on the other hand, the party won three out of seven seats in Victoria in 2011, the first time since 1977 that the party had won three council seats in the same electoral area.

By 2005, the party had councillors in only half of Northern Ireland&#x27;s 18 constituencies. However, this rose to 13 in 2011 after gains in Coleraine, Craigavon, Down and elsewhere. Having had around 30 councillors for a decade, the party won 44 seats in 2011. In the 2010 elections, the Alliance gained the Westminster seat of Belfast East, and gained a 22.6% swing there; in 2011 it re-emphasised that result, winning two out of the six MLA seats available.

In 2014, the party gained one seat in the Belfast Council area, this coming in North Belfast when Nuala McAllister ousted Sinn Féin. Outside of the capital the party&#x27;s vote held up, and with the exception of Patrick Brown winning in Rowallane, there were no outstanding results.

In the 2015 Westminster elections, the party directed their resources at retaining the East Belfast seat Naomi Long had gained from the DUP in 2010. The party lost the seat to the DUP by 2,500 votes, after a Unionist pact, whilst the Alliance vote increased by 6% across the constituency.

The 2019 Northern Ireland local elections saw a substantial increase in the Alliance vote and resulted in 53 councillors being elected, with the only council not having any Alliance representation being in Mid Ulster. The balance of power in the capital of Belfast, is held by the party after an increase to 10 seats and becoming the 3rd party, at Belfast City Hall.

Several Alliance members have held the position of Lord Mayor of Belfast, including Long and (from 2021 to 2022), Kate Nicholl.

== Alliance Youth ==
Alliance Youth is the youth and student movement of the Alliance Party. Alliance members who are under 25 years old automatically become members of Alliance Youth if they choose to share their details at registration. Alliance Youth is also responsible for overseeing Alliance Societies at Northern Ireland universities. Young Liberals Northern Ireland does not organise in any of Northern Ireland&#x27;s Universities, encouraging members to become active within Alliance Youth societies.

===Activity===
Alliance Youth actively campaign on issues affecting young people, and aim to shape policy of the main party in these areas. Previous campaigns have focused on racism, child poverty, and human trafficking, as well as specific domestic issues facing young people, such as mental health care, tuition fees, sustainable transport, LGBT rights and homelessness.

Alliance Youth is also particularly active in the recruitment and support of young candidates and elected representatives.

<text>A phase detector or phase comparator is a frequency mixer, analog multiplier or logic circuit that generates a signal which represents the difference in phase between two signal inputs.

The phase detector is an essential element of the phase-locked loop (PLL). Detecting phase difference is important in other applications, such as motor control, radar and telecommunication systems, servo mechanisms, and demodulators.

==Types==
Phase detectors for phase-locked loop circuits may be classified in two types. A Type I detector is designed to be driven by analog signals or square-wave digital signals and produces an output pulse at the difference frequency. The Type I detector always produces an output waveform, which must be filtered to control the phase-locked loop voltage-controlled oscillator (VCO). A type II detector is sensitive only to the relative timing of the edges of the input and reference pulses and produces a constant output proportional to phase difference when both signals are at the same frequency. This output will tend not to produce ripple in the control voltage of the VCO.

===Analog phase detector===
The phase detector needs to compute the phase difference of its two input signals. Let α be the phase of the first input and β be the phase of the second. The actual input signals to the phase detector, however, are not α and β, but rather sinusoids such as sin(α) and cos(β). In general, computing the phase difference would involve computing the arcsine and arccosine of each normalized input (to get an ever-increasing phase) and doing a subtraction. Such an analog calculation is difficult. Fortunately, the calculation can be simplified by using some approximations.

Assume that the phase differences will be small (much less than 1 radian, for example). The small-angle approximation for the sine function and the sine angle addition formula yield:
:formula_1

The expression suggests a quadrature phase detector can be made by summing the outputs of two multipliers. The quadrature signals may be formed with phase shift networks. Two common implementations for multipliers are the double balanced diode mixer, diode ring and the four-quadrant multiplier, Gilbert cell.

Instead of using two multipliers, a more common phase detector uses a single multiplier and a different trigonometric identity:
:formula_2
The first term provides the desired phase difference. The second term is a sinusoid at twice the reference frequency, so it can be filtered out. In the case of general waveforms the phase detector output is described with the phase detector characteristic.

A mixer-based detector (e.g., a Schottky diode-based double-balanced mixer) provides &quot;the ultimate in phase noise floor performance&quot; and &quot;in system sensitivity.&quot; since it does not create finite pulse widths at the phase detector output. Another advantage of a mixer-based PD is its relative simplicity. Both the quadrature and simple multiplier phase detectors have an output that depends on the input amplitudes as well as the phase difference. In practice, the input amplitudes of input signals are normalized prior to input into the detector to remove the amplitude dependency.

===Digital phase detector===
A phase detector suitable for square wave signals can be made from an exclusive-OR (XOR) logic gate. When the two signals being compared are completely in-phase, the XOR gate&#x27;s output will have a constant level of zero. When the two signals differ in phase by 1°, the XOR gate&#x27;s output will be high for 1/180th of each cycle — the fraction of a cycle during which the two signals differ in value. When the signals differ by 180° — that is, one signal is high when the other is low, and vice versa — the XOR gate&#x27;s output remains high throughout each cycle. This phase detector requires inputs that are symmetrical square waves, or nearly so.

The XOR detector compares well to the analog mixer in that it locks near a 90° phase difference and has a pulse wave output at twice the reference frequency. The output changes duty cycle in proportion to the phase difference. Applying the XOR gate&#x27;s output to a low-pass filter results in an analog voltage that is proportional to the phase difference between the two signals. The remainder of its characteristics are very similar to the analog mixer for capture range, lock time, reference spurious and low-pass filter requirements.

Digital phase detectors can also be based on a sample and hold circuit, a charge pump, or a logic circuit consisting of flip-flops. When a phase detector based on logic gates is used in a PLL, it can quickly force the VCO to synchronize with an input signal, even when the frequency of the input signal differs substantially from the initial frequency of the VCO. Such phase detectors also have other desirable properties, such as better accuracy when there are only small phase differences between the two signals being compared and superior pull-in range.

===Phase frequency detector===
A phase frequency detector (PFD) is an asynchronous circuit originally made of four flip-flops (i.e., the phase-frequency detectors found in both the RCA CD4046 and the motorola MC4344 ICs introduced in the 1970s). The logic determines which of the two signals has a zero-crossing earlier or more often. When used in a PLL application, lock can be achieved even when it is off frequency.

The PFD improves the pull-in range and lock time over simpler phase detector designs such as multipliers or XOR gates. Those designs work well when the two input phases are already near lock or in lock, but perform poorly when the phase difference is too large. When the phase difference is too large (which will happen when the instantaneous frequency difference is large), then the sign of the loop gain can reverse and start driving the VCO away from lock. The PFD has the advantage of producing an output even when the two signals being compared differ not only in phase but in frequency. A phase frequency detector prevents a false lock condition in PLL applications, in which the PLL synchronizes with the wrong phase of the input signal or with the wrong frequency (e.g., a harmonic of the input signal).

A &quot;bang-bang&quot; charge pump phase frequency detector supplies current pulses with fixed total charge, either positive or negative, to the capacitor acting as an integrator. A phase detector for a bang-bang charge pump must always have a dead band where the phases of inputs are close enough that the detector fires either both or neither of the charge pumps, for no total effect. Bang-bang phase detectors are simple but are associated with significant minimum peak-to-peak jitter, because of drift within the dead band.

In 1976 it was shown that by using a three-state phase frequency detector configuration (using only two flip-flops) instead of the original RCA/Motorola four flip-flops configurations, this problem could be elegantly overcome. For other types of phase-frequency detectors other, though possibly less-elegant, solutions exist to the dead zone phenomenon. Other solutions are necessary since the three-state phase-frequency detector does not work for certain applications involving randomized signal degradation, which can be found on the inputs to some signal regeneration systems (e.g., clock recovery designs).

A &quot;proportional&quot; phase detector employs a charge pump that supplies charge amounts in proportion to the phase error detected. Some have dead bands and some do not. Specifically, some designs produce both up and down control pulses even when the phase difference is zero. These pulses are small, nominally the same duration, and cause the charge pump to produce equal-charge positive and negative current pulses when the phase is perfectly matched. Phase detectors with this kind of control system don&#x27;t exhibit a dead band and typically have lower minimum peak-to-peak jitter when used in PLLs.

In PLL applications it is frequently required to know when the loop is out of lock. The more complex digital phase-frequency detectors usually have an output that allows a reliable indication of an out-of-lock condition.

==Electronic phase detector==
Some signal processing techniques such as those used in radar may require both the amplitude and the phase of a signal, to recover all the information encoded in that signal. One technique is to feed an amplitude-limited signal into one port of a product detector and a reference signal into the other port; the output of the detector will represent the phase difference between the signals.

==Optical phase detectors==
In optics phase detectors are also known as interferometers. For pulsed (amplitude modulated) light, it is said to measure the phase between the carriers. It is also possible to measure the delay between the envelopes of two short optical pulses by means of cross correlation in a nonlinear crystal. And it is possible to measure the phase between the envelope and the carrier of an optical pulse, by sending a pulse into a nonlinear crystal. There the spectrum gets wider and at the edges the shape depends significantly on the phase.

<text>The UK Unionist Party (UKUP) was a small unionist political party in Northern Ireland from 1995 to 2008 that opposed the Good Friday Agreement. It was nominally formed by Robert McCartney, formerly of the Ulster Unionist Party, to contest the 1995 North Down by-election and then further constituted to contest the 1996 elections for the Northern Ireland Forum. McCartney had previously contested the 1987 general election as an independent using the label Real Unionist.

== Ideology ==
In contrast to other unionist parties, the UK Unionist Party was an integrationist party which believed that Northern Ireland should be governed from London with no regional home rule government and parliament. The UKUP was outspoken in its opposition to the Republic of Ireland having any participative role in the governance of Northern Ireland.

It was also highly critical of the British Labour government of Tony Blair agreeing to Sinn Féin&#x27;s participation in the Northern Ireland Executive prior to the Provisional IRA fully disarming. The party also opposed the re-organising of policing in Northern Ireland, which saw the Royal Ulster Constabulary (RUC) being replaced by the Police Service of Northern Ireland (PSNI).

== History ==
The party secured a particular coup in 1996 when it was joined by Conor Cruise O&#x27;Brien, a former government minister in the Republic of Ireland. O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s hostility to militant Irish republicanism was well-known, and the adherence of such a prominent supporter from the Republic helped reinforce the UKUP&#x27;s claims to be a non-sectarian party.

McCartney and O&#x27;Brien, along with Cedric Wilson, won seats on the 1996 Forum. The UKUP (and the Democratic Unionist Party (DUP)) refused to accept US Senator George Mitchell as chairman of the multi-party talks and tried to obstruct his work. In July 1996, the UKUP withdrew from the multi-party talks in protest at the way in which the Drumcree conflict was handled, but later re-joined them. When Sinn Féin entered the talks in September 1997, the UKUP again left them in protest, along with the DUP.

At the 1997 general election, McCartney was re-elected as the Member of Parliament for North Down. The party opposed the April 1998 Belfast Agreement and campaigned against the establishment of a Northern Ireland Assembly, in which they were unsuccessful. It did contest the election for the Assembly, however, and won five seats.

During 1998, the party suffered a significant amount of internal turmoil. O&#x27;Brien published an article in which he called for unionists to consider and embrace the idea of a United Ireland (to challenge the growth in popularity of Sinn Féin) – an idea that was anathema to most in the UKUP. He subsequently resigned from the party. In December the party split over the issue of Sinn Féin taking up its seats in the power-sharing executive without prior Provisional Irish Republican Army decommissioning of weapons. McCartney proposed that if this should happen, the five UKUP members should resign their seats in protest, but this was opposed by the other assembly members. At a party meeting at which the other four were absent, McCartney censured his Assembly colleagues over this split. The two sides both argued that they had the support of the grassroots members of the party. On 5 January 1999, all four left the UKUP to form the Northern Ireland Unionist Party (NIUP), leaving McCartney as the sole UKUP representative in the assembly.

At the 2001 general election, McCartney lost his seat in the House of Commons to the Ulster Unionist Party, which in addition to putting considerable resources into taking the seat, benefited from the withdrawal of the Alliance Party of Northern Ireland due to McCartney&#x27;s opposition to the Good Friday Agreement. In the 2003 Assembly election, he was only narrowly re-elected to the Assembly. The party suffered a substantial decline in the election, holding only one seat. The NIUP also lost all of its seats.

In 2005, the UKUP did not contest any seats in the Westminster election. In the local elections, its two members of North Down Borough Council lost their seats.

In the 2007 Assembly election, the UKUP fielded candidates in thirteen of Northern Ireland&#x27;s eighteen constituencies, but failed to win any seats. Leader McCartney personally stood in six constituencies and former DUP MLA George Ennis also stood on the UKUP ticket. The party stood on a platform opposing plans by the DUP to enter into devolved government with Sinn Féin after the election and on other issues including rates, water charges and education. The UKUP was seen as the main channel for DUP members disaffected with plans to share power with Sinn Féin.

Following McCartney&#x27;s defeat in North Down in the 2007 Assembly elections, the UKUP was left without elected representatives at any level. McCartney announced his retirement from politics following the loss of his assembly seat in North Down to Brian Wilson of the Green Party. As of September 2008, the UKUP is no longer listed as a registered party in the Northern Ireland Register of Political Parties maintained by the UK Electoral Commission.

<text>The GMB is a general trade union in the United Kingdom which has more than 560,000 members. Its members work in nearly all industrial sectors, in retail, security, schools, distribution, the utilities, social care, the National Health Service (NHS), ambulance service and local government.

== Structural history ==
Founded in March 1889, it grew rapidly under the inspirational leadership of Will Thorne (1857-1946), to become a national union, winning a series of disputes in 1889 and gaining concessions on pay, conditions, and the introduction of the Eight Hour Day for its members.
GMB merge, beginning when the National Amalgamated Union of Labour (NAUL), National Union of General Workers (NUGW) and the Municipal Employees Association (MEA) in 1924 joined into a new union, named the National Union of General and Municipal Workers (NUGMW). Although the new union was one of the largest in the country it grew relatively slowly over the following decades; this changed in the 1970s when David Basnett created new sections for staff, and hotel and catering workers, and changed the union&#x27;s name to the General and Municipal Workers&#x27; Union (GMWU) in 1974.

In 1982, following a merger with the Amalgamated Society of Boilermakers, Shipwrights, Blacksmiths and Structural Workers (ASBSBSW), the union was renamed the General, Municipal, Boilermakers and Allied Trade Union (GMBATU). This was sometimes shortened to &quot;GMB&quot;, which in 1987 became the official name of the union. For several years following the highly contested merger boilermaker members retained a distinct identity in GMB&#x27;s Craft Section.

The union has absorbed the following smaller unions:

In 1992, the GMB for the first time allocated all of its members to one of eight industrial sections: clothing and textiles; commercial services; construction, furniture and allied; energy and utilities; engineering; food and leisure; process; and public services.

The GMB&#x27;s sections were rationalised in 2006, with the union since then consisting of GMB Commercial Services, GMB Manufacturing, and GMB Public Services.

===Thorne Credit Union===
Thorne Credit Union Limited is a savings and loans co-operative established by the trade union for its members in 1998. Trading as TCU Money, it began life as GMB Lancashire Region Credit Union and was rolled out nationwide in 2000. TCU is named after Will Thorne, founder of NUGW forerunner, the National Union of Gas Workers and General Labourers and one of the first Labour Members of Parliament. The credit union is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the PRA. Ultimately, like the banks and building societies, members&#x27; savings are protected against business failure by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

==Landmark Uber employment tribunal case==
On 28 October 2016, in a landmark ruling if not overturned on appeal, the Central London Employment Tribunal ruled that Uber drivers are &quot;workers&quot; entitled to the minimum wage, paid holiday, sick leave and other normal worker entitlements, rather than self-employed. Two Uber drivers had brought the case to the employment tribunal with the assistance of the GMB Union on 20 July 2016, as a test case on behalf of a group of 19 drivers. As a consequence, The Pensions Regulator is considering if the ruling obliges Uber to create a workplace pension scheme. The ruling could have implications wider than just Uber, throughout the so-called gig economy. On 10 November 2017 the Employment Appeal Tribunal upheld the first tribunal&#x27;s ruling. Uber indicated that it would appeal further.

The law firm Leigh Day started the legal action against Uber on behalf of 25 members of the GMB union, which initially included J. Farrar and Y. Aslam, although the two pursued this latest case with a different union, the Independent Worker&#x27;s Union of Great Britain.

On 10 February 2017 a similar case involving Pimlico Plumbers was confirmed at the Court of Appeal. A worker who had suffered a heart attack was found to have been unfairly or wrongfully dismissed.

Another similar case against parcel delivery company Hermes Group, supported by the GMB through lawyers Leigh Day, had a similar outcome at an employment tribunal in Leeds on 25 June 2018. Hermes are considering an appeal. The GMB stated the ruling was likely to affect 14,500 Hermes couriers. General Secretary, Tim Roache, described it as:
== Political activity ==

GMB is one of the three largest affiliates of the Labour Party. It is a significant financial contributor to the party&#x27;s national and local organisation. GMB gives Labour up to £2m a year in affiliation fees and other funds, making it the third largest union donor to the party.

In 1991, GMB was the first British trade union to set up an office in Brussels and has been particularly engaged in seeking to influence European Union legislation that sets minimum standards for workers and for health and safety across the EU single market.

In 2008, GMB Congress voted to withdraw local funding from around a third of the 108 Labour MPs whose constituencies received support from GMB, due to the perception that some MPs within the party were treating workers with &quot;contempt&quot; and generally not working in the interests of the working class and GMB members. Despite this the Congress opposed disaffiliation from the party.

In the 2010 Labour Leadership Election, GMB endorsed Ed Miliband over his competitor and brother David Miliband.

In 2013, GMB announced it was cutting its affiliation fund from £1.2m to £150,000 by reducing the number of members it affiliates from 420,000 to 50,000.

In 2013, GMB Congress, the lay member ruling body, adopted a 14-point plan to encourage GMB members to become active in the Labour Party and to stand as Labour candidates for public office (Parliament and local government). GMB has two representatives on the National Executive Committee (NEC) of the Labour Party, Kathy Abu-Bakir and Gavin Sibthorpe. In Ireland, GMB is affiliated to the Irish Labour Party.

While in the 2015 Labour leadership election GMB did not endorse a candidate, in the 2016 Labour leadership election, the union endorsed Owen Smith against incumbent leader Jeremy Corbyn.

Under the leadership of Jeremy Corbyn, the GMB clashed with the party over the issues of Trident renewal and fracking, both of which are opposed by Corbyn.

In the 2020 Labour leadership election, the GMB endorsed Lisa Nandy, who subsequently finished third.

== Leadership ==
The GMB is led by a general secretary and treasurer. In 2005 Paul Kenny was appointed the acting general secretary, in place of Kevin Curran who stepped down after being suspended on full pay during an inquiry into ballot-rigging during the union&#x27;s leadership election. The episode was seen as a power struggle between the national office and powerful regional heads, led by Kenny, who opposed centralisation. Kenny had lost the 2003 vote to Curran. In May 2006, Kenny was elected unopposed as general secretary.

Tim Roache was elected as general secretary and treasurer in November 2015, receiving 56.7% of the vote on a turnout of 4.2%, beating the one other candidate, Paul McCarthy. Roache took up the post in 2016, but resigned in April 2020 after allegations of harassment.

==2020 internal inquiry==
In 2020, following the resignation of general secretary Tim Roache and subsequently receiving anonymous allegations, the union conducted a barrister-led internal inquiry. This concluded that bullying, misogyny, cronyism and sexual harassment were &quot;endemic&quot; within the union. More specifically the report stated &quot;The GMB is institutionally sexist. The General Secretaries and all regional secretaries are, and always have been, men. Women are underrepresented throughout the GMB’s ranks&quot;, concluding that culture must change for the GMB to become a safe and rewarding place for women. The report made 27 recommendations for change, on which the union&#x27;s National President, Barbara Plant, promised to act.

== Sports sponsorship ==

The GMB sponsors the Nottingham Panthers ice hockey team and the Castleford Tigers rugby league team.

Until May 2011 it sponsored Swindon Town Football Club, but when Paolo Di Canio was appointed manager the GMB terminated the relationship because of Di Canio&#x27;s political views. A GMB spokesman said: &quot;He has openly voiced support for Mussolini so it beggars belief that Swindon could have appointed him, especially given the multi-ethnic nature of the team and the town.&quot; The union sponsored Port Vale for the 2013–14 football season.

<doc id="359293" wikidata="Q176224" url="?curid=359293" title="Unison">
<text>In music, unison is two or more musical parts that sound either the same pitch or pitches separated by intervals of one or more octaves, usually at the same time. Rhythmic unison is another term for homorhythm.

==Definition==

Unison or perfect unison (also called a prime, or perfect prime) may refer to the (pseudo-) interval formed by a tone and its duplication (in German, &quot;Unisono&quot;, &quot;Einklang&quot;, or &quot;Prime&quot;), for example C–C, as differentiated from the second, C–D, etc. In the unison the two pitches have the ratio of 1:1 or 0 half steps and zero cents. Although two tones in unison are considered to be the same pitch, they are still perceivable as coming from separate sources, whether played on instruments of a different type: ; or of the same type: . This is because a pair of tones in unison come from different locations or can have different &quot;colors&quot; (timbres), i.e. come from different musical instruments or human voices. Voices with different colors have, as sound waves, different waveforms. These waveforms have the same fundamental frequency but differ in the amplitudes of their higher harmonics. The unison is considered the most consonant interval while the near unison is considered the most dissonant. The unison is also the easiest interval to tune. The unison is abbreviated as &quot;P1&quot;.

However, the unison was questioned by Zarlino as an interval for lacking contrast and compared to a point in geometry:

==Performance ensembles==

In orchestral music &quot;unison&quot; can mean the simultaneous playing of a note (or a series of notes constituting a melody) by different instruments, either at the same pitch; or in a different octave, for example, cello and double bass (&quot;all&#x27;unisono&quot;). Typically a section string player plays unison with the rest of the section. Occasionally the Italian word &quot;divisi&quot; (meaning &quot;divided&quot;, abbrev. &quot;div.&quot;) marks a point where an instrumental section, typically the first violins, is to be divided into two groups for rendering passages that might, for example, include full chords. Thus, in the &quot;divisi&quot; first violins the &quot;outside&quot; players (nearer the audience) might play the top note of the chord, while the &quot;inside&quot; seated players play the middle note, and the second violins play the bottom note. At the point where the first violins no longer play &quot;divisi&quot;, the score may indicate this with &quot;unison&quot; (abbrev. &quot;unis.&quot;).

When an entire choir sings the main melody, the choir usually sings in unison. Music in which all the notes sung are in unison is called monophonic. In a choir with two or more sections, such as for different vocal ranges, each section typically sings in unison. Part singing is when two or more voices sing different notes. Homophony is when choir members sing different pitches but with the same rhythm. Polyphony is when the chorus sings multiple independent melodies.

==Synthesizer==
On synthesizers, the term &quot;unison&quot; is used to describe two or more oscillators generating the same pitch/notes as each other, which can result in a fatter or thicker sound (especially if tiny changes are made to each oscillator&#x27;s tuning). 

However, if each oscillator is tuned so far from the other oscillators that they aren&#x27;t generating the same note then technically they aren&#x27;t in unison. 

If they are playing the same note but in a different octave then they are still in unison. For example, a melody consisting of A-B-C-B-A-A-A if played in a different octave is still A-B-C-B-A-A-A therefore this is still considered as &quot;in unison&quot;.

Unison refers to &quot;everything doing the same thing&quot;.

<text>The Northern Ireland Women&#x27;s Coalition (NIWC) was a minor cross-community political party in Northern Ireland from 1996 to 2006.

The NIWC was founded by Catholic academic Monica McWilliams and Protestant social worker Pearl Sagar to contest elections to the Northern Ireland Forum, the body for all-party talks which led to the Belfast (Good Friday) Agreement.

The party campaigned principally around the fact that it was led by women, declining to take a position on whether Northern Ireland should be part of the United Kingdom or a United Ireland. It did not identify as feminist.

== History ==
===Creation and growth===
The creation of the NIWC is usually traced back to a meeting over dinner between Avila Kilmurray, a former trade union official and former director of the Community Foundation for Northern Ireland, and McWilliams in April 1996. The pair discussed ways in which women could be &quot;written into, rather than out of&quot; the Northern Ireland peace process. Working with the Northern Ireland Women&#x27;s European Forum, they unsuccessfully lobbied the Northern Ireland Office to require parties to submit gender-balanced lists for the Northern Ireland Forum elections. Having failed, the NIWC was hastily assembled to contest the election.

Around 150 women attended the first NIWC meeting, and subsequent meetings regularly attracted up to 60 people. Meetings were held in Belfast on a fortnightly and later weekly basis to debate positions, facilitated by rotating chairs. After a year, the NIWC developed a constitution that provided for the election of a 12–15 member executive committee to make policy decisions: two representatives from each county, plus the party&#x27;s elected representatives as &quot;ex officio&quot; members. Additional members could be co-opted to maintain the cross-community balance. Monthly meetings continued to be open to the full membership.

In the 1996 Forum elections, McWilliams, Sagar and eight other Coalition candidates secured 7,731 votes (1.03%). They did not win any constituency seats, but under a &#x27;top-up&#x27; mechanism to ensure the representation of minor parties, they were awarded two seats, taken by McWilliams and Sagar. They attended the negotiations dominated by the other 108 representatives and supported (but did not, as often reported, sign) the ensuing intergovernmental Good Friday Agreement. The NIWC successfully introduced amendments on mixed housing, the inclusion of women in public life, special initiatives for young people affected by the conflict, recognition of the links between reconciliation and mixed housing and integrated education, and the promotion of a culture of tolerance. The NIWC also advocated the creation of a Civic Forum for Northern Ireland, which was included in the Agreement and set up in 2000.

===Post-Agreement political involvement===
The NIWC fielded three candidates in the 1997 United Kingdom general election, collecting a total of 3,024 votes. In the 1998 Northern Ireland Assembly election, the NIWC secured 13,018 votes (1.6%) and McWilliams, representing South Belfast, and Jane Morrice, representing North Down, were elected to the inaugural Northern Ireland Assembly. Some academics have speculated that the NIWC&#x27;s existence forced other party leaders to pay more attention to women&#x27;s interests in their campaigning during the election. The main parties put forward higher numbers of women in response to the advent of the NIWC, motivated by fear that votes for female candidates would go to the NIWC.

In the 2001 Northern Ireland local elections, the party secured 3,301 votes (0.4%) and one council seat. McWilliams stood unsuccessfully as a candidate in the 2001 United Kingdom general election, securing 2,968 votes in South Belfast (7.8%).

===Decline and dissolution===
At its 2002 conference, the NIWC boasted of being &quot;the only women&#x27;s party in the world that has elected representatives – that is quite some achievement&quot;. By 2003, however, both NIWC MLAs had lost their seats in the 2003 Assembly elections, where the party&#x27;s vote fell to 5,785 votes (0.8%). The party subsequently held &quot;a frank, honest and constructive discussion&quot; about whether to continue, eventually resolving that it would not wind up. Its electoral fortunes did not recover. The party&#x27;s last remaining elected representative lost her seat on North Down Borough Council in 2005, where the NIWC secured 0.1% of the Northern Ireland vote.

The party never contested another election. On 11 May 2006, the Women&#x27;s Coalition was formally wound up at a function held in Belfast.

<doc id="359303" wikidata="Q5154122" url="?curid=359303" title="Communication Workers Union (United Kingdom)">
<text>The Communication Workers Union (CWU) is the main trade union in the United Kingdom for people working for telephone, cable, digital subscriber line (DSL), postal delivery, and tech companies. It has 110,000 members in Royal Mail as well as more in many other communication companies.

Formed in 1995 by the merger of the Union of Communication Workers and National Communications Union, its current general secretary is Dave Ward.

==Sectors==
CWU members work for Royal Mail, the Post Office, BT, O2, Sky, Accenture HR Services, EE, Virgin Media and other communication companies. Members&#x27; expertise includes engineering, computing, clerical, mechanical, driving, retail, financial and manual skills.

In 2020 United Tech and Allied Workers was formed as a branch of the CWU to represent workers in the technology industry.

==Royal Mail industrial action==

===2007===

The basis of the strike was a disagreement over pay and pensions. On 7 June 2007, the union&#x27;s postal members voted by 77.5% to strike after a 2.5% pay rise coupled with £350 million every year for five years (totalling £1.5 billion) of cuts was offered. They took their first one-day strike on 29 June 2007, and the second on 12 July and 13 July. The action then progressed to a series of rolling strikes.

=== 2009===
Further industrial action was taken in 2009. An overwhelming three to one vote in favour backed the dispute and two days of national strike action were called in October 2009. This followed significant periods of local strike action in London, Bristol and areas of Scotland. Following the national days of action, the TUC were involved in brokering an &quot;interim agreement&quot; that provided a &quot;period of calm&quot; for the union and Royal Mail to negotiate a full and final agreement on the introduction of modernisation and relevant working practices. Following the interim agreement, strike action was suspended and talks held under the auspices of Acas.

In December 2009, a national agreement was struck and a ballot of the membership on an agreement on pay and working conditions was carried out. This agreement was overwhelmingly supported by CWU members in January 2010. The agreement increased pay and changed working arrangements, particularly in delivery. The agreement was headed &quot;business transformation&quot; and discussions and implementation arrangements continued nationally and in each workplace on the detail of the agreement. As a result, both the union and Royal Mail claimed to have agreed a fully funded modernisation plan.

==BT industrial action==

===2010 BT industrial dispute===

In early 2010 the CWU balloted all of its BT employed members for strike action over a pay claim for 2010. The ballot result was never announced due to legal challenges but following extensive negotiations CWU reached an agreed settlement on pay with BT. A national ballot of members overwhelmingly agreed the pay deal.

===2021 RPE industrial dispute and strike===

On 24 February 2021, 170 BT Openreach employees commenced a total of three weeks strike action in opposition to the companies unagreed changes to their Terms &amp; Conditions, along with proposals that could impact taxpayer expenditure for public funded projects.

CWU Deputy General Secretary, Andy Kerr commented that &quot;the fact that management’s total intransigence on the issue has resulted in the first industrial action anywhere in BT Group for 22 years tells its own story.&quot;

The staff involved were Repayment Project Engineers (RPE). Their job involved diverting and/or protecting BT cables during major building works, including local authority and government schemes.

To date, the industrial dispute has not been settled and is still debated at executive level.

===2022 BT and Openreach industrial dispute and strike===

In June 2022, the CWU conducted its first company-wide industrial action ballot in BT Group since 1987. In Openreach, where 28,425 CWU members were entitled to vote, participants recorded a 95.8% ‘yes’ vote for industrial action on a 74.8% turnout. In BT, where 10,353 were issued with ballot papers, another ‘yes’ vote of 91.5% was recorded on a 58.2% turnout.

The CWU hoped that such an overwhelming demonstration of workforce anger would persuade management back to the negotiating table were, however, met with BT categorically refusing to re-open 2022 pay negotiations.

As a result, the first national industrial action in BT Group for three and a half decades took place on 29 July and 1 August – with the all-out strike days being solidly observed by members in both BT and Openreach.

Two further all-out strike days took place on Tuesday 30 and Wednesday 31 August. 

Following this, another four days of strike action was announced for Thursday 6 October, Monday 10 October, Thursday 20 October and Monday 24 October.

The dispute, which involves more than 40,000 CWU members working for BT and Openreach, was triggered by BT’s unilateral imposition of real-terms pay cuts for all CWU-represented grades.

==Affiliations==
===Labour Party===
The CWU has long been affiliated with the Labour Party; for example Alan Johnson, a previous General Secretary, later became a Labour Member of Parliament (MP) and ultimately held a number of Cabinet posts including Home Secretary. Since 2001, the CWU has donated over £9million to the Labour Party but relationships became strained over Labour plans to privatise Royal Mail in 2007 and Dave Ward, the CWU&#x27;s representative on the Labour Party&#x27;s National Executive Committee announced he was stepping down from this role because he believed it conflicted with the interests of union members. He was replaced by Andy Kerr.

At the CWU Annual Conference 2008 there was much debate about the union&#x27;s relationship with Labour. It was agreed, and remains union policy that a ballot would be held to cease funds to the party if privatisation of postal services took place. As the privatisation proposal from the Labour government in 2009, the Postal Services Bill, was defeated through the unions campaign, led by the left wing Labour loyalist and long term General Secretary Billy Hayes, with the support of Labour backbenchers, affiliation has remained in place.

Since the election of the Conservative–Liberal Democrat coalition government the union has sought to re-define its relationship with the Labour Party. In July 2010 the union&#x27;s National Executive Committee agreed to nominate and support Ed Balls MP for Labour leader in the 2010 leadership ballot. In turn, Ed Balls MP supported the unions Keep The Post Public campaign in the summer of 2010 in opposition of the planned coalition government&#x27;s intention to privatise Royal Mail.

In September 2015, CWU endorsed Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s campaign in the Labour Party leadership election.

In August 2017, it was announced that the organisation will formally affiliate to Momentum after its ruling executive voted unanimously in favour to join the organisation. General secretary Dave Ward, told the &quot;New Statesman&quot; that &quot;the general election showed the value of Momentum as part of the wider labour movement&quot;, and that the body, which emerged from Corbyn&#x27;s 2015 leadership campaign, was now &quot;a major political force in the UK&quot;, saying it had a &quot;key role to play in securing a transformative Labour government&quot;.

===1st Class Credit Union===

1st Class Credit Union Limited was formed in 1992, as Glasgow District Postal Workers Credit Union, it became the Scottish Postal Workers Credit Union in 1998, before adopting the present name in 2007. A member of the Association of British Credit Unions Limited, it is open to members and employees of the CWU.

The credit union is authorised by the Prudential Regulation Authority and regulated by the Financial Conduct Authority and the PRA. Ultimately, like the banks and building societies, members’ savings are protected against business failure by the Financial Services Compensation Scheme.

In 2016, it was awarded a large grant of £60,000 by the Lloyds Banking Group Credit Union Development Fund to strengthen its capital asset ratio.

<text>Slavoljub Eduard Penkala (; 20 April 1871 – 5 February 1922) was a Croatian engineer and inventor.

==Biography==
Eduard Penkala was born in Liptószentmiklós (now Liptovský Mikuláš in Slovakia), then part of Austria-Hungary, to Franciszek Pękała, who was of Polish heritage, and Maria Pękała (née Hannel), who was of Dutch descent. He attended the University of Vienna and Royal Saxon Polytechnic Institute, graduating from the latter on March 25, 1898, and going on to earn a doctorate in organic chemistry. During his studies, he attended violin lessons where he met his future wife, pianist Emily Stoffregen. He then moved with his wife to Zagreb (which was then in the Kingdom of Croatia-Slavonia). To mark his loyalty to his new homeland, he took on the Croatian name Slavoljub (Croatian for &quot;slavophile&quot;), becoming a naturalized Croat.

He became renowned for further development of the mechanical pencil (1906) - then called an &quot;automatic pencil&quot; - and the first solid-ink fountain pen (1907). On 24 January 1906 he registered the patent for an automatic pencil. Collaborating with an entrepreneur by the name of Edmund Moster, he started the Penkala-Moster Company and built a pen-and-pencil factory that was one of the biggest in the world at the time. As the business grew, a second factory was set up in Berlin. The company, now called TOZ Penkala, still exists today.

He also constructed the first Croatian aircraft to fly in the country, the Penkala 1910 Biplane, flown by Dragutin Novak, who was also the first Croatian pilot. He constructed and invented many other products and devices, and held a total of 80 patents.

Among his patented inventions were:

* a hot water bottle - his first patented invention, the &quot;Termofor&quot;
* a type of bluing detergent
* a rail-car brake
* an anode battery

He also founded another company called the Elevator Chemical Manufacturing Company, which produced various chemicals such as detergents, sealing wax, and &quot;Radium Vinovica&quot;, a patent-medicine – like product that was billed as curing rheumatism.

He had four children with his wife, Emily.

Penkala died in Zagreb at the age of 50, after catching pneumonia on a business trip. He was buried at the Mirogoj Cemetery.

<text>Camperdown is an area of Dundee, Scotland, best known for Camperdown Park, which is the largest park in the city.

The name is Dutch in origin, being the English version of Kamperduin, a village of the North Holland province (north of Haarlem) on the North Sea coast of the Netherlands. This is because Adam Duncan (1 July 1731 – 4 August 1804), defeated the Dutch fleet off there on 11 October 1797 in the Battle of Camperdown. His home, Camperdown House, was in turn named after this, and then gave its name to the area.

The Dundee Ice Arena is located in the area, on the north side of the Kingsway (A90) ring road. If completed according to 2022 plans (revised in 2023), Dundee F.C.&#x27;s new stadium to replace Dens Park would also be sited there.

==Camperdown Country Park==
Camperdown Country Park, often known as just Camperdown Park, is a public park in the Camperdown area of Dundee. The park is the location of Camperdown House, a wildlife centre and many other recreational facilities. It is the largest park in Dundee, stretching to . Over 190 species of tree are found in the park. It is located three miles north-west of Dundee city centre.

<text>The Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (TGWU or T&amp;G) was one of the largest general trade unions in the United Kingdom and Ireland—where it was known as the Amalgamated Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (ATGWU)—with 900,000 members (and was once the largest trade union in the world).

The TGWU was officially founded on 1 January 1922 with the amalgamation of 14 individual trades unions. Ernest Bevin served as the union&#x27;s first and longest serving General Secretary.

In 2007, the union voted to merge with Amicus to form Unite the Union.

==History==

=== Establishment ===

In March 1920, the London-based Dock, Wharf, Riverside &amp; General Labourers&#x27; Union (DWRGLU) began talks on forming a unified dockworkers&#x27; union with the Liverpool-based National Union of Dock, Riverside and General Workers (NUDRW). 

The two unions&#x27; delegations agreed on a provisional amalgamation committee with Ernest Bevin as its Secretary, and Harry Gosling as its chair, with the committee agreeing to invite other unions related to the docks industry.

In ballots of the various unions on amalgamation, only the ballots put to the Amalgamated Stevedores Labour Protection League, the Scottish Union of Dock Labourers (SUDW) and the Cardiff Coal Trimmers memberships failed.

While the new union was being established, the official publication of the union, &quot;The Record&quot;, published its first issue in August 1921. The first issue cited its predecessor publications as the &quot;Dockers&#x27; Record&quot; of the DWRGLU; &quot;Quayside and Office&quot; of the National Union of Docks, Wharves and Shipping Staffs; &quot;The Record&quot; of the United Vehicle Workers; and &quot;The Vehicle Worker&quot; of the National Union of Vehicle Workers.

On 1 January 1922, fourteen trades unions officially amalgamated to form the Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (TGWU), with Ernest Bevin as its first General Secretary. At amalgamation the union had 300,000 members. 

The Irish Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (ITGWU) had tentatively taken part in the negotiations, however the talks with the ITGWU broke down. The ITGWU initially challenged the name of the TGWU, claiming that the similar titles would cause confusion. Compromise was reached when the TGWU agreed to operate under the name Amalgamated Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union (ATGWU) within Ireland.

The NUDRW amalgamated into the TGWU later in 1922, and despite initially voting against the ballot, so did the SUDW. Through the NUDRW and the DWR&amp;GLU, the TGWU inherited a number of active branches in Ireland in Belfast, Carrick-on-Suir, Clonmel, Cork, Derry, Drogheda, Dundalk, Newry and Waterford. The Irish membership of the TGWU in 1922 amounted to 8,000, or just over 2.65% of the union&#x27;s total membership.

=== Early years ===
For the first two years of its existence, the TGWU lost members, and continued to lose members for another four out of eight years.

In 1923, an unofficial London dock strike caused a fissure in the TGWU, and resulted in some docks members joining the now-rival Amalgamated Stevedores Labour Protection League union. While the issue failed to create a larger defection, the two unions would come into conflict multiple times.

In 1929, the Workers&#x27; Union amalgamated into the TGWU. Despite being named as a general workers union, the TGWU was primarily made up of workers in the union&#x27;s four transport Trade Groups—Docks, Waterways, Commercial Road Transport, and Passenger Road Transport. As of 1928, the four transport groups made up 220,000 members of the TGWU in comparison the General Workers Trade Group which constituted only 68,000. With amalgamation, the TGWU&#x27;s membership increased by 100,000 members, the majority of whom joined its General Workers Group, making the group the largest. This increase in General Trade Group members garnered the Union the recognition and infrastructure to recruit new members outside of the transport sector.

== Structure ==
The Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union structure combined regional organisation, based on Districts and Areas, with committee organisation by occupation, based on six broad Trade Groups. Trade groups were not closely linked to trades, but were elected by activists. Officials of the union were grouped by region, and could be asked to serve each or any trade group.

===Docks Group===
The Docks Group was created in 1922 to represent members of the following unions:
*Dock, Wharf, Riverside and General Labourers&#x27; Union of Great Britain and Ireland
*South Side Labour Protection League (London, est. 1889)
*National Amalgamated Coal Porters&#x27; Union of Inland and Seaborne Coal Workers (London, est. 1889)
*National Amalgamated Labourers&#x27; Union of Great Britain and Ireland (Cardiff, est. 1889)
*North of England Trimmers&#x27; and Teemers&#x27; Association (est. 1871)

The group originally had a subsection for coal shipping. In 1928, it had 96,000 members, but over time, membership of the group declined along with employment on the docks, dropping to 56,000 in 1966, and had 51,153 in 1980.

===Waterways Group===
The Waterways Group was created in 1922 to represent members of the Amalgamated Society of Watermen, Lightermen and Bargemen. Always one of the smallest sections, it had only 8,000 members in 1928, and 16,000 in 1966. In 1970, it was merged into the Docks Group.

===Administrative, Clerical and Supervisory Group===
The Administrative, Clerical and Supervisory Group was created in 1922 to represent members of the following unions:
*National Association of Ships&#x27; Clerks, Grain Weighers and Coalmeters
*National Union of Docks, Wharves and Shipping Staffs

There was often ambiguity in the TGWU over the actual name of its white-collar section. From the 1960s it was generally known as ACTS (Administrative, Clerical, Technical and Supervisory) but also sometimes as the ACTSS (Association of Clerical, Technical and Supervisory Staff) and enamel union badges bearing both sets of initials were produced for members. It was noted for an enquiry by the Certification Office in 2006 into board members who had joined the union within six months of being elected to senior posts.

The group grew significantly over time, having only 5,000 members in 1928, but 62,000 by 1966, and 149,801 members in 1980.

===Road Transport (Passenger and Commercial) Groups===
The Road Transport group was created in 1922 to represent members of the following unions:
*Amalgamated Association of Carters and Motormen (Leeds, est. 1916)
*Amalgamated Carters, Lurrymen and Motormen&#x27;s Union (Bolton, est. 1890)
*Associated Horsemen&#x27;s Union (Greenock, est. 1894)
*National Union of Vehicle Workers
*North of Scotland Horse and Motormen&#x27;s Association (Dundee, 1911)
*United Vehicle Workers

Later in 1922, the group was split into Road Transport (Passenger) and Road Transport (Commercial) groups. The Passenger group had 79,000 members in 1928 and 181,000 in 1966, but by 1980, the renamed Passenger Services group had dropped to only 44,501 members. The Commercial Services group rose from 37,000 members in 1928 to 219,000 in 1966, and 226,290 in 1980.

===General Workers Group===
The General Workers Group was created in 1922 to cater for all workers in jobs which did not fall into another group. Initially, it had subsections for workers in metal and chemical trades. Once it was considered that a particular field had enough members to justify its own trade group, it was split out. These decisions were made at the Biennial Delegate Conference, and although there were many applications to form new trade groups, most were unsuccessful. The group had 68,000 members in 1928, and it then doubled in size when the Workers&#x27; Union merged into the TGWU. By 1966, it had 338,000 members and, despite the splitting out of further groups in 1970, by 1980 it still had 269,845 members.

The first groups to be split out were:
* Power Workers, formed in 1926 from the National Amalgamated Union of Enginemen, Firemen, Mechanics, Motormen and Electrical Workers. It had 20,000 members in 1928, rising to 41,000 by 1966.
* Engineering, formed in 1931, principally from members of the Workers&#x27; Union. By 1966, it had 269,000 members.
* Government, formed in 1943, with 58,000 members by 1966.
* Municipal, formed in 1945, with 44,000 members by 1966.
* Agricultural, formed in 1945, with 13,000 members by 1966.
* joined by the National Union of Agricultural and Allied Workers 
* Building, formed in 1953, with 53,000 members by 1966.
* Chemical, formed in 1953, with 61,000 members by 1966.

===Later mergers===

The Scottish Union of Dock Labourers and the National Union of Dock, Riverside and General Workers in Great Britain and Ireland initially voted not to amalgamate as founding members, but a new voted changed their position, and they joined before the end of 1922, along with the Amalgamated Carters, Lurrymen and Motormen&#x27;s Union, the Greenock Sugar Porters&#x27; Union, the Dundee Flax and Jute Stowers&#x27; Society, the National Union of British Fishermen, and the Belfast Breadservers&#x27; Association. Some of these unions retained a great deal of autonomy and in many ways effectively functioned as separate unions, even being registered separately with the Registrar of Friendly Societies The biggest merger was with the Workers&#x27; Union in 1929, the union being fully integrated into the TGWU in 1931.

==Campaigns==
The Transport and General Workers&#x27; Union spearheaded the campaign for the registration of Gangmasters in the UK, sponsoring an Act of Parliament which received the Royal Assent on 8 July 2004.

== Merger with Amicus ==
During 2005 discussions started between the TGWU, Amicus and the GMB about the possibility of merging the three unions into one organisation with potentially 2.5 million members covering almost every sector of the economy. On 14 June 2006 the GMB Conference voted not to continue with discussions.

The TGWU and Amicus proceeded without GMB involvement, with delegates from the two unions approving the proposed &#x27;Instrument of Amalgamation&#x27; at a special conference on 18 December 2006. The ballot of both unions&#x27; membership during February and early March 2007, approved the merger. The result of the ballot was announced on 8 March 2007: 86.4 per cent of T&amp;G members and 70.1 per cent of Amicus members voted to support the merger, from a turnout of 27% in both cases.

The press release announced that the resulting union had the working title &quot;New Union&quot; and the name would be decided by a ballot of the membership. On 2 April 2007, &quot;The Times&quot; reported that the name Unite had been chosen. and that full merger of rule books and governing bodies may soon follow the existing merger of personnel and finance departments.

It was negotiated that both Derek Simpson, General Secretary of Amicus, and Tony Woodley General Secretary of TGWU, would serve as Joint-General Secretaries of Unite until December 2010 and that Tony Woodley would serve alone until January 2012. Despite this Woodley resigned January 2011, a year earlier than planned.
