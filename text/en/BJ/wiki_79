<text>HMS &quot;Warrior was a [[light aircraft carrier]] which was ordered in 1942 by the British [[Royal Navy]] during [[World War II]]. Construction was finished in 1945 and upon completion, the aircraft carrier was loaned to the [[Royal Canadian Navy]] from 1946 to 1948 asHMCS &quot;Warrior. &quot;Warrior&quot; was returned to the Royal Navy in 1948 and entered service with the British. While in service with the Royal Navy, &quot;Warrior&quot; was modernised twice, including the installation of an angled flight deck in 1956. In 1948–1949, the ship was used in aircraft landing experiments and fitted with a rubber flight deck and in 1957, was used as the headquarters ship during nuclear testing at Christmas Island. In 1958, the vessel was sold to the Argentine Navy and entered Argentine service in 1959 as ARA &quot;Independencia&quot;. The aircraft carrier remained in service until 1970 when &quot;Independencia&quot; was placed in reserve. The following year, the ship was sold for scrap.

==Description==

&quot;Warrior&quot; was a &quot;Colossus&quot;-class light aircraft carrier that was long between perpendiculars and overall with a beam at the waterline of and an overall width of . The ship had a mean draught of . &quot;Warrior&quot; had a standard displacement of when built and a full load displacement of . The aircraft carrier had a flight deck long that was wide and was above the water. The flight deck tapered to at the bow. For takeoffs, the flight deck was equipped with one BH 3 aircraft catapult capable of launching aircraft at . For landings, the ship was fitted with 10 arrestor wires capable of stopping a aircraft, with two safety barriers rated at stopping a 15,000-pound aircraft at &quot;Warrior&quot; had two aircraft lifts located along the centreline of the ship that were and could handle aircraft up to 15,000 pounds on a 36-second cycle. The aircraft hangar was with a further section beyond the aft elevator, all with a clearance of . The hangar was divided into four sections by asbestos fire curtains. The hangar was fully enclosed and could only be entered by air locks and the lifts, due to the hazardous nature of aviation fuel and oil vapours. The vessel had stowage for of aviation fuel.

The ship was powered by steam created by four Admiralty 3-drum type boilers driving two Parsons geared turbines, each turning one shaft. The machinery was split into two spaces, each containing two boilers and one turbine, separated by spaces containing aviation fuel. The spaces were situated &quot;en echelon&quot; within the ship to prevent a single disabling torpedo strike. The engines were rated at and the vessel had a capacity for of fuel oil, with a range of at . The ship&#x27;s maximum speed was . There was no armour aboard the vessel save for mantlets around the torpedo storage area. There were no longitudinal bulkheads, but the transverse bulkheads were designed to allow the ship to survive two complete sections of the ship being flooded.

&quot;Warrior&quot; was designed to handle up to 42 aircraft. The aircraft carrier carried a wide range of ordnance for their aircraft from torpedoes, depth charges, bombs, 20 mm cannon ammunition and flares. For anti-aircraft defence, the aircraft carrier was initially armed with four twin-mounted and twenty single-mounted 40 mm Bofors guns. The original radar installation included the Type 79 and Type 281 long-range air search radars, the Type 293 and Type 277 fighter direction radar and the &quot;YE&quot; aircraft homing beacon. The ship had a maximum ship&#x27;s company of 1,300, which was reduced in peacetime.

==Construction and career==
The contract to construct &quot;Warrior&quot; was placed on 7 August 1942. &quot;Warrior&quot; was built by Harland and Wolff at their yard in Belfast and given the yard number 1224, originally to be called &quot;Brave&quot;. Before construction began, once-innovative armoured frigate (at the time just a floating oil jetty) was renamed to &quot;Oil Fuel Hulk C77&quot; in August 1942 to free up her name, and the carrier was renamed to &quot;Warrior&quot;. Her keel was laid down on 12 December 1942, she was launched on 20 May 1944 and became the last of the &quot;Colossus&quot; class to finish construction. The Royal Navy had originally intended to rush &quot;Warrior&quot; into service for operations in the Indian Ocean during the Second World War, thus she was built without heaters for some onboard equipment since heat was unnecessary in tropical operations.

===Royal Canadian Navy service===
As the focus of future operations at sea during the Second World War shifted to the Pacific theatre, planning began in May 1944 that the Royal Canadian Navy (RCN) would require a larger fleet both in numbers and in size of ships. In the effort to get bigger, the RCN returned the escort carriers then on loan, and , in exchange for the loan of two light fleet carriers. A formal approach was first made in July, with negotiations being finalised in April 1945 when &quot;Warrior&quot; and were acquired on loan with the option to purchase them outright at a later date. Negotiations were completed in May for the naval air squadrons that would be needed to man the aircraft carrier, but the war ended before the ships were completed.

After the agreement with Canada went through, Canadian naval aviation was established with the formation of four squadrons transferred from the Fleet Air Arm intended to fly from &quot;Warrior&quot;; 803 Squadron and 883 Squadron equipped with Supermarine Seafires and 825 Squadron and 826 Squadron with Fairey Fireflys. &quot;Warrior&quot; was completed, transferred to the RCN and commissioned as HMCS &quot;Warrior&quot; on 24 January 1946 and placed under the command of Captain Frank Houghton. Sea trials were completed in March and flying trials were performed at Spithead following that. For the voyage to Canada, 803 and 825 Squadrons were embarked, while 883 and 826 Squadrons were paid off.

&quot;Warrior&quot; entered Halifax harbour on 31 March 1946, a week after leaving Portsmouth. She was escorted by the destroyer and the minesweeper , having officially joined the Canadian Atlantic Fleet on 23 March. April through May was spent alongside fixing builder&#x27;s defects before the ship began major fleet operations. In August, the aircraft carrier had its first loss, when a Firefly from 825 Squadron ditched, though both the pilot and observer were recovered. That same month, on 23 August while transiting the St. Lawrence River, &quot;Warrior&quot; ran aground at Pointe Sainte Antoine, near Montreal while en route to the city after her rudder jammed. Tugboats got the aircraft carrier unstuck from the mud bank she had run into the same day and &quot;Warrior&quot; continued on to Montreal where she became the largest ship to visit that port to that date.
The RCN experienced problems with the unheated equipment during operations in cold North Atlantic waters off eastern Canada during 1946. The ship was transferred west to Esquimalt, British Columbia in November 1946, visiting Bermuda, Acapulco, Mexico and San Diego, California before arriving in December. On 18 January 1947, Commodore Harry DeWolf took command of &quot;Warrior&quot; while the vessel was undergoing repairs to the damages to her hull that had been received during her August grounding. On 31 January, one 825 Squadron&#x27;s Fireflys was lost along with its pilot off Portland Island during a training mission. It was during this period, that the RCN, facing reduced defence spending and manning constraints, came to the conclusion that they could not operate two aircraft carriers. Negotiations began to return &quot;Warrior&quot; when &quot;Magnificent&quot; became ready, with the RCN deeming &quot;Warrior&quot; unfit for service due to her lack of heating. In February 1947, the aircraft carrier began her voyage back to Halifax, accompanied by the cruiser and destroyer . The Canadian group stopped at San Pedro, California before the aircraft carrier transited the Panama Canal by herself, meeting the destroyers and &quot;Micmac&quot; on the other side. The three Canadian ships visited Havana, Cuba, marking the first time a Canadian warship had visited the Cuban capital since 1929. &quot;Warrior&quot; returned to Halifax on 27 March. The ship then sailed for Bermuda with &quot;Nootka&quot; to take part in a naval exercise with the Royal Navy. Most of mid-1947 was spent undergoing repairs at Halifax and performing short cruises along east coast. In August, &quot;Warrior&quot; sailed for the United Kingdom where her squadrons would be re-equipped with Firefly Mark IV and Hawker Sea Fury aircraft, returning to Halifax on 28 August. Meanwhile, preparations were being made for the return of &quot;Warrior&quot; and the acquisition of &quot;Magnificent&quot;. In November, &quot;Magnificent&quot;″s air group consisting of 826 and 883 Squadrons trained aboard &quot;Warrior&quot; off the coast of Nova Scotia. Following this, &quot;Warrior&quot;, escorted by the destroyer sailed to Bermuda where the ship was prepared to be paid off. The ship sailed for the UK on 12 February, arriving at Belfast on 20 February. On 1 March the ship moved to Spithead where the aviation fuel was removed. &quot;Warrior&quot; was returned to the Royal Navy on 23 March 1948 at Portsmouth.

===Royal Navy service===
HMCS &quot;Warrior&quot; returned to the United Kingdom and was recommissioned as HMS &quot;Warrior&quot; on 23 March 1948. &quot;Warrior&quot; was then refitted at Devonport and equipped with a flexible flight deck to test the feasibility of receiving undercarriage-less aircraft; modified de Havilland Sea Vampire aircraft were used to test the concept, which was successful but not introduced into service. The flexible deck was composed of a rubber sheet supported by air bags. The new deck extended from the bow to the barrier forward of the island and was superimposed on the existing flight deck. Aft of the flexible deck, a light steel ramp was placed over the flight deck rising to in height with a single arrestor wire. The trials lasted from November 1948 to March 1949 and upon completion, &quot;Warrior&quot; was paid off into the reserve at Portsmouth.
&quot;Warrior&quot; was reactivated in June 1950 and modified to carry troops and aircraft to the Far East during the Korean War, departing in August on the first such mission. In June 1951, with 16 Parachute Brigade embarked, &quot;Warrior&quot; sailed to Cyprus in response to a crisis in the Middle East. The ship underwent refit during most of 1952 and 1953 at Devonport Dockyard. The ship was fitted with a new lattice mast and new radars with Type 281Q fitted to the mast and Type 277Q radars installed fore and aft of the island. Identification friend or foe aerials were also installed on the mast. The bridge was enlarged and enclosed. The Fleet Air Arm 811 Squadron in Sea Furys and 825 Squadron in Fireflys were embarked after sea trials. During 1954, &quot;Warrior&quot; was deployed to the Far East, patrolling off the coast of Korea, following the ceasefire. In September, during Operation Passage to Freedom, the ship was among those sent to evacuate non-Communist refugees from Haiphong, North Vietnam to Vung Tau, South Vietnam, transporting more than 3,221 people in two voyages and being awarded a South Vietnamese Presidential Citation.

After returning to England another refit was carried out in 1955 at Devonport. This time &quot;Warrior&quot; received an angled flight deck of 5 degrees for trials. To install the angled deck, portside sponsons were removed, the angled deck installed portside amidships and the deck itself was upgraded to take aircraft up to . Furthermore, the catapult was upgraded to launch 20,000-pound aircraft and the arrester wire system improved to take the same weight of aircraft at . The aircraft carrier also received a mirror landing aid and Type 961 CCA radar. As the only ship in the class to receive the upgrade, it was intended to turn &quot;Warrior&quot; into a training and trials ship.

Following a short period as a training ship, &quot;Warrior&quot; was dispatched to the Pacific Ocean, where the aircraft carrier took part in Operation Grapple, the first British hydrogen bomb tests, as the headquarters ship embarking a flight of Westland Whirlwind helicopters and Grumman Avenger AS4 aircraft to collect air samples from the tests and ferry them back for examination. After the operation was completed the Avengers were catapulted into the sea as they were contaminated with radioactivity. Considered surplus to requirements by the late 1950s, the Royal Navy decommissioned &quot;Warrior&quot; in February 1958 and offered her for sale. The return voyage from the Grapple tests was via Argentina, with port visits and demonstrations to the Argentine Navy, to whom the Admiralty was trying to sell her.

=== Argentine Navy service ===

&quot;Warrior&quot; was sold to Argentina in 1958 and renamed ARA &quot;Independencia&quot; on 6 August 1958. The Argentine naval ensign was raised on 4 November at Portsmouth and sailed for Argentina on 10 December. The Argentine Naval Aviation began air operations from &quot;Independencia&quot; on 8 June 1959, even before the vessel was officially commissioned into the fleet. The ship was commissioned into the Argentine Navy on 8 July 1959. The anti-aircraft armament was initially reduced to twelve 40 mm guns, soon further reduced to eight. In May 1962 the ship was however provided with one quadruple and nine double mountings of that caliber. After all the modifications the displacement of the ship had climbed to while the vessel&#x27;s maximum speed had declined to .

The air group, which had a maximum of 24 aircraft, was mainly formed from Vought F4U Corsairs, North American SNJ-5Cs Texans and Grumman S2F-1 (S-2A) Trackers. Naval Aviation inventory also included Grumman F9F Panther (the first jet fighters in service with the Argentine Naval Aviation, starting from August 1963 which launched from &quot;Independencia&quot;) and TF-9J Cougar jets, although &quot;Independencia&quot;&#x27;s catapult was not powerful enough to launch them. The ship also used the North American T-28 Trojan trainer. The aircraft carrier , also of the British but with a more powerful catapult retrofitted while in Dutch service, entered service in 1969, and &quot;Independencia&quot; moved to the reserve in 1970. She was scrapped in 1971.

<text>The common dolphin (Delphinus delphis) is the most abundant cetacean in the world, with a global population of about six million. Despite this fact and its vernacular name, the common dolphin is not thought of as the archetypal dolphin, with that distinction belonging to the bottlenose dolphin due to its popular appearances in aquaria and the media. However, the common dolphin is often depicted in Ancient Greek and Roman art and culture, most notably in a mural painted by the Greek Minoan civilization.

It is presently the only member of the genus Delphinus. The common dolphin belongs to the subfamily Delphininae, making this dolphin closely related to the three different species of bottlenose dolphins, humpback dolphin, striped dolphin, spinner dolphin, Clymene dolphin, spotted dolphin, Fraser&#x27;s dolphin, the tucuxi and Guiana dolphin. The common dolphin was previously categorized into two different species (now thought to be ecotypes), the short-beaked common dolphin and the long-beaked common dolphin. However, recent evidence has shown that many populations of long-beaked common dolphins around the world are not closely related to one another and are often derived from a short-beaked ancestor and do not always share common derived characteristics. For this reason, they are no longer considered different species.

==Physical characteristics==
Common dolphin are medium-sized dolphins; adults range between long, and can weigh between , although the range between is more common. Males are generally longer and heavier. The color pattern on the body is unusual. The back is dark and the belly is white, while on each side is an hourglass pattern colored light grey, yellow, or gold in front and dirty grey in back. They have long, thin rostra with up to 50–60 small, sharp, interlocking teeth on each side of each jaw.

==Taxonomy==

Despite the historic practice of lumping the entire genus &quot;Delphinus&quot; into a single species, these widely distributed dolphins exhibit a wide variety of sizes, shapes and colors. Indeed, over the past few decades, over 20 distinct species in the genus have been proposed. Scientists in California in the 1960s concluded there were two species — the long-beaked and short-beaked. The long-beaked common dolphin was thought to have a disjointed range in coastal areas in tropical and warmer temperate oceans. The range included parts of western and southern Africa, much of western South America, central California to central Mexico, coastal Peru, areas around Japan, Korea and Taiwan, and possibly near Oman. Vagrants have been recorded as far north as Vancouver Island.

This analysis was seemingly confirmed by a more in-depth genetic study in the 1990s. This study also suggested a third species (&quot;D. tropicalis&quot;, common name usually Arabian common dolphin or Indo-Pacific common dolphin), characterized by an extremely long and thin beak and found in the Red Sea and Indian Ocean, might be distinguished from the long-beaked species. The current standard taxonomic works recognize this as a subspecies of &quot;D. delphis&quot; rather than a separate species.

Recent evidence has demonstrated that different populations of long-beaked common dolphins around the world are not closely related to one another and are often derived from a short-beaked ancestor (as well as not sharing common derived characters). Therefore, long-beaked and short-beaked common dolphins are now listed as the same species under the scientific name of &quot;Delphinus delphis&quot;. Currently, the common dolphin is divided into four subspecies:
*&quot;D. d. delphis&quot;, the nominate subspecies
*&quot;D. d. bairdii&quot;, the Eastern North Pacific long-beaked common dolphin (though some elevate this to species)
*&quot;D. d. ponticus&quot;, the Black Sea common dolphin
*&quot;D. d. tropicalis&quot;, the Indo-Pacific common dolphin

===Fossil record===
Many extinct cetacean species were once lumped into &quot;Delphinus&quot;, but have since been placed in other genera. In the late 19th century several fossil species were described, including taxa: &quot;Delphinus baltringii&quot;, &quot;Delphinus delannoy&quot; and &quot;Delphinus domeykoi&quot;. However, these species are no longer considered valid. Another species known as &quot;Delphinus brevidens&quot; was reassigned to the genus &quot;Stereodelphis&quot; which is now generally considered synonymous with &quot;Squalodon&quot;.

==Natural history==

Common dolphins live in both warm-temperate and tropical waters ranging from 40–60°N to 50°S. Long-beaked common dolphins mostly inhabit shallow, warm coastal water. Short-beaked common dolphins are common &quot;along shelf edges and in areas with sharp bottom relief such as seamounts and escarpments&quot;. Common dolphins have a varied diet consisting of many species of fish and squid. This includes both mesopelagic species and epipelagic schooling species. They have been recorded to make dives up to deep.

Common dolphins are a widely distributed species. They can be found around the world in both offshore and coastal waters. In the Northwest Atlantic, they can be found from Cape Hatteras North Carolina, to Newfoundland and are strongly associated with the Gulf Stream. Dolphins in this region can often be found in areas that have certain geological factors like underwater canyons and ridges because this is where up-welling occurs which result in greater nutrients. In the Eastern Pacific, common dolphins are found along the coast of California and are associated with the California current. Short-beaked common dolphins can also be found in Europe, particularly the Scotian shelf, the Black Sea and the Mediterranean. In the Southern Hemisphere, they are abundant in the southwestern Pacific, around New Zealand and southern Australia. They are generally a pelagic species that are often found in waters 650–6,500 feet deep, with the short-beaked type preferring deeper waters than the long-beaked type Temperature also plays a large role in the congregation of dolphins. For example, in the western North Atlantic, almost all sightings of common dolphins took place in waters from 16 to 20 °C. However, there were common dolphin sightings in waters as low as 5 °C.

Common dolphins can live in aggregations of hundreds or even thousands of dolphins. Common dolphins are often seen in groups numbering several hundred individuals (with subgroups consisting of 20–30 individuals). Occasionally, different groups will come together to form mega-pods which can consist of over 10,000 dolphins. Genetic studies in the Northeast Atlantic suggest that common dolphin pods generally do not consist of close kin, but rather of members that are not closely related. Unlike many delphinids, common dolphins do not live in a matriarchal society. That being said, closely related individuals are usually found in similar geographical locations fairly consistently, providing evidence that this species displays site fidelity (at least in the Northeastern Atlantic). Male common dolphins display greater site fidelity in relation to their kin than females. Common dolphin pod structure often consists of nursery pods (which includes females and calves), bachelor pods (consisting of all males) and mixed groups of males and females, including sub-adults and calves. Genetic evidence seems to indicate that common dolphins live in fission-fusion societies, where dolphins form pods that are not necessarily stable and do not necessarily consist of related individuals. It is not known if common dolphins form lifelong bonds with other individuals like the long-term male alliances seen in bottlenose dolphins.

There is some evidence that common dolphins use signature whistles, similar to that of the bottlenose dolphin. These whistles are believed to serve as an acoustic label, and provide identification information similar to that of a name.  It takes approximately 1 year for a calf to learn its signature whistle after which it remains stable for the rest of a dolphin&#x27;s life. In South Africa, as many as 29 common dolphin signature whistle types were detected. However, it was difficult to determine if each dolphin had its own signature whistle due to the vast number of dolphins present (over 1,000) and anthropogenic background noise. Additionally, considering the vast number of dolphins present and  taking into account their feeding and diving behavior, it appears that common dolphin signature whistles are also used for group cohesion. Another hypothesis for the function of signature whistles is that they serve as a beacon for lost individuals.

Common dolphins sometimes associate with other dolphin species, such as pilot whales. In the Gulf of Corinth, common dolphins frequently display mixed species association, especially with striped and Risso&#x27;s dolphins. Over one third of all dolphin sightings in the gulf consisted of mixed species associations that partially consisted of common dolphins. In mixed species associations, the ratio of striped to common dolphins ranged from 6:1 to 11:1. When Risso&#x27;s dolphins were present (there would usually be only one or two individuals), it appeared that many of their scars were the result of interactions with striped and spinner dolphins. In many of the interactions, the Risso&#x27;s dolphins would chase and herd the common dolphins toward the boat, while the common dolphins would try and swim under the Risso&#x27;s dolphins. When groups of common and striped dolphins would charge at each other, the Risso&#x27;s dolphin would chase the striped dolphins. Sometimes these interactions appeared to be playful, and at other times aggressive. Synchronized swimming and surfacing were commonly observed. These interactions take place in the deepest part of the Gulf, furthest from shore, and usually consist of a total of about 60 dolphins from all three species.

There have been confirmed cases of hybridization between striped and common dolphins in this region. There have been 15 cases of common dolphin and striped dolphin hybrids. Genetic and observational evidence has demonstrated that the hybrids are fertile and are capable of not only reproducing with other hybrids, but are capable of reproducing with each of the parent species. Striped dolphins have been known to mate with other dolphins, as the Clymene dolphin is the result of hybrid speciation between striped and spinner dolphins. However, this is unlikely to happen with common dolphins, as their population in the Gulf of Corinth is too low. Common dolphins and bottlenose dolphins have been known to interbreed in captivity. There is one confirmed case of a hybrid between a bottlenose and common dolphin in southern Spain, an important feeding ground for both species. The mother was a female bottlenose dolphin (dubbed Billie) who had spent 10 years in a common dolphin pod. Billie was observed assisting common calves reach the surface three different times and would babysit the calves after the mother went through labor. The length of the calf was similar to that of a bottlenose dolphin calf, with the lateral stripes and coloration of a common dolphin. The calf was seen with its mother almost daily on dolphin-watching tours among a nursery pod of common dolphins which also contained some immature striped dolphins. Sightings of the calf took place when temperatures were between 14 and 26 °C. The calf was mainly observed swimming alongside the mother and was seen rubbing its head on its mother, jumping backwards over its mother and engaging in flipper-to flipper, belly-to flipper and belly-to belly contact. 

Common dolphins have been observed bow riding on baleen whales, and they also bow ride on boats. They are fast swimmers, and breaching behavior and aerial acrobatics are common with this species. They are known to display altruistic behaviors to support injured members.

The short-beaked common dolphin has a gestation period of 10 to 11 months. The newborn calf has a length of and weighs about . For the Black Sea population, weaning occurs at between five and six months, but occurs later (up to about 19 months) in other areas. Typical interbirth interval ranges from one year for the Black Sea population to three years for eastern Pacific Ocean populations. Age of sexual maturity also varies by location, but can range between 2 and 7 years for females and 3 and 12 years for males. No evidence exists of any major reproductive differences between the two species. In captivity, the long-beaked common dolphin has hybridized with the common bottlenose dolphin (&quot;Tursiops truncatus&quot;). One of the hybrids has been bred back to a bottlenose dolphin, demonstrating such hybrids are fertile.

===Conservation===
The common dolphin is probably the most abundant cetacean species on the planet, and the overall species is listed as Least Concern on the IUCN Red List, indicating that it is in no danger of extinction. Abundance has been estimated for most major portions of the species range in the Northern Hemisphere, but only for a few places in the Southern Hemisphere.  In the Pacific Ocean, there are an estimated 1,428,000 off Japan and in the temperate central Pacific Ocean, 969,000 off the U.S. west coast (Carretta et al. 2019); and 2,963,000 in the eastern tropical Pacific. In the Atlantic Ocean, 70,000 are estimated for the western Atlantic Ocean (Waring et al. 2019); 467,000 for European waters; more than 19,400 for the Mediterranean Sea; and several tens of thousands for the Black Sea. In the southern part of the Indo-Pacific Ocean, there are an estimated 20,000-22,000 common dolphins in a small portion of southern Australia (Bilgmann et al. 2017), and 15,000-20,000 off southern Africa.  There are no estimates for the population of dolphins in the northern Indian Ocean.  Taken together, these estimates suggest that well over six million common dolphins inhabit the World&#x27;s oceans.

Common dolphins face a mixture of threats due to human influence. Moderate levels of metal pollutants, which are thought to negatively impact dolphin health, have been measured in some populations. Populations have been hunted off the coast of Peru for use as food and shark bait. In most other areas, the dolphins have not been hunted directly. Several thousand individuals have been caught in industrial trawler nets throughout their range.

Bycatch is the main threat that common dolphins face today. Short-beaked common dolphins are taken as cetacean bycatch the most in all of Europe, given that they are the most abundant dolphin in the Eastern Atlantic. About 1000 short-beaked common dolphins are bycaught in the North Atlantic each year by either tuna drift, trawling and gillnetting. The regulation is that only cetacean bycatch can not be longer than 15 meters and this can lead to be a problem because short-beaked common dolphins are only about 2.7 meters. Common dolphin bycatch is a particularly important issue in Galicia Spain, via trawler fishing. The bycatch of short beaked dolphins in Galicia from May to September from 2001 to 2002, consisted of 394 individuals annually. Depth was an important factor in bycatch, as incidental capture mostly took place along the continental shelf in water less than 300 m deep. Very few entrapments took place when the depth exceeded 300 m. Time of day was also important as most dolphins became trapped in trawling nets at night (most active feeding takes place at night). Most of the dolphins captured were males and had a mean age of 13+- 4.4 years. It is believed that the reason why the vast majority of bycatch consisted of males is because bachelor pods appear to be particularly abundant in Galicia from the May–October season. This fact reinforces the hypothesis that common dolphins may be sexually segregated in the Northeast Atlantic. If there was a ban on fishing in Galicia in waters than less than 250 m deep, and if there were seasonal closures, it is estimated that 78% of the dolphins would not have been caught. In the Western North Atlantic, dolphins are vulnerable to swordfish driftnet fishing, with the number of males being caught as bycatch, doubling the number of females. It was also found from stranding samples that males tend to strand more. This provides evidence of sex-based habitat partitioning or pod congregation.  

Common dolphins were abundant in the western Mediterranean Sea until the 1960s but occurrences there have tailed off rapidly. The reasons are not well understood, but are believed to be due to extensive human activity in the area. In the US, they are a protected species and sometimes are caught by accident in some trawler nets as by-catch, though despite this they are still quite common throughout their range. Despite these potential threats, the short-beaked common dolphin is considered to be Least Concern by the IUCN Red List, and the long-beaked common dolphin is listed as Data Deficient.

The short-beaked common dolphin &quot;Delphinus delphis&quot; is listed globally on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). As amended by the Conference of the Parties in 1985, 1988, 1991, 1994, 1997, 1999, 2002, 2005 and 2008. Effective: 5 March 2009 of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements. The Mediterranean population of the short-beaked common dolphin is also listed on Appendix I, as this population has been categorized as being in danger of extinction throughout all or a significant proportion of their range and CMS Parties strive towards strictly protecting these animals, conserving or restoring the places where they live, mitigating obstacles to migration and controlling other factors that might endanger them. In addition, the species is also covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS) and the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS).

==== Mass stranding events ====
On June 8, 2009, a mass-stranding event (MSE) occurred in Falmouth Bay, Cornwall, United Kingdom. It is believed the MSE was likely caused by naval involvement, as all other factors which cause MSEs in cetaceans appear unlikely to have influenced the event. During the event, 26 common dolphins washed ashore, and about the same number floated back out to sea. There were three other MSEs in the UK before this event, all of unknown cause, from the years 1915 to 1938, but with what are believed to be lower counts of stranded dolphins.

===Captivity===

Common dolphins are not common in captivity. But on at least three occasions, a beached common dolphin in California was nursed back to health at SeaWorld San Diego, but deemed unfit to release back to the ocean. These common dolphins remained at SeaWorld with the bottlenose dolphin exhibit. On one occasion, a male common dolphin managed to impregnate one of the female bottlenose dolphins in the exhibit, leading to four hybrid births. One of the resulting common dolphin/bottlenose dolphin hybrids remained at SeaWorld, San Diego (alternately under the name Cindy or Bullet) while the other (named CJ) was kept at Discovery Cove, and was moved to SeaWorld Orlando in 2016.

Other than at SeaWorld, at least 90 common dolphins are known to have been captured from the wild and kept in captivity. Captured common dolphins are said to be difficult to keep in captivity.

The behavior of captive common dolphins is not very well studied. However, a study was conducted in New Zealand of common dolphin reacting to swimmers at Marineland. Unlike bottlenose dolphins (which demonstrated antagonistic or sexual behaviors), the common dolphins retreated to the refuge center of the pool, where swimmers were not allowed. They did not leave the refuge section until the swimmers left. The dolphins also surfaced much more frequently, which is a possible indicator of stress. Aggressive and playful behavior among the dolphins decreased when swimmers were present. This behavior is consistent with wild common dolphins off of New Zealand, as they actively avoid swimmers.

<text>The 1988 Canadian federal election was held on November 21, 1988, to elect members to the House of Commons of Canada of the 34th Parliament of Canada. It was an election largely fought on a single issue: the Canada–United States Free Trade Agreement (CUSFTA); the Progressive Conservative Party campaigned in favour of it, whereas the Liberal Party and the New Democratic Party (NDP) campaigned against it.

The incumbent prime minister, Brian Mulroney, led his Progressive Conservative Party to a second majority government. Mulroney was the party&#x27;s first leader since John A. Macdonald to win a second majority government.

The Liberal Party experienced a recovery after its 1984 wipeout, more than doubling its seat count. The New Democratic Party won its largest number of seats up to the time (they would beat the 1988 record in 2011).

The election was the last won by the Progressive Conservatives, the last until 2011 in which a right-of-centre party formed a majority government, and the last where a right-of-centre party won the most seats in Quebec during a federal election. It was also the last election in Canadian history in which only three parties would be elected to Parliament. With Mulroney winning a majority, the agreement was passed into law, even though a majority of the voters had voted for parties opposing free trade.

== Background ==

Brian Mulroney led the Progressive Conservative Party to a landslide majority government victory in the 1984 federal election. Despite this achievement, scandals including patronage damaged his polling numbers. However, in his fourth year in office in 1988, his popularity began to recover; a poll a few days before the election call showed the Progressive Conservatives ahead of the Liberal Party and New Democratic Party.

The Liberal Party led by John Turner suffered a heavy defeat in the 1984 election. Despite this, Turner stayed on as leader and was preparing to campaign for the second election. However, the Liberal Party was in financial and political disarray; by 1986 the party was heavily in debt and the expenses of the national organization continued to rise. Turner&#x27;s office experienced significant staff turnover, and leaving members were willing to recount stories of the office&#x27;s disfunction to the press, resulting in Turner&#x27;s leadership being nicknamed a &quot;reign of error&quot;. Some pundits believed the Liberals would permanently drop to third place.

In 1988, Mulroney reached an agreement on free trade with the United States. Turner&#x27;s Liberal Party and Ed Broadbent&#x27;s New Democratic Party opposed the agreement; Turner believed that the agreement would &quot;Americanize&quot; Canada. Mulroney used his large majority to pass the bill through the House of Commons; however, the Liberal-dominated Senate demanded an election before they would pass it. The election was called on October 1.

== Campaign ==

The Liberals had some early struggles, notably during one day in Montreal where three different costs were given for the proposed Liberal daycare program. When asked by reporters about the incident, Turner&#x27;s chief of staff responded using vulgar language. The campaign was also hampered by a Canadian Broadcasting Corporation (CBC) report that stated there was a movement in the backroom to replace Turner with Jean Chrétien, even though Turner had passed a leadership review in 1986 with 76.3 percent of delegates rejecting a leadership convention.

Turner strongly campaigned against free trade, arguing that it would cost many Canadian jobs. His October 25 debate performance helped polls suggest a Liberal government; a week after the debate, the Liberals were six points ahead of the PCs. The Liberal surge prompted the PCs to stop the relatively calm campaign they had been running and instead run a more negative campaign, capitalizing on the perceived lack of public confidence in Turner, his perceived inability to lead the Liberal Party, and arguing that he only opposed free trade because of political opportunism. The PCs&#x27; poll numbers started to rebound.

==National results==

The Progressive Conservatives won a reduced but strong majority government with 169 seats, and the free trade agreement would go into effect on January 1, 1989. Mulroney was the first Conservative prime minister since John A. Macdonald to win more than one majority. In an ironic reversal of most prior federal elections, the PCs owed their majority to their success in Quebec, where they achieved the best result in party history by winning 63 of 75 seats.

Despite the Liberals more than doubling their seat count from 38 to 83, the results were considered a disappointment for Turner, after polls in mid-campaign predicted a Liberal victory. This second election loss sealed Turner&#x27;s fate; he would eventually resign in 1990, and was succeeded by Jean Chrétien, who proved to be a more effective leader and when in government, accepted free trade with the United States and did not overturn CUSFTA.

Despite the New Democratic Party enjoying their best result at the time (winning 43 seats), Ed Broadbent resigned as leader in 1989. Some NDP members were disappointed by the fact that they didn&#x27;t become the Official Opposition.

==Vote and seat summaries==

A number of unregistered parties also contested the election. The Western Canada Concept party, led by Doug Christie, fielded three candidates in British Columbia. The Western Independence Party ran one candidate in British Columbia, seven in Alberta, and three in Manitoba (although one of the Manitoba candidates appears to have withdrawn before election day).
The Liberal candidate in Etobicoke-Lakeshore, Emmanuel Feuerwerker, withdrew from the race after suffering a heart attack, resulting in the Liberals not running a candidate in all 295 ridings during this election.
The Marxist–Leninist Party fielded candidates in several ridings.
Blair T. Longley campaigned in British Columbia as a representative of the &quot;Student Party&quot;. Newspaper reports indicate that this was simply a tax-avoidance scheme.
The moribund Social Credit Party fielded nine candidates, far short of the 50 required for official recognition. However, the Chief Electoral Officer allowed the party&#x27;s name to appear on the ballot by virtue of its half-century history as a recognized party. It would be the last time that the party, which had been the third-largest or fourth-largest party in Canada at its height, would fight an election under its own name. The party was deregistered before the 1993 election after it failed to nominate enough candidates to keep its registration.

==Election milestones==
Until the 2011 federal election, the 1988 election was the most successful in the New Democratic Party&#x27;s history. The party dominated in British Columbia and Saskatchewan, won significant support in Ontario and elected its first (and, until the 2008 election, only) member from Alberta.

This was the second election contested by the Green Party, and it saw a more than 50 percent increase in its vote, but it remained a minor party.

The election was the last for Canada&#x27;s Social Credit Party. The party won no seats, and won an insignificant portion of the popular vote.

This was the first election for the newly founded Reform Party which for this vote only contested seats in Western Canada. The party at this stage was filled to a large extent with former Socreds along with some former PC supporters disaffected at the perceived lack of support from the Mulroney government for western interests. It was led by Preston Manning, who was himself a one time Socred candidate and the son of longtime Alberta Social Credit premier Ernest Manning.

Reform won no seats and was not yet considered a major party at the national level. However, Deborah Grey would win the first seat for Reform, Beaver River in Alberta, in a by-election held four months later. Grey, who had finished a distant fourth running in the same riding in the general election, succeeded rookie Progressive Conservative MP John Dahmer. Dahmer died of pancreatic cancer before taking office.

For the Progressive Conservatives, this was the last federal election they would ever win.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Fruiterers is a livery company of the city of London originally and presently concerned with the fruit trade, and a charitable institution.

==History==
The Company was founded in 1463 and received a Royal Charter in 1605. As a guild it was concerned with the sale and quality of fruit brought into London, training apprentices, supporting its members and doing charitable works. The connection of the Company to the fruit trade had diminished by the late nineteenth century, but in the later twentieth century its connections were revitalized. It is known for its special recognition of individuals in the fruit industry and for its support of related research and development. Currently, over half the livery is made up of industry representatives.

==The Awards Council==
The Awards Council was founded in 1931 as a sub-committee reporting directly to the Company&#x27;s Court of Assistants. The awards focus on matters relating to fruit culture.

* The triennial awards:
** Ridley Medal for outstanding achievements in fruit culture
** Lewis Award for outstanding achievements in the marketing of fruit
** Matthew Mack Award for outstanding achievements in training within the industry
* The annual awards:
** Fruit Culture Award (awarded annually at the National Fruit Show)
** Fruiterers&#x27; Management Award (awarded annually at the Company&#x27;s Dinner in November)

The Awards Council also makes an annual presentation of fruit to the Lord Mayor of London, organises the annual City Food Lecture in Guildhall (established in 2000), awards prizes at the Cherry and Soft Fruit Show and National Fruit Show, and supports scholarships and research.

==Order of precedence==
The Company ranks forty-fifth in the order of precedence of Livery Companies. Its motto is &quot;Deus Dat Incrementum&quot;, Latin for &quot;God Gives the Increase&quot;.

<text>Mossel Bay () is a harbour town of about 170,000 people on the Garden Route of South Africa. It is an important tourism and farming region of the Western Cape Province. Mossel Bay lies 400 kilometres east of the country&#x27;s seat of parliament, Cape Town (which is also the capital city of the Western Cape), and 400 km west of Gqeberha, the largest city in the Eastern Cape. The older parts of the town occupy the north-facing side of the Cape St Blaize Peninsula, whilst the newer suburbs straddle the Peninsula and have spread eastwards along the sandy shore of the Bay.

The town&#x27;s economy relied heavily on farming, fishing and its commercial harbour (the smallest in the Transnet Port Authority&#x27;s stable of South African commercial harbours), until the 1969 discovery of natural offshore gas fields led to the development of the gas-to-liquids refinery operated by PetroSA. Tourism is another important driver of Mossel Bay&#x27;s economy.

==Etymology==
The origin of the name Mossel Bay (the Bay of Mussels) has to do with the ascendancy of the Dutch shipping merchants in the late 16th and the early 17th centuries. In one account, the explorer Cornelis de Houtman named the place Mosselbaai when he stopped there in 1595, whilst in another, the Dutch Admiral Paulus van Caerden named it when he came ashore on 8 July 1601. Whatever the case, though, the mussels and oysters on the shore would have been a welcome addition to the limited diet on which ship&#x27;s crews were expected to survive in those days.

==History==
Although it is today best known as the place at which the first Europeans landed on South African soil (Bartolomeu Dias and his crew arrived on 3 February 1488), Mossel Bay&#x27;s human history can – as local archaeological deposits have revealed – be traced back more than 164,000 years.

The modern history of Mossel Bay began in February 1488, when the Portuguese explorer Bartolomeu Dias landed with his men at a point close to the site of the modern-day Dias Museum Complex. Here they found a spring from which to replenish their drinking water supplies. Dias had been appointed to search for a trading route to India by King John II of Portugal, and, without realising it, actually rounded the Cape of Good Hope before landing at Mossel Bay – which he named &quot;Angra dos Vaqueiros&quot; (The Bay of Cowherds). Dias is also credited with having given the Cape the name &quot;Cabo das Tormentas&quot; (the &#x27;Cape of Storms&#x27;), although King John II later changed this to &quot;Cabo da Boa Esperança&quot; (the Cape of Good Hope).

Dias&#x27; excursion ashore ended hastily when the local people chased him off in a hail of stones.

By the time the Portuguese explorer Vasco da Gama reached the area in 1497, the Bay had been marked on the maps as &quot;Aguada de São Brás&quot;, the Watering Place of St Blaize - whose feast is celebrated on 3 February.

Da Gama bartered successfully for cattle with the local Khoi people in what is generally regarded as the first commercial transaction between Europeans and the indigenous people of South Africa.

===Post Office Tree===
In 1501, another Portuguese navigator, Pedro d&#x27;Ataide, sought shelter in Mossel Bay after losing much of his fleet in a storm. He left an account of the disaster hidden in an old shoe which he suspended from a milkwood tree (&quot;Sideroxylon inerme&quot;) near the spring from which Dias had drawn his water. The report was found by the explorer to whom it was addressed – João da Nova – and the tree served as a sort of post office for decades thereafter. More recently, a boot-shaped post box has been erected under the now famous Post Office Tree, and letters posted here are franked with a commemorative stamp. This has ensured that the tree has remained one of the town&#x27;s biggest tourist attractions.

João da Nova erected a small shrine near the Post Office Tree, and although no traces of it remain, it is considered the first place of Christian worship in South Africa. 

===European settlement===
Although the Dutch governor of the Cape Colony, Jan de la Fontaine, visited Mossel Bay and erected a possession stone here in 1734, the first permanent European building – a fortress-like granary – was built only in 1787. In July of the following year, the first shipment of wheat grown in the area was shipped from the Bay.

Although a British force had invaded the Cape in 1806, and Britain had taken permanent possession of the Colony in 1814, the Mossel Bay area retained its Dutch-given name until its declaration as a magistracy in 1848, when it was renamed Aliwal South, after the Battle of Aliwal in India, where the then governor of the British-held Cape Colony, Harry Smith, had won victory over the Sikhs on 8 January 1846. The name Aliwal South never stuck, however – even when the town was officially proclaimed in 1848, and when it became a Municipality in 1852.

From the earliest days of the Dutch settlers, Mossel Bay acted as the major port serving the Southern Cape region and its hinterland, the arid Klein Karoo (or Little Karoo), and during the ostrich feather boom of the late 19th and early 20th centuries, more than 800,000 kg of feathers were exported through the port every year – which may have been the impetus that led to the construction of the first breakwater in 1912.

Fishing and farming remained the main activities of the area during the early years of the 20th Century, and the growth of the port reflected this. The discovery of natural gas fields offshore in 1969, of the FA gas field in the Bredasdorp Basin (also off the Southern Cape coast) in 1980, and of the nearby EM field in 1983, led to the development of the Mossgas gas-to-liquids refinery, commissioned in 1987 and renamed the PetroSA Refinery in 2002.

This changed the nature of the port so that its major business now comes from serving supply ships for PetroSA&#x27;s offshore platforms, and from export via its offshore single buoy mooring, which is located in about 21 metres of water in an unsheltered roadstead at Voorbaai, in the lee of the St Blaize Peninsula.
The development of the refinery led to a marked increase in property development in Mossel Bay, with the number of houses growing rapidly to accommodate the workforce during the construction period.

Many of the people who came to work on the project remained in the town after commissioning, and it would appear from the changing economy of the town that they found work in tourism, light industry or commerce.

Whilst the Port and the Refinery have, of course, had a major influence on the development of Mossel Bay, they have always worked in tandem with the growth of tourism and general commerce so that the town now boasts a balanced and vibrant economy. Tourism in particular has influenced much of the growth since 1994, although the town has been a popular resort destination for South Africans since as early as the late 1800s.

The Afrikaans Language and Cultural Society (), also known as the ATKV, bought the farm Hartenbos, east of what was then the town of Mossel Bay, in 1936, and developed it into a holiday resort (now known as the ATKV Hartenbos Resort, and considered the biggest self-catering resort in the Western Cape Province). This was a significant step in the development of the town&#x27;s tourism economy as it positioned Mossel Bay as a beach holiday destination. Beach tourism remains a major focus for incoming tourism in the 21st century.

South Africa installed its first democratically elected government in 1994, which brought about sweeping changes in the structure of local government throughout the country - one of the results of which was that Mossel Bay merged with the smaller, neighbouring villages of Friemersheim, Great Brak River and Herbertsdale to form the present-day Mossel Bay Local Municipality in December 2000.

==Geography==

===Climate===
Mossel Bay has an ocean-moderated semi-arid climate (Köppen climate classification: BSh).

Mossel Bay&#x27;s climate is mild throughout the year as the town is situated in the area where the winter rainfall and all-year rainfall regions of the Western Cape Province meet. Its weather is influenced by the Agulhas Current of the Indian Ocean to the south, and by the presence of the Outeniqua Mountains to the north. Mossel Bay receives 80% of its rainfall at night.

Frost is rare or almost absent and snow has never been recorded on the coastal platform. Snow does, however, occasionally fall on the mountain peaks and can be seen from the town on rare occasions. Prevailing winds are westerly in winter (May - August) and easterly in summer (September - April), and rarely reach storm- or gale-force strength. The average days of sunshine are 320 days per year.


===Topography===
Mossel Bay straddles the Cape St Blaize peninsula (which rises to an average height of 96 metres), and spreads out along the sandy shores of the Indian Ocean, eastwards towards the town of George. The Outeniqua Mountains, which form part of the Cape Fold Belt, lie to the north of the municipal area. These mountains of sandstone and shale are characterised by gentle slopes to the seaward side (which are generally covered by montane fynbos and grasslands), and rise to a height of 1,578 m at Cradock Peak, near George (40 km east of Mossel Bay), and 1,675 metres at Formosa Peak near Plettenberg Bay (150 km east of Mossel Bay).

To the east, the land slopes upwards towards the wave-cut platform (average elevation 245 metres) that characterises the more lush all-year-round rainfall area of the Garden Route. Here the land is mostly covered by grass and farmlands. The deep sandy soils of the western portion of the municipal area also give way to grass and farm-lands, with large stands of typically dry fynbos which are characterised by, amongst others, the &quot;Aloe ferox&quot; (also known as the &quot;bitter aloe&quot;, &quot;Cape aloe&quot; or &quot;red aloe&quot;) from which skin-care products are made locally, and the &quot;Chondropetalum tectorum&quot; (Cape or thatching reed) which is used for the roofing of traditional Cape-Dutch buildings.

The municipal area&#x27;s boundaries are the Gouritz River in the west, the Outeniqua Mountains to the north, the Maalgate River in the east, and the Indian Ocean to the south.

==Demography==
According to the South African National Census of 2022, the population of Mossel Bay (including the adjacent townships) is 140,075 people. Of this population, 40.9% described themselves as &quot;Coloured&quot;, 40.1% as &quot;Black African&quot; and 17.6% as &quot;White&quot;. 57.4% spoke Afrikaans as their first language, 30.7% spoke Xhosa and 6.9% spoke English.

In the 1936 Census the town had a total population of 7,227 people making it the 39th largest settlement in South Africa; 3,782 of whom were recorded as &quot;Coloured,&quot; 3,260 as &quot;European,&quot; 93 as &quot;Asiatic,&quot; and 92 of whom were recorded as &quot;Native&quot; or &quot;Bantu&quot;. 

==Attractions==
Mossel Bay has been a beach holiday destination for South Africans for more than a century – a situation that received a particular boost after the Afrikaanse Taal en Kultuur Vereniging (ATKV) bought the farm Hartenbos in the 1930s, and began developing it as a holiday resort for its members.

The major attractions were then, and (to a large extent) still are, the dry, warm and stable weather, and the Indian Ocean and its beaches. However, with good roads, modern vehicles and the development of inland accommodation, the broader environment of the area (including the Outeniqua Mountains to the north, and large stands of fynbos, or Cape macchia, to the west) is now vital to the tourism economy. 

The town is a major attraction for adventure tourism, and offers deep sea fishing, SCUBA diving, white shark cage diving, whale watching, sky diving, and the longest over the ocean zipline.

In addition, the history of the town (Mossel Bay was the site of the first contact between European explorers and indigenous people), and its cultural attractions are important features.

Mossel Bay is situated exactly halfway between Cape Town (and the Cape Winelands) and Port Elizabeth (with its game reserves), and is therefore a popular stopping-off and resting point on the itineraries of international visitors to the Western and Eastern Cape Provinces.

The Bartolomeu Dias Museum Complex is the largest of the museums in Mossel Bay. Originally designed to celebrate the arrival of Bartolomeu Dias and his crew on 3 February 1488, and to protect the &quot;Post Office Tree&quot;, the Complex now offers a wider look at the history of Mossel Bay from environmental, archaeological, and cultural perspectives.

Cape St. Blaize Lighthouse () was built in 1864 to designs by the Colonial engineer, R. Robinson. The original light (on a masonry tower 20.5 metres in height) was stationary, but in 1897 a revolving, clock-work light, which required winding every three hours, was fitted. This was used until the late 1970s. The light is now fully automated.

==Economy==

===Tourism===
Mossel Bay has a strong tourism economy. The summer holiday season (from about mid-December to mid-January) is the busiest time of the year, and, in December 2010, the Municipality estimated that the town provided accommodation for between 50,000 and 60,000 holidaymakers per night during this period.
===Natural gas and oil===
The PetroSA (Petroleum, Oil and Gas Corporation of South Africa Pty Limited) Refinery – which was commissioned as Mossgas in 1987 – is situated about 13 km to the west of the town&#x27;s central business district.
This is one of the world&#x27;s largest Gas to liquids (GTL) refineries, and has always been a leader in the challenge of commercialising the GTL processes. It produces per day (bbl/d) – a crude oil equivalent of – using the Fischer–Tropsch process of converting natural gas (which is piped from offshore fields via PetroSA&#x27;s FA Platform).

Mossel Bay&#x27;s GTL plant serves up to 15 percent of South Africa&#x27;s transport fuels requirements. It produces unleaded gasoline, ultra low sulphur diesel, kerosene, low aromatic distillates, drilling fluids, liquid petroleum gas, low sulphur fuel oil, anhydrous alcohols, liquid oxygen, liquid nitrogen, carbon dioxide, and waxes.

==Transport==

===Road transport===
Mossel Bay straddles the N2 national highway, which is South Africa&#x27;s main coastal road from Cape Town in the Western Cape Province, to Durban in KwaZulu-Natal Province. (Using this route, Mossel Bay lies exactly at the midpoint between Cape Town and the Eastern Cape Province&#x27;s capital of Port Elizabeth – 400 km each way).

The Municipality of Mossel Bay maintains 417,9 km of paved and concreted roads, and 24 km of gravel roads. Mossel Bay is a stopping point for all major road transport operators licensed for this region.

===Harbour===

The Port of Mossel Bay () is the smallest commercial harbour on the South African coast. It caters mostly for the oil industry (off-shore gas was discovered in late 1980s), and for a small fishing fleet, and is owned and managed by the Transnet National Ports Authority, which falls directly under South Africa&#x27;s Department of Public Enterprises.

The depth of the entrance channel is 8 metres, while the maximum permissible draught inside the harbour is 6.5 metres. Pilotage is compulsory from a point northeast of Cape St Blaize.

Bunkering is available on the jetty and at quays 2, 3, and 5. Quay 4 can accommodate vessels of up to 130m, with a draught of 6.5m. A ship repair slipway can accommodate vessels of up to 200 tonnes. Ship chandler and stevedore services are available, as are diving services for hull cleaning, underwater inspection, salvage, etc.

The harbour has two offshore mooring buoys inside port limits: a catenary buoy mooring that caters for ships of up to 32,000DWT (maximum length 204m, draught 12m); and a single point mooring (SPM) marine tanker terminal that&#x27;s connected to three hoses for the export of products from PetroSA&#x27;s gas-to-fuel 
refinery, which is situated inland (about 13 km) and directly west of Mossel Bay. The SPM is located off Voorbaai in an open, unsheltered roadstead in about 21 metres of water.

During the 2008/09 financial year Mossel Bay served 1,567 vessels (mostly South African trawlers) with a combined gross tonnage of 3,317,364-gt, and 
handled a total of 2,014,185 tonnes of cargo (1,940,310t of bulk cargo – mostly oil products – and 73,875t of break-bulk). 773,267 tonnes of cargo was landed, and 1,240,918t was shipped.

15000 people worked on the synthol &amp; refinery plant in Mossel Bay from 1998 to 2002 from all over the world - changing the landscape of the perception of 
South Africa Garden Route &amp; giving major credence to South Africa &amp; multi-relations to the world.

===Rail===
Mossel Bay is connected to the national rail network via a branch line to George. The line celebrated its centenary on 25 September 2007.

==Archaeology==

===Pinnacle Point Caves===
According to the presently accepted theory of the Recent African Origin of Modern Humans, all people alive today evolved from a core population of about 600 individuals who lived on the African Continent between 100,000 and 200,000 years ago. The Mossel Bay Archaeology Project (MAP) has shown that the Southern Cape Coast was most probably the point where modern behaviour first emerged about 164,000 years ago.

The Mossel Bay Archaeology Project was created to examine the ancient middens in the Pinnacle Point Caves, most of which lie about 12 km east of Cape St Blaize.

The discovery was made during routine archaeological surveys conducted prior to the development of the Pinnacle Point Beach and Golf Resort, and excavations began in the year 2000 under the leadership of Professor Curtis Marean (a palaeoanthropologist with the &quot;Institute of Human Origins&quot; at the Arizona State University), and by Dr. Peter Nilssen, of the Iziko South African Museum. The scientific team includes researchers from South Africa (the University of Cape Town), Australia (the University of New South Wales and the University of Wollongong), as well as Israel and France. Funding for the project was obtained from the National Science Foundation (USA); the Hyse Family Trust; the Iziko South African Museum; the University of Cape Town; and the Dias Museum in Mossel Bay.

The Project focuses on a series of caves cut into the sea-facing cliffs on the southern boundary of the Pinnacle Point Beach and Golf Resort, which were occupied between 170,000 and 40,000 years ago by Middle Stone Age people.

The excavations have revealed the earliest evidence for the systematic exploitation of marine resources such as shellfish (which would have provided the Omega-3 fatty acids required for the development of the modern human brain); the earliest evidence for the use of dyes in symbolling (particularly the use of ochre, possibly for body painting or decorative arts); the use of advanced bladelet technology (embedding smaller blades into larger strata to create complex tools); and the earliest evidence for the use of heat treatment in the manufacture of stone tools.

The significance of the finds is increased by the presence of fossilised carbon isotopes in the dripstone formations (stalactites) hanging from the roofs of the caves, which contain a record of the composition of the water that seeped into the caves over a period beginning about 400,000 years ago. As part of their work, the scientists on the Bay Archaeology Project are studying this evidence in order to create a portrait of the climate of the area over the period 400,000 to 30,000 years ago so as to be able to correlate the evidence of human behaviour on the floor of the caves with climate patterns, and thus learn how man has adapted to climate change over the ages.

===Cape St Blaize Cave===

The Cape St Blaize Cave is situated directly under the Cape St. Blaize Lighthouse, is the site of one of South Africa&#x27;s oldest archaeological excavations. It was first excavated in 1888 by George Leith, then by T. Rupert Jones in 1899, and by A.J.H (John) Goodwin in the 1920s. Goodwin is said to have described the Middle Stone Age Mossel Bay Industry from his findings at Cape St Blaize .

The Cave has revealed deposits dating from about 200,000 years ago to the pre-colonial period, during which time middens were laid down by herders of the San or Khoekhoen people.

It is protected by Heritage Western Cape as a Provincial Heritage Site.

===Rock Art===
The mountains to the north of Mossel Bay are an important repository of South African rock art. This art, which is now associated with shamanistic practices (in which the rock itself is thought to have been considered the veil between this world and the spirit world), was created by the San people, and specimens may date back as far as 27,000 years.

The rock art sites surrounding Mossel Bay are generally located on private land, and are therefore only accessible to the public in the company of registered guides, who will ensure that the integrity of the pieces remains intact.
==Coats of arms==
Municipality (1) – The original arms, designed by W.H. Armstrong &amp; Co (of Cape Town), were assumed on 6 October 1905. The shield was quartered as follows: 1 the figure of Justice on a red background; 2 a golden fleece on a blue background; 3 three interlaced golden fish on a blue background; 4 the figure of Neptune on a sky blue background.

Municipality (2) – In 1992, after the Bureau of Heraldry had refused to register the existing arms, because they were heraldically defective, the council accepted a new design, prepared by the Bureau. The new arms were registered at the Bureau on 6 March 1992: &quot;Per saltire Argent and Azure, in chief a balance resting on the point of a sword erect, Azure; dexter three fish interlaced in annulet Or, sinister a golden fleece and in base, on a base wavy Azure charged with a bar wavy Argent, a Portuguese caravel, sails set, proper.&quot; In layman&#x27;s terms : the shield was divided in four by two diagonal lines, the upper section displaying a blue balance and a sword on a silver background, the left section three interlaced golden fish on a blue background, the right section a golden fleece on a blue background, and at the bottom a Portuguese caravel on a stylised blue and white sea.

The crest was a lighthouse, and the motto &quot;Jure et justitia valemus&quot;.

Municipality (3) – A new coat of arms was registered at the Bureau on 20 February 1998: &quot;Per saltire, in base grady, Azure and Or, in chief two whales naiant in pale and in base a fess nowy of two Karoo gable houses, Argent, the doors Azure, the lower edge wavy; dexter an aloe Vert flowered Gules and sinister a 15th century Portuguese caravelle proper, the sail charged with a cross paty, Gules.&quot; In layman&#x27;s terms : the shield is divided in four by two diagonal lines, the lower parts of which are stepped, the upper section displaying two silver whales on a blue background, the left section an aloe plant on a golden background, the right section a Portuguese caravel on a golden background, and the bottom section two stylised Karoo gable houses in silver against a blue background.

The crest is a lighthouse issuing from a black mural crown. The motto is, again, &quot;Jure et justitia valemus&quot;.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Plaisterers is one of the livery companies in the City of London. The Plaisterers&#x27; Company was incorporated under a Royal Charter in 1501 and whilst the spelling used in the charter was &quot;Plaisterer&quot;, some later charters used the alternative spelling of &quot;plasterer&quot;, nonetheless, the company uses the original spelling.

The company originated as a trade association of London&#x27;s plasterers. Today, it maintains a connection with the trade by establishing plastering standards and by officially accrediting plasterers. The company is also a charitable and educational institution and generates income by renting out the hall on a private hire basis for events.

The Plaisterers&#x27; Company ranks forty-sixth in the Order of Precedence of the City livery companies. Its motto is &quot;Let Brotherly Love Continue&quot;.

The company&#x27;s first hall was bequeathed by William Elder, Citizen and Plaisterer in 1556. It was situated on the corner of Addle Street and Philip Lane but was destroyed in the Great Fire of London in 1666. Its second hall was built in 1669 to the design of Christopher Wren, although this too was destroyed by fire in 1882. The third hall on the site was destroyed during the Blitz in 1940.

Its current hall, opened in November 1972, has décor throughout of the neo-classical style created by Robert Adam in the 18th century. His various designs have been faithfully reproduced in great detail both on plaster and wood, some being taken from his original moulds. Plaisterers&#x27; Hall is the largest and one of the finest City livery halls in London.

Plaisterer&#x27;s Hall Academy (1744–54) was a dissenting academy that provided for the training of Congregational ministers.

<text>Sutton Park NNR is a large urban park located in Sutton Coldfield, Birmingham, West Midlands, England. The park is a National Nature Reserve; large parts are also a Scheduled Ancient Monument. Sutton Park is one of the largest urban parks in the United Kingdom. The park covers more than according to one source. It consists of a mix of heathland, wetlands and marshes, seven lakes, extensive ancient woodlands (covering approximately a quarter of the park), several restaurants, a private 18-hole golf course on its western edge and a municipal golf course to the south, a donkey sanctuary, children&#x27;s playgrounds and a Visitor Centre. There is no entrance charge to the Park. A wide range of leisure activities are undertaken in the park including dog walking, pony trekking, bike riding and kite flying and there are areas to fly model aeroplanes and helicopters. Additionally, a railway line runs through the park.

==History==

Peat-cutting, near Rowton&#x27;s Well during World War II, recovered flint arrowheads at the base of the peat. There are some unassuming prehistoric burnt mounds, and an ancient well. The park contains a preserved section of the Icknield Street, a Roman road; the noticeably cambered road enters the Park near the Royal Oak Gate and exits towards the aptly named Streetly, the &quot;meadow by the paved street&quot;; it is still possible to walk the road. In 1909, two Roman coins were discovered in the park. The Queen&#x27;s Coppice, planted in 1953, now covers the site of an ancient tumulus, from which a stone &#x27;coffin&#x27; was dug out by antiquarians in 1808. Near Blackroot Pool are the earthworks of an ancient encampment, the origin of this is not known – possibly it was a hunting lodge and it may have been Roman, Mercian or Norman (or even all three, over time).

===Royal Forest===
The park was established as a Royal Forest by the Anglo Saxon kings of Mercia, from their seat at Tamworth at around the 9th century. By the early 12th century, it was in use as a Norman medieval deer park. The land was given to the people of Sutton Coldfield by King Henry VIII in 1528 after Bishop John Vesey, a friend of the King, asked for it as a present to the people of Sutton Coldfield. The charcoal burning that took place in the Park is thought to have given Sutton Coldfield the second part of its name.

===Wyndley Pool===

Wyndley Pool is the oldest in the Park, perhaps dating from the 12th century or even earlier. The house of the Royal Steward sat on the bluff overlooking Wyndley Pool. Keeper&#x27;s Pool and Bracebridge Pool date from the 15th century. Powell&#x27;s Pool, Longmoor Pool, and Blackroot date from the 18th century, and were created to run watermills. There was another pool at Boldmere, now outside the park, but this has since vanished. Most of the Park has been undisturbed since then. The area of Ladywood, at Four Oaks, was taken for housing, but in exchange the Meadow Platt area near the town was added to the Park, thus allowing the construction of a new Park Road access from the town.

===Railway station===
A railway line, the Sutton Park Line, was built through the Park in 1879 and the Park had its own station. The advent of the railway, and the new town entrance, greatly increased the number of visitors to the Park. The Park&#x27;s own dedicated station was closed in 1964, and the line now only serves goods trains.

Construction of the line resulted in the filling in of an area of wetland known as &quot;Webb&#x27;s Stows&quot;, causing the loss of several species of rare plants from the park.

===Sutton Miniature Railway===
The Sutton Miniature Railway ran near to the present-day Wyndley Leisure Centre, from circa 1905 until the 1960s, when it was dismantled and the equipment put into store. The stock and engine shed are now at the Vintage Trains Depot at Tyseley, Birmingham.

===Wartime camps===
During World War I, convalescent camps were built in the Park. During World War II further camps were built; these were first used for enemy aliens, then for U.S. forces prior to D-Day, and finally for Nazi German and Italian prisoners of war.

===Scouting===
In 1957, the 50th anniversary of Scouting was celebrated when the 9th World Scout Jamboree, held concurrently with the 6th World Rover Moot and the 2nd World Scout Indaba, was held in the park, with participants from all over the world. The event is commemorated by a short stone pillar in the centre of the park.

===Radio 1 Roadshow===
On Sunday 30 August 1992, 100,000 fans attended the BBC Radio 1 biggest ever Roadshow to celebrate the 25th anniversary of Radio 1 with live performances from bands including Del Amitri, Aswad, The Farm and Status Quo. Free buses were provided by Travel West Midlands and a large Radio 1 Air ship floated above the park.

===Lido===
There was a rare 1887 lido, for open-air all-weather swimming, at Keepers Pool but the lido closed in 2003 after arson, and was burned down entirely in 2004. The Lido area has now been purposely reverted to woodland and wetland.

==Sports==
The park is popular for a number of sports. These include mountain biking, with the &quot;Skeleton Hill&quot; being popular with downhill bikers. Secondly sailing and canoeing, which take place mainly on Powell&#x27;s Pool and finally kayaking and canoeing club on Blackroot Pool with Royal Sutton Coldfield Canoe Club.

Runners and walkers also make the most of the park and its extensive pathways and trails.

A number of running events are staged in the park. These include:
* Seven Pools Run (March) 
* Midland Counties men&#x27;s 12-stage and women&#x27;s 6-stage relays (March)
* ERRA National men&#x27;s 12-stage and women&#x27;s 6-stage relays (April)
* National Masters (BMAF) Open Road Relays (May)
* Royal Mail 5k / 10k Fun Run (May)
* Hill West 10k (May)
* Great Midlands Fun Run (June)
* Race for Life (June)
* City of Birmingham 10k / 5k Fun Run (September)
* Midland Counties men&#x27;s 6-stage and women&#x27;s 4-stage relays (September)
* Birmingham Insurance Institute 5k / 10k Fun Run (September)
* Teach First&#x27;s Run 10k + kids&#x27; 2k (September)
* ERRA National men&#x27;s 6-stage and women&#x27;s 4-stage relays (October)

There is a free 5 km parkrun event in the park at 9:00am every Saturday, starting at Banners Gate.

The City of Birmingham triathlon event in held in July with the open water swim stage taking place in Powell&#x27;s Pool.

The Park hosted the triathlon events for the Birmingham 2022 Commonwealth Games. The swimming occurred in Powell&#x27;s Pool, while the cycling took to the streets of Boldmere before transitioning to running in the park itself.

Be Military Fit hold fitness classes up to six days a week in the park close to the Boldmere Gate.

There are countless cycling routes throughout the park for all different capabilities. There is an 18-hole golf course near to the Streetly Gate entrance to the park.

There is a section of grass sectioned off for the usage of model aeroplanes and helicopters. This is between Boldmere Gate and the Jamboree Stone and can be accessed at most times by car from Boldmere Gate.

Sutton Park has also been used for motor rallying, and was a popular spectator stage on the Lombard RAC Rally in the 1970s and 1980s.

Also there are many watersports in the park, including fishing, rowing and sailing on the park&#x27;s Powell&#x27;s Pool, where the Sutton Sailing Club(SSC) sails regularly throughout the year. Bishop Vesey Grammar School row on Powell&#x27;s Pool.

==Wildlife==

Nightjars formerly bred in the park; the last recorded being in 1957, the year of the Scout Jamboree. Since then, there have only been two sightings, in 1974 and 2005. Both red grouse and black grouse were in the park until 1868 and 1897 respectively.

== Hydrology ==

Two streams rise in the park, Plants Brook (also known as the Ebrook or East Brook) and its tributary Longmoor Brook, as well as several of their smaller tributaries and man-made drainage channels. These feed a number of man-made pools and reservoirs. Their outflow, outside the park is into the River Tame, and ultimately via the River Trent and the Humber, into the North Sea. Following heavy rainfall, water is fed into the streams from outside the park via storm drains known as &quot;Combined Sewer Overflows&quot;.

==Current status==

In 1997, English Nature designated most of Sutton Park a national nature reserve and it features on English Heritage&#x27;s list of recognised historic parks and gardens. In July 2005, a 20-year &#x27;Keepers of Time&#x27; scheme was announced, which will eliminate alien species from ancient woodlands and restore native varieties like oak, ash and beech.
The park is currently managed by Birmingham City Council; but in July 2004 it was announced that control would be devolved to the local councillors for Sutton Coldfield.
The roads have reverted to their previous &#x27;heavily restricted&#x27; status. There is still considerable car traffic into and out of the park, mainly of families with children, dog walkers, kite/model aeroplane fliers and other recreational use. However, cross-park &#x27;through traffic&#x27; is now completely blocked by sturdy gates across the main link roads, similar to the existing gates at all road entrances and exits, that open and close with dusk and dawn. This measure has significantly reduced the use of the park as a rush-hour short-cut (notably between Boldmere and Streetly), with some noticeable impact on congestion of local routes around the Park. The benefit of traffic restriction is improvement in the enjoyability of the park; with cleaner air, safer roads for walkers and cyclists, and much reduced visual and noise pollution, plus reduced wear and tear on the poorly maintained, decaying road surfaces.

Road speed limits through the park have been reduced twice, from 30 mph to 20 mph in the 1980s, and to 5 mph in 2004. Also, on the pedestrianised areas (areas that used to be roads for cars, but are now closed to vehicles, except for emergency/ranger traffic), many speed bumps have been removed.

The commercial funfair for small children beside Powell&#x27;s Pool continues to operate, attracting significant business. It offers rides such as a daisy-chained go-kart track ride (with &#x27;spooky&#x27; tunnels), and a two-person manually operated bell-rope pirate ship swings.

There is a Sea Cadets dry-dock training vessel (&quot;the Concrete Corvette&quot;) at Boldmere Gate along with the headquarters of the 1st Sutton Coldfield Sea Scouts, and at the other side of the park the 9th Sutton Coldfield Scouts.

There are now a larger number of police officers in the park, especially at the main gate, Town Gate. This has helped to stop vandalism and arson attacks on the park, however, some incidents still happen.

In December 2007, the National Cycle Network won £50-million in a public vote. The effect on Sutton Park will be to build the Plants Brook route that will create a free off-road bicycle path from east Erdington to Sutton Park.

In February 2008, a City Council feasibility study examined the possibility of once again running passenger trains through the park.

In September 2012, an outbreak of &quot;E. coli&quot; O157 was confirmed by the Health Protection Agency. Seven people were infected during the months of July and August. The park remained open but Birmingham City Council advised children under 10 to avoid visiting Sutton Park and for visitors to avoid contact with animals and wash hands thoroughly. Due to the outbreak, the autumn Midlands Counties and English National Road Relays running events in 2012 were cancelled.

During the COVID-19 pandemic, outdoor exercise was encouraged as people struggled with the physical effects of lockdown and restrictions. Sutton Park remained busy even as the Wyndley Leisure Centre facilities were shut.

<text>The Bluetick Coonhound is a breed of coonhound originating in the United States. The Bluetick Coonhound is known for its friendly personality, cold nose, and deep bawl mouth. It is most commonly used as a raccoon hunting dog, but is also kept as a pet.

== Description ==

=== Appearance ===
The overall build of the Bluetick Coonhound is muscular and speedy. The head is carried up and the tail carried over the back, without signs of fear or nervousness. The Bluetick coat should be moderately coarse and glossy. The Bluetick Coonhound gets its &quot;blue&quot; coloring from black ticking on a white background, which gives the impression of a navy blue color. This ticking covers the body and can be interspersed with variously-shaped black spots on the back, ears and sides. Preference runs to more blue than black on the body. Black should predominate on the head and ears. Bluetick Coonhounds can come either with or without markings. With markings means they will have brown markings above the eyes, along both sides of the muzzle, on the chest, and down all of the legs. Without markings means their color consists of only black and white fur. There is generally a ticked blaze running up the face. Bluetick Coonhounds should be 21 inches to 27 inches tall at the shoulder and males weigh approximately 55 to 80 pounds (25 to 36 kg). Females are considerably smaller at an average weight of 45 to 65 pounds. Feet should be cat-like, rounded with well-arched toes. Their paws are larger than those of nearly all other breeds of dogs. Rear legs should have a moderate bend at the hocks. All legs should be straight from the dog&#x27;s body to the ground when viewed from the front or rear.

Gascon blues are larger than standard Blueticks, with males a minimum of 27 inches and a maximum of 30 inches, per the American Blue Gascon Hound Association&#x27;s breed standard.

=== Temperament ===
Bluetick Coonhounds are bred to be hunting dogs. They are athletic, hardy, and need a full-time job or activity such as hunting, obedience, or agility to stay happy. They can be challenging to train and they should be monitored around cats or other small animals. They are, like their hound counterparts, a very intelligent breed that has the uncanny talent for problem-solving.

Once trained, the members of the breed are very mindful of their owner. Something first time pet owners should be aware of is the daunting task of &quot;voice-training&quot; these dogs. Being bred to bay while hunting, they are highly vocal. If properly socialized from a young age, they can be family pets.
In normal conditions, the Bluetick Coonhound gets along well with children. They are mindful and friendly dogs. However, their noses will keep them in trouble, so food and garbage should never be left out unattended. The breed is often mistaken for being aggressive as the breed will &quot;greet&quot; strangers with its signature howl and will sniff the subject until satisfied. Usually, this is just the way the breed gets to know its subjects. Since Blueticks are driven by their strong sense of smell, they make excellent hunting/tracking dogs. If allowed, they will tree almost any animal smaller than they. Blueticks are generally easier to handle in the field than some other coonhounds.

== History ==
The Bluetick Coonhound, which originated in Louisiana, was developed from the Grand Bleu de Gascogne hound of southwestern France, as well as the English Foxhound, the cur dog, the American Foxhound, and the Black and Tan Virginia Foxhound. Originally, Bluetick Coonhounds were registered in the United Kennel Club under the English Foxhound and Coonhound, but were recognized by the club as a separate breed in 1946. Bluetick Coonhounds are also recognized by the Australian National Kennel Council and the New Zealand Kennel Club. In April 2009, the breed was accepted by the American Kennel Club and in December 2009 they became eligible to compete in AKC coonhound events.

The American Blue Gascon Hound is the name for a subgroup of Bluetick Coonhounds that is larger, heavier and more &quot;houndy&quot; looking than the standard Bluetick. American Blue Gascon Hounds are often referred to as &quot;old-fashioned&quot; Blueticks. This is due to their appearance and &quot;colder&quot; nose, or slower style of tracking, compared to other modern coonhound breeds.

<text>Electronic toll collection (ETC) is a wireless system to automatically collect the usage fee or toll charged to vehicles using toll roads, HOV lanes, toll bridges, and toll tunnels. It is a faster alternative which is replacing toll booths, where vehicles must stop and the driver manually pays the toll with cash or a card. In most cases, vehicles using the system are equipped with an automated radio transponder device. When the vehicle passes a roadside toll reader device, a radio signal from the reader triggers the transponder, which transmits back an identifying number which registers the vehicle&#x27;s use of the road, and an electronic payment system charges the user the toll. 

A major advantage is the driver does not have to stop, reducing traffic delays. Electronic tolling is cheaper than a staffed toll booth, reducing transaction costs for government or private road owners. The ease of varying the amount of the toll makes it easy to implement road congestion pricing, including for high-occupancy lanes, toll lanes that bypass congestion, and city-wide congestion charges. The payment system usually requires users to sign up in advance and load money into a declining-balance account, which is debited each time they pass a toll point.

Electronic toll lanes may operate alongside conventional toll booths so that drivers who do not have transponders can pay at the booth. Open road tolling is an increasingly popular alternative which eliminates toll booths altogether; electronic readers mounted beside or over the road read the transponders as vehicles pass at highway speeds, eliminating traffic bottlenecks created by vehicles slowing down to go through a toll booth lane. Vehicles without transponders are either excluded or pay by plate – a license plate reader takes a picture of the license plate to identify the vehicle, and a bill may be mailed to the address where the car&#x27;s license plate number is registered, or drivers may have a certain amount of time to pay online or by phone.

Singapore was the first city in the world to implement an electronic road toll collection system known as the Singapore Area Licensing Scheme for purposes of congestion pricing, in 1974. Since 2005, nationwide GNSS road pricing systems have been deployed in several European countries. With satellite-based tolling solutions, it is not necessary to install electronic readers beside or above the road in order to read transponders since all vehicles are equipped with On Board Units having Global Navigation Satellite System (GNSS) receivers in order to determine the distance traveled on the tolled road network - without the use of any roadside infrastructure.

US Nobel Economics Prize winner William Vickrey was the first to propose a system of electronic tolling for the Washington Metropolitan Area in 1959. In the 1960s and the 1970s, the first prototype systems were tested. Norway has been a world pioneer in the widespread implementation of this technology, beginning in 1986. Italy was the first country to deploy a full electronic toll collection system in motorways at national scale in 1989.

==History==
In 1959, Nobel Economics Prize winner William Vickrey was the first to propose a similar system of electronic tolling for the Washington Metropolitan Area. He proposed that each car would be equipped with a transponder: &quot;The transponder&#x27;s personalized signal would be picked up when the car passed through an intersection, and then relayed to a central computer which would calculate the charge according to the intersection and the time of day and add it to the car&#x27;s bill.&quot; In the 1960s and the 1970s, free flow tolling was tested with fixed transponders at the undersides of the vehicles and readers, which were located under the surface of the highway. Plans were however scrapped and it never came into actual implementation. Modern toll transponders are typically mounted under the windshield, with readers located in overhead gantries. 

After tests in 1974, in 1975, Singapore became the first country in the world to implement an electronic road toll collection system known as the Singapore Area Licensing Scheme for purposes of congestion pricing on its more urbanized roads. It was refined in 1998 as Electronic Road Pricing (ERP).

Italy deployed a full ETC in motorways at national scale in 1989. Telepass, the brand name of the ETC belonging to Autostrade S.p.A. now Autostrade per l&#x27;Italia, was designed by Dr. Eng Pierluigi Ceseri and Dr. Eng. Mario Alvisi and included a full operational real time Classification of Vehicles and Enforcement via cameras interconnected with the PRA (Public Register of Automobiles) via a network of more than 3.000 Km. optical fibers. Telepass introduced the concept of ETC Interoperability because interconnected 24 different Italian motorway operators allowing users to travel between different concession areas and paying only at the end of the journey. Dr. Eng. Mario Alvisi is considered the father of ETC in motorways because not only co-designed Telepass but was able to make it the first standardized operating ETC system in the world as European standard in 1996. He acted as a consultant for deployment of ETC in many countries including Japan, United States, Brazil. In Japan, only the ETC System was constructed in all of the controlled-access expressways in 2001. By 2019, 92% of drivers are using ETC.

ETC was first introduced in Bergen, Norway, in 1986, operating together with traditional tollbooths. In 1991, Trondheim introduced the world&#x27;s first use of completely unaided full-speed electronic tolling. Norway now has 25 toll roads operating with electronic fee collection (EFC), as the Norwegian technology is called (see AutoPASS). In 1995, Portugal became the first country to apply a single, universal system to all tolls in the country, the Via Verde, which can also be used in parking lots and gas stations. The United States is another country with widespread use of ETC in several states, though many U.S. toll roads maintain the option of manual collection.

As of March 2018, in Japan, a total of approximately 2.61 million vehicles are equipped with devices compliant with the ETC 2.0.

==Overview==


In some urban settings, automated gates are in use in electronic-toll lanes, with 5 mph (8 km/h) legal limits on speed; in other settings, 20 mph (35 km/h) legal limits are not uncommon. However, in other areas such as the Garden State Parkway in New Jersey, and at various locations in California, Florida, Pennsylvania, Delaware, and Texas, cars can travel through electronic lanes at full speed. Illinois&#x27; Open Road Tolling program features 274 contiguous miles of barrier-free roadways, where I-PASS or E-ZPass users continue to travel at highway speeds through toll plazas, while cash payers pull off the main roadway to pay at tollbooths. Currently over 80% of Illinois&#x27; 1.4 million daily drivers use an I-PASS.

Enforcement is accomplished by a combination of a camera which takes a picture of the car and a radio frequency keyed computer which searches for a drivers window/bumper mounted transponder to verify and collect payment. The system sends a notice and fine to cars that pass through without having an active account or paying a toll.

Factors hindering full-speed electronic collection include:

* significant non-participation, entailing lines in manual lanes and disorderly traffic patterns as the electronic- and manual- collection cars &quot;sort themselves out&quot; into their respective lanes; 
* problems with pursuing toll evaders; 
* need, in at least some current (barrier) systems, to confine vehicles in lanes, while interacting with the collection devices, and the dangers of high-speed collisions with the confinement structures; 
* vehicle hazards to toll employees present in some electronic-collection areas; 
* the fact that in some areas at some times, long lines form even to pass through the electronic-collection lanes; 
* costs and other issues raised when retrofitting existing toll collection facilities 
* unionized toll collectors can also be problematic.

Even if line lengths are the same in electronic lanes as in manual ones, electronic tolls save registered cars time: eliminating the stop at a window or toll machine, between successive cars passing the collection machine, means a fixed-length stretch of their journey past it is traveled at a higher average speed, and in a lower time. This is at least a psychological improvement, even if the length of the lines in automated lanes is sufficient to make the no-stop-to-pay savings insignificant compared to time still lost due waiting in line to pass the toll gate. Toll plazas are typically wider than the rest of the highway; reducing the need for them makes it possible to fit toll roads into tight corridors.

Despite these limitations, if delay at the toll gate is reduced, the tollbooth can serve more vehicles per hour. The greater the throughput of any toll lane, the fewer lanes required, so construction costs can be reduced. Specifically, the toll-collecting authorities have incentives to resist pressure to limit the fraction of electronic lanes in order to limit the length of manual-lane lines. In the short term, the greater the fraction of automated lanes, the lower the cost of operation (once the capital costs of automating are amortized). In the long term, the greater the relative advantage that registering and turning one&#x27;s vehicle into an electronic-toll one provides, the faster cars will be converted from manual-toll use to electronic-toll use, and therefore the fewer manual-toll cars will drag down average speed and thus capacity.

In some countries, some toll agencies that use similar technology have set up (or are setting up) reciprocity arrangements, which permit one to drive a vehicle on another operator&#x27;s tolled road with the tolls incurred charged to the driver&#x27;s toll-payment account with their home operator. An example is the United States E-ZPass tag, which is accepted on toll roads, bridges and tunnels in fifteen states from Illinois to Maine.
In Australia, there are a number or organizations that provide tags known as e-TAG that can be used on toll roads. They include Transport for NSW&#x27;s E-Toll and Transurban&#x27;s Linkt. A toll is debited to the customer&#x27;s account with their tag provider. Some toll road operators – including Sydney&#x27;s Sydney Harbour Tunnel, Lane Cove Tunnel and Westlink M7, Melbourne&#x27;s CityLink and Eastlink, and Brisbane&#x27;s Gateway Motorway – encourage use of such tags, and apply an additional vehicle matching fee to vehicles without a tag.

A similar device in France, called Liber-T for light vehicles and TIS-PL for HGVs, is accepted on all toll roads in the country.

In Brazil, the Sem Parar/Via-Fácil system allows customers to pass through tolls in more than 1,000 lanes in the states of São Paulo, Paraná, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Bahia and Rio de Janeiro. Sem Parar/Via-Fácil also allows users to enter and exit more than 100 parking lots. There are also other systems, such as via expressa, onda livre and auto expresso, that are present in the states of Rio de Janeiro, Rio Grande do Sul, Santa Catarina, Parana and Minas Gerais.

Since 2016, National Highway Authority of Pakistan implemented electronic toll collection on its motorway network using a RFID-based tag called the &quot;M-TAG&quot;. The tag is attached to the windscreen of vehicles and is automatically scanned at toll plazas on entry and exit, meanwhile debiting the calculated toll tax from a prepaid M-TAG account.

The European Union issued the EFC-directive, which attempts to standardize European toll collection systems. Systems deployed after January 1, 2007 must support at least one of the following technologies: satellite positioning, mobile communications using the GSM-GPRS standard or 5.8 GHz microwave technology. Furthermore, the European Commission issued the Regulation on the European Electronic Toll Service (EETS) which must be implemented by all Member States from 19 October 2021. All toll roads in Ireland must support the eToll tag standard. 

From 2015, the Norwegian government requires commercial trucks above 3.5 tons on its roads to have a transponder and a valid road toll subscription. Before this regulation, two-thirds of foreign trucks failed to pay road tolls.

==Use in urban areas and for congestion pricing==

The most revolutionary application of ETC is in the urban context of congested cities, allowing to charge tolls without vehicles having to slow down. This application made feasible to concession to the private sector the construction and operation of urban freeways, as well as the introduction or improvement of congestion pricing, as a policy to restrict auto travel in downtown areas.

Between 2004 and 2005, Santiago, Chile, implemented the world&#x27;s first 100% full speed electronic tolling with transponders crossing through the city&#x27;s core (CBD) in a system of several concessioned urban freeways (Autopista Central and Autopista ). The United Arab Emirates implemented in 2007 a similar road toll collection in Dubai, called Salik. Similar schemes were previously implemented but only on bypass or outer ring urban freeways in several cities around the world: Toronto in 1997 (Highway 407), several roads in Norway (AutoPASS), Melbourne in 2000 (CityLink), and Tel Aviv also in 2000 (Highway 6).
Congestion pricing or urban toll schemes were implemented to enter the downtown area using ETC technology and/or cameras and video recognition technology to get the plate numbers in several cities around the world: urban tolling in Norway&#x27;s three major cities: 

Singapore in 1974 introduced the world&#x27;s first successful congestion pricing scheme implemented with manual control (see also Singapore&#x27;s Area Licensing Scheme), and was refined in 1998 (see Singapore&#x27;s Electronic Road Pricing), Bergen (1986), Oslo (1990), and Trondheim (1991) (see Trondheim Toll Scheme); Rome in 2001 as an upgrade to the manual zone control system implemented in 1998; London in 2003 and extended in 2007 (see London congestion charge); Stockholm, tested in 2006 and made the charge permanent in 2007 (see Stockholm congestion tax); and in Valletta, the capital city of Malta, since May 2007.

In January 2008, Milan began a one-year trial program called Ecopass, a pollution pricing program in which low-emission-standard vehicles pay a user fee; alternative fuel vehicles and vehicles using conventional fuels but compliant with the Euro IV emission standard are exempted. The program was extended through December 2011 and in January 2012 was replaced by a congestion pricing scheme called Area C.

New York City considered the implementation of a congestion pricing scheme. New York City Council approved such a plan in 2008, but it was not implemented because the New York State Assembly did not approve it. (see New York congestion pricing)

In 2006, San Francisco transport authorities began a comprehensive study to evaluate the feasibility of introducing congestion pricing. The charge would be combined with other traffic reduction implementations, allowing money to be raised for public transit improvements and bike and pedestrian enhancements. The various pricing scenarios considered were presented in public meetings in December 2008, with final study results expected in 2009. (see San Francisco congestion pricing)

Taiwan Highway Electronic Toll Collection System (see Electronic Toll Collection (Taiwan)) In December 2013, the old toll stations were replaced by distance-based pay-as-you-go all-electronic toll collection on all of Taiwan&#x27;s major freeways. All tolls are collected electronically by overhead gantries with multi-lane free flow, not at traditional toll booths. Taiwan was the first country to switch from manual tolling to all-electronic, multi-lane free-flow tolling on all of its freeways. To simulate the previous model, where a vehicle would not pass toll collection over short-distance travel, each vehicle receives 20 kilometers per diem of free travel and is billed NT$1.2 per kilometer thereafter. Buses and trailers are subject to heavy vehicle surcharges. The highway administration may alter fares (e.g. remove the per diem) during peak travel seasons to facilitate distribution of congestion to midnight hours. The toll gates divide the highway into segments, each having a price value determined by distance to the next gate (interchange). A daily gate count is calculated at midnight, and the total charge is deducted in 48 hours. Each vehicle receives a further discount after the first 200 kilometers, and eTag subscribers with prepaid accounts get a further 10% reduction. Non-subscribers are billed by license plate recognition and mail statements, or can make a payment at chain convenient store at third day after vehicle travel, since a subscription to ETC is not mandated by law. Taiwan was the first country to transfer from flat-rate toll stations to a distance-based pay-as-you-go tolling system on all of its freeways. It has the longest ETC freeway mileage in the world.

==Use for non-toll transactions==
* E-ZPass in the northeastern United States can be used to pay at some airport, train, and festival parking lots, and has been tested for use in drive-thrus at private restaurants.
* SunPass in Florida can be used to pay for parking at the Palm Beach International Airport, Tampa International Airport, Orlando International Airport, Fort Lauderdale-Hollywood International Airport, and the Hard Rock Stadium. Despite SunPass&#x27; interoperability with Peach Pass and E-ZPass, those systems are not accepted at these facilities.
* E-Pass can also be used to pay for parking at Orlando International Airport. However, it is not compatible with other airports that use SunPass for parking.
* The NTTA TollTag in Texas can be used to pay for passage and parking in the Dallas/Fort Worth International Airport. Despite TollTag&#x27;s interoperability with EZ Tag, TxTag, PikePass, and K-TAG, those systems are not accepted at this facility.
* Via Verde in Portugal can be used at many gas stations and car parks and at some McDonald&#x27;s drive-thru restaurants.
*BroBizz can be used in toll stations part of EasyGo, as well as some other places within Denmark and Scandinavia, such as for ferries, parking and car washes.
*AutoPASS can be used in toll stations part of EasyGo, as well as some ferries within Norway and Scandinavia.
*Sem Parar in Brazil can be used in many gas stations, car pars on airports and shopping malls and at some McDonald&#x27;s drive-thru restaurants.

==Technologies==

Electronic toll collection systems rely on four major components: automated vehicle identification, automated vehicle classification, transaction processing, and violation enforcement.

The four components are somewhat independent, and, in fact, some toll agencies have contracted out functions separately. In some cases, this division of functions has resulted in difficulties. In one notable example, the New Jersey E-ZPass regional consortium&#x27;s Violation Enforcement contractor did not have access to the Transaction Processing contractor&#x27;s database of customers. This, together with installation problems in the automated vehicle identification system, led to many customers receiving erroneous violation notices, and a violation system whose net income, after expenses, was negative, as well as customer dissatisfaction.

===Automated vehicle identification===
Source:

Automated vehicle identification (AVI) is the process of determining the identity of a vehicle subject to tolls. The majority of toll facilities record the passage of vehicles through a limited number of toll gates. At such facilities, the task is then to identify the vehicle in the gate area.

Some early AVI systems used barcodes affixed to each vehicle, to be read optically at the toll booth. Optical systems proved to have poor reading reliability, especially when faced with inclement weather and dirty vehicles.

Most current AVI systems rely on radio-frequency identification, where an antenna at the toll gate communicates with a transponder on the vehicle via Dedicated Short Range Communications (DSRC). RFID tags have proved to have excellent accuracy, and can be read at highway speeds. The major disadvantage is the cost of equipping each vehicle with a transponder, which can be a major start-up expense, if paid by the toll agency, or a strong customer deterrent, if paid by the customer.

To avoid the need for transponders, some systems, notably the 407 ETR (Express Toll Route) near Toronto and the A282 (M25) Dartford Crossing in the United Kingdom, use automatic number plate recognition. Here, a system of cameras captures images of vehicles passing through tolled areas, and the image of the number plate is extracted and used to identify the vehicle. This allows customers to use the facility without any advance interaction with the toll agency. The disadvantage is that fully automatic recognition has a significant error rate, leading to billing errors and the cost of transaction processing (which requires locating and corresponding with the customer) can be significant. Systems that incorporate a manual review stage have much lower error rates, but require a continuing staffing expense.

A few toll facilities cover a very wide area, making fixed toll gates impractical. The most notable of these is a truck tolling system in (Germany). This system instead uses Global Positioning System location information to identify when a vehicle is located on a tolled Autobahn. Implementation of this system turned out to be far lengthier and more costly than expected.

As smart phone use becomes more commonplace, some toll road management companies have turned to mobile phone apps to inexpensively automate and expedite paying tolls from the lanes. One such example application is Alabama Freedom Pass mobile, used to link customer accounts at sites operated by American Roads LLC. The app communicates in real time with the facility transaction processing system to identify and debit customer accounts or bill a major credit card.

===Automated vehicle classification===
Source:

Automated vehicle classification is closely related to automated vehicle identification (AVI). Most toll facilities charge different rates for different types of vehicles, making it necessary to distinguish the vehicles passing through the toll facility.

The simplest method is to store the vehicle class in the customer record, and use the AVI data to look up the vehicle class. This is low-cost, but limits user flexibility, in such cases as the automobile owner who occasionally tows a trailer.

More complex systems use a variety of sensors. Inductive sensors embedded in the road surface can determine the gaps between vehicles, to provide basic information on the presence of a vehicle. With clever software processing of the inductive data a wide range of vehicle classes can be derived by careful analysis of the inductive profile. Treadles permit counting the number of axles as a vehicle passes over them and, with offset-treadle installations, also detect dual-tire vehicles. Light-curtain laser profilers record the shape of the vehicle, which can help distinguish trucks and trailers. In modern systems simple laser light curtains are being replaced with more technically advanced Lidar systems. These safety critical systems, used in autonomous vehicles, are less sensitive to environmental conditions.

===Transaction processing===
Source:

Transaction processing deals with maintaining customer accounts, posting toll transactions and customer payments to the accounts, and handling customer inquiries. The transaction processing component of some systems is referred to as a &quot;customer service center&quot;. In many respects, the transaction processing function resembles banking, and several toll agencies have contracted out transaction processing to a bank.

Customer accounts may be postpaid, where toll transactions are periodically billed to the customer, or prepaid, where the customer funds a balance in the account which is then depleted as toll transactions occur. The prepaid system is more common, as the small amounts of most tolls makes pursuit of uncollected debts uneconomic. Most postpaid accounts deal with this issue by requiring a security deposit, effectively rendering the account a prepaid one.

===Violation enforcement===
Source:

A violation enforcement system (VES) is useful in reducing unpaid tolls, as an unmanned toll gate otherwise represents a tempting target for toll evasion. Several methods can be used to deter toll violators.

Police patrols at toll gates can be highly effective. In addition, in most jurisdictions, the legal framework is already in place for punishing toll evasion as a traffic infraction. However, the expense of police patrols makes their use on a continuous basis impractical, such that the probability of being stopped is likely to be low enough as to be an insufficient deterrent .

A physical barrier, such as a gate arm, ensures that all vehicles passing through the toll booth have paid a toll. Violators are identified immediately, as the barrier will not permit the violator to proceed. However, barriers also force authorized customers, which are the vast majority of vehicles passing through, to slow to a near-stop at the toll gate, negating much of the speed and capacity benefits of electronic tolling. Furthermore, a violator can effectively block a toll collection lane for an indefinite time. 

Automatic number plate recognition, while rarely used as the primary vehicle identification method, is more commonly used in violation enforcement. In the VES context, the number of images collected is much smaller than in the AVI context. This makes manual review, with its greater accuracy over fully automated methods, practical. However, many jurisdictions require legislative action to permit this type of enforcement, as the number plate identifies only the vehicle, not its operator, and many traffic enforcement regulations require identifying the operator in order to issue an infraction.

An example of this is the vToll system on the Illinois Tollway, which requires transponder users to enter their license plate information before using the system. If the transponder fails to read, the license plate number is matched to the transponder account, and the regular toll amount is deducted from the account rather than a violation being generated. If the license plate cannot be found in the database, then it is processed as a violation. Illinois&#x27; toll violation system has a 7-day grace period, allowing tollway users to pay missed tolls online with no penalty the 7 days following the missed toll.

In the United States, a growing number of states are sharing information on toll violators, where toll agencies can report out-of-state toll violators to the Department of Motor Vehicles (or similar agency) of the violator&#x27;s home state. The state motor vehicle agency can then block the renewal of the vehicle&#x27;s registration until the violator has paid all outstanding tolls, plus penalties and interest in some situations. Toll authorities are also resorting to using collection agencies and litigation for habitual toll violators with large unpaid debts, and some states can pursue criminal prosecution of repeat toll violators, where the violator could serve time in jail, if convicted. Many toll agencies also publicize a list of habitual toll violators through media outlets and newspapers. Some toll agencies offer amnesty periods, where toll violators can settle their outstanding debts without incurring penalties or being subject to litigation or prosecution.

== Privacy ==
Electronic toll collection poses a concern to privacy because the systems record when specific motor vehicles pass toll stations. From this information, one can infer the likely location of the vehicle&#x27;s owner or primary driver at specific times. Technically speaking, using ecash and other modern cryptography methods, one could design systems that do not know where individuals are, but can still collect and enforce tolls.
From the legal standpoint, a proper privacy framework can pose strict bounds on the data retention and rights to access and utilization, especially after the tolls have been successfully paid. For example, images of ANPR cameras may be required deletion as soon as possible for successful tolls.

<doc id="370648" wikidata="Q76190" url="?curid=370648" title="Soap bubble">
<text>A soap bubble (commonly referred to as simply a bubble) is an extremely thin film of soap or detergent and water enclosing air that forms a hollow sphere with an iridescent surface. Soap bubbles usually last for only a few seconds before bursting, either on their own or on contact with another object. They are often used for children&#x27;s enjoyment, but they are also used in artistic performances. Assembling many bubbles results in foam.

When light shines onto a bubble it appears to change colour. Unlike those seen in a rainbow, which arise from differential refraction, the colours seen in a soap bubble arise from light wave interference, reflecting off the front and back surfaces of the thin soap film. Depending on the thickness of the film, different colours interfere constructively and destructively.

== Mathematics ==
Soap bubbles are physical examples of the complex mathematical problem of minimal surface. They will assume the shape of least surface area possible containing a given volume. A true minimal surface is more properly illustrated by a soap film, which has equal pressure on both sides, becoming a surface with zero mean curvature. A soap bubble is a closed soap film: due to the difference in outside and inside pressure, it is a surface of &quot;constant&quot; mean curvature.

While it has been known since 1884 that a spherical soap bubble is the least-area way of enclosing a given volume of air (a theorem of H. A. Schwarz), it was not until 2000 that it was proven that two merged soap bubbles provide the optimum way of enclosing two given volumes of air of different size with the least surface area. This has been dubbed the &quot;double bubble conjecture&quot;.

Because of these qualities, soap bubble films have been used in practical problem solving applications. Structural engineer Frei Otto used soap bubble films to determine the geometry of a sheet of least surface area that spreads between several points, and translated this geometry into revolutionary tensile roof structures. A famous example is his West German Pavilion at Expo 67 in Montreal.

=== Soap bubbles as unconventional computing ===

The structures that soap films make can not just be enclosed as spheres, but virtually any shape, for example in wire frames. Therefore, many different minimal surfaces can be designed. It is actually sometimes easier to physically make them than to compute them by mathematical modelling. This is why the soap films can be considered as analog computers which can outperform conventional computers, depending on the complexity of the system.

== Physics ==

=== Merging ===
When two bubbles merge, they adopt a shape which makes the sum of their surface areas as small as possible, compatible with the volume of air each bubble encloses. If the bubbles are of equal size, their common wall is flat. If they are not the same size, their common wall bulges into the larger bubble, since the smaller one has a higher internal pressure than the larger one, as predicted by the Young–Laplace equation.

At a point where three or more bubbles meet, they sort themselves out so that only three bubble walls meet along a line. Since the surface tension is the same in each of the three surfaces, the three angles between them must be equal to 120°. Only four bubble walls can meet at a point, with the lines where triplets of bubble walls meet separated by cos−1(−1/3) ≈ 109.47°. All these rules, known as Plateau&#x27;s laws, determine how a foam is built from bubbles.

=== Stability ===
The longevity of a soap bubble is limited by the ease of rupture of the very thin layer of water which constitutes its surface, namely a micrometer-thick soap film.
It is thus sensitive to :
* Drainage within the soap film: water falls down due to gravity. This can be slowed by increasing the water viscosity, for instance by adding glycerol. Still, there is an ultimate height limit, which is the capillary length, very high for soap bubbles: around 13 feet (4 meters). In principle, there is no limit in the length it can reach.
* Evaporation: This can be slowed by blowing bubbles in a wet atmosphere, or by adding some sugar to the water.
* Dirt and fat: When the bubble touches an object, it usually ruptures the soap film. This can be prevented by wetting these surfaces with water (preferably containing some soap).

After experiments, researchers found that a solution containing:

* 85.9 % water
* 10 % glycerol
* 4 % dishwashing liquid
* 0.1 % guar gum

gave the longest lasting results as it minimised the Marangoni Effect.

=== Wetting ===

When a soap bubble is in contact with a solid or a liquid surface wetting is observed. On a solid surface, the contact angle of the bubble depends on the surface energy of the solid., A soap bubble has a larger contact angle on a solid surface displaying ultrahydrophobicity than on a hydrophilic surface – see Wetting. On a liquid surface, the contact angle of the soap bubble depends on its size - smaller bubbles have lower contact angles.

=== Floatation ===
The gas inside a bubble is less dense than air because it is mostly water vapor. Water vapor is a gas that is formed when water molecules evaporate. When water molecules evaporate, they escape from the liquid state and enter the gas state. In the gas state, water molecules are further apart than they are in the liquid state. This is because water molecules are attracted to each other. When they evaporate, they break away from these attractions and move further apart.

The further apart water molecules are, the less dense they are. This is why water vapor is less dense than air. The gas inside a bubble is mostly water vapor, so it is also less dense than air.

The density of a gas can also be affected by its temperature. As the temperature of a gas increases, the molecules of the gas move faster. This causes them to spread out and become less dense. The opposite is also true. As the temperature of a gas decreases, the molecules of the gas move slower. This causes them to bunch together and become more dense.

The temperature of the gas inside a bubble is affected by the temperature of the water around it. The warmer the water, the warmer the gas inside the bubble. This means that the gas inside a bubble will be less dense if the water is warm than if the water is cold.

==Recreation==

=== Use in play ===

Soap bubbles have been used as entertainment for at least 400 years, as evidenced by 17th-century Flemish paintings showing children blowing bubbles with clay pipes. The London-based firm A. &amp; F. Pears created a famous advertising campaign for its soaps in 1886 using a painting by John Everett Millais of a child playing with bubbles. The Chicago company Chemtoy began selling bubble solution in the 1940s, and bubble solution has been popular with children ever since. According to one industry estimate, retailers sell around 200 million bottles annually. Dishwashing liquid with water and additional ingredients such as glycerin and sugar is used as a popular alternative to a ready made bubble solution. 

=== Colored bubbles ===
A bubble is made of transparent water enclosing transparent air. However, the soap film is as thin as the visible light wavelength, resulting in optical interference. This creates iridescence which, together with the bubble&#x27;s spherical shape and fragility, contributes to its magical effect on children and adults alike. Each colour is the result of varying thicknesses of soap bubble film. Tom Noddy (who featured in the second episode of Marcus du Sautoy&#x27;s &quot;The Code&quot;) gave the analogy of looking at a contour map of the bubbles&#x27; surface. However, it has become a challenge to produce artificially coloured bubbles.

Byron, Melody &amp; Enoch Swetland invented a patented non-toxic bubble (Tekno Bubbles) that glow under UV lighting. These bubbles look like ordinary high quality &quot;clear&quot; bubbles under normal lighting, but glow when exposed to true UV light. The brighter the UV lighting, the brighter they glow. The family sold them worldwide, but has since sold their company.
Adding coloured dye to bubble mixtures fails to produce coloured bubbles, because the dye attaches to the water molecules as opposed to the surfactant. Therefore, a colourless bubble forms with the dye falling to a point at the base. Dye chemist Dr. Ram Sabnis has developed a lactone dye that sticks to the surfactants, enabling brightly coloured bubbles to be formed. Crystal violet lactone is an example. Another man named Tim Kehoe invented a coloured bubble which loses its colour when exposed to pressure or oxygen, which he is now marketing online as Zubbles, which are non-toxic and non-staining. In 2010, Japanese astronaut Naoko Yamazaki demonstrated that it is possible to create coloured bubbles in microgravity. The reason is that the water molecules are spread evenly around the bubble in the low-gravity environment.

=== Freezing ===

If soap bubbles are blown into air that is below a temperature of , they will freeze when they touch a surface. The air inside will gradually diffuse out, causing the bubble to crumble under its own weight. At temperatures below about , bubbles will freeze in the air and may shatter when hitting the ground. When a bubble is blown with warm air, the bubble will freeze to an almost perfect sphere at first, but when the warm air cools, and a reduction in volume occurs, there will be a partial collapse of the bubble. A bubble, created successfully at this low temperature, will always be rather small; it will freeze quickly and will shatter if increased further.
Freezing of small soap bubbles happens within 2 seconds after setting on snow (at air temperature around –10...–14 °C).

== Art ==
Soap bubble performances combine entertainment with artistic achievement. They require a high degree of skill. Some performers use common commercially available bubble liquids while others compose their own solutions. Some artists create giant bubbles or tubes, often enveloping objects or even humans. Others manage to create bubbles forming cubes, tetrahedra and other shapes and forms. Bubbles are sometimes handled with bare hands. To add to the visual experience, they are sometimes filled with smoke, vapour or helium and combined with laser lights or fire. Soap bubbles can be filled with a flammable gas such as natural gas and then ignited.

Professional bubble artists include Tom Noddy, Fan Yang and The Amazing Bubble Man.

== Education ==
Bubbles can be effectively used to teach and explore a wide variety of concepts to even young children. Flexibility, colour formation, reflective or mirrored surfaces, concave and convex surfaces, transparency, a variety of shapes (circle, square, triangle, sphere, cube, tetrahedron, hexagon), elastic properties, and comparative sizing, as well as the more esoteric properties of bubbles listed on this page. Bubbles are useful in teaching concepts starting from 2 years old and into college years. A Swiss university professor, Dr. Natalie Hartzell, has theorized that the usage of artificial bubbles for entertainment purposes of young children has shown a positive effect in the region of the child&#x27;s brain that controls motor skills and is responsible for coordination with children exposed to bubbles at a young age showing measurably better motion skills than those who were not.

<doc id="370649" wikidata="Q2978886" url="?curid=370649" title="Clement Vallandigham">
<text>Clement Laird Vallandigham ( ; July 29, 1820 – June 17, 1871) was an American lawyer and politician who served as the leader of the Copperhead faction of anti-war Democrats during the American Civil War.

He served two terms for Ohio&#x27;s 3rd congressional district in the United States House of Representatives. In 1863, he was convicted by an Army court martial for publicly expressing opposition to the war and exiled to the Confederate States of America. He ran for governor of Ohio in 1863 from exile in Canada, but was defeated.

Vallandigham died in 1871 in Lebanon, Ohio, after accidentally shooting himself in the abdomen with a pistol, while representing a defendant in a murder case for killing a man in a barroom brawl in Hamilton.

==Early life==
Clement Laird Vallandigham was born July 29, 1820, in New Lisbon, Ohio (now Lisbon, Ohio), to Clement and Rebecca Laird Vallandigham. His father, a Presbyterian minister, educated his son at home.

In 1841, Vallandigham had a dispute with the college president at Jefferson College in Canonsburg, Pennsylvania. He was honorably dismissed, but he never received a degree.

Edwin M. Stanton, the future Secretary of War under President Abraham Lincoln, was Vallandigham&#x27;s close friend before the Civil War. Stanton lent Vallandigham $500 for a law course and to begin his own practice. Both Vallandigham and Stanton were Democrats, but they held opposing views on slavery. Stanton was an abolitionist; Vallandigham an anti-abolitionist.

==Political career==
===Ohio legislature===
Shortly after beginning to practice law in Dayton, Ohio, Vallandigham entered politics. He was elected as a Democrat to the Ohio legislature in 1845 and 1846, and served as editor of a weekly newspaper, the &quot;Dayton Empire&quot;, from 1847 to 1849.

While in the Ohio state legislature, Vallandigham voted against the repeal of the &quot;Black Laws&quot; (laws against the civil rights of African-Americans) though he wanted the question put to a referendum by the voters. In 1851, Vallandigham sought the Democratic nomination to be Ohio&#x27;s lieutenant governor, but the party declined to nominate him.

===House of Representatives===
Vallandigham ran for Congress in 1856, but he was narrowly defeated. He appealed to the Committee of Elections of the House of Representatives and claimed that illegal votes had been cast. The House eventually agreed, and Vallandigham was seated on the next to last day of the term. The delay was caused by &quot;the division which had arisen in the Democratic party upon the Lecompton [slavery in Kansas] question.&quot; He was reelected by a small margin in 1858.

In October 1859, a radical abolitionist, John Brown, raided Harper&#x27;s Ferry, Virginia, seizing the United States Army Arsenal. Vallandigham happened to be passing through the town and joined a group of government officials who interrogated the captured Brown as to his aims, which Brown stated were an attempt to set off a rebellion of slaves to secure their freedom. Vallandingham commented on Brown:

Vallandingham was pro-slavery, described in a hostile newspaper as &quot;perform[ing] the dirty work of the Southern slavocracy&quot;. He was always a vigorous supporter of those &quot;states&#x27; rights&quot;. He believed the federal government had no power to regulate any legal institution, which slavery at the time was. He also believed the states had an implied right to secede and that, legally, the Confederacy could not militarily be conquered. Vallandigham was a believer in low tariffs and that slavery was a matter for each state to decide. During the ensuing war, he would become one of Lincoln&#x27;s most outspoken critics.

He was re-elected to the House in 1860. During the 1860 presidential campaign, he supported Stephen A. Douglas, although he disagreed with Douglas&#x27;s position on &quot;squatter sovereignty&quot;, which was used by detractors to describe popular sovereignty.

On February 20, 1861, Vallandigham delivered a speech, titled &quot;The Great American Revolution,&quot; to the House of Representatives. He accused the Republican Party of being &quot;belligerent&quot; and advocated a &quot;choice of peaceable disunion upon the one hand, or Union through adjustment and conciliation upon the other.&quot; Vallandigham supported the Crittenden Compromise, which was a last-minute effort to avert the Civil War. He blamed sectionalism and anti-slavery sentiment for the secession crisis. Vallandigham proposed a series of amendments to the Constitution. The United States would be divided into four sections: North, South, West, and Pacific. The four sections would each have the power in the Senate to veto legislation. The Electoral College would be modified, with the term of president and vice-president increased to six years and limited to one term unless two thirds of the electors agreed. Secession by a state could be agreed to only if the legislatures of the sections approved it. Moving between the sections was a guaranteed right.

Vallandigham strongly opposed every military bill, which led his opponents to charge that he wanted the Confederacy to win the war. He became the acknowledged leader of the anti-war Copperheads, and in an address on May 8, 1862, he coined their slogan: &quot;To maintain the Constitution as it is, and to restore the Union as it was.&quot; It was endorsed by fifteen Democratic congressmen.

Vallandigham lost his bid for a third full term in 1862 by a relatively large vote, which meant that he would be out of office early in 1863. However, his loss was at least partially caused by the redistricting of his congressional district. Despite this loss, some still considered him to be a future presidential candidate.

As a lame-duck Representative, Vallandigham delivered a speech in the House on January 14, 1863, entitled &quot;The Constitution-Peace-Reunion.&quot; In it, he stated his opposition to abolitionism from the &quot;beginning.&quot; He denounced Lincoln&#x27;s violations of civil liberties, &quot;which have made this country one of the worst despotisms on earth&quot;. Vallandigham openly criticized Lincoln&#x27;s preliminary Emancipation Proclamation, charging that &quot;war for the Union was abandoned; war for the Negro openly begun.&quot; He also condemned financial interests that were profiting from the war: &quot;And let not Wall Street, or any other great interest, mercantile, manufacturing, or commercial, imagine that it shall have power enough or wealth enough to stand in the way of reunion through peace.&quot; Vallandigham added, &quot;Defeat, debt, taxation, sepulchers, these are your trophies.&quot; Vallandigham&#x27;s speech included a proposal to end the military conflict. He advocated an armistice and the demobilization of the military forces of both the Union and the Confederacy.

==Post-congressional activities==

After General Ambrose E. Burnside issued General Order Number 38, warning that the &quot;habit of declaring sympathies for the enemy&quot; would not be tolerated in the Military District of Ohio, Vallandigham gave a major speech on May 1, 1863. He charged that the war was no longer being fought to save the Union, but it had become an attempt to free the slaves by sacrificing the liberty of white Americans to &quot;King Lincoln.&quot;

The authority for Burnside&#x27;s order came from a proclamation of September 24, 1862 in which President Lincoln suspended &quot;habeas corpus&quot; and made discouraging enlistments, drafts, or any other &quot;disloyal&quot; practices subject to martial law and trial by military commissions.

===Arrest and military trial===
On May 5, 1863, Vallandigham was arrested as a violator of General Order Number 38. His enraged supporters burned the offices of the &quot;Dayton Journal&quot;, the Republican rival to the &quot;Empire&quot;. Vallandigham was tried by a military court on May 6 and 7. Vallandigham&#x27;s speech at Mount Vernon, Ohio, was cited as the source of the arrest. He was charged by the Military Commission with &quot;Publicly expressing, in violation of General Orders No. 38, from Head-quarters Department of the Ohio, sympathy for those in arms against the Government of the United States, and declaring disloyal sentiments and opinions, with the object and purpose of weakening the power of the Government in its efforts to suppress an unlawful rebellion.&quot;

The specifications of the charge against Vallandigham were:

Vallandigham wrote that he knew his public opinions and sentiments aided the Confederate war effort, raised public skepticism against the Lincoln administration, raised sympathy for the Confederate soldiers, and encouraged Northerners to violate the wartime laws of the Union.

The peace proposal of France was true. Vallandigham had been requested by Horace Greeley to assist in the peace plan.

Captain James Madison Cutts served as the judge advocate in the military trial and was responsible for authoring the charges against Vallandigham. During the trial, testimony was given by Union army officers who had attended the speech in civilian clothes, that Vallandigham called the president &quot;King Lincoln.&quot; He was sentenced to confinement in a military prison &quot;during the continuance of the war&quot; at Fort Warren, Massachusetts. Vallandigham only called one witness in his defense, Congressman Samuel S. Cox. According to University of New Mexico School of Law Professor Joshua E. Kastenberg, because Cox was another well-known anti-war Democrat, his presence at the military court likely harmed Vallandigham&#x27;s attempts at arguing his innocence.

On May 11, 1863, an application for a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; was filed in federal court for Vallandigham by former Ohio Senator George E. Pugh. Judge Humphrey H. Leavitt of the Circuit Court of the United States for the Southern District of Ohio upheld Vallandigham&#x27;s arrest and military trial as a valid exercise of the President&#x27;s war powers. Congress had passed an act authorizing the president to suspend &quot;habeas corpus&quot; on March 3, 1863.

On May 16, 1863, there was a meeting at Albany, New York, to protest the arrest of Vallandigham. A letter from Governor Horatio Seymour of New York was read to the crowd. Seymour charged that &quot;military despotism&quot; had been established. Resolutions by John V. L. Pruyn were adopted. The resolutions were sent to Lincoln by Erastus Corning. In response to a public letter issued at the meeting of angry Democrats in Albany, Lincoln&#x27;s &quot;Letter to Erastus Corning et al.&quot; of June 12, 1863, explained his justification for supporting the court-martial&#x27;s conviction.

In February 1864, the Supreme Court ruled that it had no power to issue a writ of &quot;habeas corpus&quot; to a military commission (&quot;Ex parte Vallandigham&quot;, 1 Wallace, 243).

===Expulsion===

Lincoln, who considered Vallandigham a &quot;wily agitator,&quot; was wary of making him a martyr to the Copperhead cause, and on May 19, 1863, he ordered Vallandigham to be sent through the enemy lines to the Confederacy. When he was within Confederate lines, Vallandigham said: &quot;I am a citizen of Ohio, and of the United States. I am here within your lines by force, and against my will. I therefore surrender myself to you as a prisoner of war.&quot;

On May 30, 1863, a meeting was held at Military Park in Newark, New Jersey, where a letter was read from New Jersey Governor Joel Parker that condemned the arrest, trial, and deportation of Vallandigham as &quot;were arbitrary and illegal acts. The whole proceeding was wrong in principle and dangerous in its tendency.&quot; However, the meeting was sparsely attended. The &quot;New York World&quot; reported on the meeting in Albany. Burnside suppressed publication of the &quot;World&quot;. On June 1, 1863, another protest meeting was held in Philadelphia.

On June 2, 1863, Vallandigham was sent to Wilmington, North Carolina, by Confederate President Jefferson Davis and was briefly put under guard as an &quot;alien enemy.&quot;

President Lincoln wrote the &quot;Birchard Letter&quot; of June 29, 1863 to several Ohio congressmen; it offered to revoke Vallandigham&#x27;s deportation order if they would agree to support certain policies of the Administration.

Vallandigham travelled to Richmond, Virginia, where he met with Robert Ould, a former classmate. He advised Ould that the Confederate army should not invade Pennsylvania since it would unite the North against the Copperheads during the 1864 presidential election. However, a letter to the editor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; gave a different version that Vallandigham had encouraged the invasion.

Vallandigham then left the Confederacy on a blockade runner to Bermuda and from there went to Canada. He then declared himself a candidate for Governor of Ohio and actually won the Democratic nomination &quot;in absentia&quot;. (Outraged at his treatment by Lincoln, Ohio Democrats by a vote of 411–11 nominated Vallandigham for governor at their June 11 convention.) He managed his campaign from a hotel in Windsor, where he received a steady stream of visitors and supporters.

Vallandigham asked the question in his address or letter of July 15, 1863, &quot;To the Democracy of Ohio:&quot; &quot;Shall there be free speech, a free press, peaceable assemblages of the people, and a free ballot any longer in Ohio?&quot;

Vallandigham lost the 1863 Ohio gubernatorial election in a landslide to the pro-Union War Democrat John Brough by a vote of 288,374 to 187,492.

===The Northwestern Confederacy===
In Canada, sometime around March 1864, Vallandigham became a leader of the Order of the Sons of Liberty and conspired with Jacob Thompson, and other agents of the Confederate government to form a Northwestern Confederacy, consisting of the states of Ohio, Kentucky, Indiana, and Illinois, by overthrowing their governments. Vallandigham requested money for weapons from the Confederates and refused to handle the money himself, which was given to his associate James A. Barrett. Part of the Confederate plan was to liberate Confederate prisoners-of-war.

Vallandigham crossed back to the US &quot;under heavy disguise&quot; on June 14 and gave a passionate speech at an impromptu Democratic convention in Hamilton, Ohio, the next day. In that speech, he felt it necessary to lie about his involvement in a &quot;subversive organization&quot; that he failed to name.

Lincoln was informed of his return. On June 24, 1864, Lincoln drafted a letter to Governor Brough and General Samuel P. Heintzelman and stated to &quot;watch Vallandigham and others closely&quot; and to arrest them if necessary. However, he did not send the letter, and it appears that he decided to do nothing about Vallandigham&#x27;s return. In late August, Vallandigham openly attended the 1864 Democratic National Convention in Chicago as a district delegate for Ohio.

The reception by the convention to Vallandigham was mixed. Vallandigham received &quot;vehement applause.&quot; At one point, Vallandigham&#x27;s name was called out by the audience and the response was &quot;applause and hisses.&quot; There were &quot;cheers and hisses&quot; on another occasion that he spoke.

Vallandigham promoted the &quot;peace plank&quot; of the platform, which declared the war a failure and demanded an immediate end of hostilities. In his acceptance letter, George B. McClellan made peace conditional on the Confederacy being ready for peace and to rejoin the Union. McClellan&#x27;s stance conflicted with the Democratic Party Platform of 1864 which stated that &quot;immediate efforts be made for a cessation of hostilities, with a view to an ultimate convention of the States, or other peaceable means, to the end that, at the earliest practicable moment, peace may be restored on the basis of the Federal union of the States.&quot; Vallandigham supported his party&#x27;s nomination of McClellan for the presidency but was &quot;highly indignant&quot; when McClellan repudiated the party platform in his letter of acceptance of the nomination. For a time, Vallandigham withdrew from campaigning for McClellan. The contradiction between the party platform and McClellan&#x27;s views weakened Democratic efforts to win voters over.

In late September 1864, the conspiracy trial of Harrison H. Dodd, William A. Bowles, Andrew Humphreys, Horace Heffren, and Lambdin P. Milligan, members of the Knights of the Golden Circle, a paramilitary organization that had been founded in Cincinnati in 1854, morphed into the Order of American Knights, and become the Sons of Liberty, began in Indianapolis before a military commission. George E. Pugh testified as a government witness. Testimony confirmed Vallandigham was &quot;Supreme Commander,&quot; and James A. Barrett was the &quot;Chief of Staff&quot; to Vallandigham. Witnesses testified that a mysterious Mr. Piper had communicated to them on behalf of Vallandigham. According to the testimony of Felix G. Stidger, an undercover federal agent who had infiltrated the Knights of the Golden Circle, the plan of Vallandigham was to begin a revolt sometime between November 3 and 17. The case went to the US Supreme Court, which in 1866 in &quot;Ex parte Milligan&quot;, ruled that the use of military tribunals to try civilians is unconstitutional if civil courts are still operating.

In April 1865, Vallandigham testified at the conspiracy trial of the American Knights in Cincinnati. He admitted to conversing with Jacob Thompson, the Confederate agent in Canada. The intended revolt never materialized.

===Post-war===
In 1867, Vallandigham continued his stance against African-American suffrage and equality. However, his views later changed with the New Departure policy.

Vallandigham returned to Ohio, lost his campaigns for the Senate against Judge Allen G. Thurman and the House of Representatives against Robert C. Schenck on an anti-Reconstruction platform. He then resumed his law practice.

In 1871, Vallandigham won the Ohio Democrats over to the &quot;New Departure&quot; policy, which would essentially neglect to mention the Civil War, &quot;thus burying out of sight all that is of the dead past, namely, the right of secession, slavery, inequality before the law, and political inequality; and further, now that reconstruction is complete, and representation within the Union restored.&quot; He also affirmed &quot;the Democratic party pledges itself to the full, faithful, and absolute execution and enforcement of the Constitution as it now is, so as to secure equal rights to all persons under it, without distinction of race, color, or condition.&quot; It also called for civil service reform and a progressive income tax (items 10 and 12). It was against the &quot;Ku-Klux Bill&quot; (item 17). &quot;New Departure&quot; was endorsed by Salmon P. Chase, a former Lincoln cabinet member and Chief Justice of the United States.

==Death and burial ==
Vallandigham died in 1871 in Lebanon, Ohio, at the age of 50, after he accidentally shot himself in the abdomen with a pistol. He was representing a defendant, Thomas McGehean, in a murder case for killing a man in a barroom brawl in Hamilton, Ohio. Vallandigham attempted to prove the victim, Tom Myers, had in fact accidentally shot himself while he was drawing his pistol from a pocket while rising from a kneeling position. As Vallandigham conferred with fellow defense attorneys in his hotel room at the Lebanon House, later the Golden Lamb Inn, he showed them how he would demonstrate this to the jury. Selecting a pistol he believed to be unloaded, he put it in his pocket and enacted the events as they might have happened, snagging the loaded gun on his clothing and unintentionally causing it to discharge into his stomach.

Although he was fatally wounded, Vallandigham&#x27;s demonstration proved his point, and the defendant, Thomas McGehean, was acquitted and released from custody (only to be shot to death four years later in his saloon). Surgeons probed for the pistol ball, thought to have lodged in the vicinity of Vallandigham&#x27;s bladder, but were unable to locate it, and Vallandigham died the next day of peritonitis. His last words expressed his faith in &quot;that good old Presbyterian doctrine of predestination&quot;. Survived by his wife, Louisa Anna (McMahon) Vallandigham, and his son Charles Vallandigham, he was buried in Woodland Cemetery in Dayton, Ohio.

=== Legacy ===
Vallandigham was eulogized by James W. Wall, a former senator from New Jersey, who mentioned recently meeting with him about &quot;New Departure&quot;. Wall had been imprisoned during the Civil War by Union authorities.

John A. McMahon, Vallandigham&#x27;s nephew, was also a U.S. Representative from Ohio.

==In popular culture==
Vallandigham&#x27;s deportation to the Confederacy prompted Edward Everett Hale to write &quot;The Man Without a Country.&quot; The short story, which appeared in &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; in December 1863, was widely republished. In 1898, Hale made the assertion that Vallandigham stated &quot;he did not want to belong to the United States.&quot;

Vallandigham is a character in some alternate history novels. In Ward Moore&#x27;s &quot;Bring the Jubilee&quot; (1953) and William Gibson and Bruce Sterling&#x27;s &quot;The Difference Engine&quot; (1990), Vallandigham defeated Lincoln in the presidential election of 1864 after the South won the Civil War. In Harry Turtledove&#x27;s &quot;The Guns of the South&quot; (1992), he is elected vice-president in the same year for the same reason.

In CBBC&#x27;s &quot;Horrible Histories&quot;, Vallandigham is played by Ben Willbond. In &quot;Horrible Histories&quot; he is shown as an excellent lawyer who is, however, extremely embarrassed by the idiotic way in which he died: by having killed himself by accident while he was defending his client, Thomas McGehean.

<doc id="370650" wikidata="Q776064" url="?curid=370650" title="Bat Out of Hell">
<text>Bat Out of Hell is the debut studio album by American rock singer Meat Loaf and composer Jim Steinman. The album was developed from the musical &quot;Neverland. Neverland&quot; is a futuristic rock version of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; which Steinman wrote for a workshop in 1974. It was recorded during 1975–1976 at various studios, including Bearsville Studios in Woodstock, New York. The album was produced by Todd Rundgren, and released in October 1977 by Cleveland International/Epic Records. &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; spawned two Meat Loaf sequel albums: &quot;Bat Out of Hell II: Back into Hell&quot; (1993) and &quot;Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose&quot; (2006).

&quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; has sold over 43 million copies worldwide, making it one of the best-selling albums of all time. It is certified 14× platinum by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA). It is the best-selling album in Australia, having been certified 26× platinum by the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA). As of June 2019, it has spent 522 weeks in the UK Albums Chart, the fourth longest chart run by a studio album. In 2012, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; ranked it at number 343 on its list of the 500 Greatest Albums of All Time.

A musical based on &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, staged by Jay Scheib, opened at the Manchester Opera House on February 17, 2017, before transferring to the London Coliseum and Toronto&#x27;s Ed Mirvish Theatre in late 2017. Between April 2, 2018 and January 5, 2019, the show was performed at the Dominion Theatre in London, before a short run the same year in the United States.

==Pre-production==
The album was developed from a musical, &quot;Neverland&quot;; the play is a futuristic rock version of &quot;Peter Pan&quot; which Steinman wrote for a workshop in 1974, and performed at the Kennedy Center Music Theatre Lab in 1977. Steinman and Meat Loaf, who were touring with &quot;The National Lampoon Show&quot;, felt that three songs were &quot;exceptional&quot; and Steinman began to develop them as part of a seven-song set they wanted to record as an album. The three songs were &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot; and &quot;The Formation of the Pack&quot;, which was later retitled &quot;All Revved Up with No Place to Go&quot;.

&quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; is often compared to the music of Bruce Springsteen, particularly the album &quot;Born to Run&quot;. Steinman says he finds that &quot;puzzling, musically&quot;, although they share influences; &quot;Springsteen was more an inspiration than an influence.&quot; A BBC article added &quot;that Max Weinberg and Roy Bittan from Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band played on the album only helped reinforce the comparison.&quot;

Steinman and Meat Loaf had difficulty finding a record company willing to sign them. According to Meat Loaf&#x27;s autobiography, the band spent most of 1975 writing and recording material, and two and a half years auditioning the record and being rejected. Manager David Sonenberg jokes that new record companies were being created just so the album could be rejected. They performed the album live in 1976, with Steinman on piano, Meat Loaf singing, and sometimes Ellen Foley joining them for &quot;Paradise&quot;. Steinman says that it was a &quot;medley of the most brutal rejections you could imagine.&quot; Meat Loaf &quot;almost cracked&quot; when CBS executive Clive Davis rejected the project. According to Meat Loaf&#x27;s autobiography, Davis commented that &quot;actors don&#x27;t make records&quot; and challenged Steinman&#x27;s writing abilities and knowledge of rock music:

Do you know how to write a song? Do you know &quot;anything&quot; about writing? If you&#x27;re going to write for records, it goes like this: A, B, C, B, C, C. I don&#x27;t know what you&#x27;re doing. You&#x27;re doing A, D, F, G, B, D, C. You don&#x27;t know &quot;how&quot; to write a song... Have you ever listened to pop music? Have you ever heard any rock-and-roll music... You should go downstairs when you leave here...and buy some rock-and-roll records.

Meat Loaf asserts &quot;Jim, at the time, knew every record ever made. [He] is a walking rock encyclopedia.&quot; Although Steinman laughed off the insults, the singer screamed &quot;Fuck you, Clive!&quot; from the street up to his building.

In one 1989 interview with &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine, Steinman labeled Todd Rundgren &quot;the only genuine genius I&#x27;ve ever worked with.&quot; In a 1989 interview with Redbeard for the &quot;In the Studio with Redbeard&quot; episode on the making of the album, Meat Loaf revealed that Jimmy Iovine and Andy Johns were potential candidates for producing &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; before being rejected by the singer and Steinman in favor of Todd Rundgren, whom Meat Loaf initially found cocky but grew to like. Rundgren found the album hilarious, thinking it was a parody of Springsteen. The singer quotes him as saying: &quot;I&#x27;ve &#x27;got&#x27; to do this album. It&#x27;s just so &#x27;out&#x27; there.&quot; They told the producer that they had previously been signed to RCA.

==Production==
Recording started in late 1975 in Bearsville Studios, Woodstock, New York. Roy Bittan and Max Weinberg, the pianist and the drummer from Springsteen&#x27;s E Street Band played on the album, in addition to members of Rundgren&#x27;s group Utopia: Kasim Sulton, Roger Powell and John &quot;Willie&quot; Wilcox. Edgar Winter played the saxophone on &quot;All Revved Up&quot;. Rundgren himself played guitar, including the &quot;motorcycle solo&quot; on &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;. Both Steinman and Rundgren were influenced by Phil Spector and his &quot;Wall of Sound&quot;. According to Meat Loaf, Rundgren put all the arrangements together because although &quot;Jim could hear all the instruments&quot; in his head, Steinman hummed rather than orchestrated.

When Rundgren discovered that the deal with RCA did not actually exist, Albert Grossman, who had been Bob Dylan&#x27;s manager, offered to put it on his Bearsville label but needed more money. Rundgren had essentially paid for the album himself. Mo Ostin at Warner Bros. was impressed, but other senior people rejected them after they performed live. Steinman had offended them a few years earlier by auditioning with a song named &quot;Who Needs the Young&quot;, which contains the lyric &quot;Is there anyone left who can fuck? Screw &#x27;em!&quot;.

Another E Street Band member, Steven Van Zandt, and Sonenberg arranged to contact Cleveland International Records, a subsidiary of Epic Records. After listening to the spoken word intro to &quot;You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth (Hot Summer Night)&quot;, founder Steve Popovich accepted the album for Cleveland.

Rundgren initially mixed the record in one night. However, some of the mixes were unsuitable, to the extent that Meat Loaf did not want &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Light&quot; on the album. Jimmy Iovine, who had mixed Springsteen&#x27;s &quot;Born to Run,&quot; remixed &quot;Two Out of Three Ain&#x27;t Bad&quot;. After several attempts by several people, John Jansen mixed the version of &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Light&quot; that is on the album, along with &quot;All Revved Up with No Place to Go&quot;. According to Meat Loaf, he, Jansen and Steinman mixed the title track.

Phil Rizzuto&#x27;s baseball play-by-play call for &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Light&quot; was recorded in 1976 at The Hit Factory in New York City by Rundgren, Meat Loaf and Steinman. As an Italian Catholic, Rizzuto publicly maintained he was unaware that his contribution would be equated with sex in the finished song. However, Meat Loaf asserts that Rizzuto claimed ignorance only to stifle criticism and was fully aware of the context of what he was recording.

In a 2016 interview with the BBC, Meat Loaf claimed the entire album was &quot;sped up&quot; when it was released as compared to the recording.

==Composition==
Todd Rundgren states that Steinman was highly influenced by the &quot;rural suburban teenage angst&quot; of Springsteen. According to manager David Sonenberg, &quot;Jim would always come up with these great titles and then he would write a song that would try to justify the greatness of the title.&quot;

Since 1968, Steinman had been working on a magnum opus, which finally opened in 2017 in the form of &quot;Bat Out Of Hell: The Musical&quot;. The first incarnation of his work was a musical called &quot;The Dream Engine&quot; when he was in college at Amherst. The qualities of teenage rebellion and a girl joining a &quot;tribe&quot; led by a charismatic leader are present in all versions of Steinman&#x27;s work. It is in &quot;The Dream Engine&quot; that the spoken word piece &quot;Hot Summer Night&quot; originates, and is the earliest work that appears on the Meat Loaf album, where it is performed by Jim Steinman and actress Marcia McClain.

The next incarnation of Steinman&#x27;s magnum opus, during the 1970s, was a musical called &quot;Neverland&quot;, which contained many of the same scenes and themes as &quot;The Dream Engine&quot; but was now largely depoliticized and contained many Peter Pan references. Some scenes in &quot;Neverland&quot;, such as the parents feeding their imprisoned daughter &quot;dream suppressant&quot; drugs, are still present in &quot;Bat Out Of Hell: The Musical&quot;, but overall &quot;Neverland&quot; was of a much darker tone. This musical contained the songs &quot;Heaven Can Wait&quot;, &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, and &quot;All Revved Up with No Place to Go&quot;. On the 25th anniversary version of &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;, one of the bonus live tracks, &quot;Great Boleros of Fire&quot;, is an instrumental version of another song from &quot;Neverland&quot; titled &quot;Gods&quot;. (Meat Loaf finally recorded and released this song under the title &quot;Godz&quot; on his 2016 album &quot;Braver Than We Are.&quot;)

When staged in 1977, the cast of &quot;Neverland&quot; included Ellen Foley as Wendy – who performs the lead female vocal on &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Light&quot; on the album. The music for &quot;Neverland&quot; was performed by Orchestra Luna, and one of their members at the time was Karla DeVito. Foley was not available when it came time to go on tour for the album, so Karla DeVito took her place. In the various promotional music videos for the songs on the album &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; Karla DeVito&#x27;s lips are synced to Ellen Foley&#x27;s album vocals.

The opening track &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; is the result of Steinman&#x27;s desire to write the &quot;most extreme crash song of all time&quot;.

&quot;You Took the Words Right Out of My Mouth&quot; is musically inspired by the rock chords of The Who&#x27;s &quot;Baba O&#x27;Riley&quot; with a Phil Spector-style melody on top. In Jim Steinman&#x27;s &quot;Neverland&quot; and &quot;Bat Out of Hell: The Musical&quot;, the spoken word &quot;Hot Summer Night&quot; and this song are used as an exchange of wedding vows, and to celebrate a wedding.

The song &quot;Two Out of Three Ain&#x27;t Bad&quot; was written in direct response to actress Mimi Kennedy asking Jim Steinman whether he could write a simple song like Elvis Presley&#x27;s &quot;I Want You, I Need You, I Love You&quot;. Todd Rundgren identifies how the song was influenced by the Eagles, who were successful at the time. The producer also highlights the &quot;underlying humor in the lyrics&quot;, citing the line &quot;There ain&#x27;t no Coupe de Ville hiding at the bottom of a Cracker Jack box.&quot; He says you could &quot;get away&quot; with that lyric only &quot;in a Meat Loaf song.&quot;

Ellen Foley, who appears on &quot;Paradise by the Dashboard Light&quot;, first met Meat Loaf and Jim Steinman while they were all working together on the National Lampoon Road Tour, so they had a history of performing over-the-top musical comedy sketches together. The baseball commentary make-out section performed by New York Yankees announcer Phil Rizzuto was written with the announcer in mind, using phrases he would actually say during commentary.

&quot;For Crying Out Loud&quot; was originally written for the 1975 New York Shakespeare Festival musical Kid Champion, and a recording by an unknown artist is in the New York Public Library archives. Jim Steinman considers the line &quot;And can&#x27;t you see my faded Levi&#x27;s bursting apart&quot; his most daring lyric on the entire album.

Comparing the album to Steinman&#x27;s late-1960s musical &quot;The Dream Engine&quot;, &quot;Classic Rock&quot; magazine says that Steinman&#x27;s imagery is &quot;revved up and testosterone-fueled. Songs like &#x27;Paradise by the Dashboard Light,&#x27; &#x27;Two Out of Three Ain&#x27;t Bad&#x27; and &#x27;For Crying Out Loud&#x27; echoed the textbook teenage view of sex and life: irrepressible physical urges and unrealistic romantic longing.&quot;

Steinman&#x27;s songs for &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; are personal but not autobiographical:

I never thought of them as personal songs in terms of my own life but they were personality songs. They were all about my obsessions and images. None of them takes place in a normal world. They all take place in an extreme world. Very operatic...they were all heightened. They don&#x27;t take place in normal reality.

For example, citing the narrative of &quot;Paradise&quot;, Rundgren jokes that he can&#x27;t imagine Steinman being at a lakeside with the most beautiful girl in school, but he can imagine Steinman &quot;imagining&quot; it.

==Cover==
Steinman is credited with the album cover concept, which was illustrated by Richard Corben. The cover depicts a motorcycle, ridden by a long-haired man, bursting out of the ground in a graveyard. In the background, a large bat perches atop a mausoleum that towers above the rest of the tombstones. In 2001, &quot;Q&quot; magazine listed the cover as number 71 in its list of &quot;The Hundred Best Record Covers of All Time&quot;.

Steinman had wanted equal billing with Meat Loaf on the album&#x27;s title; he wanted it to be called &quot;Jim Steinman presents...&quot; or &quot;&quot;Jim and Meat&quot;,&quot; or vice versa. For marketing reasons, the record company wished to make &#x27;Meat Loaf&#x27; the recognizable name. As a compromise, the words &quot;Songs by Jim Steinman&quot; appear relatively prominently on the cover. The singer believes that this was probably the beginning of their &quot;ambivalent relationship&quot;.

Steinman registered &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; as a trademark in 1995, and sought to prevent Meat Loaf from using the title. In 2006, however, the singer sought to cancel Steinman&#x27;s trademark and use the title for &quot;Bat Out of Hell III: The Monster Is Loose&quot;.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; was released by Cleveland International Records in October 1977. However, at Cleveland International Records&#x27; parent label, Epic Records, almost everyone hated it. Steve Popovich, the head of Cleveland International Records, was relentless in his efforts to get Epic and all of CBS Records and radio on board. In 1993, Steinman reflected that the album was &quot;timeless in that it didn&#x27;t fit into any trend. It&#x27;s never been a part of what&#x27;s going on. You could release that record at any time and it would be out of place.&quot;

Response to the album was slow. Todd Rundgren asserts that it was &quot;underpromoted&quot;, having a reputation of being &quot;damaged goods because it had been walked around to so many places.&quot; Due to the enthusiastic response to the music videos from the record, Australian and British audiences were the first to develop interest. The BBC television program &quot;The Old Grey Whistle Test&quot; aired a clip of the live band performing the nine-minute title track. According to &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, the response was so overwhelming that they screened it again the following week. They later invited the band to perform &quot;Paradise&quot; live. &quot;As a result, in the UK, &#x27;Bat&#x27; became an unfashionable, uncool, non-radio record that became a &#x27;must-have&#x27; for everyone who heard it, whether they &#x27;got&#x27; Steinman&#x27;s unique perspective or not.&quot;

Meanwhile, in North America, according to &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, Popovich and his partners began promoting the album aggressively, first getting radio play in Omaha, Neb., Cleveland and New York. By year&#x27;s end, the album had sold a respectable 140,000 copies by Popovich&#x27;s account, but the promotion people at Epic were still unmoved. Popovich, in a letter to his former boss Alexenburg, complained, &quot;Some of your guys have given up.&quot; But not in Canada: Graham Powers, CBS Canada&#x27;s Director of Marketing introduced himself to CHUM-FM&#x27;s new Program Director Warren Cosford. Cosford&#x27;s background was as the production manager of radio documentaries on The Beatles, Elvis Presley and the 64-hour &quot;Evolution of Rock&quot; which were in syndication throughout North America. Powers had heard that Warren was a fan of &#x27;Wall of Sound&#x27; production and suggested that he listen to &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; over the Christmas and New Years holiday. Cosford loved it. The first day after New Years he called a music meeting. Everyone agreed they should not only &#x27;add&#x27; &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot;...but put it in &#x27;Heavy Rotation&#x27; for a week to gauge audience response. The telephones lit up. As their parent company in New York had earlier turned the record down and were merely distributing it, CBS Canada were surprised, but jumped on board. Later, as Graham Powers said, &quot;Tackling the Meat Loaf campaign was different from handling most other CBS international acts in that there was no prior stateside success to refer to. The album was doing virtually nothing in the U.S. and subsequently had to be approached as a totally new project in Canada with a Marketing Campaign developed from scratch.&quot; Publicity Manager Liz Braun added that after Meat Loaf had played at the El Mocambo where he caused a riot, all the press in town wanted to talk to him and did. Suddenly he had a hardcore following in Toronto and he was asked to perform at the CBS Convention in New Orleans. &quot;Meat Loaf &#x27;Live&#x27; at The El Mocambo&quot; was immediately pressed to disc and distributed to stations throughout North America.

The album has been released in various formats, including a Super Audio CD version, a 25th anniversary edition (2001 – Epic/Legacy #62171) with two bonus tracks (&quot;Great Boléros of Fire (live intro)&quot; [3:54] and &quot;Bat Out of Hell (live)&quot; [11:10], and a &quot;Bat Out of Hell: Re-Vamped&quot; release (1991) containing the bonus song &quot;Dead Ringer for Love&quot;. A new hybrid SACD version was released in late 2016 by Analog Spark, an audiophile imprint of the Razor &amp; Tie label, mastered from the original tapes by Ryan Smith at Sterling Sound.

==Reception==
The album was not an immediate hit in the United States. Reviews were initially mixed, but have since become much more positive. On release, Dave Marsh&#x27;s review in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called the songs &quot;swell, but... entirely mannered and derivative&quot; and noted that the arrangements &quot;aren&#x27;t bad&quot;, and commended the musicians. He concluded by noting that the &quot;principals have some growing to do.&quot;

===Legacy===
Stephen Erlewine in AllMusic writes that &quot;this is Grand Guignol pop—epic, gothic, operatic, and silly, and it&#x27;s appealing because of all of this.&quot; He thinks that Steinman is &quot;a composer without peer, simply because nobody else wanted to make mini-epics like this.&quot; Rundgren&#x27;s production is applauded, as is the wit in the music and lyrics. &quot;It may elevate adolescent passion to operatic dimensions, and that&#x27;s certainly silly, but it&#x27;s hard not to marvel at the skill behind this grandly silly, irresistible album.&quot;

In 1989, &quot;Kerrang!&quot; magazine listed the album at number 38 among the &quot;100 Greatest Heavy Metal Albums of All Time&quot;.
The album was ranked number 343 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s 2003 list of the 500 greatest albums of all time, but was removed from the 2020 revision. In 2005, &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; was ranked number 301 in &quot;Rock Hard&quot; magazine&#x27;s book of &quot;The 500 Greatest Rock &amp; Metal Albums of All Time&quot;. In 2006, it was voted number nine in a poll conducted by the Australian Broadcasting Corporation to discover Australia&#x27;s most popular album. In November 2007, Meat Loaf was awarded the Classic Album award in &quot;Classic Rock&quot;&#x27;s &quot;Classic Rock Roll of Honour&quot;. The album was also included in the book &quot;1001 Albums You Must Hear Before You Die&quot;.

The album continues to sell about 200,000 copies per year and has sold an estimated 34-40 million copies worldwide, including 14 million in the United States and over 1.7 million albums in Australia, where it is the country&#x27;s highest-selling album as of 2016, being certified 26× platinum. The album has stayed on the UK Albums Chart for 522 weeks, making it the UK&#x27;s fourth longest charting studio album behind Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s &quot;Rumours&quot;, Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Dark Side of the Moon&quot; and Oasis&#x27; &quot;(What&#x27;s the Story) Morning Glory?&quot;. In 2022, &quot;Bat Out of Hell&quot; was named as the biggest-selling debut album in UK chart history.

The album launched the career of Steinman, who would later begin producing his records as well; he was specifically sought by Bonnie Tyler on the basis of his work and production styles on the album to revitalize her career and produce an album specifically modeled on the productions of Phil Spector. The resulting album, &quot;Faster Than the Speed of Night&quot; became a commercial success, with its lead single &quot;Total Eclipse of the Heart&quot; placing at the top of the charts in the United States and the United Kingdom. Aside from Tyler, he composed and produced songs for musicians such as Air Supply, Barry Manilow, Barbra Streisand, the Sisters of Mercy, and Celine Dion.

<text>Esther Phillips (born Esther Mae Washington; December 23, 1935 – August 7, 1984) was an American singer, best known for her R&amp;B vocals. She rose to prominence in 1950, scoring several major R&amp;B hits including &quot;Double Crossing Blues&quot; and &quot;Mistrustin&#x27; Blues&quot; under the moniker &quot;Little Esther&quot;. In the 1960s, she achieved chart success with the country song &quot;Release Me&quot; and recorded in the pop, jazz, blues and soul genres. Phillips received a Grammy nomination for her single &quot;Home Is Where the Hatred Is&quot; in 1973 and her disco recording of &quot;What a Diff&#x27;rence a Day Makes&quot; was a major hit in 1975. She died from liver and kidney failure due to long-term drug abuse in 1984.

== Biography ==

=== Early life ===
Phillips was born Esther Mae Washington in Galveston, Texas, U.S. Her parents divorced during her adolescence, and she divided her time between her father, in Houston, and her mother, in the Watts section of Los Angeles. She was brought up singing in church and was reluctant to enter a talent contest at a local blues club, but her sister insisted. A mature singer at the age of 14, she won the amateur talent contest in 1949 at the Barrelhouse Club, owned by Johnny Otis. Otis was so impressed that he recorded her for Modern Records and added her to his traveling revue, the California Rhythm and Blues Caravan, billed as Little Esther. She later took the surname Phillips as her stage name, reportedly inspired by a sign at a gas station.

=== Early career ===
Her first hit record was &quot;Double Crossing Blues&quot;, with the Johnny Otis Quintette and the Robins (a vocal group), released in 1950 by Savoy Records, which reached number 1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; R&amp;B chart. She made several hit records for Savoy with the Johnny Otis Orchestra, including &quot;Mistrusting Blues&quot; (a duet with Mel Walker) and &quot;Cupid&#x27;s Boogie&quot;, both of which also went to number 1 that year. Four more of her records made the Top 10 in the same year: &quot;Misery&quot; (number 9), &quot;Deceivin&#x27; Blues&quot; (number 4), &quot;Wedding Boogie&quot; (number 6), and &quot;Far Away Blues (Xmas Blues)&quot; (number 6). Few female artists performing in any genre had such success in their debut year.

Phillips left Otis and the Savoy label at the end of 1950 and signed with Federal Records. But just as quickly as the hits had started, they stopped. She recorded more than thirty sides for Federal, but only one, &quot;Ring-a-Ding-Doo&quot;, made the charts, reaching number 8 in 1952. Not working with Otis was part of her problem; the other part was her deepening dependence on heroin, to which she was addicted by the middle of the decade.

In 1954, she returned to Houston to live with her father and recuperate. Short on money, she worked in small nightclubs around the South, punctuated by periodic hospital stays in Lexington, Kentucky, to treat her addiction. In 1962, Kenny Rogers discovered her singing at a Houston club and helped her get a contract with Lenox Records, owned by his brother Lelan.

=== Comeback ===
Phillips eventually recovered enough to launch a comeback in 1962. Now billed as Esther Phillips instead of Little Esther, she recorded a country tune, &quot;Release Me&quot;, with the producer Bob Gans. This went to number 1 on the R&amp;B chart and number 8 on the pop chart. After several other minor R&amp;B hits for Lenox, she was signed by Atlantic Records. Her cover of the Beatles&#x27; song &quot;And I Love Him&quot; nearly made the R&amp;B Top 20 in 1965. The Beatles flew her to the UK for her first overseas performances. In July 2018, Paul McCartney recalled &quot;the earliest [Beatles cover] that really caught my ear was by Esther Phillips ... &quot;And I Love Him&quot; which is really great. I love it.&quot;

She had other hits in the 1960s for Atlantic, such as the Jimmy Radcliffe song &quot;Try Me&quot;, which featured a saxophone part by King Curtis (and is often mistakenly credited as the James Brown song of the same title), but she had no more chart-toppers. Her heroin dependence worsened, and she checked into a rehabilitation facility. There she met the singer Sam Fletcher. While undergoing treatment, she recorded some sides for Roulette in 1969, mostly produced by Lelan Rogers. On her release, she returned to Los Angeles and re-signed with Atlantic. Her friendship with Fletcher resulted in a performance engagement at Freddie Jett&#x27;s Pied Piper club in late 1969, which produced the album &quot;Burnin&quot;&#x27;. She performed with the Johnny Otis Show at the Monterey Jazz Festival in 1970.

=== The 1970s and 1980s ===
One of her biggest post-1950s triumphs was her first album for the Kudu label, &quot;From a Whisper to a Scream&quot;, in 1972. The lead track, &quot;Home Is Where the Hatred Is&quot;, an account of drug use written by Gil Scott-Heron, was nominated for a Grammy Award. Phillips lost to Aretha Franklin, but Franklin presented the trophy to her, saying she should have won it instead.

In 1975, she released a disco-style update of Dinah Washington&#x27;s &quot;What a Diff&#x27;rence a Day Makes&quot;, her biggest hit single since &quot;Release Me&quot;. It reached the Top 20 in the United States and the Top 10 in the UK Singles Chart. On November 8, 1975, she performed the song on an episode of &quot;NBC&#x27;s Saturday Night&quot; (later called &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;) hosted by Candice Bergen. The accompanying album of the same name became her biggest seller yet, with arranger Joe Beck on guitar, Michael Brecker on tenor sax, David Sanborn on alto sax, Randy Brecker on trumpet, Steve Khan on guitar and Don Grolnick on keyboards.

She continued to record and perform throughout the 1970s and early 1980s, completing seven albums for Kudu/CTI and four for Mercury Records, which signed her in 1977. Her first album for Mercury, &quot;You&#x27;ve Come a Long Way, Baby&quot;, was released that year; according to &quot;Village Voice&quot; critic Robert Christgau, &quot;using Kudu producer Pee Wee Ellis and the basic Kudu formula—mixing blues and standards and rock with MOR and disco crossovers—she comes up with her most consistent album of the &#x27;70s.&quot;

In 1983, she charted for the final time with &quot;Turn Me Out&quot; which reached number 85 on the R&amp;B chart. She completed recording her final album, &quot;A Way To Say Goodbye&quot; a few months before her death; it was released by the Muse jazz label in 1986.

=== Death ===
Phillips died at UCLA Medical Center in Carson, California, in 1984, at the age of 48, from liver and kidney failure due to long-term drug abuse. Her funeral services were conducted by Johnny Otis.

Originally buried in an unmarked pauper&#x27;s grave at Lincoln Memorial Park in Compton, she was reinterred in 1985 in the Morning Light section at Forest Lawn Memorial Park, Hollywood Hills, in Los Angeles. A bronze marker recognizes her career achievements and quotes a Bible passage: &quot;In My Father&#x27;s House Are Many Mansions&quot; (John 14:2).

<doc id="370656" wikidata="Q871690" url="?curid=370656" title="Gung ho">
<text>Gung ho () is an English term, with the current meaning of &#x27;enthusiastic or energetic&#x27;, especially overly so. It originated during the Second Sino-Japanese War (1937–1945) from a Chinese term, (), short for Chinese Industrial Cooperatives ().

==Overview==
The linguist Albert Moe concluded that the term is an &quot;Americanism that is derived from the Chinese, but its several accepted American meanings have no resemblance whatsoever to the recognized meaning in the original language&quot;, and that its &quot;various linguistic uses, as they have developed in the United States, have been peculiar to American speech&quot;. In Chinese, concludes Moe, &quot;this is neither a slogan nor a battle cry; it is only a name for an organization&quot;. 

The term was picked up by United States Marine Corps Major Evans Carlson from his New Zealand friend, Rewi Alley, one of the founders of the Chinese Industrial Cooperatives. Carlson explained in a 1943 interview: &quot;I was trying to build up the same sort of working spirit I had seen in China where all the soldiers dedicated themselves to one idea and worked together to put that idea over. I told the boys about it again and again. I told them of the motto of the Chinese Cooperatives, &quot;Gung Ho&quot;. It means Work Together — Work in Harmony.&quot; 

Carlson used &quot;gung ho&quot; as a motto during his unconventional command of the 2nd Marine Raider Battalion, leading to other marines adopting the term to mean overly enthusiastic. From there, it spread throughout the U.S. Marine Corps, where it was used as an expression of spirit, and then into American society as a whole when the term was the title of a 1943 war film, &quot;Gung Ho!&quot;, about the 2nd Raider Battalion&#x27;s raid on Makin Island in 1942.

<doc id="370663" wikidata="Q3555708" url="?curid=370663" title="Vera Leigh">
<text>Vera Leigh (17 March 1903 – 6 July 1944) was an agent of the United Kingdom&#x27;s clandestine Special Operations Executive during World War II. 

Leigh was a member of the SOE&#x27;s Donkeyman circuit and Inventor sub-circuit in occupied France until she was arrested by the Gestapo. She was subsequently executed at the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp.

==Early life==

Vera Leigh was born Vera Glass on 17 March 1903 in Leeds, England. She had been abandoned as a baby and adopted while still an infant by H. Eugene Leigh, a well-known American racehorse trainer with an English wife, who renamed his adopted daughter Vera Eugenie Leigh. After Mr Leigh&#x27;s death, his wife married Albert Clark, whose son Victor Alexander Dalzell Clark became Leigh&#x27;s step-brother and friend. When it came necessary to name a next-of-kin, Leigh chose Clark.

Vera grew up around the stables of Maisons Laffitte, the training centre and racing course near Paris. Clark later remembered that, as a child, she wanted to be a jockey when she grew up. In fact, she moved from the world of racing to the equally fashionable one of &quot;haute couture&quot;. After gaining experience as a &quot;vendeuse&quot; at the house of Caroline Reboux, she went into partnership with two friends to found the &quot;grande maison&quot; Rose Valois in the Place Vendôme in 1927, when she was only 24. In the pre-war decade, she moved into the sophisticated social scene of &quot;le Tout Paris&quot;.

==French Resistance==

When Paris fell in 1940, she left for Lyon to join her fiancé of seven years, a man called Charles Sussaix, the managing director of a Portuguese-owned film company. She had intended to find a way, with his help, to get to England, but she became involved with the underground escape lines, guiding fugitive Allied servicemen out of the country, and it was not until 1942 that she herself took the route over the Pyrenees into Spain. As with many who made this journey, Spanish authorities put her in the internment camp at Miranda de Ebro, about 65 kilometres south of Bilbao. Through the efforts of a British embassy official, she was released, and helped to make her way to England via Gibraltar.

==Special Operations Executive==
Leigh arrived in England at the end of 1942, with the intentions of offering her services for the war effort, and was soon identified by SOE. She struck her recruiter as &quot;a smart businesswoman&quot;. The interviewer noted further, &quot;It is clear that commerce is her first allegiance&quot;, but the authorities saw no reason to doubt her motives, while her pre-war life in Paris and her perfect French seemed to make her a natural for the job. She agreed to break off contact with Sussaix and began training.

Her preliminary training report described Leigh as supple, active and keen, confident and capable, &quot;a very satisfactory person to teach&quot; and one with &quot;a very pleasant personality&quot;. Her commandant&#x27;s report said she was &quot;full of guts&quot;, had kept up with the men and was &quot;about the best shot in the party&quot;. He found her &quot;dead keen&quot; and noted that she was greatly respected, had an &quot;equable nature&quot;, and according to him was a &quot;plumb woman for this work&quot;. One of her instructors later remembered that she had a hard time dealing with maps and diagrams, but was &quot;extremely good with her fingers; she could do fiddling jobs with charges and wires and all that remarkably quickly and neatly&quot;. He speculated (correctly) that she might have been connected with the fashion business before the war. &quot;She was very interested in clothes, and hated her hideous khaki uniform&quot;.

Leigh was 40 years old when she returned to France as Ensign Vera Leigh of the FANY, as it was common for such women to be nominally employed by the FANY while actually being SOE agents (as was Andrée Borrel and many other female SOE agents).
Leigh returned to France on 13/14 May 1943, arriving in a Lysander at a field near Tours, and was one of four new arrivals that night who were received by F Section&#x27;s air movements officer, Henri Déricourt. She arrived with Juliane Aisner (an old friend of Déricourt who would be a courier in his pick-up operation codenamed Farrier), Sidney Charles Jones (an organiser and arms instructor) and Marcel Clech (a W/T operator). Leigh was to be a courier and three of them (Leigh, Jones and Clech) were to form a sub-circuit known as Inventor, to work with the Paris-based Prosper circuit, and would later serve as the liaison officer of the Donkeyman circuit. Circuits were also known as networks.

Leigh&#x27;s codename among fellow agents was Simone, and Almoner for radio communications with London; while her assumed identity in France was Suzanne Chavanne, a milliner&#x27;s assistant. With papers in her assumed name, she moved around Paris and as far away as the Ardennes in the northeast, carrying messages from Jones to his various wireless operators and to Henri Frager (who headed a sub-circuit of the Prosper circuit). The reports she sent to her superiors in London were described as &quot;extremely cheerful&quot;. She moved into an apartment in the elegant Sixteenth Arrondissement, made rendezvous routinely at cafés frequented by other agents, and took up life as a Parisienne again. Paris was remarkably calm under the German occupation with life continuing much as it had before despite rationing and the psychological stress many suffered in private, with few acts of resistance due to the savage reprisals the German invaders would inflict in response and the large number of Parisians willing to enrich themselves by becoming informants for the Gestapo. It caused Leigh to be less careful than she should have been, as evidenced by her decision to frequent the same hairdresser she had used before the war.

She came across her sister&#x27;s husband and at first pretended not to know him, then threw her arms around him. This chance encounter led to the discovery that he, too, was involved in clandestine activity for the Allies by hiding fugitive Allied airmen and passing them on to an escape line that would try to get them over the Pyrenees across the frontier into Spain. In her spare time, she began escorting some of these downed fliers, who spoke no French, through the streets from the safe-house to their next point of contact on the escape line.

==Arrest and execution==
===Arrest===

She spent time with SOE agent Aisner in an imposing building in a courtyard off the Place des Ternes from which she ran her husband&#x27;s business, an effective cover for Leigh&#x27;s activity as Déricourt&#x27;s courier. Leigh frequently met other agents at a café on the other side of the Place des Ternes, a short walk from the Place de l&#x27;Étoile in the Seventeenth. It was there in the Chez Mas, on 30 October 1943, in the company of Jones&#x27; bodyguard, that she was arrested. The INVENTOR network had been betrayed by double agent Roger Bardet, and subsequently collapsed. Taken to the Fresnes Prison several kilometres outside Paris, she was registered as Suzanne Chavonne and placed in Cell 410 of the Troisième Section Femmes. She had been taught in training to hold out for 48 hours after capture to give fellow agents a chance to vacate any premises and destroy any records she might be forced to reveal, but is almost certain she had no need to do so. There was nothing her captor didn&#x27;t already know about her activities.

===Moved to Germany===
On 13 May 1944, Leigh together with three other captured female SOE agents, Andrée Borrel, Sonia Olschanezky and Diana Rowden, were moved from Fresnes to the Gestapo&#x27;s Paris headquarters in the Avenue Foch along with four other women whose names were Yolande Beekman, Madeleine Damerment, Eliane Plewman and Odette Sansom, all of whom were F Section agents. Later that day, they were taken to the railway station, and each was handcuffed to a guard upon alighting the train. Sansom, in an interview after the war, said:

We were starting on this journey together in fear, but all of us hoping for something above all that we would remain together. We had all had a taste already of what things could be like, none of us did expect for anything very much, we all knew that they could put us to death. I was the only one officially condemned to death. The others were not. But there is always a fugitive ray of hope that some miracle will take place.

When the women arrived in Germany they were put into separate cells in the prison in Karlsruhe (Justizvollzugsanstalt Karlsruhe). The agents were treated no differently from other prisoners – markedly better than those in concentration camps – and were given manual work to do, peeling potatoes, sewing, etc., which helped pass the time. Occasionally, through the high bars, they could hear Allied bombers headed for targets within Germany, so on the whole, the situation looked promising for them, even if there was the possibility of dying in an air raid. They believed the war was coming closer to an end and they could reasonably expect to be liberated by the Allies before long.

===Execution at Natzweiler-Struthof===

Some time between 5 and 6 a.m on 6 July 1944, not quite two months after their arrival in Karlsruhe, Borrel, Leigh, Olschanezky and Rowden were taken to the reception room, given their personal possessions, and handed over to two Gestapo men who then escorted them 100 kilometres south-west by closed truck to the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp in France, where they arrived around 3:30 p.m. The women&#x27;s arrival was apparently unexpected as was the order by one of the women&#x27;s escorts that the four women were to be executed immediately.

As women were a rarity in the camp, their presence immediately attracted attention from both German guards and prisoners. The four women were led through the center of the camp down to the cellblock at the bottom of the camp by SS men and held there until later that night. &quot;One could see from their appearance that they hadn&#x27;t come from a camp&quot;, said a French prisoner. &quot;They seemed young, they were fairly well groomed, their clothes were not rubbish, their hair was brushed, and each had a case in their (&quot;sic&quot;) hand.&quot; 

The four women were initially together but later put into individual cells. Through the windows, which faced those of the infirmary, they managed to communicate with several prisoners, including a Belgian prisoner, Dr Georges Boogaerts, who passed one of the women (whom he later identified as Borrel from a photograph) cigarettes through the window. Borrel threw him a little tobacco pouch containing some money.

Albert Guérisse, a Belgian army physician who had headed the Pat O&#x27;Leary escape line in Marseille, recognized Borrel as one of his former helpers. He exchanged a few words with another one of the women, who said she was English (Leigh or Rowden) before she disappeared into the cellblock building. At the post-war trial of the men charged with the execution of the four women, Guérisse stated that he was in the infirmary and had seen the women, one by one, being escorted by SS guards from the cellblock (Zellenbau) to the crematorium a few yards away. He told the court: &quot;I saw the four women going to the crematorium, one after the other. One went, and two or three minutes later another went.&quot;

Inside the building housing the crematorium, each woman in turn was told to undress for a medical check and a doctor gave her an injection for what he told one of them was a vaccination against typhus, but was in fact a 10 cc dose of phenol, which the doctor believed was lethal. When the woman became unconscious after the injection, she was inserted into the crematorium oven. Guérrise said, &quot;The next morning, the German prisoner in charge of the crematorium explained to me that each time the door of the oven was opened, the flames came out of the chimney and that meant a body had been put in the oven. I saw the flames four times.&quot; 

The prisoner Guérisse referred to was Franz Berg, who assisted in the crematorium and had stoked the fire that night before being sent back to the room he shared with two other prisoners before the executions. The door was locked from the outside during the executions, but it was possible to see the corridor from a small window above the door, so the prisoner in the highest bunk was able to keep up a running commentary on what he saw. Berg said:

More than one witness talked of a struggle when the fourth woman was shoved into the furnace. According to a Polish prisoner named Walter Schultz, the SS medical orderly (Emil Brüttel) told him the following: &quot;When the last woman was halfway in the oven (she had been put in feet first), she had come to her senses and struggled. As there were sufficient men there, they were able to push her into the oven, but not before she had resisted and scratched [Peter] Straub&#x27;s face.&quot; The next day, Schultz noticed that the face of the camp executioner (Straub) had been severely scratched.

The camp doctor (Werner Rohde) was executed after the war. Franz Berg was sentenced to five years in prison but received the death penalty in another trial for a different crime and was hanged on the same day as Rohde. The camp commandant (Fritz Hartjenstein) received a life sentence, while Straub was sentenced to 13 years in prison.

==Honours and awards==

Leigh posthumously received the King&#x27;s Commendation for Brave Conduct. The concentration camp where she died is a now a French government historical site, where a plaque to Leigh and the three women who died with her is part of the Deportation Memorial on the site. As one of the SOE agents who died for the liberation of her country, Ensign Leigh is listed on the &quot;Roll of Honor&quot; on the Valençay SOE Memorial in the town of Valençay, in the Indre department of France. She is commemorated on the Tempsford Memorial in the village of Tempsford in the county of Bedfordshire in the East of England. A later memorial, the SOE Agents Memorial in Lambeth Palace Road (Westminster, London), is dedicated to all SOE agents. She is also commemorated in column 3 of panel 26 of the Brookwood Memorial as one of 3,500 &quot;to whom war denied a known and honoured grave&quot;.

In 1985, SOE agent and painter Brian Stonehouse, who saw Leigh and the three other female SOE agents at the Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp just before their deaths, painted a poignant watercolour of the four women which now hangs in the Special Forces Club in London.

<text>The Action démocratique du Québec (, &quot;Democratic Action of Quebec&quot;), commonly referred to as the ADQ, was a right-wing populist and conservative provincial political party in Quebec, Canada. On the sovereignty question, it defined itself as autonomist; it had support from nationalists and federalists. Its members were referred to as &quot;adéquistes&quot;, a name derived from the French pronunciation of the initials &#x27;ADQ&#x27;.

The party was founded by dissidents of the Quebec Liberal Party who did not accept the Charlottetown Accord, and first contested the 1994 provincial election, electing Mario Dumont to the National Assembly. Under longtime leader Dumont, the ADQ had a strong showing in the 2007 provincial election, reducing the ruling Quebec Liberal Party (PLQ) to a minority government and relegating the Parti Québécois (PQ) to third place. The ADQ won 41 seats with 31% of the popular vote to serve as the Official Opposition in the National Assembly. However, the ADQ&#x27;s popularity declined significantly soon afterward and in the 2008 provincial elections, the party failed to secure at least twenty percent of the popular vote or twelve Members of the National Assembly (MNAs) in the last election, and consequently lost official party status, though in early 2009 it was recognised as an official party by the PLQ and the PQ.

On 21 January 2012, the membership approved a merger with the Coalition Avenir Québec. The merger was recognised by the Directeur général des élections du Québec on 14 February 2012.

==History==
===Foundation and first decade: 1994–2002===

The party was formed in 1994 by a group of nationalists, known as &quot;les allairistes&quot;, that supported the Allaire Report, a document that advocated a decentralized federal system in which the provincial Government of Quebec would have significantly increased powers.

After the failure of the Meech Lake Accord, which made many Québécois feel rejected by the rest of Canada, the Liberals adopted the Allaire Report as their constitutional policy. However, the party later chose the Charlottetown Accord over the Allaire Report in 1992. The Charlottetown Accord would have recognized Quebec as a &quot;distinct society&quot; within Canada, but consisted of a much milder reform of the Canadian federal system. While most Liberals supported the Charlottetown Accord, a number of them opposed it and quit the party.

Led by Jean Allaire, an attorney from Laval and author of the Allaire Report, and Mario Dumont, a rising political star who had been President of the Liberal Youth Commission, the dissidents founded the ADQ. Allaire became the first party leader, but resigned within a few months for health reasons. He was succeeded by Mario Dumont, who retained the leadership until early 2009.

Shortly before the 1994 provincial election, Yvon Lafrance, a one-term Liberal backbencher who served under Premier Robert Bourassa, switched parties to join the ADQ, becoming the party&#x27;s first sitting member of the legislature. In the ensuing election campaign, Dumont took part in the televised leaders debate and was elected as an MNA, but could not expand his electoral support significantly enough to get other party members elected. For the next eight years, he was the ADQ&#x27;s lone MNA.

In the 1995 Quebec referendum on the Parti Québécois government&#x27;s proposals for sovereignty, Dumont campaigned for the &quot;Yes&quot; side, in favour of the sovereignty option. However, in subsequent election campaigns, he has promised a moratorium on the sovereignty question, which earned him accusations of not having a clear and honest stand on the constitution question.

Although Dumont was a very popular leader, support for the ADQ always lagged well behind him. In fact, for many years, the ADQ tried to capitalize on Dumont&#x27;s personal popularity by using the official name &quot;Action démocratique du Québec-Équipe Mario Dumont&quot; (&quot;Action démocratique du Québec-Team Mario Dumont&quot;).

===Rise: 2002===
In April and June 2002, voter dissatisfaction with both the Parti Québécois (PQ) government of Bernard Landry and the Liberal alternative presented by Jean Charest led the ADQ to an unexpected victory in a series of by-elections, bringing the party caucus to five members.

After the by-election wins, the ADQ soared in popularity, leading the established parties in public opinion polling for the first time in its existence. For a brief period, a number of political analysts predicted that the ADQ could gather as much as 42% of the vote and more than 80 seats in the National Assembly, which would have been enough for a strong majority.

The increased popularity of the party provided the ADQ with larger grassroots support, more money and star candidates for the subsequent election. Dumont, who was able to recruit Beauce businessman Marcel Dutil, chairman of Groupe Canam Inc. as director of the ADQ&#x27;s fund-raising activities, was considered as a serious candidate for the office of Premier of Quebec for the first time.

===Retreat: 2002–2003===
As a result of the ADQ attaining greater popular support, its political opponents conducted negative campaigning against the ADQ for the first time. Those efforts were successful in damaging the public perception of the party. Moreover, the party&#x27;s repeated backtracking on its various policies, including a flat rate income tax of 20 per cent, may have appeared opportunist and harmed the party&#x27;s image as a viable alternative. It was also revealed that a close advisor of Mario Dumont had a criminal record, which prompted the media to question Dumont&#x27;s judgment.

The popularity of the ADQ declined. Dumont did not make any major mistake during the televised leaders&#x27; debate, but did not deliver the outstanding performance he needed to gain momentum. By contrast, Quebec Liberal leader Jean Charest was able to put Bernard Landry of the Parti Québécois on the defensive.

The ADQ received 18% of the vote at the 2003 provincial election. All ADQ incumbents and star candidates, except Dumont, were defeated. The losses were compensated by the election of three new ADQ MNAs, who were still unknown at the provincial level but were well established in their communities. The ADQ drew enough votes from previous PQ supporters to give the victory to Jean Charest&#x27;s Liberals, but did not make a significant breakthrough in the National Assembly.

===Resurgence: 2003–2007===
In the months that followed the election, the ADQ benefited from anger over the decision of the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) not to renew the license of Quebec City radio station CHOI-FM. Radio host Jeff Fillion urged listeners to vote for ADQ candidate Sylvain Légaré in a by-election for the local district of Vanier. Légaré defended the station&#x27;s freedom of speech and was elected on September 20, 2004, which raised the number of ADQ seats back to five.

A few days later, the ADQ held a convention in Drummondville, where its members adopted the new constitutional position of the ADQ, which was labeled as &quot;autonomist&quot; without much precision on what it actually means. ADQ members also elected ex-Liberal minister Yvon Picotte as President of the ADQ, a job previously held by political analyst Guy Laforest.

In the January 2006 federal election, ten Conservative Members of Parliament were elected in Quebec, at the federal level. Four of those newly elected federal Members of Parliament – Maxime Bernier, Steven Blaney, Jacques Gourde and Josée Verner – came from districts represented by ADQ members at the provincial level. All except Bernier were at one point ADQ activists. Blaney was ADQ candidate in Beauce-Nord in 1998. This breakthrough prepared the ground the subsequent growth of the ADQ, which could rely on a number of supporters from the modest Conservatives&#x27; organization in Quebec.

In May 2006, the ADQ held a general council () in Granby, where Dumont brought up the subject of having the current federal Conservative government broach the subject of a new round of constitutional talks in order to get Quebec to finally sign the Constitution.

Embarrassing comments were made by party president Yvon Picotte about PQ Leader André Boisclair. Boisclair had decided not to run in a by-election for the district of Sainte-Marie–Saint-Jacques in Montreal, the district where he lives and which includes Montreal&#x27;s Gay Village. Accusing Boisclair of being a coward, Picotte jokingly said that the riding would fit Boisclair, who is openly gay, like a glove (&quot;comme un gant&quot;). Many journalists criticized Picotte, saying his comment sounded homophobic. Within days, Picotte apologized.

In November 2006, the ADQ held its sixth party convention. The next month, it adopted its platform for the 2007 election, entitled &quot;A Plan A for Quebec&quot; (&quot;Un plan A pour le Québec&quot;) and defined its stance on the controversial reasonable accommodation debate, which was well received by a substantial number of voters.

===2007 provincial election ===

When the 2007 election campaign started, the ADQ was running only a few candidates with widespread name recognition and lacked the financial resources its rivals (especially the Liberals) had. Marcel Dutil announced that even though he likes Dumont, he would vote strategically in favour of the Liberals.

However, polls showed that the ADQ had the potential to significantly increase its representation in the National Assembly. Dumont ran an effective campaign, unveiling one plank from his electoral platform every day and therefore benefiting from sustained attention from his opponents and the media.

Dumont&#x27;s performance had its own setbacks, however, as it led to more scrutiny of the ADQ.

The Liberals criticized the ADQ&#x27;s financial plan as vague and unrealistic, accusing Dumont of underestimating its total cost. According to them, the ADQ&#x27;s promises totaled $6.3 billion rather than the $1.7 billion announced by Dumont.

Besides, many journalists accused the ADQ of being a one-man show. Two candidates, who had made inappropriate comments, were dropped by the party from the election.

On election day, the ADQ made a surprisingly strong showing. It took 21 seats from the Quebec Liberal Party and 15 seats from the PQ. All five ADQ incumbents were re-elected, for a total of 41 seats. (The election of so many legislators without prior parliamentary experience led cartoonist Serge Chapleau to portray the ADQ MNAs as elementary school kids with Dumont as their teacher.) The reigning Liberals were reduced to a minority government, with only 48 MNAs.

For the first time, the ADQ received a plurality of the popular vote among Francophones and formed the official opposition.

Nonetheless, it failed to take a single seat on the island of Montreal, but it did come second in many of the city&#x27;s ridings.

===Official Opposition===
The ADQ MNAs and supporters met in Victoriaville in late September 2007 to detail the party&#x27;s environmental policy. Former PQ Cabinet Member Jean Garon, former Hydro-Québec CEO André Caillé and environmental activist Steven Guilbeault attended the convention. Tom Pentefountas, a former ADQ candidate in the district of Nelligan in a 2004 by-election, succeeded Gilles Taillon as President of the party. Pentefountas enjoys little name recognition among voters in general, but he is a member of the Greek community and lives in Montreal. ADQ supporters hope that his profile might facilitate the party&#x27;s attempts to connect with these constituencies.

During the year that followed the 2007 election, a number of ADQ members such as Éric Caire, Gilles Taillon and especially Sébastien Proulx emerged as effective and articulate legislators. Nonetheless, according to journalist Gilbert Lavoie, the more experienced PQ caucus was better able to position itself as the best alternative to Jean Charest&#x27;s Liberals. Political observers made unflattering comments about the ADQ&#x27;s performance, and political support for the party seemed to lose momentum again. The ADQ suffered a major setback in 2008, losing four consecutive by-elections by substantial margins. Its support did not exceed 15% in any of the districts at stake. Furthermore, MNAs Pierre-Michel Auger and André Riedl, as well as power broker Yvon Picotte, switched political affiliation from ADQ to Liberal in October 2008.

====2008 federal election ====

ADQ Leader Mario Dumont made no official endorsement in the 2008 federal election. He said that he would vote Conservative, but claimed that his colleagues and party&#x27;s supporters were free to support whoever they wanted. MNAs Pierre Gingras, Ginette Grandmont, Linda Lapointe, Lucie Leblanc and Sébastien Proulx campaigned on behalf of the Conservative Party of Canada&#x27;s candidates. Yet, the election provided no increase in membership for Quebec&#x27;s Conservative delegation to Parliament.

===2008 provincial election ===

Quebec premier Jean Charest subsequently called a snap election for December 8, 2008. Polls indicated that the ADQ entered the campaign far behind the governing Liberals and the PQ.

The party was routed in this election, falling to seven seats, six of whom were incumbents. This was five seats short of official status in the legislature. While giving his concession speech, Dumont announced that he would not be the leader of his party for the subsequent election.

While political commentators wondered whether the ADQ would survive Dumont&#x27;s departure, there were three candidates for the 2009 leadership election. On February 27, 2009, Sylvie Roy was named the interim leader of the party.

===By-election loss of Dumont&#x27;s seat===
The ADQ candidate came in third place in a June 21, 2009 by-election to fill the Rivière-du-Loup seat that Dumont vacated when he resigned from the National Assembly. Dumont had held the seat for 14 years; he had carried it in the 2008 provincial election with over 50% of the vote, compared to the less than 15% garnered by ADQ candidate Gilberte Côté. The loss reduced the ADQ to six seats in the National Assembly.

===2009 leadership elections===
In 2009, MNA Éric Caire, former MNA and former party president Gilles Taillon, and former MNA Christian Lévesque ran for the party leadership to succeed Dumont. MNA François Bonnardel also considered entering the contest, but decided to manage Taillon&#x27;s campaign. Myriam Taschereau, a former federal Conservative candidate, and director of communications in the Prime Minister&#x27;s Office, had also declared she would run, but later withdrew and endorsed Caire.

On October 18, 2009, Taillon was elected leader on the second ballot by the slim margin of 50.03% of ballots cast, two votes more than runner-up Caire. Lévesque had been eliminated after finishing third on the first ballot.

On November 6, 2009, Caire and supporter Marc Picard left the party, alleging that the party organization lacked transparency and that Taillon had a dictatorial style of leadership. They resigned from caucus to sit as independents. This reduced the size of the ADQ caucus to four seats in the National Assembly.

On November 10, 2009, 23 days after his election as party leader, Taillon announced a new leadership election, citing the party infighting and alleging irregularities in the party&#x27;s financial affairs, dating back to 2003, which he had called in the Sûreté du Québec to investigate. It was later revealed that he never contacted the Sûreté du Québec. He then explained that he would remain the leader until the results of a new leadership election, in which he would not be a candidate. Caire said he would not run again for the party leadership, adding &quot;Mr. Taillon has done irreparable damage to the ADQ... I don&#x27;t know how the party will recover from this. I can&#x27;t see the party going through a second leadership race. The last one almost destroyed us.&quot;

On November 19, 2009, the party executive acclaimed Gérard Deltell as the party&#x27;s leader. After Deltell assumed the leadership, the party enjoyed a modest rebound, rising from 5% in the polls in spring 2010 to 15% by the end of the year, and enjoying a substantial lead in the Quebec City region. The party maintained the level of support it had had in the 2008 election in the by-elections held in Saint-Laurent and Kamouraska-Temiscouata in fall 2010. The ADQ held a convention on November 13, 2010, adopting a number of proposals dealing with democratic reform and anti-corruption measures. Deltell received a 97% vote of confidence from the party membership and received considerable attention when, in his opening address, he referred to Premier Jean Charest as the &quot;godfather of the Liberal family&quot;. Charest threatened legal action if the statement was not retracted. Deltell refused to apologize or issue a retraction and no action was taken.

===2012 dissolution and merger===
After Deltell took over the leadership, the party recovered from its precarious position, to a solid 18 percent of support in the opinion polls. The ADQ recovery was at the expense of the Liberals because of Charest&#x27;s unpopularity; after that, Charest recovered, but the ADQ benefited from a loss of support for the PQ following the collapse of the Bloc Québécois on the federal stage and internal dissent.

After former PQ minister François Legault established a new movement called the Coalition pour l&#x27;avenir du Québec in February 2011, as an alternative to the sovereignty movement, there were calls for the ADQ to merge with it because of their similar policies. Polls suggested the new movement would win a plurality of seats at the next election with 35 percent, with the ADQ taking eight percent if they did not merge. On 14 November 2011, Legault officially launched the movement as a new political party under the slightly modified name of Coalition Avenir Québec (CAQ).

On December 14, 2011, the ADQ announced it had agreed to merge with the CAQ, pending final approval from the party membership. On January 21, 2012, the ADQ membership approved the merger of their party with the CAQ, with 70% of the party membership voting to merge. The remaining ADQ MNAs, all of which supported the merger, were expected to join the larger CAQ caucus in the National Assembly, increasing the CAQ caucus size to nine members and increasing the pressure on Charest to call an election. On 22 January 2012, the results of the mail-in vote were announced, with 70% of ADQ members approving the merger with the CAQ. In mid-December, after the parties had agreed in principle to merge, two former ADQ MNAs who had left to sit as independents joined the CAQ.

The four MNAs where were still members of the ADQ at the party&#x27;s dissolution–Deltell, Sylvie Roy, Janvier Grondin and Francois Bonnardel–joined the existing five person CAQ caucus which was made up of other former ADQ and PQ MNAs.

Deltell served as the CAQ&#x27;s parliamentary leader until Legault returned to the legislature in 2012. As of 2018, Bonnardel, Caire and Picard are the last parliamentary survivors of the ADQ. Bonnardel was elected in the ADQ&#x27;s 2007 surge and joined Legault&#x27;s cabinet when the CAQ won government at the 2018 election, while Picard joined the CAQ in 2011 after two years as an independent.

==Ideology==
The ADQ advocated liberal economics reforms, or neoliberalism, coupled with support for increased autonomy for Quebec deriving from Quebec nationalism. On the political spectrum of Quebec, the ADQ was to the political right of the Quebec Liberal Party and the Parti Québécois. The ADQ advocated the autonomy of individuals, the autonomy of municipal governments, and the autonomy of Quebec within Canada.

*Fiscal Responsibility: reducing government spending by scaling back Quebec&#x27;s civil service, in order to balance the budget and pay the provincial debt;
*Education: lifting freezes on college tuition and abolishing school boards;
*Electoral reform: implementing an election reform in which the Premier of Quebec would be elected by popular vote (i.e., a presidential government) and 50 of Quebec&#x27;s 125 legislature seats would be determined by proportional representation;
*Health care: encouraging private healthcare delivery, in order to reduce the burden on Quebec&#x27;s public healthcare system;
*Immigration: &quot;reasonable accommodation&quot; granted to immigrants, preventing cultural communities from interfering with a number of mainstream values of the Quebec society, such as women&#x27;s rights;
*Labour: erasing mandatory dues for nonmembers of trade union and forcing the secret vote;
*Relations with the Federal Government: re-opening constitutional talks and increasing Quebec&#x27;s autonomy within Canada, without holding another Quebec referendum;
*Tax Reform: extensively restructuring the Quebec tax system, and lowering taxes overall.

In later years, the ADQ abandoned a number of radical free market proposals, including issuing school vouchers to give parents the ability to pay for the education of their children at a school of their choice. Furthermore, the ADQ&#x27;s conservatism was not based on religious values.

==Electoral support==
Socially and geographically, the core support of the ADQ was similar to that of the Ralliement créditiste, the provincial wing of the Social Credit Party in the 1962, and 1963 federal elections and the 1970 provincial election, the Union Nationale in the 1976 provincial election and the Conservative Party of Canada in 2006 federal election.

Its strongest base was provided by Chaudière-Appalaches and Québec, the most conservative regions of Quebec. The party&#x27;s popularity also reached other predominantly French-speaking areas of the province, including Mauricie, Bas-Saint-Laurent, Centre-du-Québec and even Montérégie in the 2007 provincial election.

However, the ADQ had more difficulty breaking through in Gaspésie–Îles-de-la-Madeleine, Outaouais and the more cosmopolitan urban districts of the Montreal area.

Because of the polarization of the debate over constitution from 1970 to 1995, conservative voters often limited their choice between the Quebec Liberal Party or the Parti Québécois. However, a number of commentators claim that resentment of the rest of Quebec against Montreal&#x27;s perceived hegemony, general mistrust towards current office holders, taxpayers&#x27; frustration and constitutional fatigue let a cultural gap in Quebec society become more apparent and provided a window of opportunity for the ADQ to grow.

<doc id="370666" wikidata="Q2055880" url="?curid=370666" title="Passenger ship">
<text>A passenger ship is a merchant ship whose primary function is to carry passengers on the sea. The category does not include cargo vessels which have accommodations for limited numbers of passengers, such as the ubiquitous twelve-passenger freighters once common on the seas in which the transport of passengers is secondary to the carriage of freight. The type does however include many classes of ships designed to transport substantial numbers of passengers as well as freight. Indeed, until recently virtually all ocean liners were able to transport mail, package freight and express, and other cargo in addition to passenger luggage, and were equipped with cargo holds and derricks, kingposts, or other cargo-handling gear for that purpose. Only in more recent ocean liners and in virtually all cruise ships has this cargo capacity been eliminated.

While typically passenger ships are part of the merchant marine, passenger ships have also been used as troopships and often are commissioned as naval ships when used as for that purpose.

== Description ==

&quot;Passenger Ship Types:&quot; Passenger ships include ferries, which are vessels for day to day or overnight short-sea trips moving passengers and vehicles (whether road or rail); ocean liners, which typically are passenger or passenger-cargo vessels transporting passengers and often cargo on longer line voyages; and cruise ships, which often transport passengers on round-trips, in which the trip itself and the attractions of the ship and ports visited are the principal draw.

There are several main types:
# Cruise ships
# Ferries
# Ocean liners

=== Passenger ship types ===

# Cruise ships: For a long time, cruise ships were smaller than the old ocean liners had been, but in the 1980s, this changed when Knut Kloster, the director of Norwegian Caribbean Lines, bought one of the biggest surviving liners, the , and transformed her into a huge cruise ship, which he renamed the SS &quot;Norway&quot;. Her success demonstrated that there was a market for large cruise ships. Successive classes of ever-larger ships were ordered, until the Cunard liner was finally dethroned from her 56-year reign as the largest passenger ship ever built (a dethronement that led to numerous further dethronements from the same position).
# Ferries: They are vessels for day to day or overnight short-sea trips moving passengers and vehicles (whether road or rail). There also exist Cruise ferries, designed for longer routes, lasting from one to a couple of days. They are named such because they tend to include amenities common on cruise ships (pools, discos, spas, etc...)
# Ocean liners: An ocean liner is the traditional form of passenger ship. Once such liners operated on scheduled line voyages to all inhabited parts of the world. With the advent of airliners transporting passengers and specialized cargo vessels hauling freight, line voyages have almost died out. But with their decline came an increase in sea trips for pleasure and fun, and in the latter part of the 20th century ocean liners gave way to cruise ships as the predominant form of large passenger ship containing from hundreds to thousands of people, with the main area of activity changing from the North Atlantic Ocean to the Caribbean Sea.

=== Cruise ships vs. ocean liners ===
Although some ships have characteristics of both types, the design priorities of the two forms are different: ocean liners value speed and traditional luxury while cruise ships value amenities (swimming pools, theaters, ball rooms, casinos, sports facilities, etc.) rather than speed. These priorities produce different designs. In addition, ocean liners typically were built to cross the Atlantic Ocean between Europe and the United States or travel even further to South America or Asia while cruise ships typically serve shorter routes with more stops along coastlines or among various islands.

Both the (&quot;QE2&quot;) (1969) and her successor as Cunard&#x27;s flagship (&quot;QM2&quot;), which entered service in 2004, are of hybrid construction. Like transatlantic ocean liners, they are fast ships and strongly built to withstand the rigors of the North Atlantic in line voyage service, but both ships are also designed to operate as cruise ships, with the amenities expected in that trade. &quot;QM2&quot; was superseded by the of the Royal Caribbean line as the largest passenger ship ever built; however, &quot;QM2&quot; still hold the record for the largest ocean liner. The &quot;Freedom of the Seas&quot; was superseded by the in October 2009.

=== Measures of size ===


Because of changes in historic measurement systems, it is difficult to make meaningful and accurate comparisons of ship sizes. Historically, gross register tonnage (GRT) was a measure of the internal volume of certain enclosed areas of a ship divided into &quot;tons&quot; equivalent to of space. Gross tonnage (GT) is a comparatively new measure, adopted in 1982 to replace GRT. It is calculated based on &quot;the moulded volume of all enclosed spaces of the ship&quot;, and is used to determine things such as a ship&#x27;s manning regulations, safety rules, registration fees, and port dues. It is produced by a mathematical formula, and does not distinguish between mechanical and passenger spaces, and thus is not directly comparable to historic GRT measurements. Displacement, a measure of mass, is not commonly used for passenger vessels. While a high displacement can indicate better sea keeping abilities, gross tonnage is promoted as the most important measure of size for passenger vessels, as the ratio of gross tonnage per passenger – the Passenger/Space Ratio – gives a sense of the spaciousness of a ship, an important consideration in cruise liners where the onboard amenities are of high importance.

Historically, a ship&#x27;s GRT and displacement were somewhat similar in number. For example, &quot;Titanic&quot;, put in service in 1912, had a GRT of 46,328 and a displacement reported at over 52,000 tons. Similarly, Cunard Line&#x27;s mid-1930s and RMS &quot;Queen Elizabeth&quot; were of approximately 81,000 – 83,000 GRT and had displacements of over 80,000 tons.

Today, due to changes in construction, engineering, function, architecture, and, crucially, measurement system – which measures functionally all of a ship&#x27;s internal volume, not just part of it – modern passenger ships&#x27; GT values are much higher than their displacements. The Cunard Queens&#x27; current successor, the 148,528 GT &quot;Queen Mary 2&quot;, has been estimated to only displace approximately 76,000 tons. With the completion in 2009 of the first of the over 225,000 GT cruise ships, &quot;Oasis of the Seas&quot;, passenger ships&#x27; displacements rose to 100,000 tons, well less than half their GT.

This new class is characteristic of an explosive growth in gross tonnage, which has more than doubled from the largest cruise ships of the late 1990s. This reflects the much lower relative weight of enclosed space in the comparatively light superstructure of a ship versus its heavily reinforced and machinery-laden hull space, as cruise ships have grown slab-sided vertically from their maximum beam to accommodate more passengers within a given hull size.

== Safety regulations ==

Passenger ships are subject to two major International Maritime Organization requirements : to perform &quot;musters of the passengers (...) within 24 hours after their embarkation&quot; and to be able to perform full abandonment &quot;within a period of 30 minutes from the time the abandon-ship signal is given&quot;.

Transportation Research Board research from 2019 reported passenger vessels, much more than freight vessels, are subject to degradations in stability as a result of increases in lightship weight. Passenger vessels appear to be more pressing candidates for lightship weight-tracking programs than freight vessels.

===Design considerations===
Passengers on ships without backup generators suffer substantial distress due to lack of water, refrigeration, and sewage systems in the event of loss of the main engines or generators due to fire or other emergency. Power is also unavailable to the crew of the ship to operate electrically powered mechanisms. Lack of an adequate backup system to propel the ship can, in rough seas, render it dead in the water and result in loss of the ship. The 2006 Revised Passenger Ship Safety Standards address these issues, and others, requiring that ships ordered after July, 2010 conform to safe return to port regulations; however, as of 2013 many ships remain in service which lack this capacity.

After October 1, 2010, the International Convention for the Safety of Life at Sea (SOLAS) requires passenger ships operating in international waters must either be constructed or upgraded to exclude combustible materials. It is believed some owners and operators of ships built before 1980, which are required to upgrade or retire their vessels, will be unable to conform to the regulations. Fred. Olsen Cruise Line&#x27;s , built in 1966 was one such ship, but was reported to be headed for inter-island service in Venezuelan waters.

===External safety measures===
The International Ice Patrol was formed in 1914 after the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot; to address the long-outstanding issue of iceberg collision.

===Other regulations===
Passengers and their luggage at sea are covered by the Athens Convention.

<text>A separation barrier or separation wall is a barrier, wall or fence, constructed to limit the movement of people across a certain line or border, or to separate peoples or cultures. A separation barrier that runs along an internationally recognized border is known as a border barrier.

David Henley opines in &quot;The Guardian&quot; that separation barriers are being built at a record-rate around the world along borders and do not only surround dictatorships or pariah states. In 2014, The &quot;Washington Post&quot; listed notable 14 separation walls as of 2011, indicating that the total concurrent number of walls and barriers which separate countries and territories is 45.

The term &quot;separation barrier&quot; has been applied to structures erected in Belfast, Homs, the West Bank, São Paulo, Cyprus, and along the Greece-Turkey border and the Mexico-United States border. In 2016, Julia Sonnevend listed in her book &quot;Stories Without Borders: The Berlin Wall and the Making of a Global Iconic Event&quot; the concurrent separation barriers of Sharm el-Sheikh (Egypt), Limbang border (Brunei), the Kazakh-Uzbekistan barrier, Indian border fence with Bangladesh, United States separation barrier with Mexico, Saudi Arabian border fence with Iraq and Hungary&#x27;s fence with Serbia. Several erected separation barriers are no longer active or in place, including the Berlin Wall, the Maginot Line and some barrier sections in Jerusalem.

==Structures described as &quot;separation barriers&quot; or &quot;separation walls&quot;==
===Australia===
One of the longest separation barriers in the world, the dingo fence is a pest-exclusion fence to keep dingoes out of the relatively fertile south-east part of the continent. In addition, it was initially established so that landowners could lawfully keep Australian Aboriginal people off the land.

Although the fence has helped reduce losses of sheep to predators, this has been countered by holes in fences found in the 1990s through which dingo offspring have passed. Laws were appointed to protect the fence; jail terms of three months for leaving a crossing gate open, and six months for damage or removal of part of the fence. Introduced in 1946, these penalties still apply today.

In 2009 as part of the Q150 celebrations, the dingo fence was announced as one of the Q150 Icons of Queensland for its role as an iconic &quot;innovation and invention&quot;. The fence staff consists of 23 employees, including two-person teams that patrol a section of the fence twice every week.

===Central Europe===
Communities in the Czech Republic, Romania and Slovakia have long built Roma walls in urban environments when a Roma group is in close proximity to the rest of the population.

===Cyprus===


Since the Turkish invasion of Cyprus in 1974, Turkey has constructed and maintained what economics professor Rongxing Guo has called a &quot;separation barrier&quot; of along the 1974 Green Line (or ceasefire line) dividing the island of Cyprus into two parts, with a United Nations buffer zone between them.

===Egypt===
====Egypt-Gaza barrier====
The Egypt–Gaza barrier is often referred as &quot;separation barrier&quot; in the media or as a &quot;separating wall&quot;. In December 2009, Egypt started the construction of the Egypt–Gaza barrier along the border with Gaza, consisting of a steel wall. Egypt&#x27;s foreign minister said that the wall, being built along the country&#x27;s border with the Gaza Strip will defend it &quot;against threats to national security&quot;. Though the construction paused a number of times, the wall is nearly complete.

====Sharm el-Sheikh barrier====
According to Julia Sonnevend, the anti-terrorist barrier around the Sharm el-Sheikh resort in Egypt is in fact a separation barrier.

===India===

The Line of Control (LoC) refers to the military control line between the Indian and Pakistani controlled parts of the former princely state of Kashmir and Jammu—a line which, to this day, does not constitute a legally recognized international boundary, but is the de facto border. Originally known as the &quot;Cease-fire Line&quot;, it was redesignated as the &quot;Line of Control&quot; following the Simla Agreement, which was signed on 3 July 1972. The part of the former princely state that is under Indian control was known as the state of Jammu and Kashmir, which was split into two separate Union Territories. The two parts of the former princely state that are under Pakistani control are known as Gilgit–Baltistan and Azad Kashmir (AJK). Its northernmost point is known as the NJ9842. This territorial division, which to this day still exists, severed many villages and separated family members from each other.

A separation fence construction between Indian and Pakistani controlled areas, based on 1972 cease-fire line, was initiated by India in 2003.
In December 2013, it was revealed that India plans a construction of a separation wall in the Himalayan area in Kashmir. The wall is aimed to cover 179 km.
The other sections of India&#x27;s borders also have a fence or wall.

===Israel===


Israel began building the Israeli West Bank barrier in 2002, in order to protect civilians from Palestinian terrorism such as suicide bombing attacks which increased significantly during the Second Intifada. Barrier opponents claim it seeks to annex Palestinian land under the guise of security and undermines peace negotiations by unilaterally establishing new borders. When completed it will be a 700-kilometres long network of high walls, electronic fences, gates and trenches. It is a controversial barrier because much of it is built outside the 1949 Armistice Line (Green Line), &quot;de facto&quot; annexing potentially 10 percent of Palestinian land, according to the United Nations Office for the Coordination of Humanitarian Affairs. It cuts far into the West Bank and encompasses Israel&#x27;s largest settlement blocs containing hundreds of thousands of settlers.

In June 2004, the Israeli Supreme Court held that building the wall on West Bank Palestinian land is in itself legal, but it ordered some changes to the original route, which separated 35,000 Palestinian farmers from their lands and crops. The Israeli finance minister (Benjamin Netanyahu) replied that it was disputed land, not Palestinian, and its final status would be resolved in political negotiation. In July 2004, the International Court of Justice at The Hague in an advisory opinion declared the barriers illegal under international law and called on Israel to dismantle the walls, return confiscated land and make reparations for damages. In spite of all this, the number of Arab terrorist suicide bombings continued to decrease with the gradual completion of segments of the Security Barrier as was initially stated it would by the Israeli authorities.

Israel refers to land between the 1949 lines and the separation barrier as the Seam Zone, including all of East Jerusalem. In 2003, the military declared that only Israeli citizens and Palestinians with permits are allowed to be inside it; Palestinians have found it increasingly difficult to get permits unless they own land in the zone. The separation barrier cuts off east Jerusalem and some settlement blocs from the West Bank, even as Israelis and Arabs build structures and communities in eastern Jerusalem. Palestinians in the West Bank, including East Jerusalem, have continued to protest the separation barrier.

The existing barrier cuts off access to the Jordan River for Palestinian farmers in the West Bank. Due to international condemnation after the International Court ruling, Israel did not build an even stronger barrier, instead instituting permit-based access control. It has been opined that this change was to allow land to be annexed. Israeli settlement councils already have de facto control of 86 percent of the Jordan Valley and the Dead Sea as the settler population steadily grows there.

===Kuwait===
Writer Damon DiMarco has described as a &quot;separation barrier&quot; the Kuwait-Iraq barricade constructed by the United Nations in 1991 after the Iraqi invasion of Kuwait was repelled. With electrified fencing and concertina wire, it includes a 5-meter-wide trench and a high berm. It runs 180 kilometers along the border between the two nations.

===Lebanon===
A 2016 separation wall around the Ain al-Hilweh camp in Lebanon is intended to separate the local Palestinian-Lebanese population and Syrian refugee Palestinians from the surrounding society.

===Malaysia===
Renee Pirrong of The Heritage Foundation described the Malaysia–Thailand border barrier as a &quot;separation barrier&quot;. Its purpose is to cut down on smuggling, drug trafficking, illegal immigration, crime and insurgency.
===Saudi Arabia===

In 2004 Saudi Arabia began construction of a Saudi-Yemen barrier between its territory and Yemen to prevent the unauthorized movement of people and goods into and out of the Kingdom. Some have labeled it a &quot;separation barrier&quot;. In February 2004 &quot;The Guardian&quot; reported that Yemeni opposition newspapers likened the barrier to the Israeli West Bank barrier, while &quot;The Independent&quot; wrote &quot;Saudi Arabia, one of the most vocal critics in the Arab world of Israel&#x27;s &#x27;security fence&#x27; in the West Bank, is quietly emulating the Israeli example by erecting a barrier along its porous border with Yemen&quot;. Saudi officials rejected the comparison saying it was built to prevent infiltration and smuggling.

Saudi Arabia has also built a wall on the Saudi Iraqi border.

===Turkey===
The Syria–Turkey barrier is a wall and fence under construction along the Syria–Turkey border aimed at preventing illegal crossings and smuggling from Syria into Turkey. In 2017, The Syrian government accused Turkey of building a separation wall, referring to the barrier.

From 2017, Turkey began construction a barrier along the Iran–Turkey border aimed at preventing illegal immigration and smuggling.

===United Kingdom===


Over 21 miles of high walling or fencing separate Catholic and Protestant communities in Northern Ireland, with most concentrated in Belfast and Derry. The wall was built in 1969 in order to separate the Catholic and Protestant areas in Belfast. An Army Major, overseeing the construction of the wall at the time, said: &#x27;This is a temporary measure ... we do not want to see another Berlin wall situation in Western Europe ... it will be gone by Christmas&#x27;. In 2013, that wall still remains and almost 100 additional walls and barriers now complement the original. Technically known as &#x27;peace walls&#x27;, there are moves to remove all of them by 2023 by mutual consent.

===United States===


The United States constructed a barrier on the border with Mexico of to prevent unauthorized immigration into the United States and to deter smuggling of contraband. The US President Trump stated that he would replace the wall with an updated Mexico–United States border wall; some parts of the old wall have been replaced.

The Detroit Wall was erected to enforce redlining as part of the policies of racial segregation in the United States.

===Western Sahara===


Morocco has constructed a 2,700 km (1,700 mi) long sand wall cutting through the length of Western Sahara. Minefields and watchtowers serve to separate the Moroccan-controlled zone from the sparsely populated Free Zone.

==Past separation barriers==

===Germany===
The Berlin Wall was a barrier that divided Berlin from 1961 to 1989, constructed by the German Democratic Republic (GDR, East Germany) starting on 13 August 1961, that completely cut off (by land) West Berlin from surrounding East Germany and from East Berlin until it was opened in November 1989. Its demolition officially began on 13 June 1990 and was completed in 1992. The barrier included guard towers placed along large concrete walls, which circumscribed a wide area (later known as the &quot;death strip&quot;) that contained anti-vehicle trenches, &quot;fakir beds&quot; and other defenses. The Eastern Bloc claimed that the wall was erected to protect its population from fascist elements conspiring to prevent the &quot;will of the people&quot; in building a socialist state in East Germany. In practice, the Wall served to prevent the massive emigration and defection that marked East Germany and the communist Eastern Bloc during the post-World War II period.

The Berlin Wall was officially referred to as the &quot;Anti-Fascist Protection Rampart&quot; () by GDR authorities, implying that the NATO countries and West Germany in particular were &quot;fascists&quot;. The West Berlin city government sometimes referred to it as the &quot;Wall of Shame&quot;—a term coined by mayor Willy Brandt—while condemning the Wall&#x27;s restriction on freedom of movement. Along with the separate and much longer Inner German border (IGB), which demarcated the border between East and West Germany, it came to symbolize the &quot;Iron Curtain&quot; that separated Western Europe and the Eastern Bloc during the Cold War.

Before the Wall&#x27;s erection, 3.5 million East Germans circumvented Eastern Bloc emigration restrictions and defected from the GDR, many by crossing over the border from East Berlin into West Berlin, from where they could then travel to West Germany and other Western European countries. Between 1961 and 1989, the wall prevented almost all such emigration. During this period, around 5,000 people attempted to escape over the wall, with an estimated death toll of from 136 to more than 200 in and around Berlin.

In 1989, a series of radical political changes occurred in the Eastern Bloc, associated with the liberalization of the Eastern Bloc&#x27;s authoritarian systems and the erosion of political power in the pro-Soviet governments in nearby Poland and Hungary. After several weeks of civil unrest, the East German government announced on 9 November 1989 that all GDR citizens could visit West Germany and West Berlin. Crowds of East Germans crossed and climbed onto the wall, joined by West Germans on the other side in a celebratory atmosphere. Over the next few weeks, euphoric people and souvenir hunters chipped away parts of the wall; the governments later used industrial equipment to remove most of what was left. Contrary to popular belief the wall&#x27;s actual demolition did not begin until the summer of 1990 and was not completed until 1992. The fall of the Berlin Wall paved the way for German reunification, which was formally concluded on 3 October 1990.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Vintners, one of the Great Twelve City Livery Companies, retains close links with the wine trade. It traces its origins to the 12th century and received its swan rights from King Edward IV. Its motto is &quot;Vinum Exhilarat Animum&quot;, Latin for &quot;Wine cheers the Spirit&quot;.

== History and origins ==
The vintners of London formed a guild as early as the twelfth century and received their first royal charter in 1363. This granted far-reaching powers including duties of search throughout English dominions and the right to buy herrings and cloth to sell to the Gascons.

This royal charter effectively granted a monopoly over wine imports from Gascony, securing the Company pre-eminence in the wine trade. Ranked eleventh in 1515 when the order of precedence of City Livery Companies was established by King Henry VIII, Queen Mary revoked the Company&#x27;s rights in 1553. Its privileges removed under the Stuarts were restored by William and Mary, but the Company could not recover its former trading dominance in Europe. By 1725 few wine merchants were joining the livery, so the Company finally abandoned claim to the duty of search.

Until 2006, the Vintners&#x27; Company retained autonomous alcohol sale licensing rights in certain areas of England, such as the City of London and along the route of the old Great North Road. Its ancient rights being abolished, limited privileges remain to the livery.

Actively engaged in wine trade education, including the prestigious Master of Wine qualification, the Vintners&#x27; Company supports many charities, including those concerned with treating the effects of alcohol and drug abuse.

In modern days, the organization was criticized for the opaque management of its annual budget.

== Swan upping ==
Since the reign of King Edward IV, the Vintners enjoy a peculiar right of swan upping, whereby swans on the Thames are apportioned among the Crown, the Vintners&#x27; and Dyers&#x27; Companies.

Vintners&#x27; swans are given two nicks to the beak (the Dyers&#x27; have one): hence the Swan with Two Necks, London.

== Vintners&#x27; Hall ==

=== Hall and ceremonial ===
Vinters&#x27; Hall stands on Upper Thames Street in the City of London. It dates from 1671 although very little of the exterior of the 17th-century building survives. The Hall is in Vintry Ward, London EC4. The building was re-faced in the 19th and 20th centuries. It consists of a suite of rooms, including the main hall, court and drawing rooms and a boardroom.

The Vintners elect a new Master annually in July, celebrated by a publication service at the Guild Church of St James Garlickhythe, opposite the livery hall. The procession starts at Vintners&#x27; Hall with the Master and Wardens in Tudor dress carrying nosegays, their path being swept by a Wine Porter using a birch broom.

Sir Lionel Denny, is the Vintner most recently to serve as Lord Mayor of London, and elected Master Vintner for 2023/24 is Anthony (Ant) Fairbank.

Every region of France is usually represented at award events, in the name of the Entente Cordiale. The Hall&#x27;s cellar (Red Cellar) can contain 16,000 bottles.

=== In popular culture ===
* The music video of Liberty X&#x27;s 2002 smash hit &quot;Just a Little&quot; was filmed at Vintners&#x27; Hall, featuring a gang of professional burglars (with two of its members, Jessica Taylor and Kelli Young, in tight black latex catsuits) stealing a diamond from the building&#x27;s atrium.
* Vintners&#x27; Hall also features in Mimi Webb&#x27;s 2022 music hit video &quot;Ghost of You&quot;.

<doc id="370688" wikidata="Q142386" url="?curid=370688" title="Saint-Tite">
<text>Saint-Tite () is a Canadian city located at the foothills of the Laurentians, between Grandes-Piles and Saint-Adelphe, in the Mauricie RCM of Mékinac. A large body of water, Lake Pierre-Paul, bathes the northeastern part of the territory.&#x27; 

The name of the parish of Saint-Tite is attested in 1859 and was established thanks to the canonical and civil election that occurred in 1863 following its detachment from Sainte-Anne-de-la-Pérade and Saint-Stanislas de-la-Rivière-des-Envies. The post office, opened in 1859, and the parish municipality, established in 1863, took over the parish name that celebrates a companion of St. Paul the Apostle, who converted him in the first century by entrusting him with the task of organizing the Church of Ephesus.

==History==
The first real inhabitants of the area were Indigenous peoples of the Americas – Algonquins, Innu and Métis – who lived near Lake Kapibouska.
Indigenous peoples of the Americas. The small settlement of Saint-Juste-de Kapibouska took the name of Saint-Tite at the end of the 1850. Small Indigenous and Métis communities lived in makeshift camps whose permanence or duration depended on the availability of hunting, fishing, the quality of the soil to be cultivated, as many also did some gardening, and the fur trade. All French attempts to settle the Algonquins had failed.&lt;br&gt;

Mission. The Saint-Juste de Kapibouska mission was set up for the Aboriginal people living at Kapibouska Lake. At the beginning of the 19th century, missionaries visited the territory.&lt;br&gt;

Pioneers. In the early 1830s, lumber yards were booming on the Rivière des Envies. The first settler of French-Canadian origin settled around 1833 in the area of the future city of Saint-Tite. Over time, several other pioneers were established.&lt;br&gt;

Apart from the missionaries&#x27; visits, the settlers had to travel several kilometers to reach the church of St. Stanislaus. The first chapel-presbytery was built in the 1850s. The first resident priest arrived in 1859.&lt;br&gt;

Easter water. From the beginning of colonization, it is likely that gathering Easter water was a common practice among members of the Christian community. In 1995, the first organized harvest and the blessing of Easter water took place at the Curé Boutet spring. The faithful get their feet wet, get dirty with mud, some fall on patches of ice. Safety and accessibility are the reasons for the construction of temporary sets. Today, throughout Quebec, this practice has become increasingly rare, becoming a social gathering or even a tourist activity.
On Easter Sunday, we will have the celebration of Easter water at 4:30 a.m. before sunrise at the Curé spring at the end of Rue du Couvent. Afterwards, we will gather as a big family for a fraternal lunch at the Seniors&#x27; Club room around 5:30 am (Breakfast with baked beans, maple syrup and bread rolls, served by members of the Pastoral Council, free of charge).&lt;br&gt;

Railway Fever 1878: The vast territory north of the St. Lawrence Plain, with its opening onto the immensity of the Canadian Shield, evokes grandiose dreams. In 1878, St. Laurence, Lower Laurentian &amp; Saguenay obtained permission to build a track between Trois-Rivières and Saguenay-Lac-Saint-Jean via Saint-Tite.&lt;br&gt;
Note: &quot;Kapibouska&quot;: of Algonquian origin, this name means &quot;place of camp where there are reeds&quot;, kapi, &quot;place of camp&quot;, baska or bouska &quot;rushes&quot;, &quot;reeds&quot;.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms of the city was adopted in 1954 by the city council.

The coat of arms of Saint-Tite is blazoned thus:
Greek cross gules a chief azure point, flanked by a toothed wheel segment money dexter and a gear segment sinister gold, containing a skin tight leather gold dextral and sinistral spruce money, overcoming mountains of sand placed on a terrace or charged with a blue river.

==Arts and culture==
The city of Saint-Tite is particularly known for the Festival Western de Saint-Tite, which takes place for 10 days in September every year. The Festival Western de Saint-Tite was developed from a rodeo inaugurated in 1967 to promote the leather industry. The Festival Western de Saint-Tite is the largest Western attraction in Eastern Canada. This festival of Eastern style, under the epithet Western, has an international reputation. The festival&#x27;s success has led to the remodeling of some of the town&#x27;s infrastructures to resemble a western frontier town of the late nineteenth or early twentieth centuries. Since 1999, the Rodeo of Festival Western de Saint-Tite is awarded as the &quot;Best outdoor rodeo in Americas&quot;. The festival features a variety of activities that take place at a rate of horsemen and the sound of country music and in Eastern decor: competition, conference, parade, tasting, demonstrations, exhibitions, shows, etc... The horsemen and women can participate in various tests of skill on horseback or on wild bull (with or without a saddle). They can participate in speed events, such as steer roping, or skill tests, such as barrel racing. During the 10 days of the Festival, several events take place in the various marquees erected around the city or at the Country Club Desjardins, a site that looks like a typical western town. The festival is marked by a country western character. The &quot;Galaxie Rising Star Award&quot; awarded at the Festival contributes to the development of musical talent in the country western area.

Saint-Tite is an important part of the novel Les Filles de Caleb (Caleb&#x27;s daughters), written by novelist Arlette Cousture. The backstory of this novel is based on the life of Émilie Bordeleau, a country school teacher who taught and lived with her children in schools in the area.

<text>Try This is the third studio album by American singer Pink, released on November 11, 2003, by Arista Records. Wanting to expand more on the rock sound, which she explored on her previous record, &quot;Missundaztood&quot;, for &quot;Try This&quot; Pink collaborated with punk band Rancid&#x27;s singer and guitarist Tim Armstrong, and reunited with Linda Perry, who produced most of the &quot;Missundaztood&quot; album. As a result of this collaboration, &quot;Try This&quot; is a rock and roll and pop record, with lyrics exploring such themes as love and estrangement.

&quot;Try This&quot; received generally favorable reviews from music critics. However, retrospectively Pink herself expressed dissatisfaction with the record. She said that she was unhappy with the way the label wanted her to make an album after the success of &quot;M!ssundaztood&quot;. Commercially, the album was moderately successful, reaching the top ten in 13 countries, including the US, where it peaked at number nine on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Internationally, the album also fared quite well, peaking at number three in the UK, and number eight in Canada. It was certified Platinum in the US by the RIAA for shipments of over one million copies. 

Three singles were released from the album. The lead single, &quot;Trouble&quot;, reached the top ten in Australia, Canada, the UK, and many European countries. &quot;Trouble&quot; earned Pink her second Grammy Award, for Best Female Rock Vocal Performance at the 2004 Grammy Awards. &quot;God Is a DJ&quot; and &quot;Last to Know&quot;, the second and third singles from the album respectively, were modestly successful in European charts. However, all of the singles from &quot;Try This&quot; failed to garner much success in the US. Some of the album pressings also included the single &quot;Feel Good Time&quot; from the soundtrack for the movie &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle.&quot; Pink supported the album with her Try This Tour in 2004, which performed across Europe and Australia. The live recording of the Manchester show was released in 2006, titled &quot;&quot;.

==Background and composition==
After the success of &quot;Missundaztood&quot; (2001) and its accompanying worldwide &quot;Party Tour&quot;, Pink began work on her third studio album. Wanting to expand more on the rock sound she explored with &quot;Missundaztood&quot;, Pink sought out producers and writers that had experience within the genre. Most of the tracks on &quot;Try This&quot; were produced and co-written by punk band Rancid singer and guitarist Tim Armstrong, whom Pink met through a mutual friend at a Transplants video shoot. The two hit it off and Pink ended up co-writing ten songs with him in a week when Transplants were on a tour with the Foo Fighters. Eight of these tracks appeared on &quot;Try This&quot;, which also features three songs written with Linda Perry, who co-wrote much of &quot;Missundaztood&quot;, Pink&#x27;s second album. The album includes a collaboration with electroclash artist Peaches, &quot;Oh My God&quot;, and Pink&#x27;s contribution to the &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels: Full Throttle&quot; film soundtrack, &quot;Feel Good Time&quot; (produced by and featuring William Orbit), as a non-U.S. bonus track.

&quot;Try This&quot; was Pink&#x27;s final studio album under Arista Records. In 2006, Pink said that she was unhappy with the way the label wanted her to make an album after the success of &quot;M!ssundaztood&quot;. &quot;I was kind of rebelling against the label on that one,&quot; she said. &quot;I was going: &#x27;You want a record? Fine, I&#x27;ll write 10 songs in a week for your fuckin&#x27; record and you can press it up and put it out.&#x27;&quot; She described the promotional campaign for the album as &quot;an awful time. I was walking out of half my interviews crying. I just felt they were putting a quarter in the slot to watch the monkey dance.&quot; &quot;Try This&quot; is Pink&#x27;s first album to carry a Parental Advisory warning, and therefore her first album released alongside an edited version. The font used throughout the album&#x27;s artwork is the same that was used for then label-mates Ace of Base&#x27;s &quot;Cruel Summer&quot; single.

Musically, &quot;Try This&quot; is a pop/rock &amp; roll album, which incorporates elements of punk rock (&quot;Trouble&quot;), R&amp;B (&quot;Catch Me While I&#x27;m Sleeping&quot;, &quot;Love Song&quot;), new wave and disco (&quot;Humble Neighborhoods&quot;).

== Promotion ==

=== Singles ===
The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Trouble&quot;, a song Armstrong original wrote for his band Rancid in 2003, reached number two in Canada and the top ten in the UK and Australia, but it peaked only at number 68 on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. In 2003, &quot;Catch Me While I&#x27;m Sleeping&quot; was issued as a promotional single in the U.S.; in the same period, a promo CD-R acetate of &quot;Humble Neighborhoods&quot; was made available in the UK. Follow-up single &quot;God Is a DJ&quot; failed to chart on the Hot 100, although it reached number 11 in the UK. A third single, &quot;Last to Know&quot;, was released exclusively in Europe and peaked at 21 in the UK.

=== Tour ===

Pink embarked on the Try This Tour in Europe during 2004, and a DVD chronicling the tour was released in 2006. &quot;Trouble&quot; was used in the films &quot;White Chicks&quot; (2004), &quot;The Princess Diaries 2: Royal Engagement&quot; (2004) and &quot;Miss Congeniality 2: Armed and Fabulous&quot; (2005) as well as the first theatrical trailer for &quot;Tangled&quot;, and &quot;God Is a DJ&quot; was featured in the film &quot;Mean Girls&quot; (2004).

==Critical reception==
The album received almost entirely positive reviews from critics, with an average Metacritic rating of 71, indicating &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot;. AllMusic editor Stephen Thomas Erlewine rated the album four out of five stars. He found that &quot;with &quot;Try This&quot;, Pink has firmly established a voice of her own, and in doing so, she&#x27;s made another tremendous modern pop record.&quot; &quot;Blender&quot; critic James Slaughter felt that &quot;with her third album, Pink has smartly navigated a way to be heard over the mass moaning that has followed her [...] The guitars are raunchier, the lyrics more potty-mouthed [but] the music never loses its melodic touch, whether essaying the gutsy rock or glossy Philly R&amp;B balladry.&quot; Nick Catucci from &quot;The Village Voice&quot; noted that the album &quot;dares Pink&#x27;s huge but hardly guaranteed audience to hear the world her way — without wasting one moment on indulgent experimentation, rote grandstanding, or retreats into conformism [...]&quot; Assisted by soft crusty-punk Tim Armstrong, &quot;Try This&quot; is a rare leap of faith — a miracle of pop.&quot;

David Browne, writing for &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot;, gave the album a positive review and called it &quot;A hooky, engaging throwaway that expands Pink&#x27;s range while holding on fiercely to her irascible inner child.&quot; However, he was less impressed with Perry&#x27;s contributions on &quot;Try This&quot;, further noting: &quot;Maybe Pink isn&#x27;t very different from her teen-pop refugees: She&#x27;s a rebel only to a point, and she&#x27;s more than willing to compromise her rawness for crossover pop success. Yet while her peers struggle to grime themselves up, Pink and her exuberantly junky pop still stand head and bustier above the rest.&quot; However, there were some negative reviews, with Ethan Brown from &quot;New York&quot; magazine stating that &quot;Pink pitches a brand of seriousness that is pure Lifetime-TV mawkishness,&quot; while Alexis Petridis from &quot;The Guardian&quot; commented that &quot;Like a lot of pop at the moment, it just sounds like a wan imitation of Pink&#x27;s second album.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
&quot;Try This&quot; debuted at number nine on the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 with first-week sales of 147,000 copies, a weaker debut than that of &quot;Missundaztood&quot;. The album also reached the top ten on album charts in the UK, Canada and Australia. As of March 2007, it had sold 719,000 copies in the U.S. according to Nielsen SoundScan. &quot;Try This&quot; re-entered the Australian album chart in June 2009.

<doc id="370701" wikidata="Q1187053" url="?curid=370701" title="Tie-in">
<text>A tie-in work is a work of fiction or other product based on a media property such as a film, video game, television series, board game, website, role-playing game or literary property. Tie-ins are authorized by the owners of the original property, and are a form of cross-promotion used primarily to generate additional income from that property and to promote its visibility.

== Types ==

Common tie-in products include literary works, which may be novelizations of a media property, original novels or story collections inspired by the property, or republished previously existing books, such as the novels on which a media property was based, with artwork or photographs from the property. According to publishing industry estimates, about one or two percent of the audience of a film will buy its novelization, making these relatively inexpensively produced works a commercially attractive proposition in the case of blockbuster film franchises. Although increasingly also a domain of previously established novelists, tie-in writing has the disadvantages, from the writers&#x27; point of view, of modest pay, tight deadlines and no ownership in the intellectual property created.

Tie-in products may also have a documentary or supplemental character, such as &quot;making-of&quot; books documenting the creation of a media property. Tie-in products also include other types of works based on the media property, such as soundtrack recordings, video games, or merchandise including toys and clothing.

===Novelizations===

A novelization is a derivative novel that adapts the story of a work created for another medium, such as a film, TV series, comic strip or video game. Film novelizations were particularly popular before the invention of home video, but continue to find commercial success as part of marketing campaigns for major films. They are often written by accomplished writers based on an early draft of the film&#x27;s script and on a tight deadline.

===Rebranding of previously published work===
Tie-in books are sometimes reprints of novels rebranded to tie in with their film adaptation. As an example, after Roderick Thorp&#x27;s 1979 novel &quot;Nothing Lasts Forever&quot; was adapted into the 1988 film &quot;Die Hard&quot;, it was retitled &quot;Die Hard&quot; with the film&#x27;s poster on the cover. The Philip K. Dick novel &quot;Do Androids Dream of Electric Sheep?&quot; was similarly republished to tie in with &quot;Blade Runner&quot;, the film loosely based on the book.

A tie-in book linked to a film based on short fiction may be published featuring the adapted story, as well as other stories from the same author; for example, while Stephen King&#x27;s novella &quot;Apt Pupil&quot; was adapted to the eponymous film, King&#x27;s collection &quot;Different Seasons&quot;, which featured the story, was reprinted as &quot;Apt Pupil: A Novella in Different Seasons&quot;. Similarly, novels were published to tie in with the films &quot;Minority Report&quot; and &quot;Paycheck&quot;, featuring Philip K. Dick&#x27;s original short stories &quot;The Minority Report&quot; and &quot;Paycheck&quot;. The official organization linked to writing media tie-ins is the International Association of Media Tie-In Writers.

===Expanded universes===
Tie-in works may also tell new stories in the form of sequels, prequels and other spin-offs, creating an expanded universe based on the original work; for example, the many books, comics and video games set in an expanded universe based initially on the first &quot;Star Wars&quot; trilogy. In 2015, the &quot;New York Times&quot; noted the flourishing market for TV series tie-in novels, coinciding with the increasing cultural significance of quality television series. The increasing number of previously established novelists taking on tie-in works has also been credited with these works gaining a &quot;patina of respectability&quot; after having previously been disregarded in literary circles as derivative and mere merchandise.

===Video games===

Some video games are tie-in licences for films, television series or books.

Video game movie tie-ins are expensive for a game developer to license, and the game designers have to work within constraints imposed by the film studio, under pressure to finish the game in time for the film&#x27;s release. The aim for the publishers is to increase hype and revenue, as the two industries effectively market one another&#x27;s releases.

Film license video games have a reputation for being of poor quality; for example, &quot;Amiga Power&quot; awarding Psygnosis&#x27;s three film licenses (&quot;Dracula&quot;, &quot;Cliffhanger&quot; and &quot;Last Action Hero&quot;, all reviewed in June 1994) 36% &quot;in total&quot;; that magazine being cynical towards licensed games in general, with &quot;The Blues Brothers&quot; being one of the few exceptions. One of the first movie tie-in games, Atari&#x27;s &quot;E.T. the Extra-Terrestrial&quot; (1982) was deemed so bad it was cited as one cause of the video game industry crash. Such poor quality is often due to game developers forced to rush the product in order to meet the film&#x27;s release date, or due to issues with adapting the original work&#x27;s plot into an interactive form, such as in the case of the games based on the last two films of the &quot;Harry Potter&quot; film series, where one reviewer criticised some of the game&#x27;s missions and side-quests as being unrelated to the film&#x27;s storyline.

Video tie-in licences for novels tend to be adventure games. &quot;The Hobbit&quot; (1982) and &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; are text adventures, whilst &quot;I Have No Mouth, and I Must Scream&quot; (1995) is a point-and-click adventure and &quot;Neuromancer&quot; (1988) is a graphic adventure. Action games based on novels are less common (&quot;William Shatner&#x27;s TekWar&quot; (1995), a first-person shooter). Novel tie-ins were published less frequently after the 1990s, with developers only taking risks with stories that had already been licensed for films.

== Revenue and structure ==

Tie-ins are considered an important part of the revenue-stream for any major media release, and both planning and licensing for such works often begins at the very earliest stages of creating such a property. Tie-ins provide both an important way of generating additional income from a property, and a way of satisfying the desires of fans who enthusiastically support a popular media property.

The lineage of tie-in works can be quite convoluted; for example, a novelization might be done of a video game, which was based on a television series, based on a film, based on a comic book which was the original media property. In several cases, a novelization has been released based on a movie which was in turn adapted from an original novel. In such cases, it is not uncommon to see the novelization and a film release of the original novel side by side on the same shelf.

These tie-ins can be considered as forms of &quot;free advertising&quot;, as they create more exposure for the media property. Tie-ins need not have a direct association with the property; for example, a particular pizza company can offer coupons that are associated with the &quot;Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles&quot; films, but that specific pizza company itself does not necessarily have to appear in the films. By this association, however, the pizza company is exposed to a bigger audience. If a media property does well, the tie-ins gain that positive exposure as well.

== Early examples ==
===Film===
The American fan magazine &quot;Photoplay&quot;, first published in 1911, originally presented short stories based on popular films of the era. It later adopted a more traditional nonfiction format.

===Comics===
&quot;The Adventures of Superman&quot; by George Lowther (illustrated by original Superman artist Joe Shuster) was published in 1942.

===Television===
Some early examples of TV tie-in books are &quot;Leave It to Beaver&quot; (1960), &quot;Here&#x27;s Beaver!&quot; (1961), and &quot;Beaver and Wally&quot; (1961) by Beverly Cleary.

<text>Conservative Grace Brethren Churches, International (CGBCI) is a biblically conservative and fundamentalist group that separated from the Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches in 1992.

In 1939 the &quot;National Fellowship of Brethren Churches&quot; developed from struggles that occurred within the progressive Brethren Church during the 1920s and 1930s. Later the &quot;National Fellowship&quot; became known as the Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches (FGBC). In 1992, due to doctrinal disagreements in the FGBC, the Conservative Grace Brethren Churches, International was formed. A central issue involved in the division within the FGBC was the so-called membership issue. The conservative faction objected to the bestowal of membership status upon individuals who could not tangibly demonstrate their support for the church&#x27;s doctrinal convictions with regard to baptism, which is traditionally regarded as a triple immersion within historic Brethren circles, in accordance with Jesus&#x27; directives in . Within a larger context, the division within the FGBC paralleled the division between fundamentalists and neo-evangelicals that was taking place within many evangelical groups. Conservatives within the FGBC felt that the broader group was compromising its standards in the name of pragmatic growth strategies. Division was further cemented in the minds of conservatives with what was regarded as the unjust and ill-advised ouster of a much beloved and internationally respected professor, Dr. John C. Whitcomb, from the faculty of what was perceived as an increasingly liberalized Grace Theological Seminary, which was viewed by many conservatives as having fallen under the dominating influences of neo-evangelicalism.

The Conservative Grace Brethren maintain a 12-article statement of faith similar to the original FGBC statement of faith—which was subsequently radically restructured and revised by the FGBC (now known as the Charis Fellowship). Minor revisions and additional comments added to the CGBCI&#x27;s statement of faith in 1994 were designed to &quot;conserve&quot; what the CGBCI asserts are the original Grace Brethren tenets, including a young earth creation, the cessation of miraculous sign gifts, a seven-year eschatological tribulation period, the doctrine of eternal punishment as a conscious state of unending torment, the absolute and unlimited inerrancy of Scripture, and the exclusive practice of baptism by trine immersion, as well as the exclusive practice of communion as a threefold ordinance (involving foot-washing, the Love Feast, and the Eucharist). The Grace Brethren differ from traditional Schwarzenau Brethren groups in that they do not uphold the doctrine of conditional security as historically taught in Anabaptist theology.

In 2003 the CGBCI had 46 churches in 15 states of the United States, with the main concentration being in Ohio and Pennsylvania. In 2007, a ministerial dispute over the discipline of a Mansfield, Ohio, pastor resulted in the withdrawal of several congregations from the CGBCI, and the participating congregations dropped to 39 churches. In 2020, the CGBCI listed 35 member churches in 10 states within the CGBCI fellowship in the United States.

The CGBCI supports endorsed foreign missions in Africa, Myanmar, and India.

The Conservative Grace Brethren is one of six Schwarzenau Brethren groups that cooperate ecumenically in the Brethren World Assembly (founded 1992), and with the &quot;Brethren Encyclopedia&quot; having one representative on the board of directors with the following groups: Church of the Brethren, Dunkard Brethren, Fellowship of Grace Brethren Churches, Old German Baptist Brethren, and The Brethren Church.

<text>The American Locomotive Company (often shortened to ALCO, ALCo or Alco) was an American manufacturer that operated from 1901 to 1969, initially specializing in the production of locomotives but later diversifying and fabricating at various times diesel generators, automobiles, steel, tanks, munitions, oil-production equipment, as well as heat exchangers for nuclear power plants.

The company was formed by the merger of seven locomotive manufacturers and Schenectady Locomotive Engine Manufactory of Schenectady, New York. A subsidiary, American Locomotive Automobile Company, designed and manufactured automobiles under the Alco brand from 1905 to 1913. ALCO also produced nuclear reactors from 1954 to 1962. After World War II, Alco closed all of its manufacturing plants except those in Schenectady and Montreal.

In 1955, the company changed its name to Alco Products, Incorporated. In 1964, the Worthington Corporation acquired the company. The company went out of business in 1969, although Montreal Locomotive Works continued to manufacture locomotives based on Alco designs.

The ALCO name is currently being used by Fairbanks Morse Engine for their FM|ALCO line.

==History==


=== Foundation ===
The company was created in 1901 from the merger of seven smaller locomotive manufacturers with the Schenectady Locomotive Engine Manufactory of Schenectady, New York:
*Brooks Locomotive Works in Dunkirk, New York
*Cooke Locomotive &amp; Machine Works in Paterson, New Jersey
*Dickson Manufacturing Company in Scranton, Pennsylvania
*Manchester Locomotive Works in Manchester, New Hampshire
*Pittsburgh Locomotive and Car Works in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania
*Rhode Island Locomotive Works in Providence, Rhode Island
*Richmond Locomotive Works in Richmond, Virginia

The consolidation of the seven manufacturers was the brainchild of financier Pliny Fisk Sr. of the brokerage house Harvey Fisk &amp; Sons. The consolidated ALCO was intended to compete with Baldwin Locomotive Co. which controlled two-fifths of the industry.

The new company was headquartered in Schenectady. Samuel R. Callaway left the presidency of the New York Central Railroad to become president of Alco. When Callaway died on June 1, 1904, Albert J. Pitkin succeeded him as president of Alco.

In 1904, the American Locomotive Company acquired control of the Locomotive and Machine Company of Montreal, Quebec, Canada; this company was eventually renamed the Montreal Locomotive Works. In 1905, Alco purchased Rogers Locomotive Works of Paterson, New Jersey, the country&#x27;s second-largest locomotive manufacturer behind Baldwin Locomotive Works.

=== Steam era ===

Alco produced more than 75,000 locomotives, including more steam locomotives than any U.S. company except Baldwin Locomotive Works. (Alco outlasted Baldwin, in part by shifting more readily to diesel.) Railroads that favored Alco products included the Delaware &amp; Hudson Railway, the New York, New Haven &amp; Hartford Railroad, the New York Central Railroad, the Union Pacific Railroad and the Milwaukee Road. Among Alco&#x27;s better-known steam locomotives were the 4-6-4 Hudson, 4-8-2 Mohawk, and the 4-8-4 Niagara built for the New York Central; and the 4-8-4 FEF and the 4-6-6-4 Challenger built for the Union Pacific.

Alco built many of the biggest locomotives ever constructed, including Union Pacific&#x27;s &quot;Big Boy&quot; (4-8-8-4). Alco also built the fastest American locomotives, the Class A Atlantic and Class F7 Hudson streamliners for the Milwaukee Road&#x27;s &quot;Twin Cities Hiawatha&quot; run. Among the ambitious state-of-the-art designs of the late steam era, Alco&#x27;s Challengers, Big Boys, and high-speed streamliners stood out for their success in operations.
Alco built the second production steam locomotive in North America to use roller bearings (after the Delaware &amp; Hudson&#x27;s 1924 addition of SKF roller bearings to the drivers and main and side rods of their own 4-6-2 locomotives). This was Timken 1111, a 4-8-4 commissioned in 1930 by Timken Roller Bearing Company and ultimately used for on 15 major United States railroads before it was purchased in 1933 by the Northern Pacific Railway. The Northern Pacific renumbered the &quot;Four Aces&quot; to No. 2626 and ran it on the &quot;North Coast Limited&quot;, as well as its pool trains between Seattle, Washington, and Portland, Oregon, and excursions, through 1957.
During World War II, Alco produced many 2-10-0 Decapods for the USSR. Many went undelivered, and ten of these were sold to Finland in 1947. One, Alco builder&#x27;s No. 75214, is preserved at the Finnish Railway Museum.

Though the dual-service 4-8-4 steam locomotive had shown great promise, 1948 was the last year that steam locomotives were manufactured in Schenectady. These were the seven A-2a class 9400-series Pittsburgh &amp; Lake Erie Railroad 2-8-4 &quot;Berkshires.&quot; Their tenders had to be subcontracted to Lima Locomotive Works, as Alco&#x27;s tender shop had been closed. The building was converted to make diesel locomotives to compete with those of the Electro-Motive Division of General Motors.

Joseph Burroughs Ennis (1879–1955) was a senior vice president between 1917 and 1947 and was responsible for the design of many of the company&#x27;s locomotives.

=== Alco automobiles (1906–1913) ===

The company diversified into the automobile business in 1906, producing French Berliet designs under license. Production was located at Alco&#x27;s Rhode Island Locomotive Works in Providence, Rhode Island. Two years later, the Berliet license was abandoned, and the company began to produce its own designs instead. An Alco racing car won the Vanderbilt Cup in both 1909 and 1910 and competed in the first Indianapolis 500 in 1911, driven on all three occasions by Harry Grant.

ALCO&#x27;s automotive venture was unprofitable, and they abandoned automobile manufacture in 1913. The Alco automobile story is notable chiefly as a step in the automotive career of Walter P. Chrysler, who worked as the plant manager. In 1911 he left Alco for Buick in Detroit, Michigan, where he subsequently founded the Chrysler Corporation in 1925.

=== Electric locomotives ===
Alco made 60-ton center-cab electric freight motors from 1912 through the 1920s for electric railway lines in Oregon.

=== Diesel–electric locomotives ===

Already a leader in steam locomotives, Alco produced the first commercially successful diesel–electric switch engine in 1924 in a consortium with General Electric (electrical equipment) and Ingersoll-Rand (diesel engine). This locomotive was sold to the Central Railroad of New Jersey. It built additional locomotives for the Long Island Rail Road and the Chicago and North Western Railway.

The company bought the McIntosh &amp; Seymour Diesel Engine Company in 1929 and henceforth produced its own diesel engines, though it always bought its electrical equipment from GE. The diesel program was largely overseen by Perry T. Egbert, vice president in charge of diesel locomotive sales and later president of the company.

In the early to mid-1930s, ALCo was the pre-eminent builder of diesel–electric switch engines in the United States. It was slower than its competition to develop reliable diesel power for full-size mainline trains, though it did provided motive power for the Gulf, Mobile and Northern Railroad&#x27;s Rebel streamliners in 1935.

In 1939, ALCo started producing passenger diesel locomotives to compete with General Motors&#x27; Electro-Motive Corporation. The following year, ALCo teamed up with General Electric (Alco-GE) for much-needed support in competing with EMC. In 1941, ALCo introduced the RS-1, the first road–switcher locomotive. The versatile road–switcher design gained favor for short-haul applications, which would provide ALCo a secure market niche through the 1940s. The entry of the United States into World War II froze ALCo&#x27;s development of road diesel locomotives.

During that time, ALCo was allocated the construction of diesel switching locomotives, their new road–switcher locomotives, a small quantity of ALCO DL-109 dual-service engines and its proven steam designs, while EMD (formerly EMC) was allocated the construction of mainline road freight diesels (the production of straight passenger-service engines was prohibited by the War Production Board). Still, ALCo ranked 34th among United States corporations in the value of wartime production contracts.

Alco&#x27;s RS-1 road switcher was selected by the United States Army for a vital task: rejuvenating the Trans-Iranian Railway and extending it to the Soviet Union. This gave the U.S. ally a new supply line at a time when the German air force and navy had reduced Allied shipments to the Soviet port of Murmansk. The U.S. Army chose as locomotives the RSD-1, a six-axle, six-traction motor variant of the light ALCo RS-1. Not only was the company prevented from selling these locomotives to mainline U.S. railroads, but the 13 RS-1s that had already been built were commandeered for Iranian duty and converted to RSD-1s.

=== Post-war era ===
The postwar era saw ALCo&#x27;s steam products fall out of favor while it struggled to develop mainline diesel locomotives competitive with EMD&#x27;s E and F series road locomotives, which were well-positioned from GM-EMC&#x27;s large development efforts of the 1930s and its established service infrastructure. ALCo would prove unable to overcome that lead.
In 1946, ALCo controlled 26% of the diesel locomotive market. The ubiquitous S series (660 and 1000 horsepower) switchers and RS series (1000 and 1500 horsepower) road switchers represented ALCo well during the late 1940s. Much of its success in this period can be tied to its pioneering RS locomotives, representing the first modern road–switcher, a configuration which has long-outlasted ALCo. The success of their switcher and road–switcher locomotives was not matched with the PA and FA-type mainline units, however.

The 244 engine, developed in a crash program to compete with EMD&#x27;s powerful 567 engine, proved unreliable and sales of ALCo&#x27;s mainline units soon went into decline. In 1948, ALCo-GE produced a prototype gas-turbine–electric locomotive to address the concerns of operators such as Union Pacific that sought to minimize the number of locomotive units needed for large power requirements. In 1949, ALCo embarked on a clean-sheet design project to replace the 244. 1949 also saw the introduction of the EMD GP7 road–switcher, a direct challenge in ALCo&#x27;s bread-and-butter market.

In 1953, General Electric, dissatisfied with the pace of ALCo&#x27;s efforts to develop a replacement for the troubled 244 engine, dissolved their partnership with ALCo and took over the gas turbine–electric venture that had started series production the previous year. In 1956, ALCo made long-overdue changes, modernizing its production process and introducing road locomotives with its new 251 engine. However, the benefits to ALCo were negated by bad timing; the market for locomotives was declining after the height of the dieselization era and EMD&#x27;s GP9 was on the market as a proven competitor backed by a service infrastructure that ALCo, since the dissolution of the GE partnership, lacked. Sales were disappointing and ALCo&#x27;s profitability suffered.

GE entered the export road-diesel locomotive market in 1956, then the domestic market in 1960, and quickly took the No. 2 position from ALCo, and eventually eclipsed EMD in overall production. Despite continual innovation in its designs (the first AC/DC transmission among others), ALCo gradually succumbed to its competition, in which its former ally, General Electric, was an important element.

India during 1960s began gradual withdrawal of Steam locomotives from Indian Railways so the Diesel electric locomotive WDM series was developed by Banaras Locomotive Works with help of American Locomotive Company (ALCO) for Indian Railways. In 1962 Alco locomotives entered in service and since then Thousands of Alco class Locomotive WDM-2, WDM-3A
, WDM-3D would be manufactured and rebuilt which would make most successful locomotives of Indian Railways serving both passenger and freight trains and still retain operational status for Indian railways today

A new line of Century locomotives including the 630 (the first AC/DC transmission), the 430 and the 636, the first 3,600 horsepower (2.7 MW) locomotive, failed to keep the enterprise going. Third-place in the market proved to be an impossible position; ALCo products had neither the market position nor reputation for reliability of EMD&#x27;s products, nor the financing muscle and customer support of GE. It could not earn enough profits. In the late 1960s, Alco gradually ceased locomotive production, shipping its last two locomotives, a pair of T-6 switchers to the Newburgh &amp; South Shore Railroad (#1016 and #1017) in January 1969. ALCo closed its Schenectady locomotive plant later that year, and sold its designs to the Montreal Locomotive Works in Canada. The vast ALCo Schenectady plant was completely demolished by 2019, and its site is now occupied by a large industrial park.

=== Diversification ===
Alco diversified into areas other than automobiles with greater success. During World War II, Alco built munitions for the war effort, in addition to locomotive production; this continued throughout the Korean War. After the Korean War, Alco began making oil production equipment and heat exchangers for nuclear plants.

In 1955, the company was renamed Alco Products, Incorporated. By this stage, locomotive production only accounted for 20% of the business.

The first nuclear power plant connected to the electrical grid, the SM-1, was built for the Army Nuclear Power Program at Fort Belvoir in Virginia in 1957. Another complete plant, the PM-2A, was shipped to and constructed at Camp Century in Greenland. The Camp Century plant was filmed by the U.S. Army.

=== Purchase and division ===
The company was purchased in 1964 by the Worthington Corporation, which merged with the Studebaker corporation in 1967 to form Studebaker-Worthington, Alco remaining a wholly owned subsidiary. Former divisions of Alco became semi-independent subsidiaries in 1968.

After the termination of locomotive production in 1969, the locomotive designs (but not the engine development rights) were transferred to the Montreal Locomotive Works, which continued their manufacture. The diesel engine business was sold to White Motor Corporation in 1970, which developed White Industrial Power. In 1977 White Industrial Power was sold to the British General Electric Company (GEC) which renamed the unit Alco Power. The business was subsequently sold to the Fairbanks-Morse corporation, which continues to manufacture Alco-designed engines in addition to their own design.

The heat exchanger business continued as Alco Products for a time. At some later point, some of the heat exchanger products were manufactured by the Alco Products Division of Smithco Engineering in Tulsa, Oklahoma (Smithco). In January 1983, certain assets of the Alco Products Division of Smithco, namely double-pipe and hairpin-type heat exchanger products sold under the &quot;Alco Twin&quot; name, mark and style, were sold in an asset sale by Smithco to Bos-Hatten, a subsidiary of Nitram Energy. Following the sale of these assets, Smithco remained in business, manufacturing other heat exchange products. In 1985, the assets acquired from Smithco were assigned by Bos-Hatten to its parent, Nitram. In 2008, Nitram was acquired by Peerless Manufacturing Co In 2015, Peerless sold its heat exchanger business to Koch Heat Transfer Co.

==Epilogue==

After the closure of Alco&#x27;s Schenectady works, locomotives to Alco designs continued to be manufactured in Canada by Montreal Locomotive Works and in Australia by AE Goodwin.

In addition, Until 2022, Alco-derived locomotives accounted for most of the diesel power on the Indian Railways. Many thousands of locomotives with Alco lineage are in regular mainline use in India. Most of these locomotives were built by the Diesel Locomotive Works (DLW) at Varanasi, India. The Diesel Loco Modernisation Works (DMW) at Patiala, India, do mid-life rebuilding and upgrading the power of these locomotives, typically the WDM-2 to .
A number of Alco and MLW diesel–electric locomotives (models DL500C, DL532B, DL537, DL543, MX627 and MX636) are in daily use hauling freight trains of the Hellenic Railways Organisation (OSE) in Greece. The oldest of them (class A.201, DL532B) were delivered to the former Hellenic State Railways (SEK) in 1962. In addition to a variety of standard gauge locomotives, the fleet includes 11 metre gauge Alco locomotives, mainly used for departmental trains in the Peloponnese network. The MX627 and MX636 locomotives have been extensively rebuilt at Piraeus Central Factory of OSE. The remaining Alco locomotives are also being rebuilt, starting with models DL532B and DL537.

The ALCO 251 diesel engine is still manufactured by Fairbanks-Morse of Beloit, Wisconsin, a company which also manufactured diesel locomotives. Additionally, Alco diesel engines are used to power the NASA Crawler Transporter.
Some Alcos survive on Australian networks, as well as in Bangladesh and Pakistan. Another fleet of Alco Bombardier locomotives run in rugged terrain on the Sri Lanka railway network. Argentina also has a healthy fleet of Alcos DL540 running commuter and cargo trains.

The Glenbrook Vintage Railway New Zealand, has a 2-4-4-2 articulated compound mallet, built by Alco in 1912. Only four mallets with this wheel arrangement were ever built; the other three by Baldwin. This unique loco is currently out of service awaiting overhaul.

During the 1970s, Romania&#x27;s UCMR Resita made licensed engines from ALCo, putting the engines 6&amp;12R251 into naval gensets and also with the 6R251 in FAUR factory were made locomotives known as LDH 1500 CP. (CFR Classes 67/68/70/71 and CFR Class 61). They were also exported in Iran and Greece (OSE)

===Operational Alco steam locomotives===
Several Alco mainline locomotives are still operational, including Union Pacific 844, Union Pacific Big Boy 4014, Milwaukee Road 261, Soo Line 1003, and Florida East Coast 148.

UP Challenger 3985 ran in UP excursion service until 2010, but is now being restored by the Railroad Heritage of Midwest America museum.

Alco and MLW locomotives still work on several regional and tourist railroads across the United States and Canada, including the Delaware-Lackawanna Railroad in Scranton, Pennsylvania, the Catskill Mountain Railroad in Kingston; the Livonia, Avon and Lakeville Railroad lines based in Lakeville, New York, the Lake Whatcom Railway in Wickersham, Washington and the Middletown &amp; Hummelstown Railroad in Middletown, Pennsylvania. The latter owns one of the last Alco switchers built, #1016, a T-6 type. This and Alco sister 151 (ex Western Maryland Railway S-6) provide daily service in Middletown. Two original Alco RS-2&#x27;s that were delivered to the Nevada Northern Railway are still in operation.

ALCO-Cooke #18, built in 1920, survives in passenger service on the Arcade &amp; Attica Railroad in Arcade, New York. It returned to service in May 2009 after a six-year overhaul to bring it into compliance with the FRA&#x27;s new steam locomotive regulations.

Great Western 60, a built in Schenectady in 1937, currently operates in passenger service on the Black River &amp; Western Railroad in Ringoes, NJ.

Oregon Coast Scenic Railroad in Garibaldi, Oregon. This railroad owns the McCloud Railway 25. One of only four locomotives built by ALCO. This locomotive is operational, and is used in daily service six months of the year and weekend service an additional four months of the year. This locomotive appeared in the film &quot;Stand by Me&quot;.

===Preserved Alco steam locomotives (static display)===
Several Alco steam engines have been preserved, including on the Nevada Northern Railway in Ely, Nevada; at the Southern California Railway Museum in California, on the Lake Whatcom Railway in Washington and on the Durango and Silverton Narrow Gauge Railroad in Colorado.

In Portugal an Alco built in 1945 (construction number 73480) is displayed at the National Railway Museum at Entroncamento.

An Alco (construction number 75506 of 1947; local name Ty246) is stored at Zduńska Wola Railway Museum, Poland.

In Spain, an Alco built 1916 (construction number 57068) is displayed at the Ceuta old Station.

===Preserved Alco diesel locomotives (static display)===

In India, the first WDM-1 and WDM-2 are preserved at the National Rail Museum, New Delhi.

==Popular culture==
In February 2014, in the episode &quot;The Locomotive Manipulation&quot; of the TV series &quot;The Big Bang Theory,&quot; takes place on a train pulled by what is described as an &quot;Alco FA-4&quot;. Actually, the Napa Valley Wine Train (the setting for the episode) owns four Alco FPA-4 not FA-4.

Noted railroad artist Howard L. Fogg began his career at Alco. Hired in 1946 as Alco&#x27;s new company artist, Fogg began painting locomotives in the livery of prospective customers and taking photographs of them.

At an Alco gala at the Waldorf Astoria Hotel, Lucius Beebe, a noted journalist with the &quot;New York Herald-Tribune,&quot; sought out Fogg. Beebe was considering leaving New York to write railroad books. They began a long-term collaboration, with Beebe buying Fogg&#x27;s paintings and commissioning new ones for use in his books. In 1947, Beebe&#x27;s book, &quot;Mixed Train Daily,&quot; was the first of many to use a Fogg painting on the cover. Fogg was also used by many other railroad authors because of his skill at capturing action shots. With commissions from individuals, authors, publishers, railroads, and related industrial firms flourishing, in 1957 Fogg ended his formal agreement with Alco. He continued to paint periodic commissions for them for a number of years.

<text>The Wolf Prize is an international award granted in Israel, that has been presented most years since 1978 to living scientists and artists for &quot;achievements in the interest of mankind and friendly relations among people ... irrespective of nationality, race, colour, religion, sex or political views.&quot;

==History==

The prize is awarded in Israel by the Wolf Foundation, founded by Ricardo Wolf, a German-born inventor and former Cuban ambassador to Israel. It is awarded in six fields: Agriculture, Chemistry, Mathematics, Medicine, Physics, and an Arts prize that rotates between architecture, music, painting, and sculpture. Each prize consists of a diploma and US$100,000. The awards ceremony typically takes place at a session in the Knesset. 

The Wolf Prizes in physics and chemistry are often considered the most prestigious awards in those fields after the Nobel Prize. The prize in physics has gained a reputation for identifying future winners of the Nobel Prize – from the 26 prizes awarded between 1978 and 2010, fourteen winners have gone on to win the Nobel Prize, five of those in the following year.

In medicine, the prize is probably the third most prestigious, after the Nobel Prize and the Lasker Award. Until the establishment of the Abel Prize, the Wolf Prize was probably the closest equivalent of a &quot;Nobel Prize in Mathematics&quot;, since the more prestigious Fields Medal was only awarded every four years to mathematicians under forty years old. In agriculture, the prize has likewise been equated to a &quot;Nobel Prize in Agriculture&quot;.

The most recent Wolf Prize was awarded in June 2022 to:

* Agriculture—Pamela Ronald &quot;for pioneering work on disease resistance and environmental stress tolerance in rice&quot;.
* Chemistry—Bonnie L. Bassler, Carolyn R. Bertozzi, and Benjamin F. Cravatt III &quot;for their seminal contributions to understanding the chemistry of cellular communication and inventing chemical methodologies to study the role of carbohydrates, lipids, and proteins in such biological processes&quot;. 
* Mathematics—George Lusztig &quot;for groundbreaking contributions to representation theory and related areas&quot;.
* Physics—Paul Corkum, Ferenc Krausz, and Anne L&#x27;Huillier &quot;for pioneering contributions to ultrafast laser science and attosecond physics&quot;.
* Architecture—Yoshiharu Tsukamoto and Momoyo Kaijima &quot;for their work that highlights the importance to Architecture of its ethnographic and inhabitational characteristics, in their writings and practice&quot;, and Elizabeth Diller &quot;for her exceptional and influential work connecting architecture to artistic practice, engaged in the public domain&quot;.

<doc id="370716" wikidata="Q1061584" url="?curid=370716" title="Street dance">
<text>Street dance is an umbrella term for a large number of social dance styles such as: breakdancing, popping, locking, house dance, waacking, voguing, etc. Social dance styles have many accompanying steps and foundations, created organically from a culture, a moment in time, a way of life, influenced by natural social interaction. A street dance is a vernacular dance in an urban context. Vernacular dances are often improvisational and social in nature, encouraging interaction and contact with spectators and other dancers. These dances are a part of the vernacular culture of the geographical area that they come from.

== History ==
Street dance evolved during the 1970s outside dance studios in any available open space. This includes streets, dance parties, block parties, parks, school yards, raves, and nightclubs. This is partly due to African Americans who created the style were generally not accepted into dance studios because of their race. A significant feature of street dance is that it was historically a dance of young people offering a sense of freedom and giving a &#x27;voice&#x27; to unrepresented communities.

Due to the mix of styles within street dance, its origin can not be traced to one precise area, however, America is the birthplace of most street styles. Breakdance originated in the Bronx and Lite Feet emerged in Harlem, both in New York City, while popping and locking developed during the 1970s funk era in California, USA. Clogging, which evolved in the streets and factories of Northern England in the mid-19th century, is an early form of street dance.

<text>Curtin University (previously Curtin University of Technology and Western Australian Institute of Technology) is an Australian public research university based in Bentley, Perth, Western Australia. It is named after John Curtin, Prime Minister of Australia from 1941 to 1945, and is Western Australia&#x27;s largest university, with students in .

WAIT was established in 1966. Curtin was conferred university status after the Parliament of Western Australia passed legislation in 1986. Since then, the university has expanded its presence and has campuses in Singapore, Malaysia, Dubai and Mauritius, and has ties with 90 exchange universities in 20 countries. The university comprises five main faculties with over 95 specialists centres. It had a campus in Sydney from 2005 to 2016.

Curtin University is a member of the Australian Technology Network. Curtin is active in research in a range of academic and practical fields. As of 2020, it is Western Australia&#x27;s only university whose students have won the Australian Institute of Nuclear Science and Engineering&#x27;s Postgraduate Student Gold Medal.
== History ==
Curtin University was founded in 1966 as the Western Australian Institute of Technology. The four people who drove its establishment were Lesley Phillips, who was Superintendent of Technical Education from 1943 to 1948; George Hayman, who held the same position from 1948 to 1962; T. L. Robertson, Director of Education; and Haydn Williams, Director of Technical Education.

Its nucleus comprised the tertiary programs of the Perth Technical College, which opened in 1900. The university&#x27;s Bentley campus was selected in 1962 and officially opened in 1966. The first students enrolled in 1967. Haydn Williams was the first director of WAIT.

In 1969, three more institutions were merged with WAIT: the Kalgoorlie School of Mines (opened in 1902), the Muresk Agricultural College (opened in 1926), and the Schools of Physiotherapy and Occupational Therapy (in operation since the 1950s at Shenton Park). Between 1966 and 1976 WAIT experienced an expansion from 2,000 to 10,000 students.

In December 1986 WAIT was made a university, under provisions of the &quot;WA Institute of Technology Amendment Act 1986&quot;. Curtin University took its name from former Prime Minister of Australia John Curtin. In 1987, Curtin University of Technology became Western Australia&#x27;s third university and Australia&#x27;s first university of technology. By the mid-1990s, it had enrolments of 20,000 students, making it one of Australia&#x27;s largest universities.

In 1993, Curtin founded a graduate business school in St Georges Terrace. In 2002 it was moved to Murray Street, where it remains. The school was developed on the foundation of Curtin&#x27;s existing Master of Business Administration program.

In 2005, Curtin and Murdoch University were engaged in a feasibility study into the possibility of a merger. On 7 November 2005, the institutions announced that a merger would not be undertaken. 

In 2008, Curtin opened a campus in Singapore, its second offshore presence. In 2009, Curtin became the first university in the Australian Technology Network to be listed on the Academic Ranking of World Universities of research universities.

In 2010, Curtin dropped the &quot;of Technology&quot; suffix, from then operating as &quot;Curtin University&quot;.

== Campuses and buildings ==


===Perth and regional WA===
Curtin University&#x27;s main campus is in Bentley, Western Australia, about south-east of the Perth central business district. The campus was developed on a former pine plantation established in the 1930s.

Curtin has multiple smaller off-site campuses in the Perth metropolitan area. The Graduate School of Business building is in the Perth central business district in the renovated former Government Printing Office, and the law school is on Murray Street in the old Public Health Department and Chief Secretary&#x27;s building, a listed building on the State Register of Heritage Places. In 2016, Curtin entered into an agreement with the National Trust of Australia (WA) to use the restored Old Perth Boys&#x27; School at 139 St Georges Terrace for community and industry engagement. In 2018, Curtin renovated the original Perth Technical College building at 137 St Georges Terrace to create meeting rooms and learning spaces for professional development and postgraduate courses.

Exploration Geophysics and Petroleum Engineering are at the co-location research facilities of the Australian Resources Research Centre (ARRC), which also houses offices of CSIRO Earth Science and Resource Engineering and National Measurement Institute. The ARRC is in the Technology Park Bentley, adjacent to the main Bentley campus. Some university staff, researchers and students on practicum work in other locations, such as the Oral Health Centre of WA (OHCWA) in Nedlands and at Royal Perth Hospital, amongst other organisations.

Curtin has two bus stations, connected to the Transperth public transport network. The stations are also linked to the Mandurah railway line&#x27;s Canning Bridge Station by a shuttle bus service. Curtin also has an internal bus network trialling autonomous buses on campus.

Curtin has campuses outside Perth, the largest being the Western Australian School of Mines at Kalgoorlie, and a number of micro-campuses in Esperance, Margaret River, Geraldton, and elsewhere. Nursing is the only course offered in Geraldton. The Muresk Institute at Northam left Curtin in 2012.

====Hayman Theatre====
The Hayman Theatre was established in 1973 as Hayman Hall, for the use of theatre arts students. The Hall&#x27;s name derives from George Hayman, who played a major part in establishing WAIT in 1967. The theatre study company Theatreground as well as the Western Australian Theatre Company used the space. It was refurbished in 1977, creating the Theatre Upstairs above the main stage. After the Bentley Campus was expanded, in 2017 Hayman Theatre moved to Building 302.

=== Dubai campus ===
In April 2017 Curtin University established its newest campus in Dubai at Dubai International Academic City. Australian Ambassador to the UAE HE Arthur Spyrou officially opened the campus on 10 September 2017. Curtin University Dubai courses use the same structure and unit curriculum as those at the Bentley campus. Curtin University Dubai is accredited by the Knowledge and Human Development Authority (KHDA). The academic qualifications Curtin grants are certified by KHDA and recognised in the Emirate of Dubai by all public and private entities.

=== Malaysia campus ===

Curtin&#x27;s largest international campus is in Miri, Sarawak, Malaysia. Curtin&#x27;s operations in Miri began in February 1999. In 2002, a purpose-built campus was opened as Curtin&#x27;s first offshore campus and the first foreign university campus in East Malaysia. It has around 4,000 students from over 45 countries, and academics from more than 15 countries. Curtin Malaysia is the only approved CISCO Networking University in Miri and Brunei.

=== Singapore campus ===

Curtin University opened a Singapore-based campus on 23 November 2008. Curtin Singapore courses use the same structure and unit curriculum as those at the Bentley campus.

=== Mauritius campus ===
Curtin University opened its fourth international campus in Mauritius on 3 May 2018 on the campus of Charles Telfair Institute in Moka south of Port Louis.

=== Former Sydney campus (2005–2016) ===
Curtin University Sydney (Curtin Sydney) was established on 20 June 2005. The first campus was in The Rocks area. It later moved to the suburb of Chippendale, where it occupied the Berlei Building. Curtin Sydney&#x27;s operation was contracted out to private tertiary education provider Navitas Group. It offered international students diploma, undergraduate and postgraduate courses. In 2014 Curtin Sydney was involved in a cash-for-results scandal where students since 2012 had paid MyMaster, a Sydney company, up to $1,000 each to write essays and assignments for them, as well as to sit online tests. In 2015, Curtin announced that Curtin Sydney would close in 2017.

The guild operates most food and beverage outlets on campus, including Guild Cafés (Central, Engineering, Library), Angazi, Concept Coffee Co and Mallokup food outlets. Other commercial services include G-Mart, Curtin University&#x27;s general store, printing, stationery and news outlet and The Tav.

The guild operates and funds all Curtin student clubs and societies. It also runs a number of events throughout the year, most notably the Toga Party held in semester one and the previous notable event Grasslands Music Festival held in semester two. The guild publishes &quot;Grok&quot; magazine.

The Student Guild is governed independently of the University by students through the Guild Council, which consists of executive members: president, vice-presidents, secretary and councillors. All other representatives sit on the Representation Board. Students elect their representatives annually in September. Major Groups that contest elections include Illuminate, consisting of broadly left-wing Independent students; Left Action, aligned with Socialist Alternative; groups aligned with the Labor Right; and Joke Ticket&#x27;s, from various political leanings. The Guild currently has an Illuminate majority.

===Sports and athletics===

==Controversies==
Curtin has become active in research and partnerships overseas, particularly in mainland China, and has received funding from major Chinese companies, such as Tencent. It is involved in a number of business, management, and research projects, particularly in supercomputing, where the university participates in a tri-continental array with nodes in Perth, Beijing, and Edinburgh. The Chinese Premier Wen Jiabao visited the Woodside-funded hydrocarbon research facility during his visit to Australia in 2005. Funding from major Chinese companies connected to the state have led to concerns that Curtin University has limited academic freedom on certain topics.

In 2020, a roof at Curtin University collapsed, killing a 23-year-old construction worker after he fell more than , and leaving two other construction workers injured.

<doc id="370734" wikidata="Q409793" url="?curid=370734" title="Rhodochrosite">
<text>Rhodochrosite is a manganese carbonate mineral with chemical composition MnCO3. In its pure form (rare), it is typically a rose-red colour, but it can also be shades of pink to pale brown. It streaks white, and its Mohs hardness varies between 3.5 and 4.5. Its specific gravity is between 3.45 and 3.6. The crystal system of rhodochrosite is trigonal, with a structure and cleavage in the carbonate rhombohedral system. The carbonate ions () are arranged in a triangular planar configuration, and the manganese ions (Mn2+) are surrounded by six oxygen ions in an octahedral arrangement. The MnO6 octahedra and CO3 triangles are linked together to form a three-dimensional structure. Crystal twinning is often present. It can be confused with the manganese silicate rhodonite, but is distinctly softer. Rhodochrosite is formed by the oxidation of manganese ore, and is found in South Africa, China, and the Americas. It is one of the national symbols of Argentina and the state of Colorado.

Rhodochrosite forms a complete solid solution series with iron carbonate (siderite). Calcium (as well as magnesium and zinc, to a limited extent) frequently substitutes for manganese in the structure, leading to lighter shades of red and pink, depending on the degree of substitution. This is the reason for the rose color of rhodochrosite.

==Occurrence and discovery==
Rhodochrosite occurs as a hydrothermal vein mineral along with other manganese minerals in low temperature ore deposits as in the silver mines of Romania where it was first found. Banded rhodochrosite is mined in Capillitas, Argentina.

It was first described in 1813 in reference to a sample from Cavnic, Maramureş, present-day Romania. The name is derived from the combination of Greek words ροδόν (rodon, meaning &quot;rose&quot;) and χρωσις (chrosis, meaning &quot;coloring&quot;).

==Use==
Rhodochrosite is mainly used as an ore of manganese, which is a key component of low-cost stainless steel formulations, many tool steels, and certain aluminium alloys. Quality banded specimens are often used for decorative stones and jewellery. Due to its softness and perfect cleavage it is rarely found faceted in jewellery and is also sought after by many collectors.

Manganese carbonate is extremely destructive to the amalgamation process historically used in the concentration of silver ores, and were often discarded on the mine dump.

==Culture==
Rhodochrosite is Argentina&#x27;s &quot;national gemstone&quot;. Colorado officially named rhodochrosite as its state mineral in 2002.

It is sometimes called &quot;Rosa del Inca&quot;, &quot;Inca Rose&quot; or &quot;Rosinca&quot;.

<doc id="370745" wikidata="Q54051" url="?curid=370745" title="Władysław II the Exile">
<text>Władysław II the Exile (; 1105 – 30 May 1159) was the high duke of Poland and duke of Silesia from 1138 until his expulsion in 1146. He is the progenitor of the Silesian Piasts.

==Governor of Silesia==
He was the eldest son of Duke Bolesław III Wrymouth, sole ruler of Poland since 1107, by his first wife Zbyslava, a daughter of Sviatopolk II of Kiev. As Władysław was the firstborn son, his father decided to involve him actively in the government of the country. Some historians believe that Bolesław III gave Władysław the district of Silesia before his own death, in order to create an hereditary fief for his eldest descendants.

Around 1125 Władysław married Agnes of Babenberg, daughter of Margrave Leopold III of Austria; this union gave him a close connection with the Holy Roman Empire and the Kingdom of Germany: Agnes by her mother was a granddaughter of Emperor Henry IV and a half-sister of the Franconian duke Conrad III of Hohenstaufen, the later King of Germany. Thanks to Władysław, Silesia was saved during the wars of 1133–1135 with Bohemia: he stopped the destruction of the major areas of his district after the Bohemian forces crossed the Oder river.

In 1137, during the whitsun meeting with Duke Soběslav I of Bohemia at Niemcza (other sources mention Kłodzko), in which several disputed matters were decided, Władysław stood as godfather in the baptism of the youngest son of Soběslav, the future Duke Wenceslaus II.

==High Duke of Poland==

Duke Bolesław III died on 28 October 1138. In his will, he sought to maintain the unity under the Polish crown of the conquered neighbouring lands as well as prevent inheritance conflicts among his sons. He therefore determined a kind of mitigated primogeniture principle: as the oldest son, the supreme authority in the country was assigned to Władysław with the title of a High Duke (&quot;Princeps&quot;). In addition to Silesia, he received the central Seniorate Province, stretching from Lesser Poland at Kraków to eastern Greater Poland and western Kuyavia, as well as the authority over the Pomerelian lands at Gdańsk on the Baltic Sea. His younger half-brothers Bolesław IV the Curly and Mieszko III received the eastern Duchy of Masovia (composed of Masovia with eastern Kuyavia) and the western Duchy of Greater Poland (the remaining parts of Greater Poland with Lubusz Land) respectively, each as hereditary fiefs.

Upon the death of Bolesław&#x27;s widow Salomea of Berg, Władysław would also receive her dower at Łęczyca (Łęczyca Land and Sieradz Land), which had to revert to the Seniorate. On the other hand, he was obliged to provide his youngest half-brother Henry with the lands of Sandomierz when he would come of age (though only for life). The district however was not separated from the Seniorate until 1146. The youngest of his half-brothers, the later High Duke Casimir II the Just was not assigned any province; it is speculated that he was born after Bolesław III&#x27;s death.

At the time of the death of his father, Władysław was already an adult, with many years of marriage and at least one surviving son, Bolesław I the Tall, born in 1127 (the date of birth of the second son, Mieszko IV Tanglefoot, is still debatable and varies between 1130 and 1146). Following the examples of his predecessors Bolesław I Chrobry in 992, Mieszko II Lambert in 1032, and his own father in 1106, the High Duke almost immediately tried to restore the unity of the country. Given his life experience and military leadership, it was generally expected that in the end, he would be successful.

==First conflicts with junior dukes==
The disputes of Władysław with his stepmother Salomea and his half-brothers began openly in 1141, when the Dowager Duchess, without the knowledge and consent of the High Duke, commenced to divide her Łęczyca province between her sons. Also, she tried to resolve the marriage of her youngest daughter Agnes and thus to find a suitable ally for her sons. The most appropriate candidate for a son-in-law had to be one of the sons of the Grand Prince Vsevolod II of Kiev. After hearing the news about the events in Łęczyca, Władysław decided to make a quick response, as a result of which the Grand Prince of Kiev not only broke all his pacts with the Junior Dukes, but also arranged the betrothal of his daughter Zvenislava to Władysław&#x27;s eldest son Bolesław. The wedding took place one year later, in 1142.

His ties with the Kievan Rus&#x27; benefited him during 1142-1143, when Władysław decided to fight against the districts of his brothers. Władysław&#x27;s victory was beyond dispute, being backed by his alliances with the Rus&#x27;, Bohemia and the Holy Roman Empire.

==Włostowic affair==

During Wladyslaw&#x27;s reign, the Silesian voivode (count palatine) Piotr Włostowic had the greatest and most decisive impact. A firm follower of Duke Bolesław III, he had soon acquired enormous political significance in the country, covering the most important court offices. In his prerogative as voivode he had the right to appoint officials in local authorities across Poland, including in the areas of the Junior Dukes, which made him the person from whose decisions was determined the fate of the state. In view of the conflict between her sons and Władysław looming ahead, Bolesław&#x27;s wife Salomea of Berg intrigued against him, whereafter Włostowic had to resign and was replaced by one of her minions. When Władysław succeeded his father, he reinstated the voivode, however the increased power of Włostowic fostered deep negative relations, especially with his wife Agnes of Babenberg, who - not without reason - considered him a traitor.

On 27 July 1144 Salomea of Berg, Duke Bolesław&#x27;s widow and Włostowic&#x27;s bitter enemy, died. As in accordance with the Duke&#x27;s will, her province of Łęczyca had to revert to the Senoriate Province of Władysław, the voivode, in agreement with the Junior Dukes, planned a coup d&#x27;état in order to take the contested district, perhaps as emolument for the younger Henry. Again in this case, Władysław appealed for aid to his Kievan allies. Without waiting the arrival of food he sent his troops against the forces of Bolesław IV the Curly and Mieszko III; unexpectedly, Władysław suffered a defeat. It wasn&#x27;t until the arrival of the Kievans that the fate of the battle and the war turned to Władysław&#x27;s side. Immediately, a favourable peace treaty was made, which permitted the High Duke to take full control over Łęczyca; however, he had to give to the Kievan cohorts, in exchange for their aid, the Polish castle at Wizna.

In the meanwhile, the tensions between Władysław and Piotr Włostowic worsened. The position of the Count Palatine in the civil war was clearly against the High Duke. This attitude clearly did not correspond with Wladyslaw&#x27;s concept of autocracy, and after this episode he thought about the total removal of his brothers from their lands. By 1145 however, it seemed that a reconciliation between the High Duke and Włostowic was possible, as evidenced by the invitation to Władysław by the voivode on the occasion of Włostowic&#x27;s son wedding. At the beginning of the following year the High Duke, however, decided to bet everything on one gamble: eliminate Włostowic from his life for good. He ordered one of his knights, Dobek, to capture him. Dobek arrived at Włostowic&#x27;s court at Ołbin (in present-day Wrocław), and during the night captured the voivode with his men. High Duchess Agnes demanded Włostowic&#x27;s death, but Władysław decided instead to make an example out of him: he was blinded, mutilated and sentenced to exile.

Włostowic was respected and had many friends, and his fate caused many nobles to switch their allegiance to the Junior Dukes. Furthermore, the blinded Włostowic fled to the Kievan Rus&#x27;, which had so far supported Władysław, and convinced them to break their alliance.

==Deposition==
At the beginning of 1146 Władysław decided to make the final attack on his rivaling half-brothers. Initially, it seemed that victory of the High Duke was only a matter of time, since he managed to take Masovia without obstacles and forced Duke Bolesław IV the Curly to withdraw to the defense of his brother Mieszko III at Poznań in Greater Poland. There, unexpectedly, began Władysław&#x27;s disaster. The reason for this was the insecurity of his other districts, where mighty rebellions erupted against Władysław&#x27;s dictatorial politics. The rebels quickly grew in power thanks to the support of Archbishop Jakub ze Żnina of Gniezno, who excommunicated the High Duke – as a punishment for the fate of the voivode Włostowic – resulting in an additional series of rebellions. The defeat at the end was thanks not only to the combined forces of Duke Bołeslaw IV at Poznan with the troops of the other Junior Dukes, but also by Władysław&#x27;s own subjects, which was a total surprise to him. The High Duke was forced to flee abroad; shortly afterwards his wife Agnes and children joined him, after their unsuccessful attempts to defend Kraków.

The Junior Dukes had a complete success, and Władysław was now under the mercy of his neighbours. Initially, he and his family stayed in the court of his namesake and brother-in-law Duke Vladislaus II of Bohemia at Prague Castle. The title of a High Duke was assumed by Bołeslaw IV. Władysław never returned to Poland.
==Exile==
Soon after his arrival in Bohemia, his brother-in-law King Conrad III of Germany offered him his hospitality. Władysław shortly after moved to Germany and paid tribute to King Conrad and asked for assistance in regaining the throne. As King Conrad had also been able to reinstate Vladislaus of Bohemia shortly before, it initially appeared that Władysław would regain power over Poland very soon. The expedition against the Junior Dukes was launched in 1146, but due to flooding of the Oder river and the pressure on the German king by the margraves Albert the Bear and Conrad of Meissen, who showed no interest in an armed conflict at the German eastern border, the campaign finally failed.

Władysław of course did not lose hope of changing his fate, but for now he had to accept the postponement of his return, particularly when Conrad III started the Second Crusade with King Louis VII of France to the Holy Land the next year. During this time, the former High Duke administrated the &quot;Kaiserpfalz&quot; at Altenburg and its dependencies in the Imperial Pleissnerland. Without waiting for German aid, Władysław and his wife Agnes went to the Roman Curia and asked Pope Eugene III for help, but this attempt was also unsuccessful.

==Death and legacy==
In 1152 King Conrad III died and was succeeded by his nephew Frederick Barbarossa. With this, the hopes of Władysław of returning to Poland were reborn. Following the inducements of Władysław and Frederick&#x27;s aunt Agnes of Babenberg, the Holy Roman Emperor launched a new expedition to Greater Poland in 1157. The campaign was a success, but unexpectedly Frederick Barbarossa did not restore Władysław to the Polish throne, after Bolesław IV apprehended at Krzyszkowo had to declare himself a vassal to the Emperor and was compelled to pay tribute to him. In compensation, the Emperor forced Bolesław IV to promise the restitution of Silesia to Władysław&#x27;s sons Bolesław the Tall and Mieszko IV Tanglefoot.

At this time, it appears, Władysław knew that his battle for supremacy in Poland was finally lost. He remained in exile at Altenburg, where he died two years later. It was not until 1163 that Bolesław IV finally granted the Silesian province to Władysław&#x27;s sons.

Apart from the question of an actual enfeoffment of Władysław&#x27;s sons by the emperor, a disruption between them and their Piast cousins had occurred. In the following centuries, Silesia was divided into as many as 17 separate duchies among their descendants and successors, who from the early 14th century onwards gradually became vassals of the Imperial Kingdom of Bohemia. By the 1335 Treaty of Trentschin the Polish king Casimir III the Great renounced all claims to the Silesian lands, which remained under the rule of the Silesian Piasts until the male line of the dynasty finally became extinct with the death of Duke George William of Legnica in 1675.

==Marriage and children==
In 1125 Władysław married Agnes of Babenberg (b. ca. 1108/1113 – d. at Altenburg, 24 January 1160/63), daughter of Margrave Saint Leopold III of Austria and Agnes of Germany, who in turn was a daughter of Emperor Henry IV. She was also the half-sister of King Conrad III of Germany.

They had:
#Bolesław I the Tall (b. 1127 – d. 8 December 1201)
#Mieszko I Tanglefoot (b. ca. 1130 – 16 May 1211)
#Richeza (b. 1140 – d. 16 June 1185), married firstly in 1152 to Alfonso VII, King of Galicia, Castile and León, secondly in 1162 to Ramon Berenguer II, Count of Provence and thirdly by 1167 to Count Albert III of Everstein.
#Konrad Spindleshanks (b. 1146/57 – d. 17 January 1190).
#Albert (d. young, ca. 1168).

<text>Cassin&#x27;s finch (Haemorhous cassinii) is a bird in the finch family, Fringillidae. This species and the other &quot;American rosefinches&quot; are placed in the genus &quot;Haemorhous&quot;.

== Description ==
Measurements:

* Length: 6.3 in (16 cm)
* Weight: 0.8–1.2 oz (24–34 g)
* Wingspan: 9.8–10.6 in (25–27 cm)

Adults have a short forked brown tail and brown wings. They have a longer bill than the purple finch. Adult males are raspberry red on the head, breast, back and rump; their back and undertail are streaked. Adult females have light brown upperparts and light underparts with brown streaks throughout; their facial markings are less distinct than those of the female purple finch.

Their breeding habitat is coniferous forest in mountains of western North America as far south as northern New Mexico and Arizona; also Southern California near Baja California. They nest in large conifers. They move to lower elevations in winter.

Northernmost breeding birds migrate south, as do some birds throughout the range of the species; many birds are permanent residents, however. Some non-breeding birds winter as far south as central interior Mexico.

These birds forage in trees, sometimes in ground vegetation. They mainly eat seeds, buds and berries, some insects. When not nesting, they often feed in small flocks.

This bird was named after John Cassin, who was a curator at the Philadelphia Academy of Natural Sciences.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Bakers is one of the livery companies of the City of London. The Bakers&#x27; Guild is known to have existed in the twelfth century. From the Corporation of London, the Guild received the power to enforce regulations for baking, known as the Assize of Bread and Ale. The violations included selling short-weight bread and the addition of sand instead of flour. The Bread Assize remained in force until 1863, when Parliament repealed it.

In the 14th century, the Guild was divided into the Brown-Bakers&#x27; Guild and the White-Bakers&#x27; Guild. The Brown-Bakers were bakers of nutritious bread, while the White-Bakers were bakers of the less nutritious but more popular bread. The White Bakers were incorporated by a Royal Charter of 1509, while the Brown Bakers were incorporated in 1621. The White and Brown Bakers united into one Company in 1645. The new Company acquired a new Charter in 1686, under which it still operates. Bakers Hall in Harp Lane, Billingsgate, has been the site of the of the bakers since 1506. It contains a courtroom where trade-related misdemeanours could be tried.

There are many such associated trades guilds, such as the Incorporation of Bakers, one of the fourteen Incorporated Trades of Glasgow, who meet in their Robert Adam designed Trades Hall. In the medieval town of Orvieto, bakers were one of the thirty-one organized crafts. Now largely ceremonial and charitable, these crafts and guilds formerly fulfilled the role of regulation much of which is now covered by local government.

The Bakers&#x27; Company ranks nineteenth in the order of precedence of livery companies. The company&#x27;s motto is &quot;Praise God For All&quot;.

<doc id="370751" wikidata="Q2911019" url="?curid=370751" title="Premier of Quebec">
<text>The premier of Quebec ( (masculine) or (feminine)) is the head of government of the Canadian province of Quebec. The current premier of Quebec is François Legault of the Coalition Avenir Québec, sworn in on October 18, 2018, following that year&#x27;s election.

==Selection and qualifications==
The premier of Quebec is appointed as president of the Executive Council by the lieutenant governor of Quebec, the viceregal representative of the King in Right of Quebec. The premier is most usually the head of the party winning the most seats in the National Assembly of Quebec and is normally a sitting member of the National Assembly. An exception to this rule occurs when the winning party&#x27;s leader fails to win a riding. In that case, the premier would have to attain a seat by winning a by-election. This has happened, for example, to Robert Bourassa in 1985.

The role of the premier of Quebec is to set the legislative priorities on the opening speech of the National Assembly. The premier represents the leading party and must have the confidence of the assembly, as expressed by votes on budgets and other matters considered as confidence votes.

The term &quot;premier&quot; is used in English, while French employs &quot;premier ministre&quot;, which translates directly to &quot;prime minister&quot;. In at least one instance, the term &quot;prime minister of the Province of Quebec&quot; was used in an English-language advertisement. The term is also used for the Podium Ceremony of the annual Formula One Grand Prix du Canada in Montreal.

<doc id="370753" wikidata="Q11723296" url="?curid=370753" title="Stereoscope">
<text>A stereoscope is a device for viewing a stereoscopic pair of separate images, depicting left-eye and right-eye views of the same scene, as a single three-dimensional image.

A typical stereoscope provides each eye with a lens that makes the image seen through it appear larger and more distant and usually also shifts its apparent horizontal position, so that for a person with normal binocular depth perception the edges of the two images seemingly fuse into one &quot;stereo window&quot;. In current practice, the images are prepared so that the scene appears to be beyond this virtual window, through which objects are sometimes allowed to protrude, but this was not always the custom. A divider or other view-limiting feature is usually provided to prevent each eye from being distracted by also seeing the image intended for the other eye.
Most people can, with practice and some effort, view stereoscopic image pairs in 3D without the aid of a stereoscope, but the physiological depth cues resulting from the unnatural combination of eye convergence and focus required will be unlike those experienced when actually viewing the scene in reality, making an accurate simulation of the natural viewing experience impossible and tending to cause eye strain and fatigue.

Although more recent devices such as Realist-format 3D slide viewers, the View-Master, or virtual reality headsets are also stereoscopes, the word is now most commonly associated with viewers designed for the standard-format stereo cards that enjoyed several waves of popularity from the 1850s to the 1930s as a home entertainment medium.

Devices such as polarized, anaglyph and shutter glasses which are used to view two actually superimposed or intermingled images, rather than two physically separate images, are not categorized as stereoscopes.

==History==

===Wheatstone stereoscope===

The earliest stereoscopes, &quot;both with reflecting mirrors and with refracting prisms&quot;, were invented by Sir Charles Wheatstone and constructed for him by optician R. Murray in 1832. Herbert Mayo shortly described Wheatstone&#x27;s discovery in his book &quot;Outlines of Human Physiology&quot; (1833) and claimed that Wheatstone was about to publish an essay about it. It was only one of many projects of Wheatstone&#x27;s and he first presented his findings on 21 June 1838 to the Royal College of London. In this presentation he used a pair of mirrors at 45 degree angles to the user&#x27;s eyes, each reflecting a picture located off to the side. It demonstrated the importance of binocular depth perception by showing that when two pictures simulating left-eye and right-eye views of the same object are presented so that each eye sees only the image designed for it, but apparently in the same location, the brain will fuse the two and accept them as a view of one solid three-dimensional object. Wheatstone&#x27;s stereoscope was introduced in the year before the first practical photographic processes became available, so initially drawings were used. The mirror type of stereoscope has the advantage that the two pictures can be very large if desired.

===Brewster stereoscope===
Contrary to a common assertion, David Brewster did not invent the stereoscope, as he himself was often at pains to make clear. A rival of Wheatstone, Brewster credited the invention of the device to a Mr. Elliot, a &quot;Teacher of Mathematics&quot; from Edinburgh, who, according to Brewster, conceived of the idea as early as 1823 and, in 1839, constructed &quot;a simple stereoscope without lenses or mirrors&quot;, consisting of a wooden box long, wide, and high, which was used to view drawn landscape transparencies, since photography had yet to become widespread. Brewster&#x27;s personal contribution was the suggestion to use lenses for uniting the dissimilar pictures in 1849; and accordingly the &quot;lenticular stereoscope&quot; (lens-based) may fairly be said to be his invention. This allowed a reduction in size, creating hand-held devices, which became known as Brewster Stereoscopes, much admired by Queen Victoria when they were demonstrated at the Great Exhibition of 1851.

Brewster was unable to find in Britain an instrument maker capable of working with his design, so he took it to France, where the stereoscope was improved by Jules Duboscq who made stereoscopes and stereoscopic daguerreotypes, and a famous picture of Queen Victoria that was displayed at The Great Exhibition. Almost overnight a 3D industry developed and 250,000 stereoscopes were produced and a great number of &quot;stereoviews&quot;, &quot;stereo cards&quot;, &quot;stereo pairs&quot;, or &quot;stereographs&quot; were sold in a short time. Stereographers were sent throughout the world to capture views for the new medium and feed the demand for 3D images. Cards were printed with these views often with explanatory text when the cards were looked at through the double-lensed viewer, sometimes also called a &quot;stereopticon&quot;, a common misnomer.

===Holmes stereoscope===

In 1861 Oliver Wendell Holmes created and deliberately did not patent a handheld, streamlined, much more economical viewer than had been available before. The stereoscope, which dates from the 1850s, consisted of two prismatic lenses and a wooden stand to hold the stereo card. This type of stereoscope remained in production for a century and there are still companies making them in limited production currently.

=== Multiple view stereoscope ===

Multiple view stereoscopes allow viewing multiple stereoscopic images in sequence by turning a knob, crank, or pushing down a lever. The first design was patented by Antoine Claudet in 1855, but the design of Alexander Beckers from 1857 formed the basis for many revolving stereoscopes that were manufactured from the 1860s. The images are placed in holders that are attached to a rotating belt. The belt can usually hold 50 paper card or glass stereoviews, but there are also large floor standing models for 100 or 200 views.

A more advanced multiple view stereoscope is only intended for glass slides and was especially popular in France, as the printing of stereo images on glass was a French specialty and popular until the 1930s. Most devices were manufactured in France, but also in Germany by ICA and Ernemann. The glass slides are placed in a bakelite or wooden tray. Turning a crank (or pushing down a lever) will lift a slide from the tray and brings it into viewing position. Turning further will place the slide back in the tray and moves the tray over a rail to select the next slide. The most sophisticated and well known design was the Taxiphote by Jules Richard, patented in 1899.

===Modern use===
In the mid-20th century the View-Master stereoscope (patented 1939), with its rotating cardboard disks containing image pairs, was popular first for &#x27;virtual tourism&#x27; and then as a toy. In 2010, Hasbro started producing a stereoscope designed to hold an iPhone or iPod Touch, called the My3D. In 2014, Google released the template for a papercraft stereoscope called Google Cardboard. Apps on the mobile phone substitute for stereo cards; these apps can also sense rotation and expand the stereoscope&#x27;s capacity into that of a full-fledged virtual reality device. The underlying technology is otherwise unchanged from earlier stereoscopes.

Several fine arts photographers and graphic artists have and continue to produce original artwork to be viewed using stereoscopes.

==Principles==
A simple stereoscope is limited in the size of the image that may be used. A more complex stereoscope uses a pair of horizontal periscope-like devices, allowing the use of larger images that can present more detailed information in a wider field of view. The stereoscope is essentially an instrument in which two photographs of the same object, taken from slightly different angles, are simultaneously presented, one to each eye. This recreates the way which in natural vision, each eye is seeing the object from a slightly different angle, since they are separated by several inches, which is what gives humans natural depth perception. Each picture is focused by a separate lens, and by showing each eye a photograph taken several inches apart from each other and focused on the same point, it recreates the natural effect of seeing things in three dimensions.

A moving image extension of the stereoscope has a large vertically mounted drum containing a wheel upon which are mounted a series of stereographic cards which form a moving picture. The cards are restrained by a gate and when sufficient force is available to bend the card it slips past the gate and into view, obscuring the preceding picture. These coin-enabled devices were found in arcades in the late 19th and early 20th century and were operated by the viewer using a hand crank. These devices can still be seen and operated in some museums specializing in arcade equipment.

The stereoscope offers several advantages:

* Using positive curvature (magnifying) lenses, the focus point of the image is changed from its short distance (about 30 to 40 cm) to a virtual distance at infinity. This allows the focus of the eyes to be consistent with the parallel lines of sight, greatly reducing eye strain. 
* The card image is magnified, offering a wider field of view and the ability to examine the detail of the photograph.
* The viewer provides a partition between the images, avoiding a potential distraction to the user.

A stereo transparency viewer is a type of stereoscope that offers similar advantages, e.g. the View-Master.

Disadvantages of stereo cards, slides or any other hard copy or print are that the two images are likely to receive differing wear, scratches and other decay. This results in stereo artifacts when the images are viewed. These artifacts compete in the mind resulting in a distraction from the 3D effect, eye strain and headaches.

<doc id="370768" wikidata="Q1052647" url="?curid=370768" title="Variation of the field">
<text>In heraldry, variations of the field are any of a number of ways that a field (or a charge) may be covered with a pattern, rather than a flat tincture or a simple division of the field.

== Patterning with ordinaries and subordinaries ==

The diminutives of the ordinaries are frequently employed to vary the field.

Any of these patterns may be counterchanged by the addition of a division line; for example, &quot;barry argent and azure, counterchanged per fess&quot; or &quot;checquy Or and gules, counterchanged per chevron&quot;.

=== Barry, paly, bendy, pily, chevronny ===

When the field is patterned with an even number of horizontal (fesswise) stripes, this is described as &quot;barry&quot; e.g. of six or eight, usually of a colour and metal specified, e.g. &quot;barry of six argent and gules&quot; (this implies that the chiefmost piece is argent). With ten or more pieces, the field is described as &quot;barruly&quot;.
A field with narrow piles throughout, issuing from either the dexter or sinister side of the shield, is &quot;barry pily&quot;.

When the field is patterned with an even number of vertical stripes (pallets), the field is described as &quot;paly&quot;. 

When the field is patterned with a series of diagonal stripes (bendlets), running from top-left to bottom-right, the field is described as &quot;bendy&quot;. In the opposite fashion (top-right to bottom-left) it is &quot;bendy sinister&quot; (of &quot;skarpes&quot;, the diminutive in England of the bend sinister); of chevronels, &quot;chevronny&quot;. An unusual example of bendy is one in which a metal alternates with two colours.

In modern practice the number of pieces is nearly always even. 
A shield of thirteen vertical stripes, alternating argent and gules, would not be &quot;paly of thirteen, argent and gules&quot;, but &quot;argent, six pallets gules&quot;.
One unusual design is described in part as &quot;bendy of three&quot; though, as each third is again divided, the effect is of a six-part division.

If no number of pieces is specified, it may be left up to the heraldic artist, but is still represented with an even number.

An instance of a &quot;fess... paly Sable, Argent, Bleu celeste and Or&quot; occurs in the arms of the 158th Quartermaster Battalion of the United States Army, although this is atypical terminology and it could be argued that the fess should be blazoned as &quot;per pale, in dexter per pale sable and argent, and in sinister per pale bleu celeste and or&quot;.

In the modern arms of the Count of Schwarzburg, the quarters are divided by a cross bendy of three tinctures.

When the shield is divided by lines both palewise and bendwise, with the pieces coloured alternately like a chess board, this is &quot;paly-bendy&quot;; if the diagonal lines are reversed, &quot;paly-bendy sinister&quot;. If horizontal rather than vertical lines are used, it is &quot;barry-bendy&quot;; and similarly, when reversed, &quot;barry-bendy sinister&quot;.

A field which seems to be composed of a number of triangular pieces is &quot;barry bendy and bendy sinister&quot;.

=== Chequy ===

When divided by palewise and fesswise lines into a chequered pattern, the field is &quot;chequy&quot;. The coat of arms of Croatia &quot;Chequy gules and argent&quot; is a well known example of the red and white chequy. The arms of a Bleichröder, banker to Bismarck, show chequy &quot;fimbriated&quot; (the &quot;chequers&quot; being divided by thin lines). The arms of the 85th Air Division (Defense) of the United States Air Force show &quot;a checky grid&quot; on part of the field, though this is to be distinguished from &quot;chequy&quot;. The number of chequers is generally indeterminate, though the fess in the arms of Robert Stewart, Lord of Lorn, they are blazoned as being &quot;of four tracts&quot; (in four horizontal rows); and in arms of Toledo, fifteen chequers are specified. The number of vertical rows can also be specified. When a bend or bend sinister, or one of their diminutives, is chequy, the chequers follow the direction of the bend unless otherwise specified. James Parker cites the French term &quot;equipolle&quot; to mean chequy of nine, though mentions that this is identical to a &quot;cross quarter-pierced&quot; (strangely, this is blazoned as &quot;a Latin square chequy of nine&quot; in the arms of the Statistical Society of Canada). He also gives the arms of Prospect as an unusual example of chequy, &quot;Chequy in perspective argent and sable&quot;; which must be distinguished from cubes as a charge. Chequy is not &quot;fanciable&quot;; that is, the lines of chequy cannot be modified by lines of partition.

=== Lozengy, fusilly, masculy and rustré ===

When the shield is divided by both bendwise and bendwise-sinister lines, creating a field of lozenges coloured like a chessboard, the result is &quot;lozengy&quot;. A field lozengy must be distinguished from an ordinary such as a bend which is blazoned of one tincture and called &quot;lozengy&quot;; this means that the ordinary is entirely composed of lozenges, touching at their obtuse corners. Such arrangement is better blazoned as &quot;lozenges bendwise&quot;. In &quot;paly bendy&quot;, the bendwise lines are supposed to be less acute than in plain lozengy.

Part of the field of the arms of the 544th Intelligence, Surveillance and Reconnaissance Group of the United States Air Force is &quot;lozengy in perspective&quot;.

A field &quot;fusilly&quot; can be very difficult to distinguish from a field lozengy; the fusil is supposed to be proportionately narrower than the lozenge, and the bendwise and bendwise-sinister lines are therefore more steeply sloped.

A field &quot;masculy&quot; is composed entirely of mascles; that is, lozenges pierced with a lozenge shape – this creates a solid fretwork surface and is to be distinguished from a field &quot;fretty&quot;.

An extremely rare, possibly unique example of a field &quot;rustré&quot; - counterchanged rustres - occurs in Canadian heraldry in the arms of R.C. Purdy Chocolates Ltd.

=== Gyronny ===

A shield that is divided quarterly and per saltire, forming eight triangular pieces, is &quot;gyronny&quot;. This is technically a field covered with &quot;gyrons&quot;, a rare charge in the form of a wedge, shown individually in the well-known arms of Mortimer. Possibly the best-known example is in the arms of the Scottish family of Campbell: &quot;Gyronny of eight or and sable&quot;, borne most notably by the Duke of Argyll, Chief of the Clan Campbell. The first tincture in the blazon is that of the triangle in dexter chief. Gyronny can also have a different number of pieces than eight; for example, Sir William Stokker, Lord Mayor of London, had a field gyronny of six; there may be gyronny of ten or twelve, and the arms of Clackson provide an example of &quot;gyronny of sixteen&quot;. While the gyrons of gyronny almost invariably meet in the fess point, the exact centre of the shield, the arms of the University of Zululand are an unusual example of gyronny meeting in the nombril point, a point on the shield midway between the fess point and the base point. Gyronny can be modified by most of the lines of partition, with exceptions such as dancetty and angled.
The canting arms of Maugiron show &quot;gyronny of six&quot;, clearly deemed &quot;mal-gironné&quot; (&#x27;badly gyronny&#x27;).

=== Variations of lines ===
Any of the division lines composing the variations of the field above may be blazoned with most of the different line shapes; e.g. &quot;paly nebuly of six, or and sable&quot;. One very common use of this is &quot;barry wavy azure and argent&quot;; this is often used to represent either water or a body of water in general, or the sea in particular, though there are other if less commonly used methods of representing the sea, including in a more naturalistic manner.

== Semé ==

When the field (or a charge) is described as semé or semy (occasionally semee) of a sub-ordinary or other charge, it is depicted as being scattered (literally &#x27;seeded&#x27;) with many copies of that charge. Semé is regarded as part of the field and thus within the opening section of the blazon describing the field before the first comma. Thus: &quot;Azure semy-de-lis or&quot; not &quot;Azure, semy-de-lis or&quot;. A charge on top would be blazoned: &quot;Azure semy-de-lis or, a bend argent&quot;.

To avoid confusion with a simple use of a large number of the same charge (e.g. &quot;Azure, fifteen fleurs-de-lis or&quot;), the charges semé are ideally depicted cut off at the edge of the field, though in olden depictions this is often not the case. An example of this can be found in the modern Coat of arms of Denmark, which now features three lions among nine hearts, but the ancient arms depicted three leopards on a &quot;semy&quot; of hearts, the number of which varied and was not fixed at nine until 1819. There are also some exceptions to this, as in the case of some bordures blazoned &quot;semé&quot;, which are usually depicted with a discrete number (often eight) of the charge. Thus for example the arms of Jesus College, Cambridge, which despite a blazon of &quot;seme&quot; are invariably depicted with either eight or ten &quot;crowns golde&quot; on its bordure. A large number (usually eight) of any one charge arranged as if upon an invisible bordure is said to be &quot;in orle&quot;, an orle being a diminutive band within the bordure.

Most small charges can be depicted as semé, e.g. &quot;semé of roses&quot;, &quot;semé of estoiles&quot;, and so forth. In English heraldry, several types of small charges have special terms to refer to their state as semé:

*semé of cross-crosslets: &quot;crusily&quot;
*semé of fleurs-de-lis: &quot;semé-de-lis&quot; or &quot;semy-de-lis&quot;
*semé of bezants: &quot;bezanté&quot;
*semé of plates (roundels argent): &quot;platé&quot;
*semé of torteaux (roundels gules): &quot;tortelly&quot;
*semé of billets: &quot;billeté&quot;/&quot;billetté&quot;/&quot;billetty&quot;
*semé of annulets: &quot;annulletty&quot;
*semé of sparks: &quot;étincellé&quot;
*semé of gouttes (&#x27;drops&#x27;, of liquid): &quot;goutté&quot; / &quot;gutté&quot;, with variants:
**gutté-de-sang (blood, &quot;gules&quot;)
**gutté-de-poix (pitch/bitumen, &quot;sable&quot;)
**gutté-d&#x27;eau (water, &quot;argent&quot;)
**gutté-de-larmes (tears, &quot;azure&quot;)
**gutté-d&#x27;olives or d&#x27;huile (olive oil, &quot;vert&quot;)

When a field semé is of a metal, the charges strewn on it must be of a colour, and vice versa, so as not to offend the rule of tincture.

In Cornish heraldry, the arms granted 1764 to a Hockin family are &quot;Per fesse wavy gules and azure a lion passant gardant or, beneath his feet a musket lying horizontally proper; and semé of fleur de lys of the third&quot; [emphasis added], alluding to an incident in which the marksmanship of a Cornish young man, Thomas Hockin, caused a boatload of French coastal raiders to scatter and flee back to their ship.

The 1995–2002 arms of Rogaška Slatina, Slovenia, show &quot;Vert, semee of disks or decreasing in size from base to chief&quot;.

The heraldic furs of the ermine family appear to be semé of the &quot;ermine spots&quot;, but they are not counted as such except when the tinctures of the spots and the field cannot be described as one of the four furs &quot;ermine&quot;, &quot;ermines&quot;, &quot;erminois&quot;, or &quot;pean&quot;.

== Masoned ==
A field or ordinary &quot;masoned&quot; shows a pattern like that of a brick or ashlar stone wall. This can be &quot;proper&quot; or of a named tincture. The tincture relates to the mortar between the stones or bricks: a wall of red bricks with white mortar is thus blazoned &quot;gules masoned argent&quot;.

== Honeycomb ==
The town of Viļāni, Latvia, has part of its field honeycombed. Another example of this is in the arms of Fusagasugá, Cundinamarca, Colombia.

== Folds ==
The arms of the Special Troops Battalion of the 2nd Brigade, 1st Cavalry Division of the United States Army has the unique field &quot;Per pale sable and gules with stylized folds sanguine&quot;, the sinister half of the field symbolizing a warrior&#x27;s cape.

== Pappellony ==
A field &quot;pappellony&quot; (French: , &#x27;butterfly&#x27;) shows a pattern like the wings of a butterfly, though this is categorised as a fur. The number of rows of pappellony are sometimes defined, such as seven in the arms of the Aleberici Family of Bologna. The ancient arms of the French Barons de Châteaubriant were &quot;Gules papellony or&quot;. The Italian term and the French , meaning &#x27;scaly&#x27;, are similar.

== Pied at random ==
Used in some South African coats, this means patterned like the piebald markings of various domesticated animals. There are other examples of South African heraldry that are more elaborately blazoned.

== Tapissé of wheat ==

A field &quot;tapissé of wheat&quot; is entirely covered (literally &#x27;carpeted&#x27;) by an interlocking stylised pattern looking like a wheat field.

== Diapering ==

In English heraldry, diapering, or covering areas of flat colour with a tracery design, is not considered a variation of the field; it is not specified in blazon, being a decision of the individual artist. A coat depicted with diapering is considered the same as a coat drawn from the same blazon but depicted without diapering.

In French heraldry, diapering is sometimes explicitly blazoned.

== Fretty and trellisé ==

A field &quot;fretty&quot; is composed of bendlets and bendlets-sinister or &quot;scarps&quot;, interleaved over one another to give the impression of a trellis. Although almost invariably the bendlets and scarpes are of the same tincture, there is an example in which they are of two different metals. It is rare for the number of pieces of the fretty to be specified, though this is sometimes done in French blazon. The bendlets and bendlets sinister are very rarely anything other than straight, as in the arms of David Robert Wooten, in which they are raguly. Objects can be placed in the position of the bendlets and bendlets sinister and described as &quot;fretty of&quot;, as in the arms of the Muine Bheag Town Commissioners: &quot;Party per fess or fretty of blackthorn branches leaved proper and ermine, a fess wavy azure&quot;. &quot;Square fretty&quot; is similarly composed of barrulets and pallets.

&quot;Trellisé&quot; appears in the arms of Luc-Normand Tellier, where it consists of &quot;bendlets, bendlets sinister, and barrulets&quot; interlaced. These are not, strictly speaking, variations of the field, since they are depicted as being on the field rather than in it.

==Blazoning of French adjectives==

Variations of the field present a particular problem concerning consistent spelling of adjectival endings in English blazons. Heraldry developed at a time when, subsequent to the Norman Conquest, English clerks wrote in Anglo-Norman French; consequently, many terms in English heraldry, as a distinct style of the craft, are of French origin, as is the practice of most adjectives being placed after nouns rather than, as is standard in English, before. A problem arises as to acceptable spellings of French words used in English blazons, especially in the case of adjectival endings, determined in normal French usage by gender and number. It is considered by some heraldic authorities as pedantry to adopt strictly correct French linguistic usage for English blazons. E.g. Cussans (1869):

Cussans adopted the convention of spelling all French adjectives in the masculine singular, without regard to the gender and number of the nouns they qualify; however, as he admitted, the more common convention was to spell all French adjectives in the feminine singular form, for example: &quot;a chief undée&quot; and &quot;a saltire undée&quot;, even though the French nouns &quot;chef&quot; and &quot;sautoir&quot; are in fact masculine.

<text>The Congressional Research Service (CRS) is a public policy research institute of the United States Congress. Operating within the Library of Congress, it works primarily and directly for members of Congress and their committees and staff on a confidential, nonpartisan basis. CRS is sometimes known as Congress&#x27; think tank due to its broad mandate of providing research and analysis on all matters relevant to national policymaking.

CRS has roughly 600 employees, who have a wide variety of expertise and disciplines, including lawyers, economists, historians, political scientists, reference librarians, and scientists. In the 2023 fiscal year, it was appropriated a budget of roughly $133.6 million by Congress.

Modeled after the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Bureau, CRS was founded during the height of the Progressive Era as part of a broader effort to professionalize the government by providing independent research and information to public officials. Its work was initially made available to the public, but between 1952 and 2018 was restricted only to members of Congress and their staff; non-confidential reports have since been accessible on its website. In 2019, CRS announced it was adding &quot;the back catalog of older CRS reports&quot; and also introducing new publicly available reports, such as its &quot;two-page executive level briefing documents&quot;.

CRS is one of three major legislative agencies that support Congress, along with the Congressional Budget Office (which provides Congress with budget-related information, reports on fiscal, budgetary, and programmatic issues, and analyses of budget policy options, costs, and effects) and the Government Accountability Office (which assists Congress in reviewing and monitoring the activities of government by conducting independent audits, investigations, and evaluations of federal programs). Collectively, the three agencies employ more than 4,000 people.

==History==
In 1914, Senator Robert La Follette Sr. and Representative John M. Nelson, both of Wisconsin, promoted the inclusion in the legislative, executive, and judicial appropriations act of a provision directing the establishment of a special reference unit within the Library of Congress. Building upon a concept developed by the New York State Library in 1890 and the Wisconsin Legislative Reference Library in 1901, they were motivated by Progressive Era ideas about the importance of the acquisition of knowledge for an informed and independent legislature. The move also reflected the expanding role of the librarian and the professionalization of the profession. The new department was charged with responding to congressional requests for information. The legislation authorized the librarian of Congress, Herbert Putnam, to &quot;employ competent persons to prepare such indexes, digests, and compilations of laws as may be required for Congress and other official use...&quot;

Renamed the Legislative Reference Service and given a permanent authorization with the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1946, it assisted Congress primarily by providing facts and publications and by transmitting research and analysis done largely by other government agencies, private organizations, and individual scholars. Verner W. Clapp headed the unit.

The Library of Congress, the home of CRS, had experimented during the 1940s with unrestricted publication &quot;Public Affairs Bulletins&quot;, which were produced by staff of the Legislative Reference Service, and devoted to various public policy issues. They were promoted by Archibald MacLeish, the librarian of Congress, and, among other topics, addressed timely policy issues, such as American national defense. About 100 &quot;Public Affairs Bulletins&quot; were generated before congressional appropriators ended their production in 1951.

The renaming under the Legislative Reorganization Act of 1970 reflected the service&#x27;s changing mission: This legislation directed CRS to devote more of its efforts and increased resources to doing research and analysis that assists Congress in direct support of the legislative process.

The &quot;Congressional Research Service Review&quot; launched in 1980 and continued until the early 1990s; then congressional appropriators, once again, invoked &quot;fiscal closure.&quot; The &quot;Review&quot; was published ten times a year and was available to the public by subscription. It offered analytical articles, summaries of CRS research products, and other assistance to the congressional community.

Inquiries increased from 400,000 questions per year in 1980 to 598,000 in 2000. CRS was reorganized in 1999 partly to handle the load, relocating staff, adopting more efficient workstations, and attempting to enable more communication across disciplinary specialists.

CRS reports were not generally available to the public until September 18, 2018, when a provision of the Consolidated Appropriations Act of 2018, which directed that CRS reports be available to the public, was implemented.

==Mission==
CRS offers Congress research and analysis on all current and emerging issues of national policy.
CRS offers timely and confidential assistance to all members and committees that request it, but this is limited only by CRS&#x27;s resources and the requirements for balance, nonpartisanship, and accuracy.

CRS makes no legislative or other policy recommendations to Congress; its responsibility is to ensure that Members of the House and Senate have available the best possible information and analysis on which to base the policy decisions the American people have elected them to make. In all its work, CRS analysts are governed by requirements for confidentiality, timeliness, accuracy, objectivity, balance, and nonpartisanship.

CRS services are not limited to those that relate directly to enacting new laws. For example, CRS attempts to assess emerging issues and developing problems so that it will be prepared to assist Congress if and when it becomes necessary. Although it rarely conducts field research, CRS assists committees in other aspects of their study and oversight responsibilities. In addition, it offers numerous courses, including legal research seminars and institutes on the legislative process, the budget processes, and the work of district and state staff. At the beginning of each Congress, CRS also provides an orientation seminar for new Members.

CRS does not conduct research on sitting Members or living former Members of Congress, unless granted specific permission by that Member or if the President nominates that Member for another office.

==Organization==
CRS is divided into six interdisciplinary research divisions, each of which is further divided into subject specialist sections. The six divisions are: American Law; Domestic Social Policy; Foreign Affairs, Defense and Trade; Government and Finance; Knowledge Services; and Resources, Science and Industry.

The six research divisions are supported in their work by five &quot;infrastructure&quot; offices: Finance and Administration, Information Management and Technology, Counselor to the Director, Congressional Information and Publishing, and Workforce Management and Development.

==Overview of services==
Responses to congressional requests take the form of reports, memoranda, customized briefings, seminars, videotaped presentations, information obtained from automated databases, and consultations in person and by telephone.

CRS &quot;supports the Members, committees, and leaders of the House and Senate at all stages of the legislative process&quot;:
* &quot;Ideas for legislation&quot;. A 2008 CRS report details how the service can assist legislators in evaluating the need for legislation:
At the preliminary stage, members may ask CRS to provide background information and analysis on issues and events to better understand the existing situation and then assess whether a problem requires a legislative remedy. This assistance may be a summary and explanation of the scientific evidence on a technically complex matter, for example, or it may be a collection of newspaper and journal articles discussing an issue from different perspectives, or a comparative analysis of several explanations that have been offered to account for a generally recognized problem. CRS also identifies national and international experts with whom Members and staff may consult about whatever issues concern them and sponsors programs at which Members meet with experts to discuss issues of broad interest to Congress.
* &quot;Analyzing a bill&quot;. The same 2008 report also clarifies the various ways in which the service further supports the work of legislators once a bill has been introduced:
If a Member decides to introduce a bill, CRS analysts can assist the legislator in clarifying the purposes of the bill, identifying issues it may address, defining alternative ways for dealing with them, evaluating the possible advantages and disadvantages of each alternative, developing information and arguments to support the bill, and anticipating possible criticisms of the bill and responses to them. Although CRS does not draft bills, resolutions, and amendments, its analysts may join staff consulting with the professional draftsman within each chamber&#x27;s Office of the Legislative Counsel as they translate the Member&#x27;s policy decisions into formal legislative language. Members and committees can also request CRS to help them assess and compare legislative proposals, including competing bills introduced by Members and proposals presented by executive branch officials, private citizens, and organizations. CRS can assess the various proposals&#x27; intent, scope, and limits.

The report goes on:
During committee and floor consideration, CRS can assist Representatives and Senators in several different ways, in addition to providing background information to assist Members in understanding the issues a bill addresses. CRS attorneys can help clarify the legal effects the bill may have. CRS policy analysts can work with members to decide whether to propose amendments and then make certain that their amendments are designed and phrased to achieve the desired results. CRS also can help Members prepare for the debate by providing data and other information that they can use to support the positions they have decided to take.
* &quot;Hearings&quot;. When a subcommittee selects a bill (or several bills on the same subject) for serious attention, it usually begins by conducting public hearings on one or more days at which executive branch officials, other Members of Congress, representatives of private organizations, and even individual citizens present their views on the bill&#x27;s merits. CRS analysts can assist in this process by providing background information and reports, presenting a preliminary briefing to Members or staff, identifying potential witnesses, and suggesting questions that Members may consider asking the witnesses.
* &quot;Subcommittee or committee votes&quot;. After the hearings on a bill, the subcommittee or committee meets to debate and vote on amendments to it. If requested, CRS staff may attend these meetings to serve as a nonpartisan source of expert information available to all Members. If the subcommittee and then the full committee conclude that new legislation is needed, they report a bill to the House or Senate for all its Members to consider. The committee also submits a written report explaining its decision&#x27;s background, analyzing the purposes and effects of each major provision of the bill, and includes other information, such as predictions about the cost of implementing it, that helps other Members decide whether they should support the bill. CRS specialists may assist the committee&#x27;s staff in preparing some sections of this report, although the Congressional Budget Office develops cost estimates.
* &quot;Parliamentary procedure&quot;. CRS staff can clarify the legislative procedures of the House and Senate, assisting Members and staff in understanding the effects of these procedures and how Members can use the procedures to promote their own legislative goals.
* &quot;Conference committees&quot;. CRS analysts can contribute to this last stage of the legislative process by helping identify the issues to be resolved, by clarifying and comparing the positions of the two houses on each issue, and by identifying different ways in which the legislative disagreements could be resolved.

CRS also performs several functions that support Congressional and public understanding of the legislative process and other issues.
* &quot;Bill Summaries&quot;. Since 1935, the Legislative Analysis and Information Section (formerly &quot;Bill Digest&quot;) of CRS has had statutory responsibility for the preparation of authoritative, objective, nonpartisan summaries of introduced public bills and resolutions and maintenance of historical legislative information. Detailed revised summaries are written to reflect changes made in the course of the legislative process. This CRS office also prepares titles, bill relationships, subject terms, and Congressional Record citations for debates, full texts of measures, and Member introductory remarks. The bill summaries are released to the public via THOMAS, the Library of Congress&#x27;s online database.
* &quot;Constitution Annotated&quot;. The American Law Division of the Congressional Research Service prepares &quot;The Constitution of the United States of America: Analysis and Interpretation&quot; (popularly known as the &quot;Constitution Annotated&quot;), a continually updated legal treatise that explains the U.S. Constitution as it has been interpreted by the U.S. Supreme Court.

==Congressional Research Service reports==
Reports by the Congressional Research Service, usually referred to as CRS Reports, are the encyclopedic research reports written to define issues in a legislative context clearly.

Over 700 new CRS reports are produced each year; 566 new products were prepared in Fiscal Year 2011. Nearly 7,800 were in existence as of the end of 2011.

The types of CRS reports include Issue Briefs (IB), Research Memos (RM), and Reports, which appear in both Short (RS) and Long (RL) formats.

Air War College of the United States Air Force published a categorical listing of CRS reports, last updated on May 13, 2011.

==Access to CRS reports==
 most CRS reports are available to the public through the official US Congress website crsreports.congress.gov. Older CRS report versions may be accessed from community-supported sources. Since as of September 18, 2018, the official US government website &quot;makes non-confidential reports available on its website&quot; alternative access sites are less needed.

Previously they were confidential. While not classified, they were exempt from Freedom of Information Act requests due to congressional privilege and, therefore, not readily accessible, nor was their authenticity easily verifiable. Prior to September 2018, CRS products were only made directly available to members of Congress, congressional committees, and CRS&#x27;s sister agencies (CBO and GAO) through the internal CRS Web system.

==Predecessors==
Other than a passing generic reference to &quot;reports&quot; in its statutory charter, CRS has no mandate for these products. They are created in the context of the overall mission of CRS to provide research support to Congress.

The Library of Congress, the home of CRS, had experimented during the 1940s with unrestricted publication &quot;Public Affairs Bulletins&quot;, which were produced by staff of the Legislative Reference Service, and devoted to various public policy issues. They were promoted by Archibald MacLeish, the librarian of Congress, and, among other topics, addressed timely policy issues, such as American national defense. About 100 &quot;Public Affairs Bulletins&quot; were generated before congressional appropriators ended their production in 1951.

When the &quot;Congressional Research Service Review&quot; was launched in 1980, it continued for a little more than a decade before congressional appropriators, once again, invoked fiscal closure with the last issue published v. 13 #9 (Sept. 1992). The &quot;Review&quot;, which was published ten times a year and available to the public by subscription, offered original analytical articles, summaries highlighting CRS research products, and other kinds of assistance to the congressional community.

==Copyright status==
&quot;The New York Times&quot; has written that the reports contain neither classified information nor copyrighted information.

However, in a passage analyzing its own liability under United States copyright law, the CRS has written that: 
However, the copyright permission obtained is usually understood to be for the purpose of legislative use by members of Congress.

Thus, persons seeking public domain content in CRS reports can avoid infringing copyright by paying attention to the internal citations.

==Appearance==
CRS written work products fall into three major categories:(1) Congressionally Distributed Products Providing Research and Analysis on Legislative Issues, (2) Responses to Individual Members and Committees, and (3) Legislative Summaries, Digests, and Compilations.

Congressionally Distributed Products Providing Research and Analysis on Legislative Issues itself is broken into two subcategories: Reports for Congress and Congressional Distribution Memoranda.

&quot;Reports for Congress&quot;: CRS often prepares reports for Congress, analyses, or studies on specific policy issues of legislative interest. These reports clearly define issues in legislative contexts. Analysts define and explain technical terms and concepts, frame the issues in understandable and timely contexts, and provide appropriate, accurate, and valid quantitative data. The content of the report is summarized on its first page. These reports may be updated as events occur, or archived when they no longer reflect the current legislative agenda but can provide background and historical context.

&quot;Congressional Distribution Memoranda&quot;: Similar to the reports, memoranda are prepared when the interest of a relatively small number of congressional readers is anticipated or when an issue is sufficiently transient that CRS deems it inappropriate to include it in its list of products. Memoranda can be recast as a report if it becomes important to a larger congressional audience.

Responses to Individual Members and Committees: CRS staff provide custom services for Members and committees and their staff, tailored to address specific questions, and usually in a memorandum format. Written documents include Confidential Memoranda, Email Responses, and Briefing Books.

&quot;Confidential Memoranda&quot;: Confidential memoranda are prepared to meet a specific congressional request and are often designed for a congressional reader with a high level of expertise in a given topic. These memoranda are prepared for the use of the requester and are not distributed by CRS to a larger audience unless the requester gives permission.

&quot;Email Responses&quot;: Email responses to request for information can range from providing a statistic or a name to a short briefing to an interactive discussion on a variety of issues.

&quot;Briefing Books&quot;: Prepared for use by congressional delegations traveling abroad, these books are collections of material that support the specific purposes of a congressional trip. Briefing books can include a variety of materials, such as maps, selected products, and brief tailored written work, all of which contain background and current issues regarding U.S. relations with specific countries on the trip as well as questions Members may ask when meeting with government or other officials.

Legislative Summaries, Digests, and Compilations: Since 1935, the Legislative Analysis and Information Section (formerly the &quot;Bill Digest&quot; section) of CRS has had the statutory responsibility for preparation of authoritative, objective, nonpartisan summaries of introduced public bills and resolutions and the maintenance of historical legislative information. Detailed revised summaries are written to reflect changes made in the course of the legislative process. This CRS office also prepares titles, bill relationships, subject terms, and &quot;Congressional Record&quot; citations for debates, full text of measures, and Member introductory remarks.

== Confidentiality of CRS Reports ==
The confidentiality status of Congressional Research Service reports, until September 18, 2018, was a matter of contention due to the lack of public access to research that was paid for by taxpayer money.

Congress had historically reserved to itself control over the dissemination of CRS products to the public on the principle that CRS, as an extension of congressional staff, works exclusively for the Congress: &quot;dissemination is limited to Members of Congress.&quot; From 1952 until 2018, a provision was included in CRS annual appropriations acts requiring approval by one of its two congressional oversight committees for acts of &quot;publication&quot; by the CRS.

The limitation began in the House as a flat prohibition on publications by the Library of Congress using funds appropriated to the Legislative Reference Service (now CRS). In 1954, a provision was added providing for exception only with the approval of our oversight committees.

===Unlocking CRS report access===
* 1978: The National Conference of State Legislatures (NCSL) issued a proposal under which CRS would have received access to the files of State research materials abstracted by the NCSL, and would have had the opportunity to order copies of desired items for use in answering congressional inquiries. In return, CRS would have provided the NCSL with periodic listings of CRS Reports (called &quot;multiliths&quot; at that time) and with only one copy of those CRS Reports which the NCSL requested. Under this proposal, the NCSL also would have gained access to certain files from the Library of Congress&#x27;s SCORPIO system, including CRS Issue Briefs. A congressional committee expressed the view that it was appropriate for Members of Congress, rather than CRS, to determine whether and to what extent various CRS products should be publicly disseminated. As a result, no action was taken to implement the proposed CRS-NCSL exchange.
* 1980: The Joint Committee on the Library released a policy statement regarding the publication of CRS written products: that said &quot;the long-standing policy of confidentiality in the work of CRS for individual congressional clients should be maintained&quot; and gave cost as part of its reason. A subsequent statement referred to &quot;the legislative process and ... the Speech or Debate Clause of the Constitution.&quot;
* 1990: Facing a challenge, the Senate Majority Leader reiterated the importance of &quot;protecting the work done by CRS in preparing communications to the Members and committees of Congress&quot;: and elaborated by noting &quot;A committee or Member of the Senate, of course, may determine to make available to the public a report or memorandum which the Congressional Research Service has provided to the committee or Senator... Nevertheless, ... it is important to protect the confidentiality of CRS&#x27;s preparatory work in order to encourage the freest possible exploration by CRS...&quot;
* 1998, 1999, 2001, 2003: Attempts were made by members of congress to pass legislation requiring the CRS to make its products available on a public website. All failed to pass.

Some members of congress used committee websites to disseminate individual reports, beginning in 1998. Senator Tom Daschle (D-SD) was the first to act, putting almost 300 CRS products on his website. They were subsequently removed.

Representatives Shays and Mark Green (R-WI) have placed many CRS products on their own websites in an attempt to make some CRS products available to the public.

&quot;Reports are produced by the Congressional Research Service staff for the education of members of Congress&quot;, Kyle Anderson, a spokesman for the House Administration Committee, which has jurisdiction over the issue in the House, wrote in an e-mail message to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;Just as other memos produced by staffers for members of Congress aren&#x27;t made public, these are not.&quot;

This was countered by a clarification saying that the goal was the public release of only reports the research service produces, not the memorandums it also writes for members of Congress. (Former) Senator Joseph I. Lieberman said in an e-mail message to &quot;The New York Times&quot;. &quot;These reports inform members of Congress and their staffs on a wide range of issues. The American people, who pay for these reports, should be able to learn from this same expert analysis.&quot;

===1997 CRS memorandum===
In a December 1997 memorandum, the CRS summarized the &quot;Legal Issues Presented by Proposals for the General Release of CRS Products to the Public&quot;:
* Speech and debate immunity: Reducing &quot;substantial role in the legislative process&quot;. Such proposals might &quot;cause the judiciary and administrative agencies to reassess their perception of CRS as playing a substantial role in the legislative process, and thereby might endanger a claim of [Speech and Debate Clause] immunity even in an instance in which CRS was fulfilling its legislative mission (e.g., by preparing a confidential memorandum for a Member on a pending bill.)&quot;
* Libel, slander, and defamation. CRS also believes that slander or libel actions might occur more frequently if CRS products were put on the Internet, because more people would read CRS products and know of their existence.
* Confidentiality of CRS files. CRS believes that broader dissemination of CRS products would likely inspire more litigants who wish to obtain, for purposes of discovery, the files of CRS analysts. This might, CRS argues, cause the public release of correspondence between Members of Congress and CRS.
* Copyright infringement. CRS argues that it might be subject to claims of copyright infringement if CRS products were available on the Internet. CRS sometimes incorporates copyrighted work into its reports and products. (Elsewhere, the CRS notes that these inclusions are always &quot;appropriately credited&quot;.)

===Responses to the 1997 CRS memorandum===
====Memorandum of Gary Ruskin====
On January 5, 1998, Gary Ruskin, Director of the Congressional Accountability Project, wrote a memorandum that disputed each of the arguments in the 1997 CRS memorandum.

====Letter of Stanley M. Brand====
On January 27, 1998, Stanley M. Brand, the former general counsel to the House of Representatives, wrote a letter to Senator John McCain:

(See also his letter addressing a 2001 reintroduction of the same legislation.)

John McCain cited this letter on the Senate floor when he was proposing an amendment to the Legislative Branch Appropriations Act 1999 that would direct the Director of the Congressional Research Service to post &#x27;CRS Reports to Congress&#x27; and &#x27;CRS Issue Briefs&#x27; on the Internet. In this speech, he also noted:

==Written work-product==
Document types include CRS reports, appropriations reports (usually released as long Reports), and congressional distribution memoranda.

===CRS reports===
The most commonly requested CRS product is the general congressional distribution reports, known as &quot;CRS reports&quot;. The purpose of a report is to clearly define the issue in the legislative context. The types of CRS reports include Issue Briefs (IB), Research Memos (RM), and Reports, which appear in both Short (RS) and Long (RL) formats.

Other than a passing generic reference to &quot;reports&quot; in its statutory charter, CRS has no mandate for these products. They are created in the context of the overall mission of CRS to provide research support to Congress.

The reports may take many forms, including policy analysis, economic studies, statistical reviews, and legal analyses.

CRS reports are considered in-depth, accurate, objective, and timely, and topped the list of the &quot;10 Most-Wanted Government Documents&quot; survey by the Center for Democracy and Technology in 1996.

<doc id="370779" wikidata="Q331383" url="?curid=370779" title="Overblowing">
<text>Overblowing is the manipulation of supplied air through a wind instrument that causes the sounded pitch to jump to a higher one without a fingering change or the operation of a slide. Overblowing may involve a change in the air pressure, in the point at which the air is directed, or in the resonance characteristics of the chamber formed by the mouth and throat of the player. (The latter is a feature of embouchure.)

In some instruments, overblowing involves the direct manipulation of the vibrating reed(s), and/or the pushing of a register key while otherwise leaving fingering unaltered. With the exception of harmonica overblowing, the pitch jump is from one vibratory mode of the reed or air column, e.g., its fundamental, to an overtone. Overblowing can be done deliberately in order to get a higher pitch, or inadvertently, resulting in the production of a note other than intended.

== Characteristics ==
In simple woodwind instruments, overblowing can cause the pitch to change into a different register. For example, a player of the tin whistle can play in the upper octave by blowing harder while using the same fingering as in the lower octave.

In brass instruments, overblowing (sometimes combined with tightening of the embouchure) produces a different harmonic.

In beating, or striking, reed wind instruments such as the saxophone, clarinet, and oboe, the transition from lower to higher register is aided by a &quot;register key&quot; which encourages a vibration node at a particular point in the pipe such that a higher harmonic is produced.

Another type of overblowing is that used on instruments such as the transverse flute, where the &quot;direction&quot; of the airstream is altered in order to sound higher notes. This technique can also be demonstrated when blowing across the top of a glass bottle (beer bottle, wine bottle, etc.) to produce a pitch.

&quot;Overblowing&quot; can also mean blowing too hard merely in order to hear oneself. For example, on a stage with amplified instruments and an inadequate monitoring system, a saxophone player may just blow harder than they would otherwise want to, the result being a worse sound and often worse intonation or unwanted overtones.

==Bagpipes==
Some bagpipes, most importantly the uilleann pipes, are capable of overblowing in the sense of jumping to a higher pitch, though most bagpipes are not normally played in this way. Among Highland pipers, the term more often refers to a problem affecting the steadiness and reliability of the pitch and tone caused by an excess of air pressure. When a piper plays, a rhythm is set up between blowing into the blowstick and squeezing the bag. Often, a piper will over-squeeze the bag while still exhaling, causing a pipe to cease to sound or to vary its tone and pitch.

==Harmonica==
Overblowing is an important modern technique among players of some harmonica types, notably the standard Richter-tuned harmonica or blues harp. Combined with note &quot;bending&quot;, it yields the full chromatic scale across the instrument&#x27;s range. Though pioneered on Richter-tuned harps, overblowing, or the related &quot;overdrawing&quot; thus together sometimes called &quot;overbending&quot; though not much related to bending per se, is possible on any harmonica having both a blow reed and a draw reed mounted in the same airway (i.e., behind the same mouthpiece hole), but no &quot;windsaver&quot; valve on the higher-pitched of the two reeds. While superficially resembling in its pitch-jumping effect the overblowing of other (beating-reed, aerophone, brass) wind instruments, harmonica overblowing is completely unrelated from the standpoint of the underlying physics. It does not induce the sounding reed to sound a higher overtone – free reed overtones do not even begin to approximate the harmonic series nor are they particularly musical – nor does it induce a higher vibrational mode in air in a pipe or other resonator – harmonicas generally have no such resonator. Rather, it silences the sounding reed while eliciting sound from the formerly silent one – the one that normally responds to air flowing in the opposite direction. A key fact for understanding both overblowing and &quot;bending&quot; on such an instrument: a free reed mounted over a reedplate slot will normally respond to air flows that pull it initially into the slot, i.e., as a &quot;closing reed&quot;, but, at only slightly higher air pressure from the opposite side, will also respond as an &quot;opening reed&quot;; the resulting pitch is generally just less than a semitone higher than the closing-reed pitch.

Overblown notes can be played as softly as any other note on the instrument. Proper embouchure alone will cause the closing reed to cease vibrating and induce the opening reed to start. Overblow notes are naturally flat but can be bent up to the correct pitch. An overblow consists of two steps: the closing reed must be choked (silenced), and the opening reed must be sounded. A clean overblow note requires that both of these steps be executed simultaneously. Overblowing technique also has been described as not much different from doing a blow bend, except on a draw-bend-only reed (holes 1–6), and doing a draw bend embouchure, except on a blow-bend-only reed (holes 7–10). The latter technique is also known as the &quot;overdraw&quot; due to the reversed airflow, and these techniques are sometimes collectively referred to as &quot;overbends&quot;.

Certain modifications to factory-built harmonicas can increase the sensitivity of the instrument and make overblows far easier to achieve. Lowering the reed gap (over the reedplate) and slightly narrowing reed slots (a process called &quot;embossing&quot;) are probably the most common customization methods used to set up overblow-friendly harmonicas. Because it involves both reeds in the chamber, overblowing is not possible on fully valved harmonicas such as the button chromatic.

Notable practitioners of overblowing are Howard Levy, a founding member of the Flecktones, Paulo Prot, Adam Gussow, Otavio Castro, Chris Michalek, Jason Ricci, and Carlos del Junco.

==Woodwinds==
In the case of the clarinet, the reed beats against its mouthpiece, opening and closing the instrument&#x27;s cylindrical closed tube to produce a tone. When the instrument is overblown, with or without the aid of its register key, the pitch is a twelfth higher. In the case of a saxophone, which has a similar mouthpiece-reed combination to the clarinet, or an oboe, where double reeds beat against each other, the conical bore of these instruments gives their closed tube the properties of an open tube; when overblown, the pitch jumps an octave higher. As for a flute, which does not have a reed, but rather is a reedless cylindrical instrument open at both ends, the pitch similarly increases by an octave.

==Pipe organ==
Some organ pipe ranks are designed to be overblown. For instance, a given pipe of the harmonic flute stop is twice the length of pipes of other stops designed to sound the same pitch. When such a pipe is overblown, it sounds a fundamental tone one octave higher than other pipes of its length. For instance, a harmonic flute pipe that is 16 feet long is designed to sound the same note as most 8-foot pipes.

<doc id="370782" wikidata="Q2044946" url="?curid=370782" title="Right to die">
<text>The right to die is a concept rooted in the belief that individuals have the autonomy to make fundamental decisions about their own lives, including the choice to end them or undergo voluntary euthanasia, central to the broader notion of health freedom. This right is often associated with cases involving terminal illnesses or incurable pain, where assisted suicide provides an option for individuals to exercise control over their suffering and dignity. 

The debate surrounding the right to die frequently centers on the question of whether this decision should rest solely with the individual or involve external authorities, highlighting broader tensions between personal freedom and societal or legal restrictions.

Religious views on the matter vary significantly, with some traditions such as Hinduism (&quot;Prayopavesa&quot;) and Jainism (&quot;Santhara&quot;), permitting non-violent forms of voluntary death, while others, including Catholicism, Islam, and Judaism, consider suicide a moral transgression.

==Ethics==

The preservation and value of life have led to many medical advancements when it comes to treating patients. New devices and the development of palliative care have allowed humans to live longer than before. Prior to these medical advancements and care, the lifespans of those who were unconscious, minimally unconscious, and in a vegetative state were short as they were unable to receive assistance with basic needs such as breathing and feeding. The advancement of medical technology raises the question about the quality of life of patients who are no longer conscious. For example, the right to self-determination questions the definition of quality and sanctity of life—if one had the right to live, then the right to die must follow suit. There are questions in ethics as to whether or not a right to die can coexist with a right to life. If it is argued that the right to life is inalienable, then it cannot be surrendered and therefore may be incompatible with a right to die. A second debate exists within bioethics over whether the right to die is universal, only applies under certain circumstances (such as terminal illness), or if it exists at all. It is also stated that &#x27;right to live&#x27; is not synonymous to &#x27;obligation to live.&#x27; From that point of view, the right to live can coexist with the right to die.

The right to die is supported and rejected by many. Arguments for this right include:

* If one had a right to live, then one must have the right to die, both on their terms.
* Death is a natural process of life thus there should not be any laws to prevent it if the patient seeks to end it.
* What we do at the end of our lives should not be of concern to others.
* If euthanasia is strictly controlled, we can avoid entering a slippery slope and prevent patients from seeking alternative methods which may not be legal.

Arguments against include:

* It can lead to a slippery slope; if we allow patients this right, it can expand and have dire consequences.
* Give rise to pressuring those to end their lives or the lives of others; ethically immoral by human and medical standards.
* &quot;Throwing away&quot; patients who are deemed no longer capable to be part of society.
* Decrease in palliative end-of-life care due to the expectation of terminal patients to exercise their right to die.

A court in the American state of Montana for example, has found that the right to die only applies to those with life-threatening medical conditions. Physician-assisted suicide advocate Ludwig Minelli, euthanasia expert Sean W. Asher, and bioethics professor Jacob M. Appel, in contrast, argue that &quot;all&quot; competent people have a right to end their own lives. Appel has suggested that the right to die is a test for the overall freedom of a given society. A professor in social work, Alexandre Baril, proposed to create an ethic of responsibility &quot;based on a harm-reduction, non-coercive approach to suicide. [He] suggest that assisted suicide should be an option for suicidal people.&quot; He argued that the voice of suicidal people is viewed as illegitimate and that there are &#x27;injunctions to live and to futurity&#x27; where suicidal subjects are oppressed and silenced. Baril suggests the word suicidism to describe the &quot;[...] oppressive system (stemming from non-suicidal perspectives) functioning at the normative, discursive, medical, legal, social, political, economic, and epistemic levels in which suicidal people experience multiple forms of injustice and violence [...]&quot; He suggests creating safer spaces and listening to suicidal people without forcing the &#x27;will to live&#x27; upon them.

The 1991 Patient Self-Determination Act passed by the US Congress at the request of the financial arm of Medicare does permit elderly Medicare/Medicaid patients (and by implication, all &quot;terminal&quot; patients) to prepare an advance directive in which they elect or choose to refuse life-extending and/or life-saving treatments as a means of shortening their lives and thus suffering unto certain death. Under the Act, the treatment refused in an advance directive does not have to be proved to be &quot;medically futile&quot; under some existing due-process procedure developed under state laws, such as TADA in Texas.

The right to die, also known as the right to death, is an ethical and legal concept that supports the freedom of a human being to end their life or undergo voluntary euthanasia. This right is generally associated with individuals suffering from a terminal illness or lacking the will to continue living, and it may allow them to terminate their own life, refuse life-prolonging treatment, or opt for assisted suicide or euthanasia. The question of who should be able to exercise this right is often central to the debate.

Some scholars and philosophers, such as David Benatar, approach this debate in terms of antinatalism. Since human beings do not have the power to act at the time of their birth, no one should have authority over a person&#x27;s decision to continue living or to die.

Supporters of the right to die often connect it to the idea that a person&#x27;s body and life belong solely to themselves, and they should have the freedom to dispose of them as they see fit, understanding that the right to life does not imply a duty or obligation to live. However, a legitimate state interest in preventing irrational suicides is typically opposed. For example, Avital Pilpel and Lawrence Amsel argue:

&quot;Contemporary advocates of rational suicide or the right to die generally demand, for reasons of rationality, that the decision to end one&#x27;s life be an autonomous choice of the individual (i.e., not due to pressure from doctors or family to &#x27;do what is right&#x27; and commit suicide), that the choice be &#x27;the best option in these circumstances&#x27; (desired by Stoics or utilitarians), as well as other natural conditions, such as the stability of the decision, the absence of impulsivity, the absence of mental illness, deliberation, etc.&quot;

==By country==

As of 2023, some forms of voluntary euthanasia are legal in Australia, Belgium, Canada, Colombia, Luxembourg, the Netherlands, New Zealand, Spain and Switzerland.

=== Australia ===

As euthanasia is a health issue, under the Australian constitution this falls to state and territory governments to legislate and manage.

Euthanasia was legal within the Northern Territory during parts of 1996–1997 as a result of the territory parliament passing Rights of the Terminally Ill Act 1995. As a territory and not a state, the federal government under Prime Minister John Howard amended the Northern Territory (Self-Government) Act 1978 (amongst others) to ensure that territories of Australia are no longer able to legislate on euthanasia. However, this was repealed in December 2022 with the passing of Restoring Territory Rights Act. The federal government is not able to legislate restrictions on health issues for the Australian states and territories in the same manner.

Voluntary assisted dying schemes have been in effect in the following states; Victoria since 19 June 2019, Western Australia since 1 July 2021, Tasmania since 23 October 2022, Queensland since 1 January 2023, and South Australia since 31 January 2023. New South Wales was the final state to pass legislation for assisted dying in May 2022, which went into effect on 28 November 2023.

=== Belgium ===

In 2002, the Belgian parliament legalized euthanasia.

=== Canada ===
In August 2011, a British Columbia Supreme Court judge requested to speed up a right to die lawsuit so that Gloria Taylor could have a doctor assist her in dying by suicide. She had Lou Gehrig&#x27;s disease. She died of an infection in 2012.

On February 6, 2015, the Supreme Court of Canada ruled that denying the right to assisted suicide was unconstitutional. The court&#x27;s ruling limits physician-assisted suicides to &quot;a competent adult person who clearly consents to the termination of life and has a grievous and irremediable medical condition, including an illness, disease or disability, that causes enduring suffering that is intolerable to the individual in the circumstances of his or her condition.&quot; The ruling was suspended for 12 months to allow the Canadian parliament to draft a new, constitutional law to replace the existing one. The court decision includes a requirement that there must be stringent limits that are &quot;scrupulously monitored.&quot; This will require the death certificate to be completed by an independent medical examiner, not the treating physician, to ensure the accuracy of reporting the cause of death. The Canadian Medical Association (CMA) reported that not all doctors were willing to assist in a patient&#x27;s death due to legal complications and went against what a physician stood for. Many physicians stated that they should have a voice when it comes to helping a patient end their life. However, the belief in late 2015 was that no physician would be forced to do so but the CMA was offering educational sessions to members as to the process that would be used.

On June 17, 2016, legislation passed both houses of the Parliament of Canada and received Royal Assent to allow euthanasia within Canada.

=== Colombia ===

On 20 May 1997, the Constitutional Court of Colombia decriminalised piety homicide, for terminally ill patients, stating that &quot;the medical author cannot be held responsible for the assisted suicide of a terminally ill patient&quot; and urged Congress to regulate euthanasia &quot;in the shortest time possible&quot;.

On 15 December 2014, the Constitutional Court had given the Ministry of Health and Social Protection 30 days to publish guidelines for the healthcare sector to use in order to guarantee terminally ill patients, with the wish to undergo euthanasia, their right to a dignified death.

=== Germany ===
In February 2020, the Federal Constitutional Court ruled that the right to personal identity in German constitutional law encompasses a right to self-determined death, which in turn contains a right to suicide. Notably, this right is not limited to terminally ill patients, instead finding its limits within the requirement for the choice to be autonomous. The ruling has sparked controversy, with opponents arguing that the ruling may enable peer pressure into assisted suicide.

=== India ===
Since 2018, the Supreme Court of India has legalized passive euthanasia in India during a case involving Aruna Shanbaug under strict conditions, namely that the patient&#x27;s consent (or relatives) is needed, and that the patient must be terminally ill or vegetative state.

=== Netherlands ===

The Netherlands legalized voluntary euthanasia in 2002. Under Dutch law, euthanasia and assisted suicide can only be performed by doctors, and that is only legal in cases of &quot;hopeless and unbearable&quot; suffering. In practice, this means that it is limited to those with serious and incurable medical conditions (including mental illness) and in considerable suffering like pain, hypoxia or exhaustion. Helping somebody to die by suicide without meeting the qualifications of the Dutch euthanasia law is illegal. These criteria concern the patient&#x27;s request, the patient&#x27;s suffering (unbearable), the infaust prognosis (hopeless), the information provided to the patient, the absence of reasonable alternatives, consultation of another physician and the applied method of ending life.

===New Zealand===

Euthanasia is legal in New Zealand. In 2015, a lawyer with cancer Lecretia Seales brought a case (&quot;Seales v Attorney-General&quot;) to the High Court to challenge New Zealand law for her right to die with the assistance of her GP, asking for a declaration that her GP would not risk conviction. However legislation to legalize euthanasia for terminally ill patients was voted upon in the 2020 general election and was voted in favour of legalisation. The End Of Life Choice Bill took effect on 7 November 2021.

===Peru===
Peru legally forbids euthanasia. In 2020, a legal challenge to the law was launched by Ana Estrada, aimed at decriminalizing the practice.

=== United States ===
The term &quot;right to die&quot; has been interpreted in many ways, including issues of suicide, passive euthanasia, active euthanasia, assisted suicide, and physician-assisted suicide.

In the United States, public support for the right to die by physician-assisted suicide has increased over time. In a 2005 survey, the Pew Research Center found that 70% of participants say that there are circumstances in which a patient should be allowed to die; however, only 46% of participants approved of laws permitting doctors to assist patients in ending their lives. In May 2018, a Gallup poll report announced that 72% of responders said that doctors should legally be allowed to help terminally ill patients die. However, framing effects of using language such as &quot;suicide&quot; rather than &quot;ending one&#x27;s life&quot; have the potential to lower approval rates by 10-15%.

A 2014 survey of physicians revealed that 54% of respondents agreed that physician-assisted suicide should be allowed. In a rigorous survey of physicians in 1996, less than 20% of physicians reported that they received requests from patients to be euthanized, and less than 5% complied. In 2020, the Oregon Death with Dignity Act data summary revealed that the number of prescriptions for lethal doses of medications increased by 25% since 2019, and have been steadily increasing since 1998. Of patients who received these prescriptions, 66% eventually died from ingesting the medications.

==== Major right to die cases ====

=====Karen Quinlan=====
The right to die movement in the United States began with the case of Karen Quinlan in 1975 and continues to raise bioethical questions about one&#x27;s quality of life and the legal process of death. Quinlan, 21, lost consciousness after consuming alcohol and tranquilizers at a party. She soon began to experience respiratory problems, which then prevented oxygen from flowing to her brain. That led her to slip into a comatose state in which a respirator and a feeding tube were used to keep her alive and breathing. Quinlan did not have a proxy or living will and had not expressed her wishes if something ever happened to her to those around her, which made it difficult to decide what the next step should be.

Quinlan&#x27;s parents understood that their daughter would never wake up and that prolonging her life may be more damaging and it would not be of quality life. Her father sought out the right to be Quinlan&#x27;s legal guardian and petitioned for the removal of the respirator that was keeping her alive. The court, however, argued that the removal of the ventilator, which would lead to Quinlan&#x27;s death, would be considered unlawful, unnatural, and unethical. Quinlan&#x27;s lawyer made the counterargument that the removal of the respirator would allow Quinlan to have a natural death, which is natural and ethical. The Quinlans won the court case and were appointed as the legal guardians of their daughter. The respirator was removed in 1976, but Quinlan continued to live without the ventilator until 1985. The case continues to raise bioethical questions of one&#x27;s quality of life and the legal process of death. It also brings up many important issues that are still being addressed to this day. One of the critical points that the Quinlan case brings up is the patient&#x27;s right to deny or withdraw treatment. Cases in which the patient rejected or withdrew treatment were then unheard of and went against medical ethics in preserving one&#x27;s life. Debates on allowing patients the right to self-determination were controversial, and they would be evaluated for the next couple of decades from state to state. The case also brought up whether family members and those who are close to the patient are allowed in the decision-making process. Since Quinlan had no written documentation, voiced no decision, and appointed no proxy, a lengthy legal battle was caused between the Quinlan family and the state in determining Quinlan&#x27;s best interest and determining if she would want to live or die. That had a significant influence on the use and establishment of advance directives, oral directives, proxies, and living wills.

=====Nancy Cruzan=====
Another major case that further propagated the right to die movement and the use of living wills, advance directives and use of a proxy was &quot;Cruzan v. Director, Missouri Department of Health&quot;. In 1983, Cruzan had a car accident, which left her permanently in a vegetative state. Her status as an adult and lack of an advance directive, living will, or proxy led to a long legal battle for Cruzan&#x27;s family in petitioning for the removal of her feeding tube, which was keeping her alive since the accident. Cruzan had mentioned to a friend that under no circumstances would she want to continue to live if she were ever in a vegetative state, but this was not a strong enough statement to remove the feeding tube. Eventually, the Cruzan family won the case and had their daughter&#x27;s tube removed. The case brought great debate if the right to die should be approved from state to state or as a whole nation.

=====Terri Schiavo=====
The Terri Schiavo case occurred between 1990 and 2005. This case was controversial due to a disagreement between Schiavo&#x27;s immediate family members and her husband. In the Quinlan and Cruzan cases, the family was able to make a unanimous decision on the state of their daughters. Schiavo suffered from a cardiac arrest which led to her collapse and soon after began to have trouble breathing. The lack of oxygen to her brain caused irreversible brain damage, leaving her in a vegetative state and required a feeding tube and ventilator to keep her alive. Schiavo left no advance directive or had a discussion with her parents or husband about what she may have wanted if something were to happen to her. Soon after, her husband was appointed as her legal guardian.

Years later, her husband decided to remove Schiavo&#x27;s feeding tube since the chances of her waking up were slim to none. Schiavo&#x27;s family, however, argued against this decision and brought this case to court. The case was very turbulent and occurred over some years and involved the state and its legislators before a decision was made. This brought up bioethical debates on the discontinuation of Schiavo&#x27;s life vs. allowing her to continue living in a permanent vegetative state. Those who were for preserving Schiavo&#x27;s life stated that removing the tube would be ethically immoral since they do not know what she would have wanted. They challenged her physical and mental state and stated that she might have some consciousness; thus she deserved to continue living. Those for removing the tube argued for self-determination and that her quality of life was diminished. The Schiavo case is the most recent and significant right to die case that propagates the thought of having an advance directive or living will. It also further looks into other complications that can arise, such as family disagreements, which should have been accounted for when dealing with a right to die case.

==== Legislation ====
As the health of citizens is considered a police power left for individual states to regulate, it was not until 1997 that the US Supreme Court made a ruling on the issue of assisted suicide and one&#x27;s right to die. That year, the Supreme Court heard two appeals arguing that New York (&quot;Vacco v. Quill&quot;) and Washington (&quot;Washington v. Glucksberg&quot;) statutes that made physician-assisted suicide a felony violated the equal protection clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. In a unanimous vote, the Court held that there was no constitutional right to physician-assisted suicide and upheld state bans on assisted suicide. While in New York has maintained statutes banning physician-assisted suicide, the Court&#x27;s decision also left it open for other states to decide whether they would allow physician-assisted suicide or not.

Since 1994, the following states in the US have passed assisted suicide laws: Oregon (Death with Dignity Act, 1994), Washington (Death with Dignity Act, 2008), Vermont (Patient Choice and Control at the End of Life Act, 2013), California (End of Life Option Act, 2015), Colorado (End of Life Options Act, 2016), District of Columbia (D.C. Death with Dignity Act, 2016), Hawaii (Our Care Our Choice Act, 2018), Maine (Death with Dignity Act, 2019), New Jersey (Aid in Dying for the Terminally Ill Act, 2019), and New Mexico (Elizabeth Whitefield End of Life Options Act, 2021) passed legislation that provides a protocol for the practice of physician-assisted suicide. The law in these states allows terminally ill adult patients to seek lethal medication from their physicians. In 2009, the Montana Supreme Court ruled that nothing in state law prohibits physician-assisted suicide and provides legal protection for physicians in the case that they prescribe lethal medication upon patient request. In California, the governor signed a controversial physician-assisted-suicide bill, the California End of Life Option Act, in October 2015 that passed during a special legislative session intended to address Medi-Cal funding, after it had been defeated during the regular legislative session.

In early 2014, New Mexico Second District Judge Nan Nash ruled that terminally ill patients have the right to aid in dying under the state constitution, i.e., making it legal for a doctor to prescribe a lethal dose of medication to a terminally ill patient. The ultimate decision will be made with the outcome of New Mexico&#x27;s Attorney General&#x27;s appeal to the ruling. Organizations have been continuously pushing for the legalization of self-determination in terminally ill patients in states where the right to end one&#x27;s life is prohibited.

Medical Perspective

The American Medical Association (AMA) is the national association that advocates for physicians and provides guidance for the best practices for delivering health care. The AMA is responsible for maintaining the Code of Ethics, which consists of two parts: the Principles of Medical Ethics and Opinions of the AMA&#x27;s Council on Ethical and Judicial Affairs. The role of physicians in patient&#x27;s right to die is debated within the medical community, however, the AMA provided an opinion statement on the matter.

Opinion statement regarding physician-assisted suicide

Patients who are terminally ill or suffering from debilitating illnesses may decide that they prefer to die rather than continue suffering. Physicians commit themselves to &quot;do no harm&quot; and by participating in assisted suicide physicians would inherently be causing harm to their patients. Rather than participating in assisted suicide, physicians should provide palliative care to minimize patient suffering. These are recommendations for physicians from the Code of Medical Ethics Opinion 5.7 regarding end of life care:

* Should not abandon a patient once it is determined that a cure is impossible.
* Must respect patient autonomy.
* Must provide good communication and emotional support.
* Must provide appropriate comfort care and adequate pain control.

==Religion==

Hinduism accepts the right to die for those who are tormented by terminal diseases or those who have no desire, no ambition, and no responsibilities remaining. Death is allowed by non-violent means such as fasting to the point of starvation (Prayopavesa). Jainism has a similar practice named &quot;Santhara&quot;. Other religious views on suicide vary in their tolerance and include denial of the right as well as condemnation of the act. In the Catholic faith, suicide is considered a grave sin.

<text>John Fulton Reynolds (September 21, 1820 – July 1, 1863) was a career United States Army officer and a general in the American Civil War. One of the Union Army&#x27;s most respected senior commanders, he played a key role in committing the Army of the Potomac to the Battle of Gettysburg and was killed at the start of the battle.

==Early life and career==
Reynolds was born in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, one of nine surviving children of John Reynolds (1787–1853) and Lydia Moore Reynolds (1794–1843). Two of his brothers were James LeFevre Reynolds, Quartermaster General of Pennsylvania, and Rear Admiral William Reynolds. Prior to his military training, Reynolds studied in nearby Lititz, about from his home in Lancaster. Next he attended a school in Long Green, Maryland, and finally the Lancaster County Academy.

Reynolds was nominated to the United States Military Academy in 1837 by Senator James Buchanan, a family friend, and graduated 26th of 50 cadets in the class of 1841. He was commissioned a brevet second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Artillery, assigned to Fort McHenry. From 1842 to 1845 he was assigned to St. Augustine, Florida, and Fort Moultrie, South Carolina, before joining Zachary Taylor&#x27;s army at Corpus Christi, Texas, for the Mexican–American War. He was awarded two brevet promotions in Mexico – to captain for gallantry at Monterrey and to major for Buena Vista, where his section of guns prevented the Mexican cavalry from outflanking the American left. During the war, he became friends with fellow officers Winfield Scott Hancock and Lewis A. Armistead.

On his return from Mexico, Reynolds was assigned to Fort Preble, Maine; New Orleans, Louisiana; and Fort Lafayette, New York. He was next sent west to Fort Orford, Oregon, in 1855, and participated in the Rogue River Wars of 1856 and the Utah War with the Mormons in 1857–58. He was the Commandant of Cadets at West Point from September 1860 to June 1861, while also serving as an instructor of artillery, cavalry, and infantry tactics. During his return from the West, Reynolds became engaged to Katherine May Hewitt. Since they were from different religious denominations – Reynolds was a Protestant, Hewitt a Catholic – the engagement was kept a secret and Hewitt&#x27;s parents did not learn about it until after Reynolds&#x27; death.

==Civil War==

===Early assignments and the Seven Days===

Soon after the start of the Civil War, Reynolds was offered the position as aide-de-camp to Lt. Gen. Winfield Scott, but declined. He was appointed lieutenant colonel of the 14th U.S. Infantry, but before he could engage with that unit, he was promoted to brigadier general on August 20, 1861, and ordered to report to Washington, D.C. While in transit, his orders were changed to report to Cape Hatteras Inlet, North Carolina. Maj. Gen. George B. McClellan intervened with the Secretary of War to get his orders changed once again, assigning him to the newly formed Army of the Potomac. His first assignment was with a board that examined the qualifications of volunteer officers, but he soon was given command of a brigade of Pennsylvania Reserves.

As McClellan&#x27;s army moved up the Virginia Peninsula in the 1862 Peninsula Campaign, Reynolds occupied and became military governor of Fredericksburg, Virginia. His brigade was then ordered to join the V Corps at Mechanicsville, just before the start of the Seven Days Battles. The brigade was hit hard by the Confederate attack of June 26 at the Battle of Beaver Dam Creek, but their defensive line held and Reynolds later received a letter of commendation from his division commander, Brig. Gen. George A. McCall.

The Confederate attack continued on June 27 and Reynolds, exhausted from the Battle of Gaines&#x27; Mill and two days without sleep, was captured in Boatswain&#x27;s Swamp, Virginia. Thinking he was in a place of relative safety, he fell asleep and was not aware that his retreating troops left him behind. He was extremely embarrassed when brought before the Confederate general of the capturing troops; D.H. Hill was an Army friend and colleague from before the war. Hill allegedly told him, &quot;Reynolds, do not feel so bad about your capture, it is the fate of wars.&quot; Reynolds was transported to Richmond and held at Libby Prison, but was quickly exchanged on August 15 (for Lloyd Tilghman).

===Second Bull Run, Fredericksburg, and Chancellorsville===

Upon his return, Reynolds was given command of the Pennsylvania Reserves Division, whose commander, George A. McCall, had been captured just two days after Reynolds. The V Corps joined the Army of Virginia, under Maj. Gen. John Pope, at Manassas. On the second day of the Second Battle of Bull Run, while most of the Union Army was retreating, Reynolds led his men in a last-ditch stand on Henry House Hill, site of the great Union debacle at First Bull Run the previous year. Waving the flag of the 2nd Reserves regiment, he yelled, &quot;Now boys, give them the steel, charge bayonets, double quick!&quot; His counterattack halted the Confederate advance long enough to give the Union Army time to retreat in a more orderly fashion, arguably the most important factor in preventing its complete destruction.

At the request of Pennsylvania Governor Andrew G. Curtin, Reynolds was given command of the Pennsylvania Militia during General Robert E. Lee&#x27;s invasion of Maryland. Generals McClellan and Joseph Hooker complained that &quot;a scared governor ought not to be permitted to destroy the usefulness of an entire division,&quot; but the governor prevailed and Reynolds spent two weeks in Pennsylvania drilling old men and boys, missing the Battle of Antietam. However, he returned to the Army of the Potomac in late 1862 and assumed command of the I Corps. One of his divisions, commanded by Maj. Gen. George G. Meade, made the only breakthrough at the Battle of Fredericksburg, but Reynolds did not reinforce Meade with his other two divisions and the attack failed; Reynolds did not receive a clear understanding from Maj. Gen. William B. Franklin about his role in the attack. After the battle, Reynolds was promoted to major general of volunteers, with a date of rank of November 29, 1862.

At the Battle of Chancellorsville in May 1863, Reynolds clashed with Maj. Gen. Hooker, his predecessor at I Corps, but by this time the commander of the Army of the Potomac. Hooker originally placed the I Corps on the extreme left of the Union line, southeast of Fredericksburg, hoping to threaten and distract the Confederate right. On May 2, Hooker changed his mind and ordered the corps to conduct a daylight march nearly 20 miles to swing around and become the extreme right flank of the army, to the northwest of the XI Corps. The march was delayed by faulty communications and by the need to move stealthily to avoid Confederate contact. Thus, the I Corps was not yet in position when the XI Corps was surprised and overrun by Lt. Gen. Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson&#x27;s flank attack, a setback that destroyed Hooker&#x27;s nerve for offensive action. Hooker called a council of war on May 4 in which Reynolds voted to proceed with the battle, but although the vote was three to two for offensive action, Hooker decided to retreat. Reynolds, who had gone to sleep after giving his proxy vote to Meade, woke up and muttered loud enough for Hooker to hear, &quot;What was the use of calling us together at this time of night when he intended to retreat anyhow?&quot; The 17,000-man I Corps was not engaged at Chancellorsville and suffered only 300 casualties during the entire campaign.

Reynolds joined several of his fellow officers in urging that Hooker be replaced, in the same way he had spoken out against Maj. Gen. Ambrose Burnside after Fredericksburg. On the previous occasion, Reynolds wrote in a private letter, &quot;If we do not get some one soon who can command an army without consulting &#x27;Stanton and Halleck&#x27; at Washington, I do not know what will become of this Army.&quot; President Abraham Lincoln met with Reynolds in a private interview on June 2 and is believed to have asked him whether he would consider being the next commander of the Army of the Potomac. Reynolds supposedly replied that he would be willing to accept only if he were given a free hand and could be isolated from the political influences that had affected the Army commanders throughout the war. Unable to comply with his demands, Lincoln promoted the more junior George G. Meade to replace Hooker on June 28.

===Gettysburg===

On the morning of July 1, 1863, Reynolds was commanding the &quot;left wing&quot; of the Army of the Potomac, with operational control over the I, III, and XI Corps, and Brig. Gen. John Buford&#x27;s cavalry division. Buford occupied the town of Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, and set up light defensive lines north and west of the town. He resisted the approach of two Confederate infantry brigades on the Chambersburg Pike until the nearest Union infantry, Reynolds&#x27; I Corps, began to arrive. Reynolds rode out ahead of the 1st Division, met with Buford, and then accompanied some of his soldiers, probably from Brig. Gen. Lysander Cutler&#x27;s brigade, into the fighting at Herbst&#x27;s Woods. Troops began arriving from Brig. Gen. Solomon Meredith&#x27;s Iron Brigade, and as Reynolds was supervising the placement of the 2nd Wisconsin, he yelled at them, &quot;Forward men forward for God&#x27;s sake and drive those fellows out of those woods.&quot; At that moment he fell from his horse with a wound in the back of the upper neck, or lower head, and died almost instantly. Command passed to his senior division commander, Maj. Gen. Abner Doubleday.
The loss of General Reynolds was keenly felt by the army. He was loved by his men and respected by his peers. There are no recorded instances of negative comments made by his contemporaries. Historian Shelby Foote wrote that many considered him &quot;not only the highest ranking but also the best general in the army.&quot; His death had a more immediate effect that day, however. By ratifying Buford&#x27;s defensive plan and engaging his I Corps infantry, Reynolds essentially selected the location for the Battle of Gettysburg for Meade, turning a chance meeting engagement into a massive pitched battle, committing the Army of the Potomac to fight on that ground with forces that were initially numerically inferior to the Confederates that were concentrating there. In the command confusion that followed Reynolds&#x27; death, the two Union corps that reached the field were overwhelmed and forced to retreat through the streets of Gettysburg to the high ground south of town, where they were rallied by his old friend, Maj. Gen. Winfield S. Hancock.
Reynolds&#x27; body was immediately transported from Gettysburg to Taneytown, Maryland, and then to his birthplace, Lancaster, Pennsylvania, where he was buried on July 4, 1863. Befitting his importance to the Union and his native state, he is memorialized by three statues in Gettysburg National Military Park (an equestrian statue on McPherson Ridge, one by John Quincy Adams Ward in the National Cemetery, and one on the Pennsylvania Memorial), as well as one in front of the Philadelphia City Hall.

Katherine Hewitt had agreed with Reynolds that if he were killed in the war and they could not marry, she would join a convent. After he was buried, she traveled to Emmitsburg, Maryland, and joined the St. Joseph Central House of the Order of the Daughters of Charity.

===Death controversies===

Historians disagree on the details of Reynolds&#x27; death, including the specific time (either 10:15 a.m. or 10:40–10:50 a.m.), the exact location (on East McPherson Ridge, near the 2nd Wisconsin Infantry, or West McPherson Ridge, near the 19th Indiana), and the source of the bullet (a Confederate infantryman, a Confederate sharpshooter, or friendly fire). One primary source was Sergeant Charles Henry Veil, his orderly and unit Color Guard, who described the events in a letter in 1864 and then contradicted some of the details in another letter 45 years later. A letter from Reynolds&#x27; sister, Jennie, stated that the wound had a downward trajectory from the neck, implying that he was shot from above, presumably a sharpshooter in a tree or barn. Historians Bruce Catton and Glenn Tucker make firm assertions that a sharpshooter was responsible; Stephen Sears credits volley fire from the 7th Tennessee against the 2nd Wisconsin; Edwin Coddington cites the sister&#x27;s letter and finds the sharpshooter theory to be partly credible, but leans towards Sears&#x27; conclusion; Harry W. Pfanz agrees that the location was behind the 2nd Wisconsin, but makes no judgment about the source of the fire. Steve Sanders, writing in &quot;Gettysburg&quot; magazine, suggested the possibility of friendly fire based on some accounts, and concludes that it is as equally likely as enemy fire.

==Legacy==
There was a John F. Reynolds Middle School in the School District of Lancaster (PA) named in his honor. Reynolds plays a role in Michael Shaara&#x27;s 1974 Pulitzer Prize winning novel &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;, as well as the 1993 film based on that novel, &quot;Gettysburg&quot; (in which he was played by John Rothman). The film portrays Reynolds as being deliberately targeted by a Confederate sharpshooter, a scene based on the Don Troiani painting of the event. Reynolds is also significant in the prequel to &quot;The Killer Angels&quot;, Jeffrey Shaara&#x27;s novel &quot;Gods and Generals&quot;, although his role was deleted from the 2003 film based on the novel. Scholar Brian Reynolds Myers is a relative of Reynolds, his middle name a reference to him.

<text>Savant syndrome ( , ) is a phenomenon where someone demonstrates exceptional aptitude in one domain, such as art or mathematics, despite significant social or intellectual impairment. 
Those with the condition generally have a neurodevelopmental condition, such as autism, or have experienced a brain injury. About half of cases are associated with autism, and these individuals may be known as autistic savants. The other half often have some form of central nervous system injury or disease. While the condition usually becomes apparent in childhood, some cases develop later in life. It is not recognized as a mental disorder within the Diagnostic and Statistical Manual of Mental Disorders, Fifth Edition (DSM-5), as it relates to parts of the brain healing or restructuring.
Savant syndrome is estimated to affect around one in a million people. The condition affects more males than females, at a ratio of 6:1. The first medical account of the condition was in 1783. It is estimated that between 0.5% and 10% of those with autism have some form of savant abilities. It is estimated that fewer than one hundred prodigious savants are currently living, with skills so extraordinary that they would be considered spectacular even among unimpaired individuals.

==Signs and symptoms==

Savant skills are usually found in one or more of five major areas: art, memory, arithmetic, musical abilities, and spatial skills. The most common kinds of savants are calendrical savants, &quot;human calendars&quot; who can calculate the day of the week for any given date with speed and accuracy, or recall personal memories from any given date. Advanced memory is the key &quot;superpower&quot; in savant abilities.

===Calendrical savants===
A (or ) is someone who – despite having an intellectual disability – can name the day of the week of a date, or vice versa, on a limited range of decades or certain millennia. The rarity of human calendar calculators is possibly due to the lack of motivation to develop such skills among the general population, although mathematicians have developed algorithms that allow them to obtain similar skills. Calendrical savants, on the other hand, may not be prone to invest in socially engaging skills.

==Mechanism==
===Psychological===
No widely accepted cognitive theory explains savants&#x27; combination of talent and deficit. It has been suggested that individuals with autism are biased towards detail-focused processing and that this cognitive style predisposes individuals either with or without autism to savant talents. Another hypothesis is that savants hyper-systemize, thereby giving an impression of talent. Hyper-systemizing is an extreme state in the empathizing–systemizing theory that classifies people based on their skills in empathizing with others versus systemizing facts about the external world. Also, the attention to detail of savants is a consequence of enhanced perception or sensory hypersensitivity in these unique individuals. It has also been hypothesized that some savants operate by directly accessing deep, unfiltered information that exists in all human brains that is not normally available to conscious awareness.

===Neurological===
In some cases, savant syndrome can be induced following severe head trauma to the left anterior temporal lobe. Savant syndrome has been artificially replicated using low-frequency transcranial magnetic stimulation to temporarily disable this area of the brain.

==Epidemiology==

There are no objectively definitive statistics about how many people have savant skills. The estimates range from &quot;exceedingly rare&quot; to one in ten people with autism having savant skills in varying degrees. A 2009 British study of 137 parents of autistic children found that 28% believe their children met the criteria for a savant skill, defined as a skill or power &quot;at a level that would be unusual even for &#x27;normal&#x27; people&quot;. As many as 50 cases of sudden or acquired savant syndrome have been reported.

Males diagnosed with savant syndrome outnumber females by roughly 6:1 (in Finland), slightly higher than the sex ratio disparity for autism spectrum disorders of 4.3:1.

==History==
The term (French for &#x27;learned idiot&#x27;) was first used to describe the condition in 1887 by John Langdon Down, who is known for his description of Down syndrome. Down described approximately ten cases of youth he had known with unusual mental powers, like &quot;verbal adhesion&quot; (eg. memorizing books read once), photographic memory for artistic drawing or model-building or music, autobiographical memory, arithmetic &amp; calendrical calculation, &amp; always knowing the current time down to the minute. Down noted that they were all male, none had a family history of similar talents, and that the extraordinary memory was usually associated with &quot;very great defect of reasoning power&quot;. 

The term &quot;idiot savant&quot; was later described as a misnomer because not all reported cases fit the definition of idiot, originally used for a person with a very severe intellectual disability. The term was also used as a description of the disorder. Like &quot;idiot savant&quot;, the term came to be considered a misnomer because only half of those who were diagnosed with savant syndrome were autistic. Upon realization of the need for accuracy of diagnosis and dignity towards the individual, the term &quot;savant syndrome&quot; became widely accepted terminology.

<text>Isoelectronicity is a phenomenon observed when two or more molecules have the same structure (positions and connectivities among atoms) and the same electronic configurations, but differ by what specific elements are at certain locations in the structure. For example, , , and are isoelectronic, while and = are not. 

This definition is sometimes termed valence isoelectronicity. Definitions can sometimes be not as strict, sometimes requiring identity of the total electron count and with it the entire electronic configuration. More usually, definitions are broader, and may extend to allowing different numbers of atoms in the species being compared.

The importance of the concept lies in identifying significantly related species, as pairs or series. Isoelectronic species can be expected to show useful consistency and predictability in their properties, so identifying a compound as isoelectronic with one already characterised offers clues to possible properties and reactions. Differences in properties such as electronegativity of the atoms in isolelectronic species can affect reactivity.

In quantum mechanics, hydrogen-like atoms are ions with only one electron such as . These ions would be described as being isoelectronic with hydrogen.

==Examples==

The atom and the ion are isoelectronic because each has five valence electrons, or more accurately an electronic configuration of [He] 2s2 2p3.

Similarly, the cations , , and and the anions , , and are all isoelectronic with the atom. 

, , , and are isoelectronic because each has two atoms triple bonded together, and due to the charge have analogous electronic configurations ( is identical in electronic configuration to so is identical electronically to ).

Molecular orbital diagrams best illustrate isoelectronicity in diatomic molecules, showing how atomic orbital mixing in isoelectronic species results in identical orbital combination, and thus also bonding.

More complex molecules can be polyatomic also. For example, the amino acids serine, cysteine, and selenocysteine are all isoelectronic to each other. They differ by which specific chalcogen is present at one location in the side-chain.

 (acetone) and (azomethane) are not isoelectronic. They do have the same number of electrons but they do not have the same structure.

<doc id="370789" wikidata="Q3921804" url="?curid=370789" title="Primero">
<text>Primero (in English also called Primus, in French &#x27;, in Italian&#x27; or in Spanish &quot;Primera&quot;), is a 16th-century gambling card game of which the earliest reference dates back to 1526. Primero is closely related to the game of primo visto (a.k.a. prima-vista, and various other spellings), if not the same. It is also believed to be one of the ancestors to the modern game of poker, to which it is strikingly similar.

The gambling game with this name goes back to the 16th century, being known to Gerolamo Cardano as &#x27;, which he thought of as the noblest of all card games, to [[François Rabelais]] as&#x27;, and to William Shakespeare as primero.

== The origins of Primero ==

It is uncertain if Primero is of Spanish or Italian origin. Although Daines Barrington is of the opinion that it is of Spanish origin, a poem of Francesco Berni is the earliest known writing to mention the game; it affords proof that it was at least commonly played in Italy at the beginning of the 16th century. His work entitled &quot;Capitolo del Gioco della Primiera&quot;, published in Rome in 1526, and believed to be the earliest extant work describing a card game, contains some particulars on primero. According to David Parlett, the game&#x27;s card-point system is found in other Italian games but nowhere else. The game is still very much played in central Europe and Spain with Italian-suited cards, under the name of &quot;goffo&quot; or &quot;bambara&quot;, remaining the major native vying game of Italy. Alessandro Striggio&#x27;s madrigal dramatizing a party of the game &quot;II gioco di primiera&quot; was published in 1569.

== Etymology ==

This old game of cards was called &#x27; in France, &#x27; in Spain, and &#x27; in Italy. All names derived from the Latin &#x27;, &#x27;first&#x27;. In English literature, besides the occasional use of the foreign names, the game is designated primero (and also prima-vista, a probable variant), with the usual corruptions in spelling of the early days.

According to Stephen Skinner, primero and prima-vista are one and the same game. As for John Minshew, primero and prima-vista (&#x27;, that is, first and first seen, because he that can show such an order of cards, wins the game), are two different games of cards.

Whichever opinion these two seventeenth-century lexicographers might have had on the origin of primero, it seems fairly plausible that the game being played in different parts of Europe had to acquire similar names as it migrated from one country to another, or from one region to the other, notably in Italy and Spain. And with the addition of new rules to the original set of rules, or even variations on the rules that the game devised, it finally reached a level of development that made them become separate games, despite their common origin. So, as the Italian writer Berni said: &quot;The game is played differently in different places.&quot;

== The gamblers ==

Daines Barrington described an Elizabethan card party painted by Federico Zuccari that originally belonged to Lord Falkland in which Lord Burleigh is represented playing at cards with three other persons, apparently of distinction, each having two rings on the same fingers of both their hands. The cards used are marked as at present, although they differ from those of modern times for being narrower and longer. Eight of the cards lie on the table with the blank side uppermost, for the cards at that time had blank backs, while four remain in each of the other players hands. A particular in this painting is that one of the players is seen showing his cards, which are: the jack (knave) of hearts, the ace, 7 and 6 of clubs. The cover of the pack lying on the table displays two lions supporting a shield, upon which is what appears to be a heraldic rose (the crest of the Tudors), and underneath, though indistinctly, the partially illegible name of a French card-maker Jehan Licl**rer. This particular shows that the cards then used were at least sometimes obtained from France. The money on the table, together with considerable heaps of gold and silver, appears to be coins of Edward VI and Queen Elizabeth I.

As the first Marquess of Exeter, Lord Burleigh, is said to have entirely devoted his time to business and study, taking no diversion but that afforded by his gardens, of which he was both fond and proud, it is to be supposed that this painting was not actually a portrait of him, though mistaken for his, as was the ownership of the old manor-house of Wimbledon. So, there seems to be little doubt here as for which game the artist meant to describe, and that the person exhibiting his cards to the spectators had won a lush, for his three clubs are the best cards for counting.

A passage in an old play by Robert Greene has been quoted by several writers as evidence that primero was a gambling game. But a person who objects to cards, might make such a remark with respect to any card game, whether a gambling game or not. Judging from the partial descriptions of the game which remain to us, it might seem that primero was played for either large or small stakes, as agreed upon. John Florio describes primero played by two persons for &quot;one shilling stake and three rest (pool).&quot; In Minsheu&#x27;s &quot;Spanish Dialogues&quot;, four play; the stake is two shillings and the rest, eight. The text is self-explanatory, explaining also the meaning of the name primero.

== Primero and the Tudor dynasty ==

Primero appears to have been one of the earliest card games played in England during the Renaissance and the Tudor dynasty, and certainly it continued to be one of the most fashionable games throughout the reigns of Henry VIII, Edward VI, Mary I of England, Elizabeth I and James I, due to the frequent mention of it by many writers of that time. Already during the reign of Henry VII, notices of money issued several times for the King&#x27;s losses at cards appear in the Remembrance&#x27;s Office, dated December the 26th, in the ninth year of his reign. There, an entry is made of one hundred shillings paid at one time to him for the purpose of playing at cards. The private expenses of Princess Mary, Henry VIII&#x27;s daughter and later Queen, also contain numerous items of money &quot;for the playe at cardes&quot;. But despite the records, it is not certain that primero found its way to England previously to the marriage of Queen Mary I with Philip II of Spain, although there is no doubt that his coming to England from the court of Charles V would have cause it to be more generally known and played. William Shakespeare also speaks of Henry VIII playing at primero with his brother-in-law Charles Brandon, 1st Duke of Suffolk, and makes Falstaff say: &quot;I never prospered since I forswore myself at primero.&quot; Additionally, the clown Lancelot in Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Merchant of Venice&quot; confides in this father that &quot;for mine own part, as I have set up my rest to run away, so I will not rest till I have sun some ground&quot; (2.2.91-92). To &quot;set up [one&#x27;s] rest&quot; alludes to a type of gamble in the Italian version of primero . Among the epigrams of John Harington we have one which describes &quot;The Story of Marcus&#x27; Life at Primero&quot;, in which many of the terms of the game are developed in detail.

== Evolution and decline ==

Judging by the pattern of succession of games during the Renaissance, many of the card games played throughout Europe, ascended in popularity to be later replaced by another type of game, again brought into England by the court gamester of that time. So that, by the last quarter of the 16th century, primero had already decreased in popularity, and was gradually replaced by the trick-taking game maw, the favorite card game of James I, and alluded by Harington as supplanting primero. According to Charles Cotton, primero, which by the time of the Restoration in 1660 had already evolved into many other variations, some of six cards, rapidly went out of fashion with the introduction of the Spanish game of Ombre.

== Rules of the game ==

The object of the game, as in poker, is to attain the highest possible hand, or at least bluff your competitors out of betting against you. There are no existing written rules for the 16th-century primero, only descriptions. However, a number of reconstructions of the game have been made, primarily on the basis of books describing playing strategy and references in period literature.

=== The play ===
Primero is played with a 40-card deck, and there are special decks made for this game. It works best with four to six players. The player who holds the &quot;prime&quot;, a sequence of the best cards and a good trump, is sure to be successful over the adversaries – hence the game&#x27;s name.



=== English version ===

Because this is a gambling game, the first step is for all players to ante into the pot. The deal is counter-clockwise, starting with the dealer. Each player receives 4 cards dealt in 2&#x27;s from a 40-card deck ranking K Q J 7 6 5 4 3 2 A. Anyone dealt a winning combination calls for an immediate showdown, and the player with the best hand wins the pot. Two cards go to each player, which is followed by the next phase of betting, and two more cards are dealt to each player. Then either eight cards are dealt face down on the table or the remaining cards are left out as a draw pile or stockpile.

In the eight-card version, eight cards are laid out on the table, and players may draw and discard from only these. When a player is satisfied with his cards, he may knock on the table, calling out: &quot;Vada&quot; (go!), which brings an immediate showdown won by the best hand. If no one bets, the stakes are carried forward to the next deal; but if one stays in, at least one other must contest the pot, this obligation ultimately falling upon the player immediately ahead of the last bettor if everyone else has folded. In a showdown, the better equal combinations are those with the highest point. Thus, a quartet of aces (4x16=64) beats a quartet of 5s (60), but it&#x27;s beaten by four 6s (72). Four kings will not beat four queens or jacks, as these hands all count 40. Such ties are broken in favor of the eldest hand competing.

Players &quot;vie&quot; or &quot;vye&quot; by stating how high a hand they claim to have, and may &quot;bluff&quot; by overstating it. What they apparently must not do is to underbid their hands; for as Cardano puts it: &quot;If anyone wins with the greatest point, he is obliged to show another card; otherwise he loses his deposit because he could have a &#x27;Flush&#x27;... Similarly, if he &#x27;vies&#x27; on the basis of point, he is obliged to show two different cards and one of a matching suit, so that no one may suspect him of having a &#x27;Flush&#x27; or &#x27;Prime&#x27;.&quot;

A player may either knock or draw in a turn, but not both. Once a player knocks, he may no longer draw. When two players have knocked, the play stops, and cards are shown. Betting starts after the two cards are dealt, and may continue after these two cards have been dealt, and then at every round, just before the dealer&#x27;s turn. The dealer always bets first. Players may match, raise, or fold any time during wagering. If all players refuse a bet, it must be withdrawn.

=== Italian version ===

In Rome, the full 52-card deck was used. In Florence, it is custom to leave out the 7s, 8s and 9s, keeping and vying only with the smaller cards; the &quot;rest&quot; (&quot;to set up a rest&quot; means &#x27;to win [something]&#x27;, and is a phrase which occurs in almost every poem in the times of James and Charles. It is taken from terms used at primero, and perhaps other games then played) is made at the second card, and when the first player say &quot;pass&quot;, every one is obliged to discard, notwithstanding any one may have an ace or a 6 in hand. In Venice, for instance, the mode of playing may be different; in Lombardy, Naples, France and Spain, so many countries, so many customs. But of all the modes, none can be superior to that of the court of Rome. There, the 7s, 8s and 9s are not withdrawn; there it is allowed to discard, but not both cards after &quot;pass&quot; is once said; nor can this be done with the two cards of the &quot;rest&quot;, as it is usual in other places. The most essential operation of this game may be its two principal hands, the &quot;flush&quot; and the &#x27;, and a third, derived from the first, which is called &#x27;; from these three are deducted all the varieties which daily occur at primero, as the greater and lesser &quot;flush&quot;, the great and little &quot;prime&quot;, and more or less points; this diversity gives rise to numerous controversies and disputable points. Another excellent hand in this game is four-of-a-kind; four court cards, four aces, etc., beat both the flush and &quot;&quot;.

=== Spanish version ===

Jacob Le Duchat, in a note on that chapter of Rabelais, in which the games Gargantua played at are enumerated, has described the mode of playing primero, and a similar account may be gathered from the &quot;Dictionary of the Spanish Academy.&quot; According to Duchat, there are two kinds of primero, the greater and the lesser; the difference between them is that the former is played with the figured cards, while at the latter the highest card is the 7, which counts for 21. Each player has four cards, which are dealt one by one. the next card in value to the 7 is the 6, which counts for 18; then the 6, which counts for 15. The ace is equivalent to 6 points, but the 2 (deuce), the 3 (trey) and the 4 count only for their respective numbers. To these cards may be added, if the players choose, the &quot;&quot;, for which the jack of hearts is most commonly chosen, and of which he may make what card and what colour he likes. After which each of the players show their four cards, and he whose cards are all of different sorts wins the prime, if they are all of one colour he wins the Flush.
Meanwhile, according to the &quot;Great Spanish Dictionary&quot;, is played by dealing four cards to each player; the value of the 7, 6 and ace, are the same; but the 2 is said to count for 12, the 3 for 13, the 4 for 14, and the 5 for 15, the figured cards are each equivalent to 10. The best hand is the flush, that is, four cards of high numbers and one of one colour; the next is the &#x27;(supremus), consisting of the &#x27;, 7, 6, and ace, which count for 55; then the , or prime, which is four cards of different suits. Should two persons have flushes, the player who counts the highest number, or the greatest flush wins, and the same regulation holds good in regard to the prime. But should there be neither flush nor prime, the one who can count the most points in one suit wins.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Barbers is one of the livery companies of the City of London, and ranks 17th in precedence.

The Fellowship of Surgeons merged with the Barbers&#x27; Company in 1540, forming the Company of Barbers and Surgeons, but after the rising professionalism of the trade broke away in 1745 to form what would become the Royal College of Surgeons.

The company no longer retains an association with the hairdressing profession, and principally acts as a charitable institution for medical and surgical causes. In modern times, between one-third and one-half of the company&#x27;s liverymen are surgeons, dentists or other medical practitioners.

== History ==
The first mention of the Barbers&#x27; Company occurs in 1308 when Richard le Barbour was elected by the Court of Aldermen to keep order amongst his fellows. Barbers originally aided monks, who were at the time the traditional practitioners of medicine and surgery, because papal decrees prohibited members of religious orders themselves from spilling blood. In addition to haircutting, hairdressing, and shaving, barbers performed surgery: neck manipulation; cleansing of ears and scalp; draining/lancing of boils, fistulae, and cysts with wicks; bloodletting and leeching; fire cupping; enemas; and the extraction of teeth.

Soon surgeons with little expertise in the haircutting and shaving arts of the barbers began to join the company, but in 1368, the surgeons were allowed to form their own, unincorporated fellowship or guild. However, the Barbers&#x27; Guild retained the power to oversee surgical practices in London. The Barbers&#x27; Guild continued this oversight after it became, by royal charter of 1462, a company.

The Fellowship of Surgeons merged with the Barbers&#x27; Company in 1540 by Act of Parliament to form the Company of Barbers and Surgeons. The Act specified that no surgeon could cut hair or shave another and that no barber could practice surgery; the only common activity was to be the extraction of teeth. The barber pole, featuring red and white spiralling stripes, indicated the two crafts (surgery in red and barbering in white). Barbers received higher pay than surgeons until surgeons were entered into British warships during naval wars.

In order to become a member of the company, apprentice training would occur for seven years within the household of an experienced barber-surgeon; apprentices would assist in surgical care and gain hands-on experience in tasks such as setting bones and suturing wounds. Once completed, the new member would demonstrate their skills and abilities to Company-appointed examiners. They would then pay a membership fee and join the ranks of the Company.
The first Master of the Company of Barbers and Surgeons was the superintendent of St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital and royal physician, Thomas Vicary. The presentation of the charter is the subject of a painting by Hans Holbein the Younger, in the collection of the Barbers&#x27; Company.
However, with the rising professionalism of surgery, in 1745 the surgeons broke away from the barbers to form the Company of Surgeons, which became the Royal College of Surgeons in 1800.

The company no longer retains an association with the hairdressing profession. It does, however, retain its links with surgery, principally acting as a charitable institution to the benefit of medical and surgical cases. In modern times, between one-third and one-half of the company&#x27;s liverymen are surgeons, dentists or other medical practitioners.

== Barber-Surgeons&#x27; Hall and arms ==

The first hall was built on Monkwell Street. The current hall is at Monkwell Square after its predecessor was completely destroyed by bombings during World War II.

After the licensing of dissection in 1540, public demonstrations took place four times a year in the Great Hall of Barber-Surgeons&#x27; Hall – with a crowd surrounding a table. Attendance was compulsory for all &#x27;free&#x27; surgeons. The dissected corpses were buried in the churchyard of St Olave&#x27;s, Silver Street. By 1568, the Court of Assistants of the Company ordered wooden raised seating to be erected in the Hall during anatomies. By the 17th century, travelers noted that the universities at Padua and Leiden possessed purpose-built anatomical theatres. Inigo Jones was commissioned to design and build one for the Surgeon-Barbers, but died (1652) before it was finished. The work was completed by John Webb in 1636.

The herb garden that surrounded the Hall was used to create medicinal samples and is considered one of the reasons that people were able to escape during the Great Fire of London in 1666, as it kept the fire away from that side of the building. However, the anatomy theatre was the only Company building to survive the Great Fire of London in 1666. 

The second hall was designed by Edward Jarman, whose plan provided a courtyard, with the main part of the Hall on its west side again using bastion 13 of the Roman wall. The buildings remained substantially the same until 1784 when the anatomy theatre was demolished to make way for housing. In 1869, economic constraint necessitated the leasing of the dining hall and kitchen areas for warehouse use, the Company retaining little more than an entrance lobby and Courtroom (which became the new dining hall) on the ground floor, and a staircase leading to a committee room and accommodation for the Beadle.

On the night of 24 August 1940 the second hall and its environs were slightly damaged by a high explosive bomb (the first to fall on London in the Second World War) but on the night of 29 December 1940 the Hall and surrounding area were almost totally destroyed by incendiary bombs which started fires that raged for three days. On 13 May 1969, the current Hall was opened by Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother.

With the merger of the Barbers&#x27; Company and Surgeons&#x27; Fellowship in 1540 to become the Company of Barbers and Surgeons, the hall was called Barber-Surgeons&#x27; Hall – a name that continues despite the fact that the company is once again the Barbers&#x27; Company since the secession of the surgeons.
Similarly, the arms of the present-day company continue to be those granted in 1569 after the merger: a quartered combination of the arms of the Barbers&#x27; Company (granted 1451, with fleams – 1st and 3rd quarters) and the badge of the Fellowship of Surgeons (1492, a crowned rose on a &#x27;spatter&#x27; (or spatula) – 2nd and 4th quarters).
*The crest is an opinicus – an English heraldic variation of griffin.
*The supporters are collared (by a crown) and chained lynxes – presumably suggesting the keenness of vision necessary for surgery.
*The motto is &quot;De Praescientia Dei&quot; (Latin for &quot;From/through the Foreknowledge of God&quot;) – possibly referring to the uncertain outcomes of the surgeon&#x27;s attention which, good or bad, were attributed to God.

<text>Primo visto, &quot;Primavista&quot;, &quot;Prima-vista&quot;, &quot;Primi-vist&quot;, &quot;Primiuiste&quot;, 
&quot;Primofistula&quot;, or even &quot;Primefisto&quot;, is a 16th-century gambling card game fashionable c. 1530–1640. Very little is known about this game, but judging by the etymology of the words used to describe the many local variants of the game, it appears to be one of Italian origin.

== Historical claims ==

Based upon references in period literature it appears to be closely related to the game of Primero, with some later authorities claiming that the two games were in fact the very same.
Opposing claims to this theory include the fact that the earliest known reference to the name Primo visto appears in Greene&#x27;s &quot;Notable Discovery of Coosnage&quot; published in 1591, more than half a century after the name Primero was in common use. John Minsheu, an English linguist and lexicographer, claims that Primero and Prima vista (hence Primo visto) were two distinct card games - &quot;That is, first and first seen, because he that can shew such an order of cardes first winnes the game&quot;, although he gives but one set of names and just one reason for their names Robert Nares in his book &quot;A Glossary&quot; states that the circumstance of the cards being counted in the same way, with the &quot;Six&quot; reckoned for eighteen and the &quot;Seven&quot; for twenty-one, seems to determine that Primo visto was the same as Primero, or even possibly a later variation of the latter. 

Slightly stronger evidence exists in the form of a list of popular board and card games and diversions of the time of the English Renaissance in John Taylor&#x27;s 1621 book &quot;Taylor&#x27;s Motto&quot;, listing both Primero and Primefisto, and the same occurs in a list of card games in Richard Brome&#x27;s &quot;The New Academy&quot;.

A brief poem by the French Humanist Mellin de Saint-Gelais written in 1525 describes Francis I of France, Pope Clement VII and Emperor Charles V (the combatants in the Italian War of 1521–1526, a struggle for the possession of Italy) playing a hand of &quot;Prime&quot; (a game similar to Primero and to the &quot;Flux&quot;). That seems to indicate that the game of Primo visto, and consequently Primero, is probably older than many historians have been able to determine and may date to the beginning of the 16th century or even further back in time.

A comparison with the terms used in the game of Primero, the mode of playing and the outcome, indicates that Primo visto was played according to the rules of Primero. It is possible, however, that it was played with only three cards dealt to each player instead of four, followed by a few rounds of bettings. Another possible difference may lie in the amount staked to the pool. The main part of the game was one of bluff and vies among the players, which also suggests that Primo visto was a simple variant, like the French game of &quot;Prime&quot;.

<doc id="370807" wikidata="Q25729" url="?curid=370807" title="The Persistence of Memory">
<text>The Persistence of Memory (, ) is a 1931 painting by artist Salvador Dalí and one of the most recognizable works of Surrealism. First shown at the Julien Levy Gallery in 1932, since 1934 the painting has been in the collection of the Museum of Modern Art (MoMA) in New York City, which received it from an anonymous donor. It is widely recognized and frequently referred to in popular culture, and sometimes referred to by more descriptive titles, such as &quot;The Melting Clocks&quot;, &quot;The Soft Watches&quot; or &quot;The Melting Watches&quot;.

==Analysis==
The well-known surrealist piece introduced the image of the soft melting pocket watch. It epitomizes Dalí&#x27;s theory of &quot;softness&quot; and &quot;hardness&quot;, which was central to his thinking at the time. As Dawn Adès wrote, &quot;The soft watches are an unconscious symbol of the relativity of space and time, a Surrealist meditation on the collapse of our notions of a fixed cosmic order&quot;. This interpretation suggests that Dalí was incorporating an understanding of the world introduced by Albert Einstein&#x27;s theory of special relativity. Asked by Ilya Prigogine whether this was the case, Dalí replied that the soft watches were not inspired by the theory of relativity, but by the surrealist perception of a Camembert melting in the sun.

The year prior to painting the &quot;Persistence of Memory,&quot; Dali developed his &quot;paranoiac-critical method,&quot; deliberately inducing psychotic hallucinations to inspire his art. He remarked, &quot;The difference between a madman and me is that I am not mad.&quot; This quote highlights Dali&#x27;s awareness of his mental state. Despite his engagement in activities that could be seen as insane, Dali maintained that he was not actually mad.
It is possible to recognize a human figure in the middle of the composition, in the strange &quot;monster&quot; (with much texture near its face, and much contrast and tone in the picture) that Dalí used in several contemporary pieces to represent himself – the abstract form becoming something of a self-portrait, reappearing frequently in his work. The creature seems to be based on a figure from the &quot;Paradise&quot; section of Hieronymus Bosch&#x27;s &quot;The Garden of Earthly Delights&quot;, which Dalí had studied. It can be read as a &quot;fading&quot; creature, one that often appears in dreams where the dreamer cannot pinpoint the creature&#x27;s exact form and composition. The creature has one closed eye with several eyelashes, suggesting that it is also in a dream state. The iconography may refer to a dream that Dalí himself had experienced, and the clocks may symbolize the passing of time as one experiences it in sleep or the persistence of time in the eyes of the dreamer.

The orange watch at the bottom left of the painting is covered in ants; Dalí often used ants in his paintings as a symbol of decay. A fly sits on the watch next to the orange watch. The fly appears to be casting a human shadow as the sun hits it. &quot;The Persistence of Memory&quot; employs &quot;the exactitude of realist painting techniques&quot; to depict imagery more likely to be found in dreams than in waking consciousness.

The craggy rocks to the right represent the tip of Cap de Creus peninsula in north-eastern Catalonia. Many of Dalí&#x27;s paintings were inspired by the landscapes of his life in Catalonia. The strange and foreboding shadow in the foreground of this painting is a reference to , a mountain in the northeast corner of Catalonia.

==Versions==

Dalí returned to the theme of this painting with the variation &quot;The Disintegration of the Persistence of Memory&quot; (1954), showing his earlier famous work systematically fragmenting into smaller component elements, and a series of rectangular blocks which reveal further imagery through the gaps between them, implying something beneath the surface of the original work; this work is now in the Salvador Dalí Museum in St. Petersburg, Florida, while the original &quot;Persistence of Memory&quot; remains at the Museum of Modern Art in New York City. Dalí also produced various lithographs and sculptures on the theme of soft watches late in his career. Some of these sculptures are &quot;Persistence of Memory&quot;, &quot;Nobility of Time&quot;, &quot;Profile of Time&quot;, and &quot;Three Dancing Watches&quot;.

<text>A coffeehouse, coffee shop, or café (), is an establishment that serves various types of coffee, espresso, latte, americano and cappuccino, among other hot beverages. Some coffeehouses may serve iced coffee among other cold beverages, such as iced tea, as well as other non-caffeinated beverages. A coffeehouse may also serve food, such as light snacks, sandwiches, muffins, cakes, breads, donuts or pastries. In continental Europe, some cafés even serve alcoholic beverages. Coffeehouses range from owner-operated small businesses to large multinational corporations. Some coffeehouse chains operate on a franchise business model, with numerous branches across various countries around the world.

While &quot;café&quot; may refer to a coffeehouse, the term &quot;café&quot; can also refer to a diner, British café (also colloquially called a &quot;caff&quot;), &quot;greasy spoon&quot; (a small and inexpensive restaurant), transport café, teahouse or tea room, or other casual eating and drinking place. A coffeehouse may share some of the same characteristics of a bar or restaurant, but it is different from a cafeteria. Many coffeehouses in West Asia offer &quot;shisha&quot; (actually called &quot;nargile&quot; in Levantine Arabic, Greek, and Turkish), flavored tobacco smoked through a hookah. An espresso bar is a type of coffeehouse that specializes in serving espresso and espresso-based drinks.

From a cultural standpoint coffeehouses largely serve as centers of social interaction: a coffeehouse provides patrons with a place to congregate, talk, read, write, entertain one another, or pass the time, whether individually or in small groups. A coffeehouse can serve as an informal social club for its regular members. As early as the 1950s Beatnik era and the 1960s folk music scene, coffeehouses have hosted singer-songwriter performances, typically in the evening. The digital age saw the rise of the Internet café along similar principles.

==Etymology==
The most common English spelling of &quot;café&quot; is the French word for both &quot;coffee&quot; and &quot;coffeehouse;&quot; it was adopted by English-speaking countries in the late 19th century. The Italian spelling, &quot;caffè&quot;, is also sometimes used in English. In Southern England, especially around London in the 1950s, the French pronunciation was often facetiously altered to and spelt &quot;caff&quot;.

The English word &quot;coffee&quot; and French word &quot;café&quot; (coffeehouse) both derive from the Italian &quot;caffè&quot;—first attested as &quot;caveé&quot; in Venice in 1570—and in turn derived from Arabic &quot;qahwa&quot; (). The Arabic term &quot;qahwa&quot; originally referred to a type of wine, but after the wine ban by Islam, the name was transferred to coffee because of the similar rousing effect it induced. European knowledge of coffee (the plant, its seeds, and the drink made from the seeds) came through European contact with Turkey, likely via Venetian-Ottoman trade relations.

The English word &quot;café&quot; to describe a restaurant that usually serves coffee and snacks rather than the word coffee that describes the drink, is derived from the French &quot;café.&quot; The first café in France is believed to have opened in 1660. The first café in Europe is believed to have been opened in Belgrade, Ottoman Serbia in 1522 as a Kafana (Serbian coffee house).

The translingual word root /kafe/ appears in many European languages with various naturalized spellings, including Portuguese, Spanish, and French (&quot;café&quot;); German (&quot;Kaffee&quot;); Polish (&quot;kawa&quot;); Serbian (&quot;кафа / kafa&quot;); Ukrainian (&quot;кава&quot;, &#x27;kava&#x27;); and others.

==History==
===Ottoman Empire===

The first coffeehouses appeared in Damascus. These Ottoman coffeehouses also appeared in Mecca, in the Arabian Peninsula in the 15th century, then spread to the Ottoman Empire&#x27;s capital of Istanbul in the 16th century and in Baghdad. Coffeehouses became popular meeting places where people gathered to drink coffee, have conversations, play board games such as chess and backgammon, listen to stories and music, and discuss news and politics. They became known as &quot;schools of wisdom&quot; for the type of clientele they attracted, and their free and frank discourse.

Coffeehouses in Mecca became a concern of imams who viewed them as places for political gatherings and drinking, leading to bans between 1512 and 1524. However, these bans could not be maintained, due to coffee becoming ingrained in daily ritual and culture among Arabs and neighboring peoples. The Ottoman chronicler İbrahim Peçevi reports in his writings (1642–49) about the opening of the first coffeehouse (&quot;kiva han&quot;) in Istanbul:


===Persia===
The 17th-century French traveler and writer Jean Chardin gave a lively description of the Persian coffeehouse (&quot;qahveh khaneh&quot; in Persian) scene:
===Europe===

In the 17th century, coffee appeared for the first time in Europe outside the Ottoman Empire, and coffeehouses were established, soon becoming increasingly popular. The first coffeehouse is said to have appeared in 1632 in Livorno, founded by a Jewish merchant, or later in 1640, in Venice. In the 19th and 20th centuries in Europe, coffeehouses were very often meeting points for writers and artists.

==== Austria ====
The traditional tale of the origins of the Viennese café begins with the mysterious sacks of green beans left behind when the Turks were defeated in the Battle of Vienna in 1683. All the sacks of coffee were granted to the victorious Polish king Jan III Sobieski, who in turn gave them to one of his officers, Jerzy Franciszek Kulczycki, a Ukrainian cossack and Polish diplomat of Ruthenian descent. Kulczycki, according to the tale, then began the first coffeehouse in Vienna with the hoard, also being the first to serve coffee with milk. There is a statue of Kulczycki on a street also named after him.

However, it is now widely accepted that the first Viennese coffeehouse was actually opened by an Armenian merchant named Johannes Diodato (also known as Johannes Theodat). He opened a registered coffeehouse in Vienna in 1685. Fifteen years later, four other Armenians owned coffeehouses. The culture of drinking coffee was itself widespread in the country in the second half of the 18th century.

Over time, a special coffee house culture developed in Habsburg Vienna. On the one hand, writers, artists, musicians, intellectuals, bon vivants and their financiers met in the coffee house, and on the other hand, new coffee varieties were always served. In the coffee house, people played cards or chess, worked, read, thought, composed, discussed, argued, observed and just chatted. A lot of information was also obtained in the coffee house, because local and foreign newspapers were freely available to all guests. This form of coffee house culture spread throughout the Habsburg Empire in the 19th century.
Scientific theories, political plans but also artistic projects were worked out and discussed in Viennese coffee houses all over Central Europe. James Joyce even enjoyed his coffee in a Viennese coffee house on the Adriatic in Trieste, then and now the main port for coffee and coffee processing in Italy and Central Europe. From there, the Viennese Kapuziner coffee developed into today&#x27;s world-famous cappuccino. This special multicultural atmosphere of the Habsburg coffee houses was largely destroyed by the later National Socialism and Communism and can only be found today in a few places that have long been in the slipstream of history, such as Vienna or Trieste.

==== England ====

The first coffeehouse in England was set up on the High Street in Oxford in 1650–1651 by &quot;Jacob the Jew&quot;. A second competing coffee house was opened across the street in 1654, by &quot;Cirques Jobson, the Jew&quot; (Queen&#x27;s Lane Coffee House).
In London, the earliest coffeehouse was established by Pasqua Rosée in 1652. Anthony Wood observed of the coffee houses of Oxford in his &quot;Life and Times&quot; (1674) &quot;The decay of study, and consequently of learning, are coffee houses, to which most scholars retire and spend much of the day in hearing and speaking of news&quot;. The proprietor was Pasqua Rosée, the servant of a trader in goods from the Ottoman Empire named Daniel Edwards, who imported the coffee and assisted Rosée in setting up the establishment there.

From 1670 to 1685, the number of London coffeehouses began to increase, and they also began to gain political importance due to their popularity as places of debate. English coffeehouses were significant meeting places, particularly in London. By 1675, there were more than 3,000 coffeehouses in England. The coffeehouses were great social levelers, open to all men and indifferent to social status, and as a result associated with equality and republicanism. Entry gave access to books or print news. Coffeehouses boosted the popularity of print news culture and helped the growth of various financial markets including insurance, stocks, and auctions. Lloyd&#x27;s of London had its origins in a coffeehouse run by Edward Lloyd, where underwriters of ship insurance met to do business. The rich intellectual atmosphere of early London coffeehouses was available to anyone who could pay the sometimes one penny entry fee, giving them the name of &#x27;Penny Universities&#x27;.

Though Charles II later tried to suppress London coffeehouses as &quot;places where the disaffected met, and spread scandalous reports concerning the conduct of His Majesty and his Ministers&quot;, the public still flocked to them. For several decades following the Restoration, the wits gathered around John Dryden at Will&#x27;s Coffee House, in Russell Street, Covent Garden. As coffeehouses were believed to be areas where anti-government gossip could easily spread, Queen Mary and the London City magistrates tried to prosecute people who frequented coffeehouses as they were liable to &quot;spread false and seditious reports&quot;. William III&#x27;s privy council also suppressed Jacobite sympathizers in the 1680s and 1690s in coffeehouses as these were the places that they believed harbored plotters against the regimes.

By 1739, there were 551 coffeehouses in London; each attracted a particular clientele divided by occupation or attitude, such as Tories and Whigs, wits and stockjobbers, merchants and lawyers, booksellers and authors, men of fashion or the &quot;cits&quot; of the old city center. According to one French visitor, Antoine François Prévost, coffeehouses, &quot;where you have the right to read all the papers for and against the government&quot;, were the &quot;seats of English liberty&quot;.

Jonathan&#x27;s Coffee House in 1698 saw the listing of stock and commodity prices that evolved into the London Stock Exchange. Lloyd&#x27;s Coffee House provided the venue for merchants and shippers to discuss insurance deals, leading to the establishment of Lloyd&#x27;s of London insurance market, the Lloyd&#x27;s Register classification society, and other related businesses. Auctions in salesrooms attached to coffeehouses provided the start for the great auction houses of Sotheby&#x27;s and Christie&#x27;s.

In Victorian England, the temperance movement set up coffeehouses (also known as coffee taverns) for the working classes, as a place of relaxation free of alcohol, an alternative to the public house.

==== Romania ====
In 1667, Kara Hamie, a former Ottoman Janissary from Constantinople, opened the first coffee shop in Bucharest (then the capital of the Principality of Wallachia), in the center of the city, where today sits the main building of the National Bank of Romania.

==== France ====
Pasqua Rosée, an Armenian by the name Harutiun Vartian, also established the first coffeehouse in Paris in 1672 and held a citywide coffee monopoly until Procopio Cutò, his apprentice, opened the Café Procope in 1686. This coffeehouse still exists today and was a popular meeting place of the French Enlightenment; Voltaire, Rousseau, and Denis Diderot frequented it, and it is arguably the birthplace of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;, the first modern encyclopedia.

==== Hungary ====
The first known cafes in Pest date back to 1714 when a house intended to serve as a Cafe (Balázs Kávéfőző) was purchased. Minutes of the Pest City Council from 1729 mention complaints by the Balázs café and Franz Reschfellner Cafe against the Italian-originated café of Francesco Bellieno for selling underpriced coffee.

==== Italy ====

During the 18th century, the oldest extant coffeehouses in Italy were established: Caffè Florian in Venice, Antico Caffè Greco in Rome, Caffè Pedrocchi in Padua, Caffè dell&#x27;Ussero in Pisa and Caffè Fiorio in Turin.

==== Ireland ====
In the 18th century, Dublin coffeehouses functioned as early reading centers and the emergence of circulation and subscription libraries that provided greater access to printed material for the public. The interconnectivity of the coffeehouse and virtually every aspect of the print trade were evidenced by the incorporation of printing, publishing, selling, and viewing of newspapers, pamphlets and books on the premises, most notably in the case of Dick&#x27;s Coffee House, owned by Richard Pue; thus contributing to a culture of reading and increased literacy. These coffeehouses were a social magnet where different strata of society came together to discuss topics covered by the newspapers and pamphlets. Most coffeehouses of the 18th century would eventually be equipped with their own printing presses or incorporate a book shop.

Today, the term &quot;café&quot; is used for most coffeehouses – this can be spelled both with and without an acute accent, but is always pronounced as two syllables. The name café has also come to be used for a type of diners that offers cooked meals (again, without alcoholic beverages) which can be standalone or operating within shopping centres or department stores. In Irish usage, the presence or absence of the acute accent does not signify the type of establishment (coffeehouse versus diner), and is purely a decision by the owner: for instance, the two largest diner-style café chains in Ireland in the 1990s were named &quot;Kylemore Cafe&quot; and &quot;Bewley&#x27;s Café&quot; – i.e., one written without, and one with, the acute accent.

==== Portugal ====

The history of coffee in Portugal is usually told to have begun during the reign of king John V, when Portuguese agent Francisco de Melo Palheta supposedly managed to steal coffee beans from the Dutch East India Company and introduce it to Brazil. From Brazil, coffee was taken to Cape Verde and São Tomé and Príncipe, which were also Portuguese colonies at the time. Despite this story, coffee already existed in Angola, having been introduced by Portuguese missionaries. During the 18th century, the first public &quot;cafés&quot; appeared, inspired by French gatherings from the 17th century, becoming spaces for cultural and artistic entertainment.

Several cafes emerged in Lisbon such as: &quot;Martinho da Arcada&quot; (being the oldest café still functioning, having opened in 1782), &quot;Café Tavares&quot;, &quot;Botequim Parras,&quot; among others&quot;.&quot; Of these several became famous for harbouring poets and artists, such as Manuel du Bocage with his visits to &quot;Café Nicola,&quot; which opened in 1796 by the Italian Nicola Breteiro; and Fernando Pessoa with his visits to &quot;A Brasileira&quot;, which opened in 1905 by Adriano Teles. The most famous of these coffee houses was the &quot;Café Marrare&quot;, opened by the napolitan Antonio Marrare, in 1820, frequently visited by Júlio Castilho, Raimundo de Bulhão Pato, Almeida Garrett, Alexandre Herculano and other members of the Portuguese government and the intelligentsia. It began its own saying: «&quot;Lisboa era Chiado, o Chiado era o Marrare e o Marrare ditava a lei&quot;» (English: &quot;Lisbon was the Chiado, the Chiado was the Marrare and the Marrare dictated the law&quot;).

Other coffee houses soon opened across the country, such as &quot;Café Vianna,&quot; opened in Braga, in 1858, by Manoel José da Costa Vianna, which was also visited by important Portuguese writers such as Camilo Castelo Branco and Eça de Queirós. During the 1930&#x27;s, a surge in coffee houses happened in Porto with the opening of several that still exist, such as &quot;Café Guarany&quot;, opened in 1933, and &quot;A Regaleira&quot;, opened in 1934.

==== Switzerland ====
In 1761 the Turm Kaffee, a shop for exported goods, was opened in St. Gallen.

==== Finland ====

Finland&#x27;s first coffee house, Kaffehus, was founded in Turku in 1778. The oldest still-in-use coffee house in Helsinki called Café Ekberg was founded 1852.

==== Gender ====
The exclusion of women from coffeehouses as guests was not universal, but does appear to have been common in Europe. In Germany, women frequented them, but in England and France they were banned. Émilie du Châtelet purportedly cross-dressed to gain entrance to a coffeehouse in Paris.

In a well-known engraving of a Parisian café c. 1700, the gentlemen hang their hats on pegs and sit at long communal tables strewn with papers and writing implements. Coffee pots are ranged at an open fire, with a hanging cauldron of boiling water. The only woman present presides, separated in a canopied booth, from which she serves coffee in tall cups.

Aside from the discussion around women as guests of the coffeehouses, it is noted that women did work as waitresses at coffeehouses and also managed coffeehouses as proprietors. Well known women in the coffeehouse business were Moll King (coffee house proprietor) in England, and Maja-Lisa Borgman in Sweden.

==== Contemporary ====
In most European countries, such as Spain, Austria, Denmark, Germany, Norway, Sweden, Portugal, and others, the term &quot;café&quot; means a restaurant primarily serving coffee, as well as pastries such as cakes, tarts, pies, or buns. Many cafés also serve light meals such as sandwiches. European cafés often have tables on the pavement (sidewalk) as well as indoors. Some cafés also serve alcoholic drinks (e.g., wine), particularly in Southern Europe. In the Netherlands and Belgium, a &quot;café&quot; is the equivalent of a bar, and also sells alcoholic drinks. In the Netherlands a &quot;koffiehuis&quot; serves coffee, while a coffee shop (using the English term) sells &quot;soft&quot; drugs (cannabis and hashish) and is generally not allowed to sell alcoholic drinks. In France, most cafés serve as lunch restaurants in the day, and bars in the evening. They generally do not have pastries except in the mornings, when a croissant or pain au chocolat can be purchased with breakfast coffee. In Italy, cafés are similar to those found in France and known as &quot;bar&quot;. They typically serve a variety of espresso coffee, cakes and alcoholic drinks. Bars in city centers usually have different prices for consumption at the bar and consumption at a table.

=== Americas ===

==== Argentina ====

Coffeehouses are part of the culture of Buenos Aires and the customs of its inhabitants. They are traditional meeting places for &#x27;porteños&#x27; and have inspired innumerable artistic creations. Some notable coffeehouses include Confitería del Molino, Café Tortoni, El Gato Negro, Café La Biela.

====United States====
The first coffeehouse in America opened in Boston, in 1676. However, Americans did not start choosing coffee over tea until the Boston Tea Party and the Revolutionary War. After the Revolutionary War, Americans momentarily went back to drinking tea until after the War of 1812 when they began importing high-quality coffee from Latin America and expensive inferior-quality tea from American shippers instead of Great Britain. Whether they were drinking coffee or tea, coffeehouses served a similar purpose to that which they did in Great Britain, as places where business was done. In the 1780s, Merchant&#x27;s Coffee House located on Wall Street in New York City was home to the organization of the Bank of New York and the New York Chamber of Commerce.

Coffeehouses in the United States arose from the espresso- and pastry-centered Italian coffeehouses of the Italian American immigrant communities in the major U.S. cities, notably New York City&#x27;s Little Italy and Greenwich Village, Boston&#x27;s North End, and San Francisco&#x27;s North Beach. From the late 1950s onward, coffeehouses also served as a venue for entertainment, most commonly folk performers during the American folk music revival. Both Greenwich Village and North Beach became major haunts of the Beats, who were highly identified with these coffeehouses. As the youth culture of the 1960s evolved, non-Italians consciously copied these coffeehouses. The political nature of much of 1960s folk music made the music a natural tie-in with coffeehouses with their association with political action. A number of well-known performers like Joan Baez and Bob Dylan began their careers performing in coffeehouses. Blues singer Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins bemoaned his woman&#x27;s inattentiveness to her domestic situation due to her overindulgence in coffeehouse socializing in his 1969 song &quot;Coffeehouse Blues&quot;.

In 1966, Alfred Peet began applying the dark roast style to high quality beans and opened up a small shop in Berkeley, California to educate customers on the virtues of good coffee. Starting in 1967 with the opening of the historic Last Exit on Brooklyn coffeehouse, Seattle became known for its thriving countercultural coffeehouse scene; the Starbucks chain later standardized and mainstreamed this espresso bar model.

From the 1960s through the mid-1980s, churches and individuals in the United States used the coffeehouse concept for outreach. They were often storefronts and had names like &quot;The Lost Coin&quot; (Greenwich Village), &quot;The Gathering Place&quot; (Riverside, CA), &quot;Catacomb Chapel&quot; (New York City), and &quot;Jesus For You&quot; (Buffalo, NY). Christian music (often guitar-based) was performed, coffee and food was provided, and Bible studies were convened as people of varying backgrounds gathered in a casual setting that was purposefully different from traditional churches. An out-of-print book, published by the ministry of David Wilkerson, titled, &quot;A Coffeehouse Manual&quot;, served as a guide for Christian coffeehouses, including a list of name suggestions for coffeehouses.

In 2002, Brownstones Coffee of Amityville, New York opened its first location as a breakfast-oriented coffeehouse well before that business model became popular. The trend later caught on through coffeehouses such as Starbucks, which seemed to be on every street corner in several major American cities including Los Angeles and Seattle.

==Format==

Cafés may have an outdoor section (terrace, pavement or sidewalk café) with seats, tables and parasols. This is especially the case with European cafés. Cafés offer a more open public space compared to many of the traditional pubs they have replaced, which were more male dominated with a focus on drinking alcohol.

One of the original uses of the café, as a place for information exchange and communication, was reintroduced in the 1990s with the Internet café or Hotspot. The spread of modern-style cafés to urban and rural areas went hand-in-hand with the rising use of mobile computers. Computers and Internet access in a contemporary-styled venue help to create a youthful, modern place, compared to the traditional pubs or old-fashioned diners that they replaced.

===Asia===
Coffeehouses in Egypt are colloquially called &quot;″ahwah&quot; , which is the dialectal pronunciation of &quot;qahwah&quot; (literally &quot;coffee&quot;) (). Also commonly served in &quot;″ahwah&quot; are tea (&quot;shāy&quot;) and herbal teas, especially the highly popular hibiscus blend (Egyptian Arabic: &quot;karkadeh&quot; or &quot;ennab&quot;). The first &quot;″ahwah&quot; opened around the 1850s and were originally patronized mostly by older people, with youths frequenting but not always ordering. There were associated by the 1920s with clubs (Cairo), &quot;bursa&quot; (Alexandria) and &quot;gharza&quot; (rural inns). In the early 20th century, some of them became crucial venues for political and social debates.

In India, coffee culture has expanded in the past twenty years. Chains like Indian Coffee House, Café Coffee Day, Barista Lavazza have become very popular. Cafes are considered good venues to conduct office meetings and for friends to meet.

In China, an abundance of recently started domestic coffeehouse chains may be seen accommodating business people for conspicuous consumption, with coffee prices sometimes even higher than in the West.

In Malaysia and Singapore, traditional breakfast and coffee shops are called &quot;kopi tiam&quot;. The word is a portmanteau of the Malay word for coffee (as borrowed and altered from English) and the Hokkien dialect word for shop (; POJ: tiàm). Menus typically feature simple offerings: a variety of foods based on egg, toast, and coconut jam, plus coffee, tea, and Milo, a malted chocolate drink that is extremely popular in Southeast Asia and Australasia, particularly Singapore and Malaysia.

In Indonesia, traditional coffee houses are called &quot;kedai kopi&quot;, &quot;rumah kopi&quot;, or &quot;warung kopi&quot; which is often abbreviated as &quot;warkop&quot;. Kopi tubruk is a common drink in small &quot;warkop&quot;. As a coffee drink companion, traditional kue is also served in the coffee house. The first coffee house in Indonesia was founded in 1878 in Jakarta which named &quot;Warung Tinggi Tek Sun Ho&quot;.

In the Philippines, coffee shop chains like Starbucks have become the prevalent hangouts for upper- and middle-class professionals in such districts as the Makati CBD. However, carinderias (small eateries) continue to serve coffee alongside breakfast and snack dishes. Events called &quot;Kapihan&quot; (fora) are often held inside bakeshops or restaurants that also serve coffee for breakfast or merienda. There are also a number of establishments often referred to as &quot;cafés&quot; that serve not just coffee and pastries, but full meals, often international cuisine highly altered to Filipino tastes.
In Thailand, the term &quot;café&quot; is not only a coffeehouse in the international definition, as in other countries, but in the past was considered a night restaurant that serves alcoholic drinks during a comedy show on stage. The era in which this type of business flourished was the 1990s, before the 1997 financial crisis.

The first real coffeehouse in Thailand opened in 1917 at the Si Kak Phraya Si in the area of Rattanakosin Island, by Madam Cole, an American woman who living in Thailand at that time, Later, Chao Phraya Ram Rakop (เจ้าพระยารามราฆพ), Thai aristocrat, opened a coffeehouse named &quot;Café de Norasingha&quot; (คาเฟ่นรสิงห์) located at Sanam Suea Pa (สนามเสือป่า), the ground next to the Royal Plaza. At present, Café de Norasingha has been renovated and moved to within Phayathai Palace. In the southern region, a traditional coffeehouse or &quot;kopi tiam&quot; is popular with locals, like many countries in the Malay Peninsula.

===Australia===

In the 19th century, coffee houses such as the Collingwood Coffee Palace or the Federal Coffee Palace in the centre of Melbourne were established and were part of the temperance movement to reduce the consumption of alcohol in society.

In modern Australia, coffee shops are ubiquitously known as &quot;cafés&quot;. Since the post-World War II influx of Italian and Greek immigrants introduced the first espresso coffee machines to Australia in the 1950s, there was initially a slow rise in café culture, particularly in Melbourne, until a boom in locally owned cafés Australia-wide began in the 1990s. Alongside the rise in the number of cafés there has been a rise in demand for locally (or on-site) roasted specialty coffee, particularly in Sydney and Melbourne. A local favourite is the &quot;flat white&quot; which remains a popular coffee drink.

===Africa===
In Cairo, the capital of Egypt, most cafés have shisha (waterpipe). Most Egyptians indulge in the habit of smoking shisha while hanging out at the café, watching a match, studying, or even sometimes finishing some work. In Addis Ababa, the capital of Ethiopia, independent coffeehouses that struggled prior to 1991 have become popular with young professionals who do not have time for traditional coffee roasting at home. One establishment that has become well-known is the Tomoca coffee shop, which opened in 1953.

===Europe===
====United Kingdom====
The patrons of the first coffeehouse in England, The Angel, which opened in Oxford in 1650, and the mass of London coffee houses that flourished over the next three centuries, were far removed from those of modern Britain. Haunts for teenagers in particular, Italian-run espresso bars and their formica-topped tables were a feature of 1950s Soho that provided a backdrop as well as a title for Cliff Richard&#x27;s 1960 film &quot;Expresso Bongo&quot;. The first was The Moka in Frith Street, opened by Gina Lollobrigida in 1953. With their &quot;exotic Gaggia coffee machine[s]... Coke, Pepsi, weak frothy coffee and... Suncrush orange fountain[s]&quot; they spread to other urban centers during the 1960s, providing cheap, warm places for young people to congregate and an ambience far removed from the global coffee bar standard that would be established in the final decades of the century by chains such as Starbucks and Pret a Manger.

===Espresso bar===
The espresso bar is a type of coffeehouse that specializes in coffee drinks made from espresso. Originating in Italy, the espresso bar has spread throughout the world in various forms. Prime examples that are internationally known are Starbucks Coffee, based in Seattle, U.S., and Costa Coffee, based in Dunstable, U.K. (the first and second largest coffeehouse chains respectively), although the espresso bar exists in some form throughout much of the world.

The espresso bar is typically centered around a long counter with a high-yield espresso machine (usually bean to cup machines, automatic or semiautomatic pump-type machine, although occasionally a manually operated lever-and-piston system) and a display case containing pastries and occasionally savory items such as sandwiches. In the traditional Italian bar, customers either order at the bar and consume their drinks standing or, if they wish to sit down and be served, are usually charged a higher price. In some bars there is an additional charge for drinks served at an outside table. In other countries, especially the United States, seating areas for customers to relax and work are provided free of charge. Some espresso bars also sell coffee paraphernalia, candy, and even music. North American espresso bars were also at the forefront of widespread adoption of public WiFi access points to provide Internet services to people doing work on laptop computers on the premises.

The offerings at the typical espresso bar are generally quite Italianate in inspiration; biscotti, cannoli and pizzelle are a common traditional accompaniment to a caffe latte or cappuccino. Some upscale espresso bars even offer alcoholic drinks such as grappa and sambuca. Nevertheless, typical pastries are not always strictly Italianate and common additions include scones, muffins, croissants, and even doughnuts. There is usually a large selection of teas as well, and the North American espresso bar culture is responsible for the popularization of the Indian spiced tea drink masala chai. Iced drinks are also popular in some countries, including both iced tea and iced coffee as well as blended drinks such as Starbucks&#x27; Frappucino.

A worker in an espresso bar is referred to as a barista. The barista is a skilled position that requires familiarity with the drinks being made (often very elaborate, especially in North American-style espresso bars), a reasonable facility with some equipment as well as the usual customer service skills.

<text>Edward Otho Cresap Ord (October 18, 1818 – July 22, 1883), frequently referred to as E. O. C. Ord, was an American engineer and United States Army officer who saw action in the Seminole War, the Indian Wars, and the American Civil War. He commanded an army during the final days of the Civil War, and was instrumental in forcing the surrender of Confederate General Robert E. Lee. He also designed Fort Sam Houston. He died in Havana, Cuba of yellow fever.

==Early life and career==
Ord was born in Cumberland, Maryland, the son of James and Rebecca Ord. Family tradition made James Ord the illegitimate son of George IV of the United Kingdom and Maria Fitzherbert but, instead, he may have been the son of Ralph Ord, who was baptised at Wapping, Middlesex, in 1757, the son of John Ord, a factor (agent) from Berwick-upon-Tweed. Historian James Munson has concluded that Mrs Fitzherbert had no child by the Prince of Wales, although other historians disagree. For example, Saul David concludes that it is generally accepted that the Prince of Wales and Mrs Fitzherbert had at least one child and that James Ord would be the most likely candidate. Edward Ord was considered a mathematical genius and was appointed to the United States Military Academy by President Andrew Jackson. His roommate at West Point was future general William Tecumseh Sherman. He graduated in 1839 and was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Artillery. He fought in the Second Seminole War in Florida and was promoted to first lieutenant.
In January 1847, Ord sailed on the USS &quot;Lexington&quot; around Cape Horn with Henry Halleck and William Tecumseh Sherman. He arrived in Monterey, California, the capital of that newly acquired territory, and assumed command of Battery F, 3rd U.S. Artillery, with orders to complete Fort Mervine, which was renamed Fort Halleck. Its construction was superintended by Lieutenant Ord and his second in command, Lieutenant Sherman. On February 17, 1865, the fort was renamed Ord Barracks. In 1904, it was renamed to honor the original Presidio of Monterey.
Ord was in California when the gold rush began, with its resultant skyrocketing prices. Since their military salaries no longer covered living expenses, Ord&#x27;s commander suggested that the younger officers take on other jobs to supplement their income. In the fall of 1848, Ord and Sherman, in the employ of John Augustus Sutter, Jr., assisted Captain William H. Warner of the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers in the survey of Sacramento, California, helping to produce the map that established the future capital city&#x27;s extensive downtown street grid. Ord also produced a map of the Gold and Quicksilver district of California dated July 25, 1848.

Later, Los Angeles officials needed to have a survey of the public lands in order to sell them, and Ord was hired as the surveyor. He chose William Rich Hutton as his assistant, and together the two mapped Los Angeles in July and August 1849. Thanks to the efforts of these two men, historians have a fairly good view of what the Pueblo de Los Angeles looked like in the middle of the 19th century. Lieutenant Ord surveyed the pueblo and his assistant Hutton sketched many scenes of the pueblo and drew the first map from Ord&#x27;s survey. The Los Angeles City Archives has the original map produced by Hutton from Ord&#x27;s survey. Ord was paid $3000 for his work on this survey. La Reina De Los Angeles, published in 1929, states that Ord was offered 160 acres of public land and 10 building sites all in the present downtown business district but accepted the $3000 instead.

Ord was promoted to captain in 1850 while serving in the Pacific Northwest. The War Department transferred him in December 1852 to the U.S. Coast Survey, which sent him to California to work on the geodetic survey of Southern California&#x27;s coast and Channel Islands (California). Ord&#x27;s efforts improved navigation safety as the gold rush increased both ship traffic and accidents. While assigned to Coast Survey duty, Ord divided his time between San Francisco and Los Angeles and continued to hire on as a land surveyor. In the latter role, he completed a 1854-55 survey near San Pedro that would subdivide the future town of Wilmington from the Dóminguez family&#x27;s Rancho San Pedro. The same work claimed navigable waters of the adjacent estuary as federal public domain. Both results would become a foundation for development of the Port of Los Angeles in the early twentieth century. Ord transferred back to the Army in 1855. He then served in the Pacific Northwest, in campaigns against Native Americans, at Benicia Barracks, and Fort Monroe, Virginia before returning to California. 

In 1859, while attending artillery school at Fort Monroe, Ord was summoned by Secretary of War John B. Floyd to quell John Brown&#x27;s raid on the Harpers Ferry Federal arsenal. However, Col. Robert E. Lee reached Harpers Ferry first, and Colonel Lee telegraphed to Captain Ord that the situation was under control and Ord and his men would not be needed at Harpers Ferry. However, Ord&#x27;s unit later arrived to keep order ahead of Brown&#x27;s execution. Ord penned a letter to his wife on December 2, 1859, from the arsenal, describing the day and a hilltop climb with Colonel Lee. 

Ord married Mary Mercer Thompson on October 14, 1854, and they eventually had thirteen children. One of their notable children was Jules Garesche Ord, who was killed in action after reaching the top of San Juan Hill in Cuba. He was the officer who started and led the charge that Teddy Roosevelt followed. Another was Edward Otho Cresap Ord, II, who was also a United States Army Major who served with the 22nd Infantry Regiment during the Indian Wars, the Spanish–American War and the Philippine–American War. He was also a painter, inventor, and poet. The son of Edward Otho Cresap Ord, II and grandson of Edward Ord was James Garesche Ord, who commanded the 28th Infantry Division and was Chairman of the Joint U.S.–Brazil Defense Commission in World War II.

==Civil War service==
At the outbreak of the Civil War in April 1861, Ord was serving as Captain of Battery C, 3rd U.S. Artillery, and also as post commander at the U.S. Army&#x27;s Fort Vancouver in Washington Territory. On May 7, 1861, Ord led two companies of the 3rd Artillery from Fort Vancouver to San Francisco. After relocating to the east, Ord&#x27;s first assignment was as a brigade commander in the Pennsylvania Reserves. In this capacity, he figured prominently in the Battle of Dranesville in the fall of 1861.

On May 3, 1862, Ord was promoted to the rank of major general of volunteers and, after briefly serving in the Department of the Rappahannock, was assigned command of the 2nd Division of the Army of the Tennessee. Maj. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant sent Ord with a detachment of two divisions along with Maj. Gen. William S. Rosecrans&#x27;s forces to intercept Sterling Price at the town of Iuka. Due to a possible acoustic shadow Ord&#x27;s forces were never engaged and Rosecrans fought alone. Ord likewise missed the fighting at Corinth but engaged the Confederate forces in their retreat at the Battle of Hatchie&#x27;s Bridge. There he was seriously wounded and had to leave field command only for a short time. When Grant relieved Maj. Gen. John A. McClernand from his command, Ord was conveniently situated to assume command of the XIII Corps during the final days of the Siege of Vicksburg.

After the fall of Vicksburg, Ord remained in command of the XIII Corps in the Department of the Gulf. In 1864, he was transferred back to the Eastern Theater to assume command of the XVIII Corps. His forces were present during the Battle of the Crater but did not actively participate in the fighting. In the fall of 1864, he was seriously wounded in the attack on Fort Harrison and did not return to action until January 1865.

In March 1865, during a prisoner exchange in Virginia, Ord spoke with Confederate General James Longstreet. During their conversation, the subject of peace talks came up. Ord suggested that a first step might be for Lee and Grant to have a meeting. General Longstreet carried this idea back to General Lee, who wrote to Grant about the possibility of a &quot;military convention&quot; in the interest of finding what Lee called &quot;a satisfactory adjustment of the present unhappy difficulties&quot;. Grant forwarded Lee&#x27;s proposal to President Abraham Lincoln, with a request for instructions. In the end, Lincoln directed Grant to decline all such offers unless it was for the explicit purpose of accepting the surrender of Lee&#x27;s army.

It was at this time, during the spring of 1865, that Ord&#x27;s career peaked. He was assigned command of the Army of the James during the Appomattox Campaign. Maj. Gen. John Gibbon&#x27;s corps of Ord&#x27;s army played a significant role in the breakthrough at Petersburg. On April 9, he led a forced march to Appomattox Court House to relieve Maj. Gen. Philip H. Sheridan&#x27;s cavalry and force Lee&#x27;s surrender. General Sherman said that he &quot;had always understood that [Ord&#x27;s] skillful, hard march the night before was one of the chief causes of Lee&#x27;s surrender.&quot;

General Ord was present at the McLean house when Lee surrendered, and is often pictured in paintings of this event. When the surrender ceremony was complete, Ord purchased as a souvenir, for $40, the marble-topped table at which Lee had sat. It now resides in the Chicago Historical Society&#x27;s Civil War Room.

After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln on April 14, 1865, many in the North, including Ulysses S. Grant, wanted strong retribution to be visited upon the Southern states. Grant called upon Ord to find out if the assassination conspiracy extended beyond Washington, D.C. Ord&#x27;s investigation determined the Confederate government was not involved with the assassination plot. This helped greatly to quench the call for revenge on the former Confederate states and people.

==Postbellum==

During Reconstruction, Ord was assigned by Lt. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant to command the Army of Occupation, headquartered at Richmond. Subsequently, he was assigned to the Department of the Ohio until he was mustered out of the volunteers in September 1866. On December 11, 1865, he received the commissions of lieutenant colonel and brigadier general in the regular army for the Battle of Hatchie&#x27;s Bridge and brevet major general of volunteers for the assault of Fort Harrison, all dating from March 13, 1865. Subsequently, he commanded the Department of Arkansas (1866–67), the Fourth Military District (1867–68), and the Department of California (1868–71).

Ord commanded the Department of the Platte from December 11, 1871, until April 11, 1875, when he was reassigned as the commander of the Department of Texas. He served in that role until his retirement on December 6, 1880. While he was stationed in Texas, he supervised the construction of Fort Sam Houston.

In January 1872, Ord was a member of the buffalo hunting excursion with the Grand Duke Alexei Alexandrovich of Russia on the plains of southwest Nebraska with American celebrities of the day. They included Philip Sheridan (second in command of the United States Army), Lt. Col. George Armstrong Custer, Buffalo Bill Cody, Wild Bill Hickok, and Texas Jack Omohundro.

During 1872, General Ord and a soldier detachment were assigned to protect the survey parties of the Wheeler Survey as they worked in the vicinity of northeastern Utah.

In 1876, Ord was appointed military governor of the Fourth Military District which included Mississippi and Arkansas.

Ord retired from the army in 1881 with the rank of brevet major general, and at this time, General Sherman wrote of him, &quot;He has had all the hard knocks of service, and never was on soft or fancy duty. He has always been called on when hard duty was expected, and never flinched.&quot;

Later in 1881, Ord was hired by his former commander, U. S. Grant, president of the Mexican Southern Railroad owned by Jay Gould, as a civil engineer to build a railroad line from Texas to Mexico City.

In 1882, Ord&#x27;s daughter, Roberta, married a prominent Mexican general Jerónimo Treviño.

While working in Mexico, Ord contracted yellow fever. He became seriously sick while on his way from Vera Cruz to New York. He was taken ashore at Havana, Cuba, where he died in the evening of July 22, 1883. On the occasion of his death, General Sherman said of Ord, &quot;As his intimate associate since boyhood, the General here bears testimony of him that a more unselfish, manly, and patriotic person never lived&quot;. He was buried at Arlington National Cemetery, in Arlington, Virginia.

General Ord&#x27;s son, Edward O. C. Ord, Jr., was also an Army officer. Ord, Jr. was a hereditary member of the Military Order of the Loyal Legion of the United States, the Sons of the American Revolution, and the Sons of the Revolution.

<text>, almost always abbreviated &quot;Kansai Gaidai&quot; (関西外大), is located in Hirakata, Osaka, Japan. It is a private university focusing on foreign language studies. Kansai is the proper name of the large region where it is located, which includes the cities of Kyoto, Osaka and Kobe. Gaidai is a contraction of &quot;Gaikokugo Daigaku&quot;, which literally means &quot;foreign language university&quot;. Gaidai is part of Kansai Science City, which is undergoing construction around the campus.

Kansai Gaidai is known for its large Asian Studies program for international exchange students as well as for its Intensive English Studies program for Japanese students planning to study abroad. There are currently two academic campuses: the Nakamiya Campus (中宮キャンパス) and the Hotani Campus (穂谷キャンパス). The original Katahoko campus (片鉾キャンパス) consisted of four dormitories and a gymnasium. Currently, there are about 15,000 students enrolled including two year and four year students from across all regions of Japan. Students from dozens of countries are also present for the majority of the year.

==University Background==
Tanimoto English School, the forerunner of Kansai Gaidai University, was established in 1945. The original Katahoko campus was founded in 1966 as a University of Foreign Studies. Today, the Katahoko campus has been converted into a public park and a municipal library. In 1972, the Asian Studies Program was formally established. The Hotani Campus was established in 1984 and currently houses the Department of International Communication and a Confucius Institute. The Nakamiya campus opened in April 2002, and now operates as the main campus of the university. In 2018, the Gakkentoshi campus moved to nearby Gotenyama, within walking distance of the main Nakamiya campus. Gotenyama Campus - Global Town officially opened on April 1, 2018 and had a dedication ceremony on June 9, 2018. New seminar houses are being planned as well to host both international and Japanese students alike. The university is also known for the collaborative effort in the formulation of the Genki Series, books used by dozens of schools to teach Japanese. Several Kansai Gaidai teachers contributed to its teaching methodology and publication.

==Asian Studies Program==
The Asian Studies Program is located in the Center for International Education at the Nakamiya Campus. Students from all over the world and with various majors participate in this program which is one of the largest in the area. An integral part of the program is the Speaking Partners Program which pairs incoming foreign exchange students with a local Kansai Gaidai student who helps with the adjustment of living in Japan. KGU itself sends about 1,500 students abroad every year to study abroad all over the globe.

Another part of the exchange program is the home stay program which places a limited number of students with local families to provide an immersive Japanese cultural and societal experience. For those students who were unable to get a spot in the home stay program, the school offers a home visit program which pairs a foreign exchange student with a family so that the student may visit them and participate in families activities usually weekly or as determined by the student and the family.

Accommodation for foreign exchange students are located in the Seminar Houses. Numbered 1 through 4, each house is located around the Katahoko Library and a 20-minute walk from the Nakamiya Campus. Seminar Houses 1, 2 and 4 are dormitory style with usually two students to a room with entire dormitory shared facilities. While Seminar House 3 is an apartment style dormitory with students sharing common living quarters and kitchens while sleeping in 4 separate rooms. Seminar House 4 is the newest and largest of the Seminar Houses and is the only one that is wheelchair accessible at this time. Seminar House 4 houses the most students and is the closest to the Nakamiya campus.

The newest dorm, built in 2018 on the Gotenyama campus, is called GLOBAL COMMONS 結 -YUI-. The dorm has 27 units, in which there are 23 or 27 single rooms. The facility is able to accommodate 650 students. Both international and local students live in this residence. The main concept of the dorm is inter-cultural communication and the diversity of cultures and countries represented.

There is a strict zero tolerance policy against alcohol consumption in Seminar Houses and YUI, although during fall 2008 semester, Seminar House 4 was the location of a pilot project for reasonable and controlled consumption of alcohol within the Seminar House. Results of the pilot project have not been announced nor published although this project did not continue to the spring 2009 semester. As of 2010, alcohol is banned in all seminar houses after an incident.

In 2023, a homecoming for alumni of the program was held for the first time on campus to celebrate the 50 years of its existence.

==International Festival==
Every year during the fall semester, Kansai Gaidai University authorizes local and international Gaidai students to organize a grandiose 2-day Gaidai Festival, held throughout the Nakamiya campus. The festival is usually held the week after the Halloween bash and is the largest event of the academic year. Various foods are prepared and student-led university clubs hold exhibitions.

==Summer Program==
For the first time in 2015, Kansai Gaidai held a six-week intensive summer program for 20 students, focusing on Japanese language and Japanese history with several cultural activities.

The program takes place at Kansai Gaidai’s Nakamiya campus and lasts from June to July. Each week the students receive 15 hours of Japanese lessons and three hours of Japanese history lessons. The current schedule also includes several cultural activities where students can get on-hand experience of what they have learned about in class.

This course is aimed at those who have no previous experience in Japanese. Students can also travel around the country during and after the program.

In 2020, due to COVID-19, the program was suspended altogether. Additionally in 2021, the program switched to an online format.

==TEDxGaidai==
TedxGaidai was founded in April 2012. It is an international community which comes together in Kansai Gaidai&#x27;s ICC building once a month to discuss TED videos and how the ideas relate to all of us. Following the discussion time, facilitators will mix students with different members to recap what they have talked about. Finally, the seminar ends with any comments about what was discussed at any time during the evening. A short survey is administered at the end to hear student feedback.

==Unions==
Some staff at Kansai Gaidai University are represented by the General Union, a member of the National Union of General Workers (NUGW), which is itself a member of the National Trade Union Council (Zenrokyo).
