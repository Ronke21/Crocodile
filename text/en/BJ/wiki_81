<text>Brian O&#x27;Nolan (; 5 October 19111 April 1966), his pen name being Flann O&#x27;Brien, was an Irish civil service official, novelist, playwright and satirist, who is now considered a major figure in twentieth-century Irish literature. Born in Strabane, County Tyrone, he is regarded as a key figure in modernist and postmodern literature. His English language novels, such as &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; and &quot;The Third Policeman&quot;, were written under the O&#x27;Brien pen name. His many satirical columns in &quot;The Irish Times&quot; and an Irish-language novel, &quot;An Béal Bocht&quot;, were written under the name Myles na gCopaleen.

O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s novels have attracted a wide following both for their unconventional humour and as prominent examples of modernist metafiction. As a novelist, O&#x27;Brien was influenced by James Joyce. He was nonetheless sceptical of the &quot;cult&quot; of Joyce, saying &quot;I declare to God if I hear that name Joyce one more time I will surely froth at the gob.&quot;

==Biography==
===Family and early life===
O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s father, Michael Vincent O&#x27;Nolan, was a pre-independence United Kingdom (i.e., then England, Scotland, Wales and Ireland) civil service official in HM Customs, a role that required frequent moves between cities and towns in England, Scotland and Ireland. Although of apparently trenchant Irish republican views, he did, because of his role and employment, need to be discreet about them. At the formation of the Irish Free State in 1921, O&#x27;Nolan senior joined the Irish Revenue Commissioners.

O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s career as a writer extended from his student days, through his years in the Irish civil service and the years following his resignation.

O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s mother, Agnes (née Gormley), was also from an Irish nationalist family in Strabane, and this, then and now largely nationalist and Catholic town, formed somewhat of a base for the family during an otherwise peripatetic childhood. Brian was the third of 12 children; Gearóid, Ciarán, Roisin, Fergus, Kevin, Maeve, Nessa, Nuala, Sheila, Niall, and Micheál (in that period, known as the Gaelic Revival, giving one’s children Gaelic names was somewhat of a political statement.) Though relatively well-off and upwardly mobile, the O&#x27;Nolan children were home-schooled for part of their childhood using a correspondence course created by his father, who would send it to them from wherever his work took him. It was not until his father was permanently assigned to Dublin that Brian and his siblings regularly attended school.

===School days===
O&#x27;Brien attended Synge Street Christian Brothers School, Dublin of which his novel &quot;The Hard Life&quot; contains a semi-autobiographical depiction. The Christian Brothers in Ireland had a reputation for excessive, prolific and unnecessary use of violence and corporal punishment, which sometimes inflicted lifelong psychological trauma upon their pupils.

Blackrock College, however, where O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s education continued, was run by the Holy Ghost Fathers, who were considered more intellectual and less likely to use corporal punishment against their students. Blackrock was, and remains a very prominent school, having educated many of the leaders of post-independence Ireland, including presidents, taoisigh (prime ministers), government ministers, businessmen and the elite of &quot;Official Ireland&quot; and their children.

O&#x27;Brien was taught English by the President of the College, and future Archbishop, John Charles McQuaid.

According to Farragher and Wyer:

Dr McQuaid himself was recognised as an outstanding English teacher, and when one of his students, Brian O&#x27;Nolan, alias Myles na gCopaleen, boasted in his absence to the rest of the class that there were only two people in the College who could write English properly, namely, Dr McQuaid and himself, they had no hesitation in agreeing. And Dr McQuaid did Myles the honour of publishing a little verse by him in the first issue of the revived College Annual (1930)—this being Myles&#x27; first published item.

The poem itself, &quot;Ad Astra&quot;, read as follows:
&lt;poem&gt;
Ah! When the skies at night
Are damascened with gold,
Methinks the endless sight
Eternity unrolled.
&lt;/poem&gt;

===Student years===
O&#x27;Brien wrote prodigiously during his years as a student at University College Dublin (UCD), which was then situated in various buildings around Dublin&#x27;s south city centre (with its numerous pubs and cafés). There he was an active, and controversial, member of the well-known Literary and Historical Society. He contributed to the student magazine, called in Irish &quot;Comhthrom Féinne&quot; (&quot;Fair Play&quot;), under various guises, in particular the pseudonym Brother Barnabas. Significantly, he composed a story during this same period titled &quot;Scenes in a Novel (probably posthumous) by Brother Barnabas&quot;, which anticipates many of the ideas and themes later to be found in his novel, &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot;. In it, the putative author of the story finds himself in riotous conflict with his characters, who are determined to follow their own paths regardless of the author&#x27;s design. For example, the villain of the story, one Carruthers McDaid, intended by the author as the lowest form of a scoundrel, &quot;meant to sink slowly to absolutely the last extremities of human degradation&quot;, instead ekes out a modest living selling cats to elderly ladies and begins covertly attending Mass without the author&#x27;s consent. Meanwhile, the story&#x27;s hero, Shaun Svoolish, chooses a comfortable, bourgeois life rather than romance and heroics:

:&#x27;I may be a prig&#x27;, he replied, &#x27;but I know what I like. Why can&#x27;t I marry Bridie and have a shot at the Civil Service?&#x27;
:&#x27;Railway accidents are fortunately rare&#x27;, I said finally, &#x27;but when they happen they are horrible. Think it over.&#x27;

In 1934 O&#x27;Brien and his university friends founded a short-lived literary magazine called &quot;Blather&quot;. The writing here, though clearly bearing the marks of youthful bravado, again somewhat anticipates O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s later work, in this case, his &quot;Cruiskeen Lawn&quot; column as Myles na gCopaleen:

:&quot;Blather&quot; is here. As we advance to make our bow, you will look in vain for signs of servility or of any evidence of a desire to please. We are an arrogant and depraved body of men. We are as proud as bantams and as vain as peacocks.

:&quot;Blather&quot; doesn&#x27;t care. A sardonic laugh escapes us as we bow, cruel and cynical hounds that we are. It is a terrible laugh, the laugh of lost men. Do you get the smell of porter?

O&#x27;Brien, who had studied German in Dublin, may have spent at least parts of 1933 and 1934 staying in Nazi Germany, namely in Cologne and Bonn, although details are uncertain and contested. He claimed himself, in 1965, that he &quot;spent many months in the Rhineland and at Bonn drifting away from the strict pursuit of study.&quot; So far, no external evidence has turned up that would back up this sojourn (or an also anecdotal short-term marriage to one &#x27;Clara Ungerland&#x27; from Cologne). In their biography, Costello and van de Kamp, discussing the inconclusive evidence, state that &quot;...it must remain a mystery, in the absence of documented evidence an area of mere speculation, representing in a way the other mysteries of the life of Brian O&#x27;Nolan that still defy the researcher.&quot;

===Civil service===
A key feature of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s personal situation was his status as an Irish civil servant, who, as a result of his father&#x27;s relatively early death in July 1937, was for a decade obliged to partially support his mother and ten siblings, including an elder brother who was then an unsuccessful writer (there would likely have been some pension for his mother and minor siblings resulting from his father&#x27;s service); however, other siblings enjoyed considerable professional success. One, Kevin (also known as Caoimhín Ó Nualláin), was a Professor of Ancient Classics at University College, Dublin; yet another, Micheál Ó Nualláin was a noted artist; another, Ciarán Ó Nualláin, was a writer, novelist, publisher and journalist. Given the desperate poverty of Ireland in the 1930s to 1960s, a job as a civil servant was considered prestigious, being both secure and pensionable with a reliable cash income in a largely agrarian economy. The Irish civil service has been, since the Irish Civil War, fairly strictly apolitical. Civil Service Regulations and the service&#x27;s internal culture generally prohibit Civil Servants above the level of Clerical Officer from publicly expressing political views. As a practical matter, this meant that writing in newspapers on current events was, during O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s career, generally prohibited without departmental permission which would be granted on an article-by-article, publication-by-publication basis. This fact alone contributed to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s use of pseudonyms, though he had started to create character authors even in his pre-civil service writings.

O&#x27;Brien rose to be quite senior, serving as private secretary to Seán T. O&#x27;Kelly (a minister and later President of Ireland) and Seán MacEntee, a powerful political figure, both of whom almost certainly knew or guessed O&#x27;Brien was na gCopaleen. Though O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s writing frequently mocked the civil service, he was for much of his career relatively important and highly regarded and was trusted with delicate tasks and policies, such as running (as &quot;secretary&quot;) the public inquiry into the Cavan Orphanage Fire of 1943 and planning of a proposed Irish National Health Service imitating the UK&#x27;s, under the auspices of his department—planning he duly mocked in his pseudonymous column.

In reality, that Brian O&#x27;Nolan was Flann O&#x27;Brien and Myles na gCopaleen was an open secret, largely disregarded by his colleagues, who found his writing very entertaining; this was a function of the makeup of the civil service, which recruited leading graduates by competitive examination. It was an erudite and relatively liberal body in the Ireland of the 1930s to the 1970s. Nonetheless, had O&#x27;Nolan forced the issue, by using one of his known pseudonyms or his own name for an article that seriously upset politicians, consequences would likely have followed—contributing to the acute pseudonym problem in attributing his work today.

A combination of his gradually deepening alcoholism, legendarily outrageous behaviour when, frequently, inebriated, and his habit of making derogatory and increasingly reckless remarks about senior politicians in his newspaper columns led to his forced retirement from the civil service in 1953 after enraging a minister who realised he was the unnamed target whose intellect was ridiculed in several columns. One column described the politician&#x27;s reaction to any question requiring even a trace of intellectual effort as &quot;[t]he great jaw would drop, the ruined graveyard of tombstone teeth would be revealed, the eyes would roll, and the malt eroded voice would say &#x27;Hah?&#x27;&quot; (He departed, recalled a colleague, &quot;in a final fanfare of fucks&quot;.)

===Personal life===
Although O&#x27;Brien was a well-known character in Dublin during his lifetime, relatively little is known about his personal life. He joined the Irish civil service in 1935, working in the Department of Local Government. For a decade or so after his father&#x27;s death in 1937, he helped support his brothers and sisters, eleven in total, on his income. On 2 December 1948 he married Evelyn McDonnell, a typist in the Department of Local Government. On his marriage he moved from his parental home in Blackrock to nearby Merrion Avenue, living at several further locations in South Dublin before his death. The couple had no children. Evelyn died on 18 April 1995.

===Health and death===

O&#x27;Brien was an alcoholic for much of his life and suffered from ill health in his later years. He was afflicted with cancer of the throat and died from a heart attack on the morning of 1 April 1966. In a piece published a few months before his death, he also reported a secondary cancer diagnosis and hospitalisations due to uraemia (a sign of liver failure) and pleurisy: in typical good-humour O&#x27;Brien attributed this declining health to &quot;St Augustine&#x27;s vengeance&quot; over his treatment in &quot;The Dalkey Archive&quot;.

==Journalism and other writings==
From late 1940 to early 1966, O&#x27;Brien wrote short columns for &quot;The Irish Times&quot; under the title &quot;Cruiskeen Lawn&quot;, using the moniker Myles na gCopaleen (changing that to Myles na Gopaleen in late 1952, having put the column on hold for most of that year). For the first year, the columns were in Irish. Then, he alternated columns in Irish with columns in English, but by late 1953 he had settled on English only. His newspaper column, &quot;Cruiskeen Lawn&quot; (transliterated from the Irish &quot;crúiscín lán&quot;, meaning &quot;full/brimming small-jug&quot;), has its origins in a series of pseudonymous letters written to &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, originally intended to mock the publication in that same newspaper of a poem, &quot;Spraying the Potatoes&quot;, by the writer Patrick Kavanagh:

&quot;The Irish Times&quot; has, traditionally, published a lot of letters from readers, devoting a full page daily to such letters, which are widely read. Often an epistolary series, some written by O&#x27;Brien and some not, continued for days and weeks under a variety of false names, using various styles and assailed varied topics, including other earlier letters by O&#x27;Brien under different pseudonyms. The letters were a hit with the readers of &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, and R. M. Smyllie, then editor of the newspaper invited O&#x27;Brien to contribute a column. Importantly, &quot;The Irish Times&quot; maintained that there were in fact three pseudonymous authors of the &quot;Cruiskeen Lawn&quot; column, which provided a certain amount of cover for O&#x27;Nolan as a civil servant when a column was particularly provocative (though it was mostly O&#x27;Brien). The managing editor of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; for much of the period, Gerard &quot;Cully&quot; Tynan O&#x27;Mahony (father of the comedian Dave Allen), a personal friend and drinking companion of O&#x27;Brien, and likely one of the other occasional authors of the column, was typically one of those pressed for a name but was skilfully evasive on the topic. (Relations are said to have decayed when O&#x27;Nolan somehow snatched and absconded with O&#x27;Mahoney&#x27;s prosthetic leg during a drinking session [the original had been lost on military service].)

The first column appeared on 4 October 1940, under the pseudonym &quot;An Broc&quot; (&quot;The Badger&quot;). In all subsequent columns, the name &quot;Myles na gCopaleen&quot; (&quot;Myles of the Little Horses&quot; or &quot;Myles of the Ponies&quot;—a name taken from &quot;The Collegians&quot;, a novel by Gerald Griffin) was used. Initially, the column was composed in Irish, but soon English was used primarily, with occasional smatterings of German, French or Latin. The sometimes intensely satirical column&#x27;s targets included the Dublin literary elite, Irish language revivalists, the Irish government, and the &quot;Plain People of Ireland&quot;. The following column excerpt, in which the author wistfully recalls a brief sojourn in Germany as a student, illustrates the biting humour and scorn that informed the &quot;Cruiskeen Lawn&quot; writings:

Ó Nuallain/na gCopaleen wrote &quot;Cruiskeen Lawn&quot; for &quot;The Irish Times&quot; until the year of his death, 1966.
He contributed substantially to &quot;Envoy&quot; (he was &quot;honorary editor&quot; for the special number featuring James Joyce) and formed part of the (famously heavy drinking) &quot;Envoy&quot; / McDaid&#x27;s pub circle of artistic and literary figures that included Patrick Kavanagh, Anthony Cronin, Brendan Behan, John Jordan, Pearse Hutchinson, J. P. Donleavy and artist Desmond MacNamara who, at the author&#x27;s request, created the book cover for the first edition of &quot;The Dalkey Archive.&quot; O&#x27;Brien also contributed to &quot;The Bell&quot;. He also wrote a column titled &quot;Bones of Contention&quot; for the &quot;Nationalist and Leinster Times&quot; under the pseudonym George Knowall; those were collected in the volume &quot;Myles Away From Dublin&quot;.

Most of his later writings were occasional pieces published in periodicals, some of very limited circulation, which explains why his work has only recently come to enjoy the considered attention of literary scholars. O&#x27;Brien was also notorious for his prolific use and creation of pseudonyms for much of his writing, including short stories, essays, and letters to editors, and even perhaps novels, which has rendered the compilation of a complete bibliography of his writings an almost impossible task. Under pseudonyms, he regularly wrote to various newspapers, particularly &quot;The Irish Times&quot;, waspish letters targeting various well-known figures and writers; mischievously, some of the pseudonymous author-identities reflected composite caricatures of existing people, this would also fuel speculation as to whether his model (or models) for the character was in fact the author writing under a pseudonym, apparently leading to social controversy and angry arguments and accusations. He would allegedly write letters to the editor of &quot;The Irish Times&quot; complaining about his own articles published in that newspaper, for example in his regular &quot;Cruiskeen Lawn&quot; column, or irate, eccentric and even mildly deranged pseudonymous responses to his own pseudonymous letters, which gave rise to rampant speculation as to whether the author of a published letter existed or not, or who it might in fact be. There is also persistent speculation that he wrote some of a very long series of penny dreadful detective novels (and stories) featuring a protagonist called Sexton Blake under the pseudonym Stephen Blakesley, he may have been the early science fiction writer John Shamus O&#x27;Donnell, who published in &quot;Amazing Stories&quot; at least one science fiction story in 1932, while there is also speculation about author names such as John Hackett, Peter the Painter (an obvious pun on a Mauser pistol favoured by the war of independence and civil war IRA and an eponymous anarchist), Winnie Wedge, John James Doe and numerous others. Not surprisingly, much of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s pseudonymous activity has not been verified.

==Etymology==
O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s journalistic pseudonym is taken from a character (Myles-na-Coppaleen) in Dion Boucicault&#x27;s play &quot;The Colleen Bawn&quot; (itself an adaptation of Gerald Griffin&#x27;s &quot;The Collegians&quot;), who is the stereotypical charming Irish rogue. At one point in the play, he sings the ancient anthem of the Irish Brigades on the Continent, the song &quot;An Crúiscín Lán&quot; (hence the name of the column in the &quot;Irish Times&quot;).

&quot;Capall&quot; is the Irish word for &quot;horse&quot; (from Vulgar Latin &quot;caballus&quot;), and &quot;een&quot; (spelled &quot;ín&quot; in Irish) is a diminutive suffix. The prefix &quot;na gCapaillín&quot; is the genitive plural in his Ulster Irish dialect (the Standard Irish would be &quot;Myles na gCapaillíní&quot;), so Myles na gCopaleen means &quot;Myles of the Little Horses&quot;. &quot;Capaillín&quot; is also the Irish word for &quot;pony&quot;, as in the name of Ireland&#x27;s most famous and ancient native horse breed, the Connemara pony.

O&#x27;Brien himself always insisted on the translation &quot;Myles of the Ponies&quot;, saying that he did not see why the principality of the pony should be subjugated to the imperialism of the horse.

==Fiction==

===&quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot;===

&quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; works entirely with borrowed characters from other fiction and legend, on the grounds that there are already far too many existing fictional characters.

The book is recognised as one of the most significant modernist novels before 1945. It has also been read as a pioneer of postmodernism, although the academic Keith Hopper has argued that &quot;The Third Policeman&quot;, superficially less radical, is actually a more deeply subversive and proto-postmodernist work, and as such, possibly a representation of literary nonsense. It was one of the last books that James Joyce read and he praised it to O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s friends—praise which was subsequently used for years as a blurb on reprints of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s novels. The book was also praised by Graham Greene, who was working as a reader when the book was put forward for publication. Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges, whose work might be said to bear some similarities to that of O&#x27;Brien, praised the book in his essay &quot;When Fiction Lives in Fiction&quot;.

The British writer Anthony Burgess stated, &quot;If we don&#x27;t cherish the work of Flann O&#x27;Brien we are stupid fools who don&#x27;t deserve to have great men. Flann O&#x27;Brien is a very great man.&quot; Burgess included &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; on his list of &quot;Ninety-Nine Novels: The Best in English since 1939&quot;. &quot;At Swim-Two-Birds&quot; has had a troubled publication history in the USA. Southern Illinois University Press has set up a Flann O&#x27;Brien Center and begun publishing all of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s works. Consequently, academic attention to the novel has increased.

===&quot;The Third Policeman&quot; and &quot;The Dalkey Archive&quot;===

The rejection of &quot;The Third Policeman&quot; by publishers in his lifetime had a profound effect on O&#x27;Brien. This is perhaps reflected in &quot;The Dalkey Archive&quot;, in which sections of &quot;The Third Policeman&quot; are recycled almost word for word, namely the atomic theory and the character De Selby.

&quot;The Third Policeman&quot; has a fantastic plot of a murderous protagonist let loose in a strange world peopled by overweight policemen, played against a satire of academic debate on an eccentric philosopher called De Selby. Sergeant Pluck introduces the atomic theory of the bicycle.

&quot;The Dalkey Archive&quot; features a character who encounters a penitent, elderly and apparently unbalanced James Joyce (who dismissively refers to his work by saying &#x27;I have published little&#x27; and, furthermore, does not seem aware of having written and published &quot;Finnegans Wake&quot;) working as an assistant barman or &#x27;curate&#x27;—another small joke relating to Joyce&#x27;s alleged priestly ambitions—in the resort of Skerries. The scientist De Selby seeks to suck all of the air out of the world, and Policeman Pluck learns of the molecule theory from Sergeant Fottrell. &quot;The Dalkey Archive&quot; was adapted for the stage in September 1965 by Hugh Leonard as &quot;The Saints Go Cycling In&quot;.

===Other fiction===
Other books written by O&#x27;Brien include &quot;An Béal Bocht&quot;—translated from the Irish as &quot;The Poor Mouth&quot;—(a parody of Tomás Ó Criomhthain&#x27;s autobiography &quot;An t-Oileánach&quot;—in English &quot;The Islander&quot;), and &quot;The Hard Life&quot; (a fictional autobiography meant to be his &quot;masterpiece&quot;). As noted above he may, between 1946 and 1952, have been one of the writers to use the pseudonym Stephen Blakesley to write up to eight books of the protracted series of &quot;penny dreadful&quot; Sexton Blake novels and stories, and he may have written yet more fiction under a wide array of pseudonyms.

O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s theatrical output was unsuccessful. &quot;Faustus Kelly&quot;, a play about a local councillor selling his soul to the devil for a seat in the Dáil, ran for only 11 performances in 1943. A second play, &quot;Rhapsody in Stephen&#x27;s Green&quot;, also called &quot;The Insect Play&quot;, was a reworking of the Capek Brothers&#x27; synonymous play using anthropomorphised insects to satirise society. It also was put on in 1943 but quickly folded, possibly because of the offence it gave to various interests including Catholics, Ulster Protestants, Irish civil servants, Corkmen, and the Fianna Fail party. The play was thought lost, but was rediscovered in 1994 in the archives of Northwestern University.

In 1956, O&#x27;Brien was co-producer of a production for RTÉ, the Irish broadcaster, of &quot;3 Radio Ballets&quot;, which was just what it said it was—a dance performance in three parts designed for and performed on radio.

==Legacy==
O&#x27;Brien influenced the science fiction writer and conspiracy theory satirist Robert Anton Wilson, who has O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s character De Selby, an obscure intellectual in &quot;The Third Policeman&quot; and &quot;The Dalkey Archive&quot;, appear in his own &quot;The Widow&#x27;s Son&quot;. In both &quot;The Third Policeman&quot; and &quot;The Widow&#x27;s Son&quot;, De Selby is the subject of long pseudo-scholarly footnotes. This is fitting, because O&#x27;Brien himself made free use of characters invented by other writers, claiming that there were too many fictional characters as is. O&#x27;Brien was also known for pulling the reader&#x27;s leg by concocting elaborate conspiracy theories.

An award-winning radio play by Albrecht Behmel called &quot;Ist das Ihr Fahrrad, Mr. O&#x27;Brien?&quot; brought his life and work to the attention of a broader German audience in 2003. 

In 2011 the &#x27;100 Myles: The International Flann O&#x27;Brien Centenary Conference&#x27; (24–27 July) was held at The Department of English Studies at the University of Vienna, the success of which led to the establishment of &#x27;The International Flann O&#x27;Brien Society&#x27; (IFOBS). Each year the IFOBS announces awards for both books and articles about O&#x27;Brien. In October 2011, Trinity College Dublin hosted a weekend of events celebrating the centenary of his birth. A commemorative 55c stamp featuring a portrait of O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s head as drawn by his brother Micheál Ó Nualláin was issued for the same occasion. This occurred some 52 years after the writer&#x27;s famous criticism of the Irish postal service. A bronze sculpture of the writer stands outside the Palace Bar on Dublin&#x27;s Fleet Street. Kevin Myers said, &quot;Had Myles escaped he might have become a literary giant.&quot; Fintan O&#x27;Toole said of O&#x27;Brien &quot;he could have been a celebrated national treasure – but he was far too radical for that.&quot; 

O&#x27;Brien has also been semi-seriously referred to as a &quot;scientific prophet&quot; in relation to his writings on thermodynamics, quaternion theory and atomic theory.

In 2012, on the 101st anniversary of his birth, O&#x27;Brien was honoured with a commemorative Google Doodle.

His life and works were celebrated on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Great Lives&quot; in December 2017.

In &quot;The Guardian&quot; feature &quot;My Hero&quot;, John Banville chose O&#x27;Brien, writing: &quot;O’Brien was a philistine as well as a consummate prose stylist, an artist who threw away his talent, a Catholic who allowed himself to drift into the sin of despair, and a great comic sensibility thwarted and shrivelled by emotional self-denial. He would have laughed at the notion of being anybody’s hero.&quot;

The podcast Radio Myles by Toby Harris features interviews with notable scholars discussing O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s works. The BBC radio show The Exploding Library dedicated an episode to &quot;The Third Policeman&quot;.

<doc id="371185" wikidata="Q1623411" url="?curid=371185" title="Who's the Boss?">
<text>Who&#x27;s the Boss? is an American sitcom television series created by Martin Cohan and Blake Hunter, that aired on ABC from September 20, 1984, to April 25, 1992, with a total of 196 half-hour episodes spanning eight seasons. It was produced by Hunter-Cohan Productions in association with Embassy Television (later Embassy Communications and ELP Communications) and Columbia Pictures Television and stars Tony Danza as Tony Micelli, a former Major League Baseball athlete who strives to raise his daughter, Samantha Micelli (Alyssa Milano), outside of the hectic nature of New York City and relocates her to Fairfield, Connecticut, where he works as a live-in housekeeper for a single advertising executive named Angela Bower (Judith Light). The series&#x27; cast also includes Katherine Helmond as Angela&#x27;s mother, Mona Robinson, and Danny Pintauro as Angela&#x27;s young son, Jonathan Bower.

The show became one of the most popular sitcoms of the 1980s. The series was nominated for more than 40 awards, including ten Primetime Emmy Awards and five Golden Globe Award nominations, winning one of each, although early reviews of the series were lukewarm. Also very successful in the ratings, &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; ranked in the top ten in the final primetime ratings between 1985 and 1989, and has since continued in syndication worldwide.

==Plot==
Widower Anthony Morton &quot;Tony&quot; Micelli is a former Major League Baseball player who was forced to retire due to a shoulder injury. Wanting to move out of Brooklyn to find a better environment for his daughter, Samantha, he takes a job in the upscale suburb of Fairfield, Connecticut, as a live-in housekeeper for divorced advertising executive Angela Bower and her young son Jonathan. He and Samantha move into the Bower home. Also appearing is Angela&#x27;s feisty, sexually progressive mother Mona Robinson, who dates all kinds of men, from college-age to silver-haired CEOs.

The title of the show refers to the role reversal of Tony and Angela. Angela is the breadwinner of the home, and Tony (although he is not her husband) stays at home to take care of the household and provides guidance and support to the children, Samantha and Jonathan. It challenged contemporary stereotypes of young, Italian-American males as macho, boorish, and wholly ignorant of life outside of urban working-class neighborhoods. Tony was depicted as sensitive, intelligent, and domestic with an interest in intellectual pursuits, and yet still athletic and streetwise.

The easy-going, spontaneous Tony and the driven, self-controlled Angela are attracted to each other, though both are uncomfortable with the notion for much of the show&#x27;s run. While there is playful banter and many hints of their feelings for each other, Tony and Angela do their best to avoid facing this aspect of their developing relationship and date other people. Angela has a steady romantic interest in Geoffrey Wells (Robin Thomas), while Tony has a variety of girlfriends who come and go, including Kathleen Sawyer (Kate Vernon) in seasons six and seven. In the meantime, however, they become best friends, relying on each other frequently for emotional support. In addition, Tony provides a male role model for Jonathan, while Angela and Mona give Samantha the womanly guidance she had been missing.

Keeping ties with Tony&#x27;s and Samantha&#x27;s Brooklyn roots is motherly former neighbor Mrs. Rossini (Rhoda Gemignani), who ends up becoming a thorn in Mona&#x27;s side. Several other friends turn up a few times each season, sometimes in New York, sometimes in Connecticut.

Angela eventually strikes out on her own and opens an ad firm in season three, while Tony decides to go back to school at Fairfield University, enrolling in the same college that daughter Samantha would later attend. Samantha&#x27;s best friend Bonnie (Shana Lane-Block) is a recurring character during these seasons, while romance comes into her life in the form of her boyfriend Jesse Nash (Scott Bloom) during her sophomore year of high school.

At the start of season eight, Tony and Angela finally acknowledge their love for each other. However, the series does not end with the widely expected marriage but on a more ambiguous note. This was due primarily to concerns by the network that a marriage, representing a definitive ending, could hurt syndication. Tony Danza also vehemently opposed the marriage, saying it would contradict the original purpose of the show.

During the final season, Samantha finds a new love in Hank Thomopoulous (Curnal Achilles Aulisio) who became a full-time character in January 1992. A fellow college student, Hank was originally poised to enter a medical program, but soon decides to become a puppeteer. Sam and Hank marry after an engagement lasting a matter of weeks.

==Background==
&quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; was created by television producers and business partners Martin Cohan and Blake Hunter in 1983. In early development, the series was titled &quot;You&#x27;re the Boss&quot;, about Angela employing Tony and the gender role reversal. Before the fall 1984 premiere, the producers changed it to &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot;, an open-ended title which hinted that any one of the leads could get their way and be the &quot;boss&quot;. Unlike Danza, who had served as the Tony prototype from the beginning, Judith Light was one of many who auditioned for the role of Angela. She was eventually cast based on her performance, which Hunter commented was a &quot;class [...] Jean Harlow type, or more of a Meryl Streep.&quot; The character of Mona was initially created as an older sister to Angela, but as Cohan and Hunter struggled to handle the casting of the role, they decided on re-writing the role into &quot;a free spirit with a quick tongue,&quot; who they envisioned Katherine Helmond to play. Danny Pintauro and Alyssa Milano were also cast based on their auditions.

The series&#x27; pilot was shot in November 1983, a full 10 months before the show actually went on the air. ABC originally was planning to put it on mid-season in January 1984, but due to creative differences between the producers and the network, the show was delayed until the next season. The show debuted on September 20, 1984, up against the debut of another sitcom, NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;.

In the fall of 1991, after seven years on its established Tuesday night slot, &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; was moved to Saturday nights at 8:00 p.m. (against NBC&#x27;s &quot;The Golden Girls&quot;), along with fellow long-running sitcom &quot;Growing Pains&quot;. In February 1992, ABC added the long-running &quot;Perfect Strangers&quot; and the new cartoon &quot;Capitol Critters&quot; to the night. It was promoted as the new &quot;I Love Saturday Night&quot; lineup, an equivalent to the hit Friday &quot;TGIF&quot; block. &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; moved to 8:30 p.m., with &quot;Capital Critters&quot; as its lead-in. The &quot;I Love Saturday Night&quot; banner proved to be short-lived, folding on February 29, 1992; &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; moved back into the Saturday 8/7c slot in early March.

The series&#x27;s ratings dropped significantly in its new time slot, and the decision was made to end the series in the spring of 1992. The hour-long series finale aired on Saturday, April 25, 1992, along with the finales for &quot;Growing Pains&quot; and &quot;MacGyver.&quot; &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; reruns continued to air through the summer.

==Influence==

===Critical reception===
Early reviews of the series were lukewarm. Jerry Buck, writing for &quot;Ocala Star-Banner&quot;, noted that while the series &quot;doesn&#x27;t have the same impact [as &quot;The Cosby Show&quot;], it&#x27;s not bad, either.&quot; He compared Danza and Light&#x27;s on-screen chemistry to Katharine Hepburn and Spencer Tracy. &quot;The Pittsburgh Press&quot; criticized that &quot;the show may have a universal theme [but] it&#x27;s hard to find,&quot; while Duane Dudek of &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot; summed the series as a &quot;pleasant little sitcom&quot; which was not a &quot;struggle for mastery [but] in some ways, a rather old-fashioned love story.&quot; John J. O&#x27;Connor of &quot;The New York Times&quot; was complimentary of the female leads, Light and Helmond, but was concerned if Danza, who &quot;spends a good deal of time with his shirt off and his thick weight-lifted physique&quot; would &quot;keep this sitcom in ratings shape.&quot;

===Awards and nominations===
&quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; was nominated for more than forty awards, including ten Primetime Emmy Award and five Golden Globe Award nominations, winning one each; Katherine Helmond received the 1989 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress – Series, Miniseries or Television Film, while Mark J. Levin was awarded the 1989 Emmy Award for Outstanding Lighting Direction for a Comedy Series for his work on the episode &quot;Two on a Billboard.&quot; Frequently nominated at the annual Young Artist Awards, Milano earned three awards for her portrayal of Samantha. Danny Pintauro and recurring guest Scott Bloom received one award each.

==Theme song==

The show&#x27;s theme song, &quot;Brand New Life&quot;, was written by series creators and executive producers Cohan and Hunter, with music composed by Larry Carlton and Robert Kraft. Three versions were used throughout the series&#x27; run, which were performed by Larry Weiss (1984–1986), Steve Wariner (1986–1990), and Jonathan Wolff (1990–1992). The third version was first used for the last eight episodes of season six, and a very minor revision of that particular version of the theme was used during seasons seven and eight.

The first line of the theme song was changed from &quot;There is more to life than what you&#x27;re living&quot; to &quot;There&#x27;s a time for love and a time for living&quot; in season three onwards.

===Home media===
Columbia TriStar Home Entertainment released the first season of &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; on DVD in Region 1 on June 8, 2004. The remaining seven seasons have yet to be released due to copyright issues.

==Spin-offs==
The first attempted &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; spin-off had its origins in the second to final episode of season two, &quot;Charmed Lives&quot;, a backdoor pilot for a program about two women up for the same job as well as overall being a series about the lives of single career women in the &#x27;80s. Starring Fran Drescher and Donna Dixon, it was not picked up as a series.

In 1987, producers had planned a spin-off entitled &quot;Mona&quot;, which focused on Mona&#x27;s character leaving Angela to help her brother Cornelius run a seedy hotel in Manhattan. The third season featured this plot in a two-part episode, but when ABC changed their mind about the spinoff, fearing what Mona&#x27;s departure could mean to the show, the ending was rewritten to feature Mona returning to Angela&#x27;s home.

The third attempted spin-off, which did make it to series, was titled &quot;Living Dolls&quot;. Premiering and ending in 1989, the show starred Leah Remini, Michael Learned, and Halle Berry. The show featured Remini, who had appeared in two &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss&quot;? episodes as a friend of Samantha&#x27;s, as a homeless model taken under the wing of an agent played by Learned. In those same &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; episodes, Jonathan Ward played Learned&#x27;s son Rick; in the &quot;Living Dolls&quot; series, David Moscow took over the role.

==Reboot/sequel series==

In August 2020, a revival/sequel of the series was announced. It is slated to premiere on Amazon Freevee.

==International versions==
Several versions of &quot;Who&#x27;s the Boss?&quot; have been produced for foreign television markets. Some are dubbed and others are remakes. In many cases the names of the lead characters were changed:
*Aired in India, &quot;Samne wali khidki&quot; starred Archana Puran Singh as Sanjana and Akshay Anand as Rohit. Here, the housekeeper was a struggling actor living as paying guest who has a niece who is the same age as Sanjana&#x27;s son. There is no sexual tension between Rohit and Sanjana, although she is a divorcee and is hit upon by her neighbor, retired Army man Kukreja Bharat Kapoor and various recurring guest stars. 
*Aired in France starting 1987, first on Antenne 2 (now France 2), then on M6. The show was renamed &quot;Madame est servie&quot; (&quot;Dinner is served&quot;, but literally &quot;Madam is served&quot;, referring to Tony being Angela&#x27;s housekeeper). When the entire series aired in Canada on Radio-Canada, only the pilot intro was used (with shots of the van going around the block after leaving Tony&#x27;s apartment, and a shot of Samantha and Tony in the van).
*In Italy, the first two seasons were aired in 1989 on minor network Odeon TV as &quot;Casalingo Superpiù&quot; (&quot;Super Housekeeper&quot;); Katherine Helmond&#x27;s character name was changed from Mona to Moira because in Italian, &quot;mona&quot; means &quot;рuѕsy&quot;.
*In the United Kingdom, &quot;The Upper Hand&quot; aired on ITV from 1990 to 1996 while the original &quot;Who&#x27;s The Boss?&quot; was screened on the individual ITV regional stations. The show starred Joe McGann, Diana Weston, and Honor Blackman in the roles originally played by Tony Danza, Judith Light and Katherine Helmond respectively. In 1993, Helmond herself appeared in an episode of this version as Madame Alexandra.
*Though the show had been broadcast in Germany in a dubbed version as &quot;Wer ist hier der Boss?&quot; (&quot;Who is the Boss Here?&quot;) since 1992 on RTL Television, a year later, the channel produced 15 early episodes with a German cast. The show was called &quot;Ein Job fürs Leben&quot; (&quot;A Life&#x27;s Job&quot;). Tony was renamed Vito, an Italian guest worker from Berlin-Neukölln and former striker of soccer club Hertha BSC. Angela Bower was renamed Barbara Hoffmann. Their home was located in Hamburg&#x27;s upscale suburb Othmarschen. Despite these little changes, the original scripts were used for shooting, and even the stage set was an almost identical replica of the original American set, with only minor details changed, such as paintings and bric-a-brac in German style. RTL Television gave the same treatment to &quot;Married... with Children&quot; under the title &quot;Hilfe, meine Familie spinnt&quot; (&quot;Help! My family is nuts!&quot;) with 26 episodes. The two shows shared the first hour on Thursdays in the prime time slot from 8:15 pm to 10:15 pm.
*A Spanish-language version, produced in Mexico by TV Azteca and Columbia TriStar International Television, debuted in 1998 under the title &quot;Una familia con Ángel&quot; (&quot;A Family with Angel&quot;) starring Laura Luz and Daniel Martínez. It was broadcast in the U.S. on the Telemundo network.
*In Brazil, Rede Bandeirantes produced with Columbia TriStar International Television a Portuguese-language version of the show called &quot;Santo de Casa&quot; (&quot;House Saint&quot;), starring Daniel Boaventura, Regina Remencius and Ana Lúcia Torre. This version debuted in 1999.
*In 2005, the Argentinian network Telefé also made its own local version called &quot;¿Quién es el Jefe?&quot; (&quot;Who is the Boss?&quot;), a direct translation of the original American title. It starred Nicolás Vázquez, Gianella Neyra and Carmen Barbieri in the adult roles.
*In 2006, a Russian remake premiered that was titled &quot;Kto v dome khozyain?&quot; (which translates as &quot;Who is the head in this house?&quot;). It starred Anna Nevskaya (as Daria, the boss) and Andrey Noskov (as Nikita, the housekeeper). It originally aired for three years on CTC and used most of the episodes of the American original and concludes with the wedding of the main characters in the 150th episode.
*In 2006, Colombian network Caracol TV produced &quot;¿Quién manda a quién?&quot; (which was the title of the original show when dubbed in Spanish).
*A Polish version, &quot;I kto tu rządzi?&quot; (&quot;And Who is in Charge Here?&quot;), debuted in 2007 on Polsat, starring Małgorzata Foremniak and Bogusław Linda.
*In Turkey, it is aired as &quot;Patron Kim?&quot; (&quot;Who is the Boss?&quot;) on ATV Turkey.

<text>Operation SUPPORT is the name given to Canadian Forces activities directly after the terrorist attacks of September 11, 2001. The CF had two immediate goals: to provide support for stranded aircrew and passengers from diverted commercial flights, and to increase emergency preparedness. Transport Canada called their operation Yellow Ribbon.

Stranded travellers were received at several CF bases and stations, including Goose Bay, Gander and Stephenville, Newfoundland and Labrador, and Halifax Regional Municipality Airport
in, Shearwater, Nova Scotia and Aldershot, Nova Scotia. Also, CF units in the Atlantic region provided thousands of beds and ration packs; nine CF transport aircraft delivered about 8,800 cots, 8,300 blankets and 55 support personnel to places where commercial flights had been diverted. CF aircraft also transported Canada Customs and Revenue Agency officials to those locations so stranded travellers could clear Customs and enter Canada — many of them to accept the hospitality of the communities in which they found themselves.

Several steps were taken to increase emergency preparedness. Additional CF-18 fighters were assigned to NORAD. The Disaster Assistance Response Team (DART) was placed on stand-by at 8 Wing Trenton, Ontario. Also, HMC Ships &quot;Preserver&quot;, &quot;Iroquois&quot; and &quot;Ville de Québec&quot; were put in a higher state of readiness in case they were required to go to a U.S. port to provide humanitarian assistance.

<doc id="371187" wikidata="Q1814777" url="?curid=371187" title="National Enquirer">
<text>The National Enquirer is an American tabloid newspaper. Founded in 1926, the newspaper has undergone a number of changes over the years. The &quot;National Enquirer&quot; openly acknowledges that it pays sources for tips (checkbook journalism), a common practice in tabloid journalism that results in conflicts of interest. It has also been embroiled in several controversies related to its catch and kill practices and allegations of blackmail. It has struggled with declining circulation figures because of competition from other glossy tabloid publications. 

In May 2014, American Media announced a decision to shift the headquarters of the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; from Florida, where it had been located since 1971, back to New York City, where it originally began as The New York Enquirer in 1926. On April 10, 2019, Chatham Asset Management, which had acquired control of 80 percent of AMI&#x27;s stock, forced AMI to sell the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;. This came after Chatham owner Anthony Melchiorre, whom AMI has also relied on for survival, expressed dismay over the tabloid magazine&#x27;s recent scandals regarding hush money assistance to U.S. president Donald Trump&#x27;s 2016 campaign and blackmail of Jeff Bezos. On April 18, 2019, AMI agreed to sell the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; to Hudson Group. Pending bankruptcy, Chatham would again become the majority shareholder of the paper.

==History==
===1926–1990s===
In 1926, William Griffin, a protégé of William Randolph Hearst, founded the paper as &quot;The New York Evening Enquirer&quot;, a Sunday afternoon broadsheet newspaper distributed throughout New York City, using money lent to Griffin by Hearst. It made its debut on September 19, 1926. As partial payment of his loan, Hearst asked Griffin to use the &quot;Enquirer&quot; as a proving ground for new ideas. Hearst took the ideas that worked in his successful publications; the less successful ideas stayed with the &quot;Enquirer&quot;, and as a result the &quot;Enquirer&quot;s sales never soared. During the 1930s and 1940s, it became a voice for isolationism and pro-fascist propaganda. The paper was indicted along with Griffin under the Smith Act for sedition by a grand jury in 1942 for subverting the morale of US troops through Griffin&#x27;s editorials against US military involvement in World War II. The charges were later dropped.

By 1952, three years after Griffin&#x27;s death, the paper&#x27;s circulation had fallen to 17,000 copies a week; it was then purchased by Generoso Pope Jr., the son of Generoso Pope, the founder of &quot;Il Progresso&quot;, New York&#x27;s Italian language daily newspaper. Pope&#x27;s son Paul alleged that Luciano crime family boss Frank Costello provided Pope the money for the purchase in exchange for the &quot;Enquirer&quot;″s promise to list lottery numbers and to refrain from any mention of Mafia activities.

In 1953, Pope revamped the format from a broadsheet to a sensationalist tabloid. The paper&#x27;s editorial content became so salacious that New York Mayor Robert F. Wagner Jr. forced Pope to resign from the city&#x27;s Board of Higher Education in 1954. In 1957, Pope changed the name of the newspaper to &quot;The National Enquirer&quot; and changed its scope to national stories of sex and scandal. Pope worked tirelessly in the 1950s and 1960s to increase the circulation and broaden the tabloid&#x27;s appeal. In the late 1950s and through most of the 1960s, the publication was known for its gory and unsettling headlines and stories such as: &quot;I Cut Out Her Heart and Stomped on It&quot; (September 8, 1963) and &quot;Mom Boiled Her Baby and Ate Her&quot; (1962). At this time the paper was sold on newsstands and in drugstores only. Pope stated he got the idea for the format and these gory stories from seeing people congregate around auto accidents. By 1966, circulation had risen to one million.

Pope pioneered the practice of selling magazines at supermarket checkouts. To gain access to the supermarkets, Pope completely changed the format of the paper in late 1967 by dropping all the gore and violence to focus on more benign topics like celebrities, the occult and UFOs. In 1971, Pope moved the headquarters from New York to Lantana, Florida. In 1974, &quot;The National Enquirer&quot; began running Bill Hoest&#x27;s &quot;Bumper Snickers&quot;, a cartoon series about cars and drivers, collected by Signet into a paperback reprint two years later. The death of Elvis Presley was the first show business news story that provided the &quot;Enquirer&quot; with ongoing opportunities to investigate offshoots of the breaking story, as luridly documented in the tabloid&#x27;s own in house news sheet &quot;The Post Script&quot;. Items that followed up on Presley&#x27;s death included a color photograph of his body in an open coffin, a description of nine-year-old Lisa Presley&#x27;s shock and grief over the loss of her father and reports of his pharmaceutical drug abuse, autopsy results and malpractice claims against the doctor who had supplied him with the drugs. These reports appeared in nearly every issue of the &quot;Enquirer&quot; for more than two years.

During most of the 1970s and 1980s, &quot;The National Enquirer&quot; sponsored the placement of the largest decorated Christmas tree in the world at its Lantana, Florida headquarters in what became an annual tradition. A tree was shipped in mid-autumn from the Pacific Northwest by rail and off-loaded by crane onto the adjacent base of &quot;The National Enquirer&quot; property. Every night during the Christmas season, thousands of visitors would come to see the tree. This would grow into one of South Florida&#x27;s most celebrated and spectacular events. Although tremendously expensive, this was Pope&#x27;s &quot;Pet Project&quot; and his &quot;Christmas present&quot; to the local community. The tradition ended when he died in 1988. By this time, &quot;The National Enquirer&quot;″s parent company American Media had acquired publications and companies including &quot;Weekly World News&quot;, and Distribution Services, Inc. The surviving owners, including Pope&#x27;s widow, Lois, sold the company to a partnership of Macfadden Publishing and Boston Ventures for $412 million. Soon after, the company bought the publication&#x27;s main competition, &quot;Star&quot; magazine, from Rupert Murdoch. The combined interests were controlled by a newly formed company, American Media Inc (AMI). In 1999, the paper relocated south again, but this time only 15 miles to Boca Raton, Florida.

===2000s===
====Anthrax attack====
In 2001 in Boca Raton, Florida, Bob Stevens—a photo editor at &quot;Sun&quot;, a sister publication under the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;″s parent company, AMI—was exposed to a letter with anthrax spores and was the first person to die as a result of the 2001 anthrax attacks. The entire AMI office complex in Boca Raton was closed, and remained fenced off for two years after the attack; AMI moved its headquarters to another building in Boca Raton.

====John Edwards story====
After the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;, led by editor-in-chief David Perel, investigated John Edwards for 18 months it proved that he was having an affair with Rielle Hunter. The &quot;Enquirer&quot; followed with exclusive after exclusive, including a photo of Hunter pregnant. In August 2008, in an interview with ABC News, former presidential candidate John Edwards finally admitted to having an extramarital affair with Rielle Hunter but denied fathering her child. Edwards had earlier made false denials of the affair which was first reported by the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;. In October 2007, the publication ran a story about the 2006 affair with Hunter, a filmmaker hired by the Edwards political team, although Edwards dismissed the story as &quot;completely untrue, ridiculous&quot; and &quot;false.&quot; In July 2008, the publication ran an article claiming to have caught the former North Carolina Senator visiting Hunter, and their alleged illegitimate child at a hotel in Los Angeles. Fox News interviewed an unnamed security guard who claimed to have witnessed a confrontation between Edwards and the tabloid&#x27;s members of staff. Edwards later finally admitted that he was the father of Hunter&#x27;s child, after the &quot;Enquirer&quot; ran a photo of Edwards with the baby.

In 2010, there was some speculation that the &quot;Enquirer&quot; might receive a Pulitzer Prize for its investigation of Edwards. Donald Trump said that the paper should be &quot;respected&quot; for its investigation, and questioned why it was not given the award. The &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; wrote, &quot;It galls most mainstream newspaper editors that a tawdry tabloid could be considered for their most vaunted prize. It&#x27;s like nominating a porn flick for an Oscar.&quot;

====Sarah Palin story====
The &quot;National Enquirer&quot; claimed to have an exclusive account of the pregnancy of Bristol Palin, the daughter of Sarah Palin, then governor of Alaska and Republican candidate for vice president in the 2008 election:
The title published an allegation that Palin had an affair with her husband&#x27;s business partner, Brad Hanson. Answering John McCain&#x27;s threat of a lawsuit, a spokesman for the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;, in a statement to &quot;The Huffington Post&quot;, declared:

====Murder of Ennis Cosby====
The &quot;Enquirer&quot; offered a $100,000 reward for the arrest and conviction of the person who murdered Ennis Cosby, son of Bill Cosby. The paper received a credible tip, which it passed along to LAPD, which converted the tip into an arrest and conviction. David Perel&#x27;s coverage of the O.J. Simpson case was referred to by &quot;The New York Times&quot; as the &quot;bible of the case.&quot; Perel was editor in chief when the paper&#x27;s investigative unit, formed under him, discovered and published that Jesse Jackson had fathered a love child during his marriage. In the Cosby case, the LA police, at a press conference, credited the &quot;Enquirer&quot; with solving the case, saying: &quot;We have just arrested a suspect for the murder of Ennis Cosby going on information we are very confident about and this is in great part due to help from &quot;The National Enquirer&quot;.&quot; David Perel was again the &quot;Enquirer&quot; editor responsible for offering reward money that led to police solving the murder.

===2010s===
====Ted Cruz and Donald Trump====
The &quot;National Enquirer&quot; enthusiastically endorsed Donald Trump for the 2016 presidential election and published numerous stories promoting his candidacy and denigrating his opponents. During the Republican presidential primaries in March 2016, the title ran a story alleging that &quot;political operatives&quot; were investigating whether candidate Ted Cruz, a U.S. senator from Texas, engaged in extramarital affairs. Cruz denied it and said that Trump had used his connections to persuade the &quot;Enquirer&quot; to publish the story. Trump denied involvement.

The &quot;National Enquirer&quot; ran another story in April 2016, suggesting that Cruz&#x27;s father, Rafael Cruz, knew JFK assassin Lee Harvey Oswald and worked with Oswald in New Orleans a few months before the assassination. Trump publicly discussed this story on May 3, 2016 saying to Brian Kilmeade of Fox News that &quot;His father was with Lee Harvey Oswald prior to Oswald&#x27;s being — you know, shot. I mean the whole thing is ridiculous&quot;. On May 4, 2016 (a few hours after Cruz lost the Indiana primary and withdrew his candidacy) Trump stated that he did not actually believe the story (&quot;Of course I don&#x27;t believe that&quot;) but the &quot;Enquirer&quot; wanted to &quot;let the people read it.&quot; Kilmeade has since expressed regret for not following up on Trump&#x27;s May 3 comment during that interview. On July 22, 2016, Trump again mentioned the magazine in connection with Cruz&#x27;s father, saying &quot;I know nothing about his father. I know nothing about Lee Harvey Oswald. But there was a picture on the front page of the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; that does have credibility.&quot;

====Donald Trump sexual misconduct allegations====

The &quot;National Enquirer&quot; received, and refused to publish a story from Karen McDougal about an alleged affair she had with Trump in 2006 and, in 2016 as his presidential campaign advanced, paid McDougal $150,000 for, among other items, &quot;exclusive life rights to any relationship she has had with a then-married man.&quot; &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; said that the tabloid had paid McDougal hush money and was using the purchase and refusal to publish the story to protect Trump (a technique known as catch and kill), an allegation the publication denied. In February 2018, after a similar situation involving Stormy Daniels (not involving the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;) was confirmed, McDougal confirmed her story to Ronan Farrow for &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, stating that the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; had loosened the terms of the contract after Trump was elected but that she was unsure of how much she could discuss under the terms of the agreement. The publication had also paid $30,000 to an employee at one of Trump&#x27;s hotels who claimed that Trump fathered a child out of wedlock during the 1980s; the payment came in November 2015, before the paper publicly endorsed Trump, and according to reports in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;, the title&#x27;s staff was investigating the story and preparing to publish the employee&#x27;s claims before &quot;National Enquirer&quot; owner David Pecker personally quashed it.

In late 2015, the parent company of the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;, American Media, Inc., paid $30,000 to Dino Sajudin, a doorman at Trump Tower, to obtain the rights to his story in which he alleged Donald Trump had an affair in the 1980s that resulted in the birth of a child. Sajudin in April 2018 identified the woman as Trump&#x27;s former housekeeper. AMI reporters were given the names of the woman and the alleged child, while Sajudin passed a lie detector test when testifying that he had heard the story from others. Shortly after the payment was made, Pecker ordered the reporters to drop the story. In April 2018, AMI chief content officer Dylan Howard denied the story was &quot;spiked&quot; in a so-called &quot;catch and kill&quot; operation, insisting that AMI did not run the story because Sajudin&#x27;s story lacked credibility. CNN obtained a copy of the contract between AMI and Sajudin on August 24, 2018, after AMI had released Sajudin from the contract. CNN published excerpts of the contract, which instructed Sajudin to provide &quot;information regarding Donald Trump&#x27;s illegitimate child&quot;, but did not contain further specifics of Sajudin&#x27;s story.

====Brzezinski, Scarborough, and the Trump administration====
In June 2017, &quot;Morning Joe&quot; hosts Mika Brzezinski and Joe Scarborough stated that senior officials in the Trump administration had tried to blackmail the two of them using the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;. According to them, the tabloid threatened to publish a smear article on the couple unless the two personally called Trump and begged him to have the story spiked. They refused, and the title (which did not have direct contact with Scarborough or Brzezinski) published the story. The Trump administration also denied the story; Scarborough claims he has saved phone correspondence to the contrary.

====Jeff Bezos====
In February 2019, Jeff Bezos alleged that the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; had threatened to publish private messages and photographs belonging to Bezos and his girlfriend, Lauren Sánchez, if Bezos did not stop &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, which he owns, from pursuing journalistic inquiries into how the publication obtained those messages and photographs. Bezos also said that in 2018, the year in which Saudi Arabian officials reportedly murdered &quot;Washington Post&quot; reporter Jamal Khashoggi, the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; had published a glossy magazine, &quot;The New Kingdom&quot;, promoting Saudi Arabia.

===Notable stories and lawsuits===

In 1981, actress Carol Burnett won a judgment against the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; after it claimed she had been seen drunk in public at a restaurant with Henry Kissinger in attendance. The fact that both of her parents suffered from alcoholism made this a particularly sensitive issue to Burnett. The former longtime chief editor Iain Calder in his book &quot;The Untold Story,&quot; asserted that afterwards, while under his leadership, the publication worked hard to check the reliability of its facts and its sources. The &quot;National Enquirer&quot; additionally scooped other media outlets during the O. J. Simpson murder trial: when a distinctive footprint from a Bruno Magli shoe was found at the crime scene, Simpson vehemently denied owning such a shoe. The title, however, published two photos showing Simpson wearing Bruno Magli shoes. David Perel was the editor in charge of the paper&#x27;s Simpson coverage, which was highly lauded by mainstream media.

Controversy over false content arose again for the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; when a 2002 article alleged that male members of the family of kidnapping victim Elizabeth Smart were involved in what the article termed a &quot;gay sex ring.&quot; Subsequently, two reporters from the &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; were fired after it was learned that they had been paid $20,000 for the story, which they had fabricated. The title threatened to sue the &quot;Salt Lake Tribune&quot; for making false and defamatory statements about the publication after an editorial had disclaimed the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s involvement. The salacious details of the Smart story were retracted by the publication, and a rare apology was issued to the Smart family. One of the fired reporters acknowledged that his behavior was unethical, but expressed surprise that the story had been taken seriously, stating, &quot;When I dealt with the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;, I never dreamed that I was accepting money for &#x27;information&#x27;.&quot;

The &quot;National Enquirer&quot; settled a libel lawsuit with the wife of Gary Condit out of court in 2003, and lost a suit brought by actress Kate Hudson in 2006. Also in 2006, the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; was the first newspaper to reveal that O. J. Simpson had written a book, &quot;If I Did It&quot;. The story was immediately denied by Simpson&#x27;s lawyer, but was confirmed by release of the book one month later. In early March 2007, the paper blocked access to its website for British and Irish readers because a story about the actress Cameron Diaz that they had published in 2005 and for which she received an apology had appeared on the site. The apology concerned a story it had run in 2005 entitled &quot;Cameron Caught Cheating&quot; which turned out to be false – an accompanying picture was just an innocent goodbye hug to a friend, not evidence of an affair. Although only 279 British web addresses had looked at the story, it was deemed to have therefore been published in the United Kingdom. British libel laws are more plaintiff-friendly and it is not necessary to prove actual malice for the plaintiff to win.

Also in March 2007, Tucker Chapman, son of Duane &quot;Dog&quot; Chapman, sold a tape to the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; of his father disparaging his black girlfriend with the use of the word &quot;nigger&quot;, for which the tabloid paid Tucker an undisclosed amount. The A&amp;E Network canceled Chapman&#x27;s show, &quot;Dog the Bounty Hunter&quot;, pending an investigation. On February 21, 2008, A&amp;E Network stated they would resume production of &quot;Dog the Bounty Hunter&quot;, and on May 14, 2008, announced it would return to TV on June 25, 2008. On January 19, 2010, the Pulitzer Prize Board announced that the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; is eligible for consideration for the Pulitzer Prize in the categories of Investigative Journalism and National News Reporting. This change is primarily due to the &quot;Enquirer&quot;″s breaking the story of John Edwards&#x27; affair with Rielle Hunter. In February 2012, the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; published a photo of Whitney Houston in an open casket on its front page. The previous week, it had posted an article showing her having collapsed from a cocaine and alcohol binge during her world tour and claiming that she only had five years to live.

===Editorial changes===
In 1999 AMI was bought by a group fronted by publishing executive David J. Pecker. Funding was diverted from the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;, once considered to be the company&#x27;s principal publication, to &quot;Star&quot; magazine. Editor Steve Coz, who guided the paper through the Simpson case, was fired and replaced by David Perel, who had been the Editor in charge of breaking numerous stories on the Simpson coverage.

The &quot;National Enquirer&quot;″s circulation for a time fell below 1 million (from over 6 million at its height). AMI brought in around 20 British journalists in early 2005, headed by editor Paul Field, a former executive at the British tabloid &quot;The Sun&quot;, and relocated the editorial offices to New York for an April 2005 relaunch. The move failed badly and Field and virtually all the British journalists were sacked after a year. The company reappointed David Perel and announced the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; offices would return to Boca Raton, Florida, in May 2006. Circulation numbers then climbed to over 1 million readers again, and according to the Audit Bureau of Circulations reached over 1 million. Perel later moved on to oversee the relaunch of the gossip website Radar Online, and was replaced as editor-in-chief by Tony Frost. In 2014, the publication moved back to New York and Frost was replaced by Dylan Howard. Howard and the National Enquirer parted ways when his contract, which expired March 31, 2020, was not renewed. 

On April 10, 2019, the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; was said to be up for sale and likely to be sold within days. Chatham Asset Management owner Anthony Melchiorre, whose company acquired control of 80 percent of AMI&#x27;s stock, expressed disapproval of the &quot;Enquirer&quot;″s style of journalism. This was confirmed on April 18, 2019, when it was announced that AMI had agreed sell the &quot;National Enquirer&quot;, and also two other AMI tabloid publications &quot;Globe&quot; and &quot;National Examiner&quot;, to Hudson Group.

==Checkbook journalism controversy==
On April 22, 2024, former American Media Inc. head David Pecker acknowledged in court that the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; engaged in the practice of checkbook journalism which involved paying sources for stories, and that he &quot;told the editors that they could not spend more than $10,000&quot; and he had final say over celebrity stories. He also acknowledged that &quot;checkbook journalism&quot; served as part of the editorial philosophy he followed when he ran American Media Inc. Pecker also stated that he believed that &quot;the only thing that is important is the cover of a magazine.&quot;

==Support of Donald Trump==
According to reporting in &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, executives at the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; sent articles and cover images pertaining to Donald Trump or his electoral opponents to Michael Cohen, Trump&#x27;s lawyer, prior to their publication. The &quot;Post&quot; reported that this practice continued since Trump became president of the United States. American Media Inc. denied sharing material prior to publication. Federal prosecutors have subpoenaed American Media Inc. as part of their investigations into Michael Cohen for possible violation of campaign finance laws. According to reporting by the Associated Press, during the 2016 United States presidential election, stories that supported Trump or attacked his rivals bypassed the newspaper&#x27;s standard fact checking process. Trump reportedly suggested stories to David Pecker—sometimes via Hope Hicks and sometimes personally—including a negative story about Republican primary opponent Ben Carson.

While testifying during Trump&#x27;s New York criminal trial in April 2024, Pecker would provide detail on how he offered to deploy the “catch and kill” scheme to support Trump&#x27;s presidential campaign, stating that he offered in 2015 to suppress negative stories about Trump and also flag any efforts which were made by women attempting to sell stories about Trump as well. Specifically, Pecker noted how he and staff at the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; targeted former Trump Tower employee Dino Sajudin, who was trying to sell a story that Trump fathered an illegitimate girl, and sought the name of the maid who Sajudin alleged Trump had the affair with, with a &quot;National Enquirer&quot; editor agreeing to pay $30,000 for the story. The second &quot;catch-and-kill&quot; target would be Karen McDougal, with Pecker stating that &quot;National Enquirer&quot; editor Dylan Howard got word of her allegation in June 2016, and noted how afterwards, he, Howard, and Cohen conspired to get her to accept a payment of $150,000 in exchange for her story.

==Defamatory publications==
The &quot;National Enquirer&quot; issued a formal apology in the September 2017 edition of their magazine for false statements, defaming Judy Sheindlin of the courtroom series &quot;Judge Judy&quot; as having cheated on her husband and suffering from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease along with brain damage. In addition, they apologized to her daughter Nicole Sheindlin for defaming her as having a jail record.

==&quot;Catch and kill&quot;==
On April 22, 2024, David Pecker testified in court: &quot;We used checkbook journalism, and we paid for stories&quot;. He said that the editors under him had discretion to spend about $10,000 on a story and that any budget above that would be subject to his personal approval. When Karen McDougal claimed to have had an affair with President Trump, the newspaper coordinated with the Trump campaign to pay McDougal $150,000 to benefit the campaign, effectively turning the payment into a campaign contribution. The &quot;National Enquirer&quot; publicly admitted to &quot;catch and kill&quot; in this instance. The Federal Election Commission fined the newspaper $187,000. Stormy Daniels has also claimed the title was involved in the &quot;catch and kill&quot; of her affair with Trump as well. The prosecution of Trump&#x27;s former lawyer Michael Cohen has also involved the purported use of &quot;catch and kill&quot; practices by the title.

==Television spin-off==

On August 30, 1999, a television spin-off of the supermarket tabloid was entitled &quot;National Enquirer TV&quot; and was produced by MGM Television. The series was renamed National Enquirer&#x27;s Uncovered in season 2 and was cancelled on July 6, 2001.

==&quot;Enquiring minds want to know&quot; catchphrase==
During the 1980s, the tabloid&#x27;s slogan in radio and TV ads was &quot;Enquiring minds want to know.&quot; The phrase is also used by Willow Rosenberg in the US TV drama series &quot;Buffy the Vampire Slayer&quot;. In the song &quot;Midnight Star&quot; from his album &quot;&quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic in 3-D&quot;, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic uses the phrase during the song&#x27;s outro. In 1987, the publisher of the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; trademarked the phrase, which uses the alternative (and more commonly British) spelling of &quot;inquiring&quot;.

== Documentaries ==
The origin and history of the newspaper and Generoso Pope Jr.&#x27;s life are the main subjects of a 2014 documentary, directed by Ric Burns and called &quot;Enquiring Minds: The Untold Story of the Man Behind the National Enquirer&quot;. A 2019 documentary directed by Mark Landsman, &quot;Scandalous: The True Story of the National Enquirer&quot;, describes the paper&#x27;s coverage of topics such as the O. J. Simpson murder investigation, the role of paparazzi in the death of Princess Diana, and the Donald Trump 2016 presidential campaign.

<text>The Swedish Election Authority () is a government agency responsible for organizing national elections and referendums in Sweden. The agency began its operations on 1 July 2001 when it took over the responsibilities from the Swedish National Tax Board.

Local and regional elections are the responsibility of the respective municipalities and county councils, however these elections always take place concurrently with the national elections for the Riksdag. As the central administrative authority for elections, the Swedish Election Authority has an instrumental role in all public elections in Sweden. The authority is also responsible for elections to Sámi Parliament of Sweden.

<doc id="371196" wikidata="Q2260870" url="?curid=371196" title="Referendums in Sweden">
<text>Since the introduction of parliamentarism in Sweden, six national referendums have been held. Legal provisions for referendums were introduced in 1922, one year after the adoption of universal suffrage. The Constitution of Sweden provides for binding referendums (concerning changes to the constitution), but all referendums held as of 2012 have been non-binding. The latest referendum, on adopting the euro, was held on 14 September 2003.

The Riksdag decides if a referendum is to be held, when it is held, and the wording of the issue on the ballot. Riksdag also interprets the results (sometimes the outcome is not clear cut, e.g. the nuclear power referendum of 1980). Ahead of the 1980, 1994 and 2003 referendums, all the parties with seats in the Riksdag promised to follow the outcome of the vote.

Blank votes (to protest against the proceedings or the way the issue is framed, etc.) are considered valid in Swedish referendums and are tallied.

Since 1980, there have been legal provisions for binding referendums in questions concerning changes to the constitution and the adoption of international treaties that affect constitutional rights and responsibilities. For a binding referendum to happen, one tenth (i.e. 35) of the members of the Riksdag must demand it the first time the change is up for debate in the Riksdag. One third (i.e. 116) of the members must then support the referendum. The referendum then takes place during the next general election. The change to the constitution is rejected if a majority votes it down, and if the number of votes cast against the change number more than half of the votes cast in the general election. If this is not the case, the referendum becomes non-binding and the Riksdag decides whether to follow the outcome or not. Approval of change to the constitution in a referendum of this kind is never binding. As of 2017, no such referendum has been held.

==Referendums==

===Prohibition referendum (1922)===

The first national Swedish referendum, on the prohibition of alcohol, was held on 27 August 1922. The voter turnout was 55.1%, and prohibition was rejected with 51% voting against it. The referendum was held on initiative of the Swedish temperance movements, and although the Riksdag followed the outcome of this non-binding referendum the consumption of alcoholic beverages in Sweden continued to be restricted in other ways (the Bratt System rationing and through the governmental alcohol monopoly Systembolaget among other restrictions). Blank votes were not counted at this time. The outcome was considered an upset victory for those that rejected prohibition as the temperance movements were much more organized and more active in the campaign.

===Driving side referendum (1955)===

The second national Swedish referendum was held on 16 October 1955. The two alternatives were to either switch to driving on the right or keep left hand driving. Voter turnout was 53.2%, and 82.9% of the votes were in favor of keeping left hand driving. Only 15.5% voted for switching to right hand traffic. 1.6% of the votes were blank votes. The Riksdag later decided to introduce right hand traffic contrary to the outcome. A bill to this effect was passed in 1963 and the switch took place on 3 September 1967 (Dagen H). The referendum was not binding and it was not stipulated on the ballot how long left hand driving should be kept.

===Pensions system referendum (1957)===

The third national Swedish referendum, concerning the form of the Swedish pensions system, was held on 13 October 1957. In this non-binding referendum there were three alternatives:
#Employees would have the right to supplement their pension in proportion with earnings whilst working and linked to the 15 years in which they had the highest income. The value of the pension would be guaranteed by the government. Those earning income via other means, such as business owners, would have the right to sign up to voluntary supplementary pensions whose value would also be guaranteed by the government. (Suggestion of the Social Democratic Party, also backed by the Communist Party and the Trade Union Confederation)
#All income earners would have the right to sign up for voluntary pension supplements, whose value would be guaranteed by the government. (Suggestion of the Farmer&#x27;s League)
#All income earners would have the right to sign up for voluntary pension supplements, and changes would be made to legislation to ensure their value is maintained without government involvement. The supplements would be open to collective and individual agreements. (Suggestion of the Rightist Party and the People&#x27;s Party)
72.4% of the eligible voters cast their votes, with alternative 1 garnering the most votes (45.8%), alternative 2 got 15.0% of the votes, and alternative 3 got 35.3% of the votes. 3.9% of the votes were blank. Although alternative 1 did not gain over 50% of the votes, the Social Democratic Party saw the result as a mandate, and implemented alternative 1 in the following years. The split of opinion between the two coalition parties of the Erlander II Cabinet on this issue, where the Farmer&#x27;s League and the Social Democrats backed different alternatives, led to the dissolution of the coalition and a snap election in 1958. The Farmer&#x27;s League and the Social Democrats had different opinions about the outcome: the Social Democrats believed that their alternative had won because it garnered the most votes and the Farmer&#x27;s League believed alternative 1 had been rejected because the other two alternatives had garnered over 50% of the vote.

===Nuclear power referendum (1980)===

The fourth national Swedish referendum, concerning the form of discontinuing the use of nuclear power, was held on 23 March 1980. In this non-binding referendum there were three alternatives:
#Use of nuclear power should be discontinued as economically feasible (backed by the Moderate Party).
#Use of nuclear power should be discontinued as economically feasible, and any significant power plants in Sweden should be owned by the state or municipalities (backed by the Social Democratic Party and the People&#x27;s Party).
#Use of nuclear power should be discontinued in ten years time (backed by the Centre Party, the Left Party - the Communists and Christian Democratic Unity).
There were no alternatives in favor of expanding or retaining the then-current level of use of nuclear power. In spite of this, the Government Chancellery of Sweden writes that alternative 3 was seen as a &quot;no&quot; to nuclear power and alternatives 1 and 2 were seen as &quot;yes&quot; to nuclear power. All parties with seats in the Riksdag promised to follow the outcome of the vote.

The impetus for the referendum was the Three Mile Island accident (28 March 1979) that increased public apprehension of nuclear power. 75.7% of eligible voters cast their votes, with alternative 2 garnering the most votes (39.1%), alternative 3 got 38.7% of the votes, and alternative 1 got 18.9% of the votes. Alternative 1 and 2 were largely similar and the main sticking point for the Moderate Party was that alternative 2 included wording that said that any significant power plants in Sweden should be owned by the state or municipalities. The Moderate Party therefore launched their own alternative, without this text on the ballot. 3.9% of the votes were blank.

Though no time frame for discontinuing the use of nuclear power was given on the ballots of alternative 1 and 2, the results (with a majority in favor of alternatives 1 and 2 that stipulated that this should happen as economically feasible) were interpreted by the Riksdag as that the use of nuclear power should be discontinued at the end of the lifespan of the nuclear reactors, with the last two estimated as expiring in 2010. However, not all nuclear power reactors were shut down by 2010, and that same year the Riksdag approved the building of new reactors to replace old ones. Sweden currently has three operational nuclear power plants, with ten operational nuclear reactors, which produce about 35-40% of the country&#x27;s electricity. At the time of the referendum, six reactors were operational, with another four completed but not operational, and two under construction.

===European Union membership referendum (1994)===

The fifth national referendum, concerning the membership of Sweden in the European Union (EU), was held on 13 November 1994. Voter turnout was 83.3%, and the result was 52.3% in favor of membership and 46.8% against. 0.9% were blank votes. Although non-binding, all parties with seats in the Riksdag promised ahead of time to follow the outcome of the vote. Sweden joined the EU on 1 January 1995 (the government had applied for membership in 1991).

Of the parties with seats in the Riksdag, the Left Party and the Green Party were against membership. The Moderate Party and the Liberal People&#x27;s Party were largely in favor of membership. Although it was a Social Democratic government that initially applied for membership, the Social Democratic Party was split internally on this question and ultimately took no official position, leaving Social Democratic party members to campaign for or against as they saw fit. The Centre Party and the Christian Democrats similarly left the position on the issue up to the members. Two social movements that were not aligned with any party were active during the referendum campaign: &quot;Folkrörelsen Nej till EU&quot; (&quot;The Social Movement No to the EU&quot;) and &quot;Ja till Europa&quot; (&quot;Yes to Europe&quot;) against and for membership, respectively.

===Euro referendum (2003)===

The sixth national referendum, concerning the adoption of the euro currency, was held on 14 September 2003. The voter turnout was 82.6%, and the adoption of the euro was rejected with 55.9% of the votes, with 42.0% voting in favor. There were 2.1% blank votes. Although non-binding, all parties with seats in the Riksdag promised ahead of time to follow the outcome of the vote. As of 2017, Sweden has not adopted the euro, and public opinion against adoption has grown over time.

The Moderate Party, the Liberal People&#x27;s Party and the Christian Democrats were in favor of adopting the euro. The Social Democratic Party was split and one part of the party campaigned for and another against. The Left Party, the Green Party and the Centre Party were against adoption. Sweden in Europe was the umbrella organization for those in favor of adoption. (&quot;The Social Movement No to the EU&quot;), active since before the 1994 referendum on membership in the European Union, was also active against the euro during this referendum.

The murder of Anna Lindh, Social Democratic Minister for Foreign Affairs, on 11 September 2003 led to the suspension of the referendum campaign. After deliberations, the government and the other parties with seats in the Riksdag decided to go ahead with the referendum at the set date, but no further debates or campaigning would take place. The motive behind the murder was not known before the end of the referendum (no one claimed responsibility), but at the time it was assumed that it had been perpetrated to influence the outcome. The perpetrator was apprehended on 16 September, after the vote, and it turned out that the deed had nothing to do with the referendum. According to Statistics Sweden, the official government statistics agency of Sweden, the murder had no effect on the outcome of the referendum. The popularity of Lindh (who had campaigned in favor of adoption) increased after the murder, but this was not reflected in the outcome of the vote to any significant degree.

==Municipal referendums==
Referendums can be held in a municipality about a local political issue. Such referendums are common, and often held in connection with a general election. The municipalities in Sweden have comparatively little legislative power, and can&#x27;t change laws. Local referendums requesting a law change are sometimes held anyway, as political statements to the central government. The most well known Swedish municipal referendum is the 1988 Sjöbo referendum where the voters passed a motion to stop refugees from seeking asylum in the municipality.

<text>Hardwood is wood from angiosperm trees. These are usually found in broad-leaved temperate and tropical forests. In temperate and boreal latitudes they are mostly deciduous, but in tropics and subtropics mostly evergreen. Hardwood (which comes from angiosperm trees) contrasts with softwood (which is from gymnosperm trees).

==Characteristics==

Hardwoods are produced by angiosperm trees that reproduce by flowers, and have broad leaves. Many species are deciduous. Those of temperate regions lose their leaves every autumn as temperatures fall and are dormant in the winter, but those of tropical regions may shed their leaves in response to seasonal or sporadic periods of drought. Hardwood from deciduous species, such as oak, normally shows annual growth rings, but these may be absent in some tropical hardwoods.

Hardwoods have a more complex structure than softwoods and are often much slower growing as a result. The dominant feature separating &quot;hardwoods&quot; from softwoods is the presence of pores, or vessels. The vessels may show considerable variation in size, shape of perforation plates (simple, scalariform, reticulate, foraminate), and structure of cell wall, such as spiral thickenings. Several specific microscopic features are used in the identification process of a hardwood species.

As the name suggests, the wood from these trees is generally harder than that of softwoods, but there are significant exceptions. In both groups there is an enormous variation in actual wood hardness, with the range in density in hardwoods completely including that of softwoods; some hardwoods (&quot;e.g.&quot;, balsa) are softer than most softwoods, while yew is an example of a hard softwood.

==Chemistry==
The structural polymers of hardwoods are cellulose, hemicellulose, and lignin. The constituents of hardwood lignin differs from those included in softwood. Sinapyl alcohol and coniferyl alcohol are the main monomers of hardwood lignin.

Hardwoods contain less amount of non-structural constituents, named extractives, than softwoods. These extractives are usually categorized into three broad groups: aliphatic compounds, terpenes and phenolic compounds. Aliphatic compounds found in hardwoods include fatty acids, fatty alcohols and their esters with glycerol, fatty alcohols (waxes) and sterols (steryl esters), hydrocarbons, such as alkanes, sterols, such as sitosterol, sitostanol and campesterol. The terpene content of the hardwood significantly differs from the softwood, and mainly consists of triterpenoids, polyprenols and other higher terpenes. Triterpenoids commonly purified from hardwoods include cycloartenol, betulin and squalene. Hardwood polyterpenes are rubber, gutta percha, gutta-balatá and betulaprenols. Although in small quantities, hardwoods also contain mono-, sesqui- and diterpenes, such as α- and β-pinenes, 3-carene, β-myrcene, limonene, hinokitiol, δ-cadinene, α- and δ-cadinols, borneol. Hardwood is rich in phenolic compounds, such as stilbenes, lignans, norlignans, tannins, flavonoids.

==Applications==
Hardwoods are employed in a large range of applications, including fuel, tools, construction, boat building, furniture making, musical instruments, flooring, cooking, barrels, and manufacture of charcoal. Solid hardwood joinery tends to be expensive compared to softwood. In the past, tropical hardwoods were easily available, but the supply of some species, such as Burma teak and mahogany, is now becoming scarce due to over-exploitation. Cheaper &quot;hardwood&quot; doors, for instance, now consist of a thin veneer bonded to a core of softwood, plywood or medium-density fibreboard (MDF). Hardwoods may be used in a variety of objects, but are most frequently seen in furniture or musical instruments because of their density which adds to durability, appearance, and performance. Different species of hardwood lend themselves to different end uses or construction processes. This is due to the variety of characteristics apparent in different timbers, including density, grain, pore size, growth and fibre pattern, flexibility and ability to be steam bent. For example, the interlocked grain of elm wood (&quot;Ulmus&quot; spp.) makes it suitable for the making of chair seats where the driving in of legs and other components can cause splitting in other woods.

=== Cooking ===
There is a correlation between density and calories/volume. This makes the denser hardwoods like oak, cherry, and apple more suited for camp fires, cooking fires, and smoking meat, as they tend to burn hotter and longer than softwoods like pine or cedar whose low-density construction and highly-flammable pitch make them burn quickly and without producing quite as much heat.

<text>Newton&#x27;s parakeet (Psittacula exsul), also known as the Rodrigues parakeet or Rodrigues ring-necked parakeet, is an extinct species of parrot that was endemic to the Mascarene island of Rodrigues in the western Indian Ocean. Several of its features diverged from related species, indicating long-term isolation on Rodrigues and subsequent adaptation. The rose-ringed parakeet of the same genus is a close relative and probable ancestor. Newton&#x27;s parakeet may itself have been ancestral to the endemic parakeets of nearby Mauritius and Réunion.

Around long, Newton&#x27;s parakeet was roughly the size of a rose-ringed parakeet. Its plumage was mostly greyish or slate blue in colour, which is unusual in &quot;Psittacula&quot;, a genus containing mostly green species. The male had stronger colours than the female and possessed a reddish instead of black beak, but details of a mature male&#x27;s appearance are uncertain; only one male specimen is known, and it is believed to be immature. Mature males might have possessed red patches on the wing like the related Alexandrine parakeet. Both sexes had a black collar running from the chin to the nape, but this was clearer in the male. The legs were grey and the iris yellow. Some 17th-century accounts indicate that some members of the species were green, which would suggest that both blue and green colour morphs occurred, but no definitive explanation exists for these reports. Little is known about its behaviour in life, but it may have fed on the nuts of the bois d&#x27;olive tree, along with leaves. It was very tame and was able to mimic speech.

Newton&#x27;s parakeet was first written about by the French Huguenot François Leguat in 1708 and was only mentioned a few times by other writers afterwards. The specific name &quot;exsul&quot; is a reference to Leguat, who was exiled from France. Only two life drawings exist, both of a single specimen held in captivity in the 1770s. The species was scientifically described in 1872, with a female specimen as the holotype. A male, the last specimen recorded, was collected in 1875, and these two specimens are the only ones that exist today. The bird became scarce due to deforestation and perhaps hunting, but it was thought to have been finally wiped out by a series of cyclones and storms that hit Rodrigues in the late 19th century. Speculation about the possible survival of the species, though unfounded, lasted as late as 1967.

== Taxonomy ==

Newton&#x27;s parakeet was first recorded by François Leguat in his 1708 memoir &quot;A New Voyage to the East Indies&quot;. Leguat was the leader of a group of nine French Huguenot refugees who colonised Rodrigues between 1691 and 1693 after they were marooned there. Subsequent accounts were by Julien Tafforet, who was marooned on the island in 1726, in his &quot;Relation de l&#x27;Île Rodrigue&quot;, and then by the French mathematician Alexandre Pingré, who travelled to Rodrigues to view the 1761 transit of Venus.

In 1871, George Jenner, the British magistrate of Rodrigues, collected a female specimen; it was preserved in alcohol and given to Edward Newton, a British colonial administrator in Mauritius, who sent it to his brother, the ornithologist Alfred Newton. A. Newton scientifically described the species in 1872 and gave it the scientific name &quot;Palaeornis exsul&quot;. &quot;Exsul&quot; (&quot;exiled&quot;) refers to Leguat, in that he was exiled from France when he gave the first description of the bird. Newton had tried to find a more descriptive name, perhaps based on colouration, but found it difficult. He refrained from publishing a figure of the female in his original description, though the journal &quot;Ibis&quot; had offered him the space. He instead wanted to wait until a male specimen could be procured since he imagined it would be more attractive. The female, which is the holotype specimen of the species, is housed in the Cambridge University Museum as specimen UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/1.

A. Newton requested further specimens, especially males, but in 1875 he finally published a plate of the female, lamenting that no male specimens could be found. Tafforet&#x27;s 1726 account had been rediscovered the previous year, and A. Newton noted that it confirmed his assumption that the male would turn out be much more colourful than the female. Newton&#x27;s collector, the English naturalist Henry H. Slater, had seen a live Newton&#x27;s parakeet the year before, but was not carrying a gun at the time. On 14 August 1875, William Vandorous shot a male specimen. It may have been the same specimen Slater had observed. It was subsequently sent to E. Newton by William J. Caldwell. This is the paratype of the species, numbered UMZC 18/Psi/67/h/2 and housed in the Cambridge Museum.

In 1876, the Newton brothers noted that they had expected the male would be adorned with a red patch on the wing, but that the absence of this indicated it was immature. They still found it more beautiful than the female. These two specimens are the only preserved individuals of the species. The mandible and sternum were extracted from the female specimen, and subfossil remains have since been found in the Plaine Corail caverns on Rodrigues. The American ornithologist James L. Peters used the name &quot;Psittacula exsul&quot; for Newton&#x27;s parakeet in his 1937 checklist of birds, replacing the genus name &quot;Palaeornis&quot; with &quot;Psittacula&quot;, wherein he also classified other extant parakeets of Asia and Africa.

=== Evolution ===

Based on morphological features, the Alexandrine parakeet (&quot;Psittacula eupatria&quot;) has been proposed as the founder population for all &quot;Psittacula&quot; species on Indian Ocean islands, with new populations settling during the species&#x27; southwards colonisation from its native South Asia. Features of that species gradually disappear in species further away from its range. Subfossil remains of Newton&#x27;s parakeet show that it differed from other Mascarene &quot;Psittacula&quot; species in some osteological features, but also had similarities, such as a reduced sternum, which suggests a close relationship. Skeletal features indicate an especially close relationship with the Alexandrine parakeet and the rose-ringed parakeet (&quot;Psittacula krameri&quot;), but the many derived features of Newton&#x27;s parakeet indicates it had long been isolated on Rodrigues.

Many endemic Mascarene birds, including the dodo, are descended from South Asian ancestors, and the British palaeontologist Julian Hume has proposed that this may also be the case for all parrots there. Sea levels were lower during the Pleistocene, so it was possible for species to colonise some of these less isolated islands. Although most extinct parrot species of the Mascarenes are poorly known, subfossil remains show that they shared common features such as enlarged heads and jaws, reduced pectoral bones, and robust leg bones. Hume has suggested that they all have a common origin in the radiation of the tribe Psittaculini, members of which are known as Psittaculines, basing this theory on morphological features and the fact that parrots from that group have managed to colonise many isolated islands in the Indian Ocean. The Psittaculini could have invaded the area several times, as many of the species were so specialised that they may have evolved significantly on hotspot islands before the Mascarenes emerged from the sea. Other members of the genus &quot;Psittacula&quot; from the Mascarenes include the extant echo parakeet (&quot;Psittacula eques echo&quot;) of Mauritius, as well as its extinct Réunion subspecies (&quot;Psittacula eques eques&quot;), and the Mascarene grey parakeet (&quot;Psittacula bensoni&quot;) of both Mauritius and Réunion.

A 2011 genetic study of parrot phylogeny was unable to include Newton&#x27;s parakeet, as no viable DNA could be extracted. A 2015 genetic study by the British geneticist Hazel Jackson and colleagues included viable DNA from the toe-pad of the female Newton&#x27;s parakeet specimen. It was found to group within a clade of rose-ringed parakeet subspecies (from Asia and Africa), which it had diverged from 3.82 million years ago. Furthermore, Newton&#x27;s parakeet appeared to be ancestral to the parakeets of Mauritius and Réunion. The cladogram accompanying the study is shown below:

In 2018, the American ornithologist Kaiya L. Provost and colleagues found the Mascarene parrot (&quot;Mascarinus marscarinus&quot;) and &quot;Tanygnathus&quot; species to group within &quot;Psittacula&quot;, making that genus paraphyletic (an unnatural grouping), and stated this argued for breaking up the latter genus. To solve the issue, the German ornithologist Michael P. Braun and colleagues proposed in 2019 that &quot;Psittacula&quot; should be split into multiple genera. They placed Newton&#x27;s parakeet in the new genus &quot;Alexandrinus&quot;, along with its closest relatives, the echo parakeet and the rose-ringed parakeet.

A 2022 genetic study by the Brazilian ornithologist Alexandre P. Selvatti and colleagues confirmed the earlier studies in regard to the relationship between &quot;Psittacula&quot;, the Mascarene parrot, and &quot;Tanygnathus&quot;. They suggested that Psittaculinae originated in the Australo–Pacific region (then part of the supercontinent Gondwana), and that the ancestral population of the &quot;Psittacula&quot;–&quot;Mascarinus&quot; lineage were the first psittaculines in Africa by the late Miocene (8–5 million years ago), and colonised the Mascarenes from there.

== Description ==
Newton&#x27;s parakeet was about long – roughly the size of the rose-ringed parakeet. The wing of the male specimen was , the tail , the culmen , and the tarsus was . The wing of the female specimen was , the tail , the culmen , and the tarsus was . The male specimen was greyish blue (also described as &quot;slatey blue&quot;) tinged with green, and darker above. The head was bluer, with a dark line running from the eye to the cere. It had a broad black collar running from the chin to the nape, where it became gradually narrower. The underside of the tail was greyish, the upper beak was dark reddish brown, and the mandible was black. The legs were grey and the iris yellow. The female was similar but had a greyer head and a black beak. The black collar was not so prominent as that of the male and did not extend to the back of the neck.

The general appearance of Newton&#x27;s parakeet was similar to the extant &quot;Psittacula&quot; species, including the black collar, but the bluish grey colouration set it apart from other members of its genus, which are mostly green. It differed from its Mascarene relatives in some skeletal details, including in that the internal margin of the mandibular symphysis (where the two halves of the lower jaw connected) was oval instead of square-shaped when seen from above, and in that the upper end of the humerus (upper arm bone) was less expanded than in the Mascarene grey parakeet and the echo parakeet.

===Possible colour variation===
The French naturalist Philibert Commerson received a live specimen on Mauritius in the 1770s and described it as &quot;greyish blue&quot;. French artist Paul Philippe Sanguin de Jossigny made two illustrations of this specimen, the only known depictions of Newton&#x27;s parakeet in life, unpublished until 2007. Though both existing specimens are blue, some early accounts from Rodrigues have caused confusion over the colouration of the plumage. One of these is Leguat&#x27;s following statement:


If the green parrots Leguat referred to were not the Rodrigues parrot (&quot;Necropsittacus rodericanus&quot;), they might perhaps have been a green colour morph of Newton&#x27;s parakeet, as Hume has suggested. As A. Newton observed in his original description, some feathers of the female specimen display both blue and green tinges, depending on the light. This may explain some of the discrepancies. According to Fuller, the green parrots mentioned could also instead have been storm-blown members of &quot;Psittacula&quot; species from other islands, that survived on Rodrigues for a short time.

The two existing specimens were originally preserved in alcohol, but though this can discolour specimens, it is not probable that it could turn green to blue. Hume and the Dutch orhinthologist Hein van Grouw have also suggested that due to an inheritable mutation, some Newton&#x27;s parakeets may have lacked psittacin, a pigment that together with eumelanin produces green colouration in parrot feathers. Complete lack of psittacin produces blue colouration, whereas reduced psittacin can produce a colour between green and blue called parblue, which corresponds to the colour of the two preserved Newton&#x27;s parakeet specimens. The reason why only parblue specimens are known today may be due to collecting bias, as unusually coloured specimens are more likely to be collected than those of normal colour.

Tafforet also described what appears to be green Newton&#x27;s parakeets, but the issue of colouration was further complicated by the mention of red plumage:

In 1987, the British ecologist Anthony S. Cheke proposed that the last two types mentioned were male and female Newton&#x27;s parakeets, and that the differences between them were due to sexual dimorphism. The last bird mentioned had earlier been identified as introduced grey-headed lovebirds (&quot;Agapornis canus&quot;) by A. Newton, but Cheke did not find this likely, as their beaks are grey. Pingré also mentioned green birds, perhaps with some red colours, but his account is partially unintelligible and therefore ambiguous. A red shoulder patch is also present on the related Alexandrine parakeet. None of the existing Newton&#x27;s parakeet specimens have red patches. Fuller suggested the single known male specimen may have been immature, judged on the colour of its beak, and this may also explain the absence of the red patch. When &quot;Psittacula&quot; are bred by aviculturalists, blue is easily produced from green; the production of blue may suppress red colouration, so blue morphs may have lacked the red patch.

== Behaviour and ecology ==

Almost nothing is known about the behaviour of Newton&#x27;s parakeet, but it is probable that it was similar to that of other members of its genus. Leguat mentioned that the parrots of the island ate the nuts of the bois d&#x27;olive tree (&quot;Cassine orientalis&quot;). Tafforet also stated that the parrots ate the seeds of the bois de buis shrub (&quot;Fernelia buxifolia&quot;), which is endangered today, but was common all over Rodrigues and nearby islets during his visit. Newton&#x27;s parakeet may have fed on leaves as the related echo parakeet does. The fact that it survived long after Rodrigues had been heavily deforested shows that its ecology was less vulnerable than that of, for example, the Rodrigues parrot.

Leguat and his men were hesitant to hunt the parrots of Rodrigues because they were so tame and easy to catch. Leguat&#x27;s group took a parrot as a pet and were able to teach it to speak:

The authors of the 2015 study which resolved the phylogenetic placement of the Mascarene island parakeets suggested that the echo parakeet of Mauritius would be a suitable ecological replacement for the Réunion parakeet and Newton&#x27;s parakeet, due to their close evolutionary relationship. The echo parakeet was itself close to extinction in the 1980s, numbering only twenty individuals, but has since recovered, so introducing it to the nearby islands could also help secure the survival of this species.

Many other species endemic to Rodrigues became extinct after humans arrived, and the island&#x27;s ecosystem remains heavily damaged. Forests had covered the entire island before humans arrived, but very little forestation can be seen today. Newton&#x27;s parakeet lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the Rodrigues solitaire, the Rodrigues parrot, the Rodrigues rail, the Rodrigues starling, the Rodrigues scops owl, the Rodrigues night heron, and the Rodrigues pigeon. Extinct reptiles include the domed Rodrigues giant tortoise, the saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise, and the Rodrigues day gecko.

== Extinction ==

Of the roughly eight parrot species endemic to the Mascarenes, only the echo parakeet has survived. The others were likely all made extinct by a combination of excessive hunting and deforestation by humans. Leguat stated that Newton&#x27;s parakeet was abundant during his stay. It was still common when Tafforet visited in 1726, but when Pingré mentioned it in 1761, he noted that the bird had become scarce. It was still present on southern islets off Rodrigues (Isle Gombrani), along with the Rodrigues parrot. After this point, much of Rodrigues was severely deforested and used for livestock.

According to early accounts praising its flavour, it appears visitors commonly ate Newton&#x27;s parakeet. Several individuals would likely be needed to provide a single meal, owing to the bird&#x27;s small size. Pingré stated:

According to government surveyor Thomas Corby, Newton&#x27;s parakeet may still have been fairly common in 1843. Slater reported that he saw a single specimen in southwestern Rodrigues during his three-month stay to observe the 1874 Transit of Venus, and assistant colonial secretary William J. Caldwell saw several specimens in 1875 during his own three-month visit. The male that he received in 1875 and gave to Newton is the last recorded member of the species. A series of cyclones struck the following year and may have devastated the remaining population. Further severe storms hit in 1878 and 1886, and since few forested areas were left by this time, there was little cover to protect any remaining birds. The male could, therefore, have been the last of the species alive.

There were unfounded rumours of its continued existence until the beginning of the 20th century. In 1967, the American ornithologist James Greenway stated that an extremely small population might still survive on small offshore islets, since this is often the last refuge of endangered birds. The Mauritian ornithologist France Staub stated in 1973 that his visits to Rodrigues the previous seven years confirmed the bird was extinct. Hume concluded in 2007 that the islets were probably too small to sustain a population.

<text>A multiple listing service (MLS, also multiple listing system or multiple listings service) is an organization with a suite of services that real estate brokers use to establish contractual offers of cooperation and compensation (among brokers) and accumulate and disseminate information to enable appraisals. A multiple listing service&#x27;s database and software is used by real estate brokers in real estate (or in other industries, for example, aircraft brokers), representing sellers under a listing contract to widely share information about properties with other brokers who may represent potential buyers or wish to work with a seller&#x27;s broker in finding a buyer for the property or asset. The listing data stored in a multiple listing service&#x27;s database is the proprietary information of the broker who has obtained a listing agreement with a property&#x27;s seller.

==Origin==
According to the U.S. National Association of Realtors:
In the late 1800s, real estate brokers regularly gathered at the offices of their local associations to share information about properties they were trying to sell. They agreed to compensate other brokers who helped sell those properties, and the first MLS was born, based on a fundamental principle that&#x27;s unique to organized real estate: Help me sell my inventory and I&#x27;ll help you sell yours.

The term &quot;MLS&quot; is considered generic in the United States and cannot be trademarked or branded. MLSs can be owned and operated by individual realtor associations, regional multi-association conglomerates or independent cooperatives of real estate brokerages. There is no single authoritative MLS. However, there is a data standard for MLS systems. The &quot;Real Estate Standards Organization&quot; provides the Data Dictionary for common real estate terms and data structures, and the RESO Web API for data transport. A previous common data transport standard, RETS, has been deprecated.

==Purpose and benefits==
The primary purpose of an MLS is to provide a facility to publish a &quot;unilateral offer of compensation&quot; by a listing broker, to other broker participants in that MLS. In other words, the commission rate that is offered by the listing broker is published within the MLS to other cooperating brokers. This offer of compensation is considered a contractual obligation; however, it can be negotiated at any time between the listing broker and the broker representing the buyer. Many Realtors feel commission is not negotiable after an offer is received, but the National Association of Realtors states it can be negotiated at any time. Since the commission for a transaction as well as the property features are contained in the MLS system, it is in the best interests of the brokers to maintain accurate and timely data.

The additional benefit of MLS systems is that an MLS subscriber may search an MLS and retrieve information about all homes for sale by all participating brokers. MLS systems contain hundreds of fields of information about the features of a property. These fields are determined by real estate professionals who are knowledgeable and experienced in that local marketplace.

==Limitations on access and other criticisms==
There are currently 529 Multiple Listing Services in the US. They are owned by associations of realtors individually, collectively, or by, in a small number of cases, brokers. They are not freely accessible to anyone and a fee must be paid to be a user. In addition, only licensed real estate agents, and brokers, and appraisers are eligible to belong to an MLS.

In response, the Federal Trade Commission investigated, found several violations of anti-trust laws, and entered into settlements with five MLSes to enable free competition for listings. One MLS, Realcomp in Michigan, refused to enter a settlement/consent agreement with the FTC, asserting it had the right to hide listings of discounters because such competition is detrimental to the revenue of its members. In 2006, the FTC filed a lawsuit against the Realcomp MLS alleging violations of federal anti-trust laws and squelching free competition. The lawsuit went to trial in 2007 and the FTC lost, but won the case in a 4–0 unanimous ruling on appeal in 2009.

In Canada, CREA has come under scrutiny and investigation by the Competition Bureau and litigation by former CREA member and real estate brokerage Realtysellers (Ontario) Ltd., for the organization&#x27;s control over the Canadian MLS system. In 2001, Realtysellers (Ontario) Ltd., a discount real-estate firm was launched that reduced the role of agents and the commissions they collect from home buyers and sellers. The brokerage later shut down and launched a $100 million lawsuit against CREA and TREB, alleging that they breached an earlier out-of-court settlement that the parties entered into in 2003.

==Asia==
===India===
Listings of India specializing in the Multiple Listing Services (MLS) launches a platform in Dec 2015 in India, for the first time, to connect all authorized Real Estate Agents/Brokers/Agency/ Promotes/Builders through one platform; to showcase their property listings for wider exposure among the network.

===Philippines===

The Philippine Association of Real Estate Boards (PAREB) operates the PAREB MLS, an Multi Listing Service (MLS) which provide real time property listing exchange nationwide among PAREB Brokers.

===Vietnam===
The Vietnam Multiple Listing Service was started in 2010. The MLS in Vietnam is based around the U.S. model, with some changes to accommodate different local market conditions. In particular, the system supports open agency listings as well as MLS listings, as the current market operates mainly on the open agency model. FSBO listings, however, are not allowed.

==Australia==
There is no general MLS for Australia; however, a private company Investorist operates a specialised MLS for off the plan property, which is used by some Australian developers and master agents. Investorist is also accessed by international agents.

realestate.com.au Pty. Ltd. operates Property Platform, which allows real-time reservations and eCommerce reservation fee processing.

==Middle East==

===Bahrain===
Bahrain Real Estate Multilevel Listing Solution – mlsBH is a localized and enhanced version of RETS based MLS service but still in its early stage of implementation and integration within the property sector of Bahrain. mlsBH is owned and operated by a private company since 2015 and unlike conventional MLS; is not restricted to dealing with brokers only. Via RealtorBH; a set of FSRBO classes which along with extended broker classes are facilitated to directly submit their exclusive listings, which after verification are centralized in mlsBH. Furthermore it also directly syndicates centralized listings on RealtyBH – a local comparable of US&#x27; Zillow. With the introduction of Bahrain RERA in 2018 operators of mlsBH aligned themselves with the policies of the regulator.

===Israel===
The MLS in Israel has been operating since 1990 only in the Jerusalem . The Israel Multiple Listing Service began in 2013 and is managed by a Multiple Listing Service LTD.

==Europe==

===Czech Republic===
There are not any MLS services in the Czech Republic. With high demand and low surplus of available properties, there is no need for agents to split commission as there is not a lack of buyers.

===Italy===
In Italy there are many MLSs and it is possible to choose between different software enabling real estate agencies either to manage and share their properties with others or to syndicate their listings on the web, or both the two things as it happens on MLS Agent RE and, as of 2021, it had 89,22% of market shares as stated in the &quot;Reti e Aggregazioni Immobiliari 2021&quot; report. Unlike the US model, in agent one there is no obligation for members to include properties in the mls.

Although many countries are lacking regulations regarding real estate transactions, lately there are attempts to align with those in developed markets, among which the only one managed directly by real estate agents is the “confederazione reti Mls”. the confederation brings together a series of mls local networks that adhere to the confederation&#x27;s code of ethics, and differs from other mls networks in Italy for the obligation to pre-qualify properties and the sharing of the entire list of properties. The site of the confederation for customers, who can choose the real estate agent regardless of whether he is the holder of the assignment or not, is immobilimls.

===Cyprus, Turkey, Portugal and Spain===
The UltraIT Multiple Listing Service (MLS) is a “Trade Only” property network of estate agents. Agents subscribed to the MLS have the ability to search this database of property sales and property rentals properties from a growing number of subscribing estate agents, providing each agent the ability to access and search the UltraIT MLS system of ten’s of thousands of properties all over the world, currently including Cyprus, Turkey, Portugal and areas in Spain such as the Costa Blanca, Costa del Sol, Barcelona and Tenerife. All Entrepreneur Real Estate Agents (TUGEM) of Turkey has started MLS based database with its members, mainly international brands that works in Turkey. TUGEM has start working relation with www.cepi.eu/ and www.nar.realtor to amalgamate their resources. Ministry of Land Registry in Turkey has started www.yourkeyturkey.gov.tr web based portal to work with TUGEM and TUGEM GLOBAL to expend their services and their database of all listings and land registry information. TUGEM is planning to launch their full MLS system in Mid- 2021.

===United Kingdom===
In the United Kingdom, MLS – Multiple Listing Systems do exist via some of the agents software providers, but many software providers have only designed their software to work in one company (typically for firms working across a large office footprint). One hurdle to the traditional MLS comes as a result of mixed software packages among agencies that do not allow them to cross share data between other company, so MLS in the United Kingdom is in its infancy and a cross data platform now exists via INEA.

MLS History in the United Kingdom. In the 1980s and early/mid 1990s agents did work together much like the early U.S. and Canadian realtors via paper-based forms which had tick-boxes offering a listing from one agent to sub-agents. Attached would be the property details pre-agreed with the owner for correctness, a photographic negative of photo; later a similar procedure was carried out by email and graphic computer file. Agents involved could copy and process the paper- or email-based property data. The main agent was treated as the vendor; all sales progression went through her and commission was split upon completion.

The Dark Years: In the late 1990s many of the smaller agencies were acquired by larger companies, breaking many of the MLS relationships that existed. More software options came in (all in competition) and, as the software houses did not work together, their collectives of agents became fragmented by non-collaborative out-of-group software restraints. With large property portals gaining ground in the 2000s agents in the UK started working alone as all could upload to the same portal platforms.

MLS Today: In the UK there are a number of seedling MLS systems that attempt to connect agents horizontally. INEA, Lonres and AgentHub.com are examples of sites that serve similar functions to US MLS counterparts, however there are insufficient data to conclude that any of these systems are used popularly across the country.

The future of MLS in the UK: The future of the MLS in the UK is uncertain at the time of writing (2017). With most home buyers beginning property search online via nationwide property portals, it would seem that the requirement for property sharing between agencies is significantly diminished. Large UK property portals vastly improve liquidity in the residential real estate market by connecting buyers with agents in an information-rich environment. In essence, horizontal sharing of inventory between agents – formerly conducted through the MLS – is now replaced by a vertical interaction between estate agents and centralised advertising portals such as Rightmove and Zoopla.

This said, it is not entirely inconceivable that new systems will be introduced to the market that share information horizontally across the market, not only between agents (under a fee sharing arrangement), but with other participants in the transaction such as mortgagors and surveyors. Moreover, UK estate agencies have shown resistance to the inflating fees charged by large property portals. In any case, the future of MLS in the UK will most probably be shaped by changes to competition law, consumer behaviours and the rate of technological advancement.

===Switzerland===
In Switzerland, the adoption of Multiple Listing Systems (MLS) has been growing in recent years, particularly in urban areas such as Zurich, Geneva, and Basel. While the Swiss real estate market is traditionally characterized by exclusive brokerage agreements, several platforms now promote MLS practices to enhance collaboration between real estate agents. Platforms like Properstar, ImmoScout24, and Homegate provide functionalities that allow agents to share property listings, offering buyers and sellers access to a broader range of options. However, the adoption of MLS in Switzerland is still less widespread compared to countries like the United States or Canada due to the fragmented nature of the local real estate market. Despite this, interest in MLS as a tool to improve efficiency and transparency in real estate transactions is steadily increasing.

==Central America==

===Costa Rica===
There are two main real estate organizations in Costa Rica: CRGAR (Costa Rica Global Association of Realtors), and CCCBR (Costa Rican Chamber of Commerce for Real Estate). Of these two associations only CRGAR has an MLS system in place.

CRGAR is associated with the NAR (a US based National Association of Realtors). According to the CRGAR website, as of October 2019 they have just over 120 individual agent members and sponsors.

The actual number of real estate agents in Costa Rica is unknown. Agents are not required under the law to meet any minimal licensing standards nor are they required to join any association in order to become a realtor. Anyone can be an agent without pre-qualification.

A few private real estate companies have set up their own MLS systems, some claiming to be the only official MLS, but these are not directly affiliated with any Costa Rica based real estate associations.

==North America==
In North America, the MLS systems are governed by private entities, and the rules are set by those entities with no state or federal oversight, beyond any individual state rules regarding real estate. MLS systems set their own rules for membership, access, and sharing of information. An MLS may be owned and operated by a real estate company, a county or regional real estate board of realtors or association of realtors, or by a trade association. Membership in the MLS is not required for the practice of real estate brokerage. The most current list of North American MLSs shows over 500 organizations in Canada and the United States.

===Canada===
In Canada, the national MLS is a cooperative system for the members of the Canadian Real Estate Association (CREA), working through Canada&#x27;s 101 real estate boards and 13 provincial/territorial associations. Both the terms Realtor and MLS are registered trademarks for both the members and data of the CREA. The Real Estate Board of Greater Vancouver claims to have pioneered the first MLS in Canada. A publicly accessible website allows consumers to search an aggregated subset of each participating board&#x27;s MLS database of active listings, providing limited details and directing consumers to contact a real estate agent for more information.

While most real estate boards participate in the national MLS, known as the Data Distribution System, others provide listings to a Quebec-based service known as Centris. Still others, such as the Toronto Regional Real Estate Board (TRREB), operate their own MLS.

In 2007, the real estate brokerage Realtysellers shut down after alleging that CREA and TRREB had modified their rules to hinder flat-fee MLS services on behalf of those selling houses themselves. In 2010, CREA settled with the Competition Bureau, and agreed to allow flat-fee listings. However, some real estate boards continued to bar the practice, citing interpretations of provincial laws requiring those trading in real estate to be licensed. Flat-free providers disputed the argument, claiming that their services were no different than posting listings on classifieds, and that they were not necessarily trading. In 2015, the Competition Bureau began a federal case against the TRREB &quot;in hopes of breaking the real estate industry&#x27;s stranglehold on the Multiple Listings Service.&quot;

=== Mexico ===
In Mexico, MLS systems have been slow to catch on, although there have been numerous attempts to create a national network. The first MLS system originated in Puerto Vallarta as www.MLSVallarta.com in 1988 and existed for a short period in the Los Cabos region as MLSCabo.com in the early 90s. They originated in these two markets as the majority of buyers are American or Canadian and familiar with the benefits of a MLS real estate system in their own home markets. MLS systems have not had as much success in other parts of Mexico.
The Cabo system went through a few structural changes before contracting with FLEX MLS software in 2010. Today, it is represents over 90 brokers in the State of Baja California Sur, and is now called MLS BCS (www.mlsinbajasur.com), which operates as a corporation in which each subscriber Broker is permitted to own one voting share. Brokers and agents subscribe through MLS BCS upon meeting requirements and committing to following a strict set of Operating Policies and Procedures, requiring each listing to be Exclusive and the broker to have a complete property records file in his office on each listing. The MLS BCS has been invited to participate on the oversight council of the new Real Estate Agent License Registry, helping to write the Code of Ethics for the 2017 State License law. MLS BCS is generally recognized to be the model for MLS operation in the country.
In Puerto Vallarta and Riviera Nayarit, MLSVallarta.com still services the region as the oldest and longest running MLS system in Mexico. MLSVallarta is a private, independent MLS system, with membership for both qualifying brokers and developers. The Puerto Vallarta and Riviera Nayarit real estate associations formed their own MLS system in 2012, known as www.VallartaNayaritMLS.com, adopting the same FLEX system used in the Los Cabos region. Rules of membership exist for both system in Vallarta systems and only legal existing real estate businesses can apply for membership. Both are well used by local brokers, developers and the buying/selling public.

===United States===
As of 2020, there are 580 MLSs in the US with that number decreasing due to consolidation trends. The largest MLS in the United States is currently California-Regional Multiple Listing Service (CRMLS), representing 110,000 real estate professionals. Other notable MLSs include Bright MLS with over 109,000, Stellar MLS with over 75,000 Subscribers, First MLS in Atlanta with over 50,000 Subscribers, MetroList located in Northern California has over 22,500 Subscribers, Midwest Real Estate Data (MRED) at 40,000 members serving Chicago and northern Illinois, MLS Property Information Network (MLS PIN) at 37,000 subscribers serving Massachusetts and areas of New England and New York, Arizona Regional Multiple Listing Service (ARMLS) in Arizona serving 42,000 members in the Phoenix metropolitan area, and SmartMLS in Connecticut serving over 17,000 members.

====New York City====
Although the other boroughs and Long Island have several different MLS, MLS has never taken hold in Manhattan. A small group of brokers formed the Manhattan Association of Realtors and operate MLSManhattan.com. MLSManhattan has a small fraction of the total active inventory in Manhattan. The Bronx Manhattan North MLS also offers coverage in Northern Manhattan. It too has failed to acquire widespread adoption by brokers.

The prevalent database is operated by the Real Estate Board of New York (REBNY), a non-Realtor entity that seceded from the National Association of Realtors in 1994. REBNY operates a database called RLS which stands for REBNY Listing Service. A predecessor of RLS was marketed as R.O.L.E.X (REBNY Online Listing Exchange), before Rolex Watches claimed trademark infringement.

Like MLS, RLS has under contract, sold and days on market data, and houses rental listings as well. There is a database, which in 2011, was slated to be converted to the more familiar RETS standard in January 2012. The RLS gateway is populated by several private databases that include RealtyMX (RMX), Online Residential (OLR) and Realplus, another proprietary database available to Manhattan Brokers. These databases exchange data continually effectively creating several separate systems with essentially similar data. Another vendor, Klickads, Inc D/B/A Brokers NYC, owned by Lala Wang sued in 2007 to be included in the list of firms permitted to participate in the Gateway. REBNY also grandfathered the major brokerages including Douglas Elliman, Corcoran, Stribling, Bellmarc as participants to the Gateway.

Seriously committed Manhattan brokerages are members of REBNY, and thus one may find the vast majority of updated and valid listings in Manhattan are represented by RLS. The REBNY RLS requires all listings to be entered and disseminated within 24 hours (Until 2007 72 Hours to accommodate agencies without weekend data entry).

====Policies on sharing MLS data in the US====
The National Association of Realtors (NAR) has set policies that permit brokers to show limited MLS information on their websites under a system known as &quot;IDX&quot; or &quot;Internet Data Exchange&quot;. NAR has an ownership interest in Move Inc., the company which operates a website that has been given exclusive rights to display significant MLS information.

Using IDX search tools available on most real estate brokers&#x27; websites (as well as on many individual agents&#x27; sites), potential buyers may view properties available on the market, using search features such as location, type of property (single family, lease, vacant land, duplex), property features (number of bedrooms and bathrooms), and price ranges. In some instances photos can be viewed. Many allow for saving search criteria and for daily email updates of newly-available properties. However, if a potential buyer finds a property, he/she will still need to contact the listing agent (or their own agent) to view the house and make an offer.

The U.S. Department of Justice filed an antitrust lawsuit in September 2005 against the National Association of Realtors over NAR&#x27;s policy which allowed brokers to restrict access to their MLS information from appearing on the websites of certain brokers which operate solely on the web. This policy applied to commercial entities which are also licensed brokerages, such as HomeGain, which solicit clients by internet advertising and then provide referrals to local agents in return for a fee of 25% to 35% of the commission.

The DOJ&#x27;s antitrust claims also include NAR rules that exclude certain kinds of brokers from membership in MLSs. NAR has revised its policies on allowing access on web sites operated by member brokers and others to what might be considered as proprietary data.

The case was settled in May 2008, with NAR agreeing that Internet brokerages would be given access to all the same listings that traditional brokerages are.

<doc id="371213" wikidata="Q528572" url="?curid=371213" title="Rodrigues solitaire">
<text>The Rodrigues solitaire (Pezophaps solitaria) is an extinct flightless bird that was endemic to the island of Rodrigues, east of Madagascar in the Indian Ocean. Genetically within the family of pigeons and doves, it was most closely related to the also extinct dodo of the nearby island Mauritius, the two forming the subfamily Raphinae. The Nicobar pigeon is their closest living genetic relative.

Rodrigues solitaires grew to the size of swans, and demonstrated pronounced sexual dimorphism. Males were much larger than females and measured up to in height and in weight, contrasting with and for females. Its plumage was grey and brown; the female was paler than the male. It had a black band at the base of its slightly hooked beak, and its neck and legs were long. Both sexes were highly territorial, with large bony knobs on their wings that were used in combat. The Rodrigues solitaire laid a single egg that was incubated in turn by both sexes. Gizzard stones helped digest its food, which included fruit and seeds.

First mentioned during the 17th century, the Rodrigues solitaire was described in detail by François Leguat, the leader of a group of French Huguenot refugees who were marooned on Rodrigues in 1691–1693. It was hunted by humans and introduced animals, and was extinct by the late 18th century. Apart from Leguat&#x27;s account and drawing, and a few other contemporary descriptions, nothing was known about the bird until a few subfossil bones were found in a cave in 1786. Thousands of bones have subsequently been excavated. It is the only extinct bird with a former constellation named after it, Turdus Solitarius.

==Taxonomy==
The French explorer François Leguat was the first to refer to the bird as the &quot;solitaire&quot; (referring to its solitary habits), but it has been suggested that he borrowed the name from a 1689 tract by his sponsor Marquis Henri Duquesne, which used the name &quot;solitaire&quot; in reference to the Réunion ibis. The bird was first scientifically named in 1789 as a species of dodo (&quot;Didus solitarius&quot;, based on Leguat&#x27;s description) by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in the thirteenth edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. In 1786, subfossil Rodrigues solitaire bones encrusted in stalagmite were discovered in a cave and sent to the French naturalist Georges Cuvier in about 1830. For unknown reasons, he stated they had recently been found on Mauritius, which caused confusion, until they were compared with other bones from Rodrigues that were found to belong to the same species.

The English naturalists Hugh Edwin Strickland and Alexander Gordon Melville suggested the common descent of the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo in 1848. They dissected the only known dodo specimen with soft tissue, comparing it with the few Rodrigues solitaire remains then available. Strickland stated that, although not identical, these birds shared many distinguishing features in the leg bones otherwise only known in pigeons. The fact that the Rodrigues solitaire laid only one egg, fed on fruits, was monogamous and cared for its nestlings also supported this relationship. Strickland recognised its generic distinction and named the new genus &quot;Pezophaps&quot;, from ancient Greek &#x27; ( &#x27;pedestrian&#x27;) and &#x27; ( &#x27;pigeon&#x27;). The differences between the sexes of the bird were so large that Strickland thought they belonged to two species, naming the smaller female bird &quot;Pezophaps minor&quot;.
Additional subfossils were recovered during the 1860s, but more complete remains were found during the 1874 transit of Venus, since an observation station was located on the island. Many of these excavations were requested by the English ornithologists (and brothers) Alfred and Edward Newton, who used them to describe the osteology of the bird in detail. Thousands of bones were excavated, and mounted skeletons were composed from the remains of several specimens. Study of skeletal features by the Newtons indicated that the solitaire was morphologically intermediate between the dodo and ordinary pigeons, but differed from them in its unique carpal knob.

Some scientists believed that Réunion was home not only to a white dodo, but also to a white bird similar to the Rodrigues solitaire, both of which are now believed to be misinterpretations of old reports of the Réunion ibis. An atypical 17th-century description of a dodo and bones found on Rodrigues, now known to have belonged to the Rodrigues solitaire, led the British taxidermist Abraham Dee Bartlett to name a new species, &quot;Didus nazarenus&quot;; it is now a junior synonym of this species.

At one point it was suggested that the skeleton of this species is the best described after that of humans. In spite of the evidence, some later scholars doubted Leguat&#x27;s story, and the existence of the Rodrigues solitaire. In 1921, the American linguist Geoffroy Atkinson claimed Leguat&#x27;s memoir was merely a novel, and that the man had never even existed, and in 1955, the British ecologist George Evelyn Hutchinson doubted aspects of the bird&#x27;s biology mentioned by Leguat. Today, it is widely accepted that Leguat&#x27;s memoirs are credible observations of the bird in life.

For many years the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire were placed in a family of their own, the Raphidae (formerly Dididae), because their exact relationships with other pigeons were unresolved. Each was also placed in a monotypic family (Raphidae and Pezophapidae, respectively), as it was thought that they had evolved their similarities independently. Osteological and DNA analysis has since led to the dissolution of the family Raphidae, and the dodo and solitaire are now placed in their own subfamily, Raphinae, within the family Columbidae.

===Evolution===
In 2002, American geneticist Beth Shapiro and colleagues analysed the DNA of the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire for the first time. Comparison of mitochondrial cytochrome &quot;b&quot; and 12S rRNA sequences isolated from the femur of a Rodrigues solitaire and the tarsal of a dodo confirmed their close relationship and their placement within the Columbidae. The genetic evidence was interpreted as showing the Southeast Asian Nicobar pigeon (&quot;Caloenas nicobarica&quot;) to be their closest living relative, followed by the crowned pigeons (&quot;Goura&quot;) of New Guinea, and the superficially dodo-like tooth-billed pigeon (&quot;Didunculus strigirostris&quot;) from Samoa. This clade consists of generally ground-dwelling island endemic pigeons. The following cladogram shows the closest relationships of the dodo and the Rodrigues solitaire within Columbidae, based on Shapiro et al., 2002:
A similar cladogram was published in 2007, inverting the placement of &quot;Goura&quot; and &quot;Didunculus&quot; and including the pheasant pigeon (&quot;Otidiphaps nobilis&quot;) and the thick-billed ground pigeon (&quot;Trugon terrestris&quot;) at the base of the clade. Based on behavioural and morphological evidence, Jolyon C. Parish proposed that the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire should be placed in the Gourinae subfamily along with the &quot;Goura&quot; pigeons and others, in agreement with the genetic evidence In 2014, DNA of the only known specimen of the recently extinct spotted green pigeon (&quot;Caloenas maculata&quot;) was analysed, and it was found to be a close relative of the Nicobar pigeon, and thus also the dodo and Rodrigues solitaire.

The 2002 study indicated that the ancestors of the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo diverged around the Paleogene–Neogene boundary. The Mascarene Islands (Mauritius, Réunion, and Rodrigues), are of volcanic origin and are less than 10 million years old. Therefore, the ancestors of both birds probably remained capable of flight for a considerable time after the separation of their lineage. The Nicobar and spotted green pigeon were placed at the base of a lineage leading to the Raphinae, which indicates the flightless raphines had ancestors that were able to fly, were semi-terrestrial, and inhabited islands. This in turn supports the hypothesis that the ancestors of those birds reached the Mascarene islands by island hopping from South Asia. The lack of mammalian herbivores competing for resources on these islands allowed the solitaire and the dodo to attain very large sizes. The dodo lost the ability to fly owing to the lack of mammalian predators on Mauritius. Another large, flightless pigeon, the Viti Levu giant pigeon (&quot;Natunaornis gigoura&quot;), was described in 2001 from subfossil material from Fiji. It was only slightly smaller than the Rodrigues solitaire and the dodo, and it too is thought to have been related to the crowned pigeons.

==Description==

The beak of the Rodrigues solitaire was slightly hooked, and its neck and legs were long. One observer described it as the size of a swan. The skull was long, flattened at the top with the fore and hind parts elevated into two bony ridges structured with cancellous bone. A black band (a contemporary description described it as a &quot;frontlet&quot;) appeared on its head just behind the base of the beak. The plumage of the Rodrigues solitaire was described as grey and brown. Females were paler than males and had elevations on the lower neck.

Sexual size dimorphism in this species is perhaps the greatest in any neognath bird. Males were considerably larger than females, measuring in height and weighing up to , whereas females were and weighed . This is only 60% of the weight of a mature male. Their weight may have varied substantially due to fat cycles, meaning that individuals were fat during cool seasons, but slim during hot seasons, and may have been as low as 21 kg in males and 13 kg in females. Though male pigeons are usually larger than females, there is no direct evidence for the largest specimens actually being the males of the species, and this has only been assumed based on early works. Though the male was probably largest, this can only be confirmed by molecular sexing techniques, and not skeletal morphology alone.

Members of both sexes possessed a large tuberous knob of bone exostosis situated at the base of the carpometacarpus of each wrist. Other wing bones also sometimes show similar structures. The knob was cauliflower-like in appearance, and consisted of up to two or three lobes. The knobs were about half the length of the metacarpus, were larger in males than females, and described as the size of a musket ball. One study measured the largest knob to be in diameter. The knobs vary in size across individuals, and were entirely absent from 58% of specimens examined for the study. These are thought to be immature birds, or birds without territory. The carpometacarpi of males without the knobs were smaller on average than those with it, but there was little difference between the females. In life, the knobs would have been covered by tough cartilaginous or keratinous integument, which would have made them appear even larger. Carpal spurs and knobs are also known from other extant as well as extinct birds. Within Columbidae, the crowned pigeons and the Viti Levu giant pigeon have outgrowths on the carpometacarpus which are similar to those of the female Rodrigues solitaire. Other well known examples are the steamer ducks, the torrent duck, sheathbills, screamers, the spur-winged goose, and the extinct Jamaican ibis, &quot;Xenicibis xympithecus&quot;.

The Rodrigues solitaire shared traits with the dodo, its closest relative, such as size and features in the skull, pelvis, and sternum. It differed in other aspects; it was taller and more slender than the dodo and had a smaller skull and beak, a flatter skull roof, and larger orbits. Its neck and legs were proportionally longer, and the dodo did not possess an equivalent to the carpal knob of the Rodrigues solitaire. Many skeletal features of the Rodrigues solitaire and dodo that are unique among pigeons have evolved to adapt to flightlessness. Their pelvic elements were thicker than those of flighted birds (to support their greater weight), and their pectoral region and wings were paedomorphic (underdeveloped, retaining juvenile features). However, the skull, trunk, and pelvic limbs were peramorphic, which means they changed considerably with maturity.

===Contemporary descriptions===
Apart from Leguat&#x27;s rather simple depiction, the life appearance of the Rodrigues solitaire is only known from a handful of descriptions; no soft-tissue remains survive. Leguat devoted three pages of his memoirs to the Rodrigues solitaire, and was clearly impressed by the bird. He described its appearance as follows:
Several of Leguat&#x27;s observations were later confirmed through study of subfossil Rodrigues solitaire remains. The curved contour lines of the pelvis also support the roundness of its hind parts, which he compared to that of a horse. Also, a ridged surface appears at the base of the beak, indicating the position of the caruncular ridge, which Leguat described as a &quot;widow&#x27;s peak&quot;. Before fossils of the carpal knob were found, Strickland noted that the keel of the sternum of the Rodrigues solitaire was so well-developed as to almost indicate it had possessed the power of flight; however, since the humerus was very short he inferred that this was instead related to Leguat&#x27;s claim that they used their wings for defence.

Leguat continued with an elaborate description of the female Rodrigues solitaire, which also appears to be the sex depicted in his illustration of the bird:

It has been proposed that Leguat&#x27;s comparison between the crop of the female Rodrigues solitaire and the &quot;beautiful bosom of a woman&quot; (changed to &quot;fine neck&quot; in some editions of his memoirs) was out of longing for female companionship.

Leguat&#x27;s statements were confirmed by another description by Julien Tafforet, who wrote in 1726:
==Behaviour and ecology==

Observations of the Rodrigues solitaire in life indicate that they were highly territorial. They presumably settled disputes by striking each other with their wings; to aid this purpose, they used the knobs on their wrists. Fractures in their wing bones also indicate that they were used in combat. It has also been suggested that these fractures may have been the result of a hereditary bone disease rather than battle-injuries. But in all extant birds where carpal spurs and knobs are present, these are used as weapons without exceptions. Though some dodo bones have been found with healed fractures, it had weak pectoral muscles and more reduced wings in comparison with the Rodrigues solitaire. Since Rodrigues receives less rainfall and has more seasonal variation than Mauritius, which would have affected the availability of resources on the island, the Rodrigues solitaire would have more reason to evolve aggressive territorial behaviour. Several accounts state that they also defended themselves with a powerful bite.

In addition to their use as weapons, both sexes of the Rodrigues solitaire also used their wings for communication. The wings could create low-frequency sounds for communicating with mates, or to warn rivals, but it is unknown exactly how this sound was created. The sound could be heard 200 yards (182 m) away, and this may therefore be the size of the territory of an individual. Other species of birds (e.g., club-winged manakin) are also known to use their wings to create sounds that attract mates or mark their territory.

In 1869, the Newton brothers suggested that the carpal knobs may have been formed through continuous injuries, as they resemble diseased bone. It has also been claimed that the carpal knobs were instead formed due to a hereditary disease caused by inbreeding. This was dismissed in a 2013 study, since such lesions would likely not occur only in a specific part of the skeleton, but would appear in any growing bone tissue. If such a disease was due to inbreeding, it would also be present in other isolated island bird populations, but it is not. The authors instead suggested that the wing bones contained metaplastic tissue able to form the knob. This development was either in response to continuous impacts during combat, or to hormones released when individuals paired up and acquired territories. It appears a male which had long held a territory would possess especially large carpal knobs, and that their mates would have such developments as well, only smaller.

Some evidence, including their large size and the fact that tropical and frugivorous birds have slower growth rates, indicates that the Rodrigues solitaire may have had a protracted development period. Based on mass estimates, it has been suggested the male could reach the age of 28, and the female 17. The French economist Pierre-André d&#x27;Héguerty, writing about his time on the island around 1735, stated that a captive Rodrigues solitaire (which he described as having a melancholic appearance) would always walk in the same line until running out of space, and then return. The species may have lived primarily in the island&#x27;s woodlands, rather than on the shores.

Many other of the endemic species of Rodrigues became extinct after the arrival of humans, so the ecosystem of the island is heavily damaged. Before humans arrived, forests covered the island entirely, but very little remains today due to deforestation. The Rodrigues solitaire lived alongside other recently extinct birds such as the Rodrigues rail, the Rodrigues parrot, Newton&#x27;s parakeet, the Rodrigues starling, the Rodrigues scops owl, the Rodrigues night heron, and the Rodrigues pigeon. Extinct reptiles include the domed Rodrigues giant tortoise, the saddle-backed Rodrigues giant tortoise, and the Rodrigues day gecko.

===Diet===

Leguat stated that the Rodrigues solitaire fed on dates, whereas Tafforet mentioned seeds and leaves. No other accounts mention diet. It has been suggested it ate latan palm fruits, for which it competed with the now extinct &quot;Cylindraspis&quot; tortoises. It is not known how the young were fed, but related pigeons provide crop milk. The risings on the crop of the female may have covered glands that produced the crop milk. If the theory is correct, the birds may have practiced a division of labour, where the female stayed and fed the young crop milk, while the male collected food in the crop and delivered it to the female. It has been suggested that the maximum size attained by the solitaire and the dodo was limited by the amount of crop milk they were able to produce for their young during early growth.

Several contemporary accounts state that the Rodrigues solitaire used gizzard stones. Dodos also did this, which may imply a similar diet. Leguat described the stones in the following passage, mentioning that Rodrigues solitaires refused to feed in captivity:

In 1877 three stones were found in a cavern on Rodrigues, each near a Rodrigues solitaire skeleton, and were inferred to be the gizzard stones mentioned by Leguat. One of the stones was examined and found to be dolerite: somewhat rough, hard and heavy, , but hardly flat on one side as described by Leguat. This could be due to its association with a young individual. Although Leguat asserted that the bird hatched with the gizzard stone already inside, in reality adults most likely fed the stones to their hatchlings.

===Reproduction===
The most detailed account of the reproductive habits of the Rodrigues solitaire is Leguat&#x27;s. He described mating and nesting as follows:

The clutch was described as consisting of a single egg; given the bird&#x27;s large size, this led to proposals that the solitaire was K-selected, which means it produced a low number of altricial offspring, which required extensive parental care until maturity. The gathering of unrelated juveniles suggests that they formed crèches, which may have followed foraging adults as part of the learning process. A study of subfossil remains found that the carpal knob only developed after the bird reached skeletal maturity.

Tafforet&#x27;s account confirms Leguat&#x27;s description of reproductive behaviour, adding that Rodrigues solitaires would even attack humans approaching their chicks:

The size difference between sexes has led to the suggestion that the Rodrigues solitaire was not monogamous as stated by Leguat, and that this deeply religious man attributed the trait to the bird for moral reasons. It has been proposed that it was instead polygynous, and the wing-rattling behaviour described for males suggests lek-mating, where males gather for competitive mating display. However, size dimorphism does occur in some monogamous birds; most other pigeons are monogamous as well. A 2015 article proposed that males invited females into their territories as secondary mates, which would result in the resident female acting aggressively towards the newcomer. Similar behaviour is seen in species that practice resource-defence polygyny. The territories probably provided all the food the birds needed in addition to acting as breeding-areas, and there was probably intense competition for favourable territories. The fact that Rodrigues island shrank by 90% at the end of the Pleistocene may also have contributed to such competition over territories, and thereby furthered sexual dimorphism.

==Relationship with humans==

The Dutch viceadmiral Hans Hendricksz Bouwer was the first to list &quot;dodos&quot;, most likely referring to the Rodrigues solitaire, as part of the fauna of Rodrigues in 1601. The English traveller Sir Thomas Herbert mentioned &quot;dodos&quot; on Rodrigues again in 1634, and they were also mentioned in 1700. The next account, which was the first referring to the bird as the &quot;solitaire&quot;, was published in François Leguat&#x27;s 1708 memoir, &quot;A New Voyage to the East Indies&quot;. Leguat was the leader of a group of nine French Huguenot refugees, who were the first to colonise the island from 1691 to 1693, after they were marooned there by their captain. His description of the Rodrigues solitaire and its behaviour is the most detailed account of the bird in life, and he also described other species that are now extinct. Leguat&#x27;s observations are considered some of the first cohesive accounts of animal behaviour in the wild. He later left for Mauritius, but was too late to observe dodos there. 

The Huguenots praised the Rodrigues solitaires for their flavour, especially that of the young, and used their gizzard stones as knife sharpeners. D&#x27;Héguerty later claimed these were also useful in medicine, and referred to them as bezoars. The second most detailed description of the bird was found in an anonymous document rediscovered in 1874 called &quot;Relation de l&#x27;Ile Rodrigue&quot;, which has been attributed to Julien Tafforet, a mariner marooned on Rodrigues in 1726. His observations are considered credible, though it is known he had a copy of Leguat&#x27;s memoirs with him during his stay.
Many old accounts mention that Rodrigues solitaires were hunted by humans. The Danish zoologist Japetus Steenstrup noted that some Rodrigues solitaire remains bore traces of having been broken by a human or perhaps another large predator, to extract bone marrow. Writing in 1735, the French lieutenant Gennes de la Chancelière described the capture and consumption of two specimens as follows:

Unlike the dodo, no Rodrigues solitaires are known to have been sent to Europe alive. However, it has been claimed that the French naval officer Bertrand-François Mahé de La Bourdonnais sent a &quot;solitaire&quot; to France from the nearby island of Réunion around 1740. Since the Réunion solitaire is believed to have become extinct by this date, the bird may actually have been a Rodrigues solitaire.

===Extinction===
The Rodrigues solitaire probably became extinct sometime between the 1730s and 1760s; the exact date is unknown. Its disappearance coincided with the tortoise trade between 1730 and 1750; traders burnt off vegetation, hunted solitaires and imported cats and pigs that preyed on eggs and chicks. In 1755, the French engineer Joseph-François Charpentier de Cossigny attempted to obtain a live specimen, as he had been assured the Rodrigues solitaire still survived in remote areas of the island. Though trying for 18 months, and offering large rewards, none could be found. He noted that cats were blamed for decimating the species, but suspected that it was due to hunting by humans instead. The French astronomer Alexandre Guy Pingré did not encounter any solitaires when he visited Rodrigues to observe the 1761 transit of Venus, although he had been assured they survived. His friend, the French astronomer Pierre Charles Le Monnier named the constellation Turdus Solitarius after the bird to commemorate the journey. Although the Rodrigues solitaire is the only extinct bird to have a former constellation named for it, celestial mapmakers did not know what it looked like and star maps depicted other birds.

By the time the discovery of subfossil Rodrigues solitaire bones from 1786 onwards confirmed Leguat&#x27;s descriptions, no living residents of Rodrigues remembered having seen live specimens. In 1831, a man who had lived on Rodrigues for 40 years said that he had never seen birds large enough to be Rodrigues solitaires. Rodrigues covers only , making it implausible that the bird would have survived undetected.

<text>Yahoo! Babel Fish was a free Web-based machine translation service by Yahoo!. In May 2012 it was replaced by Bing Translator (now Microsoft Translator), to which queries were redirected. Although Yahoo! has transitioned its Babel Fish translation services to Bing Translator, it did not sell its translation application to Microsoft outright. As the oldest free online language translator, the service translated text or Web pages in 36 pairs between 13 languages, including English, Simplified Chinese, Traditional Chinese, Dutch, French, German, Greek, Italian, Japanese, Korean, Portuguese, Russian, and Spanish.

The internet service derived its name from the Babel fish, a fictional species in Douglas Adams&#x27;s book and radio series &quot;The Hitchhiker&#x27;s Guide to the Galaxy&quot; that could instantly translate languages. In turn, the name of the fictional creature refers to the biblical account of the confusion of languages that arose in the city of Babel.

== History ==
On December 9, 1997, Digital Equipment Corporation (DEC) and SYSTRAN S.A. launched AltaVista Translation Service at babelfish.altavista.com, which was developed by a team of researchers at DEC. In February 2003, AltaVista was bought by Overture Services, Inc.
In July 2003, Overture, in turn, was taken over by Yahoo!.

The web address for Babel Fish remained at babelfish.altavista.com until May 9, 2008, when the address changed to babelfish.yahoo.com.

In 2012, the Web address changed again, this time redirecting babelfish.yahoo.com to www.microsofttranslator.com when Microsoft&#x27;s Bing Translator replaced Yahoo Babel Fish.

As of June 2013, babelfish.yahoo.com no longer redirects to the Microsoft Bing Translator. Instead, it refers directly back to the main Yahoo.com page.

<text>In some countries, certain universities have a tradition of pairing their residential colleges or houses with one another. Colleges that are paired are referred to as sister colleges, and have a ceremonial and symbolic relationship to one another. Some notable pairs include Harvard University and Yale University, the University of Oxford, University of Dublin, and the University of Cambridge, and the University of York and Durham University. Students at one college can often find accommodation at their sister college should they be visiting the other University; this is especially relevant to Harvard and Yale students during the annual Game.

== Ireland==
Secondary schools in Ireland which are run by the same religious order are often referred to as &quot;sister colleges&quot; and enjoy a privileged relationship with one another. For example, the Jesuit Belvedere College and Clongowes Wood College are sister colleges, as are the Spiritan Blackrock College and St. Michael&#x27;s College, Dublin.

<text>The calcareous sponges (class Calcarea) are members of the animal phylum Porifera, the cellular sponges. They are characterized by spicules made of calcium carbonate, in the form of high-magnesium calcite or aragonite. While the spicules in most species are triradiate (with three points in a single plane), some species may possess two- or four-pointed spicules. Unlike other sponges, calcareans lack microscleres, tiny spicules which reinforce the flesh. In addition, their spicules develop from the outside-in, mineralizing within a hollow organic sheath.

==Biology==
All sponges in this class are strictly marine, and, while they are distributed worldwide, most are found in shallow tropical waters. Like nearly all other sponges, they are sedentary filter feeders.

All three sponge body plans (asconoid, syconoid, and leuconoid) can be found within the class Calcarea. Typically, calcareous sponges are small, measuring less than in height, and drab in colour. However, a few brightly coloured species are also known.

Like the Homoscleromorpha, calcareous sponges are exclusively viviparous.

Calcareous sponges vary from radially symmetrical vase-shaped body types to colonies made up of a meshwork of thin tubes, or irregular massive forms. The skeleton has either a mesh or honeycomb structure of interlocking spicules. Some extinct species were hypercalcified, meaning that the spicule-based skeleton is cemented together by solid calcite.

==Classification==
Of the approximately 15,000 living species of Porifera, only around 400 are calcareans. Some older studies applied the name Calcispongiae to the class, though &quot;Calcarea&quot; is much more common in modern nomenclature.

Calcarean sponges likely first appeared during the Cambrian Period. The oldest putative calcarean genus is &quot;Gravestockia&quot;, from the &quot;Atdabanian&quot; (Cambrian Stage 3) of Australia. Calcareans are probably descended from &quot;heteractinid&quot; sponges, which first appeared in the early Cambrian. Calcareans reached their greatest diversity during the Cretaceous period.

Some molecular analyses suggest the class Calcarea is not exclusively related to other sponges, and should thus be designated as a phylum. This would also render Porifera (the sponge phylum) paraphyletic. Borchiellini et al. (2001) argued that calcareans were more closely related to Eumetazoa (non-sponge animals) than to other sponges. A few studies have also supported a sister group relationship between calcareans and Ctenophora (comb jellies). Many authors have strongly doubted the hypothesis of sponge paraphyly, arguing that genetic studies have incomplete sampling and are incompatible with the unique anatomical traits shared by living sponges.

Calcarea is divided into two subclasses (Calcinea and Calcaronea) and a number of orders. The two subclasses are mainly distinguished by spicule orientation, soft tissue and developmental traits. For example, calcineans develop from a parenchymella (a larva with a solid center and radial symmetry). Calcaroneans, on the other hand, develop from an amphiblastula (a larva with a hollow center and semi-bilateral symmetry).

<text>In mathematics (differential geometry), a foliation is an equivalence relation on an &quot;n&quot;-manifold, the equivalence classes being connected, injectively immersed submanifolds, all of the same dimension &quot;p&quot;, modeled on the decomposition of the real coordinate space R&quot;n&quot; into the cosets &quot;x&quot; + R&quot;p&quot; of the standardly embedded subspace R&quot;p&quot;. The equivalence classes are called the leaves of the foliation. If the manifold and/or the submanifolds are required to have a piecewise-linear, differentiable (of class &quot;Cr&quot;), or analytic structure then one defines piecewise-linear, differentiable, or analytic foliations, respectively. In the most important case of differentiable foliation of class &quot;Cr&quot; it is usually understood that &quot;r&quot; ≥ 1 (otherwise, &quot;C&quot;0 is a topological foliation). The number &quot;p&quot; (the dimension of the leaves) is called the dimension of the foliation and is called its codimension.

In some papers on general relativity by mathematical physicists, the term foliation (or slicing) is used to describe a situation where the relevant Lorentz manifold (a (&quot;p&quot;+1)-dimensional spacetime) has been decomposed into hypersurfaces of dimension &quot;p&quot;, specified as the level sets of a real-valued smooth function (scalar field) whose gradient is everywhere non-zero; this smooth function is moreover usually assumed to be a time function, meaning that its gradient is everywhere time-like, so that its level-sets are all space-like hypersurfaces. In deference to standard mathematical terminology, these hypersurface are often called the leaves (or sometimes slices) of the foliation. Note that while this situation does constitute a codimension-1 foliation in the standard mathematical sense, examples of this type are actually globally trivial; while the leaves of a (mathematical) codimension-1 foliation are always locally the level sets of a function, they generally cannot be expressed this way globally, as a leaf may pass through a local-trivializing chart infinitely many times, and the holonomy around a leaf may also obstruct the existence of a globally-consistent defining functions for the leaves. For example, while the 3-sphere has a famous codimension-1 foliation discovered by Reeb, a codimension-1 foliation of a closed manifold cannot be given by the level sets of a smooth function, since a smooth function on a closed manifold necessarily has critical points at its maxima and minima.

==Foliated charts and atlases==
In order to give a more precise definition of foliation, it is necessary to define some auxiliary elements.

A &quot;rectangular neighborhood&quot; in R&quot;n&quot; is an open subset of the form &quot;B&quot; = &quot;J&quot;1 × ⋅⋅⋅ × &quot;J&quot;n, where &quot;Ji&quot; is a (possibly unbounded) relatively open interval in the &quot;i&quot;th coordinate axis. If &quot;J&quot;1 is of the form (&quot;a&quot;,0], it is said that &quot;B&quot; has boundary
:formula_1
In the following definition, coordinate charts are considered that have values in R&quot;p&quot; × R&quot;q&quot;, allowing the possibility of manifolds with boundary and (convex) corners.

A &quot;foliated chart&quot; on the &quot;n&quot;-manifold &quot;M&quot; of codimension &quot;q&quot; is a pair (&quot;U&quot;,&quot;φ&quot;), where &quot;U&quot; ⊆ &quot;M&quot; is open and formula_2 is a diffeomorphism, formula_3 being a rectangular neighborhood in R&quot;q&quot; and formula_4 a rectangular neighborhood in R&quot;p&quot;. The set &quot;Py&quot; = &quot;φ&quot;−1(&quot;Bτ&quot; × {&quot;y&quot;}), where formula_5, is called a &quot;plaque&quot; of this foliated chart. For each x ∈ &quot;Bτ&quot;, the set &quot;Sx&quot; = &quot;φ&quot;−1({&quot;x&quot;} × formula_3) is called a &quot;transversal&quot; of the foliated chart. The set &quot;∂τU&quot; = &quot;φ&quot;−1(&quot;Bτ&quot; × (&quot;∂&quot;formula_3)) is called the &quot;tangential boundary&quot; of &quot;U&quot; and formula_8 = &quot;φ&quot;−1((&quot;∂Bτ&quot;) × formula_3) is called the &quot;transverse boundary&quot; of &quot;U&quot;.

The foliated chart is the basic model for all foliations, the plaques being the leaves. The notation &quot;Bτ&quot; is read as &quot;&quot;B&quot;-tangential&quot; and formula_3 as &quot;&quot;B&quot;-transverse&quot;. There are also various possibilities. If both formula_3 and &quot;Bτ&quot; have empty boundary, the foliated chart models codimension-&quot;q&quot; foliations of &quot;n&quot;-manifolds without boundary. If one, but not both of these rectangular neighborhoods has boundary, the foliated chart models the various possibilities for foliations of &quot;n&quot;-manifolds with boundary and without corners. Specifically, if &quot;∂&quot;formula_3 ≠ ∅ = &quot;∂Bτ&quot;, then &quot;∂U&quot; = &quot;∂τU&quot; is a union of plaques and the foliation by plaques is tangent to the boundary. If &quot;∂Bτ&quot; ≠ ∅ = &quot;∂&quot;formula_3, then &quot;∂U&quot; = formula_8 is a union of transversals and the foliation is transverse to the boundary. Finally, if &quot;∂&quot;formula_3 ≠ ∅ ≠ &quot;∂Bτ&quot;, this is a model of a foliated manifold with a corner separating the tangential boundary from the transverse boundary.
A &quot;foliated atlas&quot; of codimension &quot;q&quot; and class &quot;Cr&quot; (0 ≤ &quot;r&quot; ≤ ∞) on the &quot;n&quot;-manifold &quot;M&quot; is a &quot;Cr&quot;-atlas formula_16 of foliated charts of codimension &quot;q&quot; which are &quot;coherently foliated&quot; in the sense that, whenever &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; are plaques in distinct charts of formula_17, then &quot;P&quot; ∩ &quot;Q&quot; is open both in &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot;.

A useful way to reformulate the notion of coherently foliated charts is to write for &quot;w&quot; ∈ &quot;U&quot;α ∩ &quot;U&quot;β 
:formula_18
:formula_19
The notation (&quot;U&quot;α,&quot;φ&quot;α) is often written (&quot;U&quot;α,&quot;x&quot;α,&quot;y&quot;α), with 
:formula_20
:formula_21

On &quot;φ&quot;β(&quot;U&quot;α ∩ &quot;U&quot;β) the coordinates formula can be changed as 
:formula_22

The condition that (&quot;U&quot;&quot;α&quot;,&quot;x&quot;&quot;α&quot;,&quot;y&quot;&quot;α&quot;) and (&quot;U&quot;&quot;β&quot;,&quot;x&quot;&quot;β&quot;,&quot;y&quot;&quot;β&quot;) be coherently foliated means that, if &quot;P&quot; ⊂ &quot;U&quot;&quot;α&quot; is a plaque, the connected components of &quot;P&quot; ∩ &quot;U&quot;&quot;β&quot; lie in (possibly distinct) plaques of &quot;U&quot;&quot;β&quot;. Equivalently, since the plaques of &quot;U&quot;&quot;α&quot; and &quot;U&quot;&quot;β&quot; are level sets of the transverse coordinates &quot;y&quot;&quot;α&quot; and &quot;y&quot;&quot;β&quot;, respectively, each point &quot;z&quot; ∈ &quot;U&quot;&quot;α&quot; ∩ &quot;U&quot;&quot;β&quot; has a neighborhood in which the formula
:formula_23
is independent of &quot;x&quot;&quot;β&quot;.

The main use of foliated atlases is to link their overlapping plaques to form the leaves of a foliation. For this and other purposes, the general definition of foliated atlas above is a bit clumsy. One problem is that a plaque of (&quot;U&quot;α,&quot;φ&quot;α) can meet multiple plaques of (&quot;U&quot;β,&quot;φ&quot;β). It can even happen that a plaque of one chart meets infinitely many plaques of another chart. However, no generality is lost in assuming the situation to be much more regular as shown below.

Two foliated atlases formula_17 and formula_25 on &quot;M&quot; of the same codimension and smoothness class &quot;Cr&quot; are &quot;coherent&quot; formula_26 if formula_27 is a foliated &quot;Cr&quot;-atlas. Coherence of foliated atlases is an equivalence relation.

Plaques and transversals defined above on open sets are also open. But one can speak also of closed plaques and transversals. Namely, if (&quot;U&quot;,&quot;φ&quot;) and (&quot;W&quot;,&quot;ψ&quot;) are foliated charts such that formula_28 (the closure of &quot;U&quot;) is a subset of &quot;W&quot; and &quot;φ&quot; = &quot;ψ&quot;|&quot;U&quot; then, if formula_29 it can be seen that formula_30, written formula_31, carries formula_28 diffeomorphically onto formula_33

A foliated atlas is said to be &quot;regular&quot; if
# for each α ∈ &quot;A&quot;, formula_34 is a compact subset of a foliated chart (&quot;W&quot;α,&quot;ψ&quot;α) and &quot;φ&quot;α = &quot;ψ&quot;α|&quot;U&quot;α;
# the cover {&quot;U&quot;α | α ∈ &quot;A&quot;} is locally finite;
# if (&quot;U&quot;α,&quot;φ&quot;α) and (&quot;U&quot;β,&quot;φ&quot;β) are elements of the foliated atlas, then the interior of each closed plaque &quot;P&quot; ⊂ formula_34 meets at most one plaque in formula_36 

By property (1), the coordinates &quot;x&quot;α and &quot;y&quot;α extend to coordinates formula_37 and formula_38 on formula_34 and one writes formula_40 Property (3) is equivalent to requiring that, if &quot;U&quot;α ∩ &quot;U&quot;β ≠ ∅, the transverse coordinate changes formula_41 be independent of formula_42 That is
:formula_43
has the formula 
:formula_44 
Similar assertions hold also for open charts (without the overlines). The transverse coordinate map &quot;y&quot;α can be viewed as a submersion
:formula_45
and the formulas &quot;y&quot;α = &quot;y&quot;α(&quot;y&quot;β) can be viewed as diffeomorphisms
:formula_46
These satisfy the cocycle conditions. That is, on &quot;y&quot;δ(&quot;U&quot;α ∩ &quot;U&quot;β ∩ &quot;U&quot;δ),
:formula_47
and, in particular,
:formula_48
:formula_49
Using the above definitions for coherence and regularity it can be proven that every foliated atlas has a coherent refinement that is regular.

==Foliation definitions==
Several alternative definitions of foliation exist depending on the way through which the foliation is achieved. The most common way to achieve a foliation is through decomposition reaching to the following

Definition. A &quot;p&quot;-dimensional, class &quot;Cr&quot; foliation of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold &quot;M&quot; is a decomposition of &quot;M&quot; into a union of disjoint connected submanifolds {&quot;L&quot;α}α∈&quot;A&quot;, called the &quot;leaves&quot; of the foliation, with the following property: Every point in &quot;M&quot; has a neighborhood &quot;U&quot; and a system of local, class &quot;Cr&quot; coordinates &quot;x&quot;=(&quot;x&quot;1, ⋅⋅⋅, &quot;xn&quot;) : &quot;U&quot;→R&quot;n&quot; such that for each leaf &quot;L&quot;α, the components of &quot;U&quot; ∩ &quot;L&quot;α are described by the equations &quot;x&quot;&quot;p&quot;+1=constant, ⋅⋅⋅, &quot;xn&quot;=constant. A foliation is denoted by formula_50={&quot;L&quot;α}α∈&quot;A&quot;.

The notion of leaves allows for an intuitive way of thinking about a foliation. For a slightly more geometrical definition, a -dimensional foliation formula_50 of an -manifold may be thought of as simply a collection of pairwise-disjoint, connected, immersed -dimensional submanifolds (the leaves of the foliation) of , such that for every point in , there is a chart formula_52 with homeomorphic to containing such that every leaf, , meets in either the empty set or a countable collection of subspaces whose images under formula_53 in formula_54 are -dimensional affine subspaces whose first coordinates are constant.

Locally, every foliation is a submersion allowing the following

Definition. Let &quot;M&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; be manifolds of dimension &quot;n&quot; and &quot;q&quot;≤&quot;n&quot; respectively, and let &quot;f&quot; : &quot;M&quot;→&quot;Q&quot; be a submersion, that is, suppose that the rank of the function differential (the Jacobian) is &quot;q&quot;. It follows from the Implicit Function Theorem that &quot;ƒ&quot; induces a codimension-&quot;q&quot; foliation on &quot;M&quot; where the leaves are defined to be the components of &quot;f&quot;−1(&quot;x&quot;) for &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;Q&quot;.

This definition describes a dimension- foliation formula_50 of an -dimensional manifold that is a covered by charts together with maps

:formula_56

such that for overlapping pairs the transition functions defined by

:formula_57

take the form

:formula_58

where denotes the first = coordinates, and denotes the last co-ordinates. That is,

:formula_59
The splitting of the transition functions &quot;φij&quot; into formula_60 and formula_61 as a part of the submersion is completely analogous to the splitting of formula_62 into formula_63 and formula_64 as a part of the definition of a regular foliated atlas. This makes possible another definition of foliations in terms of regular foliated atlases. To this end, one has to prove first that every regular foliated atlas of codimension &quot;q&quot; is associated 
to a unique foliation formula_50 of codimension &quot;q&quot;.
As shown in the proof, the leaves of the foliation are equivalence classes of plaque chains of length ≤ &quot;p&quot; which are also topologically immersed Hausdorff -dimensional submanifolds. Next, it is shown that the equivalence relation of plaques on a leaf is expressed in equivalence of coherent foliated atlases in respect to their association with a foliation. More specifically, if formula_17 and formula_25 are foliated atlases on &quot;M&quot; and if formula_17 is associated to a foliation formula_50 then formula_17 and formula_25 are coherent if and only if formula_25 is also associated to formula_50.
It is now obvious that the correspondence between foliations on &quot;M&quot; and their associated foliated atlases induces a one-to-one correspondence between the set of foliations on &quot;M&quot; and the set of coherence classes of foliated atlases or, in other words, a foliation formula_50 of codimension &quot;q&quot; and class &quot;Cr&quot; on &quot;M&quot; is a coherence class of foliated atlases of codimension &quot;q&quot; and class &quot;Cr&quot; on &quot;M&quot;. By Zorn&#x27;s lemma, it is obvious that every coherence class of foliated atlases contains a unique maximal foliated atlas. Thus,

Definition. A foliation of codimension &quot;q&quot; and class &quot;Cr&quot; on &quot;M&quot; is a maximal foliated &quot;Cr&quot;-atlas of codimension &quot;q&quot; on &quot;M&quot;.

In practice, a relatively small foliated atlas is generally used to represent a foliation. Usually, it is also required this atlas to be regular.

In the chart , the stripes match up with the stripes on other charts . These submanifolds piece together from chart to chart to form maximal connected injectively immersed submanifolds called the leaves of the foliation.

If one shrinks the chart it can be written as , where , 
is homeomorphic to the plaques, and the points of parametrize the plaques in . If one picks in , then is a submanifold of that intersects every plaque exactly once. This is called a local &quot;transversal&quot; &quot;section&quot; of the foliation. Note that due to monodromy global transversal sections of the foliation might not exist.

The case &quot;r&quot; = 0 is rather special. Those &quot;C&quot;0 foliations that arise in practice are usually &quot;smooth-leaved&quot;. More precisely, they are of class &quot;C&quot;&quot;r&quot;,0, in the following sense.

Definition. A foliation formula_50 is of class &quot;Cr,k&quot;, &quot;r&quot; &gt; &quot;k&quot; ≥ 0, if the corresponding coherence class of foliated atlases contains a regular foliated atlas {&quot;U&quot;α,&quot;x&quot;α,&quot;y&quot;α}α∈&quot;A&quot; such that the change of coordinate formula
:formula_76
is of class &quot;Ck&quot;, but &quot;x&quot;α is of class &quot;Cr&quot; in the coordinates &quot;x&quot;β and its mixed &quot;x&quot;β partials of orders ≤ &quot;r&quot; are &quot;Ck&quot; in the coordinates (&quot;x&quot;β,&quot;y&quot;β).

The above definition suggests the more general concept of a &quot;foliated space&quot; or &quot;abstract lamination&quot;. One relaxes the condition that the transversals be open, relatively compact subsets of R&quot;q&quot;, allowing the transverse coordinates &quot;y&quot;α to take their values in some more general topological space &quot;Z&quot;. The plaques are still open, relatively compact subsets of R&quot;p&quot;, the change of transverse coordinate formula &quot;y&quot;α(&quot;y&quot;β) is continuous and &quot;x&quot;&quot;α&quot;(&quot;x&quot;&quot;β&quot;,&quot;y&quot;&quot;β&quot;) is of class &quot;Cr&quot; in the coordinates &quot;x&quot;&quot;β&quot; and its mixed &quot;x&quot;&quot;β&quot; partials of orders ≤ &quot;r&quot; are continuous in the coordinates (&quot;x&quot;&quot;β&quot;,&quot;y&quot;&quot;β&quot;). One usually requires &quot;M&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; to be locally compact, second countable and metrizable. This may seem like a rather wild generalization, but there are contexts in which it is useful.

==Holonomy==
Let (&quot;M&quot;, formula_50) be a foliated manifold. If &quot;L&quot; is a leaf of formula_50 and &quot;s&quot; is a path in &quot;L&quot;, one is interested in the behavior of the foliation in a neighborhood of &quot;s&quot; in &quot;M&quot;. Intuitively, an inhabitant of the leaf walks along the path &quot;s&quot;, keeping an eye on all of the nearby leaves. As they (hereafter denoted by &quot;s&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)) proceed, some of these leaves may &quot;peel away&quot;, getting out of visual range, others may suddenly come into range and approach &quot;L&quot; asymptotically, others may follow along in a more or less parallel fashion or wind around &quot;L&quot; laterally, &quot;etc&quot;. If &quot;s&quot; is a loop, then &quot;s&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) repeatedly returns to the same point &quot;s&quot;(&quot;t&quot;0) as &quot;t&quot; goes to infinity and each time more and more leaves may have spiraled into view or out of view, &quot;etc&quot;. This behavior, when appropriately formalized, is called the &quot;holonomy&quot; of the foliation.

Holonomy is implemented on foliated manifolds in various specific ways: the total holonomy group of foliated bundles, the holonomy pseudogroup of general foliated manifolds, the germinal holonomy groupoid of general foliated manifolds, the germinal holonomy group of a leaf, and the infinitesimal holonomy group of a leaf.

===Foliated bundles===
The easiest case of holonomy to understand is the &quot;total holonomy&quot; of a foliated bundle. This is a generalization of the notion of a &quot;Poincaré map&quot;.

The term &quot;first return (recurrence) map&quot; comes from the theory of dynamical systems. Let Φ&quot;t&quot; be a nonsingular &quot;Cr&quot; flow (&quot;r&quot; ≥ 1) on the compact &quot;n&quot;-manifold &quot;M&quot;. In applications, one can imagine that &quot;M&quot; is a cyclotron or some closed loop with fluid flow. If &quot;M&quot; has a boundary, the flow is assumed to be tangent to the boundary. The flow generates a 1-dimensional foliation formula_50. If one remembers the positive direction of flow, but otherwise forgets the parametrization (shape of trajectory, velocity, &quot;etc&quot;.), the underlying foliation formula_50 is said to be oriented. Suppose that the flow admits a global cross section &quot;N&quot;. That is, &quot;N&quot; is a compact, properly embedded, &quot;Cr&quot; submanifold of &quot;M&quot; of dimension &quot;n&quot; – 1, the foliation formula_50 is transverse to &quot;N&quot;, and every flow line meets &quot;N&quot;. Because the dimensions of &quot;N&quot; and of the leaves are complementary, the transversality condition is that
:formula_82

Let &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;N&quot; and consider the &quot;ω&quot;-limit set ω(&quot;y&quot;) of all accumulation points in &quot;M&quot; of all sequences formula_83, where &quot;tk&quot; goes to infinity. It can be shown that ω(y) is compact, nonempty, and a union of flow lines. If formula_84 there is a value &quot;t&quot;* ∈ R such that Φ&quot;t&quot;*(&quot;z&quot;) ∈ &quot;N&quot; and it follows that
:formula_85
Since &quot;N&quot; is compact and formula_50 is transverse to &quot;N&quot;, it follows that the set {&quot;t&quot; &gt; 0 | Φ&quot;t&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) ∈ N} is a monotonically increasing sequence formula_87 that diverges to infinity.

As &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;N&quot; varies, let &quot;τ&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) = &quot;τ&quot;1(&quot;y&quot;), defining in this way a positive function &quot;τ&quot; ∈ &quot;Cr&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) (the first return time) such that, for arbitrary &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;N&quot;, Φ&quot;t&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) ∉ &quot;N&quot;, 0 &lt; &quot;t&quot; &lt; &quot;τ&quot;(&quot;y&quot;), and Φ&quot;τ&quot;(&quot;y&quot;)(&quot;y&quot;) ∈ &quot;N&quot;.

Define &quot;f&quot; : &quot;N&quot; → &quot;N&quot; by the formula &quot;f&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) = Φ&quot;τ&quot;(&quot;y&quot;)(&quot;y&quot;). This is a &quot;C&quot;&quot;r&quot; map. If the flow is reversed, exactly the same construction provides the inverse &quot;f&quot;−1; so &quot;f&quot; ∈ Diff&quot;r&quot;(&quot;N&quot;). This diffeomorphism is the first return map and τ is called the &quot;first return time&quot;. While the first return time depends on the parametrization of the flow, it should be evident that &quot;f&quot; depends only on the oriented foliation formula_50. It is possible to reparametrize the flow Φ&quot;t&quot;, keeping it nonsingular, of class &quot;Cr&quot;, and not reversing its direction, so that &quot;τ&quot; ≡ 1.

The assumption that there is a cross section N to the flow is very restrictive, implying that &quot;M&quot; is the total space of a fiber bundle over &quot;S&quot;1. Indeed, on R × &quot;N&quot;, define ~&quot;f&quot; to be the equivalence relation generated by 
:formula_89
Equivalently, this is the orbit equivalence for the action of the additive group Z on R × &quot;N&quot; defined by
:formula_90
for each &quot;k&quot; ∈ Z and for each (&quot;t&quot;,&quot;y&quot;) ∈ R × &quot;N&quot;. The mapping cylinder of &quot;f&quot; is defined to be the &quot;C&quot;&quot;r&quot; manifold
:formula_91
By the definition of the first return map &quot;f&quot; and the assumption that the first return time is τ ≡ 1, it is immediate that the map
:formula_92
defined by the flow, induces a canonical &quot;C&quot;&quot;r&quot; diffeomorphism 
:formula_93
If we make the identification &quot;M&quot;&quot;f&quot; = &quot;M&quot;, then the projection of R × &quot;N&quot; onto R induces a &quot;C&quot;&quot;r&quot; map
:formula_94
that makes &quot;M&quot; into the total space of a fiber bundle over the circle. This is just the projection of &quot;S&quot;1 × &quot;D&quot;2 onto &quot;S&quot;1. The foliation formula_50 is transverse to the fibers of this bundle and the bundle projection , restricted to each leaf &quot;L&quot;, is a covering map : &quot;L&quot; → &quot;S&quot;1. This is called a &quot;foliated bundle&quot;.

Take as basepoint &quot;x&quot;0 ∈ &quot;S&quot;1 the equivalence class 0 + Z; so π−1(&quot;x&quot;0) is the original cross section &quot;N&quot;. For each loop &quot;s&quot; on &quot;S&quot;1, based at &quot;x&quot;0, the homotopy class [&quot;s&quot;] ∈ π1(&quot;S&quot;1,&quot;x&quot;0) is uniquely characterized by deg &quot;s&quot; ∈ Z. The loop &quot;s&quot; lifts to a path in each flow line and it should be clear that the lift &quot;sy&quot; that starts at &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;N&quot; ends at &quot;fk&quot;(&quot;y&quot;) ∈ &quot;N&quot;, where &quot;k&quot; = deg &quot;s&quot;. The diffeomorphism &quot;fk&quot; ∈ Diff&quot;r&quot;(&quot;N&quot;) is also denoted by &quot;hs&quot; and is called the &quot;total holonomy&quot; of the loop &quot;s&quot;. Since this depends only on [&quot;s&quot;], this is a definition of a homomorphism
:formula_96
called the &quot;total holonomy homomorphism&quot; for the foliated bundle.

Using fiber bundles in a more direct manner, let (&quot;M&quot;,formula_50) be a foliated &quot;n&quot;-manifold of codimension &quot;q&quot;. Let : &quot;M&quot; → &quot;B&quot; be a fiber bundle with &quot;q&quot;-dimensional fiber &quot;F&quot; and connected base space &quot;B&quot;. Assume that all of these structures are of class &quot;Cr&quot;, 0 ≤ &quot;r&quot; ≤ ∞, with the condition that, if &quot;r&quot; = 0, &quot;B&quot; supports a &quot;C&quot;1 structure. Since every maximal &quot;C&quot;1 atlas on &quot;B&quot; contains a &quot;C&quot;∞ subatlas, no generality is lost in assuming that &quot;B&quot; is as smooth as desired. Finally, for each &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;B&quot;, assume that there is a connected, open neighborhood &quot;U&quot; ⊆ &quot;B&quot; of &quot;x&quot; and a local trivialization
:formula_98
where &quot;φ&quot; is a &quot;Cr&quot; diffeomorphism (a homeomorphism, if &quot;r&quot; = 0) that carries formula_99 to the product foliation {&quot;U&quot; × {&quot;y&quot;}}&quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;F&quot;. Here, formula_99 is the foliation with leaves the connected components of &quot;L&quot; ∩ π−1(&quot;U&quot;), where &quot;L&quot; ranges over the leaves of formula_50. This is the general definition of the term &quot;foliated bundle&quot; (&quot;M&quot;,formula_50,π) of class &quot;Cr&quot;.

formula_50 is transverse to the fibers of π (it is said that formula_50 is transverse to the fibration) and that the restriction of π to each leaf &quot;L&quot; of formula_50 is a covering map π : &quot;L&quot; → &quot;B&quot;. In particular, each fiber &quot;Fx&quot; = −1(&quot;x&quot;) meets every leaf of formula_50. The fiber is a cross section of formula_50 in complete analogy with the notion of a cross section of a flow.

The foliation formula_50 being transverse to the fibers does not, of itself, guarantee that the leaves are covering spaces of &quot;B&quot;. A simple version of the problem is a foliation of R2, transverse to the fibration
:formula_109
:formula_110
but with infinitely many leaves missing the &quot;y&quot;-axis. In the respective figure, it is intended that the &quot;arrowed&quot; leaves, and all above them, are asymptotic to the axis &quot;x&quot; = 0. One calls such a foliation incomplete relative to the fibration, meaning that some of the leaves &quot;run off to infinity&quot; as the parameter &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;B&quot; approaches some &quot;x&quot;0 ∈ &quot;B&quot;. More precisely, there may be a leaf &quot;L&quot; and a continuous path &quot;s&quot; : [0,&quot;a&quot;) → &quot;L&quot; such that lim&quot;t&quot;→&quot;a&quot;−π(&quot;s&quot;(&quot;t&quot;)) = &quot;x&quot;0 ∈ &quot;B&quot;, but lim&quot;t&quot;→&quot;a&quot;−&quot;s&quot;(&quot;t&quot;) does not exist in the manifold topology of &quot;L&quot;. This is analogous to the case of incomplete flows, where some flow lines &quot;go to infinity&quot; in finite time. Although such a leaf &quot;L&quot; may elsewhere meet π−1(&quot;x&quot;0), it cannot evenly cover a neighborhood of &quot;x&quot;0, hence cannot be a covering space of &quot;B&quot; under . When &quot;F&quot; is compact, however, it is true that transversality of formula_50 to the fibration does guarantee completeness, hence that formula_112 is a foliated bundle.

There is an atlas formula_17 = {&quot;U&quot;α,&quot;x&quot;α}α∈A on &quot;B&quot;, consisting of open, connected coordinate charts, together with trivializations &quot;φ&quot;&quot;α&quot; : &quot;π&quot;−1(&quot;U&quot;&quot;α&quot;) → &quot;U&quot;&quot;α&quot; × &quot;F&quot; that carry formula_50|π−1(&quot;U&quot;&quot;α&quot;) to the product foliation. Set &quot;W&quot;&quot;α&quot; = &quot;π&quot;−1(&quot;U&quot;&quot;α&quot;) and write &quot;φ&quot;&quot;α&quot; = (&quot;x&quot;&quot;α&quot;,&quot;y&quot;&quot;α&quot;) where (by abuse of notation) &quot;x&quot;α represents &quot;x&quot;&quot;α&quot; ∘ &quot;π&quot; and &quot;y&quot;&quot;α&quot; : &quot;π&quot;−1(&quot;U&quot;α) → &quot;F&quot; is the submersion obtained by composing &quot;φ&quot;α with the canonical projection &quot;U&quot;α × &quot;F&quot; → &quot;F&quot;.

The atlas formula_115 = {&quot;W&quot;&quot;α&quot;,&quot;x&quot;&quot;α&quot;,&quot;y&quot;&quot;α&quot;}&quot;α&quot;∈&quot;A&quot; plays a role analogous to that of a foliated atlas. The plaques of &quot;W&quot;&quot;α&quot; are the level sets of &quot;y&quot;&quot;α&quot; and this family of plaques is identical to &quot;F&quot; via &quot;y&quot;&quot;α&quot;. Since &quot;B&quot; is assumed to support a &quot;C&quot;∞ structure, according to the Whitehead theorem one can fix a Riemannian metric on &quot;B&quot; and choose the atlas formula_17 to be geodesically convex. Thus, &quot;U&quot;α ∩ &quot;U&quot;&quot;β&quot; is always connected. If this intersection is nonempty, each plaque of &quot;W&quot;&quot;α&quot; meets exactly one plaque of &quot;W&quot;&quot;β&quot;. Then define a &quot;holonomy cocycle&quot; formula_117 by setting
:formula_118

== Examples ==

=== Flat space ===
Consider an -dimensional space, foliated as a product by subspaces consisting of points whose first coordinates are constant. This can be covered with a single chart. The statement is essentially that with the leaves or plaques being enumerated by . The analogy is seen directly in three dimensions, by taking and : the 2-dimensional leaves of a book are enumerated by a (1-dimensional) page number.

=== Bundles ===
A rather trivial example of foliations are products , foliated by the leaves . (Another foliation of is given by .)

A more general class are flat -bundles with for a manifold . Given a representation , the flat -bundle with monodromy is given by formula_119, where acts on the universal cover formula_120 by deck transformations and on by means of the representation .

Flat bundles fit into the framework of fiber bundles. A map between manifolds is a fiber bundle if there is a manifold F such that each has an open neighborhood such that there is a homeomorphism formula_121 with formula_122, with projection to the first factor. The fiber bundle yields a foliation by fibers formula_123. Its space of leaves L is homeomorphic to , in particular L is a Hausdorff manifold.

=== Coverings ===
If is a covering map between manifolds, and is a foliation on , then it pulls back to a foliation on . More generally, if the map is merely a branched covering, where the branch locus is transverse to the foliation, then the foliation can be pulled back.

===Submersions===
If is a submersion of manifolds, it follows from the inverse function theorem that the connected components of the fibers of the submersion define a codimension foliation of . Fiber bundles are an example of this type.

An example of a submersion, which is not a fiber bundle, is given by

:formula_124

This submersion yields a foliation of which is invariant under the -actions given by 
: formula_125
for and . The induced foliations of are called the 2-dimensional Reeb foliation (of the annulus) resp. the 2-dimensional nonorientable Reeb foliation (of the Möbius band). Their leaf spaces are not Hausdorff.

=== Reeb foliations ===
Define a submersion

:formula_126

where are cylindrical coordinates on the -dimensional disk . This submersion yields a foliation of which is invariant under the -actions given by

: formula_127

for . The induced foliation of is called the -dimensional Reeb foliation. Its leaf space is not Hausdorff.

For , this gives a foliation of the solid torus which can be used to define the Reeb foliation of the 3-sphere by gluing two solid tori along their boundary. Foliations of odd-dimensional spheres are also explicitly known.

=== Lie groups ===
If is a Lie group, and is a Lie subgroup, then is foliated by cosets of . When is closed in , the quotient space / is a smooth (Hausdorff) manifold turning into a fiber bundle with fiber and base /. This fiber bundle is actually principal, with structure group .

===Lie group actions===
Let be a Lie group acting smoothly on a manifold . If the action is a locally free action or free action, then the orbits of define a foliation of .

===Linear and Kronecker foliations===
If formula_128 is a nonsingular (&quot;i.e.&quot;, nowhere zero) vector field, then the local flow defined by formula_128 patches together to define a foliation of dimension 1. Indeed, given an arbitrary point &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;M&quot;, the fact that formula_128 is nonsingular allows one to find a coordinate neighborhood (&quot;U&quot;,&quot;x&quot;1...,&quot;xn&quot;) about &quot;x&quot; such that
:formula_131
and
:formula_132
Geometrically, the flow lines of formula_133 are just the level sets
:formula_134
where all formula_135 Since by convention manifolds are second countable, leaf anomalies like the &quot;long line&quot; are precluded by the second countability of &quot;M&quot; itself. The difficulty can be sidestepped by requiring that formula_128 be a complete field (&quot;e.g.&quot;, that &quot;M&quot; be compact), hence that each leaf be a flow line.
An important class of 1-dimensional foliations on the torus &quot;T&quot;2 are derived from projecting constant vector fields on &quot;T&quot;2. A constant vector field
:formula_137
on R2 is invariant by all translations in R2, hence passes to a well-defined vector field &quot;X&quot; when projected on the torus . It is assumed that &quot;a&quot; ≠ 0. The foliation formula_138 on R2 produced by formula_128 has as leaves the parallel straight lines of slope θ = &quot;b&quot;/&quot;a&quot;. This foliation is also invariant under translations and passes to the foliation formula_50 on &quot;T&quot;2 produced by &quot;X&quot;.

Each leaf of formula_138 is of the form
:formula_142
If the slope is rational then all leaves are closed curves homeomorphic to the circle. In this case, one can take &quot;a&quot;,&quot;b&quot; ∈ Z. For fixed &quot;t&quot; ∈ R, the points of formula_143 corresponding to values of &quot;t&quot; ∈ &quot;t&quot;0 + Z all project to the same point of &quot;T&quot;2; so the corresponding leaf &quot;L&quot; of formula_50 is an embedded circle in &quot;T&quot;2. Since &quot;L&quot; is arbitrary, formula_50 is a foliation of &quot;T&quot;2 by circles. It follows rather easily that this foliation is actually a fiber bundle π : &quot;T&quot;2 → &quot;S&quot;1. This is known as a &quot;linear foliation&quot;.

When the slope θ = &quot;b&quot;/&quot;a&quot; is irrational, the leaves are noncompact, homeomorphic to the non-compactified real line, and dense in the torus (cf Irrational rotation). The trajectory of each point (&quot;x&quot;0,&quot;y&quot;0) never returns to the same point, but generates an &quot;everywhere dense&quot; winding about the torus, i.e. approaches arbitrarily close to any given point. Thus the closure to the trajectory is the entire two-dimensional torus. This case is named &quot;Kronecker foliation&quot;, after Leopold Kronecker and his

Kronecker&#x27;s Density Theorem. If the real number θ is distinct from each rational multiple of π, then the set {&quot;einθ&quot; | &quot;n&quot; ∈ Z} is dense in the unit circle.
A similar construction using a foliation of by parallel lines yields a 1-dimensional foliation of the -torus associated with the linear flow on the torus.

=== Suspension foliations ===
A flat bundle has not only its foliation by fibres but also a foliation transverse to the fibers, whose leaves are 
: formula_146
where formula_147 is the canonical projection. This foliation is called the suspension of the representation .

In particular, if and formula_148 is a homeomorphism of , then the suspension foliation of formula_53 is defined to be the suspension foliation of the representation given by . Its space of leaves is , where whenever for some .

The simplest example of foliation by suspension is a manifold &quot;X&quot; of dimension &quot;q&quot;. Let &quot;f&quot; : &quot;X&quot; → &quot;X&quot; be a bijection. One defines the suspension &quot;M&quot; = &quot;S&quot;1 ×&quot;f&quot; &quot;X&quot; as the quotient of [0,1] × &quot;X&quot; by the equivalence relation (1,&quot;x&quot;) ~ (0,&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;)).
:&quot;M&quot; = &quot;S&quot;1 ×&quot;f&quot; &quot;X&quot; = [0,1] × &quot;X&quot;
Then automatically &quot;M&quot; carries two foliations: formula_502 consisting of sets of the form &quot;F&quot;2,&quot;t&quot; = {(&quot;t&quot;,&quot;x&quot;)~ : &quot;x&quot; ∈ &quot;X&quot;} and formula_501 consisting of sets of the form &quot;F&quot;2,&quot;x&quot;0 = {(&quot;t&quot;,&quot;x&quot;) : &quot;t&quot; ∈ [0,1] ,&quot;x&quot; ∈ Ox0}, where the orbit Ox0 is defined as
:O&quot;x&quot;0 = {..., &quot;f&quot;−2(&quot;x&quot;0), &quot;f&quot;−1(&quot;x&quot;0), &quot;x&quot;0, &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;0), &quot;f&quot;2(&quot;x&quot;0), ...},
where the exponent refers to the number of times the function &quot;f&quot; is composed with itself. Note that O&quot;x&quot;0 = O&quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;0) = O&quot;f&quot;−2(&quot;x&quot;0), etc., so the same is true for &quot;F&quot;1,&quot;x&quot;0. Understanding the foliation formula_501 is equivalent to understanding the dynamics of the map &quot;f&quot;. If the manifold &quot;X&quot; is already foliated, one can use the construction to increase the codimension of the foliation, as long as &quot;f&quot; maps leaves to leaves.

The Kronecker foliations of the 2-torus are the suspension foliations of the rotations by angle 

More specifically, if Σ = Σ2 is the two-holed torus with C1,C2 ∈ Σ the two embedded circles let formula_50 be the product foliation of the 3-manifold &quot;M&quot; = Σ × &quot;S&quot;1 with leaves Σ × {&quot;y&quot;}, &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot;1. Note that &quot;Ni&quot; = &quot;Ci&quot; × &quot;S&quot;1 is an embedded torus and that formula_50 is transverse to &quot;Ni&quot;, &quot;i&quot; = 1,2. Let Diff+(&quot;S&quot;1) denote the group of orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of &quot;S&quot;1 and choose &quot;f&quot;1,&quot;f&quot;2 ∈ Diff+(&quot;S&quot;1). Cut &quot;M&quot; apart along &quot;N&quot;1 and &quot;N&quot;2, letting formula_155 and formula_156 denote the resulting copies of &quot;Ni&quot;, &quot;i&quot; = 1,2. At this point one has a manifold &quot;M&quot;&#x27; = Σ&#x27; × &quot;S&quot;1 with four boundary components formula_157 The foliation formula_50 has passed to a foliation formula_159 transverse to the boundary ∂&quot;M&#x27; &quot;, each leaf of which is of the form Σ&#x27; × {&quot;y&quot;}, &quot;y&quot; ∈ &quot;S&quot;1.

This leaf meets ∂&quot;M&#x27; &quot; in four circles formula_160 If &quot;z&quot; ∈ &quot;Ci&quot;, the corresponding points in formula_161 are denoted by &quot;z&quot;± and formula_156 is &quot;reglued&quot; to formula_155 by the identification 
:formula_164
Since &quot;f&quot;1 and &quot;f&quot;2 are orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms of &quot;S&quot;1, they are isotopic to the identity and the manifold obtained by this regluing operation is homeomorphic to &quot;M&quot;. The leaves of formula_159, however, reassemble to produce a new foliation formula_50(&quot;f&quot;1,&quot;f&quot;2) of &quot;M&quot;. If a leaf &quot;L&quot; of formula_50(&quot;f&quot;1,&quot;f&quot;2) contains a piece Σ&#x27; × {&quot;y&quot;0}, then
:formula_168
where &quot;G&quot; ⊂ Diff+(&quot;S&quot;1) is the subgroup generated by {&quot;f&quot;1,&quot;f&quot;2}. These copies of Σ&#x27; are attached to one another by identifications
:(&quot;z&quot;−,&quot;g&quot;(&quot;y&quot;0)) ≡ (&quot;z&quot;+,&quot;f&quot;1(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;y&quot;0))) for each &quot;z&quot; ∈ &quot;C&quot;1,
:(&quot;z&quot;−,&quot;g&quot;(&quot;y&quot;0)) ≡ (&quot;z&quot;+,&quot;f&quot;2(&quot;g&quot;(&quot;y&quot;0))) for each &quot;z&quot; ∈ &quot;C&quot;2,
where &quot;g&quot; ranges over &quot;G&quot;. The leaf is completely determined by the &quot;G&quot;-orbit of &quot;y&quot;0 ∈ &quot;S&quot;1 and can he simple or immensely complicated. For instance, a leaf will be compact precisely if the corresponding &quot;G&quot;-orbit is finite. As an extreme example, if &quot;G&quot; is trivial (&quot;f&quot;1 = &quot;f&quot;2 = idS1), then formula_50(&quot;f&quot;1,&quot;f&quot;2) = formula_50. If an orbit is dense in &quot;S&quot;1, the corresponding leaf is dense in &quot;M&quot;. As an example, if &quot;f&quot;1 and &quot;f&quot;2 are rotations through rationally independent multiples of 2π, every leaf will be dense. In other examples, some leaf &quot;L&quot; has closure formula_171 that meets each factor {&quot;w&quot;} × &quot;S&quot;1 in a Cantor set. Similar constructions can be made on Σ × &quot;I&quot;, where &quot;I&quot; is a compact, nondegenerate interval. Here one takes &quot;f&quot;1,&quot;f&quot;2 ∈ Diff+(&quot;I&quot;) and, since ∂&quot;I&quot; is fixed pointwise by all orientation-preserving diffeomorphisms, one gets a foliation having the two components of ∂&quot;M&quot; as leaves. When one forms &quot;M&#x27; &quot; in this case, one gets a foliated manifold with corners. In either case, this construction is called the &quot;suspension&quot; of a pair of diffeomorphisms and is a fertile source of interesting examples of codimension-one foliations.

==Foliations and integrability==
There is a close relationship, assuming everything is smooth, with vector fields: given a vector field on that is never zero, its integral curves will give a 1-dimensional foliation. (i.e. a codimension foliation).

This observation generalises to the Frobenius theorem, saying that the necessary and sufficient conditions for a distribution (i.e. an dimensional subbundle of the tangent bundle of a manifold) to be tangent to the leaves of a foliation, is that the set of vector fields tangent to the distribution are closed under Lie bracket. One can also phrase this differently, as a question of reduction of the structure group of the tangent bundle from to a reducible subgroup.

The conditions in the Frobenius theorem appear as integrability conditions; and the assertion is that if those are fulfilled the reduction can take place because local transition functions with the required block structure exist. For example, in the codimension 1 case, we can define the tangent bundle of the foliation as , for some (non-canonical) (i.e. a non-zero co-vector field). A given is integrable iff everywhere.

There is a global foliation theory, because topological constraints exist. For example, in the surface case, an everywhere non-zero vector field can exist on an orientable compact surface only for the torus. This is a consequence of the Poincaré–Hopf index theorem, which shows the Euler characteristic will have to be 0. There are many deep connections with contact topology, which is the &quot;opposite&quot; concept, requiring that the integrability condition is &quot;never&quot; satisfied.

==Existence of foliations==
 gave a necessary and sufficient condition for a distribution on a connected non-compact manifold to be homotopic to an integrable distribution. showed that any compact manifold with a distribution has a foliation of the same dimension.

<doc id="371231" wikidata="Q13389" url="?curid=371231" title="Bashkir language">
<text>Bashkir ( , ) or Bashkort (, ) is a Turkic language belonging to the Kipchak branch. It is co-official with Russian in Bashkortostan. It is spoken by around 1,100,000 native speakers in Russia, as well as in Belarus, Kazakhstan, Uzbekistan and other neighboring post-Soviet states, and among the Bashkir diaspora. It has three dialect groups: Southern, Eastern and Northwestern.

==Speakers==

Speakers of Bashkir mostly live in the republic of Bashkortostan (a republic within the Russian Federation). Many speakers also live in Tatarstan, Chelyabinsk, Orenburg, Tyumen, Sverdlovsk and Kurgan Oblasts and other regions of Russia. Minor Bashkir groups also live in Kazakhstan and the United States.

In a recent local media report in Bashkortostan, it was reported that some officials of the republic cannot assemble a document in Bashkir language.

==Classification==
Bashkir together with Tatar belongs to the Kipchak-Bulgar () subgroup of the Kipchak languages. These languages have a similar vocabulary by 94.9%, and they not only have common origin, but also a common ancestor in the written language — Volga Turki.
However, Bashkir differs from Tatar in several important ways:
* Bashkir has dental fricatives and in the place of Turkic , , and . For example, Turkish dost and Bashkir дуҫ (duŧ), Turkish adım and Bashkir аҙым (ađım), Turkish usta and Bashkir оҫта (oŧta), or Turkish uzun and Bashkir оҙон (ođon). Bashkir and , however, cannot begin a word (there are exceptions: ҙур – &quot;đur&quot; &#x27;big&#x27;, and the particle/conjunction ҙа – &quot;đa&quot; or ҙә – &quot;đä&quot; . The only other Turkic language with a similar feature is Turkmen. However, in Bashkir, and are two independent phonemes, distinct from and , whereas in Turkmen [θ] and [ð] are the two main realizations of the common Turkic and . In other words, there are no and phonemes in Turkmen, unlike Bashkir which has both and and and .
* The word-initial and morpheme-initial is turned into . An example of both features can be Tatar сүз &quot;(süz)&quot; and Bashkir һүҙ &quot;(hüđ)&quot;, both meaning &quot;word&quot;.
* Common Turkic (Tatar ) is turned into Bashkir , e.g., Turkish &quot;ağaç&quot; , Tatar агач &quot;ağaç&quot; and Bashkir ағас – &quot;ağas&quot; , all meaning &quot;tree&quot;.
* The word-initial in Tatar always corresponds to in Standard Bashkir, e.g., Tatar җылы &quot;cılı&quot; and Bashkir йылы – &quot;yılı&quot; , both meaning &quot;warm&quot;. However, the eastern and northern dialects of Bashkir have the &gt; /~/ shift.

The Bashkir orthography is more explicit. and are written with their own letters Ҡ ҡ and Ғ ғ, whereas in Tatar they are treated as positional allophones of and , written К к and Г г.

Labial vowel harmony in Bashkir is written explicitly, e.g. Tatar тормышым &quot;tormışım&quot; and Bashkir тормошом – &quot;tormoşom&quot;, both pronounced , meaning &quot;my life&quot;.

==Sample text==
==Orthography==

After the adoption of Islam, which began in the 10th century and lasted for several centuries, the Bashkirs began to use Turki as a written language. Turki was written in a variant of the Arabic script.

In 1923, a writing system based on the Arabic script was specifically created for the Bashkir language. At the same time, the Bashkir literary language was created, moving away from the older written Turkic influences. At first, it used a modified Arabic alphabet. In 1930 it was replaced with the Unified Turkic Latin Alphabet, which was in turn replaced with an adapted Cyrillic alphabet in 1939.

The modern alphabet used by Bashkir is based on the Russian alphabet, with the addition of the following letters: Ә ә , Ө ө , Ү ү , Ғ ғ , Ҡ ҡ , Ң ң , Ҙ ҙ , Ҫ ҫ , Һ һ .

==Phonology==
===Vowels===
Bashkir has nine native vowels, and three or four loaned vowels (mainly in Russian loanwords).

Phonetically, the native vowels are approximately thus (with the Cyrillic letter followed by the usual Latin romanization in angle brackets):

In Russian loans there are also , , and , written the same as the native vowels: ы, е/э, о, а respectively.

====Historical shifts====
Historically, the Proto-Turkic mid vowels have raised from mid to high, whereas the Proto-Turkic high vowels have become the Bashkir reduced mid series. (The same shifts have also happened in Tatar.) However, in most dialects of Bashkir, this shift is not as prominent as in Tatar. 
===Consonants===

;Notes
: The phonemes , , are found only in loanwords, and, in the case of , in a few native onomatopoeic words.
: is an intervocal allophone of , and it is distinct from . is an allophone of in back vowel contexts. and occur as allophones of and before , and both occur only in front vowel contexts.
* are dental , and is apical alveolar . The exact place of articulation of the other dental/alveolar consonants is unclear.

==Grammar==
A member of the Turkic language family, Bashkir is an agglutinative, SOV language. A large part of the Bashkir vocabulary has Turkic roots; and there are many loan words in Bashkir from Russian, Arabic and Persian sources.

===Plurality===
The form of the plural suffix is heavily dependent on the letter which comes immediately before it. When it&#x27;s a consonant, there is a four-way distinction between &quot;л&quot; (l), &quot;т&quot; (t), &quot;ҙ&quot; (ź) and &quot;д&quot; (d); The vowel&#x27;s distinction is two-way between &quot;а&quot; (after back vowels &quot;а&quot; (a), &quot;ы&quot; (ı), &quot;о&quot; (o), &quot;у&quot; (u)) and &quot;ә&quot; (after front vowels &quot;ә&quot; (ə), &quot;е&quot; (e), &quot;и&quot; (i), &quot;ө&quot; (ö), &quot;ү&quot; (ü)). Some nouns are also less likely to be used with their plural forms such as &quot;һыу&quot; (hıw, &quot;water&quot;) or &quot;ҡом&quot; (qom, &quot;sand&quot;).

<text>Don Carlos Buell (March 23, 1818November 19, 1898) was a United States Army officer who fought in the Seminole War, the Mexican–American War, and the American Civil War. Buell led Union armies in two major Civil War battles—Shiloh and Perryville. The nation was angered at his failure to defeat the outnumbered Confederate Army after Perryville, or to secure East Tennessee. Historians generally concur that he was a brave and industrious master of logistics, but was too cautious and rigid to meet the challenges presented in 1862. Buell was relieved of field command in late 1862 and made no more significant military contributions before his resignation in 1864.

==Early life and education==
Don Carlos Buell was born in Lowell, Ohio, the eldest of nine children born to Salmon and Elizabeth Buell. He was a first cousin of George P. Buell, also a Union general. Buell&#x27;s father died when he was 8 years old, and his uncle took him in and raised him. As a child, Buell had a difficult time making friends due to his distant, introverted personality and was often made fun of by other children. After winning a fight with a neighborhood bully, he became awakened to the idea that discipline and determination could overcome any obstacle. Buell&#x27;s uncle sent him to a Presbyterian school which stressed duty, self-discipline, patriotism, and belief in a Supreme Being.

George Buell obtained for his nephew an appointment to West Point, but despite his high intelligence and good math skills, he accumulated numerous demerits and disciplinary problems and graduated in 1841 32nd in his class of 52. After graduation, Buell was commissioned a second lieutenant in the 3rd U.S. Infantry regiment and sent to fight in the Seminole Wars in Florida but did not see any combat. After the 3rd Infantry was transferred to Illinois, Buell found himself court-martialed for getting into an argument with an enlisted man and beating him over the head with the blunt end of his sword. However, an Army tribunal cleared him of any wrongdoing. There was considerable opposition to the verdict, and even General Winfield Scott felt that Buell needed to be punished for his actions, but the court would not retry the case.

In the Mexican–American War, he served under both Zachary Taylor and Winfield Scott. He was brevetted three times for bravery and was wounded at Churubusco. Between the wars he served in the U.S. Army Adjutant General&#x27;s office and as an adjutant in California, reaching the rank of captain in 1851 and lieutenant colonel by the time the Civil War began.

==Civil War==

===Initial postings===
At the start of the Civil War, Buell sought an important command, but instead his friend George McClellan emerged as the champion of the Union war effort. Buell himself was sent all the way out to California. After the Union defeat at Bull Run, McClellan summoned him back east where he was quickly promoted to brigadier general of volunteers, to rank from May 17, 1861. Buell received offers to take a command in Kentucky, but instead he stayed in Washington helping organize the nascent Army of the Potomac and being appointed as a division commander. In November, McClellan succeeded Winfield Scott as general-in-chief of the Army, and decided to post Buell out west, dividing the trans-Appalachia theater between him and Maj. Gen Henry Halleck. In November 1861, he succeeded Brig. Gen. William T. Sherman in command at Louisville, Kentucky, as commander of the newly formed Army of the Ohio, which at this time was a barely-disciplined rabble. Buell immediately set himself to work shaping the raw recruits into a fighting force. Although the Lincoln administration pressured Buell to occupy Eastern Tennessee, an area of strong Unionist sentiment, Buell was in no hurry, and even McClellan became impatient with his slow progress. Buell&#x27;s excuse was that the railroad network in this area was poor, and he would have to rely on wagons for army supply that could be vulnerable to Confederate cavalry. Instead, he proposed a coordinated effort between him and Halleck to cut off Nashville. Halleck reluctantly agreed to the plan, which was helped along by Grant&#x27;s capture of Fort Henry and Fort Donelson. Although the city fell to the Army of the Ohio on February 25, 1862, Halleck&#x27;s relationship with Buell was strained. The same month, Andrew Johnson was made military governor of Tennessee and developed a lasting grudge against Buell for failing to liberate Eastern Tennessee. On March 21, Buell was promoted to major general of volunteers, but at the same time, Halleck rose to department commander which made Buell subordinate to him.

===Shiloh===

At the start of April, Buell was ordered to reinforce Grant&#x27;s Army of the Tennessee, then encamped at Pittsburg Landing next to the Tennessee River. On the morning of April 6, the Confederates launched a surprise attack on Grant&#x27;s army, beginning one of the largest and bloodiest battles of the war. After the Army of the Ohio arrived the next day, the combined Union forces repulsed the Confederates. Although Buell was the junior of the two generals in rank, he insisted that he was acting independently and would not accept orders from Grant. Buell considered himself the victor of Shiloh and denigrated Grant&#x27;s contribution, writing after the war that he had no &quot;marked influence that he exerted upon the fortune of the day.&quot; Contemporary historians, such as Larry Daniels and Kenneth W. Noe, consider that Grant actually saved himself by the conclusion of the first day of battle and that the rivalry between Grant and Buell hampered the conduct of battle on the second day. The commanders operated almost completely independently of each other and Buell &quot;proved slow and hesitant to commit himself.&quot;

Following Shiloh, Governor Johnson objected to Buell&#x27;s plans to withdraw the Nashville garrison on the grounds that Confederate sympathy in the city was still strong. However, Halleck sided with Buell and insisted that all available troops in the department were needed for the assault on Corinth. Henry Halleck arrived in person to take command of Grant and Buell&#x27;s armies. The combined Union force, 100,000 men strong, began an extremely sluggish pursuit against P.G.T. Beauregard&#x27;s Army of Mississippi, which had retreated into northern Mississippi. Despite a more than 2-1 numerical advantage, Halleck moved slowly. However, Buell was even slower and quickly caught the ire of Halleck. During the march to Corinth, Buell took extensive pauses to repair the railroad lines and would not entertain suggestions of allowing his army to live off the land. To that end, he court-martialed Col. John Turchin for allowing his soldiers to loot area homes. This action was not popular either with Buell&#x27;s troops or the War Department, and President Lincoln ultimately overturned the verdict, while Turchin eventually got promoted to brigadier general.

The Siege of Corinth ended in the Confederates abandoning the city on May 25. Afterwards, Halleck split up the two armies and sent Buell eastward to capture Chattanooga while Grant remained in the Corinth area. In July, Halleck was summoned back to Washington to replace George McClellan as commander-in-chief of all Union armies, thus effectively returning the two Western armies to independent action. Buell&#x27;s advance towards Chattanooga nearly rivaled the earlier march on Corinth for sluggishness, with extensive pauses to stop and repair railroad lines. When Nathan Bedford Forrest&#x27;s cavalry then ransacked the Army of Ohio&#x27;s supply lines, Buell all but terminated the effort to take Chattanooga. Thus after a busy winter and spring, activity in the Western theater during the summer of 1862 almost completely ground to a halt. On July 17, Buell was promoted to colonel in the regular army.

The summer months were increasingly frustrating for the Army of the Ohio, which was averaging barely a mile a day. Bored soldiers took to uncontrollable looting of the countryside and harassment of slaves. These infractions in their turn were punished harshly by Buell and by mid-August, morale in the army had almost collapsed. Despite protests from the War Department to move faster, Buell insisted that he could not hold Chattanooga for any length of time without proper caution and preparedness.

Grant, despite his professional rivalry following Shiloh, addressed these charges against Buell in his memoirs, writing:

===Kentucky===
In September, Confederate armies under Edmund Kirby Smith and Braxton Bragg invaded Kentucky and Buell was forced to take action. Buell wired Halleck that he planned to march on Louisville, but Halleck, already frustrated with his glacial movements in Tennessee, replied back that he did not care where Buell marched just as long as he was doing something to take the fight to the enemy. The Kentucky campaign did have the effect of re-energizing Buell&#x27;s demoralized soldiers who were excited to finally be going somewhere and march into a state that had been mostly untouched by war. Louisville was occupied by the Army of the Ohio on September 25, but despite learning that Bragg&#x27;s army was in nearby Munfordville, Buell, convinced that he was outnumbered, declined to pursue Bragg. A single corps of Buell&#x27;s army was attacked by Bragg at the Battle of Perryville on October 8, 1862, while Buell, a couple of miles behind the action, was not aware that a battle was taking place until late in the day and thus did not effectively engage the full strength of his army to defeat the smaller enemy force. Buell was urged by his officers to counterattack the next day, but he refused on the grounds that he did not know exactly how many Confederates he was facing. By morning, Bragg ordered a retreat from the field. Although Perryville was tactically indecisive, it halted the Confederate invasion of Kentucky and forced their withdrawal back into Tennessee.

Although the battle ended with the Union army in possession of the field, the Confederates had escaped to fight another day, and Buell had not engaged most of his army in spite of having nearly 60,000 men to face a mere 16,000 Confederates. Even some of Buell&#x27;s own officers and enlisted men began suspecting him of disloyalty, in part because he was one of a handful of Union generals to have owned slaves prior to the war. An Indiana artillery officer wrote &quot;After Perryville, I became convinced that the sooner Buell was relieved of command of the Army of the Ohio, the better.&quot; When President Lincoln urged an immediate pursuit of Bragg, he was told by Buell that the route directly south from Perryville into Eastern Tennessee was rough, wooded country with few roads and would be too difficult to maneuver through. He said that the only sensible route was to go back west to Nashville, then travel east across Tennessee to Chattanooga. Halleck wired Buell telling him &quot;The president does not understand why we cannot march as the enemy marches, live as he lives, and fight as he fights, unless we admit that there is some inherent defect in our generals and soldiers.&quot;

On October 24, Buell was relieved from command of the Army of the Ohio and replaced by Maj. Gen William Rosecrans. A military committee investigated Buell&#x27;s conduct during and after Perryville, but came to no conclusions, and Buell considered his reputation vindicated as he did not compromise his principles in waging war. After his dismissal, he was ordered to Indianapolis to await future assignments, but none came. When Grant was appointed general-in-chief of the army in March 1864, he offered Buell a possible assignment but he refused to serve under either Sherman or George Thomas on the grounds that he outranked both of them. In his memoirs, Grant called this &quot;the worst excuse a soldier can make for declining service&quot;. On May 23, Buell&#x27;s volunteer commission expired and he reverted to the regular army rank of colonel. Unable to tolerate this demotion, he resigned from the army on June 1.

==Later life and death==
Following the war Buell lived again in Indiana, and then in Kentucky, employed in the iron and coal industry as president of the Green River Iron Company. He continued to be a target of criticism for his conduct during the war. Although Buell did not write any memoirs, he did produce a series of newspaper articles defending himself and criticizing Grant, particularly for the events at Shiloh, and Buell to his dying day maintained that he was the hero of the battle. The death of his wife in 1881 was very hard on him, and his final years were marked by poverty and ill health. By 1898 he was an invalid, and he died on November 19. He was buried in Bellefontaine Cemetery in St. Louis.

==Legacy==
Buell earned the nickname &quot;The McClellan of the West&quot; for his cautious approach and desire for a limited war that would not disrupt civilian life in the South or interfere with slavery. Although he staunchly opposed secession, he was never able to reconcile himself with the Lincoln administration. Buell&#x27;s wife had owned slaves prior to the war, and their marriage, although she freed them shortly after the Confederate attack on Fort Sumter. Buell had no personal animosity towards slavery or the Southern way of life. He continued to be highly regarded by fellow generals, many of whom felt that the White House had been unjust towards him. William T. Sherman wrote to his brother John, a Congressman, &quot;You have driven off McClellan, and is Burnside any better? You have driven off Buell, and is Rosecrans any better?&quot; His harsh discipline and inability to relate to his soldiers on a personal level may have also contributed to his downfall.

Buell Armory on the University of Kentucky campus in Lexington, Kentucky, is named after Buell.

Buell Island in his hometown of Lowell is named after him.

His personal papers, maps, correspondence, uniform, West Point diploma and other possessions are held at the University of Notre Dame.

<text>KIIS 1011 (official callsign: 3TTT) is a commercial FM radio station broadcasting in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, on a frequency of 101.1 MHz and is the Melbourne affiliate of ARN&#x27;s KIIS Network. The station was formerly known as 3DB and 3TT, broadcasting on 1026 kHz AM, before converting to FM in 1990.

==History==
===3DB===

3DB was awarded its broadcast licence in 1925 but did not immediately come on air due to debates in Federal Parliament as to whether or not Australia should proceed with the then-unique system of A Class (later ABC) and B Class (later commercial) stations. The station was originally owned by Druleigh Business and Technical College Pty Ltd, hence the callsign DB. 3DB eventually made its on-air debut on 21 February 1927 in a fairly low-key manner.

From 1929 until 1987, 3DB was owned and operated by the Herald &amp; Weekly Times (HWT), owners of &quot;The Herald&quot; and &quot;The Sun News-Pictorial&quot;, then separate newspapers.

For most of this era 3DB was one of Melbourne&#x27;s most popular stations, topping ratings surveys for some decades. 3DB was extremely popular in all fields in which it broadcast. Music ranged from pop music and Top 40 to classical, some of it live. The station was also a big producer of radio drama (including soap operas), live variety programs, quizzes, etc. 3DB also transmitted many sporting events, particularly horse racing, VFL football, and test cricket from England. 3DB&#x27;s women&#x27;s programs and children&#x27;s session were also popular.

One of the most important people in 3DB&#x27;s history was David Thomas Worrall, who was appointed manager of the station by the &quot;Herald and Weekly Times&quot;″ Sir Keith Murdoch in 1929, and who was to remain as manager until 1958. He was responsible for introducing many big budget programs.

From 1942 onwards, 3DB was the radio broadcaster of the Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital&#x27;s Good Friday Appeal and played a major part in promoting the appeal, with the sums raised annually increasing dramatically from 1942 onwards.

After purchasing the Geelong Advertiser and its subsidiary 3GL in 1987, the Herald and Weekly Times owned more than one station in the Melbourne/Geelong region and, thus, was required by the Australian Broadcasting Tribunal to divest itself of one station. 3DB was sold and actually had four owners for short periods in the 12 months of 1987.

J Albert &amp; Son, a Sydney based music company and owners of 2UW, purchased 3DB in late 1987 and changed the call sign to 3TT. The last program to be broadcast under the 3DB call sign, in the very early hours of 2 April 1988, was a repeat of Bert Newton&#x27;s 1987 documentary on the 60th anniversary of 3DB.

===3TT===
The 3TT station name and a classic hits format were launched at 5.00 am on 2 April 1988. The first song played was The Doobie Brothers &quot;Listen to the Music&quot;. The major reason cited for the change of name was the fact that 3DB had recently broadcast under the slogan &quot;3DB - The New Beginning&quot; and it was felt that that would have made it difficult to dramatically change the format whilst retaining the name, 3DB. However, the new owners had actually considered a few other new call-signs, particularly names which included the same initial being repeated twice, such as 3BB or 3MM.

Lawrence Costin who had been on the 3DB announcing staff for over 30 years was the only 3DB on-air personality to be retained by 3TT; as a newsreader and reporter.

===From AM to FM===
At midnight on 23-24 June 1990 the station converted to FM broadcasting on 101.1 MHz. 3DB/3TT&#x27;s old AM frequency of 1026 AM was returned to the government, and from 1991, it was used by the ABC for 3PB, which broadcast intermittently with live coverage of federal parliament. In 1994, 3PB became a full-time news and parliament station ABC NewsRadio.

The events leading up to the transference of 3TT&#x27;s licence to the FM radio band are quite complicated and political. Broadcasting on the FM band commenced in the US as early as 1933. There had been Australian experiments on the FM band in earlier years, but in the 1970s the Whitlam Labor government decided to issue the first permanent FM licences in Australia to community radio stations. The first such licence in Melbourne was issued to 3MBS in 1975. The Fraser coalition government continued the Whitlam policy and expanded the range of FM broadcasters, firstly by introducing the Australia-wide ABC FM network. This was followed by a number of brand new commercial stations; the first to open in Melbourne being EON FM.

Not surprisingly, there were protests from commercial stations on the AM band because they were not able to bid for stations on the FM band. This was seen by many as a big problem as FM was then seen as the future of radio broadcasting, and many stations who had pioneered the commercial side of the Australian industry saw themselves as being left out of its future development, even though many of them - including 3TT - had a history dating back to the 1920s. The Fraser government was not prepared to allocate FM licences to all AM stations, which is what the industry wanted, and what had occurred in many overseas countries. However, under some pressure, in the late 1980s the government decided to transfer one or two stations in the major cities from the AM to FM band, using a much criticised auction-style system in which those stations wishing to transfer bands were to put in bids, with the highest bids being accepted. In Melbourne the two highest bids were to be accepted, with six of the seven existing AM stations placing bids. (The exception being 3AW which argued that its older listening-base preferred the AM band to the FM band.)

The three highest bids were received from: 3KZ - $32 million; 3AK - $22 million; and 3TT - $11 million. The vast disparity in the bids suggests that there was no collusion between stations, and virtually no industrial espionage. Further, 3XY which had put in an even lower bid was quite convinced that it would get one of the two FM licences being offered.

In 1987, Kerry Packer of Australian Consolidated Press had sold the Nine Television Network to Alan Bond, and 3AK was included in the deal, even though Bond had made it clear that he was interested in the TV stations but not in radio - he therefore defaulted on his payment for an FM licence. The second Melbourne FM licence on offer was, therefore, eventually given to the third-highest bidder, 3TT.

===TT-FM===
Initially from opening on 24 June 1990, 3TTT retained the format of 3TT, using the on-air name 101.1 TT-FM. The first song that aired on TT-FM was &quot;In the Air Tonight&quot; by Phil Collins. In 1993, TT-FM was relaunched as an adult contemporary music station.

=== Mix 101.1 ===
In June 2001, the station rebranded to Mix 101.1 after joining the Mix Network. The station was similar to Mix 106.5 in Sydney in creating an emphasis on more music and less talk.

The last song that aired on Mix 101.1 was &quot;Bye Bye Bye&quot; by NSYNC.

=== KIIS 101.1 ===
In November 2014, the Australian Radio Network announced that Mix 101.1 would rebrand to KIIS 101.1 on 19 January 2015 with a new breakfast and drive show. &quot;Matt &amp; Jane&quot; replaced &quot;Chrissie &amp; Jane&quot; in the station&#x27;s breakfast timeslot, with existing presenter Jane Hall to remain alongside former Fox FM breakfast and Triple M drive host Matt Tilley. &quot;Rosso on Drive&quot; was replaced by &quot;Hughesy &amp; Kate&quot;, hosted by Dave Hughes and Kate Langbroek and formerly of Nova 100 breakfast. Both shows began on 19 January 2015, with the latter being networked across the KIIS Network of stations.

In October 2015, Jane Hall announced that she would be leaving the station and &quot;Matt &amp; Jane&quot; at the end of the year to return to acting. She was replaced by Nova 100 breakfast co-host Meshel Laurie.

In October 2017, ARN announced that Matt Tilley, Meshel Laurie, Dave Hughes and Kate Langbroek would leave the station at the end of the year. &quot;Matt &amp; Meshel&quot; was replaced by Jason &#x27;Jase&#x27; Hawkins and Polly &#x27;PJ&#x27; Harding. Will McMahon and Woody Whitelaw from Hit 92.9 have been announced as the new drive hosts. &quot;Hughesy &amp; Kate&quot; moved to Southern Cross Austereo&#x27;s Hit Network to replace &quot;Hamish &amp; Andy&quot;.

In July 2021, ARN announced that Jason &#x27;Jase&#x27; Hawkins would be joined by Lauren Phillips with &quot;Jase &amp; Lauren&quot; starting 9 August following Polly &#x27;PJ&#x27; Harding&#x27;s departure from the station on July 23, 2021.

In November 2023, after months of media speculation, it was announced that &quot;The Kyle and Jackie O Show&quot; would be networked from KIIS 106.5 Sydney in 2024 effectively ending &quot;Jase &amp; Lauren.&quot; The final show aired on Friday 1 December 2023. In March 2024, &quot;Jase &amp; Lauren&quot; replaced &quot;Ben, Liam &amp; Belle&quot; to host breakfast on Nova 100. 

In March 2024, ARN announced changes to its daytime programming with Gordie Waters being networked from Sydney into Melbourne and KIIS 97.3 in Brisbane from April. Byron Cooke had previously announced his resignation.

== Studios ==
3DB&#x27;s original studio was on the 10th floor of Capitol House, above the Capitol Theatre, Swanston Street, next to the Druleigh Business and Technical College, original owners of the station. In 1929, a short while after the HWT purchased 3DB, the studios and offices were moved to 74 Flinders Street, to the east of the HWT building on the corner of Flinders and Exhibition Streets. In 1966 the HWT truck dock was expanded, and in the process 74 Flinders Street was pulled down, with the station then moving to 61 Flinders Lane, immediately behind the HWT building.

When 3DB became 3TT the station continued to broadcast from 61 Flinders Lane, but within a short time, in December 1988, 3TT moved to new studios in Queensbridge Street, South Melbourne.

The station is now located in the inner suburb of Richmond in the Pelaco building, sharing facilities with sister station Gold 104.3.

<text>Prussia (; ; ; ; ; //) is a historical region in Central Europe on the south-eastern coast of the Baltic Sea, that ranges from the Vistula delta in the west to the end of the Curonian Spit in the east and extends inland as far as Masuria, divided between Poland, Russia (Kaliningrad Oblast) and Lithuania. This region is often also referred to as Old Prussia.

Tacitus&#x27;s &quot;Germania&quot; (98 AD) is the oldest known record of an eyewitness account on the territory and its inhabitants. Pliny the Elder had already confirmed that the Romans had navigated into the waters beyond the &quot;Cimbric peninsula&quot; (Jutland). Suiones, Sitones, Goths and other Germanic people had temporarily settled to the east and west of the Vistula River during the Migration Period, adjacent to the Aesti, who lived further to the east.

== Overview ==

The region&#x27;s inhabitants of the Middle Ages were first called &quot;Bruzi&quot; in the brief text of the Bavarian Geographer and have since been referred to as Old Prussians, who, beginning in 997 AD, repeatedly defended themselves against conquest attempts by the newly created Duchy of the Polans. The territories of the Old Prussians and the neighboring Curonians and Livonians were politically unified in the 1230s under the State of the Teutonic Order. The former kingdom and later state of Prussia (1701–1947) derived its name from the region.

The Teutonic Knights invaded and annexed the region of Pomerelia from Poland into their monastic state, which already included historical Prussia, located east of the region. After the acquisition of Pomerelia in 1308–1310, the meaning of the term &quot;Prussia&quot; was widened in the German terminology to include areas west of the Vistula, including Vistula/Eastern Pomerania, although it was never inhabited by Baltic Prussians but by the Slavic Poles. After the area was reintegrated with Poland in 1466 both names were in use: &quot;Pomerania&quot; was used when referring to the Pomeranian Voivodeship (Gdańsk Pomerania) and the Chełmno Voivodeship, while Royal Prussia was used as the name of the wider province, which, however, also included the Malbork Voivodeship and the Prince-Bishopric of Warmia, covering the Prussian historical areas of Pomesania, Pogesania and Warmia, the only actual Prussian territories of the province, while the rump Teutonic state, called the Monastic Prussia thereafter, formed a part of Poland as a fief, finally secularised in 1525 to become the Lutheran Ducal Prussia.

Brandenburg Electors obtained the separation of the Duchy of Prussia from Poland in 1660, taking advantage of the Russo-Swedish Deluge, and merged it with the Electorate of Brandenburg to form Brandenburg-Prussia, shortly thereafter becoming the Kingdom of Prussia. Subsequently, it entered into an alliance with Austria and Russia, invading Polish territories of Royal Prussia, annexing and dividing it, with its bulk (including Pomerelia and the Malbork Land comprising northern parts of Pomesania and Pogesania) forming (along with the northern part of Greater Poland detached from the Grand Duchy of Posen) the Province of West Prussia, while Warmia was assigned to East Prussia, with both West and East Prussia remaining outside the German Confederation. In contrast, the Lauenburg and Bütow Land was annexed in 1777 immediately into the Province of Pomerania, but remained outside the Holy Roman Empire and was incorporated in 1815 only into its successor, the German Confederation, continuing to be a part of the Diocese of Chełmno.

The Province of East Prussia (the original Prussia) and the annexed Polish territories turned into the Province of West Prussia were merged in 1829 to form a single Province of Prussia, a part of the kingdom remaining outside of Germany until the creation of the North German Confederation in 1866 during the unification of Germany. The merged territory was, however, again split into East and West Prussia in 1878.

East Prussia, West Prussia, the Province of Posen and the Starostwo of Draheim were annexed by Germany upon the formation of North German Confederation in 1866 and became a target of aggressive Germanization, German settlement, anti-Catholic campaigns (Kulturkampf), as well as disfranchisement and expropriations of Poles.

After the Treaty of Versailles, only the predominantly German-speaking western and eastern rim of the former West Prussia remained a part of Germany, forming part of the rump province of Posen-West Prussia (except for the Lauenburg and Bütow Land remaining a part of the Province of Pomerania, as well as the &quot;Regierungsbezirk Westpreussen&quot; which was made part of East Prussia), while its bulk was awarded to the recreated Polish state.

On the other hand, only minor part of East Prussia around Działdowo was transferred to Poland, the Klaipėda Region formed a free city supervised by the League of Nations, annexed following the Klaipėda Revolt by Lithuania but reclaimed by Germany in 1939, while the bulk (including entire Warmia and most of Masuria) remained within the Free State of Prussia, a successor of the Kingdom of Prussia and a constituent part of the German Weimar Republic, following the 1920 East Prussian plebiscite.

Since its conquest by the Soviet Army with evacuation and expulsion of the German-speaking inhabitants in 1945 in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, the region of Prussia remains divided between northern Poland (most of the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, and the four counties of Pomeranian Voivodeship east of Vistula), Russia&#x27;s Kaliningrad exclave, and southwestern Lithuania (former Klaipėda Region).

==History==
===Prehistory and early history===

Indo-European settlers first arrived in the region during the 4th millennium BC, which in the Baltic would diversify into the satem Balto-Slavic branch which would ultimately give rise to the Balts as the speakers of the Baltic languages. The Balts would have become differentiated into Western and Eastern Balts in the late 1st millennium BC. The region was inhabited by ancestors of Western Balts – Old Prussians, Sudovians/Jotvingians, Scalvians, Nadruvians, and Curonians while the eastern Balts settled in what is now Lithuania, Latvia and Belarus.

The Greek explorer Pytheas (4th century BC) may have referred to the territory as &quot;Mentenomon&quot; and to the inhabitants as &quot;Guttones&quot; (neighbours of the &quot;Teutones&quot;, probably referring to the Goths). A river to the east of the Vistula was called the &quot;Guttalus&quot;, perhaps corresponding to the Nemunas, the Łyna, or the Pregola. In AD 98 Tacitus described one of the tribes living near the Baltic Sea () as &quot;Aestiorum gentes&quot; and amber-gatherers.

The Vikings started to penetrate the southeastern shores of the Baltic Sea in the 7th and 8th centuries. The largest trade centres of the Prussians, such as Truso and Kaup, seem to have absorbed a number of Norse people. Prussians used the Baltic Sea as a trading route, frequently travelling from Truso to Birka (in present-day Sweden).

At the end of the Viking Age, the sons of Danish kings Harald Bluetooth and Cnut the Great launched several expeditions against the Prussians. They destroyed many areas in Prussia, including Truso and Kaup, but failed to dominate the population totally. A Viking (Varangian) presence in the area was &quot;less than dominant and very much less than imperial.&quot;
===Old Prussians===
According to a legend, recorded by Simon Grunau, the name &quot;Prussia&quot; is derived from Pruteno (or Bruteno), the chief priest of Prussia and brother of the legendary king Widewuto, who lived in the 6th century. The regions of Prussia and the corresponding tribes are said to bear the names of Widewuto&#x27;s sons — for example, Sudovia is named after Widewuto&#x27;s son Sudo.

The Old Prussians spoke a variety of languages, with Old Prussian belonging to the Western branch of the Baltic language group. Old Prussian, or related Western Baltic dialects, may have been spoken as far southeast as Masovia and even Belarus in the early medieval period, but these populations would probably have undergone Slavicization before the 10th century.

The territory was identified as &quot;Brus&quot; in the 8th-century map of the Bavarian Geographer and &quot;Bruzze/Pruzze/Przze&quot; in the &quot;Dagome iudex&quot;. Adam of Bremen mentions Prussians as &quot;Prusos/Pruzzi&quot; in 1072., while Gallus Anonymous mentions &quot;Prussia&quot; in his &quot;Gesta principum Polonorum&quot; in 1113. In the first half of the 13th century, Bishop Christian of Prussia recorded the history of a much earlier era. In Neo-Latin the area is called &quot;Borussia&quot; and its inhabitants &quot;Borussi&quot;.
After the Christianisations of the West Slavs in the 10th century, the state of the Polans was established and there were first attempts at conquering and baptizing the Baltic peoples. Bolesław I Chrobry sent Adalbert of Prague in 997 on a military and Christianizing mission. Adalbert, accompanied by armed guards, attempted to convert the Prussians to Christianity. He was killed by a Prussian pagan priest in 997.
In 1015, Bolesław sent soldiers again, with some short-lived success, gaining regular paid tribute from some Prussians in the border regions, but it did not last. Polish rulers sent invasions to the territory in 1147, 1161–1166, and a number of times in the early 13th century. While these were repelled by the Prussians, the Chełmno Land became exposed to their frequent raids.

At that time, Pomerelia belonged to the diocese of Włocławek. Chełmno Land (including Michałów Land and later Lubawa Land) belonged in turn to the diocese of Płock, since 1223 governed in the name of the Bishop of Płock by Christian of Oliva, a missionary bishop appointed for Prussia in 1216.

===Christianization and the Teutonic Knights===

In the beginning of the 13th century, Konrad of Mazovia had called for Crusades and tried unsuccessfully to conquer Prussia for years. Bishop Christian of Oliva established the Order of Dobrzyń in order to defend Masovia against the raids of Old Prussians. However, the rather innumerous order (initially 15 knights, with 35 knights at its highest) did not prove effective in countering Prussians in battle. Christian achieved subjugation and conversion of Prussians only in the Lubawa Land. Therefore, the pope set up further crusades.

The Duke finally invited the Teutonic Knights in 1226, expelled by force of arms by King Andrew II of Hungary in the previous year following their attempts to build their own state within Transylvania. The Knights were expected to fight the inhabitants of Prussia in exchange for a fief of Chełmno Land. Prussia was conquered by the Teutonic Knights during the Prussian Crusade and administered within their State of the Teutonic Order, which begins the process of Germanization in the area. Bishop Christian had to deal with the constant cut-back of his autonomy by the Knights and asked the Roman Curia for mediation. In 1243, the Papal legate William of Modena divided the Prussian lands of the Order&#x27;s State into four dioceses, whereby the bishops retained the secular rule over about one third of the diocesan territory:
*Bishopric of Chełmno (Chełmno Land and Lubawa Land)
*Bishopric of Pomesania (Pomesania)
*Bishopric of Warmia (state)/ Diocese of Warmia (ecclesiastical ambit)
*Bishopric of Samland (Sambia)
all suffragan dioceses under the Archbishopric of Riga. Christian was supposed to choose one of them, but did not agree to the division. He possibly retired to the Cistercians Abbey in Sulejów, where he died before the conflict was solved.

The city of Königsberg (modern Kaliningrad) was founded in 1255, and joined the Hanseatic League in 1340, thus connecting Prussia to the European trade network spanning via the North Sea and the Baltic Sea. In 1492, a life of Saint Dorothea of Montau, published in Marienburg (Malbork), became the first printed publication in Prussia.
===Efforts to expand the meaning of the designation===

The Teutonic Knights soon turned against their Polish benefactors in the same way, as they earlier did in Hungary.

The Polish region of Pomerelia (including Gdańsk Pomerania and the city of Gdańsk as its parts) which was never inhabited by the Old Prussians, and which was called (&#x27;Pomerania&#x27;) in Polish language since the Early Middle Ages, was forcibly occupied by the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights in 1308, following an invasion of Poland under the pretext of aiding the King Władysław I Łokietek to quell a rebellion against him, incited by a conspiracy of the Margraviate of Brandenburg with the local Swienca family. Teutonic atrocities against the Polish population followed, such as the Slaughter of Gdańsk. The Teutonic Knights took control of the region from Poland, integrating it into their monastic state, which already included historical Prussia, located east of the region. After the acquisition of Pomerelia in 1308–1310, the meaning of the term &quot;Prussia&quot; was widened in the German terminology to include areas west of the Vistula, including Vistula/Eastern Pomerania, although it was never inhabited by Baltic Prussians but by the Slavic Poles. The possession of Danzig and Pomerelia by the Teutonic Order was questioned consistently by the Polish kings Władysław I and Casimir the Great in legal suits in the papal court in 1320 and 1333. Both times, as well as in 1339, the Teutonic Knights were ordered by the Pope to return Pomerelia and other lands back to Poland, but did not comply. The conquered Danzig (Gdańsk) joined the Hanseatic League in 1361. These events resulted in a series of Polish–Teutonic Wars throughout the 14th and 15th centuries. Under the Teutonic rule, an influx of western, mainly German-speaking farmers, traders and craftsmen was encouraged. Subsequent rebellions organized by the local population against the Teutonic state, initially by the Lizard Union and later by the Prussian Confederation, both pledging allegiance to the Polish king, caused the Thirteen Years&#x27; War which ultimately led to the Second Peace of Thorn, when most of the region and was reclaimed by Poland and henceforth formed the bulk of Royal Prussia.
With the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), the territory of the Monastic State was divided into eastern and western parts. The western part became the province of Royal Prussia (later also part of the Greater Poland Province) of the Kingdom of Poland, while the eastern part of the monastic state became a fief and protectorate of Poland, also considered an integral part of the &quot;one and indivisible&quot; Kingdom of Poland, initially called &quot;Monastic Prussia&quot; or &quot;Teutonic Prussia&quot;, secularised in 1525 to become Ducal Prussia. At the same time, the Polish monarchs assumed the title of the King of Prussia.

After Pomerelia was reintegrated with Poland in 1466, the designation &quot;Pomerania&quot; was restored and used when referring to the Pomeranian Voivodeship (Gdańsk Pomerania) and the Chełmno Voivodeship, while the entire territory conquered by the Kingdom of Poland from the Teutonic Order was known as &quot;Royal Prussia&quot;. The latter also included, however, also the truly Prussian historical areas of Prince-Bishopric of Warmia, as well as the Malbork Land comprising northern parts of Pomesania and Pogesania. These were the only actual Prussian territories of Royal Prussia. Initially enjoying broad autonomy including an own local legislature, the Prussian Estates, and maintaining its own laws, customs and rights, Royal Prussia was ultimately re-absorbed directly into the Crown of the Kingdom of Poland, following the Union of Lublin in 1569. The locally spoken language differed among social classes, with the aristocracy and urban burghers initially highly Germanised as a result of earlier Teutonic policies, but gradually shifting towards Polish in the later years, while the peasantry continued as predominantly Kashubian- and Polish-speaking West of Vistula; the part East of Vistula was predominantly German-speaking, with decreasing number of Old Prussian and increasing number of Polish minorities. A small area in the west of Pomerelia, the Lębork and Bytów Land, was granted to the rulers of the Duchy of Pomerania as a Polish fief before it was reintegrated with Poland in 1637, and later again transformed into a Polish fief, which it remained along the Starostwo of Draheim until the First Partition of Poland.

The realm of the King in Prussia established in 1701 from the former Ducal Prussia subsequently entered into an alliance with Austria and Russia, invading Polish territories of Royal Prussia. In the First Partition of Poland, the King in Prussia gained majority of the territory of Royal Prussia including the Lauenburg and Bütow Land (but excluding Danzig and Toruń which were captured along with the region of Greater Poland in the Second Partition of Poland), as well as the Starostwo of Draheim. The former Royal Prussia was divided in 1773. Its bulk which included the historically Prussian Malbork Land (northern parts of Pomesania and Pogesania) but also the historically Polish Pomerelia (Vistula Pomerania) formed the newly established province of West Prussia, while the name &quot;Pomerania/Pomerelia&quot; was avoided by Prussian and later German authorities in relation to this region, aiming to eradicate its usage completely. The historically Prussian Warmia was in turn integrated into East Prussia. In contrast, the Lauenburg and Bütow Land and the Starostwo of Draheim were annexed in 1777 immediately into the Province of Pomerania. The annexation of Royal Prussia allowed the Prussian king to assume the title of &quot;King of Prussia&quot; thereafter. Further attempts to expand the meaning of the designation of Prussia was undertaken following the Second Partition of Poland, when Greater Poland and Northern Masovia were annexed by the Kingdom of Prussia and renamed South Prussia, and the Third Partition of Poland, when Prussia annexed parts Masovia, Podlachia, Trakai Voivodeship and Samogitia under the name of New East Prussia. Both invented names were eventually abandoned, following the Napoleonic Wars. All the annexed Polish lands remained outside of the Holy Roman Empire until its dissolution in 1806.

During the Napoleonic era the Greater Polish territories and the Chełmno Land formed part of the Duchy of Warsaw following the Treaties of Tilsit, and Danzig was granted a status of a Free City. However, after the Congress of Vienna, the Polish duchy was again partitioned between Russia and Prussia, with Prussia annexing the Free City and the Chełmno Land into the reconstituted West Prussia. The annexation was associated with another attempt to artificially expand the meaning of the designation of Prussia by transferring the northern part of Netze District, a fragment of Greater Poland detached from its bulk (the Grand Duchy of Posen), to West Prussia, while the district&#x27;s easternmost fragment was awarded to the Russian-ruled Congress Poland.

Though the Kingdom of Prussia was a member of the German Confederation established by the Congress of Vienna as a replacement for the dissolved Holy Roman Empire from 1815 to 1866, only those of the territories of the kingdom which were previously included in the HRE as well as the Lauenburg and Bütow Land and the former Starostwo of Draheim (both integrated into the Province of Pomerania) became part of the Confederation, while the Grand Duchy of Posen (later demoted to an ordinary Province of Posen following the failed Greater Poland uprising (1848)), the Provinces of West Prussia and East Prussia (merged in the years 1829 to 1878 to form a single Province of Prussia) remained outside of the German Confederation (thus of Germany) until the creation of the North German Confederation in 1866 at the start of the unification of Germany.

Outside of the Kingdom of Prussia and later Germany, Pomerelia was termed Polish Pomerania () since at least the 18th century to distinguish it from Hither and Farther Pomerania, territories long outside of Polish rule. In the late 19th century this term was used in order to underline Polish claims to that area that was then ruled by the German Kingdom of Prussia. The designation of Polish Pomerania became obsolete since Farther Pomerania and a small part of Hither Pomerania were also transferred to Poland as part of the territories recovered from Germany, following World War II.

As agreed upon in the Treaty of Versailles, most of the Pomerelian part of the Province of West Prussia that had belonged to the Kingdom of Prussia and the German Empire since the Partitions of Poland was retroceded to the Second Polish Republic, becoming its Pomeranian Voivodeship, the (originally Prussian) territory of Regierungsbezirk Westpreussen east of Vistula remained with Germany as a part of East Prussia, while the western rim of Pomerelia became part of the German province of Posen-West Prussia, named so in spite of containing no originally Prussian territory. Danzig became a free city under the protection of the League of Nations.

The area was occupied and illegally annexed by the Nazi Germany during the invasion of Poland in 1939, as well as renamed Reichsgau Danzig-Westpreussen, with numerous German atrocities against the local population. Nazi Germany also undertook another attempt to artificially expand the meaning of the designation of Prussia, this time by enlarging the territory of the province of East Prussia through annexation into it of parts of Northern Masovia under the name of Regierungsbezirk Zichenau, as well as of the Suwałki Region, both referred to as South East Prussia, in relation to the New East Prussia of the times of Polish Partitions (see above). At the same time, the Regierungsbezirk Westpreussen was separated from East Prussia and integrated into Reichsgau Danzig-Westpreussen. In the aftermath of the German attack on the Soviet Union in June 1941, a further German attempt to expand the meaning of the designation of Prussia was undertaken, when the westernmost portion of Soviet Belarus (which, until 1939, belonged to the Polish state), was placed under the German Civilian Administration (&quot;Zivilverwaltungsgebiet&quot;) as the Bialystok District, an entity in association with (but not part of) East Prussia, nevertheless it was also denoted on some Nazi maps as South East Prussia, with both territories remaining under common management and leadership of Erich Koch, a war criminal sentenced after the war by a Polish court to death, albeit with his penalty later commuted to life imprisonment.

Following the example of earlier German policies, there was a short-lived initiative in the Polish post-World War II government to rename the newly acquired original Prussia to an invented name of &quot;Masovian Pomerania&quot;; it was, however, quickly abandoned.

In 1995, the governments of Berlin and Brandenburg proposed to merge the states in order to form a new state with the name of &quot;Berlin-Brandenburg&quot;, though some suggested calling the proposed new state &quot;Prussia&quot;, in spite of the territories being located far away from the region of Prussia. The merger was rejected in a plebiscite in 1996 – while West Berliners voted for a merger, East Berliners and Brandenburgers voted against it.

===Early modern era===

In 1525, the last Grand Master reigning in the State of the Teutonic Order, Albert of Brandenburg, a member of a cadet branch of the House of Hohenzollern, adopted the Lutheran faith, resigned his position, and assumed the title of &quot;Duke of Prussia&quot;. In a deal partially brokered by Martin Luther, the Duchy of Prussia became the first Protestant state and a vassal of Poland. The ducal capital of Königsberg, now Kaliningrad, became a centre of learning and printing through the establishment of the Albertina University in 1544 for not only the dominant German culture, but also the thriving Polish and Lithuanian communities as well. It was in Königsberg that the first Lutheran books in Polish, Lithuanian, and Prussian languages were published.

Rulership of Ducal Prussia passed to the senior Hohenzollern branch, the ruling Electors of Brandenburg, in 1618, and Polish sovereignty over the duchy ended in 1657 with the Treaty of Wehlau. There was strong opposition to the separation of the region from Poland, especially in Königsberg. A confederation was formed in the city to maintain Poland&#x27;s sovereignty over the city and region. The Brandenburg Elector and his army, however, entered the city and abducted and imprisoned the leader of the city&#x27;s anti-Elector opposition Hieronymus Roth. In 1663, the city burghers, forced by Elector Frederick William, swore an oath of allegiance to him, however, in the same ceremony they still also pledged allegiance to Poland.

Taking advantage of the fact that Ducal Prussia lay outside of the Holy Roman Empire, Frederick I achieved the elevation of the duchy to a kingdom in 1701, styling himself &quot;King in Prussia&quot;, because his kingdom included only part of historic Prussia, and the title &quot;King of Prussia&quot; was still held by the Polish monarchs. Lithuanian culture thrived in the part of the region known as Lithuania Minor, while the Kursenieki lived along the coast in the vicinity of the Curonian and Vistula Spits.

The Old Prussian language had mostly disappeared by 1700. The last speakers may have died in the plague and famine that ravaged Prussia in 1709 to 1711. In 1724, King Frederick William I of Prussia prohibited Poles, Samogitians and Jews from settling in Lithuania Minor in the eastern part of the region, and initiated German colonization to change the region&#x27;s ethnic composition.

===Modern era===

The Province of East Prussia (the original Prussia) and the annexed Polish territories turned into the Province of West Prussia were merged in 1829 to form a single Province of Prussia, a part of the kingdom remaining outside of Germany until the creation of the North German Confederation in 1866 during the unification of Germany. The merged territory was, however, again split into East and West Prussia in 1878.

As agreed upon in the Treaty of Versailles, East Prussia, minus the Memelland, expanded by addition of the Regierungsbezirk Westpreussen (the only part of former West Prussia containing originally Prussian territory) remained within the Free State of Prussia, a successor of the Kingdom of Prussia and a constituent part of the German Weimar Republic, following the 1920 East Prussian plebiscite. The democratic government of the Free State was removed as a result the 1932 Prussian coup d&#x27;état which also facilitated the Nazi takeover of government. In the March 1933 German federal election, the last pre-war German elections, the local population of East Prussia voted overwhelmingly for Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Party.

====World War II====

After the 1939 German ultimatum to Lithuania, the Klaipėda region was integrated again into East Prussia. During World War II, the Polish ethnic minorities of Catholic Warmians and Powiślans, as well as Lutheran Masurians were persecuted by the Nazi German government, which wanted to erase all aspects of Polish culture and Polish language in Warmia, Masuria and Powiśle The Jews who remained in East Prussia in 1942 were shipped to concentration camps, including Theresienstadt in occupied Czechoslovakia, Kaiserwald in occupied Latvia, and camps in Minsk in occupied Byelorussian Soviet Socialist Republic.

The Soldau concentration camp and were operated in the region mostly for Polish prisoners, as well as several subcamps of the Stutthof concentration camp, and several prisoner-of-war camps for Allied POWs, including Polish, Belgian, British, French, Dutch, Serbian, Italian, Soviet, Australian, Canadian, New Zealander, South African, such as Stalag I-A, Stalag I-B, Stalag I-C, Stalag I-D, Stalag XX-B, Stalag Luft VI and Oflags 52, 53, 60 and 63 with numerous forced labour subcamps. Many expelled Poles from German-occupied Poland were enslaved by the Germans as forced labour in the region. There was also a camp for Romani people in Königsberg (see &quot;Romani Holocaust&quot;).

The Polish resistance movement was active in the region, with activities including distribution of Polish underground press, infiltration of the German arms industry, sabotage actions, executions of Nazis, theft of German weapons, ammunition and equipment, smuggling data on German concentration camps and prisons, and organization of transports of POWs who escaped German POW camps via the ports of Gdańsk and Gdynia to neutral Sweden.

Beginning in 1944 with the East Prussian offensive of Soviet troops, the German-speaking population was evacuated.

===Contemporary era===

The province of East Prussia ceased to exist in 1945, following the Potsdam Agreement, when it was divided between Poland and the Soviet Union, with the latter dividing its part further between the Lithuanian SSR and the Russian SFSR. The part assigned to Poland was organized as the provisional Masurian District, later reduced by the annexation of its northern strip with the towns of Gierdawy and Iławka by the Soviet Union, and transferring its westernmost counties to Gdańsk Voivodeship and easternmost counties to Białystok Voivodeship, and finally transformed into Olsztyn Voivodeship in 1946. The Klaipėda Region was returned to the Lithuanian SRR, while the remaining territory, annexed by the Russian FSSR, was in turn named the Kaliningrad Oblast in 1946. The inhabitants not evacuated during the war were expelled in accordance with the Potsdam Agreement, with the exception of Polish minorities of Powiślans, Warmians and Masurians, considered to be of Polish descent. The situation was different, however, for the Prussian Lithuanians in Lithuania Minor, a part of the Soviet share of the former East Prussia. The government of the Lithuanian SSR followed Soviet policy and viewed the Prussian Lithuanians as Germans. About 8,000 persons were repatriated from DP camps during 1945–50. However, their homes and farms were not returned as either Russians or Lithuanians had already occupied their property. Prussians who remained in the former Klaipėda Region were fired from their jobs and otherwise discriminated against. After the collapse of the Soviet Union, some Prussian Lithuanians and their descendants did not regain lost property in the Klaipėda region.

Prussia as a political entity was abolished on 25 February 1947 by decree of the Allied Control Council. The decree declared that Prussia from early days had been a bearer of militarism and reaction in Germany.
In line with this assessment and the ideological justification of &quot;Recoverred Territories&quot;, the use of Prussia as a geographic designation was discouraged by the postwar authorities of Poland and the Soviet Union. The Polish region of Pomerelia (Gdansk Pomerania and the Chełmno Land) reverted to its original name already prior to World War II, as the name West Prussia was always regarded in Poland as an artificial German invention. In the case of East Prussia (the original Prussia), Polish authorities promoted using the designations of Powiśle in the case of Pomesania and Pogesania, approximately translated in , Warmia in the case of the former Prince-Bishopric of Warmia and Masuria in the case of the remainder of Polish share of the former East Prussia. The designation of Kaliningrad Oblast was promoted by the Soviet authorities in the case of the Russian part of the territory, instead. The policy was embraced by the Polish population who had hardly any sympathy for the legacy of Prussia, partially due to numerous attempts throughout history to annex various Polish territories with their subsequent artificial renaming as another part of Prussia in order to imply their originally Prussian history (see above), while the State of Prussia was perceived as a primary driving force for the Partitions of Poland with subsequent persecution and attempted Germanization of Poles, politically dominated by the Prussian Junkers with strong anti-Polish sentiment, and finally, the German Province of East Prussia was regarded as an area of persecutions against Polish-speaking minority (Warmians, Masurians, Powiślans), but most importantly as a Nazi political stronghold whose existence as an exclave resulted in German irredentist demands towards Poland, blamed as one of the primary causes of the calamity of World War II and the ensuing German atrocities. An important factor was also West Germany&#x27;s rejection of the validity of the postwar Polish Western border on the Oder–Neisse line (until 1972 total, 1972-1991 &quot;de iure&quot;) rendering any attempts of Poles to remind or maintain the Prussian regional identity an easy target for the Polish authorities, interpreted as undermining future security and territorial integrity of Poland. The policy achieved its goals, and the name Prussia is nowadays used in Polish official documents and colloquial language almost exclusively in historical context, when referring to Royal Prussia, the Free State of Prussia and its preceding entities (the (post-1466) Monastic Prussia, the Duchy of Prussia, Brandenburg-Prussia and the Kingdom of Prussia), the former Province of East Prussia, or to the territory of Old Prussians, but almost never when referring to contemporary geographic region. Since 1991, the name Prussia has, however, been re-acknowledged among Polish historians as the proper designation for the historic region, understood as defined by its original borders (excluding Pomerelia with Gdańsk Pomerania, the Chełmno and the Michałów Lands, as well as sometimes the Lubawa Land), resulting in its increasing usage in this context in the Polish scientific historical publications.

Powiśle, Warmia and Masuria are now in Poland (most of the Warmian-Masurian Voivodeship, and the four counties of Pomeranian Voivodeship east of Vistula), the former Memelland or Klaipėda region is now divided between the Klaipėda and Tauragė counties of Lithuania, while the rest of the northern Prussia forms the Kaliningrad Oblast exclave of the Russian Federation. Only the latter part remains outside of the European Union.

<text>Prussia (, ; Old Prussian: &quot;Prūsija, Prūsa&quot;) was a German state centred on the North European Plain that originated from the 1525 secularization of the Prussian part of the State of the Teutonic Order. The Knights had to relocate their headquarters to Mergentheim, but managed to keep land in Livonia until 1561.

Prussia formed the German Empire when it united the German states in 1871. It was &quot;de facto&quot; dissolved by an emergency decree transferring powers of the Prussian government to German Chancellor Franz von Papen in 1932 and &quot;de jure&quot; by an Allied decree in 1947. For centuries, the House of Hohenzollern ruled Prussia, expanding its size with the Prussian Army. Prussia, with its capital at Königsberg and then, when it became the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701, Berlin, decisively shaped the history of Germany.

The name &quot;Prussia&quot; derives from the Old Prussians; in the 13th century, the Teutonic Knightsan organized Catholic medieval military order of German crusadersconquered the lands inhabited by them. In 1308, the Teutonic Knights conquered the region of Pomerelia with Danzig. Their monastic state was mostly Germanised through immigration from central and western Germany, and, in the south, it was Polonised by settlers from Masovia. The imposed Second Peace of Thorn (1466) split Prussia into the western Royal Prussia, becoming a province of Poland, and the eastern part, called the Duchy of Prussia from 1525, a feudal fief of the Crown of Poland up to 1657. The union of Brandenburg and the Duchy of Prussia in 1618 led to the proclamation of the Kingdom of Prussia in 1701.

Prussia entered the ranks of the great powers shortly after becoming a kingdom. It became increasingly large and powerful in the 18th and 19th centuries. It had a major voice in European affairs under the reign of Frederick the Great (1740–1786). At the Congress of Vienna (1814–15), which redrew the map of Europe following Napoleon&#x27;s defeat, Prussia acquired rich new territories, including the coal-rich Ruhr. The country then grew rapidly in influence economically and politically, and became the core of the North German Confederation in 1867, and then of the German Empire in 1871. The Kingdom of Prussia was now so large and so dominant in the new Germany that and other Prussian élites identified more and more as Germans and less as Prussians.

The Kingdom ended in 1918 along with other German monarchies that were terminated by the German Revolution. In the Weimar Republic, the Free State of Prussia lost nearly all of its legal and political importance following the 1932 coup led by Franz von Papen. Subsequently, it was effectively dismantled into Nazi German &quot;Gaue&quot; in 1935. Nevertheless, some Prussian ministries were kept and Hermann Göring remained in his role as Minister President of Prussia until the end of World War II. Former eastern territories of Germany that made up a significant part of Prussia lost the majority of their German population after 1945 as the Polish People&#x27;s Republic and the Soviet Union both absorbed these territories and had most of its German inhabitants expelled by 1950. Prussia, deemed &quot;a bearer of militarism and reaction&quot; by the Allies, was officially abolished by an Allied declaration in 1947. The international status of the former eastern territories of the Kingdom of Prussia was disputed until the Treaty on the Final Settlement with Respect to Germany in 1990, but its return to Germany remains a cause among far-right politicians, the Federation of Expellees and various political revanchists and irredentists.

The terms &quot;Prussian&quot; and &quot;Prussianism&quot; have often been used, especially outside Germany, to denote the militarism, military professionalism, aggressiveness, and conservatism of the class of landed aristocrats in the East who dominated first Prussia and then the German Empire.

==Symbols==
The main coat of arms of Prussia, as well as the flag of Prussia, depicted a black eagle on a white background.

The black and white national colours were already used by the Teutonic Knights and by the Hohenzollern dynasty. The Teutonic Order wore a white coat embroidered with a black cross with gold insert and black imperial eagle. The combination of the black and white colours with the white and red Hanseatic colours of the free cities Bremen, Hamburg and Lübeck, as well as of Brandenburg, resulted in the black-white-red commercial flag of the North German Confederation, which became the flag of the German Empire in 1871.

&quot;Suum cuique&quot; (&quot;to each, his own&quot;), the motto of the Order of the Black Eagle created by King Frederick I in 1701, was often associated with the whole of Prussia. The Iron Cross, a military decoration created by King Frederick William III in 1813, was also commonly associated with the country. The region, originally populated by Baltic Old Prussians who were Christianised, became a favoured location for immigration by (later mainly Protestant) Germans (&quot;see &quot;), as well as Poles and Lithuanians along the border regions.

==Territory==
Before its abolition, the territory of the Free State of Prussia included the provinces of East Prussia; Brandenburg; Saxony (including much of the present-day state of Saxony-Anhalt and parts of the state of Thuringia in Germany); Pomerania; Rhineland; Westphalia; Silesia (without Austrian Silesia); Schleswig-Holstein; Hanover; Hesse-Nassau; and a small detached area in the south called Hohenzollern, the ancestral home of the Prussian ruling family. The land that the Teutonic Knights occupied was flat and covered with fertile soil. The area was perfectly suited to the large-scale raising of wheat. The rise of early Prussia was based on the raising and selling of wheat. Teutonic Prussia became known as the &quot;bread basket of Western Europe&quot; (in German, &quot;Kornkammer&quot;, or granary). The port cities which rose on the back of this wheat production included: Stettin in Pomerania (now Szczecin, Poland); Danzig in Prussia (now Gdańsk, Poland); Riga in Livonia (now Riga, Latvia); Königsberg in Prussia (now Kaliningrad, Russia); and Memel in Prussia (now Klaipėda, Lithuania). Wheat production and trade brought Prussia into a close relationship with the Hanseatic League during the period of time from 1356 (official founding of the Hanseatic League) until the decline of the League in about 1500.

The expansion of Prussia based on its connection with the Hanseatic League cut both Poland and Lithuania off from the coast of the Baltic Sea and trade abroad. This meant that Poland and Lithuania would be traditional enemies of Prussia, which was still called the Teutonic Knights.

==History==
===Teutonic Order===


In 1211, King Andrew II of Hungary granted Burzenland in Transylvania as a fiefdom to the Teutonic Knights, a German military order of crusading knights, headquartered in the Kingdom of Jerusalem at Acre. In 1225 he expelled them, and they transferred their operations to the Baltic Sea area. Konrad I, the Polish Duke of Masovia, had unsuccessfully attempted to conquer pagan Prussia in crusades in 1219 and 1222. In 1226 Duke Konrad invited the Teutonic Knights to conquer the Baltic Prussian tribes on his borders.

During 60 years of struggles against the Old Prussians, the Order established an independent state that came to control Prūsa. After the Livonian Brothers of the Sword joined the Teutonic Order in 1237, the Order also controlled Livonia (now Latvia and Estonia). Around 1252 they finished the conquest of the northernmost Prussian tribe of the Skalvians as well as of the western Baltic Curonians, and erected Memel Castle, which developed into the major port city of Memel. The Treaty of Melno defined the final border between Prussia and the adjoining Grand Duchy of Lithuania in 1422.

The Hanseatic League officially formed in northern Europe in 1356 as a group of trading cities. This League came to hold a monopoly on all trade leaving the interior of Europe and Scandinavia and on all sailing trade in the Baltic Sea for foreign countries.

In the course of the (German eastward expansion) process, settlers were invited by German-speaking episcopal and secular authorities, bringing changes in the ethnic composition as well as in language, culture, and law of the eastern borders of the German lands. As a majority of these settlers were Germans, Low German became the dominant language.

The Knights of the Teutonic Order were subordinate to the papacy and to the Holy Roman Emperor. Their initially close relationship with the Polish Crown deteriorated after they conquered Polish-controlled Pomerelia and Danzig in 1308. Eventually, Poland and Lithuania, allied through the Union of Krewo (1385), defeated the Knights in the Battle of Grunwald (Tannenberg) in 1410.

The Thirteen Years&#x27; War (1454–1466) began when the Prussian Confederation, a coalition of Hanseatic cities of western Prussia, rebelled against the Order and requested help from the Polish king, Casimir IV Jagiellon. The Teutonic Knights were forced to acknowledge the sovereignty of, and to pay tribute to Casimir IV in the Second Peace of Thorn (1466), losing western Prussia (Royal Prussia) to Poland in the process. Pursuant to the Second Peace of Thorn, two Prussian states were established.

During the period of the monastic state of the Teutonic Knights, mercenaries from the Holy Roman Empire were granted lands by the Order and gradually formed a new landed Prussian nobility, from which the Junkers would evolve to take a major role in the militarization of Prussia and, later, Germany.

===Duchy of Prussia===

On 10 April 1525, after signing of the Treaty of Kraków, which officially ended the Polish–Teutonic War (1519–21), in the main square of the Polish capital Kraków, Albert I resigned his position as Grand Master of the Teutonic Order and received the title &quot;Duke of Prussia&quot; from King Zygmunt I the Old of Poland. As a symbol of vassalage, Albert received a standard with the Prussian coat of arms from the Polish king. The black Prussian eagle on the flag was augmented with a letter &quot;S&quot; (for Sigismundus) and had a crown placed around its neck as a symbol of submission to Poland. Albert I, a member of a cadet branch of the House of Hohenzollern became a Lutheran Protestant and secularized the Order&#x27;s Prussian territories. This was the area east of the mouth of the Vistula river, later sometimes called &quot;Prussia proper&quot;. For the first time, these lands came into the hands of a branch of the Hohenzollern family, who already ruled the Margraviate of Brandenburg, since the 15th century. Furthermore, with his renunciation of the Order, Albert could now marry and produce legitimate heirs.

===Brandenburg-Prussia===
Brandenburg and Prussia united two generations later. In 1594 Duchess Anna of Prussia, granddaughter of Albert I and daughter of Albert Frederick, Duke of Prussia (reigned 1568–1618), married her cousin Elector John Sigismund of Brandenburg. When Albert Frederick died in 1618 without male heirs, John Sigismund was granted the right of succession to the Duchy of Prussia, then still a Polish fief. From this time the Duchy of Prussia was in personal union with the Margraviate of Brandenburg. The resulting state, known as Brandenburg-Prussia, consisted of geographically disconnected territories in Prussia, Brandenburg, and the Rhineland lands of Cleves and Mark.

During the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648), various armies repeatedly marched across the disconnected Hohenzollern lands, especially the occupying Swedes. The ineffective and militarily weak Elector George William (1619–1640) fled from Berlin to Königsberg, the historic capital of the Duchy of Prussia, in 1637. His successor, Frederick William I (1640–1688), reformed the army to defend the lands.

Frederick William I went to Warsaw in 1641 to render homage to King Władysław IV Vasa of Poland for the Duchy of Prussia, which was still held in fief from the Polish crown. In January 1656, during the first phase of the Second Northern War (1654–1660), he received the duchy as a fief from the Swedish king who later granted him full sovereignty in the Treaty of Labiau (November 1656). In 1657 the Polish king renewed this grant in the treaties of Wehlau and Bromberg. With Prussia, the Brandenburg Hohenzollern dynasty now held a territory free of any feudal obligations, which constituted the basis for their later elevation to kings.

Frederick William I succeeded in organizing the electorate by establishing an absolute monarchy in Brandenburg-Prussia, an achievement for which he became known as the &quot;Great Elector&quot;. Above all, he emphasised the importance of a powerful military to protect the state&#x27;s disconnected territories, while the Edict of Potsdam (1685) opened Brandenburg-Prussia for the immigration of Protestant refugees (especially Huguenots), and he established a bureaucracy to carry out state administration efficiently.

===Kingdom of Prussia===

On 18 January 1701, Frederick William&#x27;s son, Elector Frederick III, elevated Prussia from a duchy to a kingdom and crowned himself King Frederick I. In the Crown Treaty of 16 November 1700, Leopold I, emperor of the Holy Roman Empire, allowed Frederick only to title himself &quot;King in Prussia&quot;, not &quot;King of Prussia&quot;. The state of Brandenburg-Prussia became commonly known as &quot;Prussia&quot;, although most of its territory, in Brandenburg, Pomerania, and western Germany, lay outside Prussia proper. The Prussian state grew in splendour during the reign of Frederick I, who sponsored the arts at the expense of the treasury.

Frederick I was succeeded by his son, Frederick William I (1713–1740), the austere &quot;Soldier King&quot;, who did not care for the arts but was thrifty and practical. He was the main creator of the vaunted Prussian bureaucracy and the professionalised standing army, which he developed into one of the most powerful in Europe. His troops only briefly saw action during the Great Northern War. In view of the size of the army in relation to the total population, Mirabeau said later: &quot;Prussia, is not a state with an army, but an army with a state.&quot; Frederick William also settled more than 20,000 Protestant refugees from Salzburg in thinly populated East Prussia, which was eventually extended to the west bank of the Neman river, and other regions. In the Treaty of Stockholm (1720), he acquired half of Swedish Pomerania.

Frederick William I died in 1740 and was succeeded by his son, Frederick II, whose accomplishments led to his reputation as &quot;Frederick the Great&quot;. As crown prince, Frederick had focused, primarily, on philosophy and the arts. He was an accomplished flute player and composer. In 1740, Prussian troops crossed over the undefended border of Silesia and rapidly conquered the region. Silesia was the richest province of Habsburg Austria. It signalled the beginning of three Silesian Wars (1740–1763). The First Silesian War (1740–1742) and the Second Silesian War (1744–1745) have, historically, been grouped together with the general European war called the War of the Austrian Succession (1740–1748). Holy Roman Emperor Charles VI had died on 20 October 1740. He was succeeded to the throne by his daughter, Maria Theresa.

By defeating the Austrian Army at the Battle of Mollwitz on 10 April 1741, Frederick succeeded in conquering Lower Silesia (the northwestern half of Silesia). In the next year, 1742, he conquered Upper Silesia (the southeastern half). Furthermore, in the Third Silesian War (part of the Seven Years&#x27; War) Frederick won a victory over Austria at the Battle of Lobositz on 1 October 1756. In spite of some victories afterward, his situation became far less comfortable the following years, as he failed in his attempts to knock Austria out of the war and was gradually reduced to a desperate defensive war. However, he never gave up and on 3 November 1760 the Prussian king won another battle, the hard-fought Battle of Torgau. Despite being several times on the verge of defeat Frederick, allied with Great Britain, Hanover and Hesse-Kassel, was finally able to hold the whole of Silesia against a coalition of Saxony, the Habsburg monarchy, France and Russia. Voltaire, a close friend of the king, once described Frederick the Great&#x27;s Prussia by saying &quot;...it was Sparta in the morning, Athens in the afternoon.&quot;

Silesia, full of rich soils and prosperous manufacturing towns, became a vital region to Prussia, greatly increasing the nation&#x27;s area, population, and wealth. Success on the battleground against Austria and other powers proved Prussia&#x27;s status as one of the great powers of Europe. The Silesian Wars began more than a century of rivalry and conflict between Prussia and Austria as the two most powerful states operating within the Holy Roman Empire (although both had extensive territory outside the empire). In 1744, the County of East Frisia fell to Prussia following the extinction of its ruling Cirksena dynasty.

In the last 23 years of his reign until 1786, Frederick II, who understood himself as the &quot;first servant of the state&quot;, promoted the development of Prussian areas such as the Oderbruch. At the same time he built up Prussia&#x27;s military power and participated in the First Partition of Poland with Austria and Russia in 1772, an act that geographically connected the Brandenburg territories with those of Prussia proper. The partition also added Polish Royal Prussia to the kingdom, allowing Frederick to re-style himself King &quot;of&quot; Prussia. During this period, he also opened Prussia&#x27;s borders to immigrants fleeing from religious persecution in other parts of Europe, such as the Huguenots. Prussia became a safe haven in much the same way that the United States welcomed immigrants seeking freedom in the 19th century.

Frederick the Great (reigned 1740–1786) practised enlightened absolutism. He built the world&#x27;s best army, and usually won his many wars. He introduced a general civil code, abolished torture and established the principle that the Crown would not interfere in matters of justice. He also promoted an advanced secondary education, the forerunner of today&#x27;s German gymnasium (grammar school) system, which prepares the brightest pupils for university studies. The Prussian education system was emulated in various countries, including the United States.

====Napoleonic Wars====

During the reign of King Frederick William II (1786–1797), Prussia annexed additional Polish territory through the Second Partition of Poland in 1793 and the Third Partition of Poland in 1795. His successor, Frederick William III (1797–1840), announced the union of the Prussian Lutheran and Reformed churches into one church.

Prussia took a leading part in the French Revolutionary Wars, but remained quiet for more than a decade because of the Peace of Basel of 1795, only to go once more to war with France in 1806 as negotiations with that country over the allocation of the spheres of influence in Germany failed. Prussia suffered a devastating defeat against Napoleon&#x27;s troops in the Battle of Jena-Auerstedt, leading Frederick William III and his family to flee temporarily to Memel. Under the Treaties of Tilsit in 1807, the state lost about one-third of its area, including the areas gained from the second and third Partitions of Poland, which now fell to the Duchy of Warsaw. Beyond that, the king was obliged to pay a large indemnity, to cap his army at 42,000 men, and to let the French garrison troops throughout Prussia, effectively making the kingdom a French satellite.

In response to this defeat, reformers such as Stein and Hardenberg set about modernising the Prussian state. Among their reforms were the liberation of peasants from serfdom, the Emancipation of Jews and making full citizens of them. The school system was rearranged, and in 1818 free trade was introduced. The process of army reform ended in 1813 with the introduction of compulsory military service for men. By 1813, Prussia could mobilize almost 300,000 soldiers, more than half of which were conscripts of the &quot;Landwehr&quot; of variable quality. The rest consisted of regular soldiers that were deemed excellent by most observers, and very determined to repair the humiliation of 1806.

After the defeat of Napoleon in Russia, Prussia quit its alliance with France and took part in the Sixth Coalition during the &quot;Wars of Liberation&quot; (&quot;Befreiungskriege&quot;) against the French occupation. Prussian troops under Marshal Gebhard Leberecht von Blücher contributed crucially (alongside the British and Dutch) to the final victory over Napoleon at the Battle of Waterloo of June 1815. Prussia&#x27;s reward in 1815 at the Congress of Vienna was the recovery of her lost territories, as well as the whole of the Rhineland, Westphalia, 40% of Saxony and some other territories. These western lands were of vital importance because they included the Ruhr region, the centre of Germany&#x27;s fledgling industrialisation, especially in the arms industry. These territorial gains also meant the doubling of Prussia&#x27;s population. In exchange, Prussia withdrew from areas of central Poland to allow the creation of Congress Poland under Russian sovereignty. In 1815 Prussia became part of the German Confederation.

====Wars of liberation====

The first half of the 19th century saw a prolonged struggle in Germany between liberals, who wanted a united, federal Germany under a democratic constitution, and conservatives, who wanted to maintain Germany as a patchwork of independent, monarchical states with Prussia and Austria competing for influence. One small movement that signalled a desire for German unification in this period was the Burschenschaft student movement, by students who encouraged the use of the black-red-gold flag, discussions of a unified German nation, and a progressive, liberal political system. Because of Prussia&#x27;s size and economic importance, smaller states began to join its free trade area in the 1820s. Prussia benefited greatly from the creation in 1834 of the German Customs Union (Zollverein), which included most German states but excluded Austria.

In 1848, the liberals saw an opportunity when revolutions broke out across Europe. Alarmed, King Frederick William IV agreed to convene a National Assembly and grant a constitution. When the Frankfurt Parliament offered Frederick William the crown of a united Germany, he refused on the grounds that he would not accept a crown from a revolutionary assembly without the sanction of Germany&#x27;s other monarchs.

The Frankfurt Parliament was forced to dissolve in 1849, and Frederick William issued a constitution by his own authority in 1850. This conservative document provided for a two-house parliament, the Landtag of Prussia. The lower house, or &quot;Prussian House of Representatives&quot; was elected by all males over the age of 25. They were divided into three classes whose votes were weighted according to the amount of taxes paid. In one typical election, the first class (with those who paid the most in taxes) included 4% of voters and the third class (with those who paid the least) had 82%, yet each group chose the same number of electors. The system but assured dominance by the more well-to-do men of the population. The upper house, the &quot;Prussian House of Lords&quot;, was appointed by the king. He retained full executive authority, and ministers were responsible only to him. As a result, the grip of the landowning classes, the Junkers, remained unbroken, especially in the eastern provinces. The constitution nevertheless contained a number of liberal elements such as the introduction of jury courts and a catalog of fundamental rights that included freedom of religion, speech and the press.

====Wars of unification====
In 1862, King Wilhelm I appointed Otto von Bismarck as Minister President of Prussia. Bismarck was determined to defeat both the liberals and conservatives and increase Prussian supremacy and influence among the German states. There has been much debate as to whether Bismarck actually planned to create a united Germany when he set out on this journey, or whether he simply took advantage of the circumstances that fell into place. Bismarck curried support from large sections of the people by promising to lead the fight for greater German unification. He successfully guided Prussia through three wars, which unified Germany and brought William the position of German Emperor.

=====Schleswig Wars=====
The Kingdom of Denmark was at the time in personal union with the Duchies of Schleswig and Holstein, both of which had close ties with each other, although only Holstein was part of the German Confederation. When the Danish government tried to integrate Schleswig, but not Holstein, into the Danish state, Prussia led the German Confederation against Denmark in the First War of Schleswig (1848–1851). Because Russia supported Austria, Prussia also conceded predominance in the German Confederation to Austria in the Punctation of Olmütz in 1850, resulting in a return to the status quo.

In 1863, Denmark introduced a shared constitution for Denmark and Schleswig. This led to conflict with the German Confederation, which authorised the occupation of Holstein by the Confederation, from which Danish forces withdrew. In 1864, Prussian and Austrian forces crossed the border between Holstein and Schleswig initiating the Second War of Schleswig. The Austro-Prussian forces defeated the Danes, who surrendered both territories. In the resulting Gastein Convention of 1865 Prussia took over the administration of Schleswig while Austria assumed that of Holstein.

=====Austro-Prussian War=====

Bismarck realised that the dual administration of Schleswig and Holstein was only a temporary solution, and tensions rose between Prussia and Austria. The struggle for supremacy in Germany then led to the Austro-Prussian War (1866), triggered by the dispute over Schleswig and Holstein, with Bismarck using proposed injustices as the reason for war.

On the Austrian side stood the south German states (including Bavaria and Württemberg), some central German states (including Saxony), and Hanover in the north. On the side of Prussia were Italy, most north German states, and some smaller central German states. Eventually, the better-armed Prussian troops won the crucial victory at the Battle of Königgrätz under Helmuth von Moltke the Elder. The century-long struggle between Berlin and Vienna for the dominance of Germany was now over. As a sideshow in this war, Prussia defeated Hanover in the Battle of Langensalza (1866). While Hanover hoped in vain for help from Britain (as they had previously been in personal union), Britain stayed out of a confrontation with a continental great power and Prussia satisfied its desire for merging the once separate territories and gaining strong economic and strategic power, particularly from the full access to the resources of the Ruhr.

Bismarck desired Austria as an ally in the future, and so he declined to annex any Austrian territory. But in the Peace of Prague in 1866, Prussia annexed four of Austria&#x27;s allies in northern and central GermanyHanover, Hesse-Kassel, Nassau and Frankfurt. Prussia also won full control of Schleswig-Holstein. As a result of these territorial gains, Prussia now stretched uninterrupted across the northern two-thirds of Germany and contained two-thirds of Germany&#x27;s population. The German Confederation was dissolved, and Prussia impelled the 21 states north of the Main river into forming the North German Confederation.

Prussia was the dominant state in the new confederation, as the kingdom comprised almost four-fifths of the new state&#x27;s territory and population. Prussia&#x27;s near-total control over the confederation was secured in the constitution drafted for it by Bismarck in 1867. Executive power was held by a president, assisted by a chancellor responsible only to him. The presidency was a hereditary office of the Hohenzollern rulers of Prussia. There was also a two-house parliament. The lower house, or &quot;Reichstag&quot; (Diet), was elected by universal male suffrage. The upper house, or &quot;Bundesrat&quot; (Federal Council) was appointed by the state governments. The Bundesrat was, in practice, the stronger chamber. Prussia had 17 of 43 votes, and could easily control proceedings through alliances with the other states.

As a result of the peace negotiations, the states south of the Main remained theoretically independent, but received the (compulsory) protection of Prussia. Additionally, mutual defence treaties were concluded. However, the existence of these treaties was kept secret until Bismarck made them public in 1867 when France tried to acquire Luxembourg.

=====Franco-Prussian War=====

The controversy with the Second French Empire over the candidacy of Leopold, Prince of Hohenzollern to the Spanish throne was escalated both by France and Bismarck. With his Ems Dispatch, Bismarck took advantage of an incident in which the French ambassador had approached William. The government of Napoleon III, expecting another civil war among the German states, declared war against Prussia, continuing Franco-German enmity. However, honouring their treaties, the German states joined forces and quickly defeated France in the Franco-Prussian War in 1870. Following victory under Bismarck&#x27;s and Prussia&#x27;s leadership, Baden, Württemberg and Bavaria, which had remained outside the North German Confederation, accepted incorporation into a united German Empire.

The empire was a &quot;Lesser German&quot; solution (in German, &quot;kleindeutsche Lösung&quot;) to the question of uniting all German-speaking peoples into one state, because it excluded Austria, which remained connected to Hungary and whose territories included non-German populations. On 18 January 1871 (the 170th anniversary of the coronation of King Frederick I), William was proclaimed &quot;German Emperor&quot; (not &quot;Emperor of Germany&quot;) in the Hall of Mirrors at Versailles outside Paris, while the French capital was still under siege.

====German Empire====
The two decades after the unification of Germany were the peak of Prussia&#x27;s fortunes, but the seeds for potential strife were built into the Prusso-German political system.

The Constitution of the German Empire was a version of the North German Confederation&#x27;s constitution. Officially, the German Empire was a federal state. In practice, Prussia overshadowed the rest of the empire. Prussia included three-fifths of the German territory and two-thirds of its population. The Imperial German Army was, in practice, an enlarged Prussian army, although the other kingdoms (Bavaria, Saxony and Württemberg) retained their own small armies, coming under Imperial control in wartime. The imperial crown was a hereditary office of the House of Hohenzollern, the royal house of Prussia. The Minister President of Prussia was, except for two brief periods (January–November 1873 and 1892–94), also imperial chancellor. But the empire itself had no right to collect taxes directly from its subjects; the only incomes fully under federal control were the customs duties, common excise duties, and the revenue from postal and telegraph services. While all men above age 25 were eligible to vote in imperial elections, Prussia retained its restrictive three-class voting system. This effectively required the king/emperor and prime minister/chancellor to seek majorities from legislatures elected by two different franchises. In both the kingdom and the empire, the original constituencies were never redrawn to reflect changes in population, meaning that rural areas were grossly overrepresented by the turn of the 20th century.

As a result, Prussia and the German Empire were something of a paradox. Bismarck knew that his new German Empire was now a colossus and economically and militarily dominant in Europe; Britain was still dominant in finance, trade and at sea. He declared Germany a &quot;satisfied&quot; power, using his talents to preserve peace, for example at the Congress of Berlin. Bismarck did not set up his own party. He had mixed success in some of his domestic policies. His anti-Catholic &quot;Kulturkampf&quot; inside Prussia (and not the wider German state) was a failure. He ended his support for the anticlerical Liberals and worked instead with the Catholic Centre Party. He tried to destroy the socialist movement, with limited success. The large Polish population resisted Germanisation.

Frederick III became emperor in March 1888, after the death of his father, but he died of cancer only 99 days later. At age 29, Wilhelm became Kaiser Wilhelm II after a difficult youth and conflicts with his British mother Victoria, Princess Royal. He turned out to be a man of limited experience, narrow and reactionary views, poor judgment, and occasional bad temper, which alienated former friends and allies.

===Railways===

Prussia nationalised its railways in the 1880s in an effort both to lower rates on freight service and to equalise those rates among shippers. Instead of lowering rates as far as possible, the government ran the railways as a profit-making endeavour, and the railway profits became a major source of revenue for the state. The nationalisation of the railways slowed the economic development of Prussia because the state favoured the relatively backward agricultural areas in its railway building. Moreover, the railway surpluses substituted for the development of an adequate tax system.

===The Free State of Prussia in the Weimar Republic===

Because of the German Revolution of 1918, Wilhelm II abdicated as German Emperor and King of Prussia. Prussia was proclaimed a &quot;Free State&quot; (i.e. a republic, German: &quot;Freistaat&quot;) within the new Weimar Republic and in 1920 received a democratic constitution.

Almost all of Germany&#x27;s territorial losses, specified in the Treaty of Versailles, were areas that had been part of Prussia: Eupen and Malmedy to Belgium; North Schleswig to Denmark; the Memel Territory to Lithuania; the Hultschin area to Czechoslovakia. Many of the areas Prussia annexed in the partitions of Poland, such as the provinces of Posen and West Prussia, as well as eastern Upper Silesia, went to the Second Polish Republic. Danzig became the Free City of Danzig under the administration of the League of Nations. Also, the Saargebiet was created mainly from formerly Prussian territories, except present Saarpfalz district, which was part of the Kingdom of Bavaria. East Prussia became an exclave, only reachable by ship. (the Sea Service East Prussia) or by a railway through the Polish corridor.

The German government seriously considered breaking up Prussia into smaller states, but eventually traditionalist sentiment prevailed and Prussia became by far the largest state of the Weimar Republic, comprising 60% of its territory. With the abolition of the older Prussian franchise, it became a stronghold of the left. Its incorporation of &quot;Red Berlin&quot; and the industrialised Ruhr Area, both with working-class majorities, ensured left-wing dominance.

From 1919 to 1932, Prussia was governed by a coalition of the Social Democrats, Catholic Centre and German Democrats; from 1921 to 1925, coalition governments included the German People&#x27;s Party. Unlike in other states of the German Reich, majority rule by democratic parties in Prussia was never endangered. Nevertheless, in East Prussia and some rural areas, the Nazi Party of Adolf Hitler gained more and more influence and popular support, especially from the lower middle class starting in 1930. Except for Catholic Upper Silesia, the Nazi Party in 1932 became the largest party in most parts of the Free State of Prussia. However, the democratic parties in coalition remained a majority, while Communists and Nazis were in the opposition.

The East Prussian Otto Braun, who was Prussian minister-president almost continuously from 1920 to 1932, is considered one of the most capable Social Democrats in history. He implemented several trend-setting reforms together with his minister of the interior, Carl Severing, which were also models for the later Federal Republic of Germany. For instance, a Prussian minister-president could be forced out of office only if there was a &quot;positive majority&quot; for a potential successor. This concept, known as the constructive vote of no confidence, was carried over into the Basic Law for the Federal Republic of Germany. Most historians regard the Prussian government during this time as far more successful than that of Germany as a whole.

In contrast to its pre-war authoritarianism, Prussia was a pillar of democracy in the Weimar Republic. This system was destroyed by the &quot;Preußenschlag&quot; (&quot;Prussian coup&quot;) of Reich Chancellor Franz von Papen. In this coup d&#x27;état, the government of the Reich deposed the Prussian government on 20 July 1932, under the pretext that the latter had lost control of public order in Prussia (during the Bloody Sunday of Altona, Hamburg, which was still part of Prussia at that time) and by using fabricated evidence that the Social Democrats and the Communists were planning a joint &quot;putsch&quot;. The Defence Minister General Kurt von Schleicher, who was the prime mover behind the coup, manufactured evidence that the Prussian police under Braun&#x27;s orders were favouring the Communist &quot;Rotfrontkämpferbund&quot; in street clashes with the SA as part of an alleged plan to foment a Marxist revolution, which he used to get an emergency decree from President Paul von Hindenburg imposing &quot;Reich&quot; control on Prussia. Papen appointed himself Reich commissioner for Prussia and took control of the government. The &quot;Preußenschlag&quot; made it easier, only half a year later, for Hitler to take power decisively in Germany, since he had the whole apparatus of the Prussian government, including the police, at his disposal.

===Prussia and the Third Reich===

After the appointment of Hitler as the new chancellor, the Nazis used the absence of Franz von Papen as an opportunity to appoint Hermann Göring federal commissioner for the Prussian ministry of the interior. The Reichstag election of 5 March 1933 strengthened the position of the National Socialist German Workers&#x27; Party (NSDAP or &quot;Nazi&quot; Party), although they did not achieve an absolute majority.

The Reichstag building having been set on fire a few weeks earlier on 27 February, a new Reichstag was opened in the Garrison Church of Potsdam on 21 March 1933 in the presence of President Paul von Hindenburg. In a propaganda-filled meeting between Hitler and the Nazi Party, the &quot;marriage of old Prussia with young Germany&quot; was celebrated, to win over the Prussian monarchists, conservatives and nationalists and induce them into supporting and subsequently voting in favor of the Enabling Act of 1933.

In the centralised state created by the Nazis in the &quot;Law on the Reconstruction of the Reich&quot; (&quot;Gesetz über den Neuaufbau des Reichs&quot;, 30 January 1934) and the &quot;Law on Reich Governors&quot; (&quot;Reichsstatthaltergesetz&quot;, 30 January 1935) the states were dissolved, in fact if not in law. The state &quot;landtage&quot; were abolished and the state governments were now controlled by &quot;Reichsstatthaltern&quot; (Reich Governors) who were appointed by the chancellor. Parallel to that, the organisation of the party into districts (&quot;Gaue&quot;) gained increasing importance, as the official in charge of a &quot;Gau&quot; (the head of which was called a &quot;Gauleiter&quot;) was again appointed by the chancellor who was at the same time chief of the Nazi Party.

This centralising policy went even further in Prussia. From 1934 to 1945, almost all ministries were merged and only a few departments were able to maintain their independence. Hitler himself became formally the governor of Prussia. However, his functions were exercised by Hermann Göring as Prussian prime minister.

As provided for in the &quot;Greater Hamburg Act&quot; (&quot;Groß-Hamburg-Gesetz&quot;), certain exchanges of territory took place. Prussia was extended on 1 April 1937, for instance, by the incorporation of the Free and Hanseatic City of Lübeck.

The Prussian lands transferred to Poland after the Treaty of Versailles were re-annexed during World War II. However, most of this territory was not reintegrated back into Prussia but assigned to separate &quot;Gaue&quot; of Danzig-West Prussia and Wartheland during much of the duration of the war.

===The end of Prussia===


The areas east of the Oder–Neisse line, mainly Eastern Prussia, Western Prussia, Pomerania and Silesia, were annexed by Poland and the Soviet Union in 1945 owing to the Treaty of Potsdam between three of the Allies: the United States, United Kingdom, and the Soviet Union. This included important Prussian cities like Danzig, Königsberg, Breslau, and Stettin. The population fled, mostly to the Western zones, or was driven out.

As part of their wartime goals, the Western allies sought the abolition of Prussia. Stalin was initially content to retain the name, Russians having a different historical view of their neighbour and sometime former ally. Nonetheless, by Law No. 46, which was accepted and implemented by the Allied Control Council on 25 February 1947, Prussia was officially proclaimed to be dissolved.

In the Soviet occupation zone, which became East Germany (officially, the German Democratic Republic) in 1949, the former Prussian territories were reorganised into the states of Brandenburg and Saxony-Anhalt, with the remaining parts of the Province of Pomerania going to Mecklenburg-Western Pomerania. These states were &quot;de facto&quot; abolished in 1952 in favour of &quot;Bezirke&quot; (districts), but were recreated shortly before German reunification in 1990.

In the Western Zones of occupation, which became West Germany (officially, the Federal Republic of Germany) in 1949, the former Prussian territories were divided up among North Rhine-Westphalia, Lower Saxony, Hesse, Rhineland-Palatinate and Schleswig-Holstein. Württemberg-Baden and Württemberg-Hohenzollern were later merged with Baden to create the state of Baden-Württemberg. The Saar region, which had been administered by the French as a protectorate separate from the rest of Western Germany, was admitted to the Federal Republic of Germany as a separate state following the 1955 Saar Statute referendum.

One year later, in 1957, the Prussian Cultural Heritage Foundation was established and implemented by federal statutes in West Germany in response to a ruling from the Federal Constitutional Court of Germany. The fundamental goal of this institution is protecting the cultural legacy of Prussia. As of 2021, it continues to operate from its headquarters in Berlin.

==Administrative and constitutional frameworks==
In the mid-16th century, the margraves of Brandenburg had become highly dependent on the estates (representing counts, lords, knights, and towns, but not prelates, owing to the Protestant Reformation in 1538). The margraviate&#x27;s liabilities and tax income as well as the margrave&#x27;s finances were in the hands of the &quot;Kreditwerk&quot;, an institution not controlled by the elector, and of the &quot;Großer Ausschuß&quot; (Great Committee) of the estates. This was because of concessions made by Elector Joachim II in 1541 in return for financial aid by the estates; however, the &quot;Kreditwerk&quot; went bankrupt between 1618 and 1625. The margraves further had to yield to the veto of the estates in all issues concerning the &quot;better or worse of the country&quot;, in all legal commitments, and in all issues concerning pawn or sale of the elector&#x27;s real property.

To reduce the influence of the estates, in 1604, Joachim Frederick created a council called &quot;Geheimer Rat für die Kurmark&quot; (Privy Council for the Electorate), which instead of the estates would function as the supreme advisory council for the elector. While the council was permanently established in 1613, it failed to gain any influence until 1651, owing to the Thirty Years&#x27; War (1618–1648)

Until after the Thirty Years&#x27; War, the various territories of Brandenburg-Prussia remained politically independent from each other, connected only by the common feudal superior. Frederick William (ruled 1640–1688), who envisioned the transformation of the personal union into a real union, started to centralise the Brandenburg-Prussian government with an attempt to establish the &quot;Geheimer Rat&quot; as a central authority for all territories in 1651, but this project proved unfeasible. Instead, the elector continued to appoint a governor (&quot;Kurfürstlicher Rat&quot;) for each territory, who in most cases was a member of the &quot;Geheimer Rat&quot;. The most powerful institution in the territories remained the governments of the estates (&quot;Landständische Regierung&quot;, named &quot;Oberratsstube&quot; in Prussia and &quot;Geheime Landesregierung&quot; in Mark and Cleves), which were the highest government agencies regarding jurisdiction, finances and administration. The elector attempted to balance the estates&#x27; governments by creating &quot;Amtskammer&quot; chambers to administer and coordinate the elector&#x27;s domains, tax income and privileges. Such chambers were introduced in Brandenburg in 1652, in Cleves and Mark in 1653, in Pomerania in 1654, in Prussia in 1661 and in Magdeburg in 1680. Also in 1680, the &quot;Kreditwerk&quot; came under the aegis of the elector.

Frederick William I&#x27;s excise tax (&quot;Akzise&quot;), which from 1667 replaced the property tax raised in Brandenburg for Brandenburg-Prussia&#x27;s standing army with the estates&#x27; consent, was raised by the elector without consultation with the estates. The conclusion of the Second Northern War of 1655–1660 had strengthened the elector politically, enabling him to reform the constitution of Cleves and Mark in 1660 and 1661 to introduce officials loyal to him and independent of the local estates. In the Duchy of Prussia he confirmed the traditional privileges of the Prussian estates in 1663, but the latter accepted the caveat that these privileges were not to be used to interfere with the exertion of the elector&#x27;s sovereignty. As in Brandenburg, Frederick William ignored the privilege of the Prussian estates to confirm or veto taxes raised by the elector: while in 1656, an &quot;Akzise&quot; was raised with the estates&#x27; consent, the elector by force collected taxes not approved by the Prussian estates for the first time in 1674. From 1704 the Prussian estates &quot;de facto&quot; relinquished their right to approve the elector&#x27;s taxes while formally still entitled to do so. In 1682 the elector introduced an &quot;Akzise&quot; to Pomerania and in 1688 to Magdeburg, while in Cleves and Mark an &quot;Akzise&quot; was introduced only between 1716 and 1720. Owing to Frederick William I&#x27;s reforms, the state income increased threefold during his reign, and the tax burden per subject reached a level twice as high as in France.

Under the rule of Frederick III (I) (reign: 1688–1713), the Brandenburg Prussian territories were &quot;de facto&quot; reduced to provinces of the monarchy. Frederick William&#x27;s testament would have divided Brandenburg-Prussia among his sons, but his firstborn son Frederick III (I), with the emperor&#x27;s backing, succeeded in becoming the sole ruler based on the House Treaty of Gera of 1599, which forbade a division of Hohenzollern territories. In 1689, a new central chamber for all Brandenburg-Prussian territories was established, called &quot;Geheime Hofkammer&quot; (from 1713: &quot;Generalfinanzdirektorium&quot;). This chamber functioned as a superior agency of the territories&#x27; &quot;Amtskammer&quot; chambers. The General War Commissariat (&quot;Generalkriegskommissariat&quot;) emerged as a second central agency, superior to the local &quot;Kriegskommissariat&quot; agencies initially concerned with the administration of the army, but before 1712 transformed into an agency also concerned with general tax and police tasks.

The Kingdom of Prussia functioned as an absolute monarchy until the German revolutions of 1848–1849, after which Prussia became a constitutional monarchy and King Frederick William IV appointed Adolf Heinrich von Arnim-Boitzenburg Prussia&#x27;s first prime minister (&quot;Ministerpräsident&quot;). Prussia&#x27;s first constitution dated from 1848, but was only briefly in effect as it had been forced on the king. The 1850 Prussian Constitution established a two-chamber parliament. The lower house, the Prussian House of Representatives represented all taxpayers, who were divided into three classes according to the amount of taxes paid. This assured dominance by the more well-to-do elements of the population. The upper house (First Chamber or &quot;Erste Kammer&quot;), later renamed the Prussian House of Lords (&quot;Herrenhaus&quot;), was appointed by the king. He retained full executive authority and ministers were responsible only to him. As a result, the grip of the landowning classes, the Junkers, remained unbroken, especially in the eastern provinces. The Prussian Secret Police, formed in response to the German revolutions of 1848–1849, aided the conservative government.

=== Prussia inside Weimar Republic ===
Unlike its authoritarian pre-1918 predecessor, Prussia from 1918 to 1932 was a promising democracy within Germany. The abolition of the political power of the aristocracy transformed Prussia into a region strongly dominated by the left wing of the political spectrum, with &quot;Red Berlin&quot; and the industrial centre of the Ruhr Area exerting major influence. During this period a coalition of centre-left parties ruled, predominantly under the leadership (1920–1932) of East Prussian Social Democrat Otto Braun. While in office Braun implemented several reforms (together with his Minister of the Interior, Carl Severing) that became models for the later Federal Republic of Germany. For instance, a Prussian prime minister could only be forced out of office if there was a &quot;positive majority&quot; for a potential successor. This concept, known as the constructive vote of no confidence, became part of the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany. Historians regard the Prussian government during the 1920s as far more successful than that of Germany as a whole.

Similar to other German states both now and at the time, executive power remained vested in a Minister-President of Prussia and in laws established by a Landtag elected by the people.

==Social history==
===Population===

In 1871, Prussia&#x27;s population numbered 24.69 million, accounting for 60% of the German Empire&#x27;s population. The population grew rapidly from 45 million in 1880 to 56 million in 1900, thanks to declining mortality, even as birth rates declined. About 6 million Germans, primarily young families, migrated to the United States, especially the mid-western farming regions. Their place in agriculture was often taken by young Polish farm workers. In addition, large numbers of Polish miners moved to Upper Silesia and many Germans and Poles moved to industrial jobs in the fast-growing cities especially in the Rhineland and Westphalia. In 1910, the population had increased to 40.17 million (62% of the Empire&#x27;s population). In 1914, Prussia had an area of 354,490 km2. In May 1939, Prussia had an area of 297,007 km2 and a population of 41,915,040 inhabitants.

=== Ethnicity ===
Apart from ethnic Germans the country was inhabited also by ethnolinguistic minorities such as Poles (including Kashubs in West Prussia and Mazurs in East Prussia), Prussian Lithuanians (in East Prussia), Sorbs (in Lusatia), Czechs and Moravians (in Silesia), Danes (in Schleswig), Jews, Frisians, Dutch, Walloons, Russians (in Wojnowo), French, Italians, Hungarians and others.

===Religion===
The Duchy of Prussia was the first state to officially adopt Lutheranism in 1525. In the wake of the Reformation, Prussia was dominated by two major Protestant confessions: Lutheranism and Calvinism. The majority of the Prussian population was Lutheran, although there were dispersed Calvinist minorities in central and western parts of the state especially Brandenburg, Rhineland, Westphalia and Hesse-Nassau. In 1613, John Sigismund, Elector of Brandenburg and Grand Duke of Prussia declared himself for the Calvinist creed and transferred the Berlin Cathedral from the Lutheran to the Calvinist church. Lutherans and Calvinist congregations all over the kingdom were merged in 1817 by the Prussian Union of churches, which came under tight royal control. In Protestant regions, writes Nipperdey:
Prussia received significant Huguenot population after the issuing of the Edict of Fontainebleau by Louis XIV of France and the following dragonnades. Prussian monarchs, beginning with Frederick William, Elector of Brandenburg opened the country to the fleeing French Calvinist refugees. In Berlin, they built and worshipped at their own church called the French Cathedral on Gendarmenmarkt. Time passed by, and the French Reformed assimilated into the wider Protestant community in Prussia. East Prussia&#x27;s southern region of Masuria was mostly made up of Germanised Lutheran Masurians.

After 1814, Prussia contained millions of Catholics in the west and in the east. There were substantial populations in the Rhineland, parts of Westphalia, eastern parts of Silesia, West Prussia, Ermland and the Province of Posen. Communities in Poland were often ethnically Polish, although this is not the case of eastern Silesia as the majority of Catholics there were German. During the 19th-century Kulturkampf, Prussian Catholics were forbidden from fulfilling any official functions for the state and were largely distrusted.

Prussia contained a relatively large Jewish community, which was mostly concentrated in large urban areas. According to the 1880 census, it was the biggest one in Germany with 363,790 individuals.

In 1925, 64.9% of the Prussian population was Protestant, 31.3% was Catholic, 1.1% was Jewish, 2.7% was placed in other religious categories.

===Non-German population===

In 1871, approximately 2.4 million Poles lived in Prussia, constituting the largest minority. Other minorities were Jews, Danes, Frisians, Dutchmen, Kashubians (72,500 in 1905), Masurians (248,000 in 1905), Lithuanians (101,500 in 1905), Walloons, Czechs, Kursenieki, and Sorbs.

The area of Greater Poland, where the Polish nation had originated, became the Province of Posen after the Partitions of Poland. Poles in this Polish-majority province (62% Polish, 38% German) resisted German rule. Also, the southeast portion of Silesia (Upper Silesia) had a Polish majority. But Catholics and Jews did not have equal status with Protestants.

As a result of the Treaty of Versailles in 1919, the Second Polish Republic was granted not only these two areas, but also areas with a German majority in the province of West Prussia. After World War II, East Prussia, most of Pomerania and Silesia, and the eastern part of Brandenburg were either annexed by the Soviet Union or given to Poland, and the German-speaking populations forcibly expelled.

===Education===
The German states in the 19th century were world leaders in prestigious education and Prussia set the pace. For boys free public education was widely available, and the gymnasium system for elite students was highly professionalized. The modern university system emerged from the 19th century German universities, especially Friedrich Wilhelm University (now named Humboldt University of Berlin). It pioneered the model of the research university with well-defined career tracks for professors. The United States, for example, paid close attention to German models. Families focused on educating their sons. The traditional schooling for girls was generally provided by mothers and governesses. Elite families increasingly favoured Catholic convent boarding schools for their daughters. Prussia&#x27;s Kulturkampf laws in the 1870s limited Catholic schools thus providing an opening for a large number of new private schools for girls.

== Continuation of Prussian traditions ==

The German states on the former territory of the Free State of Prussia are successor states to Prussia in legal terms, particularly in terms of constitutional and international law. For example, the state of North Rhine-Westphalia is bound to the concordat that the Free State of Prussia concluded with the Holy See.

Despite its dissolution in 1947, many aspects of Prussia have been preserved to this day in everyday life, in culture, in sport and even in names.

=== Federal government ===
* In the federal government according to the prevailing view, the Federal Republic of Germany as a subject of international law is identical to the federal state initiated and dominated by Prussia, which was founded in 1867 under the name of the North German Confederation and expanded into the German Empire in 1871.
* Prussia&#x27;s capital Berlin also became the capital of the newly founded empire in 1871. The capital city resolution of 1991, which designated Berlin as the federal capital of the reunified Germany, the &quot;Berlin Republic&quot;, stands in this tradition. Several federal institutions use buildings from former Prussian institutions, for example the Bundesrat uses the Prussian House of Lords building. The Federal President has his first official residence in Bellevue Palace, the first classical building in Prussia. As the central shield of the Reich coat of arms, the Prussian state coat of arms is depicted in the gable above the main entrance to the Reichstag building.
* The constructive vote of no confidence anchored in the Basic Law of the Federal Republic of Germany, which only allows the head of government to be voted out if a new successor is simultaneously elected, is directly based on a constitutional regulation of the Free State of Prussia.
* The Prussian war award of the Iron Cross is, in a modified form, the symbol of the Bundeswehr.
* In the tradition of the 1st Guards Regiment on Foot, which was introduced in 1806 as the personal regiment of the King of Prussia, the guard battalion at the Federal Ministry of Defense has followed.
* As part of state visits, the presentation march of Friedrich Wilhelm III is a regular part of the federal diplomatic protocol at the reception with military honors and the marching down the front of the guard battalion&#x27;s honor formation at the Federal Ministry of Defense is played.
* The Bundeswehr&#x27;s Great Tattoo, played particularly when bidding farewell to Federal Presidents, Chancellors, Federal Defense Ministers and senior military officers, is largely composed of traditional elements of Prussian military music.
* The police star, the emblem of the Federal Police and the Feldjäger of the Bundeswehr, is derived from the Prussian Guard Star, which went back to the eight-pointed breast star of the Black Eagle Order. The guard star can also be found on the bell trees of the Bundeswehr music corps.
* In 2002, the then Brandenburg Social Minister Alwin Ziel suggested naming the planned new federal state of Berlin-Brandenburg &quot;Prussia&quot;.

=== Within Germany ===
* The state coat of arms of Saxony-Anhalt shows, among other things the Prussian eagle.
* The large coat of arms of Baden-Württemberg contains the house coat of arms of the Hohenzollerns.
*The Prussian government and administration model was decisive for a large number of political institutions at the state level and is still expressed today in terms such as Minister-president, Regierungsbezirk and Landrat. Today&#x27;s North Rhine-Westphalia regional associations go back to the Prussian provincial associations.
* The Rhineland Regional Association in North Rhine-Westphalia - in continuation of the tradition of the Rhine Province and its provincial association - also has the Prussian eagle in the upper part of its association coat of arms.
* The states on the former territory of the Free State of Prussia are successor states to Prussia in legal terms, particularly in terms of constitutional and international law. North Rhine-Westphalia, the largest successor state to Prussia, maintains its Prussian history and remembrance culture in the form of the Prussian Museums in Wesel and Minden.

=== In churches ===
* The Union of Evangelical Churches emerged from the Evangelical Church of the Union, a church association of the Old Prussian Protestant regional churches, i.e. H. of the churches whose area already belonged to Prussia before 1866

<text>Wartburgkreis is a &quot;Kreis&quot; (district) in the west of Thuringia, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the north clockwise) the districts Unstrut-Hainich-Kreis, Gotha, Schmalkalden-Meiningen, and the districts Fulda, Hersfeld-Rotenburg and Werra-Meißner-Kreis in Hesse. The district has 30 municipalities, including Eisenach.

==History==
The district was created in 1994 by merging the previous districts Eisenach and Bad Salzungen, and a few municipalities from the district Bad Langensalza. The city Eisenach left the district in 1998 and became a district-free city and was incorporated into the district again on 1 July 2021. The municipality Kaltennordheim passed from the Wartburgkreis to Schmalkalden-Meiningen on 1 January 2019.

The district is named after the Wartburg, a castle near Eisenach most famous as the place of residence of Ludwig, Landgrave of Thuringia and his wife, Saint Elizabeth of Hungary; and, as Martin Luther&#x27;s refuge in 1521.
==Geography==
The district is located in the Thuringian Forest, including the Hainich national park. The main river in the district is the Werra.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms combines the symbols of the historic states which existed on the territory. In the top left and the bottom right is the lion of the dukes of Thuringia, the fowl in the top right refers to the county Henneberg, and the black cross in the bottom left is the symbol of the imperial abbey and state of Fulda.

<doc id="371255" wikidata="Q6008560" url="?curid=371255" title="Sliding mode control">
<text>In control systems, sliding mode control (SMC) is a nonlinear control method that alters the dynamics of a nonlinear system by applying a discontinuous control signal (or more rigorously, a set-valued control signal) that forces the system to &quot;slide&quot; along a cross-section of the system&#x27;s normal behavior. The state-feedback control law is not a continuous function of time. Instead, it can switch from one continuous structure to another based on the current position in the state space. Hence, sliding mode control is a variable structure control method. The multiple control structures are designed so that trajectories always move toward an adjacent region with a different control structure, and so the ultimate trajectory will not exist entirely within one control structure. Instead, it will &quot;slide&quot; along the boundaries of the control structures. The motion of the system as it slides along these boundaries is called a &quot;sliding mode&quot; and the geometrical locus consisting of the boundaries is called the &quot;sliding (hyper)surface&quot;. In the context of modern control theory, any variable structure system, like a system under SMC, may be viewed as a special case of a hybrid dynamical system as the system both flows through a continuous state space but also moves through different discrete control modes.

==Introduction==
Figure 1 shows an example trajectory of a system under sliding mode control. The sliding surface is described by formula_1, and the sliding mode along the surface commences after the finite time when system trajectories have reached the surface. In the theoretical description of sliding modes, the system stays confined to the sliding surface and need only be viewed as sliding along the surface. However, real implementations of sliding mode control approximate this theoretical behavior with a high-frequency and generally non-deterministic switching control signal that causes the system to &quot;chatter&quot; in a tight neighborhood of the sliding surface. Chattering can be reduced through the use of deadbands or boundary layers around the sliding surface, or other compensatory methods. Although the system is nonlinear in general, the idealized (i.e., non-chattering) behavior of the system in Figure 1 when confined to the formula_1 surface is an LTI system with an exponentially stable origin.
One of the compensatory methods is the adaptive sliding mode control method proposed in 

 which uses estimated uncertainty to construct continuous control law. In this method chattering is eliminated while preserving accuracy (for more details see references [2] and [3]). The three distinguished features of the proposed adaptive sliding mode controller are as follows: (i) The structured (or parametric) uncertainties and unstructured uncertainties (un-modeled dynamics, unknown external disturbances) are synthesized into a single type uncertainty term called lumped uncertainty. Therefore, a linearly parameterized dynamic model of the system is not required, and the simple structure and computationally efficient properties of this approach make it suitable for the real-time control applications. (ii) The adaptive sliding mode control scheme design relies on the online estimated uncertainty vector rather than relying on the worst-case scenario (i.e., bounds of uncertainties). Therefore, a-priory knowledge of the bounds of uncertainties is not required, and at each time instant, the control input compensates for the uncertainty that exists. (iii) The developed continuous control law using fundamentals of the sliding mode control theory eliminates the chattering phenomena without trade-off between performance and robustness, which is prevalent in boundary-layer approach.

Intuitively, sliding mode control uses practically infinite gain to force the trajectories of a dynamic system to slide along the restricted sliding mode subspace. Trajectories from this reduced-order sliding mode have desirable properties (e.g., the system naturally slides along it until it comes to rest at a desired equilibrium). The main strength of sliding mode control is its robustness. Because the control can be as simple as a switching between two states (e.g., &quot;on&quot;/&quot;off&quot; or &quot;forward&quot;/&quot;reverse&quot;), it need not be precise and will not be sensitive to parameter variations that enter into the control channel. Additionally, because the control law is not a continuous function, the sliding mode can be reached in &quot;finite&quot; time (i.e., better than asymptotic behavior). Under certain common conditions, optimality requires the use of bang–bang control; hence, sliding mode control describes the optimal controller for a broad set of dynamic systems.

One application of sliding mode controller is the control of electric drives operated by switching power converters. Because of the discontinuous operating mode of those converters, a discontinuous sliding mode controller is a natural implementation choice over continuous controllers that may need to be applied by means of pulse-width modulation or a similar technique of applying a continuous signal to an output that can only take discrete states. Sliding mode control has many applications in robotics. In particular, this control algorithm has been used for tracking control of unmanned surface vessels in simulated rough seas with high degree of success.

Sliding mode control must be applied with more care than other forms of nonlinear control that have more moderate control action. In particular, because actuators have delays and other imperfections, the hard sliding-mode-control action can lead to chatter, energy loss, plant damage, and excitation of unmodeled dynamics. Continuous control design methods are not as susceptible to these problems and can be made to mimic sliding-mode controllers.

==Control scheme==
Consider a nonlinear dynamical system described by
where
:formula_3
is an -dimensional state vector and
:formula_4
is an -dimensional input vector that will be used for state feedback. The functions formula_5 and formula_6 are assumed to be continuous and sufficiently smooth so that the Picard–Lindelöf theorem can be used to guarantee that solution formula_7 to Equation () exists and is unique.

A common task is to design a state-feedback control law formula_8 (i.e., a mapping from current state formula_7 at time to the input formula_10) to stabilize the dynamical system in Equation () around the origin formula_11. That is, under the control law, whenever the system is started away from the origin, it will return to it. For example, the component formula_12 of the state vector formula_13 may represent the difference some output is away from a known signal (e.g., a desirable sinusoidal signal); if the control formula_10 can ensure that formula_12 quickly returns to formula_16, then the output will track the desired sinusoid. In sliding-mode control, the designer knows that the system behaves desirably (e.g., it has a stable equilibrium) provided that it is constrained to a subspace of its configuration space. Sliding mode control forces the system trajectories into this subspace and then holds them there so that they slide along it. This reduced-order subspace is referred to as a &quot;sliding (hyper)surface&quot;, and when closed-loop feedback forces trajectories to slide along it, it is referred to as a &quot;sliding mode&quot; of the closed-loop system. Trajectories along this subspace can be likened to trajectories along eigenvectors (i.e., modes) of LTI systems; however, the sliding mode is enforced by creasing the vector field with high-gain feedback. Like a marble rolling along a crack, trajectories are confined to the sliding mode.

The sliding-mode control scheme involves
# Selection of a hypersurface or a manifold (i.e., the sliding surface) such that the system trajectory exhibits desirable behavior when confined to this manifold.
# Finding feedback gains so that the system trajectory intersects and stays on the manifold.
Because sliding mode control laws are not continuous, it has the ability to drive trajectories to the sliding mode in finite time (i.e., stability of the sliding surface is better than asymptotic). However, once the trajectories reach the sliding surface, the system takes on the character of the sliding mode (e.g., the origin formula_17 may only have asymptotic stability on this surface).

The sliding-mode designer picks a &quot;switching function&quot; formula_18 that represents a kind of &quot;distance&quot; that the states formula_13 are away from a sliding surface.
* A state formula_13 that is outside of this sliding surface has formula_21.
* A state that is on this sliding surface has formula_22.
The sliding-mode-control law switches from one state to another based on the &quot;sign&quot; of this distance. So the sliding-mode control acts like a stiff pressure always pushing in the direction of the sliding mode where formula_22.
Desirable formula_7 trajectories will approach the sliding surface, and because the control law is not continuous (i.e., it switches from one state to another as trajectories move across this surface), the surface is reached in finite time. Once a trajectory reaches the surface, it will slide along it and may, for example, move toward the formula_25 origin. So the switching function is like a topographic map with a contour of constant height along which trajectories are forced to move.

The sliding (hyper)surface/manifold is typically of dimension formula_26 where is the number of states in formula_13 and is the number of input signals (i.e., control signals) in formula_10. For each control index formula_29, there is an formula_30-dimensional sliding surface given by

The vital part of SMC design is to choose a control law so that the sliding mode (i.e., this surface given by formula_31) exists and is reachable along system trajectories. The principle of sliding mode control is to forcibly constrain the system, by suitable control strategy, to stay on the sliding surface on which the system will exhibit desirable features. When the system is constrained by the sliding control to stay on the sliding surface, the system dynamics are governed by reduced-order system obtained from Equation ().

To force the system states formula_13 to satisfy formula_33, one must:
# Ensure that the system is capable of reaching formula_33 from any initial condition
# Having reached formula_31, the control action is capable of maintaining the system at formula_31

Note that because the control law is not continuous, it is certainly not locally Lipschitz continuous, and so existence and uniqueness of solutions to the closed-loop system is &quot;not&quot; guaranteed by the Picard–Lindelöf theorem. Thus the solutions are to be understood in the Filippov sense. Roughly speaking, the resulting closed-loop system moving along formula_33 is approximated by the smooth dynamics formula_38 however, this smooth behavior may not be truly realizable. Similarly, high-speed pulse-width modulation or delta-sigma modulation produces outputs that only assume two states, but the effective output swings through a continuous range of motion. These complications can be avoided by using a different nonlinear control design method that produces a continuous controller. In some cases, sliding-mode control designs can be approximated by other continuous control designs.

==Theoretical foundation==
The following theorems form the foundation of variable structure control.

===Theorem 1: Existence of sliding mode===
Consider a Lyapunov function candidate

where formula_39 is the Euclidean norm (i.e., formula_40 is the distance away from the sliding manifold where formula_31). For the system given by Equation () and the sliding surface given by Equation (), a sufficient condition for the existence of a sliding mode is that
:formula_42
in a neighborhood of the surface given by formula_43.

Roughly speaking (i.e., for the scalar control case when formula_44), to achieve formula_45, the feedback control law formula_46 is picked so that formula_47 and formula_48 have opposite signs. That is,
* formula_49 makes formula_50 negative when formula_51 is positive.
* formula_49 makes formula_50 positive when formula_51 is negative.
Note that
:formula_55
and so the feedback control law formula_56 has a direct impact on formula_48.

====Reachability: Attaining sliding manifold in finite time====
To ensure that the sliding mode formula_31 is attained in finite time, formula_59 must be more strongly bounded away from zero. That is, if it vanishes too quickly, the attraction to the sliding mode will only be asymptotic. To ensure that the sliding mode is entered in finite time,
:formula_60
where formula_61 and formula_62 are constants.

===== Explanation by comparison lemma =====
This condition ensures that for the neighborhood of the sliding mode formula_63,
:formula_64
So, for formula_65,
:formula_66
which, by the chain rule (i.e., formula_67 with formula_68), means
:formula_69
where formula_70 is the upper right-hand derivative of formula_71 and the symbol formula_72 denotes proportionality. So, by comparison to the curve formula_73 which is represented by differential equation formula_74 with initial condition formula_75, it must be the case that formula_76 for all . Moreover, because formula_77, formula_78 must reach formula_79 in finite time, which means that must reach formula_80 (i.e., the system enters the sliding mode) in finite time. Because formula_78 is proportional to the Euclidean norm formula_82 of the switching function formula_47, this result implies that the rate of approach to the sliding mode must be firmly bounded away from zero.

===== Consequences for sliding mode control =====
In the context of sliding mode control, this condition means that
:formula_84
where formula_39 is the Euclidean norm. For the case when switching function formula_47 is scalar valued, the sufficient condition becomes
:formula_87.
Taking formula_88, the scalar sufficient condition becomes
:formula_89
which is equivalent to the condition that
:formula_90.
That is, the system should always be moving toward the switching surface formula_91, and its speed formula_92 toward the switching surface should have a non-zero lower bound. So, even though formula_47 may become vanishingly small as formula_13 approaches the formula_31 surface, formula_48 must always be bounded firmly away from zero. To ensure this condition, sliding mode controllers are discontinuous across the formula_91 manifold; they &quot;switch&quot; from one non-zero value to another as trajectories cross the manifold.

===Theorem 2: Region of attraction===
For the system given by Equation () and sliding surface given by Equation (), the subspace for which the formula_98 surface is reachable is given by
:formula_99
That is, when initial conditions come entirely from this space, the Lyapunov function candidate formula_100 is a Lyapunov function and formula_13 trajectories are sure to move toward the sliding mode surface where formula_102. Moreover, if the reachability conditions from Theorem 1 are satisfied, the sliding mode will enter the region where formula_103 is more strongly bounded away from zero in finite time. Hence, the sliding mode formula_91 will be attained in finite time.

===Theorem 3: Sliding motion===
Let
:formula_105
be nonsingular. That is, the system has a kind of controllability that ensures that there is always a control that can move a trajectory to move closer to the sliding mode. Then, once the sliding mode where formula_106 is achieved, the system will stay on that sliding mode. Along sliding mode trajectories, formula_51 is constant, and so sliding mode trajectories are described by the differential equation
:formula_108.
If an formula_13-equilibrium is stable with respect to this differential equation, then the system will slide along the sliding mode surface toward the equilibrium.

The &quot;equivalent control law&quot; on the sliding mode can be found by solving
:formula_110
for the equivalent control law formula_56. That is,
:formula_112
and so the equivalent control
:formula_113
That is, even though the actual control formula_10 is not continuous, the rapid switching across the sliding mode where formula_31 forces the system to &quot;act&quot; as if it were driven by this continuous control.

Likewise, the system trajectories on the sliding mode behave as if
:formula_116
The resulting system matches the sliding mode differential equation
:formula_117
, the sliding mode surface formula_31, and the trajectory conditions from the reaching phase now reduce to the above derived simpler condition. Hence, the system can be assumed to follow the simpler formula_119 condition after some initial transient during the period while the system finds the sliding mode. The same motion is approximately maintained when the equality formula_106 only approximately holds.

It follows from these theorems that the sliding motion is invariant (i.e., insensitive) to sufficiently small disturbances entering the system through the control channel. That is, as long as the control is large enough to ensure that formula_45 and formula_48 is uniformly bounded away from zero, the sliding mode will be maintained as if there was no disturbance. The invariance property of sliding mode control to certain disturbances and model uncertainties is its most attractive feature; it is strongly robust.

As discussed in an example below, a sliding mode control law can keep the constraint
:formula_123
in order to asymptotically stabilize any system of the form
:formula_124
when formula_125 has a finite upper bound. In this case, the sliding mode is where
:formula_126
(i.e., where formula_127). That is, when the system is constrained this way, it behaves like a simple stable linear system, and so it has a globally exponentially stable equilibrium at the formula_128 origin.

==Control design examples==
* Consider a plant described by Equation () with single input (i.e., formula_129). The switching function is &quot;picked&quot; to be the linear combination

:where the weight formula_130 for all formula_131. The sliding surface is the simplex where formula_43. When trajectories are forced to slide along this surface,
::formula_133
:and so
::formula_134
:which is a reduced-order system (i.e., the new system is of order formula_135 because the system is constrained to this formula_30-dimensional sliding mode simplex). This surface may have favorable properties (e.g., when the plant dynamics are forced to slide along this surface, they move toward the origin formula_17). Taking the derivative of the Lyapunov function in Equation (), we have
::formula_138
:To ensure formula_139, the feedback control law formula_49 must be chosen so that
::formula_141
:Hence, the product formula_142 because it is the product of a negative and a positive number. Note that

:The control law formula_49 is chosen so that
::formula_144
:where
:* formula_145 is some control (e.g., possibly extreme, like &quot;on&quot; or &quot;forward&quot;) that ensures Equation () (i.e., formula_48) is &quot;negative&quot; at formula_13
:* formula_148 is some control (e.g., possibly extreme, like &quot;off&quot; or &quot;reverse&quot;) that ensures Equation () (i.e., formula_48) is &quot;positive&quot; at formula_13
:The resulting trajectory should move toward the sliding surface where formula_43. Because real systems have delay, sliding mode trajectories often &quot;chatter&quot; back and forth along this sliding surface (i.e., the true trajectory may not smoothly follow formula_43, but it will always return to the sliding mode after leaving it).

* Consider the dynamic system
::formula_153
:which can be expressed in a 2-dimensional state space (with formula_154 and formula_155) as
::formula_156
:Also assume that formula_157 (i.e., formula_158 has a finite upper bound that is known). For this system, choose the switching function
::formula_159
:By the previous example, we must choose the feedback control law formula_160 so that formula_142. Here,
::formula_162
:* When formula_163 (i.e., when formula_164), to make formula_165, the control law should be picked so that formula_166
:* When formula_167 (i.e., when formula_168), to make formula_169, the control law should be picked so that formula_170
:However, by the triangle inequality,
::formula_171
:and by the assumption about formula_158,
::formula_173
:So the system can be feedback stabilized (to return to the sliding mode) by means of the control law
::formula_174
:which can be expressed in closed form as
::formula_175
:Assuming that the system trajectories are forced to move so that formula_43, then
::formula_177
:So once the system reaches the sliding mode, the system&#x27;s 2-dimensional dynamics behave like this 1-dimensional system, which has a globally exponentially stable equilibrium at formula_128.

===Automated design solutions===
Although various theories exist for sliding mode control system design, there is a lack of a highly effective design methodology due to practical difficulties encountered in analytical and numerical methods. A reusable computing paradigm such as a genetic algorithm can, however, be utilized to transform a &#x27;unsolvable problem&#x27; of optimal design into a practically solvable &#x27;non-deterministic polynomial problem&#x27;. This results in computer-automated designs for sliding model control.

==Sliding mode observer==
Sliding mode control can be used in the design of state observers. These non-linear high-gain observers have the ability to bring coordinates of the estimator error dynamics to zero in finite time. Additionally, switched-mode observers have attractive measurement noise resilience that is similar to a Kalman filter. For simplicity, the example here uses a traditional sliding mode modification of a Luenberger observer for an LTI system. In these sliding mode observers, the order of the observer dynamics are reduced by one when the system enters the sliding mode. In this particular example, the estimator error for a single estimated state is brought to zero in finite time, and after that time the other estimator errors decay exponentially to zero. However, as first described by Drakunov, a sliding mode observer for non-linear systems can be built that brings the estimation error for all estimated states to zero in a finite (and arbitrarily small) time.

Here, consider the LTI system
:formula_179
where state vector formula_180, formula_181 is a vector of inputs, and output is a scalar equal to the first state of the formula_13 state vector. Let
:formula_183
where
* formula_184 is a scalar representing the influence of the first state formula_12 on itself,
* formula_186 is a row vector corresponding to the influence of the first state on the other states,
* formula_187 is a matrix representing the influence of the other states on themselves, and
* formula_188 is a column vector representing the influence of the other states on the first state.

The goal is to design a high-gain state observer that estimates the state vector formula_13 using only information from the measurement formula_190. Hence, let the vector formula_191 be the estimates of the states. The observer takes the form
:formula_192
where formula_193 is a nonlinear function of the error between estimated state formula_194 and the output formula_190, and formula_196 is an observer gain vector that serves a similar purpose as in the typical linear Luenberger observer. Likewise, let
:formula_197
where formula_198 is a column vector. Additionally, let formula_199 be the state estimator error. That is, formula_200. The error dynamics are then
:formula_201
where formula_202 is the estimator error for the first state estimate. The nonlinear control law can be designed to enforce the sliding manifold
:formula_203
so that estimate formula_194 tracks the real state formula_12 after some finite time (i.e., formula_206). Hence, the sliding mode control switching function
:formula_207
To attain the sliding manifold, formula_48 and formula_47 must always have opposite signs (i.e., formula_142 for essentially all formula_13). However,
:formula_212
where formula_213 is the collection of the estimator errors for all of the unmeasured states. To ensure that formula_142, let
:formula_215
where
:formula_216
That is, positive constant must be greater than a scaled version of the maximum possible estimator errors for the system (i.e., the initial errors, which are assumed to be bounded so that can be picked large enough; al). If is sufficiently large, it can be assumed that the system achieves formula_217 (i.e., formula_206). Because formula_219 is constant (i.e., 0) along this manifold, formula_220 as well. Hence, the discontinuous control formula_221 may be replaced with the equivalent continuous control formula_222 where
:formula_223
So
:formula_224
This equivalent control formula_222 represents the contribution from the other formula_30 states to the trajectory of the output state formula_12. In particular, the row formula_228 acts like an output vector for the error subsystem
:formula_229
So, to ensure the estimator error formula_230 for the unmeasured states converges to zero, the formula_231 vector formula_232 must be chosen so that the formula_233 matrix formula_234 is Hurwitz (i.e., the real part of each of its eigenvalues must be negative). Hence, provided that it is observable, this formula_230 system can be stabilized in exactly the same way as a typical linear state observer when formula_228 is viewed as the output matrix (i.e., &quot;&quot;). That is, the formula_222 equivalent control provides measurement information about the unmeasured states that can continually move their estimates asymptotically closer to them. Meanwhile, the discontinuous control formula_238 forces the estimate of the measured state to have zero error in finite time. Additionally, white zero-mean symmetric measurement noise (e.g., Gaussian noise) only affects the switching frequency of the control , and hence the noise will have little effect on the equivalent sliding mode control formula_222. Hence, the sliding mode observer has Kalman filter–like features.

The final version of the observer is thus
:formula_240
where
* formula_241
* formula_242 and
* formula_243
That is, by augmenting the control vector formula_10 with the switching function formula_245, the sliding mode observer can be implemented as an LTI system. That is, the discontinuous signal formula_245 is viewed as a control &quot;input&quot; to the 2-input LTI system.

For simplicity, this example assumes that the sliding mode observer has access to a measurement of a single state (i.e., output formula_190). However, a similar procedure can be used to design a sliding mode observer for a vector of weighted combinations of states (i.e., when output formula_248 uses a generic matrix ). In each case, the sliding mode will be the manifold where the estimated output formula_249 follows the measured output formula_250 with zero error (i.e., the manifold where formula_251).

<text>Khorasan ( ; also transcribed as Khurasan, Xorasan and Khorassan), also called Traxiane during Hellenistic and Parthian times, was a province in northeastern Iran until September 2004, when it was divided into three new provinces: North Khorasan, South Khorasan, and Razavi Khorasan.

Khorasan historically referred to a much larger area, comprising the east and the northeast of the Persian Empire. The name &quot;Khorāsān&quot; is Persian and means &quot;where the sun arrives from&quot;. The name was first given to the eastern province of Persia during the Sasanian Empire and was used from the Late Middle Ages in distinction to neighbouring Transoxiana.

This province, whose people are mainly Shia Muslims, roughly encompassed the western portion of the historical Greater Khorasan. The modern boundaries of the Iranian province of Khorasan were formally defined in the late nineteenth century and the province was divided into three separate administrative divisions in 2004.

==History==
The name &quot;Khorāsān&quot; (lit. &quot;sunrise&quot;; &quot;east&quot;; or &quot;land of the rising sun&quot;) was originally given to the eastern province of Persia during the Sassanian period. The old Iranian province of Khorasan roughly formed the western half of the historical Greater Khorasan, a region which included parts that are today in Iran, Afghanistan, Tajikistan, Turkmenistan and Uzbekistan. Some of the main historical cities of Persia are located in the older Khorasan: Nishapur and Tus (now in Iran); Merv and Sanjan (now in Turkmenistan); Samarkand and Bukhara (both now in Uzbekistan); Herat and Balkh (now in Afghanistan); and Khujand and Panjakent (now in Tajikistan). The term was also used from the Late Middle Ages–especially in post-Mongol (Chagatai and Timurid) times–to distinguish the region from neighbouring Transoxiana. The modern Iranian boundaries of the province of Khorasan were defined and formalised in the late nineteenth century.

In August 1968 and September 1978, the region was the scene of two major earthquakes that left 12,000 and 25,000 people dead, respectively. A third major earthquake, the 1997 Qayen earthquake, took place on 10 May 1997 and left 1,567 dead, 2,300 injured, and 50,000 homeless.

==Modern divisions==
Khorasan was the largest province of Iran until it was divided into three separate provinces in September 2004:

*&quot;North Khorasan&quot;, center: Bojnourd, other counties: Shirvan, Esfarayen, Garmeh and Jajarm, and Maneh and Samalgan
*&quot;South Khorasan&quot;, center: Birjand, other counties: Ferdows, Qaen, Nehbandan, Sarayan, Sarbisheh and Darmian.
*&quot;Razavi Khorasan&quot;, center: Mashhad, other counties: Sabzevar, Neyshabour, Torbat-e-Heydariyeh, Quchan, Torbat-e Jam, Kashmar, Taybad, Gonabad, Dargaz, Sarakhs, Chenaran, Fariman, Khaf, Roshtkhar, Bardaskan, Kalat and Khalilabad.

Some parts of the province were added to
* some southern parts to Sistan and Baluchestan province
* some western parts to Yazd province

==Demographics==
The major ethnic groups in the region are Persians with Khorasani Kurds, Khorasani Turks and Turkmen as the minorities. Smaller minorities are Baloch (Khorasani Baloch), Jews, Mongols, and Roma. Most of the people in the region natively speak closely related modern day dialects of Persian. The region is home to a significant Sunni Muslim minority. The largest cluster of settlements and cultivation stretches around the city of Mashhad northwestward, containing the important towns of Quchan, Shirvan, and Bojnurd.

<doc id="371265" wikidata="Q6496" url="?curid=371265" title="Airbus A400M Atlas">
<text>The Airbus A400M Atlas is a European four-engine turboprop military transport aircraft. It was designed by Airbus Military, now Airbus Defence and Space, as a tactical airlifter with strategic capabilities to replace older transport aircraft such as the Transall C-160 and the Lockheed C-130 Hercules. The A400M is sized between the C-130 and the Boeing C-17 Globemaster III. It can carry heavier loads than the C-130 and can use rough landing strips. In addition to its transport capabilities, the A400M can perform aerial refueling and medical evacuation when fitted with appropriate equipment.

The A400M&#x27;s maiden flight took place on 11 December 2009 from Seville Airport, Spain. Between 2009 and 2010, the A400M faced cancellation as a result of development programme delays and cost overruns; however, the customer nations chose to maintain their support for the project. A total of 174 A400M aircraft had been ordered by eight nations by July 2011. In March 2013, the A400M received European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) certification and the first aircraft was delivered to the French Air Force in August 2013.

==Development==

===Origins===
The project has its origins in the Future International Military Airlifter (FIMA) group, established in 1982 as a joint venture between Aérospatiale, British Aerospace (BAe), Lockheed, and Messerschmitt-Bölkow-Blohm (MBB) with the goal of developing a replacement for both the C-130 Hercules and Transall C-160. Varying requirements and the complications of international politics meant that progress on the initiative was slow. In 1989, Lockheed decided to withdraw from the grouping. Lockheed independently developed an upgraded Hercules, the C-130J Super Hercules. With the addition of Alenia of Italy and CASA of Spain, the FIMA group became Euroflag.

Project management evaluated twin and quad turbofan engine configurations, a quad propfan configuration, and a quad turboprop configuration, eventually settling on the turboprop option. Since no existing turboprop engine in the western world was powerful enough to reach the projected cruise speed of Mach 0.72, a new engine design was required. Originally, the SNECMA M138 turboprop, based on the M88 turbofan core, was selected, but this powerplant was found to be incapable of satisfying the requirements. In April 2002, Airbus Military issued a new request for proposal (RFP), which Pratt &amp; Whitney Canada with the PW180 and Europrop International answered. In May 2003, Airbus Military selected the Europrop TP400-D6. United Technologies alleged that the selection was a result of political interference.

A Europrop partner executive said in April 2003 that Airbus was close to selecting the P&amp;WC offer, claiming it was more than €400 million (US$436.7 million) cheaper than Europrop&#x27;s bid. As the original deadline for the engine decision passed, Airbus CEO Noel Forgeard said P&amp;WC&#x27;s bid was nearly 20 percent less expensive and declared that &quot;As of today Pratt and Whitney is the winner without doubt; a much lower offer could make us change our minds.&quot;, inviting Europrop to revise its offering, which it reportedly reduced in price by 10 or 20 percent. A later report described the revised bid as exceeding P&amp;WC&#x27;s bid by €120 million.
The original partner nations were France, Germany, Italy, Spain, the United Kingdom, Turkey, Belgium, and Luxembourg. These nations decided to charge the Organisation for Joint Armament Cooperation (OCCAR) with the management of the acquisition of the A400M. Following the withdrawal of Italy and revision of procurement totals, the revised requirement amounted to 180 aircraft. The first flight was forecast to occur in 2008 and first delivery in 2009. In April 2005, South Africa joined the programme, with the Denel Saab Aerostructures receiving a contract for fuselage components. Malaysia was the second country outside Europe to be involved. Malaysia through CTRM is responsible for manufacturing composite aero components for the aircraft.

The A400M is positioned as an intermediate size and range between the Lockheed C-130 and the Boeing C-17, carrying cargo too large or too heavy for the C-130, while able to use rough landing strips.

===Delays and problems===
In January 2009, EADS announced that the first delivery was postponed from 2009 until at least 2012, and indicated that it wanted to renegotiate. EADS maintained the first deliveries would begin three years after the first flight. In January 2009, &quot;Financial Times Deutschland&quot; reported that the A400M was overweight by 12 tons and may not have been able to meet a key performance requirement, the ability to airlift 32 tons. Sources told &quot;FTD&quot; that it could only lift 29 tons, insufficient to carry an infantry fighting vehicle like the Puma. In response to the report, the chief of the German Air Force stated: &quot;That is a disastrous development,&quot; and that it could delay deliveries to the German Air Force (&quot;Luftwaffe&quot;) until 2014. The Initial Operational Capability (IOC) for the Luftwaffe was later delayed and alternatives, such as a higher integration of European airlift capabilities, were studied.
On 29 March 2009, Airbus CEO Tom Enders told &quot;Der Spiegel&quot; that the programme could possibly be abandoned without changes. OCCAR reminded participating countries that they could terminate the contract before 31 March 2009. In April 2009, the South African Air Force announced that it was considering alternatives to the A400M due to delays and increased cost. On 5 November 2009, South Africa announced the cancellation of its order . On 12 June, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Germany and France had delayed a decision whether to cancel their orders for six months while the UK planned to decide in late June. The NYT also quoted a report to the French Senate from February 2009, noting: &quot;the A400M is €5 billion over budget, 3 to 4 years behind schedule, [and] aerospace experts estimate it is also costing Airbus between €1 billion and €1.5 billion a year.&quot;

In 2009, Airbus acknowledged that the programme was expected to lose at least €2.4 billion and could not break even without export sales. A PricewaterhouseCoopers audit projected that it would run €11.2 billion over budget, and that corrective measures would result in an overrun of €7.6 billion. On 24 July 2009, the seven European nations announced that the programme would proceed and formed a joint procurement agency to renegotiate the contract. On 9 December 2009, the &quot;Financial Times&quot; reported that Airbus requested an additional €5 billion subsidy. In January 2010, Airbus repeated that the A400M could possibly be scrapped, costing it €5.7 billion unless €5.3 billion was added by partner governments. Delays had already increased its budget by 25%. Airbus executives reportedly regarded the A400M as competing for resources with the A380 and A350 XWB programmes.

In June 2009, Lockheed Martin said that both the UK and France had requested details on the C-130J as an alternative to the A400M.

In November 2010, Belgium, Britain, France, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain and Turkey finalised the contract and agreed to lend Airbus Military €1.5 billion. The programme was then at least three years behind schedule. The UK reduced its order from 25 to 22 aircraft and Germany from 60 to 53, decreasing the total order from 180 to 170.

In 2013, France&#x27;s budget for 50 aircraft was €8.9bn (~US$11.7bn) at a unit cost of €152.4M (~US$200M), or €178M (~US$235M) including development costs. The 2013 French White Paper on Defence and National Security cut the tactical transport aircraft requirement from 70 to 50. As the A400M was unable to perform helicopter in-flight refuelling, France announced in 2016 that it would purchase four C-130Js. In July 2016, French aerospace laboratory ONERA confirmed successful wind tunnel trials of a hose and drogue configuration to permit helicopter refuelling by the A400M. Prior tests found instability in the intended hose due to vortices generated by the spoilers, deployed to achieve 108-130 kt air speed.

In April 2016, production faults affecting 14 propeller gearboxes (PGBs) produced by Italian supplier Avio Aero were discovered. The issue, involving a heat treatment process that weakened the ring gear, affected no other PGBs; the units involved needed changing. Airbus noted: &quot;pending full replacement of the batch, any aircraft can continue to fly with no more than one affected propeller gearbox installed and is subject to continuing inspections.&quot; Another PGB issue involved input pinion plug cracking, which could release small metallic particles into the oil system, which is safeguarded by a magnetic sensor. Only engines 1 and 3, which have propellers that rotate to the right, were affected. The European Aviation Safety Agency (EASA) issued an Airworthiness Directive mandating immediate on-wing inspection, followed by replacement if evidence of damage was found. On 27 April 2016, Airbus warned there may be a substantial PGB repair cost. An interim PGB fix was certified in July 2016, greatly extending inspection intervals.

In May 2016, Airbus confirmed that a cracking behaviour identified during quality control checks in 2011 was found in a French A400M&#x27;s fuselage part. Not impacting safety, it could be repaired during regular maintenance/upgrade schedules. The aluminium-zinc alloy, known as 7000 series, was used in several central frames. Its chemistry, along with environmental conditions, led to crack propagation. The alloy was excluded from future aircraft. A retrofit to remove it from early A400Ms, which could take up to seven months, was considered.

On 29 May 2016, Enders conceded in an interview published in Bild am Sonntag that some of the &quot;massive problems&quot; of the A400M were of Airbus&#x27; own making: &quot;We underestimated the engine problems...Airbus had let itself be persuaded by some well-known European leaders into using an engine made by an inexperienced consortium.&quot; Furthermore, it had assumed full responsibility for the engine. On 27 July 2016, Airbus confirmed that it took a $1 billion charge over delivery issues and export prospects. Enders also stated that &quot;Industrial efficiency and the step-wise introduction of the A400M&#x27;s military functionalities are still lagging behind schedule and remain challenging.&quot;

===Flight testing===
Before the first flight, required airborne test time on the Europrop TP400 engine was achieved using a C-130 testbed aircraft, which first flew on 17 December 2008. On 11 December 2009, the A400M&#x27;s maiden flight was carried out from Seville. In April 2010, the second A400M made its first flight. In July 2010, the third A400M took to the air, at which point the fleet had flown 400 hours over more than 100 flights. In July 2010, the A400M passed ultimate-load testing of the wing. In October 2010, Airbus announced the start of refuelling and air-drop tests. By October 2010, the A400M had flown 672 hours of the 2,700 hours expected to reach certification. In November 2010, the first paratroop jumps were performed. Enders and A400M project manager Bruno Delannoy were among the skydivers.
In late 2010, simulated icing tests were performed on the MSN1 flight test aircraft using devices installed on the wing&#x27;s leading edges. These revealed an aerodynamic issue causing horizontal tail buffeting, resolved via a six-week retrofit to install anti-icing equipment fed with bleed air. Production aircraft are similarly fitted. Winter tests were done in Kiruna, Sweden in February 2011. In March 2012, high-altitude start and landing tests were performed at La Paz at 4,061.5 m (13,325 ft) and Cochabamba at 2,548 m (8,360 feet) in Bolivia.

By April 2011, a total of 1,400 flight hours over 450 flights had been achieved. In May 2011, the TP400-D6 engine received certification from the EASA. In May 2011, the A400M fleet had totaled 1,600 hours over 500 flights. By September 2011, the total increased to 2,100 hours and 684 flights. Due to a gearbox problem, an A400M was shown on static display instead of a flight demonstration at the 2011 Paris Air Show. By October 2011, total flight hours had reached 2,380 over 784 flights.

In May 2012, the MSN2 flight test aircraft was due to spend a week conducting unpaved runway trials on a grass strip at Cottbus-Drewitz Airport in Germany. Testing was cut short on 23 May, when, during a rejected takeoff test, the left side main wheels broke through the runway surface. Airbus Military stated that it found the aircraft&#x27;s behaviour was &quot;excellent&quot;. The undamaged aircraft returned to Toulouse.

At the 2012 Royal International Air Tattoo, the aircraft was officially named &quot;Atlas&quot;

In March 2013, the A400M was granted type certification by the EASA, clearing its entry to service.

===Production and delivery===
Assembly of the first A400M began at the Seville plant of EADS Spain in early 2007. Major assemblies built at other facilities abroad were brought to the Seville facility by Airbus Beluga transporters. In February 2008, four Europrop TP400-D6 flight test engines were delivered for the first A400M. Static structural testing of a test airframe began in March 2008 in Spain. By 2010, Airbus planned to manufacture 30 aircraft per year. The Turkish partner, Turkish Aerospace Industries, delivered the first A400M component to Bremen in 2007.
The first flight, originally scheduled for early 2008, was postponed due to delays and financial pressures. EADS announced in January 2008 that engine issues had been responsible for the delay. The rescheduled first flight, set for July 2008, was again postponed. Civil certification under EASA CS-25 was followed by certification for military uses. In June 2008, the A400M was rolled out in Seville at an event presided by King Juan Carlos I of Spain.

On 12 January 2011, serial production began. In August 2013, the first A400M was delivered to the French Air Force. It was formally handed over during a ceremony in September 2013. In August 2013, the first Turkish A400M conducted its maiden flight from Seville. In March 2015, Malaysia received its first A400M.

In May 2015, it was revealed that the member nations had created a Programme Monitoring Team (PMT) to review and monitor progress in the A400M&#x27;s development and production. The PMT inspects the final assembly line in Seville and other production sites. Early conclusions observed that Airbus lacked an integrated approach to production, development and retrofits, treating these as separate programmes.
On 9 May 2015, an A400M crashed in Seville on its first test flight. Germany, Malaysia, Turkey and UK suspended flights during the investigation. Initial focus centered on whether the crash had been caused by new fuel supply management software for trimming the fuel tanks to enable certain manoeuvres; Airbus issued an update instructing operators to inspect all Engine Control Units (ECUs). A key scenario examined by investigators was that the torque calibration parameter data had accidentally been wiped on three engines during software installation, preventing FADEC operations. On 3 June 2015, Airbus announced that investigators had confirmed &quot;that engines one, two and three experienced power frozen after lift-off and did not respond to the crew&#x27;s attempts to control the power setting in the normal way.&quot;

On 11 June 2015, Spain&#x27;s Ministry of Defence announced that prototypes could restart test flights and that further permits could soon be granted. The RAF lifted its suspension on A400M flights on 16 June 2015, followed the next day by the Turkish Air Force. On 19 June 2015, deliveries restarted. In June 2016, the French Air Force accepted its ninth A400M, the first capable of conducting tactical tasks such as airdropping supplies. The revised standard includes the addition of cockpit armour and defensive aids system equipment, plus clearance to transfer and receive fuel in-flight.

==Design==
The Airbus A400M provides substantial improvements to payload, range, internal volume and operational capacity over the Transall C-160 and Lockheed C-130 that it replaces or augments. It can carry up to over . The cargo box is long excluding ramp, wide, and high (or aft of the wing). and can be configured to transport cargo or military personnel, drop paratroops, conduct medical evacuations or carry out aerial refuelling. It can operate out of short, soft landing strips and fly long-range cargo. A typical cargo load might include six Land Rovers and their trailers, or two light armoured vehicles, or a dump truck and excavator, or a Patriot missile system, or a Puma or Cougar helicopter, or a truck and 25-ton trailer.
The A400M features a fly-by-wire flight control system with sidestick controllers and flight envelope protection. Like other Airbus aircraft, it has a full glass cockpit. Most systems are loosely based on those of the A380, but modified for the military mission. The hydraulic system has dual channels powering the primary and secondary flight-control actuators, landing gear, wheel brakes, cargo door and optional hose-and-drogue refuelling system. As with the A380, there is no third hydraulic system. Instead, there are two electrical systems. One is a set of dual-channel electrically powered hydraulic actuators, the other an array of electrically/hydraulically powered hybrid actuators. The dissimilar redundancy provides more protection against battle damage.

More than 30 percent of the airplane&#x27;s structure is made of composite materials. The span wing is primarily made of carbon fibre reinforced plastic components, including the wing spars, the long, thick wingskins, and other parts. The wing weighs about , and it can carry and lift up to of fuel. It has an aspect ratio of 8.1, a wide chord of , and a sweep angle of 15 degrees at 25 percent mean aerodynamic chord.

The A400M has a T-tail empennage. Its vertical stabilizer is tall. The horizontal stabilizer spans , with a sweep of 32.5 degrees.
The Ratier-Figeac FH385 propellers turn counterclockwise and the FH386 clockwise. The eight-bladed scimitar propellers are made from a woven composite material. The aircraft is powered by four Europrop TP400-D6 engines rated at 8,250 kW (11,000 hp) each. The TP400-D6 engine is the most powerful turboprop engine in the West to enter operational use.
The pair of propellers on each wing turn in opposite directions, with the tips of the propellers advancing from above towards the midpoint between the two engines. This is in contrast to the overwhelming majority of multi-engine propeller driven aircraft where all propellers turn in the same direction. The counter-rotation is achieved by the use of a gearbox fitted to two of the engines, and only the propeller turns in the opposite direction. All four engines are identical and turn in the same direction. This eliminates the need to have two different &quot;handed&quot; engines on stock for the same aircraft, simplifying maintenance and supply costs. This configuration, dubbed &quot;down between engines&quot; (DBE), allows the engine to produce more lift and lessens the torque and prop wash on each wing. It also reduces yaw in the event of an outboard engine failure. Due to these benefits, the vertical stabilizer can be reduced by 17 percent in size, while the size of the horizontal stabilizer can be shrunk by 8 percent.

A forward-looking infrared enhanced vision system (EVS) camera provides an enhanced terrain view in low-visibility conditions. The EVS imagery is displayed on the HUD for low-altitude flying, demonstrating its value for flying tactical missions at night or in clouds. EADS and Thales provide the new Multi-Colour Infrared Alerting Sensor (MIRAS) missile warning sensor for the A400M.

The A400M has a removable refuelling probe mounted above the cockpit, allowing it to receive fuel from drogue-equipped tankers. Optionally, the receiving probe can be replaced with a fuselage-mounted UARRSI receptacle for receiving fuel from boom equipped tankers. The aircraft can act as a tanker when fitted with two wing mounted hose and drogue under-wing refuelling pods or a centre-line Hose and Drum unit. The refuelling pods can transfer fuel to other aircraft at a rate of .

The A400M features deployable baffles in front of the rear side doors, intended to give paratroops time to get clear of the aircraft before they are hit by the slipstream.

==Operational history==

On 29 December 2013, the French Air Force performed the A400M&#x27;s first operational mission: an aircraft flew to Mali in support of Operation Serval.

On 10 September 2015, the RAF was declared the A400M fleet leader in terms of flying hours, with 900 hours flown over 300 sorties, achieved by a fleet of four aircraft. Sqn. Ldr. Glen Willcox of the RAF&#x27;s Heavy Aircraft Test Squadron confirmed that reliability levels were high for an aircraft so early in its career, and that night vision goggle trials, hot and cold soaking, noise characterization tests and the first tie-down schemes for cargo had already been completed. In March 2015, the RAF&#x27;s first operational mission occurred, flying cargo to RAF Akrotiri, Cyprus.

In September and October 2017, A400Ms from France, Germany and the UK participated in disaster relief operations following Hurricane Irma in the Caribbean, delivering a Puma helicopter, food, water and other aid supply, and evacuating stranded people.

In July 2018, the German Luftwaffe used an A400M in combat conditions for the first time, transporting 75 soldiers from Wunstorf Air Base to Mazar-i-Sharif, Afghanistan. German Air Force Inspector Ingo Gerhartz called this a &quot;milestone&quot; because it was the first such mission in an active war zone and showed that the armoring kit was fully functional.

In September 2018, the French Air and Space Force announced that they had logged 10,000 flying hours with their fleet of 14 A400Ms, mostly flying supply missions for Operation Barkhane.

The German government had planned to sell the last 13 A400Ms out of its order of 53 aircraft but failed to attract any buyers. In 2017, the German parliament decided to employ them in service at Wunstorf in northern Germany instead. In January 2019, German Minister of Defence Ursula von der Leyen announced that 10 A400Ms were to be used to form a multinational airlift wing based at Lechfeld Air Base in southern Germany. The plan was abandoned in 2022 due to a lack of interest from potential partner nations.

In 2019, a German A400M tanker replaced the Airbus A310 MRTT deployed to Muwaffaq Salti Air Base in Jordan, to refuel allied aircraft as part of the German intervention against ISIL.

In August 2021, a total of 25 A400Ms were deployed by Belgium, France, Germany, Spain, Turkey and the UK to assist in the Kabul Airport evacuations. German A400Ms evacuated 5,347 people over the course of 35 flights.

In September 2023, Royal Air Force A400M transported British search and rescue teams to Morocco after a Mw 6.9 earthquake had ravaged the country.

In October 2024, the German Air Force tested the A400M&#x27;s &quot;mixed airdrop&quot; capability at Scheuen drop zone at Air Base Celle, combining personnel and cargo drops from 400 meters at 220 km/h in different configurations. Overseen by BAAINBw, the trials built on earlier NATO-standard CDS pallet trials conducted during Grafenwöhr exercises in 2020 and confirmed the A400M&#x27;s ability to deploy up to 4 metric tons of cargo and 108 paratroopers in a single sortie. Final military certification depends on further trials and data analysis, while Airbus certification has been granted.

===Exports===

; Chile: In July 2005, the Chilean Air Force signed a Memorandum of understanding for three aircraft, but no order was placed. Chile began talks on buying the Brazilian Embraer KC-390.
; Czech Republic: In February 2017, the Czech Ministries of Defence stated they were interested in a joint lease of A400Ms from Germany.
; Hungary: In September 2020, Hungary was named the first partner of the Multinational Air Transport Unit to be established at Lechfeld Air Base, with 10 A400Ms contracted to Germany, a plan that was dropped in 2022.
; Indonesia: In January 2017, Indonesia approved the acquisition of five A400Ms to boost Indonesia&#x27;s military airlift capabilities. In March 2017, a letter of intent with Airbus was signed by Pelita Air Services, representing a consortium of Indonesian aviation companies. In March 2018, the Indonesian Air Force and state entity Indonesia Trading Company (ITC) announced they were considering ordering two A400Ms, which would be crewed by the Indonesian Air Force and act in an air freight role helping to balance the prices of goods across the archipelago. The parties were interested in the aircraft&#x27;s ability to operate from rough landing strips, where a normal air freighter could not, as well as the possibility of industrial offsets. In November 2021, Airbus confirmed that the Indonesian Ministry of Defense had signed a deal with Airbus for two A400Ms, with an option, in the form of a letter of intent, for four additional aircraft. In December 2022, Airbus announced that the contract has been finalised, the first delivery is expected in 2026.
; Kazakhstan: In September 2021, Kazakhstan signed an agreement with Airbus to buy two A400Ms for the Kazakh Air Defense Forces. On 5 April 2024, the first aircraft was rolled out at the A400M Final Assembly building in Seville. It was expected to be delivered to Kazakhstan before 2025.
; Malaysia: In December 2005, the Royal Malaysian Air Force ordered four A400Ms to supplement its fleet of C-130 Hercules.
; South Africa: In December 2004, South Africa announced it would purchase eight A400Ms at a cost of approximately €837 million, with the nation joining the Airbus Military team as an industrial partner. Deliveries were expected from 2010 to 2012. In 2009, South Africa cancelled all eight aircraft, citing increasing costs. In November 2011, Airbus Military reached an agreement to refund pre-delivery payments worth €837 million to Armscor.
; South Korea: In February 2019, South Korea&#x27;s Defense Acquisition Program Administration (DAPA) confirmed a proposal from Spain to swap an undetermined number of KAI T-50 Golden Eagles and KAI KT-1 Woongbi trainers for A400M airlifters.

==Accidents==
An A400M crashed on 9 May 2015, when aircraft MSN23, on its first test flight crashed shortly after take-off from San Pablo Airport in Seville, Spain, killing four Spanish Airbus crew and seriously injuring two others. Once airborne, the crew contacted air traffic controllers just before the crash about a technical failure, before colliding with an electricity pylon while attempting an emergency landing. The crash was attributed to the FADEC system being unable to read engine sensors properly due to an accidental file-wipe, resulting in three of its four engines remaining in &quot;idle&quot; mode during takeoff.

<doc id="371266" wikidata="Q3404531" url="?curid=371266" title="Bangor-on-Dee">
<text>Bangor-on-Dee ( or standardised ) is a village and community in Wrexham County Borough, Wales, on the banks of the River Dee. Until 1974 it was in the exclave of Flintshire known as the Maelor Saesneg, and from 1974 to 1996 in the county of Clwyd.

The community had a population of 1,110 at the 2011 Census.

==Etymology==
The anglicised name refers to the village&#x27;s proximity to the River Dee. However, the older Welsh name, &quot;Bangor-is-y-Coed&quot; (or &quot;Bangor Is-Coed&quot;) literally means &quot;Bangor&quot; (a settlement with a wattle enclosure) &quot;below the wood/trees&quot;. This form was first recorded in 1699, while an alternative name of the parish, &quot;Bangor Monachorum&quot; (&quot;Bangor of the monks&quot;), was first recorded in 1677.

==History==
A monastery was established at Bangor in about AD 560 by Saint Dunod (or Dunawd) and was an important religious centre in the 5th and 6th centuries. The monastery was destroyed in about 613 by the Anglo-Saxon king Æthelfrith of Northumbria after he defeated the Welsh armies at the Battle of Chester, which probably took place near Bangor-on-Dee; a number of the monks then transferred to Bardsey Island and appear among lists of saints. Before the battle, monks from the monastery had fasted for three days and then climbed a hill to witness the fight and pray for the success of the Welsh; they were massacred on the orders of Æthelfrith. The scholar Bede wrote that 1200 monks were slaughtered and only 50 escaped. Other accounts are very different in terms of the numbers killed and the date: the &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot;, for example, states that 200 priests were slain at Chester in 607. More than a millennium later, the massacre was recounted in a poem entitled &quot;The Monks of Bangor&#x27;s March&quot; by Walter Scott, and put to music by Ludwig van Beethoven. Today no trace of the monastery remains and even its site is uncertain; it is possible that all the buildings, including the church, were built of wattle and daub.

The settlement at Bangor is likely to have continued after the destruction of the monastery, although it was not mentioned in the Domesday Book, and it was an important site for pilgrims. A village was certainly in existence by 1300, when the present church of Saint Dunawd is believed to have been built. By the late 1690s, the historian Edward Lhuyd recorded that the village still had only 26 houses, but by the end of the 19th century it had significantly expanded, including a free school, a coaching inn, a shop, further houses and a brewery.

The Bangor-on-Dee Bridge, a five-arched stone arch bridge across the River Dee, dates its reconstruction to 1658 and it is believed to have been reconstructed to the designs of Inigo Jones and replaced an older medieval bridge. A 1903 suspension bridge by David Rowell &amp; Co. is nearby at Pickhill Meadows.

==Transport==

Bangor had a station on the Cambrian Railways&#x27; Wrexham to Ellesmere line which crossed the River Dee via an iron bridge to the north of the village. This line was opened in 1895 and ran through an entirely rural area. The line closed for passenger services in 1962.

==Recreation==
South-west of the village there is Bangor-on-Dee racecourse, a National Hunt racecourse. There are also two pubs, a basketball court and river activities such as fishing and rafting.

<text>Shipston-on-Stour is a town and civil parish in the Stratford-on-Avon District in southern Warwickshire, England. It is located on the banks of the River Stour, south-southeast of Stratford-upon-Avon, 10 miles (16 km) north-northwest of Chipping Norton, south of Warwick and 14.5 miles (23 km) west of Banbury. In the 2021 census, Shipston-on-Stour had a population of 5,849.

This area is sometimes termed the Vale of Red Horse, close to the Oxfordshire and Gloucestershire borders.

==History==

===Etymology linked to sheep and wool trade===

In the 8th century, the toponym was &quot;Scepwaeisctune&quot;, Old English for Sheep-wash-Town. It had a sheep marketplace for many centuries. The name evolved through &quot;Scepwestun&quot; in the 11th century, &quot;Sipestone&quot;, &quot;Sepwestun&quot; and &quot;Schipton&quot; in the 13th century and &quot;Sepestonon-Sture&quot; in the 14th century.

===Church (vestry) administration, township and parish formation===

It was a township in the parish of Tredington until 1720: when they were separated by a Local Act of the 6th year of George I. The town proved prosperous and generous to its church community: the Church of England parish church of Saint Edmund has a 15th-century tower. The Gothic Revival architect G.E. Street designed the rebuilding of the rest of the church in 1855. The tower had a ring of five bells until 1695 when they were recast and rehung as a ring of six. Since then all the bells have been recast and rehung from time to time, notably in 1754 and by John Taylor &amp; Co. in 1979.

===A staging post for stagecoaches and regional market===

Shipston is on the A3400 (formerly part of the A34) between Stratford-upon-Avon and Oxford; it was from the 1600s to 1800s a staging place for stagecoaches. There are former coaching inns, such as the Coach and Horses, in the High Street, which has many listed buildings.

From 1836, agricultural produce and manufactured goods were brought by a branch line from the horse-drawn Stratford and Moreton Tramway, which had been built ten years before to link Moreton-in-Marsh with Stratford on Avon. In 1889 the Great Western Railway upgraded the line to allow the operation of steam trains from Moreton to Shipston. Passenger services to the town&#x27;s railway station were withdrawn in 1929 and goods services ceased in 1960.

===Early Victorian times===
The town&#x27;s first library and reading room were founded in 1837. Manufacture of shag fabric for deep-pile carpets was for some decades an important business, but by 1848 the town had little manufacture or commerce even though it had more than 1800 residents. Worcester Cathedral owned the manorial rights for centuries, and even in the 1840s held a court annually, at which a town constable was appointed. Powers of the short-lived county debt court, established in 1847, extended over Shipston&#x27;s civil registration district (established 1837). In that era the market was on Saturday and fairs in April, June, August and October. The rectory had Tidmington annexed and received net income of £700. The patrons were Worcester Cathedral and Jesus College, Oxford, the former presenting (appointing the priest) to every third vacancy. The church had extra seats, a gallery, erected in 1790. Baptists, the Society of Friends, and Wesleyans each had a place of worship; and at Foxcote, in the parish, was a Roman Catholic chapel. A National school was endowed with about £130 per annum; and &quot;various small bequests&quot; were distributed among the poor.

===Poor law union and rural district===
Shipston poor law union (c.1830–1894) administered those functions in 37 parishes or places: 20 in Warwickshire, 13 in Gloucestershire, and 4 in Worcestershire; across in the 1840s a population of 19,685 people.

From 1894, until 1974, the offices and Council meetings of Shipston-on-Stour Rural District were in Shipston.

===County exclave===

Shipston was in an exclave of Worcestershire (as part of Oswaldslow hundred) until 1931, when it was transferred to Warwickshire.

==Amenities==
The Sports Club has football, cricket, bowls, tennis and angling clubs. Shipston First Scout Group has Beaver (ages 6–8), Cub (ages 8–10½) and Scout (ages 10½–14) sections. Shipston on Stour Rugby Football Club currently plays in the Midlands 3 West (South) league. Shipston has a brass band.

Shipston has a small museum located off Telegraph Street. The museum was set up, and is run by local people. It is stocked with artefacts and memorabilia relating to the town and the surrounding villages.
===Public services===
The two schools serving the town are Shipston Primary School, and Shipston High School. The town also has a library, operated by the county council. 

There is a small NHS community hospital serving the town; the Ellen Badger Hospital.

The Warwickshire Fire and Rescue Service operate a retained fire station in Shipston-on-Stour.

==Transport==
The A3400 road runs through Shipston, and links it with Stratford-upon-Avon to the north-west, and to Chipping Norton and Oxford to the south-east. The A429 road passes to the west, using part of the historic Fosse Way, which connect Shipston with Warwick to the north, and Tewkesbury to the south-west.

The nearest railway station to Shipston today is Moreton-in-Marsh railway station on the Cotswold Line around to the south. Shipston once had its own railway station at the end of a branch line, which had its passenger services withdrawn in 1929, and goods services in 1960.
==Media==
Local TV coverage is provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from either the Lark Stoke or Sutton Coldfield TV transmitters. 

Local radio stations are BBC CWR, Capital Mid-Counties, Heart West Midlands, Hits Radio Coventry &amp; Warwickshire, Fresh (Coventry &amp; Warwickshire), and Radio Warneford which broadcast to patients at the Ellen Badger Hospital in the town.

The town is served by these local newspapers, &quot;Evesham Journal&quot; and &quot;Coventry Telegraph&quot;.

==Governance==
Shipton-on-Stour is a civil parish which falls within areas of Stratford-on-Avon District Council and Warwickshire County Council, each responsible for different aspects of local government. The lowest tier of local government is Shipston Town Council, a parish council, which has 13 elected councillors.

Shipston is within the Parliamentary constituency of Stratford-on-Avon

==Cultural references==
Robin Gibb of the Bee Gees mentioned Shipston in his song &quot;Cold Be My Days&quot;, which contains the lyrics &quot;&quot;Cold be my days in Shipston-on-Stour&quot;:&quot; The song was recorded in 1970, but not released until 2015 for the unfinished album &quot;Sing Slowly Sisters&quot;. He stated in a BBC Radio 4 interview in May 2007 that this relates to his youthful experiences, riding horses with his brother Barry.

<doc id="371272" wikidata="Q185628" url="?curid=371272" title="Thrips">
<text>Thrips (order Thysanoptera) are minute (mostly long or less), slender insects with fringed wings and unique asymmetrical mouthparts. Entomologists have described approximately 7,700 species. They fly only weakly and their feathery wings are unsuitable for conventional flight; instead, thrips exploit an unusual mechanism, clap and fling, to create lift using an unsteady circulation pattern with transient vortices near the wings.
Thrips are a functionally diverse group; many of the known species are fungivorous. A small proportion of the species are serious pests of commercially important crops. Some of these serve as vectors for over 20 viruses that cause plant disease, especially the Tospoviruses. Many flower-dwelling species bring benefits as pollinators, with some predatory thrips feeding on small insects or mites. In the right conditions, such as in greenhouses, invasive species can exponentially increase in population size and form large swarms because of a lack of natural predators coupled with their ability to reproduce asexually, making them destructive to crops. Their identification to species by standard morphological characteristics is often challenging.

==Naming and etymology ==

The first recorded mention of thrips dates from the 17th century, and a sketch was made by Philippo Bonanni, a Catholic priest, in 1691. Swedish entomologist Baron Charles De Geer described two species in the genus &quot;Physapus&quot; in 1744, and Linnaeus in 1746 added a third species and named this group of insects &quot;Thrips&quot;. In 1836 the Irish entomologist Alexander Henry Haliday described 41 species in 11 genera and proposed the order name of Thysanoptera. The first monograph on the group was published in 1895 by Heinrich Uzel, who is regarded by Fedor &quot;et al.&quot; as the father of Thysanoptera studies.

The generic and English name &quot;thrips&quot; is a direct transliteration of the Ancient Greek word , &quot;thrips&quot;, meaning &quot;woodworm&quot;. Like some other animal-names (such as &quot;sheep&quot;, &quot;deer&quot;, and &quot;moose&quot;) in English the word &quot;thrips&quot; expresses both the singular and plural, so there may be many thrips or a single thrips. Other common names for thrips include thunderflies, thunderbugs, storm flies, thunderblights, storm bugs, corn fleas, corn flies, corn lice, freckle bugs, harvest bugs, and physopods. The older group name &quot;physopoda&quot; references the bladder-like tips to the tarsi of the legs. The name of the order, &quot;Thysanoptera&quot;, is constructed from the ancient Greek words , &quot;thysanos&quot;, &quot;tassel or fringe&quot;, and , &quot;pteron&quot;, &quot;wing&quot;, with reference to the insects&#x27; fringed wings.

==Morphology ==

Thrips are small hemimetabolic insects with a distinctive cigar-shaped body plan. They are elongated with transversely constricted bodies. They range in size from in length for the larger predatory thrips, but most thrips are about 1 mm in length. Flight-capable thrips have two similar, strap-like pairs of wings with a fringe of bristles. The wings are folded back over the body at rest. Their legs usually end in two tarsal segments with a bladder-like structure known as an &quot;arolium&quot; at the pretarsus. This structure can be by means of hemolymph pressure, enabling the insect to walk on vertical surfaces. They have compound eyes consisting of a small number of ommatidia and three ocelli or simple eyes on the head.
Thrips have asymmetrical mouthparts unique to the group. Unlike the Hemiptera (true bugs), the right mandible of thrips is reduced and vestigial – and in some species completely absent.
The left mandible is used briefly to cut into the food plant; saliva is injected and the maxillary stylets, which form a tube, are then inserted and the semi-digested food pumped from ruptured cells. This process leaves cells destroyed or collapsed, and a distinctive silvery or bronze scarring on the surfaces of the stems or leaves where the thrips have fed. The mouthparts of thrips have been described as “rasping-sucking”, “punching and sucking”, or, simply just a specific type of “piercing-sucking” mouthparts.

Thysanoptera is divided into two suborders, Terebrantia and Tubulifera; these can be distinguished by morphological, behavioral, and developmental characteristics. Tubulifera consists of a single family, Phlaeothripidae; members can be identified by their characteristic tube-shaped apical abdominal segment, egg-laying atop the surface of leaves, and three &quot;pupal&quot; stages. In the Phlaeothripidae, the males are often larger than females and a range of sizes may be found within a population. The largest recorded phlaeothripid species is about 14 mm long. Females of the eight families of the Terebrantia all possess the eponymous saw-like (see ) ovipositor on the anteapical abdominal segment, lay eggs singly within plant tissue, and have two &quot;pupal&quot; stages. In most Terebrantia, the males are smaller than females. The family Uzelothripidae has a single species and it is unique in having a whip-like terminal antennal segment.

==Evolution ==

The earliest fossils of thrips date back to the Permian &quot;Permothrips longipennis&quot;, although it probably not a member of this group. By the Early Cretaceous, true thrips became much more abundant. The extant family Merothripidae most resembles these ancestral Thysanoptera, and is probably basal to the order. There are currently over six thousand species of thrips recognized, grouped into 777 extant and sixty fossil genera. Some thrips were pollinators of the Ginkgoales as early as 110-105 Mya, in the Cretaceous. &quot;Cenomanithrips primus&quot;, &quot;Didymothrips abdominalis&quot; and &quot;Parallelothrips separatus&quot; are known from Myanmar amber of the Cenomanian age.

===Phylogeny===

Thrips are generally considered to be the sister group to Hemiptera (bugs). The phylogeny of thrips families has been little studied. A preliminary analysis in 2013 of 37 species using 3 genes, as well as a phylogeny based on ribosomal DNA and three proteins in 2012, supports the monophyly of the two suborders, Tubulifera and Terebrantia. In Terebrantia, Melanothripidae may be sister to all other families, but other relationships remain unclear. In Tubulifera, the Phlaeothripidae and its subfamily Idolothripinae are monophyletic. The two largest thrips subfamilies, Phlaeothripinae and Thripinae, are paraphyletic and need further work to determine their structure. The internal relationships from these analyses are shown in the cladogram.

The following families are (2013) recognized:

* Suborder Terebrantia 
:* Adiheterothripidae (11 genera)
:* Aeolothripidae (29 genera) – banded thrips and broad-winged thrips 
:* Fauriellidae (four genera)
:* †Hemithripidae (one fossil genus, &quot;Hemithrips&quot; with 15 species)
:* Heterothripidae (seven genera, restricted to the New World)
:* †Jezzinothripidae (included by some authors in Merothripidae)
:* †Karataothripidae (one fossil species, &quot;Karataothrips jurassicus&quot;)
:* Melanthripidae (six genera of flower feeders)
:* Merothripidae (five genera, mostly Neotropical and feeding on dry-wood fungi) – large-legged thrips
:* †Scudderothripidae (included by some authors in Stenurothripidae)
:* Thripidae (292 genera in four subfamilies, flower living) – common thrips
:* †Triassothripidae (two fossil genera)
:* Uzelothripidae (one species, &quot;Uzelothrips scabrosus&quot;)
* Suborder Tubulifera
:* Phlaeothripidae (447 genera in two subfamilies, fungal hyphae and spore feeders)

The identification of thrips to species is challenging as types are maintained as slide preparations of varying quality over time. There is also considerable variability leading to many species being misidentified. Molecular sequence based approaches have increasingly been applied to their identification.

==Biology==

===Feeding===

Thrips are believed to have descended from a fungus-feeding ancestor during the Mesozoic, and many groups still feed upon and inadvertently redistribute fungal spores. These live among leaf litter or on dead wood and are important members of the ecosystem, their diet often being supplemented with pollen. Other species are primitively eusocial and form plant galls and still others are predatory on mites and other thrips. Two species of &quot;Aulacothrips&quot;, &quot;A. tenuis&quot; and &quot;A. levinotus&quot;, have been found to be ectoparasites on aetalionid and membracid plant-hoppers in Brazil. &quot;Akainothrips francisi&quot; of Australia is a parasite within the colonies of another thrips species &quot;Dunatothrips aneurae&quot; that makes silken nests or domiciles on &quot;Acacia&quot; trees. A number of thrips in the subfamily Phlaeothripinae that specialize on &quot;Acacia&quot; hosts produce silk with which they glue together phyllodes to form domiciles inside which their semi-social colonies live.

&quot;Mirothrips arbiter&quot; has been found in paper wasp nests in Brazil. The eggs of the hosts including &quot;Mischocyttarus atramentarius&quot;, &quot;Mischocyttarus cassununga&quot; and &quot;Polistes versicolor&quot; are eaten by the thrips. Thrips, especially in the family Aeolothripidae, are also predators, and are considered beneficial in the management of pests like the codling moths.

Most research has focused on thrips species that feed on economically significant crops. Some species are predatory, but most of them feed on pollen and the chloroplasts harvested from the outer layer of plant epidermal and mesophyll cells. They prefer tender parts of the plant, such as buds, flowers and new leaves. Besides feeding on plant tissues, the common blossom thrips feeds on pollen grains and on the eggs of mites. When the larva supplements its diet in this way, its development time and mortality is reduced, and adult females that consume mite eggs increase their fecundity and longevity.

===Pollination ===

Some flower-feeding thrips pollinate the flowers they are feeding on, and some authors suspect that they may have been among the first insects to evolve a pollinating relationship with their host plants. Amber fossils of &quot;Gymnopollisthrips&quot; from the Early Cretaceous show them to be coated in &quot;Cycadopites&quot;-like pollen. &quot;Scirtothrips dorsalis&quot; carries pollen of commercially important chili peppers. Darwin found that thrips could not be kept out by any netting when he conducted experiments by keeping away larger pollinators.&quot;Thrips setipennis&quot; is the sole pollinator of &quot;Wilkiea huegeliana&quot;, a small, unisexual annually flowering tree or shrub in the rainforests of eastern Australia. &quot;T. setipennis&quot; serves as an obligate pollinator for other Australian rainforest plant species, including &quot;Myrsine howittiana&quot; and &quot;M. variabilis.&quot; The genus &quot;Cycadothrips&quot; is a specialist pollinator of cycads, which are normally wind pollinated but some species of &quot;Macrozamia&quot; are able to attract thrips to male cones at some times and repel them so that they move to female cones. Thrips are likewise the primary pollinators of heathers in the family &quot;Ericaceae&quot;, and play a significant role in the pollination of pointleaf manzanita. Electron microscopy has shown thrips carrying pollen grains adhering to their backs, and their fringed wings are perfectly capable of allowing them to fly from plant to plant.

===Damage to plants ===

Thrips can cause damage during feeding. This impact may fall across a broad selection of prey items, as there is considerable breadth in host affinity across the order, and even within a species, varying degrees of fidelity to a host. Family Thripidae in particular is notorious for members with broad host ranges, and the majority of pest thrips come from this family. For example, &quot;Thrips tabaci&quot; damages crops of onions, potatoes, tobacco, and cotton.
Some species of thrips create galls, almost always in leaf tissue. These may occur as curls, rolls or folds, or as alterations to the expansion of tissues causing distortion to leaf blades. More complex examples cause rosettes, pouches and horns. Most of these species occur in the tropics and sub-tropics, and the structures of the galls are diagnostic of the species involved. A radiation of thrips species seems to have taken place on &quot;Acacia&quot; trees in Australia; some of these species cause galls in the petioles, sometimes fixing two leaf stalks together, while other species live in every available crevice in the bark. In &quot;Casuarina&quot; in the same country, some species have invaded stems, creating long-lasting woody galls.

=== Social behaviour ===

While poorly documented, chemical communication is believed to be important to the group. Anal secretions are produced in the hindgut, and released along the posterior setae as predator deterrents In Australia, aggregations of male common blossom thrips have been observed on the petals of &quot;Hibiscus rosa-sinensis&quot; and &quot;Gossypium hirsutum&quot;; females were attracted to these groups so it seems likely that the males were producing pheromones.

In the phlaeothripids that feed on fungi, males compete to protect and mate with females, and then defend the egg-mass. Males fight by flicking their rivals away with their abdomen, and may kill with their foretarsal teeth. Small males may sneak in to mate while the larger males are busy fighting. In the Merothripidae and in the Aeolothripidae, males are again polymorphic with large and small forms, and probably also compete for mates, so the strategy may well be ancestral among the Thysanoptera.

Many thrips form galls on plants when feeding or laying their eggs. Some of the gall-forming Phlaeothripidae, such as genera &quot;Kladothrips&quot; and &quot;Oncothrips&quot;, form eusocial groups similar to ant colonies, with reproductive queens and nonreproductive soldier castes.

===Flight===

Most insects create lift by the stiff-winged mechanism of insect flight with steady state aerodynamics; this creates a leading edge vortex continuously as the wing moves. The feathery wings of thrips, however, generate lift by clap and fling, a mechanism discovered by the Danish zoologist Torkel Weis-Fogh in 1973. In the clap part of the cycle, the wings approach each other over the insect&#x27;s back, creating a circulation of air which sets up vortices and generates useful forces on the wings. The leading edges of the wings touch, and the wings rotate around their leading edges, bringing them together in the &quot;clap&quot;. The wings close, expelling air from between them, giving more useful thrust. The wings rotate around their trailing edges to begin the &quot;fling&quot;, creating useful forces. The leading edges move apart, making air rush in between them and setting up new vortices, generating more force on the wings. The trailing edge vortices, however, cancel each other out with opposing flows. Weis-Fogh suggested that this cancellation might help the circulation of air to grow more rapidly, by shutting down the Wagner effect which would otherwise counteract the growth of the circulation.

Apart from active flight, thrips, even wingless ones, can also be picked up by winds and transferred long distances. During warm and humid weather, adults may climb to the tips of plants to leap and catch air current. Wind-aided dispersal of species has been recorded over 1600 km of sea between Australia and South Island of New Zealand. It has been suggested that some bird species may also be involved in the dispersal of thrips. Thrips are picked up along with grass in the nests of birds and can be transported by the birds.

A hazard of flight for very small insects such as thrips is the possibility of being trapped by water. Thrips have non-wetting bodies and have the ability to ascend a meniscus by arching their bodies and working their way head-first and upwards along the water surface in order to escape.

===Life cycle ===

Thrips lay extremely small eggs, about 0.2 mm long. Females of the suborder Terebrantia cut slits in plant tissue with their ovipositor, and insert their eggs, one per slit. Females of the suborder Tubulifera lay their eggs singly or in small groups on the outside surfaces of plants. Some thrips such as &quot;Elaphothrips tuberculatus&quot; are known to be facultatively ovoviviparous, retaining the eggs internally and giving birth to male offspring. Females in many species guard the eggs against cannibalism by other females as well as predators.

Thrips are hemimetabolous, metamorphosing gradually to the adult form. The first two instars, called larvae or nymphs, are like small wingless adults (often confused with springtails) without genitalia; these feed on plant tissue. In the Terebrantia, the third and fourth instars, and in the Tubulifera also a fifth instar, are non-feeding resting stages similar to pupae: in these stages, the body&#x27;s organs are reshaped, and wing-buds and genitalia are formed. The larvae of some species produce silk from the terminal abdominal segment which is used to line the cell or form a cocoon within which they pupate. The adult stage can be reached in around 8–15 days; adults can live for around 45 days. Adults have both winged and wingless forms; in the grass thrips &quot;Anaphothrips obscurus&quot;, for example, the winged form makes up 90% of the population in spring (in temperate zones), while the wingless form makes up 98% of the population late in the summer. Thrips can survive the winter as adults or through egg or pupal diapause.

Thrips are haplodiploid with haploid males (from unfertilised eggs, as in Hymenoptera) and diploid females capable of parthenogenesis (reproducing without fertilisation), many species using arrhenotoky, a few using thelytoky. In &quot;Pezothrips kellyanus&quot; females hatch from larger eggs than males, possibly because they are more likely to be fertilized. The sex-determining bacterial endosymbiont &quot;Wolbachia&quot; is a factor that affects the reproductive mode. Several normally bisexual species have become established in the United States with only females present.

==Human impact==

===As pests===

Many thrips are pests of commercial crops due to the damage they cause by feeding on developing flowers or vegetables, causing discoloration, deformities, and reduced marketability of the crop. Some thrips serve as vectors for plant diseases, such as tospoviruses. Over 20 plant-infecting viruses are known to be transmitted by thrips, but perversely, less than a dozen of the described species are known to vector tospoviruses. These enveloped viruses are considered among some of the most damaging of emerging plant pathogens around the world, with those vector species having an outsized impact on human agriculture. Virus members include the tomato spotted wilt virus and the impatiens necrotic spot viruses. The western flower thrips, &quot;Frankliniella occidentalis&quot;, has spread until it now has a worldwide distribution, and is the primary vector of plant diseases caused by tospoviruses. Other viruses that they spread include the genera &quot;Ilarvirus&quot;, &quot;(Alpha |Beta |Gamma)carmovirus&quot;, &quot;Sobemovirus&quot; and &quot;Machlomovirus.&quot; Their small size and predisposition towards enclosed places makes them difficult to detect by phytosanitary inspection, while their eggs, laid inside plant tissue, are well-protected from pesticide sprays. When coupled with the increasing globalization of trade and the growth of greenhouse agriculture, thrips, unsurprisingly, are among the fastest growing group of invasive species in the world. Examples include &quot;F. occidentalis&quot;, &quot;Thrips simplex&quot;, and &quot;Thrips palmi&quot;.

Flower-feeding thrips are routinely attracted to bright floral colors (including white, blue, and especially yellow), and will land and attempt to feed. It is not uncommon for some species (e.g., &quot;Frankliniella tritici&quot; and &quot;Limothrips cerealium&quot;) to &quot;bite&quot; humans under such circumstances. Although no species feed on blood and no known animal disease is transmitted by thrips, some skin irritation has been described.

===Management===

Thrips develop resistance to insecticides easily and there is constant research on how to control them. This makes thrips ideal as models for testing the effectiveness of new pesticides and methods.

Due to their small sizes and high rates of reproduction, thrips are difficult to control using classical biological control. Suitable predators must be small and slender enough to penetrate the crevices where thrips hide while feeding, and they must also prey extensively on eggs and larvae to be effective. Only two families of parasitoid Hymenoptera parasitize eggs and larvae, the Eulophidae and the Trichogrammatidae. Other biocontrol agents of adults and larvae include anthocorid bugs of genus &quot;Orius&quot;, and phytoseiid mites. Biological insecticides such as the fungi &quot;Beauveria bassiana&quot; and &quot;Verticillium lecanii&quot; can kill thrips at all life-cycle stages. Insecticidal soap spray is effective against thrips. It is commercially available or can be made of certain types of household soap. Scientists in Japan report that significant reductions in larva and adult melon thrips occur when plants are illuminated with red light.

<doc id="371273" wikidata="Q1504755" url="?curid=371273" title="Speckle imaging">
<text>Speckle imaging comprises a range of high-resolution astronomical imaging techniques based on the analysis of large numbers of short exposures that freeze the variation of atmospheric turbulence. They can be divided into the shift-and-add (&quot;image stacking&quot;) method and the speckle interferometry methods. These techniques can dramatically increase the resolution of ground-based telescopes, but are limited to bright targets.

== Explanation ==

The principle of all the techniques is to take very short exposure images of astronomical targets, and then process those so as to remove the effects of astronomical seeing. Use of these techniques led to a number of discoveries, including thousands of binary stars that would otherwise appear as a single star to a visual observer working with a similar-sized telescope, and the first images of sunspot-like phenomena on other stars. Many of the techniques remain in wide use today, notably when imaging relatively bright targets.

The resolution of a telescope is limited by the size of the main mirror, due to the effects of Fraunhofer diffraction. This results in images of distant objects being spread out to a small spot known as the Airy disk. A group of objects whose images are closer together than this limit appear as a single object. Thus larger telescopes can image not only dimmer objects (because they collect more light), but resolve objects that are closer together as well.

This improvement of resolution breaks down due to the practical limits imposed by the atmosphere, whose random nature disrupts the single spot of the Airy disk into a pattern of similarly-sized spots scattered over a much larger area (see the adjacent image of a binary). For typical seeing, the practical resolution limits are at mirror sizes much less than the mechanical limits for the size of mirrors, namely at a mirror diameter equal to the astronomical seeing parameter &quot;r&quot;0 – about 20 cm in diameter for observations with visible light under good conditions. For many years, telescope performance was limited by this effect, until the introduction of speckle interferometry and adaptive optics provided a means of removing this limitation.

Speckle imaging recreates the original image through image processing techniques. The key to the technique, found by the American astronomer David L. Fried in 1966, was to take very fast images in which case the atmosphere is effectively &quot;frozen&quot; in place. At infrared wavelengths, coherence times τ0 are on the order of 100 ms, but for the visible region they drop to as little as 10 ms. When exposure times are shorter than τ0, the movement of the atmosphere is too sluggish to have an effect; the speckles recorded in the image are a snapshot of the atmospheric seeing at that instant. Coherence time τ0 = &quot;r&quot;0/&quot;v&quot; is a function of wavelength, because &quot;r&quot;0 is a function of wavelength.

The downside of the technique is that taking images at this short an exposure is difficult, and if the object is too dim, not enough light will be captured to make analysis possible. Early uses of the technique in the early 1970s were made on a limited scale using photographic techniques, but since photographic film captures only about 7% of the incoming light, only the brightest of objects could be viewed in this way. The introduction of the CCD into astronomy, which captures more than 70% of the light, lowered the bar on practical applications by an order of magnitude, and today the technique is widely used on bright astronomical objects (e.g. stars and star systems).

Many of the simpler speckle imaging methods have multiple names, largely from amateur astronomers re-inventing existing speckle imaging techniques and giving them new names.

Another use of the technique is in industry. By shining a laser (whose smooth wavefront is an excellent simulation of the light from a distant star) on a surface, the resulting speckle pattern can be processed to give detailed images of flaws in the material.

== Types ==

=== Shift-and-add method ===


The shift-and-add method (more recently &quot;image-stacking&quot; method) is a form of speckle imaging commonly used for obtaining high quality images from a number of short exposures with varying image shifts. It has been used in astronomy for several decades, and is the basis for the image stabilisation feature on some cameras. The short exposure images are aligned by using the brightest speckle and averaged to give a single output image.

The method involves calculation of the differential shifts of the images. This is easily accomplished in astronomical images since they can be aligned with the stars. Once the images are aligned they are averaged together. It is a basic principle of statistics that variation in a sample can be reduced by averaging together the individual values. In fact, when using an average, the signal-to-noise ratio should be increased by a factor of the square root of the number of images. A number of software packages exist for performing this, including IRAF, RegiStax, Autostakkert, Keiths Image Stacker, Hugin, and Iris.

In the lucky imaging approach, only the best short exposures are selected for averaging. Early shift-and-add techniques aligned images according to the image centroid, giving a lower overall Strehl ratio.

=== Speckle interferometry ===

In 1970, the French astronomer Antoine Labeyrie showed that Fourier analysis (&quot;speckle interferometry&quot;) can obtain information about the high-resolution structure of the object from the statistical properties of the speckle patterns. This technique was first implemented in 1971 at Palomar Observatory (200-inch telescope) by Daniel Y. Gezari, Antoine Labeyrie and Robert V. Stachnick. Methods developed in the 1980s allowed simple images to be reconstructed from this power spectrum information.

One more recent type of speckle interferometry called &quot; speckle masking&quot;&#x27; involves calculation of the &quot;bispectrum&quot; or &quot;closure phases&quot; from each of the short exposures. The &quot;average bispectrum&quot; can then be calculated and then inverted to obtain an image. This works particularly well using aperture masks. In this arrangement the telescope aperture is blocked except for a few holes which allow light through, creating a small optical interferometer with better resolving power than the telescope would otherwise have. This aperture masking technique was pioneered by the Cavendish Astrophysics Group.

One limitation of the technique is that it requires extensive computer processing of the image, which was hard to come by when the technique was first developed. This limitation has faded away over the years as computing power has increased, and nowadays desktop computers have more than enough power to make such processing a trivial task.

== Biology ==

Speckle imaging in biology refers to the underlabeling of periodic cellular components (such as filaments and fibers) so that instead of appearing as a continuous and uniform structure, it appears as a discrete set of speckles. This is due to statistical distribution of the labeled component within unlabeled components. The technique, also known as dynamic speckle enables real-time monitoring of dynamical systems and video image analysis to understand biological processes.

<text>Tilphussa ( &quot;Tilphoũssa&quot;) is a spring in Boeotia. Tiresias died after he drank water from this spring. Strabo locates the deadly spring below the slopes of Tilphossium (, near Haliartus and Alalcomenae; he mentions the sanctuary of Tiresias and the temple of Tilphoussian Apollo, unique to this site. Pausanias noted that a temple consecrated to Praxidike was in the vicinity of Tiresias&#x27;s tomb. The manuscript tradition of Plutarch&#x27;s &quot;Life of Lysander&quot; offers a unique report of a spring &quot;Kissousa&quot; at Haliartus, in which the infant Dionysus was washed; this must be a scribal error for &quot;Tilphousa&quot;.

<doc id="371283" wikidata="Q1158334" url="?curid=371283" title="Dame Edna Everage">
<text>Dame Edna Everage, often known simply as Dame Edna, is a character created and performed by late Australian comedian Barry Humphries, known for her lilac-coloured (&quot;wisteria hue&quot;) hair and cat eye glasses (&quot;face furniture&quot;); her favourite flower, the gladiolus (&quot;gladdies&quot;); and her boisterous greeting &quot;Hello, Possums!&quot; As Dame Edna, Humphries wrote several books, including an autobiography, &quot;My Gorgeous Life&quot;; appeared in several films; and hosted several television shows (on which Humphries also appeared as himself and other alter-egos).

Humphries regularly updated Edna. Starting as a drab Melbourne housewife satirising Australian suburbia, the character adopted an increasingly outlandish wardrobe after performances in London in the 1960s, through which she grew in stature and popularity.

Edna was known for her outlandish spectacles. Humphries claimed the eyeglasses, and other aspects of Edna&#x27;s personality, were inspired by Stephanie Deste, a Melbourne eccentric, beautician, radio broadcaster, actor and dancer.

Following film appearances and an elevation to damehood in the 1970s, the character evolved to &quot;Housewife and Superstar&quot;, then &quot;Megastar&quot; and finally &quot;Gigastar&quot;. Throughout the 1980s and 1990s, Dame Edna became increasingly known in North America after multiple stage and television appearances.

Edna described her chat-shows as &quot;an intimate conversation between two friends, one of whom is a lot more interesting than the other&quot;. The character was used to satirise the cult of celebrity, class snobbery, and prudishness and was often used by Humphries to poke fun at the political leaders and fashions of the times. Her exuberant persona and scathing commentary on society and celebrity, as well as her habit of treating celebrities like ordinary people (on her television shows) and ordinary people like celebrities (in her stage shows) have become signatures.

Although Humphries freely stated that Edna was a character he played, Edna referred to Humphries as her &quot;entrepreneur&quot; or manager. Humphries and his staff of assistants and writers only referred to Edna as &quot;she&quot; and &quot;her&quot;, never mixing the character with Humphries.

In March 2012, Humphries announced that the character would be retired at the end of the current stage tour, but later in 2013 he decided to bring her back. Humphries died in April 2023, having played Edna for almost 68 years.

== Character story ==
While Dame Edna was a fictitious character (whose life story was entirely created by Barry Humphries), so complete is her identity as an individual that Macmillan published &quot;My Gorgeous Life&quot;, Edna&#x27;s &quot;autobiography&quot; (written by Humphries but credited to Edna herself), on its non-fiction list. Humphries also wrote an &quot;Unauthorised Biography&quot; of his life as Edna&#x27;s manager: &quot;Handling Edna&quot;, published in 2010.

According to &quot;My Gorgeous Life&quot;, and statements Edna made over the years, she was born Edna May Beazley in Wagga Wagga, New South Wales, with a sibling who would give birth to Barry McKenzie. Everage started her stage career in a sketch entitled &quot;Olympic Hostess&quot; in the revue &quot;Return Fare&quot; on 19 December 1955 as Mrs. Norm Everage, an &quot;average Australian housewife&quot; from Moonee Ponds, a suburb in Melbourne, Victoria. She spent her time visiting world leaders and jet-setting between her homes in Los Angeles, London, Sydney, Switzerland and Martha&#x27;s Vineyard. She was a friend and confidante of Queen Elizabeth II and advised prime ministers and presidents. Edna once took an on-air phone call from President Ronald Reagan to assure him that he was, indeed, still the president; and at stageshows she claimed to be giving former Australian Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, elocution lessons.

The character had three adult children, Bruce, Kenny, and Valmai. Her first daughter, Lois, when still an infant, went missing and was believed to have been abducted by a &quot;rogue koala&quot; during a family camp in the outback, à la Azaria Chamberlain. In &quot;Handling Edna, the Unauthorised Biography&quot;, Humphries absolves the koala of any role in the affair and reveals the true fate of Lois, who in fact survived abduction to become a Catholic nun. Edna&#x27;s surviving daughter, Valmai, assisted Dame Edna on her most recent programmes for ITV1, including &quot;The Dame Edna Treatment&quot; and assisted on her live tour shows. Edna takes great pride in her two sons: Bruce, who works as an engineer in South Melbourne and is married to Joylene from Ivanhoe, and her youngest, Kenneth (or Kenny), who is a fashion designer in London and designed all of her frocks. Dame Edna refers often to him and his partner, Clifford Smale, both of whom Edna believes are searching for &quot;Miss Right&quot;, although she admits they are looking &quot;in some very strange places&quot;. Kenny appeared in Sir Les Patterson&#x27;s documentary &quot;Les Patterson and the Great Chinese Takeaway&quot; as a boutique owner in Hong Kong.

Dame Edna&#x27;s mother was incarcerated in a &quot;maximum-security twilight home for the permanently bewildered&quot;. Valmai and Kenny are the only family members who appeared on stage or screen with their mother. Her husband, Sir Norman Everage, died in 1988 after many years in hospital with prostate problems and a &quot;testicular murmur&quot;; Edna founded the non-profit &quot;Friends of the Prostate&quot; in his honour. Dame Edna was not with Norm when he died. And due to his insistence that all his organs be donated, by the time she reached his bedside, Norm had been &quot;globally recycled&quot; and all that remained was &quot;a dent in the pillow&quot;. As a result, Dame Edna almost believed that Norm&#x27;s cremation was a &quot;waste of money&quot;.

In the 21st century, Edna demonstrated her social conscience and sensitivity, telling audiences of her intention to adopt an African child from &quot;the country where Madonna shops for loved ones&quot;.

Dame Edna spent many years accompanied by her bridesmaid and constant companion Madge Allsop (played by Emily Perry), a New Zealander from Palmerston North who assisted Dame Edna with her appearances and television shows. (Perry died at the age of 100 in 2008 and Dame Edna&#x27;s daughter Valmai replaced her on stage). Madge never spoke a public word (although she sang on Comic Relief), and while she was often the butt of Dame Edna&#x27;s jokes, the two were devoted. In &quot;Handling Edna, the Unauthorised Biography&quot;, Humphries gives Madge a voice and explains the sad loss of her own husband in New Zealand&#x27;s boiling mud, whilst the couple were on their honeymoon.

On some of her shows (&quot;The Dame Edna Experience&quot;) Dame Edna was joined on stage by &#x27;Chuck&#x27; (Charlton Heston) where he would be mildly humiliated and mistreated.

Dame Edna was praised for her insights into her homeland. When asked why Australians are so good at sport she commented: &quot;the cli- mate, the diet, the outdoor life, and the total lack of any intellectual distraction&quot;.

Dame Edna launched a campaign to be appointed as a BBC newsreader in 2009 after the corporation announced it wished to seek a female newsreader over 50 years old.

Dame Edna claimed to have various medical conditions, such as Asperger syndrome, bipolar disorder, gluten intolerance, restless legs and attention deficit disorder.

In 2016, after Humphries made comments that were criticised as transphobic, Dame Edna&#x27;s official social media accounts made a post in which she distanced herself from the comments, stating that she had fired him years earlier but that he &quot;refuses to accept dismissal&quot; and opining that he &quot;is losing the plot&quot; and &quot;deserves our pity not our disapproval&quot;. In the same message, she also claimed partial Aboriginal Australian and Jewish ancestry.

=== Honours ===

On 7 March 2007, Melbourne renamed a city street in her honour: Dame Edna Place, formerly Brown Alley off Little Collins Street, was officially opened by the Lord Mayor of Melbourne, John So. Dame Edna Place is opposite Royal Arcade and The Causeway, between the major roads, Elizabeth Street and Swanston Street; it was, until its renaming, a service alley for adjoining buildings. Dame Edna was not at the renaming ceremony but was represented by ten look-alike Dames. Everage Street in suburban Moonee Ponds has also been named in her honour.

In 1982, Dame Edna&#x27;s alter-ego Barry Humphries was made an Officer of the Order of Australia for &quot;services to the theatre&quot; and on 16 June 2007 he was made a Commander of the Order of the British Empire for services to entertainment.

In MAC Cosmetics 2008 Winter Line-Up, a Dame Edna collection of cosmetics were released including eye shadow, lipstick, powder, and nail polish.

A bronze statue was unveiled at Melbourne Docklands in January 2009. It is located by the Yarra river near Harbour Town which also includes statues of singer John Farnham, Dame Nellie Melba, and Graham Kennedy.

In 2020, a species of brightly iridescent Australian soldier fly was named &quot;Opaluma ednae&quot; in honour of the character, &quot;whose signature hair has a striking resemblance to the colouration of this species.&quot; Other species described in the same article were named &quot;O. rupaul&quot; (after drag queen RuPaul) and &quot;O. &quot;.

== Invention of the character ==
Barry Humphries was invited to join the fledgling Union Theatre Repertory Company early in 1955 and toured Victorian country towns performing &quot;Twelfth Night&quot;, directed by Ray Lawler. On tour, Humphries invented Edna gradually as part of the entertainment for the actors during commutes between country towns. Humphries gradually developed a falsetto impersonation of a Melbourne housewife, imitating the Country Women&#x27;s Association representatives who welcomed the troupe in each town. At Lawler&#x27;s suggestion, Mrs Everage (later named Edna after Humphries&#x27; nanny) made her first appearance in a Melbourne University&#x27;s UTRC revue at the end of 1955, as the city prepared for the 1956 Olympic Games. The sketch involved a houseproud &quot;average housewife&quot; offering her Moonee Ponds home as an Olympic billet, her home as possessing &quot;burgundy wall-to-wall carpets, lamington cakes and reindeers frosted on glass dining-room doors&quot;.

At this time the character was billed as &quot;Mrs Norm Everage&quot; (Humphries describing this name as &quot;Everage as in &#x27;average&#x27;, husband Norm as in &#x27;normal&#x27;&quot;) and had none of the characteristic flamboyant wardrobe of later years.

His mother (whom the interviewer William Cook said &quot;sounds like a frightful snob&quot;) was a major inspiration for Edna, although he denied it when she was alive to protect her feelings. Her first monologue in 1955 was about her &quot;lovely home&quot;, reflecting young Barry&#x27;s own site visits accompanying his builder father. Originally she was a &quot;mousy&quot; character and too quiet to please the raucous crowd at The Establishment club in London.

According to John Lahr, Edna came into her own during the 1980s when the policies of Thatcherism—and what he described as the &quot;vindictive style of the times&quot;—allowed Dame Edna to sharpen her observations accordingly. Lahr wrote that Edna took Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher&#x27;s &quot;seemingly hypocritical motto&quot; of &quot;caring and compassion&quot; for others and turned it on its head, Edna became the voice of Humphries&#x27; outrage.

In a 2011 interview with CUNY TV, actor Zoe Caldwell claimed that the character had been written with her in mind, but that she turned it down as she did not believe she could make it funny. She then suggested to Humphries that he perform the role himself.

== Stage and screen performances ==
=== 1950s–1999 ===
Humphries played the character at comedy clubs, satirising the atmosphere of 1950s Melbourne suburbia. An interview with &quot;Mrs Everage&quot; was one of the programmes screened on HSV-7&#x27;s first day of programming in 1956. Another revue called Rock&#x27;n&#x27;Reel followed in 1958 at the New Theatre in Melbourne. She appeared in a televised revue shown on New Year&#x27;s Eve, 1958, &quot;Wild Life and Christmas Belles&quot;.

The character&#x27;s overseas debut, now as Edna Everage, was in the early 1960s at comedian Peter Cook&#x27;s nightclub, The Establishment, in London&#x27;s West End, where she received a poor review from Bamber Gascoigne, then the drama critic for &quot;The Spectator&quot;. Barry Humphries cites Cook as being instrumental in launching Edna&#x27;s UK career. While her first appearances at the Establishment Club were a flop, the mousy Edna being too quiet to please that raucous crowd, a 2016 interviewer William Cook saw the early failure as a blessing, so that Humphries spent the sixties as a jobbing actor rather than as a pampered star.

In 1972, the character appeared as Barry McKenzie&#x27;s &quot;Aunt Edna&quot; in the film, &quot;The Adventures of Barry McKenzie&quot;. In the sequel &quot;Barry McKenzie Holds His Own&quot;, the Australian Prime Minister Gough Whitlam cameos at the close of the film to confer upon Edna the title of Dame, henceforth to be known as &quot;Dame Edna&quot;.

Following the lukewarm reception to Edna&#x27;s early appearances in Humphries&#x27; 1969 stageshow &quot;Just a Show&quot; and the BBC television series &quot;The Barry Humphries Scandals&quot;, a growing awareness and appreciation among British audiences for Edna emerged and Humphries devised a stage show titled &quot;Edna Everage Housewife Superstar&quot; which was successfully presented in London&#x27;s West End in the mid-1970s. The show featured monologues, songs and what was becoming an Edna trademark – interaction with the theatre audience.

In April 1976, Edna made an appearance in &quot;A Poke in the Eye (with a Sharp Stick)&quot; — the first of what became Amnesty International&#x27;s Secret Policeman&#x27;s Ball series of benefit shows. Edna performed a song for the show and was featured in the film of the show. She also appeared in the 1981 Amnesty show &quot;The Secret Policeman&#x27;s Other Ball&quot;. Edna made a cameo appearance in the 1978 film &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;. In 1979 she was the subject of a BBC &quot;Arena&quot; mockumentary: &quot;La Dame aux Gladiolas&quot;.

Humphries debuted the character off-Broadway in New York City in the late 1970s, but the show received such a poor review from &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Humphries later joked that he thought, &quot;Well, I&#x27;ll go back to Broadway but I&#x27;ll wait till the critic&#x27;s dead — and I had to wait 25 years. I had to wait a quarter of a century for that critic to die&quot;.

Dame Edna&#x27;s success grew in the UK throughout the 1980s and early 1990s with semi-regular stage and television shows. Her first TV specials were in 1978–1979 on BBC, but she became popular with broadcaster ITV after her initial performance on &quot;An Audience With ... Dame Edna Everage&quot; in 1980, in front of an audience of invited celebrities. She went on to perform two more &quot;An Audience With...&quot; specials (in 1984 and 1988), the only performer ever to make three shows in the series.

In 1987, Edna starred alongside Humphries&#x27;s vulgar alter-ego Les Patterson in the comedy feature &quot;Les Patterson Saves the World&quot;. In the same year &quot;The Dame Edna Experience&quot;, ostensibly a talk show which she described as &quot;really a monologue interrupted by total strangers&quot; aired, featuring high-profile &quot;celebrity guests&quot; such as Sean Connery, Mel Gibson, Joan Rivers, and Germaine Greer (an old friend of Humphries&#x27;), as well as Madge, her silent, sour-faced &quot;bridesmaid and travelling companion&quot;. In 1989, the show was back for a second season, this time taking place in her &quot;luxury penthouse suite&quot; where her guests stayed and, in the case of Douglas Fairbanks, Jr, did her grocery shopping. Subsequently, these shows were aired in the U.S. on PBS, broadening her audience and enlarging her fame. &quot;Dame Edna&#x27;s Neighbourhood Watch&quot; a reality/game show hybrid, aired in 1992, and saw her and Madge having a look at her &quot;by invitation only, ladies audience&quot; member&#x27;s houses, and evaluating their housekeeping skills. U.S. television specials followed, as did an unsuccessful series which aired only one episode. She appeared as a guest of Phil Donahue on his talk show on 17 February 1993.

In 1997, she appeared in another television talk show &quot;Dr Dame Edna Kisses It Better&quot;. Edna continued her Australian stage and television appearances including a record five appearances as guest presenter at the TV Week Logie Awards and a role as a co-narrator (along with Humphries and Les Patterson) of the ABC&#x27;s Australian social history series &quot;Barry Humphries Flashbacks&quot; in 1999.

=== 2000–2009 ===
In 2000 and 2004, Dame Edna appeared on Broadway, and toured America with both shows. These were ostensibly not &quot;performances&quot;, but rather &quot;appearances&quot;, with Dame Edna giving monologues and interacting with audience members. Her 2000 show, &quot;The Royal Tour,&quot; won the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding One-Person Show, and a Tony Award.

During 2001 and 2002, Dame Edna appeared in the fifth season of the television show &quot;Ally McBeal&quot; playing the guest role of Claire Otoms, a client of the show&#x27;s law firm who later became a secretary at the same firm. The character shared Dame Edna&#x27;s voice and style and was explicitly listed in the opening credits as being played by Dame Edna Everage (although Barry Humphries received a credit in the closing credits). Claire Otoms is an anagram of &quot;A Sitcom Role&quot;.

In the 2002 motion picture &quot;Nicholas Nickleby&quot; Dame Edna plays the role of Mrs. Crummles, an actress and wife of the manager of a provincial theatre company. Barry Humphries also appears in the film as Mr. Leadville.

Dame Edna appeared at the Party at the Palace in London in 2002 where she referred to the Queen as the &quot;jubilee girl&quot;.

The nostalgic &quot;Barry Humphries: Back to my Roots&quot; tour featured Humphries, Edna, Sir Les and Sandy Stone around Australia in 2003.

In 2002 New Zealand artist Maurice Bennett was commissioned by an Australian bread company to create a tall 2,989-slice toast portrait of Dame Edna. It was exhibited on a billboard in La Trobe Street in Melbourne.

In 2003, she had an interview punctuated with NPR Weekend Edition&#x27;s host Scott Simon&#x27;s table-pounding laughter.

The character celebrated her 50th &quot;birthday&quot; in 2005. She appeared in the 2005 Myer Christmas advert. To mark the occasion, in 2006, Australia Post featured Edna on a postage stamp and the Lord Mayor of Melbourne presented Edna with the key to the city. She toured Australia with the stageshow &quot;Barry Humphries Back With a Vengeance&quot; and appeared on camera &quot;together&quot; with Humphries for the first time in an interview by Ray Martin for Australia&#x27;s 60 Minutes. She also appeared on screen at the Closing Ceremony of the 2006 Commonwealth Games in Melbourne while 1000 &quot;Commonwealth Dames&quot; danced around the arena wearing purple wigs, garish costumes and gladioli, singing along to her song, &quot;We&#x27;ve Made The Most of Melbourne&quot; : &quot;It&#x27;s not as small as Adelaide, Compared to Canberra, it&#x27;s bliss, And if you&#x27;ve been to Melbourne, You can give Sydney a miss.&quot;

On 20 May 2006 she appeared on ITV&#x27;s coverage of The Prince&#x27;s Trust 30th Birthday Concert. During the telethon-style segments of the event, she took part in a game of &quot;Blind Date&quot; picking former &quot;X Factor&quot; contestant Chico Slimani over actors Roger Moore and Richard E Grant.

In the summer of 2006, Dame Edna appeared on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot; alongside Billy Crystal. On 23 September 2006, during an interview on &quot;Parkinson&quot;, she revealed that she would be returning to ITV in 2007 with a new chat show called &quot;The Dame Edna Treatment&quot;. The show began on Saturday 17 March 2007, with the set-up being that Edna runs a health spa where various famous guests come for treatment.

On 17 December 2006, Dame Edna appeared as a guest panellist on the ABC TV Show &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot; where she sang with presenter Adam Hills. On 16 December 2007 she appeared as the last guest on the final episode of the &quot;Parkinson&quot; UK talk show. On 29 May 2008 she appeared on &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot; alongside Ray Mears and Alanis Morissette. On 8 August 2008 she appeared on &quot;Loose Women&quot; on the final show of that year&#x27;s series. On 12 September and 15 December 2008, and also on 27 May 2009, she made guest appearances on &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;.

Accompanied by her daughter Valmai in America and Sir Les Patterson in the UK, Dame Edna again toured with what was declared &quot;My First Last Tour&quot;. On television in early 2009, she appeared in adverts to publicise the insurance company Norwich Union&#x27;s change of name to Aviva, quoting her change of name from Mrs Everage. On 9 June 2009, she appeared as a guest on &quot;The Late Late Show&quot; with Craig Ferguson. On 17 July 2009, she appeared as a guest on &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;. On an episode of &quot;The One Show&quot; in September 2009 a piece of graffiti on Sunderland&#x27;s Penshaw Monument read &quot;Edna Woz Ere 09&quot; and a pair of Everage&#x27;s signature glasses were drawn next to it. Dame Edna performed the &quot;Last Night of the Poms&quot; at the Royal Albert Hall accompanying the Royal Philharmonic Orchestra on 15 September 2009 and on 21 September, she appeared as a guest on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;The Paul O&#x27;Grady Show&quot;.

=== 2010–2023 ===

In 2010, Dame Edna collaborated with cabaret pianist and singer Michael Feinstein for a two-person revue in the United States, titled &quot;All About Me&quot;, based on the premise that the pair were rivals who were forced to work together for the show&#x27;s sake. The show opened as the second production for the newly refurbished Henry Miller&#x27;s Theatre and was planned to run from 18 March through 18 July 2010 (with previews beginning on 22 February), but lukewarm reviews and low ticket sales led to the limited engagement being cut short and closing on 4 April 2010, after 27 previews and 20 regular performances. On 25 March 2010, she appeared on the television talk show &quot;The View&quot; as a guest host to promote the production.

On 29 April 2011 she appeared on the Channel Nine broadcast &quot;William and Kate: The Royal Wedding&quot;, with Karl Stefanovic and Lisa Wilkinson, covering the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton at Buckingham Palace, along with Tracy Grimshaw and Kathy Lette at Westminster Abbey.

On 18 March 2012, Humphries announced he would &quot;retire&quot; the Dame Edna character because he was &quot;beginning to feel a bit senior&quot;.

On 15 March 2013, Dame Edna Everage appeared on &quot;Red Nose Day 2013&quot; as a guest star and judge for the &quot;Comic Relief Does MasterChef&quot; competition between Jack Whitehall and Micky Flanagan.

In June 2013, Dame Edna returned in a Sydney Opera House production of &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;.

In 2013, Dame Edna announced her final tour of the United Kingdom. The show opened in November 2013 at the London Palladium before beginning a UK tour in January 2014.

On 11 February 2015, she appeared on &quot;The Great Comic Relief Bake Off&quot; in aid of Comic Relief.

Dame Edna&#x27;s Glorious Goodbye – The Farewell Tour began in Seattle, Washington at The Moore Theatre (15–18 January 2015) and continued on to The Ahmanson Theatre in Los Angeles (24 January 2015 through 15 March 2015) next traveling to San Francisco&#x27;s Orpheum Theater (17–22 March 2015) then on to the McCallum Theatre in Palm Desert, California (30 March 2015 – 4 April 2015) then Toronto, Ontario, Canada&#x27;s Princess of Wales Theatre (9–19 April 2015) and concluding in Washington, D.C. at the National Theatre (21–26 April 2015.)

Dame Edna was a guest on &quot;Michael McIntyre&#x27;s Big Christmas Show&quot;, broadcast by BBC1 on Christmas Day 2015.

Dame Edna appeared briefly in &quot;Absolutely Fabulous: The Movie&quot; (2016) in a non-speaking cameo, one of two characters played by Humphries in the film.

On 19 September 2019, Dame Edna appeared on the &quot;Today&quot; programme with John Humphrys. This was Humphry&#x27;s final programme as presenter.

In what would become the final appearance of the character before Humphries&#x27; death, Dame Edna returned to the BBC for a one-off special, &quot;Dame Edna Rules The Waves&quot;, in which she (belatedly) publicly acknowledged the death of Madge, first broadcast on BBC1 on 31 December 2019. During the show, Dame Edna attempts to dispose of Madge&#x27;s ashes from the porthole of her luxury yacht, The Ocean Widow, but is prevented from doing so to protect the environment. Madge&#x27;s last will and testament insisted that Dame Edna take on the care of her sister Mabel, who became Dame Edna&#x27;s silent sidekick, sticking labels on her celebrity guests. Mabel is portrayed by British actress Anne Rason.

== Satirical advice column controversy==
In 2003, &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; magazine invited Dame Edna to write a satirical advice column. She created controversy with a piece published in the February 2003 issue. Replying to a reader who asked if she should learn Spanish, she wrote:
:&quot;Forget Spanish. There&#x27;s nothing in that language worth reading except &quot;Don Quixote&quot;, and a quick listen to the CD of &quot;Man of La Mancha&quot; will take care of that ... Who speaks it that you are really desperate to talk to? The help? Your leaf blower?&quot;

Some Americans read this reply as a racist remark against Hispanics and complaints flooded in to the magazine. Actress Salma Hayek responded angrily, penning a furious letter in which she denounced Dame Edna. After &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; received death threats, the magazine published a full-page apology to the Hispanic community.

Humphries commented later: &quot;If you have to explain satire to someone, you might as well give up&quot;. When Dame Edna was questioned about the controversy on the eve of her 2003 Australian tour, she retorted that Hayek&#x27;s denunciation was due to &quot;professional jealousy&quot;, and that Hayek was envious because the role of painter Frida Kahlo, for which Hayek received an Oscar nomination, had originally been offered to Edna:

<text>Hythe () is a market town and civil parish on the edge of Romney Marsh in Kent, England. &quot;Hythe&quot; is an Old English word meaning haven or landing place.

==History==
The earliest reference to Hythe is in Domesday Book (1086) though there is evidence of the area having been settled since Roman times.

The town has mediaeval and Georgian buildings, as well as a Saxon/Norman church on the hill and a Victorian seafront promenade. Hythe was once defended by castles at Saltwood and Lympne. Hythe Town Hall, a neoclassical style building, was completed in 1794.

Hythe&#x27;s market once took place in Market Square (now Red Lion Square) close to where there is now a farmers&#x27; market every second and fourth Saturday of the month. Hythe has gardening, horse riding, bowling, tennis, cricket, football, squash and sailing clubs. Lord Deedes was once patron of Hythe Civic Society.

As an important Cinque Port, Hythe once possessed a bustling harbour which, over the course of 300 years, has now disappeared due to silting. Hythe was the central Cinque Port, sitting between Hastings and New Romney to the west and Dover and Sandwich to the east.

According to Hasted, a French fleet approached Hythe in 1293 and landed 200 men, but &quot;the townsmen came upon them and slew every one of them: upon which the rest of the fleet hoisted sail and made no further attempt&quot;.

In 1348, the Black Death afflicted Hythe, and in 1400 the plague further reduced the population.

Hythe has no coat of arms; however, the corporation seal represents an antique vessel with one mast, two men in it (one blowing a horn) and two men lying on the yard arm.

Hythe was the home of the Mackeson Brewery, which after changes of ownership, closed in 1968. It was the birthplace of Mackeson Stout, a type of beer first brewed in 1909, which went on to become a national brand. Mackeson stout is no longer brewed locally but is produced under contract by one of the major national brewers.

Hythe Ranges is a military training ground that takes up a large section of the Hythe shoreline. Access to this section of the shore is restricted when red flags are showing.

==Royal Military Canal and Martello Towers==
The Royal Military Canal runs across the northern edge of the marsh, to Winchelsea. Running under Stade Street, the canal, intended to repel invasion during the Napoleonic wars of 1804 to 1815, gives central Hythe its character. Now shaded by trees, the canal, 10 yards wide, passes into the marsh from the middle of the town. The canal begins at Seabrook and runs through Hythe. It follows the original haven that was once Hythe&#x27;s harbour as far as the light railway thence across Romney Marsh to Winchelsea. Its 26-mile length can be walked.

Also built around the same time as a defence against possible invasion by Napoleon were the Martello Towers. In total, 74 of these towers were built between Folkestone and Seaford. The walls were up to thick, and each tower held 24 men and had a huge cannon mounted on the top. They were named after a similar tower at Mortella Point in Corsica which the Navy had captured from the French. Although never needed for their original purpose they were later used to combat smuggling and also acted as signalling stations and coastal defences during the two world wars. Three of the towers survive at Hythe; one was converted to a house in the 1930s and can be seen along West Parade, and the other two are on the beach and are owned by the Ministry of Defence.

Geologically, the town developed on a succession of non-parallel terraces, rising from the level ground around the Royal Canal (previously named the Royal Military Canal) towards the steep incline upon which the parish church of St Leonard was built. From the High Street, alleys lead up to the steeper levels of the town.

==Castles at Saltwood and Lympne==
Hythe was once defended by two castles, Saltwood and Lympne. Saltwood derives its name from the village in its shadow. During the reign of King Canute the manor of Saltwood was granted to the priory of Christ Church in Canterbury, but during the 12th century it became the home of Henry d&#x27;Essex, constable of England.

Thomas Becket had sought from King Henry II restoration of the castle as an ecclesiastical palace. Henry instead granted the castle to Ranulf de Broc. That the castle had been returned to Becket, as Archbishop of Canterbury, and remained a church property until the reign of Henry VIII, when Hythe and Saltwood were to be sequestrated to the Crown, suggests that some complicity by the baron Rranulf de Broc was possible in the murder of Becket. It was during this time at Saltwood, on 28 December 1170, that four knights plotted Becket&#x27;s death the following day. Hugh de Moreville was one of the knights, along with Reginald Fitzurse, William de Tracey and Richard le Breton.

From the moment Hythe came under Crown control, the senior official of the town was also a bailiff appointed by the Crown. This state of affairs (uniquely for a Cinque Port) remained until 1575 when Elizabeth I gave the town control of its affairs. The last Crown bailiff, John Bredgman, became the first mayor. A brass inscription bearing his name remains in the parish church, dated 1581.

==Cinque port Court of Shepway==
A monumental cross now indicates what was from 1358 a meeting place of the confederation of the Cinque ports, several miles west of Hythe, known then as &quot;the Shepway crossroads&quot;. Shepway cross, erected in 1923, the monument to the Court of Shepway, is beside the Hythe to Lympne road (B2067). The lathe of Shepway was the Saxon name for south-east Kent, roughly corresponding with the modern District of Shepway, comprising Folkestone, Hythe, Romney Marsh and nearby villages as far north as Elham.

Many think this monument marks where the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports held his court for Shepway, and it is referred to as the &quot;Shepway Cross&quot;. In fact the Shepway Cross is a civic war memorial erected in 1923. It was placed on the top of Lympne Hill because that was traditionally the site of the Court of Shepway.

Shepway Cross was paid for and unveiled in August 1923 by Earl Beauchamp, the Lord Warden of the Cinque Ports. The Archbishop of Canterbury, Randall Davidson, attended the ceremony. The memorial now shows signs of decay. The lettering denoting the monument&#x27;s true purpose is hardly legible.

==School of Musketry==
The School of Musketry was established in Hythe in 1853.

==Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway==
Hythe is the northern terminus of the Romney, Hythe and Dymchurch Railway, running third-scale steam and diesel locomotives. The track runs parallel to the coast through Dymchurch and New Romney to Dungeness. The founders were Captain J Howey and Count Louis Zborowski. It opened in 1927. The trains run on a gauge of 15 inches (380 mm) and the track is nearly 14 miles (23 km) long. During the Second World War the service transported the Operation Pluto pipeline.

<text>Figeac (; ) is a commune in the southwestern French department of Lot. Figeac is a sub-prefecture of the department.

==Geography==
Figeac is on the via Podiensis, a major medieval pilgrimage trail that is part of the Camino de Santiago network. Today, as a part of France&#x27;s system of long-distance footpaths, it is known as the GR 65. Figeac station is a railway junction with connections to Brive-la-Gaillarde, Toulouse, Aurillac and Rodez.

==Population==
==Local culture and heritage==
===Places and monuments===
Figeac is classified as a city of art and history and has been recognized by the Midi-Pyrénées Regional Council as one of the eighteen Great Sites of Occitania. The old town has kept its layout and winding streets of the Middle Ages with many old sandstone houses.

====Religious heritage====
* Chapel Notre-Dame-de-Pitié de Figeac - a 13th-century building, integrated into the Église Saint-Sauveur, was classified as a historical monument in 1840.
* Chapelle de l&#x27;hôpital de Figeac.
* Église Saint-Dau de Ceint-d&#x27;Eau.

=====L’église Saint-Sauveur=====
 The building was classified as a historical monument in 1840. Several religious objects are referenced in the Base Palissy database. This church, the only remains of a Cluny abbey, was consecrated in 1092. Saint Hugh was its abbot. Although modified over the centuries, either because of embellishments or because of the damage caused by the Hundred Years&#x27; War or the French Wars of Religion, it nevertheless has survived.

It was a pilgrimage church, similar in size to Saint-Sernin de Toulouse or Abbey Church of Sainte-Foy, with a triple nave, a vast transept, an ambulatory and an apse with radiating chapels. The old chapter house is decorated with polychrome wood of the 17th century.

A capital from this church, the top part of a column, was re-cut into a font and is exhibited in New York at The Cloisters (Metropolitan Museum of Art)).

=====L&#x27;église des Carmes=====
The building was listed as a historical monument in 1993. Twelve paintings of the apostles are referenced in the Base Palissy database. Formerly Church of Saint-Thomas-Becket, it is the most modest church in size in the city. Located near the hospital, at the entrance of Figeac, it is the last witness of the former Carmelites convent that was once established there.

=====L’église Notre-Dame-du-Puy=====

The building was classified as a historical monument in 1916. Several religious objects are referenced in the Base Palissy database. The aptly named, since it dominates all Figeac, on the Place du Foirail. This church of Romanesque origin was remodelled several times, especially in the 14th and 17th centuries, when the three central bays were united into one; The choir contains beautiful carved Romanesque capitals and a large carved walnut altarpiece, dated 1696. Yet it is the oldest parish of Figeac, born, according to tradition, from a miracle: The Virgin would have made a hawthorn bloom there in winter. It was the seat of a brotherhood of St. James.

=====Museums=====
=====Musée Champollion=====
The city is home to the Champollion Museum &quot;les écritures du monde&quot; (the writings of the world). There are more than 40,000 visitors a year. Visitors can discover through the collections how writing has appeared in the world for 5,000 years.

The Champollion Museum is a major museum of the city, but there are other museums in Figeac: the Musée Paulin-Ratier, the musée de la Résistance and finally the Musée d&#x27;histoire de Figeac. The latter was redesigned in 2012 in the spirit of cabinets of curiosities, in rooms belonging to the former seminary, behind the Notre-Dame-du-Puy church.

=====La place des Écritures=====
Embedded in a medieval architectural ensemble, its floor is covered with a monumental reproduction of the Rosetta Stone (14 × 7 m), carved in black granite from Zimbabwe by the American conceptual artist Joseph Kosuth. Inaugurated in April 1991, this important contemporary work can also be contemplated from the museum&#x27;s hanging garden overlooking the square. In an adjoining courtyard, the French translation of the inscriptions is engraved on a glass plate.

=====L&#x27;obélisque de Champollion=====
On 11 March 1832, the municipal council decided to erect an obelisk in memory of Champollion. A subscription raised 4,000 francs and two years later a granite needle 7.8 meters high was extracted from the rock of Golinhac. It includes inscriptions in hieroglyphics meaning &quot;A Toujours!&quot; and two bronze plaques on the pedestal hosting Egyptian bas-reliefs.

=====Place Carnot=====
Formerly the Place de la Halle, it is surrounded by imposing houses, some made of cob, with wrought iron balconies, and under the roofs, open covered galleries, the &quot;soleilhos&quot;, which were once used to dry clothes or skins, or as a refuge to get some fresh air during a hot summer evening.

<doc id="371295" wikidata="Q3077838" url="?curid=371295" title="Lorine Niedecker">
<text>Lorine Faith Niedecker (English: pronounced Needecker; May 12, 1903 – December 31, 1970) was an American poet. Her poetry is known for its spareness, its focus on the natural landscapes of Wisconsin and the Upper Midwest (particularly waterscapes), its philosophical materialism, its mise-en-page experimentation, and its surrealism. She is regarded as a major figure in the history of American regional poetry, the Objectivist poetic movement, and the mid-20th-century American poetic avant-garde.

==Early life==
Niedecker was born on Black Hawk Island near Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin to Theresa (Daisy) (née Kunz) and Henry Niedecker and lived most of her life in rural isolation. She grew up surrounded by the sights and sounds of the river until she moved to Fort Atkinson to attend school. The environment of birds, trees, water and marsh would inform her later poetry. On graduating from high school in 1922, she went to Beloit College to study literature but left after two years because her father was no longer able to pay her tuition. She devoted herself to caring for her ailing deaf mother, who was deeply depressed by her husband&#x27;s flagrant affair with a neighbor. Niedecker and Frank Hartwig married in 1928; the relationship lasted two years. Hartwig&#x27;s fledgling road-construction business foundered during the onset of the Great Depression while Niedecker lost her job at the Fort Atkinson Library. The two separated in 1930 but were not legally divorced until 1942.

==Early writings==
Niedecker&#x27;s earliest poetry was marked by her reading of the Imagists and Surrealists. In 1931 she read the Objectivist issue of &quot;Poetry&quot;. She sent her poems to Louis Zukofsky, who had edited the issue. This was the beginning of what proved to be an important relationship for her development as a poet. Zukofsky suggested sending them to &quot;Poetry&quot;, where they were accepted for publication. Niedecker then found herself in direct contact with the American poetic &quot;avant-garde&quot;. Near the end of 1933, Niedecker visited Zukofsky in New York City for the first time and became pregnant with their child. He insisted that she have an abortion, which she did, although they remained friends and continued to carry on a mutually beneficial correspondence following Niedecker&#x27;s return to Fort Atkinson.

From the mid-1930s, Niedecker moved away from surrealism and started writing poems that engaged more directly with social and political realities and on her own immediate rural surroundings. Her first book, &quot;New Goose&quot; (1946), collected many of these poems.

==Neglect==
Niedecker was not to publish another book for fifteen years. In 1949, she began work on a poem sequence called &quot;For Paul&quot;, named for Zukofsky&#x27;s son. Unfortunately, Zukofsky was uncomfortable with what he viewed as the overly personal and intrusive nature of the content of the 72 poems she eventually collected under this title and discouraged publication. Partly because of her geographical isolation, even magazine publication was not easily available and in 1955 she claimed that she had published work only six times in the previous ten years.

==Revival==
The 1960s saw a revival of interest in Niedecker&#x27;s work. Wild Hawthorn Press and Fulcrum Press, both British-based, published books and magazine publication became regular. She was also befriended by a number of poets, including Cid Corman, Basil Bunting and several younger British and US poets who were interested in reclaiming the modernist heritage. Her books published in the last few decades of her life included &quot;My Friend Tree,&quot; &quot;T &amp; G: The Collected Poems, 1936–1966,&quot; &quot;North Central,&quot; and &quot;My Life By Water.&quot;

Encouraged by this interest, Niedecker started writing again. She had previously earned her living scrubbing hospital floors in Fort Atkinson, &quot;reading proof&quot; at a local magazine, renting cottages and living in near-poverty for years. However, her marriage in May 1963 to Albert Millen, an industrial painter at Ladish Drop Forge on Milwaukee&#x27;s south side, brought financial stability back into her life. When Millen retired in 1968, the couple moved back to Blackhawk Island, taking up residence in a small cottage Lorine had built on property she inherited from her father. The cottage, now known as the Lorine Niedecker Cottage, is listed on the National Register of Historic Places.

Niedecker died in 1970 from a cerebral hemorrhage, leaving behind several unpublished typescripts. Many other Niedecker papers were burned by Millen, who said he did so at Niedecker&#x27;s request. Her name was added to her parents&#x27; headstone which uses the original spelling of the family name, Neidecker. Lorine had her name changed to the Niedecker spelling when she was in her twenties. The primary Niedecker archives are in the Dwight Foster Public Library (which inherited Niedecker&#x27;s personal library) and the Hoard Museum in Fort Atkinson, Wisconsin (which holds a collection of Niedecker&#x27;s papers, as preserved and donated by her neighbor and close friend, Gail Roub).

Niedecker&#x27;s comprehensive &quot;Collected Works,&quot; edited by Jenny Penberthy, were published by the University of California Press in 2002. A centennial celebration of Niedecker&#x27;s life and work, held in Milwaukee and Fort Atkinson in 2003, included treks to her two Rock River-edged homes on Black Hawk Island and symposium sessions including presentations by scholars and poets. Corman, Niedecker&#x27;s literary executor who lived most of his creative life in Japan, made his last appearance in the United States during this event.

<text>The M6 Toll, referred to on some signs as the Midland Expressway (originally named the Birmingham Northern Relief Road or BNRR), and stylised as M6toll, connects M6 Junction 3a at the Coleshill Interchange to M6 Junction 11A at Wolverhampton with of six-lane motorway.

The M6 Toll is the only major toll road in Great Britain, and has two payment plazas, Great Wyrley Toll Plaza for northbound and Weeford Toll Plaza for southbound. The northbound toll plaza is situated between junctions T6 and T7, and the southbound between junctions T4 and T3. The weekday contactless card cost is £9.70 for a car and £17.20 for a Heavy Goods Vehicle.

The M6 Toll is part of the (unsigned in the UK) E-road E05 and is subject to the same regulations and policing as other motorways in the UK. It has one service station along its stretch, Norton Canes services.

==History==

===Planning and construction===
Proposals for a new publicly funded motorway were circulated in 1980. It was originally to be called the A446(M) Birmingham Northern Relief Road (BNRR) and designed to alleviate the increasing congestion on the M6 through Birmingham and the Black Country in England, as well as improving road links to neighbouring parts of Staffordshire and North Warwickshire. This was the busiest section of the M6, carrying up to 180,000 vehicles per day when it was designed to carry only 72,000.

Five alternative routes were put for consultation in 1980 and a preferred route was published in 1986. In 1989 there was a public inquiry relating to a publicly funded motorway.

In 1989 it was announced that it would be built privately and a competition took place which was won by Midland Expressway Limited in 1991. The contract was for a 53-year concession to build and operate the road as an early form of public private partnership with the operator paying for the construction and recouping its costs by setting and collecting tolls, allowing for a 3-year construction period followed by 50 years of operation. At the end of this period the infrastructure would be returned to the Government. Toll rates are set at the discretion of the operator at six-monthly intervals and there is no cap on the rates charged.

There was a second public inquiry from relating to the new scheme in 1994–1995 and a decision to go ahead in 1997. A legal challenge was made by the &quot;Alliance against BNRR&quot; which was cleared in 1998.

Midland Expressway Limited contracted out the construction of the road to a consortium of major contractors Carillion, Alfred McAlpine, Balfour Beatty and Amec (together known as CAMBBA).

Build phase

Site clearance started in 2000, major construction work began over the summer of 2002 and the road opened in December 2003.

2.5 million books, including many Mills &amp; Boon novels, were pulped and mixed into the tarmac surface to help absorb water.

In August 2003, freight operators indicated that they planned to keep their vehicles on the heavily congested M6 through Birmingham rather than send them on the new motorway due to high fees. The AA Motoring Trust said it welcomed the decision to make lorries pay a premium rate explaining that &quot;Car drivers find lorries intimidating and they frequently hold up traffic on motorways when overtaking each other.&quot;

The road was partially opened on 9 December 2003 for traffic entering from local junctions, then fully opened on 14 December 2003.

===First year of operation===
On 10 January 2004, five weeks after opening, a short section of the road near Sutton Coldfield was reduced to one lane to allow for repairs to an uneven surface.

On 23 July 2004 prices for heavy goods vehicles (HGVs) were reduced from £10 to £6 to encourage them to use the route &quot;for a trial period&quot;.

===Traffic levels===
In December 2004, one year after opening, Friends of the Earth issued a press release expressing concern that faced with lower than expected traffic numbers, Midland Expressway were trying to attract new traffic-generating developments to greenbelt and greenfield sites in the M6 Toll Corridor. and in April 2005 the Royal Institution of Chartered Surveyors reported that there was strong interest in the commercial property market place around the M6 Toll &quot;zone of influence&quot;.

In May 2005 the Macquarie Infrastructure Group reported that traffic figures were &quot;disappointing&quot;. In August 2005 the Highways Agency confirmed in its own &quot;one year&quot; study showing that usage had settled at around 50,000 vehicle per day (lower than the predicted 74,000) but that traffic volumes on the M6 had reduced slightly.

From 2008, traffic levels started to fall. Traffic in the first quarter of 2009 was 39,000 vehicles-per-day (Monday-Friday figures), but recovered to reach 54,000 in the second quarter of 2015.

===Historical toll rates===

Daytime cash / contactless card prices for various vehicle classes since opening:

There is a 5% discount for using a tag. Leasing of one tag currently costs £1.00/month. In addition, a monthly administrative fee of £2.00 is charged if the user wishes to receive a postal statement.

Exit/entry at some of the intermediate junctions away from the main toll booths entails a reduced toll, typically £1 less than the full fee.

===M6 Expressway===
There was a proposal to build a new toll motorway, called the M6 Expressway running from the end of the M6 Toll to Knutsford, where much of the traffic leaves the M6 for Manchester. It was announced on 20 July 2006 that this proposal had been abandoned due to excessive costs and anticipated construction problems.

==Tolls==

===Prices ===

From 13 May 2024. The M6 Toll is divided into three zones. Tolls depend on the number of zones entered, determined by automatic number-plate recognition (ANPR). 

===Collection===

Tolls can be paid by credit/debit card payments or in advance via an M6 Toll tag. Cash payments are not accepted.
Vehicles are classified electronically at the toll booths according to their number of wheels, number of axles and height at first axle. Thus vehicles with trailers are charged extra and some large models of 4x4 are classified as vans.

Failure to pay the toll for using the motorway is a civil offence; anyone attempting to do so will be issued with an unpaid toll notice and required to send payment. If it is not paid within two days a £10 administration charge is added, plus further costs will be added if the toll is still unpaid after 14 days.

An M6 Toll tag is an electronic toll collection device attached to a vehicle&#x27;s windscreen, which records the vehicle&#x27;s passage through toll plazas on the M6 Toll.

Each tag can only be used with the registered number plate and has a unique account. All accounts on the M6 Toll are pre-paid, and must contain a positive balance, sufficient to cover the cost of the vehicle&#x27;s toll, in order for the vehicle to be allowed through the toll gate. If the balance is sufficient, the tag will beep once and the barrier at the toll gate will automatically raise. If the balance is low (fewer than three journeys remaining), the tag will beep twice. If the balance of the account cannot cover the cost of the toll, the barrier will remain closed and an alternative method of payment must be used.
Balances can be topped up automatically once a month using Direct Debit or credit card, or by cheque.

The tags contain a microchip which uses radio-frequency identification (RFID) technology. Physically, the tag resembles a DART-Tag, previously used to pay the tolls on the Dartford Crossing. The two systems do not interoperate.

ANPR Systems

A new transformational tolling system involving Automatic Number Plate Recognition (ANPR) technology is currently being trialed on the M6toll as part of the M6toll’s Road Ahead strategy.

The ANPR cameras will identify licence plate data, removing the need for card payments at the toll plazas and replacing them with a remote payment system linked to online accounts. It will enable seamless end to end journeys and mean customers can manage all transactions via the M6toll website, whether for a single vehicle or larger fleets spread across a number of depots.

The ANPR system was Initially launched on 8 April 2021 as a pilot project for business customers, with Maritime, one of the UK’s largest logistics operators, becoming the first vehicles to pay for their journeys on the M6toll via the new tolling system.  Once the trials have been completed with Maritime and other commercial vehicle operators, the ANPR system will be rolled out to other road users.

==Traffic Levels==

Traffic levels are not published on a regular basis, but can be found in company financial reports published in press, generally around about September the following year. E.g. https://www.cityam.com/m6-toll-owner-rakes-in-the-profit-after-price-rises/ shows:
-2022 46,715
-2024 48,463

==Midland Expressway Limited==
The contract to build and operate the M6 Toll was won by Midland Expressway Limited (MEL) in 1991. In 2005 MEL reported an operating profit of around £16 million. Total revenue was £45 million, with staff and other operating costs amounting to £11.4 million and depreciation of £17.4 million. Taking into account net interest costs of around £43 million, that leaves an overall loss of £26.5 million in 2005 – their first full financial year.

As of June 2005, MEL was 100% owned by Macquarie Infrastructure Group (MIG) of Australia, which operated several tolled roads in Australia and North America. Long term debt was £819 million as of 30 June 2005. Disappointing traffic figures for 2005 led to a price rise in June, and MIG Chief Executive Steve Allen commented in the Australian newspaper &quot;The Age&quot;, &quot;What we need is to slow down the M6&quot;.

Business leaders in Staffordshire, now effectively closer to London, welcomed the opening of the road, saying that it would make it easier to do business there.

In June 2006 the decision to not increase tolls was put down to disappointing traffic levels and led to a reduction in value for the owner.

In 2010 MIG was split into two, and the M6 Toll is now managed by Macquarie Atlas Roads.

The road was sold to IFM Investors in June 2017.

==Criticisms==

===Design===
The M6 Toll lacks a proper link with the M54, which joins the M6 south of the northern end of the M6 Toll. Plans are afoot to link them eventually but for the time being traffic between the two has to use either the slow and often congested A460 to M54 J1, or go from M54 J2 via the A449 and A5 to M6 J12 – an extra 4 miles/7 km.

===Protest during planning and construction===
Environmental campaigners opposed the road, from its inception. While the road was being built, some advocates of direct action dug tunnels under Moneymore Cottage and two large underground bunkers in an adjacent wood named the Greenwood Camp. The camp was in the path of the road in order to frustrate and delay the work. Peter Faulding, a confined space rescue specialist from Specialist Group International who removed Swampy the anti-roads protester from the A30 protest and from the Newbury Bypass tunnels, was brought in to safely remove a number of protesters tunnelled deep underground. The tunnels were very complex and on different levels in Moneymore Cottage. Operation Encompass as it was called by the police was run by the Under sheriff of Staffordshire Mr John James, the eviction operation ran for fourteen days enabling construction to begin.
Friends of the Earth claimed that the road would not relieve much traffic from the West Midlands conurbation as most users using the M6 in that area began or ended their journeys within the conurbation and so the M6 Toll would offer no advantage to them. Their campaign co-ordinator for the West Midlands, Chris Crean, said that although the £900 million cost of the road had been borne by private companies, the money should have been spent on public transport.

===House of Commons Library briefing paper===
In 2017, the House of Commons Library produced a briefing paper on road tolls written by Louise Butcher, which included the M6 Toll. The paper suggested that &quot;The M6 toll road has had mixed success; it is unusual in that it is in direct competition with a free motorway running along the same route; this may account for some of the difficulties it has experienced since opening more than a decade ago.&quot;

==Features==

The M6 Toll has several intermediary junctions, and some were designed originally to limit access to discourage local traffic. Like modern toll roads in continental Europe, the M6 Toll still uses toll plazas, despite many other tolls in the UK switching to electronic toll collection (ETC) or being abolished.

The construction of the motorway threatened the restoration of the Lichfield Canal, which cut across the motorway&#x27;s route. The Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust campaigned and raised funds to build an aqueduct to carry the canal over the motorway. The aqueduct has been finished but the canal has yet to reach it, giving it an odd appearance, known to some local residents as &quot;The Climbing Lemming Bridge&quot;.

In 2014/2015 Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust received a Social Investment Business (SIB) grant of £336,000 which will enable the Trust to buy land on either side of the aqueduct and carry out the necessary work to rebuild the canal to bring the aqueduct into use.

In April 2015, Midland Expressway Limited donated £50,000 to Lichfield and Hatherton Canals Restoration Trust to honour an undertaking they made when the M6toll was built. The donation is a &quot;substantial contribution&quot; towards the cost of reinstating the Crane Brook Culvert which was removed when the motorway was built.

=== Norton Canes Motorway Services Area ===
The motorway&#x27;s only service station is situated at Norton Canes, between junctions T6 and T7. It is operated by Roadchef, which has a 25-year lease on the site and the company also uses the site as its head office.

Opened on 9 March 2004, Norton Canes services is located between junctions T6 and T7, and is positioned so that it can be accessed before reaching the main toll plaza in either direction. In 2019, the Motorway Services User Survey found that Norton Canes had the highest customer satisfaction of any motorway services in the UK. In 2021, Norton Canes was voted in the top 5 UK service stations in a Which consumer survey, and was the highest positioned Midlands based service station in the same survey.

=== Charitable Work ===
Since the road opened in 2003, M6toll’s ‘Drive for Charity’ initiative has given away more than £1 million to good causes. This has included a regular cash fund of up to £1,500 given away every month to charities, schools, sports clubs or voluntary organisations helping to enhance the lives of local people.

The M6toll also supports the Midlands Air Ambulance charity. The funding provided enabled the organisation to launch the ‘Sky Champs’ education programme, an online learning management system, and range of education packs, launched at the start of the COVID-19 pandemic as schools were heavily impacted by the national lockdown

M6toll also provides regular support to the Ride to the Wall initiative, providing free passage for bikers attending the event at the National Memorial Arboretum in October each year.

The annual ‘Ride To the Wall’ charity event attracts bikers from across the UK and overseas, all riding to the Armed Forces Memorial to pay their respects to serving and fallen service men and women to raise funds for the Arboretum.

The southernmost section of the M6 Toll, south of Junction T1, is shared by traffic using the M42. Vehicles using only this five-mile section are not charged a toll.

==Statutory instruments==
Each motorway in England requires that a legal document called a statutory instrument be published, detailing the route of the road, before it can be built. The dates given on these statutory instruments relate to when the document was published, and not when the road was built. Provided below is a list (possibly incomplete) of the statutory instruments relating to the M6 Toll.
* Statutory Instrument 1998 No. 121: The Birmingham Northern Relief Road and Connecting Roads Scheme 1998 S.I. 1998/121
* Statutory Instrument 1998 No. 124: The Birmingham Northern Relief Road Toll Order 1998 S.I. 1998/124
* Statutory Instrument 2003 No. 2186: The M6 Toll (Collection of Tolls) Regulations 2003 S.I. 2003/2186
* Statutory Instrument 2003 No. 2187: The M6 Toll Wide Load Routes (Speed Limit) Regulations 2003 S.I. 2003/2187
* Statutory Instrument 2003 No. 2188: The M6 Toll (Speed Limit) Regulations 2003 S.I. 2003/2188

<text>Sir William Halcrow (4 July 1883 – 31 October 1958) was one of the most notable English civil engineers of the 20th century, particularly renowned for his expertise in the design of tunnels and for projects during the Second World War.

==Early years==
Halcrow was born in Bishopwearmouth, Sunderland, (at 9 Shakespeare Terrace) at a time when Sunderland was the site of extensive railway and harbour developments.

He joined the London-based firm of PW and CS Meik as a pupil (coincidentally, engineering brothers Patrick Meik and Charles Meik were also born in Bishopwearmouth) in the early 1900s and one of his earliest projects was the Kinlochleven hydroelectric scheme in the Western Highlands of Scotland, where he worked as assistant resident engineer.

In 1910 he left the firm to gain overseas experience (working on construction of the King George V Dock in Singapore). During World War I, back in Scotland, he was in charge of the construction of the Invergordon naval base and for defences at Scapa Flow in the Orkney Islands.

After a brief return to Singapore to work on the Johor–Singapore Causeway (c.1919), he returned to rejoin Charles Meik and work on the design of the Lochaber hydroelectric scheme. When Meik died in 1923, the delivery of this ambitious project (which involved boring a main tunnel 5m in diameter and 24 km long under the northern edge of the Ben Nevis massif, and creating a series of dams and reservoirs) was left in Halcrow&#x27;s hands; that same year, the firm was renamed CS Meik and Halcrow.

==Wartime exploits==
His responsibilities extended to tunnels under Whitehall and tunnels for the Post Office and telecommunications.

The knowledge he had gained at Lochaber was to prove invaluable as the Second World War approached and the transport authorities sought to protect the London Underground system from flooding. He also helped design deep air raid shelters, eight of which were attached to existing stations such as Goodge Street tube station (which also housed a signals centre used by General Eisenhower to direct the D-Day landings in Normandy in 1944).

Halcrow&#x27;s expertise was also used in preparatory works at the Manod slate quarry in north Wales, used to keep treasures from the National Gallery, London safe from enemy air raids. His firm was also involved in designing the reinforced concrete caissons used for the Mulberry Harbours employed after D-Day in northern France, while his knowledge of dam construction was used by Barnes Wallis to help perfect the &#x27;bouncing bomb&#x27; used in the famous Operation Chastise or &quot;Dam Busters&quot; raids of July 1943.

==Peace-time expansion==
After the war, Halcrow&#x27;s attention once again turned to Scotland. Instead of generating power for aluminium production, the North of Scotland Hydro-Electric Board proposed a new generation of hydroelectric schemes to generate power for public consumption. The Glen Affric scheme, started in 1947, was the biggest, but there were equally impressive projects in neighbouring catchments such as Glen Garry and Glen Moriston – the latter including one of the first underground power stations in the UK – and Strathfarrar and Kilmorack.

In Wales, the Halcrow firm&#x27;s attention also turned to water supply projects. The Claerwen dam opened in 1952 and, later, the Clywedog dam, helped create reservoirs to supply the towns and cities of the English West Midlands. Halcrow was also instrumental in persuading the UK government to set up a hydraulics research laboratory at Wallingford in Oxfordshire, while his colleagues were designing railway tunnels at Potters Bar (1955) and the earlier Woodhead Tunnel (1954) and starting work on the new Victoria line underground line beneath central London.

Overseas, Halcrow led the company to work on a wide range of engineering projects, from roads, bridges and harbours in Ghana, Libya and Mozambique to dams in Venezuela and a power station in Buenos Aires.

==The Halcrow legacy==
Halcrow was knighted in 1944, and elected as President of the Institution of Civil Engineers in 1946. He retired in the late 1950s and died in Folkestone, Kent in 1958.

The firm, renamed &quot;WT Halcrow and Partners&quot; in 1941 and &quot;Sir William Halcrow and Partners&quot; in 1944, was known in the early 21st century as Halcrow Group Limited. On 10 November 2011, the firm was acquired by the American consultant CH2M Hill; in 2017 CH2M was acquired by Jacobs Engineering Group.

<text>Rebecca Mercuri is a computer scientist specializing in computer security and computer forensics. She is considered a leading expert on electronic voting systems.

== Education ==
Mercuri earned her Ph.D. from the University of Pennsylvania in 2000 after defending her thesis on electronic voting. She was a fellow at the Belfer Center for Science and International Affairs at the John F. Kennedy School of Government. From 2004–2005, she was a computer science fellow at Harvard University&#x27;s Radcliffe Institute for Advanced Study, focusing on transparency and trust in computational systems.

== Career ==
In 1981, Mercuri founded the computer security and forensics consulting company Notable Software, where she continues to work.

In 2000, Mercuri provided expert testimony to the U.S. Court of Appeals in the proceedings following the 2000 United States presidential election, and was mentioned in a brief presented to the Supreme Court for the &quot;Bush v. Gore&quot; decision. She has also provided testimony to the United States House Committee on Science, Space and Technology; the Federal Election Commission; the United States Commission on Civil Rights; the National Institute of Standards and Technology; and the Cabinet of the United Kingdom.

In 2002, Mercuri was asked to inspect the electronic voting machines that malfunctioned in the 2002 Florida gubernatorial election.

Mercuri was the author of a column called &quot;Security Watch&quot;, which was published in the &quot;Communications of the Association for Computing Machinery&quot;. She was also a contributing editor to the journal from 2002–2008.

After the 2014 security breach of the United States federal government&#x27;s Healthcare.gov website, Mercuri was noted in the media for the security audit she had performed the previous year, which had concluded that the website had security issues.

Mercuri was an expert witness for the defense in the trial of Roderick Vosburgh. Vosburgh was convicted and jailed. The case was notable for featuring as evidence images of internet-famous &quot;camgirl&quot; Loli-chan.

== Mercuri method ==
Mercuri is known for the Mercuri method, a version of a voter-verified paper audit trail. In her method, a person casts their votes on a machine which then outputs them on an enclosed paper record for verification. The electronic entry provides some of the efficiency afforded by purely electronic systems; the enclosure ensures that the votes are not electronically tampered with after being cast; and the glass safeguards the vote from being removed from the voting booth before it is deposited into the secure ballot box.

<doc id="371299" wikidata="Q839486" url="?curid=371299" title="Qualitative research">
<text>Qualitative research is a type of research that aims to gather and analyse non-numerical (descriptive) data in order to gain an understanding of individuals&#x27; social reality, including understanding their attitudes, beliefs, and motivation. This type of research typically involves in-depth interviews, focus groups, or field observations in order to collect data that is rich in detail and context. Qualitative research is often used to explore complex phenomena or to gain insight into people&#x27;s experiences and perspectives on a particular topic. It is particularly useful when researchers want to understand the meaning that people attach to their experiences or when they want to uncover the underlying reasons for people&#x27;s behavior. Qualitative methods include ethnography, grounded theory, discourse analysis, and interpretative phenomenological analysis. Qualitative research methods have been used in sociology, anthropology, political science, psychology, communication studies, social work, folklore, educational research, information science and software engineering research.

== Background ==
Qualitative research has been informed by several strands of philosophical thought and examines aspects of human life, including culture, expression, beliefs, morality, life stress, and imagination. Contemporary qualitative research has been influenced by a number of branches of philosophy, for example, positivism, postpositivism, critical theory, and constructivism. 
The historical transitions or &#x27;moments&#x27; in qualitative research, together with the notion of &#x27;paradigms&#x27; (Denzin &amp; Lincoln, 2005), have received widespread popularity over the past decades. However, some scholars have argued that the adoptions of paradigms may be counterproductive and lead to less philosophically engaged communities.

== Approaches to inquiry ==
The use of nonquantitative material as empirical data has been growing in many areas of the social sciences, including learning sciences, development psychology and cultural psychology. Several philosophical and psychological traditions have influenced investigators&#x27; approaches to qualitative research, including phenomenology, social constructionism, symbolic interactionism, and positivism.

=== Philosophical traditions ===
Phenomenology refers to the philosophical study of the structure of an individual&#x27;s consciousness and general subjective experience. Approaches to qualitative research based on constructionism, such as grounded theory, pay attention to how the subjectivity of both the researcher and the study participants can affect the theory that develops out of the research. The symbolic interactionist approach to qualitative research examines how individuals and groups develop an understanding of the world. Traditional positivist approaches to qualitative research seek a more objective understanding of the social world. Qualitative researchers have also been influenced by the sociology of knowledge and the work of Alfred Schütz, Peter L. Berger, Thomas Luckmann, and Harold Garfinkel.

=== Sources of data ===
Qualitative researchers use different sources of data to understand the topic they are studying. These data sources include interview transcripts, videos of social interactions, notes, verbal reports and artifacts such as books or works of art. The case study method exemplifies qualitative researchers&#x27; preference for depth, detail, and context. Data triangulation is also a strategy used in qualitative research. Autoethnography, the study of self, is a qualitative research method in which the researcher uses his or her personal experience to understand an issue.

Grounded theory is an inductive type of research, based on (&quot;grounded&quot; in) a very close look at the empirical observations a study yields. Thematic analysis involves analyzing patterns of meaning. Conversation analysis is primarily used to analyze spoken conversations. Biographical research is concerned with the reconstruction of life histories, based on biographical narratives and documents. Narrative inquiry studies the narratives that people use to describe their experience.

== Data collection ==
Qualitative researchers may gather information through observations, note-taking, interviews, focus groups (group interviews), documents, images and artifacts.

===Interviews===
Research interviews are an important method of data collection in qualitative research. An interviewer is usually a professional or paid researcher, sometimes trained, who poses questions to the interviewee, in an alternating series of usually brief questions and answers, to elicit information. Compared to something like a written survey, qualitative interviews allow for a significantly higher degree of intimacy, with participants often revealing personal information to their interviewers in a real-time, face-to-face setting. As such, this technique can evoke an array of significant feelings and experiences within those being interviewed. Sociologists Bredal, Stefansen and Bjørnholt identified three &quot;participant orientations&quot;, that they described as &quot;telling for oneself&quot;, &quot;telling for others&quot; and &quot;telling for the researcher&quot;. They also proposed that these orientations implied &quot;different ethical contracts between the participant and researcher&quot;.

=== Participant observation ===
In participant observation ethnographers get to understand a culture by directly participating in the activities of the culture they study. Participant observation extends further than ethnography and into other fields, including psychology. For example, by training to be an EMT and becoming a participant observer in the lives of EMTs, Palmer studied how EMTs cope with the stress associated with some of the gruesome emergencies they deal with.

=== Recursivity ===
In qualitative research, the idea of recursivity refers to the emergent nature of research design. In contrast to standardized research methods, recursivity embodies the idea that the qualitative researcher can change a study&#x27;s design during the data collection phase.

Recursivity in qualitative research procedures contrasts to the methods used by scientists who conduct experiments. From the perspective of the scientist, data collection, data analysis, discussion of the data in the context of the research literature, and drawing conclusions should be each undertaken once (or at most a small number of times). In qualitative research however, data are collected repeatedly until one or more specific stopping conditions are met, reflecting a nonstatic attitude to the planning and design of research activities. An example of this dynamism might be when the qualitative researcher unexpectedly changes their research focus or design midway through a study, based on their first interim data analysis. The researcher can even make further unplanned changes based on another interim data analysis. Such an approach would not be permitted in an experiment. Qualitative researchers would argue that recursivity in developing the relevant evidence enables the researcher to be more open to unexpected results and emerging new constructs.

== Data analysis ==

Qualitative researchers have a number of analytic strategies available to them.

=== Coding ===

In general, coding refers to the act of associating meaningful ideas with the data of interest. In the context of qualitative research, interpretative aspects of the coding process are often explicitly recognized and articulated; coding helps to produce specific words or short phrases believed to be useful abstractions from the data.

===Pattern thematic analysis===
Data may be sorted into patterns for thematic analyses as the primary basis for organizing and reporting the study findings.

===Content analysis===
According to Krippendorf, &quot;Content analysis is a research technique for making replicable and valid inference from data to their context&quot; (p. 21). It is applied to documents and written and oral communication. Content analysis is an important building block in the conceptual analysis of qualitative data. It is frequently used in sociology. For example, content analysis has been applied to research on such diverse aspects of human life as changes in perceptions of race over time, the lifestyles of contractors, and even reviews of automobiles.

== Issues ==
=== Computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software (CAQDAS) ===
Contemporary qualitative data analyses can be supported by computer programs (termed computer-assisted qualitative data analysis software). These programs have been employed with &quot;or&quot; without detailed hand coding or labeling. Such programs do not supplant the interpretive nature of coding. The programs are aimed at enhancing analysts&#x27; efficiency at applying, retrieving, and storing the codes generated from reading the data. Many programs enhance efficiency in editing and revising codes, which allow for more effective work sharing, peer review, data examination, and analysis of large datasets.

Common qualitative data analysis software includes:

* ATLAS.ti
* Dedoose (mixed methods)
* MAXQDA (mixed methods)
* NVivo
* QDA MINER

A criticism of quantitative coding approaches is that such coding sorts qualitative data into predefined (nomothetic) categories that are reflective of the categories found in objective science. The variety, richness, and individual characteristics of the qualitative data are reduced or, even, lost.

To defend against the criticism that qualitative approaches to data are too subjective, qualitative researchers assert that by clearly articulating their definitions of the codes they use and linking those codes to the underlying data, they preserve some of the richness that might be lost if the results of their research boiled down to a list of predefined categories. Qualitative researchers also assert that their procedures are repeatable, which is an idea that is valued by quantitatively oriented researchers.

Sometimes researchers rely on computers and their software to scan and reduce large amounts of qualitative data. At their most basic level, numerical coding schemes rely on counting words and phrases within a dataset; other techniques involve the analysis of phrases and exchanges in analyses of conversations. A computerized approach to data analysis can be used to aid content analysis, especially when there is a large corpus to unpack.

===Trustworthiness===
A central issue in qualitative research is trustworthiness (also known as credibility or, in quantitative studies, validity). There are many ways of establishing trustworthiness, including member check, interviewer corroboration, peer debriefing, prolonged engagement, negative case analysis, auditability, confirmability, bracketing, and balance. Data triangulation and eliciting examples of interviewee accounts are two of the most commonly used methods of establishing the trustworthiness of qualitative studies.
Transferability of results has also been considered as an indicator of validity.

===Limitations of qualitative research===
Qualitative research is not without limitations. These limitations include participant reactivity, the potential for a qualitative investigator to over-identify with one or more study participants, &quot;the impracticality of the Glaser-Strauss idea that hypotheses arise from data unsullied by prior expectations,&quot; the inadequacy of qualitative research for testing cause-effect hypotheses, and the Baconian character of qualitative research. Participant reactivity refers to the fact that people often behave differently when they know they are being observed. Over-identifying with participants refers to a sympathetic investigator studying a group of people and ascribing, more than is warranted, a virtue or some other characteristic to one or more participants. Compared to qualitative research, experimental research and certain types of nonexperimental research (e.g., prospective studies), although not perfect, are better means for drawing cause-effect conclusions.

Glaser and Strauss, influential members of the qualitative research community, pioneered the idea that theoretically important categories and hypotheses can emerge &quot;naturally&quot; from the observations a qualitative researcher collects, provided that the researcher is not guided by preconceptions. The ethologist David Katz wrote &quot;a hungry animal divides the environment into edible and inedible things...Generally speaking, objects change...according to the needs of the animal.&quot; Karl Popper carrying forward Katz&#x27;s point wrote that &quot;objects can be classified and can become similar or dissimilar, only in this way--by being related to needs and interests. This rule applied not only to animals but also to scientists.&quot; Popper made clear that observation is always selective, based on past research and the investigators&#x27; goals and motives and that preconceptionless research is impossible.

The Baconian character of qualitative research refers to the idea that a qualitative researcher can collect enough observations such that categories and hypotheses will emerge from the data. Glaser and Strauss developed the idea of theoretical sampling by way of collecting observations until &quot;theoretical saturation&quot; is obtained and no additional observations are required to understand the character of the individuals under study. Bertrand Russell suggested that there can be no orderly arrangement of observations such that a hypothesis will jump out of those ordered observations; some provisional hypothesis usually guides the collection of observations.

==In psychology==

=== Community psychology ===
Autobiographical narrative research has been conducted in the field of community psychology. A selection of autobiographical narratives of community psychologists can be found in the book &quot;Six Community Psychologists Tell Their Stories: History, Contexts, and Narrative&quot;.

===Educational psychology===
Edwin Farrell used qualitative methods to understand the social reality of at-risk high school students. Later he used similar methods to understand the reality of successful high school students who came from the same neighborhoods as the at-risk students he wrote about in his previously mentioned book.

===Health psychology===
In the field of health psychology, qualitative methods have become increasingly employed in research on understanding health and illness and how health and illness are socially constructed in everyday life. Since then, a broad range of qualitative methods have been adopted by health psychologists, including discourse analysis, thematic analysis, narrative analysis, and interpretative phenomenological analysis. In 2015, the journal &quot;Health Psychology&quot; published a special issue on qualitative research.

===Industrial and organizational psychology===
According to Doldor and colleagues organizational psychologists extensively use qualitative research &quot;during the design and implementation of activities like organizational change, training needs analyses, strategic reviews, and employee development plans.&quot;

===Occupational health psychology===
Although research in the field of occupational health psychology (OHP) has predominantly been quantitatively oriented, some OHP researchers have employed qualitative methods. Qualitative research efforts, if directed properly, can provide advantages for quantitatively oriented OHP researchers. These advantages include help with (1) theory and hypothesis development, (2) item creation for surveys and interviews, (3) the discovery of stressors and coping strategies not previously identified, (4) interpreting difficult-to-interpret quantitative findings, (5) understanding why some stress-reduction interventions fail and others succeed, and (6) providing rich descriptions of the lived lives of people at work. Some OHP investigators have united qualitative and quantitative methods within a single study (e.g., Elfering et al., [2005]); these investigators have used qualitative methods to assess job stressors that are difficult to ascertain using standard measures and well validated standardized instruments to assess coping behaviors and dependent variables such as mood.

=== Social media psychology ===
Since the advent of social media in the early 2000s, formerly private accounts of personal experiences have become widely shared with the public by millions of people around the world. Disclosures are often made openly, which has contributed to social media&#x27;s key role in movements like the #metoo movement.

The abundance of self-disclosure on social media has presented an unprecedented opportunity for qualitative and mixed methods researchers; mental health problems can now be investigated qualitatively more widely, at a lower cost, and with no intervention by the researchers. To take advantage of these data, researchers need to have mastered the tools for conducting qualitative research.
