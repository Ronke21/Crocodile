<text>Agra ( ; ) is a city on the banks of the Yamuna river in the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh, about south-east of the national capital Delhi and 330 km west of the state capital Lucknow. With a population of roughly 1.6 million, Agra is the fourth-most populous city in Uttar Pradesh and twenty-third most populous city in India.

Agra&#x27;s notable historical period began during Sikandar Lodi&#x27;s reign, but the golden age of the city began with the Mughals in the early 16th century. Agra was the foremost city of the Indian subcontinent and the capital of the Mughal Empire under Mughal emperors Babur, Humayun, Akbar, Jahangir and Shah Jahan. Under Mughal rule, Agra became a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion, and saw the construction of the Agra Fort, Sikandra and Agra&#x27;s most prized monument, the Taj Mahal, constructed between 1632 and 1648 by Shah Jahan in remembrance of his wife Mumtaz Mahal. With the decline of the Mughal empire in the late 18th century, the city fell successively first to Marathas and later to the East India Company. After Independence, Agra has developed into an industrial town, with a booming tourism industry, along with footwear, leather and other manufacturing. The Taj Mahal and the Agra Fort are UNESCO World Heritage Sites. The city features mild winters, hot and dry summers and a monsoon season, and is famous for its Mughlai cuisine. Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Jaipur; and the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, a tourist circuit of Uttar Pradesh, along with Lucknow and Varanasi.

== Name ==
The name Agra is explained by different derivations, all of which have low verifiability. The most accepted one is that it had its origin from the Hindi word &quot;agar&quot; meaning salt-pan, a name which was given to it because the soil in the region is brackish and salt used to be made here once by evaporation. Others derive it from Hindu History claiming that the Sanskrit word &quot;agra&quot; () which means the first of the many groves and little forests where Krishna frolicked with the &quot;gopis&quot; of Vrindavan. The term &quot;Agravana&quot; hence means grove forest.

Agra was also known as Akbarabad in the Mughal era. The name was coined by the emperor Shah Jahan, in honour of his grandfather Akbar.

== History ==

=== Pre-Mughal era ===
Agra has two histories: one of the ancient city on the east, or left, bank of the river Yamuna, going back so far as to be lost in the legends of Krishna and Mahabharata and reestablished by Sikandar Lodhi in 1504–1505; the other of the modern city, founded by Akbar in 1558, on the right bank of the river which is associated with the Mughals, and known throughout the world as the city of the Taj. Of ancient Agra little now remains except few traces of the foundations. It was a place of importance under various Hindu dynasties previous to the Muslim invasions of India, but its history is unclear, and possess little historical interest. The 17th century chronicler named Abdullah said it was a village before the reign of Sikandar Lodi. The king of Mathura had used the Agra fort as a jail. The degradation in the status of the site was a result of the destruction brought upon it by Mahmud of Ghazni. Masud Sa&#x27;d Salman claims to have been there when Mahmud assaulted Agra, claiming the Raja Japal surrendered after seeing a nightmare. Mahmud however proceeds to pillage the city.
Agra&#x27;s period of historical importance began during Sikandar Lodi&#x27;s reign. In 1504–1505, Sultan Sikandar Lodi (reigned 1489–1517), the Afghan ruler of the Delhi Sultanate, rebuilt Agra and made it the seat of government. Sikandar Lodhi appointed a commission which inspected and surveyed both sides of the Yamuna from Delhi to Etawah and finally chose a place on the left bank, or the east side of the Yamuna, as the site for the city. Agra on the left bank of the Yamuna grew into a large flourishing town with royal presence, officials, merchants, scholars, theologians and artists. The city became one of the most important centres of Islamic learning in India. The sultan founded the village of Sikandra in the northern suburbs of the city and built there a &quot;Baradari&quot; of red sandstone in 1495, which was converted into a tomb by Jahangir, and now stands as the Tomb of Mariam-uz-Zamani, Akbar&#x27;s empress.

After the Sultan&#x27;s death in 1517, the city passed on to his son, Sultan Ibrahim Lodi (reigned 1517–26). He ruled his sultanate from Agra until he was defeated and killed by Mughal Emperor Babur in the First battle of Panipat, fought in 1526.

=== Mughal era ===

The golden age of the city began with the Mughals. Agra was the foremost city of the subcontinent and the capital of the Mughal Empire until 1658, when Aurangzeb shifted the entire court to Delhi.

Babur (reigned 1526–30), the founder of the Mughal dynasty, acquired Agra after defeating the Lodhis and the Tomaras of Gwalior in the First Battle of Panipat in 1526. Babur&#x27;s connection with Agra began immediately after the battle of Panipat. He sent forward his son Humayun, who occupied the town without opposition. The Raja of Gwalior, slain at Panipat, had left his family and the heads of his clan at Agra. In gratitude to Humayun, who treated them magnanimously, and protected them from plunder, they presented to him a quantity of jewels and precious stones as a token of homage. Among these was the famous diamond Koh-i-nur. Babur went on to lay out the first formal Mughal garden in India, the Aram Bagh (or Garden of Relaxation) on the banks of the river Yamuna. Babur was determined to establish the seat of his government at Agra, but was almost dissuaded by the desolate appearance of the region, as clear from this quote from his memoir &quot;Baburnama&quot;:

Very few vestiges remain of Babur&#x27;s city, of his fruit and flower gardens, palaces, baths, tanks, wells and watercourses. The remnants of Babur&#x27;s &quot;Charbagh&quot; can be seen today at Aram Bagh, on the east side of Yamuna. Babur was followed by his son Humayun (reigned 1530–40 and 1555–56), but he was completely defeated at Kanauj in 1539, just nine years after his ascension, by Sher Shah Suri, an Afghan nobleman, who had submitted to Babur, but revolted against his son. In this brief interruption in Mughal rule between 1540 and 1556, Sher Shah Suri, established the short lived Sur Empire, and the region was eventually reconquered by Akbar in the Second Battle of Panipat in 1556.

Under Akbar (reigned 1556–1605), and followed by his grandson Shah Jahan, Agra was immortalised in the history of the world. Akbar built the modern city of Agra on the right bank of Yamuna, where the majority of its part still lies. He converted the city into a great centre of political, cultural and economic importance, connecting it with the various parts of his vast empire. Akbar raised the towering ramparts of the Agra Fort, besides making Agra a centre for learning, arts, commerce, and religion. Akbar also built a new capital city of Fatehpur Sikri, around 35 km from Agra. The new capital city was later abandoned. Before his death, Agra had become probably one of the biggest cities in the east, with huge amounts of trade and commerce happening through its &quot;bazaars&quot;. The English traveller Ralph Fitch who visited Agra in September 1585 in the life-time of Akbar, writes about the town:

These impressions of Fitch are corroborated by another European traveller, William Finch, who remarked about Agra:

Agra continued to expand and flourish during Akbar&#x27;s successor Jahangir&#x27;s reign as he wrote in his autobiography &quot;Tuzuk-e-Jahangiri&quot;:

Akbar&#x27;s successor Jahangir (reigned 1605–27) had a love of flora and fauna and laid many gardens inside the Red Fort. Akbar&#x27;s mausoleum at Sikandra was completed during Jahangir&#x27;s reign. The Jahangiri Mahal in Agra fort and the tomb of Itmad-ud-daulah were also constructed during the reign of Jahangir. Jahangir loved Lahore and Kashmir more than Agra, but the latter continued to be the first city of the realm. It was, however, Shah Jahan (reigned 1628–58) whose building activity raised Agra to the pinnacle of its glory. Shah Jahan, known for his keen interest in architecture, gave Agra its most prized monument, the Taj Mahal. Built in loving memory of his wife Mumtaz Mahal, the mausoleum was completed in 1653. The Jama Masjid and several other notable buildings like the Diwan-i-Am, the Diwan-i-Khas, the Moti Masjid, etc., inside the fort were planned and executed under his orders.

Shah Jahan later shifted the capital to Shahjahanabad (now known as Delhi) in the year 1648, followed by his son Aurangzeb (reigned 1658–1707) moving the entire court to Delhi in 1658. With this Agra began rapidly declining. Nevertheless, the cultural and strategic importance of Agra remained unaffected and in official correspondence it continued to be referred to as the second capital of the empire.

=== Later periods ===
The decline of the Mughal empire caused the emergence of several regional kingdoms, and in the late 18th century the control of the city fell successively to the Jats, the Marathas, the Mughals, the ruler of Gwalior, and finally the British East India Company. The Jats of Bharatpur, waged many wars against the Mughal Delhi and in the 17th and 18th century carried out numerous campaigns in Mughal territories including Agra. After the decline of the Mughal Empire, the city came under the influence of another post-Mughal Empire power, the Marathas, before falling into the hands of the British East India Company in 1803. In the years 1834–1836, Agra was the capital of the short-lived Presidency of Agra, administered by a Governor. It was then the capital of the North-Western Province from 1836 to 1858, governed by a Lieutenant-Governor. Agra was one of the centres of the Indian rebellion of 1857.

During the Indian rebellion of 1857, when East India Company rule across many parts of India was threatened, the news of the mutiny at Meerut reached Agra on 14 May. On 30 May some companies of the 44th and 67th Native Infantry sent to Mathura to bring in the treasury mutinied and carried off the treasury to the rebels in Delhi. With the fear of the rebellion spreading to Agra as well, the rest of these native infantry battalions, which were part of the garrison at Agra, were successfully disarmed by the British on 31 May. However, when the Gwalior contingent mutinied on 15 June, all other native units followed. On 2 July the rebel force of the Nimach and Nasirabad contingents reached Fatehpur Sikri. Fearing advance of the mutineers to Agra, some 6000 Europeans and associated people moved into the Agra Fort for safety on 3 July. On 5 July, the British force stationed there attempted to attack an approaching force of Mutineers, but was defeated, and the British retreated back into the fort. The Lieutenant-Governor, J.R. Colvin, died there, and was later buried in front of the Diwan-i-am. The mutineers, however, moved over to Delhi, it being a more important attraction for the rebels. Despite an uprising by a mob and extreme disorder in the city, the British managed to restore partial order by 8 July. Delhi, in turn, fell to the British in September, following which an infantry brigade led by Brigadier Edward Greathed arrived in Agra on 11 October without any opposition from rebels. But shortly after their arrival another force of mutineers attacked the brigade by surprise, but was defeated and routed. This minor victory for the British was named the Battle of Agra. It is to be said that, the uprising in Agra was relatively minor compared to Delhi, Jhansi, Meerut and other major rebellious cities and regions. After this British rule was again secured, and the British Raj ruled the city till the independence of India in 1947. The capital of the North Western Provinces was shifted from Agra to Allahabad in 1858. Gradually, Agra declined to the position of a mere provincial town, and its prosperity declined:

Agra&#x27;s role in the Indian Independence movement is not well documented. However, in the years between the mutiny and independence Agra was a major centre of Hindi and Urdu journalism. Paliwal park(formerly Hewitt park) in Agra is named after S.K.D Paliwal, who brought out the Hindi daily &quot;Sainik&quot;.

=== Post Independence and Mughal legacy ===
Post India&#x27;s independence, Agra has been a part of Uttar Pradesh and has gradually developed into an industrial city, with a significant contribution to Uttar Pradesh&#x27;s economy. The city is now a popular tourist destination and hosts tourists from across the world. The Taj Mahal and Agra Fort received UNESCO World Heritage Sites status in 1983. The Taj Mahal witnesses tourists, photographers, historians and archaeologists in massive numbers all around the year. The Taj Mahal has become a symbol of India. Post Independence, Taj Mahal has been visited by world leaders like US Presidents Dwight D. Eisenhower (1959), Bill Clinton (2000), and Donald Trump (2020). Queen Elizabeth II of the United Kingdom had visited Taj Mahal in 1961 on her India visit. Taj Mahal has also been visited by Russian President Vladimir Putin (1999), Chinese President Hu Jintao (2006), Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu (2018) and Canadian Prime Minister Justin Trudeau (2018). Agra is the birthplace of the now extinct religion known as Din-i-Ilahi, which was founded by Akbar and also of the Radhaswami Faith, which has around two million followers worldwide. Agra is included on the Golden Triangle tourist circuit, along with Delhi and Jaipur; and the Uttar Pradesh Heritage Arc, a tourist circuit of Uttar Pradesh, along with Lucknow and Varanasi.

== Geography and climate ==
=== Geography ===
The region around Agra consists almost entirely of a level plain, with hills in the extreme southwest. The rivers in the region include Yamuna and Chambal. The region is also watered by the Agra Canal. Millet, barley, wheat and cotton are among the crops grown in the surrounding countryside. Both Rabi and Kharif crops are cultivated. The deserted city of Fatehpur Sikri is about 40 km southwest of Agra. The sandstone hills near Fatehpur Sikri and on the south-eastern borders of the district are offshoots from the Vindhya range of Central India. Agra is about 210 km away from the National capital of New Delhi (via Yamuna Expressway), about 336 km from state capital Lucknow (via Agra-Lucknow Expressway), and about 227 km from Kanpur (via Agra-Lucknow Expressway). The city has an average elevation of 170 metres above sea level.

===Climate===

Broadly speaking, the climate of Agra is classified as &quot;BSh&quot; by the Köppen-Geiger climate classification system. This is the tropical and subtropical steppe climate, a major climate type of the Köppen classification that occurs primarily on the periphery of the true deserts in low-latitude regions, forming a transition between the desert climate (&quot;BW&quot;), and the more humid subtropical and tropical climates.

The city features warm winters, sweltering and dry summers and a monsoon season. The Agra district, from its proximity to the sandy Thar Desert to the west, is relatively dry, and has greater extremes of temperature than districts further east. The hot west wind, &quot;Loo&quot; blows mainly during April, May, and June with great force and can cause fatal heatstrokes. The highest temperature ever registered in Agra was 48.6 °C, on 28 May 2024. The monsoon rains usually begin in the first week in July; and generally end in mid-September. However, the monsoons, though substantial in Agra, are not quite as heavy as the monsoon in other parts of India. The weather moderates by the middle of October. The region around Agra, the northwest Indo-Gangetic plain is prone to extreme fog in the winter months, which is caused due to natural factors like low winds, low temperatures, availability of moisture apart from air pollution. This phenomenon often leads to big delays and sometimes cancellation of trains due to poor visibility. Agra has high levels of air pollution and one of the worst AQIs in India. In a study conducted by WHO using data from years 2010–2016, Agra ranked as the 8th most polluted city in India, along with other nearby cities including Delhi, Kanpur and Faridabad.

Agra has been ranked 3rd best “National Clean Air City” (under Category 1&gt;10L Population cities) in India according to &#x27;Swachh Vayu Survekshan 2024 Results&#x27;

=== Environment ===
The Taj Mahal has faced significant damage due to air pollution and sewage discharge into the nearby Yamuna river. The white-marble Taj Mahal is turning yellow and green because of filthy air in the world&#x27;s eighth-most polluted city. The Taj Mahal flanks the garbage-strewn Yamuna river and is often enveloped by dust and smog from smokestacks and vehicles.

The Yamuna River is one of the most polluted rivers in the world. Agra is the second largest contributor to River Yamuna&#x27;s pollution, after Delhi. The river&#x27;s pollution has caused several problems for the Taj Mahal such as &#x27;Attacks by Bugs and their Green Slime&#x27;, foul stench and corrosion of Taj Mahal&#x27;s foundation. The river has as many as 90 &quot;nalas&quot; or drains opening into it. Though the municipality has claimed to stop 40 of these drains, the bigger ones, &quot;Bhairon&quot;, &quot;Mantola&quot;, &quot;Balkeshwar&quot; &quot;nalas&quot; continue to discharge huge quantities of untreated waste water without any check. Activists say that the Yamuna river bed between Itmad-ud-Daula and the Taj Mahal has become a dumping ground for pollutants. Polythene, plastic waste, leather cuttings from shoe factories, construction material, are all thrown into the river.

Less than 7% of the Agra district is under forest cover. The only major wildlife sanctuary near Agra is Keetham Lake, also known as Sur Sarovar Bird Sanctuary. The lake has nearly two dozen varieties of migratory and resident birds. Within the Sur Sarovar Bird Sanctuary is the Agra Bear Rescue Facility, which is India&#x27;s first sanctuary for &#x27;dancing&#x27; bears. Operated by Wildlife SOS, Free the Bears Fund and others, the facility has rehabilitate over 620 sloth bears, which were exploited by a nomadic tribe known as the Kalandars as &#x27;dancing bears&#x27;, despite the practice being illegal since 1972.

== Administration and politics ==
=== Administration ===
==== Police administration ====

Agra district comes under the Agra Police Zone and Agra Police Range, Agra Zone is headed by an additional director general (ADG)-ranked Indian Police Service (IPS) officer, and the Agra Range is headed by a deputy inspector general (DIG)-ranked IPS officer.

The district police is headed by a senior superintendent of police (SSP), who is an IPS officer, and is assisted by six superintendents of police or additional superintendents of police for city, east, west, crime, traffic, and protocol, either from the IPS or the Provincial Police Service. Each of the several police circles is headed by a circle officer in the rank of deputy superintendent of police.

==== Infrastructure and civic administration ====
Agra Municipal Corporation or Agra Nagar Nigam (AMC or ANN) is the Municipal Corporation responsible for the civic infrastructure and administration of the city of Agra. This civic administrative body administers the city&#x27;s public services. The mayor and municipal councillors are elected to five-year terms. The Agra Municipal Corporation oversees four zones (Hariparvat, Lohamandi, Tajganj and Chhata) which are further subdivided into 100 wards. The AMC boundary encompasses an area of 121 square km. The Agra Development Authority (ADA), is develops new housing, infrastructure and colonies in the city.

=== Politics ===
Agra district has two Lok Sabha constituencies, Agra and Fatehpur Sikri, and nine Uttar Pradesh Vidhan Sabha (Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly) constituencies. The MP for Agra constituency is SP Singh Baghel, from Bharatiya Janata Party. Ahead of the election the for 2022 Uttar Pradesh Legislative Assembly, it was announced that two more districts, including Agra, could become a police commissionerate before the elections.

== Utilities ==
The electricity power distribution and bill collection in Agra is the responsibility of Torrent Power, a private sector company as well as DVVNL (Dakshinanchal Vidhyut Vitran Nigam Limited), a state owned entity of UPPCL. The control of power distribution in Agra was handed over to Torrent Power from the state-owned UP Power Corporation Ltd in 2010, in an effort to move towards power reforms and cutting the massive distribution losses in the state. This was the first time power distribution was privatised in Uttar Pradesh, except for Noida-Greater Noida falling under the NCR.

Agra has three primary sources for municipal water supply: water treatment plants at Sikandra and Jeoni Mandi, and groundwater using tubewells. Since a large portion of the water demand is fulfilled from the Yamuna river, which is a highly polluted river, water quality in Agra is usually poor, with unhealthy levels of chlorine required for purification. The city&#x27;s groundwater is also unfit for drinking, and is saline and high in fluoride content. Both sources breach CPCB standards. To provide the city with adequate water supply, the Gangajal pipeline project has been initiated. It includes a 130 km long pipeline laid to bring Ganga water from Bulandshahr&#x27;s Upper Ganga canal to Agra. The project has been launched, but has faced criticism due to frequent pipeline leakages.

Though most of the city uses cylinders for cooking gas, piped natural gas is also available in many localities, including Kamla Nagar, Sikandra and others. The service is provided by Green Gas Limited.

== Economy==
Due to the presence of the Taj Mahal and other historic monuments, Agra has a booming tourism industry as well as royal crafts like &quot;Pietra Dura&quot;, marble inlay and carpets.

40% of the population depends largely on agriculture, and others on the leather and footwear business and iron foundries. Agra was the second most self-employed in India in 2007, behind Varanasi, followed by Bhopal, Indore and Patna. According to the National Sample Survey Organization, in 1999–2000, 431 of every 1,000 employed males were self-employed in the city, which grew to 603 per 1,000 in 2004–05.

Tourism has a significant role in the economy of Agra, with upwards of 9.5 million tourists visiting Agra and surrounding monuments in 2019. The city is home to Asia&#x27;s largest spa called Kaya Kalp – The Royal Spa, at the ITC Hotel Mughal in Agra. Other hotels include Taj Hotel and Convention Centre.

Sanjay Place is the trade centre of Agra. There are about 12 major and medium scale industries, producing electrical goods, pipes, leather goods etc. There are about 7,200 small scale industrial units. Above 1.5 lakh pairs of shoes per day are manufactured in Agra by the various footwear units. Agra city is also known for its leather goods, the oldest and famous leather firm Taj Leather World is in Sadar bazar. The carpets, handicrafts, &quot;zari and zardozi&quot; (embroidery work), marble and stone carving and inlay work.

Agra amassed a GDP of 40.21 billions / 40,210 crores as per the data released by UP Government for the year 2018–19, thus the 3rd rank in the state.

In the Swachh Survekshan 2020, Agra ranked 16th nation-wide, and 2nd in the state after Lucknow, which was a big jump after 86th in 2019, 102nd in 2018, and 263rd in 2017. In the Smart city Rankings, which are pan-India rankings for 100 cities which is released by the Ministry of Housing and Urban Affairs based on the progress/completion rate of Smart City projects, Agra ranked 1st, based on the rankings released based on work done by department concerned under the Smart City project from 1 October 2019, to 1 March 2020.

As of August 2020, Industrial activity in Agra has been affected as a result of the restrictions imposed due to the COVID-19 pandemic that has forced people to remain confined to their homes. The sectors worst-hit are the iron foundries, tourism, leather shoe industry in Agra. It is estimated that the loss in the tourism industry due to COVID-19 restrictions is approximately ₹ 22 billions / 2,200 crores.

== Monuments and architecture ==
===Taj Mahal===

Taj Mahal is a mausoleum complex in Agra, built by the Mughal emperor Shah Jahan as a tomb for his wife Mumtaz Mahal (&quot;Chosen One of the Palace&quot;), who died in childbirth in 1631, having been the emperor&#x27;s inseparable companion since their marriage in 1612. India&#x27;s most famed building, it is situated in the eastern part of the city on the southern (right) bank of the Yamuna River, about 1.6 km east of the Agra Fort, also on the right bank of the Yamuna. The Taj Mahal is distinguished as the finest example of Mughal architecture, a blend of Indian, Persian, and Islamic styles. Other attractions include twin mosque buildings (placed symmetrically on either side of the mausoleum), pleasant gardens, and a museum. The complex was designated a UNESCO World Heritage site in 1983, and is one of the New Seven Wonders of the world. The Taj Mahal is the most visited tourist spot in the India, attracting nearly 6.9 million visitors in 2018–19.

The chief architect was probably the Persian architect Ustad Ahmad Lahori. Designed as a unified entity according to the principles of Mughal architecture, the five principal elements of the complex were the main gateway, garden, mosque, &quot;jawab&quot; (literally &#x27;answer&#x27;, a building mirroring the mosque), and the mausoleum, with its four minarets. The construction commenced in 1632 with upwards of twenty thousand workers from India, Persia, the Ottoman Empire, and Europe working to complete the mausoleum itself by 1639, the adjunct buildings by 1643, with decoration work continuing until at least 1647. In total, construction of the 42 acre (17 hectare) complex spanned 22 years.

It can be observed from Agra Fort from where Emperor Shah Jahan gazed at it for the last eight years of his life, a prisoner of his son Aurangzeb. Verses of the Quran are inscribed on it and at the top of the gate are 22 small domes, signifying the number of years the monument took to build. The Taj Mahal was built on a marble platform that stands above a sandstone one. The most elegant and largest dome of the Taj Mahal has a diameter of , and has a height of ; directly under this dome is the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal. Shah Jahan&#x27;s tomb was erected next to hers by his son Aurangzeb. The interiors are decorated with fine &quot;pietra dura&quot; inlay work, incorporating semi-precious stones.

However, air pollution caused by emissions from foundries and other nearby factories and exhaust from motor vehicles has damaged the Taj, notably its marble facade. A number of measures have been taken to reduce the threat to the monument, among them the closing of some foundries and the installation of pollution-control equipment at others, the creation of a parkland buffer zone around the complex, and the banning of nearby vehicular traffic, and more recently, use of &#x27;mud pack&#x27; therapy. Perhaps most importantly, the Taj Trapezium Zone has been created around the Taj Mahal and other nearby monuments where strict pollution restrictions are in place on industries, following a 1996 Supreme Court of India ruling.

Some antique views were published in the Fisher&#x27;s Drawing Room Scrap Books, namely by Samuel Prout from a mid-distant angle (1832) and by S. Austin from those said ruins (1836). Both are accompanied by poetical illustrations by Letitia Elizabeth Landon.
===Agra Fort===

The Agra Fort is a large 16th-century fortress of red sandstone located by the Yamuna River in Agra. It was first established by the Mughal Emperor Akbar and served as the seat of royal government when Agra was the capital of the Mughal empire in addition to being a military base and a royal residence. Built on the site of earlier fortifications by Islam Shah Suri(son of Sher Shah Suri), the Agra Fort lies on the right bank of the Yamuna River and is connected to the Taj Mahal (downstream, around a bend in the Yamuna), by a stretch of parkland. The fort was commissioned by Akbar in 1565, taking around eight years to build. Though much of the structure of the fort was founded by Akbar, both the interior and exterior underwent considerable changes under his son Jahangir and grandson Shah Jahan, who added many new structures, often of marble. The red sandstone walls of the roughly semi-circular structure have a perimeter of about 2.5 km, rise 21 metres high, and are surrounded by a moat. There are two entrances in the walls: the Delhi Gate facing west, the original entrance, situated nearly opposite to the Agra Fort railway station and Jama Masjid, and decorated with intricate marble inlays; and the Amar Singh Gate(also known as &quot;Hathi Pol&quot;, or Elephant Gate) facing south, presently the only means in or out of the fort complex). The complex of buildings in the fort—reminiscent of Persian and Timurid architecture, with great inspiration from Jain and Hindu architecture—forms a city within a city.

Among the major attractions in the fort is Jahangiri Mahal, the largest residence in the complex, built by Akbar as a private palace for his Rajput wives. In the Diwan-i-Am (Hall of Public Audience), the emperor would listen to public petitions and meet state officials. The Diwan-i-Khas (Hall of Private Audience) was used for receiving distinguished visitors. The famous Peacock Throne was once kept there, before Aurangzeb took it to Delhi. Near the Diwan-i-Khas stands the Musamman Burj, an octagonal Tower which was the residence of Shah Jahan&#x27;s favourite empress, Mumtaz Maḥal. The Moti Masjid (Pearl Mosque), constructed by Shah Jahan, is a structure made entirely of white marble. The emperor&#x27;s private residence was the Khas Mahal, whose marble walls were once adorned with flowers depicted by precious gems. Located to its northeast is the Sheesh Mahal (Palace of Mirrors), its walls and ceilings inlaid with thousands of small mirrors. Numerous other structures are there in the complex, including the &quot;Anguri Bagh&quot;, the &quot;Mina Bazaar&quot; etc.

In addition to its other functions, the fort also served as a prison for Shah Jahan when Aurangzeb, his son and successor as emperor, had him confined there from 1658 until his death in 1666.

===I&#x27;timād-ud-Daulah&#x27;s tomb===
Nur Jahan commissioned I&#x27;timād-ud-Daulah&#x27;s tomb, sometimes called the &quot;Baby Taj&quot;, for her father, Mirza Ghiyas Beg, the Chief Minister of the Emperor Jahangir.

The tomb is set amidst a large garden and is enclosed by four battlemented walls, each with a large gateway. The 99 names of Allah have been inscribed on the tomb. The tomb has seen some damage to its minarets and other aspects, which was inflicted by the Jats of Bharatpur. The vast gardens around Sikandra are inhabited by several Blackbucks, which are in the process of being shifted to the Etawah Safari Park. Next to Akbar&#x27;s tomb, stands the Tomb of Mariam-uz-Zamani, the favourite wife of Akbar.

<text>Pitt Meadows is a city within Metro Vancouver in southwestern British Columbia, Canada. Incorporated in 1914, it currently has a land area of with an estimate population of 19,498 as of 2024. The city received its name from the Pitt River and Pitt Lake. Pitt Meadows is one of the cities in British Columbia including Electoral Area A that comprises the Metro Vancouver Regional District.

Indigenous Peoples have resided in Pitt Meadows for approximately 1000 years. James McMillan explored the area in 1874. The Municipality of Maple Ridge, which included the Pitt Meadows area, was incorporated in 1874. In 1892, residents of the Pitt Meadows area petitioned for their removal from the District of Maple Ridge. In 1893, the first dyking district was organized; however, the Fraser River Flood of 1894 flooded many acres of land in Pitt Meadows.

In 1914, Pitt Meadows was a small, agricultural community of less than 250 individuals which supplied Vancouver and New Westminster with produce and dairy products. In 1995, Pitt Meadows became a member municipality of Metro Vancouver. In 2007, the District of Pitt Meadows was incorporated as the City of Pitt Meadows. In 2014, Pitt Meadows&#x27; centennial occurred.

==History==
===Early settlement===
Indigenous Peoples resided in the Pitt Meadows area approximately 1000 years ago. James McMillan explored the area during the 1824 Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company expedition to the Lower Fraser. Europeans started a settlement known as Bonson&#x27;s Landing in the area in the 1870s. Early settlers were mostly Anglo-Saxon until after 1910. The municipality takes its name from the Pitt River and Pitt Lake. The river, the lake and the settlement were named for British prime minister William Pitt the Younger. The Municipality of Maple Ridge, which included the Pitt Meadows area, was incorporated in 1874. In 1885, the Canadian Pacific Railway was constructed through Pitt Meadows to Port Moody, and Vancouver soon after.

The Pitt Meadows General Store, which was constructed in 1886, was moved to its current location in 1908. A garden has existed since the early years of development on the Site. The store, which contained the community&#x27;s first Post Office and the first telephone, has been the home of the Pitt Meadows Museum and Archives since June 1998.

In 1892, residents of the Pitt Meadows area petitioned for their removal from the District of Maple Ridge. In 1893, the first dyking district was organized. The Fraser River Flood of 1894 flooded many acres of land in the spring.

===Incorporation===
Pitt Meadows reverted to unorganized territory from 1892 until it was separately incorporated as a municipality in 1914. In 1914, Pitt Meadows was a small, agricultural community of less than 250 individuals which supplied Vancouver and New Westminster with produce and dairy products. After 1910, many French Canadians and Japanese arrived as settlers.

===After World War II===
During World War II, Pitt Meadows lost servicemen including: Aircraftman 2nd Class William George Bend; Ordinary Seaman John Pastorek and Flight Lieutenant Robert Arnold Samuel Lasser.

A large group of Dutch farmers reclaimed much of the low-lying land in Pitt Meadows after World War II. Pitt Meadows joined the Greater Vancouver Water District in 1948.

In 1948, a major flood occurred after cool weather through mid-May allowed an unusually large snowpack to accumulate, and a sudden shift to warm temperatures caused a fast melt.

In 1957, the second Pitt River Bridge, opened. Replacing the first bridge built in 1915. A twin bridge was built to complement the 1957 bridge in 1978.

The Pitt Meadows Regional Airport opened in 1963.

===Heritage Preservation Area===

A Heritage Preservation Area contains several buildings of significant heritage value, including the old General Store (now the Pitt Meadows Museum) and Hoffman and Sons Garage. Hans Hoffmann, a mechanic, worked in and then ran the family business of Hoffmann and Son Ltd. for almost 45 years. In 1974, Hans began his hobby of collecting and restoring stationary gasoline engines.

=== Cenotaph===
In 1990, the Pitt Meadows Cenotaph was constructed &quot;in memory of all those who have served and died for us.&quot; The City of Pitt Meadows received funding for the restoration of the Pitt Meadows Cenotaph, in 2009. In 2012, British Columbia formally apologized to the Japanese-Canadian community for the internment of thousands of people during the Second World War. Tosh Suzuki&#x27;s family spent nine years in Manitoba after being displaced from their Pitt Meadows berry farm.

===Symbols ===
The announcement of the Letters Patent for Pitt Meadows, and Grant of Arms, Supporters, Flag and Badge was made on March 12, 2005, in Volume 139, page 688 of the Canada Gazette. The Arms consist of the colours purple and gold, its heron emblem and a band running parallel to the edge of the shield which represents the dykes which protect the lands of the municipality. The crenellated outer edge represents gearwheels and refer to the historic Hoffman garage. The horizontal bands symbolize the CP railway line around which the District grew. The motto is Prosperity through endeavour. The crest coronet represents Golden Ears peaks to the north of the District. The white drops in the crest recall the early dairy industry. The Katzie eagle symbol in the crest recalls the original Aboriginal inhabitants and recreational aviation.

===Centennial===
In 2014, in recognition of Pitt Meadows&#x27; centennial, anniversary special festivities and a Community Birthday Party were held. The Mission Folk Music Festival Society will present the 27th and 28th editions of the Mission Folk Music Festival in 2014/2015.

==Geography==
Pitt Meadows is located in the Lower Fraser Valley, east of Vancouver. Most residents live in the urban town centre, which is located on a highland area. 82% of Pitt Meadows is within the Green Zone, lands, including watersheds and 200-year floodplains, forests, wilderness areas, wildlife habitats, wetlands, recreational areas, farms and forestry areas that are fundamental to Metro Vancouver&#x27;s character and ecology. Pitt Meadows, an agricultural town, is over 68% within a floodplain with 86% of Pitt Meadows lying within the BC Agricultural Land Reserve as protected farmland. Lands designated as environmentally sensitive include wildlife conservation areas such as Pitt-Addington Marsh and Codd Wetland Ecological Conservancy Area, and the banks of the Fraser, Pitt and Alouette Rivers. Other areas of Pitt Meadows that are within the Green Zone include most of the river side of the dikes, municipal parks and greenways.
Pitt Meadows is sandwiched on the north side of the Fraser River at its junction with the Pitt River on the west and Maple Ridge on the east. Two arms of the Alouette River run through Pitt Meadows, along with a number of other sloughs and waterways. To the north, Pitt Lake is the largest freshwater tidal lake in the world, connected by the Pitt River to the Fraser River, which is the southern boundary of Pitt Meadows. The Pitt River flows backwards at high tide and has created a delta where it joins Pitt lake. The Thompson Mountain Range rises along the Pitt Meadows&#x27;s northeast edge. Pitt Meadows is protected from flooding by 64 kilometres of dikes which provide a multi-use trail system alongside the farmland and marshes, and offer views of the mountains to the north. The northern sector of the flood plain, closest to Pitt Lake, presents several challenges to development; it is largely a peat bog containing a large wildlife refuge. The deep peat and bog soil conditions sometimes require considerable fill and/or pre-loading prior to development. On the west side of the Pitt River is Port Coquitlam. Pitt Meadows is located between the rapidly developing communities of Coquitlam, Port Coquitlam, Maple Ridge, Surrey and Langley.

===Climate===
Like most of the lower mainland, Pitt Meadows features an oceanic climate, with warm summers and cool, rainy winters.
==Demographics==
In the 2021 Census of Population conducted by Statistics Canada, Pitt Meadows had a population of 19,146 living in 7,404 of its 7,628 total private dwellings, a change of from its 2016 population of 18,573. With a land area of , it had a population density of in 2021.

=== Ethnicity ===

==Transportation==

===River===

Pitt Meadows is naturally isolated from the rest of the Lower Mainland by the Pitt River and the Fraser River. The major urbanized portion of the Lower Mainland is located on the Burrard Peninsula, on the other side of the Pitt River from Pitt Meadows. The Fraser, Pitt and Alouette Rivers played a pivotal role in the development of Pitt Meadows by providing transportation routes, fishing areas and nourishing flood water to the farm areas. Today, the Fraser River is an extensively used navigation channel for both industrial traffic and recreational use. Although the Pitt River sees less traffic, its foreshore is an important area for log storage. The Alouette River continues to be important to the farming areas.

===Canadian Pacific Railway===

Its first land-based transportation route came in 1885 with the construction of the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) through to Port
Moody. The main portion of the town of Pitt Meadows is bisected by the CPR mainline. The highway bridge over the Pitt River was opened in 1957. As of 2003, the CPR intermodal yards and distribution centre west of the Pitt Meadows station in the town centre are being expanded.

===Airport===
In 1963, the Pitt Meadows Airport was opened. There are height restrictions on buildings due to the proximity of the Pitt Meadows Airport to the southeast, although the recent development of a 10-storey building less than from the east–west runways puts those restrictions in doubt. In 2003, the airport was undergoing expansion to support scheduled passenger service for short-haul prop-driven planes. The airport is also home to a skydiving school, as well as a number of other businesses. On August 3, 2008, a Beech 65-A90 King Air took off from Pitt Meadows Airport, with the pilot and seven parachutists for a local sky diving flight. The pilot reported an engine failure and turned back towards Pitt Meadows Airport, which could not be reached and a forced landing was carried out in a cranberry field, west of the airport. Four of the parachutists received serious injuries and the aircraft was substantially damaged although there was no fire and the occupants were evacuated. Pitt Meadows Water Aerodrome, (TC LID: CAJ8), is located southwest of Pitt Meadows.

===Bridges &amp; highways===
Lougheed Highway is the main road route through Pitt Meadows and along the north shore of the Fraser River. The Pitt River Bridge links it to the Burrard Peninsula to the west.

The Pitt River Bridge and Mary Hill Interchange Project included a new seven-lane bridge that replaced the existing swing bridges, as well as an interchange to replace the current Lougheed Highway and Mary Hill Bypass intersection. Golden Ears Bridge, which connects Pitt Meadows and Maple Ridge to Surrey and Langley, opened in 2009. Golden Ears is the name of the summit that lies north of Pitt Meadows. In 2011, Lougheed Highway upgrades included the widening and extension of the westbound HOV lane between the Golden Ears Bridge and Harris Road, the addition of bus queue jump lanes in both directions, at the Kennedy Road intersection leading to and from the Pitt River Bridge. The Golden Ears Bridge, completed in summer of 2009, connects Pitt Meadows and Maple Ridge with the communities of Langley and Surrey south across the Fraser River. Construction of the new Pitt River Bridge, connecting Pitt Meadows with Port Coquitlam to the west, was completed in autumn 2009.

===Public transportation===

TransLink operates the West Coast Express with a stations at Maple Meadows and Pitt Meadows stations. Buses are operated by the Coast Mountain Bus Company, a subsidiary of TransLink. Route 701 is a major route that takes commuters from Coquitlam down to Port Coquitlam and into Pitt Meadows and Maple Ridge. Pitt Meadows is also served by the R3 Rapid Bus, although its route takes it along Lougheed Highway. Route 791 serves as another major route that takes commuters from Braid station to Pitt Meadows via the Mary Hill Bypass. The 722 and 719 community shuttle routes go from Osprey Village through different residential Pitt Meadows routes, both ending in Meadowtown Centre.

In 2018, a TransLink bus stop on Highway 7 (Lougheed Highway) in Pitt Meadows was voted the &quot;sorriest bus stop in America&quot; by StreetsBlog.

===Accessibility===
The Pitt Meadows Paddling Club received the 2011 Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows Accessibility and Inclusion Award in both the Leisure and Recreation and the Volunteer Categories; the PaddleALL programs are for individuals with cognitive and physical disabilities. Access Transit provides accessible door-to-door transportation service in the Metro Vancouver region, which includes Pitt Meadows using specially equipped vehicles designed to carry passengers with physical or cognitive disabilities who are unable to use public transit without assistance.

==Economy==

As a primarily residential area, approximately 85% of Pitt Meadows residents commute to work beyond its borders. Within the community, the largest employment sectors are, in order of importance: Primary (20%); Education and Health (19%); Accommodation, Food, and Beverage (16%); and Construction (9%).

In addition to the commercial activity that already exists in Pitt Meadows, a new retail shopping centre, Meadowtown Centre, has been built on the border with Maple Ridge. Despite recent additions to its non-agricultural economy, 86% of the Pitt Meadows landmass is located within the province&#x27;s Agricultural Land Reserve.

Pitt Meadows&#x27; agricultural lands includes extensive large parcels located in the southwest and northeast portions of the city. Major agricultural products include cranberry and blueberry farms, horticultural products, greenhouse crops (cut flowers and specialty peppers), grazing, dairy farming, and other farm activities. Agritourism is developed in conjunction with agricultural operations. The Meadows Maze, for example, one of the largest corn mazes in the Pacific Northwest is on the Hopcott Farm; which was purchased in 1932. A growing trend, particularly in areas close to urban centres, is the use of agricultural lands for rural estate use with little or no agricultural use of land.

== Politics ==
Pitt Meadows is represented by a mayor and six councillors. The mayor is Nicole MacDonald and the councillors are Tracy Elke, Alison Evans, Mike Hayes, Mike Manion, Bob Meachen and Gwen O&#x27;Connell. In 2017 former Pitt Meadows councillor David Murray was convicted for sexually assaulting a 14-year-old girl in 1992 while in his 30s. After conviction he resigned his position as councillor. He served 9 months in prison.

==Education==
Pitt Meadows has one secondary school, and four elementary schools, all of which are part of School District 42 Maple Ridge-Pitt Meadows. Pitt Meadows Secondary School (PMSS) in particular is well known around the Fraser Valley and the Greater Vancouver Area for its soccer and hockey programs, some of which can be offered as an alternative to Physical Education. The school has enrolled around 800 students. PMSS has a Student Council which as of 2019 changed its logo to be a female marauder.

==Recreation==

In Pitt Meadows, there are cultural, recreation and other community facilities and public uses in the Civic Centre, the Town Centre and the Sawyer&#x27;s Landing Waterfront Village. River access park areas provide active and passive use, parking, viewpoints and picnic use. There are public sports facilities, open spaces, trails and bike paths, protected natural areas and recreational programs. Indoor recreational facilities in Pitt Meadows include a recreation centre and ice skating rinks. Joint agreements with Maple Ridge and the School District allow the provision of community recreation facilities and programs to Pitt Meadows residents. Outdoor recreational opportunities include a system of dikes top trails along the river systems of Pitt Meadows for walking, cycling and equestrian use as well as boating opportunities on the Alouette, Fraser and Pitt Rivers.

The Widgeon Valley National Wildlife Area (NWA), which is 125 ha in size located near Pitt Lake, was purchased by the Nature Trust of British Columbia in 1973 and declared a NWA in October 1973. Nearby areas of high wetland value include Widgeon Slough and Addington Point along the Pitt River, the shallow southern end of Pitt Lake, and the extensive dyked wet areas of the Pitt Meadows. As a result, the valley is very attractive to wildlife and for human recreational pursuits.

==Notable residents==
* Mike Kubat, writer
* Brendan Morrison, hockey player
* Molly Parker, actress
* Devin Townsend, musician

==TV and film==

Much of the movie &quot;Happy Gilmore&quot;, including most of the golf course scenes, was filmed in Pitt Meadows at the Swan-e-set Bay Resort &amp; Country Club. In the pilot episode of &quot;Smallville&quot;, the scene where the Porsche drives off the bridge was filmed at Silverbridge on Harris Road. The movie &quot;Duets&quot; starring Gwyneth Paltrow &amp; Paul Giamatti had a scene filmed at the Ramada Inn on Lougheed Highway. The movie &quot;3000 Miles to Graceland&quot; was filmed at a saw mill on Bonson Rd.

<text>Thomas Bailey Aldrich ( ; November 11, 1836 – March 19, 1907) was an American writer, poet, critic, and editor. He is notable for his long editorship of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, during which he published writers including Charles W. Chesnutt. He was also known for his semi-autobiographical book &quot;The Story of a Bad Boy&quot;, which established the &quot;bad boy&#x27;s book&quot; subgenre in nineteenth-century American literature, and for his poetry.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===
Thomas Bailey Aldrich was born in Portsmouth, New Hampshire, on November 11, 1836, to Elias T. Aldrich and Sara Aldrich, née Bailey. When Aldrich was a child, his father moved to New Orleans, but after 10 years, Aldrich was sent back to Portsmouth to prepare for college. This period of his life is partly described in his semi-autobiographical novel &quot;The Story of a Bad Boy&quot; (1870), in which &quot;Tom Bailey&quot; is the juvenile hero.

===Early career===
Aldrich abandoned college preparations after his father&#x27;s death in 1849. At age 16 in 1852, he entered his uncle&#x27;s New York business office and became a constant contributor to the newspapers and magazines. Aldrich befriended other young poets, artists and wits of the metropolitan bohemia of the early 1860s, including Edmund Clarence Stedman, Richard Henry Stoddard, Fitz Hugh Ludlow, Bayard Taylor and Walt Whitman. From 1856 to 1859, Aldrich was on the staff of the &quot;Home Journal&quot;, then edited by Nathaniel Parker Willis. During the Civil War he was the editor of the &quot;New York Illustrated News&quot;.
In 1865, Aldrich returned to New England, and in Boston he edited the eclectic weekly literary magazine &quot;Every Saturday&quot;, published by Ticknor and Fields and successors (Field, Osgood; James R. Osgood &amp; Co.; H. O. Houghton &amp; Co.), throughout its run from 1866 to 1874. From 1881 to 1890, he edited &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot;, Boston&#x27;s most important magazine. As editor of &quot;The Atlantic&quot; he created tension with his publisher Henry Oscar Houghton by refusing to publish articles that Houghton commissioned from friends including Woodrow Wilson and Francis Marion Crawford. When Houghton chastised Aldrich for turning down submissions from his friend Daniel Coit Gilman, Aldrich threatened to resign and finally did so in June 1890.
Beginning with the collection of stories entitled &quot;Marjorie Daw and Other People&quot; (1873), Aldrich wrote works of realism and quiet humor. His novels &quot;Prudence Palfrey&quot; (1874), &quot;The Queen of Sheba&quot; (1877), and &quot;The Stillwater Tragedy&quot; (1880) had more dramatic action. The first portrayed Portsmouth with the affectionate touch shown in the shorter humorous tale, &quot;A Rivermouth Romance&quot; (1877). In &quot;An Old Town by the Sea&quot; (1893), Aldrich commemorated his birthplace again. Travel and description are the theme of &quot;From Ponkapog to Pesth&quot; (1883).

===Marriage and later life===

Aldrich was married in 1865 to Lilian Woodman of New York, and had two sons. Mark Twain apparently detested Aldrich&#x27;s wife, writing in 1893: &quot;Lord, I loathe that woman so! She is an idiot—an absolute idiot—and does not know it ... and her husband, the sincerest man that walks ... tied for life to this vacant hellion, this clothes-rack, this twaddling, blethering, driveling blatherskite!&quot; For her own part, Lilian Aldrich wrote affectionately of Mark Twain in her memoir &quot;Crowding Memories&quot; (1920). In Chapter 12, however, she does write apologetically about their first encounter, when she treated him coldly, not being informed of his identity and mistakenly believing him to be inebriated.

The Aldriches were close friends of Henry L. Pierce, former mayor of Boston and chocolate magnate. At his death in 1896, he willed them his estate at Canton, Massachusetts.

In 1901, Aldrich&#x27;s son Charles, married the year before, was diagnosed with tuberculosis. Aldrich built two houses, one for his son and one for him and his family, in Saranac Lake, New York, then the leading treatment center for the disease. On March 6, 1904, Charles Aldrich died of tuberculosis, age thirty-four. The family left Saranac Lake and never returned.
Aldrich died in Boston on March 19, 1907. His last words were recorded as, &quot;In spite of it all, I am going to sleep; put out the lights.&quot; His &quot;Life&quot; was written by Ferris Greenslet (1908). He is buried on Grapevine Path lot 6109 of Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts.

In 1920, Aldrich&#x27;s widow published her memoirs, &quot;Crowding Memories&quot;, which includes accounts of her husband&#x27;s friendships with Mark Twain, William Dean Howells, Bret Harte, Henry James, James Russell Lowell, Harriet Beecher Stowe, Edwin Booth, and other cultural luminaries.

==Literary style and criticism==
Aldrich wrote both in prose and verse. He was well known for his form in poetry. His successive volumes of verse, chiefly &quot;The Ballad of Babie Bell&quot; (1856), &quot;Pampinea, and Other Poems&quot; (1861), &quot;Cloth of Gold&quot; (1874), &quot;Flower and Thorn&quot; (1876), &quot;Friar Jerome&#x27;s Beautiful Book&quot; (1881), &quot;Mercedes and Later Lyrics&quot; (1883), &quot;Wyndham Towers&quot; (1889), and the collected editions of 1865, 1882, 1897 and 1900, showed him to be a poet of lyrical skill and light touch. Critics believed him to show the influence of Robert Herrick.

He was a critic of the dialect verse that was popular at the time. In a 1900 letter referencing contemporary poet James Whitcomb Riley, he wrote, &quot;The English language is too sacred a thing to be mutilated and vulgarized&quot;.

Aldrich&#x27;s longer narrative or dramatic poems were not as successful. Notable work includes such lyrics as &quot;Hesperides&quot;, &quot;When the Sultan Goes to Ispahan&quot;, &quot;Before the Rain&quot;, &quot;Nameless Pain&quot;, &quot;The Tragedy&quot;, &quot;Seadrift&quot;, &quot;Tiger Lilies&quot;, &quot;The One White Rose&quot;, &quot;Palabras Cariñosas&quot;, &quot;Destiny&quot;, and the eight-line poem &quot;Identity&quot;.

<doc id="356299" wikidata="Q4019918" url="?curid=356299" title="William Alexander, Lord Stirling">
<text>William Alexander, also known as Lord Stirling (December 27, 1725 – January 15, 1783), was a Scottish-American major general during the American Revolutionary War. He was considered male heir to the Scottish title of Earl of Stirling through Scottish lineage (being the senior male descendant of the paternal grandfather of the 1st Earl of Stirling, who had died in 1640), and he sought the title sometime after 1756. His claim was initially granted by a Scottish court in 1759; however, the House of Lords ultimately overruled Scottish law and denied the title in 1762. He continued to hold himself out as &quot;Lord Stirling&quot; regardless.

Lord Stirling commanded a brigade at the Battle of Long Island, his rearguard action resulting in his capture but enabling General George Washington&#x27;s troops to escape. Stirling later was returned by prisoner exchange and received a promotion; continuing to serve with distinction throughout the war. He also was trusted by Washington and, in 1778, exposed the Conway Cabal.

==Early life==
William was born December 27, 1725, in New York City in what was then the Province of New York, a part of British America. He was the son of lawyer James Alexander and merchant Mary Spratt Provoost Alexander. His nephew was Senator John Rutherfurd (1760–1840).

He was educated, ambitious, and proficient in mathematics and astronomy, he then joined his mother, Mary Alexander, the widow of David Provost, in the provision business left her by the death of her first husband.

===Earldom of Stirling===
The Earldom of Stirling in the Scottish peerage became dormant or extinct upon the death of Henry Alexander, 5th Earl of Stirling. William Alexander&#x27;s father, James Alexander, who had fled from Scotland in 1716 after participating in the Jacobite rising, did not claim the title. Upon his father&#x27;s death, William lay claim to the title and filed suit. His relationship to the 5th Earl was not through heirs of the body, but through heirs male collateral. Thus, he was not entitled to a title inherited only by the male line descendants of the 1st Earl. However, the inheritance by proximity of blood had been questioned. It was settled in his favor, by a unanimous vote of a jury of twelve in a Scottish court in 1759, and William claimed the disputed title of Earl of Stirling. It is not clear whether the case went to court because of an unfavorable answer from the Lord Lyon King of Arms concerning the peerage.

Legal opinion was that this was a &quot;Scottish heir&quot; problem, so the title right was solved. This might have been unopposed, as indisputable peerage, except there was a catch. The two sponsors, Archibald Campbell, 3rd Duke of Argyll, and John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, encouraged William Alexander through representatives to seek the title. The goal was vast land holdings in America that the holder of the title was to enjoy. The sponsors were to receive money and land if William was successful. With this in mind, William decided to petition the House of Lords. A friend and professional agent in Scotland, Andrew Stuart, wrote and advised William not to petition the House of Lords. He felt that the right of indisputable peerage demanded that William just claim the titles as others had done. His opinion was that others lay similar claims to titles so he would not be opposed. It is possible William did not want to commit a crime, or be found out, and if the House of Lords advanced his claim it would be forever legal. One problem was that to prove his claim in court, two old men were called upon to testify that William did in fact descend from the first Earl through his uncle named John Alexander. This might have been persuasive in a Scottish court but might be considered dubious in England.

He inherited a large fortune from his father, dabbled in mining and agriculture, and lived a life filled with the trappings befitting a Scottish lord. This was an expensive lifestyle, and he eventually went into debt to finance it. He began building his grand estate in the Basking Ridge section of Bernards Township, New Jersey, and upon its completion, sold his home in New York and moved there. George Washington was a guest there on several occasions during the revolution and gave away Alexander&#x27;s daughter at her wedding. In 1767, the Royal Society of Arts awarded Alexander a gold medal for accepting the society&#x27;s challenge to establish viticulture and wine making in the North American colonies by cultivating 2,100 grape (&quot;V. vinifera&quot;) vines on his New Jersey estate. Alexander was elected to the American Philosophical Society in 1770.

==American Revolution==
When the American Revolutionary War began, Stirling was made a colonel in the New Jersey colonial militia. Because he was wealthy and willing to spend his own money in support of the Patriot cause, he outfitted his unit, the 1st New Jersey Regiment, at his own expense. He distinguished himself early by leading a group of volunteers in the capture of an armed British naval transport.

The Second Continental Congress appointed him brigadier general in the Continental Army in March 1776.

===Prisoner of war===
At the Battle of Long Island, in August of that year, Stirling led a brigade in Sullivan&#x27;s division. He held against repeated attacks by a superior British Army force under the command of Gen. James Grant at the Old Stone House near Gowanus Creek and took heavy casualties. Additional redcoats had made a wide flanking attack sweeping to the east through the lightly-guarded Jamaica Pass, one of a series of low entrances through the ridge line of hills running east to west through the center of Long Island, catching the Patriot forces on their left side. Stirling ordered his brigade to retreat while he himself kept the 1st Maryland Regiment as rear-guard. Though heavily outnumbered he led a counter-attack, eventually dispersing his men before being overwhelmed. Stirling himself was taken prisoner but he had held the British forces occupied long enough to allow the main body of Washington&#x27;s army to escape to defensive positions at Brooklyn Heights, along the East River shoreline. Later, under the cover of a miraculous fog which enveloped the river, Washington was able to barge his remaining troops and equipment across back to Manhattan and New York City.

Because of his actions at Long Island, one newspaper called Stirling &quot;the bravest man in America&quot;, and he was praised by both Washington and the British for his bravery and audacity. Later a commemorative monument was erected at the site of the military engagements and embattled retreat and the plot of land deeded to the State of Maryland near Prospect Park as a sacred parcel of &quot;blood-soaked Maryland soil&quot;.

===Balance of War===
Stirling was released in a prisoner exchange, in return for governor Montfort Browne, and promoted to the rank of major general, and became one of Washington&#x27;s most able and trusted generals. Washington held him in such high regard that during the second Middlebrook encampment, he placed him, headquartered at the nearby Van Horne House, in command of the Continental Army for nearly two months, from December 21, 1778, when he left to meet with Congress in Philadelphia, until he returned about February 5, 1779.

Throughout most of the war Stirling was considered to be third or fourth in rank behind General Washington. At the Battle of Trenton on December 26, 1776, he received the surrender of a Hessian auxiliary regiment. On June 26, 1777, at Metuchen, he awaited an attack, contrary to Washington&#x27;s orders. His position was turned and his division defeated, losing two guns and a hundred fifty men in the Battle of Short Hills. Subsequent battles at Brandywine and Germantown in Pennsylvania during the campaign to defend the Patriot capital of Philadelphia and Monmouth in New Jersey, cemented his reputation for bravery and sound tactical judgment.

Stirling also played a part in exposing the Conway Cabal, a conspiracy of disaffected Continental officers looking to remove Washington as Commander-in Chief and replace him with General Horatio Gates. According to one author, &quot;Lord Stirling never gave dull parties. His dinners were a Niagara of liquor. His love of the bottle was notorious...&quot; One of Gates&#x27; aides, James Wilkinson, stopped at Stirling&#x27;s headquarters at Reading, Pennsylvania and stayed for dinner because it was raining. Wilkinson got drunk and began repeating criticisms of Washington that he had heard from other officers. Finally, he claimed to have read a letter from Thomas Conway to Gates that stated, &quot;Heaven has determined to save your country or a weak general and bad counselors would have ruined it&quot;. The loyal Stirling wrote to Washington the next day and repeated what Wilkinson said. Washington, in turn, wrote to Conway, repeating what Stirling had written. Once exposed, the cabal went to pieces. Conway denied ever writing the note, Wilkinson called Stirling a liar, and Gates made statements that made himself look guilty.

At the Battle of Monmouth on 28 June 1778, Stirling commanded the American Left Wing. This included the 1st (429), 2nd (487), and 3rd Pennsylvania (438) Brigades, John Glover’s (636), Ebenezer Learned&#x27;s (373), and John Paterson’s (485) Massachusetts Brigades. He displayed tactical judgment in posting his batteries, and repelled with heavy loss an attempt to turn his flank. During the devastating winter encampment at Valley Forge, northwest of British–held Philadelphia, his military headquarters have been preserved. In January 1780, he led an ineffective raid against Staten Island on the western shores of New York Bay.

When Washington and the French comte de Rochambeau took their conjoined armies south for the climactic Battle of Yorktown in 1781, Stirling was appointed commander of the elements of the Northern Army, left behind to guard New York and was sent up the Hudson River to Albany. He died shortly thereafter in January 1783.

==Personal life==
In 1747, William Alexander married Sarah Livingston (1725–1805), the daughter of Philip Livingston, 2nd Lord of Livingston Manor. Sarah was also the sister of Governor William Livingston. Together, William and Sarah had two daughters and one son:

* William Alexander
* Mary Alexander (1749–1820), who married wealthy merchant Robert Watts (1743–1814), son of John Watts of New York.
*Catherine Alexander (1755–1826), who married Continental Congressman William Duer (1743–1799).

Always a heavy drinker, Alexander was in poor health by 1782, suffering from severe gout and rheumatism. He died in Albany on 15 January 1783. His death occurred just months before the official end of the American War of Independence with the Treaty of Paris of 1783. A memorial tablet to the Alexander family can be found in the Churchyard of Trinity Church, facing the historic Wall Street district (adjoining nearby St. Paul&#x27;s Chapel), in New York City.

===Descendants===
Through his daughter Catherine, he is grandfather to college president William Alexander Duer (1780–1858) and noted lawyer and jurist John Duer (1782–1858). He is also great-grandfather of U.S. Congressman William Duer (1805–1879) and great-great-great-grandfather of writer and suffragette Alice Duer Miller (1874–1942).

Through his daughter Mary, he is great-grandfather of General Stephen Watts Kearny (1794–1848) and great-great-grandfather of General Philip Kearny, Jr. (1815–1862), who died in action during the U.S. Civil War.

<text>Alençon (, , ; ) is a commune in Normandy, France, and the capital of the Orne department. It is situated west of Paris. Alençon belongs to the intercommunality of Alençon (with 52,000 people).

==History==
The name of Alençon is first recorded in a document dated in the seventh century. During the tenth century, Alençon was a buffer state between Normandy and the Maine regions.

In 1049–1051, William Duke of Normandy, later known as William the Conqueror and king of England, laid siege to the town, which had risen in support of the Count of Anjou along with two other towns of the Bellême estates, Domfront (then in Maine) and Bellême (held directly from King Henry I of France). According to Duke William&#x27;s chaplain and panegyrist, William of Poitiers, the defenders of the fortress refused to surrender and mockingly waved animal hides from the castle walls, referencing William&#x27;s lineage as the grandson of a tanner. In response to this, William had 32 prisoners of the town&#x27;s hands and feet cut off, prompting a sudden surrender. Upon hearing of this event, the town of Domfront also surrendered.

Alençon was occupied by the English during the Anglo-Norman wars of 1113 to 1203.

The city became the seat of a dukedom in 1415, belonging to the sons of the King of France until the French Revolution, and some of them played important roles in French history: see Duke of Alençon. The French Revolution caused relatively little disorder in this area, although there were some royalist uprisings nearby.

A long-standing local fabric industry gave birth to the town&#x27;s famous point d&#x27;Alençon lace in the 18th century. The economic development of the nineteenth century was based on iron foundries and mills in the surrounding region. In the first half of the twentieth century the city developed a flourishing printing industry.

Alençon was home to Sts. Louis Martin and Marie-Azélie Guérin, the parents of St. Thérèse of Lisieux. They were the first spouses in the history of the Catholic Church to be proposed for sainthood as a couple, in 2008. Zélie and Louis were married at the Basilica of Notre-Dame in Alençon on 13 July 1858 and spent their whole married life in Alençon, where Thérèse was born in January 1873 and spent her early childhood until the death of her mother in 1877. Beatification of Louis and Zelie Martin - Saint Therese of Lisieux

On 17 June 1940, the German Army occupied Alençon. On 12 August 1944 Alençon was the first French city to be liberated by the French Army under General Leclerc, after minor bomb damage.

After the war the population sharply increased and new industries settled. Many of these were related to plastics and the town is now a major plastics educational centre.

==Geography==

Alençon along with another 32 communes is part of a 3,503 hectare, Natura 2000 conservation area, called the Haute vallée de la Sarthe.

<doc id="356304" wikidata="Q604725" url="?curid=356304" title="Psychological horror">
<text>Psychological horror is a subgenre of horror and psychological fiction with a particular focus on mental, emotional, and psychological states to frighten, disturb, or unsettle its audience. The subgenre frequently overlaps with the related subgenre of psychological thriller, and often uses mystery elements and characters with unstable, unreliable, or disturbed psychological states to enhance the suspense, horror, drama, tension, and paranoia of the setting and plot and to provide an overall creepy, unpleasant, unsettling, or distressing atmosphere.

== Characteristics ==
Psychological horror usually aims to create discomfort or dread by exposing common or universal psychological and emotional vulnerabilities/fears and revealing the darker parts of the human psyche that most people may repress or deny. This idea is referred to in analytical psychology as the archetypal shadow characteristics: suspicion, distrust, self-doubt, and paranoia of others, themselves, and the world.

The genre sometimes seeks to challenge or confuse the audience&#x27;s grasp of the narrative or plot by focusing on characters who are themselves unsure of or doubting their own perceptions of reality or questioning their own sanity. Characters&#x27; perceptions of their surroundings or situations may indeed be distorted or subject to delusions, outside manipulation or gaslighting by other characters; emotional disturbances or trauma; and even hallucinations or mental disorders. Additionally, restricting the characters&#x27; and audience&#x27;s view of potential danger through strategic lighting and visual obstructions—like in Bird Box (film)—can heighten suspense and engage the imagination, leaving much of the threat unseen.

In many cases, and in a similar way as the overlapping genre of psychological thriller, psychological horror may deploy an unreliable narrator or imply that aspects of the story are being perceived inaccurately by a protagonist, thus confusing or unsettling the audience and setting up an ominous or disturbing overarching tone. In other cases, the narrator or protagonist may be reliable or ostensibly mentally stable but is placed in a situation involving another character or characters who are psychologically, mentally, or emotionally disturbed. Thus, elements of psychological horror focus on mental conflicts. These become important as the characters face perverse situations, sometimes involving the supernatural, immorality, murder, and conspiracies. While other horror media emphasize fantastical situations such as attacks by monsters, psychological horror tends to keep the monsters hidden and to involve situations more grounded on artistic realism.

Plot twists are an often-used device. Characters commonly face internal battles with subconscious desires such as romantic lust and the desire for petty revenge. In contrast, splatter fiction and monster movies often focuses on a bizarre, alien evil to which the average viewer cannot easily relate. However, at times, the psychological horror and splatter subgenres overlap, such as in the French horror film &quot;High Tension&quot;.

== Psychological fascination of psychological horror ==
Fascination with horror films lies in the unreasonable, irrational, and impossible. Jung and Nietzsche&#x27;s theories exemplify humans need to escape the real world and live in a sublime space where anything is possible. Horror allows the watcher to escape mundane conventional life and express the inner workings of their irrational thoughts. H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s explanation for the fascination of horror stems more from the lack of understanding of a humans true place and our deep inner instinct we are out of touch with, and the basic insignificance of one&#x27;s life and the universe at large. Horror forces us to remember. Psychological horror further forces the manifestation of each individual&#x27;s own personal horror. Our unseen humanity and our most basic human impulses forces us to seek out stimuli to remind us of our true nature and potential.

Psychological horror not only elicits fear, anxiety, and disgust but it also has the capacity to foster empathy in audiences. The genre allows audiences to navigate the complexities of human experiences that prompt viewers to connect with characters confronting conflict. Modern research reveals the relationship between empathy and fear or the lack thereof with interest in horror. Research shows that the effects of psychological horror affects females more than males. A current hypothesis for this difference between the genders is that it relates to social expectations and the gender roles we are exposed to during childhood. As a result of the lack of cross-cultural research on the psychological effects of horror, one hypothesis is that individual cultures develop their own unique sense of horror, based in their cultural experiences.

Discourse on more of the positive effects of psychological horror also point to it being a vessel for catharsis. Much in the same way that a sad song might help a listener through a difficult time by helping them purge their emotions to uncover psychological relief, horror can provide a similar route to cathartic experiences. According to Geraci et al., &quot;Strange things—the monstrous or weird —fascinate us because they evoke quasi-religious dread and desire, but we also pursue that which disturbs us because we desire to control it. Through deliberate exposure to the things we fear, we acclimate ourselves to them.&quot; Humans have a tendency to exhibit a cognitive bias called the negativity bias that points to why we are more likely to identify and dwell on negative aspects of our environments than positive ones, even if they both occur in the same magnitude. Evolutionarily, this helps explain why we might be quicker to notice certain stimuli or changes in our environments as threats to our safety rather than beneficial. This negativity bias also helps account for morbid curiosity and why we consume and enjoy horror media. Freud also points to his observations that children seem to repeatedly engage in the same unpleasurable experience in order to overcome it. It is only through and after these adverse experiences that psychological comfort arises.

== Tools of psychological horror ==

=== Lighting and shadows ===
Hitchcock&#x27;s &quot;Rear Window&quot; used light and deliberate shadows to incite suspense in the viewer. Suspense is a fundamental part of Hitchcockian horror. The use of shadows through light to cover up information results in a subtle escalation of suspense and horror of what can not be seen. Hitchcock&#x27;s Rear Window places the main character as the primary information source for the viewer; their confusion is pervasive. The viewer lacks an omniscient understanding of events, resulting in an suspenseful and slow then explosive revelation. Shadows hide events or truths yet to be revealed, sometimes foreshadow events, and notify the viewer to hidden truths, resulting in suspense and the self reflection of known truths by the viewer. Light is used as a metaphor for what we know and can be seen, in the light, and what we do not know and are trying to figure out, what is in the shadows. Half illumination can be used to express a duality of emotions and uncertainty. The use of a burning cigarette or cigar, a tiny light in a sea of darkness is enough to inform the viewer that something or someone is there, but reveals nothing else, manipulating the viewers fears of what could be.

=== Sound and music ===
Studies by Thayer and Ellison in the 1980 studied the effects of different types of music layered on top of stressful visual stimuli, they used dermal electromagnetic to capture information about physiological stimulation while watching and listening. They found that with stressful music and composition laid over top stressful images the psychological response was greater than when watching the same visual stimuli with non stressful sound. Music with a positive tone results in viewers perceiving simultaneous visual stimuli as positive, and when negative tones are used viewers perceive visual stimuli as negative or more threatening.

They made three hypotheses and were able to prove two with their research:

# The use of equally stressful sounds and music over stressful imagery increased the psychological response in viewers in comparison to the same imagery without sound. 
# Where sound and music are placed in relation to a stressful visual stimuli affects the psychological response in viewers. This could not be totally proven, as when sound and music are incongruent with visual stimuli the electromagnetic response was heightened without alleviation in moments of non stress. 
# Sound and music placement can manipulate the viewer into believing a stressful moment is about to happen or has ended, when music is used in opposition to human expectation it can increase stress in the viewer when the expectation the music created doesn&#x27;t happen visually.

When following a character in a movie or show, the music exemplifies the emotion of the character, the viewer feels what the character feels, creating a synergy between character and viewer. The addition of music breathes more depth into emotional response that visual stimuli can not accomplish on its own. Music can subconsciously influence the viewer, further intertwining them emotionally with what they are watching forcing them to feel more deeply whatever emotion they are feeling from watching making it an important piece of psychological horror and its success in inciting emotions in the viewer.

While sound design is deliberately crafted in the horror genre to evoke an emotional response, the absence of sound can be equally effective in evoking an emotional response. Soundtracks are utilized to build tension or accent a startling event, like a jump scare. However, in the film &quot;A Quiet Place&quot;, much of what builds suspense is the sparse, muted sound design. Films with minimalistic, limited soundtracks leave audiences unable to predict coming scenes and often lead to more pronounced emotional responses when a sound is added. Additionally, the replacement of soundtracks with sound effects highlights the role of noise in the plot of movies, such as &quot;A Quiet Place&quot;, where the blind extraterrestrial monsters are programmed to attack noise sources.

== Novels ==

The novels &quot;The Golem&quot; written by Gustav Meyrink, &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; written by Thomas Harris, Robert Bloch novels such as &quot;Psycho&quot; and &quot;American Gothic&quot;, Stephen King novels such as &quot;Carrie&quot;, &quot;Misery&quot;, &quot;The Girl Who Loved Tom Gordon&quot;, &quot;The Shining&quot;, and Koji Suzuki&#x27;s novel &quot;Ring&quot; are some examples of psychological horror. Shirley Jackson&#x27;s &quot;We Have Always Lived in the Castle&quot; is often viewed as one of the best examples of psychological horror in fiction.

== Films ==

Bill Gibron of PopMatters declared a mixed definition of the psychological horror film, ranging from definitions of anything that created a sense of disquiet or apprehension to a film where an audience&#x27;s mind makes up what was not directly displayed visually. Gibron concluded it as a &quot;clouded gray area between all out splatter and a trip through a cinematic dark ride.&quot;

Academics and historians have stated different origin periods to the psychological horror film.
Historian David J. Skal described &quot;The Black Cat&quot; (1934) as &quot;being called the first psychological horror movie in America.&quot;
Academic Susan Hayward described them as a post-World War II phenomenon and giving examples of psychological horror films as &quot;Psycho&quot; (1960) and &quot;Peeping Tom&quot; (1960). Hayward continued that the psychological horror films and slasher films are both interchangeable terms with &quot;horror-thrillers&quot;.

Hayward said the genre resembled the slasher film with both being &quot;vicious normalizing of misogyny&quot;. She wrote that in both film genres, the male had a dependence on the female for a sense of identity derived from his difference from her, and often killed them with items like knives or chainsaws.

== Video games ==
Psychological horror video games are a subgenre of horror video games. While such games may be based on any style of gameplay, they are generally more exploratory and &quot;seek to instigate a sense of doubt about what might really be happening&quot; in the player. &quot;Phantasmagoria&quot; (1995), &quot;D&quot; (1995), &quot;Corpse Party&quot; (1996) and &quot;Silent Hill&quot; (1999) are considered some of the first psychological horror games. Sometimes, psychological horror games will simulate crashes, file corruptions, and various other errors, such as the 2017 visual novel &quot;Doki Doki Literature Club!&quot;

Aligning with Freud&#x27;s observations of children&#x27;s repeated engagement with unpleasurable experiences, researchers have found that many many people derive similar emotions and experiences when engaging in horror video games. Scary, disturbing, and unsettling characters in horror media tend to be heightened and exaggerated personifications of our actual anxieties and fears. It is human nature to be attracted to things that elicit fear and to seek to overcome those fears as it allows individuals to gain &quot;temporary victory over ourselves.&quot; Horror video games elicit a consistent level of anxiety in players and allows them to act on it. To deal with the threat of horror in the game, players are driven to strengthen and protect their characters, and their success translates to both achievement and a cathartic experience having overcome their fears and anxieties. Research also indicates that some players even noted diminshed fear in their real lives after playing horror video games.

<doc id="356309" wikidata="Q1229098" url="?curid=356309" title="Disney California Adventure">
<text>Disney California Adventure is a theme park at the Disneyland Resort in Anaheim, California. It is owned and operated by The Walt Disney Company through its Experiences division. The park is themed after Disney&#x27;s interpretation of California, by the use of Disney, Pixar and Marvel properties. The park opened on February 8, 2001, and is the second of two theme parks built at the Disneyland Resort complex, after Disneyland.

The concept of a theme park dedicated to California arose from a meeting of Disney executives in 1995, following the cancellation of WestCOT, a planned West Coast version of Walt Disney World&#x27;s EPCOT Center. Construction of the park began in June 1998 and was completed by early 2001. Disney initially projected high attendance rates at the new park; a series of preview openings held in January 2001 led to negative reviews, however, and after the park officially opened to the public, the company&#x27;s attendance projections were never met. Disney spent the next several years incrementally adding new rides, shows, and attractions, and implementing other promotions aimed at boosting attendance. In 2007, Disney announced a major overhaul of the park consisting of new expansion as well as re-construction of existing areas of the park. Construction lasted for five years and was completed in stages, culminating with the opening of Buena Vista Street and Cars Land along with the re-dedication of the park in June 2012. The most recent addition to the park was San Fransokyo Square, which opened in August 2023.

In 2023 the park hosted approximately 10 million guests, making it the 11th-most visited theme park in the world that year.
==History==
===Concept and creation===
The present-day site of Disney California Adventure was acquired by Walt Disney in the 1950s and functioned as the parking lot of Disneyland for over 40 years. After succeeding with the multi-park business model at Walt Disney World resort in Florida, the Disney company decided to turn Walt Disney&#x27;s original theme park into a multi-park resort complex as well. Disneyland was boxed-in, however, because of the growth of Anaheim around the park; while the Walt Disney World property was 30,000 acres at the time, the Disneyland site was about 400. This consisted of the park itself, the 100-acre parking lot, and the newly acquired Disneyland Hotel and vacation property from the Wrather Corporation. In 1991, Disney announced plans to build WestCOT, a west coast version of what was then known as EPCOT Center, on the site of Disneyland&#x27;s parking lot. The price tag of the proposed park was high and the company was facing financial and public relation problems with the newly opened Euro Disneyland (now Disneyland Paris). Additionally, Disney president Frank Wells died in a helicopter crash in 1994. These issues led Disney to cancel WestCOT in 1995.

In the summer of 1995, Michael Eisner, Disney&#x27;s CEO at the time, gathered company executives in Aspen, Colorado, to think of another idea for a second theme park in California. They broke down the Disneyland problem as follows: The majority of the people visiting Disneyland consisted primarily of California residents, locals, or those traveling from nearby states. Those who were visiting from another state or another country, probably had Disneyland as one of the several attractions to do in California. Based on this, Disney decided it would instead build a park themed to California&#x27;s history and culture to keep guests at the resort instead of going off-site. This would require less expensive hotels, a single parking garage, and very little additional property acquisition, with most of the park residing on the Disneyland parking lot. Then-Disneyland president Paul Pressler relied on merchandising and retail staff instead of Imagineers to design the park. As an adult-oriented park-like Epcot, dining, and shopping were the design focus. Construction of the park began on January 22, 1998. On Main Street, USA in Disneyland, a Disney&#x27;s California Adventure Preview Center opened in October 1998. The park&#x27;s construction was accompanied by Downtown Disney and Disney&#x27;s Grand Californian Hotel, in addition to renovation of the Disneyland Hotel and the re-theming of the Disneyland Pacific Hotel into Disney&#x27;s Paradise Pier Hotel (known today as Pixar Place Hotel).

===Opening and initial criticism===
The park was expected to draw large crowds when it opened on February 8, 2001. There were four districts with 22 shows and attractions and 15 restaurants.

On January 14, a &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; article stated, &quot;Senior Disney officials acknowledge that there will be days when California Adventure will have to turn patrons away, particularly in the first weeks after the park opens, during spring break and again in the summer.&quot; The attendance that year was substantially less than expected, however. This is suggested to have happened as a result of negative reviews from early visitors. For example, Disney had originally planned the park to be aimed at adults, rather than children and families, which became the basis of significant criticism.

The park opened to 5 million visitors in 2001 while its sister park Disneyland saw 12.3 million visitors during the same time frame. Low attendance caused Disney to lower ticket prices for California Adventure, slashing as much as $10 off the park&#x27;s ticket prices. In its first year, the park averaged 5,000 to 9,000 visitors on weekdays and 10,000 to 15,000 on the weekends, despite having a capacity of 33,000. Visitor surveys reported that 20% of visitors to the park in its first year were satisfied with their experience. By October 2001, both Wolfgang Puck and Robert Mondavi had closed their high-profile restaurants in the park, citing low crowds, though Mondavi remained as a sponsor.

In the 2019 documentary series &quot;The Imagineering Story&quot;, then-Walt Disney Imagineering creative executive Kevin Rafferty described how he and other Imagineers felt about the original entrance design of California Adventure:

Reflecting on the park&#x27;s initial reception in &quot;The Imagineering Story&quot;, Barry Braverman, executive producer of California Adventure (1995–2001) stated;

===Early changes and expansions===
Two major criticisms of the park in its first year were the lack of attractions appealing to children and the lack of a nighttime show or parade to keep visitors from leaving at nightfall. Within the first year of operation, Disney&#x27;s Electrical Parade was brought to the park (where it ran until 2010) as well as Who Wants to Be a Millionaire – Play It!, and several of the park&#x27;s original rides and attractions were closed, such as the stage show Disney&#x27;s &quot;Steps in Time&quot; and the Superstar Limo ride, which were closed in 2001 and 2002, respectively. During the 2001 holiday season, &quot;Disney&#x27;s LuminAria&quot; was presented on Paradise Bay. In October 2002, Flik&#x27;s Fun Fair opened as part of the new A Bug&#x27;s Land area, which added attractions for children, and in May 2004, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; Tower of Terror opened, with Who Wants to Be a Millionaire – Play It! closing in August 2004. The park also regularly featured seasonal promotions such as concert series, food festivals, and promotions for other Walt Disney Company franchises including the X Games and ABC soap operas. Monsters, Inc. Mike &amp; Sulley to the Rescue! opened in the former Superstar Limo building in January 2006.

===Major redesign and expansion===
By 2007, Disney began making plans for major updates to the park. CEO Bob Iger said, &quot;Any time you do something mediocre with your brand, that&#x27;s withdrawal. California Adventure was a brand withdrawal.&quot; Iger briefly considered combining California Adventure and Disneyland Park into one large park, but the price would have cost as much as completely remodeling California Adventure. On October 17, 2007, The Walt Disney Company announced a multi-year, $1.1 billion redesign and expansion plan for Disney&#x27;s California Adventure Park (against its initial $600 million cost to build). Each district was reimagined to transform the park from a spoof of modern California culture to a romanticized, idealized version of the state, exploring specific time periods and historic settings inspired by Disney and Pixar stories. The project began in December 2007 and was completed in stages. Toy Story Midway Mania! opened in Paradise Pier in June 2008, in space formerly occupied by a store and restaurants. &quot;World of Color&quot;, nighttime water and lights show on Paradise Bay, opened in June 2010. That same year, the park also received a modified name; Disney California Adventure. The Little Mermaid: Ariel&#x27;s Undersea Adventure opened on the site formerly occupied by the &quot;Golden Dreams&quot; theater in June 2011.
The most drastic changes to the park included a complete overhaul of the main entrance, Sunshine Plaza, and Paradise Pier and an expansion into the last of the parking area originally designated as future growth space for the park. The main entrance and Sunshine Plaza were changed from a giant postcard design into Buena Vista Street, a representation of Los Angeles as it appeared when Walt Disney moved there in the 1920s. The giant &quot;California&quot; letters in front of the turnstiles were removed and donated to Cal Expo in Sacramento. Paradise Pier was turned from a contemporary representation of California boardwalks into a representation of Victorian seaside amusement parks of the 1920s, and some of the area&#x27;s off-the-shelf rides were either removed outright, (such as Maliboomer), or re-themed to have more of a focus on Disney characters (such as Mickey&#x27;s Fun Wheel, Goofy&#x27;s Sky School, and Silly Symphony Swings). Cars Land, an area that recreates Radiator Springs from Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Cars&quot; franchise, was added to the southeast portion of the park and features three rides, including the E ticket Radiator Springs Racers. Construction was completed in 2012 and the park was then re-dedicated on June 15, 2012.
The redesign and expansion of the park saw attendance rates increase dramatically. In 2012, Disney California Adventure reached a record high for the park of over 7 million visitors (a 23% increase from the year before), a number Disney had hoped the park would attain in its first year. The day of the park&#x27;s rededication saw the park draw a record number of 43,000 visitors in one day. The night before the rededication, over 500 people camped outside of the park in order to be the first admitted in. Two days later, the park hit a new record of 45,000 visitors. In 2013, speaking on the attendance increase at Disney California Adventure, Jay Rasulo, then-Disney&#x27;s chief financial officer, said: &quot;We had a very uneven distribution where most people spent most of their time at Disneyland and Disney&#x27;s California Adventure was empty. Now, half of the folks go to one, half of the folks go to the other. It&#x27;s almost a dream come true.&quot;

===Subsequent updates===
In 2015, the Condor Flats area of the park was re-themed into Grizzly Peak Airfield and was incorporated into the Grizzly Peak area. &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; Tower of Terror closed in January 2017 and was replaced with &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; – Mission: Breakout!, which opened in summer of the same year. Pixar Pier, a re-theme of Paradise Pier, debuted in June 2018, with the area that includes Silly Symphony Swings, Jumpin&#x27; Jellyfish, Goofy&#x27;s Sky School, Golden Zephyr and The Little Mermaid: Ariel&#x27;s Undersea Adventure becoming Paradise Gardens Park. In September 2018, A Bug&#x27;s Land was removed to make room for Avengers Campus. In addition, Jessie&#x27;s Critter Carousel (a re-theme of King Triton&#x27;s Carousel of the Sea) officially opened in Pixar Pier in April 2019, and A Bug&#x27;s Land spinner ride Flik&#x27;s Flyers was re-themed into Inside Out Emotional Whirlwind and relocated to Pixar Pier later that year at the former site of Maliboomer. Avengers Campus opened in 2021, with &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; – Mission: Breakout! then becoming part of it. San Fransokyo Square, a re-theme of the Pacific Wharf area, debuted in late August 2023.

===COVID-19 pandemic closure in 2020, partial and full reopening in 2021===

Disney California Adventure, along with the rest of the Disneyland Resort, was closed indefinitely starting on March 14, 2020, in response to the COVID-19 pandemic. The park was scheduled to reopen alongside Disneyland Park on July 17, but due to rising cases in California, both parks remained closed. In October 2020, it was announced that Buena Vista Street would open as an expansion of the Downtown Disney District. This expansion would allow for additional shops and dining options for visitors to the Disneyland Resort, while the parks remained closed under State guidelines. In February 2021, Disney California Adventure announced there would be a limited-capacity ticketed event called &quot;A Touch of Disney&quot;, which would allow Disney fans to shop and eat around the park from March 18 through April 19, 2021. On March 5, 2021, it was announced by the California Department of Public Health that Disney California Adventure was allowed to reopen with capacity restrictions beginning April 1, 2021. Then-Disney CEO Bob Chapek then announced the following week that the company planned on officially reopening the park in late April 2021. On March 17, 2021, Disney Parks, Experiences and Products announced that both Disney California Adventure and Disneyland would officially reopen on April 30, 2021, with limited capacity and social distancing and mask guidelines in effect. Mask policies were relaxed at the Disneyland Resort in the summer of 2021, but ultimately were reinstated for indoor shops and attractions in July in response to the Delta variant. In February 2022, face masks were made optional for guests who are fully vaccinated.

== Park layout and attractions ==
Disney California Adventure is divided into nine themed lands; Buena Vista Street, Hollywood Land, Avengers Campus, Cars Land, San Fransokyo Square, Performance Corridor, Pixar Pier, Paradise Gardens Park, and Grizzly Peak.

=== Buena Vista Street ===

Buena Vista Street is the first area seen upon entering the park. It represents Los Angeles in the 1920s, when Walt Disney first arrived there. Similar to Main Street, USA in Disneyland Park, it has shops, restaurants, and a transportation system. Its central hub has entrances to Hollywood Land and Grizzly Peak. In the hub&#x27;s center, also known as Carthay Circle, is a replica of the Carthay Circle Theater, where Disney&#x27;s &quot;Snow White and the Seven Dwarves&quot; debuted in 1937. Restaurants include Mortimer&#x27;s Market, Trolley Treats, Clarabelle&#x27;s Hand Scooped Ice Cream, Fiddler, Fifer &amp; Practical Cafe, and Carthay Circle Restaurant. Main stores along the street include Oswald&#x27;s, Five &amp; Dime, Big Top Toys, Kingswell Camera Shop, and Elias &amp; Co.

=== Hollywood Land ===
Hollywood Land is inspired by the Golden Age of Hollywood in the 1930s. It includes attractions based on film, television, theater and a subsection called &quot;Hollywood Studios&quot;, which is designed to appear as an active studio backlot. Found within that subsection is the 3D film &quot;Mickey&#x27;s PhilharMagic&quot; and the Monsters, Inc. Mike &amp; Sulley to the Rescue! attraction, a dark ride based on the characters from Disney·Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Monsters, Inc.&quot; The land is also home to the 2000-seat Hyperion Theater, which most recently presented . 

Disney Junior – Live on Stage! opened on March 25, 2011, in the Disney Theater. Its final day of performance was April 9, 2017. It was replaced by Disney Junior Dance Party, which opened on May 26, 2017. Nearby Disney Theater is the Animation Building, which hosts Sorcerer&#x27;s Workshop (a walk-through exhibit focused on basic animation), Animation Academy (a workshop that teaches Guests how to draw popular Disney characters), Turtle Talk with Crush, and an Elsa &amp; Anna Meet and Greet. Outside of the Animation Building and Disney Theater are the land&#x27;s two main stores: Off the Page and Gone Hollywood.

The restroom facilities in the district are designed in the style of Frank Lloyd Wright&#x27;s Storer House, located in the Hollywood Hills area of Los Angeles. The stamped concrete structure is typical of Wright&#x27;s pioneering design.

=== Avengers Campus ===
Avengers Campus is inspired by the Marvel Cinematic Universe (MCU), featuring attractions based on characters originating from Marvel Comics appearing in MCU media. The area is anchored around an Avengers campus located on the former restricted grounds of a California Stark Industries and Strategic Scientific Reserve complex. Attractions and restaurants include &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; – Mission: Breakout!, Web Slingers: A Spider-Man Adventure, and Pym Test Kitchen. The area&#x27;s shops include WEB Suppliers, Avengers Vault, and The Collector&#x27;s Warehouse.

=== Cars Land ===
Cars Land is a tribute to Route 66 and is a recreation of the town of Radiator Springs from Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Cars&quot; franchise on the town&#x27;s big race day. The land spans and contains three attractions. The largest attraction, Radiator Springs Racers, is a dark ride that utilizes the technology of Test Track at Epcot. With a budget of an estimated US$200 million, Radiator Springs Racers is the most expensive theme park ride ever built.

The other attractions at Cars Land are family attractions with smaller height requirements: Mater&#x27;s Junkyard Jamboree and Luigi&#x27;s Rollickin&#x27; Roadsters. Mater&#x27;s Junkyard Jamboree opened with Cars Land in 2012. Luigi&#x27;s Rollickin&#x27; Roadsters opened on March 7, 2016, and replaced Luigi&#x27;s Flying Tires.

The land includes several dining and shopping venues. The district serves as a connection between San Fransokyo Square, Hollywood Land, and Avengers Campus.

Starting in 2017, Cars Land receives Halloween decorations during Halloween Time at the Disneyland Resort. Two attractions, Luigi&#x27;s Rollickin&#x27; Roadsters and Mater&#x27;s Junkyard Jamboree, became Luigi&#x27;s Honkin&#x27; Haul-O-Ween and Mater&#x27;s Graveyard JamBOOree. Cars Land also receives holiday overlays, where Luigi&#x27;s Rollickin&#x27; Roadsters becomes Luigi&#x27;s Joy to the Whirl, and Mater&#x27;s Junkyard Jamboree becomes Mater&#x27;s Jingle Jamboree.

=== San Fransokyo Square ===
Located between Cars Land and Pixar Pier, San Fransokyo Square is a waterfront neighborhood inspired by California&#x27;s fishing wharfs. San Fransokyo, as seen in Disney&#x27;s 2014 film &quot;Big Hero 6&quot;, is a combination of San Francisco and Tokyo. The story of San Fransokyo Square is set after the events of the film, with the waterfront neighborhood holding a celebration in honor of the Big Hero 6 superhero team. Most of the signage in the area includes Japanese translations. The area&#x27;s restaurants include Ghirardelli Soda Fountain and Chocolate Shop, Lucky Fortune Cookery, Aunt Cass Café (Boudin Bakery), Rita&#x27;s Turbine Blenders, Cocina Cucamonga Mexican Grill, and Port of San Fransokyo Cervecería (Karl Strauss Brewing Company). The area&#x27;s shops include San Fransokyo Maker&#x27;s Market. San Fransokyo Square is also home to The Bakery Tour.

=== Performance Corridor ===
The Performance Corridor area hosts the park&#x27;s parades and cavalcades, with most starting in Paradise Gardens Park and traveling north through the Performance Corridor towards Buena Vista Street. The Performance Corridor area hosts many of the Resort&#x27;s seasonal and cultural celebrations throughout the year. Some of these celebrations include the Disney California Adventure Food &amp; Wine Festival in the spring, the Dia de los Muertos celebration during the fall (with two shows, &quot;A Musical Celebration of Coco&quot; and &quot;Mariachi Divas&quot;), the Festival of the Holidays (with &quot;Disney Viva Navidad Street Party&quot; and &quot;Mickey&#x27;s Happy Holidays&quot;), and the Lunar New Year Festival (with &quot;Mulan&#x27;s Lunar New Year Processional&quot;). The area has no attractions, but several dining locations.

=== Pixar Pier ===
Pixar Pier is inspired by Victorian boardwalks that were once found along the coast of California. The area is themed after films produced by Pixar Animation Studios, and is divided into four districts; Incredibles Park, Toy Story Boardwalk, Pixar Promenade, and Inside Out Headquarters. Its attractions include the Pixar Pal-A-Round, Incredicoaster, Jessie&#x27;s Critter Carousel, Games of Pixar Pier, Toy Story Midway Mania, and the Inside Out Emotional Whirlwind. Its main stores are Knick&#x27;s Knacks, Midway Mercantile, and Bing Bong&#x27;s Sweet Stuff, and offers table-service dining at the Lamplight Lounge. It is connected to Paradise Gardens Park at both ends; its main entrance is via a bridge under a large Pixar Pier gateway.

=== Paradise Gardens Park ===
Paradise Gardens Park has direct entrances to Pixar Pier, San Fransokyo Square and Grizzly Peak. Paradise Gardens Park is the main viewing area for the World of Color water show. Paradise Garden&#x27;s attractions include Goofy&#x27;s Sky School, Silly Symphony Swings, Jumpin&#x27; Jellyfish, Golden Zephyr, and The Little Mermaid: Ariel&#x27;s Undersea Adventure.

=== Grizzly Peak ===
Grizzly Peak is themed around California&#x27;s wilderness and national parks, with particular references to Yosemite and Redwood national parks. Its main attraction is Grizzly River Run, a Gold Rush-esque river rapids ride around the area&#x27;s summit. Nearby is the Redwood Creek Challenge Trail, a playground area with elements from Disney&#x27;s &quot;Brother Bear&quot; (2003) and Pixar&#x27;s &quot;Up&quot; (2009). It has an entrance exclusively accessible to guests of Disney&#x27;s Grand Californian Hotel &amp; Spa.

Grizzly Peak Airfield is a sub-land within Grizzly Peak, themed to an airfield in California&#x27;s High Sierras in the late 1950s and early 1960s. The area&#x27;s main attraction is &quot;Soarin&#x27;&quot;, which simulates a hang-glider tour of locations, landscapes and landmarks across six of the world&#x27;s continents. The area also includes the Smokejumpers Grill restaurant, the shop Humphrey&#x27;s Service &amp; Supplies, and a decorative fire lookout tower.

==Upcoming attractions==
The park will receive two new attractions for Avengers Campus, with construction started in 2025, as well as a ride based on Pixar&#x27;s 2017 film &quot;Coco&quot;, which is scheduled to start construction in 2026. In addition, the park will receive an area inspired by the film &quot;&quot; (2022), its upcoming sequel &quot;&quot; (2025), and future &quot;Avatar&quot; films.

==Former areas==
===Sunshine Plaza===
Sunshine Plaza was the first land guests would find after entering Disney California Adventure. It featured two stores, Engine Ears Toys and Greetings from California. At the center of the plaza was the &quot;Sun Icon&quot;.

The land closed in 2010 and was replaced by Buena Vista Street in 2012.

===Bountiful Valley Farm===
Bountiful Valley Farm was a themed area presented by Caterpillar. It featured farm equipment, different crops, and fake animals. When A Bug&#x27;s Land opened in 2002, the district was absorbed into the land. Caterpillar ended their sponsorship in 2007 and the area closed in 2010. It was replaced by Cars Land. A tribute to Bountiful Valley Farm can be found in Pym Test Kitchen in Avengers Campus on the labels of the enlarged ketchup and mustard bottles.

===Paradise Pier===
Paradise Pier opened in 2001 with the park. It featured attractions such as California Screamin&#x27;, Maliboomer, The Sun Wheel and King Triton&#x27;s Carousel of the Sea. The land closed in 2018 and reopened as Pixar Pier.

===A Bug&#x27;s Land===
A Bug&#x27;s Land (stylized &quot;a bug&#x27;s land&quot;) was inspired by Pixar&#x27;s 1998 film &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, where oversized human items were scattered throughout. It featured Flik&#x27;s Fun Fair (a collection of themed, family and child-friendly attractions such as Flik&#x27;s Flyers, Francis&#x27; Ladybug Boogie, Tuck &amp; Roll&#x27;s Drive &#x27;em Buggies, Heimlich&#x27;s Chew Chew Train, and Dot&#x27;s Puddle Park). It opened as the park&#x27;s first expansion in 2002 to expand the park&#x27;s family-friendly attractions. The land was built around the existing attraction &quot;It&#x27;s Tough to Be a Bug!&quot;, a 3D film based on &quot;A Bug&#x27;s Life&quot;, which opened with the park in 2001.

&quot;It&#x27;s Tough to Be a Bug!&quot; closed on March 19, 2018. The rest of A Bug&#x27;s Land closed on September 4, 2018, to make way for Avengers Campus. When A Bug&#x27;s Land closed in 2018, Flik&#x27;s Flyers was re-themed into Inside Out Emotional Whirlwind, inspired by Pixar&#x27;s 2015 film &quot;Inside Out&quot;, and relocated to Pixar Pier.

===Pacific Wharf===
Located between Cars Land and Pixar Pier, Pacific Wharf was themed to resemble the old waterfront of Monterey, California as a tribute to its fishing industry. Its attractions were The Bakery Tour and the Walt Disney Imagineering Blue Sky Cellar. This area was primarily an outdoor food court.

In September 2022, it was announced that Pacific Wharf would be re-themed to San Fransokyo, a combination of San Francisco and Tokyo, as seen in Disney&#x27;s 2014 film &quot;Big Hero 6&quot;. In February 2023, it was announced that the name of the re-themed area would be San Fransokyo Square. The area debuted on August 31, 2023.

==Alcohol policy==
Unlike Disneyland Park (with the exception of Carnation Cafe in Main Street, U.S.A., River Belle Terrace in Frontierland, Club 33, Blue Bayou Restaurant and Café Orleans in New Orleans Square, and Oga&#x27;s Cantina in &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge), Disney California Adventure serves beer, wine, and cocktails throughout its restaurants, stands, and food kiosks. The park also hosts the Disney California Adventure Food &amp; Wine Festival, an annual event featuring a number of themed kiosks, each featuring food and beverages from a particular aspect of California cuisine.

==Live entertainment==
Five and Dime is a traveling street show featuring Dime and her five band mates. They can be seen driving through Hollywood Land in their 1920s-style car and perform in Buena Vista Street on a stage in front of the Carthay Circle Restaurant, and &quot;World of Color&quot; is nighttime water and light show on Paradise Bay. During the holiday season, a holiday version of the show is offered. In addition, many Disney, Pixar, and Marvel Cinematic Universe characters can be found in the park, greeting visitors.

<doc id="356311" wikidata="Q2775778" url="?curid=356311" title="Soarin'">
<text>Soarin&#x27;, also known as Soarin&#x27; Over California, Soarin&#x27; Around the World, Soaring Over the Horizon and Soaring: Fantastic Flight, is a flight motion simulator attraction at Disney California Adventure, Epcot, Shanghai Disneyland, and Tokyo DisneySea. It employs a mechanical lift system, a projected presentation on an concave 180-degree dome screen, and artificial scents and wind to simulate a hang gliding flight over locations in six of the world&#x27;s continents. Many consider it the first flying theater.

The attraction&#x27;s first iteration, Soarin″ Over California, was an opening-day attraction at Disney California Adventure on February 8, 2001. It took guests over several locations in California and included a pre-show on the history of California&#x27;s aviation industry. It was also installed at Epcot in Walt Disney World as &quot;Soarin″&quot; in 2005. 

The current global version of the ride debuted at Shanghai Disneyland Park as &quot;Soaring Over the Horizon&quot; on June 16, 2016. The American versions were also replaced with the new film as &quot;Soarin″ Around the World&quot; on June 17. A fourth attraction, &quot;Soaring: Fantastic Flight&quot;, opened at Tokyo DisneySea on July 23, 2019. After an initial limited return engagement in the summer of 2019, the original &quot;Soarin&#x27; Over California&quot; has since returned to the California park annually as part of the park&#x27;s Food &amp; Wine Festival during the spring season.

==Ride design==

&quot;Soarin″&quot; was first conceptualized in 1996 as &quot;Ultra Flight&quot;, a name that can still be seen on the tower consoles of the California Adventure attraction. It was to feature an OMNIMAX screen with an inverted track, allowing guests to fly over California&#x27;s landmarks. It was to have three load levels, with a system operating on a horizontal cable, much like a dry cleaner&#x27;s rack. The plan was abandoned when it was determined that the design&#x27;s construction and labor costs would be prohibitive. It seemed that &quot;Soarin″&quot; wouldn&#x27;t become a reality until engineer Mark Sumner developed a different idea for the ride vehicles, using an Erector Set and string to create a working model. The new design allowed Disney to efficiently load guests on one level instead of three, significantly cutting its building costs.

Each ride vehicle consists of three rows of seats under a wing-like canopy, with a capacity of 87 guests. After guests have been safely restrained in the vehicle with standard lap belts, the canopy descends slightly and a cantilever system lifts the chairs forward and into the air with the guests&#x27; feet dangling freely. The vehicle is lifted forward so that guests look into a large, concave movie screen onto which aerial views are projected. The original film&#x27;s scenes were shot at an IMAX HD frame rate of 48 frames per second, twice the conventional rate of regular films. The vehicle is moved forward toward the center of the dome so guests can see only the projected images and experience the sensation of flight. The ride structure contains about one million pounds (454,000 kg) of steel; 37 tons (33.5 metric tonnes) are lifted during each ride cycle.

To enhance the illusion, subtle vertical movements of the seats are synchronized to the film. Sensations of horizontal motion are created with a combination of vertical carriage movement and turning the image on the screen. Scents complementing the scenes are also injected into the air streams blowing on riders. When it opened, the scent was only present during the Redwood Creek scene and the Valencia Orange Farms scene. In the updated show, scents include rose blossoms in the Taj Mahal scene, grass in the Africa scene, and a sea breeze in the South Pacific scene.

==Versions==
===Disney California Adventure===

&quot;Soarin″ Around the World&quot; is in the Grizzly Peak Airfield section of Disney California Adventure at the Disneyland Resort. One of the resort&#x27;s most popular attractions, it utilizes the park&#x27;s Lightning Lane Multi-Pass system, allowing guests to reserve specific ride times to avoid long queues.

While in line, guests pass the Wings of Fame, an homage to California&#x27;s aviation history, including profiles of the P-51 Mustang, SR-71 Blackbird, and Bell X-1. There is also a section dedicated to aviators such as John J. Montgomery, Amelia Earhart, Jimmy Doolittle, Charles Lindbergh, Jack Northrop, the Wright brothers, Howard Hughes, Jacqueline Cochran, Kelly Johnson, Paul MacCready, and Chuck Yeager. Inspirational music from a variety of aviation-related films is played in the queue areas, including &quot;Patton&quot;, &quot;MacArthur&quot;, &quot;Air Force One&quot;, &quot;The Blue Max&quot;, &quot;Explorers&quot; (all by Jerry Goldsmith), &quot;The American President&quot; (by Marc Shaiman), &quot;DragonHeart&quot;, &quot;&quot;, Angels in the Outfield (1994) (both by Randy Edelman), &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; (by Craig Safan), &quot;Apollo 13&quot;, and &quot;The Rocketeer&quot; (both by James Horner), &quot;Always&quot; (by John Williams) and the HBO miniseries &quot;Band of Brothers&quot; (by Michael Kamen). &quot;The Air Force Song&quot; and &quot;Jupiter&quot; from Gustav Holst&#x27;s orchestral suite &quot;The Planets&quot; are also heard, based on their use in &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;.

Before entering the theater area, guests are placed in one of three preshow areas, called Alpha Gate, Bravo Gate, and Charlie Gate (named for the first three letters of the NATO phonetic alphabet). Just before boarding, guests see a pre-boarding video hosted by their chief flight attendant, Patrick Warburton.

The attraction opened with the park in 2001 as &quot;Soarin″ Over California&quot; in what was then the park&#x27;s Condor Flats area. In early 2015, it closed for refurbishment as the surrounding area was transformed into Grizzly Peak Airfield. It reopened on May 15, 2015, with new exterior theming and updates to its screen and projection system. It now utilizes a laser illuminated digital projection array, replacing its original IMAX systems. Several exterior changes include the replacement of the mock-up RS-25 rocket engine with a fire lookout tower.

From January to March 2016, the attraction intermittently operated as &quot;Soarin″ Over California&quot; to prepare for the introduction of the &quot;Soarin″ Around the World&quot; ride film. The original film was shown until June 16, when the attraction was closed to prepare for the new film&#x27;s debut on June 17.

Since &quot;Soarin″ Around the World&quot;&#x27;s opening on June 17, 2016, visitors to Disney California Adventure are usually able to find &quot;Soarin″ Around the World&quot;&#x27; playing. However, on various occasions, Disney has brought back the original &quot;Soarin″ Over California&quot; for return engagements.

The first was on May 23, 2019, Disney announced that &quot;Soarin″ Over California&quot; would temporarily return to the park for the month of June, following the opening of &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge at Disneyland Park on May 31. On June 21, they announced that the limited return had been extended to August 31, 2019, due to popular demand. 

On February 28, 2020, the California version of the ride returned to California Adventure for the Disney California Adventure Food &amp; Wine Festival. The limited engagement was scheduled to run through April 21, but ended prematurely when the resort began its extended closure due to the COVID-19 pandemic on March 13. When the resort reopened on April 30, 2021, &quot;Soarin&#x27; Around the World&quot; was being shown. The following year, the California version began its annual temporary return for the duration of the Food &amp; Wine Festival.

===Epcot===

The attraction was duplicated, simply as &quot;Soarin″&quot;, and officially opened inside &quot;The Land&quot; pavilion at Epcot in Walt Disney World on May 5, 2005, along with Lights, Motors, Action!: Extreme Stunt Show at Disney&#x27;s Hollywood Studios as part of the Happiest Celebration on Earth festival. Unlike the Disney California Adventure version, the show had guests taking flights &quot;to&quot; California. The concept was reinforced with theming of guests being loaded into &quot;gates&quot;, with airport-themed spiels referring to &quot;Flight 5505&quot;, an homage to the attraction&#x27;s opening day. Cast members wear costumes resembling flight attendant uniforms, whereas the California version wear airfield crew uniforms.

The Epcot queue originally had pictures of natural wonders from around the world, not just California. It utilized a new infrared technology that allows guests to participate in interactive games. In 2009, this interactive technology appeared in the Magic Kingdom as part of a seven-month overhaul of Space Mountain. These interactive games were replaced with the &quot;Soarin&#x27; Challenge&quot;, a team-based game of trivia with questions pertaining to geography, landmarks, and cultures. Guests utilize displays throughout the queue and the companion &quot;Play Disney Parks&quot; smartphone app to join one of four colored teams (red, purple, yellow, and green) and help their team achieve the highest score by answering questions correctly and quickly.

The attraction closed for refurbishment on January 4, 2016, and was originally slated to reopen on June 17, with a third theater to coincide with the release of the new &quot;Soarin″ Around the World&quot; film. The ride reopened with the original film on May 27, and the change to the new film occurred on June 17, 2016.

Disney announced that &quot;Soarin&#x27; Over California&quot; would temporarily return in the park on September 22, 2023, as part of Disney 100 Years of Wonder celebration. This return run ended February 27, 2024 and &quot;Soarin&#x27; Around the World&quot; returned.

The park would undergo massive construction starting in 2019, making the ending with a flyover of the Fountain of Nations at EPCOT, which has since been turned into World Celebration&#x27;s park-like central area, outdated, with the Fountain View building and the Mouse Gear shop, which closed in November 2019 and January 2020 respectively, among other former signage and buildings, all being prominently visible in the film. On November 20, 2024, an updated ending film debuted that reflected the changes in appearance, in addition to reframing the Eiffel Tower scene, which had become popular for its curvature in most seats.

=== Shanghai Disneyland Park ===
The attraction was retooled as &quot;Soaring Over the Horizon&quot; for Shanghai Disneyland Park. It was not part of the park&#x27;s original plan, but was added to it after Walt Disney Imagineering began developing similar attractions for the U.S. parks. Located in the park&#x27;s Adventure Isle area, it opened with the park on June 16, 2016.

Embedded in the Adventure Isle setting, the attraction is presented as an ancient observatory and temple to the Arbori tribe&#x27;s Condor god. The preshow and safety spiel are hosted by a shaman of the tribe who grants guests the ability of flight, but has trouble controlling her own shapeshifting abilities.

===Tokyo DisneySea===

On April 27, 2016, Tokyo Disney Resort announced a number of coming attractions for Tokyo Disneyland and Tokyo DisneySea parks, including a proposed version of &quot;Soarin″&quot; (titled &quot;Soaring: Fantastic Flight&quot;) to be in the Mediterranean Harbor section of Tokyo DisneySea. The announcement said this version would have a different theme, with ride vehicles designed as Renaissance-era Dream Flyers created by aviator and Society of Explorers and Adventurers member Camellia Falco. It opened on July 23, 2019.

In this version of the attraction, rather than an aviation terminal, it is set in the Museum of Fantastic Flight, which is hosting a retrospective on the life of Camellia Falco. Her spirit takes guests to see some of her Dream Flyer gliders, and invites them on a flight of fantasy around the world. (Falco&#x27;s name was first seen by guests at Disneyland&#x27;s Tropical Hideaway restaurant as one of the names on a series of oars belonging to members of the Society.)

Two other differences can be seen in this version of the film: The Paris scene is replaced with Tokyo at sunset, with Mount Fuji in the background; and the finale is a flight over Tokyo DisneySea.

==Ride films==
===&quot;Soarin&#x27; Over California&quot;===

The original ride film, which lasts four minutes and 51 seconds, takes guests on a simulated hang-glider tour of California. Appropriate scents (citrus, pine, sagebrush, ocean mist) fill the air as the ride vehicles move gently to simulate the sensations of flight. In addition to the state&#x27;s various landscapes, it also highlights its diverse recreation, including snow skiing, river rafting, kayaking, golf, horseback riding, hot air ballooning, surfing, and hang gliding. Its locations are:

The original &quot;Soarin″ Over California&quot; ride film at both Disney California Adventure and Epcot has an orchestral score by Jerry Goldsmith, who is said to have come down from his first ride in tears. In addition to finding it visually beautiful and magical, he said that his father was a pilot who loved all things Californian. &quot;I&#x27;d do anything to be part of this project,&quot; Goldsmith said. &quot;I&#x27;d even score the film for free.&quot; His soundtrack plays during the entire attraction, starting with a crescendo in the low strings while the screen is still dark. Numerous variations of a serene theme for horn and strings are heard, and several statements of a fanfare accompanies the grandest vistas. The original ride score was included on Disneyland Resort and Walt Disney World official albums, including &quot;Walt Disney Records The Legacy Collection: Disneyland&quot;. It continues to be heard as ambient music in the Disneyland Resort Esplanade and Epcot&#x27;s entrance plaza.

===&quot;Soaring Over the Horizon&quot;, &quot;Soarin&#x27; Around the World&quot;, and &quot;Soaring: Fantastic Flight&quot;===
An updated version of the &quot;Soarin″&quot; attraction debuted at the Adventure Isle section of Shanghai Disneyland Park as &quot;Soaring Over the Horizon&quot; on June 16, 2016. On August 15, 2015, at the D23 Expo, it was announced that the attractions at Epcot and Disney California Adventure would debut versions of the new &quot;Soaring Over the Horizon&quot; ride film, titled &quot;Soarin″ Around the World&quot;, featuring locations, landscapes and landmarks across six continents. Unlike the original film, the updated version heavily utilizes computer generated imagery, including animated transitions between scenes, such as close encounters with a seaplane, a kite, and an eagle. The updated attractions opened on June 17, 2016, at Disney California Adventure and Epcot, along with a third theater for the latter location. The film&#x27;s locations are:
* Matterhorn in Switzerland and Italy
* Isfjord, Greenland
* Port Jackson in Sydney, Australia
* Neuschwanstein Castle in Bavaria, Germany
* Kilimanjaro National Park and Mount Kilimanjaro in Tanzania
* The Great Wall of China in China
* The Great Pyramids in Egypt
* Taj Mahal in Uttar Pradesh, India
* West and East Mitten Buttes in Monument Valley, Arizona, United States
* Lau Islands, Fiji
* Iguazu Falls in Brazil and Argentina
* Eiffel Tower in Paris, France (Shanghai Disneyland version, Disney California Adventure version, Epcot version); Tokyo Tower in Tokyo (Tokyo DisneySea version)
* Lujiazui, Shanghai, China (Shanghai Disneyland version); Disneyland, California, United States (Disney California Adventure version); Epcot, Florida, United States (Epcot version); Tokyo DisneySea, Chiba (Tokyo DisneySea version) also featuring Tinker Bell and ending with fireworks.

&quot;Soarin″ Around the World&quot; and &quot;Soaring Over the Horizon&quot; received a new score by Bruce Broughton, heavily based on Goldsmith&#x27;s original score, and performed by the London Studio Orchestra.

All versions (except the Disney California version &amp; Shanghai Disneyland version) have their home park flyover set as the grand finale.

<text>The Disneyland Resort is an entertainment resort in Anaheim, California, United States. It is owned and operated by the Walt Disney Company through its Experiences division and is home to two theme parks (Disneyland and Disney California Adventure), three hotels, and the Downtown Disney shopping, dining, and entertainment district.

The resort was developed by Walt Disney in the 1950s. When it opened to guests on July 17, 1955, the property consisted of Disneyland, its parking lot, and the Disneyland Hotel, owned and operated by Disney&#x27;s business partner Jack Wrather.

After the success with the multi-park, multi-hotel business model at Walt Disney World in Florida, Disney acquired large parcels of land adjacent to Disneyland to apply the same business model in Anaheim. The company purchased the Disneyland Hotel from Wrather in 1988 and in 1995 purchased the Pan Pacific Hotel from the Tokyu Group to become today&#x27;s Pixar Place Hotel. Land purchases continued through the 1990s and the company now owns and has long-term lease rights to develop an additional . A major expansion came in 2001 when the property saw the addition of the Grand Californian Hotel, Disney California Adventure Park, and the Downtown Disney shopping, dining, and entertainment district.

== History ==
=== Concept and construction ===

Walt Disney&#x27;s early concepts for an amusement park called for a &quot;Mickey Mouse Park&quot; located adjacent to the Walt Disney Studios in Burbank (presently the site of the West Coast headquarters of ABC). As new ideas emerged, Walt and his brother Roy realized that the Burbank location would be too small for the project, and hired a consultant from Stanford Research Institute to provide them with information on locations and economic feasibility. The consultant recommended a remote location in Anaheim, adjacent to the then-under-construction Santa Ana Freeway. The consultant correctly predicted that the locationcovered by orange groves at the timewould become the population center of Southern California.

Since the location was far from Southern California population centers in the 1950s, Walt Disney wanted to build a hotel so that Disneyland visitors traveling long distances could stay overnight. However, the park had depleted his financial resources, so he negotiated a deal with Hollywood producer Jack Wrather in which he would build and operate a hotel called the Disneyland Hotel across the street from Disneyland.

In 1963, city planner James Rouse, in a commencement speech at the Harvard Graduate School of Design, called Disneyland &quot;the greatest piece of urban design in the United States today.&quot;

=== 1955–1998: one park, one hotel ===
Disneyland opened on July 17, 1955, with a televised press preview event on ABC, and the inauguration drew nearly 30,000 guests on the first day Despite the disastrous event, later dubbed &quot;Black Sunday&quot;, during which several rides broke down, and other mishaps occurred, Disneyland became a huge success in its first year of operation. The hotel, which opened three months after the park, enjoyed similar success. Walt Disney wanted to build more facilities for Disneyland visitors to stay in Anaheim, but since his financial resources were drained, entrepreneurs established their own independent hotels in the area surrounding the park and hotel to capitalize on Disneyland&#x27;s success.

To Walt Disney&#x27;s dismay, the city of Anaheim was lax in restricting their construction, eager for the tax revenue generated by more hotels in the city. The area surrounding Disneyland became suffused with the kind of tacky atmosphere of colorful lights, flashy neon signs, and then-popular Googie architecture which he had wanted to avoid (and which years earlier had caused the city of Burbank to deny his initial request to build his project in Burbank). The Anaheim Convention Center was built across the street from Disneyland&#x27;s original parking lot, and residences were constructed in the area as part of the city&#x27;s growth in the late 20th century. Eventually, Disneyland was &quot;boxed in&quot;, a factor which would later lead Walt Disney to acquire a significantly larger parcel of land for the construction of Walt Disney World. The Walt Disney Company gradually acquired the land west of the park, notably the Disneyland Hotel in 1988 following Jack Wrather&#x27;s death in 1984, the Pan Pacific Hotel (known today as Pixar Place Hotel) in 1995, and several properties north of the Disneyland Hotel in the mid to late 1990s.

=== 1998–2001: planning an expansion ===
After Walt&#x27;s and Roy&#x27;s deaths in 1966 and 1971, respectively, the Walt Disney Company would go on to achieve success with the multi-park, multi-hotel resort complex business model of Walt Disney World in Florida, which opened in 1971. In the 1990s, Disney decided to turn Disneyland into a similar multi-park, multi-hotel resort destination. In 1991, Disney announced plans to build WestCOT, a theme park based on Walt Disney World&#x27;s EPCOT Center, mostly on the site of the 15,167-space parking lot. Its estimated cost was US$3 billion, largely due to the cost of land that Disney would need to acquire.

However, the Euro Disney Resort, which opened in 1992, was a financial and public relations burden for the company and Disney was unable to finance the WestCOT project, and it was cancelled in 1995. That summer, Disney executives gathered in Aspen, Colorado for a 3-day retreat, where they came up with the idea for a California-themed park, dubbed Disney&#x27;s California Adventure Park, a retail district, and hotels. The budget for the project would be $1.4 billion, less than half of WestCOT, achieved by building a smaller theme park only on land Disney owned, focused on shopping and dining and using many off-the-shelf rides, avoiding costly research and development. The parking lot closed on January 21, 1998 to make way for construction. To replace the lost spaces, Disney opened a seven-story, 10,250-space parking structure on July 24, 2000.

California Adventure opened on February 8, 2001 and was widely panned by critics and early visitors, leading to substantially less attendance than expected. One area of significant criticism was that the park was aimed at adults, rather than children and families. Disney executives later acknowledged that the park offered less value to visitors, with one-third as many attractions and fewer characters than Disneyland, leaving many families to chose to visit the older park instead.

=== 2001–present: Disneyland Resort complex ===
Disney began to quickly make changes to California Adventure, adding A Bug&#x27;s Land to appeal to families and &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; Tower of Terror thrill ride for older guests. In late 2007, the company began a multi-year, $1.1 billion redesign and expansion plan for California Adventure (against its initial $600 million cost to build). The most drastic changes to the park included a complete overhaul of the main entrance, the construction of a new Cars Land and the addition of the &quot;World of Color&quot; nighttime show. Additionally, many of the park&#x27;s off-the-shelf rides were either removed outright or re-themed to have more of a focus on Disney and Pixar characters. Construction was completed in 2012. The redesign and expansion of the park saw attendance rates increase dramatically.

In August 2015, it was announced that Disneyland Park would receive a 14-acre &quot;Star Wars&quot;-themed land scheduled to open in 2019. It opened on May 31, 2019. &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Galaxy&#x27;s Edge is home of two attractions, &quot;Millennium Falcon&quot; – Smugglers Run, and &quot;Star Wars&quot;: Rise of the Resistance.

In January 2017, &quot;The Twilight Zone&quot; Tower of Terror closed and was replaced with &quot;Guardians of the Galaxy&quot; – Mission: Breakout!, which opened that summer. In October 2017, Disney announced a new Pixar Pals parking structure for the resort, which includes a 6,500-space parking structure, and a new transportation hub, which opened in July 2019.

In March 2018, it was announced that A Bug&#x27;s Land would close in September 2018. It was replaced by Avengers Campus on June 4, 2021.

In April 2019, Disneyland announced that Mickey &amp; Minnie&#x27;s Runaway Railway would be coming to Disneyland in 2023. The attraction was built behind Mickey&#x27;s Toontown in a former backstage area and opened on January 27, 2023.

In January 2024, Disney&#x27;s Paradise Pier Hotel officially reopened as Pixar Place Hotel.

=== Future expansion and proposed DisneylandForward project ===
Disney announced plans to build a fourth hotel at the resort in 2016, slated for an opening in 2021. In August 2018, the hotel was placed on hold indefinitely because of a dispute with the city of Anaheim. The project was cancelled in October 2018 when the Anaheim City Council removed tax incentives.

In March 2021, Disney announced a new project for the resort called DisneylandForward. This proposal is designed to change the city of Anaheim&#x27;s zoning rules so that Disney can build more theme park space for both Disneyland and Disney California Adventure. Proposals have included building more space where Pixar Place Hotel and the surrounding parking lots on the west-side of the resort currently reside. Rumors have surfaced that a new version of a mixed-use Disney Springs would be built near the Toy Story parking lot. In May 2024, DisneylandForward received final approval from the Anaheim City Council.

== Location ==

The Disneyland Resort is located several miles south of downtown Anaheim, in an area branded by the city as the Anaheim Resort near the border of neighboring Garden Grove. The resort is generally bounded by Harbor Boulevard to the east, Katella Avenue to the south, Walnut Street to the west and Ball Road to the north. Interstate 5 borders the resort at an angle on the northeastern corner.

Not all land bordered by these streets is part of the Disneyland Resort, particularly near the intersection of Harbor Boulevard and Katella Avenue, and along Ball Road between Disneyland Drive and Walnut Street. Disneyland Drive cuts through the resort on a north–south route and provides access to the Mickey &amp; Friends Parking Structure, Downtown Disney, and the three hotels. Magic Way connects Walnut Street to Disneyland Drive just south of the Mickey &amp; Friends Parking Structure and provides access to the parking structure, Disneyland Hotel, and Downtown Disney.

Special off-ramps from Interstate 5 combined with a reversible flyover over the intersection of Ball Road and Disneyland Drive permit access into and out of the Mickey &amp; Friends and Pixar Pals parking garages during peak morning and evening traffic times.

== Facilities ==
The Disneyland Resort includes two theme parks, three hotels owned by Disney, along with a shopping, dining and entertainment complex.

=== Theme parks ===
* Disneyland, the company&#x27;s first theme park and the only one built by Walt Disney, which opened on July 17, 1955.
* Disney California Adventure, a theme park based on Disney&#x27;s interpretation of California, which opened on February 8, 2001.

=== Shopping, Dining, and Entertainment ===
* Downtown Disney, a outdoor shopping, dining, and entertainment district with approximately 30 venues, mostly operated by third parties that pay rent to Disney.

=== Hotels ===
The Disneyland Resort includes three company owned and operated hotels with approximately 2,400 rooms, 180 Disney Vacation Club villas, and of conference meeting space.
* Disneyland Hotel, the resort&#x27;s original hotel built by Jack Wrather which opened on October 5, 1955, and was purchased by Disney in 1988.
* Pixar Place Hotel, a hotel themed to artwork created by Pixar Animation Studios. Opened in 1984 as the Emerald of Anaheim, operated by the Tokyu Group and later named The Pan Pacific Hotel Anaheim, the hotel was purchased by Disney in December 1995, for a reported US$36 million, and renamed the Disneyland Pacific Hotel. As part of the 1998–2001 expansion of the resort, it was re-branded as Disney&#x27;s Paradise Pier Hotel. The lobby and convention/banquet facilities had undergone several renovations since the re-branding, most notably in 2004 and 2005. It officially reopened as Pixar Place Hotel on January 30, 2024.
* Disney&#x27;s Grand Californian Hotel &amp; Spa, based on the Craftsman style of architecture of the early 1900s, which opened on January 2, 2001.

== Ticket prices ==
Approximately 60,000 people visited the park on Disneyland&#x27;s opening day, July 17, 1955, when park admission was priced at $1 for adults and 50¢ for children. This did not include access to rides and other individual attractions; attraction tickets could be purchased separately for 10¢ to 35¢. Single attraction tickets were permanently eliminated in June 1982; access to all the park&#x27;s attractions were included in the price of park admission.

Admission prices have greatly increased since the gates first opened, due in part to inflation, the continuing construction and renovation of attractions, and the addition of a second theme park, Disney California Adventure. one-day &quot;Park Hopper&quot; tickets, allowing entry to both Disneyland and Disney California Adventure, are priced from $154 to $199 for adults, and from $148 to $191 for children. Visitors can also purchase one-park tickets and multi-day tickets.

In addition to daily tickets, in 1984 an annual pass (called an &quot;Annual Premium Passport&quot;) was introduced granting daily entry for a year at a time for $65 for adults and $49 for children. Currently annual passes (now called the &quot;Magic Key&quot;) range in price from $399 to $1,339.

<doc id="356316" wikidata="Q1611703" url="?curid=356316" title="Pragmatic Sanction of Bourges">
<text>The [[Pragmatic sanction|Pragmatic Sanction]] of Bourges, issued by King Charles VII of France, on 7 July 1438, required a General Church Council, with authority superior to that of the papacy, to be held every ten years, required election rather than appointment to ecclesiastical offices, prohibited the pope from bestowing and profiting from benefices, and forbade appeals to the Roman Curia from places further than two days&#x27; journey from Rome. The Pragmatic Sanction further stipulated that interdict could not be placed on cities unless the entire community was culpable. The king accepted many of the decrees of the Council of Basel without endorsing its efforts to coerce Pope Eugene IV.

The Catholic Church of France, in the eyes of some, declared administrative independence from the church in Rome. The Catholic Church of France suppressed the payment of annates to Rome and forbade papal intervention in the appointment of French prelates. While this resulted in a loss of papal power in France, the movement of conciliarists itself was divided. In 1449, the Council of Basel was dissolved, and the Concilliar movement suffered a nearly fatal blow.

The popes, especially Pius II (), lobbied the French clergy to seek the repeal of the Pragmatic Sanction, and the French crown used promises of repeal as an inducement to the papacy to embrace policies favoring its interests, especially its military campaigns in the Italian peninsula. The Pragmatic Sanction was eventually superseded by agreements made between the French crown and Rome, especially the 1516 Concordat of Bologna.

<text>TransLink, formally the South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority and previously the Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority, is the statutory authority responsible for the regional transportation network of Metro Vancouver in British Columbia, Canada, including public transport, major roads and bridges. Its main operating facilities are located in the city of New Westminster.

TransLink was created in 1998 as the Greater Vancouver Transportation Authority (GVTA) and was fully implemented in April 1999 by the Government of British Columbia to replace BC Transit in the Greater Vancouver Regional District and assume many transportation responsibilities previously held by the provincial government. TransLink is responsible for various modes of transportation in the Metro Vancouver region as well as the West Coast Express, which extends into the Fraser Valley Regional District (FVRD). On November 29, 2007, the province of British Columbia approved legislation changing the governance structure and official name of the organization.

==History==
=== 2007 reorganization ===

On March 8, 2007, BC Minister of Transportation Kevin Falcon announced a restructuring of TransLink. Major changes include new revenue-generating measures, a restructuring of the executive of the body, and increases in the areas under TransLink&#x27;s jurisdiction.

The reorganization of TransLink proposed the following changes:

* The old board will be replaced by a Council of Mayors from the municipalities in the area served by TransLink, a board of non-political experts, and a regional transportation commissioner appointed by the Council of Mayors.
* The provincial government will set the regional transportation vision.
* The Board will guide the operation of TransLink as per the 3- and 10-year transportation plans. It will also develop the options for 3- and 10-year plans; one option will be a base option that maintains the status quo.
* The Council of Mayors will vote on which 3- and 10-year transportation plan options to adopt. Mayors will receive one vote per 20,000 people or portion thereof in their jurisdiction.
* The TransLink independent commissioner will ensure that TransLink&#x27;s 3- and 10-year transportation plans are consistent with the regional transportation vision set by the provincial government.
* TransLink&#x27;s jurisdiction is initially planned to be expanded to include Mission, Abbotsford, and Squamish. In the long term, this may be further expanded to include the area along the Sea-to-Sky Highway as far north as Pemberton and east to Hope.
* TransLink will be funded using an approximate ratio of 1/3 of revenue from fuel taxes, 1/3 of revenue from property taxes, and 1/3 of revenue from other non-government sources (e.g., fares, advertising, property development).
* TransLink will hold the power to increase funding from fuel tax from 12 cents per litre (55 cents per Imp gal or 45 cents per US gal) to 15 cents per litre (68 cents per Imp gal or 57 cents per US gal). In 2012, the rate was increased to 17 cents.
* TransLink will increase funding by raising property taxes, parking sales taxes, and other sources of revenue (e.g., fares, property development).
* TransLink will eliminate the parking tax (different from parking sales tax) and the BC Hydro transportation levy.
* AirCare will be removed from TransLink&#x27;s authority and will become the responsibility of Metro Vancouver.
* The provincial government will continue to contribute toward rapid transit projects, but funding will be contingent on municipalities increasing population densities around planned rapid transit stations.

Falcon had called the old board &quot;dysfunctional&quot;, saying that board members were focused on the interests of their own municipalities instead of the broader interests of the region. According to Falcon, the board of directors had &quot;no ability there to develop the skill-set to understand major, multi-billion projects.&quot; British Columbia New Democratic Party critic David Chudnovsky responded that the reorganization was &quot;ludicrous&quot; and that its purpose was &quot;to get power away from our elected municipal politicians because once in a while they disagree with the aggressive privatization agenda of Mr. Falcon&quot;. Chudnovsky was also worried about the consequences of a property development slowdown.

On April 26, 2007, the provincial government introduced legislation to restructure TransLink. The proposed successor body was to be known as the South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority. The legislation received Royal Assent on November 29, 2007, and came into effect on January 1, 2008, with some parts of the organization, like the Council of Mayors, beginning functions the day after the legislation was approved.

On March 19, 2008, the &quot;Vancouver Sun&quot; reported that TransLink was launching a real estate division that could produce over $1.5billion in revenue over the ensuing ten years.

NDP critic Maurine Karagianis introduced a private member&#x27;s bill dubbed the &quot;TransLink Openness Act&quot;.

=== 2015 plebiscite ===
In 2015, residents of Metro Vancouver were asked to vote in a mail-in plebiscite on a proposal to adopt a new 0.5 percent sales tax to fund improvements in transit infrastructure, and completion of current TransLink projects. Ballots were mailed in March, and had to be returned by 8:00 pm on May 29, 2015.

The tax was designed to generate annual revenue of $250million to help fund an $8billion, 10-year transit plan including the following projects:
* Adding bus service and 11 new B-Line rapid bus routes
* Increasing service on SkyTrain, SeaBus, and West Coast Express
* Maintaining and upgrading of major roads
* Building a new Pattullo Bridge
* Building LRT connecting Surrey Centre with Guildford, Newton, and Langley
* Extending the Millennium Line along Broadway in Vancouver
* Extending cycling and pedestrian walkway networks

The tax was supported by environmental groups, student groups and nearly every local government. Opposition to the tax was headed by the Canadian Taxpayers Federation who drew the public&#x27;s attention to purported misuse of funds by TransLink. Supporters countered with other analyses that showed TransLink to be ranked first by cost per service hour, service hours per $1million and service hours per capita. The Yes campaign outspent the No campaign by $5.8million to $40,000. Surveys conducted by Insights West showed the Yes side ahead in December 2014, but support dropped to 37 per cent the week before the ballots were mailed. After the failure of the plebiscite, several executives at TransLink were removed from their positions.

==== Results ====


=== &quot;10-Year Investment Plan&quot; ===
After the failure of the 2015 plebiscite, TransLink developed the &quot;10-Year Investment Plan&quot; in 2017. The plan was structured to be delivered in three phases over ten years, starting in April 2017.

==== As originally released ====
Phase one was scheduled to be rolled out between 2017 and 2026, and it included the launch of five new B-Lines, and service improvements on buses, SkyTrain, SeaBus, and HandyDART. TransLink planned to purchase 171 more buses, 50 new SkyTrain cars, five new West Coast Express passenger cars, and one new SeaBus vessel. It also provided funding for improved roads, cycling paths, and sidewalks.

Phase two was scheduled to be rolled out between 2018 and 2027, and it included the construction of the Broadway SkyTrain extension, the construction of the Surrey–Newton–Guildford LRT, the launch of two more B-Lines, the replacement of the Pattullo Bridge, pre-construction of the Surrey–Langley LRT, and more rail and station upgrades on the existing SkyTrain network. It also included continued service improvements on buses and HandyDART, and continued funding for improved roads, cycling paths, and sidewalks.

Phase three is the final delivery of the &quot;10-Year Investment Plan&quot;, which was scheduled to be rolled out between 2020 and 2030. It included four new B-Lines, more service improvements on buses, SkyTrain, and HandyDART service. It also included the construction of the Surrey–Langley LRT as well as continued funding for improved roads, cycling paths, and sidewalks.

==== Implementation and alterations ====
Phase one was approved by the Mayors&#x27; Council in November 2016; implementation began in January 2017. Phase two was approved in June 2018, and phase three is scheduled for approval in 2019.

In November 2018, the Surrey light rail system, including the Surrey–Newton–Guildford (SNG) route and the Surrey–Langley route, was rejected by Surrey City Council after a municipal government change that saw Doug McCallum return to the city&#x27;s mayorship. McCallum had campaigned on cancelling the plans for light rail and instead extending the Expo Line from King George station to Langley. This plan was approved by the Mayors&#x27; Council in principle that same month, but the $1.65billion in funding that was earmarked for the light rail project, which was intended to be repurposed to construct the extension to Langley, was determined to be insufficient to fund the entire extension, with $1.9billion more needed to complete the project. The existing funding would only extend the line to Fleetwood in Surrey and add four new stations, terminating at 166th Street. In July 2019, the Mayors&#x27; Council voted to extend the Expo Line to Fleetwood using these existing funds. The council also voted to proceed with preparing a detailed business case for the full Surrey–Langley SkyTrain extension, which was expected to be completed by early 2020. Revenue service to Fleetwood was projected to start in late 2025; however, the project has been postponed to 2028.

==Transit services==

===Buses===

Buses in Metro Vancouver are operated by three companies. Coast Mountain Bus Company operates regular transit buses, generally powered by diesel or natural gas, in most of the region&#x27;s municipalities, in addition to trolley buses, primarily within the city of Vancouver. The District Municipality of West Vancouver operates the Blue Bus system serving West Vancouver and Lions Bay. Transdev is contracted by TransLink to operate nine community shuttle bus routes in Langley and on Bowen Island, in addition to operating all HandyDART services in Metro Vancouver. The schedules, fares, and routes of these services are integrated with other transit services operated by TransLink.

Within the city of Vancouver, buses generally run on a grid system, with most trolley bus routes operating radially out of downtown and along north–south arteries, and most diesel buses providing east–west crosstown service, with the University of British Columbia (UBC) as their western terminus. Outside the city of Vancouver, most buses operate on a hub-and-spoke system along feeder routes that connect with SkyTrain, SeaBus, West Coast Express, or other regional centres.

Six high-capacity, high-frequency RapidBus express routes use mostly articulated buses, rounding out the regional public transportation backbone provided by SkyTrain, SeaBus, and West Coast Express.

Electric trolley buses operate on major routes in the city of Vancouver, with one route extending to neighbouring Burnaby. Most trolley bus routes operate in a north–south direction. Trolley buses receive electricity from a network of overhead wires. In the fall of 2006, TransLink introduced a new generation of electric trolley buses, replacing the old models built in the early 1980s. The new trolley buses have low floors and are fully wheelchair accessible.

Many local routes are served by buses manufactured by New Flyer and Nova Bus. TransLink has begun using hybrid diesel-electric buses. Some suburban routes use Orion highway coaches with high-back reclining seats, overhead reading lights and luggage racks. After a successful pilot project through 2017 and 2018, TransLink announced the purchase of 32 Alexander Dennis Enviro500 double-decker buses. TransLink began using double-decker buses to serve the 555, 620, and 301 routes. More double-decker buses were deployed to more routes starting in September 2020.

In 2007, all TransLink buses became designated fare paid zones. Under this system, a rider is required to be in possession of a valid fare (transfer or transit pass) while on board the bus and produce it upon request by a transit official. Enforcement of fares is conducted by Transit Security officers. On all RapidBuses, as well as the 99 B-Line, larger, , three-door buses allow passengers to board through rear doors. As they are bypassing the driver and fare box, they must have a valid fare in their possession. On all other buses, passengers are required to board through the front doors and should produce a valid fare to the bus driver. Fare inspections on buses are normally conducted by Transit Security officers and on occasion by the South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service. Failure to produce proof of payment may result in ejection from the bus and/or a fine of $173.

TransLink also operates a late-night bus service, called NightBus, on 10 routes extending from downtown throughout the city and to several suburbs. NightBuses leave downtown Vancouver until 4:30 a.m. Transit Security officers ride some of the night buses and respond to calls onboard others. These buses are popular since SkyTrain ends service at 1:30 a.m. but downtown clubs and bars do not close until 3 a.m.

===SkyTrain===
The first SkyTrain line, which later became known as the Expo Line, was built in 1985 as a transit showcase for Expo 86. The automated rapid transit system has become an important part of the region&#x27;s transportation network. The Expo Line operates from downtown Vancouver to southern Burnaby, New Westminster, and Surrey.

The system was expanded with the opening of the Millennium Line in 2002, which connects Coquitlam, Port Moody, Burnaby, and Vancouver. Construction on the Evergreen Extension of the Millennium Line began in 2012 and completed in 2016, expanding service from Lougheed Town Centre to Coquitlam.

The Canada Line, which was opened on August 17, 2009, runs underground through Vancouver and then along an elevated guideway with two branches, to Richmond and Vancouver International Airport. It meets the Expo Line at Waterfront station in downtown Vancouver, but it is operationally independent and there is no track connection between them.

The Expo Line and Millennium Line are operated by British Columbia Rapid Transit Company Ltd., a subsidiary of TransLink. The Canada Line is operated by ProTrans BC, a division of SNC-Lavalin.

===West Coast Express===

The West Coast Express is a commuter railway connecting downtown Vancouver to Metro Vancouver municipalities to the east and terminating in Mission in the FVRD, north of the Fraser River. It is operated by the British Columbia Rapid Transit Company.

===SeaBus===

SeaBus is a passenger ferry service across Burrard Inlet between Vancouver and the North Shore municipalities that is operated by Coast Mountain Bus Company and integrated with the transit system. It holds approximately 400 people and sails every 15 minutes during rush hour.

== Fares ==

Fares depend on how many fare zones a passenger passes through and they differ for those paying with stored value on their Compass cards versus those paying by cash or contactless credit card. Cash and stored value fares are the same for concession riders. Cash and contactless credit card fares are equal. Fares were last increased on July 1, 2024.

Compass card holders and those with Compass transfers (issued by Compass vending machines at SkyTrain, SeaBus, and West Coast Express stations) are permitted unlimited transfers within a 90-minute period on the bus or on SkyTrain or SeaBus. All buses are considered one-zone fares, but cash fares on buses are not transferable to the SkyTrain or SeaBus owing to technological incompatibility between bus fare box–issued transfers and Compass fare readers. Zone fares apply weekdays before 6:30 p.m. During evenings and on weekends, passengers can travel throughout the system on a one-zone fare.

There is a $5 surcharge, the &quot;YVR AddFare&quot;, applied to most fares paid at Canada Line stations on Sea Island—YVR–Airport, Sea Island Centre, and Templeton—for eastbound trips to Bridgeport station or beyond. Trips using a monthly pass are exempt, as are trips using DayPasses purchased and activated off Sea Island. Trips the three stations are not subject to the surcharge. Trips between the three Sea Island stations are free.

Beginning September 2021, fares were adjusted so to that children aged 13 and younger were permitted to ride for free. Concession fares apply to youths aged 14–18 with identification proving age, and seniors aged 65 and over. Students from all public post-secondary institutions in the Lower Mainland, with the exception of the Justice Institute of British Columbia, receive a U-Pass, which is included in student fees. The pass is valid across all three zones.

=== Fare paid zones ===
A fare paid zone is a clearly marked territory on which passengers must have valid proof of payment and produce it for inspection upon request of a Transit Employee. Initially, these were only in effect in SkyTrain and SeaBus stations and vehicles until June 25, 2007, when the law was changed. Now, all buses, including West Vancouver buses, are designated fare paid zones. The reason for implementing fare paid zones on buses was to remove the responsibility of fare enforcement from bus drivers, as too many of them were being assaulted in disputes over fare payment. Fare enforcement on all buses are now the responsibility of the Transit Police and Transit Security Department. Officers may conduct a fare inspection at any time. Those who fail to pay the fare or fail to produce a valid fare could be removed from the transit system and/or fined $173. Currently, only Transit Security and Transit Police have the authority to issue fare evasion fines. Customer Service Attendants and other transit employees may request compliance in regards to fares, but have no authority to issue a fine.

Failure to pay the fare or produce valid proof of payment is an offence. Fare inspections are conducted by the South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Police Service and Transit Security. Fraudulent use of fares (e.g., using a fake pass, using another person&#x27;s non-transferable pass,) may result in criminal charges. Passengers found without a valid fare or who fail to produce valid proof of payment are served with an Infraction Ticket of $173, under the Fare Collection Regulation. In September 2012, amendments to the &quot;South Coast British Columbia Transportation Authority Act&quot; came into effect, making TransLink responsible for collection of fines issued by Transit Police and Transit Security. Since October 5, 2015, all bus travel is considered one-zone travel and no additional fares are required for crossing fare boundaries on the bus.

On April 4, 2016, TransLink&#x27;s new fare gates were implemented for ridership on SkyTrain and SeaBus. To open the fare gates, to enter or exit the system, a Compass card or Compass ticket (purchased from a Compass vending machine) must be used. Compass cards may be used to pay fares on and buses, although FareSaver tickets may still be used on buses. Paper passes continue to be issued on buses for fares paid in cash. Neither FareSavers nor the transfer tickets may be used to open fare gates. Compass cards work on all transit services using a tap in method to pay fares. Tap out however is not required on buses. The cards may be loaded with monthly passes, day passes, or stored value, or any combination, with the ability to auto-load the fare choice. Annual passes have been eliminated.

After the December 2015 TransLink announcement that the gates would close on April 4, 2016, groups working with those who have disabilities complained about potential accessibility problems with the fare gate system. TransLink&#x27;s response was to have staff assist those with disabilities enter or exit the system, or to leave the gates open when staff were not present. This lasted until July 25, 2016, when the gates were fully closed. No data have been presented to indicate if the system has reduced fare evasion, estimated at between $6 and $7million per year, which was the promise of the new $194million system, although preliminary data showed that revenue had increased by 7 percent after its introduction.

On May 22, 2018, the ability to pay with contactless Visa and Mastercard credit cards (including mobile payment software) was added to Compass readers. Fares paid in this manner are charged at the full cash fares.

=== COVID-19 response ===
On March 20, 2020, TransLink suspended fare collection on all buses indefinitely in an effort to respond to the COVID-19 pandemic in the province, specifically to meet physical distancing requirements in combating the spread of COVID-19. Part of the measures included allowing the boarding and alighting of passengers only via a bus&#x27; rear door, which lack the means to collect cash fares. Those needing mobility assistance could continue boarding through the front door. TransLink later reduced capacity on all buses by 50 percent to further physical distancing goals. No changes to fares or capacity were implemented for the SeaBus, the SkyTrain or the West Coast Express. On June 1, 2020, TransLink resumed fare collection on buses, citing improved safety features for drivers and the over $2 million a month in lost revenue due to the fare suspension.

== Ridership ==


== Transit security ==
Coast Mountain Bus Company operates TransLink&#x27;s Transit Security department. Transit security officers are mobile, ride buses and trains, inspect fares, issue fines and patrol TransLink properties. They work closely with transit police to ensure safety throughout the transit network. Transit security officers are authorized to arrest persons committing criminal offences on or in relation to any TransLink property, under the Canadian &quot;Criminal Code&quot;. They are also authorized to enforce the &quot;Transit Conduct and Safety Regulations&quot; and the Transit Tariff Bylaw. The Transit Security department is also responsible for the CCTV camera system aboard buses.

On November 14, 2006, the Canadian government announced that it would spend million for improvements to transit security across Canada, including $9.8million for the Vancouver area. CCTV cameras have been installed on all TransLink buses newer than 2006, except for Community Shuttle units.

===Transit police===

TransLink replaced its special provincial constables, who held limited policing power, with the Metro Vancouver Transit Police in December 2005. In contrast to the former TransLink special constables, transit police constables have full police powers both on and off of TransLink property. They are based in New Westminster, BC.

== Branding ==
Shortly after its inception, TransLink&#x27;s board of directors approved replacement of the old BC Transit colours with TransLink&#x27;s new blue and yellow colour scheme, or livery. It also created brands for the agency&#x27;s different services, each with a different logo based on these colours, with the exception of the West Coast Express. The board decided against changing West Coast Express&#x27;s purple colour to blue, since purple and yellow create a premium brand differentiable from TransLink&#x27;s blue and yellow livery. Repainting of vehicles did not incur any additional costs, as it was completed during regular maintenance repaints or new vehicle purchases. At the time of approval, TransLink estimated that it would take until the end of 2007 to convert the entire fleet to the new livery.

In 2001, TransLink introduced a new set of long-distance buses under the ExpressBus brand with its own livery. In 2018, TransLink began to replace these buses and the ExpressBus livery was abandoned for a revised version of the new corporate livery introduced in 2005.

In 2003, TransLink placed an order for 228 new trolley buses which began to arrive in 2005. These buses featured a new livery composed of yellow, blue, and two shades of grey, which was then adopted as a permanent corporate livery. This new livery was later added to older SeaBus vessels and SkyTrain rolling stock in an attempt to unify the fleet.

In January 2020, TransLink converted most of its B-Line service into a new service called RapidBus, whose vehicles sported a new livery. The RapidBus livery is a variation of the standard TransLink livery but features a green-and-blue colour scheme.

== Infrastructure and planning services ==
TransLink maintains some pieces of infrastructure in the region, in addition to its core public transit services.

=== Major Road Network ===
TransLink works with municipalities within the region to plan and maintain the region&#x27;s Major Road Network (MRN). The MRN consists of major arterial roads throughout the region which carry commuter, transit, and truck traffic. The network serves to connect the provincial highway system with local municipalities&#x27; road networks. TransLink contributes funding for the operation and maintenance of the MRN, but ownership and operation of the roads remain with the local municipalities. Road, cycling, and pedestrian improvement projects in the MRN are also partially funded by TransLink. As a part of the MRN, TransLink also owns and maintains five bridges within the region:

* Canada Line bike and pedestrian bridge
* Golden Ears Bridge
* Knight Street Bridge
* Pattullo Bridge
* Westham Island Bridge

In December 2018, of roadway was added to the MRN. This was the largest one-time addition to the MRN since the arterial roadway network designation was created in 1998.

=== Transit-related improvements ===
TransLink allocates funding to each municipality for transit improvements, such as transit priority signals, queue-jumping lanes for buses, and bus lanes. TransLink contributes up to half of the costs of municipal capital projects, up to the maximum funding allocated to each municipality.

=== Cycling ===
TransLink employs several engineers and planners who administer its bicycle program. TransLink works with many cycling stakeholders, such as the Vancouver Area Cycling Coalition.

TransLink invests $6million in cycling each year (as of 2007). This money is spread among capital and operating projects, with some allocated to cost-sharing programs, which result in additional investment in cycling.

Metro Vancouver has a growing network of cycling paths. TransLink allocates funding to each municipality for cycling improvements, such as bike paths, through a cost-sharing program called the Bicycle Infrastructure Capital Cost Sharing Program. TransLink contributes up to half of the costs of municipal capital projects, up to the maximum funding allocated to each municipality. Municipalities are eligible to apply for a share of the available funding each year. Most of the funding is allocated this way, while some funding is available in a competitive process called Regional Needs. The funding process is overseen by the Bicycle Working Group, composed of municipal cycling staff.

TransLink also produces a regional cycling map, which is available for sale or as a free PDF file downloadable from its website. Many municipalities also produce their own local cycling maps.

TransLink supports many cycling-related community initiatives and events, particularly Bike Month, held every June.

All modes of transit in Metro Vancouver carry bicycles. Most buses operated by TransLink have bike racks, supplied by SportWorks. Bikes are allowed on SeaBus. Bikes are also allowed on SkyTrain, except during weekday rush hours in the peak direction of travel (inbound to Vancouver in the morning rush hour and outbound from Vancouver in the evening rush hour).

TransLink installs and maintains bicycle parking racks and lockers at SkyTrain stations and transit interchanges through private contractors.

In 2022, TransLink launched a &quot;Bike Bus&quot; pilot project, establishing an additional bus line between Bridgeport station and Tsawwassen ferry terminal. The route runs along the existing 620 route and uses retrofitted buses with 7 interior bike racks for a total capacity of 9 bikes and 17 passengers. In 2023, the route was reinstated, running Friday to Sunday from June 30 to September 3.

=== Emission control ===
AirCare was a regionally mandated automobile emissions program operated by a subsidiary of TransLink. The program was discontinued on December 31, 2014.

==Accessibility==
All vehicles, stations, and facilities are fully accessible; however, several issues exist on parts of the system, notably wheelchair accessibility in some areas. Improvements have been made, and accessibility issues became particularly important with the hosting of the Paralympic Winter Games in 2010. Because of this, TransLink initiated the Access Transit Project, whose final report was completed in June 2007.

===Buses===
All buses in the TransLink fleet are accessible, with most being low-floor vehicles that have ramps, although some are high-floor vehicles that have specially designed lifts. However, some stops are considered inaccessible if there is insufficient room to deploy the lifts or ramps.

There is space for two wheelchairs on each bus, and the wheelchair area is also used for walkers and baby strollers. Passengers using wheelchairs have priority for these positions, and lower-priority users (such as those with strollers) are required to vacate the space as needed.

In August 2006, TransLink began replacing its entire fleet of inaccessible electric trolley buses with 188 standard low-floor accessible trolley buses. In 2008 and 2009, it purchased 74 new articulated low-floor accessible trolley buses, which are used on routes #3 (Main), #8 (Fraser), #10 (Granville), and #20 (Victoria). By the end of 2009, the entire fleet of trolley buses was low-floor and accessible.

In late 2008, TransLink introduced voice announcement systems on most buses to help those with vision impairments or unfamiliar with the region and to allow operators to focus on driving instead of making announcements. The annunciators use a computer-generated voice to call out bus stops and other messages, using GPS technology installed on each bus to identify the bus&#x27;s location and the next stop. There were a few problems with the system, however, such as audio quality and volume levels.

===SkyTrain===
All of the SkyTrain network, including stations and vehicles, is accessible. Older Bombardier Mark I cars have one wheelchair-designated spot, while the Bombardier Mark II and Mark III cars, along with the Hyundai Rotem cars, have two.

Some newer accessibility features introduced include Bombardier Mark II and Mark III cars with door indicator lights and LED route maps.

===SeaBus===
All SeaBus vessels and both Lonsdale Quay and Waterfront station are accessible.

===West Coast Express===

All West Coast Express trains and stations are accessible. Ramps are provided at stations for boarding, and trains have two wheelchair spaces on most cars, and an accessible washroom.

===HandyDART===
HandyDART is a supplementary system that provides transportation service to those who are unable to use the regular system due to mobility problems or a lack of accessible transit. HandyDART service is operated by seven different contractors throughout Metro Vancouver, most of which are not-for-profit corporations. Dispatch, reservations, and trip deliveries are handled by Transdev, having acquired the previous operator, First Transit, in 2023.

HandyDART users apply for a pass and pay for each trip. Each trip must be pre-booked, up to one week in advance, and is subject to availability at the desired time. Each contractor operates regionally, meaning that it is not always possible to use HandyDART for an entire trip (for example, from Burnaby to Vancouver). If there is no HandyDART vehicle available for a trip, a taxi is provided instead. Taxis are used for 17 percent of trips, which has sparked concerns among riders and advocates.

==Governance==

===Mayors&#x27; Council===
The Mayors&#x27; Council is composed of the 21 mayors of Metro Vancouver municipalities and the Chief of Tsawwassen First Nation, who represent the interests of citizens of the region. It approves plans prepared by TransLink, including transportation plans, regional funding, and borrowing limits. Each year, the Mayors&#x27; Council appoints three new directors to TransLink&#x27;s Board of Directors from a shortlist of candidates prepared by the screening panel.

===Screening panel===
Under the terms of provincial legislation, each year the screening panel prepares a shortlist of candidates for TransLink&#x27;s board of directors. The shortlist must consist of at least five candidates for the three available positions on the board of directors. The screening panel is composed of five members. Each of the following organizations must appoint one person to the Screening Panel: 
* Vancouver Board of Trade
* Chartered Accountants of BC
* Greater Vancouver Gateway Council
* British Columbia&#x27;s Minister of Transportation and Infrastructure
* Mayors&#x27; Council

=== Board of directors and chief executive officer===

The board is responsible for hiring, compensating, and monitoring the performance of the CEO and for providing oversight of TransLink&#x27;s strategic planning, finances, major capital projects, and operations. While the board conducts four public meetings a year, most of its deliberations are conducted in closed meetings.

Board members are appointed to serve a three-year term and can be reappointed for a second term. Most have extensive ties to private businesses.

===Regional transportation commissioner===
Provincial legislation passed in June 2014 dissolved the position of the regional transportation commissioner. Prior to this time, the regional transportation commissioner approved all cash fare increases greater than the rate of inflation. The commissioner also approved TransLink&#x27;s plans for annual customer satisfaction surveys, its customer complaint process, and any proposed sale of major assets. The regional transportation commissioner operated separately from the Mayors&#x27; Council, the TransLink board of directors, and TransLink staff.

===Criticism of governance model===
In 2013, a report commissioned by the Mayors&#x27; Council criticized TransLink&#x27;s governance model, stating that TransLink lacked &quot;accountability to the population being served, which is almost completely missing from the present arrangements&quot;. The report also stated that the absence of mechanisms to &quot;ensure accountability, effectiveness, and efficiency&quot; made TransLink&#x27;s governance &quot;unique in the world and not in a good way&quot;.

<text>Margaret Elizabeth Thomas &quot;Mardy&quot; Murie (August 18, 1902 – October 19, 2003) was a naturalist, writer, adventurer, and conservationist. Dubbed the &quot;Grandmother of the Conservation Movement&quot; by both the Sierra Club and the Wilderness Society, she helped in the passage of the Wilderness Act, and was instrumental in creating the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. She was the recipient of the Audubon Medal, the John Muir Award, and the Presidential Medal of Freedom—the highest civilian honor awarded by the United States.

==Early life==

Born Margaret Elizabeth Thomas on August 18, 1902 in Seattle, Washington, Murie moved to Fairbanks, Alaska, with her family when she was nine years old. She attended Reed College in Oregon for two years before transferring to Simmons College in Massachusetts for a year, then transferred to and became the first woman to graduate from the Alaska Agricultural College and School of Mines (now the University of Alaska Fairbanks); she graduated in 1924 with a degree in business administration. She met Olaus Murie in Fairbanks, and they married in 1924 at sunrise in Anvik, Alaska.

From 1927 onward, the Muries were residents of Jackson, Wyoming, where Olaus studied ecology, specifically the elk population. Mardy worked side-by-side with Olaus in the field, studying elk, sheep and numerous other animals in the Greater Yellowstone Ecosystem. The couple would camp for weeks at a time in the wild, open valley of Jackson Hole. Olaus&#x27; primary goal was to identify pressures on the elk population, causing the startling decrease in the area. Over the course of nearly 40 years, The couple had numerous backcountry expeditions tracking the wildlife in the area. The couple even took expeditions when their three children were still nursing.

After World War II, they chose to buy a dude ranch after Mardy decided she no longer wanted to live in town; she wanted to walk out her back door and into the woods. The Murie Ranch became a hub for conversations and problem solving to protect the wild. Olaus and Mardy took on work as director and secretary of the Wilderness Society, helping draft recommendations for legislation and policy like the protection of Jackson Hole National Monument. After Olaus died, Mardy traveled to Alaska, Tanzania, and New Zealand studying wild areas, assessing areas for wilderness qualities and working to protect nature from exploitation.

==Books and articles==
&quot;Two in the Far North&quot;, a memoir published in 1962, chronicles Murie&#x27;s early life, her marriage, and research expeditions in Alaska. She wrote &quot;Island Between&quot;, published in 1977, and &quot;Wapiti Wilderness&quot;, published in 1966 with her husband. A documentary, &quot;Arctic Dance&quot;, was made about her life.

==Work as a wilderness advocate, advisor and consultant==
Mardy and Olaus spent their honeymoon studying birds and traveling over 500 miles by dogsled, conducting research on the caribou of the Brooks Range. Margaret&#x27;s idea of preserving an entire ecosystem laid the scientific and intellectual groundwork for large parks and preserves.
In 1956, Murie began a campaign with her husband to protect what is now the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The couple recruited U.S. Supreme Court Justice William O. Douglas to help persuade President Dwight Eisenhower to set aside as the Arctic National Wildlife Range, which was expended and renamed in 1980 by President Jimmy Carter.

After her husband&#x27;s death in 1963, Murie began writing and continued the conservation work she and Olaus had begun, writing letters and articles, traveling to hearings and making speeches. She served as a consultant to the Wilderness Society, the National Park Service and the Sierra Club, among many other organizations. Murie returned to Alaska to survey potential wilderness areas for the National Park Service and worked on the Alaska National Interest Lands Conservation Act, testifying before congress in favor of the act, which was signed by President Carter in 1980. That legislation set aside of land in Alaska and doubled the size of the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge. The Murie Residence in Moose, Wyoming, was added to the National Register of Historic Places in 1990, and as part of the Murie Ranch Historic District was designated a National Historic Landmark in 2006. It now houses a conservation institute named for Murie and her husband.

==Awards==
Murie received the Audubon Medal in 1980, the John Muir Award in 1983, and the Robert Marshall Conservation Award in 1986. She was made an honorary park ranger by the National Park Service and received an honorary Doctor of Humane Letters from the University of Alaska.

In 1998 President Clinton awarded her the Presidential Medal of Freedom. Just prior to her 100th birthday in 2002, Murie received the J.N. Ding Darling Conservationist of the Year Award, the National Wildlife Federation&#x27;s highest honor.

Murie died in Moose, Wyoming, on October 19, 2003, at the age of 101.

<text>Rudolph Joseph Rummel (October 21, 1932 – March 2, 2014) was an American political scientist, a statistician and professor at Indiana University, Yale University, and University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa. He spent his career studying data on collective violence and war with a view toward helping their resolution or elimination. Contrasting &quot;genocide&quot;, Rummel coined the term &quot;democide&quot; for murder by government, such as the genocide of indigenous peoples and colonialism, Nazi Germany, the Stalinist purges, Mao Zedong&#x27;s Cultural Revolution, and other authoritarian, totalitarian, or undemocratic regimes, coming to the conclusion that democratic regimes result in the least democides.

Rummel estimated that a total of 212 million people were killed by all governments during the 20th century, of which 148 million were killed by Communist governments from 1917 to 1987. To give some perspective on these numbers, Rummel stated that all domestic and foreign wars during the 20th century killed in combat around 41 million. His figures for Communist governments have been criticized for the methodology which he used to arrive at them, and they have also been criticized for being higher than the figures which have been given by most scholars. In his last book, Rummel increased his estimate to over 272 million innocent, non-combatant civilians who were murdered by their own governments during the 20th century. Rummel stated that his 272 million death estimate was his lower, more prudent figure, stating that it &quot;could be over 400,000,000.&quot; Rummel came to the conclusion that a democracy is the form of government which is least likely to kill its citizens because democracies do not tend to wage wars against each other. This latest view is a concept, which was further developed by Rummel, known as the democratic peace theory. 

Rummel was the author of twenty-four scholarly books, and he published his major results between 1975 and 1981 in &quot;Understanding Conflict and War&quot; (1975). He spent the next fifteen years refining the underlying theory and testing it empirically on new data, against the empirical results of others, and on case studies. He summed up his research in &quot;Power Kills&quot; (1997). His other works include &quot;Lethal Politics: Soviet Genocides and Mass Murders 1917–1987&quot; (1990), &quot;China&#x27;s Bloody Century: Genocide and Mass Murder Since 1900&quot; (1991), &quot;Democide: Nazi Genocide and Mass Murder&quot; (1992), &quot;Death by Government: Genocide and Mass Murder Since 1900&quot; (1994), and &quot;Statistics of Democide&quot; (1997). Extracts, figures, and tables from the books, including his sources and details regarding the calculations, are available online on his website. Rummel also authored &quot;Applied Factor Analysis&quot; (1970) and &quot;Understanding Correlation&quot; (1976).

==Early life, education, and death==
Rummel was born in 1932 in Cleveland, Ohio, to a family of German descent. A child of the Great Depression and World War II, he attended local public schools. Rummel received his Bachelor of Arts and Master of Arts from the University of Hawaiʻi in 1959 and 1961, respectively, and his PhD in political science from Northwestern University in 1963.

Rummel died on March 2, 2014, aged 81. He is survived by two daughters and one sister.

==Academic career and research==
Rummel began his teaching career at Indiana University. In 1964, Rummel moved to Yale University, and in 1966 returned to the University of Hawaiʻi at Mānoa, where he taught for the rest of his active career. In 1995, Rummel retired and became professor emeritus of political science. His research was supported by grants from the National Science Foundation, DARPA, and the United States Peace Research Institute. In addition to his books, Rummel was the author of more than 100 professional articles.

Rummel was a member of the advisory council of the Victims of Communism Memorial Foundation.

===Democide===

Rummel coined &quot;democide&quot;, which he defined as &quot;the murder of any person or people by a government, including genocide, politicide, and mass murder.&quot; Rummel further stated to &quot;use the civil definition of murder, where someone can be guilty of murder if they are responsible in a reckless and wanton way for the loss of life, as in incarcerating people in camps where they may soon die of malnutrition, unattended disease, and forced labor, or deporting them into wastelands where they may die rapidly from exposure and disease.&quot;

In his work and research, Rummel distinguished between colonial, democratic, and authoritarian and totalitarian regimes, and found a correlation with authoritarianism and totalitarianism, which he considered to be a significant causative factor in democides. Rummel posited that there is a relation between political power and democide. Political mass murder grows increasingly common as political power becomes unconstrained. At the other end of the scale, where power is diffuse, checked, and balanced, political violence is a rarity. For Rummel, &quot;[t]he more power a regime has, the more likely people will be killed. This is a major reason for promoting freedom.&quot; He wrote that &quot;concentrated political power is the most dangerous thing on earth.&quot; This correlation is considered by Rummel to be more important than reliability of estimates.

===Democracy and peace===
After Dean Babst, Rummel was one of the early researchers on the democratic peace theory. Rummel found that there were 205 wars between non-democracies, 166 wars between non-democracies and democracies, and no wars between democracies during the period between 1816 and 2005. The definition of democracy used by Rummel is &quot;where those who hold power are elected in competitive elections with a secret ballot and wide franchise (loosely understood as including at least 2/3 of adult males); where there is freedom of speech, religion, and organization; and a constitutional framework of law to which the government is subordinate and that guarantees equal rights.&quot; In addition, it should be &quot;well-established&quot;, stating that &quot;enough time has passed since its inception for peace-sufficient democratic procedures to become accepted and democratic culture to settle in. Around three years seems to be enough for this.&quot;

Regarding war, Rummel adopted the definition of a popular database, namely that war is a conflict causing at least 1,000 battle deaths. The peace is explained thus: &quot;Start with the answer of the philosopher Immanuel Kant to why universalizing republics (democracy was a bad word for Classical Liberals in his time) would create a peaceful world. People would not support and vote for wars in which they and their loved ones could die and lose their property. But this is only partly correct, for the people can get aroused against nondemocracies and push their leaders toward war, as in the Spanish–American War. A deeper explanation is that where people are free, they create an exchange society of overlapping groups and multiple and crosschecking centers of power. In such a society a culture of negotiation, tolerance, and splitting differences develops. Moreover, free people develop an in-group orientation toward other such societies, a feeling of shared norms and ideals that militates against violence toward other free societies.&quot;

===Mortacide===
While democide requires governmental intention, Rummel was also interested in analyzing the effects of regimes that unintentionally, yet culpably, cause the deaths of their citizens through negligence, incompetence or sheer indifference. An example is a regime in which corruption has become so pervasive and destructive of a people&#x27;s welfare that it threatens their daily lives and reduces their life expectancy. Rummel termed deaths of citizens under such regimes as mortacide, and posited that democracies have the fewest of such deaths.

===Famine, economic growth, and happiness===
Rummel included famine in democide, if he deemed it the result of a deliberate policy, as he did for the Holodomor. Rummel stated that there have been no famines in democracies, deliberate or not, an argument first advanced by Amartya Sen, and he also posited that democracy is an important factor for economic growth and for raising living standards. He stated that research shows average happiness in a nation increases with more democracy. According to Rummel, the continuing increase in the number of democracies worldwide would lead to an end to wars and democide. He believed that goal might be achieved by the mid-21st century.

==Political views==
Rummel started out as a democratic socialist but later became an anti-communist, a libertarian, and an advocate of economic liberalism. Apart from being an outspoken critic of communism and Communist states, Rummel criticized right-wing dictatorships and the democides that occurred under colonialism, which also resulted in hundreds of million of deaths. Rummel was a strong supporter of spreading liberal democracy, although he did not support invading another country solely to replace a dictatorship. Rummel posited that there is less foreign violence when states are more libertarian.

Rummel was critical of past American foreign policy such as the Philippine War of 1899-1902, involvement in the 1900 Battle of Peking, and the strategic bombing of civilians during World War II, and he also believed that the United States under the Democratic Party US president Woodrow Wilson was a domestic tyranny. Rummel strongly supported the War on Terror and the Iraq War initiated by the Republican George W. Bush administration, arguing that &quot;the media [was] biased against freeing Iraqi from tyranny.&quot; Rummel also proposed that an intergovernmental organization of all democracies outside of the United Nations deals with issues about which the United Nations cannot or would not act, in particular to further the promotion of peace, human security, human rights, and democracy through what he termed &quot;an Alliance of Democracies [which] can do much better.&quot; Rummel thought that Democratic United States senator Ted Kennedy&#x27;s opposition to the Vietnam War led to the state killings in Cambodia and Vietnam during the 1970s. Following the death of Kennedy, Rummel condemned the media reaction as too benign, and stated that &quot;the post-war blood of millions is on Kennedy&#x27;s hands.&quot;

Rummel was critical of Barack Obama and the Democratic Party, alleging that they were seeking to establish an authoritarian, one-party state. He believed that global warming was &quot;a scam for power&quot; and opposed Obama&#x27;s carbon-trading scheme. Rummel thought that Obama killed off a democratic peace that Democrat Bill Clinton and Republican George W. Bush had been pursuing. Rummel posited that there was a leftist bias in some parts of the academic world that selectively focused on problems in nations with high political and economic freedom and ignored much worse problems in other nations. Related to this, he also criticized the tenure system.

==Reception==
===Democratic peace theory===

The democratic peace theory is one of the great controversies in political science and one of the main challenges to realism in international relations. More than a hundred different researchers have published multiple articles in this field according to an incomplete bibliography until 2000, and from 2000 to August 2009. Some critics respond that there have been exceptions to the theory. While it is generally statistically true that democides happen more in authoritarian than democratic regimes, there have been a few exceptions for democratic regimes, and some authoritarian regimes have not engaged in the megamurder category of democide. Rummel discussed some of these exceptions in his FAQ, and he has referred to books by other scholars such as &quot;Never at War&quot;. Criticism of the democratic peace theory include data, definition, historical periods, limited consequences, methodology, microfoundations, and statistical significance criticism, that peace comes before democracy, and several studies fail to confirm democracies are less likely to wage war than autocracies if wars against non-democracies are included. Jeffrey Pugh summarized that those who dispute the theory often do so on grounds that it conflates correlation with causation, and the academic definitions of &quot;democracy&quot; and &quot;war&quot; can be manipulated so as to manufacture an artificial trend. Rummel&#x27;s first work on democratic peace received little attention. His results were incorporated in a &quot;gigantic philosophical scheme&quot; of 33 propositions in a five-volume work. It was reviewed in 1992 as having &quot;immoderate pretensions&quot;, and demonstrated Rummel&#x27;s &quot;unrelenting&quot; economic liberalism and &quot;extreme&quot; views on defense policy. Nils Petter Gleditsch said that these elements may have distracted readers from Rummel&#x27;s more conventionally acceptable propositions.

Rummel&#x27;s version of the democratic peace theory has some distinctive features disputed by some other researchers who support the existence and explanatory power of the theory. Rummel&#x27;s early research found that democracies are less warlike, even against non-democracies; other researchers hold only that democracies are far less warlike with one another. Rummel held that democracies properly defined never go to war with each other, and added that this is an &quot;absolute or (point) claim.&quot; Other researchers such as Stuart A. Bremer found that it is a chance or stochastic matter; in this sense, Rummel&#x27;s version of the democratic peace theory was deterministic. A review by James Lee Ray cited several other studies finding that the increase in the risk of war in democratizing countries happens only if many or most of the surrounding nations are undemocratic. If wars between young democracies are included in the analysis, several studies and reviews still find enough evidence supporting the stronger claim that all democracies, whether young or established, go into war with one another less frequently, while some do not.

Rummel did not always apply his definition of democracy to governments under discussion, and he did not always clarify when he did not apply it. The opening paragraphs of an appendix from his book &quot;Power Kills&quot; adopt Michael Doyle&#x27;s lists of liberal democracies for 1776–1800 and 1800–1850. Doyle used a much looser definition, namely the secret ballot that was first adopted by Tasmania in 1856, while Belgium had barely 10% adult male suffrage before 1894.

===Factor analysis===

Critical reviews of Rummel&#x27;s estimates have focused on two aspects, namely his choice of data sources and his statistical approach. Historical sources Rummel based his estimates upon can rarely serve as sources of reliable figures. The statistical approach Rummel used to analyze big sets of diverse estimates may lead to dilution of useful data with noisy ones. Rummel and other genocide scholars are focused primarily on establishing patterns and testing various theoretical explanations of genocides and mass killings. In their work, as they are dealing with large data sets that describe mass mortality events globally, they have to rely on selective data provided by country experts, so precise estimates are neither a required nor expected result of their work. Yehuda Bauer, noted scholar of the Holocaust who commented that democide is more appropriate to describe mass atrocities perpetrated by state actors than genocide, wrote in &quot;Rethinking the Holocaust&quot;: &quot;Rummel has been criticized for exaggerating the losses. Even if the criticisms were valid, a figure lower by 10 or 20 or even 30 percent would make absolutely no difference to the general conclusions that Rummel draws.&quot;

Rummel&#x27;s works have been criticized for establishing estimates on hearsay and unverifiable overtly high death estimates from highly biased authors. An example of this is in the &quot;Tito&#x27;s Slaughterhouse&quot; chapter of &quot;Statistics of Democide&quot;, where Rummel quotes estimates for the democide record of Tito&#x27;s Yugoslavia from authors who were sympathetic towards the Independent State of Croatia (NDH) and who attempted to downplay or deny the crimes of Ustaše in the Holocaust in the Independent State of Croatia, an example of those authors being Ivo Omrčanin, a former NDH official in foreign ministry and an espouser of fascist ideals.

==Awards and nominations==
In 1999, Rummel was awarded the Susan Strange Award of the International Studies Association. This award recognizes a person &quot;whose singular intellect, assertiveness, and insight most challenge conventional wisdom and intellectual and organizational complacency in the international studies community.&quot; In 2003, Rummel was given The Lifetime Achievement Award from the Conflict Processes Organized Section of the American Political Science Association for &quot;scholarly contributions that have fundamentally improved the study of conflict processes.&quot;

Rummel used to publicly claim that he was a finalist for the Nobel Peace Prize, based on an Associated Press report reprinted in his local paper about an alleged Nobel short list of 117 names. Although he retracted the claim, it still appeared in one of his books. Rummel was nominated multiple times for the Nobel Peace Prize by Per Ahlmark but no shortlist has been made public.

==&quot;Never Again Series&quot;==
Rummel wrote the Never Again Series of alternative-history novels. According to the series&#x27; website, &quot;Never Again&quot; is &quot;a what-if, alternative history&quot; in which &quot;two lovers are sent back in time to 1906 with modern weapons and 38 billion 1906 dollars&quot; in order to prevent the rise of totalitarianism and the outbreak of world wars.

<doc id="356326" wikidata="Q2519461" url="?curid=356326" title="Bedtime for Democracy">
<text>Bedtime for Democracy is the fourth and final studio album by American punk rock band Dead Kennedys. Released in 1986, songs on this album cover common punk subjects often found in punk rock lyrics of the era such as conformity, Reaganomics, the U.S. military, and critique of the hardcore punk movement. The album&#x27;s title refers to the 1951 comedy film, &quot;Bedtime for Bonzo&quot; starring Ronald Reagan and also reflects the band&#x27;s weary bitterness from the trial they were undergoing at the time over the controversial art included with their previous album. By the time recording of &quot;Bedtime for Democracy&quot; had begun, the Dead Kennedys had already played what would be their last concert with Jello Biafra and announced their breakup immediately after the release of the record, whose opening track is a cover of David Allan Coe&#x27;s &quot;Take This Job and Shove It.&quot;

After the record&#x27;s release, Isocracy split up, with two members forming the group Samiam and another joining Green Day.

<doc id="356334" wikidata="Q2322228" url="?curid=356334" title="D. H. Peligro">
<text>Darren Eric Henley (July 9, 1959 – October 28, 2022), better known by his stage name D. H. Peligro, was an American punk rock musician, most commonly known as the drummer for Dead Kennedys along with a brief stint as the drummer for Red Hot Chili Peppers.

==Career==

===The Dead Kennedys (1981–1986, 2001–2008, 2009–2022)===
Peligro joined Dead Kennedys in February 1981, replacing original drummer, Ted, and made his recorded debut with the group on the EP &quot;In God We Trust, Inc.&quot; which was released in December of that year. He would go on to record the studio albums &quot;Plastic Surgery Disasters&quot;, &quot;Frankenchrist&quot;, and &quot;Bedtime for Democracy&quot;, as well as singles and other tracks that appeared on the collection, &quot;Give Me Convenience or Give Me Death&quot;. Dead Kennedys broke up in December 1986.

In 2001, Dead Kennedys along with Peligro reunited without former frontman and primary songwriter Jello Biafra following a civil fraud complaint against Biafra, accusing him of withholding royalties. Biafra was found liable for fraud, malice, and breach of contract, a verdict upheld on appeal before the California Supreme Court, and was ordered to pay $220,000 in actual and punitive damages.

In early 2008, Peligro took a hiatus from Dead Kennedys, citing the need for time off from touring. The brief hiatus lasted until June 2009 when Peligro rejoined the band.

===Red Hot Chili Peppers (1988)===

In 1988, Peligro joined the Red Hot Chili Peppers replacing drummer Jack Irons. Guitarist Hillel Slovak had recently died of a heroin overdose and was replaced by guitarist DeWayne McKnight. Peligro had been friends with the band for years and had played in a comedy band called Three Little Butt Hairs with singer Anthony Kiedis and bassist Flea. McKnight was fired three shows into their tour in September 1988 and was replaced by John Frusciante. Peligro would last a bit longer than McKnight, helping to write some songs on the band&#x27;s fourth album, &quot;Mother&#x27;s Milk&quot;, which was released the following year, although Peligro did not perform on the album. Due to his ongoing drug and alcohol issues, the band decided to fire Peligro in November 1988. Peligro did not handle his firing well. Flea said that he stayed in bed for days after making the decision to fire Peligro. Years later, Kiedis said firing Peligro was one of the toughest things the band ever had to do, although Kiedis became a major part of Peligro&#x27;s road to sobriety, which began after he was fired. Chad Smith replaced Peligro a few weeks later and has been with the band ever since.

===Other bands===
Peligro also played briefly with The Hellations, Jungle Studs, Nailbomb, The Feederz, Lock-Up, The Two Free Stooges, Off! and SSI. Peligro was the frontman for his band called Peligro which released three albums: &quot;Peligro&quot; (released in 1995 on Biafra&#x27;s Alternative Tentacles record label, but deleted from the catalog in 2001), &quot;Welcome to America&quot; and &quot;Sum of Our Surroundings&quot;, which won Rock Album of the Year from the American Independent Music Awards. Peligro&#x27;s sound is known to be an eclectic combination of punk, reggae, funk and heavy metal. D. H. Peligro has also fronted the bands Reverend Jones and the Cool Aid Choir and Al Sharpton&#x27;s Hair and the Hellions. He appears as an interview subject in the 2003 documentary &quot;Afro-Punk&quot;. In 2020, Peligro recorded the song &quot;Power is Taken&quot; with Moby, which was also included on Moby’s album &quot;All Visible Objects&quot;.

==Death==
On October 28, 2022, Peligro died in his Los Angeles home. Police reported that he died from trauma to the head, caused by an accidental fall. On May 2, 2023 Peligro’s official cause of death was released, revealing that his death was due to an overdose from a mixture of heroin and fentanyl. Peligro also had non-small-cell lung cancer at the time of his death.

<text>Rapti Zone ( ) was one of the fourteen zones, located in the Mid-Western Development Region of Nepal. It was named after the West Rapti River which drains Rolpa, Pyuthan and part of Dang districts. The remainder of Dang and part of Salyan district are drained by the Babai. The remainder of Salyan and all of Rukum districts are drained by the Bheri.

The headquarters of Rapti were Tulsipur and the largest city was Tribhuvannagar (Ghorahi). Other main cities and towns of Rapti zone were Pyuthan Khalanga, Bijuwar, Liwang, Lamahi, Musikot, Rukumkot (Shova), and Chaurjahari.

==Administrative subdivisions==
Rapti was divided into five districts; since 2015 the three eastern districts (and the eastern part of Rukum District) have been redesignated as part of Lumbini Province, while Salyan District and the western part of Rukum District have been redesignated as part of Karnali Province.


== Geography ==
Dang District begins at the border with India. Since the border follows the southern edge of the Dudhwa Range—a subrange of the Siwaliks, here there is no Nepalese Outer Terai extending onto the main Indo-Gangetic Plain. Dang has two Inner Terai Valleys. Deukhuri lies beyond the Dudhwas, then a second low subrange—the Dang Range—separates Deukhuri from Dang Valley. Beyond Dang Valley the district extends to the crest of the higher Mahabharat Range.

The two valleys have abundant level and gently-sloping land with fair to good soil development, and abundant groundwater. Malaria made them nearly uninhabitable except to the Tharu ethnic group that had evolved resistance. In the 1960s DDT came into use to suppress the mosquito vectors and the way was open to settlers from the hills who used debt and lawsuits to displace and even enslave Tharus.

Dang is the most developed and most rapidly developing of the zone&#x27;s five districts. Mahendra Highway, Nepal&#x27;s main east-west route, follows Deukhuri Valley. Dang Valley has two important towns, Tribuvan nagar and Tulsipur, and an all-weather airport.

Pyuthan, Rolpa and Salyan Districts are in the Middle Hills extending north from the crest of the Mahabharat Range. Pyuthan has a rice-growing alluvial plain along Jhimruk Khola, surrounded by villages of rice-growing Bahun and Chhetri farmers served by bazaar towns of Newar merchants. Rolpa district mainly lies along Mardi Khola, the other large Rapti tributary that is more eroded into an inner gorge and less suited to traditional irrigation projects.

Pyuthan and Rolpa extend north to a rugged 3-4,000 meter ridgeline marking the limits of the Rapti Basin. Kham Magar live in Big Area throughout these highlands up to about 2,500 meters. They herd sheep, goats and cattle in high summer pastures as far north as the western Dhaulagiri Himalaya in Rukum district, moving south to the Mahabharat Range in winter. Kham also cultivate subtropical and temperate fruit trees such as mulberry, citrus and Asian pear as cash crops. Until it was outlawed in the 1970s they cultivated hemp and made hashish bought by government agents to be sold in monopoly stores. Termination of these arrangements increased Kham outmigration in search of employment and contributed to discontent with the Shah regime.

Salyan resembles Pyuthan in having a mix of rice-growing lowlands inhabited by caste Hindus, and uplands inhabited by Kham peoples. It is drained by the Babai and Bheri rivers.

Rukum is Rapi Zone&#x27;s northernmost, most mountainous district including the western part of Dhaulagiri Himalaya drained by the Bheri River. At lower elevations it is populated by Hindu Khas people said to be ancestral to most of Nepal&#x27;s Bahuns and Chhetris living further east. Kham Magars live higher up. A notable valley called Rukumkot lies near the district&#x27;s geographical center.

Rapti Zone has a history of radical politics since the mid-20th century and in the 1990s became a center of the Maoist rebellion against the royal government and the fragile democracy that the late King Birendra eventually supported.

==Economic development==
Historically, geographic isolation inhibited economic development in Rapti Zone. Trans-himalayan trade routes lay to the east along the Kaligandaki River and to the west along the Bheri and Karnali. Compared to these, a hypothetical transhimalayan trade route through Rapti would have been impeded by a wide Inner Terai malarial belt, by ridges up to 4,000 meters exiting the Rapti watershed, then by the Dhaulagiri Himalayas and the only comparatively lower Kagmara and Tibetan border ranges before reaching the Tibetan Plateau.

Elsewhere in Nepal the Outer Terai began developing in the mid 1930s because the Rana dynasty sought limited industrial development and because development could easily spread from India across a border with little impediment. However, in Rapti Zone the border turned north to follow the base of the first range of foothills. Areas suited for development were confined to valleys beyond these low but rugged mountains. Furthermore, these valleys remained dangerously malarial until USAID began spraying DDT in 1954.

In Rapti&#x27;s Middle Hills the only economic activity of interest to the government in Kathmandu was cottage hashish production from scattered plantings of Cannabis indica. Government agents carried marijuana and balls of charas to Kathmandu for retail and export to India. This trade ended in 1974 in response to U.S. pressure and inducements. USAID promoted temperate climate fruit and food crops as replacement cash crops, but this program failed due to lack of adequate transportation out of the hills. Otherwise there was limited local trade, no industry and hardly any agriculture beyond subsistence to tax, so the national government found little incentive for involvement in Rapti zone.

By the 1960s land-hungry hill people began to settle in the Dang and Deukhuri valleys and in the 1980s the east-west Mahendra Highway was built across the country, followed by spur roads south to Koilabas and north to Pyuthan, Rolpa, Dang Valley, Swargadwari and Salyan. This enabled ordinary Nepalis to reach the rest of the country in a day or two by inexpensive buses instead of by limited, expensive air service out of Dang airport or roundabout routes through India using trains and buses going east or west as well as several days on foot, so Rapti Zone&#x27;s historic condition of isolation largely ended and then connection increased with the arrival of landline and cellular telephones, radio broadcasts and Internet.

The growing highway network replaced human porterage and greatly reduced transport costs. More goods were on sale locally, at lower prices. It also helped feed a diaspora sending Nepalese youth and fathers off to India, the Middle East, Europe and even the U.S. for employment and education. Another effect was to foster invidious comparison between increasing amenities of bazaar towns along the spur roads versus unchanged austerity in the hinterlands above that were mainly populated by Kham Magar janajatis. This added to historic grievances from government neglect and favoritism toward upper-caste hill Hindus, so Kham living in the highlands became ripe for recruitment by the Maobadi movement and the national government was virtually pushed out of Rolpa and Rukum during the 1996–2006 Nepalese Civil War.

<doc id="356339" wikidata="Q798506" url="?curid=356339" title="Edwin Booth">
<text>Edwin Thomas Booth (November 13, 1833 – June 7, 1893) was an American stage actor and theatrical manager who toured throughout the United States and the major capitals of Europe, performing Shakespearean plays. In 1869, he founded Booth&#x27;s Theatre in New York. He is considered by many to be the greatest American actor of the 19th century. However, his achievements are often overshadowed by his relationship with his younger brother, actor John Wilkes Booth, who assassinated the 16th president of the United States, Abraham Lincoln.

==Early life==
Booth was born in Bel Air, Maryland, into the Anglo-American theatrical Booth family. He was the son of the famous actor Junius Brutus Booth, an Englishman, and his mistress (later wife) Mary Ann Holmes. He was named after Edwin Forrest and Thomas Flynn, two of Junius&#x27; colleagues. He was the younger brother of Junius Brutus Booth Jr. and the elder brother of John Wilkes Booth.

Nora Titone, in her book &quot;My Thoughts Be Bloody&quot;, recounts how the shame and ambition of Junius Brutus Booth&#x27;s three actor sons, Junius Jr. (who never achieved the level of stardom of his younger brothers), Edwin, and John Wilkes, spurred them to strive, as rivals, for achievement and acclaim. Politically Edwin was a Unionist; John supported the Confederacy and later became notorious as the assassin of President Abraham Lincoln.

Junius Brutus Booth was &quot;famously peculiar ... . Several sons succeeded him in his career ... and his idiosyncrasies: Edwin had an abiding fear of ivy vines and peacock feathers.&quot;

==Career==
In early appearances, Booth usually performed alongside his father, making his stage debut as Tressel or Tressil in Colley Cibber&#x27;s version of &quot;Richard III&quot; in Boston on September 10, 1849. His first appearance in New York City was in the character of Wilford in &quot;The Iron Chest&quot;, which he played at the National Theatre in Chatham Street, on September 27, 1850. A year later, on the illness of the father, the son took his place in the character of Richard III.

After his father&#x27;s death in 1852, Booth went on a worldwide tour, visiting Australia and Hawaii, and finally gaining acclaim of his own during an engagement in Sacramento, California, in 1856.

Before his brother assassinated Lincoln, Edwin had appeared with his two brothers, John Wilkes and Junius Brutus Booth Jr., in &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; in 1864. John Wilkes played Marc Antony, Edwin played Brutus, and Junius played Cassius. It was a benefit performance, and the only time that the three brothers appeared together on the same stage. The funds were used to erect a statue of William Shakespeare that still stands in Central Park just south of the Promenade. Immediately afterwards, Edwin Booth began a production of &quot;Hamlet&quot; on the same stage, which came to be known as the &quot;hundred nights &quot;Hamlet&quot;&quot;, setting a record that lasted until John Barrymore broke the record in 1922, playing the title character for 101 performances.

From 1863 to 1867, Booth managed the Winter Garden Theatre in New York City, mostly staging Shakespearean tragedies. In 1863, he bought the Walnut Street Theatre in Philadelphia.

After John Wilkes Booth&#x27;s assassination of President Lincoln in April 1865, the infamy associated with the Booth name forced Edwin Booth to abandon the stage for many months. Edwin, who had been feuding with John Wilkes before the assassination, disowned him afterward, refusing to have John&#x27;s name spoken in his house. He made his return to the stage at the Winter Garden Theatre in January 1866, playing the title role in &quot;Hamlet&quot;, which would eventually become his signature role.

In 1874, he played the titular role in &quot;Othello&quot; in Chicago, trading off with James O&#x27;Neill. Casting O&#x27;Neill, an Irish American actor who was called Black Irish because of his black hair, has been marked as one possible origin of disputes about whether the character Othello was meant to merely to have black hair and swarthy skin, rather than to be of sub-Saharan African origin.

==Later life==
Booth was married to Mary Devlin Booth from 1860 until her death in 1863. They had one daughter, Edwina, born on December 9, 1861, in London. He later remarried, to his acting partner Mary McVicker Booth in 1869. Their only child, a son named Edgar, died shortly after birth. Booth became a widower again in 1881. 

In 1869, Edwin acquired his brother John&#x27;s body after repeatedly writing to President Andrew Johnson pleading for it. Johnson finally released the remains, and Edwin had them buried, unmarked, in the family plot at Green Mount Cemetery in Baltimore.

On April 23, 1879, Mark Gray, a traveling salesman from Keokuk, Iowa, fired two shots from a pistol at Booth. Booth was playing the title role in &quot;Richard II&quot; at McVicker&#x27;s Theatre in Chicago, Illinois, during the final act of the William Shakespeare tragedy. Gray gave as his motive a wrong done to a friend by Booth. Gray&#x27;s shots, which were fired from a distance of thirty-four feet, missed Booth, burying themselves in the stage floor. The would-be assassin was jailed at Central Station in Chicago. Booth was not acquainted with Gray, who worked for a St. Louis, Missouri dry goods firm. A letter to a woman in Ohio was found on Gray&#x27;s person. The correspondence affirmed Gray&#x27;s intent to murder Booth. The attempted assassination occurred on Shakespeare&#x27;s supposed birthday and came at a time when Booth was receiving numerous death threats by mail.

In 1888, Booth founded The Players, a private club for performing, literary, and visual artists and their supporters, purchasing and furnishing a home on Gramercy Park as its clubhouse.

His final performance was, fittingly, in his signature role of Hamlet, in 1891 at the Brooklyn Academy of Music.

===Robert Lincoln rescue===
Edwin Booth saved Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s son, Robert Todd Lincoln, from serious injury or even death. The incident occurred on a train platform in Jersey City, New Jersey. The exact date of the incident is uncertain, but it is believed to have taken place in late 1864 or early 1865. Robert Lincoln recalled the incident in a 1909 letter to Richard Watson Gilder, editor of &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;.

The incident occurred while a group of passengers were late at night purchasing their sleeping car places from the conductor who stood on the station platform at the entrance of the car. The platform was about the height of the car floor, and there was of course a narrow space between the platform and the car body. There was some crowding, and I happened to be pressed by it against the car body while waiting my turn. In this situation the train began to move, and by the motion I was twisted off my feet, and had dropped somewhat, with feet downward, into the open space, and was personally helpless, when my coat collar was vigorously seized and I was quickly pulled up and out to a secure footing on the platform. Upon turning to thank my rescuer I saw it was Edwin Booth, whose face was of course well known to me, and I expressed my gratitude to him, and in doing so, called him by name.

Booth did not know the identity of the man whose life he had saved until some months later, when he received a letter from a friend, Colonel Adam Badeau, who was an officer on the staff of General Ulysses S. Grant. Badeau had heard the story from Robert Lincoln, who had since joined the Union Army and was also serving on Grant&#x27;s staff. In the letter, Badeau gave his compliments to Booth for the heroic deed. The fact that he had saved the life of Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s son was said to have been of some comfort to Edwin Booth following his brother&#x27;s assassination of the president.

===Booth&#x27;s Theatre===

In 1867, a fire damaged the Winter Garden Theatre, resulting in the building&#x27;s subsequent demolition. Afterwards, Booth built his own theatre, an elaborate structure called Booth&#x27;s Theatre in Manhattan, which opened on February 3, 1869, with a production of &quot;Romeo and Juliet&quot; starring Booth as Romeo, and Mary McVicker as Juliet. Elaborate productions followed, but the theatre never became a profitable or even stable financial venture. The panic of 1873 caused the final bankruptcy of Booth&#x27;s Theatre in 1874. After the bankruptcy, Booth went on another worldwide tour, eventually regaining his fortune.

===Boothden===

In 1879 Booth purchased land in Middletown, Rhode Island on the Sakonnet River; he hired Calvert Vaux, whose son Downing Vaux was (briefly) engaged to Booth&#x27;s daughter Edwina, to design a grand summer cottage estate there. &quot;Boothden&quot; was completed in 1884, a wooden house set on a stone foundation, designed in the Queen Anne Revival style with Stick style motifs and large plate glass windows. Boothden featured a dance hall, stables, boathouse, and a windmill folly with a henhouse at its base. Booth enjoyed ten years at Boothden, willing it to Edwina on his death in 1893. After Edwina sold Boothden in 1903, the house passed through a series of owners, and saw a full restoration in 2017.

==Death==

Booth had a small stroke in 1891, which precipitated his decline. He suffered another stroke in April 1893 and died June 7, 1893, in his apartment in The Players clubhouse. He was buried next to his first wife at Mount Auburn Cemetery in Cambridge, Massachusetts. His bedroom in the club has been kept untouched since his death.

===Exhumation request===
In December 2010, Booth&#x27;s descendants&#x27; reported that they obtained permission to exhume the Shakespearean actor&#x27;s body to obtain DNA samples to compare with a sample of his brother John&#x27;s DNA to refute the rumor he had escaped after the assassination. However, a spokesperson from the Mount Auburn Cemetery, where Booth is buried, denied reports that the family had contacted them and requested to exhume Edwin&#x27;s body. The family hopes to obtain DNA samples from artifacts belonging to John Wilkes, or from remains such as vertebrae stored at the National Museum of Health and Medicine in Maryland. On March 30, 2013, museum spokesperson Carol Johnson announced that the family&#x27;s request to extract DNA from the vertebrae had been rejected.

==Dramatizations==

A number of modern dramatizations have been made of Edwin Booth&#x27;s life, on both stage and screen.

One of the best known is the 1955 film &quot;Prince of Players&quot; written by Moss Hart, based loosely on the popular book of that name by Eleanor Ruggles. It was directed by Philip Dunne and stars Richard Burton and Raymond Massey as Edwin and Junius Brutus Booth Sr., with Charles Bickford as Prescott, producer of their Shakespeare tour. The cast also includes Eva Le Gallienne, who plays Gertrude to Burton&#x27;s Hamlet, and who is listed on the opening credits as &quot;Special Consultant on Shakespearean Scenes&quot;. The film depicts events in Booth&#x27;s life well before, and then surrounding, the assassination of Lincoln by Booth&#x27;s younger brother.

The opening scenes of &quot;Prince of Players&quot; are very similar to scenes in the earlier 1946 John Ford western &quot;My Darling Clementine&quot;. In that movie, the character of Granville Thorndyke (as acted by Alan Mowbray) is an obvious nod to Booth&#x27;s father Junius, and the scenes portray essentially the same sequence where the great actor has to be retrieved from a bar and dragged back to the theatre where he is overdue to give a performance in front of a restless audience.

In 1958, José Ferrer produced, directed, and played the title role in a play &quot;Edwin Booth&quot;. It ran for three weeks.

In 1959, the actor Robert McQueeney played Booth in the episode &quot;The Man Who Loved Lincoln&quot; on the ABC/Warner Brothers western television series, &quot;Colt .45&quot;, starring Wayde Preston as the fictitious undercover agent Christopher Colt, who in the story line is assigned to protect Booth from a death threat.

In 1960, the anthology series television series &quot;Death Valley Days&quot; broadcast &quot;His Brother&#x27;s Keeper&quot;, in which Booth visits a small town after the Lincoln assassination, with one of the town&#x27;s influential citizens trying to have him run out of town.

In 1966, Martin Landau played Edwin Booth in the episode &quot;This Stage of Fools&quot; of the NBC western television series, &quot;Branded&quot;, starring Chuck Connors as Jason McCord. In the story line, McCord takes a job as the bodyguard to the actor Edwin Booth, brother of the presidential assassin, John Wilkes Booth.

&quot;The Brothers BOOTH!&quot;, by W. Stuart McDowell, which focuses on the relationships of the three Booth brothers leading up to the assassination of Lincoln, was workshopped and given a series of staged readings featuring David Strathairn, David Dukes, Angela Goethals, Maryann Plunkett, and Stephen Lang at the New Harmony Project, and at The Guthrie Theatre Lab in Minneapolis, and later presented in New York at the Players&#x27; Club, the Second Stage Theatre, and the Boston Athenaeum. It was given its first fully staged professional production at the Bristol Riverside Theatre outside Philadelphia in 1992. A second play by the same name, &quot;The Brothers Booth&quot;, which focuses on &quot;the world of the 1860s theatre and its leading family&quot; was written by Marshell Bradley and staged in New York at the Perry Street Theatre in 2004.

Austin Pendleton&#x27;s play, &quot;Booth&quot;, which depicts the early years of the brothers Edwin, Junius, and John Wilkes Booth and their father, was produced off Broadway at the York Theatre, starring Frank Langella as Junius Brutus Booth Sr. In a review, the play was called &quot;a psychodrama about the legendary theatrical family of the 19th century&quot; by &quot;The New York Times&quot;. Pendleton had adapted this version from his earlier work, &quot;Booth Is Back&quot;, produced at Long Wharf Theatre in New Haven, Connecticut, in the 1991–1992 season.

&quot;The Tragedian&quot;, by playwright and actor Rodney Lee Rogers, is a one-man show about Booth that was produced by PURE Theatre of Charleston, South Carolina, in 2007. It was revived for inclusion in the Piccolo Spoleto Arts Festival in May and June 2008.

A play by Luigi Creatore called &quot;Error of the Moon&quot; played off-Broadway on Theatre Row in New York City from August 13 to October 10, 2010. The play is a fictionalized account of Booth&#x27;s life, hinging on the personal, professional, and political tensions between brothers Edwin and John Wilkes, leading up to the assassination of Lincoln.

In 2013, Will Forte played Edwin Booth in the &quot;Washington, D.C.&quot; episode of the Comedy Central series, &quot;Drunk History&quot;, created by Derek Waters.

In 2014, Edwin Booth was played by Gordon Tanner in &quot;The Pinkertons&quot; episode, &quot;The Play&#x27;s the Thing&quot; (S1:E3). In the episode, both the &quot;Hundred nights Hamlet&quot; and Edwin&#x27;s rescue of Robert Lincoln are mentioned.

In 2023, &quot;Tyrants&quot;, an original musical about the life of Edwin Booth, was presented at the National Archives Museum in Washington, D.C. With music and lyrics by Alexander Sage Oyen and a book by Nora Brigid Monahan, the musical starred A.J. Shively as Edwin Booth, under the direction of John Simpkins.

Booth was portrayed by Nick Westrate in the 2024 Apple TV+ miniseries series &quot;Manhunt&quot;.

==Legacy==
Booth left a considerable estate upon his death. He left charitable bequests that furthered the development of the acting profession and the treatment of mental illness. He left bequests of $5,000 each (almost $150,000 in 2021 dollars) to the Actor&#x27;s&#x27; Fund, the Actors&#x27; Association of Friendship of the City of New York (Edwin Forrest Lodge), The Actors&#x27; Association of Friendship of the City of Philadelphia (Shakespeare Lodge), the Asylum Fund of New York and the Home for Incurables (West Farms, New York). Other examples of his legacy include:

*The Players still exists in its original clubhouse at 16 Gramercy Park South in Manhattan. A statue of Booth, by Edmond Thomas Quinn, has been the centerpiece of the private Gramercy Park since 1916. It can be seen by the public through the south gate of the park. 
*Booth left a few recordings of his voice preserved on wax cylinder. One of them can be heard on the Naxos Records set &quot;Great Historical Shakespeare Recordings and Other Miscellany&quot;. Another place to hear his preserved voice is on the site . Booth&#x27;s voice is barely audible with all the surface noise, but what can be deciphered reveals it to have been rich and deep.
*Memorials of Booth can still be found around Bel Air, Maryland. In front of the courthouse is a fountain dedicated to his memory. Inside the post office is a portrait of him. Also, his family&#x27;s home, Tudor Hall, still stands and was bought in 2006 by Harford County, Maryland, to become a museum. 
*A chamber in Mammoth Cave in Kentucky is called &quot;Booth&#x27;s Amphitheatre&quot; – so called because Booth visited the cave and allegedly entertained visitors there. 
*The Booth Theatre was the first, and remains the oldest, Broadway theatre to be named in honor of an actor.
*Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s musical &quot;Assassins&quot; mentions Booth in &quot;The Ballad of Booth&quot; with the lyrics: &quot;Your brother made you jealous, John/You couldn&#x27;t fill his shoes&quot;. 
*Booth is a member of the American Theater Hall of Fame and the Hall of Fame for Great Americans.
*The Edwin Booth Family Collection archives are held in the University Library at California State University, Northridge.
In 1894, Booth&#x27;s daughter, Edwina Booth Grossman, published a book about her father, reportedly concerned that his legacy as an actor would be marred by his brother&#x27;s assassination of Abraham Lincoln in 1865. The volume was titled &quot;Edwin Booth: Recollections by His Daughter, Edwina Booth Grossman, and Letters to Her and to His Friends&quot;. As the title suggests, the book describes Grossman&#x27;s memories of her father and contains edited transcripts of letters written by him.

<text>Raymond John &quot;[[East Bay (San Francisco Bay Area)|East Bay]] Ray&quot; Pepperell (born November 17, 1958) is an American musician who plays guitar for the San Francisco Bay area-based punk band Dead Kennedys. His guitar work was influenced by jazz and rockabilly. Alongside Jello Biafra&#x27;s astute lyrics and unique vibrato-based vocal style, East Bay Ray&#x27;s playing was one of the defining factors of the music of the Dead Kennedys, and by extension, of the &quot;second wave&quot; of American punk. He is also the only Dead Kennedy to remain a constant member of the band since its formation.

==Early life and education==
Raymond John Pepperell was born and raised in the San Francisco Bay area and was musically influenced by both his parents, who organized local art and music festivals in their suburban neighborhood. His father had a collection of 1930s and 1940s jazz and blues records, and would take him and his brother to performances by Muddy Waters, the Count Basie Orchestra and Lightnin&#x27; Hopkins. His mother was a fan of the Weavers and Pete Seeger. His parents, who were also active in the Civil Rights Movement of the 1960s, also influenced him politically. Ray graduated from the University of California, Berkeley and planned to become an architect, but found architecture too artistically limiting. By this time, he had already began writing and playing music as he realized that he could not live without it.

==Career==
Before the Dead Kennedys, East Bay Ray played guitar with a San Francisco Bay Area based rockabilly/doo-wop bar band Cruis&#x27;n, releasing one single, &quot;Vicky&#x27;s Hickey&quot;, sold primarily at their shows.

The Dead Kennedys were an idiosyncratic punk rock band. Although they kept their music for the most part loud, fast, and aggressive, they threw in eclectic flourishes. These experiments included the guitar playing of East Bay Ray, who took cues from sources such as film music (spy movie scores and Ennio Morricone Spaghetti Western scores), instrumental surf rock (the guitar stylings of Dick Dale and George Tomsco of The Fireballs), as well as the psychedelic music of the 60s (especially early Pink Floyd) with his trademark echo effects. With help from Jello Biafra and Klaus Flouride, East Bay Ray crafted a distinct and driving guitar style and sound.

In interviews East Bay Ray has cited the playing of Syd Barrett on Pink Floyd&#x27;s first album &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, as well as the music of the Ohio Players, and the guitar playing of Elvis Presley side-man Scotty Moore (with his trademark echo), as influences. East Bay Ray&#x27;s fondness for Spaghetti Western music is evidenced by a 7&quot; single he recorded in 1984 called &quot;Trouble in Town&quot;/&quot;Poison Heart.&quot;

After Dead Kennedys stopped touring in February 1986, East Bay Ray formed the band Kage with female vocalist Bana Witt. He played guitar on a range of projects including an Algerian Raï music album for Cheikha Rimitti called &quot;Sidi Mansour&quot;, which also featured Red Hot Chili Peppers bassist Flea (coincidentally, D.H. Peligro later became a drummer for RHCP for a short time) and Robert Fripp, to garage-pop with Pearl Harbor, retro-jungle-surf with Johnny Feelings, and exotica lounge music with Frenchy. He composed and recorded a sound track for an early independent film by David Siegel and Scott McGhee, who later made the film noir movie &quot;The Deep End&quot;. In the early 1990s, Ray formed the funk/rock band Skrapyard and released &quot;Sex is Sex&quot; on Alternative Tentacles featuring Ron West, Robert Ball, Andy Kaps and Jason Collins. In 2000, Ray appeared on Hed PE&#x27;s second studio album, &quot;Broke&quot;, performing guitar on the song &quot;Waiting to Die&quot;, and other nu-metal bands have cited him and the Dead Kennedys as an influence.

East Bay Ray was involved in all the Dead Kennedys&#x27; studio recordings and is credited for mixing and producing the band&#x27;s first single, &quot;California Uber Alles&quot;/&quot;Man with the Dogs&quot;, the band&#x27;s first LP &quot;Fresh Fruit for Rotting Vegetables&quot; with Oliver Dicicco, the EP &quot;In God We Trust, Inc.&quot; and he mixed &quot;Holiday in Cambodia&quot;/&quot;Police Truck&quot;. Ray was one of the founders of the original Alternative Tentacles Records, set up for other artists and Dead Kennedys, and was a partner in it until the mid-1980s. Ray mixed and produced two CDs of live Dead Kennedys recordings, &quot;Mutiny on the Bay&quot; and &quot;Live at the Deaf Club&quot;.

Starting in 2001, East Bay Ray headed the legal struggle to win ownership of Dead Kennedys&#x27; intellectual property and to secure royalties withheld from the band by Jello Biafra. Biafra was found civilly liable for fraud, malice and breach of contract. Ray authorized and had a production credit for a CD of live Dead Kennedys recordings titled &quot;Mutiny on the Bay&quot;. East Bay Ray was responsible, along with his ex-bandmates Klaus Flouride and D.H. Peligro, for licensing songs such as &quot;Police Truck&quot; and &quot;Holiday in Cambodia&quot; to major corporations for use in video games and films. Dead Kennedys, including Biafra, had previously approved the use of the band&#x27;s songs in the major film corporation releases &quot;Neighbors&quot; (1981), and &quot;Class&quot; (1983). In 1999, Biafra himself approved the license to Tony Hawk&#x27;s video game.

Ray was a featured artist in the April 2006 edition of &quot;Guitar Player&quot; magazine talking about recording production techniques and in the January 2006 issue of &quot;Guitar World&quot;.

Ray guests on the track &quot;Guitar Hero&quot; on The Dresden Dolls lead singer/pianist Amanda Palmer&#x27;s solo debut, &quot;Who Killed Amanda Palmer&quot;.

Ray also released the 7&quot; single &quot;Trouble in Town&quot; in 1984 (Alternative Tentacles Records), featuring the songs &quot;Poisoned Heart&quot; and &quot;Trouble in Town&quot;, with guest vocalists Vince and Steve One.

<text>was a province of Japan until 1871; since then, it has been a part of Niigata Prefecture. It was sometimes called or . It lies on the eponymous Sado Island, off the coast of Niigata Prefecture (or in the past, Echigo Province).
Sado was famous for the silver and gold mined on the island. In the Kamakura Period, the province was granted to the Honma clan from Honshū, and they continued to dominate Sado until 1589, when Uesugi Kagekatsu of Echigo Province took over the island. The Tokugawa shōguns later made Sado a personal fief after Sekigahara, and assumed direct control of its mines.

Since 2004 Sado city has comprised the entire island.

<doc id="356343" wikidata="Q1053732" url="?curid=356343" title="Sagami Province">
<text>was a province of Japan located in what is today the central and western Kanagawa Prefecture. Sagami Province bordered the provinces of Izu, Musashi, and Suruga. It had access to the Pacific Ocean through Sagami Bay. However, most of the present-day cities of Yokohama and Kawasaki, now part of Kanagawa Prefecture, were not in Sagami, but rather, in Musashi Province. Its abbreviated form name was . 
==History==
Sagami was one of the original provinces of Japan established in the Nara period under the Taihō Code. The area has been inhabited since prehistoric times. Although remnants from the Japanese Paleolithic and Yayoi periods are scarce, remains from the Jōmon period are relatively plentiful. Kofun period remains are generally from the 1st to the 4th century AD. Whether or not Sagami was originally part of Musashi prior to the Nara period is still a topic of controversy.

The original capital of the province may have been located in what is now Hiratsuka, although other contenders include Ōiso and Ebina. Of all the former provinces of Japan, Sagami is the only in which the ruins of the Nara period capital have yet to be found. The &quot;Kokubun-ji&quot; is located in what is now Ebina. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Sagami was ranked as a &quot;major country&quot; (上国, &quot;jōkoku&quot;) in terms of importance and a &quot;faraway country&quot; (遠国, &quot;ongoku&quot;), in terms of distance from the capital. It was also included as one of the Tōkaidō provinces and was governed by a &quot;Kuni no miyatsuko&quot;.

Samukawa jinja was designated as the chief Shinto shrine (&quot;ichinomiya&quot;) for the province.

Records of Sagami during the Heian period are sparse, but during this period large &quot;shōen&quot; controlled by various warrior-class clans developed. The Miura clan was one of the most powerful of these clans. During the Kamakura period, Sagami was the center of the Kamakura shogunate, based in Kamakura, founded by Minamoto no Yoritomo and subsequently controlled by his former stewards, the Hōjō clan.

The province came under the control of the Uesugi clan for much of the Sengoku period, and was a highly contested territory, before the consolidation under the rule of the Later Hōjō clan based at Odawara. After the defeat of the Later Hōjō clan at the hands of Toyotomi Hideyoshi in 1590, Sagami was part of the territory in the Kantō region which came under the rule of Tokugawa Ieyasu. With the establishment of the Tokugawa shogunate, the western portion of the province formed Odawara Domain, and the remainder of the province was &quot;tenryō&quot; territory under direct administrative control of the Tokugawa shogunate, ruled though a number of &quot;hatamoto&quot; administrators. A number of feudal domains from outside Sagami Province also had small scattered holdings within the province.

During the Edo period, Sagami prospered due to its location on the Tōkaidō road connecting Edo with Kyoto, and numerous post towns developed. Uraga, at the entrance to Edo Bay was a major maritime security checkpoint for ships entering or leaving the Shogunate capital. However, the 1703 Genroku earthquake caused severe damage to Odawara, destroying much of Odawara-juku. This was followed by further natural disasters, including the October 4, 1707 Hōei earthquake and the Hōei eruption of Mount Fuji in December of the same year.

During the Bakumatsu period, Kurihama in southern Miura Peninsula was the location of the first landing of American Commodore Matthew C. Perry and his fleet of black ships in 1853, which led eventually to the Treaty of Kanagawa, which opened Sagami to foreign visitation and led to the rapid development of Yokohama as a treaty port.

After the Meiji Restoration, Sagami Province was reorganized in 1871 into Odarawa, Ongino-Yamanaka, Karasuyama, Mito, Sakura, Oyumi, Mutsuura and Nishi-Ohira Prefectures. All for former Sagami Province became part of the new Kanagawa Prefecture in 1876.

<doc id="356347" wikidata="Q2880879" url="?curid=356347" title="Saitō Tatsuoki">
<text>was a daimyō in Mino Province during the Sengoku period and the third generation lord of the Saitō clan. He was a son of Saitō Yoshitatsu. His mother was daughter of Azai Hisamasa and nephew of Azai Nagamasa, a grandson of Saitō Dōsan. He was also a nephew of Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s first wife, Nohime herself, a daughter of Saitō Dōsan.

==Biography==
Saitō Tatsuoki succeeded his father at the age of 13 in 1561. He was, however, an incapable ruler; unlike his father and grandfather. 

Tatsuoki became involved in a bitter rivalry with Oda Nobunaga, and lost to him decisively in 1567. He survived, but from this point on the Saitō clan were no longer a significant faction in the power struggles of the Sengoku period. 

After Oda Nobunaga conquered the Saito in 1567, he was exiled, though there are at least two accounts of how he managed this. In one account, Tatsuoki abandoned the castle the night before the final attack, took a boat, and fled down the Sunomata River. 

In another account, following the breach of the main gate, Hideyoshi dispatched a messenger to the main tower, where Tatsuoki and his entourage were cornered, with assurances of leniency if the Saitō holdouts would surrender. Tatsuoki accepted the offer and, with Nobunaga&#x27;s troops forming two lines, Tatsuoki marched out of the main tower with his family and retinue. 

In any event, Tatsuoki eventually found his way to Nagashima, Ise Province. He lived in exile for a while, but eventually sought refuge with Asakura Yoshikage. He was killed in the Battle of Tonezaka, at the age of 25, in 1573.

<doc id="356349" wikidata="Q986345" url="?curid=356349" title="Sakuma Morimasa">
<text>was the son of Sakuma Moritsugu, cousin of Sakuma Nobumori, a prominent Oda retainer to Oda Nobuhide and Oda Nobunaga. After several campaigns in which he had fought, he was given the nickname &quot;oni-genba&quot; which literally means &quot;Demon Genba&quot;, Genba being his middle name.

==Biography==
Morimasa was born in what is now Shōwa-ku, Nagoya (situated in contemporary Aichi District, Owari Province), He was a retainer of Shibata Katsuie and one of his top generals in many of his campaigns. 

Morimasa&#x27;s first battle was the Battle of Kannonji Castle in 1568 against Rokkaku Yoshikata. 
Morimasa continued joining various battles, including the Siege of Tezutsuyama Castle in Echizen Province against Asakura clan in 1570, the Battle of Yasugawara against Rokkaku Yoshikata and the Battle of Makishima Castle against Ashikaga Yoshiaki in 1573, and performed distinguished war service.

Morimasa was given the former Ikko Sect fortress Oyama Gobo in the Kaga prefecture by Oda Nobunaga; the fortress was subsequently named Oyama Castle in 1580 but went on to become Kanazawa Castle.

In 1581, he beats Uesugi Kagekatsu from Shirayama Castle at Kaga Province. Later, Morimasa headed for a rescue in response to a demand by Maeda Toshiie and beat the Uesugi army stationed at the back of the Arayama Castle at Noto Province.

In 1582, after the betrayal of Akechi Mitsuhide which led to the death of both Oda Nobunaga and his heir Oda Nobutada, Morimasa sided with Shibata Katsuie over making Oda Nobutaka (the third son of Nobunaga) as heir to the Oda clan whereas Hashiba Hideyoshi (later Toyotomi Hideyoshi) supported Lord Sanboshi. Sanboshi was the heir to Oda Nobutada and was still an infant at that time. This argument led to the split of the Oda clan retainers into the two main factions led by Shibata Katsuie and Hashiba Hideyoshi. 
Armies of the two factions eventually came to war.

==Battle of Shizugatake==

In 1583, Morimasa led an offensive force against Takayama Ukon in Iwasakiyama. 
Morimasa then proceeded against Shibata Katsuie&#x27;s orders, killing Nakagawa Kiyohide in the early stages of the battle of Shizugatake. However, he ignored Shibata Katsuie&#x27;s orders to fall back and this led to his defeat as Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s forces approached the next morning. Morimasa was captured and beheaded.

The charge by Morimasa was the spark necessary for the battle of Shizugatake where Hideyoshi&#x27;s troops were able to suppress any resistance led by Maeda Toshiie and prevented the support of Sassa Narimasa and Takigawa Kazumasu. 

In all, Hideyoshi&#x27;s troops swelled to 120,000 whereas Shibata Katsuie&#x27;s troops had only reached 25,000. This eventually forced Shibata Katsuie to commit &quot;seppuku&quot; along with his wife Lady Oichi (younger sister of Nobunaga) following the betrayal of Maeda Toshiie.

<text>(sometimes called Sakuma Zōzan; March22, 1811August12, 1864) was a Japanese politician and scholar of the Edo period.

==Biography==
Born Sakuma Kunitada, he was the son of a samurai and scholar and his wife , and a native of (or Shinano Province) in present day&#x27;s Nagano Prefecture. At the age of 23, he went to Edo and for 10 years studied Chinese learning ().

He then started to study Western sciences (&quot;&quot;rangaku&quot;) at the age of 33, with the help of the &quot;rangaku&quot; scholar (). In 1844, he obtained the &quot;Huishoudelyk Woordboek&quot;, a Dutch translation of Nöel Chomel&#x27;s encyclopedia, from which Sakuma learned how to make glass, and then magnets, thermometers, cameras and telescopes. The encyclopedia was later translated into Japanese by () under the title &quot;Kōsei shinpen&quot; (厚生新編).

In 1849, he learned about electricity, through the book of the Dutch scientist Van den Bergh, and created Japan&#x27;s first telegraph, five years before the introduction of such a telegraph by Commodore Perry in 1854. He also invented electric machines derived from the Elekiter.

From 1842, following an analysis of the defeat of China against Great Britain in the First Opium War and the spread of Western influence in Asia, Sakuma actively proposed the introduction of Western military methods to the Bakufu and the establishment of maritime defense, through his book &quot;Eight policies for the defense of the sea&quot; (&quot;, Kaibō hassaku&quot; ). After the Bakufu ordered Japanese translations of the &quot;Military History of the Qing dynasty&quot; (, &quot;Shèngwu Ji&quot;) and the &quot;Illustrated Treatise on the Maritime Kingdoms&quot; written by Chinese scholar Wei Yuan (17941857), Sakuma was struck by the similarities in their ideas in defending against the west. His writing brought some fame, and he became the teacher of several future leaders of modernization (Yoshida Shōin, Katsu Kaishū, Sakamoto Ryōma, Nakaoka Shintarō, Hashimoto Sanai, Katō Hiroyuki, Nishimura Shigeki, Yamamoto Kakuma).

In 1853, when Yoshida Shōin was convicted for attempting to stow away on one of Perry&#x27;s ships, Sakuma was also sentenced by association to house arrest (), which he endured for 9 years. During the arrest, he continued to study Western sciences, and developed various electric machines based on the Elekiter and the Daniell battery, Japan&#x27;s first seismometer, as well as improvements to guns. After his release, Sakuma Shozan emphasized that the only solution to the country&#x27;s conflicts was to move the Imperial court from Kyoto to Hikone Castle, and continued to advocate opening Japanese ports to foreign traders, as well as reinforcing the Bakufu through collaboration with the Imperial administration (Kōbu gattai).

==Assassination==
In July 1864, Shōzan and a few of his retainers were on their way to Kyoto on horseback. Shōzan&#x27;s horse was mounted with a European saddle, and he possessed a copy of the imperial decree about the opening of the country&#x27;s ports to foreign trade. He was on a mission to meet with a member of the imperial family to explain his ideas and to seek the permission of Emperor Kōmei to legally open Japanese ports to foreign trade. He was unable to meet with the member of the imperial family and decided to return from his failed visit.

On August 12, 1864, as he reached the Sanjō-Kiyamachi district of Kyoto, his retainers, a considerable distance behind and making no effort to catch up with him, failed to notice that two mysterious men were following him on foot. Soon Shōzan was ambushed and attacked by a small group of assassins from the Higo and Oki clans in broad daylight. Shōzan fell from his horse and bled profusely from the attack, with the assassins approaching him with swords drawn. Shōzan was killed by one of the assassins, a &quot;hitokiri&quot; named Kawakami Gensai, who landed a death blow on him. Upon his death, the assassins immediately fled from the scene before his retainers arrived. Shōzan was later found to have thirteen wounds inflicted on him by the assassins.
Shortly after the incident, at Tenryu-ji, Kyoto, Kawakami Gensai told his confederates, &quot;It was the first time I actually felt I&#x27;d killed someone; the hair on my head stood on end because he was the greatest man of all time.&quot;

On the day following Shōzan&#x27;s death, a sign was put up at the main gate of Gion Shrine explaining the reason for the killing:

==Family==
Shōzan kept at least two mistresses. One whose name was Ochō bore his only son on 6 December 1848. Later at the age of 42 he married Katsu Kaishū&#x27;s 16-year-old younger sister Katsu Junko in 1853.

His son , real name Sakuma Kakujirō, was a member of the Shinsengumi, which he joined in September 1864 to avenge his father&#x27;s death.

==Legacy==

Sakuma Shōzan coined the phrase &quot;Eastern ethics, Western technical learning&quot; (&#x27;, ) which was later further abbreviated as &quot;Japanese spirit, Western technique&quot; (&#x27;, ). This latter slogan is still in use as a description of the way that Japan ought to handle modernization.

The Shōzan Shrine was established in 1938 at Matsushiromachi Matsushiro, Nagano, with the two-story which was later built nearby.

A memorial bearing his likeness was erected near his assassination site, along Kiyamachi Road along the banks of the Takase River in Kyoto.

A bronze statue of Sakuma Shōzan named was erected at Kawanakajima, Nagano and unveiled on June 2, 1959 to commemorate the 100th anniversary of the opening of the Port of Yokohama.

Another statue of Sakuma Shōzan mounted on the horse, also named was erected at the Shōzan Shrine to commemorate the 200th anniversary of his birth.

===The University of Nagano===
The , a public university located in Nagano, Nagano, which opened in 2018, named its dormitory, Zozan Dormitory (&quot;&quot;, ) at its Gochō Campus () after Sakuma Shōzan.

In addition, &quot;Sakuma&quot; is the name of the student-made, student resource guide at the University of Nagano; and &quot;Zōzangaku&quot; is a required course for first-year students in the Global Management Department at the university in which students hear from entrepreneurs, government officials, and others, about special innovations and initiatives.

<doc id="356352" wikidata="Q1144171" url="?curid=356352" title="Sanada Masayuki">
<text>was a Japanese Sengoku period lord and &quot;daimyō&quot;. He was the head of Sanada clan, a regional house of Shinano Province, which became a vassal of the Takeda clan of Kai Province. 
Along with his father and brothers, Masayuki served the Takeda clan during its heyday, when it was led by Takeda Shingen. After its downfall, Masayuki took the lead of his clan and, despite little power, he managed to establish himself as an independent &quot;daimyō&quot; under the Toyotomi regime through skillful political maneuvers amidst the powerful Tokugawa, Hōjō and Uesugi clans.

Known for having defeated the powerful Tokugawa army in the Battle of Kami river and Siege of Ueda, Masayuki is now considered one of the greatest military strategists of his era. In recent times, a number of portrayals in novels, films and other forms of media have contributed to his increased popularity.

== Biography ==
He was born the third son of Sanada Yukitaka in 1547, but the exact date is unknown. His childhood name was Gengorō (源五郎). At birth, he had no right to succeed his father because of his two older brothers, Nobutsuna and Masateru.

In 1553, at seven years old, he was sent to the Takeda clan&#x27;s headquarters in Kai as a hostage. There he becomes part of the &quot;Okukinjūshū&quot; (奥近習衆), a group of six young servants close to Takeda Shingen. According to the &quot;Kōyō Gunkan&quot;, Shingen favoured him as he soon recognized that Masayuki&#x27;s talents and insight rivaled those of his father Yukitaka. As such, he is sometimes included among the Twenty Four Generals, alongside his father and two older brothers.

In 1558, he became the foster son of the Mutō family, a branch of the Ōi clan, of which Shingen&#x27;s mother descended from, and adopted the name Mutō Kihei (武藤喜兵衛).

=== Service under Takeda ===
Towards 1564, he married Yamanote-dono (山手殿), a daughter of Uda Yoritada, who was a local lord of Tōtōmi Province. Later she gave birth to his two sons Nobuyuki and Nobushige. During this period, he participated in many battles under the Takeda clan, including the Fourth Battle of Kawanakajima (1561) and the Battle of Mimasetōge (1569). Also most importantly, from 1572 onwards, he joined Shingen in his campaign towards Kyoto against the Oda and Tokugawa clans and took part in the Battle of Mikatagahara (1573).

In May 1573, Shingen died amidst his campaign and so Masayuki continued to serve his heir Takeda Katsuyori.

In 1574, his father Yukitaka died. At that point, his eldest brother Sanada Nobutsuna had already succeeded his father as the head of the Sanada clan. However, during the disastrous Battle of Nagashino (1575) against the Oda clan, both his older brothers, Nobutsuna and Masateru, were killed, so he came back to Sanada clan and claimed his inheritance. In this, Masayuki supposedly had the support of Kōsaka Masanobu, who held Kaizu Castle in Northern Shinano and was also a chief retainer of the Takeda clan. Katsuyori accepted his claim without any qualms.

In 1579, a year after Uesugi Kenshin&#x27;s death, an alliance between the Takeda and Uesugi clans was established. The following year, ordered by Takeda Katsuyori, Masayuki invaded western Kōzuke, which was a Hōjō domain at the time, and seized Numata Castle, putting it under control of the Takeda clan. The same year, he was appointed the title of &quot;Awa-no-kami&quot; (従五位下・安房守).

In 1581, he was ordered by Katsuyori to supervise the construction of the new Shinpu Castle at Nirasaki. In the same year, Numata Kageyoshi, former lord of Numata Castle, attempted to retake his old fief, but Masayuki schemed to assassinate him and thwarted his plans.

In April 1582, Oda and Tokugawa allied forces started an invasion of the Takeda territory. It is said that Masayuki had intended to shelter Katsuyori and advised him to abandon Kai Province and flee towards Sanada&#x27;s domain in Kōzuke(Iwabitsu Castle). Instead, Katsuyori decided to take shelter at Oyamada Nobushige&#x27;s Iwadono Castle, but was betrayed and ultimately died at Tenmokuzan.

After the fall of the Takeda clan, Masayuki yielded to Oda Nobunaga and was put under the orders of one of Nobunaga&#x27;s chief commanders, Takigawa Kazumasu. Masayuki managed to retain most of his domain, but had to abdicate Numata Castle to Takigawa Masushigue, Kazumasu&#x27;s relative.

=== Tenshō-Jingo Conflict ===
However, Nobunaga soon died at the Incident at Honnō-ji on June 21, 1582. Upon Nobunaga&#x27;s death, Oda clan&#x27;s grasp over former Takeda territories weakened. Amidst the chaos, Oda retainers who were assigned by Nobunaga to govern those territories, such as Mori Nagayoshi and Kawajiri Hidetaka amongst others, either fled or were killed by local insurrection.

After the chaos following the death of Nobunaga, Tokugawa Ieyasu invaded Kai and Shinano province to establish control there on the consent from senior vassals of Oda clan. However, at the same time, Uesugi clan and the Hōjō clan also aspired to seize the vast area in Shinano Province, Kōzuke Province, and Kai Province (currently Gunma Prefecture), which ruled by the remnants of the many small clans formerly serving Takeda clan. following of disorder post death of Nobunaga, at the same time with Ieyasu departure an army of 8,000 soldiers to those disputed region. This caused the triangle conflict between those three factions in the event which dubbed by historians as broke out. 

On June 13, the Hōjō clan had captured Iwadono Castle in Tsuru District, and instructed Watanabe Shozaemon, a local magnate from Tsuru District to assist them in their conquest. Subsequently, Sanada Masayuki led his army and received Numata Castle to the Uesugi clan. On July 9, Masayuki changed his allegiance from the Uesugi clan to the Hōjō, he surrendered to Hōjō Ujinao.

On July 5, Takigawa Kazumasu lost decisively against the invading Hōjō army at the Battle of Kannagawa. In that occasion, Masayuki actually escorted back Kazumasu&#x27;s remaining forces through Suwa, in Shinano. Though, seeing this chance, Masayuki sent his uncle Yazawa Yoritsuna and took back Numata Castle. Also, he put his oldest son Nobuyuki in charge of Iwabitsu Castle, further reinforcing eastern Kōzuke.

On July 10, Uesugi Kagekatsu invaded Northern Shinano. Masayuki sided with the Uesugi initially, but a couple of weeks later he defected to Hōjō&#x27;s side. Both Uesugi and Hōjō&#x27;s armies came to face each other at Kawanakajima on July 30, but direct combat was avoided as the Hōjō army turned back and advanced south towards Kai province, which was in turn invaded by Tokugawa forces. Meanwhile, one of Uesugi clan&#x27;s major retainer, Shibata Shigeie, revolted and Uesugi&#x27;s forces also had to turn back from Northern Shinano to deal with it.

On July 12 as the troops under Hōjō Ujinao advanced across Usui Pass, Nobushige resisted them, abandoned the Komoro Castle, and retreated to a fortress which he deemed more suitable to defend against the Hōjō army.

On October 19, Sanada Masayuki suddenly changed his allegiance again as now he helped the Tokugawa clan by attacking Nezu Masatsuna, a lieutenant of Hōjō Ujinao, and cooperating with Yoda Nobushige to resist the Hōjō clan forces around Komoro, as Ieyasu has instructed Masayuki. It was believed by historian that the Information about Masayuki&#x27;s defection have reached the Hōjō clan in early October. In response for Masayuki betrayal, a commander of Hōjō forces named Fujita Ujikuni tried to capture Numata castle. However, he failed to do so as Masayuki resisted his attempt.

=== Conflict with Tokugawa ===

In 1583, Masayuki started the construction of Ueda Castle and the surrounding town. It became the headquarters of the Sanada clan in the following years.

In 1584, Tokugawa Ieyasu lead his army west towards Owari province in the Battle of Komaki and Nagakute against Hashiba Hideyoshi. Masayuki was left in northern Shinano to keep the Uesugi clan in check and took this opportunity to subjugate small, neighboring landlords and consolidate his power in the region. In December, as Ieyasu made peace with Hideyoshi and returned to his territory, he was pressed by Hōjō Ujinao to act on the terms of their treaty. In 1585, Masayuki moved their main bastion from Sanada-shi Yakata to Ueda Castle.

In that treaty, among other terms, Tokugawa Ieyasu agreed to transfer Numata Castle and its adjacent lands in Kōzuke province to the Hōjō clan. In April 1585, Ieyasu advanced his army into Kai province in a move to pressure Masayuki into abdicating Numata Castle. Masayuki however, resisted having to hand it over, having conquered it with great effort years before. Ultimately, he decided to cut relations with Tokugawa Ieyasu and once more switched allegiances by sending his second son Nobushige to Uesugi Kagekatsu as a hostage. With this move, he effectively joined Hashiba Hideyoshi&#x27;s side, which opposed the Tokugawa-Hōjō alliance.

Months later, Tokugawa forces invaded Sanada clan&#x27;s territory in northern Shinano province with 7,000 men and laid siege to Ueda Castle, which was defended by only 1,200 soldiers. However, Masayuki was able to inflict 1,300 casualties on Tokugawa&#x27;s side and won a decisive victory. Meanwhile, Hōjō Ujinao attacked Numata Castle, but was also rebuffed by Sanada forces. This was the First Battle of Ueda Castle, a victory that earned Masayuki national prominence. Following this, Masayuki went from being just a former Takeda retainer to become recognized as an independent &quot;daimyō&quot;.

In 1586, after Ieyasu reconciled with Hideyoshi, He was given permission by Hideyoshi to attack Masayuki in Ueda. The reason of this allowance was because Masayuki did not even sent his family as hostages to Hideyoshi to symbolize his submission. However, as Masayuki immediately ask mediation of Kagekatsu to offer his surrender to the Toyotomi clan, Hideyoshi recalled Ieyasu to abort his invasion. Then Masayuki followed by personally came to Kyoto to offer his official submission to Hideyoshi.

=== Service under Toyotomi ===

Following his victory over the Tokugawa clan, Masayuki became a vassal to Toyotomi Hideyoshi. In doing so, he sent his son Nobushige (at the time a hostage to Uesugi clan) as a hostage to Osaka.

In 1586, the Hōjō clan tried to take Numata Castle once more, but again were repelled. Tokugawa forces also gathered and marched towards Ueda Castle again, but Toyotomi Hideyoshi interposed. At this point, Hideyoshi&#x27;s political presence in Japan was too strong for the Tokugawa clan to oppose, and at his mediation, the attack was called off. However, he also designated Masayuki as a back-up power to the bigger Tokugawa forces in the region. This effectively meant that Masayuki now responded to Tokugawa Ieyasu in all military matters.

The following year, 1587, saw Masayuki travelling to Sunpu to meet with Tokugawa Ieyasu. Then, he went to Osaka to be received in audience by Toyotomi Hideyoshi, and thus formally become a vassal of the Toyotomi regime.

Two more years would pass until the dispute between the Sanada and Hōjō clans involving Numata Castle and adjacent areas would be mediated by Hideyoshi and resolved. In 1589, Hideyoshi decided the Sanada clan would relinquish all of its domain east of Tone River, including Numata Castle, to the Hōjō clan. In turn, he granted them some territory in southern Shinano. However, by the end of that year, Inomata Kuninori, a retainer from the Hōjō clan who was now holding Numata Castle, was deceived into attacking the nearby Nagurumi Castle, located west of Tone River and defended by Sanada forces. The attack was successful and the castle was seized by Hōjō forces, but by this time, Toyotomi Hideyoshi had sanctioned a rule which prohibited &quot;daimyōs&quot; from engaging in battle over private disputes. This incident fully breached this rule and it would go on to become the reason of the Siege of Odawara in 1590, and the subsequent fall of the Hōjō clan.

=== Sekigahara campaign ===
After Hideyoshi&#x27;s death in 1598, Masayuki joined Ishida Mitsunari&#x27;s side during the Battle of Sekigahara. Masayuki sent his eldest son, Nobuyuki, to the eastern side, while Masayuki and his younger son, Nobushige, fought on the western side, a move that ensured the Sanada clan&#x27;s survival.

Fortifying Ueda Castle, Masayuki fought against Tokugawa Hidetada&#x27;s 38,000 men with only 2,000 soldiers. This was the Second Battle of Ueda Castle, and, whilst it was not exactly a victory, Masayuki was able to deliver a heavy blow to Hidetada and delay his forces for long enough that they were unable to show up at the main battlefield on time. 
However, the western side, led by Ishida Mitsunari, lost the main battle, and the victorious Tokugawa Ieyasu was able to redistribute fiefs at will. Masayuki and Yukimura were initially going to be executed, but, given Nobuyuki&#x27;s participation in the eastern army, they were instead exiled to Kudoyama in Kii province. The Sanada clan was inherited by Sanada Nobuyuki.

During his time in exile, Masayuki received financial supports from Nobuyuki. According to the &quot;Senko Jitsuroku&quot; and other sources, he also received support from the Kishu Domain and Rengejoin Temple (Koyasan, Wakayama Prefecture), and was given 50 koku annually by the lord of the Kishu Domain, Asano Nagaakira. A letter from Masayuki dated January 5th, states that Masachika (Masayuki&#x27;s third son) sent 20 ryo of the windfall of 40 ryo. (in 2021, 20 ryo is equivalent to about 2 million yen as 1 ryo is equal of 100,000 yen). On March 15, 1603 (Keicho 8), Masayuki also a letter to Shinkoji Temple (Ueda City, Nagano Prefecture) (&quot;Shinkoji Documents&quot;) to ask Tokugawa Ieyasu to seek pardon through Honda Masanobu. In the postscript of the letter it is also written that Masayuki also felt grateful as Shinkoji Temple had sent him two momme (1,000 yen).

Sanada Masayuki died of an illness in Kudoyama in 1611.

==Legacy==

Even though Masayuki was never able to expand his territories as well as other &quot;daimyōs&quot;, he is nevertheless often considered a talented &quot;daimyō&quot;, doomed by misfortune and the inconvenient terrains which surrounded his home domain. Toyotomi Hideyoshi had called Masayuki a person whose inside did not match his outside, that his allegiance was fickle and not to be trusted. Nevertheless, it was exactly his drifting alliances that helped the Sanada clan survive the onslaught of hostile clans, and, since the Edo period, he has been more extolled than vilified.

<doc id="356353" wikidata="Q3948081" url="?curid=356353" title="Sanada Yukimura">
<text>, also known as , was a Japanese samurai warrior of the Sengoku period. He was especially known as the leading general on the defending side of the Siege of Osaka. 
Yukimura was called &quot;A Hero who may appear once in a hundred years&quot;, &quot;Crimson Demon of War&quot; and &quot;The Last Sengoku Hero&quot;. The famed veteran of the invasion of Korea Shimazu Tadatsune called him the .

==Early life==
He was the second son of Sanada Masayuki (1547–1611). His elder brother was Sanada Nobuyuki. He was married to Chikurin-in (Akihime), Ōtani Yoshitsugu&#x27;s daughter and adopted daughter of Toyotomi Hideyoshi.

Three other wives of Yukimura were his first wife the daughter/sister of Hotta Sakubei, who lost her status to Chikurin-in; Takanashi Naiki&#x27;s daughter and Ryūsei-in (a daughter of Toyotomi Hidetsugu).

In 1575, the Battle of Nagashino claimed the lives of two of Sanada Masayuki&#x27;s elder brothers. Masayuki, previously serving Takeda Shingen and Takeda Katsuyori as a retainer, inherited the Sanada clan and left for Ueda Castle. Yukimura also went, taking the Sanada name as well.

By 1582, the Oda-Tokugawa forces had destroyed the Takeda clan. The Sanada initially surrendered to Oda Nobunaga, but, after the incident at Honnō-ji, it became independent again, drifting between stronger &quot;daimyōs&quot; such as the Uesugi clan, the Later Hōjō clan, and the Tokugawa clan. Eventually, the Sanada clan became a vassal of Toyotomi Hideyoshi.

==Sekigahara campaign==
In 1600, before the Battle of Sekigahara, Tokugawa Ieyasu rallied various &quot;daimyōs&quot; to attack Uesugi Kagekatsu. The Sanada clan complied as well, but when Ishida Mitsunari decided to challenge Ieyasu, Masayuki and Yukimura joined the western forces, parting ways with Masayuki&#x27;s eldest son and Yukimura&#x27;s brother, Nobuyuki, who joined the eastern forces. It has been said that at first Yukimura followed Ieyasu but, after Ieyasu tried to seize his territory he betrayed Ieyasu. The true motive of Masayuki and Yukimura&#x27;s decision is disputed with many theories, but there are two main schools of thought: in one, Masayuki made the decision (and Yukimura agreed); he expressed the willingness to take a gamble, so that if he were to join the weak side and win the battle, the Sanada would gain much more power. The other theory is the opposite where they planned a safety net; Masayuki, Yukimura, and Nobuyuki discussed the situation when Ieyasu asked them to state their allegiance clearly, and they decided to join separate sides, so that, regardless of the outcome of the battle, the Sanada clan would survive.

===Siege of Ueda and Exile===

The Sanada retreated and fortified Ueda Castle. When Tokugawa Hidetada marched a sizable army on the Nakasendō, the Sanada resisted and were able to fight Hidetada&#x27;s 40,000 men with only 2,000. However, as the castle did not fall in the short time that he expected, Hidetada gave up and joined the main Tokugawa army, too late however, to participate in the crucial Battle of Sekigahara. 

After the battle, Sanada&#x27;s territory was seized by Tokugawa under Nobuyuki, but Yukimura and Masayuki were exiled to Mt. Koya in the Kii Peninsula. Ueda Castle was given to Nobuyuki. Later, Yukimura rose against the Tokugawa when the Winter Battle of Osaka Castle broke out in 1614.

==Osaka campaign==


The Siege of Osaka Castle was a series of battles undertaken by the Tokugawa shogunate against the Toyotomi clan, and ending in that clan&#x27;s destruction. Divided into two stages (Winter Campaign and Summer Campaign), lasting from 1614 to 1615, the siege put an end to the last major armed opposition to the shogunate&#x27;s establishment. The end of the conflict is sometimes referred to as the Genna Armistice (Genna Embu), because the era name was changed from Keichō to Genna immediately following the siege.

===Winter Siege of Osaka Castle===
The winter campaign began on November 19, 1614; Osaka Castle siege commenced on December 4, 1614, and lasted until January 22, 1615, when a truce was reached.

On November 19, Tokugawa forces (approx. 3,000 men) attacked a fort across the Kizu River, destroying it. A week later, Tokugawa forces attacked the village of Imafuku with 1,500 men against a defending force of 600. With the aid of a squad of arquebusiers, the Tokugawa claimed victory once again. Several more small forts and villages were attacked before the siege on Osaka Castle itself began on December 4, 1614. Yukimura built a small fortress called Sanada-maru in the southwest corner of Osaka Castle. The Sanada-maru was an earthwork barbican defended by 7,000 men under Yukimura&#x27;s command. From there, he defeated the Tokugawa forces (approx. 30,000 men) with groups of 6,000 arquebusiers. The Shōgun&#x27;s forces were repeatedly repelled, and the Sanada troops launched a number of attacks against the siege lines, breaking through three times. Ieyasu then resorted to artillery, which included 17 imported European cannons and domestic wrought iron cannons, as well as sappers employed to dig under the walls of the fortress. The fortress was impregnable; the Tokugawa suffered many losses.

Ieyasu gave up trying to destroy the castle during this battle, and sued for peace with Toyotomi Hideyori. He proposed a condition for the reconciliation, i.e. to destroy the outer moat of the castle. When his envoy entered the castle grounds, they destroyed not only the outer moat but the inner moat as well.

===Summer Siege of Osaka Castle and Death===
On June 3, 1615 (6th day of 5th month of 20 year of Keicho era), at the Battle of Dōmyōji, Sanada Yukimura was in command of the Osaka Army on the right wing and engaged in a battle with Date Masamune forces in the area of Emperor Ōjin&#x27;s Tomb and Konda Hachiman Shrine. This fight took place at around 12:00 and by 5:00 PM Sanada Yukimura made the decision to retreat towards Osaka Castle.

On June 3, 1615 (7th day of 5th month of 20 year of Keicho era), at the Battle of Tennōji after hurrying back to Osaka castle, Yukimura found the massive Tokugawa force of nearly 150,000 moving into positions in order to make their final assault on the castle. As the Tokugawa units were still moving into formation, the Toyotomi forces launched a last ditch offensive with their approximate 54,000 to 60,000 troops that hoped to take the still loose Tokugawa formations off-guard. As the vanguard of the Tokugawa left flank under Matsudaira Tadanao marched to their positions, Yukimura&#x27;s troops charged down from Chausuyama (茶臼山) and fought with desperate abandon together with Mori Katsunaga&#x27;s contingent. As Matsudaira&#x27;s line began to crumble, Ieyasu rushed his personal body of troops up to support Matsudaira and Yukimura saw his chance to smash through the center. If he could keep the center of the Tokugawa forces tied up long enough for Hideyori to sally out of the castle and lead a general charge on the exposed Tokugawa flank, the Toyotomi forces might have a chance at victory—or so he hoped. Thus, at this moment, Yukimura dispatched his son, Sanada Daisuke back to the castle to urge Hideyori to seize the moment and sally forward. But Hideyori was too late. As the fighting raged around him, the exhausted Yukimura collapsed on a camp stool. 

A recent theory regarding the death of Yukimura posits that Yukimura was killed after a bout of single combat with Munetsugu by spear. At first Munetsugu did not recognize Yukimura and cut off his head and brought it back to the Tokugawa army camp. Yukimura&#x27;s head was only recognized when an acquitaince of the Sanada clan visited the camp and recognized that it was Yukimura.

==Legends and popular depiction==

According to primary historical sources and personal letters, he was never referred to as Yukimura. That name surfaced in a military novel written during the Edo period and has since been popularized in modern plays, books, novels, and different media of entertainment. The historical documents use his historical name &quot;Nobushige&quot;.

A legend says that Yukimura had ten heroes who took an active role at the battles at Osaka Castle. They were called the Sanada Ten Braves, a group of ninja.

A myth says he indeed managed to kill Ieyasu, but the Ogoshō was replaced by a &quot;kagemusha&quot; (a decoy or doppelganger) called Ogasawara Hidemasa. This myth is testimony to the respect modern Japanese have for Yukimura&#x27;s skills as a military commander.

Another legend states that in the winter of 1614, Tokugawa Ieyasu sent an envoy to Yukimura with a notice that, if he were to abandon the Toyotomi cause, he would give him the entire prefecture of Shinano and 400,000 koku. Yukimura laughed and posted the notice on the wall for all in the castle to see.

<text>Steller&#x27;s eider (Polysticta stelleri) is a migrating Arctic diving duck that breeds along the coastlines of eastern Russia and Alaska. It is the rarest, smallest, and fastest flying of the eider species.

Due to the extensive contraction of its breeding range, the Alaska-breeding population of Steller&#x27;s eider was listed as vulnerable in 1997 by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN). The species is protected in Russia and the U.S. and is the subject of an ongoing recovery plan by the European Union and U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service.

== Taxonomy ==
Steller&#x27;s eider was formally described and illustrated in 1769 by the German naturalist Peter Simon Pallas from a specimen collected on the Kamchatka Peninsula in Eastern Russia. He coined the binomial name &quot;Anas stelleri&quot;; the specific epithet was chosen to honour the German naturalist and explorer Georg Wilhelm Steller. Steller&#x27;s eider is now the only species placed in the genus &quot;Polysticta&quot; that was introduced in 1836 by the English naturalist Thomas Eyton. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name is from Ancient Greek &quot;polustiktos&quot; meaning &quot;much spotted&quot; (from &quot;polus&quot; &quot;many&quot; and &quot;stiktos&quot; &quot;spotted&quot;).

Despite its name, it is only distantly related to all other extant eider species, which are part of the &quot;Somateria&quot; genus. Steller&#x27;s eider was separated from other eider species into its own genus in 1945 due to behavioral and anatomical differences. Accordingly, Steller&#x27;s eider may provide a taxonomic link between the eider species in the &quot;Somateria&quot; genus and the other sea ducks. It is most closely related to the extinct Labrador duck.

==Description==

Steller’s eider is the smallest of four eider species, with both females and males weighing 800 grams on average (1.8 pounds). They have a compact body with a relatively large head, long tail, and a long, thick bill. The males assume their breeding plumage from early winter to midsummer with a black cap, chin, throat, eye-ring, and rump, with a white head and shoulders, light-green patches behind the head and in front of the eye, cinnamon breast and shoulders marked with a prominent black spot. The wings appear to be striped white, with an iridescent bluish-purple background colour and white border. They have palmate feet (3 fully webbed toes) which are a dark bluish-gray, the same color as the legs. In mid-summer to fall, males assume their non-breeding plumage which is primarily dark brown with a white-bordered bluish speculum (secondary feathers) on their wing. Females are a dark to cinnamon brown with a pale-white eye-ring, similar to the lighter brown juveniles. Females also have iridescent bluish-purple speculums with a white border running the entire length of the secondaries.

== Habitat and distribution ==
During the winter, Steller’s eiders occupy coastal bays and lagoons that offer suitable forage while occasionally feeding in deeper waters that remain adequately sheltered. They nest in marshy tundra along the coast, in areas dominated by water sedge and pendant grass. Within the marshy tundra, they designate specific areas to build their nest, preferring elevated surfaces covered by shallow vegetation such as mosses and grasses. Their molting habitat consists of relatively shallow coastal lagoons that offer viable eelgrass and tidal flats for foraging and beaches and sandbars to rest while they remain flightless.

=== Population distributions ===
There are three recognized breeding populations of Steller’s eiders, one in Alaska and two in Arctic Russia.

* The Russian-Atlantic population makes its breeding ground west of the Khatanga River in western Siberia and winters in the Barents and Baltic seas.
* The Russian-Pacific population nests on the east side of the Khatanga River and spends its winters in the southern Bering Sea and northern Pacific Ocean.
* The Alaska-breeding population nests on the Arctic Coastal Plain and in exceptionally small numbers in the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, and winters in the southern Bering Sea and northern Pacific ocean. Less than 1% of the world’s Steller’s eiders nest in Alaska.
Some non-breeding populations will also spend their summers in northern Norway, on the east coast of Russia and adjacent waters, and south-west Alaska.

== Behaviour and ecology ==
=== Diet ===

Steller&#x27;s eiders forage primarily near the shore by employing various techniques such as briefly diving and swimming underwater (to a maximum depth of 9m), wading and dabbling. They feed by surface techniques more than other sea ducks and prefer relatively small prey. Studies have shown that Steller&#x27;s eiders are specialists in catching highly mobile prey but may limit their diet to crustaceans even when higher energy sources, such as capelin, become available. This discrepancy in food preferences may be due to their inability to exploit deeper habitats. Steller&#x27;s eiders also feed on mollusks, echinoderms, polychaete worms, and mussels during the winter. While in the tundra during the summer months, they feed on aquatic insects and plant material such as crowberries and pondweeds.

=== Reproduction ===
According to banding studies, Steller&#x27;s eiders can live up to 21 years and four months and reach sexual maturity at two years. Males engage in leks on the wintering and breeding grounds, where groups of males attempt to win over an individual female with elaborate displays. Males court females in silence by displaying a consistent sequence of side-to-side head-shaking while swimming towards and away from their potential female partner. Steller&#x27;s eiders tend to form breeding pairs during late-winter to early-spring instead of the fall like most waterfowl. Breeding pairs arrive at their nesting sites as early as the beginning of June.

Females establish their nests in marshy tundra close to permanent open water that has additional access to small ponds. They specifically select mounds or ridges dominated by mosses, lichens, and grasses. Their nest is shallow, lined with grasses, moss, lichens, and down feathers plucked from the female&#x27;s breast, who builds the nest without help from the male.

Females usually lay 1–8 olive to brownish-orange eggs per breeding cycle. She then incubates the eggs alone for about 25 days. The young are precocial and hatch between late June and late July with their eyes open and sporting downy feathers. However, predators consume the majority of eggs before they are hatched. The young go to the water shortly after hatching and immediately feed themselves, without relying on their mother for food. Regardless of their feeding independence, females will stay within 700m of their nest for up to 35 days post-hatch, while the young begin flying approximately 40 days after hatching. It is not uncommon for one female to assume care of two or more sets of young from a different mother.
=== Vocalization ===
Males make a low jumbled growling sound, while females make a discrete qua-haaa sound of a similar tone. Males have also been reported to produce a repetitive crackling sound when females go underwater. Notably, the males court the females in silence. During flight, their feathers produce a mechanical whistling sound.

=== Molt ===
After breeding, Steller&#x27;s eiders gather in high-density flocks to synchronously molt (replace all their feather at the same time) in Arctic lagoons in northwest Asia and along the Alaska peninsula. They remain flightless for about three weeks, but the entire flight-feather molt lasts from July to October. Juveniles molt first, followed by adult males and adult females.

== Threats ==
The decline of Alaska-breeding Steller’s eider population is predominantly unclear. It has been attributed to changes to the Arctic climate, increased predation rates, hunting and consumption of lead shot, and disease. Since their listing, additional threats such as exposure to oil and other contaminants have been identified.

=== Climate change ===
Climate change may pose the greatest threat to Steller’s eiders. Primarily, climate change has caused Arctic tundra ponds to disappear, limiting the extent of suitable habitat for the species. Climate change has also been implicated in the collapse of rodent populations, forcing predators to exploit alternative prey such as the eggs and young of Steller&#x27;s eider.

=== Lead poisoning ===
High levels of lead have been reported in Steller’s eiders that nest on the Alaska Arctic Coastal plain and in Spectacled Eiders that occupy the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta, where Steller’s Eiders continue to nest in highly reduced densities. Further studies have also shown that lead concentration was higher in individuals located close to industrialized regions than non-industrialized regions.

=== Nest predation ===
Nest predation by the Arctic fox, pomarine jaeger, snowy owl, and common raven pose the greatest threat to Steller’s eider&#x27;s nesting success rate. Studies have shown that Steller’s eider reproduce most successfully when lemmings are abundant, most likely resulting from predators transitioning between prey during years of lemming decline.

=== Natural resource exploitation ===
The exploitation of natural resources such as oil and gas contributes to Steller’s eider habitat loss. Regional exploitation projects have increased the risk of spill contamination. At the same time, an increase in human presence and infrastructure have contributed to the demise of suitable habitats.

=== Disease ===
Steller’s eiders transport the Avian Influenza virus between Eurasia and North America during their migrations. Many recent studies have reported prominent infection rates amongst Steller’s eiders in Alaska, ranging from 0.2% to 5%. It has been suggested that 80% of Steller’s eiders in Alaska are carriers of avian influenza antibodies.

&quot;E. coli&quot; has also been reported in Alaska-breeding Steller’s eiders and is thought to be linked to wastewater from local human communities and industrialization.

== Recovery plan ==
Two-recovery plans have been implemented to restore healthy populations of Steller’s eiders.  The European Union action plan, published in 2000 and The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service action plan, originally published in 2002.

=== U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service Action Plan ===
The Recovery Plan for the Alaska-breeding population of Steller’s eider (Polysticta stelleri) was last revised by the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service in September 2020. The primary focus of this plan is to ensure a viable breeding population of Steller’s eider in northern Alaska, rather than aiming for two subpopulations in northern and western Alaska. The plan aims to:

* Increase the abundance of Steller’s eiders
* Ensure adequate population distribution throughout the Utqiaġvik Triangle and Arctic Coastal Plain survey areas
* Increase the number of Alaska-breeding Steller’s eiders

The recovery plan is primarily limited by uncertainty about the Alaska-breeding Steller’s eider’s ecology and population dynamics. Thus, the action plan coincides with an effort to conduct research and enhance knowledge of the species.

The U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service predicts that if the plan is adequately funded and properly implemented, the recovery criteria could be met by 2050. The total cost is estimated at $15,675,000.

==== Critical habitat designation ====
In 2001 the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service designated five critical breeding habitats on the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta and four marine water units along the coast of southwest Alaska that are critical for molting, feeding, and wintering. The entire designation includes approximately 2,800 square miles and 850 miles of coastline.

== Conservation status ==

In 2016, the global population of Steller’s eider was estimated at 110,000-125,000 individuals and classified as vulnerable by the International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN).

In 1992, the U.S. Fish and Wildlife Service reviewed the status of Steller’s eider and concluded that listing the species as endangered was warranted, but precluded by higher species listing priorities. One year later, in 1993, they reconsidered Steller’s eider’s status and supported the listing of the Alaska-breeding population, but did not include the Russian-breeding populations. Finally, the Alaska-breeding population was listed as threatened in 1997. The primary reason for listing was the near disappearance of the Yukon-Kuskokwim Delta population, contracting the Alaskan nesting sites to the Arctic Coastal Plain and increasing the population’s risk of extirpation.`

== Cultural significance ==
Steller’s eiders were once legally harvested by waterfowl hunters in the U.S., but all legal hunting ended in 1991. Egging and subsistence hunting still occurs in Alaska, but is uncommon. The degree of subsistence hunting in Russia and its effect on the population is poorly documented.

<text>was a province of Japan in the area of northeastern Shikoku. Sanuki bordered on Awa to the south, and Iyo to the west. Its abbreviated form name was . In terms of the Gokishichidō system, Sanuki was one of the provinces of the Nankaidō circuit. Under the &quot;Engishiki&quot; classification system, Sanuki was ranked as one of the &quot;upper countries&quot; (上国) in terms of importance, and one of the &quot;middle countries&quot; (中国) in terms of distance from the capital. The provincial capital was located in what is now the city of Sakaide, but its exact location was only identified in 2012. The &quot;ichinomiya&quot; of the province is the Tamura jinja located on the city of Takamatsu.

==History==
In the &quot;Kojiki&quot; and other ancient texts, this area was called , but was also called &quot;Sanuki&quot; under various spellings. Sanuki Province was formed by the Ritsuryo reforms. The Shiwaku Islands in the Seto Inland Sea were initially considered part of the province, but Shōdoshima and the Naoshima Islands were not transferred from Bizen Province until the Edo Period. In the Heian period, Sanuki was famous for its associations with the Buddhist monk Kūkai as both his birthplace and the place of his early upbringing. Later, the famed poet Sugawara no Michizane served as governor of the province from 886 to 890 AD. At the end of the Heian period, the Heike clan, which controlled maritime routes on the Seto Inland Sea, had Yashima as one of their main strongholds, but were defeated by Minamoto no Yoshitsune at the Battle of Yashima. In the Muromachi period, the area came under the control of the Hosokawa clan, who were appointed as &quot;shugo&quot; by the Ashikaga shogunate. However, in the Sengoku period, the Hosokawa were eclipsed by the Miyoshi clan. The Miyoshi were in turn invaded by Chōsokabe clan from Tosa Province and the Chōsokabe were in turn defeated by Toyotomi Hideyoshi. The province was awarded by Hideyoshi to his general Ikoma Chikamasa, who made Takamatsu Castle his stronghold.

In the Edo period, Sanuki was divided into five areas; three han, &quot;tenryō&quot; territory under direct control of the Tokugawa shogunate and a part of Tsuyama Domain whose headquarters was on Honshū.

Per the early Meiji period , an official government assessment of the nation’s resources, the province had 395 villages with a total &quot;kokudaka&quot; of 293,628 &quot;koku&quot;. Sanuki Province consisted of the following districts:

Following the abolition of the han system, Sanuki Province became Kagawa Prefecture in 1872. However, the following year Kagawa was merged with Tokushima Prefecture and the island of Awaji to form . It was separated again on September 5, 1875, but on August 21, 1876 was merged with Ehime Prefecture. It was separated again on December 3, 1888.

<text>Atlasov Island, known in Russian as Ostrov Atlasova(Остров Атласова), or in Japanese as Araido (阿頼度島), is the northernmost island and volcano and also the highest volcano of the Kuril Islands, part of the Sakhalin Oblast in Russia. The Russian name is sometimes rendered in English as Atlasova Island. Other names for the island include Uyakhuzhach, Oyakoba (Ainu) and Alaid, the name of the volcano on the island.

The island is named after Vladimir Atlasov, a 17th-century Russian explorer who incorporated the nearby Kamchatka Peninsula into Russia. It is essentially the cone of the submarine volcano Vulkan Alaid protruding above the Sea of Okhotsk to a height of . The island has an area of , and is currently uninhabited. Numerous pyroclastic cones dot the lower flanks of basaltic to basaltic andesite volcano, particularly on the NW and SE sides, including an offshore cone formed during the 1933–34 eruption.

Its near perfect shape gave rise to many legends about the volcano among the peoples of the region, such as the Itelmens and Kuril Ainu. The Russian scientist Stepan Krasheninnikov was told the story that it was once a mountain in Kamchatka, but the neighbouring mountains became jealous of its beauty and exiled it to the sea, leaving behind Kurile Lake in southern Kamchatka. Geographically, this story is not without evidence, as after the last Ice Age most of the icecaps melted, raising the world&#x27;s water level, and possibly submerging a land bridge to the volcano.
Following the transfer of the Kuril Islands to Japan by the Treaty of St Petersburg, 1875, Oyakoba as it is called by the Ainu and some Japanese, became the northernmost island of the empire and subject of much aesthetic praise, described in haiku, ukiyo-e, etc.
Ito Osamu (1926) described it as more exquisitely shaped than Mount Fuji.

Administratively this island belongs to the Severo-Kurilsky District, in the Sakhalin Oblast of the Russian Federation.

<doc id="356357" wikidata="Q263497" url="?curid=356357" title="Oundle">
<text>Oundle () is a market town and civil parish on the left bank of the River Nene in North Northamptonshire, England, which had a population of 6,254 at the time of the 2021 census. It is north of London and south-west of Peterborough. The town is home to Oundle School.

==History==

The town&#x27;s name origin is uncertain. It is probably an old district name, in a grammatical form suggesting a tribal name, &#x27;the Undalas&#x27;.

Discoveries of prehistoric and Bronze Age, Iron Age and Roman materials suggest that Oundle has been a settlement location for several thousand years. Findings have included a number of Iron Age coins, and Roman bronze pins, coins and skeletons. A significant Roman find was part of a Roman cup discovered in the church yard of St. Peter&#x27;s Church in the early 19th Century. Further excavation on the site led to the findings of many Roman coins, some from the time of the reign of Emperor Claudius. The finding of red tile and building stone at a site near Ashton Road, Oundle is seen as suggestive that there may have been a Roman villa there; a nearby archaeological evaluation found a ditch containing fragments of Romano-British pottery.

The Saxon invasion saw the arrival of a tribe called &quot;Undalas&quot; which possibly meant &quot;undivided&quot;. Oundle was the site of a hospitium, a building used by monks to give shelter and assistance to travellers, which dates back to 638 AD. It is the death place of St Wilfrid in 709 AD where he had consecrated a church as well as being the location of one of his monasteries. The current St Peter&#x27;s Church occupies the same site as St Wilfrid&#x27;s original church.

The first clear reference to Oundle is to be found in a 715 account by Eddi, who was the chantor to St Wilfrid, who referred to it as &quot;Undolum&quot;. Bede variously refers to it as &quot;Inundalum&quot; and &quot;Undulana mœgð&quot;.

Saint Cetta or Cett, a 7th-century saint, is the Patron Saint of Oundle. Very little is known of him but according to the Anglo-Saxon Secgan Manuscript he was buried in the monastery at Oundle, near the River Nene, around 1000 AD and a chapel to him built in the 11th century, on the small knoll beyond the end of St Osyths Lane. This and the market charter granted in 972 explain the growth of Oundle in the 12th century.

The Domesday Book of 1086 records Oundle in Polebrook hundred with a population of 36 households, a mill and a value in 1066 of £0.3, which had risen to £11 by 1086.

There has been a grammar school in Oundle since at least 1465, at which Sir William Laxton (Lord Mayor of London) was educated. In his will he left a legacy to found Laxton Grammar School in 1556, now known as Oundle School, administered by the Worshipful Company of Grocers.

In 1743 a group of mutineers from the Black Watch were captured at Ladywood, near Oundle. They had deserted in protest at being sent abroad, instead of patrolling the Highlands, for which the regiment had been raised. The Old Town Hall, which replaced an earlier building on the same site dating back to the 16th century, was completed in 1830.

==Governance==

Oundle is part of the parliamentary constituency of Corby and East Northamptonshire. The current Member of Parliament (MP) for Corby is Lee Barron of the Labour Party, who was elected in July 2024.

At a local level, the town elects 12 people every four years to the Oundle Town Council. The council is a non-politically affiliated group that works to further the social and economic interests of Oundle. A Mayor and Deputy Mayor are elected by the council every May.

==Geography==
Oundle is a town located in the North Northamptonshire district of Northamptonshire county, on the River Nene, with Corby 9 miles to the west, and Peterborough 12 miles to the north-east. Oundle falls into the &#x27;PE8&#x27; post-code district for Peterborough.

The Oundle Parish consists of approximately 900 hectares and covers the entire urban build, as well as open countryside. The boundary follows the River Nene to the East and South of the town, and extends west to Oundle Wood and north to Park Wood. This boundary was established during an extensive East Northants Boundary review in 2013.

===Geology===
The region itself is located on solid formations from the Jurassic age, with Oundle being built on the sedimentary rock oolite.

==Economy==
Oundle is home to one of two factories producing luxury motor yachts for Fairline Yachts Ltd. The original company, Fairline Boats, which was also located in Oundle entered administration in 2015 before being acquired by Russian investors in January 2016.

==Landmarks==
===Public houses===

Among the oldest buildings is the Talbot Hotel. This was constructed of timber; it was rebuilt with stone in 1626 from the ruins of nearby Fotheringhay Castle. The hotel is notable for the claim of being haunted by the ghost of Mary, Queen of Scots, who was executed in Fotheringhay in 1587. The hotel is said to contain the oak staircase taken from the ruins of Fotheringhay Castle that Mary walked down while being escorted to her execution.
The hotel has a room named the Drumming Well Room, named after a well in a yard that was reputed to produce a drumming noise warning of events of ill-omen or of imminent death.

Other public houses include The Rose &amp; Crown, a 17th-century inn, The Ship Inn, a 14th-century coaching inn, The George, and The Riverside, which has become derelict.

===Churches===
There are a number of churches. By far the most prominent, its 210-foot spire being the tallest in Northamptonshire, is St Peter&#x27;s Church which has the main churchyard. There are also Methodist, Baptist and Roman Catholic churches. The Baptist church has a premises on St Osyth&#x27;s Lane but holds services on Sunday mornings at Oundle Church of England Primary School.

===The Stahl Theatre===
The Stahl Theatre is a 264-seat theatre venue owned by Oundle School that was previously a disused Congregational Church chapel on West Street. Oundle School, under the instruction of then housemaster John Harrison, bought the building in the late 1970s and converted the chapel into the theatre which opened for performances in 1980. Harrison became the building&#x27;s director and produced many performances before his retirement in 1993. In 2012 he returned to produce &quot;Love&#x27;s Labour&#x27;s Lost&quot;, his 100th Stahl Theatre production before his death in 2018. The building is named after Ronald Stahl, a US citizen who lived in Oundle in 1900. Today, the theatre is used by a variety of local groups, including Oundle School, Oundle Church of England Primary school and the local Oundle Gilbert &amp; Sullivan Players.

===War memorial===
The war memorial, known officially as the Oundle and Ashton War Memorial, is located at the junction of New Street and West Street. Constructed in 1920 at a cost of £600, it was unveiled on 14 November 1920 by Mr F.W. Sanderson and dedicated at the same ceremony by Canon Smalley Law, the Vicar of Oundle. Originally commemorating the local lives lost during the First World War, it also includes dedications to those killed in the Second World War. The memorial takes the form of a five-stepped octagonal base surmounted by two square plinths and a slightly tapering rectangular pillar. In turn, this is further surmounted by a small cross. The memorial was classed as a Grade II listed building by Historic England on 7 June 1974, which classes it as a &#x27;particularly important building of more than special interest.&#x27;

The memorial has inscriptions to 95 people killed in the two wars. 68 for the First World War and 27 for the Second World War. The now closed Oundle Middle School took the names of four of those inscribed on the memorial as names of its school houses, those were D.F. Barber, J.L. Marlow, J.H. Mason and P. Richardson. All four served in the Royal Air Force during the Second World War.

==Transport==
===Road===
Oundle is located off the A605 that links the A14 at Thrapston to the A1 at Peterborough. The road at Oundle underwent major improvements in 1985 resulting in the Oundle bypass being opened on 12 December 1985 by Princess Alice, Duchess of Gloucester and is commemorated by a plinth and brass plaque at the roundabout.

===Rail===
With the definitive closure of Oundle railway station in late 1972, there are currently no rail links operating in Oundle. The station originally opened in June 1845 and was designed by John Livock, a prominent architect at the time who was best known for his railway station construction. The original station building is still in use today as private residential property.

===Bus===
There is no main bus station in Oundle, however, there are regular services stopping in the market place with several other stops located throughout the town. The primary bus route servicing Oundle daily is the Stagecoach operated X4 that links Northampton and Peterborough.

==Education==

The town&#x27;s most notable school is Oundle School, a public school with around a thousand pupils, most of whom are boarders. The two other schools in the town are Prince William School, a comprehensive school named after the late Prince William of Gloucester, and Oundle Church of England Primary School, which rated as &quot;Outstanding&quot; in its 2011 Ofsted inspection.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC East and ITV Anglia. Television signals are received from the Sandy Heath TV transmitter, BBC East Midlands and ITV Central can also be received from the Waltham TV transmitter. 

The town is covered by both BBC Radio Northampton and BBC Radio Cambridgeshire. Other radio stations including Heart East, Smooth East Midlands (formerly Connect FM) and OSCAR Radio, a school-based radio station which broadcast from the Oundle School in the town. 

Local newspapers are Peterborough Telegraph and Nene Valley News, a local independent community newspaper.

Oundle hosts a number of annual events, notably:
*The Oundle International Festival (OIF) is an annual music festival and pipe organ school, founded in 1985, with the training of young organists as its core. These summer schools are centred on a Frobenius organ in the Oundle School chapel. A concurrent festival programme for the public was also planned as a recurrent feature.

<text>The Binnenhof (; ) and Buitenhof (Outer Court) is a complex of buildings in the city centre of The Hague, Netherlands, next to the Hofvijver (Court Pond). It houses the meeting place of both houses of the States General of the Netherlands, as well as the Ministry of General Affairs and the office of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands. Built primarily in the 13th century, the Gothic castle originally functioned as residence of the counts of Holland and became the political centre of the Dutch Republic in 1584. It is counted among the Top 100 Dutch heritage sites. The Binnenhof is among the oldest parliament buildings in the world still in use.

== History ==

Little is known about the origin of the Binnenhof. Presumably, the grounds next to the Hofvijver lake, and the small homestead on it, were purchased by Count Floris IV of Holland from Meiland van Wassenaar in November 1229. Between 1230 and 1234 he had the homestead expanded to a small keep. After Floris&#x27; son and successor William II was crowned King of the Romans in 1248, this construction continued. Between 1248 and 1280, William had the Ridderzaal built. To its left and right, walls were built, which divided the area in front of the building from that behind it. Both walls had a gate. At the end of the wall on the left, near the Hofvijver, the court chapel was built, and near that the Ridderhuis (&#x27;Knights&#x27; House&#x27;) where visiting knights were sheltered. William died in battle in 1256, before the construction of the Ridderzaal had finished, and the castle was completed during the reign of his son, Floris V.

The Binnenhof was the residence of the counts of Holland for a short period. After the house of Holland died out in 1299, the county fell into the hands of the counts of Hainaut. The counts of Hainaut barely resided in the Binnenhof in the early 14th century. Duke Albert I of Bavaria and his successor William II lived in the Binnenhof virtually permanently. Under their reign, the castle saw a sizeable expansion, and gradually became enclosed by buildings.

When Holland had become part of the Burgundian Empire in 1432, the Binnenhof lost its purpose and was abandoned. Part of the complex was later made into the residence of the stadtholder of Holland, who governed the county in absence of its ruler. After Philip II was deposed as Count of Holland and the Dutch Republic was proclaimed in 1581, the Ridderzaal was initially a public space, often used by traders, stallholders and book sellers. In 1584, stadtholder Maurice moved into the stadtholder&#x27;s quarter, and in the same year, the Ridderzaal became the meeting place of the newly formed States General of the Dutch Republic. The expansions of the Binnenhof by Maurice were the beginning of a gradually advancing reconstruction of the castle that ended after the construction of the southern wing under stadtholder William V, in the late 18th century.

Between 1806 and 1810, under French rule, the administrative centre of the Netherlands was moved to Amsterdam, and the Binnenhof became useless and it was considered for demolition. When the Netherlands gained independence from France, however, the government moved back to the Binnenhof. The existence of the building was in danger a second time in 1848, when a new constitution instituted a system of parliamentary democracy and the States General wished to symbolically demolish the old government buildings and build a new complex. The local residents, however, cared more for the historic value of the building, and successfully protested against demolition.

== Layout ==
Originally built as a ballroom, the Gothic Ridderzaal (a great hall, literally &#x27;Knight&#x27;s Hall&#x27;) today forms the centre of the Binnenhof. Every third Tuesday of September, on Prinsjesdag, this is where the King holds his annual Speech from the Throne. Other buildings shape a rectangle around the Ridderzaal, creating a large courtyard in front of the building, and a smaller square behind it. A gilt Neo-Gothic fountain adorns the courtyard and a statue of King William II, one of few Dutch equestrian statues, guards its gate, the Stadtholder&#x27;s Gate, which dates from 1620.

Looking out over the Hofvijver, the Senate sits in a chamber in the western corner of the Binnenhof, while the House of Representatives originally sat in the southern corner, at the other side of the Stadtholder&#x27;s Gate. Today, the lower house meets in a chamber in the large modern eastern part of the complex. The Prime Minister&#x27;s office has since 1982 been located in the small tower in the northern corner, simply called the Torentje (&#x27;Little Tower&#x27;). Located in the north-western wing, the Trêveszaal is a meeting room originally built for negotiations during the Eighty Years&#x27; War; today, it is the meeting room of the Cabinet.

== Renovation ==

From fall 2021 (after Prinsjesdag), the Binnenhof has been undergoing a full renovation.

In 2014, a specially assigned task force, Renovatie Binnenhof, suggested a large renovation for the Binnenhof. Before that, only small maintenance had been done to the complex. Mostly the older buildings, next to the Hofvijver, are in need of renovation, such as Het Torentje (office of the Prime Minister of the Netherlands), de Trêveszaal (where the cabinet of the Netherlands holds its weekly meetings) and several other buildings. The renovation will mostly focus around air conditioning and central heating installations, IT systems, elevators, fire safety and modernisation of the kitchens.

In December 2015 a majority of the Dutch Parliament elected a plan for a full renovation of the complex, which will take approximately 5.5 years and is estimated to cost around €475 million. The first plan was to start the renovations in 2018, however this was postponed several times. The Senate will be moved during the renovation to the former building of the Ministry of Foreign Affairs, which has been prepared by a €40 million remodeling. The Prime Minister of the Netherlands and the Ministry of General Affairs will be moved to the Catshuis, where a temporary office building will house several hundred officials. The senate will be moved to Huis Huguetan, the former Supreme Court of the Netherlands building. The house of representatives will be moved to the former building of the secretary of state.

In 2017, the architectural firm Office for Metropolitan Architecture (OMA) received the assignment for designing and preparing the renovation. In early 2019 information was leaked that the projected cost for several &#x27;activities&#x27; such as painting, carpets and security was off by around €60 million. Also, in 2019, the contract with OMA was discontinued. Another architectural firm, DOK, under the lead of architect Pi de Bruijn, who also designed the new construction for the Senate, was assigned to finish the plans. In the summer of 2021, politicians and officials will be moved to their temporary workplaces and after Prinsjesdag, which is on 21 September 2021, construction will begin in and around the Binnenhof.

The estimated costs of the renovation had risen to €2 billion by 2024, and completion was expected by 2028 at the earliest. Discoveries of additional deferred maintenance, defects, and asbestos were cited amongst the causes. For example, it was found that the ceiling in the Senate was unstable, and water of the Hofvijver lake was entering the complex through holes in the foundation.

<text>This article presents a list of commands used by MS-DOS compatible operating systems, especially as used on IBM PC compatibles. Many unrelated disk operating systems use the DOS acronym and are not part of the scope of this list.

In MS-DOS, many standard system commands are provided for common tasks such as listing files on a disk or moving files. Some commands are built into the command interpreter; others exist as external commands on disk. Over multiple generations, commands were added for additional functions. In Microsoft Windows, a command prompt window that uses many of the same commands, cmd.exe, can still be used.

==Command processing==
The command interpreter for DOS runs when no application programs are running. When an application exits, if the transient portion of the command interpreter in memory was overwritten, DOS will reload it from disk. Some commands are internal—built into COMMAND.COM; others are external commands stored on disk. When the user types a line of text at the operating system command prompt, COMMAND.COM will parse the line and attempt to match a command name to a built-in command or to the name of an executable program file or batch file on disk. If no match is found, an error message is printed, and the command prompt is refreshed.

External commands were too large to keep in the command processor, or were less frequently used. Such utility programs would be stored on disk and loaded just like regular application programs but were distributed with the operating system. Copies of these utility command programs had to be on an accessible disk, either on the current drive or on the command path set in the command interpreter.

In the list below, commands that can accept more than one file name, or a filename including wildcards (* and ?), are said to accept a &quot;filespec&quot; (file specification) parameter. Commands that can accept only a single file name are said to accept a &quot;filename&quot; parameter. Additionally, command line switches, or other parameter strings, can be supplied on the command line. Spaces and symbols such as a &quot;/&quot; or a &quot;-&quot; may be used to allow the command processor to parse the command line into filenames, file specifications, and other options.

The command interpreter preserves the case of whatever parameters are passed to commands, but the command names themselves and file names are case-insensitive.

Many commands are the same across many DOS systems, but some differ in command syntax or name.

==DOS commands==
A partial list of the most common commands for MS-DOS and IBM PC DOS follows below.

===APPEND===
Sets the path to be searched for data files or displays the current search path. 
The APPEND command is similar to the PATH command that tells DOS where to search for program files (files with a .COM, . EXE, or .BAT file name extension).

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later.

===ASSIGN===

The command redirects requests for disk operations on one drive to a different drive. It can also display drive assignments or reset all drive letters to their original assignments.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3 through 5 and IBM PC DOS releases 2 through 5.

=== ATMDM ===
Lists connections and addresses seen by Windows ATM call manager.

===ATTRIB===

Attrib changes or views the attributes of one or more files. It defaults to display the attributes of all files in the current directory. The file attributes available include read-only, archive, system, and hidden attributes. The command has the capability to process whole folders and subfolders of files and also process all files.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3 and later.

===BACKUP and RESTORE===
These are commands to backup and restore files from an external disk. These appeared in version 2, and continued to PC DOS 5 and MS-DOS 6 (PC DOS 7 had a deversioned check). In DOS 6, these were replaced by commercial programs (CPBACKUP, MSBACKUP), which allowed files to be restored to different locations.

===BASIC and BASICA===
An implementation of the BASIC programming language for PCs. Implementing BASIC in this way was very common in operating systems on 8- and 16-bit machines made in the 1980s.

IBM computers had BASIC 1.1 in ROM, and IBM&#x27;s versions of BASIC used code in this ROM-BASIC, which allowed for extra memory in the code area. BASICA last appeared in IBM PC DOS 5.02, and in OS/2 (2.0 and later), the version had ROM-BASIC moved into the program code.

Microsoft released GW-BASIC for machines with no ROM-BASIC. Some OEM releases had basic.com and basica.com as loaders for GW-BASIC.EXE.

BASIC was dropped after MS-DOS 4, and PC DOS 5.02. OS/2 (which uses PC DOS 5), has it, while MS-DOS 5 does not.

===BREAK===
This command is used to instruct DOS to check whether the and keys have been pressed before carrying out a program request.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

===CALL===

Starts a batch file from within another batch file and returns when that one ends.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.

===CD and CHDIR===
The CHDIR (or the alternative name CD) command either displays or changes the current working directory.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

===CHCP===
The command either displays or changes the active code page used to display character glyphs in a console window. Similar functionality can be achieved with codice_1.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.

===CHKDSK===
CHKDSK verifies a storage volume (for example, a hard disk, disk partition or floppy disk) for file system integrity. The command has the ability to fix errors on a volume and recover information from defective disk sectors of a volume.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.

===CHOICE===
The CHOICE command is used in batch files to prompt the user to select one item from a set of single-character &quot;choices&quot;. Choice was introduced as an external command with MS-DOS 6.0; Novell DOS 7 and PC DOS 7.0. Earlier versions of DR-DOS supported this function with the built-in &quot;switch&quot; command (for numeric choices) or by beginning a command with a question mark. This command was formerly called ync (yes-no-cancel).

===CLS===
The CLS or CLRSCR command clears the terminal screen.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

===COMMAND===
Start a new instance of the command interpreter.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.

===COMP===
Show differences between any two files, or any two sets of files.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 through 5 and IBM PC DOS releases 1 through 5.

===COPY===
Makes copies of existing files.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.

===CTTY===
Defines the terminal device (for example, COM1) to use for input and output.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

===DATE===
Displays the system date and prompts the user to enter a new date. Complements the TIME command.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.

===DBLBOOT===

(Not a command: This is a batch file added to DOS 6.X Supplemental Disks to help create DoubleSpace boot floppies.)

===DBLSPACE===
A disk compression utility supplied with MS-DOS version 6.0 (released in 1993) and version 6.2.

===DEBUG===
A very primitive assembler and disassembler.

===DEFRAG===
The command has the ability to analyze the file fragmentation on a disk drive or to defragment a drive. This command is called DEFRAG in MS-DOS/PC DOS and diskopt in DR-DOS.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later.

===DEL and ERASE===
DEL (or the alternative form ERASE) is used to delete one or more files.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.

===DELTREE===
Deletes a directory along with all of the files and subdirectories that it contains. Normally, it will ask for confirmation of the potentially dangerous action. Since the RD (RMDIR) command can not delete a directory if the directory is not empty (except in Windows NT &amp; 10), the DELTREE command can be used to delete the whole directory.

The codice_2 command is included in certain versions of Microsoft Windows and MS-DOS operating systems. It is specifically available only in versions of MS-DOS 6.0 and higher, and in Microsoft Windows 9x. In Windows NT, the functionality provided exists but is handled by the command or which has slightly different syntax. This command is not present in Windows 7 and 8. In Windows 10, the command switch is or .

===DIR===
The DIR command displays the contents of a directory. The contents comprise the disk&#x27;s volume label and serial number; one directory or filename per line, including the filename extension, the file size in bytes, and the date and time the file was last modified; and the total number of files listed, their cumulative size, and the free space (in bytes) remaining on the disk. The command is one of the few commands that exist from the first versions of DOS. The command can display files in subdirectories. The resulting directory listing can be sorted by various criteria and filenames can be displayed in a chosen format.

===DISKCOMP===
A command for comparing the complete contents of a floppy disk to another one.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later and IBM PC DOS releases 1 and later.

===DISKCOPY===
A command for copying the complete contents of a diskette to another diskette.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

===DOSKEY===
A command that adds command history, macro functionality, and improved editing features to the command-line interpreter.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.

===DOSSIZE===
Displays how much memory various DOS components occupy.

===DRVSPACE===
A disk compression utility supplied with MS-DOS version 6.22.

===ECHO===
The ECHO command prints its own arguments back out to the DOS equivalent of the standard output stream. (Hence the name, ECHO) Usually, this means directly to the screen, but the output of &quot;echo&quot; can be redirected, like any other command, to files or devices. Often used in batch files to print text out to the user.

Another important use of the echo command is to toggle echoing of commands on and off in batch files. Traditionally batch files begin with the codice_3 statement. This says to the interpreter that echoing of commands should be off during the whole execution of the batch file, thus resulting in a &quot;tidier&quot; output (the codice_4 symbol declares that this particular command (echo off) should also be executed without echo.)

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

===EDIT===
EDIT is a full-screen text editor, included with MS-DOS versions 5 and 6, OS/2 and Windows NT to 4.0 The corresponding program in Windows 95 and later, and Windows 2000 and later is Edit v2.0. PC DOS 6 and later use the DOS &quot;E&quot; Editor and DR-DOS used &quot;editor&quot; up to version 7.

===EDLIN===
DOS line-editor. It can be used with a script file, like debug, this makes it of some use even today. The absence of a console editor in MS-DOS/PC DOS 1–4 created an after-market for third-party editors.

In DOS 5, an extra command &quot;?&quot; was added to give the user much-needed help.

DOS 6 was the last version to contain EDLIN; for MS-DOS 6, it&#x27;s on the supplemental disks, while PC DOS 6 had it in the base install. Windows NT 32-bit, and OS/2 have Edlin.

===EMM386===


The EMM386 command enables or disables EMM386 expanded-memory support on a computer with an 80386 or higher processor.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.

=== ERASE ===
See: DEL and ERASE

===EXE2BIN===
Converts an executable (.exe) file into a binary file with the extension .com, which is a memory image of the program.

The size of the resident code and data sections combined in the input .exe file must be less than 64 KB. The file must also have no stack segment.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 through 5. It is available separately for version 6 on the Supplemental Disk.

===EXIT===
Exits the current command processor. If the exit is used at the primary command, it has no effect unless in a DOS window under Microsoft Windows, in which case the window is closed and the user returns to the desktop.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

===EXPAND===
The Microsoft File Expansion Utility is used to uncompress one or more compressed cabinet files (.CAB). The command dates back to 1990 and was supplied on floppy disc for MS-DOS versions 5 and later.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.

===FC===
Show differences between any two files, or any two sets of files.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later – primarily non-IBM releases.

===FDISK===
The FDISK command manipulates hard disk partition tables. The name derives from IBM&#x27;s habit of calling hard drives &quot;fixed disks&quot;. FDISK has the ability to display information about, create, and delete DOS partitions or logical DOS drive. It can also install a standard master boot record on the hard drive.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later and IBM PC DOS 2.0 releases and later.

===FIND===
The FIND command is a filter to find lines in the input data stream that contain or don&#x27;t contain a specified string and send these to the output data stream. It may also be used as a pipe.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

===FINDSTR===
The FINDSTR command is a GREP-oriented &quot;FIND&quot;-like utility. Among its uses is the logical-OR lacking in FIND.

::would find all TXT files with one or more of the above-listed words YES, NO, MAYBE.

===FOR===
Iteration: repeats a command for each out of a specified set of files.
The FOR loop can be used to parse a file or the output of a command.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

===FORMAT===
Deletes the FAT entries and the root directory of the drive/partition, and reformats it for MS-DOS. In most cases, this should only be used on floppy drives or other removable media. This command can potentially erase everything on a computer&#x27;s drive.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.

===GOTO===
The &quot;Goto&quot; command transfers execution to a specified label. Labels are specified at the beginning of a line, with a colon ().

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

Used in Batch files.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later and IBM PC DOS releases 2 and later.

===HELP===
Gives help about DOS commands.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 thru Windows XP. Full-screen command help is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later. Beginning with Windows XP, the command processor &quot;DOS&quot; offers builtin-help for commands by using (e.g. )

===IF===
IF is a conditional statement, that allows branching of the program execution. It evaluates the specified condition, and only if it is true, then it executes the remainder of the command line. Otherwise, it skips the remainder of the line and continues with next command line.

Used in Batch files.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

===INTERSVR and INTERLNK===

In MS-DOS; filelink in DR-DOS.

Network PCs using a null modem cable or LapLink cable. The server-side version of InterLnk, it also immobilizes the machine it&#x27;s running on as it is an active app (As opposed to a terminate-and-stay-resident program) which must be running for any transfer to take place. DR-DOS&#x27; filelink is executed on both the client and server.

New in PC DOS 5.02, MS-DOS 6.0.

===JOIN===
The JOIN command attaches a drive letter to a specified directory on another drive. The opposite can be achieved via the SUBST command.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3 through 5. It is available separately for versions 6.2 and later on the Supplemental Disk.

===KEYB===
The KEYB command is used to select a keyboard layout.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.

From DOS 3.0 through 3.21, there are instead per-country commands, namely KEYBFR, KEYBGR, KEYBIT, KEYBSP and KEYBUK.

===LABEL===
Changes the label on a logical drive, such as a hard disk partition or a floppy disk.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.1 and later and IBM PC DOS releases 3 and later.

===LINK4===
Microsoft 8086 Object Linker

=== LOADFIX ===
Loads a program above the first 64K of memory, and runs the program. The command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later. It is included only in MS-DOS/PC DOS. DR-DOS used memmax, which opened or closed lower, upper, and video memory access, to block the lower 64K of memory.

=== LOADHIGH and LH ===
A command that loads a program into the upper memory area.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.

It is called &quot;hiload&quot; in DR-DOS.

=== MD or MKDIR ===
Makes a new directory. The parent of the directory specified will be created if it does not already exist.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

=== MEM ===
Displays memory usage. It is capable of displaying program size and status, memory in use, and internal drivers. It is an external command.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 4 and later and DR DOS releases 5.0 and later.

On earlier DOS versions the memory usage could be shown by running codice_5. In DR DOS the parameter codice_6 could be used to only show the memory usage.

=== MEMMAKER ===
Starting with version 6, MS-DOS included the external program MemMaker which was used to free system memory (especially Conventional memory) by automatically reconfiguring the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS files. This was usually done by moving TSR programs and device drivers to the upper memory. The whole process required two system restarts. Before the first restart the user was asked whether to enable EMS Memory, since use of expanded memory required a reserved 64KiB region in upper memory. The first restart inserted the SIZER.EXE program which gauged the memory needed by each TSR or Driver. MemMaker would then calculate the optimal Driver and TSR placement in upper memory and modify the AUTOEXEC.BAT and CONFIG.SYS accordingly, and reboot the second time.

MEMMAKER.EXE and SIZER.EXE were developed for Microsoft by Helix Software Company and were eliminated starting in MS-DOS 7 (Windows 95); however, they could be obtained from Microsoft&#x27;s FTP server as part of the OLDDOS.EXE package, alongside other tools.

PC DOS uses another program called RamBoost to optimize memory, working either with PC DOS&#x27;s HIMEM/EMM386 or a third-party memory manager. RamBoost was licensed to IBM by Central Point Software.

=== MIRROR ===
The MIRROR command saves disk storage information that can be used to recover accidentally erased files.

The command is available in MS-DOS version 5. It is available separately for versions 6.2 and later on Supplemental Disk.

=== MODE ===

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later and IBM PC DOS releases 1 and later.

=== MORE ===
The MORE command paginates text, so that one can view files containing more than one screen of text. &quot;More&quot; may also be used as a filter. While viewing MORE text, the return key displays the next line, the space bar displays the next page.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

=== MOVE ===
Moves files or renames directories.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later.

DR-DOS used a separate command for renaming directories, codice_7.

=== MSAV ===
A command that scans the computer for known viruses.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later.

===MSBACKUP===
The MSBACKUP command is used to backup or restore one or more files from one disk to another.

The &quot;New York Times&quot; said that &quot;MSBACKUP&quot; &quot;is much better and faster than the old BACKUP command used in earlier versions of DOS, but it does lack some of the advanced features found in backup software packages that are sold separately. There is another offering, named MWBACKUP, that is GUI-oriented. It was introduced for Windows for Workgroups (3.11).

The MSBACKUP command is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later.

MSCDEX is a driver executable which allows DOS programs to recognize, read, and control CD-ROMs.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later.

===MSD===
The MSD command provides detailed technical information about the computer&#x27;s hardware and software. MSD was new in MS-DOS 6; the PC DOS version of this command is QCONFIG. The command appeared first in Word2, and then in Windows 3.10.

=== MSHERC ===

The MSHERC.COM (also QBHERC.COM) was a TSR graphics driver supplied with Microsoft QuickC, QuickBASIC, and the C Compiler, to allow use of the Hercules adapter high-resolution graphics capability (720 x 348, 2 colors).

=== NLSFUNC ===

Loads extended Nationalization and Localization Support from COUNTRY.SYS, and changed the codepage of drivers and system modules resident in RAM.

In later versions of DR-DOS 6, NLSFUNC relocated itself into the HiMem area, thereby freeing a portion of the nearly invaluable lower 640KiB that constituted the ”conventional” memory available to software.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and later.

===PATH===

Displays or sets a search path for executable files.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

===PAUSE===
Suspends processing of a batch program and displays the message , if not given other text to display.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.

=== PING ===

Allows the user to test the availability of a network connection to a specified host. Hostnames are usually resolved to IP addresses.

It is not included in many DOS versions; typically ones with network stacks will have it as a diagnostic tool.

===POWER===
The POWER command is used to turn power management on and off, report the status of power management, and set levels of power conservation. It is an external command implemented as POWER.EXE.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later.

=== PRINT ===
The PRINT command adds or removes files in the print queue. This command was introduced in MS-DOS version 2. Before that there was no built-in support for background printing files. The user would usually use the copy command to copy files to LPT1.

=== PRINTFIX ===
=== PROMPT ===
The command allows the user to change the prompt in the command screen. The default prompt is (i.e. ), which displays the drive and current path as the prompt, but can be changed to anything. , displays the current system date as the prompt. Type in the cmd screen for help on this function.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later and IBM PC DOS releases 2.1 and later.

===PS===
A utility inspired by the UNIX/XENIX ps command. It also provides a full-screen mode, similar to the top utility on UNIX systems.

=== QBASIC ===
An integrated development environment and BASIC interpreter.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.

=== RD or RMDIR ===
Remove a directory (delete a directory); by default the directories must be empty of files for the command to succeed.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

The deltree command in some versions of MS-DOS and all versions of Windows 9x removes non-empty directories.

=== RECOVER ===
A primitive filesystem error recovery utility included in MS-DOS / IBM PC DOS.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 through 5.

=== REM ===
Remark (comment) command, normally used within a batch file, and for DR-DOS, PC/MS-DOS 6 and above, in CONFIG.SYS. This command is processed by the command processor. Thus, its output can be redirected to create a zero-byte file. REM is useful in logged sessions or screen-captures. One might add comments by way of labels, usually starting with double-colon (::). These are not processed by the command processor.

=== REN ===
The REN command renames a file. Unlike the codice_8 command, this command cannot be used to rename subdirectories, or rename files across drives. Mass renames can be accomplished by the use of the wildcards characters asterisk (*) and question mark (?).

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.

=== REPLACE ===
A command that is used to replace one or more existing computer files or add new files to a target directory.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later.

=== RESTORE ===
See: BACKUP and RESTORE

=== SCANDISK ===
Disk diagnostic utility. Scandisk was a replacement for the codice_9 utility, starting with MS-DOS version 6.2 and later. Its primary advantages over codice_9 is that it is more reliable and has the ability to run a surface scan which finds and marks bad clusters on the disk. It also provided mouse point-and-click TUI, allowing for interactive session to complement command-line batch run.
codice_9 had surface scan and bad cluster detection functionality included, and was used again on Windows NT-based operating systems.

=== SELECT ===
The SELECT command formats a disk and installs country-specific information and keyboard codes.
It was initially only available with IBM PC DOS. The version included with PC DOS 3.0 and 3.1 is hard-coded to transfer the operating system from A: to B:, while from PC DOS 3.2 onward you can specify the source and destination, and can be used to install DOS to the harddisk.

The version included with MS-DOS 4 and PC DOS 4 is no longer a simple command-line utility, but a full-fledged installer.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.3 and 4 and IBM PC DOS releases 3 through 4.

This command is no longer included in DOS Version 5 and later, where it has been replaced by SETUP.

=== SET ===
Sets environment variables.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

cmd.exe in Windows NT 2000, 4DOS, 4OS2, 4NT, and a number of third-party solutions allow direct entry of environment variables from the command prompt. From at least Windows 2000, the codice_12 command allows for the evaluation of strings into variables, thus providing &quot;inter alia&quot; a means of performing integer arithmetic.

=== SETUP ===
The command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.
This command does a computer setup. With all computers running DOS versions 5 and
later, it runs the computer setup, such as Windows 95 setup and Windows 98 setup.

=== SETVER ===
SetVer is a TSR program designed to return a different value to the version of DOS that is running. This allows programs that look for a specific version of DOS to run under a different DOS.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.

=== SHARE ===
Installs support for file sharing and locking capabilities.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3 and later.

=== SHIFT ===
The SHIFT command increases number of replaceable parameters to more than the standard ten for use in batch files.
This is done by changing the position of replaceable parameters. It replaces each of the replacement parameters with the subsequent one (e.g. with , with , etc.).

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

=== SIZER ===
The external command SIZER.EXE is not intended to be started directly from the command prompt. Is used by MemMaker during the memory-optimization process.

=== SMARTDRV ===
The command is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later.

=== SORT ===
A filter to sort lines in the input data stream and send them to the output data stream. Similar to the Unix command codice_13. Handles files up to 64k. This sort is always case insensitive.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

=== SUBST ===
A utility to map a subdirectory to a drive letter. The opposite can be achieved via the JOIN command.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.1 and later.

=== SYS ===
A utility to make a volume bootable. Sys rewrites the Volume Boot Code (the first sector of the partition that SYS is acting on) so that the code, when executed, will look for IO.SYS. SYS also copies the core DOS system files, IO.SYS, MSDOS.SYS, and COMMAND.COM, to the volume. SYS does &quot;not&quot; rewrite the Master Boot Record, contrary to widely held belief.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.

=== TELNET ===
The Telnet Client is a tool for developers and administrators to help manage and test network connectivity.

=== TIME ===
Display the system time and waits for the user to enter a new time. Complements the DATE command.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.

=== TITLE===

Enables a user to change the title of their MS-DOS window.

=== TREE ===

It is an external command, graphically displays the path of each directory and sub-directories on the specified drive.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later and IBM PC DOS releases 2 and later.

=== TRUENAME ===
Internal command that expands the name of a file, directory, or drive, and display its absolute pathname as the result. It will expand relative pathnames, SUBST drives, and &lt;samp&gt;JOIN&lt;/samp&gt; directories, to find the actual directory.
For example, in DOS 7.1, if the current directory is &lt;samp&gt;C:\WINDOWS\SYSTEM&lt;/samp&gt;, then

The argument does not need to refer to an existing file or directory: TRUENAME will output the absolute pathname as if it did. Also TRUENAME does not search in the &lt;samp&gt;PATH&lt;/samp&gt;.
For example, in DOS 5, if the current directory is &lt;samp&gt;C:\TEMP&lt;/samp&gt;, then codice_14 will display &lt;samp&gt;C:\TEMP\COMMAND.COM&lt;/samp&gt; (which does not exist), not &lt;samp&gt;C:\DOS\COMMAND.COM&lt;/samp&gt; (which does and is in the PATH).

This command displays the UNC pathnames of mapped network or local CD drives. This command is an undocumented DOS command. The help switch &quot;/?&quot; defines it as a &quot;Reserved command name&quot;. It is available in MS-DOS version 5.00 and later, including the DOS 7 and 8 in Windows 95/98/ME. The C library function codice_15 performs this function. The Microsoft Windows NT command processors do not support this command, including the versions of command.com for NT.

=== TYPE ===
Displays a file. The codice_16 command is frequently used in conjunction with this command, e.g. codice_17. TYPE can be used to concatenate files (); however this won&#x27;t work for large files—use copy command instead.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 1 and later.

=== UNDELETE ===
Restores file previously deleted with del. By default all recoverable files in the working directory are restored; options are used to change this behavior. If the MS-DOS mirror TSR program is used, then deletion tracking files are created and can be used by undelete.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 5 and later.

=== UNFORMAT ===
MS-DOS version 5 introduced the quick format option (codice_18) which removes the disk&#x27;s file table without deleting any of the data. The same version also introduced the UNFORMAT command to undo the effects of a quick format, restoring the file table and making all the files accessible again.

UNFORMAT only works if invoked before any further changes have overwritten the drive&#x27;s contents.

=== VER ===
An internal DOS command, that reports the DOS version presently running, and since MS-DOS 5, whether DOS is loaded high.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

=== VERIFY ===
Enables or disables the feature to determine if files have been correctly written to disk (You can enable the verify command by typing &quot;verify on&quot; on Command Prompt and pressing enter. To display the current VERIFY setting, type VERIFY without a parameter. To turn off the feature, type &quot;verify off&quot;). If no parameter is provided, the command will display the current setting.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

=== VOL ===
An internal command that displays the disk volume label and serial number.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 2 and later.

=== VSAFE ===
A TSR program that continuously monitors the computer for viruses.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 6 and later.

=== XCOPY ===
Copy entire directory trees. Xcopy is a version of the copy command that can move files and directories from one location to another.

XCOPY usage and attributes can be obtained by typing in the DOS Command line.

The command is available in MS-DOS versions 3.2 and later.

<text>Cherokee or Tsalagi (, ) is an endangered-to-moribund Iroquoian language and the native language of the Cherokee people. &quot;Ethnologue&quot; states that there were 1,520 Cherokee speakers out of 376,000 Cherokees in 2018, while a tally by the three Cherokee tribes in 2019 recorded about 2,100 speakers. The number of speakers is in decline. The &quot;Tahlequah Daily Press&quot; reported in 2019 that most speakers are elderly, about eight fluent speakers die each month, and that only five people under the age of 50 are fluent. The dialect of Cherokee in Oklahoma is &quot;definitely endangered&quot;, and the one in North Carolina is &quot;severely endangered&quot; according to UNESCO. The Lower dialect, formerly spoken on the South Carolina–Georgia border, has been extinct since about 1900. The dire situation regarding the future of the two remaining dialects prompted the Tri-Council of Cherokee tribes to declare a state of emergency in June 2019, with a call to enhance revitalization efforts.

Around 200 speakers of the Eastern (also referred to as the Middle or Kituwah) dialect remain in North Carolina, and language preservation efforts include the New Kituwah Academy, a bilingual immersion school. The largest remaining group of Cherokee speakers is centered around Tahlequah, Oklahoma, where the Western (Overhill or Otali) dialect predominates. The Cherokee Immersion School () in Tahlequah serves children in federally recognized tribes from pre-school up to grade 6.

Cherokee, a polysynthetic language, is also the only member of the Southern Iroquoian family, and it uses a unique syllabary writing system. As a polysynthetic language, Cherokee differs dramatically from Indo-European languages such as English, French, Spanish, or Portuguese, and as such can be difficult for adult learners to acquire. A single Cherokee word can convey ideas that would require multiple English words to express, from the context of the assertion and connotations about the speaker to the idea&#x27;s action and its object. The morphological complexity of the Cherokee language is best exhibited in verbs, which comprise approximately 75% of the language, as opposed to only 25% of the English language. Verbs must contain at minimum a pronominal prefix, a verb root, an aspect suffix, and a modal suffix.

Extensive documentation of the language exists, as it is the indigenous language of North America in which the most literature has been published. Such publications include a Cherokee dictionary and grammar, as well as several editions of the New Testament and Psalms of the Bible and the &quot;Cherokee Phoenix&quot; (, ), the first newspaper published by Native Americans in the United States and the first published in a Native American language.

== Classification ==
Cherokee is an Iroquoian language, and the only Southern Iroquoian language spoken today. Linguists believe that the Cherokee people migrated to the southeast from the Great Lakes region about three thousand years ago, bringing with them their language. Despite the three-thousand-year geographic separation, the Cherokee language today still shows some similarities to the languages spoken around the Great Lakes, such as Mohawk, Onondaga, Seneca, and Tuscarora.

Some researchers (such as Thomas Whyte) have suggested the homeland of the proto-Iroquoian language resides in Appalachia. Whyte contends, based on linguistic and molecular studies, that proto-Iroquoian speakers participated in cultural and economic exchanges along the north–south axis of the Appalachian Mountains. The divergence of Southern Iroquoian (which Cherokee is the only known branch of) from the Northern Iroquoian languages occurred approximately 4,000–3,000 years ago as Late Archaic proto-Iroquoian speaking peoples became more sedentary with the advent of horticulture, advancement of lithic technologies and the emergence of social complexity in the Eastern Woodlands. In the subsequent millennia, the Northern Iroquoian and Southern Iroquoian would be separated by various Algonquin and Siouan speaking peoples as linguistic, religious, social and technological practices from the Algonquin to the north and east and the Siouans to the west from the Ohio Valley would come to be practiced by peoples in the Chesapeake region, as well as parts of the Carolinas.

== History ==


===Literacy===

Before the development of the Cherokee syllabary in the 1820s, Cherokee was an oral language only. The Cherokee syllabary is a set of written symbols invented by Sequoyah in the late 1810s and early 1820s to write the Cherokee language. His creation of the syllabary is particularly noteworthy in that he could not previously read any script. Sequoyah had some contact with English literacy and the Roman alphabet through his proximity to Fort Loudoun, where he engaged in trade with Europeans. He was exposed to English literacy through his white father. His limited understanding of the Latin alphabet, including the ability to recognize the letters of his name, may have aided him in the creation of the Cherokee syllabary. When developing the written language, Sequoyah first experimented with logograms, but his system later developed into a syllabary. In his system, each symbol represents a syllable rather than a single phoneme; the 85 (originally 86) characters in the Cherokee syllabary provide a suitable method to write Cherokee. Some typeface syllables do resemble the Latin, Greek, and even the Cyrillic scripts&#x27; letters, but the sounds are completely different (for example, the sound is written with a letter that resembles Latin D).

Around 1809, Sequoyah began work to create a system of writing for the Cherokee language. At first he sought to create a character for each word in the language. He spent a year on this effort, leaving his fields unplanted, so that his friends and neighbors thought he had lost his mind. His wife is said to have burned his initial work, believing it to be witchcraft. He finally realized that this approach was impractical because it would require too many pictures to be remembered. He then tried making a symbol for every idea, but this also caused too many problems to be practical.

Sequoyah did not succeed until he gave up trying to represent entire words and developed a written symbol for each syllable in the language. After approximately a month, he had a system of 86 characters. &quot;In their present form [of typeface syllabary, not the original handwritten syllabary], many of the syllabary characters resemble Roman, Cyrillic, or Greek letters, or Arabic numerals,&quot; says Janine Scancarelli, a scholar of Cherokee writing, &quot;but there is no apparent relationship between their sounds in other languages and in Cherokee.&quot;

Unable to find adults willing to learn the syllabary, he taught it to his daughter, Ayokeh (also spelled Ayoka). Langguth says she was only six years old at the time. He traveled to the Indian Reserves in the Arkansas Territory where some Cherokees had settled. When he tried to convince the local leaders of the syllabary&#x27;s usefulness, they doubted him, believing that the symbols were merely &quot;ad hoc&quot; reminders. Sequoyah asked each to say a word, which he wrote down, and then called his daughter in to read the words back. This demonstration convinced the leaders to let him teach the syllabary to a few more people. This took several months, during which it was rumored that he might be using the students for sorcery. After completing the lessons, Sequoyah wrote a dictated letter to each student, and read a dictated response. This test convinced the western Cherokees that he had created a practical writing system.

When Sequoyah returned east, he brought a sealed envelope containing a written speech from one of the Arkansas Cherokee leaders. By reading this speech, he convinced the eastern Cherokees also to learn the system, after which it spread rapidly. In 1825 the Cherokee Nation officially adopted the writing system. From 1828 to 1834, American missionaries assisted the Cherokees in using Sequoyah&#x27;s original syllabary to develop typeface syllabary characters and print the &quot;Cherokee Phoenix&quot;, the first newspaper of the Cherokee Nation, with text in both Cherokee and English.

In 1826, the Cherokee National Council commissioned George Lowrey and David Brown to translate and print eight copies of the laws of the Cherokee Nation in the new Cherokee language typeface using Sequoyah&#x27;s system, but not his original self-created handwritten syllable glyphs.

Once Albert Gallatin saw a copy of Sequoyah&#x27;s syllabary, he found the syllabary superior to the English alphabet. Even though a Cherokee student must learn 86 syllables instead of 26 letters, they can read immediately. Students could accomplish in a few weeks what students of English writing could learn in two years.

In 1824, the General Council of the Eastern Cherokees awarded Sequoyah a large silver medal in honor of the syllabary. According to Davis, one side of the medal bore his image surrounded by the inscription in English, &quot;Presented to George Gist by the General Council of the Cherokee for his ingenuity in the invention of the Cherokee Alphabet.&quot; The reverse side showed two long-stemmed pipes and the same inscription written in Cherokee. Supposedly, Sequoyah wore the medal throughout the rest of his life, and it was buried with him.

By 1825, the Bible and numerous religious hymns and pamphlets, educational materials, legal documents, and books were translated into the Cherokee language. Thousands of Cherokees became literate and the literacy rate for Cherokees in the original syllabary, as well as the typefaced syllabary, was higher in the Cherokee Nation than that of literacy of whites in the English alphabet in the United States.

Though use of the Cherokee syllabary declined after many of the Cherokees were forcibly removed to Indian Territory, present-day Oklahoma, it has survived in private correspondence, renderings of the Bible, and descriptions of Indian medicine and now can be found in books and on the internet among other places.

In February 2022, Motorola Mobility introduced a Cherokee language interface for its latest smartphone. Eastern Band Principal Chief Richard Sneed, who along with other Cherokee leaders worked with Motorola on the development, considered this an effort to preserve the language. Features included not only symbols but also the culture.

== Geographic distribution ==
The language remains concentrated in some Oklahoma communities and communities like Big Cove and Snowbird in North Carolina.

=== Dialects ===

At the time of European contact, there were three major dialects of Cherokee: Lower, Middle, and Overhill. The Lower dialect, formerly spoken on the South Carolina-Georgia border, has been extinct since about 1900. Of the remaining two dialects, the Middle dialect (Kituwah) is spoken by the Eastern Band on the Qualla Boundary, and retains ~200 speakers. The Overhill, or Western, dialect is spoken in eastern Oklahoma and by the Snowbird Community in North Carolina by ~1,300 people. The Western dialect is most widely used and is considered the main dialect of the language. Both dialects have had English influence, with the Overhill, or Western dialect showing some Spanish influence as well.

The now extinct Lower dialect spoken by the inhabitants of the Lower Towns in the vicinity of the South Carolina–Georgia border had &quot;r&quot; as the liquid consonant in its inventory, while both the contemporary Kituhwa dialect spoken in North Carolina and the Overhill dialect contain &quot;l&quot;.

=== Language drift ===
There are two main dialects of Cherokee spoken by modern speakers. The Giduwa (or Kituwah) dialect (Eastern Band) and the Otali dialect (also called the Overhill dialect) spoken in Oklahoma. The Otali dialect has drifted significantly from Sequoyah&#x27;s syllabary in the past 150 years, and many contracted and borrowed words have been adopted into the language. These noun and verb roots in Cherokee, however, can still be mapped to Sequoyah&#x27;s syllabary. There are more than 85 syllables in use by modern Cherokee speakers.

== Status and preservation efforts ==
In 2019, the Tri-Council of Cherokee tribes declared a state of emergency for the language due to the threat of it going extinct, calling for the enhancement of revitalization programs. The language retains about 1,500 to 2,100 Cherokee speakers, but an average of eight fluent speakers die each month, and only a handful of people under 40 years of age are fluent as of 2019. In 1986, the literacy rate for first language speakers was 15–20% who could read and 5% who could write, according to the 1986 Cherokee Heritage Center. A 2005 survey determined that the Eastern Band had 460 fluent speakers. Ten years later, the number was believed to be 200.
Cherokee is &quot;definitely endangered&quot; in Oklahoma and &quot;severely endangered&quot; in North Carolina according to UNESCO. Cherokee has been the co-official language of the Cherokee Nation alongside English since a 1991 legislation officially proclaimed this under the Act Relating to the Tribal Policy for the Promotion and Preservation of Cherokee Language, History, and Culture. Cherokee is also recognized as the official language of the United Keetoowah Band of Cherokee Indians. As Cherokee is official, the entire constitution of the United Keetoowah Band is available in both English and Cherokee. As an official language, any tribal member may communicate with the tribal government in Cherokee or English, English translation services are provided for Cherokee speakers, and both Cherokee and English are used when the tribe provides services, resources, and information to tribal members or when communicating with the tribal council. The 1991 legislation allows the political branch of the nation to maintain Cherokee as a living language. Because they are within the Cherokee Nation tribal jurisdiction area, hospitals and health centers such as the Three Rivers Health Center in Muscogee, Oklahoma provide Cherokee language translation services.

=== Education ===
In 2008 the Cherokee Nation initiated a ten-year language preservation plan that involved growing new fluent speakers of the Cherokee language from childhood on up through school immersion programs, as well as a collaborative community effort to continue to use the language at home. This plan was part of an ambitious goal that in 50 years, 80 percent or more of the Cherokee people will be fluent in the language. The Cherokee Preservation Foundation has invested $4.5 million into opening schools, training teachers, and developing curricula for language education, as well as initiating community gatherings where the language can be actively used. They have accomplished: &quot;Curriculum development, teaching materials and teacher training for a total immersion program for children, beginning when they are preschoolers, that enables them to learn Cherokee as their first language. The participating children and their parents learn to speak and read together. The Tribe operates the Kituwah Academy&quot;. Formed in 2006, the Kituwah Preservation &amp; Education Program (KPEP) on the Qualla Boundary focuses on language immersion programs for children from birth to fifth grade, developing cultural resources for the general public and community language programs to foster the Cherokee language among adults.

There is also a Cherokee language immersion school in Tahlequah, Oklahoma that educates students from pre-school through eighth grade. A second campus was added in November 2021, when the school purchased Greasy School in Greasy, Oklahoma, located in southern Adair County ten miles south of Stilwell. Situated in the largest area of Cherokee speakers in the world, the opportunity for that campus is for students to spend the day in an immersion school and then return to a Cherokee-speaking home.

Several universities offer Cherokee as a second language, including the University of Oklahoma, Northeastern State University, and Western Carolina University. Western Carolina University (WCU) has partnered with the Eastern Band of Cherokee Indians (EBCI) to promote and restore the language through the school&#x27;s Cherokee Studies program, which offers classes in and about the language and culture of the Cherokee Indians. WCU and the EBCI have initiated a ten-year language revitalization plan consisting of: (1) a continuation of the improvement and expansion of the EBCI Atse Kituwah Cherokee Language Immersion School, (2) continued development of Cherokee language learning resources, and (3) building of Western Carolina University programs to offer a more comprehensive language training curriculum.

In November 2022, the tribe opened a $20 million language center in a 52,000-square-foot building near its headquarters in Tahlequah. The immersion facility, which has classes for youth to adults, features no English signage: even the exit signs feature a pictograph of a person running for the door rather than the English word.

The Cherokee Nation has created language lessons on the online learning platform Memrise which contain &quot;around 1,000 Cherokee words and phrases&quot;.

== Phonology ==
The family of Iroquoian languages has a unique phonological inventory. Unlike most languages, the Cherokee inventory of consonants lacks the labial sounds and . It also lacks and . Cherokee does, however, have one labial consonant, , but it is rare, appearing in no more than ten native words. In fact, the Lower dialect does not produce at all. Instead, it uses .

In the case of , is often substituted, as in the name of the Cherokee Wikipedia, . Some words may contain sounds not reflected in the given phonology: for instance, the modern Oklahoma use of the loanword &quot;automobile&quot;, with the and sounds of English.

=== Consonants ===
As with many Iroquoian languages, Cherokee&#x27;s phonemic inventory is small. The consonants for North Carolina Cherokee are given in the table below. The consonants of all Iroquoian languages pattern so that they may be grouped as (oral) obstruents, sibilants, laryngeals, and resonants.

==== Notes ====
* The stops and affricates are voiced in the beginning of syllables and between vowels: . Before , they surface as aspirated stops: , except which surfaces as a plain voiceless affricate or fricative in some Oklahoma Cherokee speakers. These aspirated allophones are felt as separate phonemes by native speakers and are often reflected as such in the orthographies (in romanization or syllabary).
* is palatalized as (voiced allophones: ) in the Oklahoma dialects, but before + obstruent after vowel deletion: becomes .
* has merged with in most North Carolina dialects.
* (the voiced allophone of ) can also be lenited to , and (the voiced allophone of ) to .
* The sonorants are devoiced when preceding or following , with varying degrees of allophony: .
* is the only true labial. It occurs only in a dozen native words and is not reconstructed for Proto-Iroquoian.
* is realized as or even in North Carolina dialects. After a short vowel, is always preceded by a faint , generally not spelled in the romanized orthographies.
* and , including the pre-aspiration mentioned above, participate in complex rules of laryngeal and tonal alternations, often surfacing as various tones instead. Ex: &gt; &quot;use it!&quot; but &gt; &quot;I am using it&quot; with a low falling tone; &gt; &quot;you&#x27;re heading there&quot; but &gt; &quot;I am heading there&quot; with a falling tone.

==== Orthography ====
There are two main competing orthographies, depending on how plain and aspirated stops (including affricates) are represented:
* In the &quot;d/t system&quot;, plain stops are represented by English voiced stops (&quot;d, g, gw, j, dl&quot;) and aspirated stops by English voiceless stops (&quot;t, k, kw, c, tl&quot;). This orthography is favored by native speakers.
* In the &quot;t/th system&quot;, plain stops are represented by voiceless stops instead, and aspirated stops by sequences of voiceless stops + &quot;h&quot; (&quot;th, kh, khw/kwh, ch, thl/tlh&quot;). This orthography is favored by linguists.

Another orthography, used in Holmes (1977), doesn&#x27;t distinguish plain stops from aspirated stops for and and uses &quot;ts&quot; and &quot;qu&quot; for both modes. Spellings working from the syllabary rather than from the sounds often behave similarly, and being the only two stop series not having separate letters for plain and aspirated before any vowel in Sequoyah script. Ex: , .

=== Vowels ===
There are six short vowels and six long vowels in the Cherokee inventory. As with all Iroquoian languages, this includes a nasalized vowel. In the case of Cherokee, the nasalized vowel is a mid central vowel usually represented as &quot;v&quot; and is pronounced , that is as a schwa vowel like the unstressed &quot;a&quot; in the English word &quot;comma&quot; plus the nasalization. It is similar to the nasalized vowel in the French word &quot;un&quot; which means &quot;one&quot;.

 is weakly rounded and often realized as .

Word-final vowels are short and nasalized, and receive an automatic high or high-falling tone: &#x27;thank you&#x27;. They are often dropped in casual speech: &#x27;dirt&#x27;. When deletion happens, trailing and are also deleted and any resulting long vowel is further shortened: becomes &#x27;he saw it&#x27;.

Short vowels are devoiced before : . But due to the phonological rules of vowel deletion, laryngeal metathesis and laryngeal alternation (see below), this environment is relatively rare.

Sequences of two non-identical vowels are disallowed and the vowel clash must be resolved. There are four strategies depending on the phonological and morphological environments:
# the first vowel is kept: becomes &#x27;he wants&#x27;,
# the second vowel is kept: becomes &#x27;you&#x27;re going&#x27;,
# an epenthetic consonant is inserted: becomes ,
# they merge into a different vowel or tone quality.

These make the identification of each individual morpheme often a difficult task:

=== Tone ===
Cherokee distinguishes six pitch patterns or tones, using four pitch levels. Two tones are level (low, high) and appear on short or long vowels. The other four are contour tones (rising, falling, lowfall, highrise) and appear on long vowels only.

There is no academic consensus on the notation of tone and length, although in 2011 a project began to document the use of tones in Cherokee to improve language instruction. Below are the main conventions, along with the standardized IPA notation.

* The &quot;low tone&quot; is the default, unmarked tone.
* The &quot;high tone&quot; is the marked tone. Some sources of high tone apply to the mora, others to the syllable. Complex morphophonological rules govern whether it can spread one mora to the left, to the right or at all. It has both lexical and morphological functions.
* The &quot;rising and falling tones&quot; are secondary tones, i.e. combinations of low and high tones, deriving from moraic high tones and from high tone spread.
* The &quot;lowfall tone&quot; mainly derives from glottal stop deletion after a long vowel, but also has important morphological functions (pronominal lowering, tonic/atonic alternation, laryngeal alternation).
* The &quot;superhigh tone&quot;, also called &quot;highfall&quot; by Montgomery-Anderson, has a distinctive morphosyntactical function, primarily appearing on adjectives, nouns derived from verbs, and on subordinate verbs. It is mobile and falls on the rightmost long vowel. If the final short vowel is dropped and the superhigh tone becomes in word-final position, it is shortened and pronounced like a slightly higher final tone (notated as &quot;a̋&quot; in most orthographies). There can only be one superhigh tone per word, constraint not shared by the other tones. For these reasons, this contour exhibits some accentual properties and has been referred to as an accent (or stress) in the literature.

While the tonal system is undergoing a gradual simplification in many areas, it remains important in meaning and is still held strongly by many, especially older, speakers. The syllabary displays neither tone nor vowel length, but as stated earlier regarding the paucity of minimal pairs, real cases of ambiguity are rare. The same goes for transliterated Cherokee ( for , for , etc.), which is rarely written with any tone markers, except in dictionaries. Native speakers can tell the difference between written words based solely on context.

== Grammar ==

Cherokee, like many Native American languages, is polysynthetic, meaning that many morphemes may be linked together to form a single word, which may be of great length. Cherokee verbs must contain at a minimum a pronominal prefix, a verb root, an aspect suffix, and a modal suffix, for a total of 17 verb tenses. They can also bear prepronominal prefixes, reflexive prefixes, and derivational suffixes. Given all possible combinations of affixes, each regular verb can have 21,262 inflected forms.

For example, the verb form , &#x27;I am going&#x27;, has each of these elements:

The pronominal prefix is , which indicates first person singular. The verb root is , &#x27;to go.&#x27; The aspect suffix that this verb employs for the present-tense stem is . The present-tense modal suffix for regular verbs in Cherokee is .

Cherokee makes three number distinctions on pronouns: singular, dual and plural. It does not make gender distinction, but does distinguish animacy in third person pronouns. Cherokee also makes the distinction between inclusive and exclusive pronouns in the first person dual and plural. There is no distinction between dual and plural in the 3rd person. This makes a total of 10 persons.

The following is the conjugation of this verb form in all 10 persons.

The translation uses the present progressive (&#x27;at this time I am going&#x27;). Cherokee differentiates between progressive (&#x27;I am going&#x27;) and habitual (&#x27;I go&#x27;) more than English does. For the habitual, the aspectual prefix is &quot;imperfective&quot; or &quot;incompletive&quot; (here identical to present, but can vary for other verbs) and the modal prefix &quot;habitual&quot;.

=== Pronouns and pronominal prefixes ===
Like many Native American languages, Cherokee has many pronominal prefixes that can index both subject and object. Pronominal prefixes always appear on verbs and can also appear on adjectives and nouns. There are two separate words which function as pronouns: &#x27;I, me&#x27; and &#x27;you&#x27;.

=== Compound pronouns ===
A Cherokee pronoun&#x27;s number marks not only the agent of a verb, but often the object as well. This is the case if the depending object was already mentioned and would be substituted by a separate pronoun in English as well. Contrary to English, animacy is marked but gender is not.

(These suffixes have to be treated in a CV syllabary structure.) Set I and II join here except if written &quot;A&quot; | &quot;B&quot;.
Some prefixes are the same, even though they mean their opposite. Understanding is ensured by regular stem changes within the verb.

=== Shape classifiers in verbs ===
Some Cherokee verbs require special classifiers which denote a physical property of the direct object. Only around 20 common verbs require one of these classifiers (such as the equivalent of &#x27;hold&#x27;). The classifiers can be grouped into five categories:

* Live
* Flexible (most common)
* Long (narrow, not flexible)
* Indefinite (solid, heavy relative to size), also used as default category
* Liquid (or container of)

Example:
There have been reports that the youngest speakers of Cherokee are using only the indefinite forms, suggesting a decline in usage or full acquisition of the system of shape classification. Cherokee is the only Iroquoian language with this type of classificatory verb system, leading linguists to reanalyze it as a potential remnant of a noun incorporation system in Proto-Iroquoian. However, given the non-productive nature of noun incorporation in Cherokee, other linguists have suggested that classificatory verbs are the product of historical contact between Cherokee and non-Iroquoian languages, and instead that the noun incorporation system in Northern Iroquoian languages developed later.

=== Word order ===
All orderings between subjects, verbs, and objects are possible in Cherokee sentences, but word order preferences are influenced by a number of factors. Some preferences are determined by information structure; items that express contrast with alternatives generally precede other arguments, and items that express new information typically precede those that refer to entities already in the conversation. Word order is also influenced by thematic role, such that agent arguments of transitive sentences (subjects) typically precede theme arguments (objects). Verbs typically occur either at the end of the sentence or followed by exactly one phrase; it is highly uncommon to find two phrases following the verb in a single sentence. In copular sentences, the subject complement must precede the copular verb. Negative sentences have a different word order.

Within the nominal expression, some relative orders are fixed, while others are flexible. Demonstratives, such as (&#x27;that&#x27;) or (&#x27;this&#x27;), occur at the beginning of noun phrases. Numerals follow demonstratives, and precede both nouns and adjectives. Adjectives may either precede or follow nouns. Relative clauses follow the nouns that they modify. Adverbs precede the verbs that they are modifying. For example, &#x27;she&#x27;s speaking loudly&#x27; is (literally, &#x27;loud she&#x27;s-speaking&#x27;).

In affirmative present tense sentences, no verb is required to express a copular, predicative relationship between two noun phrases. In such a case, word order is flexible. For example, (&#x27;that man is my father&#x27;). Adjectives can also be used predicatively with a noun phrase subject, as in (&#x27;my father is big&#x27;).

== Orthography ==

Cherokee is written in an 85-character syllabary invented by Sequoyah (also known as Guest or George Gist). Many of the letters resemble the Latin letters they derive from, but have completely unrelated sound values; Sequoyah had seen English, Hebrew, and Greek writing but did not know how to read them.

Two other scripts used to write Cherokee are a simple Latin transliteration and a more precise system with Diacritical marks.

=== Description ===
Each of the characters represents one syllable, as in the Japanese &quot;kana&quot; and the Bronze Age Greek Linear B writing systems. The first six characters represent isolated vowel syllables. Characters for combined consonant and vowel syllables then follow. It is recited from left to right, top to bottom.

The charts below show the syllabary as arranged by Samuel Worcester along with his commonly used transliterations. He played a key role in the development of Cherokee printing from 1828 until his death in 1859.

==== Notes ====
# In the chart, &#x27;v&#x27; represents a nasal vowel, .
# The character Ꮩ &quot;do&quot; is shown upside-down in some fonts.

The transliteration working from the syllabary uses conventional consonants like &quot;qu&quot; and &quot;ts&quot;, and may differ from the ones used in the phonological orthographies (first column in the below chart, in the d/t system).

The phonetic values of these characters do not equate directly to those represented by the letters of the Latin script. Some characters represent two distinct phonetic values (actually heard as different syllables), while others often represent different forms of the same syllable. Not all phonemic distinctions of the spoken language are represented:
* Aspirated consonants are generally not distinguished from their plain counterpart. For example, while + vowel syllables are mostly differentiated from + vowel by use of different glyphs, syllables beginning with are all conflated with those beginning with . 
* Long vowels are not distinguished from short vowels. However, in more recent technical literature, length of vowels can actually be indicated using a colon, and other disambiguation methods for consonants (somewhat like the Japanese dakuten) have been suggested.
* Tones are not marked. 
* Syllables ending in vowels, &quot;h,&quot; or glottal stop are undifferentiated. For example, the single symbol Ꮡ is used to represent both &quot;suú&quot; as in , meaning &#x27;six&#x27; (), and &quot;súh&quot; as in , meaning &#x27;fishhook&#x27; ().
* There is no regular rule for representing consonant clusters. When consonants other than &quot;s, h,&quot; or glottal stop arise in clusters with other consonants, a vowel must be inserted, chosen either arbitrarily or for etymological reasons (reflecting an underlying etymological vowel, see vowel deletion for instance). For example, () represents the word , meaning &#x27;small (pl.), babies&#x27;. The consonant cluster &quot;ns&quot; is broken down by insertion of the vowel &quot;a&quot;, and is spelled as . The vowel is etymological as is composed of the morphemes (), where &quot;a&quot; is part of the root. The vowel is included in the transliteration, but is not pronounced.

As with some other underspecified writing systems, such as Arabic, adult speakers can distinguish words by context.

=== Unicode ===
Cherokee was added to the Unicode Standard in September 1999 with the release of version 3.0.

==== Blocks ====
The main Unicode block for Cherokee is U+13A0–U+13FF. It contains the script&#x27;s upper-case syllables as well as six lower-case syllables:
The rest of the lower-case syllables are encoded at U+AB70–ABBF:
==== Fonts and digital platform support ====
A single Cherokee Unicode font, Plantagenet Cherokee, is supplied with macOS, version 10.3 (Panther) and later. Windows Vista also includes a Cherokee font. Several free Cherokee fonts are available including Digohweli, Donisiladv, and Noto Sans Cherokee. Some pan-Unicode fonts, such as Code2000, Everson Mono, and GNU FreeFont, include Cherokee characters. A commercial font, Phoreus Cherokee, published by TypeCulture, includes multiple weights and styles. The Cherokee Nation Language Technology Program supports &quot;innovative solutions for the Cherokee language on all digital platforms including smartphones, laptops, desktops, tablets and social networks.&quot;

== Vocabulary ==

=== Numbers ===
Cherokee uses Arabic numerals (0–9). The Cherokee council voted not to adopt Sequoyah&#x27;s numbering system. Sequoyah created individual symbols for 1–20, 30, 40, 50, 60, 70, 80, 90, and 100 as well as a symbol for three zeros for numbers in the thousands, and a symbol for six zeros for numbers in the millions. These last two symbols, representing &quot;,000&quot; and &quot;,000,000&quot;, are made up of two separate symbols each. They have a symbol in common, which could be used as a zero in itself.

=== Word creation ===
The polysynthetic nature of the Cherokee language enables the language to develop new descriptive words in Cherokee to reflect or express new concepts. Some good examples are (&#x27;, &#x27;he argues repeatedly and on purpose with a purpose&#x27;) corresponding to &#x27;attorney&#x27; and (&#x27;, &#x27;the final catcher&#x27; or &#x27;he catches them finally and conclusively&#x27;) for &#x27;policeman&#x27;.

Other words have been adopted from another language such as the English word &quot;gasoline&quot;, which in Cherokee is (&#x27;). Other words were adopted from the languages of tribes who settled in Oklahoma in the early 1900s. One interesting and humorous example is the name of Nowata, Oklahoma, deriving from , a Delaware word for &#x27;welcome&#x27; (more precisely the Delaware word is which can mean &#x27;welcome&#x27; or &#x27;friend&#x27; in the Delaware languages). The white settlers of the area used the name for the township, and local Cherokee, being unaware that the word had its origins in the Delaware language, called the town (&#x27;) which means &#x27;the water is all gone gone from here&#x27; — i.e. &#x27;no water&#x27;.

Other examples of adopted words are (&#x27;) for &#x27;coffee&#x27; and (&#x27;) for &#x27;watch&#x27;; which led to (, &#x27;big watch&#x27;) for &quot;clock&quot;.

Meaning expansion can be illustrated by the words for &#x27;warm&#x27; and &#x27;cold&#x27;, which can be also extended to mean &#x27;south&#x27; and &#x27;north&#x27;. Around the time of the American Civil War, they were further extended to US party labels, Democratic and Republican, respectively.

<text>Skive Municipality () is a municipality (Danish, &quot;kommune&quot;) in Mid Jutland Region on Salling Peninsula, a part of the larger Jutland Peninsula in northwest Denmark. It covers an area of 688.09 km2 (2013) and has a population of 44,739 (2024). Its mayor is Peder Christian Kirkegaard, a member of the Venstre political party.

The main town and the site of its municipal council is the city of Skive.

The Virksund Bridge (&quot;Virksundbroen&quot;) connects the municipality at the town of Virksund to the town of Sundstrup in Viborg municipality.

As of January 1, 2007, the original Skive municipality ceased to exist as a result of &quot;Kommunalreformen&quot; (&quot;The Municipal Reform&quot; of 2007). It was merged with the former Sallingsund, Spøttrup, and Sundsøre municipalities, to form the new Skive municipality. The old municipality had an area of 230 km2 and a population of 27,919 (2005). Before the reform, the municipality was part of Viborg County.

Skive itself is a coastal tourist resort, at the mouth of the Karup River (&quot;Karup Å&quot;) and the Skive Fjord. As of 1992, the population was 19,711. In June 2022, Barack Obama visited the municipality.

===Municipal council===
Skive&#x27;s municipal council consists of 27 members, elected every four years.

Below are the municipal councils elected since the Municipal Reform of 2007.

==Attractions==
* The 14th century Spøttrup Castle underwent extensive repairs in the 1940s and opened as a museum and medicinal herb garden.
* Skive Art Museum (&quot;Skive Kunstmuseum&quot;) is housed in a building designed by Danish architect Leopold Teschl, who also designed the Skive Historical Museum. The art museum houses a broad collection of modern Danish art with special interest in expressive landscapes and New Realism painting. Also, the collection includes works by local artists, including Christen Dalsgaard, national romantic painter associated with the Golden Age of Danish Painting.
* The Fur Museum is located on the island of Fur, part of the Skive municipality. It features exhibits relating to the island of Fur, particularly fossils.
* The Mønsted Limestone Caves south-west of the town of Skive are run by Denmark&#x27;s nature-preservation group, &quot;Skov- og Naturstyrelse&quot;. As well as being a tourist attraction, the caves are used as a place to age cheese, which is then exported to Germany as &quot;cavecheese&quot;. In winter, the caves are home to 10,000 bats.

<doc id="356375" wikidata="Q34311" url="?curid=356375" title="Yoruba language">
<text>Yoruba (, ; ) is a Niger-Congo language that is spoken in West Africa, primarily in Southwestern and Central Nigeria, Benin, and parts of Togo. It is spoken by the Yoruba people. Yoruba speakers number roughly 47 million, including around 2 million second-language or L2 speakers (as of 2005). As a pluricentric language, it is primarily spoken in a dialectal area spanning Nigeria, Benin, and Togo with smaller migrated communities in Côte d&#x27;Ivoire, Sierra Leone and The Gambia.

Yoruba vocabulary is also used in African diaspora religions such as the Afro-Brazilian religion of Candomblé, the Caribbean religion of Santería in the form of the liturgical Lucumí language, and various Afro-American religions of North America. Most modern practitioners of these religions in the Americas are not fluent in the Yoruba language, yet they still use Yoruba words and phrases for songs or chants—rooted in cultural traditions. For such practitioners, the Yoruba lexicon is especially common for ritual purposes, and these modern manifestations have taken new forms that do not depend on vernacular fluency.

As the principal Yoruboid language, Yoruba is most closely related to these languages Itsekiri (spoken in the Niger Delta) and Igala (spoken in central Nigeria).

== History ==

Yoruba is classified among the Edekiri languages, which together with Itsekiri and the isolate Igala form the Yoruboid group of languages within the Volta–Niger branch of the Niger–Congo family. 
The linguistic unity of the Niger–Congo family dates to deep pre-history, with estimates ranging around 11,000 years ago (the end of the Upper Paleolithic). In present-day Nigeria, it is estimated that there are around 50 million Yoruba primary and secondary language speakers, as well as several other millions of speakers outside Nigeria, making it the most widely spoken African language outside of the continent. There is a substantial body of literature in the Yoruba language, including books, newspapers, and pamphlets. Yoruba is used in radio and television broadcasting and is taught at primary, secondary, and tertiary levels.

== Varieties ==
The Yoruba dialect continuum consists of several dialects. The various Yoruba dialects in Yorubaland can be classified into five major dialect areas: Northwest, Northeast, Central, Southwest, and Southeast. Clear boundaries cannot be drawn, but peripheral areas of dialectal regions often have some similarities to adjoining dialects.

* North-West Yoruba (NWY)
** Egba, Ibadan, Ọyọ, Lagos (Eko), Onko, Ibarapa
* North-East Yoruba (NEY)
**Yagba, Owe, Ikiri, Ijumu, Oworo, Gbede, Abunu.
* Central Yoruba (CY)
** Igbomina, Ijesha, Ifẹ, Ekiti (including Akurẹ), Ẹfọn, Western Akoko.
* South-West Yoruba (SWY)
** Ketu, Awori, Sakété, Ifè (Togo), Idasha, Anago.
* South-East Yoruba (SEY)
** Ondo, Ọwọ, Remo, Ijẹbu, Ikale, Eastern Akoko (Akoko, Ào), Ilaje, Usẹn.
North-West Yoruba was historically spoken in the Ọyọ Empire. In NWY dialects, Proto-Yoruba velar fricative and labialized voiced velar /gʷ/ have merged into /w/; the upper vowels /ɪ/ and /ʊ/ were raised and merged with /i/ and /u/, just as their nasal counterparts, resulting in a vowel system with seven oral and three nasal vowels.

South-East Yoruba was most likely associated with the expansion of the Benin Empire after . In contrast to NWY, lineage, and descent are largely multilineal and cognatic, and the division of titles into war and civil is unknown. Linguistically, SEY has retained the /ɣ/ and /gw/ contrast, while it has lowered the nasal vowels /ĩ/ and /ʊ̃/ to /ɛ̃/ and /ɔ̃/, respectively. SEY has collapsed the second and third-person plural pronominal forms; thus, &quot;àn án wá&quot; can mean either &#x27;you (pl.) came&#x27; or &#x27;they came&#x27; in SEY dialects, whereas NWY for example has &quot;ẹ wá&quot; &#x27;you (pl.) came&#x27; and &quot;wọ́n wá&quot; &#x27;they came&#x27;, respectively. The emergence of a plural of respect may have prevented the coalescence of the two in NWY dialects.

Central Yoruba forms a transitional area in that the lexicon has much in common with NWY and shares many ethnographical features with SEY. Its vowel system is the most traditional of the three dialect groups, retaining nine oral-vowel contrasts, six or seven nasal vowels, and an extensive vowel harmony system. Peculiar to Central and Eastern (NEY, SEY) Yoruba also is the ability to begin words with the vowel [ʊ:], which in Western Yoruba has been changed to [ɪ:]

== Literary Yoruba ==

Literary Yoruba, also known as &quot;Standard Yoruba&quot;, &quot;Yoruba koiné&quot;, and &quot;common Yoruba&quot;, is a separate member of the dialect cluster. It is the written form of the language, the standard variety learned at school, and that is spoken by newsreaders on the radio. Standard Yoruba has its origin in the 1850s, when Samuel A. Crowther, the first native African Anglican bishop, published a Yoruba grammar and started his translation of the Bible. Though for a large part based on the Ọyọ and Ibadan dialects, Standard Yoruba incorporates several features from other dialects. It also has some features peculiar to itself, for example, the simplified vowel harmony system, as well as foreign structures, such as calques from English that originated in early translations of religious works.

Because the use of Standard Yoruba did not result from some deliberate linguistic policy, much controversy exists as to what constitutes &#x27;genuine Yoruba&#x27;, with some writers holding the opinion that the Ọyọ dialect is the &quot;pure&quot; form, and others stating that there is no such thing as genuine Yoruba at all. Standard Yoruba, the variety learned at school and used in the media, has nonetheless been a decisive consolidating factor in the emergence of a common Yoruba identity.

== Writing systems ==

The earliest evidence of the presence of Islam and literacy goes back to the 14th century. The earliest documented history of the people, traced to the latter part of the 17th century, was in the Yoruba but in the Arabic script called Ajami. This makes Yoruba one of the oldest African languages with an attested history of Ajami (Cf. Mumin &amp; Versteegh 2014; Hofheinz 2018). However, the oldest extant Yoruba Ajami exemplar is a 19th-century Islamic verse (waka) by Badamasi Agbaji (d. 1895- Hunwick 1995). There are several items of Yoruba Ajami in poetry, personal notes, and esoteric knowledge (Cf. Bang 2019). Nevertheless, Yoruba Ajami remained idiosyncratic and not socially diffused, as no standardized orthography existed. The plethora of dialects and the absence of a central promotional institution, among others, are responsible.

In the 17th century, Yoruba was written in the Ajami script, a form of Arabic script. It is still written in the Ajami writing script in some Islamic circles. Standard Yoruba orthography originated in the early work of Church Mission Society missionaries working among the &quot;Aku&quot; (Yoruba) of Freetown. One of their informants was Crowther, who later would proceed to work on his native language himself. In early grammar primers and translations of portions of the English Bible, Crowther used the Latin alphabet largely without tone markings. The only diacritic used was a dot below certain vowels to signify their open variants and , viz. and . Over the years, the orthography was revised to represent tone, among other things. In 1875, the Church Missionary Society (CMS) organized a conference on Yoruba Orthography; the standard devised there was the basis for the orthography of the steady flow of religious and educational literature over the next seventy years.

The current orthography of Yoruba derives from a 1966 report of the Yoruba Orthography Committee, along with Ayọ Bamgboṣe&#x27;s 1965 &quot;Yoruba Orthography&quot;, a study of the earlier orthographies and an attempt to bring Yoruba orthography in line with actual speech as much as possible. Still similar to the older orthography, it employs the Latin alphabet modified by the use of the digraph and certain diacritics, including the underdots under the letters , , and . Previously, the vertical line had been used to avoid the mark being fully covered by an underline, as in ⟨e̩⟩, ⟨o̩⟩, ⟨s̩⟩; however, that usage is no longer common.

The Latin letters , , , , are not used as part of the official orthography of Standard Yoruba. However, is used in certain Yoruba dialects, like the Ao dialect.

The pronunciation of the letters without diacritics corresponds more or less to their International Phonetic Alphabet equivalents, except for the labial–velar consonant (written ) and (written ), in which both consonants are pronounced simultaneously rather than sequentially. The diacritic underneath vowels indicates an open vowel, pronounced with the root of the tongue retracted (so is pronounced and is ). represents a postalveolar consonant like the English , represents a palatal approximant like English , and a voiced palatal stop , as is common in many African orthographies.

In addition to the underdots, three further diacritics are used on vowels and syllabic nasal consonants to indicate the language&#x27;s tones: an acute accent for the high tone, a grave accent for the low tone, and an optional macron for the middle tone. These are used in addition to the underdots in and . When more than one tone is used in one syllable, the vowel can either be written once for each tone (for example, * for a vowel with tone rising from low to high) or, more rarely in current usage, combined into a single accent. In this case, a caron is used for the rising tone (so the previous example would be written ), and a circumflex for the falling tone. 

In Benin, Yoruba uses a different orthography. The Yoruba alphabet was standardized along with other Benin languages in the National Languages Alphabet by the National Language Commission in 1975, and revised in 1990 and 2008 by the National Center for Applied Linguistics.


In 2011, a Beninese priest-chief by the name of Tolúlàṣẹ Ògúntósìn devised a new script for Yoruba, based on a vision received in his sleep which he believed to have been granted by Oduduwa. This Oduduwa script has also received support from other prominent chiefs in the Yorubaland region of both countries.

== Phonology ==
The syllable structure of Yoruba is (C)V(N). Syllabic nasals are also possible. Every syllable bears one of the three tones: high , mid (generally left unmarked), and low . The sentence (&quot;I didn&#x27;t go&quot;) provides examples of three syllable types:
* — — &quot;I&quot;
* — — &quot;not&quot; (negation)
* — — &quot;to go&quot;

=== Vowels ===
Standard Yoruba has seven oral and five nasal vowels. There are no diphthongs in Yoruba; sequences of vowels are pronounced as separate syllables. Dialects differ in the number of vowels they have; see above.

* In some cases, the phonetic realization of these vowels is noticeably different from what the symbol suggests:
** The oral is close front , and the nasal varies between close front and near-close front .
** The oral is close back , and the nasal varies between close near-back , close back , near-close near-back and near-close back .
** The oral are close-mid , and do not have nasal counterparts.
** The oral is open-mid , and the nasal varies between mid and open-mid .
** The oral is near-open , and the nasal varies between open-mid and near-open .
** The oral is central .

Nasal vowels are by default written as a vowel letter followed by , thus: , , , , . These do not occur word-initially. 
In the standard language, occurs only in the single word &quot;ìyẹn&quot; ~ &quot;yẹn&quot; &#x27;that&#x27;. The status of the vowel is controversial. Several authors have argued it is not phonemically contrastive. Often, it is in free variation with . Orthographically, is used after labial and labial-velar consonants, as in &quot;ìbọn&quot; &#x27;gun&#x27;, and is used after non-labial consonants, as in &quot;dán&quot; &#x27;to shine&#x27;. All vowels are nasalized after the consonant , and thus there is no additional &quot;n&quot; in writing (&quot;mi, mu, mọ&quot;). In addition, the consonant has a nasal allophone before a nasal vowel (see below), and this is reflected in writing: &quot;inú&quot; &#x27;inside, belly&#x27; ( → ).
=== Consonants ===
The voiceless plosives and are slightly aspirated; in some Yoruba varieties, and are more dental. The rhotic consonant is realized as a flap or, in some varieties (notably Lagos Yoruba), as the alveolar approximant due to English influence. This is particularly common with Yoruba–English bilinguals.

Like many other languages of the region, Yoruba has the voiceless and voiced labial–velar stops and : &#x27;field&#x27;, &quot;&quot; &#x27;all&#x27;. Notably, it lacks a voiceless bilabial stop , apart from phonaesthesia, such as [pĩpĩ] for vehicle horn sounds, and marginal segments found in recent loanwords, such as &lt;pẹ́ńsù&gt; [k͡pɛ́ńsù~pɛ́ńsù] for &quot;pencil&quot;.

Yoruba also lacks a phoneme ; the letter is used for the sound in the orthography, but strictly speaking, it refers to an allophone of immediately preceding a nasal vowel.

There is also a syllabic nasal, which forms a syllable nucleus by itself. When it precedes a vowel, it is a velar nasal : &#x27;I didn&#x27;t go&#x27;. In other cases, its place of articulation is homorganic with the following consonant: &#x27;he is going&#x27;, &#x27;he is jumping&#x27;.

C, Q, V, X and Z only appear in words borrowed from English.

=== Tone ===
Yoruba is a tonal language with three-level tones and two or three contour tones. Every syllable must have at least one tone; a syllable containing a long vowel can have two tones. Tones are marked by use of the acute accent for high tone (, ) and the grave accent for low tone (, ); mid is unmarked, except on syllabic nasals where it is indicated using a macron (, ). Examples:
* H: ó bẹ́ [ó bɛ́] &#x27;he jumped&#x27;; síbí [síbí] &#x27;spoon&#x27;
* M: ó bẹ [ó bɛ̄] &#x27;he is forward&#x27;; ara [āɾā] &#x27;body&#x27;
* L: ó bẹ̀ [ó bɛ̀] &#x27;he asks for pardon&#x27;; ọ̀kọ̀ [ɔ̀kɔ̀] &#x27;spear&#x27;.
When teaching Yoruba literacy, solfège names of musical notes are used to name the tones: low is &quot;do&quot;, mid is &quot;re&quot;, and high is &quot;mi&quot;.

=== Whistled Yoruba ===

Apart from tone&#x27;s lexical and grammatical use, it is also used in other contexts such as whistling and drumming. Whistled Yoruba is used to communicate over long distances. The language is transformed as speakers talk and whistle simultaneously: consonants are devoiced or turned to [h], and all vowels are changed to [u]. However, all tones are retained without any alteration. The retention of tones enables speakers to understand the meaning of the whistled language. The Yoruba talking drum, the &quot;dùndún&quot; or &quot;iya ilu&quot;, which accompanies singing during festivals and important ceremonies, also uses tone.

=== Tonality effects and computer-coded documents ===
Written Yoruba includes diacritical marks not available on conventional computer keyboards, requiring some adaptations. In particular, the use of the sub dots and tone marks are not represented, so many Yoruba documents simply omit them. Asubiaro Toluwase, in his 2014 paper, points out that the use of these diacritics can affect the retrieval of Yoruba documents by popular search engines. Therefore, their omission can have a significant impact on online research.

==== Assimilation and elision ====
When a word precedes another word beginning with a vowel, assimilation, or deletion (&#x27;elision&#x27;) of one of the vowels often takes place. Since syllables in Yoruba normally end in a vowel, and most nouns start with one, it is a widespread phenomenon, and it is absent only in slow, unnatural speech. The orthography here follows speech in that word divisions are normally not indicated in words that are contracted due to assimilation or elision: &quot;ra ẹja&quot; → &quot;rẹja&quot; &#x27;buy fish&#x27;. Sometimes, however, authors may choose to use an inverted comma to indicate an elided vowel as in &quot;ní ilé&quot; → &quot;n&#x27;ílé&quot; &#x27;in the house&#x27;.

Long vowels within words usually signal that a consonant has been elided word-internally. In such cases, the tone of the elided vowel is retained: &quot;àdìrò&quot; → &quot;ààrò&quot; &#x27;hearth&#x27;; &quot;koríko&quot; → &quot;koóko&quot; &#x27;grass&#x27;; &quot;òtító&quot; → &quot;òótó&quot; &#x27;truth&#x27;.

== Vocabulary ==

===Roots===
Most roots are monosyllabic of the phonological shape CV(N), for example: &quot;dá&quot; &#x27;to create&#x27;, &quot;dán&quot; &#x27;to polish&#x27;, &quot;pọ́n&quot; &#x27;to be red&#x27;. Verbal roots that do not seem to follow this pattern are mostly former compounds in which a syllable has been elided. For example: &quot;nlá&quot; &#x27;to be large&#x27;, originally a compound of &quot;ní&quot; &#x27;to have&#x27; + &quot;lá&quot; &#x27;to be big&#x27; and &quot;súfèé&quot; &#x27;to whistle&#x27;, originally a compound of &quot;sú&quot; &#x27;to eject wind&#x27; + &quot;òfé or ìfé&quot; &#x27;a blowing&#x27;. Vowels serve as nominalizing prefixes that turn a verb into a noun form. 
Nominal roots are mostly disyllabic, for example: &quot;abà&quot; &#x27;crib, barn&#x27;, &quot;ara&quot; &#x27;body&#x27;, &quot;ibà&quot; &#x27;fever&#x27;. Monosyllabic and even trisyllabic roots do occur but they are less common.

== Grammar ==
Yoruba is a highly isolating language. Its basic constituent order is subject–verb–object, as in &quot;ó nà Adé&quot; &#x27;he beat Adé&#x27;. The bare verb stem denotes a completed action, often called perfect; tense and aspect are marked by preverbal particles such as &quot;ń&quot; &#x27;imperfect/present continuous&#x27;, &quot;ti&quot; &#x27;past&#x27;. Negation is expressed by a preverbal particle &quot;kò&quot;. Serial verb constructions are common, as in many other languages of West Africa.

Although Yoruba has no grammatical gender, it has a distinction between human and non-human nouns when it comes to interrogative particles: &quot;ta ni&quot; for human nouns (&#x27;who?&#x27;) and &quot;kí ni&quot; for non-human nouns (&#x27;what?&#x27;). The associative construction (covering possessive/genitive and related notions) consists of juxtaposing nouns in the order modified-modifier as in &quot;inú àpótí&quot; {inside box} &#x27;the inside of the box&#x27;, &quot;fìlà Àkàndé&quot; &#x27;Akande&#x27;s cap&#x27; or &quot;àpótí aṣọ&quot; &#x27;box for clothes&#x27;. More than two nouns can be juxtaposed: &quot;rélùweè abẹ́ ilẹ̀&quot; (railway underground) &#x27;underground railway&#x27;, &quot;inú àpótí aṣọ&quot; &#x27;the inside of the clothes box&#x27;. Disambiguation is left to context in the rare case that it results in two possible readings. Plural nouns are indicated by a plural word.

There are two &#x27;prepositions&#x27;: &quot;ní&quot; &#x27;on, at, in&#x27; and &quot;sí&quot; &#x27;onto, towards&#x27;. The former indicates location and absence of movement, and the latter encodes location/direction with movement. Position and direction are expressed by the prepositions in combination with spatial relational nouns like &quot;orí&quot; &#x27;top&#x27;, &quot;apá&quot; &#x27;side&#x27;, &quot;inú&quot; &#x27;inside&#x27;, &quot;etí&quot; &#x27;edge&#x27;, &quot;abẹ́&quot; &#x27;under&#x27;, &quot;ilẹ̀&quot; &#x27;down&#x27;, etc. Many of the spatial relational terms are historically related to body-part terms.

==Numerals==
Yoruba uses a vigesimal (base-20) numbering system.

* Ogún, 20, is a basic numeric block.
* Ogójì, 40, (Ogún-méjì) = 20 multiplied by 2 (èjì).
* Ọgọ́ta, 60, (Ogún-mẹ́ta) = 20 multiplied by 3 (ẹ̀ta).
* Ọgọ́rin, 80, (Ogún-mẹ́rin) = 20 multiplied by 4 (ẹ̀rin).
* Ọgọ́rùn-ún, 100, (Ogún-márùn-ún) = 20 multiplied by 5 (àrún).
* - 16 (Ẹẹ́rìndínlógún) = 4 less than 20.
* - 17 (Ẹẹ́tàdínlógún) = 3 less than 20.
* - 18 (Eéjìdínlógún) = 2 less than 20.
* - 19 (Oókàndínlógún) = 1 less than 20.
* - 21 (Oókànlélógún) = 1 increment on 20.
* - 22 (Eéjìlélógún) = 2 increment on 20.
* - 23 (Ẹẹ́tàlélógún) = 3 increment on 20.
* - 24 (Ẹẹ́rìnlélógún) = 4 increment on 20.
* - 25 (Aárùnlélógún) = 5 increment on 20.
* - 30 ( Ogbòn) = 10 increment on 20
* -50 (Aadota) = 10 less than 60

==Arabic influence==

The wide adoption of imported religions and civilizations such as Islam and Christianity has had an impact both on written and spoken Yoruba. In his &quot;Arabic-English Encyclopedic Dictionary of the Quran and Sunnah&quot;, Yoruba Muslim scholar Abu-Abdullah Adelabu argued Islam has enriched African languages by providing them with technical and cultural augmentations with Swahili and Somali in East Africa and Turanci Hausa and Wolof in West Africa being the primary beneficiaries. Adelabu, a Ph D graduate from Damascus cited—among many other common usages—the following words to be Yoruba&#x27;s derivatives of Arabic vocabularies:

===Some loanwords===
*&quot;Sanma&quot;: Heaven or sky, from 
*&quot;Alubarika&quot;: blessing, from 
*&quot;Alumaani&quot;: wealth, money, resources, from 
*&quot;Amin:&quot; Arabic form of the Hebrew religious term Amen, from 
Some common Arabic words used in Yoruba are names of the days such as &quot;Atalata&quot; () for Tuesday, &quot;Alaruba&quot; () for Wednesday, &quot;Alamisi&quot; () for Thursday, and &quot;Jimoh&quot; (, Jumu&#x27;ah) for Friday. By far, &quot;Ọjọ́ Jimoh&quot; is the most favourably used. This is because &quot;eti&quot;, the Yoruba word for Friday, means &#x27;delay&#x27;. This is an unpleasant word for Friday, &quot;Ẹtì&quot;, which also implies failure, laziness, or abandonment. Ultimately, the standard words for the days of the week are Àìkú, Ajé, Ìṣẹ́gun, Ọjọ́rú, Ọjọ́bọ, Ẹtì, Àbámẹ́ta, for Sunday, Monday, Tuesday, Wednesday, Thursday, Friday, Saturday respectively. Friday remains Eti in the Yoruba language.

<text>The great spotted cuckoo (Clamator glandarius) is a member of the cuckoo order of birds, the Cuculiformes, which also includes the roadrunners, the anis and the coucals.

It is widely spread throughout Africa and the Mediterranean Basin. It is a brood parasite that lays its eggs in the nests of corvids, in particular the Eurasian magpie.

==Taxonomy==
In 1747 the English naturalist George Edwards included an illustration and a description of the great spotted cuckoo in the second volume of his &quot;A Natural History of Uncommon Birds&quot;. He used the English name &quot;The Great Spotted Cuckow&quot;. Edwards based his hand-coloured etching on a specimen that had been shot in Gibraltar and sent to the English naturalist Mark Catesby in London. When in 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus updated his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; for the tenth edition, he placed the great spotted cuckoo with the other cuckoos in the genus &quot;Cuculus&quot;. Linnaeus included a brief description, coined the binomial name &quot;Cuculus glandarius&quot; and cited Edwards&#x27; work. The great spotted cuckoo is now placed in the genus &quot;Clamator&quot; that was introduced by German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup in 1829. The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name &quot;Clamator&quot; is Latin for &quot;shouter&quot; from &quot;clamare&quot;, &quot;to shout&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;glandarius&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;of acorns&quot;.

==Description==
This species is slightly larger than the common cuckoo at in length, but looks much larger with its broad wings and long narrow tail. The adult is grey above with a slender body, long tail and strong legs. It has a grey cap, grey wings, a yellowish face and upper breast, and white underparts. Sexes are similar. The juveniles have blackish upperparts and cap, and chestnut primary wing feathers. This species has a magpie-like flight.

It is a bird of warm open country with trees. It feeds on insects, spiders, small reptiles and hairy caterpillars, which are distasteful to many birds.

The great spotted cuckoo&#x27;s call is a loud &quot;cher-cher-kri-kri&quot; and variations.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===

Unlike the common cuckoo, neither the hen nor the hatched chick of this species evict the host&#x27;s eggs, but the young magpies often die because they cannot compete successfully with the cuckoo for food. However it has been shown that this species&#x27; chicks secrete a repellent scent when predators threaten. The repellent protects great spotted cuckoo chicks themselves as well as the host&#x27;s chicks from predators. Carrion crow (&quot;Corvus corone corone&quot;) chicks survive better if a great spotted cuckoo chick shares their nest. Birds of prey and feral cats less frequently prey on crow&#x27;s nests that include a great spotted cuckoo chick. Crow chicks benefit only when predators are very active; when there is less predation, losing food to great spotted cuckoo chicks harms the crow chicks without compensation.

<text>Phut or Put ( &quot;Pūṭ&quot;; Septuagint Greek &quot;Phoud&quot;) is the third son of Ham (one of the sons of Noah), in the biblical Table of Nations (Genesis ; cf. 1 Chronicles ). The name Put (or Phut) is used in the Bible for Ancient Libya, but a few scholars proposed the Land of Punt known from Ancient Egyptian annals.

==Historical records==
Epiphanius writes: &quot;Thus Mistrem was allotted Egypt, Cush, Aethiopia, Put, Axum, Ragman and Sabteka and [Dedan, also called Judad], the region bordering on Garama.&quot;

Josephus writes: &quot;Phut also was the founder of Libya, and called the inhabitants Phutites (&quot;Phoutes&quot;), from himself: there is also a river in the country of Moors which bears that name; whence it is that we may see the greatest part of the Grecian historiographers mention that river and the adjoining country by the appellation of Phut (&quot;Phoute&quot;): but the name it has now has been by change given it from one of the sons of Mezraim, who was called Lybyos.&quot; Pliny the Elder and Ptolemy both place the river &quot;Phuth&quot; on the west side of Mauretania. Ptolemy also mentions a city &quot;Putea&quot; in Libya (iv.3.39).

A Libyan connection has likewise been inferred from Nahum , where it is said that &quot;Put and Lubim&quot; were the helpers of Egypt. Other biblical verses consistently refer to the descendants of Put as warriors. In , they are again described as being supporters of Egypt. Ezekiel mentions them three times: in , as supporters of Tyre (Phoenicia), in again as supporting Egypt, and in , as supporters of Gog. The Hebrew Bible substitutes &quot;Put&quot; in Ezekiel where the Septuagint Greek (LXX) refers to &quot;Libues&quot;. However, the Hebrew reads &quot;Pul&quot; in , in place of &quot;Put&quot; in the LXX.

The Libyan tribe of &quot;pỉdw&quot; shows up in Egyptian records by the 22nd dynasty, while a Ptolemaic text from Edfu refers to the &quot;t3 n nꜣ pỉt.w&quot; &quot;the land of the Pitu&quot;. The word was later written in Demotic as &quot;Pỉt&quot;, and as &quot;Phaiat&quot; in Coptic, a name for Libya Aegypti, northwestern Egypt.

A fragment of Nebuchadnezzar II&#x27;s annals mentions his campaign in 567 in Egypt, and defeating the soldiers of &quot;Pu-ṭu-ia-a-man&quot;, i.e. Greek Libya (Cyrene). A multilingual stele from al-Kabrīt, dating to the reign of Darius I refers to the Put as the province of &quot;Putāya&quot; (Old Persian) and &quot;Puṭa&quot; (Neo-Babylonian), where the equivalent text written in Egyptian has &quot;tꜣ ṯmḥw&quot; &quot;Libya&quot;.

<doc id="356382" wikidata="Q1502576" url="?curid=356382" title="Gene regulatory network">
<text>A gene (or genetic) regulatory network (GRN) is a collection of molecular regulators that interact with each other and with other substances in the cell to govern the gene expression levels of mRNA and proteins which, in turn, determine the function of the cell. GRN also play a central role in morphogenesis, the creation of body structures, which in turn is central to evolutionary developmental biology (evo-devo).

The regulator can be DNA, RNA, protein or any combination of two or more of these three that form a complex, such as a specific sequence of DNA and a transcription factor to activate that sequence. The interaction can be direct or indirect (through transcribed RNA or translated protein). In general, each mRNA molecule goes on to make a specific protein (or set of proteins). In some cases this protein will be structural, and will accumulate at the cell membrane or within the cell to give it particular structural properties. In other cases the protein will be an enzyme, i.e., a micro-machine that catalyses a certain reaction, such as the breakdown of a food source or toxin. Some proteins though serve only to activate other genes, and these are the transcription factors that are the main players in regulatory networks or cascades. By binding to the promoter region at the start of other genes they turn them on, initiating the production of another protein, and so on. Some transcription factors are inhibitory.

In single-celled organisms, regulatory networks respond to the external environment, optimising the cell at a given time for survival in this environment. Thus a yeast cell, finding itself in a sugar solution, will turn on genes to make enzymes that process the sugar to alcohol. This process, which we associate with wine-making, is how the yeast cell makes its living, gaining energy to multiply, which under normal circumstances would enhance its survival prospects.

In multicellular animals the same principle has been put in the service of gene cascades that control body-shape. Each time a cell divides, two cells result which, although they contain the same genome in full, can differ in which genes are turned on and making proteins. Sometimes a &#x27;self-sustaining feedback loop&#x27; ensures that a cell maintains its identity and passes it on. Less understood is the mechanism of epigenetics by which chromatin modification may provide cellular memory by blocking or allowing transcription. A major feature of multicellular animals is the use of morphogen gradients, which in effect provide a positioning system that tells a cell where in the body it is, and hence what sort of cell to become. A gene that is turned on in one cell may make a product that leaves the cell and diffuses through adjacent cells, entering them and turning on genes only when it is present above a certain threshold level. These cells are thus induced into a new fate, and may even generate other morphogens that signal back to the original cell. Over longer distances morphogens may use the active process of signal transduction. Such signalling controls embryogenesis, the building of a body plan from scratch through a series of sequential steps. They also control and maintain adult bodies through feedback processes, and the loss of such feedback because of a mutation can be responsible for the cell proliferation that is seen in cancer. In parallel with this process of building structure, the gene cascade turns on genes that make structural proteins that give each cell the physical properties it needs.

== Overview ==

At one level, biological cells can be thought of as &quot;partially mixed bags&quot; of biological chemicals – in the discussion of gene regulatory networks, these chemicals are mostly the messenger RNAs (mRNAs) and proteins that arise from gene expression. These mRNA and proteins interact with each other with various degrees of specificity. Some diffuse around the cell. Others are bound to cell membranes, interacting with molecules in the environment. Still others pass through cell membranes and mediate long range signals to other cells in a multi-cellular organism. These molecules and their interactions comprise a &quot;gene regulatory network&quot;. A typical gene regulatory network looks something like this:

The nodes of this network can represent genes, proteins, mRNAs, protein/protein complexes or cellular processes. Nodes that are depicted as lying along vertical lines are associated with the cell/environment interfaces, while the others are free-floating and can diffuse. Edges between nodes represent interactions between the nodes, that can correspond to individual molecular reactions between DNA, mRNA, miRNA, proteins or molecular processes through which the products of one gene affect those of another, though the lack of experimentally obtained information often implies that some reactions are not modeled at such a fine level of detail. These interactions can be inductive (usually represented by arrowheads or the + sign), with an increase in the concentration of one leading to an increase in the other, inhibitory (represented with filled circles, blunt arrows or the minus sign), with an increase in one leading to a decrease in the other, or dual, when depending on the circumstances the regulator can activate or inhibit the target node. The nodes can regulate themselves directly or indirectly, creating feedback loops, which form cyclic chains of dependencies in the topological network. The network structure is an abstraction of the system&#x27;s molecular or chemical dynamics, describing the manifold ways in which one substance affects all the others to which it is connected. In practice, such GRNs are inferred from the biological literature on a given system and represent a distillation of the collective knowledge about a set of related biochemical reactions. To speed up the manual curation of GRNs, some recent efforts try to use text mining, curated databases, network inference from massive data, model checking and other information extraction technologies for this purpose.

Genes can be viewed as nodes in the network, with input being proteins such as transcription factors, and outputs being the level of gene expression. The value of the node depends on a function which depends on the value of its regulators in previous time steps (in the Boolean network described below these are Boolean functions, typically AND, OR, and NOT). These functions have been interpreted as performing a kind of information processing within the cell, which determines cellular behavior. The basic drivers within cells are concentrations of some proteins, which determine both spatial (location within the cell or tissue) and temporal (cell cycle or developmental stage) coordinates of the cell, as a kind of &quot;cellular memory&quot;. The gene networks are only beginning to be understood, and it is a next step for biology to attempt to deduce the functions for each gene &quot;node&quot;, to help understand the behavior of the system in increasing levels of complexity, from gene to signaling pathway, cell or tissue level.

Mathematical models of GRNs have been developed to capture the behavior of the system being modeled, and in some cases generate predictions corresponding with experimental observations. In some other cases, models have proven to make accurate novel predictions, which can be tested experimentally, thus suggesting new approaches to explore in an experiment that sometimes wouldn&#x27;t be considered in the design of the protocol of an experimental laboratory. Modeling techniques include differential equations (ODEs), Boolean networks, Petri nets, Bayesian networks, graphical Gaussian network models, Stochastic, and Process Calculi. Conversely, techniques have been proposed for generating models of GRNs that best explain a set of time series observations. Recently it has been shown that ChIP-seq signal of histone modification are more correlated with transcription factor motifs at promoters in comparison to RNA level. Hence it is proposed that time-series histone modification ChIP-seq could provide more reliable inference of gene-regulatory networks in comparison to methods based on expression levels.

== Structure and evolution ==

=== Global feature ===
Gene regulatory networks are generally thought to be made up of a few highly connected nodes (hubs) and many poorly connected nodes nested within a hierarchical regulatory regime. Thus gene regulatory networks approximate a hierarchical scale free network topology. This is consistent with the view that most genes have limited pleiotropy and operate within regulatory modules. This structure is thought to evolve due to the preferential attachment of duplicated genes to more highly connected genes. Recent work has also shown that natural selection tends to favor networks with sparse connectivity.

There are primarily two ways that networks can evolve, both of which can occur simultaneously. The first is that network topology can be changed by the addition or subtraction of nodes (genes) or parts of the network (modules) may be expressed in different contexts. The&quot; Drosophila&quot; Hippo signaling pathway provides a good example. The Hippo signaling pathway controls both mitotic growth and post-mitotic cellular differentiation. Recently it was found that the network the Hippo signaling pathway operates in differs between these two functions which in turn changes the behavior of the Hippo signaling pathway. This suggests that the Hippo signaling pathway operates as a conserved regulatory module that can be used for multiple functions depending on context. Thus, changing network topology can allow a conserved module to serve multiple functions and alter the final output of the network. The second way networks can evolve is by changing the strength of interactions between nodes, such as how strongly a transcription factor may bind to a cis-regulatory element. Such variation in strength of network edges has been shown to underlie between species variation in vulva cell fate patterning of &quot;Caenorhabditis&quot; worms.

=== Local feature ===
Another widely cited characteristic of gene regulatory network is their abundance of certain repetitive sub-networks known as network motifs. Network motifs can be regarded as repetitive topological patterns when dividing a big network into small blocks. Previous analysis found several types of motifs that appeared more often in gene regulatory networks than in randomly generated networks. As an example, one such motif is called feed-forward loops, which consist of three nodes. This motif is the most abundant among all possible motifs made up of three nodes, as is shown in the gene regulatory networks of fly, nematode, and human.

The enriched motifs have been proposed to follow convergent evolution, suggesting they are &quot;optimal designs&quot; for certain regulatory purposes. For example, modeling shows that feed-forward loops are able to coordinate the change in node A (in terms of concentration and activity) and the expression dynamics of node C, creating different input-output behaviors. The galactose utilization system of &quot;E. coli&quot; contains a feed-forward loop which accelerates the activation of galactose utilization operon &quot;galETK&quot;, potentially facilitating the metabolic transition to galactose when glucose is depleted. The feed-forward loop in the arabinose utilization systems of &quot;E.coli&quot; delays the activation of arabinose catabolism operon and transporters, potentially avoiding unnecessary metabolic transition due to temporary fluctuations in upstream signaling pathways. Similarly in the Wnt signaling pathway of &quot;Xenopus&quot;, the feed-forward loop acts as a fold-change detector that responses to the fold change, rather than the absolute change, in the level of β-catenin, potentially increasing the resistance to fluctuations in β-catenin levels. Following the convergent evolution hypothesis, the enrichment of feed-forward loops would be an adaptation for fast response and noise resistance. A recent research found that yeast grown in an environment of constant glucose developed mutations in glucose signaling pathways and growth regulation pathway, suggesting regulatory components responding to environmental changes are dispensable under constant environment.

On the other hand, some researchers hypothesize that the enrichment of network motifs is non-adaptive. In other words, gene regulatory networks can evolve to a similar structure without the specific selection on the proposed input-output behavior. Support for this hypothesis often comes from computational simulations. For example, fluctuations in the abundance of feed-forward loops in a model that simulates the evolution of gene regulatory networks by randomly rewiring nodes may suggest that the enrichment of feed-forward loops is a side-effect of evolution. In another model of gene regulator networks evolution, the ratio of the frequencies of gene duplication and gene deletion show great influence on network topology: certain ratios lead to the enrichment of feed-forward loops and create networks that show features of hierarchical scale free networks. De novo evolution of coherent type 1 feed-forward loops has been demonstrated computationally in response to selection for their hypothesized function of filtering out a short spurious signal, supporting adaptive evolution, but for non-idealized noise, a dynamics-based system of feed-forward regulation with different topology was instead favored.

==Bacterial regulatory networks==
Regulatory networks allow bacteria to adapt to almost every environmental niche on earth. A network of interactions among diverse types of molecules including DNA, RNA, proteins and metabolites, is utilised by the bacteria to achieve regulation of gene expression. In bacteria, the principal function of regulatory networks is to control the response to environmental changes, for example nutritional status and environmental stress. A complex organization of networks permits the microorganism to coordinate and integrate multiple environmental signals.

One example stress is when the environment suddenly becomes poor of nutrients. This triggers a complex adaptation process in bacteria, such as &quot;E. coli.&quot; After this environmental change, thousands of genes change expression level. However, these changes are predictable from the topology and logic of the gene network that is reported in RegulonDB. Specifically, on average, the response strength of a gene was predictable from the difference between the numbers of activating and repressing input transcription factors of that gene.

== Modelling ==

=== Coupled ordinary differential equations ===
It is common to model such a network with a set of coupled ordinary differential equations (ODEs) or SDEs, describing the reaction kinetics of the constituent parts. Suppose that our regulatory network has formula_1 nodes, and let formula_2 represent the concentrations of the formula_1 corresponding substances at time formula_4. Then the temporal evolution of the system can be described approximately by

: formula_5

where the functions formula_6 express the dependence of formula_7 on the concentrations of other substances present in the cell. The functions formula_8 are ultimately derived from basic principles of chemical kinetics or simple expressions derived from these e.g. Michaelis–Menten enzymatic kinetics. Hence, the functional forms of the formula_8 are usually chosen as low-order polynomials or Hill functions that serve as an ansatz for the real molecular dynamics. Such models are then studied using the mathematics of nonlinear dynamics. System-specific information, like reaction rate constants and sensitivities, are encoded as constant parameters.

By solving for the fixed point of the system:

: formula_10

for all formula_11, one obtains (possibly several) concentration profiles of proteins and mRNAs that are theoretically sustainable (though not necessarily stable). Steady states of kinetic equations thus correspond to potential cell types, and oscillatory solutions to the above equation to naturally cyclic cell types. Mathematical stability of these attractors can usually be characterized by the sign of higher derivatives at critical points, and then correspond to biochemical stability of the concentration profile. Critical points and bifurcations in the equations correspond to critical cell states in which small state or parameter perturbations could switch the system between one of several stable differentiation fates. Trajectories correspond to the unfolding of biological pathways and transients of the equations to short-term biological events. For a more mathematical discussion, see the articles on nonlinearity, dynamical systems, bifurcation theory, and chaos theory.

=== Boolean network ===
The following example illustrates how a Boolean network can model a GRN together with its gene products (the outputs) and the substances from the environment that affect it (the inputs). Stuart Kauffman was amongst the first biologists to use the metaphor of Boolean networks to model genetic regulatory networks.

# Each gene, each input, and each output is represented by a node in a directed graph in which there is an arrow from one node to another if and only if there is a causal link between the two nodes.
# Each node in the graph can be in one of two states: on or off.
# For a gene, &quot;on&quot; corresponds to the gene being expressed; for inputs and outputs, &quot;on&quot; corresponds to the substance being present.
# Time is viewed as proceeding in discrete steps. At each step, the new state of a node is a Boolean function of the prior states of the nodes with arrows pointing towards it.

The validity of the model can be tested by comparing simulation results with time series observations. A partial validation of a Boolean network model can also come from testing the predicted existence of a yet unknown regulatory connection between two particular transcription factors that each are nodes of the model.

=== Continuous networks ===

Continuous network models of GRNs are an extension of the Boolean networks described above. Nodes still represent genes and connections between them regulatory influences on gene expression. Genes in biological systems display a continuous range of activity levels and it has been argued that using a continuous representation captures several properties of gene regulatory networks not present in the Boolean model. Formally most of these approaches are similar to an artificial neural network, as inputs to a node are summed up and the result serves as input to a sigmoid function, e.g., but proteins do often control gene expression in a synergistic, i.e. non-linear, way. However, there is now a continuous network model that allows grouping of inputs to a node thus realizing another level of regulation. This model is formally closer to a higher order recurrent neural network. The same model has also been used to mimic the evolution of cellular differentiation and even multicellular morphogenesis.

=== Stochastic gene networks ===

Experimental results
 have demonstrated that gene expression is a stochastic process. Thus, many authors are now using the stochastic formalism, after the work by Arkin et al. Works on single gene expression and small synthetic genetic networks, such as the genetic toggle switch of Tim Gardner and Jim Collins, provided additional experimental data on the phenotypic variability and the stochastic nature of gene expression. The first versions of stochastic models of gene expression involved only instantaneous reactions and were driven by the Gillespie algorithm.

Since some processes, such as gene transcription, involve many reactions and could not be correctly modeled as an instantaneous reaction in a single step, it was proposed to model these reactions as single step multiple delayed reactions in order to account for the time it takes for the entire process to be complete.

From here, a set of reactions were proposed that allow generating GRNs. These are then simulated using a modified version of the Gillespie algorithm, that can simulate multiple time delayed reactions (chemical reactions where each of the products is provided a time delay that determines when will it be released in the system as a &quot;finished product&quot;).

For example, basic transcription of a gene can be represented by the following single-step reaction (RNAP is the RNA polymerase, RBS is the RNA ribosome binding site, and Pro &quot;i&quot; is the promoter region of gene &quot;i&quot;):

: formula_12

Furthermore, there seems to be a trade-off between the noise in gene expression, the speed with which genes can switch, and the metabolic cost associated their functioning. More specifically, for any given level of metabolic cost, there is an optimal trade-off between noise and processing speed and increasing the metabolic cost leads to better speed-noise trade-offs.

A recent work proposed a simulator (SGNSim, &quot;Stochastic Gene Networks Simulator&quot;), that can model GRNs where transcription and translation are modeled as multiple time delayed events and its dynamics is driven by a stochastic simulation algorithm (SSA) able to deal with multiple time delayed events.
The time delays can be drawn from several distributions and the reaction rates from complex
functions or from physical parameters. SGNSim can generate ensembles of GRNs within a set of user-defined parameters, such as topology. It can also be used to model specific GRNs and systems of chemical reactions. Genetic perturbations such as gene deletions, gene over-expression, insertions, frame shift mutations can also be modeled as well.

The GRN is created from a graph with the desired topology, imposing in-degree and out-degree distributions. Gene promoter activities are affected by other genes expression products that act as inputs, in the form of monomers or combined into multimers and set as direct or indirect. Next, each direct input is assigned to an operator site and different transcription factors can be allowed, or not, to compete for the same operator site, while indirect inputs are given a target. Finally, a function is assigned to each gene, defining the gene&#x27;s response to a combination of transcription factors (promoter state). The transfer functions (that is, how genes respond to a combination of inputs) can be assigned to each combination of promoter states as desired.

In other recent work, multiscale models of gene regulatory networks have been developed that focus on synthetic biology applications. Simulations have been used that model all biomolecular interactions in transcription, translation, regulation, and induction of gene regulatory networks, guiding the design of synthetic systems.

== Prediction ==

Other work has focused on predicting the gene expression levels in a gene regulatory network. The approaches used to model gene regulatory networks have been constrained to be interpretable and, as a result, are generally simplified versions of the network. For example, Boolean networks have been used due to their simplicity and ability to handle noisy data but lose data information by having a binary representation of the genes. Also, artificial neural networks omit using a hidden layer so that they can be interpreted, losing the ability to model higher order correlations in the data. Using a model that is not constrained to be interpretable, a more accurate model can be produced. Being able to predict gene expressions more accurately provides a way to explore how drugs affect a system of genes as well as for finding which genes are interrelated in a process. This has been encouraged by the DREAM competition which promotes a competition for the best prediction algorithms. Some other recent work has used artificial neural networks with a hidden layer.

== Applications ==
===Multiple sclerosis===

There are three classes of multiple sclerosis: relapsing-remitting (RRMS), primary progressive (PPMS) and secondary progressive (SPMS). Gene regulatory network (GRN) plays a vital role to understand the disease mechanism across these three different multiple sclerosis classes.

<doc id="356390" wikidata="Q1273385" url="?curid=356390" title="Gaius Servilius Ahala">
<text>Gaius Servilius Ahala ( 439 BC) was a 5th-century BC politician of ancient Rome, considered by many later writers to have been a hero. His fame rested on the contention that he saved Rome from Spurius Maelius in 439 BC by killing him with a dagger concealed under an armpit. This may be less historical fact and more etiological myth, invented to explain the Servilian cognomen &quot;Ahala&quot;/&quot;Axilla&quot;, which means &quot;armpit&quot; and is probably of Etruscan origin.

As related by Livy and others, Ahala served as magister equitum in 439 BC, when Cincinnatus was appointed dictator on the supposition that Spurius Maelius was styling himself a king and plotting against the state. During the night on which the dictator was appointed, the capitol and all the strong posts were garrisoned by the partisans of the patricians. In the morning, when the people assembled in the forum, with Spurius Maelius among them, Ahala summoned the latter to appear before the dictator. When Maelius disobeyed and took refuge in the crowd, Ahala rushed into the throng and killed him.

This is mentioned by several later writers as an example of ancient Roman heroism, and is frequently referred to by Cicero in terms of the highest admiration; but was regarded as a case of murder at the time. Ahala was brought to trial, and only escaped condemnation by going into voluntary exile. Livy passes over this, and only mentions that a bill was brought in three years afterwards, in 436 BC, by another Spurius Maelius, a tribune, for confiscating the property of Ahala, but that it failed.

In 54 BC, a representation of Ahala was given on a coin of Marcus Junius Brutus, who participated in the murder of Julius Caesar, but we cannot suppose it to be anything more than an imaginary likeness. Brutus claimed (perhaps baselessly) that he was descended from Lucius Junius Brutus, the first consul, on his father&#x27;s side, and from Ahala on his mother&#x27;s, and thus was sprung from two tyrannicides. The head of Brutus on the annexed coin is therefore intended to represent the first consul.

Plutarch says, in his &quot;life of Brutus&quot;, that Brutus&#x27; mother Servilia was a descendant of Servilius Ahala, and the ancestral example was an inspiration for his assassination of Julius Caesar.

<doc id="356391" wikidata="Q1609768" url="?curid=356391" title="Letter from Birmingham Jail">
<text>The &quot;Letter from Birmingham Jail&quot;, also known as the &quot;Letter from Birmingham City Jail&quot; and &quot;The Negro Is Your Brother&quot;, is an open letter written on April 16, 1963, by Martin Luther King Jr. It says that people have a moral responsibility to break unjust laws and to take direct action rather than waiting potentially forever for justice to come through the courts. Responding to being referred to as an &quot;outsider&quot;, King writes: &quot;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere.&quot;

The letter, written in response to &quot;A Call for Unity&quot; during the 1963 Birmingham campaign, was widely published, and became an important text for the civil rights movement in the United States. The letter has been described as &quot;one of the most important historical documents penned by a modern political prisoner&quot;, and is considered a classic document of civil disobedience.

== Background ==
Birmingham, Alabama, was known for its intense segregation and attempts by some residents to combat said racism during this time period. For example, students at Miles College boycotted local downtown stores for eight weeks, which resulted in a decrease in sales by 40% and two stores desegregating their water fountains. The Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) had met with the Senior Citizens Committee (SCC) following this protest in hopes to find a way to prevent larger forms of retaliation against segregation. The SCC, a white civic organization, had agreed during this meeting to remove all &quot;Whites Only&quot; signs from downtown department stores, however failed to carry this promise through. The citizens of Birmingham&#x27;s efforts in desegregation caught King&#x27;s attention, especially with their previous attempts resulting in failure or broken promises. Their desire to be active in fighting against racism is what made King certain that this was where he needed to begin his work.

King met with President John F. Kennedy on October 16, 1961, to address the concerns of discrimination in the south and the lack of action the government was taking; President Kennedy seemed to be in support of desegregation, but was slow to take action, with Birmingham officials refusing to leave office in an effort to prevent a younger generation of officials with less discriminatory beliefs being elected. These leaders in Birmingham were legally not required to leave their office until 1965, meaning that something else had to be done to generate change. King, passionate for this change, created &quot;Project C&quot;, with &#x27;C&#x27; standing for &#x27;confrontation&#x27;. &quot;Project C&quot; was also referred to as the Birmingham campaign.

The Birmingham campaign began on April 3, 1963, with coordinated marches and sit-ins against racism and racial segregation in Birmingham. The nonviolent campaign was coordinated by the Alabama Christian Movement for Human Rights (ACMHR) and King&#x27;s Southern Christian Leadership Conference (SCLC). On April 10, Circuit Judge W. A. Jenkins Jr. issued a blanket injunction against &quot;parading, demonstrating, boycotting, trespassing and picketing&quot;. Leaders of the campaign announced they would disobey the ruling. On April 12, Martin Luther King was arrested with SCLC activist Ralph Abernathy, ACMHR and SCLC official Fred Shuttlesworth, and other marchers, while thousands of African Americans dressed for Good Friday looked on.

King was met with unusually harsh conditions in the Birmingham jail. An ally smuggled in a newspaper from April 12, which contained &quot;A Call for Unity&quot;, a statement by eight white Alabama clergymen against King and his methods. The letter provoked King, and he began to write a response to the newspaper itself. King writes in &quot;Why We Can&#x27;t Wait&quot;: &quot;Begun on the margins of the newspaper in which the statement appeared while I was in jail, the letter was continued on scraps of writing paper supplied by a friendly Negro , and concluded on a pad my attorneys were eventually permitted to leave me.&quot; Walter Reuther, president of the United Auto Workers, arranged $160,000 to bail out King and the other jailed protestors.

== Summary and themes ==
King&#x27;s letter, dated April 16, 1963, responded to several criticisms made by the &quot;A Call for Unity&quot; clergymen, who agreed that social injustices existed but argued that the battle against racial segregation should be fought solely in the courts, not the streets. He also criticized the assertion that African Americans ought to wait patiently while these battles were fought in the courts. 

King began the letter by responding to the criticism that he and his fellow activists were &quot;outsiders&quot; causing trouble in the streets of Birmingham. King referred to his responsibility as the leader of the SCLC, which had numerous affiliated organizations throughout the South. King wrote: &quot;I was invited&quot; by the SCLC&#x27;s Birmingham affiliate, &quot;because injustice is here&quot; in what was probably the most racially-divided city in the country, with its brutal police, unjust courts, and many &quot;unsolved bombings of Negro homes and churches&quot;. Referring to his belief that all communities and states were interrelated, King wrote, &quot;Injustice anywhere is a threat to justice everywhere. We are caught in an inescapable network of mutuality, tied in a single garment of destiny. Whatever affects one directly, affects all indirectly[...] Anyone who lives inside the United States can never be considered an outsider anywhere within its bounds.&quot; King also warned that if white people successfully rejected his nonviolent activists as rabble-rousing outside agitators, it could encourage millions of African Americans to &quot;seek solace and security in black nationalist ideologies, a development that will lead inevitably to a frightening racial nightmare.&quot;

The clergymen also disapproved of tensions created by public actions such as sit-ins and marches. King confirmed that he and his fellow demonstrators were indeed using nonviolent direct action in order to create &quot;constructive&quot; tension. The tension was intended to compel meaningful negotiation with the white power structure without which true civil rights could never be achieved. Citing previous failed negotiations, King wrote that the black community was left with &quot;no alternative&quot;. &quot;We know through painful experience that freedom is never voluntarily given by the oppressor; it must be demanded by the oppressed.&quot;

The clergymen also disapproved of the timing of public actions. In response, King said that recent decisions by the SCLC to delay its efforts for tactical reasons showed that it was behaving responsibly. He also referred to the broader scope of history, when Wait&#x27; has almost always meant &#x27;Never. Declaring that African Americans had waited for the God-given and constitutional rights long enough, King quoted &quot;one of our distinguished jurists&quot; that &quot;justice too long delayed is justice denied.&quot; Listing numerous ongoing injustices toward black people, including himself, King said, &quot;Perhaps it is easy for those who have never felt the stinging darts of segregation to say, &#x27;Wait. Along similar lines, King also lamented the &quot;myth concerning time&quot; by which white moderates assumed that progress toward equal rights was inevitable and so assertive activism was unnecessary. King called it a &quot;tragic misconception of time&quot; to assume that its mere passage &quot;will inevitably cure all ills&quot;. King wrote that progress takes time as well as the &quot;tireless efforts&quot; of dedicated people of good will.

Against the clergymen&#x27;s assertion that demonstrations could be illegal, King argued that civil disobedience was not only justified in the face of unjust laws but also was necessary and even patriotic: &quot;The answer lies in the fact that there are two types of laws: just and unjust. I would be the first to advocate obeying just laws. One has not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws. Conversely, one has a moral responsibility to disobey unjust laws. I would agree with St. Augustine that &#x27;an unjust law is no law at all. Anticipating the claim that one cannot determine such things, he again cited Christian theologian Thomas Aquinas by saying any law not rooted in &quot;eternal law and natural law&quot; is not just, while any law that &quot;uplifts human personality&quot; is just. Segregation undermines human personality, ergo, is unjust. Furthermore, he wrote: &quot;I submit that an individual who breaks a law that conscience tells him is unjust, and who willingly accepts the penalty of imprisonment in order to arouse the conscience of the community over its injustice, is in reality expressing the highest respect for law.&quot;

King cited Martin Buber and Paul Tillich with further examples from the past and present of what makes laws just or unjust: &quot;A law is unjust if it is inflicted on a minority that, as a result of being denied the right to vote, had no part in enacting or devising the law.&quot; In terms of obedience to the law, King says citizens have &quot;not only a legal but a moral responsibility to obey just laws&quot; and also &quot;to disobey unjust laws&quot;. King stated that it is not morally wrong to disobey a law that pertains to one group of people differently from another. Alabama has used &quot;all sorts of devious methods&quot; to deny its black citizens their right to vote and thus preserve its unjust laws and broader system of white supremacy. Segregation laws are immoral and unjust &quot;because segregation distorts the soul and damages the personality. It gives the segregator a false sense of superiority and the segregated a false sense of inferiority.&quot; Even some just laws, such as permit requirements for public marches, are unjust when they are used to uphold an unjust system.

King addressed the accusation that the Civil Rights Movement was &quot;extreme&quot; by first disputing the label but then accepting it. Compared to other movements at the time, King found himself as a moderate. However, in his devotion to his cause, King referred to himself as an extremist. Jesus and other great reformers were extremists: &quot;So the question is not whether we will be extremists, but what kind of extremists we will be. Will we be extremists for hate or for love?&quot; King&#x27;s discussion of extremism implicitly responded to numerous &quot;moderate&quot; objections to the ongoing movement, such as US President Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s claim that he could not meet with civil rights leaders because doing so would require him to meet with the Ku Klux Klan.

King expressed general frustration with both white moderates and certain &quot;opposing forces in the Negro community&quot;. He wrote that white moderates, including clergymen, posed a challenge comparable to that of white supremacists: &quot;Shallow understanding from people of good will is more frustrating than absolute misunderstanding from people of ill will. Lukewarm acceptance is much more bewildering than outright rejection.&quot; King asserted that the white church needed to take a principled stand or risk being &quot;dismissed as an irrelevant social club&quot;. Regarding the black community, King wrote that we need not follow &quot;the &#x27;do-nothingism&#x27; of the complacent nor the hatred and despair of the Black nationalist.&quot;

In the closing, King criticized the clergy&#x27;s praise of the Birmingham police for maintaining order nonviolently. The recent public displays of nonviolence by the police were in stark contrast to their typical treatment of black people and, as public relations, helped &quot;to preserve the evil system of segregation&quot;. It is wrong to use immoral means to achieve moral ends but also &quot;to use moral means to preserve immoral ends&quot;. Instead of the police, King praised the nonviolent demonstrators in Birmingham &quot;for their sublime courage, their willingness to suffer and their amazing discipline in the midst of great provocation. One day the South will recognize its real heroes.&quot;

== Publication ==

King wrote the first part of the letter on the margins of a newspaper, which was the only paper available to him. He then wrote more on bits and pieces of paper given to him by a trusty, which were given to his lawyers to take back to movement headquarters. Pastor Wyatt Tee Walker and his secretary Willie Pearl Mackey then began compiling and editing the literary jigsaw puzzle. He was eventually able to finish the letter on a pad of paper his lawyers were allowed to leave with him.

An editor at &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot;, Harvey Shapiro, asked King to write his letter for publication in the magazine, but the &quot;Times&quot; chose not to publish it. Extensive excerpts from the letter were published, without King&#x27;s consent, on May 19, 1963, in the &quot;New York Post Sunday Magazine&quot;. The complete letter was first published as &quot;Letter from Birmingham City Jail&quot; by the American Friends Service Committee in May 1963 and subsequently in the June 1963 issue of &quot;Liberation&quot;, the June 12, 1963, edition of &quot;The Christian Century&quot;, and the June 24, 1963, edition of &quot;The New Leader&quot;. The letter gained more popularity as summer went on, and was reprinted in the July 1963 edition of &quot;The Progressive&quot; under the headline &quot;Tears of Love&quot; and the August 1963 edition of &quot;The Atlantic Monthly&quot; under the headline &quot;The Negro Is Your Brother&quot;. King included a version of the full text in his 1964 book &quot;Why We Can&#x27;t Wait&quot;.

The letter was anthologized and reprinted around 50 times in 325 editions of 58 readers. These readers were published for college-level composition courses between 1964 and 1968.

U.S. Senator Doug Jones (D-Alabama) led an annual bipartisan reading of the letter in the Senate during his tenure there in 2019 and 2020, and passed the obligation to lead the reading to Sen. Sherrod Brown (D-Ohio) upon Jones&#x27; election defeat.

<text>Kovalam is a beach and seaside resort in the city of Thiruvananthapuram in Kerala, India. Kovalam is located southeast of the city center. The beaches around Kovalam are popular vacation destinations for both domestic and international travellers.

==Etymology==
Kovalam means &quot;coconut grove&quot;, after the coconut trees which are common there.

==History==
Kovalam first received attention when the Regent Maharani Sethu Lakshmi Bayi of Travancore constructed her beach resort, Halcyon Castle, here towards the end of the 1920s. Thereafter the place was brought to the public eye by her nephew the Maharaja of Travancore. The European guests of the then Travancore kingdom discovered the potential of Kovalam beach as a tourist destination in the 1930s. In the early 1970s many hippies came on their way to Ceylon via the hippie trail, beginning the transformation of a casual fishing village of Kerala into a significant tourist destination.

==Geography==

===Beaches===
Kovalam has three beaches separated by rocky outcroppings in its 17 km coastline, the three together form the crescent of the Kovalam beach.

* Lighthouse Beach – the southernmost beach, the Lighthouse Beach, is named after the 118 feet (36 m) Vizhinjam Lighthouse located on top of the Kurumkal hillock. 

* Hawah Beach – also known as Eve&#x27;s Beach, consists of a high rock promontory and a bay, and is used by local fishermen.

* Samudra Beach – separated from the Lighthouse Beach by a large promontory, it is also used by local fishermen.

* Ashoka Beach – sea-wall to see the sea above the rocks and swimmable shallow waters 

=== Places to visit ===
* Karamana River – Karamana River originates from the southern part of Sahyadri Range. The river predominantly flows through an outskirt region of Kovalam called Karmana, hence the nomenclature.
===Tourist facilities===
Kovalam was among the most prominent tourist spots in India during the hippie era. It still has a high status among tourists, who arrive mostly from Europe and Israel. Kovalam is finding a new significance in the light of several Ayurvedic salons, and recuperation and regeneration resorts which provide a wide variety of Ayurvedic treatments for tourists.
One of the first hotels to open there was the Kovalam Beach Resort, which was designed by Charles Correa from 1969 to 1974.

===Transport===
The nearest train station is Thiruvananthapuram Central railway station, about away. The nearest airport is Thiruvananthapuram International Airport, about away.

==Politics==
Kovalam assembly constituency is part of Thiruvananthapuram (Lok Sabha constituency). In 2016 Kerala Assembly elections, M Vincent of the Indian National Congress defeated incumbent Jameela Prakasham by over 2,500 votes.

== Thiruvananthapuram International Cruise Terminal==
Vizhinjam&#x27;s location, with its proximity to beaches, historical sites, and cultural attractions, is a base for exploring Kerala&#x27;s heritage. Visitors can take tours to nearby destinations such as Kovalam, Thiruvananthapuram, and the Padmanabhaswamy Temple.

The Vizhinjam Cruise Terminal is currently under construction by Adani Ports.

<text>The Bakwena or Bakoena (&quot;those who venerate the crocodile&quot;) are a large Sotho-Tswana clan in Southern Africa of the southern Bantu group. They can be found in different parts of southern Africa such as Lesotho, Botswana, South Africa and Eswatini. &quot;Kwena&quot; is a Sotho/Tswana/Sepedi word meaning &quot;crocodile&quot;, the crocodile is also their totem (seboko).

==Genealogy and history==
Earliest ancestor of the Kwena clan, Kwena, was a grandson of Masilo I, the King of Bahurutse clan around 1360 CE. Kwena and his followers settled at Tebang, now called Heidelberg. Around 1500 CE, Bakwena started spreading in the region, from the Lekwa River to Kalahari (Botswana) until settling at Ntsoanatsatsi (mythical origin land of the Sotho-Tswana people) with the Bafokeng around 1580 CE.

=== Early leaders ===

* Kwena (dates unknown)
* Phokotsea (dates unknown)
* Kgabo I (late 17th century)
* Tebele (late 17th or early 18th century)

===Basotho line===

* first leader was Kgosi Nape.
* Napo begot and was succeeded by his son Motebang
* Motebang begot and was succeeded by his son Molemo
* Molemo begot and was succeeded by his son Tsoloane le Tsolo 
* Tsholoane begot and was succeeded by his son Monaheng
* Monaheng begot and was succeeded by his son Motloang
* Motloang begot and was succeeded by his son Peete
* Doc Mokoteli begot and was succeeded by his son Mokhachane
* Mokhachane begot and was succeeded by his son Moshoeshoe 
and it continues to the royal line of Lesotho.

===Batswana line===
Kgabo II led a small group of Bakwena and crossed the Madikwe River and founded a tribe on the lands of the Bakgatla tribe (whose totem was the blue monkey) which they drove away, modern day Botswana. As the result of a split, several tribes like the Ngwato and Ngwaketse.

* Kgabo II (until c. 1740)

<doc id="356410" wikidata="Q452404" url="?curid=356410" title="Tom Robbins">
<text>Thomas Eugene Robbins (July 22, 1932 – February 9, 2025) was an American novelist. His most notable works are &quot;seriocomedies&quot; (also known as &quot;comedy dramas&quot;). Robbins had lived in La Conner, Washington, since 1970, where he wrote nine of his books. His 1976 novel &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot; was adapted into the 1993 film version by Gus Van Sant. His last work, published in 2014, was &quot;Tibetan Peach Pie&quot;, a self-declared &quot;un-memoir&quot;.

==Early life==
Robbins was born on July 22, 1932, in Blowing Rock, North Carolina, to George Thomas Robbins and Katherine Belle Robinson. Both of his grandfathers were Southern Baptist preachers. The Robbins family lived in Blowing Rock before moving to Warsaw, Virginia, when the author was still a young boy. In adulthood, Robbins has described his young self as being a &quot;hillbilly&quot;.

Robbins attended Warsaw High School (class of 1949) and Hargrave Military Academy in Chatham, Virginia, where he won the Senior Essay Medal. The next year he enrolled at Washington and Lee University in Lexington, Virginia, to major in journalism, leaving at the end of his sophomore year after being disciplined by his fraternity for bad behavior and failing to earn a letter in basketball.

In 1953, he enlisted in the U.S. Air Force after receiving his draft notice, spending a year as a meteorologist in Korea, followed by two years in the Special Weather Intelligence unit of the Strategic Air Command in Nebraska. He was discharged in 1957 and returned to Richmond, Virginia, where his poetry readings at the Rhinoceros Coffee House led to his gaining a reputation on the local bohemian scene.

==Early media work==
In late 1957, Robbins enrolled at Richmond Professional Institute (RPI), a school of art, drama, and music, which later became Virginia Commonwealth University. He served as an editor and columnist for the college newspaper, &quot;Proscript&quot;, from 1958 to 1959. He also worked nights on the sports desk of the daily &quot;Richmond Times-Dispatch&quot;. After graduating with honors from RPI in 1959 and indulging in some hitchhiking, Robbins joined the staff of the &quot;Times-Dispatch&quot; as a copy editor.
In 1962, Robbins moved to Seattle to seek an M.A. at the Far East Institute of the University of Washington. During the next five years in Seattle (minus a year spent in New York City researching a book on Jackson Pollock) he worked for the &quot;Seattle Times&quot; as an art critic. In 1965, he wrote a column on the arts for &quot;Seattle Magazine&quot; as well as occasionally for &quot;Art in America&quot; and &quot;Artforum&quot;. Also during this time, he hosted a weekly alternative radio show, &quot;Notes from the Underground&quot;, at non-commercial KRAB-FM, Seattle. It was in 1967, while writing a review of the rock band The Doors, that Robbins said he found his literary voice. While working on his first novel, Robbins worked the weekend copy desk of the &quot;Seattle Post-Intelligencer&quot;. Robbins would remain in Seattle, on and off, for the following forty years.

==Writing career==
In 1966, Robbins was contacted by Doubleday&#x27;s West Coast editor, Luthor Nichols. Nichols asked Robbins about writing a book on Northwest art. Instead Robbins told Nichols he wanted to write a novel and pitched the idea of what was to become &quot;Another Roadside Attraction&quot;. In 1967, Robbins moved to South Bend, Washington, where he wrote his first novel. In 1970, Robbins moved to La Conner, Washington, and it was at his home on Second Street that he subsequently authored nine books (although, in the late 1990s, he spent two years living on the Swinomish Indian reservation).
In the 1980s and early 1990s, Robbins regularly published articles and essays in &quot;Esquire&quot; magazine, and also contributed to &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;The New York Times&quot;, and &quot;GQ&quot;.

Robbins&#x27;s 1982 contract with editor Alan Rinzler stipulated that he would accompany Robbins on three holiday trips to resorts Robbins would choose where he could discuss the work-in-progress novel. Rinzler later discovered it was &quot;Jitterbug Perfume&quot;. He later wrote this on the topic of editing for Robbins:

Tom would read out loud from his work in progress, and I would comment. Just a few pages at a time. He was a real southern gentleman, and welcomed intellectual discourse about his theme, characters, and intentions, from the inside. He took the process of conception, research, trial and error, moving things around, changing voices and pitch very seriously, wrote slowly and carefully, revised constantly, developing, refining and evolving this novel over the course of about two years.Michael Dare described Robbins&#x27;s writing style: &quot;When he starts a novel, it works like this. First he writes a sentence. Then he rewrites it again and again, examining each word, making sure of its perfection, finely honing each phrase until it reverberates with the subtle texture of the infinite. Sometimes it takes hours. Sometimes an entire day is devoted to one sentence, which gets marked on and expanded upon in every possible direction until he is satisfied. Then, and only then, does he add a period&quot;. When Robbins was asked to explain his &quot;gift&quot; for storytelling in 2002, he replied:

I&#x27;m descended from a long line of preachers and policemen. Now, it&#x27;s common knowledge that cops are congenital liars, and evangelists spend their lives telling fantastic tales in such a way as to convince otherwise rational people that they&#x27;re factual. So, I guess I come by my narrative inclinations naturally.

Over the course of his writing career, Robbins delivered readings on four continents, in addition to performances he gave at festivals from Seattle to San Miguel de Allende. Robbins also read at Bumbershoot in 2014.

==Recognition==
In 1997, Robbins won the Bumbershoot Golden Umbrella Award for Lifetime Achievement in the arts that is presented annually by the Bumbershoot arts festival in Seattle. In 2000, Robbins was named one of the 100 Best Writers of the 20th Century by &quot;Writer&#x27;s Digest&quot; magazine, while the legendary Italian critic Fernanda Pivano called Robbins &quot;the most dangerous writer in the world&quot;.

In October 2012, Robbins received the 2012 Literary Lifetime Achievement Award from the Library of Virginia. In 2015, he was awarded the Willamette Writers&#x27; Lifetime Achievement Award and received the award at the Gala Awards Event at the Willamette Writers Conference on August 8, 2015. On September 2, 2023, a &quot;King for a Day&quot; gala and parade was held in Robbins&#x27;s honor in his hometown of La Conner, Washington. The event also raised money for a children&#x27;s art program at the local library.

==Other activities==
During his brief stint in New York in 1965 Robbins joined the . In the mid-1960s, as a member of the Seattle Arts scene, Robbins reviewed art for several publications in Seattle, wrote essays for museum catalogs, organized gallery exhibits, and was the self-described ringleader in a &quot;boisterous neo-Dada gang of guerilla artists, the Shazam Society&quot;.

Robbins defended, in print, Indian mystic Osho, although he was never a follower. Robbins spent three weeks at ceremonial sites in Mexico and Central America with mythologist Joseph Campbell, and studied mythology in Greece and Sicily with the poet Robert Bly. Robbins also traveled to Timbuktu. Robbins was a member of the Marijuana Policy Project&#x27;s advisory board, alongside numerous other notable figures such as Jack Black, Ani DiFranco, Tommy Chong, and Jello Biafra; he was honoured at the Laureate Dinner of Seattle&#x27;s Rainier Club that has also recognized other local figures, such as Charles Johnson, Stephen Wadsworth, Timothy Egan and August Wilson; and he sat on the board of directors of The Greater Seattle Bureau of Fearless Ideas (formerly 826 Seattle), &quot;a nonprofit writing and tutoring center dedicated to helping youth, ages six to 18, improve their creative and expository writing skills, and to helping teachers inspire their students to write.&quot;

Madame Zoe, a Richmond psychic and palm reader who once lived in Richmond&#x27;s South Side, was fictionalized in Robbins&#x27;s &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot;. In 2016 Richmond artists Noah Scalin and Thea Duskin recreated her bedroom as an installation in the art gallery at Chop Suey Books in Carytown in Richmond. The novel &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot; was adapted into a film in 1993 by Gus Van Sant, starring Uma Thurman, Lorraine Bracco, and Keanu Reeves.

==Personal life and death==
Robbins was a friend of Terence McKenna, whose influence appears evident in a couple of his books. A main character (Larry Diamond) in &quot;Half Asleep in Frog Pajamas&quot; advocates a theory similar to those of McKenna, involving the history and cultural influences of psychedelic plants. Robbins also spent time with Timothy Leary and the author said that one of the protagonists in &quot;Jitterbug Perfume&quot; (Wiggs Dannyboy) exhibited certain characteristics of Leary&#x27;s personality; Robbins acknowledged using LSD with Leary.

He was friends with Gus Van Sant, and performed the voice-over narration in Van Sant&#x27;s film adaptation of &quot;Even Cowgirls Get the Blues&quot;. He was friends with directors Robert Altman and Alan Rudolph, as well, and had small speaking parts in five feature films.

Robbins lived in La Conner, Washington, and died there on February 9, 2025, at the age of 92.

<doc id="356412" wikidata="Q353971" url="?curid=356412" title="Tlôkwa people">
<text>The term Batlôkwa (also Batlokoa, or Badogwa) refers to several Kgatla communities that reside in Lesotho and South Africa. 

It comprises the followers of Tlôkwa kings and the members of clans identified as Tlôkwa, or individuals who identify themselves as of Tlôkwa descent. Most of the Batlôkwa clans trace their royal lineages to Kgwadi son of King Tabane, who was the father and founder of the Batlokwa nation. The Tlôkwa considers the Tlokwe-cat as their original totem which has since become extinct due to over-hunting for its fur, which was used by clan chiefs.

==Classification==
The Batlôkwa kingdom is part of the larger group of Bakgatla people, which is one of sub-divisions of the Bantu-speaking Tswana peoples. These different groups are often classified for convenience as &#x27;Sotho-Tswana&#x27;. This is because, from an early stage of their history, they shared a number of linguistic and cultural characteristics that distinguished them from other Bantu-speakers of southern Africa. Most prominent was mutually intelligible dialects. Other features included totemism, preferential marriage of maternal cousins with the exception to Batlôkwa who prefer marrying their paternal cousins, and an architectural style characterized by a round hut with a conical thatch roof supported by wooden pillars on the outside. Other commonalities included a style skin cloaks called &quot;mekgatlha&quot;, dense and close village settlements larger than those of &#x27;Nguni&#x27; peoples, and a tradition of building in stone in less grassy or wooded regions.

The history of the Basotho and Batswana people is one of continual dissension and fission where disputes, sometimes over kingship ascendancy, resulted in a section of the clan breaking away from the main clan, under the leadership of a dissatisfied king&#x27;s relative, and settling elsewhere. Often the name of the man who led the splinter group was taken as the new tribe&#x27;s name.

The traditions of the Batswana people point to a northward origin, and indicate that their southward movement was part of the great migrations of the Bantu-speaking iron-age peoples. Usually, the theory asserts that the Sotho-Tswana separated from other Bantu-speaking peoples in the vicinity of the Great Lakes of East Africa, and that they proceeded downwards along the western part of present-day Zimbabwe.

Some scholars caution against this classification of ethnic groupings since Africans are not homogeneous peoples. Paul Maylam stressed that there is a common tendency for the criteria used to label African groups &quot;to overlap between &#x27;different&#x27; societies so that it becomes virtually impossible to use all the major criteria at the same time to define nearly differing, self-contained entities.&quot;

==History==
Following the death of Masilo there was a leadership crisis that resulted in the formation of the Hurutshe and Kwena clans. The Batlôkwa claim lineage from the Hurutshe clan and traced their early ancestry to Mokgatla, the founder of the BaKgatla and Tabane.

Tabane fathered a son Matlaisane from his senior wife and five sons by his junior wife, Diale, Kgetsi, Kgwadi (Motlôkwa), Matsibolo, and Mosia. Each broke away to form Bapedi, Makgolokwe, Batlôkwa, Maphuthing and Basia respectively. Ten generations later, from Kgwadi, Montwedi, the son of Motonosi, fathered Mokotjo. Chief Mokotjo the father to Sekonyela died at an early age, so his mother, Manthatisi, was regent during his minority.

===Kgosi-kgolo Tsotetsi===

Kgosi-kgolo Tsotetsi (ca. 1735) was the paramount king of Batlôkwa ba Mokgalong, which was a senior branch of Batlokwa. He took over the reins after his father, Kgosi Seboloka, son of Mokgalo, died and he also, like most of the earlier chiefs, died at an early age, however by then he had already bore 6 sons by his Kgosihadi &#x27;Mamohlahlwe, namely Mohlahlwe (Lebaka), Tsibela, Selemane, Leloka, Sethati and Thai. At the time of his death, his successor Mohlahlwe was still a minor, and Batlokwa made a consensus that Queen Mamohlahlwe becomes regent for his son Lebaka. This, therefore, made her the first queen to act as a regent in the Batlokwa nation. Kgosihadi Mamohlahlwe was greatly assisted by her late husband&#x27;s siblings, namely Kganye son of Thekiso and Motonosi son of Makoro. These chiefs assisted very well in the chieftainship of Batlokwa until Queen Mamohlahlwe gave way to her son Lebaka who then became the paramount king of Batlokwa.

===Kgosihadi Manthatisi, wife of Kgosi Mokotjo===

Kgosihadi Manthatisi (ca. 1781–1836) was one of the best known, and most feared, women military and political leaders of the early 19th century. In the years of wars, migrations, and state-formation often referred to as the Mfecane or Difaqane, the Tlôkwa people were first known in English as the Mantatees, after Manthatisi&#x27;s name, in the literature of exploration, missions and empire.

Kgosihadi Manthatisi, the daughter of Chief Mothaba of the Basia people who were a sibling nation of Batlôkwa, in what later became the Harrismith (Thaba Ntshu) district of the Free State province of South Africa, was reportedly a tall, attractive woman. She married Mokotjo, the chief of the neighboring Batlôkwa, in a typical dynastic alliance, and is said to have borne him four sons. Mokotjo died while the heir, Sekonyela, was still too young to assume the chieftaincy, so Manthatisi acted as regent for Sekonyela.

After Mokotjo&#x27;s death the Batlôkwa ba Mokotleng faced military encroachments by the amaHlubi people who were fleeing their homes in neighboring Natal. Made refugees themselves, Manthatisi who was then a Regent for her son Sekonyela commanded the Tlôkwa into the Caledon valley, driving out other Sotho communities living there. Her troops seized the crops and cattle of the people they attacked, leaving a trail of destruction and devastation.

Her reign of military conquest extended as far as central modern day Botswana. At the height of her military and political power her army was estimated to contain forty thousand fighters. However, she eventually suffered a series of defeats beginning in Bechuanaland in January 1823. Peter Becker describes the developments during this period when he stated that:

&quot;Meanwhile Mmanthatisi was approaching with forty thousand men, women and children. It was January 1823, the time of the year crops were ripening and food was usually plentiful. But the Wild Cat People were compelled to live frugally, for so great had been the chaos brought about by difaqane/difetlwane in general and the plundering of Mmanthatisi, Mpangazita and Matiwane in particular that entire tribes had vanished from their settlements even before they had tilled their fields in preparation for planting. Indeed, the Central Plateau swarmed with hunger-stricken stragglers and small, detached parties of bandits. Apart from roots, bulbs and berries, there was little food to be found in the veld, certainly not enough to feed so large a horde as that of Mmanthatisi.&quot;

Nonetheless, the most prosperous of the Botswana chiefs, Makaba of the Bangwaketsi, made a firm decision not to surrender to Mmanthatisi without a struggle. Becker, described this in detail:

&quot;Meanwhile, the old Chief had decided not to surrender to Mmanthatisi without a fight. He called up every available warrior, garrisoned every pass leading to his capital, and with the guile for which he was famous, prepared traps into which he planned to lead his aggressors.

&quot;Since her flight from the Harrismith (Thaba Ntshu) district Mmanthatisi had managed to brush aside all opposition in the territories she traversed, but now in the stifling bushveld of Botswana, she was to come face to face with a foe whose fighting forces were as numerous as, and also better fed than, those of the Wild Cat People. The vanguard of Mmanthatisi&#x27;s army strode into ambuscades; large groups of men topped headlong into concealed pitfalls and met their death beneath volleys of barbed javelins. A battle broke out, in the course of which hundreds of the invaders were massacred. Before the situation could develop into a rout Mmanthatisi suddenly disengaged her armies and retreated with her hordes to the east. Thus Makaba became the first &quot;Sotho&quot; chief to repulse the formidable BaTlokwa (Wild Cat) Army, and to this day he is spoken of as the &#x27;Man of Conquest.&#x27;&quot;

Because of Manthatisi&#x27;s notoriety, all Sotho-Tswana raiders became known as “boo-Mmanthatisi”, or “Mantatee Horde” by the English. Known also as the “Destroyer of Nations”, she was only stopped from entering the Cape Colony by British Forces near Aliwal North. Eventually Manthatisi settled her people on the Marabeng Mountains.

After Mmanthatisi&#x27;s son Sekonyela reached maturity he took control of the baTlôkwa social structures and military.

===Kgosi Sekonyela===

Kgosi Sekonyela was born in 1804 near Harrismith next to the Wilge River. His mother sent him away from the Tlôkwa to protect him from political rivals. He rejoined the Tlôkwa in 1824, after his mother had led the Batlôkwa during the early Difaqane/difetlwane wars. Amidst the social and political chaos which gripped the present Free State and Lesotho regions, Sekonyela continued to build the Tlôkwa into a major military power. When the worst phase of the wars ended in the early 1830s, he settled on the naturally fortified mountains near the Caledon River.

Kgosi Sekonyela&#x27;s major rival for control of northern Lesotho was Moshoeshoe, the founder of the Basotho kingdom. For twenty years the two rivals raided each other and competed for adherents from among the many refugee bands in the region. Moshoeshoe – much the better diplomatist – gradually outstripped Sekonyela in numbers of supporters. In November, 1853 Moshoeshoe attacked and defeated Batlôkwa ba Mokotleng which Sekonyela fled to Winburg for asylum. After this defeat the people under Sekonyela disintegrated, some fled to Lesotho where they were absorbed into Moshoeshoe&#x27;s state, others to Eastern Cape with a substation portion fleeing north to present Tshwane region in Gauteng.

Sekonyela later obtained land in the Herschel district of the Eastern Cape where he died in 1856.

Kgosi Sekonyela&#x27;s downfall is commonly attributed to his personal defects. His love of war alienated his neighbours while his rough treatment alienated his own people. On the other hand, Moshoeshoe&#x27;s rise to power was attributed to his love of peace and to his benevolence.

==Geography==
The Batlôkwa clans reside in Botswana, Lesotho and South Africa; it is not known how many Batlôkwa there are since no census has been done.

===South Africa===
We recognize the late king Lesala as the last paramount king to have led the Batlokoa Ba Mokgalong, who was subsequently assassinated by the British colony for his 9000 cattle and for negotiating for a settlement to share his land. 

In South Africa, the Batlôkwa are found in significant numbers in six of the provinces, namely North West, Gauteng, Limpopo and the Free State, KwaZulu-Natal and Eastern Cape.

In the North West the Batlôkwa settled in the region called Tlôkwe near Potchefstroom. Batlôkwa are also found at Molatedi Village (Kgosi Matlapeng), Letlhakeng-Montsana Village (Kgosi Sedumedi), Tlokweng Village (Kgosi Motsatsi). They are part of the Setswana language grouping of the Sotho–Tswana. They arrived in the area in the 1820s and are not part of the Batlôkwa who had been led by Kgosi Sekonyela, as they had seceded at an earlier period. There is also scattering of the Batlôkwa found all over the North West Province.

In the Limpopo province, they are found in a place called boTlôkwa, north of Polokwane. Here the Batlôkwa are part of the North-Sotho language grouping. They arrived in the region after separating from the Batlôkwa who had fled to the Tshwane region after the defeat of Sekonyela by Moshoeshoe. The main Tlôkwa clan in the area is the Batlôkwa Ba Ga Machaka and Ramokgopa. The two had separated in a quarrel for chieftaincy, with Ramokgopa ultimately residing in the eastern regions called Mokomene, in Limpopo. Another grouping under Kgosi Manthata was moved to Mohodi next to Senwabarwana in 1977 also as a result of chieftaincy quarrels with Batlôkwa ba Mphakane under Kgosi Machaka.

These areas produced important people such as:
* Collins Ramusi
* Tumelo Mokoena 
* Tlou wa Raophala
* Hugh Masekela
* Gwen Ramokgopa
* Kgosiyentsho Ramokgopa
* Matome Zakea Seima, a writer, publisher and lawyer
* Kgalamadi Ramusi
* Babsy Selela 
* Mamphela Ramphele, Lehotlo Moshokoa, Caiphus Semenya
*Justice Bess Motsatsi-Nkabinde (retired Judge of the Constitutional Court of RSA)
* Maropene Ramokgopa 

In the Sesotho language grouping, the Batlôkwa are mainly found in the Eastern Free State region which is their area of jurisdiction with seven distinct Batlôkwa branches in the area, namely
* Batlôkwa ba Mokgalong (Tsotetsi)
* Batlôkwa ba Mota
* Batlôkwa ba Morakadu
* Batlôkwa ba Makalakeng
* Batlôkwa ba Nasatse Patso
* Batlôkwa ba Lehana
* Batlôkwa ba Masene

The above-mentioned branches of Batlôkwa still share similar cultural and linguistic elements in their respective areas. Batlokwa ba Mokgalong also known as Batlokwa ba Tsotetsi trace their descendency to Modungwane who was popularly known as Molefe who is the father of all the branches of Batlôkwa. Batlokwa ba Mokgalong are recognised by the Free State House of Traditional Leaders, and are still struggling to acquire back their land which was stolen by the colonialists under the then Black Administration Act, to be returned in 1991, with the recognition of Paramount Chief Lebaka David Tsotetsi. After the death of Chief Lebaka, his son Nkgahle Bert Tsotetsi took over, and mysteriously became recognised as a Senior Traditional Leader instead of his initial status of a Paramount Chief, in what seemed to be a political cover-up of the senior house of the Batlôkwa nation.

In KwaZulu-Natal, Batlôkwa are found in the Nqutu Municipality in a place called Maseseng, Mokgalong; which is named after Chief Lesesa who settled there in the late 1800s after the British requested assistance in the form of warriors from King Leteka of the Batlokwa ba Mokgalong. Leteka in response sent through his junior brother, Prince Lesesa, with his warriors, who joined the Batlokwa ba Mota who had already settled in the Nqutu area with the Hlubi, and together they succeeded in winning the battle and subsequently capturing King Cetshwayo of the Zulus. In return, the British signed a treaty with Batlôkwa to reside in the area, however as it was custom for the senior house to rule, Lesesa was supposed to be the leader of Batlôkwa in the area, however, he made an agreement with Mota to let him rule, as they had already been there before him and his people. Lesesa also played a pivotal role in the struggle to acquire land back from the colonialists, and in 1905 he was joined by Josiah Tshangana Gumede (ca. 1867–1946) and King Moloi of the Makgolokwe Tribe, who went to England in order to deliver a petition to the British Government, in order to try to acquire land back that was taken away from them before the Anglo-Boer War.

In the Eastern Cape, Batlôkwa are found in the Herschel and Mount Fletcher area under Chief Kakudi and Lehana respectively.

===Lesotho===
In Lesotho the Batlôkwa are one of the three main Sotho-Tswana clans who speak Sesotho. Their current Leader being Kgosi Ntjaqetho Sekonyela of Tlokoeng Mokhotlong District.

===Botswana===
Batlôkwa arrived in Botswana in 1887, settling in Moshwaneng on the Notwane River, after being led by Kgosi Gaborone from the Tshwane area in South Africa following the split with another Tlôkwa clan that went to settle in Batlôkwa north of Polokwane-Pietersburg. The land they settled in was given to them by Kgosi Sechele after they acknowledged the overlordship of the Bakwena. The capital of Botswana, Gaborone, is named after Kgosi Gaborone.

The Batlôkwa in Botswana are unique from the other Tlôkwa clans in that their totem is the &quot;thakadu&quot; (ant-bear). This totem was chosen after the Batlôkwa were in the wilderness and became thirsty and hungry. They found a catch of the daywater from the many holes dug by &quot;thakadu&quot;, which has been the totem since that time. Batlôkwa then started drinking from such holes and since then they decided that nobody should harm the ant bear and it must be protected at all costs.

During this time in the wilderness, Mmakgosi was expecting a child and after drinking water from one of the dugout holes, she gave birth to a son who was named Marakadu. She said that Marakadu was named after the &quot;thakadu&quot; - the saviour, adding that since then Batlôkwa agreed to change their totem from &quot;nkwe&quot; to &quot;thakadu&quot; and that is how they became dithakadu as they are known today. Marakadu then begot a son called Mosima, a hole dug by &quot;thakadu&quot; from which they obtained water. Mosima then begot a son called Motlhabane - who begot Mokgwa - a savanna shrub under which Mmakgosi delivered. Mokgwa then begot Taukobong. The name was chosen because there were no blankets and they opted for animal skins to keep warm. According to Kgosintwa, Taukobong had three sons from different wives named Makaba, Molefe, and Tshekiso. He said that this was the time when Batlôkwa were at Itlholanoga - the snake eye, near Rustenburg. While Makaba died without children, however he had engaged a woman called Nkae and to keep the royal lineage growing, Molefe from the second wife was called in to father children for Nkae. Molefe then bore three sons in the house of Makaba, namely Bogatsu, Phiri and Semele. Traditionally, the children were not his but his elder brothers Makaba. Molefe became the regent chief because Taukobong died while they were still young. However, when they had matured, Phiri suggested to his brother Bogatsu that they should take over the chieftainship from Molefe, this created enmity between the two with Phiri constantly plotting to kill Molefe. He said that sensing danger, Bogatsu then instructed Molefe to choose two of his favourite wards and ran away. In his determination to kill Molefe, he said, Phiri pursued and attacked Molefe but it was Phiri who was defeated and killed. Molefe did not return to Itlholanoga but continued with the journey until they arrived in Botswana where they asked for land to settle on from Kgosi Sechele of the Bakwena.

==Culture==
The Batlôkwa share similar customs and tradition as other Sotho-Tswana clans. Depending on the area that they live in the speak normally one three languages which are Setswana, Sesotho or Northern Sotho but mostly speak Sesotho. Sesotho, Northern Sotho and Setswana are largely mutually intelligible. Like most Africans, the Batlôkwa are adapting to a rapidly urbanising population and culture. In rural areas, traditional culture remains an important force in daily life. Customary law still plays a vital role, and their unique culture of marrying their paternal cousins. In each region&#x27;s urban areas, which are cosmopolitan, multi-racial and multi-cultural, western cultural norms are predominant.

<doc id="356413" wikidata="Q1420023" url="?curid=356413" title="Submersion (mathematics)">
<text>In mathematics, a submersion is a differentiable map between differentiable manifolds whose differential is everywhere surjective. This is a basic concept in differential topology. The notion of a submersion is dual to the notion of an immersion.

== Definition ==
Let &quot;M&quot; and &quot;N&quot; be differentiable manifolds and formula_1 be a differentiable map between them. The map is a submersion at a point formula_2 if its differential

:formula_3

is a surjective linear map. In this case is called a regular point of the map , otherwise, is a &quot;critical point&quot;. A point formula_4 is a regular value of if all points in the preimage formula_5 are regular points. A differentiable map that is a submersion at each point formula_2 is called a submersion. Equivalently, is a submersion if its differential formula_7 has constant rank equal to the dimension of .

A word of warning: some authors use the term &quot;critical point&quot; to describe a point where the rank of the Jacobian matrix of at is not maximal. Indeed, this is the more useful notion in singularity theory. If the dimension of is greater than or equal to the dimension of then these two notions of critical point coincide. But if the dimension of is less than the dimension of , all points are critical according to the definition above (the differential cannot be surjective) but the rank of the Jacobian may still be maximal (if it is equal to dim ). The definition given above is the more commonly used; e.g., in the formulation of Sard&#x27;s theorem.

== Submersion theorem ==
Given a submersion between smooth manifolds formula_8 of dimensions formula_9 and formula_10, for each formula_11 there are surjective charts formula_12 of formula_13 around formula_14, and formula_15 of formula_16 around formula_17, such that formula_18 restricts to a submersion formula_19 which, when expressed in coordinates as formula_20, becomes an ordinary orthogonal projection. As an application, for each formula_21 the corresponding fiber of formula_22, denoted formula_23 can be equipped with the structure of a smooth submanifold of formula_24 whose dimension is equal to the difference of the dimensions of formula_25 and formula_24.

The theorem is a consequence of the inverse function theorem (see Inverse function theorem#Giving a manifold structure).

For example, consider formula_27 given by formula_28 The Jacobian matrix is
:formula_29

This has maximal rank at every point except for formula_30. Also, the fibers
:formula_31

are empty for formula_32, and equal to a point when formula_33. Hence we only have a smooth submersion formula_34 and the subsets formula_35 are two-dimensional smooth manifolds for formula_36.

== Examples ==
* Any projection formula_37
* Local diffeomorphisms
* Riemannian submersions
* The projection in a smooth vector bundle or a more general smooth fibration. The surjectivity of the differential is a necessary condition for the existence of a local trivialization.

=== Maps between spheres ===
One large class of examples of submersions are submersions between spheres of higher dimension, such as
:formula_38
whose fibers have dimension formula_10. This is because the fibers (inverse images of elements formula_40) are smooth manifolds of dimension formula_10. Then, if we take a path
:formula_42
and take the pullback
:formula_43
we get an example of a special kind of bordism, called a framed bordism. In fact, the framed cobordism groups formula_44 are intimately related to the stable homotopy groups.

=== Families of algebraic varieties ===
Another large class of submersions are given by families of algebraic varieties formula_45 whose fibers are smooth algebraic varieties. If we consider the underlying manifolds of these varieties, we get smooth manifolds. For example, the Weierstrass family formula_46 of elliptic curves is a widely studied submersion because it includes many technical complexities used to demonstrate more complex theory, such as intersection homology and perverse sheaves. This family is given byformula_47where formula_48 is the affine line and formula_49 is the affine plane. Since we are considering complex varieties, these are equivalently the spaces formula_50 of the complex line and the complex plane. Note that we should actually remove the points formula_51 because there are singularities (since there is a double root).

== Local normal form ==
If is a submersion at and , then there exists an open neighborhood of in , an open neighborhood of in , and local coordinates at and at such that , and the map in these local coordinates is the standard projection
: formula_52

It follows that the full preimage in of a regular value in under a differentiable map is either empty or is a differentiable manifold of dimension , possibly disconnected. This is the content of the regular value theorem (also known as the submersion theorem). In particular, the conclusion holds for all in if the map is a submersion.

== Topological manifold submersions ==
Submersions are also well-defined for general topological manifolds. A topological manifold submersion is a continuous surjection such that for all in , for some continuous charts at and at , the map is equal to the projection map from to , where .

<doc id="356414" wikidata="Q156815" url="?curid=356414" title="Mohammed Rafi">
<text>Mohammed Rafi (24 December 1924 – 31 July 1980) was an Indian playback singer. He is considered to have been one of the greatest and most influential singers of the Indian subcontinent. Rafi was notable for his versatility and range of voice; his songs varied from fast peppy numbers to patriotic songs, sad numbers to highly romantic songs, qawwalis to ghazals and bhajans to classical songs. He was known for his ability to mould his voice to the persona and style of the actor lip-syncing the song on screen in the movie. He received six Filmfare Awards and one National Film Award. In 1967, he was honored with the Padma Shri award by the Government of India. In 2001, Rafi was honoured with the &quot;Best Singer of the Millennium&quot; title by Hero Honda and Stardust magazine. In 2013, Rafi was voted for the Greatest Voice in Hindi Cinema in the CNN-IBN&#x27;s poll.

He recorded songs for over a thousand Hindi films and in many Indian languages as well as some foreign languages, though primarily in Urdu and Punjabi, over which he had a strong command. He recorded as many as 7,000 songs throughout his career, spanning several languages such as Konkani, Assamese, Bhojpuri, Odia, Bengali, Marathi, Sindhi, Kannada, Gujarati, Tamil, Telugu, Magahi, Maithili, etc. Apart from Indian languages, he also sang in some foreign languages, including English, Persian, Arabic, Sinhala, Mauritian Creole, and Dutch.

==Early life==

Mohammed Rafi was the second eldest of six brothers born to Allah Rakhi and Haji Ali Mohammad in a Punjabi Jat Muslim family. The family originally belonged to Kotla Sultan Singh, a village near present-day Majitha in Amritsar district of Punjab, India. Rafi, whose nickname was &quot;Pheeko&quot;, began singing by imitating the chants of a fakir who roamed the streets of his native village Kotla Sultan Singh. Rafi&#x27;s father moved to Lahore in 1935, where he ran a men&#x27;s barbershop in Noor Mohalla in Bhati Gate.
Rafi learnt classical music from Ustad Abdul Wahid Khan, Pandit Jiwan Lal Mattoo and Firoze Nizami. His first public performance came at the age of 13, when he sang in Lahore featuring K. L. Saigal. In 1941, Rafi made his debut in Lahore as a playback singer in the duet &quot;Goriye Nee, Heeriye Nee&quot; with Zeenat Begum in the Punjabi film &quot;Gul Baloch&quot; (released in 1944) under music director Shyam Sunder. In that same year, Rafi was invited by All India Radio Lahore station to sing for them.

He made his Hindi film debut in &quot;Gaon Ki Gori&quot; in 1945.

== Early career in Bombay ==
Rafi moved to Bombay (now Mumbai), Maharashtra in 1944. He and Hameed Sahab rented a ten-by-ten-feet room in the crowded downtown Bhendi Bazar area. Poet Tanvir Naqvi introduced him to film producers including Abdur Rashid Kardar, Mehboob Khan and actor-director Nazeer. Shyam Sunder was in Bombay and provided the opportunity to Rafi to sing a duet with G. M. Durrani, &quot;Aji dil ho kaabu mein to dildar ki aisi taisi...,&quot; for &quot;Gaon Ki Gori&quot;, which became Rafi&#x27;s first recorded song in a Hindi film. Other songs followed.

Rafi&#x27;s first song with Naushad was &quot;Hindustan Ke Hum Hain&quot; with Shyam Kumar, Alauddin and others, from A. R. Kardar&#x27;s &quot;Pehle Aap&quot; (1944). Around the same time, Rafi recorded another song for the 1945 film &quot;Gaon Ki Gori&quot;, &quot;Aji Dil Ho Kaaboo Mein&quot;. He considered this song to be his first Hindi language song.

Rafi appeared in two movies. He appeared on the screen for the songs &quot;Tera Jalwa Jis Ne Dekha&quot; in film &quot;Laila Majnu&quot;(1945) and &quot;Woh Apni Yaad Dilane Ko&quot; in the Film &quot;Jugnu&quot; (1947). He sang a number of songs for Naushad as part of the chorus, including &quot;Mere Sapnon Ki Rani, Roohi Roohi&quot; with K. L. Saigal, from the film &quot;Shahjahan&quot; (1946). Rafi sang &quot;Tera Khilona Toota Balak&quot; from Mehboob Khan&#x27;s &quot;Anmol Ghadi&quot; (1946) and a duet with Noor Jehan in the 1947 film &quot;Jugnu&quot;, &quot;Yahan Badla Wafa Ka&quot;. After partition, Rafi decided to stay back in India and had the rest of his family flown to Bombay. Noor Jehan migrated to Pakistan and made a pair with playback singer Ahmed Rushdi.

In 1949, Rafi was given solo songs by music directors such as Naushad (&quot;Chandni Raat&quot;, &quot;Dillagi&quot; and &quot;Dulari&quot;), Shyam Sunder (&quot;Bazaar&quot;) and Husnalal Bhagatram (&quot;Meena Bazaar&quot;).

Besides K. L. Saigal, whom he considered his favorite, Rafi was also influenced by G. M. Durrani. In the early phase of his career, he often followed Durrani&#x27;s style of singing, but later evolved his own, unique style. He sang with Durrani in some of the songs such as &quot;Humko Hanste Dekh Zamana Jalta Hai&quot; and &quot;Khabar Kisi Ko Nahiin, Woh Kidhar Dekhte&quot; (&quot;Beqasoor&quot;, 1950).

In 1948, after the assassination of Mahatma Gandhi, the team of Husanlal Bhagatram-Rajendra Krishan-Rafi had overnight created the song &quot;Suno Suno Ae Duniyawalon, Bapuji Ki Amar Kahani&quot;. He was invited by the Indian Prime Minister, Jawaharlal Nehru, to sing at his house. In 1948, Rafi received a silver medal from Jawaharlal Nehru on Indian Independence Day.

==Recording career in the 1950s and 1960s==

In his early career, Rafi associated with many contemporary music directors, most notably Naushad Ali. In the late 1950s and 1960s, he worked with other composers of the era such as O. P. Nayyar, Shankar Jaikishan, S.D. Burman and Roshan.

===Work with Naushad===
As per Naushad, Rafi came to him with a letter of recommendation from Naushad&#x27;s father.
Rafi&#x27;s first song for Naushad Ali was &quot;Hindustan Ke Hum Hain&quot; (&quot;We belong to Hindustan&quot;) for the film &quot;Pehle Aap&quot; in 1944. The first song for the duo was the soundtrack of the movie &quot;Anmol Ghadi&quot; (1946).

Rafi&#x27;s association with Naushad helped the former establish himself as one of the most prominent playback singers in Hindi cinema. Songs from &quot;Baiju Bawra&quot; (1952) like &quot;O duniya ke rakhwale&quot; and &quot;Man tarpat hari darshan ko aaj&quot; furthered Rafi&#x27;s credentials. Rafi ended up singing a total of 149 songs (81 of them solo) for Naushad. Before Rafi, Naushad&#x27;s favorite singer was Talat Mahmood. Once Naushad found Talat smoking during a recording. He was annoyed and hired Rafi to sing all the songs of the movie &quot;Baiju Bawra&quot;.

===Work with S. D. Burman===
S. D. Burman used Rafi as a singing voice of Dev Anand and Guru Dutt. Rafi worked with Burman in 37 films, including &quot;Pyaasa&quot; (1957), &quot;Kaagaz Ke Phool&quot; (1959), &quot;Kala Bazar&quot; (1960), &quot;Nau Do Gyarah&quot; (1957), &quot;Kala Pani&quot; (1958), &quot;Tere Ghar Ke Saamne&quot; (1963), &quot;Guide&quot; (1965), &quot;Aradhana&quot; (1969), Ishq Par Zor Nahin (1970) and &quot;Abhimaan&quot; (1973).

===Work with Shankar–Jaikishan===
Rafi&#x27;s partnership with Shankar–Jaikishan was among the most famous and successful in the Hindi film industry. He worked with them from their first film, &quot;Barsaat&quot; (1949). Under Shankar–Jaikishan, Rafi produced some of his songs for actors like Shammi Kapoor and Rajendra Kumar. Out of six Filmfare awards, Rafi won three for S-J songs – &quot;Teri Pyaari Pyaari Surat Ko&quot;, &quot;Bahaaron Phool Barsaao&quot; and &quot;Dil Ke Jharokhe Mein.&quot; The song &quot;Yahoo! Chaahe Koi Mujhe Junglee Kahe&quot; was sung by Rafi, matched by a fast-paced orchestra and composition by Shankar Jaikishan. S-J had Rafi give playback for Kishore Kumar in the film &quot;Sharaarat&quot; (&quot;Ajab Hai Daastaan Teri Ye Zindagi&quot;). Rafi sang a total of 341 numbers—216 solo—for Shankar–Jaikishan. Among the films of this combination are: &quot;Awaara&quot;, &quot;Boot Polish&quot;, &quot;Basant Bahar&quot;, &quot;Professor&quot;, &quot;Junglee&quot;, &quot;Asli-Naqli&quot;, &quot;Rajkumar&quot;, &quot;Suraj&quot;, &quot;Sangam&quot;, &quot;Brahmachari&quot;, Arzoo, &quot;An Evening in Paris&quot;, &quot;Dil Tera Deewana&quot;, &quot;Yakeen&quot;, &quot;Prince&quot;, &quot;Love in Tokyo&quot;, &quot;Beti Bete&quot;, &quot;Dil Ek Mandir&quot;, &quot;Dil Apna Aur Preet Parai&quot;, &quot;Gaban&quot; and &quot;Jab Pyar Kisi Se Hota Hai&quot;.

===Work with Ravi===
Rafi got his first Filmfare Award for the title song of &quot;Chaudhvin Ka Chand&quot; (1960), composed by Ravi. He received the National Award for the song &quot;Baabul Ki Duaen Leti Jaa&quot; from the film &quot;Neel Kamal&quot; (1968), also composed by Ravi. Rafi wept during the recording of this song, which he admitted in a 1977 interview with the BBC.

Ravi and Rafi produced several other songs in the films &quot;China Town&quot; (1962), &quot;Kaajal&quot; (1965), &quot;Do Badan&quot; (1966) and Ek Phool Do Maali (1969)

===Work with Madan Mohan===
Madan Mohan was another composer whose favorite singer was Rafi. Rafi&#x27;s first solo with Madan Mohan in &quot;Aankhen&quot; (1950) was &quot;Hum Ishk Mein Burbaad Hein Burbaad Ruhenge&quot;. They teamed up to produce many songs including &quot;Teree Aankhon Ke Sivaa&quot;, &quot;Yeh Duniyaa Yeh Mehfil&quot;, &quot;Tum Jo Mil Guye Ho&quot;, &quot;Kur Chale Hum Fida&quot;, &quot;Meree Aawaaz Suno&quot; and &quot;Aap Ke Pehlu Mein Aakur&quot;.

===Work with O. P. Nayyar===
Rafi and O. P. Nayyar (OP) created music in the 1950s and 1960s. O. P. Nayyar was once quoted as saying &quot;If there had been no Mohammed Rafi, there would have been no O. P. Nayyar&quot;.

He and Rafi created many songs together including &quot;Yeh Hai Bombay Meri Jaan&quot;. He got Rafi to sing for singer-actor Kishore Kumar – &quot;Man Mora Baawara&quot; for the movie &quot;Raagini&quot;. Later, Rafi sang for Kishore Kumar in movies such as &quot;Baaghi&quot;, &quot;Shehzaada&quot; and &quot;Shararat&quot;. O. P. Nayyar used Rafi and Asha Bhosle for most of his songs. The team created many songs in the early 1950s and 1960s for movies such as &quot;Naya Daur&quot; (1957), &quot;Tumsa Nahin Dekha&quot; (1957), Ek Musafir Ek Hasina (1962) and &quot;Kashmir Ki Kali&quot; (1964). Rafi sang a total of 197 numbers (56 solo) for Nayyar.
The songs &quot;Jawaaniyan yeh mast mast&quot; and the title song &quot;Yun to humne lakh hansee dekhe hain, tumsa nahin dekha&quot; of the film &quot;Tumsa Nahin Dekha&quot; were hits. They were followed by songs like &quot;Yeh Chand Sa Roshan Chehera&quot; from &quot;Kashmir ki Kali&quot;.

Rafi and OP had a falling-out during the recording for movie &quot;Sawan ki Ghata&quot;. As disclosed by OP during one of his interviews; Rafi reported late to the recording stating that he was stuck in Shankar Jaikishan&#x27;s recording. OP then stated that from now on he too did not have the time for Rafi and cancelled the recording. They did not work together for the next 3 years.

===Work with Laxmikant-Pyarelal===
The composer duo Laxmikant–Pyarelal (L-P) patronized Rafi as one of their singers, right from their first song by him from the film &quot;Parasmani&quot; (1963). Rafi and L-P won the Filmfare Award for the song &quot;Chaahoonga Mein Tujhe Saanjh Suvere&quot; from &quot;Dosti&quot; (1964). Rafi rendered the highest number of songs for this music director duo Laxmikant-Pyarelal, as compared to all the music directors: 388.

Once, when composer Nisar Bazmi, who once worked with Laxmikant-Pyarelal before he had migrated to Pakistan, didn&#x27;t have enough money to pay him, Rafi charged a fee of one rupee and sang for him. He also helped producers financially. As Laxmikant once observed – &quot;He always gave without thinking of the returns&quot;.

=== Work with Kalyanji Anandji ===
Kalyanji Anandji composed around 170 songs in the voice of Rafi. Kalyanji&#x27;s relationship with Rafi started with the 1958 film, &quot;Samrat Chandragupta&quot;, his debut film as a solo composer. Kalyani-Anandji and Rafi went on to work together for the music of the Shashi Kapoor-starrer &quot;Haseena Maan Jayegi&quot; (1968), which featured songs like &quot;Bekhudi Mein Sanam&quot; and &quot;Chale The Saath Milke&quot;.

===Work with contemporary singers===
Rafi associated with several of his contemporaries, singing duets with them and sometimes for them (as in case of Kishore Kumar who was also an actor).
Rafi sang the highest number of duets with Asha Bhosle (female), Manna Dey (male) and Lata Mangeshkar (female).

In the song &quot;Humko Tumse Ho Gaya Hai Pyaar&quot; (&quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot;), Rafi sang one song with Kishore Kumar, Lata Mangeshkar, and Mukesh, the most legendary singers in Bollywood. This was probably the only time that all of them rendered their voices for one song.

=== Work with other music directors ===
Rafi sang frequently for all music directors during his lifetime, including C. Ramchandra, Roshan, Jaidev, Khayyam, Rajesh Roshan, Ravindra Jain, Bappi Lahiri, Sapan Jagmohan, T.V.Raju, S.Hanumantha Rao etc. He had a special and major association with Usha Khanna, Sonik Omi, Chitragupta, S.N. Tripathi, N. Datta and R.D. Burman. He also sang for many small time and lesser-known music directors. Many for whom he sang for free while making their compositions immortal; he selflessly believed in financially assisting producers and helping small-time projects who could not afford much. Many in the industry received regular financial help from Rafi.

===Private albums===
Rafi sang several songs in Chris Perry&#x27;s Konkani album Golden Hits with Lorna Cordeiro. He recorded many private albums in various genres and languages. Rafi recorded Hindi songs in English on 7&quot; release in 1968. He also sang 2 songs in Mauritian Creole while on his visit to Mauritius in the late 1960s.

===Royalty issue===
In 1962–1963, the popular female playback singer Lata Mangeshkar raised the issue of playback singers&#x27; share in the royalties. Recognizing Rafi&#x27;s position as the leading male playback singer, she wanted him to back her in demanding a half-share from the 5% song royalty that the film&#x27;s producer conceded to select composers. Rafi refused to side with her, stating that his claim on the film producer&#x27;s money ended with his being paid his agreed fee for the song. Rafi argued that the producer takes financial risk and the composer creates the song, so the singer does not have any claim over the royalty money. Lata viewed his stand as a stumbling block on the royalty issue and stated that it is because of the singer&#x27;s name also that the records get sold. This difference of opinion subsequently led to differences between the two. During the recording of &quot;Tasveer Teri Dil Mein&quot; (&quot;Maya&quot;, 1961), Lata argued with Rafi over a certain passage of the song. Rafi felt belittled, as music director Salil Chowdhury sided with Lata. The situation worsened when Lata declared that she would no longer sing with Rafi. Rafi stated that he was only so keen to sing with Lata as she was with him. The music director Jaikishan later negotiated a reconciliation between the two. In an interview given to The Times of India on 25 September 2012, Lata claimed to have received a written apology from Rafi. However, Shahid Rafi, Mohammad Rafi&#x27;s son, rebuffs the claim, calling it an act to dishonour his father&#x27;s reputation.

==Early 1970s==

In the 1970s, Rafi suffered from a throat infection for an extended period of time. During a brief period then, he recorded fewer songs. Although his musical output was relatively low during this period, Rafi did sing some of his best and most popular numbers then, such as &quot;Yeh Duniya Yeh Mehfil&quot;, &quot;Gulabi Aankhen&quot;, &quot;Jhilmil Sitaron Ka Aangan Hoga&quot;, &quot;Koi Nazrana Lekar Aaya Hu&quot;, &quot;Aaya Re Khilonewala&quot;, &quot;Tum Mujhe Yun Bhula Na Paaoge&quot;, &quot;Re Mama Re Mama Re&quot;, &quot;Nafrat Ki Duniya Ko&quot;, &quot;Ye Jo Chilman Hai&quot;, &quot;Kuchh Kehta Hai Ye Saawan&quot;, &quot;Kitna Pyaara Wada&quot;, &quot;Chalo Dildaar Chalo&quot;, &quot;Aaj Mausam Bada Be-Imaan Hai&quot;, &quot;Chura Liya Hai Tumne&quot;, &quot;Yaadon Ki Baaraat Nikli Hai Aaj Dil Ke Dwaare&quot;, &quot;Teri Bindiya Re&quot;, to name a few.

==Later years==
Rafi made a comeback as a leading singer in mid 1970s. In 1974 he won the Film World magazine Best Singer Award for the song &quot;Teri Galiyon Mein Na Rakhenge Kadam Aaj Ke Baad&quot; (Hawas, 1974) composed by Usha Khanna.

In 1976, Rafi sang all the songs for Rishi Kapoor in the blockbuster film &quot;Laila Majnu&quot;. Rafi went on to sing many more songs for Rishi Kapoor in the subsequent hit films, including &quot;Hum Kisise Kum Naheen&quot; (1977) and &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot; (1977). In 1977, he won both Filmfare Award and the National Award for the song &quot;Kya Hua Tera Wada&quot; from the movie &quot;Hum Kisise Kum Naheen&quot;, composed by R. D. Burman. He was nominated as the best singer at the Filmfare Awards for the qawwali &quot;Parda Hai Parda&quot; from &quot;Amar Akbar Anthony&quot; (1977).

Rafi sang for many successful films in the late 1970s and the early 1980s many of whose hit songs were dominating the charts in the late 70s on radio programs such as &quot;Vividh Bharati, Binaca Geetmala and Radio Ceylon.&quot; Some of these include &quot;Pratiggya&quot; (1975), &quot;Bairaag&quot; (1976), &quot;Amaanat&quot; (1977), &quot;Dharam Veer&quot; (1977), &quot;Apnapan&quot; (1977), &quot;Ganga Ki Saugand&quot; (1978), &quot;Suhaag&quot; (1979), &quot;Sargam&quot; (1979), &quot;Qurbani&quot; (1980), &quot;Dostana&quot; (1980), &quot;Karz&quot; (1980), &quot;The Burning Train&quot; (1980), &quot;Abdullah&quot; (1980), &quot;Shaan&quot; (1980), &quot;Aasha&quot; (1980), &quot;Aap To Aise Na The&quot; (1980), &quot;Naseeb&quot; (1981) and &quot;Zamaane Ko Dikhana Hai&quot; (1981). In 1977, Rafi gave a performance at the Royal Albert Hall and in 1980 he performed at the Wembley conference centre. From 1970 until his death he toured around the world extensively giving concert performances to packed halls.

In December 1979, Rafi recorded six songs for the Hindi remake of Dilip Sen&#x27;s Bengali superhit &quot;Sorry Madam&quot;; the film was never completed due to a personal tragedy in Dilip Sen&#x27;s life. These songs, written by Kafeel Aazar and composed by Chitragupta, were released digitally in December 2009 by the label Silk Road under the title &quot;The Last Songs&quot;. The physical album was released only in India by Universal.

===Guinness World Records controversy===
During his last years, Rafi was involved in a controversy over Lata Mangeshkar&#x27;s entry in the Guinness Book of World Records. In a letter dated 11 June 1977 to the Guinness Book of World Records, Rafi had challenged the claim that Lata Mangeshkar has recorded the highest number of songs (&quot;not less than 25,000&quot; according to Guinness). Rafi, according to his fans, would have sung more songs than Lata – he being the senior of the two. They estimated the number of songs sung by Rafi to be anything from 25,000 to 26,000. This prompted Rafi to write a letter, in protest, to Guinness. After receiving a reply from Guinness, in a letter dated 20 November 1979, he wrote, &quot;I am disappointed that my request for a reassessment vis-a-vis Ms Mangeshkar&#x27;s reported world record has gone unheeded.&quot; In an interview to BBC recorded in November 1977, Rafi claimed to have sung 25,000 to 26,000 songs till then.

After Rafi&#x27;s death, in its 1984 edition, the Guinness Book of World Records gave Lata Mangeshkar&#x27;s name for the &quot;Most Recordings&quot; and stated, &quot;Mohammad Rafi (d 1 August 1980) claimed to have recorded 28,000 songs in 11 Indian languages between 1944 and April 1980.&quot; The Guinness Book entries for both Rafi and Lata were eventually deleted in 1991. In 2011, Lata&#x27;s sister Asha Bhosle was given the title.

&quot;Mohammed Rafi – Golden Voice of the Silver Screen&quot;, a 2015 book by Shahid Rafi and Sujata Dev, states that according to &quot;industry sources&quot;, Rafi sang 4,425 Hindi film songs, 310 non-Hindi film songs, and 328 non-film songs between 1945 and 1980. A 2015 &quot;Manorama Online&quot; article states that &quot;researchers&quot; have found 7,405 songs sung by Rafi.

Among the prominent leading actors of his time, Rafi sung 190 songs for Shammi Kapoor, 155 for Johnny Walker, 129 for Shashi Kapoor, 114 for Dharmendra, 100 for Dev Anand and 77 for Dilip Kumar.

==Death==
Mohammed Rafi died at 10:25 pm on 31 July 1980, following a massive heart attack, aged 55. The last song sung by Rafi was for the movie &quot;Aas Paas&quot;, with music by Laxmikant-Pyarelal. One source says it was &quot;Shaam Phir Kyun Udaas Hai Dost/Tu Kahin Aas Paas Hai Dost&quot;, recorded just hours before his death. Another source says that the last song he sang was &quot;Shehar mein charcha hai&quot;, from the same film.

Rafi was buried at the Juhu Muslim cemetery and his burial was one of the largest funeral processions in India as over 10,000 people attended his burial. The government of India announced a two-day public mourning in his honour.

In 2010, Rafi&#x27;s tomb along with many film industry artists such as Madhubala, was demolished to make space for new burials. Fans of Mohammed Rafi, who visit his tomb twice a year to mark his birth and death anniversaries, use the coconut tree that is nearest to his grave as a marker.

==Legacy==

Rafi&#x27;s style of singing influenced singers like Kavita Krishnamurti, Mahendra Kapoor, Mohammed Aziz, Shabbir Kumar, Udit Narayan, Sonu Nigam, and S. P. Balasubrahmanyam. Anwar also imitated Rafi&#x27;s voice.

On 22 September 2007, a shrine to Rafi designed by artist Tasawar Bashir was unveiled on Fazeley Street, Birmingham, UK. Bashir is hoping that Rafi will attain sainthood as a result. The Padma Shri Mohammed Rafi Chowk in the Bandra suburbs of Mumbai and Pune (extending MG Road) is named after Rafi.

In the summer of 2008, the City of Birmingham Symphony Orchestra released a double CD titled &quot;Rafi Resurrected,&quot; comprising 16 songs by Rafi. Bollywood playback singer Sonu Nigam provided the vocals for this project and toured with the CBSO in July 2008 at venues including the English National Opera in London, Manchester&#x27;s Apollo Theatre, and Symphony Hall, Birmingham.

There have been appeals to the Government of India to honour the singer, posthumously, with the Bharat Ratna (India&#x27;s Highest Civilian Award).

In June 2010, Rafi, along with Mangeshkar, was voted the most popular playback singer in the poll, conducted by &quot;Outlook&quot; magazine. The same poll voted &quot;Man re, tu kahe na dheer dhare&quot; (&quot;Chitralekha&quot;, 1964), sung by Rafi, as the No. 1 song. Three songs were tied for the No. 2 spot; two were sung by Rafi. The songs were &quot;Tere mere sapne ab ek rang hain&quot; (&quot;Guide&quot;, 1965) and &quot;Din dhal jaye, hai raat na jaye&quot; (&quot;Guide&quot;, 1965). The jury included people in the Indian music industry.

In 2015, the UK-based newspaper &quot;Eastern Eye&quot; placed Rafi third in their &quot;Greatest 20 Bollywood Playback Singers&quot; list.

An official biography was written on Rafi&#x27;s life by Sujata Dev titled &quot;Mohammed Rafi – Golden Voice of the Silver Screen&quot; launched on his 91st birthday. As well as an award winning documentary titled &quot;Dastaan-E-Rafi&quot; directed by Rajni Acharya and Vinay Patel (which took 5 years to make) was released to commemorate his 92nd birthday which was later released on DVD. It featured over 60 interviews of various Bollywood personas and closely recalled his story through his songs and the personal recounts. Many biographies and documentaries continue to be written and made on him.

Lata Mangeshkar, his contemporary, has said that &quot;Rafi bhaiya was not only India&#x27;s greatest playback singer but also a wonderful person&quot; and that &quot;he was one singer whose vocal range could outclass any other singer, whether it was me, Asha, Mannada or Kishore bhaiya&quot;.

When producer-director Manmohan Desai (who was a big fan of Rafi) and used him in numerous hit films, was asked to describe the voice of Rafi he remarked that &quot;If anyone has the voice of god, it is Mohammed Rafi&quot;.

Annually his birth and death anniversaries inspire several thousand musical tributes on stage, radio and television.

Rafi&#x27;s popularity today spans across the Indian subcontinent, having a reach to Indian communities in Singapore and Malaysia.

Today, Rafi&#x27;s popular songs continue to be remixed or recreated.

Rafi&#x27;s &quot;Baharon Phool Barsao&quot; was voted the most popular Hindi song in a BBC Asia Network poll commemorating 100 years of Hindi Cinema.

In a CNN-IBN survey in 2013, he was voted the greatest voice of Hindi Cinema.

In 2001, Rafi was named as the &quot;best singer of the millennium&quot; by Hero Honda and Stardust magazine.

The film opens with the lead character dancing around in her bedroom to a video of &quot;Gumnaam&quot;. The song has also been used for Heineken&#x27;s 2011 &quot;The Date&quot; commercial.
* Rafi was commemorated on his 93rd birth anniversary by Search Engine Google which showed a special doodle on its Indian home page for him on 24 December 2017.
* His &quot;Aaj Mausam Bada Beiman Hai&quot; is featured in the 2001 film &quot;Monsoon Wedding&quot;. His &quot;Kya Mil Gaya&quot; (&quot;Sasural&quot;, 1961) has been used in &quot;The Guru&quot; (2002), where Ramu and Sharonna sing a version of the song. His song &quot;Mera Man Tera Pyasa&quot; (&quot;Gambler&quot;, 1970) has been used as one of the soundtracks in the Jim Carrey-Kate Winslet starrer &quot;Eternal Sunshine of the Spotless Mind&quot; (2004). This song is played in the background in Kate Winslet&#x27;s character&#x27;s home while the lead pair are having a drink (at approximately 00.11.14 runtime).

==Personal life==
Rafi married twice; his first marriage was to his cousin, Bashira Bibi, which took place in his ancestral village. The marriage ended when his first wife refused to live in India following the killing of her parents during the riots of the Partition of India and moved to Lahore, Pakistan. His second marriage was to Bilquis Bano.

Rafi had four sons and three daughters; his first son, Saeed, was from his first marriage. Rafi&#x27;s hobbies included playing badminton, carrom, and flying kites. He was a teetotaller and abstained from smoking and he stayed away from parties in the industry.

According to &quot;Mohammed Rafi Voice of a Nation&quot;, a book authorised by Rafi&#x27;s son Shahid, described him as &quot;a gentle, and calm demeanour persona who remained humble, selfless, ego-less, devoted, God-fearing, and family-loving gentleman in his life.&quot; Rafi was noted for not sending anyone he met back empty-handed. He contributed to the society by helping people through his charity and notable deeds.

<text>Computer-aided maintenance (not to be confused with CAM which usually stands for Computer Aided Manufacturing) refers to systems that utilize software to organize planning, scheduling, and support of maintenance and repair. A common application of such systems is the maintenance of computers, either hardware or software, themselves. It can also apply to the maintenance of other complex systems that require periodic maintenance, such as reminding operators that preventive maintenance is due or even predicting when such maintenance should be performed based on recorded past experience.

==Computer aided configuration==
The first computer-aided maintenance software came from DEC in the 1980s to configure VAX computers. The software was built using the techniques of artificial intelligence expert systems, because the problem of configuring a VAX required expert knowledge. During the research, the software was called &quot;R1&quot; and was renamed &quot;XCON&quot; when placed in service. Fundamentally, &quot;XCON&quot; was a rule-based &quot;configuration database&quot; written as an expert system using forward chaining rules. As one of the first expert systems to be pressed into commercial service it created high expectations, which did not materialize, as DEC lost commercial pre-eminence. 

==Help Desk software==
Help desks frequently use help desk software that captures symptoms of a bug and relates them to fixes, in a &quot;fix database&quot;. One of the problems with this approach is that the understanding of the problem is embodied in a non-human way, so that solutions are not unified.

==Strategies for finding fixes==
#The &quot;bubble-up&quot; strategy simply records pairs of symptoms and fixes. The most frequent set of pairs is then presented as a tentative solution, which is then attempted. If the fix works, that fact is further recorded, along with the configuration of the presenting system, into a &quot;solutions database&quot;.
#Oddly enough, shutting down and booting up again manages to &#x27;fix,&#x27; or at least &#x27;mask,&#x27; a bug in many computer-based systems; thus &quot;reboot&quot; is the remedy for distressingly many symptoms in a &#x27;fix database.&#x27; The reason a reboot often works is that it causes the RAM to be flushed. However, typically the same set of actions are likely to create the same result demonstrating a need to refine the &quot;startup&quot; applications (which launch into memory) or install the latest fix/patch of the offending application.
#Currently, most expertise in finding fixes lies in human domain experts, who simply sit at a replica of the computer-based system, and who then &#x27;talk through&#x27; the problem with the client to duplicate the problem, and then relate the fix.

<text>The secretary of state for culture, media and sport, also referred to as the culture secretary, is a secretary of state in the Government of the United Kingdom, with overall responsibility for strategy and policy across the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. The incumbent is a member of the Cabinet of the United Kingdom. The office has been dubbed &quot;Minister of Fun&quot;.

== Responsibilities ==
The secretary has overall responsibility for strategy and policy across the Department for Culture, Media and Sport. Responsibilities include:
* Arts and Culture
* Broadcasting
* Creative industries
* Creative Industries Council
* Cultural property, heritage and the historic environment
* Cultural Renewal Taskforce
* Culture, sports and arts sector recovery from COVID-19
* Gambling and racing
* Libraries
* Media ownership and mergers
* Museums and galleries
* The National Lottery
* Sport
* Tourism

== History ==
The office was created in 1992 by Prime Minister John Major, as Secretary of State for National Heritage. In his autobiography, Major says that, before the office was created, responsibility for cultural interests was shared among various departments, but important to none of them. For instance, arts and libraries, although a separate department, had no minister in the Cabinet, sport was part of the Department for Education, film was part of the Department of Trade and Industry, broadcasting was part of the Home Office, tourism was part of the Department for Employment and heritage was part of the Department of the Environment. He also wrote that the system tended to favour the interests of the articulate and well-connected London-based arts lobby.

Thus, when he became Prime Minister, Major said that he saw that the only way to give culture and sport the higher profile that he thought that they deserved was to establish a new department, under a minister of Cabinet rank, to bring together all aspects of the arts, sport and heritage.

Like previous &quot;Metroid&quot; games, &quot;Fusion&quot; is a side-scrolling game with platform jumping, shooting, and puzzle elements. It introduces mission-based progression that guides the player through certain areas. It was released on the same day as the GameCube game &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; in North America; both games can be linked using the GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable to unlock additional content for &quot;Prime&quot;.

&quot;Fusion&quot; was acclaimed for its gameplay, controls, graphics and music, though its shorter length and greater linearity received some criticism. It received several awards, including &quot;Handheld Game of the Year&quot; from the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences, &quot;Best Game Boy Advance Adventure Game&quot; from &quot;IGN&quot;, and &quot;Best Action Game on Game Boy Advance&quot; from &quot;GameSpot&quot;. It was rereleased on the Nintendo 3DS&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2011 as part of the 3DS Ambassador Program, the Wii U&#x27;s Virtual Console in 2014, and the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack in 2023. A sequel, &quot;Metroid Dread&quot;, was released in 2021 for the Nintendo Switch.

==Gameplay==
&quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; is an action-adventure game in which the player controls Samus Aran. Like previous games in the series, &quot;Fusion&quot; is set in a large open-ended world with elevators that connect regions, which each in turn contains rooms separated by doors. Samus opens most doors by shooting at them, while some only open after she reaches a certain point. &quot;Fusion&quot; is more linear than other &quot;Metroid&quot; games due to its focus on storyline; for example, &quot;Fusion&quot; introduces Navigation Rooms, which tell the player where to go.

The gameplay involves solving puzzles to uncover secrets, platform jumping, shooting enemies, and searching for power-ups that allow Samus to reach new areas. Samus can absorb X Parasites, which restore health, missiles, and bombs. Power-ups are obtained by downloading them in Data Rooms or absorbing a Core-X, which appears after defeating a boss. New features include the ability to grab ledges and climb ladders.

The player can use the GameCube – Game Boy Advance link cable to connect to &quot;Fusion&quot; and unlock features in &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;: after completing &quot;Prime&quot;, they can unlock Samus&#x27;s Fusion Suit, and after completing &quot;Fusion&quot;, they can unlock an emulated version of the first &quot;Metroid&quot; game. In &quot;&quot; (2004), players can connect to &quot;Fusion&quot; using the Game Boy Advance Game Link Cable to unlock a &quot;Fusion&quot; picture gallery, which includes its ending images.

==Plot==
Bounty hunter Samus Aran explores the surface of the planet SR388 with a survey crew from Biologic Space Laboratories (BSL). She is attacked by parasitic organisms known as X. On returning to the BSL station, Samus loses consciousness, and her ship crashes. The BSL ship she was escorting recovers her body and transfers it to the Galactic Federation for medical treatment, who discover that the X has infected Samus&#x27; central nervous system. They cure her with a vaccine made from cells taken from the infant Metroid that Samus adopted on SR388. The vaccine gives her the ability to absorb the X nuclei for nourishment, but burdens her with the Metroids&#x27; vulnerability to cold. Portions of Samus&#x27;s infected Power Suit are sent to the BSL station for examination, although the suit was too integrated with her body to remove entirely during surgery.

When Samus recovers consciousness, she discovers an explosion occurred at the BSL station and is sent to investigate. The mission is overseen by her new gunship&#x27;s computer, whom Samus nicknames &quot;Adam&quot; after her former commanding officer, Adam Malkovich. Samus learns that the X parasites can replicate their hosts&#x27; physical appearances, and that the X have infected the station with the help of the &quot;SA-X&quot;, an X parasite mimicking Samus at full power.

Samus avoids the SA-X and explores the space station, defeating larger creatures infected by the X to recover her abilities. She discovers a restricted lab containing Metroids, and the SA-X sets off the labs&#x27; auto-destruct sequence while also attacking the released Metroids, who also devour the SA-X. Samus escapes, but the lab is destroyed. The computer berates Samus for ignoring orders and admits that the Federation was secretly using the lab to breed Metroids. It also reveals that the SA-X has asexually reproduced, subsequently cloning itself. The computer advises Samus to leave the station.

On her way to her ship, the computer orders Samus to leave the rest of the investigation to the Federation, which plans to capture SA-X for military purposes. Knowing that the X would only infect the arriving Federation troops and absorb their spacefaring knowledge to conquer the universe, Samus states her intention to destroy the station. Although the computer initially intends to stop Samus, she calls it &quot;Adam&quot;, and reveals that Adam died saving her life. The computer suggests that she should alter the station&#x27;s propulsion to intercept with SR388 and destroy the planet along with all X populations. Samus realizes that the computer is the consciousness of Adam, uploaded after his death. En route to initiate the propulsion sequence, an SA-X confronts Samus, who defeats it and sets the BSL station on a collision course with SR388. As Samus prepares to leave, she is attacked by an Omega Metroid. The SA-X appears and attacks it, but is destroyed; Samus absorbs its nucleus and uses her newly restored Ice Beam to destroy the Omega Metroid. Her ship arrives, piloted by creatures Samus rescued from the station&#x27;s Habitation Deck. They escape before the station crashes into the planet, destroying it.

==Development==

Nintendo confirmed a &quot;Metroid&quot; game for the Game Boy Advance in March 2001. Ken Lobb, Nintendo of America&#x27;s director of game development, said that it is a new game and not a port of the 1994 Super NES game &quot;Super Metroid&quot;. Early footage was shown at the 2001 E3 convention under the name &quot;Metroid IV&quot;. The footage showed Samus in a dark suit, running on walls and ceilings, with simpler, more &quot;Game Boy Color-like&quot; graphics. At E3 2002, Nintendo demonstrated the game again, now under the title &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot;, with updated graphics. &quot;IGN&quot; awarded &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; Best of Show and Best Action Game.

&quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; was developed by Nintendo Research &amp; Development 1 (R&amp;D1), the same team that created &quot;Super Metroid&quot;. &quot;Fusion&quot;″s gameplay, screen layout, and controls mimic those of &quot;Super Metroid&quot;, with enhancements. &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; is the first 2D &quot;Metroid&quot; game with animated cutscenes; the story is revealed through text and close-ups. It was written and directed by series designer Yoshio Sakamoto, and produced by Takehiro Izushi.

Sakamoto decided to create an original story instead of remaking a &quot;Metroid&quot; game because he wanted to do &quot;something really unprecedented&quot;, and looked forward to the response. &quot;Fusion&quot; introduces gameplay mechanics such as a more direct, almost mission-based structure that supports the player to explore areas. Objectives are also flexible in how they can be completed, acting &quot;more as a guide for what the player should do instead of giving a completely blank map and saying &#x27;Here you go, figure out what to do and how to do it.

According to the lead programmer, Katsuya Yamano, Nintendo R&amp;D1 did not consult previous &quot;Metroid&quot; games for programming techniques, and instead used their previous game &quot;Wario Land 4&quot; as a reference. Samus&#x27;s suit design was revamped; the canonical explanation is that this was because an X Parasite had attacked Samus and made her lose all her abilities. Missiles were expanded with two &quot;upgrades&quot;, much like the various beam upgrades: the Ice Missile which has a similar effect to the Ice Beam, and the Diffusion Missile which greatly increases the blast radius. Other minor abilities were added to &quot;Fusion&quot;, such as climbing walls and ceilings. The health and missile drops are replaced by X Parasites that are similarly released after defeating enemies.

The music was composed by Minako Hamano and Akira Fujiwara. According to Hamano, Sakamoto wanted her to create music in accordance with Adam&#x27;s dialogue. Hamano aimed for &quot;serious, ambient music rather than melody&quot; because she did not want the exploration themes to be &quot;annoying&quot;. She also rearranged jingles from &quot;Super Metroid&quot; for &quot;Fusion&quot;. As Nintendo of America wanted the developers to look for &quot;Hollywood-like&quot; voice actors, Hamano added a voice of an announcer. The developers planned to feature voice acting, but the voices were only used for warning announcements due to ROM cartridge limitations.

==Release==
&quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; was released in North America on November 18, 2002. &quot;Fusion&quot; can be connected to &quot;Metroid Prime&quot; for the GameCube, a &quot;Metroid&quot; game that was released on the same day as &quot;Fusion&quot;. In Europe, &quot;Fusion&quot; was released on November 22, followed by the Australian release on November 29. It was released in Japan on February 14, 2003, and in China on March 2, 2006.

A two-disc soundtrack album, &quot;Metroid Prime &amp; Fusion Original Soundtracks&quot;, was published by Scitron on June 18, 2003. The second disc contains tracks from &quot;Fusion&quot;, along with an additional track arranged by Shinji Hosoe.

&quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; was released on the Nintendo 3DS Virtual Console in December 2011 as part of the &quot;3DS Ambassadors&quot; program, one of ten Game Boy Advance games for those who purchased their 3DS consoles before a price drop. &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; was among the first three Game Boy Advance games to be released on the Wii U Virtual Console in April 2014. It was released on the Nintendo Switch Online + Expansion Pack service in March 2023. A sequel, &quot;Metroid Dread&quot;, was released in 2021 for the Nintendo Switch.

==Reception==
&quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; received &quot;universal acclaim&quot; according to review aggregator Metacritic. The Japanese magazine &quot;Famitsu&quot; gave it 34 out of 40. &quot;X-Play&quot; said it was a &quot;pleasure to play&quot;, and praised its &quot;beautiful&quot; graphics and audio. &quot;IGN&quot; praised it as an &quot;outstanding achievement on the Game Boy Advance&quot;. &quot;GamesRadar&quot; and &quot;GamePro&quot; felt that &quot;Fusion&quot; was too short, but &quot;love[d] every minute of it&quot;, finding the hidden secrets and new power-ups &quot;sublimely ingenious&quot;. &quot;GameSpot&quot; was disappointed that the game ended so soon, but said that &quot;Metroid&quot; fans would enjoy it. &quot;Nintendo World Report&quot; and &quot;Eurogamer&quot; called it the best 2D &quot;Metroid&quot; game and the best Game Boy Advance game so far. &quot;Game Informer&quot; agreed, describing it as &quot;everything you could want from a Game Boy Advance game&quot; from beginning to end, giving it a perfect review score. &quot;Play&quot; described it as a &quot;magnified, modified, and improved&quot; version of everything great from &quot;Metroid&quot; and &quot;Super Metroid&quot;.

&quot;GameSpot&quot; thought that &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; offered &quot;Super Metroid&quot;″s best qualities packaged in a new adventure. Scott Pelland &quot;Nintendo Power&quot; heralded it as a return to the classic &quot;Metroid&quot; action gameplay. The &quot;perfect&quot; controls were praised by &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot;. &quot;Fusion&quot; did not feel new to &quot;GameSpy&quot;, which complained that even the final enemy encounter draws heavy inspiration from &quot;Super Metroid&quot;. &quot;GameZone&quot; found that the small screen of the Game Boy Advance was a poor environment in which to play &quot;Metroid Fusion&quot;, but they found it an exciting game.

&quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; received several accolades. It was awarded &quot;Handheld Game of the Year&quot; by the Academy of Interactive Arts &amp; Sciences at the 6th Annual Interactive Achievement Awards. It was also chosen as &quot;Best Game Boy Advance Adventure Game&quot; by &quot;IGN&quot; and &quot;Best Action Game on Game Boy Advance&quot; by &quot;GameSpot&quot;, which had named it the handheld&#x27;s best game of November 2002 earlier in the year. It was a runner-up for &quot;GameSpot&quot;″s annual &quot;Best Sound&quot;, &quot;Best Graphics&quot;, &quot;Best Story&quot; and overall &quot;Game of the Year&quot; awards among Game Boy Advance games. In 2009, &quot;Official Nintendo Magazine&quot; called &quot;Fusion&quot; &quot;sleek, slick and perfectly formed&quot;, ranking it the 62nd-best Nintendo game.

===Sales===
&quot;Metroid Fusion&quot; has sold over 1.6 million units worldwide. In its debut week, &quot;Fusion&quot; sold more than 100,000 units in North America. It finished the month of November 2002 with 199,723 copies sold in the United States alone, for total revenues of 5,590,768, making it the third best-selling Game Boy Advance game that month, and the tenth best-selling game across all platforms. It sold 940,000 copies by August 2006, with revenues of 27 million. During the period between January 2000 and August 2006, in the United States it was the twenty-first highest-selling game for the Game Boy Advance, Nintendo DS or PlayStation Portable. As of November 2004, &quot;Fusion&quot; had sold 180,000 units in Japan.
