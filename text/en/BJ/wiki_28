<text>Bernard Sanders (born September8, 1941) is an American politician and activist who is the senior United States senator from Vermont. He is the longest-serving independent in U.S. congressional history, but maintains a close relationship with the Democratic Party, having caucused with House and Senate Democrats for most of his congressional career and sought the party&#x27;s presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020. Sanders has been viewed as the leader of the modern American progressive movement.

Born into a working-class Jewish family and raised in the Brooklyn borough of New York City, Sanders attended Brooklyn College before graduating from the University of Chicago in 1964. While a student, he was a protest organizer for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC) during the civil rights movement. After settling in Vermont in 1968, he ran unsuccessful third-party political campaigns in the early-to-mid-1970s. He was elected mayor of Burlington in 1981 as an independent and was reelected three times.

Sanders was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1990, representing Vermont&#x27;s at-large congressional district. In 1991, he and five other House members co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus. Sanders was a U.S. representative for 16 years before being elected to the U.S. Senate in 2006, becoming the first non-Republican elected to Vermont&#x27;s Class 1 seat since Whig Solomon Foot in 1850. Sanders was reelected in 2012, 2018, and 2024. He chaired the Senate Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee from 2013 to 2015, the Senate Budget Committee from 2021 to 2023, and the Senate Health, Education, Labor and Pensions Committee from 2023 to 2025. He is the senior senator and dean of the Vermont congressional delegation.

Sanders was a major candidate for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016 and 2020, finishing in second place both times. Despite initially low expectations, his 2016 campaign generated significant grassroots enthusiasm and funding from small-dollar donors, helping him win 23 primaries and caucuses. In 2020, his strong showing in early primaries and caucuses made him the front-runner in a historically large field of Democratic candidates. He came to be a close ally of Joe Biden after the 2020 primaries.

Sanders is credited with influencing a leftward shift in the Democratic Party after his 2016 presidential campaign. An advocate of progressive policies, he opposes neoliberalism and supports workers&#x27; self-management. He supports universal and single-payer healthcare, paid parental leave, tuition-free tertiary education, a Green New Deal, and worker control of production through cooperatives, unions, and democratic public enterprises. On foreign policy, he supports reducing military spending, pursuing more diplomacy and international cooperation, and greater emphasis on labor rights and environmental concerns in negotiating international trade agreements. Sanders supports workplace democracy and has praised elements of the Nordic model. Some have compared and contrasted his politics to left-wing populism and the New Deal policies of President Franklin D. Roosevelt.
==Early life==

Bernard Sanders was born on September 8, 1941, in the Brooklyn borough of New York City. His father, Elias Ben Yehuda Sanders (1904–1962), a Polish-Jewish immigrant, was born in Słopnice, a town in Austrian Galicia that was then part of the Austro-Hungarian Empire and is now in Poland. Elias Sanders immigrated to the United States in 1921 and became a paint salesman. Bernie&#x27;s mother, Dorothy Sanders () (1912–1960), was born in New York City. He is the younger brother of Larry Sanders.

Sanders says he became interested in politics at an early age due to his family background. In the 1940s, many of his relatives in German-occupied Poland were murdered in the Holocaust.

Sanders lived in Midwood, Brooklyn. He attended elementary school at P.S. 197, where he won a borough championship on the basketball team. He attended Hebrew school in the afternoons and celebrated his bar mitzvah in 1954. His older brother Larry said that during their childhood, the family never lacked food or clothing, but major purchases, &quot;like curtains or a rug&quot;, were not affordable.

Sanders attended James Madison High School, where he was captain of the track team and took third place in the New York City indoor one-mile race. In high school, he lost his first election, finishing last of three candidates for the student body presidency with a campaign that focused on aiding Korean War orphans. Despite the loss, he became active in his school&#x27;s fundraising activities for Korean orphans, including organizing a charity basketball game. Sanders attended high school with economist Walter Block. When he was 19, his mother died at age 47. His father died two years later, in 1962, at age 57.

Sanders studied at Brooklyn College for a year in 1959–1960 before transferring to the University of Chicago and graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree in political science in 1964. In later interviews, Sanders described himself as a mediocre college student because the classroom was &quot;boring and irrelevant&quot; and said he viewed community activism as more important to his education.

==Early career==
===Political activism===

Sanders later described his time in Chicago as &quot;the major period of intellectual ferment in my life.&quot; While there, he joined the Young People&#x27;s Socialist League (the youth affiliate of the Socialist Party of America) and was active in the civil rights movement as a student for the Congress of Racial Equality (CORE) and the Student Nonviolent Coordinating Committee (SNCC). Under his chairmanship, the university chapter of CORE merged with the university chapter of the SNCC. In January 1962, he went to a rally at the University of Chicago administration building to protest university president George Wells Beadle&#x27;s segregated campus housing policy. At the protest, Sanders said, &quot;We feel it is an intolerable situation when Negro and white students of the university cannot live together in university-owned apartments&quot;. He and 32 other students then entered the building and camped outside the president&#x27;s office. After weeks of sit-ins, Beadle and the university formed a commission to investigate discrimination. After further protests, the University of Chicago ended racial segregation in private university housing in the summer of 1963.

Joan Mahoney, a member of the University of Chicago CORE chapter at the time and a fellow participant in the sit-ins, described Sanders in a 2016 interview as &quot;a swell guy, a nice Jewish boy from Brooklyn, but he wasn&#x27;t terribly charismatic. One of his strengths, though, was his ability to work with a wide group of people, even those he didn&#x27;t agree with.&quot; Sanders once spent a day putting up fliers protesting police brutality, only to notice later that Chicago police had shadowed him and taken them all down. He attended the 1963 March on Washington for Jobs and Freedom, where Martin Luther King Jr. gave the &quot;I Have a Dream&quot; speech. That summer, Sanders was fined $25 () for resisting arrest during a demonstration in Englewood against segregation in Chicago&#x27;s public schools.

In addition to his civil rights activism during the 1960s and 1970s, Sanders was active in several peace and antiwar movements while attending the University of Chicago, becoming a member of the Student Peace Union. He applied for conscientious objector status during the Vietnam War; his application was eventually turned down, by which point he was too old to be drafted. Although he opposed the war, Sanders never criticized those who fought in it and has strongly supported veterans&#x27; benefits throughout his political career. He was briefly an organizer with the United Packinghouse Workers of America while in Chicago. He also worked on the reelection campaign of Leon Despres, a prominent Chicago alderman who opposed then-mayor Richard J. Daley&#x27;s Democratic Party machine. Sanders said that he spent much of his student years reading history, sociology, psychology, and the works of political authors, from Thomas Jefferson, Abraham Lincoln, John Dewey, Karl Marx, and Erich Fromm—&quot;reading everything except what I was supposed to read for class the next day.&quot;

===Professional history and early years in Vermont===
After graduating from college, Sanders returned to New York City, where he worked various jobs, including Head Start teacher, psychiatric aide, and carpenter. In 1968, he moved to Stannard, Vermont, a town small in both area and population (88 residents at the 1970 census) within Vermont&#x27;s rural Northeast Kingdom region, because he had been &quot;captivated by rural life&quot;. While there, he worked as a carpenter, filmmaker, and writer who created and sold &quot;radical film strips&quot; and other educational materials to schools. He also wrote several articles for the alternative publication &quot;The Vermont Freeman&quot;. He lived in the area for several years before moving to the more populous Chittenden County in the mid-1970s. During his 2018 reelection campaign, he returned to the town to hold an event with voters and other candidates.

===Liberty Union campaigns===
From 1969 to 1971, Sanders resided in Montpelier. After moving to Burlington, he began his electoral political career as a member of the Liberty Union Party, a national umbrella party for various socialist-oriented state parties, originating in the anti-war movement and the People&#x27;s Party. He ran as the Liberty Union candidate for governor of Vermont in 1972 and 1976 and as a candidate in the special election for U.S. senator in 1972 and in the general election in 1974. In the 1974 senatorial race, he finished third (5,901 votes; 4%), behind 34-year-old Chittenden County state&#x27;s attorney Patrick Leahy (D; 70,629 votes; 49%) and two-term incumbent U.S. Representative Dick Mallary (R; 66,223 votes; 46%).

The 1976 campaign was the zenith of the Liberty Union&#x27;s influence, with Sanders collecting 11,317 votes for governor and the party. His strong performance forced the down-ballot races for lieutenant governor and secretary of state to be decided by the state legislature when its vote total prevented either the Republican or Democratic candidate for those offices from garnering a majority of votes. But the campaign drained the Liberty Union&#x27;s finances and energy, and in October 1977, Sanders and the Liberty Union candidate for attorney general, Nancy Kaufman, announced their retirement from the party. During the 1980 presidential election, Sanders was one of three electors for the Socialist Workers Party in Vermont.

After resigning from the Liberty Union Party in 1977, Sanders worked as a writer and as the director of the nonprofit American People&#x27;s Historical Society (APHS). While with the APHS, he produced a 30-minute documentary about American labor leader Eugene V. Debs, who ran for president five times as the Socialist Party candidate.

==Mayor of Burlington, Vermont (1981–1989)==


===Campaigns===
On November 8, 1980, Sanders announced his candidacy for mayor. He formally announced his campaign on December 16 at a City Hall press conference. Sanders selected Linda Niedweske as his campaign manager. The Citizens Party attempted to nominate Greg Guma for mayor, but Guma declined, saying it would be &quot;difficult to run against another progressive candidate&quot;. Sanders had been convinced to run for the mayoralty by his close friend Richard Sugarman, an Orthodox Jewish professor of religious studies at the University of Vermont, who had shown him a ward-by-ward breakdown of the 1976 Vermont gubernatorial election, in which Sanders had run, that showed him receiving 12% of the vote in Burlington despite only getting 6% statewide.

Sanders initially won the mayoral election by 22 votes against incumbent mayor Gordon Paquette, Richard Bove, and Joseph McGrath, but the margin was later reduced to 10 votes. Paquette did not contest the results of the recount.

Paquette&#x27;s loss was attributed to his own shortcomings, as he did not campaign or promote his candidacy since neither Sanders nor Bove was seen as a serious challenger. Sanders had not previously won an election. Paquette was also considered to have lost because he proposed an unpopular $0.65 per $100 raise in taxes that Sanders opposed. Sanders spent around $4,000 on his campaign.

Sanders castigated the pro-development incumbent as an ally of prominent shopping center developer Antonio Pomerleau, while Paquette warned of ruin for Burlington if Sanders were elected. The Sanders campaign was bolstered by a wave of optimistic volunteers as well as a series of endorsements from university professors, social welfare agencies, and the police union. The result shocked the local political establishment.

Sanders formed a coalition between independents and the Citizens Party. On December 3, 1982, he announced that he would seek reelection. On January 22, 1983, the Citizens Party voted unanimously to endorse Sanders, although Sanders ran as an independent. He was reelected, defeating Judy Stephany and James Gilson.

Sanders initially considered not seeking a third term but announced on December 5, 1984, that he would run. He formally launched his campaign on December 7 and was reelected. On December 1, 1986, Sanders, who had finished third in the 1986 Vermont gubernatorial election, announced that he would seek reelection to a fourth term as mayor of Burlington, despite close associates saying that he was tired of being mayor. Sanders defeated Democratic nominee Paul Lafayette in the election. He said he would not seek another mayoral term after the 1987 election: &quot;eight years is enough and I think it is time for new leadership, which does exist within the coalition, to come up&quot;.

Sanders did not run for a fifth term as mayor. He went on to lecture in political science at Harvard Kennedy School that year and at Hamilton College in 1991.

===Administration===
During his mayoralty, Sanders called himself a socialist and was described as such in the press. During his first term, his supporters, including the first Citizens Party city councilor Terry Bouricius, formed the Progressive Coalition, the forerunner of the Vermont Progressive Party. The Progressives never held more than six seats on the 13-member city council, but they had enough to keep the council from overriding Sanders&#x27;s vetoes. Under his leadership, Burlington balanced its city budget; attracted a minor league baseball team, the Vermont Reds, then the Double-A affiliate of the Cincinnati Reds; became the first U.S. city to fund community-trust housing; and successfully sued the local cable television franchise, thereby winning reduced rates for customers.

As mayor, Sanders also led extensive downtown revitalization projects. One of his primary achievements was improving Burlington&#x27;s Lake Champlain waterfront. In 1981, he campaigned against the unpopular plans by Burlington developer Tony Pomerleau to convert the then-industrial waterfront property owned by the Central Vermont Railway into expensive condominiums, hotels, and offices. He ran under the slogan &quot;Burlington is not for sale&quot; and successfully supported a plan that redeveloped the waterfront area into a mixed-use district featuring housing, parks, and public spaces.

Sanders was a consistent critic of U.S. foreign policy in Latin America throughout the 1980s. In 1985, Burlington City Hall hosted a foreign policy speech by Noam Chomsky. In his introduction, he praised Chomsky as &quot;a very vocal and important voice in the wilderness of intellectual life in America&quot; and said that he was &quot;delighted to welcome a person who I think we&#x27;re all very proud of&quot;.

Sanders hosted and produced a public-access television program, &quot;Bernie Speaks with the Community&quot;, from 1986 to 1988. He collaborated with 30 Vermont musicians to record a folk album, &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;, in 1987. That same year, &quot;U.S. News &amp; World Report&quot; ranked Sanders one of America&#x27;s best mayors. , Burlington was regarded as one of the most livable cities in the United States.

During a trip to the Soviet Union in 1988, Sanders interviewed the mayor of Burlington&#x27;s sister city Yaroslavl about housing and health care issues in the two cities.

When Sanders left office in 1989, Bouricius, a member of the Burlington city council, said that Sanders had &quot;changed the entire nature of politics in Burlington and also in the state of Vermont&quot;.

==U.S. House of Representatives (1991–2007)==

===Elections===
In 1988, incumbent Republican congressman Jim Jeffords decided to run for the U.S. Senate, vacating the House seat representing Vermont&#x27;s at-large congressional district. Former lieutenant governor Peter P. Smith won the House election with a plurality, securing 41% of the vote. Sanders, who ran as an independent, placed second with 38% of the vote, while Democratic state representative Paul N. Poirier placed third with 19%. Two years later, he ran for the seat again and defeated Smith by a margin of 56% to 39%.
Sanders was the first independent elected to the U.S. House of Representatives since Frazier Reams of Ohio won his second term in 1952, as well as the first socialist elected to the House since Vito Marcantonio, from the American Labor Party, who won his last term in 1948. Sanders was a representative from 1991 until he became a senator in 2007, winning reelection by large margins except during the 1994 Republican Revolution, when he won by 3%, with 50% of the vote.

===Legislation===

During his first year in the House, Sanders often alienated allies and colleagues with his criticism of both political parties as working primarily on behalf of the wealthy. In 1991, he co-founded the Congressional Progressive Caucus, a group of mostly liberal Democrats that he chaired for its first eight years, while still refusing to join the Democratic Party or caucus.

In 2005, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called Sanders the &quot;amendment king&quot; for his ability to get more roll call amendments passed than any other congressman during the period since 1995, when Congress was entirely under Republican control. Being an independent allowed him to form coalitions across party lines.

====Banking reform====
In 1999, Sanders voted and advocated against rolling back the Glass–Steagall legislation provisions that kept investment banks and commercial banks separate entities. He was a vocal critic of Federal Reserve chair Alan Greenspan; in June 2003, during a question-and-answer discussion, Sanders told him he was concerned that he was &quot;way out of touch&quot; and &quot;that you see your major function in your position as the need to represent the wealthy and large corporations.&quot;

====Cancer registries====
Concerned by high breast cancer rates in Vermont, on February 7, 1992, Sanders sponsored the Cancer Registries Amendment Act to establish cancer registries to collect data on cancer. Senator Patrick Leahy introduced a companion bill in the Senate on October 2, 1992. The Senate bill was passed by the House on October 6 and signed into law by President George H. W. Bush on October 24, 1992.

====Firearms and criminal justice====
In 1993, Sanders voted against the Brady Bill, which mandated federal background checks when buying guns and imposed a waiting period on firearm purchasers in the United States; the bill passed by a vote of 238–187. He voted against the bill four more times in the 1990s, explaining his Vermont constituents saw waiting-period mandates as more appropriately a state than federal matter.

Sanders did vote for other gun-control measures. For example, in 1994, he voted for the Violent Crime Control and Law Enforcement Act &quot;because it included the Violence Against Women Act and the ban on certain assault weapons.&quot; He was nevertheless critical of the other parts of the bill. Although he acknowledged that &quot;clearly, there are some people in our society who are horribly violent, who are deeply sick and sociopathic, and clearly these people must be put behind bars in order to protect society from them&quot;, he maintained that governmental policies played a large part in &quot;dooming tens of millions of young people to a future of bitterness, misery, hopelessness, drugs, crime, and violence&quot; and argued that the repressive policies introduced by the bill were not addressing the causes of violence, saying, &quot;we can create meaningful jobs, rebuilding our society, or we can build more jails.&quot;

Sanders has at times favored stronger law enforcement and sentencing. In 1996, he voted against a bill that would have prohibited police from purchasing tanks and armored carriers. In 1998, he voted for a bill that would have increased minimum sentencing for possessing a gun while committing a federal crime to ten years in prison, including nonviolent crimes such as marijuana possession.

In 2005, Sanders voted for the Protection of Lawful Commerce in Arms Act. The purpose of the act was to prevent firearms manufacturers and dealers from being held liable for negligence when crimes have been committed with their products. , he said that he has since changed his position and would vote for legislation to defeat this bill.

====Opposition to the Patriot Act====
Sanders was a consistent critic of the Patriot Act. As a member of Congress, he voted against the original Patriot Act legislation. After its 357–66 passage in the House, he sponsored and voted for several subsequent amendments and acts attempting to curtail its effects and voted against each reauthorization. In June 2005, he proposed an amendment to limit Patriot Act provisions that allow the government to obtain individuals&#x27; library and book-buying records. The amendment passed the House by a bipartisan majority but was removed on November4 of that year in House–Senate negotiations and never became law.

====Opposition to the War in Iraq====

Sanders voted against the resolutions authorizing the use of force against Iraq in 1991 and 2002, and he opposed the 2003 invasion of Iraq. He voted for the 2001 Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Terrorists that has been cited as the legal justification for controversial military actions since the September 11 attacks. He especially opposed the Bush administration&#x27;s decision to start a war unilaterally.

====Trade policy====
In February 2005, Sanders introduced a bill that would have withdrawn the permanent normal trade relations (PNTR) status that had been extended to China in October 2000. He said to the House, &quot;Anyone who takes an objective look at our trade policy with China must conclude that it is an absolute failure and needs to be fundamentally overhauled&quot;, citing the American jobs being lost to overseas competitors. His bill received 71 co-sponsors but was not sent to the floor for a vote.

==U.S. Senate (2007–present)==

===Elections===
====2006====

Sanders entered the race for the U.S. Senate on April 21, 2005, after Senator Jim Jeffords announced that he would not seek a fourth term. Chuck Schumer, chair of the Democratic Senatorial Campaign Committee and fellow James Madison High School alumnus, endorsed Sanders. This was a critical move because it meant no Democrat running against him could expect financial help from the party. He was also endorsed by Senate minority leader Harry Reid and Democratic National Committee chair and former Vermont governor Howard Dean. Dean said in May 2005 that he considered Sanders an ally who &quot;votes with the Democrats 98% of the time.&quot; Then-Senator Barack Obama also campaigned for him in Vermont in March 2006. Sanders entered into an agreement with the Democratic Party, much as he had as a congressman, to be listed in their primary but to decline the nomination should he win, which he did.
In the most expensive political campaign in Vermont&#x27;s history, Sanders defeated businessman Rich Tarrant by an almost 2-to-1 margin. Many national media outlets projected him as the winner just after the polls closed, before any returns came in.

====2012====

Sanders was reelected in 2012 with 71% of the vote.

====2018====

Sanders was reelected in 2018 with 67% of the vote.

====2024====

On May 6, 2024, Sanders announced his candidacy for a fourth Senate term. A poll just a few weeks earlier found that more than half of respondents wanted him to seek reelection. Sanders faced Republican nominee Gerald Malloy, who ran against Senator Peter Welch in 2022. Sanders was reelected and has said this term will likely be his last.

===Legislation===
While a member of Congress, Sanders sponsored 15 concurrent resolutions and 15 Senate resolutions. Of those he co-sponsored, 218 became law. While he has consistently advocated for progressive causes, &quot;Politico&quot; wrote that he has &quot;rarely forged actual legislation or left a significant imprint on it.&quot; According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Big legislation largely eludes Mr. Sanders because his ideas are usually far to the left of the majority of the Senate ... Mr. Sanders has largely found ways to press his agenda through appending small provisions to the larger bills of others.&quot; During his time in the Senate, he had lower legislative effectiveness than the average senator, as measured by the number of sponsored bills that passed and successful amendments made. Nevertheless, he has sponsored over 500 amendments to bills, many of which became law. The results of these amendments include a ban on imported goods made by child labor; $100 million in funding for community health centers; $10 million for an outreach program for servicemembers who have post-traumatic stress disorder, traumatic brain injury, depression, panic attacks, and other mental disorders; a public database of senior Department of Defense officials seeking employment with defense contractors; and including autism treatment under the military healthcare program Tricare.

In August 2022, Sanders voted for the Inflation Reduction Act of 2022. He was not satisfied with the bill, calling it only a small step forward. Sanders joined with Democrats to pass the Inflation Reduction Act, which capped the cost of insulin for seniors on Medicare to $35 a month and allowed Medicare to negotiate lower drug prices.

====Finance and monetary policy====
In 2008 and 2009, Sanders voted against the Troubled Asset Relief Program (TARP), a program to purchase toxic banking assets and provide loans to banks that were in free-fall. On February 4, 2009, he sponsored an amendment to ensure that TARP funds would not displace U.S. workers. The amendment passed and was added to the American Recovery and Reinvestment Act of 2009. Among his proposed financial reforms is auditing the Federal Reserve, which would reduce its independence in monetary policy deliberations; Federal Reserve officials say that &quot;Audit the Fed&quot; legislation would expose the Federal Reserve to undue political pressure from lawmakers who do not like its decisions.

On December 10, 2010, Sanders delivered an 8-hour and 34-minute speech against the Tax Relief, Unemployment Insurance Reauthorization, and Job Creation Act of 2010, which proposed extending the Bush-era tax rates. He argued that the legislation would favor the wealthiest Americans. &quot;Enough is enough! ... How many homes can you own?&quot; he asked. Nevertheless, the bill passed the Senate with a strong majority and was signed into law a week later. In February 2011, Nation Books published the speech as &quot;The Speech: A Historic Filibuster on Corporate Greed and the Decline of Our Middle Class&quot;, with authorial proceeds going to Vermont nonprofit charitable organizations.

In 2016, Sanders voted for the Federal Reserve Transparency Act, which included proposals for a reformed audit of the Federal Reserve System.

====Foreign policy====
On June 12, 2017, U.S. senators agreed to legislation imposing new sanctions on Russia and Iran. The bill was opposed only by Sanders and Republican Rand Paul. He supported the sanctions on Russia, but voted against the bill because he believed the sanctions could endanger the Iran nuclear deal.

In 2018, Sanders sponsored a bill and was joined by senators Chris Murphy (D–CT) and Mike Lee (R–UT) to invoke the 1973 War Powers Resolution to end U.S. support for the Saudi-led military intervention in Yemen, which has resulted in hundreds of thousands of civilian casualties and &quot;millions more suffering from starvation and disease&quot;. After the assassination of Jamal Khashoggi in October 2018 (which was ordered by Saudi Arabian crown prince Mohammad bin Salman, according to multiple intelligence agencies), his bill attracted bipartisan co-sponsors and support, and the Senate passed it by a vote of 56–41. The bill passed the House in February 2019 by a 247–175 vote and President Trump vetoed it in March, saying: &quot;This resolution is an unnecessary, dangerous attempt to weaken my constitutional authorities, endangering the lives of American citizens and brave service members, both today and in the future.&quot;

====Health care====

In mid-December 2009, Sanders successfully added a provision to the Affordable Care Act to fund $11 billion to community health centers, especially those in rural areas. The provision brought together Democrats on the left with Democrats from conservative, rural areas, helping to secure the 60 votes needed for passage. On May 4, 2017, in response to the House vote to repeal and replace the Affordable Care Act, he predicted &quot;thousands of Americans would die&quot; from no longer having access to health care. PolitiFact rated his statement &quot;mostly true&quot;.

In September 2017, Sanders along with 15 Senate co-sponsors submitted the Medicare for All bill, a single-payer healthcare plan. The bill covers vision and dental care, unlike Medicare. Some Republicans have called the bill &quot;Berniecare&quot; and &quot;the latest Democratic push for socialized medicine and higher taxes.&quot; He responded that the Republican Party has no credibility on the issue of health care after voting for legislation that would take health insurance away from 32 million Americans under the Affordable Care Act.

As chairman of the Senate Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging, Sanders introduced legislation in 2013 to reauthorize and strengthen the Older Americans Act, which supports Meals on Wheels and other programs for seniors.

====Immigration policy====
In 2007, Sanders helped kill a bill introducing comprehensive immigration reform, arguing that its guest-worker program would depress wages for American workers. In 2010, he supported the DREAM Act, which would have provided a path to citizenship for undocumented immigrants who had been brought to the United States as minors. In 2013, he supported the Gang of Eight&#x27;s comprehensive immigration reform bill after securing a $1.5 billion youth jobs program provision, which he argued would offset the harm of labor market competition with immigrants.

====Income and wealth distribution====
In April 2017, Sanders introduced a bill that would raise the minimum wage for federal contract workers to $15 an hour, an increase over an earlier Democratic $12 an hour proposal. On May 9, 2018, he introduced the Workplace Democracy Act, a bill that would expand labor rights by making it easier for workers to join a union, ban right-to-work laws and some anti-union provisions of the Taft–Hartley Act, and outlaw some union-busting tactics. Announcing the legislation, he said, &quot;If we are serious about reducing income and wealth inequality and rebuilding the middle class, we have got to substantially increase the number of union jobs in this country.&quot;

Sanders opposed the 2018 United States federal budget proposed by the Trump administration, calling it &quot;a budget for the billionaire class, for Wall Street, for corporate CEOs, and for the wealthiest people in this country ... nothing less than a massive transfer of wealth from working families, the elderly, children, the sick and the poor to the top 1%.&quot;

After the November 2017 revelations from the Paradise Papers and a recent report from the Institute for Policy Studies which says just three people (Jeff Bezos, Bill Gates, and Warren Buffett) own more wealth than the bottom half of the U.S. population, Sanders stated that &quot;we must end global oligarchy&quot; and that &quot;we need, in the United States and throughout the world, a tax system which is fair, progressive and transparent.&quot;

On September 5, 2018, Sanders partnered with Ro Khanna to introduce the Stop Bad Employers by Zeroing Out Subsidies (Stop BEZOS) Act, which would require large corporations to pay for the food stamps and Medicaid benefits that their employees receive, relieving the burden on taxpayers.

====Veterans affairs====

On June 9, 2014, Sanders sponsored the Veterans&#x27; Access to Care through Choice, Accountability, and Transparency Act of 2014 to reform the Department of Veterans Affairs in the wake of the Veterans Health Administration scandal of 2014. He worked with Senator John McCain, who co-sponsored the bill. His bill was incorporated into the House version of the bill, which passed both chambers on July 31, 2014, and was signed into law by President Obama on August 7, 2014.

===Supreme Court nominees===
On March 17, 2016, Sanders said he would support Merrick Garland&#x27;s nomination to the Supreme Court, though he added, &quot;there are some more progressive judges out there.&quot; He opposed Neil Gorsuch&#x27;s nomination to the court, saying that Gorsuch had &quot;refused to answer legitimate questions&quot;. He also objected to Senate Republicans&#x27; use of the nuclear option to &quot;choke off debate and ram [Gorsuch&#x27;s] nomination through the Senate&quot;. He voted against Gorsuch&#x27;s confirmation as an associate justice and against Trump&#x27;s nominees Brett Kavanaugh and Amy Coney Barrett. In 2022, Sanders voted to confirm Joe Biden&#x27;s nominee Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court.

===Committee assignments===
As an independent, Sanders maintains an agreement with the Senate Democratic leadership where he votes with the Democrats on all procedural matters unless the Democratic whip, Dick Durbin, agrees that he need not (a request rarely made or granted). In return he was allowed to keep his seniority and received the committee seats that would have been available to him as a Democrat; in 2013–14 he was chairman of the United States Senate Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs (during the Veterans Health Administration scandal).

Sanders became the ranking minority member on the Senate Budget Committee in 2015 and the chair in 2021; he previously chaired the Senate Veterans&#x27; Affairs Committee for two years. Since 2017, he has been chair of the Senate Democratic Outreach Committee. He appointed economics professor Stephanie Kelton, a modern monetary theory scholar, as the chief economic adviser for the committee&#x27;s Democratic minority and presented a report about helping &quot;rebuild the disappearing middle class&quot; that included proposals to raise the minimum wage, boost infrastructure spending, and increase Social Security payments.

=== 119th United States Congress Committee Assignments ===
* Committee on the Budget 
* Committee on Environment and Public Works
* Committee on Finance
* Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions (ranking member)
* Committee on Veterans&#x27; Affairs

===Caucus memberships===
Sanders was only the third senator from Vermont to caucus with the Democrats, after Jeffords and Leahy. His caucusing with the Democrats gave them a 51–49 majority in the Senate during the 110th Congress in 2007–08. The Democrats needed 51 seats to control the Senate because Vice President Dick Cheney would likely have broken potential ties in favor of the Republicans. He is a member of the following caucuses:
* Congressional Progressive Caucus
* Democratic Caucus of the United States Senate
* United States Senate Afterschool Caucus

===Approval ratings===
Polling conducted in August 2011 by Public Policy Polling found that Sanders&#x27;s approval rating was 67% and his disapproval rating 28%, making him then the third-most popular U.S. senator. Both the NAACP (National Association for the Advancement of Colored People) and the NHLA (National Hispanic Leadership Agenda) have given him 100% voting scores during his tenure in the Senate. In 2015, he was named one of the Top5 of &quot;The Forward&quot; 50. In a November 2015 Morning Consult poll, he reached an 83% approval rating among his constituents, making him the most popular U.S. senator. Fox News found him to have the highest net favorability at +28 points of any prominent politician included in its March 2017 poll. He ranked third in 2014 and first in both 2015 and 2016.

In April 2017, a nationwide Harvard-Harris Poll found that Sanders had the highest favorability rating among all the political figures included in the poll, a standing confirmed by subsequent polling.

==2016 presidential campaign==


During the 2012 Democratic presidential primaries, Sanders—dissatisfied with President Obama&#x27;s &quot;attempts to trade Social Security cuts for tax hikes&quot;—reportedly considered running against him in the primaries. Sanders had previously suggested in 2011 that it was &quot;a good idea&quot; for someone to challenge Obama and &quot;got so close to running a primary challenge ... that Senator Harry Reid had to intervene to stop him.&quot; In November 2013, Sanders suggested that Senator Elizabeth Warren could be president and that she might earn his backing if she ran. He added that if no progressive candidate ran, he might feel compelled to do so himself. In December 2014, Warren said she was not running.

Sanders announced his intention to seek the Democratic Party&#x27;s nomination for president on April 30, 2015. His campaign was officially launched on May 26 in Burlington. In his announcement, Sanders said, &quot;I don&#x27;t believe that the men and women who defended American democracy fought to create a situation where billionaires own the political process&quot; and made this a central idea throughout his campaign.

Warren welcomed Sanders&#x27;s entry into the race, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m glad to see him get out there and give his version of what leadership in this country should be&quot;, but never endorsed him.

Initially considered a long shot, Sanders won 23 primaries and caucuses and around 46% of pledged delegates to Hillary Clinton&#x27;s 54%. His campaign was noted for its supporters&#x27; enthusiasm, as well as for rejecting large donations from corporations, the financial industry, and any associated Super PAC. Some of the Democratic National Committee (DNC) emails leaked to the public in June and July 2016 showed that the committee leadership had favored Clinton over him and had worked to help Clinton win the nomination.

On July 12, 2016, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton in her unsuccessful general election campaign against Republican Donald Trump, while urging his supporters to continue the &quot;political revolution&quot; his campaign had begun. Following his endorsement, Sanders spent weeks campaigning for Clinton, holding 39 rallies in 13 states during the final three months before the 2016 election.

===Campaign methods===
Unlike the other major candidates, Sanders did not pursue funding through a Super PAC or from wealthy donors, instead focusing on small-dollar donations. His presidential campaign raised $1.5 million within 24 hours of his official announcement. At the end of the year, the campaign had raised a total of $73 million from more than one million people, making 2.5 million donations, with an average donation of $27.16. The campaign reached 3.25 million donations by the end of January 2016, raising $20 million in that month alone.

Sanders used social media to help his campaign gain momentum, posting content to online platforms such as Twitter and Facebook and answering questions on Reddit. He gained a large grassroots organizational following online. A July 29, 2015, meetup organized online brought 100,000 supporters to more than 3,500 simultaneous events nationwide.

To his surprise, Sanders&#x27;s June 2015 campaign events drew overflow crowds across the country. When Clinton and Sanders made public appearances within days of each other in Des Moines, Iowa, he drew larger crowds, even though he had already made many stops around the state and Clinton&#x27;s visit was her first in 2015. On July 1, 2015, his campaign stop in Madison, Wisconsin, drew the largest crowd of any 2016 presidential candidate to that date, with an estimated turnout of 10,000. Over the following weeks, he drew even larger crowds: 11,000 in Phoenix; 15,000 in Seattle; and 28,000 in Portland, Oregon.

===Presidential debates===
The Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced in May 2015 that there would be six debates. Critics alleged that the small number of debates and the schedule, with half of the debates on Saturday or Sunday nights, were part of the DNC&#x27;s deliberate attempt to protect Clinton, who was perceived as the front-runner. In February 2016, both the Clinton and Sanders campaigns agreed in principle to holding four more debates for a total of ten. Clinton dropped out of the tenth debate, scheduled to take place just before the California primary, citing a need to devote her time to making direct contact with California voters and preparing for the general election. Sanders expressed disappointment that Clinton canceled the debate before what he believed would be &quot;the largest and most important primary in the presidential nominating process.&quot;

===Polls and news coverage===
Some Sanders supporters raised concerns that publications such as &quot;The New York Times&quot; minimized coverage of the Sanders campaign in favor of other candidates, especially Trump and Clinton. The &quot;Times&quot;″ ombudsman reviewed her paper&#x27;s coverage of the Sanders campaign and found that the &quot;Times&quot; &quot;hasn&#x27;t always taken it very seriously. The tone of some stories is regrettably dismissive, even mocking at times. Some of that is focused on the candidate&#x27;s age, appearance and style, rather than what he has to say.&quot; She also found that the &quot;Times&quot; coverage of Sanders&#x27;s campaign was much scanter than its coverage of Trump&#x27;s, though Trump&#x27;s was also initially considered a long shot at that time, with 63 articles covering the Trump campaign and 14 covering Sanders&#x27;s. A December 2015 report found that the three major networks—CBS, NBC, and ABC—had spent 234 minutes reporting on Trump and 10 minutes on Sanders, despite their similar polling results. The report noted that &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; had spent 81 minutes on Trump and less than one minute on Sanders during 2015.

A study of media coverage in the 2016 election concluded that while Sanders received less coverage than his rival Hillary Clinton, the amount of coverage of Sanders during the election was largely consistent with his polling performance, except during 2015 when Sanders received coverage that far exceeded his standing in the polls. Studies concluded that the tone of media coverage of Sanders was more favorable than that of any other candidate, whereas his main opponent in the Democratic primary, Hillary Clinton, received the most negative coverage of any candidate. All 2016 candidates received vastly less media coverage than Donald Trump, and the Democratic primary received substantially less coverage than the Republican primary.

Amy Goodman of &quot;Democracy Now!&quot; noted that on March 15, Super Tuesday III, the speeches of Trump, Clinton, Marco Rubio, and Ted Cruz were broadcast in full. Sanders was in Phoenix, Arizona, on that date, speaking to a rally larger than any of the others, yet his speech was not mentioned, let alone broadcast. However, political scientist Rachel Bitecofer wrote in her 2018 book about the 2016 election that the Democratic primary was effectively over in terms of delegate count by mid-March 2016, but that the media promoted the narrative that the contest between Sanders and Clinton was &quot;heating up&quot; at that time.

An NBC/&quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; poll conducted in May 2016 found Clinton and Trump (by then the presumptive Republican nominee) in a &quot;dead heat&quot;, but the same poll found that if Sanders were the Democratic nominee, 53% of voters would support him to 39% for Trump. Clinton and Trump were the least popular likely candidates ever polled, while Sanders received a 43% positive, 36% negative rating. Polls showed that Democratic voters older than 50 preferred Clinton by a large margin but that those under 50 overwhelmingly favored Sanders. A 2017 analysis in &quot;Newsweek&quot; found that 12% of those who voted for Sanders in the Democratic primary voted for Trump in the general election, a lower proportion than that of Clinton supporters in 2008 who voted for John McCain.

===DNC email leak===

In July 2016, a leak of the Democratic National Committee&#x27;s emails appeared to show DNC officials favoring Clinton over Sanders. Staff repeatedly discussed making his irreligious tendencies a potential campaign issue in southern states and questioned his party loyalty. DNC chair Debbie Wasserman Schultz called his campaign manager &quot;an &quot;ass&quot;&quot; and &quot;a damn liar&quot;. Speaking with Jake Tapper on CNN, Sanders responded to the leak, saying, &quot;it is an outrage and sad that you would have people in important positions in the DNC trying to undermine my campaign. It goes without saying: the function of the DNC is to represent all of the candidates—to be fair and even-minded. But again, we discussed this many, many months ago, on this show, so what is revealed now is not a shock to me.&quot;

===Endorsement of Hillary Clinton===

After the final primary election, Clinton became the presumptive Democratic nominee. On July 12, Sanders formally endorsed Clinton. He said he would continue to work with the Democratic National Convention organizers to implement progressive positions. Sanders refused to formally concede before the convention. He spoke at the 2016 Democratic National Convention on July 25, during which he gave Clinton his full support. Some of his supporters attempted to protest Clinton&#x27;s nomination and booed when Sanders called for party unity. He responded, &quot;Our job is to do two things: to defeat Donald Trump and to elect Hillary Clinton... It is easy to boo, but it is harder to look your kids in the face if we are living under a Trump presidency.&quot;

On November 8, in the general election, Sanders received almost 6% of the vote in Vermont, even though he was no longer a candidate. This was the highest share of a statewide presidential vote for a write-in draft campaign in American history. He also received more votes in Vermont than Gary Johnson, the Libertarian candidate, and Jill Stein, the Green candidate, combined. It was possible to vote for Sanders as a write-in candidate in 12 states, and exact totals of write-in votes for him were published in three of them: California, New Hampshire, and Vermont. In those three states, he received 111,850 write-in votes, about 15% of the write-in votes nationwide, and less than 1% of total nationwide vote.

===Post-election activities===
In November 2016, Sanders&#x27;s book &quot;Our Revolution: A Future to Believe In&quot; was released; upon its release, it was number three on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list. The audiobook later received a Grammy nomination for Best Spoken Word Album. In February 2017, he began webcasting &quot;The Bernie Sanders Show&quot; on Facebook live streaming. , guests had included William Barber, Josh Fox, Jane Mayer, and Bill Nye. Polls taken in 2017 found him to be the most popular politician in the United States.

In February 2018, Special Counsel Robert Mueller&#x27;s investigation into Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections concluded that Russians had communicated false information during the primary campaigns to help Sanders and Stein and harm Clinton. Sanders rejected the investigation&#x27;s conclusion, saying that he had seen no evidence that Russians had helped his campaign. Furthermore, he questioned the Clinton campaign&#x27;s lack of action to prevent Russian interference. He later said that his campaign had taken action to prevent Russian meddling in the election and that a campaign staffer had alerted the Clinton campaign. &quot;Politico&quot; noted that a Sanders campaign volunteer contacted a political action committee (PAC) that supported the Clinton campaign to report suspicious activities but that the Sanders campaign did not contact the Clinton campaign as such.

In November 2018, the Sanders Institute and Yanis Varoufakis, co-founder of DiEM25, launched Progressive International, an international organization uniting progressive activists and organizations &quot;to mobilize people around the world to transform the global order and the institutions that shape it.&quot;

===Influence on the Democratic Party===
Analysts have suggested that Sanders&#x27;s campaign shifted both the Clinton campaign and the Democratic Party politically leftward. A new political organization, Brand New Congress, was formed in April 2016 by former campaign staffers. It works to elect congressional representatives with platforms in line with Sanders. In August 2016, he formed Our Revolution, a political organization dedicated to educating voters about issues, getting people involved in the political process, and electing progressive candidates for local, state, and national office. Speaking on the PBS Newshour about the upcoming 2018 elections and discussing the main principles of the two major parties, Susan Page described the Republican Party as &quot;Trump&#x27;s party&quot; and the Democratic Party as &quot;Bernie Sanders&#x27;s party&quot;, saying that &quot;Sanders and his more progressive stance has really taken hold.&quot; Noting the increasing acceptance of his national single-payer health-care program, his $15-an-hour minimum wage stance, free college tuition, and many of the other campaign platform issues he introduced, an April 2018 opinion article in &quot;The Week&quot; suggested, &quot;Quietly but steadily, the Democratic Party is admitting that Sanders was right.&quot; In July 2016, a &quot;Slate&quot; article called the Democratic platform draft &quot;a monument to his campaign&quot;, noting not only his call for a $15 minimum wage but other campaign issues, such as Social Security expansion, a carbon tax, Wall Street reform, opposition to the death penalty, and a &quot;reasoned pathway for future legalization&quot; of marijuana.

Sanders&#x27;s presidential campaigns led to a resurgence of interest in social democracy and democratic socialism among millennials.

==2020 presidential campaign==
On February 19, 2019, Sanders announced that he would seek the Democratic Party&#x27;s 2020 nomination for president. He had declined the Vermont Democratic Party nomination for U.S. Senate in 2006, 2012, and 2018, which caused an unsuccessful legal challenge to his candidacy for the Democratic presidential nomination in 2016. Along with his 2019 campaign announcement, he said he would abide by a new Democratic Party rule for presidential candidates and that he would affirm his membership in that party. On March 5, 2019, he signed a formal statement, known as a &quot;loyalty pledge&quot;, that he is a member of the Democratic Party and will serve as a Democrat if elected. News reports noted that the day before, he had signed paperwork to run as an independent for reelection to his Senate seat in 2024.

Sanders&#x27;s campaign manager was Faiz Shakir. The campaign&#x27;s national co-chairs were Ben &amp; Jerry&#x27;s co-founder Ben Cohen, Representative Ro Khanna, Our Revolution president Nina Turner, and San Juan mayor Carmen Yulín Cruz.

===Campaign methods===
Given the high national profile that Sanders maintained since his 2016 campaign, NPR described him as &quot;no longer an underdog&quot; when he announced his 2020 campaign. Using the large email list it built during the 2016 campaign, the 2020 campaign recruited more than one million volunteers within weeks of its launch. It enlisted several former NowThis News employees to produce professional videos for wide social media distribution, live-streamed various forums to its millions of social media followers, and launched a podcast and smartphone app for grassroots organizing.

===Fundraising===
Sanders&#x27;s 2020 campaign employed many of the same methods as its 2016 counterpart, eschewing a Super PAC and relying predominantly on small-dollar contributions. According to Federal Election Commission filings, the Sanders campaign had raised the most money in the 2020 Democratic field as of June 2019, including money left over from his 2018 Senate and 2016 presidential races. In September 2019, the Sanders campaign became the fastest in U.S. history to reach one million donors. On October 1, 2019, the campaign announced it had raised $25.3 million in the year&#x27;s third quarter, with an average donation of $18. It was the largest quarterly sum raised by any Democratic candidate. The campaign raised $34.5 million during the fourth quarter of 2019.

===Polls and news coverage===
Sanders steadily polled between 15% and 20% on most national surveys between May and September 2019, according to the RealClearPolitics average. This placed him in a decisive second-place behind Joe Biden until Elizabeth Warren and Kamala Harris caught up in July. From mid-February 2020 to the start of March, Sanders polled in first place in the Democratic primary ahead of Joe Biden and was described by the press as the party&#x27;s presidential front-runner.

According to a RealClearPolitics analysis, Sanders received the third-most mentions on CNN, Fox News, and MSNBC between January and August 2019, trailing only Joe Biden and Kamala Harris. Biden, however, received twice as many mentions as Sanders and Harris. Mentions of Sanders on &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; found him in second place, though also trailing Biden by a large margin. Online mentions &quot;reflect a slightly more balanced picture&quot;, with both Sanders and Elizabeth Warren running &quot;neck-and-neck&quot; with Biden.

===Forums and other appearances===
On April 6, 2019, Sanders participated in a Fox News town hall that attracted more than 2.55 million viewers. His decision to appear on Fox was controversial, given the Democratic National Committee&#x27;s decision not to allow Fox to host any of its debates. His appearance saw an increase of Fox News viewers by 24% overall and 40% in the 25-to-54-year-old demographic, surpassing the ratings of all other Democratic presidential candidate town halls that year. As of September 2019, the town hall had received more than 1.5 million views on YouTube.

On August 6, 2019, Sanders appeared on &quot;The Joe Rogan Experience&quot; podcast. Some praised Rogan for &quot;hosting a pragmatic discussion&quot; while others &quot;seemed rather stunned by Sanders&#x27;s decision to appear on the show at all.&quot; After the podcast, Rogan became a top-trending Twitter topic. After interviewing him, Rogan said, &quot;I am not right-wing ... I&#x27;ve interviewed right-wing people. I am 100% left-wing ... Bernie Sanders made a ton of sense to me and I would 100% vote for him.&quot; As of October 2019, the podcast had received more than ten million views on YouTube.

===Presidential debates===

In December 2018, the Democratic National Committee (DNC) announced the preliminary schedule for 12 official DNC-sanctioned debates, set to begin in June 2019, with six in 2019 and the remaining six during the first four months of 2020. During the July and September debates, commentators described Sanders and Elizabeth Warren as having a &quot;non-aggression pact&quot;, staking out similar progressive positions in contrast to the more conservative candidates. In the October 15 debate, his first appearance since his heart attack, debate coach Todd Graham gave Sanders&#x27;s performance an A, his highest rating of all the candidates.

CNN hosted the first 2020 debate in January with six candidates remaining. Co-moderator Abby Phillip questioned Sanders and Warren about an allegation Warren had made that he had privately told her that a woman could not defeat Donald Trump. Phillip asked Sanders, &quot;Senator Sanders, CNN reported yesterday, and Senator Warren confirmed in a statement, that in 2018 you told her that you did not believe that a woman could win the election. Why did you say that?&quot; Ignoring Sanders&#x27;s strong denial, Phillip asked Warren, &quot;What did you think when Bernie Sanders told you that a woman couldn&#x27;t become president?&quot; In an interview after the debate, Sanders called it ludicrous to believe that he would doubt a woman&#x27;s ability to win the presidency and noted that a woman already &quot;had&quot; won the national popular vote, saying, &quot;After all, Hillary Clinton beat Donald Trump by 3 million votes in 2016.&quot;

===Suspension of campaign===
Sanders announced that he was suspending his campaign on April 8, 2020. He stated that he would remain on the ballot in the remaining states and continue to accumulate delegates with the goal of influencing the Democratic Party&#x27;s platform. On April 14, Sanders endorsed Biden. Biden responded, &quot;I think that your endorsement means a great deal. It means a great deal to me. I think people are going to be surprised that we are apart on some issues but we&#x27;re awfully close on a whole bunch of others. I&#x27;m going to need you—not just to win the campaign, but to govern.&quot;

==Political positions==


A self-described democratic socialist, Sanders is a progressive and left-wing populist who admires social democratic programs in Europe and supports workplace democracy via union democracy, worker cooperatives, and workers&#x27; management of public enterprises. He is a strong critic of contemporary neoliberal capitalism, which he calls &quot;uber-capitalism&quot;, blaming it for such societal ills as declining life expectancy and rising diseases of despair. He advocates universal, single-payer healthcare, paid parental leave, and tuition-free tertiary education. He supports lowering the cost of drugs by reforming patent laws to allow cheaper generic versions to be sold in the U.S. He supported the Affordable Care Act, though he said it did not go far enough. In November 2015, he gave a speech at Georgetown University about his view of democratic socialism, including its place in the policies of presidents Franklin D. Roosevelt and Lyndon B. Johnson. Defining what &quot;democratic socialism&quot; means to him, Sanders said: &quot;I don&#x27;t believe government should take over the grocery store down the street or own the means of production, but I do believe that the middle class and the working families who produce the wealth of America deserve a decent standard of living and that their incomes should go up, not down.&quot;

Based on his positions and votes throughout his career, many commentators consider his political platform primarily focused on tax-funded social benefits inspired by the Nordic model and not on social ownership of the means of production. Some socialists and major socialist organizations have described Sanders as a democratic socialist, market socialist, or reformist socialist, while others have called him a reformist social democrat.

Bhaskar Sunkara has characterized Sanders&#x27; politics as &quot;class struggle social democracy&quot;, arguing that while postwar social democracy operated as a compromise that instituted tripartite arrangements between business, labor, and government to dampen class conflict, Sanders sees social democratic demands as a means to sharpening class confrontation and raising class consciousness. His views have been echoed by George Eaton, arguing that Sunkara&#x27;s phrase &quot;captures the nuances of Sanders&#x27; politics in a way that a socialist / social democrat binary does not&quot; and asserting that if he was elected president it would represent &quot;the triumph of a politics that is neither wholly socialist, nor social democratic, but a new fusion of both&quot;.

===Climate change===
Sanders views global warming as a serious problem, and advocates bold action to reverse its effects. He calls for substantial investment in infrastructure, with energy efficiency, sustainability, and job creation as prominent goals. He considers climate change the greatest threat to national security. He said that family planning can help fight climate change. He opposed the construction of the Dakota Access Pipeline on the grounds that, like the Keystone XL Pipeline, it &quot;will have a significant impact on our climate.&quot; In 2019, he announced his support for Green New Deal legislation and joined representatives Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and Earl Blumenauer in proposing legislation that would declare climate change a national and international emergency.

===Economic issues===
Sanders focuses on economic issues such as income and wealth inequality, poverty, raising the minimum wage, universal healthcare, cancelling all student debt, making public colleges and universities tuition-free by taxing financial transactions, establishing a 32-hour work week, and expanding Social Security benefits by eliminating the cap on the payroll tax on all incomes above $250,000. He has become a prominent supporter of laws requiring companies to give their workers parental leave, sick leave, and vacation time, noting that such laws have been adopted by nearly all other developed countries. He also supports legislation that would make it easier for workers to join or form a trade union. He was against the Troubled Asset Relief Program and has called for comprehensive financial reforms, such as breaking up &quot;too big to fail&quot; financial institutions, restoring Glass–Steagall legislation, reforming the Federal Reserve Bank, and allowing the Post Office to offer basic financial services in economically marginalized communities.

Believing greater emphasis is needed on labor rights and environmental concerns when negotiating international trade agreements, Sanders voted against and has long spoken against NAFTA, CAFTA, and PNTR with China. He has called them a &quot;disaster for the American worker&quot;, saying that they have resulted in American corporations moving abroad. He also opposes the Trans-Pacific Partnership, which he says was &quot;written by corporate America and the pharmaceutical industry and Wall Street.&quot; On May 1, 2019, he tweeted: &quot;Since the China trade deal I voted against, America has lost over three million manufacturing jobs. It&#x27;s wrong to pretend that China isn&#x27;t one of our major economic competitors.&quot;

Sanders also strongly opposes outsourcing American jobs. During discussions of the United States Innovation and Competition Act, which was to be used to fund the manufacture of semiconductors amid a shortage, he proposed a measure to ensure the companies the bill funded could not outsource their jobs. The proposed measure would also block the companies from forbidding their employees to unionize. Sanders&#x27;s proposal was voted down by most Democrats and all Republicans in the Senate. Ahead of the 2022 midterms, Sanders said he wants the Democratic Party to focus more on supporting unionization: &quot;I think we should move to a system where, if 50% of the workers in a bargaining unit plus one vote to form a union, they have a union. End of discussion.&quot;

Sanders supports establishing worker-owned cooperatives and introduced legislation numerous times from the 1990s to the 2020s that would aid workers who want to &quot;form their own businesses or to set up worker-owned cooperatives.&quot; As early as 1976, Sanders proposed workplace democracy, saying, &quot;I believe that, in the long run, major industries in this state and nation should be publicly owned and controlled by the workers themselves.&quot; Likewise, he supports empowering and expanding labor unions to advance union democracy. In 1987, Sanders defined democracy as public ownership and workers&#x27; self-management in the workplace, saying: &quot;Democracy means public ownership of the major means of production, it means decentralization, it means involving people in their work. Rather than having bosses and workers it means having democratic control over the factories and shops to as great a degree as you can.&quot; In his 2020 run for president, he proposed that 20% of stocks in corporations with over $100 million in annual revenue be owned by the corporation&#x27;s workers and that 45% of the board of directors of corporations with over $100 million in annual revenue be elected by the workers of that corporation.

===Foreign policy===

Sanders supports reducing military spending while pursuing more diplomacy and international cooperation. He opposed funding Nicaraguan rebels, known as contras, in the CIA&#x27;s covert war against Nicaragua&#x27;s leftist government. He opposed the U.S. invasion of Iraq and has criticized a number of policies instituted during the War on Terror, particularly that of mass surveillance and the USA Patriot Act. He criticized Israel&#x27;s actions during the 2014 Gaza war and U.S. involvement in the Saudi Arabian-led intervention in Yemen. On November 15, 2015, in response to the Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL)&#x27;s attacks in Paris, he cautioned against Islamophobia and said, &quot;We gotta be tough, not stupid&quot; in the war against ISIL, adding that the U.S. should continue to welcome Syrian refugees. He criticized the January 2020 drone assassination of Iranian general Qasem Soleimani, calling it a dangerous escalation of tensions that could lead to an expensive war.

Sanders supports Palestinian rights and has criticized Israel on several occasions. In 2020, he called the American Israel Public Affairs Committee a platform for bigotry and said he would not attend its conference. He condemned Trump&#x27;s decision to recognize Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s capital, saying, &quot;It would dramatically undermine the prospects for an Israeli–Palestinian peace agreement, and severely, perhaps irreparably, damage the United States&#x27; ability to broker that peace.&quot; During the 2023 Israel–Hamas war, he criticized Hamas for its attacks on civilians and criticized Israel for its bombing of Gaza. He first called for a pause in fighting, saying that he &quot;doesn&#x27;t know if a ceasefire is possible with an organization like Hamas&quot;, but later called for a humanitarian ceasefire and urged Biden to withhold military aid to Israel.

Addressing Westminster College in a September 2017 speech, Sanders laid out a foreign policy plan for greater international collaboration, adherence to U.S.-led international agreements such as the Paris Agreement and the Iran nuclear deal framework and promoting human rights and democratic ideals. He emphasized the consequences associated with global economic inequality and climate change and urged reining in the use of U.S. military power, saying it &quot;must always be a last resort&quot;. He also criticized U.S. support for &quot;murderous regimes&quot; during the Cold War, such as those in Iran, Chile and El Salvador and said that those actions continue to make the U.S. less safe. He also spoke critically of Russian interference in the 2016 U.S. elections and the way President Trump has handled the crisis. He does not consider Turkey a U.S. ally and condemned the Turkish military offensive against U.S.-aligned Kurdish forces in northeastern Syria.

===Gun laws===
Sanders supports closing the &quot;gun show loophole&quot;, banning assault weapons, and passing and enforcing universal federal background checks for gun purchases. In 1990, his bid to become a U.S. Representative benefitted from the National Rifle Association of America opposing the competing campaign of Peter Smith, who had reversed his stance on firearm restrictions, and waiting periods for handgun purchases. In 1993, while a U.S. representative, he voted against the Brady Handgun Violence Prevention Act (which established background checks and wait periods), and in 2005 voted for legislation that gave gun manufacturers legal immunity against claims of negligence, but he has since said that he would support repealing that law. In 1996, he voted against additional funding to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention for research on issues related to firearms, but in 2016, he called for an increase in CDC funding for the study of gun violence.

===Social issues===
On social issues, Sanders has long taken progressive stances. He considers himself a feminist, is pro-choice on abortion, and opposes defunding Planned Parenthood. He has long advocated for LGBT rights; in 2009, he supported legalizing same-sex marriage in Vermont. Sanders has denounced institutional racism and called for criminal justice reform to reduce the number of people in prison, advocates a crackdown on police brutality, and supports abolishing private, for-profit prisons and the death penalty. He supports Black Lives Matter. He also supports legalizing marijuana at the federal level. He has advocated for greater democratic participation by citizens, campaign finance reform, and a constitutional amendment or judicial decision that would overturn &quot;Citizens United v. FEC&quot;.

===Trump administration===
Sanders criticized President Trump for appointing multiple billionaires to his cabinet. He criticized Trump&#x27;s rolling back President Obama&#x27;s Clean Power Plan, noting the scientifically reported effect on climate change of human activity and citing Trump&#x27;s calling those reports a hoax. He called for caution on the Syrian Civil War, saying, &quot;It&#x27;s easier to get into a war than out of one.&quot; In 2017, he promised to defeat &quot;Trump and Trumpism and the Republican right-wing ideology&quot;.

Sanders gave an online reply to Trump&#x27;s January 2018 State of the Union address in which he called Trump &quot;compulsively dishonest&quot; and criticized him for initiating &quot;a looming immigration crisis&quot; by ending the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program. He voiced concern about Trump&#x27;s failure to mention the finding that Russia had interfered in the 2016 election and &quot;will likely interfere in the 2018 midterms we will be holding ... Unless you have a very special relationship with Mr. Putin.&quot;

On January 6, 2021, Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol. Sanders commented: &quot;[Trump] has made it clear that he will do anything to remain in powerincluding insurrection and inciting violence [and he] will go down in history as the worst and most dangerous president in history.&quot;

Sanders voted to convict Trump on both articles of his first impeachment trial in 2020 (for pressuring a foreign leader to investigate Joe Biden), and again on the sole article of his second impeachment trial in 2021 (for inciting the Capitol attack).

===Biden administration===
Sanders influenced the environmental policy goals of the Biden administration as described before Biden&#x27;s nomination. Biden&#x27;s policy team adopted certain details from the Biden-Sanders Unity Task Forces&#x27; climate recommendations.

After Biden was elected president, Sanders became the subject of speculation over a potential appointment as Labor Secretary, which was supported by several progressive groups, such as the Sunrise Movement. For his part, Sanders said that he would accept Biden&#x27;s nomination if it was offered, but Boston mayor Marty Walsh was chosen for the position instead. When announcing Walsh&#x27;s nomination, Biden confirmed that he had discussed the position with Sanders, but the two agreed that Sanders&#x27;s resignation from the Senate and the ensuing special election would have put the Democrats&#x27; slim Senate majority at risk.

On February 23, 2021, Sanders became the first senator in the Democratic caucus to oppose one of Biden&#x27;s cabinet picks when he voted against Tom Vilsack&#x27;s confirmation as Agriculture Secretary, citing concerns about Vilsack&#x27;s past work as a lobbyist and ties to large corporations.

Sanders strongly supported Senate Democrats&#x27; decision to use budget reconciliation, a procedure used to avoid filibusters, to pass the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021, despite having criticized Republicans&#x27; use of reconciliation to pass the 2017 tax cuts. The bill passed the Senate by a 50–49 vote and was signed into law by Biden on March 11, 2021.

Sanders has continued to have a strong influence on the Biden administration. When it was noted that he had become a key voice in Biden&#x27;s administration, he replied, &quot;As somebody who wrote a book called &quot;Outsider in the House&quot;, yes, it is a strange experience to be having that kind of influence that we have now.&quot; Their relationship has lasted over 30 years and Sanders has said it is based on respect and trust: &quot;We have had a good relationship. He wants to be a champion of working families, and I admire that and respect that.&quot;

Before the 2022 midterm election, Sanders said he regarded it as deciding the fate of democracy, abortion, and climate change, calling it &quot;the most consequential midterm election&quot; of modern U.S. history. He expressed a fear that the Democratic Party had &quot;not done a good enough job&quot; of getting its message out &quot;to young people and working-class people.&quot;

In April 2023, Sanders endorsed Biden in the 2024 United States presidential election, and after Biden withdrew from the race, Sanders endorsed Harris for president at the Democratic National Convention. After Donald Trump won the 2024 presidential election, Sanders released a statement blaming the Democratic Party&#x27;s abandonment of &quot;working-class people&quot; for its defeat.

==Party affiliations==
Born into a Democratic-voting family, Sanders was first introduced to political activism when his brother Larry joined the Young Democrats of America and campaigned for Adlai Stevenson II in 1956. Sanders joined Vermont&#x27;s Liberty Union Party in 1971 and was a candidate for several offices, never coming close to winning election. He became party chairman, but quit in 1977 to become an independent. In 1980, he served as an elector for the Socialist Workers Party. In 1981, Sanders ran as an independent for mayor of Burlington, Vermont, and defeated the Democratic incumbent; he was reelected three times. Although an independent, he endorsed Democratic presidential candidates Walter Mondale in 1984 and Jesse Jackson in 1988. His endorsement of Mondale was lukewarm (telling reporters that &quot;if you go around saying that Mondale would be a great president, you would be a liar and a hypocrite&quot;), but he supported Jackson enthusiastically. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; reported that the Jackson campaign helped inspire Sanders to work more closely with the Democratic Party.

Sanders attended the 1983 conference of the Socialist Party USA where he gave a speech.

Sanders first ran for the U.S. House of Representatives in 1988 and for the U.S. Senate in 2006, each time adopting a strategy of winning the Democratic Party primary, thereby eliminating Democratic challengers, and then running as an independent in the general election. He continued this strategy through his reelection in the 2018 United States Senate election in Vermont. Throughout his tenure in Congress, he has been listed as an independent. He caucused with Democrats in the House while refusing to join the party, and continues to caucus with Democrats in the Senate. Some conservative southern House Democrats initially barred him from the caucus as they believed that allowing a self-described socialist to join would harm their electoral prospects. He soon came to work constructively with Democrats, voting with the party over 90% of the time during his tenure in Congress.

Starting with his 2016 presidential campaign, Sanders&#x27;s announcements suggested that not only was he running as a Democrat, but that he would run as a Democrat in future elections. When challenged by Clinton about his party commitment, he said, &quot;Of course I am a Democrat and running for the Democratic nomination.&quot; Since he remained a senator elected as an independent, his U.S. Senate website and press materials continued to refer to him as an independent during the campaign and upon his return to the Senate. In October 2017, Sanders said he would run for reelection as an independent in 2018 despite pressure to run as a Democrat. His party status became ambiguous again in March 2019 when he signed a formal &quot;loyalty pledge&quot; to the Democratic Party stating that he was a member of the party and would serve as a Democrat if elected president. He signed the pledge the day after he signed paperwork to run as an independent for reelection to the Senate in 2024.

After Trump&#x27;s victory in the 2016 elections, Sanders suggested the Democratic Party undergo a series of reforms and that it &quot;break loose from its corporate establishment ties and, once again, become a grass-roots party of working people, the elderly and the poor.&quot; He drew parallels between his campaign and that of the Labour Party in the 2017 UK general election. He wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that &quot;the British elections should be a lesson for the Democratic Party&quot; and urged the Democrats to stop holding on to an &quot;overly cautious, centrist ideology&quot;, arguing that &quot;momentum shifted to Labour after it released a very progressive manifesto that generated much enthusiasm among young people and workers.&quot; He had earlier praised Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s stance on class issues. Sanders is one of two independents in the Senate, along with Angus King, both of whom caucus with the Democrats.

==Personal life==

In 1963, Sanders and Deborah Shiling Messing, whom he met in college, volunteered for several months on the Israeli kibbutz Sha&#x27;ar HaAmakim. They married in 1964 and bought a summer home in Vermont; they had no children and divorced in 1966. His son (and only biological child), Levi Sanders, was born in 1969 to then-girlfriend Susan Campbell Mott.

On May 28, 1988, Sanders married Jane O&#x27;Meara Driscoll (), who later became president of Burlington College, in Burlington, Vermont. The day after their wedding, the couple visited the Soviet Union as part of an official delegation in his capacity as mayor. They own a row house in Capitol Hill, a house in Burlington&#x27;s New North End neighborhood, and a lakefront summer home in North Hero. He considers Jane&#x27;s three children—Dave Driscoll (born 1975), Carina Driscoll (born 1974), and Heather Titus (; 1971)—to be his own.

Sanders&#x27;s elder brother, Larry, lives in England; he was a Green Party county councillor, representing the East Oxford division on Oxfordshire County Council, until he retired from the council in 2013. Larry ran as a Green Party candidate for Oxford West and Abingdon in the 2015 British general election and came in fifth. Bernie Sanders told CNN, &quot;I owe my brother an enormous amount. It was my brother who actually introduced me to a lot of my ideas.&quot;

===Health===
On October 1, 2019, Sanders was hospitalized after experiencing chest pains at a campaign event in Las Vegas. His campaign announced the next day that a blockage had been found in one coronary artery and two stents inserted. Scheduled campaign events and appearances were canceled until further notice. Two days later his campaign released a statement that he had been diagnosed with a heart attack. He was released from the hospital the same day. The statement included the following from Sanders&#x27;s doctors:
A few days after returning home, Sanders addressed media outside his home and said he had experienced fatigue and chest discomfort for a month or two before the incident; he expressed regret for not seeking medical assessment sooner: &quot;I was dumb.&quot;

Sanders made his first national appearance after his heart attack on October 15 at the Democratic debate, at which he said, &quot;I&#x27;m healthy, I&#x27;m feeling great.&quot; When asked how he would reassure voters about his health and ability to take on the duties of the presidency, he said, &quot;We are going to be mounting a vigorous campaign all over this country. That is how I think I can reassure the American people.&quot; It was noted that he was &quot;lively and sharp at the debate.&quot;

In December 2019, three months after the heart attack, Sanders released letters from three physicians, Attending Physician of Congress Brian P. Monahan and two cardiologists, who declared Sanders healthy and recovered from his heart condition.

===Honors and awards===
On December 4, 2015, Sanders won &quot;Time&quot;″s 2015 Person of the Year readers&#x27; poll with 10.2% of the vote but did not receive the editorial board&#x27;s award. On March 20, 2016, he was given an honorary Lushootseed name, , by Deborah Parker in Seattle to honor his focus on Native American issues during his presidential campaign.

On May 30, 2017, Sanders received an honorary degree of Doctor of Humane Letters from Brooklyn College.

===Religion, heritage, and values===
As Sanders described his upbringing as an American Jew in a 2016 speech: his father generally attended synagogue only on Yom Kippur; he attended public schools while his mother &quot;chafed&quot; at his yeshiva Sunday schooling at a Hebrew school; and their religious observances were mostly limited to Passover seders with their neighbors. Larry Sanders said of their parents, &quot;They were very pleased to be Jews, but didn&#x27;t have a strong belief in God.&quot; Bernie had a bar mitzvah at the historic Kingsway Jewish Center in Midwood, Brooklyn, where he grew up.

In 1963, in cooperation with the Labor Zionist youth movement Hashomer Hatzair, Sanders and his first wife volunteered at Sha&#x27;ar HaAmakim, a kibbutz in northern Israel. His motivation for the trip was as much socialistic as it was Zionistic.

As mayor of Burlington, Sanders allowed a Chabad public menorah to be placed at city hall, an action the ACLU contested. He publicly inaugurated the Hanukkah menorah and performed the Jewish religious ritual of blessing Hanukkah candles. His early and strong support played a significant role in the now widespread public menorah celebrations around the globe. When asked about his Jewish heritage, Sanders has said that he is &quot;proud to be Jewish.&quot;

Sanders rarely speaks about religion. He describes himself as &quot;not particularly religious&quot; and &quot;not actively involved&quot; with organized religion. A press package issued by his office states his religion as Jewish. He has said he believes in God, but not necessarily in a traditional way: &quot;I think everyone believes in God in their own ways&quot;, he said. &quot;To me, it means that all of us are connected, all of life is connected, and that we are all tied together.&quot; In October 2015, on the late-night talk show &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot;, Kimmel asked him, &quot;You say you are culturally Jewish and you don&#x27;t feel religious; do you believe in God and do you think that&#x27;s important to the people of the United States?&quot; Sanders replied:

In 2016, he disclosed that he had &quot;very strong religious and spiritual feelings&quot;, adding, &quot;My spirituality is that we are all in this together and that when children go hungry, when veterans sleep out on the street, it impacts me.&quot;

Sanders does not regularly attend synagogue, and he does not refrain from working on Rosh Hashanah, as observant Jews do. He has attended yahrzeit observances in memory of the deceased, for the father of a friend, and in 2015 attended a Tashlikh, an atonement ceremony, with the mayor of Lynchburg on the afternoon of Rosh Hashanah. According to Richard Sugarman, his Jewish identity is &quot;certainly more ethnic and cultural than religious.&quot; His wife is Roman Catholic, and he has often expressed admiration for Pope Francis, saying that &quot;the leader of the Catholic Church is raising profound issues. It is important that we listen to what he has said.&quot; He has said he feels very close to Francis&#x27;s economic teachings, describing him as &quot;incredibly smart and brave&quot;. In April 2016, he accepted an invitation from Marcelo Sánchez Sorondo, an aide close to Francis, to speak at a Vatican conference on economic and environmental issues. While at the Vatican, he met briefly with Francis.

==In popular culture==
In December 1987, during his tenure as mayor of Burlington, Sanders recorded a folk album, &quot;We Shall Overcome&quot;, with 30 Vermont musicians. As he was not a skilled singer, he performed his vocals in a talking blues style.

===Internet culture===
Owing to his two high-profile campaigns in the 2016 and 2020 Democratic primaries, Sanders and his campaigns have generated many Internet memes and other online content. The Facebook group Bernie Sanders&#x27; Dank Meme Stash, where users can submit memes focused around Sanders, received significant attention in the 2016 primary season due to the at-the-time unique idea of a meme community focused entirely on a politician. During the 2020 primary season, a still from a fundraising video in which Sanders tells the viewers &quot;I am once again asking for your financial support&quot; went viral online, with numerous edits made of the frame. The day before Super Tuesday 2020, a video of the Twitch streamer Neekolul wearing a Bernie 2020 shirt and lip-syncing the song &quot;Oki Doki Boomer&quot; also went viral. In 2021, a frame from the inauguration of Joe Biden showing Sanders seated in a folding chair wearing patterned mittens and a jacket reminiscent of the one in the &quot;I am once again asking&quot; meme went viral, with the image captioned or edited into other images, most commonly popular movie scenes.

===In film and television===
Sanders appeared in a cameo role in the 1988 comedy-drama film &quot;Sweet Hearts Dance&quot;, playing a man who distributes candy to young trick-or-treaters. In 1999, he acted in the film &quot;My X-Girlfriend&#x27;s Wedding Reception&quot;, playing Rabbi Manny Shevitz. In this role, he mourned the Brooklyn Dodgers&#x27; move to Los Angeles, reflecting Sanders&#x27;s own upbringing in Brooklyn. On February 6, 2016, he was a guest star alongside Larry David (who is a sixth cousin once removed of Sanders) on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, playing a Polish immigrant on a steamship that was sinking near the Statue of Liberty.

In the DC Extended Universe film &quot;Birds of Prey (and the Fantabulous Emancipation of One Harley Quinn)&quot;, one of the reasons Roman Sionis wants Harley Quinn dead is that she &quot;voted for Bernie&quot;.

<text>Acadiana (; French and Louisiana French: &quot;L&#x27;Acadiane&quot; or &quot;Acadiane&quot;), also known as Cajun Country (Louisiana French: &quot;Pays des Cadiens&quot;), is the official name given to the French Louisiana region that has historically contained much of the state&#x27;s Francophone population.

Many inhabitants of Cajun Country have Acadian ancestry and identify as Cajuns or Creoles. Of the 64 parishes that make up the U.S. state of Louisiana, 22 named parishes and other parishes of similar cultural environment make up this intrastate region. Lafayette Parish and the seven surrounding parishes are identified as the &quot;Cajun Heartland, USA&quot; district.

== Etymology ==
The word &quot;Acadiana&quot; reputedly has two origins. Its first recorded appearance dates to the October 15, 1946, when a Crowley, Louisiana, newspaper, the &quot;Crowley Daily Signal&quot;, coined the term in reference to the area of Louisiana in which French descendants of the Acadians settled. However, KATC television in Lafayette independently coined &quot;Acadiana&quot; in the early 1960s, giving it a new, broader meaning, and popularized it throughout southern Louisiana. Founded in 1962, KATC was owned by the Acadian Television Corporation. In early 1963, the ABC affiliate received an invoice erroneously addressed to the &quot;Acadiana&quot; Television Corp. Someone had typed an extra &quot;a&quot; at the end of the word &quot;Acadian&quot;. The station started using it to describe the region covered by its broadcast signal.

Today, numerous business, governmental, and nonprofit organizations incorporate Acadiana in their names, e.g., Mall of Acadiana and Acadiana High School. Notably, KLFY-TV, the regional CBS affiliate, used the term in its &quot;Hello News&quot; branding campaign as &quot;Hello Acadiana&quot;. KATC hosts a morning television show, &quot;Good Morning Acadiana&quot;.

== History ==
Historically part of French Louisiana, present-day Acadiana was inhabited by Attakapa Native Americans at the time of European encounter. After the expulsion of French-speaking Acadian refugees from Canada by the victorious British at the end of the Seven Years&#x27; War, many Acadians settled in this region. The Acadians intermarried with other settlers, forming what became known as Cajun culture.

In 1971, the Louisiana State Legislature officially recognized 22 Louisiana parishes and &quot;other parishes of similar cultural environment&quot; for their &quot;strong French Acadian cultural aspects&quot;. It made &quot;The Heart of Acadiana&quot; the official name of the region, although the term &quot;Acadiana&quot; is the more common name for the region. The official term appears on regional maps and highway markers.

===Effects of hurricanes===
Like much of Louisiana, this area is subject to damaging hurricanes. On October 3, 2002, the central Acadiana region suffered a direct hit from category one Hurricane Lili. The hurricane caused most of Acadiana to lose power, and some areas lost phone service. In addition, some high-rise buildings in downtown Lafayette had windows broken, and the roofs were damaged of many homes throughout the region. The high winds of Lili toppled the tower of KLFY TV-10 onto the station&#x27;s studio facilities. Only one injury inside the station was reported from the tower&#x27;s collapse.

The eastern Acadiana region was somewhat affected by Hurricane Katrina on August 29, 2005, although the damage was limited compared to the severe flooding farther east in Greater New Orleans. This area was used by many evacuees when they returned to the region as a &quot;last stop&quot; of temporary domicile before returning to Greater New Orleans. The Greater Baton Rouge area had already been handling numerous evacuees. Governor Kathleen Blanco made a public request that those returning not try to seek lodging in the capital due to this crisis of overpopulation.

Lafayette and several other municipalities set up both public and church-run shelters to handle the influx. The largest of these shelters, run by the Red Cross, was the Lafayette sports arena (the Cajundome), holding a reported 9,800 persons.

The western Acadiana region and east Texas were most affected by Hurricane Rita which hit on September 24, 2005. The Greater Lake Charles metropolitan area suffered the majority of the damage.

On Labor Day 2008, Hurricane Gustav caused severe damage to the region. Although Lafayette, Saint Martinville and Crowley had little damage (comparatively) and some residents still had power, the rest of the region was severely affected. From Alexandria to the coast and Baton Rouge to Lake Charles, massive power failures and flooding were reported. Most notable was the flooding south of Louisiana Highway 14 and the communities there. U.S. 90 was shut down for several days due to the flooding caused by Hurricane Gustav.

The total death toll from Hurricane Gustav in Acadiana was limited. This was attributed to the evacuation and mitigation plans that had been drilled by state and local official, and to a strong presence of representatives from both the Department of Homeland Security and the Federal Emergency Management Agency. In total, almost two million people along the Louisiana coast were evacuated in over two days. Gustav preparations comprised the largest evacuation in Louisiana history, and one of the most successful evacuations in the nation&#x27;s history.

In 2020, Hurricane Laura caused significant damage to the western-most portion of Acadiana, including Calcasieu, Cameron, Jeff Davis, and portions of Vermilion and Acadia. A confirmed 18 people died in the storm and its aftermath. In addition, Intracoastal City saw a storm surge of . Storm surge also flooded over SH 317 at Burns Point in St. Mary Parish, and flash flooding surrounded homes in Abbeville.

Six weeks later, Hurricane Delta made landfall near Creole, Louisiana, with winds of 100 mph. Virtually the same parishes were affected by Hurricanes Laura and Delta. Over 740,000 residents had no power following both storms.

==Geography==
Acadiana consists mainly of low gentle hills in the north section and dry land prairies, with marshes and bayous in the south closer to the Gulf Coast area. The wetlands increase in frequency in and around the Calcasieu River, Atchafalaya Basin, and the Mississippi River Delta. The area is cultivated with fields of rice and sugarcane.

Acadiana, as defined by the Louisiana legislature, refers to the area that stretches from just west of New Orleans to the Texas border along the Gulf of Mexico coast, and about inland to Marksville. This includes the 22 parishes of Acadia, Ascension, Assumption, Avoyelles, Calcasieu, Cameron, Evangeline, Iberia, Iberville, Jefferson Davis, Lafayette, Lafourche, Pointe Coupee, St. Charles, St. James, St. John The Baptist, St. Landry, St. Martin, St. Mary, Terrebonne, Vermilion, and West Baton Rouge. The total land area of Acadiana is . If Acadiana was a U.S. state, it would be larger than Maryland; if it were a sovereign state, it would be larger than the Bahamas.

Three of the parishes (St. Charles, St. James, and St. John the Baptist) are considered the River Parishes and made up the area formerly known as the German Coast or &quot;les côtes des Allemands&quot;, because of settlement by German immigrants in the 18th century. Ascension Parish is sometimes included within the River Parishes; the River Parishes border the first and third largest regions in Louisiana by population (the Greater New Orleans area and Florida Parishes). St. James and Ascension parishes were originally known as the &quot;Comté d&#x27;Acadie&quot; (Acadia County) because of the initial settlement of 18th-century exiled Acadians. St. James Parish was known as the First Acadian Coast and Ascension Parish was known as the Second Acadian Coast. Collectively they were known as &quot;les côtes des Acadiens&quot;, the Acadian Coasts.

===Major cities===
The largest metropolitan areas in Acadiana are Lafayette, Lake Charles, and Houma-Thibodaux. Other cities and towns within Acadiana are Abbeville, Berwick, Breaux Bridge, Broussard, Bunkie, Carencro, Church Point, Crowley, Delcambre, Donaldsonville, Erath, Eunice, Franklin, Gonzales, Gueydan, Jeanerette, Jennings, Kaplan, Lutcher, Mamou, Marksville, Maurice, Morgan City, New Iberia, New Roads, Opelousas, Patterson, Plaquemine, Port Allen, Rayne, Scott, Simmesport, St. Amant, St. Gabriel, St. Martinville, Sulphur, Sunset, Ville Platte, and Youngsville.

== Demographics ==

At the 2000 U.S. census the total population of Acadiana was 1,352,646 residents. At the 2019 American Community Survey, the tabulated population of Acadiana was an estimated 1,490,449. In 2020, the tabulated population of Acadiana&#x27;s parishes was 1,486,345.

=== Cajun-Creole ethnicity ===

Cajuns are the descendants of 18th-century Acadian exiles from what are now Canada&#x27;s Maritime Provinces, expelled by the British and New Englanders during and after the French and Indian War (see Expulsion of the Acadians). They prevail among the region&#x27;s visible cultures, but not everyone who lives in Acadiana is ethnically Acadian or speaks Louisiana French. Similarly, not everyone who is culturally &quot;Cajun&quot; is descended from the Acadian refugees.

German and Polish settlers found their way to this area as early as 1721, settling an area that became known as the German Coast. They preceded the Acadians. Acadiana is home to several Native American tribes, including the Chitimacha, Houma, Tunica-Biloxi, Attakapas, and Coushatta. Acadiana also is home to other ethnic groups, including Anglo-Americans, who came into the region in increasing numbers beginning notably with the Louisiana Purchase of 1803. Since the late 20th century, political refugees from Southeast Asia (Laos, Vietnam, and Cambodia, among others) have brought their families, cultures, and languages to the area, and have contributed significantly to its fishing industry.

The region also boasts a large population of Creoles, descendants of the region&#x27;s original settlers who arrived in Louisiana before and after the arrival of the Acadians. In the broadest sense, the term &quot;Creole&quot; has been used to denote anyone who is &quot;native to Louisiana&quot;, regardless of race or ethnic origin. In this sense, Creoles can identify as black, white, and persons of mixed-race origin. The term has also come to denote cultural origins in addition to racial classification. While many in Acadiana associate Creoles specifically with those people descended from the (free people of color), others cling to the word&#x27;s original definition, so Creoles of every ethnic background are still present in the region. Many Creoles also identify as Cajuns (and vice versa), whereas others reject association with one identity while still claiming the other. The two identities have never been mutually exclusive of one another, and documents written in Acadiana throughout the 19th century often make references to Acadiana&#x27;s &quot;Creole populations&quot; that are understood to include people of Acadian descent.

Prior to the U.S. Civil War, Louisiana Creoles of color were a class of free people who either gained their freedom or were born into free families. The played an important role in the history of New Orleans and French Louisiana, both under French and Spanish occupation, and after the Louisiana Purchase by the United States. Some Creoles of color were wealthy businessmen, entrepreneurs, clothiers, real estate developers, doctors, and other respected professions; they owned estates and properties in French Louisiana. Being a French, and later Spanish colony, Louisiana maintained a three-tiered society that was very similar to other Latin American and Caribbean countries.

In the colonial period of French and Spanish rule, men tended to marry later after becoming financially established. Men frequently took Native American women as their wives (see Marriage), and as slaves were imported into the colony, settlers also took African wives. Intermarriage between the different groups of Louisiana created a large multiracial Creole population.

As more families settled Louisiana, young Frenchmen or French Creoles coming from wealthy backgrounds courted mixed-race women as their mistresses, known as , before they officially married. The developed formal arrangements for , which the young women&#x27;s mothers negotiated. Under the system of , the suitor had to be wealthy and prove that he could support the daughter, and take care of their children. Often the mothers arranged a kind of dowry or property transfer to their daughters; if the daughter was a slave, she and their children would gain freedom. The fathers often paid for the education of their mixed-race children from relationships, especially if they were sons, generally sending them to France to be educated.

Many descendants of the , or free people of color, of the Louisiana area celebrate their culture and heritage through a New Orleans–based Louisiana Creole Research Association (LA ). The term is not synonymous with &quot;free people of color&quot; or , but many members of LA have traced their genealogies through those lines. Today, the multiracial descendants of the French and Spanish colonists, Africans, and other ethnicities are widely known as Louisiana Creoles. Louisiana&#x27;s Governor Bobby Jindal signed Act 276 on 14 June 2013, creating the license plate &quot;I&#x27;m Creole&quot;, honoring Louisiana Creoles&#x27; contributions and heritage.

Similarly, the Acadiana region is home to many African Americans, who have contributed greatly to the region over the centuries. Many primarily descend from those persons brought to the State of Louisiana in various waves during the colonial period to work the area&#x27;s sugarcane and rice plantations in the southern part of the state and the cotton plantations in the northern part of the state. Between 1723 and 1769, most slaves imported to Louisiana were from modern day Senegal, Mali and Congo, many thousands being imported to Louisiana from there. A large number of the imported slaves from the Senegambia region were members of the Wolof and Bambara ethnic groups. Saint-Louis and Goree Island were sites where a great number of slaves destined for Louisiana departed from Africa.

During the Spanish control of Louisiana, between 1770 and 1803, most of the slaves still came from the Congo and the Senegambia region, but others were imported from modern-day Benin. Many slaves imported during this period were members of the Nago people, a Yoruba subgroup. The slaves brought with them their cultural practices, languages, and religious beliefs rooted in spirit and ancestor worship, as well as Roman Catholic Christianity—all of which were key elements of Louisiana Voodoo. In addition, in the early nineteenth century, many Saint Dominicans also settled in Louisiana, both free people of color and slaves, following the Haitian Revolution on Saint-Domingue, contributing to the Voodoo tradition of the state. During the American period (1804–1820), almost half of the slaves came from the Congo. Before the American Civil War (1861–1865), African Americans comprised a significant portion of the state&#x27;s population, with most being employed on sugar cane and cotton plantations (see history of slavery in Louisiana and Louisiana African American Heritage Trail).

=== Religion ===

Religiously, Acadiana differs from much of the American South because a majority of its people are Christians of the Roman Catholic tradition in contrast to the surrounding regions (e.g., Central and Northern Louisiana), which are part of the largely Protestant Bible Belt. This is largely attributed to the region&#x27;s French, Spanish, and Caribbean influences. Among the Catholic population of Acadiana, the majority are served by the Roman Catholic Diocese of Lafayette in Louisiana, though some areas in western and eastern Acadiana belong to the Diocese of Lake Charles, and the Roman Catholic Diocese of Baton Rouge in the Florida Parishes.

==Transportation==
The traditional industries of the area, agriculture, petroleum, and tourism, initially drove the need for transportation development. In recent years, hurricane evacuation plans for the area&#x27;s growing towns and cities have hastened the planning and construction of better roadways. The abundance of swamps and marshes previously made Acadiana difficult to access, a major reason for the near isolation of the early Cajun people.

After oil was found in the area in the early 20th century, oil industry development was geared to improving access by roads and waterways. Damage has been done to the region by dredging and straightening of waterways, which has damaged the wetlands that used to absorb water and storms, leaving the area more vulnerable. Coastline continues to erode.

===Land===
High-capacity, modern highways are the lifelines of the region. U.S. highways 90, 190, and 167 were the main connectors through south Louisiana until the 1950s. Interstates 10, 210, 55, and 49 now play the major role in transportation. US and state highways also cross the region.

Rail transport through the area is limited by the difficult terrain and the sheer number of bridges required to build over numerous streams and bayous. A robust railroad system was being built at the time of the American Civil War, but much of it was destroyed during the conflict. By the end of the war, river transport via paddlewheeler had taken over as the preferred mode of travel. The major railways in operation through the region are the Burlington Northern Santa Fe Railroad and the Union Pacific Railroad.

===Water===
Waterways are vital to the commercial and recreational activities of the region. Seaports, rivers, lakes, bayous, canals, and spillways dot the landscape, and served as the primary source of shipping and travel through the early 1930s. The Mississippi River is important to the eastern section, the Atchafalaya River to the middle. Calcasieu River flowing through Lake Charles enables shipping traffic in the western portion, while the Sabine River forms the western border of both Acadiana and Louisiana. Fresh and saltwater lakes, along with almost the entire Louisiana portion of the Intracoastal Waterway, enable the flow of people and materials.

===Air===
Airports in Lafayette and Lake Charles provide scheduled airline service. Helicopter pilots serve the oilfields in the Gulf of Mexico. Small planes are used for short trips and agricultural needs. Small general aviation airports serve communities throughout the area.

<doc id="361179" wikidata="Q3257729" url="?curid=361179" title="Lochner v. New York">
<text>Lochner v. New York, 198 U.S. 45 (1905), was a landmark decision of the U.S. Supreme Court holding that a New York State statute that prescribed maximum working hours for bakers violated the bakers&#x27; right to freedom of contract under the Fourteenth Amendment to the U.S. Constitution. The decision has since been effectively overturned.

The underlying case began in 1899 when Joseph Lochner, a German immigrant who owned a bakery in Utica, New York, was charged with violating New York&#x27;s Bakeshop Act of 1895. The Bakeshop Act had made it a crime for New York bakeries to employ bakers for more than 10 hours per day or 60 hours per week. He was convicted and ultimately appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court. A five-justice majority of the Supreme Court held that the law violated the Due Process Clause, stating that the law constituted an &quot;unreasonable, unnecessary and arbitrary interference with the right and liberty of the individual to contract&quot;. Four dissenting justices rejected that view, and the dissent of Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr., in particular, became one of the most famous opinions in U.S. history.

&quot;Lochner&quot; is one of the most controversial decisions in the Supreme Court&#x27;s history and gave the name to what is known as the &quot;Lochner&quot; era. During that time, the Supreme Court issued several decisions invalidating federal and state statutes that sought to regulate working conditions during the Progressive Era and the Great Depression. The period ended with &quot;West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish&quot; (1937), in which the Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of minimum wage legislation enacted by Washington State.

==Background==
In 1895, the New York State Legislature passed a law called the &quot;Bakeshop Act&quot; that made it a crime for a bakery to employ a worker for more than 10 hours per day or more than 60 hours per week. In 1899, New York authorities indicted Joseph Lochner on a charge of violating the Bakeshop Act by permitting an employee to work more than 60 hours in one week. Lochner was a German immigrant who owned a bakery in Utica, New York. Unlike other bakeries, which used two separate shifts for evening and morning work, Lochner&#x27;s bakery employed only a single crew of bakers. His bakers would arrive in the evening and prepare the bread dough, sleep for several hours in an on-site dormitory, then wake up in the early morning and bake the loaves of bread. Lochner counted his bakers&#x27; time spent sleeping in the dormitory as working hours and paid them accordingly.

Lochner&#x27;s lawyer argued at his trial that the right to contract freely to be one of the rights encompassed by substantive due process. Lochner&#x27;s case was argued by Henry Weismann, who had been one of the foremost advocates of the Bakeshop Act when he was Secretary of the Journeymen Bakers&#x27; Union. In his brief, Weismann decried the idea that &quot;the treasured freedom of the individual... should be swept away under the guise of the police power of the State.&quot; He denied New York&#x27;s argument that the Bakeshop Act was a necessary health measure by claiming that the &quot;average bakery of the present day is well ventilated, comfortable both summer and winter, and always sweet smelling.&quot; Weismann&#x27;s brief contained an appendix providing statistics showing that bakers&#x27; mortality rates were comparable to that of white-collar professionals.

Weismann&#x27;s arguments were unsuccessful. The trial court found Lochner guilty and fined him $50 (). Lochner appealed to the New York Supreme Court, Appellate Division, which affirmed his conviction, then appealed to the New York Court of Appeals, which also affirmed it. He then appealed to the U.S. Supreme Court.

==Supreme Court decision==
On April 17, 1905, the Supreme Court issued a 5–4 decision in favor of Lochner that struck down the New York Bakeshop Act&#x27;s limits on bakers&#x27; working hours as unconstitutional.

===Opinion of the Court===
Five justices formed the majority and joined an opinion written by Justice Rufus Peckham.

The Court began with the question of whether the protections of the Fourteenth Amendment applied to freedom of contract. Citing its 1897 decision &quot;Allgeyer v. Louisiana&quot;, in which it had struck down a Louisiana law that banned buying shipping insurance from companies in other states on grounds that it violated the freedom to make contracts to carry out a trade or profession, the Court held that freedom of contract was a basic right covered by the protections for &quot;life, liberty, and property&quot; in the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Due Process Clause.

The Court explained that by &quot;circumstances which exclude the right&quot;, it meant when a state passed a law under the &quot;police power&quot;the inherent authority of U.S. state governments to pass laws governing &quot;health, safety, and morals&quot;. The Court said that because the Due Process Clause protected freedom of contract, state laws could only interfere with it if they were valid exercises of the police power. To guarantee this freedom, the Court said that American courts had to scrutinize state laws regulating economic freedom, such as New York&#x27;s bakery law, to ensure they served valid police-power purposes.

Applying these legal principles to the facts of the case, the Court first determined that the job of a baker was not dangerous enough to need special government protection. The Court distinguished New York&#x27;s law for bakers from a Utah law for miners the Court had upheld against a Due Process challenge in its 1898 decision &quot;Holden v. Hardy&quot;, saying that, unlike mining, baking was not an unusually dangerous activity. The Court also determined that the Bakeshop Act had no relation to public health. Reasoning that the New York Legislature could not rationally have enacted the law for health reasons, the Court concluded that the Act was really a &quot;labor law&quot; that could not be justified under the police power.

The Court concluded that New York had failed to prove that the Bakeshop Act&#x27;s maximum-hours provision had any close connection to public health. It said that if it were to conclude otherwise, states would have unlimited power over citizens&#x27; lives.

Lastly, the Court said that state laws ostensibly enacted for police-power purposes were often really intended to redistribute wealth or help a certain group at the expense of others.

Having determined that Bakeshop Act had no relation to public health and that the baking profession was not unusually dangerous, the Court concluded that &quot;the limit of the police power has been reached and passed in this case&quot;, and it struck down the act as a violation of the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Due Process Clause.

===Dissents===
====Harlan====

Justice John Marshall Harlan wrote a dissenting opinion that was joined by Justices Edward Douglass White and William R. Day.

Harlan contended that the liberty to contract is subject to regulation imposed by a state acting within the scope of its police powers. He offered the following rule for determining whether such statutes are unconstitutional:

Harlan asserted that the burden of proof should rest with the party seeking to have such a statute deemed unconstitutional.

Harlan argued that the Court gave insufficient weight to the state&#x27;s argument that the law was a valid health measure addressing a legitimate state interest. He contended that it was &quot;plain that this statute was enacted to protect the physical well-being of those who work in bakery and confectionery establishments.&quot; Responding to the majority&#x27;s assertion that the profession of a baker was not an unhealthy one, he quoted at length from academic studies describing the respiratory ailments and other risks that bakers faced. He argued that the Supreme Court should have deferred to the New York Legislature&#x27;s judgment that long working hours threatened the health of bakery employees: &quot;If the end which the legislature seeks to accomplish be one to which its power extends, and if the means employed to that end, although not the wisest or best, are yet not plainly and palpably unauthorized by law, then the court cannot interfere.&quot;

====Holmes====

Justice Oliver Wendell Holmes Jr. also dissented from the Court&#x27;s opinion and wrote a three-paragraph dissent that has become one of the most famous in U.S. Supreme Court history. Holmes began by accusing the majority of deciding Lochner&#x27;s case by following &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics rather than legal principles.
Holmes pointed out that there were many American laws restricting citizens&#x27; freedom of contract that had never been found unconstitutional. As &quot;ancient examples&quot;, Holmes pointed to usury laws, which set caps on interest rates for loans of money, and Sunday laws, which outlawed certain economic activities on Sundays in order to promote Christian observance of the Sabbath. Holmes analogized the majority&#x27;s interpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment to the writings of Herbert Spencer, the 19th-century British sociologist who coined the term &quot;survival of the fittest&quot; and whose ideas later became associated with social Darwinism.

Holmes wrote that, in his view, a duly enacted state law could only be unconstitutional under the Due Process Clause&#x27;s guarantee of liberty if it could rationally be said to &quot;infringe fundamental principles&quot; in the American tradition, and he maintained that the Bakeshop Act clearly did not do so.
==Significance and legacy==

The Supreme Court&#x27;s due process jurisprudence over the next three decades was inconsistent, but it took a narrow view of states&#x27; police powers in several major labor cases after &quot;Lochner&quot;. For example, in &quot;Coppage v. Kansas&quot; (1915), the Court struck down statutes forbidding &quot;yellow-dog contracts.&quot; Similarly, in &quot;Adkins v. Children&#x27;s Hospital&quot; (1923), the Supreme Court held that minimum wage laws violated the due process clause, but Chief Justice William Howard Taft strongly dissented and suggested that the Court instead should have overruled &quot;Lochner&quot;. The doctrine of substantive due process was coupled with a narrow interpretation of congressional power under the commerce clause. Justices James McReynolds, George Sutherland, Willis Van Devanter, and Pierce Butler emerged during the 1920s and the 1930s as the foremost defenders of traditional limitations on government power on the Supreme Court and so were collectively dubbed by supporters of the New Deal the &quot;Four Horsemen of Reaction.&quot; All four of them believed in &quot;laissez-faire&quot; economics.

In 1934, the Supreme Court decided in &quot;Nebbia v. New York&quot; that there is no constitutional fundamental right to freedom of contract. In 1937, the Supreme Court decided &quot;West Coast Hotel Co. v. Parrish&quot;, which expressly overruled &quot;Adkins&quot; and implicitly signaled the end of the &quot;Lochner&quot; era by repudiating the idea that freedom of contract should be unrestricted.

Although the Supreme Court did not explicitly overrule &quot;Lochner&quot;, it agreed to give more deference to the decisions of state legislatures. The Supreme Court sounded the death knell for economic substantive due process several years later in &quot;Williamson v. Lee Optical of Oklahoma&quot; (1955) by unanimously declaring, &quot;The day is gone when this Court uses the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment to strike down state laws, regulatory of business and industrial conditions, because they may be unwise, improvident, or out of harmony with a particular school of thought.&quot;

===Modern substantive due process===
Since the end of the &quot;Lochner&quot; era, the Supreme Court has applied a lower standard of review to confront restrictions on economic liberty. A higher standard is used in reviewing legislation infringing on personal liberties. A line of cases dating back to the 1923 opinion by Justice McReynolds in &quot;Meyer v. Nebraska&quot;, which cited &quot;Lochner&quot; as establishing limits on the police power, has established a privacy right under substantive due process. More recently, in &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; (1973), the Supreme Court held that women have a privacy right to determine whether or not to have an abortion. In &quot;Planned Parenthood v. Casey&quot; (1992), the Supreme Court reaffirmed that right but no longer used the term &quot;privacy&quot; to describe it. The abortion right was later overruled in &quot;Dobbs v. Jackson Women&#x27;s Health Organization&quot; (2022).

===Scholarly reaction===
The Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in &quot;Lochner v. New York&quot; has been criticized by legal scholars. The law professor Bernard Siegan described it as &quot;one of the most condemned cases in United States history.&quot; According to the Center for American Progress, a left-leaning thinktank, law professors often use &quot;Lochner&quot;, along with &quot;Plessy v. Ferguson&quot; and &quot;Korematsu v. United States&quot;, as examples of &quot;how judges should not behave.&quot;

&quot;Lochner&quot; is sometimes used as shorthand for extreme right-wing constitutional theory. However, it has come under harsh criticism from conservative and libertarian jurists as well because &quot;Lochner&quot; embraced substantive due process, a doctrine that was arguably at odds with the original understanding of the Constitution. For example, the conservative legal scholar Robert Bork called the decision an &quot;abomination&quot; and the &quot;quintessence of judicial usurpation of power.&quot; Similarly, former Attorney General Edwin Meese said that the Supreme Court &quot;ignored the limitations of the Constitution and blatantly usurped legislative authority.&quot; Siegan, a self-described libertarian, described it as &quot;a symbol of judicial dereliction and abuse.&quot;

Scholars have noted that when the Fourteenth Amendment was adopted in 1868, 27 of the 37 state constitutions had adopted references to Locke&#x27;s labor theory of property, which typically said: &quot;All men are by nature free and independent, and have certain inalienable rights, among which are those of enjoying and defending life and liberty, acquiring and possessing and protecting property: and pursuing and obtaining safety and happiness.&quot; As such clauses were &quot;deeply rooted in American history and tradition,&quot; they likely informed the original meaning of the scope and nature of the fundamental rights protected by the Fourteenth Amendment in the eyes of &quot;Lochner&quot;-era justices.

However, the decision also has attracted libertarian defenders: the Cato Institute and the scholars Richard Epstein and Randy Barnett, who argue that it correctly protected economic liberty.

Barnett has argued that the decision was basically correct in its presumption in favor of liberty of contract and that the decision was wrong only by perpetuating the misinterpretation of the Fourteenth Amendment that had been established in the Slaughter-House Cases. According to Barnett, the liberty of contract is properly found in the Privileges or Immunities Clause, not in the Due Process Clause of the Fourteenth Amendment. David Bernstein, in &quot;Rehabilitating Lochner: Defending Individual Rights Against Progressive Reform&quot;, has argued that &quot;Lochner&quot; was well grounded in Supreme Court precedent and that its emphasis on limits to the states&#x27; police powers informed the Supreme Court&#x27;s early civil liberties and civil rights cases.

<text>John Gutzon de la Mothe Borglum (March 25, 1867 – March 6, 1941) was an American sculptor best known for his work on Mount Rushmore. He is also associated with various other public works of art across the U.S., including Stone Mountain in Georgia, statues of Union General Philip Sheridan in Washington D.C. and in Chicago, as well as a bust of Abraham Lincoln exhibited in the White House by Theodore Roosevelt and now held in the United States Capitol crypt in Washington, D.C.

== Early life ==
The son of Danish immigrants, John Gutzon de la Mothe Borglum was born in 1867 in St. Charles, in what was then thought to be in Utah but was later determined to be in Idaho Territory. Borglum was a child of Mormon polygamy. His father, Jens Møller Haugaard Børglum (1839–1909), came from the village of Børglum in northwestern Denmark. He had two wives when he lived in Idaho: Gutzon&#x27;s mother, Christina Mikkelsen Børglum (1847–1871), and her sister Ida, who was Jens&#x27;s first wife. Jens Borglum decided to leave the LDS church and moved to Omaha, Nebraska where polygamy was both illegal and taboo. Jens Borglum had worked mainly as a woodcarver before his decision to attend the Saint Louis Homeopathic Medical College in St. Louis, Missouri. At this point &quot;Jens and Christina divorced, the family left the LDS church, and Jens, Ida, their children, and Christina&#x27;s two sons, Gutzon and Solon, moved to St. Louis, where Jens earned a medical degree.&quot; Upon his graduation from the Missouri Medical College in 1874, Dr. Borglum moved the family to Fremont, Nebraska, where he established a medical practice. Gutzon Borglum remained in Fremont until 1882, when his father enrolled him in St. Mary&#x27;s College, Kansas.

After a brief stint at Saint Mary&#x27;s College, Gutzon Borglum moved to Omaha, Nebraska, where he apprenticed in a machine shop and graduated from Creighton Preparatory School.

== New York City ==
In New York City, he sculpted saints and apostles for the new Cathedral of St. John the Divine in 1901; in 1906 he had a group sculpture accepted by the Metropolitan Museum of Art— the first sculpture by a living American the museum had ever purchased—and made his presence further felt with some portraits. He also won the Logan Medal of the Arts. His reputation soon surpassed that of his younger brother Solon Borglum, already an established sculptor.

== Family ==
In 1889, Borglum married his painting instructor, Elizabeth Jaynes Putnam, who was 18 years his senior. After divorcing his first wife, Borglum married Mary Montgomery Williams, on May 20, 1909, with whom he had three children, including a son, Lincoln, and a daughter, Mary Ellis (Mel) Borglum Vhay.

== Public life ==
Borglum was active in the committee that organized the New York Armory Show of 1913, the birthplace of modernism in American art. By the time the show was ready to open, however, Borglum had resigned from the committee, feeling that the emphasis on avant-garde works had co-opted the original premise of the show and made traditional artists like himself look provincial. He moved into an estate in Stamford, Connecticut in 1914 and lived there for 10 years. He sheltered Czechoslovak Legion members on his land at Stamford in 1917.

Borglum was an active member of the Ancient Free and Accepted Masons (the Freemasons), raised in Howard Lodge #35, New York City, on June 10, 1904, and serving as its Worshipful Master 1910–11. In 1915, he was appointed Grand Representative of the Grand Lodge of Denmark near the Grand Lodge of New York. He received his Scottish Rite Degrees in the New York City Consistory on October 25, 1907. He was friends with Theodore Roosevelt for many years and during the 1912 United States presidential election Borglum was a very active campaign organizer and member of the Bull Moose Party.

While it has been claimed that Borglum was a member of the Ku Klux Klan, an article in the &quot;Smithsonian Magazine&quot; denies that there is proof that he officially joined the KKK. That said, he became &quot;deeply involved in Klan politics&quot;, attending Klan rallies and serving on Klan committees. In 1925, having only completed the head of Robert E. Lee, Borglum was dismissed from the Stone Mountain project, with some holding that it came about due to infighting within the KKK, with Borglum involved in the strife. Later, he stated &quot;I am not a member of the Kloncilium, nor a knight of the KKK,&quot; but Howard Shaff and Audrey Karl Shaff claim that &quot;that was for public consumption.&quot; The museum at Mount Rushmore displays a letter to Borglum from D. C. Stephenson, the infamous Klan Grand Dragon who later was convicted of the rape and murder of Madge Oberholtzer. The 8x10 foot portrait contains the inscription &quot;To my good friend Gutzon Borglum, with the greatest respect.&quot; Correspondence from Borglum to Stephenson during the 1920s detailed a deep racist conviction in Nordic moral superiority and strict immigration policies.

== Monuments ==
A fascination with gigantic scale and themes of heroic nationalism suited his extroverted personality. His head of Abraham Lincoln, carved from a six-ton block of marble, was exhibited in Theodore Roosevelt&#x27;s White House and can be found in the United States Capitol Crypt in Washington, D.C. A &quot;patriot,&quot; believing that the &quot;monuments we have built are not our own,&quot; he looked to create art that was &quot;American, drawn from American sources, memorializing American achievement,&quot; according to a 1908 interview. Borglum was highly suited to the competitive environment surrounding the contracts for public buildings and monuments, and his public sculptures are found all around the United States.

In 1908, Borglum won a competition for an equestrian statue of the Civil War General Philip Sheridan to be placed in Sheridan Circle in Washington, D.C. A second version of &quot;General Philip Sheridan&quot; was erected in Chicago, Illinois, in 1923. Winning this competition was a personal triumph for him because he won out over sculptor J.Q.A. Ward, a much older and more established artist and one whom Borglum had clashed with earlier in regard to the National Sculpture Society. At the unveiling of the Sheridan statue, one observer, President Theodore Roosevelt (whom Borglum was later to include in the Mount Rushmore portrait group), declared that it was &quot;first rate&quot;; a critic wrote that &quot;as a sculptor Gutzon Borglum was no longer a rumor, he was a fact.&quot; (Smith:see References)

President Franklin D. Roosevelt delivered an address on May 3, 1934, dedicating a statue of William Jennings Bryan created by Borglum. This Bryan statue by Borglum originally stood in Washington, D.C. but was later displaced by highway construction and moved by an Act of Congress in 1961 to Salem, Illinois, Bryan&#x27;s birthplace.

In 1925, the sculptor moved to Texas to work on the monument to trail drivers commissioned by the Trail Drivers Association. He completed the model in 1925, but due to lack of funds it was not cast until 1940, and then was only a fourth its originally planned size. It stands in front of the Texas Pioneer and Trail Drivers Memorial Hall next to the Witte Museum in San Antonio. Borglum lived at the historic Menger Hotel, which in the 1920s was the residence of a number of artists. He subsequently planned the redevelopment of the Corpus Christi waterfront; the plan failed, although a model for a statue of Christ intended for it was later modified by his son and erected on a mountaintop in South Dakota. While living and working in Texas, Borglum took an interest in local beautification. He promoted change and modernity, although he was berated by academicians.

=== Stone Mountain ===

Borglum was initially involved in the carving of Stone Mountain in Georgia. Borglum&#x27;s nativist stances made him seem an ideologically sympathetic choice to carve a memorial to heroes of the Confederate States of America, planned for Stone Mountain, Georgia. In 1915, coinciding with the Klan-glorifying, highly successful &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot;, he was approached by the United Daughters of the Confederacy with a project for sculpting a high bust of General Robert E. Lee on the mountain&#x27;s rockface. Borglum accepted, but told the committee, &quot;Ladies, a twenty-foot head of Lee on that mountainside would look like a postage stamp on a barn door.&quot;

Borglum&#x27;s ideas eventually evolved into a high relief frieze of Lee, Jefferson Davis, and Stonewall Jackson riding around the mountain, followed by a legion of artillery troops. Borglum agreed to include a Ku Klux Klan altar in his plans for the memorial to acknowledge a request of Helen Plane in 1915, who wrote to him: &quot;I feel it is due to the KKK that saved us from Negro domination and carpetbag rule, that it be immortalized on Stone Mountain&quot;.

After a delay caused by World War I, Borglum and the newly chartered Stone Mountain Confederate Monumental Association set to work on this monument, the largest ever attempted. Many difficulties slowed progress, some because of the sheer scale involved. After finishing the detailed model of the carving, Borglum was unable to trace the figures onto the massive area on which he was working, until he developed a gigantic magic lantern to project the image onto the side of the mountain.

Carving officially began on June 23, 1923, with Borglum making the first cut. At Stone Mountain he developed sympathetic connections with the reorganized Ku Klux Klan, who were major financial backers of the monument. Lee&#x27;s head was unveiled on Lee&#x27;s birthday January 19, 1924, to a large crowd, but soon thereafter Borglum was increasingly at odds with the officials of the organization. His domineering, perfectionist, authoritarian manner brought tensions to such a point that in March 1925 Borglum smashed his clay and plaster models. He left Georgia permanently, his tenure with the organization over. None of his work remains, as it was all blasted off the mountain&#x27;s face for the work of Borglum&#x27;s replacement Henry Augustus Lukeman. In his abortive attempt, however, Borglum had developed the necessary techniques for sculpting on a gigantic scale that made Mount Rushmore possible.

=== Mount Rushmore ===
His Mount Rushmore project, 1927–1941, was the brainchild of South Dakota state historian Doane Robinson. His first attempt with the face of Thomas Jefferson had to be redone when it was determined that there was not enough stone to complete it. Dynamite was used to remove large areas of rock from under Washington&#x27;s brow. The initial pair of presidents, George Washington and Thomas Jefferson, was soon joined by Abraham Lincoln and Theodore Roosevelt.

Ivan Houser, father of John Sherrill Houser, was assistant sculptor to Gutzon Borglum in the early years of carving; he began working with Borglum shortly after the inception of the monument and was with Borglum for a total of seven years. When Houser left Gutzon to devote his talents to his own work, Gutzon&#x27;s son, Lincoln, took over as Assistant-Sculptor to his father.

Borglum alternated exhausting on-site supervising with world tours, raising money, polishing his personal legend, sculpting a Thomas Paine memorial for Paris and a Woodrow Wilson memorial for Poznań, Poland (1931). In his absence, work at Mount Rushmore was overseen by Bill Tallman and later his son, Lincoln Borglum. During the Rushmore project, father and son were residents of Beeville, Texas. When he died in Chicago, following complications of surgery, his son finished another season at Rushmore, but left the monument largely in the state of completion it had reached under his father&#x27;s direction.

=== Other works ===

In 1909, the sculpture &quot;Rabboni&quot; was created as a grave site for the Ffoulke Family in Washington, D.C. at Rock Creek Cemetery.

Four public works by Borglum are in Newark, New Jersey: &quot;Seated Lincoln&quot; (1911), &quot;Indian and the Puritan&quot; (1916), &quot;Wars of America&quot; (1926), and a stele with bas-relief, &quot;First Landing Party of the Founders of Newark&quot; (1916). No other U.S. city holds as many public displays by Borglum.

In 1912, the &quot;Nathaniel Wheeler Memorial Fountain&quot; was dedicated in Bridgeport, Connecticut.

Memorial to Robert Louis Stevenson at Baker Cottage, Saranac Lake, New York. Unveiled in 1915.

In 1916, he overhauled the design of the torch for the Statue of Liberty in New York City.

In 1918, he was one of the drafters of the Czechoslovak declaration of independence.

One of Borglum&#x27;s more unusual pieces is the &quot;Aviator&quot; completed in 1919 as a memorial for James Rogers McConnell, who was killed in World War I while flying for the Lafayette Escadrille. It is located on the grounds of the University of Virginia in Charlottesville, Virginia.

In 1922, he crafted the William Dempster Hoard Sculpture in the north end what is now the Henry Mall Historic District at the University of Wisconsin-Madison.

His statue of Collis P. Huntington was completed in 1924 and stands at the entrance of the CSX Huntington headquarters building located in the 900 block of Seventh Avenue Huntington, West Virginia.

His statue of Harvey W. Scott was completed in 1933 and stood at the peak of Mount Tabor, Portland, Oregon until it was toppled by protestors in 2020.

Borglum sculpted the &quot;Memorial to the &quot;Start Westward of the United States&quot;&quot;, which is located in Muskingum Park, Marietta, Ohio (1938). The work was featured on a 1938 3¢ US postage stamp.

He built the statue of Daniel Butterfield at Sakura Park in Manhattan (1918).

He created a memorial to Sacco and Vanzetti (1928), a plaster cast of which is now in the Boston Public Library.

Another Borglum design is the North Carolina Monument on Seminary Ridge at the Gettysburg Battlefield in south-central Pennsylvania. The cast bronze sculpture depicts a wounded Confederate officer encouraging his men to push forward during Pickett&#x27;s Charge. Borglum had also made arrangements for an airplane to fly over the monument during the dedication ceremony on July 3, 1929. During the sculpture&#x27;s unveiling, the plane scattered roses across the field as a salute to those North Carolinians who had fought and died at Gettysburg.

In 1939 when German troops marched into Poland, they destroyed Borglum&#x27;s statue of Woodrow Wilson located in Poznań.

== Death ==
Borglum died in 1941 of a heart attack and is interred at Forest Lawn Memorial Park in Glendale, California.

<doc id="361184" wikidata="Q109744257" url="?curid=361184" title="Generalized hypergeometric function">
<text>In mathematics, a generalized hypergeometric series is a power series in which the ratio of successive coefficients indexed by &quot;n&quot; is a rational function of &quot;n&quot;. The series, if convergent, defines a generalized hypergeometric function, which may then be defined over a wider domain of the argument by analytic continuation. The generalized hypergeometric series is sometimes just called the hypergeometric series, though this term also sometimes just refers to the Gaussian hypergeometric series. Generalized hypergeometric functions include the (Gaussian) hypergeometric function and the confluent hypergeometric function as special cases, which in turn have many particular special functions as special cases, such as elementary functions, Bessel functions, and the classical orthogonal polynomials.

==Notation==
A hypergeometric series is formally defined as a power series 
:formula_1
in which the ratio of successive coefficients is a rational function of &quot;n&quot;. That is,
:formula_2
where &quot;A&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) and &quot;B&quot;(&quot;n&quot;) are polynomials in &quot;n&quot;.

For example, in the case of the series for the exponential function,
:formula_3
we have:
:formula_4
So this satisfies the definition with and .

It is customary to factor out the leading term, so β0 is assumed to be 1. The polynomials can be factored into linear factors of the form (&quot;aj&quot; + &quot;n&quot;) and (&quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; + &quot;n&quot;) respectively, where the &quot;a&quot;&quot;j&quot; and &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; are complex numbers.

For historical reasons, it is assumed that (1 + &quot;n&quot;) is a factor of &quot;B&quot;. If this is not already the case then both &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot; can be multiplied by this factor; the factor cancels so the terms are unchanged and there is no loss of generality.

The ratio between consecutive coefficients now has the form 
:formula_5,
where &quot;c&quot; and &quot;d&quot; are the leading coefficients of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;. The series then has the form
:formula_6,
or, by scaling &quot;z&quot; by the appropriate factor and rearranging,
:formula_7.

This has the form of an exponential generating function. This series is usually denoted by
:formula_8

or

:formula_9

Using the rising factorial or Pochhammer symbol

:formula_10

this can be written

:formula_11

(Note that this use of the Pochhammer symbol is not standard; however it is the standard usage in this context.)

==Terminology==
When all the terms of the series are defined and it has a non-zero radius of convergence, then the series defines an analytic function. Such a function, and its analytic continuations, is called the hypergeometric function.

The case when the radius of convergence is 0 yields many interesting series in mathematics, for example the incomplete gamma function has the asymptotic expansion
:formula_12
which could be written &quot;z&quot;&quot;a&quot;−1&quot;e&quot;−z 2&quot;F&quot;0(1−&quot;a&quot;,1;;−&quot;z&quot;−1). However, the use of the term &quot;hypergeometric series&quot; is usually restricted to the case where the series defines an actual analytic function.

The ordinary hypergeometric series should not be confused with the basic hypergeometric series, which, despite its name, is a rather more complicated and recondite series. The &quot;basic&quot; series is the q-analog of the ordinary hypergeometric series. There are several such generalizations of the ordinary hypergeometric series, including the ones coming from zonal spherical functions on Riemannian symmetric spaces.

The series without the factor of &quot;n&quot;! in the denominator (summed over all integers &quot;n&quot;, including negative) is called the bilateral hypergeometric series.

==Convergence conditions==
There are certain values of the &quot;a&quot;&quot;j&quot; and &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; for which the numerator or the denominator of the coefficients is 0.
* If any &quot;a&quot;&quot;j&quot; is a non-positive integer (0, −1, −2, etc.) then the series only has a finite number of terms and is, in fact, a polynomial of degree −&quot;a&quot;&quot;j&quot;.
* If any &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; is a non-positive integer (excepting the previous case with &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; &lt; &quot;a&quot;&quot;j&quot;) then the denominators become 0 and the series is undefined.

Excluding these cases, the ratio test can be applied to determine the radius of convergence.
* If &quot;p&quot; &lt; &quot;q&quot; + 1 then the ratio of coefficients tends to zero. This implies that the series converges for any finite value of &quot;z&quot; and thus defines an entire function of &quot;z&quot;. An example is the power series for the exponential function.
* If &quot;p&quot; = &quot;q&quot; + 1 then the ratio of coefficients tends to one. This implies that the series converges for |&quot;z&quot;| &lt; 1 and diverges for |&quot;z&quot;| &gt; 1. Whether it converges for |&quot;z&quot;| = 1 is more difficult to determine. Analytic continuation can be employed for larger values of &quot;z&quot;.
* If &quot;p&quot; &gt; &quot;q&quot; + 1 then the ratio of coefficients grows without bound. This implies that, besides &quot;z&quot; = 0, the series diverges. This is then a divergent or asymptotic series, or it can be interpreted as a symbolic shorthand for a differential equation that the sum satisfies formally.

The question of convergence for &quot;p&quot;=&quot;q&quot;+1 when &quot;z&quot; is on the unit circle is more difficult. It can be shown that the series converges absolutely at &quot;z&quot; = 1 if 
:formula_13.
Further, if &quot;p&quot;=&quot;q&quot;+1, formula_14 and &quot;z&quot; is real, then the following convergence result holds :
:formula_15.

==Basic properties==
It is immediate from the definition that the order of the parameters &quot;aj&quot;, or the order of the parameters &quot;bk&quot; can be changed without changing the value of the function. Also, if any of the parameters &quot;aj&quot; is equal to any of the parameters &quot;bk&quot;, then the matching parameters can be &quot;cancelled out&quot;, with certain exceptions when the parameters are non-positive integers. For example,
:formula_16.
This cancelling is a special case of a reduction formula that may be applied whenever a parameter on the top row differs from one on the bottom row by a non-negative integer.
:formula_17

===Euler&#x27;s integral transform===
The following basic identity is very useful as it relates the higher-order hypergeometric functions in terms of integrals over the lower order ones

:formula_18

===Differentiation===
The generalized hypergeometric function satisfies
:formula_19

and 

formula_20

Additionally,

formula_21

Combining these gives a differential equation satisfied by &quot;w&quot; = &quot;p&quot;&quot;F&quot;&quot;q&quot;:
:formula_22.

==Contiguous function and related identities==
Take the following operator:
:formula_23 
From the differentiation formulas given above, the linear space spanned by 
:formula_24 
contains each of 
:formula_25 
:formula_26
:formula_27
:formula_28
Since the space has dimension 2, any three of these &quot;p&quot;+&quot;q&quot;+2 functions are linearly dependent:
:formula_29

:formula_30

:formula_31

:formula_32
These dependencies can be written out to generate a large number of identities involving formula_33.

For example, in the simplest non-trivial case,
:formula_34,
:formula_35,
:formula_36,
So 
:formula_37.

This, and other important examples,

:formula_38,
:formula_39,
:formula_40
:formula_41,
:formula_42,
:formula_43,

can be used to generate continued fraction expressions known as Gauss&#x27;s continued fraction.

Similarly, by applying the differentiation formulas twice, there are formula_44 such functions contained in 
:formula_45 
which has dimension three so any four are linearly dependent. This generates more identities and the process can be continued. The identities thus generated can be combined with each other to produce new ones in a different way.

A function obtained by adding ±1 to exactly one of the parameters &quot;a&quot;&quot;j&quot;, &quot;b&quot;&quot;k&quot; in 
:formula_46 
is called contiguous to 
:formula_28
Using the technique outlined above, an identity relating formula_48 and its two contiguous functions can be given, six identities relating formula_49 and any two of its four contiguous functions, and fifteen identities relating formula_50 and any two of its six contiguous functions have been found. (The first one was derived in the previous paragraph. The last fifteen were given by Gauss in his 1812 paper.)

==Identities==

A number of other hypergeometric function identities were discovered in the nineteenth and twentieth centuries. A 20th century contribution to the methodology of proving these identities is the Egorychev method.

===Saalschütz&#x27;s theorem===
Saalschütz&#x27;s theorem is
:formula_51
For extension of this theorem, see a research paper by Rakha &amp; Rathie.

===Dixon&#x27;s identity===
Dixon&#x27;s identity, first proved by , gives the sum of a well-poised 3&quot;F&quot;2 at 1:
:formula_52
For generalization of Dixon&#x27;s identity, see a paper by Lavoie, et al.

===Dougall&#x27;s formula===
Dougall&#x27;s formula gives the sum of a very well-poised series that is terminating and 2-balanced.
:formula_53

Terminating means that &quot;m&quot; is a non-negative integer and 2-balanced means that
:formula_54
Many of the other formulas for special values of hypergeometric functions can be derived from this as special or limiting cases.

===Generalization of Kummer&#x27;s transformations and identities for 2&quot;F&quot;2===
Identity 1.
:formula_55
where 
:formula_56;

Identity 2.
:formula_57
which links Bessel functions to 2&quot;F&quot;2; this reduces to Kummer&#x27;s second formula for &quot;b&quot; = 2&quot;a&quot;:

Identity 3.
:formula_58.

Identity 4.
:formula_59
which is a finite sum if &quot;b-d&quot; is a non-negative integer.

===Kummer&#x27;s relation===
Kummer&#x27;s relation is
:formula_60

===Clausen&#x27;s formula===

Clausen&#x27;s formula
:formula_61
was used by de Branges to prove the Bieberbach conjecture.

==Special cases==
Many of the special functions in mathematics are special cases of the confluent hypergeometric function or the hypergeometric function; see the corresponding articles for examples.

===The series 0&quot;F&quot;0===

As noted earlier, formula_62. The differential equation for this function is formula_63, which has solutions formula_64 where &quot;k&quot; is a constant.

===The series 0&quot;F&quot;1===
The functions of the form formula_48 are called confluent hypergeometric limit functions and are closely related to Bessel functions. 

The relationship is: 
:formula_66 
:formula_67 
The differential equation for this function is 
:formula_68 
or 
:formula_69 
When &quot;a&quot; is not a positive integer, the substitution 
:formula_70 
gives a linearly independent solution 
:formula_71 
so the general solution is 
:formula_72 
where &quot;k&quot;, &quot;l&quot; are constants. (If &quot;a&quot; is a positive integer, the independent solution is given by the appropriate Bessel function of the second kind.)

A special case is:
:formula_73

===The series 1&quot;F&quot;0===

An important case is: 
:formula_74 
The differential equation for this function is 
:formula_75 
or 
:formula_76 
which has solutions 
:formula_77 
where &quot;k&quot; is a constant.

:formula_78 is the geometric series with ratio &quot;z&quot; and coefficient 1.

:formula_79 is also useful.

===The series 1&quot;F&quot;1===

The functions of the form formula_49 are called confluent hypergeometric functions of the first kind, also written formula_81. The incomplete gamma function formula_82 is a special case.

The differential equation for this function is

:formula_83

or

:formula_84

When &quot;b&quot; is not a positive integer, the substitution

:formula_85

gives a linearly independent solution

:formula_86

so the general solution is

:formula_87

where &quot;k&quot;, &quot;l&quot; are constants.

When a is a non-positive integer, −&quot;n&quot;, formula_88 is a polynomial. Up to constant factors, these are the Laguerre polynomials. This implies Hermite polynomials can be expressed in terms of 1&quot;F&quot;1 as well.

===The series 1&quot;F&quot;2===

Relations to other functions are known for certain parameter combinations only.

The function formula_89 is the antiderivative of the cardinal sine. With modified values of formula_90 and formula_91, one obtains the antiderivative of formula_92.

The Lommel function is formula_93.

===The series 2&quot;F&quot;0===
The confluent hypergeometric function of the second kind can be written as:
:formula_94

===The series 2&quot;F&quot;1===

Historically, the most important are the functions of the form formula_50. These are sometimes called Gauss&#x27;s hypergeometric functions, classical standard hypergeometric or often simply hypergeometric functions. The term Generalized hypergeometric function is used for the functions &quot;p&quot;&quot;F&quot;&quot;q&quot; if there is risk of confusion. This function was first studied in detail by Carl Friedrich Gauss, who explored the conditions for its convergence.

The differential equation for this function is

:formula_96

or

:formula_97

It is known as the hypergeometric differential equation. When &quot;c&quot; is not a positive integer, the substitution

:formula_98

gives a linearly independent solution

:formula_99

so the general solution for |&quot;z&quot;| &lt; 1 is

:formula_100

where &quot;k&quot;, &quot;l&quot; are constants. Different solutions can be derived for other values of &quot;z&quot;. In fact there are 24 solutions, known as the Kummer solutions, derivable using various identities, valid in different regions of the complex plane.

When &quot;a&quot; is a non-positive integer, −&quot;n&quot;,
:formula_101

is a polynomial. Up to constant factors and scaling, these are the Jacobi polynomials. Several other classes of orthogonal polynomials, up to constant factors, are special cases of Jacobi polynomials, so these can be expressed using 2&quot;F&quot;1 as well. This includes Legendre polynomials and Chebyshev polynomials.

A wide range of integrals of elementary functions can be expressed using the hypergeometric function, e.g.:

:formula_102

===The series 3&quot;F&quot;0===
The Mott polynomials can be written as:
:formula_103

===The series 3&quot;F&quot;2===

The function
::formula_104
is the dilogarithm

The function
::formula_105
is a Hahn polynomial.

===The series 4&quot;F&quot;3===

The function
::formula_106
is a Wilson polynomial.

All roots of a quintic equation can be expressed in terms of radicals and the Bring radical, which is the real solution to formula_107. The Bring radical can be written as:
::formula_108

===The series q+1&quot;F&quot;q===

The functions
::formula_109
::formula_110
for formula_111 and formula_112 are the Polylogarithm.

For each integer &quot;n&quot;≥2, the roots of the polynomial &quot;x&quot;&quot;n&quot;−&quot;x&quot;+t can be expressed as a sum of at most &quot;N&quot;−1 hypergeometric functions of type &quot;n&quot;+1F&quot;n&quot;, which can always be reduced by eliminating at least one pair of &quot;a&quot; and &quot;b&quot; parameters.

==Generalizations==
The generalized hypergeometric function is linked to the Meijer G-function and the MacRobert E-function. Hypergeometric series were generalised to several variables, for example by Paul Emile Appell and Joseph Kampé de Fériet; but a comparable general theory took long to emerge. Many identities were found, some quite remarkable. A generalization, the q-series analogues, called the basic hypergeometric series, were given by Eduard Heine in the late nineteenth century. Here, the ratios considered of successive terms, instead of a rational function of &quot;n&quot;, are a rational function of &quot;qn&quot;. Another generalization, the elliptic hypergeometric series, are those series where the ratio of terms is an elliptic function (a doubly periodic meromorphic function) of &quot;n&quot;.

During the twentieth century this was a fruitful area of combinatorial mathematics, with numerous connections to other fields. There are a number of new definitions of general hypergeometric functions, by Aomoto, Israel Gelfand and others; and applications for example to the combinatorics of arranging a number of hyperplanes in complex &quot;N&quot;-space (see arrangement of hyperplanes).

Special hypergeometric functions occur as zonal spherical functions on Riemannian symmetric spaces and semi-simple Lie groups. Their importance and role can be understood through the following example: the hypergeometric series 2&quot;F&quot;1 has the Legendre polynomials as a special case, and when considered in the form of spherical harmonics, these polynomials reflect, in a certain sense, the symmetry properties of the two-sphere or, equivalently, the rotations given by the Lie group SO(3). In tensor product decompositions of concrete representations of this group Clebsch–Gordan coefficients are met, which can be written as 3&quot;F&quot;2 hypergeometric series.

Bilateral hypergeometric series are a generalization of hypergeometric functions where one sums over all integers, not just the positive ones.

Fox–Wright functions are a generalization of generalized hypergeometric functions where the Pochhammer symbols in the series expression are generalised to gamma functions of linear expressions in the index &quot;n&quot;.

<text>The streltsy (, ; , ) were the units of Russian firearm infantry from the 16th century to the early 18th century and also a social stratum, from which personnel for streltsy troops were traditionally recruited. They are also collectively known as &quot;streletskoye voysko&quot; (). These infantry troops reinforced feudal levy horsemen or &quot;pomestnoye voysko&quot; ().

The first units were established by Ivan the Terrible as part of the first Russian standing army. The streltsy were under the administration of the &quot;Streletsky prikaz&quot; from 1571. Peter the Great curtailed the influence of the streltsy, and following the streltsy uprising of 1698, streltsy units began to be disbanded. However, it was not until the 1720s that this process was completed.

== Origins and organization ==
The first streltsy units were created by Ivan the Terrible sometime between 1545 and 1550 and armed with arquebuses. During his reign, Russia was fighting wars almost continuously, including the Livonian War against Scandinavia and the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth in the north and wars against the khanates of the south. They first saw combat at the siege of Kazan in 1552.

Tsar Ivan passed a decree on 1 October 1550 &quot;on the stationing in Moscow and surrounding districts of one thousand service people,&quot; which is considered to be the formal founding of the &quot;streltsy&quot; regiments.

Initially, streltsy were recruited from among the free tradespeople and from the rural population. Later, military service in this unit became lifelong and hereditary. While earlier in the 16th century they had been an elite force, their effectiveness was reduced by poor training and lack of choice in recruiting.
Streltsy were subdivided into &quot;select&quot; (), later &quot;Muscovite&quot; (); and &quot;municipal&quot; (, in different Russian cities).

* The Muscovite streltsy guarded the Kremlin, performed general guard duty, and participated in military operations. They also carried out general policing and fire brigade functions in Moscow. Grigory Kotoshikhin, a Russian diplomat who had spied for and then defected to the Swedish Empire in the 1660s, reported that they used axes and buckets and copper pumps as well as hooks to pull down adjacent buildings so that fires would not spread. Adam Olearius, a German who traveled to Russia in the 17th century, noted that they never used water.
* The municipal streltsy performed garrison and border duty and carried out orders of the local government.

The streltsy came under the control of the &quot;Streletsky prikaz&quot; (). In times of war, they came under their superiors. The municipal streltsy were also under the jurisdiction of the local voivodes (local governors or semi-independent rulers).

The largest military administrative unit of the streltsy forces was the body responsible for the issuing of gear or kit (). This body was later renamed &quot;prikaz&quot; (), and in 1681, regiments (). The commanders of the streltsy () and colonels in charge of regiments served as senior officers of the &quot;prikazy&quot;. They had to be nobles and were appointed by the government.

Regiments were subdivided into &quot;Hundreds&quot; () and &quot;Decades&quot; (). They could be dragoons or cavalry () or footsoldiers ().

== Uniforms and equipment ==

The streltsy had uniforms that were similar in cut but in different colours according to regiment. These uniform coats were red, yellow, blue or green (&quot;kaftans&quot;) with orange or natural leather coloured boots. Training and weapons were also standardised. Their primary weapon was an arquebus or musket, and they carried pollaxes or bardiches, and sabres for defense. Some units used pikes. The longer weapons were also used to support the arquebus or musket while firing.

==Service conditions==
The Russian government was chronically short of cash and so often did not pay the streltsy well. While &quot;entitled&quot; to an estimated four rubles a year in the 1550s, they were often allowed to farm or trade in order to supplement their incomes. This reduced their combat effectiveness and often their desire to go on campaigns, since a season campaigning meant loss of income. 

The streltsy and their families lived in their own neighborhoods or districts settlements and received money and bread from the State Treasury. In certain locations, the streltsy were granted strips of land instead of money. The streltsy settlement in Moscow was located near where the main campus of Moscow State University now stands. 

== Military tactics ==
Military commanders deployed the streltsy in static formations, often against set formations or fortifications. They often fired from a platform and employed a mobile wooden &quot;fortification&quot; known in Russian as a &quot;gulyay-gorod&quot; (literally a &quot;walking fort&quot;). They reportedly fired in volley or caracole fashion, the first line firing and then stepping back to reload while the second line stepped forward to fire.

==Politics==
At the end of the 16th century, there were 20,000 to 25,000 streltsy. In 1681, there were 55,000, including 22,500 in Moscow alone. The engagements of the streltsy in handicrafts and trade led to a significant proprietary inequality among them and their blending with tradesmen. Even though the streltsy demonstrated their fighting efficiency on several occasions, such as during the siege of Kazan in 1552, the war with Livonia, the Northern Wars in the early 17th century, and military operations in Poland and Crimea, in the second half of the 17th century, the streltsy started to display their backwardness compared to the regular soldier or reiter regiments (see Imperial Russian Army). 

Military service hardships, frequent salary delays, abuse on the part of local administration and commanders led to regular streltsy, especially the poorest ones, to participate in anti-serfdom uprisings in the 17th and early 18th centuries. These included the peasant wars in the Time of Troubles and after the last Rurikids were replaced by the Romanov tsars at the beginning of the 17th century and in 1670–1671 (such as by the cossacks of Stenka Razin), urban uprisings such as the Moscow uprising of 1682, the streltsy uprising of 1698, and the Bulavin Rebellion of 1705–1706 in Astrakhan.

At the same time, those streltsy who had been on top of the hierarchy enjoyed their social status and, therefore, tried to hold back the regular streltsy forces and keep them on the government’s side. In the late 17th century, the streltsy of Moscow began to actively participate in a struggle for power between different government groups, supporting the Old Believers and showing hostility towards any foreign innovations.

The streltsy became something of a &quot;praetorian element&quot; in Muscovite politics in the late 17th century. In 1682, they attempted to prevent Peter I from coming to the throne in favor of his half-brother, Ivan V.

==Disbandment==

After the fall of Sophia Alekseyevna in 1689, the government of Peter I engaged in a process of gradual limitation of the streltsy&#x27;s military and political influence. Eight Moscow regiments were removed from the city and transferred to Belgorod, Sevsk, and Kiev.

In spite of these measures, the streltsy revolted yet again during the Grand Embassy of Peter the Great in Europe. Although the revolt was put down by the Scottish general Patrick Gordon who had entered Russian service under Alexis I in 1661 even before the tsar&#x27;s return to Russia, Peter cut short his embassy and returned to crush the streltsy with reprisals, including public executions and torture. 

Tortures included roasting the bare back, tearing flesh with iron hooks, and crushing feet in wooden presses called &quot;butuk&quot;s. Executions included being broken on the wheel and being buried alive. Many of the bodies were hung around Novodevichy Convent where Sophia Alekseyevna and Eudoxia were confined for aiding the rebellion.

The corps was technically abolished in 1689. After having suffered a defeat at Narva in 1700, the government stopped their disbandment. The most efficient streltsy regiments took part in the most important military operations of the Great Northern War and in Peter’s Pruth River Campaign of 1711. Gradually, the streltsy were incorporated into the regular army. At the same time, the Municipal Streltsy started to be disbanded.

The liquidation of most streltsy units was finished in the 1720s. The Municipal Streltsy were kept in some cities until the late 18th century.

The Preobrazhensky Regiment and the Semyonovsky Regiment of the Imperial Guard replaced the streltsy and the traditional ryndy as the tsar&#x27;s bodyguards.

<doc id="361189" wikidata="Q844808" url="?curid=361189" title="Demodocus (Odyssey character)">
<text>In the &quot;Odyssey&quot; by Homer, Demodocus (; ) is a poet who often visits the court of Alcinous, king of the Phaeacians on the island of Scherie. During Odysseus&#x27; stay on Scherie, Demodocus performs three narrative songs.

== Description ==
Demodocus first appears at a feast in the hall of Alcinous, after he approved that Odysseus should be provided with a ship for a safe passage home. During the feast Demodocus sings about the disagreement between Odysseus and Achilles at Troy. Everyone enjoys the singing except for Odysseus who bursts into tears because of the pain and suffering of which the song reminds him. Odysseus would raise his cup and pour libations to the gods every time there was a pause in the singing but when Demodocus began again Odysseus would pull his cloak over his head to hide his tears. Only Alcinous noticed Odysseus&#x27; weeping and stopped the feast and suggests that everyone go outdoors to participate in athletic contests.

The games end with dancing and another song from Demodocus. This time he sang of the love between Ares and Aphrodite. Hephaestus was Aphrodite&#x27;s husband and found out about the affair because Helios told him that he had seen Ares and Aphrodite lying together. Hephaestus sets up an inescapable trap over his bed. When Ares and Aphrodite go to bed, they are snared in the trap and caught by Hephaestus. At dinner, after the sun had gone down, Odysseus asks Demodocus to sing his third song. Odysseus cut off a sizable piece of pork from his own portion and told a herald to bring it to Demodocus. Demodocus was grateful and began to sing. He sang of the Trojan horse and the sack of Troy. Again, Odysseus weeps uncontrollably and is able to hide it from everyone except Alcinous who ends the singing and asks Odysseus who he really is.

Demodocus is described as blind: &quot;The squire now came, leading their favorite bard, whom the Muse loved above all others, [al]though she had mingled good and evil in her gifts, robbing him of his eyes but granting him the gift of sweet song.&quot;

<text>Operation Warrior Sweep was a 2003 operation in the War in Afghanistan. It involved a July 20, 2003 deployment of about 1,000 soldiers of the Afghan National Army, together with U.S.-led coalition troops, in the Zormat Valley region and the 3,260 meter-high peaks of the Ayubkhel Valley in the southern Paktia Province in Afghanistan. The operation was in response to intelligence reports that some Taliban and al-Qaeda operatives were active in the area. It marked the first major combat operation for the Afghan troops. The Operation was completed in mid-September.

By July 29, soldiers from the 82nd Airborne Division were transported in by CH-47 Chinook helicopters to assist in the Operation.

The coalition forces uncovered dozens of grenades, C-4 plastic explosives, a crate of dynamite, more than 20 rocket propelled grenade rounds, a box of anti-aircraft rounds and hundreds of 7.62 mm and handgun rounds.

Neither Taliban nor al-Qaeda guerrillas were encountered. U.S.-led coalition forces cleared illegal checkpoints from a number of key roads, including the main road leading from Gardez to Khost. The Afghan Army secured the road leading to Zormat.

When U.S. forces arrived in the village of Atel Mohammed, residents hid their Qurans and other religious items. They feared that U.S. soldiers would kill them if they discovered they were Muslim. U.S. soldiers explained to the villagers that this was not the case.

Toward the conclusion of the Operation in mid-September, forces from the United States, Italy, Romania and Afghanistan discovered several secret caves and caches containing more than 20,000 pieces of ordnance.

<text>Come and Go is a short play (described as a &quot;dramaticule&quot; on its title page) by Samuel Beckett. It was written in English in January 1965 and first performed (in German) at the Schillertheater, Berlin on 14 January 1966. Its English language premiere was at the Peacock Theatre, Dublin on 28 February 1968, and its British premiere was at the Royal Festival Hall in London on 9 December 1968. It was written for and dedicated to the publisher John Calder.

Some critics consider this one of Beckett&#x27;s most &quot;perfect&quot; plays: Beckett agonized over each individual line until they exactly matched his creative vision. The play varies between &quot;121 and 127 words&quot; in length, depending on the translation (his notes are significantly longer than the actual play), and as such is rarely performed on its own.

==Synopsis==

The play starts with three similar figures of &quot;indeterminable&quot; age, Flo, Vi, and Ru, sitting quietly on a narrow bench-like seat surrounded by darkness. They are childhood friends who once attended &quot;Miss Wade&#x27;s&quot; together and sitting side by side in this manner is something they used to do in the playground back then. The three characters – unusually for Beckett – wear colourful full-length coats, albeit now dulled over time. They might give the impression of three faded flowers. &quot;Drab nondescript hats … shade [their] faces.&quot;

Vi&#x27;s opening line recalls the Three Witches of Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Macbeth&quot;: &quot;When did we three last meet?&quot; (&quot;When shall we three meet again?&quot; - &quot;Macbeth&quot;: Act 1, Scene 1). &quot;Their names, especially Ru&#x27;s, recall the names of the flowers which Ophelia distributes to King Claudius and his court in her mad scene&quot; (&quot;Hamlet&quot; - Act 4, Scene 5). Ru&#x27;s/Vi&#x27;s names bring to mind the phrases rue/flow which hold certain applicable implications to what transpires.

When together they make uneasy, highly stylized/processed small talk in an encounter that takes on a haunting ritual aspect. After a short time Vi, who is seated in the centre, rises and silently goes off stage. Once she is out of earshot Flo asks Ru how she thinks their absent friend is looking. &quot;I see little change,&quot; Ru replies. Then Flo slides over to the middle to whisper an awful revelation to the other and swears her to secrecy. After this Vi returns and takes the seat vacated by Flo. The same scenario is then enacted twice more &quot;[w]ith choreography suggestive of the sleight-of-hand artist (button under the thimble)&quot; and with very similar dialogue until Vi finds herself back in the middle of the group; Ru and Flo&#x27;s positions have however been reversed.

In this manner all three women at one point occupy the central position and all become privy to a secret about one of the others. Beckett said the action should be: &quot;Stiff, slow, puppet-like.&quot; The audience however does not get to hear what is whispered. The initial response in each instance is a shocked, &quot;Oh,&quot; though Beckett specified that each should be unique in some way. These three whispers present moments of dramatic climax in contrast to the otherwise slow and calm mood. The most sensational whispered information is unheard by the audience and thus creates more mystery and a sense of ongoing interconnection between the trio which includes sharing &quot;secrets.&quot;

At the play&#x27;s conclusion, the three link hands &quot;in the old way&quot; (reminiscent of Winnie&#x27;s &quot;old style&quot;) forming an unbroken Celtic knot. Finally Flo says, &quot;I can feel the rings&quot;, though none are apparent.

==Staging==

In a fashion typical of Beckett, the stage directions are exactingly detailed and precise. There are many precise numerical aspects to both the construction and staging worked out for the play. Due to the complexity of the movements throughout the piece, Beckett included a diagram of each of the characters&#x27; positioning during the performance. A diagram of the aforementioned rings, and the way they should be formed from the actors&#x27; hands, is also included. During the course of the play, each woman follows a variant set of the same basic movements performed once each involving a carefully realized silent/slow exit and reentry, shifting sitting positions on the bench, a slide to center, the whispering movements, returning to facing front, etc. This could just as easily be a mathematical or musical &quot;set&quot; with the same numbers/notes appearing in three different orders.

The precision of the lighting isolates the three women and obscures individual details so that the combined effect of costume, lighting and ritual movement creates a sense of intense similarity between the &quot;individuals&quot; comprising the trio. The one prop (the bench, described with great precision in Beckett&#x27;s notes accompanying the play) is lit so as to minimize its visibility. The women take on a ghostly aspect as they glide silently and disappear/reappear into/from the surrounding darkness.

==Interpretations==
The whole play&#x27;s structure is circular (ring-like). It is divided into three exactly equal segments of seven lines during which a character exits and comes back in after completing their circuit, taking a different seat to the one they sat on originally. In this sense the characters also move around their seats in a ring shape.

Some speculate as to what the characters are discussing. From each response (Ru: (about Vi), &quot;Does she not realise?&quot; Vi: (about Flo), &quot;Has she not been told?&quot; Flo: (about Ru), &quot;Does she not know?&quot;) it is not unreasonable to assume that each, perhaps, is in fact terminally ill but unaware of the fact. &quot;The unspoken nature of the condemnation in the final version is more powerful [than in &quot;Human Wishes&quot; (see below)] precisely because it is less explicit. For while it leaves a mystery unresolved, it also tends to lead one beyond the particular illness of an individual woman to embrace the fate of all mankind.&quot; Other possibilities include a yet to be made public death or some other tragedy involving a personal connection to whatever is whispered for the absent character being whispered about.

The play might be seen as a coming of age situation. Vi yearns for the &quot;old days&quot;, presumably when there were no awful secrets to tell but, at the same time, to which all three characters know there is no return. On one level &quot;there is a sense of loss in the play, that the women will never regain the intimacy they once had together&quot;. Brenda Bynum, who has directed the play, feels the opposite, however: ‘Why does it have to be that &quot;they&quot; have lost something, why can it not be Beckett&#x27;s longing for intimacy that they have and he can’t?’&quot; Anthony Roche agrees: &quot;[T]hey assert a strength through their interdependence which makes this play one of the most perfect theatrical ensembles ever devised.&quot;

The joining of the hands evokes the symbol for infinity. &quot;The ritual gesture of clasped hands allows them to keep their secrets from each other, but the feeling of the rings evokes the cycle of time. Twice turned upon itself, the bond of the three women (forever linked in their untold secrets) is never again what it was, never again what it seems to be. Something is the same, and everything is different.&quot; &quot;Superficially they make us think of the Three Graces as they link hands, but, more precisely, they resemble in appearance the three mothers in Fritz Lang&#x27;s &quot;M&quot;, a film much loved by Beckett.&quot;

Whereas at the start of the play there is a reluctance to talk of the past, after each of the shocking revelations the three women willingly drift off into nostalgia as a means of coping with the present.

The rings that Flo says she feels &quot;may be imagined a symbol of the frustrated hopes of youth, of marriages that never occurred [or failed] or equally their eternal union&quot; that has kept them together throughout their personal tragedies. Or, perhaps, these women meet/exist outside of time and whatever rings they might have once worn have disappeared along the way.

&quot;Ethereal though the women of &quot;Come and Go&quot; might be, they are substantial personae in comparison with the wraith-like beings of the ‘supplication plays.’ And painful though the shock to their sensibilities has been, they have the comforting presence of each other to offset their sadness. They comprise a community, and are therefore not wholly reliant on memory to remedy or sedate. No such comfort is available in the later dramaticules, however, where night after night alienated beings implore their loved ones to make their presence felt.&quot;

== Background ==
&quot;Morehampton House, [in Dublin] had originally been run by three spinster sisters and was commonly known … as &quot;Miss Wade&#x27;s.&quot; When Shelia and Molly Roe – Beckett&#x27;s cousins – attended there during the First World War, &quot;the school was run by two elderly ladies called Miss Irwin and Miss Molyneaux.&quot;

== Related Texts ==

=== &quot;Human Wishes&quot; ===
In 1936 Beckett began a full-length play entitled &quot;Human Wishes&quot; (after the poem by Dr Johnson, &quot;Vanity of Human Wishes&quot;). It was abandoned but in 1980 he allowed a fragment of this is to be published in Ruby Cohn&#x27;s &quot;Just Play&quot; and was later made more widely available in &quot;Disjecta: Miscellaneous Writings and a Dramatic Fragment&quot; edited by Cohn.

&quot;When the curtain rises, three women are seated, presumably encircled by the long gowns of the time [18th Century]. Mrs Williams is meditating, Mrs Desmoulins is knitting and Miss Carmichael is reading. During the course of the scene the latter two rise and temporarily leave their seats, but Mrs Williams&#x27;s actions are confined to striking the floor with her stick.&quot;

Beckett may have been &quot;motivated by the theme he clearly wishes to pursue: Johnson in love&quot; but that is not what he ended up writing about. &quot;The &quot;three women look as though they might have emerged from tragedy. Their dialogue – especially Mrs Williams&#x27;s lines – occasionally recalls Restoration comedy, but its substratum is human mortality, without hope of restoration. [On the other hand r]ather than … explicit references to death, &quot;Come and Go&quot; spirals delicately around absence and threat.&quot; &quot;However, more than death, it is ‘the peevishness of decay’ that pervades the scene, illustrated by the petty bickering and punctuated by the repeated silences that threaten to stop what action there is.&quot; &quot;The play fragment also points forward … to the elegant, old-fashioned language and formalised syntax of the three women in &quot;Come and Go&quot;.&quot;

=== Good Heavens ===
Flo, Vi, and Ru began their life as Viola, Rose and Poppy in a typescript now held at Reading University Library headed ‘Scene 1’. Poppy reads aloud from a titillating book, interrupted at intervals by the others. The revue-like style bears little resemblance to the finished work but it is clearly its genesis. The finished work &quot;Come and Go&quot; is extraordinary in its seeming simplicity built upon a rigorous and meticulous structure which has remarkable musical aspects in its formal discipline and clarity. Detailed analysis (identical to musical analysis of a score) is revelatory regarding Beckett&#x27;s bridging the gap between composing with notes and writing with words/images. The parallels with specific musical techniques/terminology such as cells, permutations, variants, inversions, codas, counterpoint, dynamics, etc. are uncanny. The final structure of &#x27;come and Go&quot; could easily be the precise basis for a well-balanced and rigorously formal musical composition. 

In subsequent drafts Beckett adds a title, &quot;Type of Confidence&quot;, which he changes to &quot;Good Heavens&quot;; the names also vanish to be replaced by the letters A, B and C. &quot;Beckett began the play clearly with the structure of three confidential gossips clearly in mind … before going on to draft the play in full … &quot;Good Heavens&quot; is almost complete, apart from the final conversation between C and A. In both texts the conversation centres on two secrets: first how each woman manages to achieve her apparently flawless complexion and secondly the fact that the absent member of the trio is suffering from a terminal illness … The difference between what is said face to face and what is said behind the back of the missing person reveals both a devastating feminine hypocrisy and the irony that the secret is told by someone whom the hearer already knows (or soon discovers) to be doomed also. And most ironical of all, while each woman muses upon the fate of the other two, she remains supremely unaware of her own.&quot; The final austerity achieved in the minimal text manages to reduce the triviality normally associated with &quot;gossip.&quot; It is contained within a sustained potent atmosphere that is only briefly interrupted at the three whispering moments.

In a later draft Beckett introduces &quot;three sorrowing husbands – all conspicuously absent from the marital home:

The fact that the whispered secret in &quot;Come and Go&quot; relates to life expectancy is made &quot;more explicit [in &quot;Good Heavens&quot;], even spelling out the terminal date of the third friend&#x27;s incurable ailment (‘Three months. At the outside … Not a suspicion. She thinks it is heartburn’).&quot;

=== &quot;Eleuthéria&quot; ===
&quot;The three women [in &quot;Eleuthéria&quot;], Mesdames Krap, Meck and Piouk, look forward to Flo, Vi and Ru in &quot;Come and Go&quot; in their repeated concern for each other&#x27;s appearance and health; in addition, like the women of the later short play, two of them, Violette and Marguerite, have flower-inspired Christian names.&quot;

<text>The 1913 Armory Show, also known as the International Exhibition of Modern Art, was organized by the Association of American Painters and Sculptors. It was the first large exhibition of modern art in America, as well as one of the many exhibitions that have been held in the vast spaces of U.S. National Guard armories.

The three-city exhibition started in New York City&#x27;s 69th Regiment Armory, on Lexington Avenue between 25th and 26th Streets, from February 17 until March 15, 1913. The exhibition went on to the Art Institute of Chicago and then to The Copley Society of Art in Boston, where, due to a lack of space, all the work by American artists was removed.

The show became an important event in the history of American art, introducing Americans, who were accustomed to realistic art, to the experimental styles of the European avant garde, including Fauvism and Cubism. The show served as a catalyst for American artists, who became more independent and created their own &quot;artistic language&quot;.

&quot;The origins of the show lie in the emergence of progressive groups and independent exhibitions in the early 20th century (with significant French precedents), which challenged the aesthetic ideals, exclusionary policies, and authority of the National Academy of Design, while expanding exhibition and sales opportunities, enhancing public knowledge, and enlarging audiences for contemporary art.&quot;

==History==

On December 14, 1911, an early meeting of what would become the Association of American Painters and Sculptors (AAPS) was organized at Madison Gallery in New York. Four artists met to discuss the contemporary art scene in the United States, and the possibilities of organizing exhibitions of progressive artworks by living American and foreign artists, favoring works ignored or rejected by current exhibitions. The meeting included Henry Fitch Taylor, Jerome Myers, Elmer Livingston MacRae and Walt Kuhn.

In January 1912, Walt Kuhn, Walter Pach, and Arthur B. Davies joined with some two dozen of their colleagues to reinforce a professional coalition: AAPS. They intended the organization to &quot;lead the public taste in art, rather than follow it&quot;. Other founding AAPS members included D. Putnam Brinley, Gutzon Borglum, John Frederick Mowbray-Clarke, Leon Dabo, William J. Glackens, Ernest Lawson, Jonas Lie, George Luks, Karl Anderson, James E.Fraser, Allen Tucker, and J. Alden Weir. AAPS was to be dedicated to creating new exhibition opportunities for young artists outside of the existing academic boundaries, as well as to providing educational art experiences for the American public. Davies served as president of AAPS, with Kuhn acting as secretary.

The AAPS members spent more than a year planning their first project: the International Exhibition of Modern Art, a show of giant proportions, unlike any New York had seen. The 69th Regiment Armory was settled on as the main site for the exhibition in the spring of 1912, rented for a fee of $5,000, plus an additional $500 for additional personnel. It was confirmed that the show would later travel to Chicago and Boston.

Once the space had been secured, the most complicated planning task was selecting the art for the show, particularly after the decision was made to include a large proportion of vanguard European work, most of which had never been seen by an American audience. In September 1912, Kuhn left for an extended collecting tour through Europe, including stops at cities in England, Germany, the Netherlands, and France, visiting galleries, collections and studios and contracting for loans as he went. While in Paris Kuhn met up with Pach, who knew the art scene there intimately, and was friends with Marcel Duchamp and Henri Matisse; Davies joined them there in November 1912. Together they secured three paintings that would end up being among the Armory Show&#x27;s most famous and polarizing: Matisse&#x27;s &quot;Blue Nude (Souvenir de Biskra)&quot; and &quot;Madras Rouge&quot; (&quot;Red Madras Headdress&quot;), and Duchamp&#x27;s &quot;Nude Descending a Staircase, No. 2&quot;. Only after Davies and Kuhn returned to New York in December did they issue an invitation for American artists to participate.
Pach was the only American artist to be closely affiliated with the Section d&#x27;Or group of artists, including Albert Gleizes, Jean Metzinger, Duchamp brothers Marcel Duchamp, Raymond Duchamp-Villon, Jacques Villon and others. Pach was responsible for securing loans from these painters for the Armory Show. Most of the artists in Paris who sent works to the Armory Show knew Pach personally and entrusted their works to him. The Armory Show was the first, and ultimately the only exhibition mounted by the AAPS.

In 1913, the art collector and lawyer John Quinn fought to overturn censorship laws restricting modern art and literature from entering the United States. He convinced the United States Congress to overturn the 1909 Payne–Aldrich Tariff Act, which retained the duty on foreign works of art less than 20 years old, discouraging Americans from collecting modern European art. Quinn opened the Armory Show exhibition with the words:

The Armory Show displayed some 1,300 paintings, sculptures, and decorative works by over 300 avant-garde European and American artists. Impressionist, Fauvist, and Cubist works were represented. The publicity that stormed the show had been well sought, with the publication of half-tone postcards of 57 works, including the Duchamp nude that would become its most infamous. News reports and reviews were filled with accusations of quackery, insanity, immorality, and anarchy, as well as parodies, caricatures, doggerels, and mock exhibitions. Some responded with laughter, as the artist John French Sloan seemed to not take the exhibition seriously in his published cartoon, &quot;A slight attack of third brought on by excessive study of the much-talked of cubist pictures in the International Exhibition at New York&quot;. About the modern works, former President Theodore Roosevelt declared, &quot;That&#x27;s not art!&quot; The civil authorities did not, however, close down or otherwise interfere with the show.

Among the scandalously radical works of art, pride of place goes to Marcel Duchamp&#x27;s cubist/futurist style &quot;Nude Descending a Staircase,&quot; painted the year before, in which he expressed motion with successive superimposed images, as in motion pictures. Julian Street, an art critic, wrote that the work resembled &quot;an explosion in a shingle factory&quot; (this quote is also attributed to Joel Spingarn), and cartoonists satirized the piece. Gutzon Borglum, one of the early organizers of the show who for a variety of reasons withdrew both his organizational prowess and his work, labeled this piece &quot;A staircase descending a nude&quot;, while J. F. Griswold, a writer for the &quot;New York Evening Sun&quot;, entitled it &quot;The rude descending a staircase (Rush hour in the subway)&quot;. The painting was purchased from the Armory Show by Frederic C. Torrey of San Francisco.

The purchase of Paul Cézanne&#x27;s &quot;Hill of the Poor (View of the Domaine Saint-Joseph)&quot; by the Metropolitan Museum of Art signaled an integration of modernism into the established New York museums, but among the younger artists represented, Cézanne was already an established master.

Duchamp&#x27;s brother, who went by the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Jacques Villon, also exhibited, sold all his Cubist drypoint etchings, and struck a sympathetic chord with New York collectors who supported him in the following decades.

The exhibition went on to show at the Art Institute of Chicago and then to The Copley Society of Art in Boston, where, due to a lack of space, all the work by American artists was removed.

While in Chicago, the exhibition created a scandal that reached the governor&#x27;s office. Several articles in the press recounted the issue. In one newspaper the headline read: &quot;Cubist Art Will be Investigated; Illinois Legislative Investigators to Probe the Moral Tone of the Much Touted Art&quot;:

==Legacy==

The original exhibition was an overwhelming success. There have been several exhibitions that were celebrations of its legacy throughout the 20th century.

In 1944 the Cincinnati Art Museum mounted a smaller version, in 1958 Amherst College held an exhibition of 62 works, 41 of which were in the original show, and in 1963 the Munson-Williams-Proctor Arts Institute in Utica, New York, organized the &quot;1913 Armory Show 50th Anniversary Exhibition&quot; sponsored by the Henry Street Settlement in New York, which included more than 300 works.

&quot;Experiments in Art and Technology&quot; (E.A.T.) was officially launched by the engineers Billy Klüver and Fred Waldhauer and the artists Robert Rauschenberg and Robert Whitman when they collaborated in 1966 and together organized &quot;9 Evenings: Theatre and Engineering&quot;, a series of performance art presentations that united artists and engineers. Ten artists worked with more than 30 engineers to produce art performances incorporating new technology. The performances were held in the 69th Regiment Armory, as an homage to the original and historical 1913 Armory show.

In February 2009, the Art Dealers Association of America (ADAA) presented its 21st annual &quot;Art Show&quot; to benefit the Henry Street Settlement, at the Seventh Regiment Armory, located between 66th and 67th Streets and Park and Lexington Avenues in New York City. The exhibition began as a historical homage to the original 1913 Armory Show.

Starting with a small exhibition in 1994, by 2001 The Armory Show, now held at the Javits Center, evolved into a &quot;hugely entertaining&quot; (&quot;The New York Times&quot;) annual contemporary arts festival with a strong commercial bent.

==Commemorating the centennial==
Many exhibitions in 2013 celebrated the 100th anniversary of the 1913 Armory Show, as well as a number of publications, virtual exhibitions, and programs. The first exhibition, &quot;The New Spirit: American Art in the Armory Show, 1913,&quot; opened at the Montclair Art Museum on February 17, 2013, a hundred years to the day from the original. The second exhibition was organized by the New-York Historical Society and titled &quot;The Armory Show at 100,&quot; taking place from October 18, 2013, through February 23, 2014. The Smithsonian&#x27;s Archives of American Art, which lent dozens of historic documents to both the New York Historical Society and Montclair for the exhibitions, created an online timeline of events, &quot;1913 Armory Show: the Story in Primary Sources,&quot; to showcase the records and documents created by the show&#x27;s organizers.

Showing contemporary work, a third exhibition, The Fountain Art Fair, was held at the 69th Regiment Armory itself during the 100th anniversary during March 8–10, 2013. The ethos of Fountain Art Fair was inspired by Duchamp&#x27;s famous &quot;Fountain&quot; which was the symbol of the Fair. The Art Institute of Chicago, which was the only museum to host the 1913 Armory Show, presented works February 20 – May 12, 2013, the items drawn from the museum&#x27;s modern collection that were displayed in the original 1913 exhibition. The DePaul Art Museum in Chicago, Illinois presented &quot;For and Against Modern Art: The Armory Show +100&quot;, from April 4 to June 16, 2013. The International Print Center in New York held an exhibition, &quot;1913 Armory Show Revisited: the Artists and their Prints,&quot; of prints from the show or by artists whose work in other media was included.

In addition, the Greenwich Historical Society presented &quot;The New Spirit and the Cos Cob Art Colony: Before and After the Armory Show&quot;, from October 9, 2013, through January 12, 2014. The show focused on the effects of the Armory Show on the Cos Cob Art Colony, and highlighted the involvement of artists such as Elmer Livingston MacRae and Henry Fitch Taylor in producing the show.

American filmmaker Michael Maglaras produced a documentary film about the Armory Show entitled, &quot;The Great Confusion: The 1913 Armory Show&quot;. The film premiered on September 26, 2013, at the New Britain Museum of American Art in New Britain, Connecticut.

===La Maison Cubiste (Cubist House)===
At the 1912 Salon d&#x27;Automne an architectural installation was exhibited that quickly became known as &quot;Maison Cubiste&quot; (Cubist House), signed Raymond Duchamp-Villon and André Mare along with a group of collaborators. Metzinger and Gleizes in &quot;Du &quot;Cubisme&quot;&quot;, written during the assemblage of the &quot;Maison Cubiste&quot;, wrote about the autonomous nature of art, stressing the point that decorative considerations should not govern the spirit of art. Decorative work, to them, was the &quot;antithesis of the picture&quot;. &quot;The true picture&quot; wrote Metzinger and Gleizes, &quot;bears its &quot;raison d&#x27;être&quot; within itself. It can be moved from a church to a drawing-room, from a museum to a study. Essentially independent, necessarily complete, it need not immediately satisfy the mind: on the contrary, it should lead it, little by little, towards the fictitious depths in which the coordinative light resides. It does not harmonize with this or that ensemble; it harmonizes with things in general, with the universe: it is an organism...&quot;. &quot;Mare&#x27;s ensembles were accepted as frames for Cubist works because they allowed paintings and sculptures their independence&quot;, writes Christopher Green, &quot;creating a play of contrasts, hence the involvement not only of Gleizes and Metzinger themselves, but of Marie Laurencin, the Duchamp brothers (Raymond Duchamp-Villon designed the facade) and Mare&#x27;s old friends Léger and Roger La Fresnaye&quot;. &quot;La Maison Cubiste&quot; was a fully furnished house, with a staircase, wrought iron banisters, a living room—the &quot;Salon Bourgeois&quot;, where paintings by Marcel Duchamp, Metzinger (&quot;Woman with a Fan&quot;), Gleizes, Laurencin and Léger were hung—and a bedroom. It was an example of &quot;L&#x27;art décoratif&quot;, a home within which Cubist art could be displayed in the comfort and style of modern, bourgeois life. Spectators at the Salon d&#x27;Automne passed through the full-scale 10-by-3-meter plaster model of the ground floor of the facade, designed by Duchamp-Villon. This architectural installation was subsequently exhibited at the 1913 Armory Show, New York, Chicago and Boston, listed in the catalogue of the New York exhibit as Raymond Duchamp-Villon, number 609, and entitled &quot;Facade architectural, plaster&quot; (&quot;Façade architecturale&quot;).

<text>Ohio Impromptu is a &quot;playlet&quot; by Samuel Beckett.

Written in English in 1980, it began as a favour to S.E. Gontarski, who requested a dramatic piece to be performed at an academic symposium in Columbus, Ohio, in honour of Beckett’s seventy-fifth birthday. Beckett was uncomfortable writing to order and struggled with the piece for nine months before it was ready. It was first performed on 9 May 1981 at the Stadium II Theater; Alan Schneider directed with David Warrilow as &quot;Reader&quot; and Rand Mitchell as &quot;Listener&quot;.

&quot;It is the first Beckett play to present a Doppelgänger on stage, another Beckett pair, but this time seen as mirror images; it belongs to Beckett’s ghost period, where phantoms that echo the haunting quality of memory and nostalgia in his work are seen or described on stage.&quot;

==Synopsis==

===Characters and action===

Two old men are sitting at right angles to each other beside a rectangular table. They are &quot;[a]s alike in appearance as possible&quot; both wearing long black coats and possessing long white hair. The table is white as are the chairs. The character known as &quot;Listener&quot; is facing the audience but his head is bowed and his face hidden. The other character, &quot;Reader’s&quot; posture is similar the only difference being that he has a book in front of him open at the last pages. A single &quot;[b]lack wide-brimmed hat&quot; is sitting on the table. The characters &quot;could have been borrowed from Rembrandt&quot; or from Gerard ter Borch&#x27;s &quot;Four Spanish Monks&quot; although no specific painting was suggested by Beckett himself as an inspiration. &quot;Rubin’s figure-ground experiments&quot; have also been suggested.

As soon as Reader starts to read Listener knocks on the table with his left hand at which point Reader pauses, repeats the last full sentence and then waits for a further knock on the table before recommencing. This continues throughout the entire reading and is reminiscent of &quot;Krapp’s earlier relishing in selected passages from his tapes.&quot; &quot;At one point the Listener stops the Reader from turning back to an earlier page to which the text refers, and at another the Reader pauses at a seemingly ungrammatical structure in the text, says, ‘Yes’—his one ‘impromptu’ remark—and re-reads it. Other than that one word he only vocalises exactly what is printed on the page.

Listener makes Reader repeat the last sentence of his tale and then the book is closed. &quot;Nothing is left to tell&quot; and yet Listener insists on knocking one last time but there is nothing more to read. The two look at each other without blinking until the light fades.

===The story===

The narrative, written in the past tense, tells a story of someone, possibly Listener himself, who in a “last attempt to obtain relief” following the loss of a loved one, moves away to the Isle of Swans, a place where they never had been together. In doing this he completely disregards their warning, when they appeared to him in a dream: “Stay where we were so long alone together, my shade will comfort you.”

He soon realises that he has made “a terrible mistake. Familiar surroundings could have soothed and ‘sedated’ him through their long association with his loved one, but unfamiliar surroundings accentuate his total sense of deprivation. In his bereaved state, everything conspires to remind him of what he has lost.” For whatever reason he is unable to go back, to undo what he had done. He is plagued by night terrors, something he had suffered from in the past, so far back in fact it was “as if [they had] never been.” As a result, he finds he can’t sleep.

However, one night (which could just as easily have been &quot;Once upon a time&quot;), as he is sitting with his head in his hands and trembling all over, a man appears from nowhere. He explains that he has been sent by the man’s loved one to bring him comfort, at which point he pulls “a worn volume from the pocket of his long black coat and [reads from it] till dawn”, after which he vanishes without another word. We learn that it is a “sad tale”, but no more. This continues night after night: the man appears “unheralded” and “without preamble” begins to read, and disappears at dawn “without a word”.

Eventually, the “loved one” determines that this has gone on long enough. After completing his reading one last time, the man remains and explains that this will be his final appearance. He has been told that his comforting is no longer needed and he is no longer empowered to return even if he wanted to. For a time the two, who through the many nights of readings had grown “to be as one”, sit on in silence buried in “profounds of mind … as though turned to stone”.

David Warrilow recalls Beckett’s advice to him when he undertook the role: “Now, the most useful intention that Beckett gave me early on in the &quot;Ohio Impromptu&quot; experience was to treat it like a bedtime story and let it be soothing.”

==Biographical insights==

“Beckett served for a time as Joyce’s amanuensis … the two men used to walk together on the Isle of Swans during the thirties and … Joyce used to wear a Latin Quarter hat.” Beckett confirmed these details with reference to the piece during a dinner conversation with James Knowlson. “Of course,” he said. Knowlson then mentioned that he had heard people refer to the “dear face” “as if it too were the face of Joyce”. Knowlson believed it was actually a woman and Beckett concurred: “It’s Suzanne … I’ve imagined her dead so many times. I’ve even imagined myself trudging out to her grave.” “When he wrote &quot;Ohio Impromptu&quot; [his wife] was eighty years old [and although for some time they lived quite separate lives they] had nonetheless remained a couple for over forty years” and “the thought of Suzanne dying was intolerable to him.”

The character in the story is plagued by night terrors and insomnia, as was Beckett. All his life he was troubled by nightmares. “His insomnia was probably inherited, from his mother, who suffered from the same … complaint. In the 1930s Beckett also began to experience panic attacks. “Chief among these was a feeling of suffocation, which often came on him in his room as night was falling.

The title of the play deserves some comment: &quot;Ohio Impromptu&quot; is a “straightforwardly descriptive [title], marking occasion and genre – impromptus à la Molière and Giraudoux (which were metatheatrical or self-reflexive exercises) – or more like the intricate little solo pieces Schubert, Chopin and Schumann called impromptus. “In promising an impromptu – a performance without preparation – the title of the play subverts its own promise when followed by a text which allows no extemporaneous composition, no improvisation on the part of the actors.

&quot;‘Ohio’ is [also] the answer of an American children&#x27;s riddle which goes &quot;What is high in the middle and round at the ends?&quot; or &quot;What is high in the middle and nothing at the ends?&quot; ... This gives the central theme of Beckett&#x27;s play: two voids or &#x27;nothings&#x27; - birth and death - and between the high of life.&quot;

==Interpretation==

Critics differ in their interpretations of who or what Reader is. Whether an apparition, Listener’s alter ego or an alternate aspect of his mind the nightly &#x27;reading&#x27; is clearly an essential part of Listener’s healing process. Beckett theatre specialist Anna McMullan claims that &quot;[i]n both &quot;Rockaby&quot; and &quot;Ohio Impromptu&quot; the speaking of the text becomes a rite of passage which enacts a transformation – from loss to comfort, from life to death and from speech to silence.&quot; In &quot;Rockaby&quot;, the woman has stayed on in the family home after her mother’s death; Listener has elected to run away.

&quot;As with &quot;Company&quot;, the author again returns to a theme he has portrayed many times, that loneliness and nostalgia are too personal, after a certain age, to be shared with any being other than oneself.&quot; &quot;The image of the river (the Seine) with its two arms flowing into one another after they have divided to flow around the island… is a clue to the meaning of the play. For at its emotional centre lies sadness, loss and solitude, contrasted with a memory of togetherness.&quot; So why does Listener move &quot;to&quot; the Isle of Swans rather than away? The location may have had a certain meaning for Beckett-the-person but Beckett-the-writer chose it more for its geographical features, the two rivers merging into one and also the fact that a smaller version of the Statue of Liberty stands on the isle representing the literal New World that Ohio is part of and the metaphorical new world that Listener moves to.

The arrangement of figures actually &quot;resembles the figures used in the psychological experiments early [in the 20th] century to establish the principle of closure.&quot; The divided self is a common means of approach to Beckettian texts and has been applied to &quot;Krapp’s Last Tape&quot;, &quot;Footfalls&quot;, &quot;That Time&quot; and even &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;.

Beckett may have had his own wife in mind when he wrote the play but he goes to some pains never to specify the name or gender of the loved one. This gives the text extra depth. The man could be grieving for a father or, more likely bearing in mind Beckett’s other works, his mother. Also there is nothing to prevent the loved one being a male partner and homoerotic readings of Beckett’s work are not uncommon.

As regards Reader, Gontarski himself has argued that what we are seeing is effectively a dramatisation of &quot;the elemental creative process... suggested in &quot;That Time&quot;, where the protagonist of narrative A would hide as a youth, &#x27;making up talk breaking up two or more talking to himself being together that way&#x27;.&quot;

Others suggest that Reader is the &quot;shade&quot;, some kind of spectral emissary, despatched by Listener’s dead lover to help him through the grieving process. In an early draft of the play Beckett had focussed &quot;on a ghost returning from the Underworld to speak at... a conference&quot;; the only vestige of that remaining is the pun on &quot;White nights&quot; - Whiteknights, Reading is where a great many of his manuscripts are now preserved and the address of the Beckett International Foundation.

&quot;The narrative echoes (but does not replicate or anticipate) the stag(ed) image.&quot; &quot;In the text we are told that the figures remain: &#x27;Buried in who knows what profounds of mind&#x27;. On stage, however, they raise their heads to meet each other’s eyes in meaningful contemplation.&quot; It is therefore equally plausible that the two men on stage are not the same as the two men in the story. &quot;Like an author, Listener occasionally calls for the repeat of a phrase, but Reader has his own agency, repeating a phrase unbidden at least once.&quot; One factor that suggests this might &quot;not&quot; be the case is the fact that there is only one hat between the two of them.

After the story has been read and the book closed Listener knocks once more, the signal to begin again from where Reader had left off. &quot;What do words say when there is nothing left to tell&quot; however? Beckett was obsessed by a desire to create what he called a &quot;literature of the unword&quot;, and the play represents another example of this effort.

===&quot;Beckett on film&quot;===

In Charles Sturridge&#x27;s 2002 film adaptation of &quot;Ohio Impromptu&quot; for the Beckett on Film project, modern cinematic techniques allowed Reader and Listener to both be played by the same actor (Jeremy Irons), literally fulfilling Beckett&#x27;s instruction that the two characters should be &quot;as alike in appearance as possible&quot; and following the interpretation that they are really elements in the one personality. In the text, the pair only look directly at each other at the very end. In this production, however, they communicate visually throughout.

Anna McMullan criticized this filmic interpretation of &quot;Ohio Impromptu&quot; as being &quot;led once again by a psychologized approach to performance [since] Jeremy Irons plays both parts and the ‘ghost’ fades away at dawn&quot;.

<text>The eastern screech owl (Megascops asio) or eastern screech-owl, is a small owl that is relatively common in Eastern North America, from Mexico to Canada. This species resides in most types of woodland habitats across its range, and is relatively adaptable to urban and developed areas compared to other owls. Although it often lives in close proximity to humans, the eastern screech owl frequently avoids detection due to its strictly nocturnal habits.

==Taxonomy==
The eastern screech owl was formally described in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with all the other owls in the genus &quot;Strix&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Strix asio&quot;. Linnaeus based his account on the &quot;little owl&quot; that had been described and illustrated by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his book &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;. The specific epithet is the Latin word for a type of eared owl. The eastern screech owl is now one of 22 screech owls placed in the genus &quot;Megascops&quot; that was introduced in 1848 by the German naturalist Johann Kaup. 

Five subspecies are typically recognised for the eastern screech owl, but the taxonomy in the species is considered &quot;muddled&quot;. Much of the variation may be considered clinal, as predictably, the size tends to decrease from north to south and much of the color variation is explainable by adaptation to habitat.

*&quot;M. a. asio&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) includes previously described races no longer considered valid such as &quot;M. a. carolinensis&quot;, &quot;M. a. naevius&quot; and &quot;M. a. striatus&quot;. It is resident from eastern Minnesota to southwestern Quebec and southern New Hampshire south to Missouri, Tennessee, and northern South Carolina. Dorsal color is cold gray; the red morph is common (about 39% of overall population). The nominate&#x27;s markings are coarse and sparse and its toes are densely feathered. Its primary song has a terminal, tremulous whinny. This is a medium-to-large race, measuring in wing chord length. The owls of southern Ontario are on the larger end of the scale, of similar size to the relatively big owls of Colorado and Wyoming.
*&quot;M. a. maxwelliae&quot; (Ridgway, 1877). Includes &quot;M. a. swenki&quot;. Resident from central Montana, southeastern Saskatchewan, and southern Manitoba south to western Kansas. This race is similar to &quot;M. a. asio&quot; but dorsal color tends to be a paler gray, the ventrum being whiter and less heavily marked and red morphs tending to paler and rarer (~7% of population). With a wing chord length of , this is the largest race in average linear measurements. This subspecies was named in honor of Martha Maxwell by ornithologist Robert Ridgway of the Smithsonian Institution.
*&quot;M. a. hasbroucki&quot; (Ridgway, 1914). Replacement name for the formerly described &quot;M. a. trichopsis&quot;. This subspecies is a resident from Oklahoma panhandle and southern Kansas south to Edwards Plateau of central Texas. This subspecies is also similar to &quot;M. a. asio&quot; but the dorsal color is buffy gray, the red morph being rare (~5% of population), and markings coarse and dense. This race averages at a similar size as the first two, at in wing chord length.
*&quot;M. a. mccallii&quot; (Cassin, 1854) includes previously described races such as &quot;M. a. enano&quot; and &quot;M. a. semplei&quot;. Resident from southern Texas (Big Bend to lower Rio Grande Valley) and northwestern Chihuahua and northern Coahuila southeast to eastern San Luis Potosí, this race is similar to &quot;M. a. hasbroucki&quot;, but its markings are fine and dense so the dorsum looks heavily mottled, with red morphs being rare (apparently entirely absent in South Texas). Its body size is smaller to the northern races, with a wing chord length of . Unlike other subspecies, the primary song of &quot;M. a. mccallii&quot; lacks a terminal whinny.
* &quot;M. a. floridanus&quot; (Ridgway, 1873) is resident in Florida and southern Georgia west through Gulf Coast states to western Louisiana and north in the Mississippi River valley to southeastern Arkansas. This race&#x27;s dorsal color is often rusty-brown (red morph equally common), with fine and dense markings. As described above, this subspecies may occur in a true &quot;brown morph&quot;. It is the smallest race of eastern screech owl, ranging in wing chord length from .

==Description==

Adults range from in length and weigh . Among the differently sized races, length can average from . The wingspan can range from . In Ohio, male owls average and females while in central Texas, they average and , respectively. They have either rusty or dark gray intricately patterned plumage with streaking on the underparts. Midsized by screech-owl standards, these birds are stocky, short-tailed (tail averages from in length) and broad-winged (wing chord averages from in length) as is typical of the genus. They have a large, round head with prominent ear tufts, yellow eyes, and a yellowish beak, which measures on average in length. The feet are relatively large and powerful compared to more southern screech owls and are typically feathered down to the toes, although the southernmost populations only have remnant bristles rather than full feathering on the legs and feet. The eastern screech owl (and its western counterpart) are actually some of the heaviest screech owls; the largest tropical screech owls do not exceed them in average or maximal weight, but (due to the eastern screech owls&#x27; relatively short tails) they are surpassed in length by Balsas (&quot;M. seductus&quot;), long-tufted (&quot;M. sanctaecatarinae&quot;), white-throated (&quot;M. albogularis&quot;), and rufescent owls (&quot;M. seductus&quot;), in roughly increasing order.

Two color variations are referred to as &quot;red or rufous morphs&quot; and &quot;gray morphs&quot; by bird watchers and ornithologists. Rusty birds are more common in the southern parts of the range; pairings of the two color variants do occur. While the gray morph provides remarkably effective camouflage amongst the bark of hardwood trees, red morphs may find security in certain pine trees and the colorful leaves of changing deciduous trees. The highest percentage of red morphs is known from Tennessee (79% of population) and Illinois (78% of population). A rarer &quot;brown morph&quot; is known, recorded exclusively in the south (i.e. Florida), which may be the occasional product of hybridation between the morphs. In Florida, brown morphs are typically reported in the more humid portions of the state, whereas they appear to be generally absent in the northern and northwestern parts of the state. A paler gray variation (sometimes bordering on a washed-out, whitish look) also exists in western Canada and the north-central United States.

===Confusion with other species===
In the closely related western screech owl (&quot;Megascops kennicottii&quot;), no color morphs are known; all owls of the western species are gray. Besides coloration, the western screech owl is of almost exactly the same general appearance and size as the eastern. The only reliable distinguishing feature is the bill color, which is considerably darker (often a black-gray) in the western and olive-yellow in the eastern; their voices also differ. The eastern and western screech owls overlap in the range in the Rio Grande valley at the Texas–Mexico border and the riparian woods of the Cimarron tributary of the Arkansas River on the edge of southern Great Plains. Other somewhat similar species that may abut the eastern screech owl&#x27;s range in its western and southernmost distribution, like the Middle American screech owl (&quot;Megascops guatemalae&quot;; formerly called &quot;vermiculated screech owl&quot;), whiskered screech owl (&quot;Megascops trichopsis&quot;), and the flammulated owl (&quot;Psiloscops flammeolus&quot;), are distinguished by their increasingly smaller body and foot size, different streaking pattern on breast (bolder on the whiskered, weaker on the others), different bare part coloration, and distinctive voices. Through much of the eastern United States, eastern screech owls are essentially physically unmistakable, because other owls with ear tufts are much larger and differently colored and the only other small owl, the northern saw-whet owl (&quot;Aegolius acadius&quot;) is even smaller, with no ear tufts, a more defined facial disc, and browner overall color.

=== Plumage polymorphism ===
Eastern screech owls exhibit a similar polymorphism as tawny owls, whose plumage ranges from rufous to gray. The inheritance of morph in owls is likely complex, but rufous plumage may be controlled by a dominant allele and gray plumage alleles are recessive. There are latitudinal clines in screech owl polymorphism, with northern latitudes containing mostly gray individuals and southern latitudes containing primarily rufous individuals. This cline may be driven by higher metabolic rates in rufous individuals compared to gray individuals. Evidence of higher metabolic rates was shown by a higher proportion of gray morphs in the rural areas surrounding Waco, TX compared to the warmer suburban areas. Rufous screech owls also had higher mortality during cold winters.

==Distribution and habitat==

Eastern screech owls inhabit open mixed woodlands, deciduous forests, parklands, wooded suburban areas, riparian woods along streams and wetlands (especially in drier areas), mature orchards, and woodlands near marshes, meadows, and fields. They try to avoid areas known to have regular activity of larger owls, especially great horned owls (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;). Their ability to live in heavily developed areas outranks even the great horned and certainly the barred owl (&quot;Strix varia&quot;); screech owls also are considerably more successful in the face of urbanization than barn owls (&quot;Tyto alba&quot;) following the conversion of what was once farmland. Due to the introduction of open woodland and cultivated strips in the Great Plains, the range of eastern screech owls there has expanded. Eastern screech owls have been reported living and nesting in spots such as along the border of a busy highway and on the top of a street light in the middle of a busy town square. They often nest in trees in neighborhoods and urban yards inhabited by humans. In such urban environments, they often meet their dietary needs via introduced species that live close to humans such as house sparrows (&quot;Passer domesticus&quot;) and house mice (&quot;Mus musculus&quot;). They also consume anole lizards and large insects such as cicadas. They occupy the greatest range of habitats of any owl east of the Rockies. Eastern screech owls roost mainly in natural cavities in large trees, including cavities open to the sky during dry weather. In suburban and rural areas, they may roost in manmade locations such as behind loose boards on buildings, in boxcars, or on water tanks. They also roost in dense foliage of trees, usually on a branch next to the trunk, or in dense, scrubby brush. The distribution of the species is largely concurrent with the distribution of eastern deciduous woodlands, probably discontinuing at the Rocky Mountains in the west and in northern Mexico in the south due to the occupation of similar niches by other screech owls and discontinuing at the start of true boreal forest because of the occupation of a similar niche by other small owls (especially boreal owls (&quot;Aegolius funereus&quot;). Eastern screech owls may be found from sea level up to in elevation in the eastern Rocky Mountains and up to in the eastern Sierra Madre Oriental Mountains, although their altitudinal limits in the Appalachian Mountains, near the heart of their distribution, is not currently known.

==Behavior==
Eastern screech owls are strictly nocturnal, roosting during the day in cavities or next to tree trunks. They are quite common, and can often be found in residential areas. However, due to their small size and camouflage, they are much more frequently heard than actually seen. These owls are frequently heard calling at night, especially during their spring breeding season. Despite their name, this owl does not truly screech. The eastern screech owl&#x27;s call is a tremolo with a descending, whinny-like quality, like that of a miniature horse. They also produce a monotone purring trill lasting 3–5 seconds. Their voices are unmistakable and follow a noticeably different phrasing than that of the western screech owl. The lugubrious nature of the eastern screech owl&#x27;s call has warranted description such as, &quot;A most solemn graveyard ditty, the mutual consolation of suicide lovers remembering the pangs and delights of the supernal love in the infernal groves, &quot;Oh-o-o-o-o that I never had been bor-r-r-r-n!&quot;.

===Breeding===

Their breeding habitat is deciduous or mixed woods in eastern North America. Usually solitary, they nest in a tree cavity, either natural or excavated by a woodpecker. Holes must have a entrance to accommodate this owl. Usually, they fit only in the holes excavated by northern flickers (&quot;Colaptes auratus&quot;) or pileated woodpeckers (&quot;Dryocopus pileatus&quot;), as apparently the midsized red-bellied woodpecker (&quot;Melanerpes carolinensis&quot;) make holes that are not large enough to accommodate them. Orchards, which often have trees with crevices and holes, as well as meadow voles (&quot;Microtus pennsylvanicus&quot;), a dietary favorite, are often preferred nesting habitats. Eastern screech owls also use nesting boxes erected by humans. Although some people put up nest boxes meant for screech owls, the owls also take over nest boxes meant for others, such as those for wood ducks (&quot;Aix sponsa&quot;), houses erected for purple martins (&quot;Progne subis&quot;), and dovecotes put up for rock doves (&quot;Columba livia&quot;), occasionally killing and consuming at least the latter two in the process of taking over the nest box. A 9-year study comparing the breeding success of eastern screech owls nesting in natural cavities and nesting in nest boxes showed that the fledging rate was essentially the same, although in some years, up to 10% more success occurred in the natural cavities. Depending on the origins of the hole being used, eastern screech owl nests have been recorded from off the ground. Like all owls, these birds do not actually build a nest; instead, females lay their eggs directly on the bare floor of the nest hole or on the layer of fur and feathers left over from previous meals that line the bottom of its den. Breeding pairs often return to the same nest year after year.

This species commences egg laying on average about two months after great horned owls, but about two weeks before American kestrels (&quot;Falco sparveius&quot;) and almost throughout the range lays its first egg at some point in April. Eggs are laid at two-day intervals and incubation begins after laying of the first egg. Eggs vary in size in synch with their ultimate body size, ranging from an average of in the Northern Rockies to in south Texas. From one to six eggs have been recorded per clutch, with an average of 4.4 in Ohio, 3.0 in Florida, and 4.56 in the north-central United States. The incubation period is about 26 days, and the young reach the fledging stage at about 31 days old. Females do most of the incubating and brooding, but males also occasionally take shifts. As is the typical division of labor in owls, the male provides most of the food while the female primarily broods the young, and they stockpile food during the early stages of nesting, although the male tends to work hard nightly because many nestlings often appear to live almost entirely on freshly caught insects and invertebrates. The male&#x27;s smaller size make it superior in its nimbleness, which allows it to catch insects and other swift prey. Eastern screech owls are single-brooded, but may renest if the first clutch is lost, especially towards the southern end of its range. When the young are small, the female tears the food apart for them. The female, with her larger size and harder strike, takes on the duty of defending the nest from potential threats, and even humans may be aggressively attacked, sometimes resulting in them drawing blood from the head and shoulders of human passers-by.

===Feeding habits===

Like most predators, eastern screech owls are opportunistic hunters. Due to the ferocity and versatility of their hunting style, early authors nicknamed eastern screech owls &quot;feathered wildcats&quot;. In terms of ecological niche, they have no easy ecological equivalent in Europe, perhaps the closest being the little owl (&quot;Athene noctua&quot;), the similar looking Eurasian scops owl (&quot;Otus scops&quot;) being smaller and weaker and the long-eared owl (&quot;Asio otus&quot;) more fully dependent on rodents. The success of eastern screech (and western screech) owls in North America may be the reason long-eared owls are much more restricted to limited northern forest habitat in North America than they are in Europe. Eastern screech owls hunt from dusk to dawn, with most hunting being done during the first four hours of darkness. A combination of sharp hearing and vision is used for prey location. These owls hunt mainly from perches, dropping down onto prey. Occasionally, they also hunt by scanning through the treetops in brief flights or hover to catch prey. This owl mainly hunts in open woodlands, along the edges of open fields or wetlands, or makes short forays into open fields. When prey is spotted, the owl dives quickly and seizes it in its talons. Small prey usually is swallowed whole on the spot, while larger prey is carried in the bill to a perch and then torn into pieces. An eastern screech owl tends to frequent areas in its home range where it hunted successfully on previous nights. The eastern screech owl&#x27;s sense of hearing is so acute, it can even locate mammals under heavy vegetation or snow. The bird&#x27;s ears (as opposed to its ear tufts) are placed asymmetrically on its head, enabling it to use the differences between each ear&#x27;s perception of sound to home in on prey. Additionally, the feathers the eastern screech owl uses to fly are serrated at their tips. This muffles the noise the bird makes when it flaps its wings, enabling it to sneak up on prey quietly. Both the specialized ear placement and wing feathers are a feature shared by most living owl species to aid them in hunting in darkness.

During the breeding season, large insects are favored in their diet, with invertebrates often composing more than half of the owls&#x27; diet. Some regularly eaten insects include beetles, moths, crickets, grasshoppers, katydids, and cicadas, although they likely consume any commonly available flying insect. Also taken are crayfish, snails, spiders, earthworms, scorpions, leeches, millipedes, and centipedes. Small mammals, ranging in size from shrews to young rabbits (&quot;Sylvilagus&quot; ssp.), are regular prey and almost always become the owl&#x27;s primary food during winter. Small rodents such as microtine rodents and mice account for about 67% of mammals taken, although rodents of a similar weight to the owl, such as rats and squirrels, especially the red squirrel (&quot;Tamiasciurus hudsonicus&quot;), are also taken. Jumping mice (&quot;Zapus&quot; ssp.), chipmunks, moles, and bats (especially the little brown bat (&quot;Myotis lucifugus&quot;) may be taken occasionally. Small birds such as chickadees (&quot;Poecile&quot; ssp.), swallows, sparrows, finches, flycatchers, and warblers are the most common avian prey, and such species are normally caught directly from their nocturnal perches or during nocturnal migration. In Ohio, the most commonly reported avian prey species, and most commonly stored food items behind meadow voles, were yellow-rumped warblers (&quot;Setophaga coronata&quot;) and white-throated sparrows (&quot;Zonotrichus albicollis&quot;). Abundant midsized avian or largish passerine prey are also not uncommon foods, such as mourning doves (&quot;Zenaida macroura&quot;), downy woodpeckers (&quot;Picoides pubescens&quot;), northern flickers, blue jays (&quot;Cyanocitta cristata&quot;), American robins (&quot;Turdus migratorius&quot;), European starling (&quot;Sturnus vulgaris&quot;), red-winged blackbirds (&quot;Agelaius phoeniceus&quot;), and common grackles (&quot;Quiscalus quiscula&quot;). However, larger avian prey are sometimes caught, including northern bobwhite (&quot;Colinus virginianus&quot;) and American woodcocks (&quot;Scolopax minor&quot;) and even feral pigeons and ruffed grouse (&quot;Bonasa umbellus&quot;), most likely young or fledgling aged birds, but all of which are likely to be heavier than the screech owls themselves. All told, more than 100 species of bird have been hunted by eastern screech owls. Irregularly, small fish, small snakes (i.e. &quot;Heterodon&quot; ssp.), lizards, baby soft-shelled turtles (&quot;Apalone&quot; ssp.), small frogs such as tree frogs and northern leopard frogs (&quot;Lithobates pipiens&quot;), toads, newts, and salamanders are also preyed upon. They have even been observed hunting for fish at fishing holes made by people or cracks in ice at bodies of water during winter. The most commonly reported fish prey in Ohio were American gizzard shad (&quot;Dorosoma cepedianum&quot;) and green sunfish (&quot;Lepomis cyanellus&quot;). Brown bullheads (&quot;Ameiurus nebulosus&quot;) have been captured by eastern screech owls along coastal areas during winter.

From hundreds of prey remains from Ohio, 41% were found to be mammals (23% of which were mice or voles), 18% were birds, and 41% were insects and other assorted invertebrates. Of vertebrates taken in the nesting season, 65% were birds (of about 54 species), 30% were mammals (11% meadow voles; 8% each of house mice and deermice of the genus &quot;Peromyscus&quot;), 3% were fish, and less than 2% were reptiles and amphibians. In Michigan, among winter foods, 45–50% were meadow voles, 45% were white-footed mice (&quot;Peromyscus leucopus&quot;) and 1–10% were birds; during the summer, these respective numbers changed to 30, 23, and 19%, with as much as 28% of the food in summer being crayfish (&quot;Cambarus&quot; ssp.). Due to meeting the needs of their nestlings, eastern screech owls frequently consume less per day during summer than they do during winter. Five owls captured in April, averaging about in males and in females, gained on average when captured in fall (October–December) and when captured in winter (January–February). In Michigan, screech owls consumed about 25% of their own weight per day during winter against 16% of their weight in summer. The average weight of vertebrate prey for screech owls in Michigan is In Wisconsin, the average weight of vertebrate prey is . While much of their insect prey can weigh only a fraction of a gram, their largest prey, such as adult rats and pigeons and juvenile rabbits and gamebirds, can weigh up to at least .

=== Urban/suburban vs. rural behavior ===
Eastern screech owls are known for their ability to live in close proximity to humans. There is previous information pointing to potential behavioral adaptations of urban and suburban eastern screech owls from their rural counterparts. There have been previous studies that found suburban eastern screech owls breed no differently in man-made nest boxes than in natural tree cavities. Climate, food sources, and predator presence are some potential factors that impact the behaviors of suburban and rural eastern screech owls. Living in suburbia can have some additional impacts on eastern screech owl behavior such as secondary poisoning, vehicles, and more predation and competition from raccoon, opossum and squirrels.

Previous research has shown that male eastern screech owls find and defend two to three potential nesting sites (man-made and natural) in order to have backups for failed first nesting attempts. However, in a study by Gehlbach it was found that suburban eastern screech owls had fewer alternative nesting sites due to humans cutting down trees with natural cavities, pruning the trees, or filling in the natural cavities with cement. Gehlbach also found that nesting sites close to houses and with fewer surrounding shrubs were some of the most used. Additionally, older eastern screech owls were found to be more likely to habituate to human disturbances compared to younger eastern screech owls. A study by Artuso found that there were larger average brood sizes and earlier average fledging dates of eastern screech owls shown in moderate and high-density suburban areas than in low-density suburban and rural areas. Urban and suburban populations of eastern screech owls are more dense and productive than their rural counterparts. There are various differences in habitat that have impacts on the nesting behaviors of eastern screech owls.

Eastern screech owl feeding behaviors have also been shown through previous research to be impacted by whether the owl lived in a rural or suburban area. In a previous study, prey diversity for eastern screech owls peaked in low-density suburban areas. The owl&#x27;s feeding habits changed based on the habitat type—owls in low-density suburban sites consumed almost double the amount of birds in non-breeding season as owls in high-density sites and triple that of owls in rural sites. Rural owls generally consumed more invertebrates and fewer caterpillars and earthworms. It is already known that eastern screech owl diets vary throughout the breeding and non-breeding season, but now there is more research describing habitat&#x27;s role in feeding behaviors as well.

The climate within urban or suburban and rural areas differ as well which in turn impacts eastern screech owl behavior. Suburban climate is typically warmer than rural climate due to the &quot;heat island effect&quot;. A previous study showed that as suburban climates got warmer over the course of a few years, eastern screech owls started nesting an average of 4.5 days earlier annually. There were also more avian prey and a 93% success rate in annual nests. Bird baths and feeders located in the suburban habitats were also noted as being likely factors in enhancing residence successes.  

==Mortality==
While eastern screech owls have lived for over 20 years in captivity, wild birds seldom, if ever, live that long. Mortality rates of young and nestling owls may be as high as 70% (usually significantly less in adult screech owls). Many losses are due to predation. Common predators at screech owl nests including Virginia opossums (&quot;Didelphis virginiana&quot;), American minks (&quot;Neogale vison&quot;), weasels (&quot;Mustela&quot; and &quot;Neogale&quot; sp.), raccoons (&quot;Procyon lotor&quot;), ringtails (&quot;Bassariscus astutus&quot;), skunks (&quot;Mephitis&quot; and &quot;Spilogale&quot; sp.), snakes, crows (&quot;Corvus&quot; sp.), and blue jays (&quot;Cyanocitta cristata&quot;). Eastern fox squirrels (&quot;Sciurus niger&quot;) may raid the tree holes being used by eastern screech owls, not only destroying or consuming the eggs, but also displacing the adult owls from the hole to use the hole for themselves. Adults have fewer predators, but larger species of owls do take them, since they have similar periods of activity. Larger owls known to have preyed on eastern screech owls have included great horned owls (&quot;Bubo virginianus&quot;), barred owls (&quot;Strix varia&quot;), spotted owls (&quot;Strix occidentalis&quot;), long-eared owls (&quot;Asio otus&quot;), short-eared owls (&quot;Asio flammeus&quot;), and snowy owls (&quot;Bubo scandianus&quot;). Diurnal birds of prey may also kill and eat them, including Cooper&#x27;s hawks (&quot;Accipiter cooperii&quot;), northern harriers (&quot;Circus cyaenus&quot;), red-tailed hawks (&quot;Buteo jamaicensis&quot;), red-shouldered hawk (&quot;Buteo lineatus&quot;) and rough-legged hawks (&quot;Buteo lagopus&quot;). Most prolific by far of the eastern screech owl&#x27;s avian predators is the great horned owl, which can destroy up to 78% of a local population, but locally, Cooper&#x27;s hawks and barred owls are almost as serious of a threat. A most dramatic case illustrating the owl food chain involved a barred owl, which upon examination after being shot in New England, contained a long-eared owl in its stomach that, in its own stomach, contained an eastern screech owl. All other common owls in this species range also live on similar rodent prey, but direct competition is obviously disadvantageous to the screech owl. One exception is the even smaller northern saw-whet owl, on which eastern screech owls have been known to prey. In rural Michigan, 9 different species of owls and diurnal raptors including the screech owl fed primarily on the same four species of small rodents from the &quot;Peromyscus&quot; and &quot;Microtus&quot; genera. Eastern screech owls have had nesting attempts fail due to biocide poisoning, which causes the thinning of eggs and failure of nests, but seemingly not to the overall detriment of the species. Collisions with cars, trains, and windowpanes kill many screech owls, the earlier especially while feeding on road-side rodents and road kills.

===Parasites===
This species has the potential to be infected by several parasites, including &quot;Plasmodium elongatum&quot;, &quot;Plasmodium forresteri&quot;, and &quot;Plasmodium gundersi&quot;.

<text>The British Trust for Ornithology (BTO) is an organisation founded in 1932 for the study of birds in the British Isles. The Prince of Wales has been patron since October 2020.

==History==

===Beginning===
In 1931 Max Nicholson wrote:
In the United States, Hungary, Holland and elsewhere a clearing-house for research is provided by the state: in this country such a solution would be uncongenial, and we must look for some alternative centre of national scope not imposed from above but built up from below. An experiment on these lines has been undertaken at Oxford since the founding of the Oxford Bird Census in 1927 [...]. The scheme now has a full-time director, Mr W.B.Alexander. [...] It is intended to put this undertaking on a permanent footing and to build it up as a clearing-house for bird-watching results in this country.

This led to a meeting at the British Museum (Natural History) in February 1932, which in turn led to the foundation of an organisation to develop the Oxford scheme. The name &quot;British Trust for Ornithology&quot; was used from May 1933 and an appeal for funds was published in The Times on 1 July. Max Nicholson was the first treasurer, Bernard Tucker the secretary. Harry Witherby was an early benefactor and vice-chair.

Much has been discovered about birds by watching and counting them, but such methods rarely allow birds to be identified as individuals. This is essential if we are to learn about how long they live and when and where they move, questions that are vital for bird conservation. Bird ringing (placing a lightweight, uniquely numbered, metal ring around a bird&#x27;s leg) provides a reliable and harmless method of identifying birds as individuals.

Each ring also has an address so that anyone finding a ringed bird can help by reporting where and when it was found and what happened to it. Some ringing projects also use colour rings to allow individual birds to be identified without being caught.

Birds have been ringed in Britain and Ireland for nearly a hundred years and it still reveals new facts about migration routes and wintering areas. The primary focus of the BTO&#x27;s ringing schemes is now the monitoring of bird populations, to provide information on how many young birds leave the nest and survive to become adults, as well as how many adults survive the stresses of breeding, migration and severe weather. Changes in survival rates and other aspects of birds&#x27; biology can indicate the causes of population changes. 

The BTO runs two specialized projects to collect this information. The Constant Effort Sites (CES) scheme provides information on population size, breeding success and survival of bird species living in scrub and wetland habitats. Ringers work at over 130 CES scheme sites each year. The Retrapping Adults for Survival (RAS) project gathers survival data for a wide range of species, particularly those of current conservation concern. 

Ringing revealed that declines in the number of Sedge Warblers breeding in Britain and Ireland was linked to lower levels of rainfall in their African wintering quarters; whilst the recent dramatic decline in the numbers of Song Thrushes was found to relate to a reduction in the survival rate of young birds. This information should aid identification of the environmental factors responsible for the decline.

The BTO is a member of the European Union for Bird Ringing (EURING), and hosts the EURING Databank.

===Edward Grey Institute===
In 1938 the BTO contributed funds to the new Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology.

In 1947, the institute became part of a new department of Zoological Field Studies at the University of Oxford, and the BTO again concentrated on a programme of volunteer-based surveys.

===Beech Grove===
In December 1962, at the behest of Tony Norris, the BTO purchased Beech Grove, a large Victorian house in Tring, Hertfordshire, relocating there from Oxford, along with their Ringing Office, which had been at the British Museum.

===The Nunnery===
In April 1991, the BTO moved to The Nunnery, Thetford, Norfolk, a large property lying between the A134 and the River Little Ouse, which had been donated to them. Parts of the medieval Benedictine Nunnery of St George can still be seen on this site.

The BTO also runs its only bird reserve, Nunnery Lakes Reserve, on this site. The reserve lies between the River Thet and the River Little Ouse, extending upstream from The Nunnery, along the banks of the Little Ouse, and incorporates several flooded gravel pits.

In the early 2000s, a new library was created there, dedicated to the memory of Chris Mead. Professor Jeremy Greenwood PhD, who had been Director since 1988, retired in September 2007. The current chief executive officer is Dr Juliet Vickery, as of 2020.

==Activities==
The BTO carries out research into the lives of birds, chiefly by conducting population and breeding surveys and by bird ringing, largely carried out by a large number of volunteers. Its &quot;Garden Birdwatch&quot; survey, for example, allows large numbers of birdwatchers to participate, by making a weekly count of the birds they see in their gardens.

===Journals===
The BTO publishes a number of journals:
*&quot;Bird Study&quot; - a scientific journal, published since 1954. 
*&quot;BTO News&quot; - the newsletter for all members. 
* &quot;Bird Table&quot; - for participants in the Garden BirdWatch Project. 
*&quot;Ringing &amp; Migration&quot; - Journal of the BTO Ringing Scheme.
*&quot;WeBS News&quot; - newsletter for participants in the Wetland Bird Survey.

===Atlases===
In September 1967, inspired by on-going work on the innovative &quot;Atlas of Breeding Birds of the West Midlands&quot;, produced by the West Midland Bird Club, and in partnership with the Irish Wildbird Conservancy (now BirdWatch Ireland), work began on the first &quot;Atlas of Breeding Birds in Britain and Ireland&quot;. 3,862 10 km squares were surveyed and the atlas was published in 1976.

The New Atlas (1993) updated and refined this huge survey, again with the help of IWC and the Scottish Ornithologists Club. A &quot;Winter Atlas&quot; and a &quot;Historical Atlas&quot; have also been published. The groundbreaking &quot;Migration Atlas&quot; presents the results of almost 100 years of bird ringing. As with all BTO studies, the vast majority of the fieldwork was undertaken by volunteers.

The &quot;Bird Atlas 2007–11&quot;, published November 2013, combines breeding and winter surveys across the entire UK and Ireland, involving the BTO, Birdwatch Ireland, and the Scottish Ornithologist&#x27;s Club, in order to produce a new atlas. Fieldwork began in winter 2007, and was due to continue until the end of 2011.

===Awards===

The trust awards the Bernard Tucker Medal for services to ornithology, named in memory of Bernard Tucker, the first secretary, and the Dilys Breese Medal in honour of Dilys Breese and several Marsh Awards for Ornithology.

=== BirdTrack ===

BirdTrack is an online citizen science website, operated by the BTO on behalf of a partnership of the BTO, the RSPB, BirdWatch Ireland, the Scottish Ornithologists&#x27; Club and the Welsh Ornithological Society ().

<text>The Edward Grey Institute of Field Ornithology (EGI), at Oxford University in England, is an academic body that conducts research in ornithology and the general field of evolutionary ecology and conservation biology, with an emphasis on understanding organisms in natural environments. It is named in honour of Edward Grey, 1st Viscount Grey of Fallodon, a notable politician and ornithologist, and is part of the Department of Zoology at Oxford University.

The Institute houses the Alexander Library, the best ornithological library in Europe and one of the best in the world, which is named after W. B. Alexander.

==History==
The Edward Grey Institute (EGI) was founded in 1938, having grown out of the Oxford Bird Census, itself founded in 1927. It was the brainchild of Max Nicholson, Bernard Tucker, and Wilfred (&#x27;W. B.&#x27;) Alexander, and was initially founded to promote the economic study of ornithology. It took its name from Viscount Grey, at one time Chancellor of the University and UK Foreign Secretary, and a lifelong birdwatcher, perhaps best known as the man who remarked, on the eve of the First World War: &quot;The lamps are going out all over Europe; we shall not see them lit again in our lifetime.&quot;

The first Director of the fledgling Institute was W. B. Alexander, remembered in the name of the EGI&#x27;s library, the Alexander Library. Alexander was succeeded in 1945 by former school-teacher David Lack, one of the pioneers of population biology, who had already published &quot;The Life of the Robin&quot;. Lack served as Director until his death in 1973, working with field assistants such as Denis Owen, and oversaw the growth of the EGI into an internationally known centre for research into population biology of birds.

Lack was succeeded by Chris Perrins in 1974, who continued as Director until his official retirement in 2002. During this time, work in the EGI expanded from the field of population biology to encompass the new field of behavioural ecology, with John Krebs and Nick Davies (then at Oxford, later Professor of Behavioural Ecology at Cambridge) co-authoring the textbooks that defined the field. The EGI was also the centre for work on &quot;The Birds of the Western Palearctic&quot;, up to its completion in 1990s, and became increasingly important as a training centre for ornithologists who went on to play important roles in conservation.

Following Perrins&#x27; retirement, a major endowment in honour of Dr Luc Hoffmann&#x27;s eightieth birthday led to the establishment of the Luc Hoffmann Chair in Field Ornithology. Ben Sheldon was elected as the first holder of this chair, and as Director of the EGI in 2004.

By the end of 2006, a total of 165 DPhil students had successfully defended their theses based on work carried out at the EGI; this number is at least matched by the number of postdoctoral and other research visitors who have spent time at the Institute. Scientific research work on birds has been conducted on all continents and the major research themes of the EGI, population and evolutionary ecology of birds have been supplemented by a very wide range of research activities.

<text>In mathematics, a rational function is any function that can be defined by a rational fraction, which is an algebraic fraction such that both the numerator and the denominator are polynomials. The coefficients of the polynomials need not be rational numbers; they may be taken in any field . In this case, one speaks of a rational function and a rational fraction &quot;over &quot;. The values of the variables may be taken in any field containing . Then the domain of the function is the set of the values of the variables for which the denominator is not zero, and the codomain is .

The set of rational functions over a field is a field, the field of fractions of the ring of the polynomial functions over .

==Definitions==
A function formula_1 is called a rational function if it can be written in the form

:formula_2

where formula_3 and formula_4 are polynomial functions of formula_5 and formula_4 is not the zero function. The domain of formula_1 is the set of all values of formula_5 for which the denominator formula_9 is not zero.

However, if formula_10 and formula_11 have a non-constant polynomial greatest common divisor formula_12, then setting formula_13 and formula_14 produces a rational function

:formula_15

which may have a larger domain than formula_1, and is equal to formula_1 on the domain of formula_18 It is a common usage to identify formula_19 and formula_20, that is to extend &quot;by continuity&quot; the domain of formula_1 to that of formula_22 Indeed, one can define a rational fraction as an equivalence class of fractions of polynomials, where two fractions formula_23 and formula_24 are considered equivalent if formula_25. In this case formula_26 is equivalent to formula_27

A proper rational function is a rational function in which the degree of formula_28 is less than the degree of formula_9 and both are real polynomials, named by analogy to a proper fraction in formula_30

===Complex rational functions===
In complex analysis, a rational function

:formula_31

is the ratio of two polynomials with complex coefficients, where is not the zero polynomial and and have no common factor (this avoids taking the indeterminate value 0/0).

The domain of is the set of complex numbers such that formula_32.
Every rational function can be naturally extended to a function whose domain and range are the whole Riemann sphere (complex projective line).

A complex rational function with degree one is a Möbius transformation.

Rational functions are representative examples of meromorphic functions.

Iteration of rational functions on the Riemann sphere (i.e. a rational mapping) creates discrete dynamical systems.
===Degree===
There are several non equivalent definitions of the degree of a rational function.

Most commonly, the &quot;degree&quot; of a rational function is the maximum of the degrees of its constituent polynomials and , when the fraction is reduced to lowest terms. If the degree of is , then the equation

:formula_33

has distinct solutions in except for certain values of , called &quot;critical values&quot;, where two or more solutions coincide or where some solution is rejected at infinity (that is, when the degree of the equation decreases after having cleared the denominator).

The degree of the graph of a rational function is not the degree as defined above: it is the maximum of the degree of the numerator and one plus the degree of the denominator.

In some contexts, such as in asymptotic analysis, the &quot;degree&quot; of a rational function is the difference between the degrees of the numerator and the denominator.

In network synthesis and network analysis, a rational function of degree two (that is, the ratio of two polynomials of degree at most two) is often called a .

==Examples==
The rational function

:formula_34

is not defined at

:formula_35

It is asymptotic to formula_36 as formula_37

The rational function

:formula_38

is defined for all real numbers, but not for all complex numbers, since if &quot;x&quot; were a square root of formula_39 (i.e. the imaginary unit or its negative), then formal evaluation would lead to division by zero:

:formula_40

which is undefined.

A constant function such as is a rational function since constants are polynomials. The function itself is rational, even though the value of is irrational for all .

Every polynomial function formula_41 is a rational function with formula_42 A function that cannot be written in this form, such as formula_43 is not a rational function. However, the adjective &quot;irrational&quot; is not generally used for functions.

Every Laurent polynomial can be written as a rational function while the converse is not necessarily true, i.e., the ring of Laurent polynomials is a subring of the rational functions.

The rational function formula_44 is equal to 1 for all &quot;x&quot; except 0, where there is a removable singularity. The sum, product, or quotient (excepting division by the zero polynomial) of two rational functions is itself a rational function. However, the process of reduction to standard form may inadvertently result in the removal of such singularities unless care is taken. Using the definition of rational functions as equivalence classes gets around this, since &quot;x&quot;/&quot;x&quot; is equivalent to 1/1.

==Taylor series==
The coefficients of a Taylor series of any rational function satisfy a linear recurrence relation, which can be found by equating the rational function to a Taylor series with indeterminate coefficients, and collecting like terms after clearing the denominator.

For example,

:formula_45

Multiplying through by the denominator and distributing,

:formula_46

:formula_47

After adjusting the indices of the sums to get the same powers of &quot;x&quot;, we get

:formula_48

Combining like terms gives

:formula_49

Since this holds true for all &quot;x&quot; in the radius of convergence of the original Taylor series, we can compute as follows. Since the constant term on the left must equal the constant term on the right it follows that

:formula_50

Then, since there are no powers of &quot;x&quot; on the left, all of the coefficients on the right must be zero, from which it follows that

:formula_51

:formula_52

Conversely, any sequence that satisfies a linear recurrence determines a rational function when used as the coefficients of a Taylor series. This is useful in solving such recurrences, since by using partial fraction decomposition we can write any proper rational function as a sum of factors of the form and expand these as geometric series, giving an explicit formula for the Taylor coefficients; this is the method of generating functions.

==Abstract algebra== 
In abstract algebra the concept of a polynomial is extended to include formal expressions in which the coefficients of the polynomial can be taken from any field. In this setting, given a field &quot;F&quot; and some indeterminate &quot;X&quot;, a rational expression (also known as a rational fraction or, in algebraic geometry, a rational function) is any element of the field of fractions of the polynomial ring &quot;F&quot;[&quot;X&quot;]. Any rational expression can be written as the quotient of two polynomials &quot;P&quot;/&quot;Q&quot; with &quot;Q&quot; ≠ 0, although this representation isn&#x27;t unique. &quot;P&quot;/&quot;Q&quot; is equivalent to &quot;R&quot;/&quot;S&quot;, for polynomials &quot;P&quot;, &quot;Q&quot;, &quot;R&quot;, and &quot;S&quot;, when &quot;PS&quot; = &quot;QR&quot;. However, since &quot;F&quot;[&quot;X&quot;] is a unique factorization domain, there is a unique representation for any rational expression &quot;P&quot;/&quot;Q&quot; with &quot;P&quot; and &quot;Q&quot; polynomials of lowest degree and &quot;Q&quot; chosen to be monic. This is similar to how a fraction of integers can always be written uniquely in lowest terms by canceling out common factors.

The field of rational expressions is denoted &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;). This field is said to be generated (as a field) over &quot;F&quot; by (a transcendental element) &quot;X&quot;, because &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) does not contain any proper subfield containing both &quot;F&quot; and the element &quot;X&quot;.

===Notion of a rational function on an algebraic variety=== 
Like polynomials, rational expressions can also be generalized to &quot;n&quot; indeterminates &quot;X&quot;1..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;, by taking the field of fractions of &quot;F&quot;[&quot;X&quot;1..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;], which is denoted by &quot;F&quot;(&quot;X&quot;1..., &quot;X&quot;&quot;n&quot;).

An extended version of the abstract idea of rational function is used in algebraic geometry. There the function field of an algebraic variety &quot;V&quot; is formed as the field of fractions of the coordinate ring of &quot;V&quot; (more accurately said, of a Zariski-dense affine open set in &quot;V&quot;). Its elements &quot;f&quot; are considered as regular functions in the sense of algebraic geometry on non-empty open sets &quot;U&quot;, and also may be seen as morphisms to the projective line.

==Applications==
Rational functions are used in numerical analysis for interpolation and approximation of functions, for example the Padé approximations introduced by Henri Padé. Approximations in terms of rational functions are well suited for computer algebra systems and other numerical software. Like polynomials, they can be evaluated straightforwardly, and at the same time they express more diverse behavior than polynomials. 

Rational functions are used to approximate or model more complex equations in science and engineering including fields and forces in physics, spectroscopy in analytical chemistry, enzyme kinetics in biochemistry, electronic circuitry, aerodynamics, medicine concentrations in vivo, wave functions for atoms and molecules, optics and photography to improve image resolution, and acoustics and sound.

In signal processing, the Laplace transform (for continuous systems) or the z-transform (for discrete-time systems) of the impulse response of commonly-used linear time-invariant systems (filters) with infinite impulse response are rational functions over complex numbers.

<text>Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape is a 1958 one-act play, in English, by Samuel Beckett. With a cast of one man, it was written for Northern Irish actor Patrick Magee and first titled &quot;Magee monologue&quot;. It was inspired by Beckett&#x27;s experience of listening
to Magee reading extracts from &quot;Molloy&quot; and &quot;From an Abandoned Work&quot; on the BBC Third Programme in December 1957.

It is considered to be among Beckett’s major dramas.

==History==

===First publication===
In a letter to a London bookseller Jake Schwartz on 15 March 1958, Beckett wrote that he had &quot;&#x27;four states, in typescript, with copious notes and dirty corrections, of a short stage monologue I have just written (in English) for Pat Magee. This was composed on the machine from a tangle of old notes, so I have not the MS to offer you.&quot;

According to Ackerley and Gontarski, &quot;It was first published in &quot;Evergreen Review&quot; 2.5 (summer 1958), then in &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape and Embers&quot; (Faber, 1959), and &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape and Other Dramatic Pieces&quot; (Grove, 1960).&quot; Beckett’s own translation of the play into French, La Dernière Bande, was published in &quot;Les Lettres Nouvelles&quot; on 4 March 1959.

The available printed texts must not be taken as definitive. &quot;By the mid-1950s Beckett was already talking and working like a director. In a letter to Rosset&#x27;s editorial assistant, Judith Schmidt, on 11 May 1959, Beckett referred to the &quot;staging&quot; of &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot; as its &#x27;creation&#x27;,&quot; and he made numerous significant changes to the text over the years as he was involved in directing the play.

===Others===
The first German performance, on 28 September 1959, was directed by Walter Henn at Berlin&#x27;s &quot;Schillertheater&quot;, where 10 years later, on 5 October 1969, Samuel Beckett himself staged his text in a most successful performance (with Martin Held as Krapp).
The first American performance, on 14 January 1960, was directed by Alan Schneider and starred Donald Davis.

==Synopsis==

The curtain rises on a &quot;late evening in the future.&quot; Krapp, an old man, is sitting in his den in the dark, lit by a light above his desk. On his desk are a tape recorder and a number of tins containing reels of recorded tape. He reads aloud from a ledger to find a certain tape, but the words alone are not jogging his memory. He takes childish pleasure in saying the word ‘spool’.

The tape dates from the day he turned 39. His recorded voice says that he has just celebrated the occasion alone &quot;at the wine house,&quot; jotting down notes in preparation for the later recording session. &quot;The new light above my table is a great improvement,&quot; states the recorded Krapp, before describing how much he enjoys leaving it to wander off into the darkness so that he may return to the zone of light, identifying it with his essential self.

The voice reports that he has just reviewed an old tape from when he was in his late twenties. It amuses him to comment on his impressions of what he was like in his twenties, and the 69-year-old Krapp joins in the derisory laughter. The young man he was back then is described as idealistic and unrealistic in his expectations.

The voice reviews his last year, talking about sitting on a bench outside the nursing home and waiting for the news that his mother had died. Krapp in the current day is more interested in his younger self&#x27;s use of the rather archaic word &quot;viduity&quot; than the reaction of the voice on the tape to their mother&#x27;s passing. He stops listening to look up the word in a large dictionary. He returns to the tape; at the moment he learns of his mother&#x27;s death, his younger self is in the process of throwing a rubber ball to a dog. He ends up simply leaving the ball with the dog.

The voice starts to describe the revelation he experienced at the end of a pier. Krapp grows impatient when his younger self starts enthusing about this. He fast-forwards to near the end of the tape to escape the onslaught of words, where suddenly the mood has changed and he finds himself in the middle of a description of a romantic liaison between himself and a woman in a punt. Krapp lets it play out and then rewinds the tape to hear the complete episode. 

Afterwards, Krapp loads a fresh tape and begins to recount his year. He is scathing when it comes to his assessment of his thirty-nine-year-old self. He finds he has nothing he wants to record for posterity, save the fact he &quot;revelled in the word &quot;spool&quot;.&quot; He mentions a trip to the park and attending Vespers, where he dozed off and fell off the pew. He also mentions his recent literary disappointments: &quot;seventeen copies sold&quot;, presumably of his last book, eleven of which have gone not to interested readers but to foreign libraries. His sex life has been reduced to periodic visits by an old prostitute. Unlike his younger selves, Krapp has nothing good to say about the man he has become and even the idea of making a &quot;last effort&quot; when it comes to his writing upsets him. 

He retreats into memories from his dim and distant past, gathering holly and walking the dog of a Sunday morning. He then remembers the girl on the punt and wrenches off the tape he has been recording, swapping back to the prior tape and replaying the entire section again. This time he allows the tape to play to the very end, with the thirty-nine-year-old Krapp determinedly not regretting the choices he has made, certain that what he would produce in the years to come would more than compensate him for any potential loss of happiness.

Krapp makes no response to this but allows the tape to play on, silent, until the final curtain.

==Structure==
In &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, Beckett uses aspects of Judeo-Christianity as the template for his play, in &quot;Film&quot; the template is the writings of Bishop Berkeley, and in &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot;, according to Anthony Cronin, he uses Manichaeism as a structural device: The dichotomy of light and dark ... is central to Manichaean doctrine ... Its adherents believed that the world was ruled by evil powers, against which the god of the whole of creation struggled as yet in vain ... Krapp is in violation of the three seals or prohibitions of Manichaeism for the elect: the seal of the hands, forbidding engagement in a profession, the seal of the breast against sexual desire, and the seal of the mouth, which forbids the drinking of wine ... Beckett [however] seems to have known no more about Manichaeism than is contained in the eleventh edition of the Encyclopædia Britannica, which he possessed.

==Analysis==
&quot;Krapp’s spool of life is almost wound, and the silent tape is both the time it has left to run and the silence into which he must pass.&quot; Whereas the younger Krapp talks about the &quot;fire in me&quot; the tired old man who sits listening is simply &quot;burning to be gone.&quot; The title of the play seems obvious, that what we have witnessed is the recording of Krapp’s final tape, &quot;yet there is an ambiguity: &#x27;last&#x27; can mean &#x27;most recent&#x27; as well as &#x27;ultimate&#x27;. The speaker in Browning&#x27;s &quot;My Last Duchess&quot; is already planning to marry his next duchess ... Still, one hopes for Krapp&#x27;s sake that he will be gone before another year is over.&quot;

The ending in which Krapp re-listens to his younger self discuss his romantic encounter is a scene of masochism reminiscent of Croak in &quot;Words and Music&quot;, tormenting himself with an image of a woman’s face.

Black-and-white imagery features heavily throughout the play.

==Characters==
Although there is only one person onstage, there are a number of &#x27;characters&#x27; mentioned throughout. The play is considered to be Beckett at his most autobiographical, and it does draw heavily on biographical detail. He once told the scholar Lawrence Harvey, though, that his &quot;work does not depend on experience – [it is] not a record of experience. Of course you use it.&quot; Beckett takes elements from his own life, his failed love life, his drinking, his – at the time – literary failures and looks where things might have gone. &quot;When, in 1956, Vivian Mercier saw him in Paris, he told him that he felt &#x27;all dried up, with nothing left but self-translation.&#x27;&quot;

;Krapp
Krapp was originally designated simply ‘A’ in the first draft. The first appearance of a title was &quot;a manuscript edition to Typescript 2: &quot;Crapp’s Last Tape&quot;&quot;; the more familiar Germanic spelling came later. The name Krapp with its had been used before by Beckett however. In his first play, &quot;Eleutheria&quot; (unstaged and unpublished during his life), dating back to 1947, the protagonist is Victor Krap, a young man who has decided to retreat from life and do nothing. He has been described as a world-weary anti-hero, a failed writer and seedy solipsist, a clear prototype for the later Krapp. 

;Krapp (as a boy)
When the thirty-nine-year-old Krapp is talking about his neighbour&#x27;s ritual singing in the evening he tries to remember if he sang as a boy and is unable to do so. He does recall attending Vespers but it would be unusual for him to attend Evensong without participating in the singing of the hymn. The sixty-nine-year-old Krapp sings a few lines from the &quot;Now the Day is Over&quot; in early performances of the play but Beckett excised this as being &quot;too clumsily explicit&quot;.

The 39-year-old Krapp looks back on the 20-odd-year-old Krapp with the same level of contempt as the 20-odd-year-old Krapp appears to have displayed for the young man he saw himself for in his late teens. Each can see clearly the fool he was but only time will reveal what kind of fool he has become.

Although no time frame is given, it is likely that sixty-nine-year-old Krapp&#x27;s memories of being &quot;again in the dingle at Christmas Eve, gathering holly ... [or] on Croghan on a Sunday morning, in the haze, with the bitch&quot; alludes to Beckett&#x27;s own childhood familial memories.

;Krapp (in his twenties)
His birth-sign in early drafts is given as Aries, Beckett&#x27;s own. All we learn about Krapp at this age comes from the tape. Like a lot of young men he is full of &quot;aspirations&quot; – his work is starting to take shape – and &quot;resolutions&quot; – he is already aware that his drinking needs to be curbed. He is becoming resigned to the fact that he might well have let true love – represented by the image of a &quot;girl in a shabby green coat, on a railway-station platform&quot; – get away from him. He has settled for an on/off relationship with a &quot;Bianca&quot; but even there his future plans do not feature her. We learn that his problem with constipation has been ongoing since at least this time. He disparages his youth and is glad it is over. The thirty-nine-year-old Krapp estimates that the tape he had been listening to was made some ten or twelve years earlier. If it was twelve then he would have been twenty-seven at the time it was recorded.

;Bianca
&quot;In the earlier drafts the woman with whom the young Krapp lived [later named &quot;Bianca&quot;] was first named &#x27;Alba&#x27; (a character in &quot;Dream of Fair to Middling Women&quot; modelled on Ethna MacCarthy whom he had loved when he was a young man), then &#x27;Celia&#x27; (the name of the green-eyed prostitute with whom Murphy cohabits in &quot;Murphy&quot;), then &#x27;Furry&#x27; (nickname of Anne Rudmose-Brown, the wife of Beckett&#x27;s French Professor at Trinity, who was himself satirised as &#x27;the Polar Bear&#x27; in &quot;Dream of Fair to Middling Women&quot;).&quot;.

He settled on &#x27;Bianca&#x27;, who was most likely based on another lecturer, Bianca Esposito, who (along with Walter Starkie) taught him Italian and cultivated his lifelong passion for Dante. He took private lessons from Signorina Esposito as well. Those lessons at 21 Ely Place were then caricatured in the short story &#x27;Dante and the Lobster&#x27;. Kedar Street is not a real location but an anagram of &#x27;darke&#x27; or Hebrew for &#x27;black&#x27;. Keeping this in mind, the name may simply have been selected because &quot;bianca&quot; means &quot;white woman&quot; in Italian. Little is recorded about her other than &quot;&#x27;a tribute to her eyes. Very warm.&#x27;&quot; Vivian Mercier, who knew Beckett personally, writes: &quot;Although I do not recall his ever using the phrase, Beckett unquestionably regards the eyes as the windows of the soul.&quot;

;Krapp&#x27;s father
Krapp’s father, the only other man mentioned in the play, is spoken of only very briefly. The expression &quot;Last illness&quot; suggests he has not been a well man for some time and dies while Krapp is in his twenties. His own father, William Beckett, died of a heart attack in June 1933, when Beckett was twenty-seven.

;The girl in the green coat
Beckett&#x27;s first love, his cousin, Peggy Sinclair, had &quot;deep green eyes and [had a] passionate love of green clothing.&quot; An allusion to Peggy Sinclair also appears in &quot;Dream of Fair to Middling Women&quot; in Smeraldina, the &quot;little emerald&quot;. Although the relationship is often cited as being a little one-sided, Beckett does recall: &quot;Oh, Peggy didn’t need any chasing.&quot;

;Krapp (aged 39)
This character does the majority of the talking throughout the play. His voice is contained on Tape 5 from Box 3. His voice is strong and rather pompous. He has celebrated his birthday alone in an empty wine house before returning home to consume three bananas. As has become his practice on his birthday he makes a tape looking back at who he was, assessing who he is and anticipating what might be to come. His is as disparaging of the young man he was in his twenties as he was then of the youth he had been thinking about when he made that earlier tape. He records the death of his mother, an epiphany at the end of a pier and an idyllic moment in a punt.

;Old Mrs McGlome
This character is based on Miss Beamish, an eccentric novelist from Connacht whom Beckett had met in Roussillon, while hiding during World War II. &quot;Whether the real Miss Beamish did actually sing regularly every evening is ... debatable. Beckett did not remember this.&quot;

;The dark young beauty
There appears to be no direct correlation between this character and anyone living. The black-and-white imagery is strong here: her white uniform and the &quot;big black hooded perambulator.&quot; Krapp also remembers this woman’s eyes as being &quot;[l]ike ... chrysolite!&quot;

Rosemary Pountney observes Beckett changed &quot;moonstone&quot; to chrysolite, an olive-green coloured mineral, in Typescript 4.

She observes also that Beckett made &quot;a direct connection ... with &quot;Othello&quot;, a play in which dark and light imagery is central,&quot; as &quot;in the margin of the text that he used for the 1973 London production,&quot; on page 15 where the word &#x27;chrysolite&#x27; occurs ... he writes:
If heaven would make me such another world
Of one entire and perfect chrysolite
I’d not have sold her for it
&quot;Othello&quot; V2.

&quot;Like Othello, too,&quot; Pountney continues, &quot;Krapp has lost his love through his own folly.&quot;

;Krapp&#x27;s mother
Beckett’s mother, May, died on 25 August 1950 in the Merrion Nursing Home which overlooked Dublin’s Grand Canal. Beckett had made the trip over in the early summer to be with her. By 24 July medical opinion confirmed that she was dying. During that last long month he used &quot;to walk disconsolately alone along the towpath of the Grand Canal.&quot;

Towards the end she was oblivious to his presence. Her death took place while he was sitting on a bench by the canal. &quot;At a certain point he happened to look up. The blinds of his mother’s window, a dirty red-brown affair, was down. She was dead.&quot; A drawn blind, an old custom signifying death, also makes an appearance in &quot;Rockaby&quot;: &quot;let down the blind and down&quot;.

;The little white dog
When Krapp’s mother died, he was throwing a ball for a little white dog. He says he will keep it forever: &quot;But I gave it away to the dog.&quot; Significantly the ball is black to contrast with the white of the dog. In &quot;All Strange Away&quot; a &quot;small grey punctured rubber ball&quot; is the last object contemplated before Fancy dies. The ball had already appeared in &quot;All That Fall&quot;: Jerry returns &quot;a kind of ball&quot; to Mr. Rooney. Although not an obvious symbol of death, this ball is a significant motif of childhood grief for Beckett though none of his biographers propose that the presence of the dog is anything more than artistic license.

;The girl in the punt
Beckett makes the relationship of this woman to Krapp clear when &quot;[i]n 1975, directing Pierre Chabert in Paris, Beckett said: &#x27;I thought of writing a play on the opposite situation, with &quot;Mrs Krapp, the girl in the punt&quot;, nagging away behind him, in which case his failure and his solitude would be exactly the same.&#x27;&quot; In her biography of Beckett, Deirdre Bair deduces that &quot;the girl in the punt&quot; may be Peggy Sinclair because of the references to &quot;Effi&quot; and to &quot;the Baltic&quot;: in July 1929 Beckett vacationed with the Sinclairs &quot;in one of the smaller resort towns along the Baltic Sea. Summer, traditionally the time for light reading, found Peggy tearfully engrossed in Theodor Fontane&#x27;s novel, &quot;Effi Briest&quot;. Beckett read it too, but with more detachment than Peggy, who wept and suffered as Effi&#x27;s infidelity ended her marriage.&quot; Talking to James Knowlson, a few days before his death, Beckett said that he &quot;did not remember the scene this way, however, denying that girl in the boat ... had anything at all to do with his cousin, Peggy.&quot; Knowlson feels &quot;that there is little doubt the source for the girl with the haunting eyes is Ethna MacCarthy. For, as &quot;Dream of Fair to Middling Women&quot; had made clear ... the &#x27;Alba&#x27;, who, on Beckett’s own admission, was closely modelled on Ethna, had eyes like dark, deep pools.&quot; Beckett left no doubt however when he told Jean Martin, whilst rehearsing the play in 1970, that the girl was modelled on Ethna. On 11 December 1957 Beckett learned that Ethna was terminally ill and regularly wrote uncharacteristically long letters until her death. When he completed the play he wrote her: &quot;I’ve written in English a stage monologue for Pat Magee which I think you will like if no one else.&quot;

At one point in the recollection, the young Krapp leans over the young woman to shade her from the sun. &quot;Let me in,&quot; he says. This caused the Lord Chamberlain some concerns when the play was first presented before him to grant a license. He believed that what was being suggested was a desire for sexual penetration and was not convinced that Beckett was simply alluding to her eyes. It was not until a mere three weeks before the play&#x27;s opening that the objection was dropped. In 1982 Beckett, in response to a similar suggestion from one of James Knowlson&#x27;s postgraduate students, &quot;said with a chuckle, &#x27;Tell her to read her texts more carefully. She&#x27;ll see that Krapp would need to have a penis at an angle of a hundred and eighty degrees to make coitus possible in the position he is in!&#x27;&quot;––a position that Rosette Lamont proposes also &quot;suggests that of a suckling babe.&quot;

;Krapp (aged 69)

Beckett would not be 69 until 1975 so, from his perspective, with Krapp a proxy for him, the action is set in the future. The first line of the play explicitly sets it &#x27;in the future&#x27;, although nothing onstage reveals this. Beckett wrote this play shortly before he turned 52 years old. As it happens, with &quot;Waiting for Godot&quot;, success had found him but, at 39, the future must have seemed a lot bleaker for the writer, the Second World War was ending and all Beckett had had published were a few poems, a collection of short stories and the novel, &quot;Murphy&quot;. Beckett had this to say about the drained old man we see onstage: &quot;Krapp sees very clearly that he’s through with his work, with love and religion.&quot; He told Rick Cluchey, whom he directed in 1977, that Krapp was &quot;in no way senile [but has] something frozen about him [and is] filled up to his teeth with bitterness.&quot; &quot;Habit, the great deadener&quot; has proven more tenacious than inspiration. His &quot;present concerns revolve around the gratification of those very bodily appetites that, earlier, he had resolved should be out of his life. Eating bananas and drinking have become a [daily routine]. Of the physical activities that he once considered excesses only sex has come to play a reduced part in his lonely existence&quot; in the form of periodic visits from an old prostitute.

Although this is a play about memory, the sixty-nine-year-old Krapp himself remembers very little. Virtually all the recollections come from the tape. As evidenced most clearly in the novel &quot;Murphy&quot;, Beckett had a decent understanding of a variety of mental illnesses including Korsakoff&#x27;s Alcoholic Syndrome––&quot;A hypomaniac teaching slosh to a Korsakow&#x27;s syndrome.&quot;––which is characterised by powerful amnesic symptoms accompanied by intestinal obstruction.

In his focus on chronic alcohol consumption, Narinder Kapur explains in &quot;Memory Disorders in Clinical Practice&quot; that it can lead to marked memory loss and generalised cognitive defects, as well as &quot;disorientation for time and also place&quot;. More recent memories are likely to be forgotten than remote memories, for &quot;memory loss shows a temporal gradient with greater sparing of items from earlier years.&quot; Krapp&#x27;s gathering of red-berried holly in the dingle could be an example of the &quot;relatively intact remote memory&quot; that preceded Krapp&#x27;s apparent addiction to alcohol.

Krapp is not a textbook case. He is an individual with his own individual symptomology but he is more than a list of symptoms. Bananas contain pectin, a soluble fibre that can help normalise movement through the digestive tract and ease constipation. Bananas can also aggravate constipation especially in young children. It depends what the root cause of the problem is. They are also high in Vitamins A and C as well as niacin, riboflavin and thiamine and one of the root causes of Korsakoff&#x27;s Syndrome is thiamine deficiency; eating bananas would be good for him. It is easy to get caught up in this kind of over-analysis to the detriment of the play as a whole. &quot;[A]ttempts to demonstrate that Beckett&#x27;s characters conform to specific psychological syndromes so often turn into will-o-the-wisp pursuits. Certainly, Beckett would not deny that psychologists have offered very useful descriptions of mental activity. But their theories are typically no more than initial steps in an understanding of mental processes, fragmented bits of knowledge which should not be taken for universal principles.&quot; It is important to remember that Krapp has not simply forgotten his past but he has consciously and systematically rejected it as one way of reassuring himself that he has made the right decisions in &quot;his yearly word letting.&quot;

;Effi Briest
In the past year Krapp has been re-reading Fontane&#x27;s &quot;Effi Briest&quot;, &quot;a page a day, with tears again,&quot; he says, &quot;Could have been happy with her, up there on the Baltic...&quot; Existing only on the printed page this fantasy woman is perhaps the most black-and-white of all Krapp’s women. Like the girl in the punt and the nursemaid mentioned earlier, perhaps to contrast with his inner fire, &quot;Once again Beckett situates Krapp&#x27;s memory on some side near the water.&quot;

;Fanny
Just as Krapp’s name is a vulgar pun, so is the name Beckett gave to the woman who visits him from time to time, whom he describes as a &quot;bony old ghost of a whore.&quot; As Fanny is an &quot;old ghost,&quot; all Krapp&#x27;s women are figuratively &quot;ghosts, really, dependent for their existence on Krapp&#x27;s bitter-sweet recording of them,&quot; according to Katherine Worth.

&quot;&quot; is a slang British expression for the female genitals – woman reduced to a function. &quot;Fanny&quot; is also a commonly used diminutive of Frances, and Beckett occasionally referred to his aunt, Frances &quot;Cissie&quot; Sinclair, as &quot;Fanny.&quot;

Krapp refers to her visits as &quot;better than a kick in the crutch.&quot; In the 1985 television version, Beckett changed this phrase to &quot;better than the finger and the thumb,&quot; an unambiguous reference to masturbation that would never have escaped the British Lord Chamberlain in the 1950s.

;Krapp&#x27;s &quot;vision at last&quot;, on the pier at Dún Laoghaire
In an earlier draft of the play Beckett &quot;uses &#x27;beacon&#x27; and &#x27;anemometer&#x27; rather than &#x27;lighthouse&#x27; and &#x27;wind-gauge&#x27;. The anemometer on the East Pier of Dún Laoghaire was one of the world&#x27;s first. [It is] widely regarded as a mirror reflection of Beckett&#x27;s own revelation. Yet it is different both in circumstance and kind.&quot;

&quot;Beckett wrote to Richard Ellmann: &#x27;All the jetty and howling wind are imaginary. It happened to me, summer 1945, in my mother&#x27;s little house, named New Place, across the road from Cooldrinagh.&#x27;&quot;

He summarised what this experience signified for him:
I realised that Joyce had gone as far as one could in the direction of knowing more, [being] in control of one&#x27;s material. He was always adding to it; you only have to look at his proofs to see that. I realised that my own way was in impoverishment, in lack of knowledge and in taking away, in subtracting rather than in adding.

;The tape recorder
Beckett has applied character to non-human elements in his plays before, e.g. the light in &quot;Play&quot;, the music in &quot;Words and Music&quot;. &quot;Beckett instructed the actor Pierre Chabert in his 1975 Paris production of the play &#x27;to become as much as possible one body with the machine ... The spool is his whole life.&#x27;&quot; Krapp no longer owns the memories on the tapes. His mind is no longer capable of holding onto them. The recorder also serves as proxy. When John Hurt, as Krapp, is transfixed by the retelling of the events in the punt he literally cradles the machine as if it were the woman, recalling Magee’s original performance; Beckett took pains to point this out to Alan Schneider, who was at the time preparing his own version of the play, in a letter dated 21 November 1958, and incorporated the gesture in future productions in which he was involved.

Later, on 4 January 1960, Beckett wrote a more detailed letter describing another unexpected revelation of that earlier performance, &quot;the beautiful and quite accidental effect in London of the luminous eye burning up as the machine runs on in silence and the light goes down.&quot;

==Notable performances of Krapp==

===Cyril Cusack===
Cyril Cusack played Krapp in a June 1960 production at the Abbey Theatre in Dublin, later at the Empire Theatre in Belfast, Northern Ireland, and in a television production directed by Prudence Fitzgerald and broadcast on 13 November 1963 on the British television program &quot;Festival&quot;.

===David Kelly===
In 1996, the Gate Theatre visited Lincoln Center in New York where David Kelly performed ‘Krapp,’ receiving standing ovations at every performance. Kelly had first performed the play in Dublin in 1959 and the original recordings of his ‘young self’ were discovered. These were painstakingly remastered by Noel Storey at Beacon Studios in Dublin to be used on stage. It is believed to be the only time that real 30 year old recordings have been used. &quot;The New York Times&quot; broke their own rules by saying in their review that &quot;Kelly’s performance is the best that will ever be&quot;.

===Patrick Magee===
The play was first performed as a curtain raiser to &quot;Endgame&quot; (from 28 October to 29 November 1958) at the Royal Court Theatre, London, directed by Donald McWhinnie and starring Patrick Magee. It ran for 38 performances. This production was recreated for television in 1972, again directed by McWhinnie and starring Magee.

Beckett told Magee, the original Krapp, that his &quot;voice was the one which he heard inside his mind. Thus it seems likely that the return to English was a matter of expediency because of the English-speaking actor.&quot;

Magee had a harsh, gravely voice which had little superficial charm but had a hypnotic effect on the listener ... He was grey-haired but ageless and could combine debility with menace, as Beckett characters with their suppressed violence often do ... [H]e had developed a rather strange accent with only faint Irish overtones and prolonged vowel sounds, The general effect was strangely déclassé but still indubitably Irish and thus ideally fitted for the performance of Beckett ... As an actor, he had the good sense to see that one played Beckett for the weight and mood of the words and the situation without bothering about the ultimate philosophical import.

===Donald Davis===
The Canadian actor Donald Davis played Krapp in the North American premiere production of &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot; at the Provincetown Playhouse, with Davis winning an Obie Award in 1960 for his performance in the play &quot;as the lonely, solitary Krapp, playing the tapes of his life and re-experiencing decades of regret.&quot; Later, &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape,&quot; directed by Alan Schneider, was a long-running performance at the Provincetown Playhouse, for which a 33 RPM recording was issued (see article and liner notes). He later re-created the role in October 1968 at the Billy Rose Theatre in New York City again directed by Alan Schneider.

===Jack MacGowran===
In 1971, Alan Schneider directed Jack MacGowran in a videotaped production that was meant to be broadcast on WNET, but for some reason was rejected and never shown and &quot;languished in a closet&quot; until found in 1988 and painstakingly restored.

===Hume Cronyn===
Hume Cronyn played the role of Krapp November 22 - December 17, 1972 at the Mitzi E. Newhouse Theater in New York City as part of the &quot;Samuel Beckett Festival&quot; in a program directed by Alan Schneider which also included the World Premiere of &quot;Not I&quot; (starring Jessica Tandy), &quot;Happy Days&quot; (with both Tandy and Cronyn) and &quot;Act Without Words I&quot; (performed by Cronyn).

===Rick Cluchey===
Co-Founder of the San Quentin Drama Workshop, was directed by Beckett in 1977 in Berlin and later videotaped in 1988 as part of the &quot;Beckett Directs Beckett&quot; collection (again directed by Beckett with Walter Asmus). He played the role again, directed by Beckett, off-Broadway at the Samuel Beckett Theatre August 27 - November 30, 1986.

===Max Wall===
Max Wall performed Krapp on a number of occasions, including London&#x27;s Greenwich Theatre (1975 – directed by Patrick Magee) and Riverside Studios (1986).

===John Hurt===
John Hurt performed the role of Krapp for the version directed by Atom Egoyan for the &quot;Beckett on Film&quot; project, which was broadcast on television in 2001 and available on DVD in the box set or individually. Before that there was a production at the Ambassadors Theatre, London from 25 January to 11 March 2000. In November 2011, directed by Michael Colgan, he reprised the role pre-Broadway at the Shakespeare Theatre Company in Washington DC followed by a limited Broadway run. He used the tape recordings from the 2001 production in the performance. In December 2011, again directed by Colgan, he reprised the role at the Brooklyn Academy of Music in New York City as part of the BAM 2011 Next Wave Festival. He once again took up the role in Dublin&#x27;s Gate Theatre for 10 performances in March 2013. Charles McNulty lauded it as a &quot;magnificent rendition&quot;.

===Harold Pinter===

As part of the 50th anniversary season of the Royal Court Theatre, in October 2006, directed by Ian Rickson, English playwright Harold Pinter performed the role of Krapp in a sold-out limited run of nine performances to great critical acclaim; a performance of this production was broadcast on BBC Four. In this production, Krapp is confined to a motorized wheelchair and the banana business at the beginning is cut; Krapp also uses two tape machines, one to listen to his past recording and the other to record his new tape.

===Corin Redgrave===
Corin Redgrave performed the role of Krapp for BBC Radio 3 in 2006 a few months after he had suffered a major heart attack. The production was rebroadcast on BBC Radio 3 on 16 May 2010 as part of a double bill with a 2006 production of &quot;Embers&quot;.

===Brian Dennehy===
Brian Dennehy performed the role of Krapp during the 2008 Stratford Shakespeare Festival, in 2010 at the Goodman Theatre of Chicago from 16 January through 28 February and in 2011 at the Long Wharf Theatre of New Haven, all three times directed by Jennifer Tarver. The Beckett one-act was paired in Stratford and Chicago with Eugene O&#x27;Neill&#x27;s &quot;Hughie&quot; (directed by Robert Falls), also a one-act, and also performed by Dennehy, in the lead role of &quot;Erie Smith&quot;. A Broadway run was also planned, but not realized. Dennehy&#x27;s double bill of &quot;Hughie/Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot; was performed at the Geffen Playhouse in Los Angeles, this time directed by Steven Robman, from 5 November – 16 December 2018.

===Michael Gambon===
In April 2010 Irish actor Michael Gambon continued his relationship with both Beckett and the Gate Theatre when he returned to the Dublin stage as Krapp for a limited run which was followed by a transfer to London&#x27;s West End.

===Richard Bremmer===
Richard Bremmer took on the eponymous role of Krapp at the Bristol Old Vic between April and May 2012, receiving critical acclaim across the board. This was in a double bill with A Kind of Alaska by Harold Pinter in which Bremmer also appeared. They were both directed by Simon Godwin.

===Gerard Murphy===
In 2012, at Glasgow&#x27;s Citizens Theatre, Gerard Murphy performed the role, even though he was suffering spinal cord compression due to prostate cancer.

===Robert Wilson===
Robert Wilson performed Krapp at the Barbican, London, in June 2015. He also performed &quot;Krapp&quot; at the Ardhowen Theatre in Enniskillen, Northern Ireland in August 2012 (directing himself), at the Alexander Kasser Theater on the campus of Montclair State University in March 2016 and at the Akademie der Künste in Berlin in 2019 (which he also directed). In January 2018, he performed Krapp in the Santiago a Mil International Festival in Santiago de Chile, which he also directed (co-director Charles Chemin).

===Joe Gistirak===
Joe Gistirak played Krapp at the Above Board Theatre in 1978. It was directed by Michael Corrigan.

===Bob Nasmith===
In 2018, Bob Nasmith played Krapp to mark the 50th anniversary of the opening of Theatre Passe Muraille in a production directed by Mac Fyfe.

===James Hayes===
James Hayes played Krapp in a 2020 production directed by Trevor Nunn at the Jermyn Street Theatre in a double bill with &quot;The Old Tune&quot; (adapted by Beckett from a radio play by Robert Pinget).

===Stephen Rea===
Stephen Rea played Krapp in a production directed by Vicky Featherstone for Landmark Productions at Dublin&#x27;s Gaiety Theatre in October 2024. The production then moved to Dublin&#x27;s Project Arts Centre later that month. In February–March 2025 the production plays at the Dunstan Playhouse at the Adelaide Festival Centre in Adelaide, South Australia, then at the Barbican Theatre in London in April–May.

===F. Murray Abraham===
F. Murray Abraham plays Krapp in a new production at New York City&#x27;s Irish Repertory Theatre 15 January - 09 March 2025. The play is part of &quot;Beckett Briefs: From the Cradle Through the Grave&quot;, a collection of three Beckett one-act plays.

===Gary Oldman===
Gary Oldman will play Krapp in a new production at York Theatre Royal (the theatre in which Oldman made his professional acting debut in 1979) early in 2025. The play will run from 14 April to 17 May 2025.

==Reception==
&quot;Krapp’s Last Tape&quot; is one of Beckett’s most frequently performed dramas and has been referred to as &quot;one of his most personal works&quot;. Daniel Sack considers the part of Krapp to be &quot;one of the greatest in the English language.&quot;

==Media recordings==
Beckett opposed vehemently the transfer of some of his works from one medium to another, but he did not oppose such recordings of &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot; as much as he did others. For example, &quot;A gramophone recording (New York: Spoken Arts #788, 1960), based on the original American production, was distributed by Argo (RG 220), and by HEAR, Home Educational Records, London (1964),&quot;(this recording starred Donald Davis) and &quot;It was often adapted for television with his encouragement.&quot; The first BBC version was produced by Peter Luke, featuring Cyril Cusack (13 November 1963). Approached by Westdeutscher Rundfunk, Cologne, to permit a television version of his 1969 Schiller-Theatre &quot;Das letzte Band&quot; [the German title of the play], Beckett wrote a set of &quot;Suggestions for TV Krapp&quot;, which &quot;was broadcast [on] 28th October 1969.&quot;

The play has subsequently been broadcast on radio, turned into an opera (see below) and filmed as part of the Beckett on Film project and for the DVD of Pinter&#x27;s Royal Court performance, both of which have been shown on television.

==Musical adaptations==

There have been several musical adaptations of &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot;, most notably the opera &quot;Krapp, ou, La dernière bande&quot; by composer Marcel Mihalovici. American composer Earl Kim alludes to the work within his &quot;Gooseberries, she said&quot; (1967), part of the four-part cycle &quot;Exercises en Route&quot;. The Hungarian composer Gyula Csapó has created the work &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape –- after Samuel Beckett&quot; (1975) loosely inspired by Beckett&#x27;s play. This theatrical work is for a &quot;violinist-actor,&quot; a tape recorder, four spotlights and a sine wave generator. In 1999, the English experimental composer, Michael Parsons, adapted &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot; for piano, two pre-recorded pianos, and voice on tape. The piece, specifically written for John Tilbury, was called &quot;Krapp Music&quot;.

==Allusions in popular culture==
The play was memorably parodied in the television sketch comedy &quot;The Fast Show&quot;, in which – as a reference to Max Wall – fictional music hall comedian Arthur Atkinson played a comically more stoic version of Krapp. It is also the title of a track on Fredrik Thordendal&#x27;s solo album Sol Niger Within.
A prefiguring of the play, titled, &quot;Krapp, 39&quot; written and performed by Michael Laurence and directed by George Demas, premiered at the 2008 New York International Fringe Festival and begins its commercial run Off Broadway at The Soho Playhouse in New York City on 13 January 2009. The piece follows an actor&#x27;s obsession with the character Krapp. In the 2013 Canadian film &quot;Meetings with a Young Poet&quot;, the character of Lucia Martell wants the rights to the piece to transform it into a one-woman play as a vehicle for herself.

The play is mentioned in Charlie Kaufman&#x27;s 2008 film &quot;Synecdoche, New York&quot; and in Spalding Gray&#x27;s &quot;A Personal History of the American Theatre&quot;, a 1985 monologue directed for television by Skip Blumberg.

<doc id="361213" wikidata="Q7500603" url="?curid=361213" title="Shooting Stars (1993 TV series)">
<text>Shooting Stars is a British television comedy panel game broadcast on BBC Two as a pilot in 1993, then as three full series from 1995 to 1997, then on BBC Choice from January to December 2002 with two series before returning to BBC Two for another three series from 2008 until its cancellation in 2011. Created and hosted by double-act Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer, it uses the panel show format but with the comedians&#x27; often slapstick, surreal and anarchic humour that does not rely on rules in order to function, with the pair apparently ignoring existing rules or inventing new ones as and when the mood takes them.

==Format==
The basic format of the show is that of a conventional panel game. Hosts Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer ask questions of the two teams with points awarded for &quot;correct&quot; answers; however, scoring is largely arbitrary. Each episode is produced by editing together excerpts of a longer session. Rounds include &quot;true or false&quot;, the film clip round, the impressions round, and &quot;The Dove from Above&quot;. In the impressions round, contestants have to guess what song Reeves is singing (incomprehensibly) in the style of an incoherent nightclub singer.

===The Dove From Above===
&quot;The Dove from Above&quot; is a large prop animal suspended above the contestants merely for the purpose of bearing six key words for further questions. Guests would be prompted to &quot;coo&quot; down the dove. Alternatives to the dove in various series included &quot;The Blue Suitcase&quot; in the pilot, &quot;The Crow from Below&quot;, &quot;The Vest from the West&quot;, Matt Lucas as &quot;George Dawes from the Upper Floors,&quot; &quot;The Wonderful, Wonderful Car&quot;, &quot;Donald Cox – The Sweaty Fox,&quot; &quot;The Fly from Upon High&quot; and &quot;The Beast from the East.&quot;

In the &quot;Dove from Above&quot; round and subsequent versions of the round, if a contestant answers incorrectly, Vic says &quot;UVAVU&quot; and pulls a silly face. If the contestant chooses a certain, prize-winning option, he pulls another face and says &quot;ERANU&quot; . The prize is invariably a bizarre and practically useless device.

Occasionally, there would be a &quot;Maverick Round&quot; where a guest would have to stand centre stage and represent something &quot;via the medium of dance&quot;, or &quot;the gift of the air guitar&quot;. They would then be judged by scorekeeper George Dawes (Lulubabsi), who would invariably award them no points.

Reeves would often tell a joke, much to everyone&#x27;s disappointment. The joke would always fall flat, often accompanied by tumbleweed blowing across the floor of the studio. Occasionally, someone else would tell the joke and would be met with uproarious laughter, much to Reeves&#x27; anger.

===Impressions round===
The impressions round saw a &quot;random light&quot; pick a contestant at random, and then they had to do an impression of a celebrity. In the pilot this was called by Reeves, &quot;random factor&quot;. Other elements of the impressions round included the aforementioned club style singing.
George Dawes played the drums while Reeves did this.

===Film clip round===
The film clip round always included a clip that was related to the question, but the answer to the question was never shown in the film just like the lyrics of George Dawes&#x27; songs, despite Bob Mortimer as a running gag saying to watch or listen carefully. In one episode, Mark Lamarr&#x27;s team were shown a clip from &quot;Citizen Smith&quot; (instead of a comedy clip created by the Shooting Stars team), and were totally unaware the question would relate directly to the clip. A serious question was asked requesting what a man&#x27;s T-shirt read, only for Mark to make something up and then Vic saying his traditional &quot;UVAVU!&quot; wrong answer catchphrase. One of the most memorable film clips was a spoof of &quot;The Naked Chef&quot;, with Matt Lucas playing the part of Jamie Oliver, and Ulrika Jonsson playing the part of his then wife-to-be Juliette Norton. In the sketch, Lucas plays on highlighting Jamie&#x27;s then constant use of the word pukka, constantly using the word while making sandwiches for a party in which he has invited his friends along (which he often used to do on his show, including the Sainsbury&#x27;s adverts). He keeps saying that he&#x27;ll use something later which he has discarded such as an eggshell, while Juliette twice appears asking if he would like any help, only to be turned away. At the end of the film clip, he throws a lot of chips in his motorcycle crash helmet.
===Final round===
Whichever teams &quot;wins&quot; the round according to the scoring system &quot;wins&quot; £1 per point, and the captain must nominate a teammate to do a silly stunt for an alleged £5 per point. This is a timed round, often marked by Vic or Bob stating, &quot;We don&#x27;t know how much time we have, but when the time is up, you&#x27;ll hear this sound,&quot; prompting George to say a silly phrase such as &quot;Come on, come on! Clear it up, woman!&quot; The credits then roll after this round as Vic and Bob sing their goodbyes.

===Humour===
The title of the show is a pun on the fact that much of the humour is at the expense of the guest stars. To prove this point, in the pilot episode at the opening song (singing &quot;let&#x27;s start Shooting Stars&quot;), Vic and Bob are holding shotguns and fire these into the stars.

==Participants==
There are two teams – Team A and Team B. Each team has a regular team captain – originally Mark Lamarr and Ulrika Jonsson – and two celebrity guests on each team. Lamarr left the series in 1997 as he disliked being in too many quiz shows at once (at the time he was hosting &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;), and was replaced by novelist Will Self when the series returned in 2002. At the same time comedian Johnny Vegas was brought in as a regular guest on Jonsson&#x27;s team, where he had a pint of Guinness on his desk where all the other contestants had water. Self was replaced by Jack Dee for the 2008 15th Anniversary Special and for the 2009 series, which also saw Lucas&#x27; character, George Dawes, replaced by Angelos Epithemiou, a creation of comedian Dan Renton Skinner. Contestants are often addressed by their surnames, in reference to &quot;University Challenge&quot;.

In addition to the &#x27;regulars&#x27;, the panel consisted of other celebrities from music, sports, politics and other fields. Some of the most memorable episodes included members who were clearly unaware of the format; on one particularly famous episode, &quot;Dallas&quot; star Larry Hagman appeared on the show and was in a state of constant bemusement. Writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Nancy Banks-Smith described him as looking &quot;like a man in a nightmare&quot;.

Until the 2010 series, the &quot;score&quot; was kept by George Dawes, an overgrown, ranting, drumming baby played by comedian Matt Lucas (occasionally, George&#x27;s mother Marjorie – also played by Lucas – appears instead. She also appears in &quot;Little Britain&quot;). His arrival at the start of the show would be accompanied by the words, &quot;He&#x27;s a baby!&quot; sung to the tune of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Black Dog&quot;. He would also provide a sound effect to signal the end of timed rounds: in earlier series this was a simple scream, but later became random phrases (&quot;Leakage&quot;), sometimes in regional accents (&quot;That&#x27;s it; I&#x27;m turning the car around and we&#x27;re going back to Dorset!&quot;), or advertising slogans (&quot;Have you ever been to a Harvester before?&quot;). In the later series he would also perform &quot;George&#x27;s Song,&quot; on which subject questions would follow. These included &quot;Lesbians&quot;, &quot;Everybody&#x27;s Talkin&#x27; About Football&quot;, &quot;Hip Hop Is The Best&quot;, &quot;1942&quot; (appeared in the 15-year special, while being a song about inventions such as floors, trees, shoes and the &#x27;flu) and even a rendition of the &quot;Rentaghost&quot; theme song. One of the most famous songs is &quot;Peanuts&quot;, with George shouting &quot;Peanuts!&quot; every so often to a backing track, while corpsing. The costume Lucas wore for this performance later became an inspiration for his &quot;Little Britain&quot; character Andy. Another notable song was &quot;Thank You Baked Potato&quot;, in which a potato gave him helpful advice. Lucas later used a revised version of this song in a fundraising effort for the National Health Service, during the 2020 COVID-19 pandemic.

Lucas quit the programme in the 2010 series due to scheduling conflicts with his other projects, and the role of scorekeeper was taken over by Epithemiou.

==Most appearances==
Apart from the Team Captains, Johnny Vegas made the most appearances with 19 as he was a permanent panellist on Ulrika&#x27;s team during the 2002 series. Carol Vorderman made a total of 3 appearances and Jarvis Cocker, Stephen Fry, Zoe Ball, Les Dennis and Sara Cox each made two appearances (although Fry made a short appearance in the 2002 Christmas special). Martin Clunes and Robbie Williams both made two appearances as a panellist, once on Series One and once on video exclusive Unviewed and Nude, Clunes was also featured as a &quot;mystery celebrity&quot; in series two.

==Merchandise==
*In November 1996 the first &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; VHS was released entitled &quot;Shooting Stars - Unviewed and Nude&quot;.
*1996 saw the release of the &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; book and CD game. Published by BBC Books in hard cover, this 120-page book retailed at £9.99, and featured various rounds from the shows, as well as a 45-minute CD of the Club Singer round, allowing you to play a full game of &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; in your own home.
*In March 1999 the second &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; VHS was released as a double VHS along with the first one. It was called &quot;Shooting Stars - Unviewed And Nude &amp; Unpicked And Plucked&quot;.
*In November 2009, the first &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; DVD was released, containing the complete series 6. The complete seventh series was released on DVD the following year.

==Relaunch==
An anniversary edition entitled &quot;All New Shooting Stars&quot; was shown on 30 December 2008, celebrating the 15th anniversary of the show. Ulrika Jonsson returned as captain, with Jack Dee as the replacement team captain. Matt Lucas also reprised his George Dawes character for the episode. Guests for the episode were Peter Jones, Kate Garraway, Christine Walkden, and Dizzee Rascal.

On 3 April 2009, it was announced that the show would return for a full sixth series. Most of the original cast returned along with Jack Dee, who continued as a permanent team captain after his appearance on the anniversary special. It began on BBC Two and BBC HD on 26 August 2009.

The relaunched series altered the format in a number of ways:

* There are now only three rounds; a general round, the Dove from Above round, and the quick-fire round. The first general round usually contains &quot;true or false&quot; questions, but contains other questions as well, including a regular &quot;Who is Hitler&quot; question in which the contestants must identify which celebrity has been disguised as Adolf Hitler.
* The Dove from Above has only four categories, meaning that all are exhausted in every show. The rules for &quot;Eranu&quot; and &quot;Uvavu&quot; are still read out (usually with the final -u extended into a reference or comedy phrase), but these phrases are not actually used during the round, and no &quot;hidden special prizes&quot; are ever awarded in spite of Vic saying that they exist and every category of the Dove being used in every show. The phrases, and the references to a special prize, are finally dropped entirely in the last two episodes.
* The four categories of the Dove always correspond to classic theme skits: one is always &quot;George&#x27;s Song&quot;, another is always &quot;a song in the club style&quot;, and another is always either a spoof video clip or a performance by the &quot;Hartlepool Film Re-enactment Society&quot; in which Vic and Bob use a wendy house and dolls on the end of sticks to play out a skit featuring characters from a well-known film.
* Other regular skits integrated into the show include a conversation with kebab van owner &quot;Angelos Epithemiou&quot; (actually comedian Renton Skinner), and an attempt to &quot;cheer up Jack Dee&quot; by playing him a song using drain pipes.
* The prize awarded for the final game, rather than being surreal, is instead laughably small: examples include &quot;a cassette of Reggae&quot;, &quot;a can of tropical drink&quot;, and &quot;this wonderful toothpick holder&quot;. There was also an occasion where a video of an exotic destination was shown on a screen only for the prize to be able to see the remainder of that video.

&quot;Shooting Stars&quot; returned in July 2010 for a seventh series. This series made the following further changes:

* Following Matt Lucas&#x27;s decision to leave the programme, Angelos Epithemiou became the scorekeeper. His entrance music is Shaggy&#x27;s &quot;Boombastic&quot;; rather than George Dawes&#x27; drum kit, he keeps the scores from behind his &quot;Dream Machine&quot;, a combination of a DJ station and a pound shop. It still includes a miniature electronic drum kit which he uses to accompany Vic&#x27;s &quot;songs in the club style&quot;. Angelos always plays a short burst of music (an excerpt from &quot;Drop The Pressure (Jack Beats &#x27;Rinsed Out Rave&#x27; Remix)&quot; by Project Bassline) before announcing the first round&#x27;s scores, and brings in a plastic bag, the contents of which are revealed between rounds during the show.
* There are now four rounds: the opening general round, the &quot;clip round&quot; (which has only one question, opened to both teams, on the presented clip), the Dove from Above and the quick-fire round. The video clips (and the &quot;Hartlepool re-enactments&quot;) are removed from the Dove round and replaced by &quot;celebrity questions&quot;, in which a question is asked in a video clip by Vic or Bob while dressed up as another celebrity.
* &quot;George&#x27;s Song&quot; - as one of the options on the Dove - is replaced by &quot;Angelos Epithemou&#x27;s Variety Showcase&quot; in which Angelos performs a short skit, often involving dancing or a parody of a magic show. Spoof magic tricks appear frequently elsewhere in this series, including a regular routine with a magic box at the beginning of each show (although many of the tricks are obviously done by camera cuts or editing).
* Ulrika is introduced by the singing of a spoof song to the melody of &quot;Agadoo&quot;.
* In at least one round, an unoccupied pair of trousers will &quot;walk&quot; unattended across the studio. This is completely ignored by everyone else. In one episode, this is replaced by a taxidermy Great Dane which quietly drifts up behind one of the contestants&#x27; podiums.
* &quot;Shooting Stars&quot; returned for an eighth series on 8 August 2011. It now featured Archie Andrews, a puppet who walks and &quot;hands&quot; the question to the contestant on the left of Ulrika.
* It was announced by Bob Mortimer on 15 November 2011 that the BBC had cancelled further series of the show. The BBC have confirmed that the show has been axed.

<doc id="361214" wikidata="Q7370885" url="?curid=361214" title="Rough for Theatre II">
<text>Rough for Theatre II (also known simply as Theatre II) is a short play by Samuel Beckett. &quot;Although this discarded piece of theatre is dated &#x27;circa 1960&#x27; in &quot;End and Odds&quot;, a manuscript from two years earlier exists in Trinity College, Dublin, Library. This situates a first version, written in French [as &quot;Fragment de théâtre II&quot;] and different from that eventually published in 1976 as between the English plays &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot; and &quot;Embers&quot;.&quot; It is rarely produced.

==Synopsis==
Two bureaucrats, Bertrand (A) and then Morvan (B) enter a sixth floor apartment where they find Croker (C) standing centre stage in front of an open window with his back to the audience, clearly on the point of throwing himself out of it. They are there to carry out a &quot;pro bono&quot; investigation into &quot;the temperament, character and past life of this potential suicide.&quot;

A and B continue, in an almost comic fashion, with the desk lamps flickering on and off, and with a didactic analysis from B of the recounts he carries in his folder. In the end, the pair condemn Croker to jump. When A goes to the window to inspect Croker, however, he is surprised by something inexplicable that causes him to remove his handkerchief and bring it timidly to the would-be jumper&#x27;s face. The ending is left open to various interpretations such as Croker may be crying, smiling, was dead prior to A and B&#x27;s arrival or else died during the process.

<doc id="361216" wikidata="Q319436" url="?curid=361216" title="Bird ringing">
<text>Bird ringing (UK) or bird banding (US) is the attachment of a small, individually numbered metal or plastic tag to the leg or wing of a wild bird to enable individual identification. This helps in keeping track of the movements of the bird and its life history. It is common to take measurements and examine the conditions of feather moult, subcutaneous fat, age indications and sex during capture for ringing. The subsequent recapture, recovery, or observation of the bird can provide information on migration, longevity, mortality, population, territoriality, feeding behaviour, and other aspects that are studied by ornithologists. Other methods of marking birds may also be used to allow for field based identification that does not require capture.

== History ==
The earliest recorded attempts to mark birds were made by Roman soldiers. For instance during the Punic Wars in 218 BC a crow was released by a besieged garrison, which suggests that this was an established practice. Quintus Fabius Pictor used a thread on the bird&#x27;s leg to send a message back. In another case in history, a knight interested in chariot races during the time of Pliny (AD 1) took crows to Volterra, away and released the crows with information on the race winners.

Falconers in the Middle Ages fitted tags on their falcons with seals of their owners. In England from around 1560 or so, swans were marked with a &quot;swan mark&quot;, a nick on the bill.

Storks injured by hunting arrows (termed as &quot;pfeilstorch&quot; in German) traceable to African tribes were found in Germany and elsewhere as early as 1822, and constituted some of the earliest definitive evidence of long-distance migration in European birds.

In North America John James Audubon and Ernest Thompson Seton were pioneers although their method of marking birds was different from modern ringing. To determine if the same birds returned to his farm, Audubon tied silver threads onto the legs of young eastern phoebes in 1805, although the veracity of Audubon&#x27;s dates and methods has been questioned, while Seton marked snow buntings in Manitoba with ink in 1882. Ringing of birds for more extensive scientific purposes was started in 1899 by Hans Christian Cornelius Mortensen, a Danish schoolteacher, using aluminium rings on European starlings. Mortensen had tried using zinc rings as early as 1890 but found these were too heavy. The first ringing scheme was established in Germany by Johannes Thienemann in 1903 at the Rossitten Bird Observatory on the Baltic Coast of East Prussia. This was followed by Hungary in 1908, Great Britain in 1909 (by Arthur Landsborough Thomson in Aberdeen and Harry Witherby in England), Yugoslavia in 1910 and the Scandinavian countries between 1911 and 1914. Paul Bartsch of the Smithsonian Institution is credited with the first modern banding in the U.S.: he banded 23 black-crowned night herons in 1902. Leon J. Cole of the University of Wisconsin founded the American Bird Banding Association in 1909; this organisation oversaw banding until the establishment of federal programs in the U.S. (1920) and Canada (1923) pursuant to the Migratory Bird Treaty of 1918.

== Terminology and techniques ==

&quot;Bird ringing&quot; is the term used in the UK and in some other parts of Europe and the world. &quot;Bird banding&quot; is the term used in the United States. Organised ringing efforts are called ringing or banding schemes, and the organisations that run them are ringing or banding authorities. Birds are &quot;ringed&quot; rather than &quot;rung&quot;. Those who ring or band birds are known as ringers or banders, and they are typically active at ringing or banding stations.

Birds may be captured by being taken as young birds at the nest, or as adults, captured in fine mist nets, baited traps, Heligoland traps, drag nets, cannon nets, or by other methods. Raptors may be caught by many methods, including bal-chatri traps.

When a bird is caught, a ring of suitable size (usually made of aluminium or other lightweight material) is attached to the bird&#x27;s leg, has a unique number, and a contact address. The bird is often weighed and measured, examined for data relevant to the ringer&#x27;s project, and then released. The rings are very light, and are designed to have no adverse effect on the birds – indeed, the whole basis of using ringing to gain data about the birds is that ringed birds should behave in all respects in the same way as the unringed population. The birds so tagged can then be identified when they are re-trapped, or found dead, later.

When a ringed bird is found, and the ring number read and reported back to the ringer or ringing authority, this is termed a &quot;ringing recovery&quot; or a &quot;control&quot;. The finder can contact the address on the ring, give the unique number, and be told the known history of the bird&#x27;s movements. Many national ringing/banding authorities now also accept reports by phone or on official web sites.

The organising body, by collating many such reports, can then determine patterns of bird movements for large populations. Non-ringing/banding scientists can also obtain data for use in bird-related research.

At times in North America, the bands have just a unique number (without an address) that is recorded along with other identifying information on the bird. If the bird is recaptured the number on the band is recorded (along with other identifying characteristics) as a &quot;retrap&quot;. All band numbers and information on the individual birds are then entered into a database and the information often shared throughout North American banding operations. This way information on retrapped birds is more readily available and easy to access.

== Equipment used ==
=== Mist nets ===

Mist nets are fine mesh nets with shelves that create pockets to temporarily restrain birds. Mist nets come in a variety of mesh sizes, heights, lengths, weights, materials, and colours. The mesh size of the net is calculated differently in different countries; in the US and Canada the given mesh size is equivalent to two sides of a mesh square, while in the UK it is equivalent to one side. Ringers must choose a mesh size that appropriately targets the desired species, with smaller birds requiring a smaller mesh size. Nets can range from 1.5 to 18 metres in length, and from 1 to 3 metres in height depending on the number of panels. The thread weight and ply (number of strands) can also vary. Common construction materials include nylon, polyester, and monofilament. Mist nets are typically black, but may also be shades of green or brown. While mist nets are capable of capturing a large variety of species, they require supervised training in order to use properly, and they must be checked frequently while they are deployed.

=== Ringing pliers ===
Ringing pliers are an essential tool that aid in placing the ring around a bird&#x27;s leg. These pliers come in different sizes, determined by how wide a bird&#x27;s leg is. Pliers are sized between 0A-1A, 2–3, and 3B, 3A, and 4.

=== Leg gauge ===
The ring size is determined by using a leg gauge. This is placed around the bird&#x27;s leg, which determines the diameter of the leg. After identifying the size of ring needed, the ring is then placed around the leg using the ringing pliers. In Australia, ring sizes range from 1 to 15, plus special sizes for birds whose leg shapes require special rings, such as parrots and pelicans.

=== Wing rulers ===

The next essential piece of equipment is the wing ruler, which is used to determine the length of the wing for data collection, research purposes, or species determination. Some birds can be identified by their wing chord.

=== Digital scales ===
Once the processing of the bird&#x27;s morphology has been completed, the last piece of equipment used is a digital scale. This is used to determine the weight of the bird, and is the last step before releasing the bird.

== Limitations ==

Certain bird species are for various reasons unsuitable for ringing. In some countries, such as Australia, there exist laws prohibiting ringing of such species.

Some very large birds, such as ratites, are difficult to ring because the cost of making a ring which is capable of securely fitting their strong, heavy legs is prohibitive. At the other extreme, the smaller species of river and tree kingfishers, todies and certain lories, have such narrow tarsi that a ring placed around the bird&#x27;s foot may impose danger to blood circulation. For some gamebirds, such as the Indian peafowl, spurs on the legs interfere with the rings, which thus can cause injury to the birds.

Special rings are needed for long-lived seabirds, such as Manx shearwaters, which can live for over 50 years. The corrosive effects of sea water, combined with wear, result in traditional aluminium rings only lasting around 4 years; for these birds, much tougher and more corrosion-resistant incoloy, monel, or stainless steel alloy rings are now used.

Many species of cockatoo, which even if able to be ringed, require special rings to fit the unique shape of their legs. With softer metals like aluminium, they can bite off the rings with their powerful bills; tougher alloys also need to be used for these rings. The ability to overcome this problem varies between species, and with some such as the Gang-gang cockatoo, it is known to be too dangerous to attempt banding. New World vultures also cannot be banded on their legs because they urinate onto their legs, causing corrosion of the bands into a powdery oxide that sticks to the vulture&#x27;s leg and injures the bird. Dippers are also dangerously handicapped by ringing because the rings induce drag that makes it extremely difficult for them to catch prey in fast-flowing water.

Among species which can be safely ringed, there are major limitations among nomadic species of the deserts of the Eastern Hemisphere and cardueline finches of the taiga. The highly unpredictable movements inherent in these species&#x27; lifestyles means that recovery rates are extremely low, especially given generally low population densities within their habitats.

== Similar schemes ==

=== Neck rings ===

Most waterfowl are leg ringed, but some are marked with a plastic neck collar, which can be read at a greater distance. Neck collars can also be used for other long-necked birds such as flamingos.

=== Wing tags ===

In some surveys, involving larger birds such as eagles, brightly coloured plastic tags are attached to birds&#x27; wing feathers. Each has a letter or letters, and the combination of colour and letters uniquely identifies the bird. These can then be read in the field, through binoculars, meaning that there is no need to re-trap the birds. Because the tags are attached to feathers, they drop off when the bird moults.

Another method is imping in a brightly coloured false feather instead of a natural feather.

A &quot;patagial tag&quot; is a permanent tag held onto the wing by a rivet punched through the patagium.

Wing tags can be a problem for some smaller raptors like harriers as their conspicuous nature makes them more obvious targets for other more powerful predators like peregrine falcons.

=== Radio transmitters and satellite-tracking ===

Where detailed information is needed on individual movements, tiny radio transmitters can be fitted on to birds. For small species the transmitter is carried as a &#x27;backpack&#x27; fitted over the wing bases, and for larger species it may be attached to a tail feather or looped to the legs. Both types usually have a tiny (10 cm) flexible aerial to improve signal reception. Two field receivers (reading distance and direction) are needed to establish the bird&#x27;s position using triangulation from the ground. The technique is useful for tracing individuals during landscape-level movements particularly in dense vegetation (such as tropical forests) and for shy or difficult-to-spot species, because birds can be located from a distance without visual confirmation.

The use of satellite transmitters for bird movements is currently restricted by transmitter size – to species larger than about 400g. They may be attached to migratory birds (geese, swans, cranes, penguins etc.) or other species such as penguins that undertake long-distance movements. Individuals may be tracked by satellites for immense distances, for the lifetime of the transmitter battery. As with wing tags, the transmitters may be designed to drop off when the bird moults; or they may be recovered by recapturing the bird.

Motus wildlife tracking network is a program of Birds Canada, it was launched in 2014 in the US and Canada, by 2022 more than 1,500 receiver stations have been installed in 34 countries, most receivers are concentrated in the United States and Canada.

=== Field-readable rings ===

A field-readable is a ring or rings, usually made from plastic and brightly coloured, which may also have conspicuous markings in the form of letters and/or numbers. They are used by biologists working in the field to identify individual birds without recapture and with a minimum of disturbance to their behaviour. Rings large enough to carry numbers are usually restricted to larger birds, although if necessary small extensions to the rings (leg flags) bearing the identification code allow their use on slightly smaller species. For small species (e.g. most passerines), individuals can be identified by using a combination of small rings of different colours, which are read in a specific order. Most colour-marks of this type are considered temporary (the rings degrade, fade and may be lost or removed by the birds) and individuals are usually also fitted with a permanent metal ring.

=== Leg-flags ===

Similar to coloured rings or bands are leg-flags, usually made of darvic and used in addition to numbered metal rings. Although leg-flags may sometimes have individual codes on them, their more usual use is to code for the sites where the birds were ringed in order to elucidate their migration routes and staging areas. The use of colour-coded leg-flags is part of an international program, originated in Australia in 1990, by the countries of the East Asian - Australasian Flyway to identify important areas and routes used by migratory waders.

=== Other markers ===

Head and neck markers are very visible, and may be used in species where the legs are not normally visible (such as ducks and geese). &quot;Nasal discs&quot; and &quot;nasal saddles&quot; can be attached to the culmen with a pin looped through the nostrils in birds with perforate nostrils. They should not be used if they obstruct breathing. They should not be used on birds that live in icy climates, as accumulation of ice on a nasal saddle can plug the nostrils. &quot;Neck collars&quot; made of expandable, non-heat-conducting plastic are useful for larger birds such as geese.

== Education ==
Many institutions that ring birds offer demonstrations for the public, where experts ring live birds while highlighting the steps of the process and answering questions from the public. Educating visitors about the technique helps to spread accurate information about it to the public. While live bird ringing is not the only method of educating the public on bird conservation, it can be an especially engaging and unique method for visitors.

== Regulation ==

Ringing activities are often regulated by national agencies but because ringed birds may be found across countries, there are consortiums that ensure that recoveries and reports are collated. In the UK, bird ringing is organised by the British Trust for Ornithology. In North America the U.S. Bird Banding Laboratory collaborates with Canadian programs and since 1996, partners with the North American Banding Council (NABC). Waterfowl hunters may report the ring number of the bird they killed or observed, and find out the details of that specific bird such as breed, age, and ringing location. Bird rings are often seen as a prize because they are still relatively rare. The European Union for Bird Ringing (EURING) consolidates ringing data from the various national programs in Europe. In Australia, the Australian Bird and Bat Banding Scheme manages all bird and bat ringing information. while SAFRING manages bird ringing activities in South Africa. Bird ringing in India is managed by the Bombay Natural History Society. BirdRing rings in the Neotropics and Africa. The National Center for Bird Conservation (CEMAVE) coordinates a national scheme for bird ringing in Brazil.

<doc id="361217" wikidata="Q1189196" url="?curid=361217" title="Happy Days (play)">
<text>Happy Days is a play in two acts, written by Samuel Beckett first performed in 1961. Viewed positively by critics, it was named in &quot;The Independent&quot; as one of the 40 best plays of all time.

Winnie, buried to her waist, follows her daily routine and prattles to her husband, Willie, who is largely hidden and taciturn. Her frequent refrain is &quot;Oh this &quot;is&quot; a happy day.&quot; Later, in Act II, she is buried up to her neck, but continues to talk and remember happier days.

==Synopsis==

===Act I===
Winnie is embedded waist-deep in a low mound under blazing light, with a large black bag beside her. She is awakened by a piercing bell and begins her daily routine with a prayer. Talking incessantly to herself, she brushes her teeth, drinks the last of a bottle of tonic, and puts on her hat. She struggles to read the writing on the toothbrush. She awakens her husband Willie, who is hidden by the mound, and prattles to him. He occasionally responds with headlines from his newspaper, one of which reminds her of her first kiss. They both look at an apparently saucy postcard. Winnie explains that Willie&#x27;s listening enables her to go on talking, and is delighted when he responds even briefly to one of her many questions. After Willie briefly doffs his cap, Winnie instructs him to return to his hole, which he laboriously does. After he is within she repeatedly asks if he can hear her at different volumes, to which he replies, with increasing exasperation, &quot;yes!&quot; Winnie attempts to discover if Willie can see her if she leans backward, but he does not respond. Winnie spots an &#x27;emmet&#x27; (an archaic term for &#x27;ant&#x27;) carrying an egg. Willie comments &quot;formication&quot; (A sensation of ants creeping on the skin). Both of them laugh hysterically at the homophone. Winnie declares that she never thought she would hear Willie laugh again. She then asks if he finds her loveable. After some deliberation with herself, she pulls a revolver out of her bag, recalls how Willie asked her to take it away from him, and banishes it to the ground beside her. She begins to feel sad about her life, but shakes it off. She puts up a parasol to protect herself from the sun, and holds it over her head for a long time. When this becomes tiring, she discovers she cannot move to put it down. She begs Willie for assistance, but he is unresponsive. The parasol then abruptly catches fire, and she throws it away. Willie still unresponsive, she cajoles him to prove he is conscious, which he eventually does, by raising a finger. Winnie speaks of the difficulty of dealing with the relentless sun and remembers when she was not trapped in the earthen mound. She thinks about the future, and the existential threat of being buried deeper in the mound. She finds a music box in her bag, to the music of which Willie briefly sings (though he ignores Winnie&#x27;s request for an encore). Winnie files her nails and remembers the last people who passed, a Mr. and Mrs. Shower (or perhaps Cooker), who asked what she was doing stuck in the ground. She prepares her bag for the night. Willie emerges and Winnie wishes that he would come round and live where she could see him better. He reads his newspaper. Winnie asks Willie about the nature of hogs, to which he replies &quot;castrated male swine, raised for slaughter.&quot; Darkness overcomes the pair.

===Act II===
Winnie is now embedded up to her neck, still wearing her hat, still with the bag and revolver beside her. She is awakened by the bell, which rings again each time she falls back asleep. She senses that Willie is looking at her but can no longer see him, and he does not respond to her calls. She continues to talk, examining her nose and recalling a time when a little girl called Mildred undressed her doll in the nursery at night, but is interrupted by anxiety about Willie and further memories of Mr. and Mrs. Shower. Willie crawls out from behind the mound, smartly dressed, which reminds her of the day he asked her to marry him. She encourages him as he tries to crawl up the mound towards her, and is delighted when he grunts &quot;Win&quot;. She sings the music-box tune, a love song.

==Characters==

===Winnie===

Winnie is a &quot;woman of about fifty&quot;, who passes her time between &quot;the bell for waking and the bell for sleep&quot; by following a very exact daily routine. In Act 1, after she methodically removes the items from her baga comb, a toothbrush, toothpaste, a bottle of patent medicine, lipstick, a nail file, a revolver and a music box. The routine is raised to the level of ceremony. Beckett&#x27;s instructions to Billie Whitelaw in 1979 emphasize this:

The bag is all she has—look at it with affection … From the first you should know how she feels about it … When the bag is at the right height you peer in, see what things are there and then get them out. Peer, take, place. Peer, take, place. You peer more when you pick things up than when you put them down. Everything has its place.

At the end of the day she carefully collects her possessionsbar the gunand places them back in the bag. Winnie never plumbs (never dares plumb) the bottom (&quot;The depths in particular, who knows what treasures&quot;), so it is also her hope chest.

The items in her bag also have secondary functions, they serve as &quot;aides-mémoire&quot;. But more, like Krapp&#x27;s tapes or Lucky&#x27;s bones they provide her with what Mary Doll describes as &quot;touchstones of existential meaning&quot;. Winnie&#x27;s perception of these objects connects her to the memories of specific days and important incidents within them.

Her possessions are all wearing out or running out. At the start of Act I she takes the last swig of her medicine before throwing away the bottle, her toothbrush has hardly any hairs left and the lipstick, to use Beckett&#x27;s expression, is &quot;visibly &quot;zu ende&quot;&quot;, the parasol is faded with a &quot;mangy fringe&quot; and even her pearl necklace is &quot;more thread than pearls&quot;.

Winnie is the eternal optimistRobert Brustein called her a &quot;hopeful futilitarian&quot;but the available sources of her optimism are being used up and she has to work harder and harder to keep up her positive front which is already wafer-thin when we first meet her. Her effortful optimism is expressed in her carefully precise, self-correcting refrain, &quot;Oh this &quot;is&quot; a happy day, this will have been another happy day. After all. So far.&quot;

Beckett described her as being &quot;like a bird&quot; and she makes every effort to rise above her predicament but she keeps getting pulled down. She never questions or explains why she finds herself in the predicament she is in, but her dream is that she will &quot;simply float up into the blue … And that perhaps some day the earth will yield and let me go, the pull is so great, yes, crack all round me and let me out.&quot;

===Willie===

Willie is a man of &quot;about sixty&quot;. In marked contrast to Winnie&#x27;s , the henpecked Willie is laconic to a fault. In the whole of the second act Willie utters only one, barely audible monosyllabic word. Much of his dialogue consists of his reading notices from his paper; his responses to Winnie—when he can be bothered to respond at all—are terse and barely communicative. He functions mainly as something for her to talk at—being used as a by the old music hall pro that Winnie is—&quot;just to know that in theory you can hear me though in fact you don&#x27;t is all I need.&quot;

He keeps himself out of Winnie&#x27;s gaze, only occasionally surfacing from his tunnel. His only interest is to bury himself, figuratively, in an old newspaper or erotic picture postcards, or literally, underground in his cave asleep and seemingly unaffected by the bell that jars Winnie.

There is a childlike, if not exactly innocent, quality to him and there are many times in the play one might think Winnie was talking to a young boy rather than a grown man. Winnie also serves as his protector, the custodian of &quot;Brownie&quot; the revolver she keeps safe from him, lest he use it.

Whereas Beckett aligns Winnie with a bird, albeit one with oil on its feathers, he likens Willie to a &quot;turtle&quot; although many of the metaphors in the play associate him with pigs:

[I]n Act I Winnie speaks of envying &quot;the brute beast&quot; only a moment before Willie&#x27;s &quot;hairy forearm&quot; appears above the mound; throughout the play Willie never rises to his feet, but crawls on all fours; and when Winnie notes that the bristles on her toothbrush are &quot;pure ... hog&#x27;s ... setae&quot; Willie gives this comment a sexual dimension by revealing that a hog is a &quot;Castrated male swine.&quot; In context, this phrase seems to relate to Willie, since various hints are made that he has been metaphorically emasculated by his domineering wife.

==Origin==

Beckett began the play on 8 October 1960 and the English version was completed on 14 May 1961. Beckett finished the translation into French by November 1962 but amended the title. In a moment of inspiration, he borrowed the title Oh les beaux jours, from Verlaine&#x27;s poem, &quot;Colloque sentimental&quot;.

Cyril Cusack claimed that &quot;Happy Days&quot; was, by Beckett&#x27;s own admission, &quot;influenced&quot; by Cusack&#x27;s wife, Maureen Cusack&#x27;s request that he &quot;write a happy play&quot; after &quot;Krapp&#x27;s Last Tape&quot;.

Beckett confided to Brenda Bruce what was going through his mind as he sat down to write the play:

He said: &quot;Well I thought that the most dreadful thing that could happen to anybody, would be not to be allowed to sleep so that just as you&#x27;re dropping off there&#x27;d be a &#x27;Dong&#x27; and you&#x27;d have to keep awake; you’re sinking into the ground alive and it&#x27;s full of ants; and the sun is shining endlessly day and night and there is not a tree … there’s no shade, nothing, and that bell wakes you up all the time and all you&#x27;ve got is a little parcel of things to see you through life.&quot; He was referring to the life of the modern woman. Then he said: &quot;And I thought who would cope with that and go down singing, only a woman.&quot;

&quot;Happy Days&quot; was first published by Grove Press in 1961 followed by Faber in 1963. By this stage in his writing career Beckett was becoming more aware of the importance of revising his work in actual performance and so wrote to Grove Press about &quot;Happy Days&quot; on 18 May 1961 to advise them that, &quot;I should prefer the text not to appear in any form before production and not in book form until I have seen some rehearsals in London. I can&#x27;t be definitive without actual work done in the theatre.&quot;

==Setting==

Winnie is embedded in a &quot;low mound&quot;, &quot;the mother earth symbol to end all other mother earth symbols&quot;. She lives in a deluge of never-ending light from which there is no escape: even the parasol she unfolds at one point ignites, leaving her without protection. We learn that she has not always been buried in this way but we never discover how she came to be trapped so.

A number of suggestions have been put forth to explain where the idea for the original imagery originated. James Knowlson has suggested images from Luis Buñuel&#x27;s 1928 film, &quot;Un chien andalou&quot; or a photograph by Angus McBean of Frances Day.

Beckett required the set to have &quot;a maximum of simplicity and symmetry&quot; with a &quot;very pompier trompe-l&#x27;œil backcloth to represent unbroken plain and sky receding to meet in far distance&quot;. &quot;What should characterise [the] whole scene, sky and earth&quot;, he wrote, &quot;is a pathetic unsuccessful realism, the kind of tawdriness you get in a 3rd rate musical or pantomime, that quality of &quot;pompier&quot;, laughably earnest bad imitation.&quot;

The scene is reminiscent of a seaside postcard with Winnie buried in the sand and Willie with his knotted handkerchief and his boater. The fake backdrop calls to mind also the kind used by photographers that feature a painted body on a sheet of wood with a hole cut out where the head belongs popular at holiday venues. Even the title of the play, &quot;Happy Days&quot;, is the kind of expression typically used when reminiscing about these kinds of holidays. Of note is the fact that he worked on the play while in the English seaside resort of Folkestone during the two weeks he was obliged to be resident in the area before his marriage to Suzanne could officially take place.

The play is also reminiscent of the music hall. The boater Willie sports at a &quot;rakish angle&quot; places his character clearly in the music hall tradition as does his formal wear in the second half of the play. Historically boaters were fashionable headgear up till about the 1920s at which time sunbathing started to become fashionable; prior to this ladies would commonly be seen making use of parasols to protect their white skin from the sun&#x27;s harmful rays.

==Themes==

This play, with Winnie embedded in the earth and Willie crawling on it, is evidently strange. &quot;Strangeness,&quot; Beckett informs us, &quot;was the necessary condition of the play of Winnie’s plight in the play.&quot; During Berlin rehearsals he said, &quot;In this play you have the combination of the strange and the practical, the mysterious and the factual. This is the of both the comedy and the tragedy of it.&quot;

The question of &quot;What does it mean?&quot; is voiced in the play by the passer-by Mr Shower (or Cooker). Beckett explained this in a letter to Alan Schneider:

: Shower &amp; Cooker are derived from German &quot;&quot;schauen&quot; &amp; &quot;gucken&quot;&quot; (to look). They represent the onlooker (audience) wanting to know the meaning of things.

Winnie comments sourly, &quot;Usual drivel&quot;. But Mrs Shower provides an oblique answer: &quot;What’s the idea of you, she says, what are you meant to mean?&quot;.

The play resists answers. When Kay Boyle asked Beckett why Willie reaches up towards Winnie, he replied:

: The question as to which Willie is &#x27;after&#x27; – Winnie or the revolver – is like the question in &quot;All That Fall&quot; as to whether Mr Rooney threw the little girl out of the railway-carriage or not. And the answer is the same in both cases – we don’t know, at least I don’t. All that is necessary as far as I’m concerned – technically and otherwise – less too little, more too much – is the ambiguity of motive, established clearly I hope by Winnie, &#x27;Is it me you’re after, Willie, or is it something else? Is it a kiss you’re after, Willie, or is it something else?’ and by the conspicuousness of revolver requested in the stage-directions at beginning of Act II. To test the doubt was dramatically a chance not to be missed, not be bungled either by resolving it.&quot;

Nevertheless, the central metaphor is clear: Winnie is sinking inexorably in the slow sands of time and disappointment.

: In &quot;Happy Days&quot; the existential condition of the characters is visualized in the mound tightening around Winnie who is sinking deeper and deeper. The nearer she gets to the end, the slower does Winnie sink, and never does the end come to release her from the pain of being smothered in the mound. What Beckett wants to represent is the endless repetition of dying moments rather than death itself. His characters wish to finish life but the end never comes because the clock becomes slower and slower. There is still time, always.

The two-act structure emphasises the passing of time. Act II is bleaker than Act I, and Winnie knows it: &quot;To have been what I always am – and so changed from what I was.&quot; By Act II she can no longer imagine any relief, and she can no longer pray, as she did at the play&#x27;s start. Although she still intones the phrase &#x27;happy day&#x27;, it no longer triggers her smile.&quot;

The play, like life, has a strong sexual undercurrent. &quot;In the &quot;Happy Days&quot; of 1979, Beckett very particularly played upon the physical attractiveness of [Billie] Whitelaw … Where most Winnies, such as Peggy Ashcroft and Irene Worth, look rather matronly, Beckett made Whitelaw’s Winnie into a siren, with black, low cut gown, haunting eyes, exaggerated lipstick … a woman, who while not any longer young, still manifests a powerful erotic dimension&quot;. Her memories often have a sexual edge: sitting on Charlie Hunter&#x27;s knees; her first kiss; the two balls; an encounter in a toolshed; when handed the erotic postcard from Willie, she takes time to examine it before returning it in feigned offense and the story she tells of the small girl Mildred&#x27;s (Beckett&#x27;s original name for Winnie) sexual curiosity is genuinely disturbing. A mouse, in Freudian terms, is a phallic symbol and Beckett&#x27;s protagonists often speak autobiographically in the third person. Also the doll wears a pearl necklet, as does she. It should not be taken from this that the terrified child (assuming the story is figurative) has become the frigid wife; she talks knowledgeably about sex and early drafts of the play even show how their sex life has dwindled over the years. It does appear that sexual relations between her and – a common British euphemism for penis – have been lacking, at least from her perspective:

: There was a time when I could have given you a … And then a time before that again when I did give you a hand … You were always in dire need of a hand, Willie.

Perhaps this is why she teases him with her recollection of other men, to bring him out both sexually and imaginatively. The play is full of sexual innuendo. &quot;And it is sex which is responsible for the contuation of the life that plunges man inevitably into suffering. The sexual innuendos contrast, then, with images of sterility or &#x27;discreation.&#x27;&quot;

==Language==

Many of the play&#x27;s jokes are plays on language. There is a running joke about the writing on Winnie&#x27;s toothbrush. She struggles to read it, starting with &quot;pure&quot;, and progressively seeing more adjectives but not the key noun. Finally learning that it is made of &quot;hog’s setae&quot;, she presses Willie to define &quot;hog&quot;. His definition (&quot;Castrated male swine. Reared for slaughter&quot;) encapsulates his plight. They ignore the more unusual word: “setae&quot; are stiff bristles, whose purpose on a worm is to grip the surface and help the worm move without going backwards.

Winnie struggles to recall quotations from the classics in contrast to Willie&#x27;s quotes from the popular press:

: In Beckett’s selection of quotation and oblique references, virtually every historical epoch is represented: pre-Christian Greek philosophies, the blind religiosity and Christian idealism of the Middle Ages, Renaissance Humanism, eighteenth-century Rationalism and nineteenth-century romanticism. The philosophers, literature and religions of Western man comprise the fragmented mythology against which Winnie fails and suffers and like a jeweller’s foil, mythology highlights the suffering.

Speaking is Winnie&#x27;s &quot;&quot;; words flow from her in an endless stream. She uses &quot;clichés to insulate [herself] from the harshness of existence&quot;. In Beckett&#x27;s texts, language conceals the world and provides comfort by insulating the individual. &quot;Language generally in Beckett’s world is not a means of conveying meaning, but a balm for the sores of existence&quot;.

The final song is the waltz duet, &#x27;I love you so&#x27; from &quot;The Merry Widow&quot;.

==Performance history==

The first production was at the Cherry Lane Theatre, New York City, on 17 September 1961, directed by Alan Schneider with Ruth White as Winnie (for which she won an Obie) and John C. Becher as Willie. The first London production was at the Royal Court Theatre on 1 November 1962 directed by George Devine and Tony Richardson with Brenda Bruce as Winnie and Peter Duguid as Willie. The Irish premiere at the Eblana Theatre in 1963 was well received.

When &quot;Happy Days&quot; was first performed in London there were disagreements about every aspect of the text and production. Even Kenneth Tynan, one of the saviours of &quot;Godot&quot;, felt that &quot;Happy Days&quot; was &quot;a metaphor extended beyond its capacity&quot;, nevertheless, he admitted Beckett&#x27;s strange, insinuating power and urged his readers to buy tickets for the play.
1962 Danish version starring Bodil Udsen, who later performed it on television in 1964.

In 1964, an audio recording in French with Madeleine Renaud as Winnie was released by Disques Adès (TS 30 LA 568) as part of their &quot; L&#x27;Avant-Scène&quot; series.

<doc id="361218" wikidata="Q1264818" url="?curid=361218" title="Western screech owl">
<text>The western screech owl (Megascops kennicottii) is a small owl native to North and Central America, closely related to the eastern screech owl. The scientific name commemorates the American naturalist Robert Kennicott.

==Description==

Length averages , wingspan , and weight . Weight ranges from . Females are larger than males and northern populations are notably larger than southern populations. Adults are larger than whiskered screech owls, with larger feet and a more streaked plumage pattern.

There are several morphs: brown Pacific, grey Pacific, Great Plains, Mojave, and Mexican. All have either brown or dark gray plumage with streaking on the underparts. There is no red morph. This brown and gray streaky coloring allows the owl to camouflage with trees and hide from predators.

They have a round head with ear tufts, yellow eyes, and a yellowish bill. Their appearance is quite similar to whiskered and eastern screech owls, so it is best to identify them by their calls. They were previously considered to be the same species as the eastern screech owl.

==Call==
The primary call is an accelerating series of short whistles at an increasing tempo or a short then long trill falling slightly at end. Other calls: barking and chuckling, similar to the eastern screech owl. They also make a high pitched screech.

The two primary songs for the Western Screech Owl are the bounce and double trill. In a recent study, researchers utilizes sonographic analysis of tape-recorded vocalizations to analyze whether the songs differ in male and females and if so, how accurately could songs be classified by sex. It was discovered that on average, male bounce songs were ~30% lower in frequency than bounce songs of females. However, song duration, note duration, number of notes per bout, and internote duration did not differ. For trill songs, males were also significantly lower in frequency compared to those of females. In addition, female double trill songs had greater internet distances in the leading portion.

==Range and habitat==
The western screech owl is native to Canada, United States, Mexico, Guatemala, El Salvador, Honduras, Costa Rica, and Nicaragua.
Its habitat includes temperate forests, subtropical and tropical montane forests, shrubland, desert, rural fields, and even suburban parks and gardens.

==Breeding==
Western screech owls are permanent residents of the northwest region of North and Central America, breeding in open woods or mixed woods at forest edges. When attracting a female, a male brings her food and creates a series of clicking noises. During courtship, the pair preens each other&#x27;s feathers and sing duets with each other. Once a male and female become a pair, they produce a clutch of 2–7 eggs. The male delivers food to the female as she broods, and once the eggs hatch, the male continues to provide food which the female feeds to the owlets. Both mates then protect their owlets by guarding their tree cavity from dangers such as snakes, jays, and crows. The female is inseparable from her young for their first three weeks of life, but afterwards she joins the male in hunting for two weeks until the baby owls are ready to leave the nest.

== Nesting ==
Rather than living in traditional nests, Western Screech Owls reside in cavities in trees, banks, or cliffs. Of these cavities, the tree species vary. They include, but are not limited to oaks, willows, cottonwoods, and cacti. These cavities are around 1 feet in diameter and up to 1.5 feet deep.

More often than not, these cavities are found by the male owl and were made by natural causes or other species such as woodpeckers. They could nest in these cavities for several years.

The cavities serve not only as shelter, but also as a camouflaging device against potential predators. The height for these nests range from approximately 10 to 30 feet above ground.

== Hunting and prey ==
These nocturnal birds wait on perches to swoop down on unsuspecting prey; they may also catch insects in flight. They are active at dawn, night, or near dusk, using their excellent hearing and night vision to locate prey. Their diet consists mainly of small mammals (such as mice, rats, flying squirrels, and bats), birds (such as northern cardinals and white-throated sparrows), and large insects (such as cicadas); however they are opportunistic predators, even taking to small trout, annelid worms, scorpions, crayfish, reptiles, amphibians, and smaller birds. Their diet varies based on the season and where exactly they reside.

Motion-activated cameras have photographed the birds eagerly scavenging a road-kill opossum. They have also been known to hunt mallard ducks and cottontail rabbits, occasionally. Hatching of their young is synchronized with the spring migration of birds; after migrants pass through screech-owls take fledglings of local birds.

== Conservation status ==
Although the western screech owl is slowly declining in the Pacific Northwest, the species is considered &quot;of low conservation concern&quot; due to their nocturnality and general ability to live alongside humans in surrounding trees. Their population is estimated to be 180,000 according to the Avian Conservation Assessment Database Scores. In areas densely populated by people, human noise can be a disturbance to their creation of nest cavities and human devastation of forests negatively affects their habitat. Climate disasters such as fires and heat waves can endanger their livelihood. Humans have made efforts to provide manmade shelter, such as nest boxes, for western screech owls. The owls have proven to be receptive to these habitats.

==Subspecies==
There are 9 recognized subspecies:
*&quot;Megascops kennicottii aikeni&quot; Brewster, 1891
*&quot;Megascops kennicottii bendirei&quot; (Brewster, 1882)
*&quot;Megascops kennicottii cardonensis&quot; (Huey, 1926)
*&quot;Megascops kennicottii kennicottii&quot; (Elliot, 1867)
*&quot;Megascops kennicottii macfarlanei&quot; Brewster, 1891
*&quot;Megascops kennicottii suttoni&quot; (R. T. Moore, 1941)
*&quot;Megascops kennicottii vinaceus&quot; Brewster, 1888
*&quot;Megascops kennicottii xantusi&quot; Brewster, 1902
*&quot;Megascops kennicottii yumanensis&quot; (A. H. Miller &amp; L. Miller, 1951)

<doc id="361219" wikidata="Q160721" url="?curid=361219" title="Doctors' Trial">
<text>The Doctors&#x27; Trial (officially United States of America v. Karl Brandt, et al.) was the first of 12 trials for war crimes of high-ranking German officials and industrialists that the United States authorities held in their occupation zone in Nuremberg, Germany, after the end of World War II. These trials were held before US military courts, not before the International Military Tribunal, but took place in the same rooms at the Palace of Justice. The trials are collectively known as the &quot;subsequent Nuremberg trials&quot;, formally the &quot;Trials of War Criminals before the Nuremberg Military Tribunals&quot; (NMT).

Twenty of the 23 defendants were medical doctors and were accused of having been involved in Nazi human experimentation and mass murder under the guise of euthanasia. The indictment was filed on 25 October 1946; the trial lasted from 9 December that year until 20 August 1947. Of the 23 defendants, seven were acquitted and seven received death sentences; the remainder received prison sentences ranging from 10 years to life imprisonment.

==Background==
Twenty of the 23 defendants were medical doctors (Viktor Brack, Rudolf Brandt, and Wolfram Sievers were Nazi officials), and were accused of having been involved in Nazi human experimentation and mass murder under the guise of euthanasia. Philip Bouhler, Ernst-Robert Grawitz, Leonardo Conti, and Enno Lolling died by suicide, while Josef Mengele, one of the leading Nazi doctors, had evaded capture.

The judges, heard before Military Tribunal I, were Walter B. Beals (presiding judge) from Washington, Harold L. Sebring from Florida, and Johnson T. Crawford from Oklahoma, with Victor C. Swearingen, a former special assistant to the Attorney General of the United States, as an alternate judge. The Chief of Counsel for the Prosecution was Telford Taylor and the chief prosecutor was James M. McHaney. In his opening statement, Taylor summarized the crimes of the defendants.&quot;The defendants in this case are charged with murders, tortures, and other atrocities committed in the name of medical science. The victims of these crimes are numbered in the hundreds of thousands. A handful only are still alive; a few of the survivors will appear in this courtroom. But most of these miserable victims were slaughtered outright or died in the course of the tortures to which they were subjected. For the most part they are nameless dead. To their murderers, these wretched people were not individuals at all. They came in wholesale lots and were treated worse than animals.&quot;

== Indictment ==
The accused faced four charges, including:

# Conspiracy to commit war crimes and crimes against humanity as described in counts 2 and 3;
# War crimes: performing medical experiments, without the subjects&#x27; consent, on prisoners of war and civilians of occupied countries, in the course of which experiments the defendants committed murders, brutalities, cruelties, tortures, atrocities, and other inhuman acts. Also planning and performing the mass murder of prisoners of war and civilians of occupied countries, stigmatized as aged, insane, incurably ill, deformed, and so on, by gas, lethal injections, and diverse other means in nursing homes, hospitals, and asylums during the Euthanasia Program and participating in the mass murder of concentration camp inmates.
# Crimes against humanity: committing crimes described under count 2 also on German nationals.
# Membership in a criminal organization, the SS.&lt;ref name=&quot;ushmm/doctors&quot;&gt; – Excerpts from the official trial record, opening and closing statements, and eyewitness testimony.&lt;/ref&gt;

The tribunal largely dropped count 1, stating that the charge was beyond its jurisdiction.

I — Indicted   G — Indicted and found guilty

All of the criminals sentenced to death were hanged on 2 June 1948 at Landsberg Prison.

For some, the difference between receiving a prison term and the death sentence was membership in the SS, &quot;an organization declared criminal by the judgement of the International Military Tribunal&quot;. However, some SS medical personnel received prison sentences. The degree of personal involvement and/or presiding over groups involved was a factor in others.

<text>The Philippine Telegraph and Telephone Corporation (PT&amp;T) is a telecommunications service provider in the Philippines since its establishment in 1962. The company caters to corporate, small/medium business, and residential segments across the country. 
PT&amp;T&#x27;s business is categorized into two major services: Connectivity and IT Services.

==History==
PT&amp;T was incorporated on October 16, 1962, and subsequently registered with the Philippine Securities and Exchange Commission on November 14, 1962, under the laws of the Philippines.

PT&amp;T was granted a 25-year national legislative franchise on June 20, 1964, under Republic Act (“RA”) No. 4161, as amended by RA Nos. 5048 and 6970. On July 21, 2016, under RA No. 10894, the company was granted an extension of its franchise for another 25 years.

PT&amp;T was listed on January 10, 1990, for the trading of its common shares but requested voluntary suspension of trading effective December 13, 2004.

It was a major competitor of PLDT in the 1990s prior to the 1997 Asian financial crisis.

In 2017, a consortium led by businessmen Lucio Tan, Jr., Salvador Zamora II, and Benjamin Bitanga acquired a majority stake of 70% in the ownership of PT&amp;T from its previous owner Republic Telecommunication Holdings. The acquisition price was not disclosed.

In November 2017, the company announced that it entered negotiations with China Telecom and Datang Telecom Technology regarding plans to form a consortium for its bid. In 2018, PT&amp;T bid to become the country&#x27;s third telecommunications provider. PT&amp;T was disqualified, thus the winner of the bid were the Mislatel consortium (which became Dito Telecommunity). The National Telecommunications Commission (NTC) said that PT&amp;T failed to meet the technical requirements it set for bidders.

<doc id="361222" wikidata="Q892818" url="?curid=361222" title="John Graham, 1st Viscount Dundee">
<text>John Graham, 7th of Claverhouse, 1st Viscount Dundee (21 July 1648 – 27 July 1689) was a Scottish soldier and nobleman, a Tory and an Episcopalian. As Graham of Claverhouse, he was responsible for policing southwest Scotland to suppress religious unrest and rebellion of Covenanters during the late 17th century.

Later, as a general in the Scottish army, Claverhouse was made Viscount Dundee by King James VII of Scotland (II of England), and remained loyal to James after the Revolution of 1688 deposed James. Dundee rallied Highland clans loyal to the Jacobite cause and led the Jacobite rising of 1689 to victory at Killiecrankie, but lost his life in the battle. This first Jacobite rising was unsuccessful, but Claverhouse posthumously was made a Jacobite hero, acquiring the soubriquet &quot;[[Bonnie Dundee]]&quot;.

==Life==
The Graham family was descended from King Robert III, through his second daughter Princess Mary. John Graham was the elder son of Sir William Graham and Lady Madeline Carnegie, from a junior branch of the family that had acquired the estate of Claverhouse near Dundee. His date of birth is disputed but generally assumed to be in 1648. He had two sisters and was educated with his younger brother David at the University of St Andrews, graduating in 1661.

While closely related to James Graham, 1st Marquess Montrose, known as the &quot;Great Montrose&quot;, William Graham did not join his Highland Campaign of 1644–1645. John and David became wards of their uncles and other relatives after his death around 1652. In 1660, they were listed as burgesses of Dundee, &#x27;by reason of their father&#x27;s privilege&#x27; and John Graham inherited the Claverhouse estate when he came of age in the summer of 1669.

The Claverhouse properties included a house in Glen Ogilvie in the Sidlaw Hills to the north of Dundee (since demolished), Claypotts Castle, and a house at Mill of Mains. In 1669 Graham&#x27;s maternal uncle, David Carnegie, Lord Lour, secured him an appointment as a Commissioner of Excise and Justice of the Peace for Angus.

== Service during the Franco–Dutch War 1672–1678 ==

As a result of the Wars of the Three Kingdoms, many in both Scotland and England viewed standing armies as a threat to individual liberty and society itself. Lack of opportunities at home meant those like Claverhouse who wanted a military career joined units in foreign service, such as the French Irish Brigade or the Dutch Scots Brigade. Loyalties were often based on religion or personal relationships, while officers frequently moved between armies; Marshal Turenne (1611–1675), considered the greatest French general of his time, was a Protestant who served in the Dutch army from 1625 to 1630 before changing allegiance.

When the Franco-Dutch War broke out in 1672, England was allied with France, largely due to secret payments made by Louis XIV to Charles II. Claverhouse was appointed Captain in Sir William Lockhart&#x27;s Scots Regiment, part of an Anglo-Scots brigade commanded by the Duke of Monmouth that served with the French during 1673–1674. Supporting Catholic France against the Protestant Dutch Republic was unpopular, especially in Scotland which had close cultural end economic links and England withdrew from the war after the 1674 Treaty of Westminster.
Many members of the Anglo-Scots Brigade now enrolled with the Dutch, including Claverhouse. This unit had been part of the Dutch army since the 1580s and despite the name, normally contained a mixture of regiments recruited in Scotland and England. Withdrawn in 1672, the English units were restored in 1674 but since the Scots regiments had also lost much of their national identity, a deliberate policy was adopted to re-establish them as English and Scottish units. Claverhouse fought at the Battle of Seneffe in 1674, where it is alleged he rescued the young William of Orange, although this appears doubtful.
In the absence of a permanent army, the Scots Brigade was an important source of military professionals for both Charles II and James II, who nominally controlled the appointment of officers. In reality, this required negotiation and many Brigade officers were political and religious exiles, particularly after the 1679–81 Exclusion Crisis; in 1680, Charles tried to appoint the Catholic Earl of Dumbarton as Brigade commander but William refused. James in particular tracked the careers of potential supporters, like the Catholics Thomas Buchan and Alexander Cannon, also officers in the Scots Brigade and who replaced Claverhouse after his death at Killiecrankie. In early 1678, Claverhouse resigned his commission and returned to Scotland; one suggestion is this was due to a disciplinary incident which led to him being passed over for promotion.

==Military service in Scotland==
With James&#x27; recommendation, in September 1678 Claverhouse was given command of one of the &#x27;Highland&#x27; companies employed to police South-West Scotland; unlike the earlier semi-private &#x27;Independent&#x27; companies, these were funded by the government. While the primary objective was the suppression of illegal Presbyterian field meetings or Conventicles, it was also driven by the conflict between the Presbyterian Earl of Argyll and the equally Presbyterian Macleans over control of Mull.

Demarcation disputes between Claverhouse and regional magnates such as the Earl of Queensberry meant he had to tread carefully; in December 1678, the regular clergy complained when he told them that he had no orders to apprehend anyone for past misdemeanours. The situation then exploded when Covenanter militants killed Archbishop James Sharp on 3 May 1679.

Hearing news of a large conventicle on 1 June 1679, Claverhouse located it near Loudoun Hill but &quot;little to our advantage; for, when we came in sight of them, we found them drawn up in batell, upon a most advantagious ground, to which there was no coming but through mosses and lakes. They were not preaching... They consisted of four battalions of foot, and all well armed with fusils and pitchforks, and three squadrons of horse.&quot;
The Covenanter force was led by 19-year-old William Cleland, who had positioned them at the top of a hill, with a marsh in front; after exchanging fire, the 240 dragoons advanced but became stuck in the wet ground and seeing this, the Covenanters charged. Claverhouse&#x27;s horse was wounded and maddened by pain, carried him away from the battle, with his troopers following; the Battle of Drumclog was little more than a skirmish but cost the government 36 men and raised Covenanter morale.
He later wrote to the Earl of Linlithgow that the Covenanters: &quot;resolved a generall engadgment, and immediately advanced with there foot, the horse folowing: they came throght the lotche ... they recaived our fyr, and advanced to shok: the first they gave us broght down the Coronet Mr Crafford and Captain Bleith, besides that with a pitchfork they made such an opening in my rone horse&#x27;s belly, that his guts hung out half an elle, and yet he caryed me aff an myl: which so discoraged our men, that they sustained not the shok, but fell into disorder&quot;.

Claverhouse returned to Glasgow, which the Covenanters briefly besieged but could not take without artillery. On 3 June, Claverhouse and his troops headed for Stirling Castle, the strongest fort in Scotland to await the arrival of reinforcements under Monmouth, which included the militia and two regiments of dragoons. He escaped censure for Drumclog but was made subordinate to Monmouth; on 22 June, the sides met again at the Battle of Bothwell Brig and this time the Covenanters were routed.

Nearly 1200 Covenanter prisoners were held at Greyfriars Kirkyard in Edinburgh; Claverhouse was dispatched to London to protest against Monmouth&#x27;s alleged leniency towards them. This began his close relationship with James, who in 1680 awarded him the barony of Freuch in Galloway.

In January 1681, he was appointed to the sheriffships of Wigtown, Dumfries, Kirkcudbright and Annandale. In December 1682, he was appointed colonel of a new regiment to be raised in Scotland. He had still greater honours in view. In January 1683, the case of the Earl of Lauderdale was debated in the House of Lords. Lauderdale was proprietor of the lands and lordship of Dundee and Dudhope, and the decree of the Lords against him was issued in March 1683 for the sum of 72,000 pounds. Claverhouse succeeded in having the Castle of Dudhope (part of the property of the defaulter) and Lauderdale&#x27;s title of Constable of Dundee transferred to him by royal grant in 1684. In May 1683, he was nominated to the Privy Council of Scotland.

==Marriage and promotion==

In 1684, he married Lady Jeane Cochrane, granddaughter of William Cochrane, 1st Earl of Dundonald, a staunch Covenanter. Shortly after the death of Charles II in 1685, Claverhouse incurred a temporary disgrace – he stood up for the rights of ordinary soldiers who were being poorly treated – by his deposition from the office of privy councillor; but he was reinstated in May, although his commission of justiciary, which had expired, was not renewed. In 1686, he was promoted to the rank of major-general, and given the additional position of Constable, the dignity of Lord Provost of Dundee. One of his first acts as Provost was to abolish the death penalty for theft under his jurisdiction. In 1688, he was second-in-command to General Douglas in the army which had been ordered to England to aid the falling dynasty of the Stuarts. In the same year, however, he was created Viscount Dundee by James VII while with the Scots army in England. He was also given military command of all the King&#x27;s forces in Scotland.

==Service after the Revolution of 1688==

Dundee returned to Scotland in anticipation of the meeting of the Convention of Estates in Edinburgh, and at once exerted himself to bolster the waning resolution of the Duke of Gordon, the governor of Edinburgh Castle, with regard to holding it for the King. The Convention proving hostile, he conceived the idea of forming a rival convention at Stirling to sit in the name of James VII, but the hesitancy of his associates rendered the design futile, and it was given up. Prior to this, on 18 March 1689, he had left Edinburgh at the head of a company of fifty loyal dragoons, who were strongly attached to his leadership. He was not long gone before the news was brought to the alarmed convention that he had been spotted clambering up the castle rock and holding a conference with Gordon.

Dundee retired to Dudhope. On 30 March, despite a letter to the Convention stating that he was not in arms and that he was living peacefully at home awaiting the birth of his first child, he was publicly denounced as a traitor. He had offered to give a bond or parole to no avail and in the latter half of April attempts were made to apprehend him at Dudhope, and at his residence in Glen Ogilvy; but the secrecy and speed of his movements outwitted his pursuers, and he retreated to the north.

In 1689, after the overthrow of King James VII, he continued to support the Stuart dynasty in his capacity as commander-in-chief of all Scottish forces. On 13 April, Dundee raised the Scottish Royal Standard on Dundee Law in support of his king, country and the Jacobite cause. However, in spite of his subsequent association with the city of Dundee, he was to face what the historian of Jacobitism, Bruce Lenman, has described as a &quot;stony faced&quot; reception from its townsfolk. It is claimed that Dundee&#x27;s association with the city was brief and unpopular as he was seen as the representative of an arbitrary authoritarian monarchy that was eroding the self-autonomy the burgh had enjoyed.

Indeed, when he returned to Dundee with a small troop of horse (Dundee Law at that time lay outside the burgh walls) he was to find the walls guarded and the gates firmly shut. The city was heavily garrisoned by Williamite forces at the time which may better explain why the gates were barred to him. The fact that the large force in Dundee made no attempt to give battle or capture him may actually suggest they were to some degree sympathetic to his cause. Later events show that cavalry based in Dundee at the time later attempted to defect and join his forces. For four months he rallied support in the hope that King James would return from Ireland, showing considerable skill in letter-writing and diplomacy and deploying successful skirmishing tactics to buy himself time.

His greatest victory was won at the Battle of Killiecrankie later that year against much greater Williamite forces led by General Hugh Mackay. Scott believes that Dundee&#x27;s death in victory as he led the Jacobite charge down the hill at sunset was the final desperate act of a man who was aware that he had been betrayed by Melfort, the King&#x27;s adviser, and was trying to overcompensate for their lack of support. The Highlanders were completely victorious, but Dundee, in the act of encouraging his men, was pierced beneath the breastplate by a musket ball of the enemy and fell dying from his horse. Dundee reputedly asked a soldier &quot;How goes the day?&quot;, to which the man replied, &quot;Well for King James, but I am sorry for your lordship.&quot; The dying Dundee then replied, &quot;If it goes well for him, it matters the less for me.&quot;
The battle, disastrous as it was to the government forces, was in reality the end of the insurrection, for the controlling and commanding genius of the rebellion was no more. The death of Dundee, in the midst of the confusion of a cavalry charge, became the subject of numerous legends, the best known of which was the long prevalent but of course, entirely false tale that he was invulnerable to lead (due to having made a pact with the Devil) and was killed by being penetrated by a silver button from his own coat. He died on the battlefield and was carried the few miles to the nearby parish church of St Bride, above Blair Castle, where he was buried. The stone which commemorates him at the crypt gives his age (erroneously) as 46, when he was actually 41. Dundee&#x27;s helmet and breastplate, removed from the vault below the church in the 19th century, are preserved in Blair Castle.

The tune under the title of &quot;Bonnie Dundee&quot; (or &quot;Bonny Dundee&quot;) predated Claverhouse&#x27;s appointment as Viscount Dundee, and several 18th-century songs under that title refer to the city of Dundee and not Claverhouse. With Walter Scott&#x27;s publication around 1828 of his poem adapting the old tune to praise Claverhouse, the phrase &quot;bonnie Dundee&quot; became generally associated with the Viscount rather than the town, though the older ballads were still published.

==Covenanter historiography==
After his death, Presbyterian historians dubbed Dundee &quot;Bluidy Clavers&quot;. Contemporary evidence for the fairness of this soubriquet in the Covenanting tradition is mixed. Tales of the Covenanters and Covenanter monuments hold Claverhouse directly responsible for the deaths of adherents of the movement. On the other hand, Claverhouse&#x27;s own letters frequently recommended lenient treatment of Covenanters, and in 1684 he married into a prominent Covenanter family.

In &quot;Claverhouse&quot; (1887) by Mowbray Walter Morris, cruelty in the area of Dumfriesshire to Covenanters is largely attributed to Robert Grierson of Lag. In contrast Thomas Buchan of the Earl of Mar&#x27;s Regiment, in south-west Scotland for the repressive &quot;killing time&quot; period of harsh enforcement against Covenanters, was considered by Presbyterian chroniclers to have stayed within legal limits. In the case of the execution of John Brown of Priesthill in Muirkirk parish, Ayrshire, on 1 May 1685, Claverhouse himself ordered Brown to be shot summarily by his troops, on the basis of incriminating evidence.

==In literature==
* &quot;The Grameid&quot;, an epic poem in Latin on the Claverhouse campaign of 1689 was written by James Philip of Almerieclos, an Angus laird who was Dundee&#x27;s kinsman and standard-bearer.
*Claverhouse&#x27;s campaign is the subject of a poem called Bonnie Dundee written by Sir Walter Scott in 1830 (later adapted into a song known as Bonnets o&#x27; Bonnie Dundee&quot;&quot;)
* Claverhouse is one of the central characters in Sir Walter Scott&#x27;s novel, &quot;Old Mortality&quot; (1816), and appears as one of the Royalist characters doomed to hell in Wandering Willie&#x27;s tale in &quot;Redgauntlet&quot;. He also features in James Hogg&#x27;s novel &quot;The Brownie of Bodsbeck&quot; (1818) and John Galt&#x27;s novel of the Killing Times, &quot;Ringan Gilhaize&quot; (1823).
* Claverhouse is the subject of Rosemary Sutcliff&#x27;s 1983 young adult novel, &quot;&quot;Bonnie Dundee&quot;.&quot; (In exile in Holland, Hugh Herriot recalls the exploits of his youth as a follower of Bonnie Dundee who tried to win back Scotland for the Catholic King James and whose death during a victorious battle proved to be a final blow for the Jacobite cause.)
* &quot;The Phoenix and the Laurel&quot; (1954), a historical novel by Jane Lane also takes the story of Claverhouse as its subject.
* In &quot;The Dagger with Wings&quot;, one of the Father Brown short stories of G. K. Chesterton, a character tells Father Brown that Dundee sold his soul to the Devil. Father Brown dismisses the idea, saying that &quot;John Graham was simply a seventeenth-century professional soldier, rather better than most&quot;.
* Robert Burns wrote in &quot;The Braes O&#x27;Killiecrankie&quot;, that &quot;The bold Pitcur fell in a furr&#x27;, and Claver&#x27;se gat a clankie -O/ Or I had fed an Athole gled, on the Braes o&#x27; Killiecrankie-O&quot;, the meaning of which is that the speaker would have been carrion but for the misfortunes of the two Jacobite stalwarts.
* John Watson under the pen name Ian Maclaren wrote the historical novel &quot;Graham of Claverhouse&quot;, which was published in 1907. The novel also appeared serialized in newspapers, an example of which was the Muncie, Indiana &quot;Star Press&quot; .
* In 1984, Dutch author A. Alberts (Albert Alberts) published his &#x27;De Zilveren Kogel&#x27; (The Silver Bullet) with Claverhouse as the central character.

<doc id="361223" wikidata="Q3663320" url="?curid=361223" title="Catastrophe (play)">
<text>Catastrophe is a short play by Samuel Beckett, written in French in 1982 at the invitation of A.I.D.A. (Association Internationale de Défense des Artistes) and “[f]irst produced in the Avignon Festival (21 July 1982) … Beckett considered it ‘massacred.’” It is one of his few plays to deal with a political theme and, arguably, holds the title of Beckett&#x27;s most optimistic work. Beckett &quot;wrote the short play &quot;Catastrophe&quot; about control and censorship&quot; and dedicated it to the Czech dramatist Václav Havel, who was in prison at the time. Havel wrote a play called &quot;Mistake&quot; &quot;as a response to the one Beckett had written in solidarity.&quot; &quot;In February 1984, in one of the most significant milestones in the history of &quot;Index on Censorship&quot;, both plays were published for the first time.&quot; In January 2022, after almost 38 years, in 50th birthday celebration of &quot;Index&quot;, they asked &quot;Iranian playwright Reza Shirmarz to write his own response to Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Catastrophe&quot;.&quot; Shirmarz wrote his play &quot;Muzzled&quot; which was published by &quot;Index&quot; as a dramatic response to Beckett&#x27;s &quot;Catastrophe&quot;. Giving his viewpoints on Beckett&#x27;s play in an interview with &quot;Index&quot;, Shirmarz said that &quot;&quot;Catastrophe&quot; is about censored communication, the ritualistic representation and the symbolic image of human relationship constrained by external forces, a deterministic, political and post-dramatic text which demonstrates how humans are coerced to be and live in a torturous limbo. [In &quot;Catastrophe&quot;], Beckett&#x27;s Protagonist is deprived of free will by the systems surrounding him and the systematic control imposed by others, except at the moment he moves his head up and looks at the spectators. Despite his psychosomatic pain, he talks through his silence and protests through his immobility. As so-called social factors and audiences, we are reminded by the playwright that we are not able to get out of the cage the sociopolitical conventions have imprisoned us in and we must abide by the unbreachable laws brought in by the global structures and conglomerates in order to survive.&quot;

==Synopsis==

An autocratic Director and his female Assistant put the “‘[f]inal touches to the last scene’ of some kind of dramatic presentation”, which consists entirely of a man (The Protagonist) standing still onstage.

The Assistant has arranged the man as she has seen fit to, atop a “black block 18” high”, draped in a “black dressing gown [down] to [his] ankles” and – peculiarly – sporting a “black wide-brimmed hat.” The bulk of the drama consists of the Director wresting control from her and moulding the man on stage to suit his personal vision. “The Director call for light, both for his cigar which is constantly going out and for the spectacle of the Protagonist on stage.”

The Director is an irritable and impatient man, his annoyance likely exacerbated by the fact that he has another appointment, “a caucus”, to attend and his time there is limited. He expresses concern with the overall appearance and demands that the coat and hat be removed leaving the man “shivering” in his “old grey pyjamas.” He has the man&#x27;s fists unclenched and then joined, the only suggestion of his Assistant&#x27;s that he pays any heed to; once arranged at breast-height he is satisfied. (Beckett explained to James Knowlson that when he was composing &quot;Catastrophe&quot;, “In my mind was Dupuytren’s contracture (from which I suffer) which reduces hands to claws.”) The Director dismisses his Assistant&#x27;s proposal to have the man gagged (“This craze for explicitation!”) or to “show his face … just for an instant.” He also has her make notes to whiten all the exposed flesh.

In a moment of respite, when the Director leaves the stage, his Assistant collapses into his chair then springs out and wipes it vigorously, as if to avoid contamination, before reseating herself. This helps the audience appreciate better her relationship to each of the parties. She is after all the one who dressed the Protagonist warmly and who – twice – highlights the fact that he is shivering. In some ways she is just “another victim rather than a collaborator.”

Finally they rehearse lighting with the theatre technician (the never-seen &quot;Luke&quot;). The play-within-a-play lasts only a few seconds: from darkness, to light falling on the man&#x27;s head and then darkness again. Finally the Director exclaims: &quot;There&#x27;s our catastrophe! In the bag&quot; and asks for one last run through before he has to leave. He imagines the rising of the expectant applause on the opening day (“Terrific! He’ll have them on their feet. I can hear it from here). The man has become, as John Calder puts it, “a living statue portraying, from the director’s point of view, the quiescent, unprotesting victim, a symbol of the ideal citizen of a totalitarian regime.”

However, in an act of defiance, the man looks up into the audience (after having been looking down the entire time); the “applause falters and dies.” A Pyrrhic victory perhaps. However “the figure’s unexpected movement seems to happen not in the director’s imagined timespace but in the timespace of [&quot;actual&quot;] performance. The moment is unsettling … We do not know why the figure has reacted like this; we do not know when the reaction happens; we do not know where the reaction takes place.” Beckett told Mel Gussow that “it was not his intention to have the character make an appeal … He is a triumphant martyr rather than a sacrificial victim … and it is meant to cow onlookers into submission through the intensity of his gaze and stoicism,”

==Interpretations==

The title requires some clarification. “In the words of Aristotle: ‘catastrophe is an action bringing ruin and pain on stage, [where] wounds and other similar sufferings are performed,’”. Malone refers to “Catastrophe … in the old sense … [t]o be buried alive in lava and not turn a hair, it is then a man shows what stuff he is made of.” The more obvious definition applies of course to the act of defiance itself; the effect is nothing less than catastrophic.

The play is often singled out amongst the Beckett canon as being overtly political even though similar claims could be made for &quot;What Where&quot; and &quot;Rough for Radio II&quot;. The play is still a Beckett play and as such it is unwise to limit ones reading of it. &quot;When ... asked about the political significance of &quot;Catastrophe&quot;, he raised his arms in a gesture of impatience and made just one remark: &#x27;It is not more political than &quot;Pochade Radiophonique&quot;’”, &quot;Rough for Radio II&quot;, as the latter is known in English.&quot;

===Political===

The play can be viewed as an allegory on the power of totalitarianism and the struggle to oppose it, the protagonist representing people ruled by dictators (the director and his aide). By &quot;tweak[ing] him until his clothing and posture project the required image of pitiful dejectedness&quot;, they exert their control over the silenced figure. “The Director’s reifying of the Protagonist can be seen as an attempt to reduce a living human being to the status of an icon of impotent suffering. But, at the end of the play, he reasserts his humanity and his individuality in a single, vestigial, yet compelling movement.” In answer to a reviewer who claimed that the ending was ambiguous Beckett replied angrily: “There’s no ambiguity there at all. He’s saying, you bastards, you haven’t finished me yet.”

=== Theatrical ===

A filmed version of &quot;Catastrophe&quot; was directed by David Mamet for the &quot;Beckett on Film&quot; project. It starred playwright and Beckett enthusiast Harold Pinter as the Director, and featured the last on-camera appearance of the British actor, John Gielgud as the Protagonist (he died only a few weeks later).

This version has been somewhat controversial, as Mamet chose to film it as a realist piece: the scene takes place in an actual theatre, and the principals are dressed as a director and his assistant might look. “When the director (D) made his peremptory demands for light from his female assistant (A) he received it not for his cigar, as in the original, but in the form of torchlight for his script. This weakened the sense of gratuitous offensiveness hanging about the character. D., played by Pinter, received rather too much camera attention and a patient John Gielgud rather too little, above all at the final moment” when he raises his head in defiance. Some critics have argued that this interpretation takes away from the tyrannical theme of the play. Mamet also changes Beckett&#x27;s stage direction concerning the Protagonist&#x27;s hands, substituting a finger pointing for the hands joined.

This is not the only version that has taken liberties with the staging. “When &quot;Catastrophe&quot; was performed in the Beckett Festival on 15 September 1999, the director Robert O’Mahoney, interpreted the climax very differently [from the way Beckett had]. After Johnny Murphy raised his head and glared with great dignity at the audience, his lips parted and stretched into an imitation of Edvard Munch’s &quot;The Scream&quot;. This nullified the impact of the ending, as Protagonist was reduced to nothing more than an abject silently screaming victim.”

&quot;Catastrophe&quot; is not only about a political situation and the place of the artist in it. The victim or “protagonist” is also representative of all actors, having to portray what writers write for them in the way directors tell them to do it (Beckett is not unaware of his own relationship with actors, particularly those who in the past have resisted his stage directions). The director in the play catches two prototypes, that of the political commissar and of the all-powerful personality director like Peter Brook, Vitez, [Mamet or O’Mahoney], who bend a performance to their own interpretation, where often the victim is the author himself; there are many “in” theatrical jokes. The director&#x27;s assistant coolly carries out her instructions, and it matters little if we are in a concentration camp or a film studio: all humane considerations are ruled out to achieve the ultimate work of art. The two-pronged metaphor is incredibly effective for all its surface simplicity. In time, as with all of Beckett&#x27;s work, more strands and allusions will be discovered.

=== Personal ===

“The play has also been related to Beckett’s own horror at self-exposure, and linked to the essentially exhibitionist nature of theatre. It has been seen as demonstrating the impossibility for an artist to shape his work in such a way that it reveals what he intends it to reveal; art in the end escapes him.”

<text>The spectacled cormorant or Pallas&#x27;s cormorant (Urile perspicillatus) is an extinct marine bird of the cormorant family of seabirds that inhabited Bering Island and possibly other places in the Commander Islands and the nearby coast of Kamchatka in the far northeast of Russia. The modern distribution was shown to be a relict of a wider prehistoric distribution in 2018 when fossils of the species from 120,000 years ago were found in Japan. It is the largest species of cormorant known to have existed.

== Taxonomy ==
It was formerly classified in the genus &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot;, but in 2021, the IOC reclassified it and several other Pacific cormorant species into the genus &quot;Urile&quot;, based on a 2014 study that supported reclassifying the Brandt&#x27;s, red-faced, and pelagic cormorants into that genus. Although the spectacled cormorant was not mentioned in the 2014 study and its current taxonomic position is unresolvable by the current phylogenies, it was also reclassified into &quot;Urile&quot; based on its perceived relatedness to those species.

==Description==

The species was first identified by Georg Wilhelm Steller in 1741 on Vitus Bering&#x27;s disastrous second Kamchatka expedition. He described the bird as large, clumsy and almost flightless – though it was probably reluctant to fly rather than physically unable – and wrote &quot;they weighed 12–14 pounds, so that one single bird was sufficient for three starving men.&quot; Though cormorants are normally notoriously bad-tasting, Steller says that this bird tasted delicious, particularly when it was cooked in the way of the native Kamchadals, who encased the whole bird in clay, buried it, and baked it in a heated pit.

With a body mass estimated to be from and a length up to around , the spectacled cormorant was rather larger than all other known cormorants. In a similar fashion to the extant flightless cormorant, which may have rivaled it in length but not weight, the spectacled cormorant is thought to have at least largely lost the power of flight which is borne out by the reduced sternum and wing chord of museum specimens. This species was largely glossy black in color with a reported greenish gloss that may have been fairly vivid in bright light.

A contrasting large white patch could be seen on its lower flanks just above the legs. Like other cormorants, they had small patches of bare skin about the face including a small gular patch and a small amount of bare skin around the eyes; these areas usually appeared to have been dull-yellow or grayish in hue, but during breeding stages, they may have changed to a bright orangey-reddish hue. During breeding stages, they also had a prominent crest on their head. The bare skin around the eyes, as well as the crest, were not present in females.

==Extinction==
Apart from the fact that it fed on fish, almost nothing else is known about the life history of this bird. The population declined quickly after further visitors to the area started collecting the birds for food and feathers. Their reports of profitable whaling grounds and large populations of Arctic foxes and other animals with valuable pelts led to a massive influx of whalers and fur traders into the region; the last birds were reported to have lived around 1850 on Kamen Ariy ()
islet, off the northwestern tip of Bering Island.

Only seven known specimens are currently preserved in public collections, with all specimens collected and given away by the same individual. None of these specimens are available on public display.

A presumed prehistoric record from Amchitka Island, Alaska, is based on misidentification of double-crested cormorant remains.

<doc id="361228" wikidata="Q1983221" url="?curid=361228" title="Glenfield, Leicestershire">
<text>Glenfield is a large village and former civil parish, now in the parish of Glenfields, in the Blaby district of Leicestershire, England. At the 2011 Census, Glenfields had a population of 9,643.

The village is directly to the west of Leicester and is just off junction 21A of the M1. It is the site of the headquarters of Leicestershire County Council, and of Leicestershire Fire and Rescue Service. It also gives its name to Glenfield Hospital, although the hospital is actually across the city border in Leicester.

The heart of the community is around the Square, with St Peter&#x27;s Church (CofE), the church hall, the ruins of the former church, the Methodist Church and Hall and the public library just inside Station Road, and Park House (parish council), the Memorial Hall, Scout Hut, playground, Glenfield Primary School and the nursery school all located just inside Stamford Street. The Hall County Primary School is located on Glenfield Frith Drive. Situated close to the Hall school is Faire Road commonly known for the row of shops situated there.

==History==
The name &quot;Glenfield&quot; means &quot;clean field&quot;, possibly suggesting that it was clear of weeds.

Glenfield is mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, at which time it lay in Guthlaxton hundred and contained 12 households.

The village was greatly enlarged between the 1920s and the 1950s when the Faire Estate was built. In the 1980s and 1990s, another large estate was built on former farmland behind Ellis Park.

Glenfield was the site of the first station from Leicester West Bridge on the Leicester and Swannington Railway, opened on 17 July 1832 as the world&#x27;s third steam railway. Just before reaching the station, the line passed through Glenfield Tunnel, which was built by Robert Stephenson and was, at 1 mile 36 yards, the world&#x27;s longest railway tunnel at the time. The Glenfield end of the tunnel can still be seen.

In 1931 the parish had a population of 1,590. On 1 April 1935 the parish was abolished to form &quot;Glenfields&quot;.

==Parish facilities==

Glenfield has its own village newspaper, &quot;The Glenfield Gazette&quot;. The parish council owns several areas of recreational land, including Ellis Park, Station Park and the Playing Fields. Near to the A50 and the boundary with Groby is the &quot;Millennium Green&quot;, which is managed by a local trust. The Gynsills Nature Area can be found at the junction of Gynsill Lane and Stelle Way. A small area of mature trees and a pond, once part of the Gynsills Estate parkland, is now an area promoting biodiversity and nature conservation.

The area known as &quot;The Square&quot; was once more of a road and contained many more shops, mostly owned by the Stockley family. These were demolished in the 1950s and 1960s to accommodate the roundabout and the maisonettes were built in place of the grocers, post office and butcher&#x27;s shop.

==Notable residents==
The Australian pioneer and explorer Charles Throsby was born in Glenfield in 1777. Stamford Street was the home of painter Bryan Organ. Salcombe Drive was the home of the pundit Graham Barnfield. Leicester Road was the home of Alderman Bertram Powell, Lord Mayor of Leicester 1959–60, from the late 1930s to his death in 1969. During the late 1990s Leicester City players Robbie Savage and Pontus Kåmark lived in Glenfield.
The British dramatist and playwright David Campton was a resident of Liberty Road, Glenfield up until his death in 2006. Footballers David Nugent and Chris Wood lived in Glenfield when playing for Leicester in the mid-2010s.

==Commercial==
 Although Glenfield is mainly residential there are a few businesses located in the area, notably the Widdowson Group and others located on the Mill Lane Industrial Estate. 

==Transport==
Glenfield is away from Leicester, and from the Beaumont Leys Shopping Centre. Glenfield railway station served the village between 1832 and 1928. The nearest railway station is now 

===Roads===
The M1 can be easily accessed at Junction 21A to the south of the village (southbound only), which makes Fosse Shopping Park accessible. The M1 North can be reached in minutes along the A50 towards Markfield, Groby and Coalville.

The A46 leads around the north of Leicester, with access to Anstey and then the A6 to Loughborough.

===Bus===
The village is currently served by First Leicester service 13 and Centrebus 40 CircleLine buses.

<text>Hertford ( ) is the county town of Hertfordshire, England, and is also a civil parish in the East Hertfordshire district of the county. The parish had a population of 26,783 at the 2011 census.

The town grew around a ford on the River Lea, near its confluences with the rivers Mimram, Beane, and Rib. The Lea is navigable from the Thames up to Hertford. Fortified settlements were established on each side of the ford at Hertford in 913AD. The county of Hertfordshire was established at a similar time, being named after and administered from Hertford. Hertford Castle was built shortly after the Norman Conquest in 1066 and remained a royal residence until the early seventeenth century.

Hertfordshire County Council and East Hertfordshire District Council both have their main offices in the town and are major local employers, as is McMullen&#x27;s Brewery, which has been based in the town since 1827. The town is also popular with commuters, being only north of central London and connected to it by two railway lines.

==Toponymy==
The earliest reference to the town appears in the &quot;Ecclesiastical History of the English People&quot;, written by Bede in 731 AD, which refers to . is the Old English spelling of &quot;hart&quot;, meaning a fully mature stag; thus the meaning of the name is a ford where harts are found. The Domesday Book of 1086 gives a spelling of .

==History==

One possible earlier mention of the town was in 672 AD: the first synod of a number of the bishops in England was held either in Hertford or at Hartford, Cambridgeshire. The synod was called by Theodore of Tarsus; decisions included the calculation of the date of Easter.

The &quot;Anglo-Saxon Chronicle&quot; records that in 913AD, Edward the Elder ordered the construction of two burhs (earthwork fortifications) either side of the ford over the River Lea at Hertford as part of his campaign against the Danes.

By the time of the Domesday Book, Hertford had two churches, two markets and three mills. The Normans began work on Hertford Castle, and Hertford Priory was founded by Ralph de Limesy. King Henry II rebuilt the castle in stone, but in 1216, during the First Barons&#x27; War, it was besieged and captured after 25 days by Prince Louis of France. The castle was regularly visited by English royalty and in 1358, Queen Isabella, wife of Edward II, died there. The priory was dissolved in 1536 and subsequently demolished and in 1563, the Parliament of England met at the castle because of an outbreak of plague in London. 

Hertford grew and prospered as a market and county town; communication was improved by the construction of the Lea Navigation Canal in 1767 and the arrival of the railway in 1843. The Port Hill drill hall was completed in 1898 and Yeomanry House was brought into military use in 1910.

Hartford, Connecticut is named after Hertford.

==Governance==
Hertford has three tiers of local government at parish (town), district, and county level: Hertford Town Council, East Hertfordshire District Council, and Hertfordshire County Council, all three of which are based in the town.

Hertford has been the county town of Hertfordshire since the county was founded in Saxon times. The town also gave its name to the hundred of Hertford. The town was initially governed by the king&#x27;s reeves. By the thirteenth century, the reeves had been replaced by a bailiff, elected by the burgesses. Charters of 1554 and 1589 established a common council of eleven chief burgesses and a bailiff. Another charter of 1605 changed the bailiff&#x27;s title to mayor. Under the Municipal Corporations Act 1835, Hertford became a Municipal borough; the ratepayers elected twelve councillors, who chose four aldermen, with the aldermen and councillors together composing the council (also known as the corporation), which elected the mayor.

The Hertford poor law union was established in 1835, covering the town and surrounding rural parishes.

Hertford Corporation used part of the Shire Hall as a Town Hall until 1911, when it moved into the surviving gatehouse of Hertford Castle.

Under the Local Government Act 1972, Hertford Municipal Borough was abolished, merging with other districts to become part of the district of East Hertfordshire with effect from 1 April 1974. A successor parish was created covering the former borough of Hertford, with its parish council taking the name Hertford Town Council. The town council is based at the former offices of the borough corporation at Hertford Castle.

The headquarters of Hertfordshire County Council is at County Hall, built in 1939 to replace the Shire Hall. East Hertfordshire District Council&#x27;s offices almost adjoin County Hall, being at Wallfields, which prior to 1974 had been the offices of Hertford Rural District Council.

===Arms===
From at least 1634, Hertford Corporation used an escutcheon (shield) depicting a hart above water to indicate a ford. The borough council was granted the right to complement its arms with a badge in 1925, and supporters were added in 1937. The coat of arms is now used by Hertford Town Council.
==Geography==
Hertford is at the confluence of four river valleys: the Rib, Beane and Mimram join the River Lea at Hertford to flow east and then south toward the Thames as the Lee Navigation, after Hertford Castle Weir. The shared valley of the Lea and the Beane is called Hartham Common and this provides a large park to one side of the town centre running towards Ware and lying below the ridge upon which Bengeo is situated.

The town centre still has its medieval layout with many timber-framed buildings hidden under later frontages, particularly in St Andrew Street. Hertford suffers from traffic problems despite the existence of the 1960s A414 bypass called Gascoyne Way which passes close to the town centre. Plans have long existed to connect the A10 with the A414, by-passing the town completely. Nevertheless, the town retains very much a country-town feel, despite lying only north of Central London. This is aided by its proximity to larger towns such as Harlow, Bishop&#x27;s Stortford and Stevenage where modern development has been focused.

==Economy==

A fair amount of employment in the town is centred on County Hall (Hertfordshire County Council), Wallfields (East Hertfordshire District Council) and McMullens Brewery, one of a dwindling number of independent pre-1970 family brewers in the United Kingdom. Many residents commute to work in London.

Hertford differs from neighbouring towns as it lacks a modern shopping development (mall). However, it has most of the usual supermarkets. A Tesco store occupies part of the former Christ&#x27;s Hospital Bluecoat Girls School, which closed down in 1985. Sainsbury&#x27;s opened a new store on part of the McMullens Brewery site in June 2012. A Waitrose occupied a reasonably large store in the Bircherley Green Shopping area that closed on 12 September 2017. The local branch of Woolworths closed for good on 27 December 2008, after the collapse of that store chain. There are fewer of the usual chain shops found in most high streets and this makes Hertford stand out from other &quot;clone towns&quot;. There are a high number of independent shops in the town, with a variety of boutiques and salons.

==Sport and leisure==
Hertford has a leisure centre and swimming pool, skatepark, bowling green and tennis courts on Hartham Common.

=== Football ===
The town has a Non-League football club, Hertford Town F.C., which plays at Hertingfordbury Park. Hertford Town Youth FC, a FA Charter Standard Football Club, plays at County Hall Playing Fields, situated next to the headquarters of Hertfordshire County Council at County Hall in Hertford. Other clubs in the surrounding area include Bury Rangers, Hertford Heath Youth FC and Bengeo Tigers Football Club (an award-winning FA Charter Standard Community Football Club.)

===Cricket===

Hertford Cricket Club is based in the town. Records for a Hertford club go back a far as 1825. However, the club in its present form has been in existence since 1860. The club plays its matches at Balls park, Hertford. Currently the club runs five teams and all the teams play in the local league.

<text>Technological utopianism (often called techno-utopianism or technoutopianism) is any ideology based on the premise that advances in science and technology could and should bring about a utopia, or at least help to fulfill one or another utopian ideal.

A techno-utopia is therefore an ideal society, in which laws, government, and social conditions are solely operating for the benefit and well-being of all its citizens, set in the near- or far-future, as advanced science and technology will allow these ideal living standards to exist; for example, post-scarcity, transformations in human nature, the avoidance or prevention of suffering and even the end of death. 

Technological utopianism is often connected with other discourses presenting technologies as agents of social and cultural change, such as technological determinism or media imaginaries.

A tech-utopia does not disregard any problems that technology may cause, but strongly believes that technology allows mankind to make social, economic, political, and cultural advancements. Overall, Technological Utopianism views technology&#x27;s impacts as extremely positive.

In the late 20th and early 21st centuries, several ideologies and movements, such as the cyberdelic counterculture, the Californian Ideology, cyber-utopianism, transhumanism, and singularitarianism, have emerged promoting a form of techno-utopia as a reachable goal. The movement known as effective accelerationism (e/acc) even advocates for &quot;progress at all costs&quot;. Cultural critic Imre Szeman argues technological utopianism is an irrational social narrative because there is no evidence to support it. He concludes that it shows the extent to which modern societies place faith in narratives of progress and technology overcoming things, despite all evidence to the contrary.

==History==

===From the 19th to mid-20th centuries===

Karl Marx believed that science and democracy were the right and left hands of what he called the move from the realm of necessity to the realm of freedom. He argued that advances in science helped delegitimize the rule of kings and the power of the Christian Church.

19th-century liberals, socialists, and republicans often embraced techno-utopianism. Radicals like Joseph Priestley pursued scientific investigation while advocating democracy. Robert Owen, Charles Fourier and Henri de Saint-Simon in the early 19th century inspired communalists with their visions of a future scientific and technological evolution of humanity using reason. Radicals seized on Darwinian evolution to validate the idea of social progress. Edward Bellamy&#x27;s socialist utopia in &quot;Looking Backward&quot;, which inspired hundreds of socialist clubs in the late 19th century United States and a national political party, was as highly technological as Bellamy&#x27;s imagination. For Bellamy and the Fabian Socialists, socialism was to be brought about as a painless corollary of industrial development.

Marx and Engels saw more pain and conflict involved, but agreed about the inevitable end. Marxists argued that the advance of technology laid the groundwork not only for the creation of a new society, with different property relations, but also for the emergence of new human beings reconnected to nature and themselves. At the top of the agenda for empowered proletarians was &quot;to increase the total productive forces as rapidly as possible&quot;. The 19th and early 20th century Left, from social democrats to communists, were focused on industrialization, economic development and the promotion of reason, science, and the idea of progress. 

According to historian Asif Siddiqi, technological utopianism was a &quot;millenarian mantra&quot; in the Soviet Union from its inception. The Bolsheviks imagined &quot;a world of magnificent factories and mechanized agriculture that produced all of society&#x27;s necessities,&quot; a new socialist machine age. Siddiqi writes that &quot;this obsession with the power of science and technology to remake society was partly rooted in crude Marxism, but much of it derived from the Bolsheviks&#x27; own vision to remake Russia into a modern state, one which would compare and compete with the leading capitalist nations in forging a new path to the future.&quot; From the 1930s onwards, Soviet technological utopianism embraced a populist view of technological achievements, which Siddiqi summarizes as &quot;technology for the masses.&quot; Soviet science fiction was heavily focused on future technology, and often depicted a convergence between technological utopia and socialist utopia. 

Sovietologist Paul Josephson argued that most strains of Soviet technological utopianism emphasized technology was apolitical, &quot;serving the profit motive and the industrialist under capitalism, but benefiting all humanity under socialism.&quot; To avoid technological dependence on capitalist states, the Soviet Union and other socialist governments influenced by its narratives sought to create domestic technological innovations, supported by autarkic engineering communities and supply chains. 

Some technological utopians promoted eugenics. Holding that in studies of families, such as the Jukes and Kallikaks, science had proven that many traits such as criminality and alcoholism were hereditary, many advocated the sterilization of those displaying negative traits. Forcible sterilization programs were implemented in several states in the United States.

H. G. Wells in works such as &quot;The Shape of Things to Come&quot; promoted technological utopianism.

To many philosophers, the horrors of World War II and the Holocaust, as Theodor Adorno underlined, seemed to shatter the ideal of Condorcet and other thinkers of the Enlightenment, which commonly equated scientific progress with social progress.

===From late 20th and early 21st centuries===

A movement of techno-utopianism began to flourish again in the dot-com culture of the 1990s, particularly in the West Coast of the United States, especially based around Silicon Valley. The Californian Ideology was a set of beliefs combining bohemian and anti-authoritarian attitudes from the counterculture of the 1960s with techno-utopianism and support for libertarian economic policies. It was reflected in, reported on, and even actively promoted in the pages of &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, which was founded in San Francisco in 1993 and served for a number years as the &quot;bible&quot; of its adherents.

This form of techno-utopianism reflected a belief that technological change revolutionizes human affairs, and that digital technology in particular – of which the Internet was but a modest harbinger – would increase personal freedom by freeing the individual from the rigid embrace of bureaucratic big government. &quot;Self-empowered knowledge workers&quot; would render traditional hierarchies redundant; digital communications would allow them to escape the modern city, an &quot;obsolete remnant of the industrial age&quot;.

Similar forms of &quot;digital utopianism&quot; has often entered in the political messages of party and social movements that point to the Web or more broadly to new media as harbingers of political and social change. Its adherents claim it transcended conventional &quot;right/left&quot; distinctions in politics by rendering politics obsolete. However, Western techno-utopianism disproportionately attracted adherents from the libertarian right end of the political spectrum. Western techno-utopians often have a hostility toward government regulation and a belief in the superiority of the free market system. Prominent &quot;oracles&quot; of techno-utopianism included George Gilder and Kevin Kelly, an editor of &quot;Wired&quot; who also published several books.

During the late 1990s dot-com boom, when the speculative bubble gave rise to claims that an era of &quot;permanent prosperity&quot; had arrived, techno-utopianism flourished, typically among the small percentage of the population who were employees of Internet startups and/or owned large quantities of high-tech stocks. With the subsequent crash, many of these dot-com techno-utopians had to rein in some of their beliefs in the face of the clear return of traditional economic reality.

According to &quot;The Economist&quot;, Wikipedia &quot;has its roots in the techno-optimism that characterised the internet at the end of the 20th century. It held that ordinary people could use their computers as tools for liberation, education, and enlightenment.&quot;

In the late 1990s and especially during the first decade of the 21st century, technorealism and techno-progressivism are stances that have risen among advocates of technological change as critical alternatives to techno-utopianism. However, technological utopianism persists in the 21st century as a result of new technological developments and their impact on society. For example, several technical journalists and social commentators, such as Mark Pesce, have interpreted the WikiLeaks phenomenon and the United States diplomatic cables leak in early December 2010 as a precursor to, or an incentive for, the creation of a techno-utopian transparent society. Cyber-utopianism, first coined by Evgeny Morozov, is another manifestation of this, in particular in relation to the Internet and social networking.

Nick Bostrom contends that the rise of machine superintelligence carries both existential risks and an extreme potential to improve the future, which might be realized quickly in the event of an intelligence explosion. In &quot;Deep Utopia: Life and Meaning in a Solved World&quot;, he further explored ideal scenarios where human civilization reaches technological maturity and solves its diverse coordination problems. He listed some technologies that are theoretically achievable, such as cognitive enhancement, reversal of aging, self-replicating spacecrafts, arbitrary sensory inputs (taste, sound...), or the precise control of motivation, mood, well-being and personality.

In North Korea, technological utopianism remains one of the key themes of the state&#x27;s Juche ideology. The pursuit of advanced strategic technologies is promoted as an integral part of autarkic economic development. North Korean technological utopianism essentially rests on three narratives: the rejection of consumer society and culture, an emphasis on heavy industry, and a belief in the ability of the masses of workers to make great technological achievements under the Workers&#x27; Party of Korea. In practice, this has resulted in most of North Korea&#x27;s technological resources being utilized for large scale, resource intensive, infrastructure and military projects, many of which have primarily symbolic importance. Domestic innovations in nuclear and space sciences continue to play a major role in the state&#x27;s propaganda narratives, which seek to portray North Korea as a modern regional power.

==Principles==
Bernard Gendron, a professor of philosophy at the University of Wisconsin–Milwaukee, defines the four principles of modern technological utopians in the late 20th and early 21st centuries as follows:

#We are presently undergoing a (post-industrial) revolution in technology;
#In the post-industrial age, technological growth will be sustained (at least);
#In the post-industrial age, technological growth will lead to the end of economic scarcity;
#The elimination of economic scarcity will lead to the elimination of every major social evil.

Rushkoff presents us with multiple claims that surround the basic principles of Technological Utopianism:

#Technology reflects and encourages the best aspects of human nature, fostering &quot;communication, collaboration, sharing, helpfulness, and community&quot;.
#Technology improves our interpersonal communication, relationships, and communities. Early Internet users shared their knowledge of the Internet with others around them.
#Technology democratizes society. The expansion of access to knowledge and skills led to the connection of people and information. The broadening of freedom of expression created &quot;the online world...in which we are allowed to voice our own opinions&quot;. The reduction of the inequalities of power and wealth meant that everyone has an equal status on the internet and is allowed to do as much as the next person.
#Technology inevitably progresses. The interactivity that came from the inventions of the TV remote control, video game joystick, computer mouse and computer keyboard allowed for much more progress.
#Unforeseen impacts of technology are positive. As more people discovered the Internet, they took advantage of being linked to millions of people, and turned the Internet into a social revolution. The government released it to the public, and its &quot;social side effect… [became] its main feature&quot;.
#Technology increases efficiency and consumer choice. The creation of the TV remote, video game joystick, and computer mouse liberated these technologies and allowed users to manipulate and control them, giving them many more choices.
#New technology can solve the problems created by old technology. Social networks and blogs were created out of the collapse of dot.com bubble businesses&#x27; attempts to run pyramid schemes on users.

==Criticisms==
Critics claim that techno-utopianism&#x27;s identification of social progress with scientific progress is a form of positivism and scientism. Critics of modern libertarian techno-utopianism point out that it tends to focus on &quot;government interference&quot; while dismissing the positive effects of the regulation of business. They also point out that it has little to say about the environmental impact of technology and that its ideas have little relevance for much of the rest of the world that are still relatively quite poor (see global digital divide).

In his 2010 study &quot;System Failure: Oil, Futurity, and the Anticipation of Disaster&quot;, Canada Research Chairholder in cultural studies Imre Szeman argues that technological utopianism is one of the social narratives that prevent people from acting on the knowledge they have concerning the effects of oil on the environment.

Another concern is the amount of reliance society may place on their technologies in these techno-utopia settings. For example, In a controversial 2011 article &quot;Techno-Utopians are Mugged by Reality&quot;, L. Gordon Crovitz of &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; explored the concept of the violation of free speech by shutting down social media to stop violence. As a result of a wave of British cities being looted, former British Prime Minister David Cameron argued that the government should have the ability to shut down social media during crime sprees so that the situation could be contained. A poll was conducted to see if Twitter users would prefer to let the service be closed temporarily or keep it open so they could chat about the famous television show &quot;The X-Factor&quot;. The end report showed that every respondent opted for &quot;The X-Factor&quot; discussion. Clovitz contends that the negative social effect of technological utopia is that society is so addicted to technology that humanity simply cannot be parted from it even for the greater good. While many techno-utopians would like to believe that digital technology is for the greater good, he says it can also be used negatively to bring harm to the public. These two criticisms are sometimes referred to as a technological anti-utopian view or a techno-dystopia.

According to Ronald Adler and Russell Proctor, mediated communication such as phone calls, instant messaging and text messaging are steps towards a utopian world in which one can easily contact another regardless of time or location. However, mediated communication removes many aspects that are helpful in transferring messages. As it stands , most text, email, and instant messages offer fewer nonverbal cues about the speaker&#x27;s feelings than do face-to-face encounters. This makes it so that mediated communication can easily be misconstrued and the intended message is not properly conveyed. With the absence of tone, body language, and environmental context, the chance of a misunderstanding is much higher, rendering the communication ineffective. In fact, mediated technology can be seen from a dystopian view because it can be detrimental to effective interpersonal communication. These criticisms would only apply to messages that are prone to misinterpretation as not every text based communication requires contextual cues. The limitations of lacking tone and body language in text-based communication could potentially be mitigated by video and augmented reality versions of digital communication technologies.

In 2019, philosopher Nick Bostrom introduced the notion of a &quot;vulnerable world&quot;, &quot;one in which there is some level of technological development at which civilization almost certainly gets devastated by default&quot;, citing the risks of a pandemic caused by a DIY biohacker, or an arms race triggered by the development of novel armaments. He writes that &quot;Technology policy should not unquestioningly assume that all technological progress is beneficial, or that complete scientific openness is always best, or that the world has the capacity to manage any potential downside of a technology after it is invented.&quot;

<text>A torque wrench is a tool used to apply a specific torque to a fastener such as a nut, bolt, or lag screw. It is usually in the form of a socket wrench with an indicating scale, or an internal mechanism which will indicate (as by &#x27;clicking&#x27;, a specific movement of the tool handle in relation to the tool head) when a specified (adjustable) torque value has been reached during application.

A torque wrench is used where the tightness of screws and bolts is a crucial parameter of assembly or adjustment. It allows the operator to set the torque applied to the fastener to meet the specification for a particular application. This permits proper tension and loading of all parts.

Torque screwdrivers and torque wrenches have similar purposes and may have similar mechanisms.

==History==
The first patent for a torque wrench was filed by John H. Sharp of Chicago in 1931. This wrench was referred to as a &quot;torque measuring wrench&quot; and would be classified today as an indicating torque wrench.

In 1935, Conrad Bahr and George Pfefferle patented an adjustable ratcheting torque wrench. The tool featured audible feedback and restriction of back-ratcheting movement when the desired torque was reached. Bahr, who worked for the New York City Water Department, was frustrated at the inconsistent tightness of flange bolts he found while attending to his work. He claimed to have invented the first torque limiting tool in 1918 to alleviate these problems. Bahr&#x27;s partner, Pfefferle, was an engineer for S.R. Dresser Manufacturing Co and held several patents.

==Types==

===Beam===
The most basic form of torque wrench consists of two beams. The first is a lever used to apply the torque to the fastener being tightened and serves also as the handle of the tool. When force is applied to the handle it will deflect predictably and proportionally with said force in accordance with Hooke&#x27;s law. The second beam is only attached at one end to the wrench head and free on its other, this serves as the indicator beam. Both of these beams run parallel to each other when the tool is at rest, with the indicator beam usually on top. The indicator beam&#x27;s free end is free to travel over a calibrated scale attached to the lever or handle, marked in units of torque. When the wrench is used to apply torque, the lever bends and the indicating beam stays straight. Thus, the end of the indicating beam points to the magnitude of the torque that is currently being applied. This type of wrench is simple, inherently accurate, and inexpensive.

The beam type torque wrench was developed in between late 1920s and early 1930s by Walter Percy Chrysler for the Chrysler Corporation and a company known as Micromatic Hone. Paul Allen Sturtevant—a sales representative for the Cedar Rapids Engineering Company at that time—was licensed by Chrysler to manufacture his invention. Sturtevant patented the torque wrench in 1938 and became the first individual to sell torque wrenches.

A more sophisticated variation of the beam type torque wrench has a dial gauge indicator on its body that can be configured to give a visual or electrical indication when a preset torque is reached.

=== Deflecting beam ===
The dual-signal deflecting beam torque wrench was patented by the Australian Warren and Brown company in 1948. It employs the principle of applying torque to a deflecting beam rather than a coil spring. This is claimed to help prolong the accuracy of the wrench throughout its working life, with a greater safety margin on maximum loading and provides more consistent and accurate readings throughout the range of each wrench. The operator can both hear the signal click and see (and feel) a physical indicator when the desired torque is reached.


The wrench functions in the same general way as an ordinary beam torque wrench. There are two beams both connected to the head end but only one through which torque is applied. The load carrying beam is straight and runs from head to handle, it deflects when torque is applied. The other beam (indicating beam) runs directly above the deflecting beam for about half of the length then bends away to the side at an angle from the deflecting beam. The indicating beam retains its orientation and shape during operation. Because of this, there is relative displacement between the two beams. The deflecting beam torque wrench differs from the ordinary beam torque wrench in how it utilizes this relative displacement. Attached to the deflecting beam is a scale and onto that is fitted a wedge which can be slid along the length of the scale parallel to the flexing beam. This wedge is used to set the desired torque. Directly facing this wedge is the side of the angled indicating beam. From this side protrudes a pin, which acts as a trigger for another pin, the latter pin is spring loaded, and fires out of the end of the indicating beam once the trigger pin contacts the adjustable wedge. This firing makes a loud click and gives a visual and tactile indication that the desired torque has been met. The indicator pin can be reset by simply pressing it back into the indicating beam.

===Slipper===
A slipper type torque wrench consists of a roller and cam (or similar) mechanism. The cam is attached to the driving head, the roller pushes against the cam locking it in place with a specific force which is provided by a spring (which is in many cases adjustable). If a torque which is able to defeat the holding force of the roller and spring is applied, the wrench will slip and no more torque will be applied to the bolt. A slipper torque wrench will not overtighten the fastener by continuing to apply torque beyond a predetermined limit.

===Click===
A more sophisticated method of presetting torque is with a calibrated clutch mechanism. One common form uses a ball detent and spring, with the spring preloaded by an adjustable screw thread, calibrated in torque units. The ball detent transmits force until the preset torque is reached, at which point the force exerted by the spring is overcome and the ball &quot;clicks&quot; out of its socket. This design yields greater precision as well as giving tactile and audible feedback. The wrench will not start slipping once the desired torque is reached, it will only click and bend slightly at the head; the operator can continue to apply torque to the wrench without any additional action or warnings from the wrench.

A number of variations of this design exist for different applications and different torque ranges. A modification of this design is used in some drills to prevent gouging the heads of screws while tightening them. The drill will start slipping once the desired torque is reached.

===&quot;No-hub&quot; wrench===
These are specialized torque wrenches used by plumbers to tighten the clamping bands on hubless soil pipe couplings. They are usually T-handled wrenches with a one-way combination ratchet and clutch. They are preset to a fixed torque designed to secure the coupling adequately but insufficient to damage it.

===Electronic torque wrenches===

With electronic (indicating) torque wrenches, measurement is by means of a strain gauge attached to the torsion rod. The signal generated by the transducer is converted to the required unit of torque (e.g. N·m or lbf·ft) and shown on the digital display. A number of different joints (measurement details or limit values) can be stored. These programmed limit values are then permanently displayed during the tightening process by means of LEDs or the display. At the same time, this generation of torque wrenches can store all the measurements made in an internal readings memory. This reading&#x27;s memory can then be easily transferred to a PC via the interface (RS232) or printed. A popular application of this kind of torque wrench is for in-process documentation or quality assurance purposes. Typical accuracy level would be ±0.5% to 4%.

===Interchangeable Head Torque Wrenches===
Interchangeable head torque wrenches are designed to connect several different types of wrench heads, thereby reducing the number of torque wrenches needed. These wrenches are ideal for applications that require multiple fastening tools. They typically have a standard mounting interface that allows for quick changeover from one wrench head to another while ensuring that the torque applied remains accurate. Common interface sizes include 9×12mm and 12×14mm, and interchangeable heads include open-end, ring-end, adjustable, ratchet, etc.

===Programmable electronic torque / angle wrenches===

Torque measurement is conducted in the same way as with an electronic torque wrench but the tightening angle from the snug point or threshold is also measured. The angle is measured by an angle sensor or electronic gyroscope. The angle measurement process enables joints which have already been tightened to be recognized. The inbuilt readings memory enables measurements to be statistically evaluated. Tightening curves can be analyzed using the software via the integrated tightening-curve system (force/path graph). This type of torque wrench can also be used to determine breakaway torque, prevail torque and the final torque of a tightening job. Thanks to a special measuring process, it is also possible to display the yield point (yield controlled tightening). This design of torque wrench is highly popular with automotive manufacturers for documenting tightening processes requiring both torque and angle control because, in these cases, a defined angle has to be applied to the fastener on top of the prescribed torque (e.g. + 90° – here the means the snug point/threshold and +90° indicates that an additional angle has to be applied after the threshold).

In 1995, Saltus-Werk Max Forst GmbH applied for an international patent for the first electronic torque wrench with angle measurement which did not require a reference arm.

===Mechatronic torque wrenches===
Torque measurement is achieved in the same way as with a click-type torque wrench but, at the same time, the torque is measured as a digital reading (click and final torque) as with an electronic torque wrench. This is, therefore, a combination of electronic and mechanical measurements. All the measurements are transferred and documented via wireless data transmission. Users will know they have achieved the desired torque setting when the wrench &quot;beeps&quot;.

==Torque wrench standardization==

===ISO===
The International Organization for Standardization maintains standard ISO 6789. This standard covers the construction and calibration of hand-operated torque tools. They define two types of torque tool encompassing twelve classes, these are given by the table below. Also given is the percentage allowable deviation from the desired torque.

The ISO standard also states that even when overloaded by 25% of the maximum rating, the tool should remain reliably usable after being re-calibrated. Re-calibration for tools used within their specified limits should occur after 5000 cycles of torquing or 12 months, whichever is soonest. In cases where the tool is in use in an organization which has its own quality control procedures, then the calibration schedule can be arranged according to company standards.

Tools should be marked with their torque range and the unit of torque as well as the direction of operation for unidirectional tools and the maker&#x27;s mark. If a calibration certificate is provided, the tool must be marked with a serial number that matches the certificate or a calibration laboratory should give the tool a reference number corresponding with the tool&#x27;s calibration certificate.

===ASME===
The American Society of Mechanical Engineers maintains standard ASME B107.300. This standard has the same type designation as the ISO standard with the addition of the type 3, (limiting) torque tool. This type will release the drive once the desired torque is met so that no more torque can be applied. This standard, however, uses different class designations within each type as well as additional style and design variants within each class. The standard also separates manual and electronic tools into different sections and designations. The ASME and ISO standards cannot be considered compatible. The table below gives some of the types and tolerances specified by the standard for manual torque tools.

Tools should be marked with the model number of the tool, the unit of torque and the maker&#x27;s mark. For unidirectional tools, the word &quot;TORQUES&quot; or &quot;TORQUE&quot; and the direction of operation must also be marked.

==Using torque wrenches==

===Precision===
Click type torque wrenches are precise when properly calibrated—however the more complex mechanism can result in loss of calibration sooner than the beam type, where there is little to no malfunction, (however the thin indicator rod can be accidentally bent out of true). Beam type torque wrenches are impossible to use in situations where the scale cannot be directly read—and these situations are common in automotive applications. The scale on a beam type wrench is prone to parallax error, as a result of the large distance between indicator arm and scale (on some older designs). There is also the issue of increased user error with the beam type—the torque has to be read at every use and the operator must use caution to apply loads only at the floating handle&#x27;s pivot point. Dual-beam or &quot;flat&quot; beam versions reduce the tendency for the pointer to rub, as do low-friction pointers.

===Extensions===
The use of cheater bars that extend from the handle end can damage the wrench, so only manufacturer specified equipment should be used.

Using socket extensions requires no adjustment of the torque setting.

Using a crow&#x27;s foot or similar extension requires the use of the following equation:

formula_1

using a combination of handle and crow&#x27;s foot extensions requires the use of the following equation:

formula_2

where:
* formula_3 is the wrench indicated torque (setting torque),
* formula_4 is the desired torque,
* formula_5 is the length of the torque wrench, from the handle to the center of the head,
* formula_6 is the length of the crow&#x27;s foot extension, from the center of the torque wrench head to the center line of the bolt,
* formula_7 is the length of the handle extension, from the extension end to the torque wrench handle.

These equations only apply if the extension is colinear with the length of the torque wrench. In other cases, the distance from the torque wrench&#x27;s head to the bolt&#x27;s head, as if it were in line, should be used. If the extension is set at 90° then no adjustment is required. These methods are not recommended except for extreme circumstances.

===Storage===

For click (or other micrometer) types, when not in use, the force acting on the spring should be removed by setting the scale to its minimum rated value in order to prevent permanent set in the spring.
Never set a micrometer style torque wrench to zero as the internal mechanism requires a small amount of tension in order to prevent components shifting and reduction of accuracy.

===Calibration===
As with any precision tool, torque wrenches should be periodically re-calibrated. As previously stated, according to ISO standards calibration should happen every 5000 operations or every year, whichever comes first. It is possible that torque wrenches can fall up to 10% out of calibration in the first year of use.

Calibration, when performed by a specialist service which follows ISO standards, follows a specific process and constraints. The operation requires specialist torque wrench calibration equipment with an accuracy of ±1% or better. The temperature of the area where calibration is being performed should be between 18 °C and 28 °C with no more than a 1 °C fluctuation and the relative humidity should not exceed 90%.

Before any calibration work can be done, the tool should be preloaded and torqued without measure according to its type. The tool is then connected to the tester and force is applied to the handle (at no more than 10° from perpendicular) for values of 20%, 60% and 100% of the maximum torque and repeated according to their class. The force should be applied slowly and without jerky or irregular motion. The table below gives more specifics regarding the pattern of testing for each class of torque wrench.

While professional calibration is recommended, for some people it would be out of their means. It is possible to calibrate a torque wrench in the home shop or garage. The process generally requires that a certain mass is attached to a lever arm and the torque wrench is set to the appropriate torque to lift said mass. The error within the tool can be calculated and the tool may be able to be altered or any work done adjusted for this error.

<text>The Mist Trail is one of the most popular short hikes in Yosemite National Park, California, USA. The steep hike follows the Merced River, starting at Happy Isles in Yosemite Valley, past Vernal Fall and Emerald Pool, to Nevada Fall.

==Description==
Along the trail, the Merced River is a tumultuous mountain stream, lying in a U-shaped valley. Enormous boulders, some the size of a house, are dwarfed by the sheer faces of exfoliating granite, which rise 3000 feet (914 m) from the river. Through it all, the Merced River rushes down from its source in the High Sierra, and broadens on the floor of Yosemite Valley.

A trail which links to the John Muir Trail starts after crossing from the Happy Isles. Depending on one&#x27;s conditioning, a bridge which re-crosses the river - the halfway point of a hike to the foot of Vernal Fall - can be reached in 15 to 30 minutes.
To the side of Vernal Fall, the mist from the river blankets the trail, which was improved during the WPA projects of the 1930s. Here is where raingear becomes handy: in the spring, hikers often become completely drenched from water sprayed off Vernal Fall. This is one of the few places where a complete circular rainbow can be viewed. 

The trail now crosses a sheer face which is made somewhat easier by a single guard rail. At the top of Vernal Fall, the Merced River traverses a shelf of granite, and the hikers frequently sun themselves to dry off. The Emerald Pool is named for the color of the river here.

Up the trail, Nevada Fall, a waterfall that is almost twice the height of Vernal Fall, awaits the hiker, although there is no cascade of mist over the trail at that waterfall. Behind Nevada Fall is Liberty Cap, an impressive lump of granite. The Mist Trail then rejoins the John Muir Trail: the hiker can travel in Little Yosemite Valley, or take a side trip to the top of Half Dome, using cables to climb the rock. Permits must be obtained in advance to hike Half Dome, and back country permits are required to stay overnight along the John Muir Trail.

The distance from Happy Isles trailhead to the Vernal Fall foot bridge is 0.8 miles (1.3 km) with an elevation gain of 400 ft (120m); to the top of Vernal Fall is 1.2 miles (1.95 km ) with an elevation gain of 1000 ft (300m); and to the top of Nevada Fall is 2.7 miles (4.35 km) one way with an elevation gain of 1900 ft (610m)( data per NPS information).

==Related hikes==
* The Mist Trail is commonly used as the first leg of the hike up Half Dome. Half Dome can also be reached by the John Muir Trail, but this route is longer and less scenic. However, it is less steep than the Mist Trail, which makes it more commonly used for descent. The mist from Vernal Falls can be a significant factor governing the choice between the Mist Trail and John Muir Trail while climbing Half Dome. For instance, the Mist Trail might be very inviting on warm days or something to be avoided on cool days. Also, the Mist Trail is usually more inviting on ascent, as the mist helps to cool hikers while climbing the steep trail.
* The High Sierra Camps provide a loop through the Yosemite backcountry, with tent cabins spaced one day&#x27;s hike apart. These require reservations.
* A panoramic view of the Mist Trail can be had from Glacier Point, 3000 feet (900 m) above, looking north. During the summer, shuttle buses from the floor of the valley will take an hour to arrive at Glacier Point. Hikers have the option of taking a shuttle bus one-way from the valley floor to Glacier Point, then hiking on the Panorama Trail from Glacier Point down to the top of the Mist Trail at Nevada Fall.
* The John Muir Trail starts at the same trailhead as the Mist Trail.

<doc id="361258" wikidata="Q10675" url="?curid=361258" title="River Lea">
<text>The River Lea ( ) is in the East of England and Greater London. It originates in Bedfordshire, in the Chiltern Hills, and flows southeast through Hertfordshire, along the Essex border and into Greater London, to meet the River Thames at Bow Creek. It is one of the largest rivers in London and the easternmost major tributary of the Thames.

The river&#x27;s significance as a major east–west barrier and boundary has tended to obscure its importance as north–south trade route. Below Hertford the river has since medieval times had alterations made to make it more navigable for boats between the Thames and eastern Hertfordshire and Essex, known as the Lee Navigation. This stimulated much industry along its banks. The navigable River Stort, the main tributary, joins it at Hoddesdon.

While the lower Lea remains somewhat polluted, its upper stretch and tributaries, classified as chalk streams, are a major source of drinking water for London. An artificial waterway known as the New River, opened in 1613, abstracts clean water away from the upper stretch of the river near Hertford for drinking. The Lea&#x27;s origin in the Chilterns contributes to the extreme hardness (high mineral content) of London tap water.

==Name==
===Etymology===
The name of the River Lea was first recorded in the 9th century, although is believed to be much older. Spellings from the Anglo-Saxon period include &quot;Lig(e)an&quot; in 880 and &quot;Lygan&quot; in 895, and in the early medieval period it is usually &quot;Luye&quot; or &quot;Leye&quot;. It seems to be derived from a Celtic (brythonic) root &quot;lug&quot;-meaning &#x27;bright or light&#x27; which is also the derivation of a name for a deity, so the meaning may be &#x27;bright river&#x27; or &#x27;river dedicated to the god Lugus&#x27;. A simpler derivation may well be the Brythonic word cognate with the modern Welsh &quot;Li&quot; pronounced &quot;Lea&quot; which means a flow or a current.

Much of the middle Lea were historically known as &#x27;Mereditch&#x27;, the first element deriving from the Old English ‘gemaera’, meaning boundary. This was due to that section of the river’s role as the dividing line between territories, for instance separating Middlesex and Essex. By the 20th century &#x27;Mereditch&#x27; had evolved to &#x27;Mare Dyke&#x27; and referred to just one channel of the river between Chingford and Enfield. The channel was replaced by parts of the Lee Valley Reservoir Chain in the mid 20th century.

The River Lea is the major component in a number of place-names, including Leagrave, the suburb of Luton where the source of the river is located, and of Luton and Leyton: both mean &quot;farmstead on the River Lea&quot;.

===Spelling===
The spelling &quot;Lea&quot; predominates west (upstream) of Hertford, but both spellings (&quot;Lea&quot; and &quot;Lee&quot;) are used from Hertford to the River Thames. The Lee Navigation was established by Acts of Parliament and only that spelling is used in this context. The Lee Valley Regional Park Authority also uses this spelling for leisure facilities. However, the spelling &quot;Lea&quot; is used for road names, locations and other infrastructure in the capital, such as Leamouth, Lea Bridge, the Lea Valley Walk and the Lea Valley lines (railway). This spelling is also used in geology, archaeology, etc. to refer to the Lea Valley.

===Other uses===
The term &quot;River Lea&quot; is Cockney rhyming slang for tea.

==Natural boundary==

The line of the Lea, and its major tributary, the Stort, has long been used as a political boundary. In the Iron Age the Lea and Stort valleys formed a hotly contested frontier zone between the Catuvellauni to the west and the eastern Trinovantes. The two rivers are assumed to have been the boundary between the core territory of the Kingdom of the East Saxons and its Middle Saxon Province. The whole of the Lea was subsequently used as the boundary between English-ruled territory to the west and the Danelaw, established in the late 9th century, to the east.

From around the ninth or tenth century, and the establishment of counties in this part of England, the Lea-Stort line has formed the historic boundary between Essex to the east and Hertfordshire and Middlesex to the west. Within London the river is always used as a boundary between London Boroughs - which in turn inherit more ancient county and parish boundaries which also used the Lea as a boundary. Between 1889 and 1965, the lower Lea was the eastern boundary of the County of London with Essex.

When reviewing the boundaries of London&#x27;s parliamentary constituencies, the Boundary Commission treats the Thames and Lea as London&#x27;s major internal barriers. It will not allow a new or altered constituency that spans either river, viewing such a construct as artificial and not reflective of local communities or identities. They have compromised on this further south, on the lower Lea, where the quality and quantity of cross-river links is much greater, and the communities on either side better integrated as a result.

==Course==
===Upper Lea===
The source of the Lea is usually said to be at Well Head inside Waulud&#x27;s Bank, a neolithic henge at Leagrave Common in Luton, Bedfordshire, although just downstream the river is joined by Houghton Brook, a stream that starts further west in Houghton Regis.

After passing through Luton, the young river passes through the Luton Hoo estate and, six miles from its source, enters Hertfordshire. The river then flows east-south-east through Harpenden, Wheathampstead – once capital of the Catuvellauni tribe – through the narrow green gap between the new towns of Hatfield and Welwyn Garden City, and on to the county town of Hertford.

===Middle Lea===

At Hertford the shallow river turns briefly north before turning to head due south, and here the river and its surrounding areas change significantly. Around Hertford, the Lea is joined by a number of major tributaries: the Mimram, Beane, Rib, Ash, and then the Stort.

This extra volume of water has created a broad flood plain with sometimes steep hills on either side. The river passes through this valley in several channels, which are a result of both human intervention and natural causes. The increased flow made the river navigable from Hertford, a situation improved by the creation of the Lee Navigation, a deep canal which begins at Hertford Castle Weir.

The Stort, the most important tributary of the Lea, joins a short distance from Hertford at Feildes Weir, and is itself navigable as far upstream as Bishops Stortford. The Hertford East railway line passes along the west side of the Lea&#x27;s flood plain, from Hertford to Tottenham, improving the accessibility of the area and contributing to the ribbon development that made the character of the west side of the valley much more developed than the east.
Just after Hertford, the river passes the medieval river port of Ware and the Hertfordshire bank soon becomes entirely developed. On the west bank the river passes Hoddesdon, Broxbourne and Cheshunt in Hertfordshire; then Enfield, Edmonton, Tottenham and Tottenham Marshes in north London. On the eastern side the river passes Waltham Abbey on the largely rural Essex bank, and then Chingford and Walthamstow in east London.

South of Hertford, the river is lined by lakes; to the north these are primarily flooded former gravel pits but in London they are reservoirs: the 13 reservoirs of the Lee Valley Reservoir Chain, fed by the branches of the river known as the River Lee Flood Relief Channel and the River Lee Diversion. These reservoirs come to an end on the boundaries of the London Boroughs of Haringey and Hackney and form part of a broad undeveloped green space, a mile (800 m) wide in places, which extends deep into London.

===Lower Lea===
On Hackney&#x27;s northern edge, the Lea shifts to a south-south-easterly direction, the reservoirs end, but the broad green corridor continues as the river passes through Walthamstow Marshes, Leyton Marshes, Hackney Marshes and the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park. In that park, and just to the south of it, the river&#x27;s course splits, running almost entirely in man-made channels, the Bow Back Rivers. These channels were once much more numerous and originally created to power water mills including, at the southern end, the restored tidal mill called Three Mills. The area around the Bow Back Rivers subsequently became a thriving industrial zone. Around Bow Creek, major industry prevailed, including the Thames Ironworks, Bromley-by-Bow Gasworks and West Ham Power Station. In the 1960s and 1970s, changing economic conditions led to a steep decline and deindustrialisation along this section of the Lea.

The river was historically tidal as far north as Hackney Wick, but now the tide is held back by the Bow Locks between Bromley-by-Bow and West Ham. Although watercraft can follow the Lea down to the Thames, it is generally more practical to follow the Limehouse Cut (which meets the Lea at Bow Locks) down to Limehouse Basin, and use the Limehouse Basin Lock to join the Thames.

The communities on the west side of the lower Lea include Hackney, Bow and Bromley-by-Bow. On the east side, they include southern parts of Walthamstow, then Leyton, Stratford and West Ham. The last few miles of the river are known as Bow Creek and the river meets the Thames between Blackwall (on the west side) and Canning Town (on the east).

==River history==

===Crossings===
In the Roman era, Old Ford, as the name suggests, was the most downstream crossing point of the River Lea. This was part of a pre-Roman route that followed the modern Oxford Street, Old Street, through Bethnal Green to Old Ford and then across a causeway through the marshes known as Wanstead Slip (now in Leyton). The route then continued through Essex to Colchester. At this time, the Lea was a wider river, and the tidal estuary stretched as far as Hackney Wick. Evidence has been found of a late Roman settlement at Old Ford, dating from the 4th and 5th centuries.

In 1110, Matilda, wife of Henry I, reputedly took a tumble at the ford, on her way to Barking Abbey and ordered a distinctively bow-shaped, three-arched, bridge to be built over the River Lea (&quot;The like of which had not been seen before&quot;), at Bow, the first bridge over the lower Lea. The lower Lea was at that time a wide, tidal and unchannelled river, so the construction of the bridge allowed a far greater degree of social and economic integration between Essex on one side and Middlesex (including the City of London) on the other than had been possible before.

Lea Bridge, the second bridge over the lower Lea was built after 1757, to replace the pre-existing ferry. It connected Clapton to the west, and Leyton and Walthamstow to the east. The Iron Bridge carrying the Barking Road over the river to Canning Town was built in 1810. There are significantly more crossings over the more central &quot;Lower Lea&quot;, than there are over the &quot;Middle Lea&quot;.

===Trade and industry===
During the Middle Ages, Temple Mills, Abbey Mills, Old Ford and Bow were the sites of water mills (mainly in ecclesiastic ownership) that supplied flour to the bakers of Stratforde-atte-Bow, and hence bread to the City. It was the channels created for these mills that caused the Bow Back Rivers to be cut through the former Roman stone causeway at Stratford (from which the name is derived).

The River Lea flows through the old brewing and malting centre of Ware, and consequently transport by water was for many years a significant industry based there. Barley was transported into Ware, and malt out via the river, in particular to London. Bargemen born in Ware were given the &quot;freedom of the River Thames&quot; — avoiding the requirement of paying lock dues — as a result of their transport of fresh water and food to London during The Great Plague of 1665–66. A local legend says that dead bodies were brought out of London at that time via the river for burying in Ware, but there is no evidence for this.

The extensive level of waterborne trade led the historian John Stow, writing in 1603, to describe the Lea as “this pleasant and useful river”.

The riverside has hosted a number of major armaments manufacturers, such as the Waltham Abbey Royal Gunpowder Mills, the Royal Small Arms Factory at Enfield Lock (which is now a housing development known as Enfield Island Village) and the Congreve Rocket Factory on the site of Stratford Langthorne Abbey.

===Management of the river===
Improvements were made to the river from 1424, with tolls being levied to compensate the landowners, and in 1571, there were riots after the extension of the River was promoted in a private bill presented to the House of Commons. By 1577, the first lock was established at Waltham Abbey and the river began to be actively managed for navigation.
The New River was constructed in 1613 to take clean water to London, from the Lea and its catchment areas in Hertfordshire and bypass the polluting industries that had developed in the Lea&#x27;s downstream reaches. The artificial channel further reduced the flow to the natural river and by 1767 locks were installed below Hertford Castle Weir on the canalised part of the Lea, now the Lee Navigation with further locks and canalisation taking place during the succeeding centuries. In 1766, work also began on the Limehouse Cut to connect the river, at Bromley-by-Bow, with the Thames at Limehouse Basin.

The Waterworks River, a part of the tidal Bow Back Rivers, has been widened by and canalised to assist with construction of the Olympic Park for the 2012 Summer Olympics. In 2009, Three Mills Lock was installed on the Prescott Channel to maintain water levels on the Lea, within the park at a depth of . This allowed access to the site by 350–tonne barges with the aim that at least half of the material required for construction could be delivered or removed by water.

In January 2024, the River Lea burst its banks as Hackney Wick residents tell of &#x27;knee-high&#x27; flood water. 

===War and conflict===
Millfields Park on the Lea at Hackney, is the reputed site of a victory of Aescwine of Essex over Octa of Kent in 527, which allowed Aescwine to become the first King of Essex. However, the historicity of these events and the very existence of Aescwine are disputed.

Somewhere between 878 and 890, the Treaty of Alfred and Guthrum was drawn up that amongst other things used the course of the Lea to define the border between the Danes and the English. In 894, a force of Danes sailed up the river to Hertford, and in about 895 they built a fortified camp, in the higher reaches of the Lea, about north of London. Alfred the Great saw an opportunity to defeat the Danes and dug a new channel to lower the level of the river, leaving the Danes stranded.

In 1216, during the First Barons&#x27; War, the future Louis VIII of France besieged Hertford Castle for a month, leading to its surrender. He only held the castle for a relatively short time as he lost the war soon after.

In 1648 during the second English Civil War a Royalist force crossed the Thames from Greenwich and hoped to cross Bow Bridge, over the Lea and into Essex. After inconclusive clashes with the Tower Hamlets Militia and other Parliamentarian forces, an engagement known as the Battle of Bow Bridge, the Royalists headed for Colchester and were besieged there.

During WWI, parts of London on either side of the Lea were badly hit by German Army and Navy airship raids. It is believed the crews mistook the extensive reservoir chain for the Thames and released their bombs on what they took to be central London.

==Environmental issues==
The ecological, landscape and recreational importance of the river and its surrounding land has been recognised through inclusion in a number of parks and by several planning policy designations.

===Management and designations===
Much of the river lies within the Lee Valley Park. Some of the land surrounding the river has been designated as Metropolitan Green Belt or Metropolitan Open Land in order to prevent further urbanisation.

===Wildlife===
The river contains fish and other wildlife such as the occasional seal.

Some boat trippers reported observing on 5 August 2005 a Canada goose being pulled underwater very quickly. The London Wildlife Trust suggested that this was most likely caused by a pike.

In 2011, Mike Wells claimed that he saw a &quot;goose go vertically down&quot; in the river. Again a pike or mink was suggested as most likely. Vice Magazine suggested that Wells&#x27; story may have been invented to publicise authorities&#x27; attempts to evict houseboats from the area that year, ahead of the 2012 Olympic Games.

===Pollution===
The river is threatened by pollution, with sewage frequently discharged into the river as well as less common events causing major damage, such as an oil leak in 2018, or the toxic runoff from a warehouse fire in 2019. The sewage pollution, as well as that of fertiliser washed in from agricultural fields causes eutrophication, an excess of nutrients, which not only unbalances the ecosystem, but also leads to de-oxygenation of the water.

Dumping, litter and microplastics are a major problem on the Lea with much of this waste arriving in the river in sewage. In April 2021, Hackney Council wrote to the Environment Agency calling for action to address sewage discharge and pollution in the river. In November 2021, local volunteers stated they were removing 100kg of plastic pollution from the Lower Lea every month.

Water extraction, for drinking water, farming and industry, has led to a reduction in river flow impacting wildlife and concentrating the pollutants present in the remaining river water.

Projects such as that led by Thames21 installing reedbeds help to remove pollutants whilst oxygenating the water, as well as creating habitat for the likes of water voles and improving the aesthetics of the man-made concrete sections of the canalised river.

==Sport==
In their early days, Tottenham Hotspur played their games at Tottenham Marshes on the Middle Lea while Leyton Orient have had a number of home grounds in the Lower Lea Valley, with both having their current grounds within a mile of the river. West Ham United was established as the works team of the Thames Ironworks, a shipyard which straddled either side of the Lea at its confluence with the Thames.

The 2012 Olympics was focused in the Queen Elizabeth Olympic Park on the banks of the Lea, and its main Stadium, on an island between two branches of the river, is now home to West Ham United. The Lee Valley White Water Centre in Hertfordshire is another sporting legacy of the games.

==Narrative accounts==
===London Bridge Is Falling Down===
Various versions of the nursery rhyme London Bridge Is Falling Down make reference to Bow Bridge. The oldest known version could be that recalled by a correspondent to the &quot;Gentleman&#x27;s Magazine&quot; in 1823, in which he claimed to have heard from a woman who was a child in the reign of Charles II (r. 1660–1685) and had the lyrics:

There are a number of theories about the identity of the &quot;Fair Lady&quot;, including the idea that it may refer to Matilda, the builder of Bow Bridge and its neighbours, or that it may apply to the River Lea itself.

===Other===
The poem &quot;A Tale of Two Swannes&quot; is set along the River Lea. It was written by William Vallans and published in 1590.

The old course of the river is the one featured in the early chapters of the classic fishing book &quot;The Compleat Angler&quot; by Izaak Walton. The author begins at Tottenham and proceeds upriver from there.

A guide to walking along the river valley was written by Leigh Hatts, and an account of a walk along the complete length of the river in 2009 was published as a blog by &quot;Diamond Geezer&quot;.

In 2014, German writer Esther Kinsky published a novel, &quot;Am Fluß&quot;, now available in English as &quot;River&quot;, translated by Iain Galbraith, based around her walks along the lower Lea from the marina at Horseshoe Point to its confluence with the Thames.

In 2015, singer-songwriter Adele dedicated a track to the river on her third studio album, &quot;25&quot;.
