<text>Ultrafiltration (UF) is a variety of membrane filtration in which forces such as pressure or concentration gradients lead to a separation through a semipermeable membrane. Suspended solids and solutes of high molecular weight are retained in the so-called retentate, while water and low molecular weight solutes pass through the membrane in the permeate (filtrate). This separation process is used in industry and research for purifying and concentrating macromolecular (103–106 Da) solutions, especially protein solutions.

Ultrafiltration is not fundamentally different from microfiltration. Both of these are separate based on size exclusion or particle capture. It is fundamentally different from membrane gas separation, which separate based on different amounts of absorption and different rates of diffusion. Ultrafiltration membranes are defined by the molecular weight cut-off (MWCO) of the membrane used. Ultrafiltration is applied in cross-flow or dead-end mode.

== Applications ==
Industries such as chemical and pharmaceutical manufacturing, food and beverage processing, and waste water treatment, employ ultrafiltration in order to recycle flow or add value to later products. Blood dialysis also utilizes ultrafiltration.

=== Drinking water ===

Ultrafiltration can be used for the removal of particulates and macromolecules from raw water to produce potable water. It has been used to either replace existing secondary (coagulation, flocculation, sedimentation) and tertiary filtration (sand filtration and chlorination) systems employed in water treatment plants or as standalone systems in isolated regions with growing populations. When treating water with high suspended solids, UF is often integrated into the process, utilising primary (screening, flotation, filtration) and some secondary treatments as pre-treatment stages. UF processes are currently preferred over traditional treatment methods for the following reasons:
:*No chemicals required (aside from cleaning)
:*Constant product quality regardless of feed quality
:*Compact plant size
:*Capable of exceeding regulatory standards of water quality, achieving 90–100% pathogen removal
UF processes are currently limited by the high cost incurred due to membrane fouling and replacement. Additional pretreatment of feed water is required to prevent excessive damage to the membrane units.

In many cases UF is used for pre filtration in reverse osmosis (RO) plants to protect the RO membranes.

=== Protein concentration ===
UF is used extensively in the dairy industry; particularly in the processing of cheese whey to obtain whey protein concentrate (WPC) and lactose-rich permeate. In a single stage, a UF process is able to concentrate the whey 10–30 times the feed.
The original alternative to membrane filtration of whey was using steam heating followed by drum drying or spray drying. The product of these methods had limited applications due to its granulated texture and insolubility. Existing methods also had inconsistent product composition, high capital and operating costs and due to the excessive heat used in drying would often denature some of the proteins.
Compared to traditional methods, UF processes used for this application:
:*Are more energy efficient
:*Have consistent product quality, 35–80% protein product depending on operating conditions
:*Do not denature proteins as they use moderate operating conditions
The potential for fouling is widely discussed, being identified as a significant contributor to decline in productivity. Cheese whey contains high concentrations of calcium phosphate which can potentially lead to scale deposits on the membrane surface. As a result, substantial pretreatment must be implemented to balance pH and temperature of the feed to maintain solubility of calcium salts.
=== Other applications ===
:*Filtration of effluent from paper pulp mill
:*Cheese manufacture, see ultrafiltered milk
:*Removal of some bacteria from milk
:*Process and waste water treatment
:*Enzyme recovery
:*Fruit juice concentration and clarification
:*Dialysis and other blood treatments
:*Desalting and solvent-exchange of proteins (via diafiltration)
:*Laboratory grade manufacturing
:*Radiocarbon dating of bone collagen
:*Recovery of electrodeposition paints
:*Treatment of oil and latex emulsions
:*Recovery of lignin compounds in spent pulping liquors

== Principles ==
The basic operating principle of ultrafiltration uses a pressure induced separation of solutes from a solvent through a semi permeable membrane. The relationship between the applied pressure on the solution to be separated and the flux through the membrane is most commonly described by the Darcy equation: 
:formula_1,
where is the flux (flow rate per membrane area), is the transmembrane pressure (pressure difference between feed and permeate stream), is solvent viscosity and is the total resistance (sum of membrane and fouling resistance).

== Membrane fouling ==
=== Concentration polarization ===
When filtration occurs the local concentration of rejected material at the membrane surface increases and can become saturated. In UF, increased ion concentration can develop an osmotic pressure on the feed side of the membrane. This reduces the effective TMP of the system, therefore reducing permeation rate. The increase in concentrated layer at the membrane wall decreases the permeate flux, due to increase in resistance which reduces the driving force for solvent to transport through membrane surface. CP affects almost all the available membrane separation processes. In RO, the solutes retained at the membrane layer results in higher osmotic pressure in comparison to the bulk stream concentration. So the higher pressures are required to overcome this osmotic pressure. Concentration polarisation plays a dominant role in ultrafiltration as compared to microfiltration because of the small pore size membrane. Concentration polarization differs from fouling as it has no lasting effects on the membrane itself and can be reversed by relieving the TMP. It does however have a significant effect on many types of fouling.

==== Types of fouling ====

==== Types of Foulants ====
The following are the four categories by which foulants of UF membranes can be defined in:
:*&quot;biological substances&quot;
:*&quot;macromolecules&quot;
:*&quot;particulates&quot;
:*&quot;ions&quot;

==== Particulate deposition ====
The following models describe the mechanisms of particulate deposition on the membrane surface and in the pores:
:*&quot;Standard blocking&quot;: macromolecules are uniformly deposited on pore walls
:*&quot;Complete blocking&quot;: membrane pore is completely sealed by a macromolecule
:*&quot;Cake formation&quot;: accumulated particles or macromolecules form a fouling layer on the membrane surface, in UF this is also known as a gel layer
:*&quot;Intermediate blocking&quot;: when macromolecules deposit into pores or onto already blocked pores, contributing to cake formation 

==== Scaling ====
As a result of concentration polarization at the membrane surface, increased ion concentrations may exceed solubility thresholds and precipitate on the membrane surface. These inorganic salt deposits can block pores causing flux decline, membrane degradation and loss of production. The formation of scale is highly dependent on factors affecting both solubility and concentration polarization including pH, temperature, flow velocity and permeation rate.

==== Biofouling ====

Microorganisms will adhere to the membrane surface forming a gel layer – known as biofilm. The film increases the resistance to flow, acting as an additional barrier to permeation. In spiral-wound modules, blockages formed by biofilm can lead to uneven flow distribution and thus increase the effects of concentration polarization.

== Membrane arrangements ==

Depending on the shape and material of the membrane, different modules can be used for ultrafiltration process. Commercially available designs in ultrafiltration modules vary according to the required hydrodynamic and economic constraints as well as the mechanical stability of the system under particular operating pressures. The main modules used in industry include:

===Tubular modules===
The tubular module design uses polymeric membranes cast on the inside of plastic or porous paper components with diameters typically in the range of 5–25 mm with lengths from 0.6–6.4 m. Multiple tubes are housed in a PVC or steel shell. The feed of the module is passed through the tubes, accommodating radial transfer of permeate to the shell side. This design allows for easy cleaning however the main drawback is its low permeability, high volume hold-up within the membrane and low packing density.

=== Hollow fibre ===

This design is conceptually similar to the tubular module with a shell and tube arrangement. A single module can consist of 50 to thousands of hollow fibres and therefore are self-supporting unlike the tubular design. The diameter of each fibre ranges from 0.2–3 mm with the feed flowing in the tube and the product permeate collected radially on the outside. The advantage of having self-supporting membranes as is the ease at which it can be cleaned due to its ability to be backflushed. Replacement costs however are high, as one faulty fibre will require the whole bundle to be replaced. Considering the tubes are of small diameter, using this design also makes the system prone to blockage.

=== Spiral-wound modules ===
Are composed of a combination of flat membrane sheets separated by a thin meshed spacer material which serves as a porous plastic screen support. These sheets are rolled around a central perforated tube and fitted into a tubular steel pressure vessel casing. The feed solution passes over the membrane surface and the permeate spirals into the central collection tube. Spiral-wound modules are a compact and cheap alternative in ultrafiltration design, offer a high volumetric throughput and can also be easily cleaned. However it is limited by the thin channels where feed solutions with suspended solids can result in partial blockage of the membrane pores.

=== Plate and frame ===
This uses a membrane placed on a flat plate separated by a mesh like material. The feed is passed through the system from which permeate is separated and collected from the edge of the plate. Channel length can range from 10–60 cm and channel heights from 0.5–1.0 mm. This module provides low volume hold-up, relatively easy replacement of the membrane and the ability to feed viscous solutions because of the low channel height, unique to this particular design.

== Process characteristics ==
The process characteristics of a UF system are highly dependent on the type of membrane used and its application. Manufacturers&#x27; specifications of the membrane tend to limit the process to the following typical specifications:
== Process design considerations ==
When designing a new membrane separation facility or considering its integration into an existing plant, there are many factors which must be considered. For most applications a heuristic approach can be applied to determine many of these characteristics to simplify the design process. Some design areas include:

=== Pre-treatment ===
Treatment of feed prior to the membrane is essential to prevent damage to the membrane and minimize the effects of fouling which greatly reduce the efficiency of the separation. Types of pre-treatment are often dependent on the type of feed and its quality. For example, in wastewater treatment, household waste and other particulates are screened. Other types of pre-treatment common to many UF processes include pH balancing and coagulation. Appropriate sequencing of each pre-treatment phase is crucial in preventing damage to subsequent stages. Pre-treatment can even be employed simply using dosing points.

=== Membrane specifications ===

==== Material ====
Most UF membranes use polymer materials (polysulfone, polypropylene, cellulose acetate, polylactic acid) however ceramic membranes are used for high temperature applications.

==== Pore size ====
A general rule for choice of pore size in a UF system is to use a membrane with a pore size one tenth that of the particle size to be separated. This limits the number of smaller particles entering the pores and adsorbing to the pore surface. Instead they block the entrance to the pores allowing simple adjustments of cross-flow velocity to dislodge them.

=== Operation strategy ===

==== Flowtype ====
UF systems can either operate with cross-flow or dead-end flow. In dead-end filtration the flow of the feed solution is perpendicular to the membrane surface. On the other hand, in cross flow systems the flow passes parallel to the membrane surface. Dead-end configurations are more suited to batch processes with low suspended solids as solids accumulate at the membrane surface therefore requiring frequent backflushes and cleaning to maintain high flux. Cross-flow configurations are preferred in continuous operations as solids are continuously flushed from the membrane surface resulting in a thinner cake layer and lower resistance to permeation.

==== Flow velocity ====
Flow velocity is especially critical for hard water or liquids containing suspensions in preventing excessive fouling. Higher cross-flow velocities can be used to enhance the sweeping effect across the membrane surface therefore preventing deposition of macromolecules and colloidal material and reducing the effects of concentration polarization. Expensive pumps are however required to achieve these conditions.

==== Flow temperature ====
To avoid excessive damage to the membrane, it is recommended to operate a plant at the temperature specified by the membrane manufacturer. In some instances however temperatures beyond the recommended region are required to minimise the effects of fouling. Economic analysis of the process is required to find a compromise between the increased cost of membrane replacement and productivity of the separation.

==== Pressure ====
Pressure drops over multi-stage separation can result in a drastic decline in flux performance in the latter stages of the process. This can be improved using booster pumps to increase the TMP in the final stages. This will incur a greater capital and energy cost which will be offset by the improved productivity of the process. With a multi-stage operation, retentate streams from each stage are recycled through the previous stage to improve their separation efficiency.

==== Multi-stage, multi-module ====
Multiple stages in series can be applied to achieve higher purity permeate streams. Due to the modular nature of membrane processes, multiple modules can be arranged in parallel to treat greater volumes.

=== Post-treatment ===
Post-treatment of the product streams is dependent on the composition of the permeate and retentate and its end-use or government regulation. In cases such as milk separation both streams (milk and whey) can be collected and made into useful products. Additional drying of the retentate will produce whey powder. In the paper mill industry, the retentate (non-biodegradable organic material) is incinerated to recover energy and permeate (purified water) is discharged into waterways. It is essential for the permeate water to be pH balanced and cooled to avoid thermal pollution of waterways and altering its pH.

=== Cleaning ===
Cleaning of the membrane is done regularly to prevent the accumulation of foulants and reverse the degrading effects of fouling on permeability and selectivity. 
Regular backwashing is often conducted every 10 min for some processes to remove cake layers formed on the membrane surface. By pressurising the permeate stream and forcing it back through the membrane, accumulated particles can be dislodged, improving the flux of the process. Backwashing is limited in its ability to remove more complex forms of fouling such as biofouling, scaling or adsorption to pore walls.
These types of foulants require chemical cleaning to be removed. The common types of chemicals used for cleaning are:
:*Acidic solutions for the control of inorganic scale deposits
:*Alkali solutions for removal of organic compounds
:*Biocides or disinfection such as chlorine or peroxide when bio-fouling is evident

When designing a cleaning protocol it is essential to consider:
Cleaning time – Adequate time must be allowed for chemicals to interact with foulants and permeate into the membrane pores. However, if the process is extended beyond its optimum duration it can lead to denaturation of the membrane and deposition of removed foulants. The complete cleaning cycle including rinses between stages may take as long as 2 hours to complete.
Aggressiveness of chemical treatment – With a high degree of fouling it may be necessary to employ aggressive cleaning solutions to remove fouling material. However, in some applications this may not be suitable if the membrane material is sensitive, leading to enhanced membrane ageing. 
Disposal of cleaning effluent – The release of some chemicals into wastewater systems may be prohibited or regulated therefore this must be considered. For example, the use of phosphoric acid may result in high levels of phosphates entering water ways and must be monitored and controlled to prevent eutrophication.

Summary of common types of fouling and their respective chemical treatments 
== New developments ==
In order to increase the life-cycle of membrane filtration systems, energy efficient membranes are being developed in membrane bioreactor systems. Technology has been introduced which allows the power required to aerate the membrane for cleaning to be reduced whilst still maintaining a high flux level. Mechanical cleaning processes have also been adopted using granulates as an alternative to conventional forms of cleaning; this reduces energy consumption and also reduces the area required for filtration tanks.

Membrane properties have also been enhanced to reduce fouling tendencies by modifying surface properties. This can be noted in the biotechnology industry where membrane surfaces have been altered in order to reduce the amount of protein binding. Ultrafiltration modules have also been improved to allow for more membrane for a given area without increasing its risk of fouling by designing more efficient module internals.

The current pre-treatment of seawater desulphonation uses ultrafiltration modules that have been designed to withstand high temperatures and pressures whilst occupying a smaller footprint. Each module vessel is self supported and resistant to corrosion and accommodates easy removal and replacement of the module without the cost of replacing the vessel itself.

<text>Microfiltration is a type of physical filtration process where a contaminated fluid is passed through a special pore-sized membrane filter to separate microorganisms and suspended particles from process liquid. It is commonly used in conjunction with various other separation processes such as ultrafiltration and reverse osmosis to provide a product stream which is free of undesired contaminants.

==General principles==

Microfiltration usually serves as a pre-treatment for other separation processes such as ultrafiltration, and a post-treatment for granular media filtration. The typical particle size used for microfiltration ranges from about 0.1 to 10 μm. In terms of approximate molecular weight these membranes can separate macromolecules of molecular weights generally less than 100,000 g/mol. The filters used in the microfiltration process are specially designed to prevent particles such as, sediment, algae, protozoa or large bacteria from passing through a specially designed filter. More microscopic, atomic or ionic materials such as water (H2O), monovalent species such as Sodium (Na+) or Chloride (Cl−) ions, dissolved or natural organic matter, and small colloids and viruses will still be able to pass through the filter.

The suspended liquid is passed through at a relatively high velocity of around 1–3 m/s and at low to moderate pressures (around 100-400 kPa) parallel or tangential to the semi-permeable membrane in a sheet or tubular form. A pump is commonly fitted onto the processing equipment to allow the liquid to pass through the membrane filter. There are also two pump configurations, either pressure driven or vacuum. A differential or regular pressure gauge is commonly attached to measure the pressure drop between the outlet and inlet streams. See Figure 1 for a general setup.

The most abundant use of microfiltration membranes are in the water, beverage and bio-processing industries (see below). The exit process stream after treatment using a micro-filter has a recovery rate which generally ranges to about 90-98 %.

==Range of applications==

===Water treatment===
Perhaps the most prominent use of microfiltration membranes pertains to the treatment of potable water supplies. The membranes are a key step in the primary disinfection of the uptake water stream. Such a stream might contain pathogens such as the protozoa Cryptosporidium and Giardia lamblia which are responsible for numerous disease outbreaks. Both species show a gradual resistance to traditional disinfectants (i.e. chlorine). The use of MF membranes presents a physical means of separation (a barrier) as opposed to a chemical alternative. In that sense, both filtration and disinfection take place in a single step, negating the extra cost of chemical dosage and the corresponding equipment (needed for handling and storage).

Similarly, the MF membranes are used in secondary wastewater effluents to remove turbidity but also to provide treatment for disinfection. At this stage, coagulants (iron or aluminum) may potentially be added to precipitate species such as phosphorus and arsenic which would otherwise have been soluble.

===Sterilization===
Another crucial application of MF membranes lies in the cold sterilisation of beverages and pharmaceuticals. Historically, heat was used to sterilize refreshments such as juice, wine and beer in particular, however a palatable loss in flavour was clearly evident upon heating. Similarly, pharmaceuticals have been shown to lose their effectiveness upon heat addition. MF membranes are employed in these industries as a method to remove bacteria and other undesired suspensions from liquids, a procedure termed as &#x27;cold sterilisation&#x27;, which negate the use of heat.

===Petroleum refining===
Furthermore, microfiltration membranes are finding increasing use in areas such as petroleum refining, in which the removal of particulates from flue gases is of particular concern. The key challenges/requirements for this technology are the ability of the membrane modules to withstand high temperatures (i.e. maintain stability), but also the design must be such to provide a very thin sheeting (thickness &lt; 2000 angstroms) to facilitate an increase of flux. In addition the modules must have a low fouling profile and most importantly, be available at a low-cost for the system to be financially viable.

===Dairy processing===
Aside from the above applications, MF membranes have found dynamic use in major areas within the dairy industry, particularly for milk and whey processing. The MF membranes aid in the removal of bacteria and the associated spores from milk, by rejecting the harmful species from passing through. This is also a precursor for pasteurisation, allowing for an extended shelf-life of the product. However, the most promising technique for MF membranes in this field pertains to the separation of casein from whey proteins (i.e. serum milk proteins). This results in two product streams both of which are highly relied on by consumers; a casein-rich concentrate stream used for cheese making, and a whey/serum protein stream which is further processed (using ultrafiltration) to make whey protein concentrate. The whey protein stream undergoes further filtration to remove fat in order to achieve higher protein content in the final WPC (Whey Protein Concentrate) and WPI (Whey Protein Isolate) powders.

===Other applications===

Other common applications utilising microfiltration as a major separation process include
* Clarification and purification of cell broths where macromolecules are to be separated from other large molecules, proteins, or cell debris.
* Other biochemical and bio-processing applications such as clarification of dextrose.
* Production of Paints and Adhesives.

==Characteristics of main process==
Membrane filtration processes can be distinguished by three major characteristics: driving force, retentate stream and permeate streams. The microfiltration process is pressure driven with suspended particles and water as retentate and dissolved solutes plus water as permeate. The use of hydraulic pressure accelerates the separation process by increasing the flow rate (flux) of the liquid stream but does not affect the chemical composition of the species in the retentate and product streams.

A major characteristic that limits the performance of microfiltration or any membrane technology is a process known as fouling. Fouling describes the deposition and accumulation of feed components such as suspended particles, impermeable dissolved solutes or even permeable solutes, on the membrane surface and or within the pores of the membrane. Fouling of the membrane during the filtration processes decreases the flux and thus overall efficiency of the operation. This is indicated when the pressure drop increases to a certain point. It occurs even when operating parameters are constant (pressure, flow rate, temperature and concentration) Fouling is mostly irreversible although a portion of the fouling layer can be reversed by cleaning for short periods of time.

===Membrane configurations===
Microfiltration membranes can generally operate in one of two configurations.

Cross-flow filtration: where the fluid is passed through tangentially with respect to the membrane. Part of the feed stream containing the treated liquid is collected below the filter while parts of the water are passed through the membrane untreated. Cross flow filtration is understood to be a unit operation rather than a process. &quot;Refer to Figure 2 for a general schematic for the process.&quot;

Dead-end filtration; all of the process fluid flows and all particles larger than the pore sizes of the membrane are stopped at its surface. All of the feed water is treated at once subject to cake formation. This process is mostly used for batch or semicontinuous filtration of low concentrated solutions. &quot;Refer to Figure 3 for a general schematic for this process.&quot;

==Process and equipment design==

The major issues that influence the selection of the membrane include

===Site-specific issues===

* and demand of the facility.
* Percentage recovery and rejection.
* Fluid characteristics (viscosity, turbidity, density)
* Quality of the fluid to be treated
* Pre-treatment processes

===Membrane specific issues===

* Cost of material procurement and manufacture
* Operating temperature
* Trans-membrane pressure
* Membrane flux
* Handling fluid characteristics (viscosity, turbidity, density)
* Monitoring and maintenance of the system
* Cleaning and treatment
* Disposal of process residuals

==Process design variables==

* Operation and control of all processes in the system
* Materials of construction
* Equipment and instrumentation (controllers, sensors) and their cost.

===Fundamental design heuristics===

A few important design heuristics and their assessment are discussed below:

* When treating raw contaminated fluids, hard sharp materials can wear and tear the porous cavities in the micro-filter, rendering it ineffective. Liquids must be subjected to pre-treatment before passage through the micro-filter. This may be achieved by a variation of macro separation processes such as screening, or granular media filtration.
* When undertaking cleaning regimes the membrane must not dry out once it has been contacted by the process stream. Thorough water rinsing of the membrane modules, pipelines, pumps and other unit connections should be carried out until the end water appears clean.
* Microfiltration modules are typically set to operate at pressures of 100 to 400 kPa. Such pressures allow removal of materials such as sand, slits and clays, and also bacteria and protozoa.
* When the membrane modules are being used for the first time, i.e. during plant start-up, conditions need to be well devised. Generally a slow-start is required when the feed is introduced into the modules, since even slight perturbations above the critical flux will result in irreversible fouling.

Like any other membranes, microfiltration membranes are prone to fouling. &quot;(See Figure 4 below)&quot; It is therefore necessary that regular maintenance be carried out to prolong the life of the membrane module.

* Routine &#x27;backwashing&#x27;, is used to achieve this. Depending on the specific application of the membrane, backwashing is carried out in short durations (typically 3 to 180 s) and in moderately frequent intervals (5 min to several hours). Turbulent flow conditions with Reynolds numbers greater than 2100, ideally between 3000 - 5000 should be used. This should not however be confused with &#x27;backflushing&#x27;, a more rigorous and thorough cleaning technique, commonly practiced in cases of particulate and colloidal fouling.
* When major cleaning is needed to remove entrained particles, a CIP (Clean In Place) technique is used. Cleaning agents/detergents, such as sodium hypochlorite, citric acid, caustic soda or even special enzymes are typically used for this purpose. The concentration of these chemicals is dependent on the type of the membrane (its sensitivity to strong chemicals), but also the type of matter (e.g. scaling due to the presence of calcium ions) to be removed.
* Another method to increase the lifespan of the membrane may be feasible to design two microfiltration membranes in . The first filter would be used for pre-treatment of the liquid passing through the membrane, where larger particles and deposits are captured on the cartridge. The second filter would act as an extra &quot;check&quot; for particles which are able to pass through the first membrane as well as provide screening for particles on the lower spectrum of the range.

===Design economics===

The cost to design and manufacture a membrane per unit of area are about 20% less compared to the early 1990s and in a general sense are constantly declining. Microfiltration membranes are more advantageous in comparison to conventional systems. Microfiltration systems do not require expensive extraneous equipment such as flocculates, addition of chemicals, flash mixers, settling and filter basins. However the cost of replacement of capital equipment costs (membrane cartridge filters etc.) might still be relatively high as the equipment may be manufactured specific to the application. Using the design heuristics and general plant design principles (mentioned above), the membrane life-span can be increased to reduce these costs.

Through the design of more intelligent process control systems and efficient plant designs some general tips to reduce operating costs are listed below

* Running plants at reduced fluxes or pressures at low load periods (winter)
* Taking plant systems off-line for short periods when the feed conditions are extreme.
* A short shutdown period (approximately 1 hour) during the first flush of a river after rainfall (in water treatment applications) to reduce cleaning costs in the initial period.
* The use of more cost effective cleaning chemicals where suitable (sulphuric acid instead of citric/ phosphoric acids.)
* The use of a flexible control design system. Operators are able to manipulate variables and setpoints to achieve maximum cost savings.

Table 1 (below) expresses an indicative guide of membrane filtration capital and operating costs per unit of flow.

Note:

* &quot;Capital Costs are based on dollars per gallon of the treatment plant capacity&quot;
* Design flow is measured in millions of gallons per day.
* Membrane Costs only (No Pre-Treatment or Post-Treatment equipment considered in this table)
* Operating and Annual costs, are based on dollars per thousand gallons treated.
* All prices are in US dollars current of 2009, and is not adjusted for inflation.&quot;

===Process equipment===

====Membrane materials====

The materials which constitute the membranes used in microfiltration systems may be either organic or inorganic depending upon the contaminants that are desired to be removed, or the type of application.

* Organic membranes are made using a diverse range of polymers including cellulose acetate (CA), polysulfone, polyvinylidene fluoride, polyethersulfone and polyamide. These are most commonly used due to their flexibility, and chemical properties.
* Inorganic membranes are usually composed of sintered metal or porous alumina. They are able to be designed in various shapes, with a range of average pore sizes and permeability.

====Membrane structures====

General Membrane structures for microfiltration include

* Screen filters (Particles and matter which are of the same size or larger than the screen openings are retained by the process and are collected on the surface of the screen)
* Depth filters (Matter and particles are embedded within the constrictions within the filter media, the filter surface contains larger particles, smaller particles are captured in a narrower and deeper section of the filter media.)

====Membrane modules====
;Plate and frame (flat sheet)
Membrane modules for dead-end flow microfiltration are mainly plate-and-frame configurations. They possess a flat and thin-film composite sheet where the plate is asymmetric. A thin selective skin is supported on a thicker layer that has larger pores. These systems are compact and possess a sturdy design, Compared to cross-flow filtration, plate and frame configurations possess a reduced capital expenditure; however the operating costs will be higher. The uses of plate and frame modules are most applicable for smaller and simpler scale applications (laboratory) which filter dilute solutions.

;Spiral-wound
This particular design is used for cross-flow filtration. The design involves a pleated membrane which is folded around a perforated permeate core, akin to a spiral, that is usually placed within a pressure vessel. This particular design is preferred when the solutions handled is heavily concentrated and in conditions of high temperatures and extreme pH. This particular configuration is generally used in more large scale industrial applications of microfiltration.

;Hollow fiber
This design involves bundling several hundred to several thousand hollow fiber membranes in a tube filter housing. Feed water is delivered into the membrane module. It passes through from the outside surface of the hollow fibers and the filtered water exits through the center of the fibers. With the flux rate in excess of 75 gallon per square foot per day, this design can be used for large scale facilities.

===Fundamental design equations===

As separation is achieved by sieving, the principal mechanism of transfer for microfiltration through micro porous membranes is bulk flow.

Generally, due to the small diameter of the pores the flow within the process is laminar (Reynolds Number &lt; 2100) The flow velocity of the fluid moving through the pores can thus be determined (by Hagen-Poiseuille&#x27;s equation), the simplest of which assuming a parabolic velocity profile.

:formula_1

Transmembrane Pressure (TMP)

The transmembrane pressure (TMP) is defined as the mean of the applied pressure from the feed to the concentrate side of the membrane subtracted by the pressure of the permeate. This is applied to dead-end filtration mainly and is indicative of whether a system is fouled sufficiently to warrant replacement.

:formula_2

Where

* formula_3 is the pressure on the Feed Side
* formula_4 is the pressure of the Concentrate
* formula_5 is the pressure of the Permeate

Permeate Flux

The permeate flux in microfiltration is given by the following relation, based on Darcy&#x27;s Law

:formula_6

Where
* formula_7 = Permeate membrane flow resistance (formula_8)
* formula_9 = Permeate cake resistance (formula_8)
* μ = Permeate viscosity (kg m-1 s-1)
* ∆P = Pressure Drop between the cake and membrane

The cake resistance is given by:

:formula_11

Where

* r = Specific cake resistance (m-2)
* Vs = Volume of cake (m3)
* AM = Area of membrane (m2)

For micron sized particles the Specific Cake Resistance is roughly.

:formula_12

Where
* ε = Porosity of cake (unitless)
* d_s = Mean particle diameter (m)

Rigorous design equations

To give a better indication regarding the exact determination of the extent of the cake formation, one-dimensional quantitative models have been formulated to determine factors such as

* Complete Blocking (Pores with an initial radius less than the radius of the pore)
* Standard Blocking
* Sublayer Formation
* Cake Formation

==Environmental issues, safety and regulation==

Although environmental impacts of membrane filtration processes differ according to the application, a generic method of evaluation is the life-cycle assessment (LCA), a tool for the analysis of the environmental burden of membrane filtration processes at all stages and accounts for all types of impacts upon the environment including emission to land, water and air.

In regards to microfiltration processes, there are a number of potential environmental impacts to be considered. They include global warming potential, photo-oxidant formation potential, eutrophication potential, human toxicity potential, freshwater ecotoxicity potential, marine ecotoxicity potential and terrestrial ecotoxicity potential. In general, the potential environmental impact of the process is largely dependent on flux and the maximum transmembrane pressure, however other operating parameters remain a factor to be considered. A specific comment on which exact combination of operational condition will yield the lowest burden on the environment cannot be made as each application will require different optimisations.

In a general sense, membrane filtration processes are relative &quot;low risk&quot; operations, that is, the potential for dangerous hazards are small. There are, however several aspects to be mindful of. All pressure-driven filtration processes including microfiltration requires a degree of pressure to be applied to the feed liquid stream as well as imposed electrical concerns. Other factors contributing to safety are dependent on parameters of the process. For example, processing dairy product will lead to bacteria formations that must be controlled to comply with safety and regulatory standards.

==Comparison with similar processes==

Membrane microfiltration is fundamentally the same as other filtration techniques utilising a pore size distribution to physically separate particles. It is analogous to other technologies such as ultra/nanofiltration and reverse osmosis, however, the only difference exists in the size of the particles retained, and also the osmotic pressure. The main of which are described in general below:

===Ultrafiltration===

Ultrafiltration membranes have pore sizes ranging from 0.1 μm to 0.01 μm and are able to retain proteins, endotoxins, viruses and silica. UF has diverse applications which span from waste water treatment to pharmaceutical applications.

===Nanofiltration===

Nanofiltration membranes have pores sized from 0.001 μm to 0.01 μm and filters multivalent ions, synthetic dyes, sugars and specific salts. As the pore size drops from MF to NF, the osmotic pressure requirement increases.

===Reverse osmosis===

Reverse osmosis (RO) is the finest separation membrane process available, pore sizes range from 0.0001 μm to 0.001 μm. Reverse osmosis is able to retain almost all molecules except for water, and due to the size of the pores, the required osmotic pressure is significantly greater than that for microfiltration. Both reverse osmosis and nanofiltration are fundamentally different from microfiltration since the flow goes against the concentration gradient, because those systems use pressure as a means of forcing water to go from low osmotic pressure to high osmotic pressure.

==Recent developments==

Recent advances in MF have focused on manufacturing processes for the construction of membranes and additives to promote coagulation and therefore reduce the fouling of the membrane. Since MF, UF, NF and RO are closely related, these advances are applicable to multiple processes and not MF alone.

Recently studies have shown dilute KMnO4 preoxidation combined FeCl3 is able to promote coagulation, leading to decreased fouling, in specific the KMnO4 preoxidation exhibited an effect which decreased irreversible membrane fouling.

Similar research has been done into the construction high flux poly(trimethylene terephthalate) (PTT) nanofiber membranes, focusing on increased throughput. Specialised heat treatment and manufacturing processes of the membrane&#x27;s internal structure exhibited results indicating a 99.6% rejection rate of TiO2 particles under high flux. The results indicate that this technology may be applied to existing applications to increase their efficiency via high flux membranes.

<text>Tribune Media Company, also known as Tribune Company, was an American multimedia conglomerate headquartered in Chicago, Illinois.

Through Tribune Broadcasting, Tribune Media was one of the largest television broadcasting companies, owning 39 television stations across the United States and operating three additional stations through local marketing agreements. It owned national basic cable channel/superstation WGN America, regional cable news channel Chicagoland Television (CLTV) and Chicago radio station WGN. Investment interests include the Food Network, in which the company had a 31% share.

Prior to the August 2014 spin-off of the company&#x27;s publishing division into Tribune Publishing, Tribune Media was the nation&#x27;s second-largest newspaper publisher behind the Gannett Company, with ten daily newspapers, including the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; and &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, and several commuter tabloids.

In 2007, investors bought the company, taking on substantial debt. The subsequent 2008 bankruptcy of Tribune Company was the largest bankruptcy in the history of the American media industry. In December 2012 the Tribune Co. emerged from bankruptcy. Tribune announced its sale to Hunt Valley, Maryland-based Sinclair Broadcast Group on May 8, 2017, but on August 9, 2018, Tribune cancelled the sale and sued Sinclair for breach of contract. On December 3, 2018, Nexstar Media Group announced that it would merge with Tribune Media for $4.1 billion. Within Nexstar, Tribune Media remains the license holder for all of the former Tribune stations retained directly by Nexstar after the Nexstar acquisition. The largest broadcast merger in U.S. history was approved in 2019.

==History==
===Print pioneer===
The Tribune Company was founded on June 10, 1847 when the eponymous &quot;Chicago Daily Tribune&quot; published its first edition in a one-room plant located at LaSalle and Lake Streets in downtown Chicago. The original press run consisted of 400 copies printed on a hand press. The &quot;Tribune&quot; constructed its first building, a four-story structure at Dearborn and Madison Streets, in 1869. The building was destroyed in the Great Chicago Fire of October 1871, along with most of the city. The &quot;Tribune&quot; resumed printing two days later with an editorial declaring &quot;Chicago Shall Rise Again.&quot; Joseph Medill, a native Ohioan who acquired an interest in the &quot;Tribune&quot; in 1855, gained full control of the newspaper in 1874 and ran it until his death in 1899.

Medill&#x27;s two grandsons, cousins Robert R. McCormick and Joseph Medill Patterson, assumed leadership in 1911. That same year, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s first newsprint mill opened in Thorold, Ontario, Canada. The mill marked the beginnings of the Canadian newsprint producer later known as QUNO, in which Tribune held an investment interest until 1995.

Patterson established the company&#x27;s second newspaper, the &quot;New York News&quot; in 1919. Tribune&#x27;s ownership of the New York City tabloid was considered &quot;interlocking&quot; due to an agreement between McCormick and Patterson.

The paper launched a European edition during World War I. To compete with the &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; and &quot;Collier&#x27;s&quot; in 1924, the Tribune Company launched a weekly national magazine, &quot;Liberty&quot;, run by a subsidiary, McCormick-Patterson.

===Move into broadcasting===

The company entered broadcasting in 1924 by leasing WDAP, one of Chicago&#x27;s first radio stations. Tribune later changed the station&#x27;s call letters to WGN, reflecting the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s nickname, &quot;World&#x27;s Greatest Newspaper.&quot; WGN was purchased by the company in 1926 and went on to become prominent in the radio industry.

In 1925, the company completed its new headquarters, the Tribune Tower. That same year, the company decided to fund the future Joseph Medill School of Journalism at Northwestern University.

&quot;Liberty&quot; magazine eventually exceeded Collier&#x27;s circulation, but lacked sufficient advertising and was sold in 1931. The Tribune&#x27;s European edition was also cut. However, Tribune launched the Chicago Tribune-New York News Syndicate content syndication service in 1933.

With the death of Joe Patterson&#x27;s sister and owner of the &quot;Washington Times-Herald&quot;, Eleanor (Cissy) Patterson, in 1948, the Tribune Company purchased the paper and operated it until 1954, when the &quot;Times-Herald&quot; was absorbed by &quot;The Washington Post&quot;. Expecting a printer&#x27;s strike in November 1948, the &quot;Tribune&quot; printed their paper early, mistakenly proclaiming &quot;Dewey Defeats Truman&quot; in the 1948 presidential election. Tribune entered the television industry then in its infancy, in 1948, with the establishment of WGN-TV in Chicago in April and WPIX in New York City in June of that year. In 1956, the Tribune Company purchased the &quot;Chicago American&quot; from William Randolph Hearst.

In the 1960s, the company entered the booming Florida market, acquiring the Fort Lauderdale-based Gore Newspapers Company, owner of the Pompano-based &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; and &quot;Fort Lauderdale News&quot; in 1963 and the Sentinel-Star Company, owners of the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot;, in 1965. Also in 1963, the company purchased part of the defunct &quot;New York Mirror&quot;. The company increased its broadcast holdings with the acquisition of radio station WQCD-FM in New York City in 1964 and independent television station KWGN-TV in Denver in 1965. In 1967, the company began printing a tabloid serving suburban areas of Chicago, &quot;The Suburban Trib&quot;.

The corporation was reorganized in 1968 by reincorporating under Delaware&#x27;s General Corporation Law, ending its Illinois incorporation, splitting its stock by four for one and forming a separate subsidiary of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;.

The 1970s brought another decade of acquisitions for the company including the purchase of a Los Angeles shopper in 1973, which became the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot;. In 1973, the company began sharing stories among 25 subscribers via the newly formed news service, the Knight News Wire. By 1990, this service was known as KRT (Knight-Ridder/Tribune) and provided graphics, photo and news content to its member newspapers. When The McClatchy Company purchased Knight-Ridder Inc. in 2006, KRT became MCT (McClatchy-Tribune Information Services), which was jointly owned by the Tribune Company and McClatchy.

The company stopped publishing the tabloid &quot;Chicago Today&quot; in 1974; the Tribune also began publishing all-day editions. An approval of changes to the Tribune bylaws in 1974 triggered a lawsuit by shareholders who saw this as a move towards taking the company public. The lawsuit by Josephine Albright – Joseph Patterson&#x27;s daughter – and her son, Joseph Albright, was dismissed in 1979.

The Tribune Company entered first-run television syndication in 1975 with the debut of the &quot;U.S. Farm Report&quot;. The &quot;Times-Advocate&quot; in Escondido, California was purchased by the company in 1977. In October 1978, United Video Satellite Group uplinked WGN-TV&#x27;s signal to satellite, becoming a national &quot;superstation&quot;, joining the ranks of WTCG (later WTBS, now WPCH-TV) in Atlanta and WWOR-TV in New York City. During 1978, the &quot;New York Daily News&quot; saw multiple employee strikes.

In 1980, the &quot;Daily News&quot; added an afternoon edition to go head-to-head with the &quot;New York Post&quot;; this expansion failed, with the newspaper reverting to once-daily editions with the end of the afternoon edition in 1981. Also that year, the &quot;Independent Network News&quot;, an evening newscast intended for independent stations, was launched as the company&#x27;s second syndicated television program, originating from WPIX. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; was put up for sale in 1981, but a proposed deal fell through by 1982. In August of that year, Tribune purchased the Chicago Cubs Major League Baseball team from William Wrigley III.

In 1981, all of Tribune&#x27;s television stations, which were previously under the WGN Continental Broadcasting unit, were placed under the company&#x27;s subsidiary Tribune Broadcasting Company. The following year, Tribune formed the Tribune Entertainment Company as a production subsidiary to produce the company&#x27;s existing syndicated programs including the &quot;U.S. Farm Report&quot;, as well as newer shows.

===Public corporation===
In 1983, &quot;The Suburban Trib&quot; was replaced by zone editions of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. That October, the Tribune Company became a public firm, with the sale of 7.7 million shares at $26.75 a share. In 1985, Tribune Broadcasting acquired Los Angeles independent station KTLA from Kohlberg Kravis Roberts for a record $510 million. Because of the Federal Communications Commission&#x27;s media cross-ownership regulations, which prohibit the ownership of a television station and newspaper in the same market, Tribune was forced to sell the &quot;Los Angeles Daily News&quot;. With the purchase of KTLA, Tribune became the fourth largest television station owner in the United States, behind the three major broadcast networks. The company acquired Newport News, Virginia newspaper, the &quot;Daily Press&quot; in 1986, but sold off the newspaper&#x27;s co-owned cable television operations.

To counteract a possible hostile corporate takeover in 1987, the Tribune Company developed a plan that allowed shareholders the right to purchase additional preferred shares from a new series of stock in the event that a buyer acquired 10% of the company&#x27;s common stock or a tender offer for the company. Shareholders also ratified a two-for-one stock split. Tribune Entertainment experienced success in 1987 with the launch of the syndicated daytime talk show &quot;Geraldo&quot;. In 1988, Tribune purchased five weekly papers based in Santa Clara County, California. In the wake of a dispute with some of its labor unions, Tribune sold the &quot;Daily News&quot; to British businessman Robert Maxwell in 1991.

With changes in the media industry due to greater public access to the internet in the 1990s, Tribune Publishing began to sell off some of its newspaper properties. Tribune Broadcasting steadily acquired additional stations during the decade, while Tribune itself launched two new divisions, Tribune Ventures and Tribune Education. In 1993, Tribune Broadcasting launched Chicagoland Television (CLTV), a 24-hour local cable news channel for the Chicago area.

Online editions of Tribune&#x27;s newspapers were developed starting in 1995, with the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s digital edition launching in 1996. Also in 1996, Tribune (holding a 20% interest) created a joint venture with American Online (which held an 80% interest) called Digital City, Inc. to set up a series of Digital City websites to provide interactive local news and information services. By 1997, Tribune Publishing had only four daily newspapers remaining in its portfolio: the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Fort Lauderdale Sun-Sentinel&quot;, the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; and the &quot;Daily Press&quot;. Tribune also set up its Tribune Ventures division to acquire stakes in newer media businesses. During the middle of that year, Tribune Ventures purchased interests in companies such as AOL (owning 4%), electronic payment specialist CheckFree Corporation (owning 5%), search engine company Excite, Inc. (owning 7%), Mercury Mail, Inc. (owning 13%), Open Market, Inc. (owning 6%), and Peapod LP (owning 13%). Also that year, the &quot;Orlando Sentinel&quot; and Time Warner Cable joined together to create the Orlando-based local cable news channel, Central Florida News 13. Tribune also purchased a 31% stake in the Food Network.

The company began the 1990s with six television stations, but changes to federal radio and television ownership regulations allowed Tribune to expand its television station holdings over the next decade. Tribune Broadcasting purchased ten additional stations by 1997, six of them acquired through that year&#x27;s purchase of Renaissance Broadcasting for $1.1 billion in cash. Tribune purchased a 12.5% stake in The WB Television Network in August 1995; the company had ten of its 16 stations affiliated with the network (including five that were signed as charter affiliates through The WB&#x27;s initial 1993 affiliation deal with Tribune). Tribune invested $21 million in The WB in March 1997, which increased its equity interest in the network to 21.9%.

In November 1994, Tribune Broadcasting formed a partnership with several minority partners, including Quincy Jones, to form Qwest Broadcasting. Qwest operated as a separate company from Tribune (which owned stations in a few markets where Tribune had already owned stations, including WATL in Atlanta, which was operated alongside Tribune-owned WGNX);

Tribune entered into a new business sector when it formed Tribune Education in 1993. The sector grew and provided high profit margins. Through 1996, Tribune used $400 million to purchase several publishers of education material: Contemporary Books, Inc., The Wright Group, Everyday Learning Corporation, Jamestown Publishers, Inc., Educational Publishing Corporation, NTC Publishing Group and Janson Publications. In 1996, this group was the number one publisher of supplemental education materials. Tribune Education acquired an 80.5% stake in mass market children&#x27;s book publisher Landoll in 1997.

In June 1998, Tribune entered into a trade with Emmis Communications to swap WQCD-FM to the latter company, in exchange for acquiring two Emmis-owned television stations (WXMI in Grand Rapids, Michigan and KTZZ in Seattle, Washington). It later traded WGNX in Atlanta to the Meredith Corporation in exchange for KCPQ-TV in Seattle in March 1999. Later that year, the station purchased WEWB in Albany, New York and WBDC in Washington, D.C. Tribune Interactive, Inc. was incorporated to handle all the various websites for its publishing, television and radio, and newspaper properties. During the 1999 fiscal year, Tribune racked up $1.47 billion in profits on total revenues of $2.92 billion, in part from gains made on the sale of some of its internet investments. In February 2000, Tribune acquired the remaining 67% interest in Qwest Broadcasting for $107 million, effectively adding two more stations to its roster, increasing its reach 27% of the country.

In June 2000, Tribune acquired the Los Angeles–based Times Mirror Company in a US$8.3 billion merger transaction, the largest acquisition in the history of the newspaper industry, effectively doubling the size of Tribune&#x27;s newspaper holdings. The Times Mirror merger added seven daily newspapers to Tribune&#x27;s existing publishing properties, including the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the Long Island-based &quot;Newsday&quot;, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; and the &quot;Hartford Courant&quot;. Through the deal, Tribune became the only media company that owned both newspapers and television stations in the three largest media markets of New York City, Los Angeles and Chicago, as a result of cross-ownership waivers that were approved by the FCC.

Among other advantages from the merger, including various economies of scale, Tribune&#x27;s newspapers could now effectively compete for national advertising, as it has grown to become the third largest newspaper group in the country. Tribune Media Net, the national advertising sales organization of Tribune Publishing, was established in 2000 to take advantage of the company&#x27;s expanded scale and scope. By 2001, revenues had grown to $5.25 billion. However, Tribune needed to pay down some of the debt that it accrued through the Times Mirror purchase; as a result, Tribune moved to sell various non-newspaper holdings operated by Times Mirror. Flight information provider Jeppesen Sanderson was sold to Boeing for $1.5 billion in October 2000. Also in October, the Institute for International Research purchased AchieveGlobal, a consulting and training firm for $100 million. Times Mirror Magazines was sold to Time, Inc. in November of that year for $475 million. Tribune divested its Tribune Education division to The McGraw-Hill Companies for $686 million in September 2000. After all these sales, Tribune still had $4 billion in long-term debt. Tribune started a joint venture with Knight-Ridder, CareerBuilder, that same year.

After the 2001 September 11 attacks, the media sector suffered a greater decrease in advertising revenue. This forced a 10% reduction in staff companywide and a $151.9 million restructuring charge.

In 2002 and 2003, Tribune Broadcasting bought four additional television stations, increasing its total television holdings to 26 stations, some of which were acquired via trades of the company&#x27;s radio stations; this left its one-time radio flagship WGN (AM) in Chicago as the company&#x27;s sole remaining radio station. Tribune Publishing purchased the monthly lifestyle publication &quot;Chicago&quot; from Primedia, Inc. in August 2002. &quot;Hoy&quot;, a Spanish language newspaper owned by the company, expanded with the launch of local editions in Chicago (in September 2003) and Los Angeles (in March 2004).

Tribune also launched daily newspapers targeting younger urban commuters, including the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;″s &quot;RedEye&quot; edition in 2003, followed by an investment in &quot;AM New York&quot;. That same year, Tribune pushed for the FCC to loosen its regulations barring cross-ownership of newspapers and broadcast outlets (television and/or radio) in a single market. Tribune would have to sell either a newspaper or television station in Los Angeles, New York City and Hartford while its combination of the &quot;Sun-Sentinel&quot; and WBZL-TV in Miami/Fort Lauderdale, Florida was given a temporary waiver. The FCC granted waivers for the other newspaper-television combinations in June 2003.

In 2006, Tribune acquired the minority equity interest in &quot;AM New York&quot;, giving it full ownership of the newspaper. The company sold both &quot;Newsday&quot; and &quot;AM New York&quot; to Cablevision Systems Corporation in 2008.

Tribune&#x27;s partnership in The WB ended in 2006, when the network was shut down – along with CBS Corporation-owned UPN – to create The CW Television Network, which was a joint venture between CBS and Warner Bros. and affiliated with several Tribune-owned stations; Tribune did not maintain an ownership interest in the network.

===Zell ownership===
On April 2, 2007, Chicago-based investor Sam Zell announced plans to buy out the Tribune Company for $34.00 a share, totalling $8.2 billion, with the intent to take the company private. The deal was approved by 97% of the company&#x27;s shareholders on August 21, 2007. Privatization of the Tribune Company occurred on December 20, 2007 with termination of trading in Tribune stock at the close of the trading day.

On December 21, 2007, Tribune and Oak Hill Capital Partners-controlled Local TV, LLC announced plans to collaborate in the formation of a &quot;broadcast management company&quot; (later named The Other Company). On January 31, 2008, Tribune Company announced it would purchase real estate leased from TMCT, LLC, which included properties used by the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Newsday&quot;, &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; and &quot;Hartford Courant&quot;. The company received an option to purchase the real estate for $175 million through the 2006 restructuring of TMCT, LLC.

In addition, Tribune announced the sale of Tribune Studios and related real estate in Los Angeles to private equity firm Hudson Capital, LLC, for $125 million. The parties also agreed to a five-year lease allowing its television station in the city, KTLA, to continue operating at the location through 2012.

On April 28, 2008, Tribune completed an acquisition of real estate from TMCT Partnership. On July 29, 2008, Cablevision Systems Corporation completed its purchase of &quot;Newsday&quot; from Tribune.

On September 8, 2008, United Airlines lost (and almost regained) $1 billion in market value when an archived &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; article from 2002 about United filing for bankruptcy appeared in the &quot;most viewed&quot; category on the &quot;South Florida Sun-Sentinel&quot;″s website. Google News index&#x27;s next pass found the link as new news. Income Security Advisors found the Google result to be new news, which was passed along to Bloomberg News where it became a headline (Tribune, which owns both papers, noted that one click on a story in non-peak hours could flag an article as &quot;most viewed&quot;).

===Bankruptcy reorganization===
On December 8, 2008, faced with a high debt load related to the company&#x27;s privatization and a sharp downturn in newspaper advertising revenue, Tribune filed for Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection. Company plans originally called for it to emerge from bankruptcy by May 31, 2010, but the company would end up in protracted bankruptcy proceedings for another four years. With the company&#x27;s overall debt totaling $13 billion, it was the largest bankruptcy in the history of the American media industry.

On October 27, 2009, Thomas S. Ricketts purchased a majority ownership (95%) of the Chicago Cubs. The sale also included Wrigley Field and a 25% ownership stake in Comcast SportsNet Chicago, as part of a deal designed to help Tribune restructure. In October 2010, Randy Michaels, who was appointed CEO after Zell&#x27;s purchase of the company, was removed and replaced by an executive council. &quot;The New York Times&quot; had reported earlier in the month about his &quot;outlandish, often sexual behavior&quot; that he also exercised in his previous job at Clear Channel Communications.

===Public corporation second time===
On July 13, 2012, the Tribune Company received approval of a reorganization plan to allow the company to emerge from Chapter 11 bankruptcy protection in a Delaware bankruptcy court. Oaktree Capital Management, JPMorgan Chase and Angelo, Gordon &amp; Co., which were the company&#x27;s senior debt holders, assumed control of Tribune&#x27;s properties upon the company&#x27;s exit from bankruptcy on December 31, 2012. Coincident with emergence from bankruptcy, company stock began trading as an over-the-counter security under the symbol TRBAA. In December 2014, over-the-counter trading ended and the company&#x27;s stock began trading on the New York Stock Exchange under the symbol TRCO.

On February 26, 2013, it was reported that Tribune hired investment firms Evercore Partners and J.P. Morgan to oversee the sale of its newspapers. On July 1, 2013, Tribune announced that it would purchase the 19 television stations owned by Local TV, LLC outright for $2.75 billion. The FCC approved the acquisition on December 20, and the sale was completed one week later on December 27.

Tribune later announced its return to television production on March 19, 2013, with the relaunch of the production and distribution division as Tribune Studios (not to be confused with the former name of Los Angeles studio facility Sunset Bronson Studios).

===Split and subsequent transactions===

On July 10, 2013, Tribune announced that it would split into two companies, spinning off the newspapers that were part of its publishing division into a separate company. Its broadcasting, digital media and other assets (including Tribune Media Services, which among others, provides news and features content for Tribune&#x27;s newspapers) would remain with the Tribune Company. The split came in the footsteps of similar spin-outs by News Corporation and Time Warner, which sought to improve the profitability of their properties by separating them from the struggling print industry. On November 20, 2013, Tribune announced it would cut 700 jobs in its newspaper operations, citing falling advertising revenue.

The split was finalized on August 4, 2014, with the publishing arm being spun out as Tribune Publishing, and the remainder of the company renamed Tribune Media.

==== Aborted acquisition by Sinclair Broadcast Group ====

On February 29, 2016, Tribune Media announced that it would review various &quot;strategic alternatives&quot; to increase the company&#x27;s value to shareholders, which include a possible sale of the entire company and/or select assets, or the formation of programming alliances or strategic partnerships with other companies, due to the decrease in its stock price since the Tribune Publishing spin-off and a $385 million revenue write-down for the 2015 fiscal year, partly due to original scripted programming expenditures for WGN America since it converted the cable network from a superstation in 2014. In 2016, Tribune Media sold off real estate properties to net $409 million while authorizing $400 million in share repurchasing. In December 2016, Tribune Media sold Gracenote to Nielsen Holdings for $560 million; Tribune planned to use the sale to pay down a debt of $3.5 billion. Cash on hand was expected to pay out $500 million in dividends in the first quarter of 2017. In January 2017, Tribune Media announced that Peter Liguori would step down as President and CEO in March.

On April 20, 2017, &quot;Bloomberg&quot; reported that Sinclair Broadcast Group was considering acquiring Tribune Media, contingent on plans by the FCC&#x27;s new chairman, Ajit Pai, to reinstate the &quot;UHF discount&quot; (a policy which makes UHF stations only count half of their total audience towards the FCC&#x27;s 39% market share cap), which had been removed by Tom Wheeler during the final months of the Obama administration. The stocks of both companies rose in value in the wake of these rumors. As was expected, the FCC reinstated the UHF discount; under adjusted calculations, the two companies only had a combined market share of 42%, meaning that the combined company would be required to divest stations in order to stay below the cap. However, there was only an 11% market overlap between Tribune and Sinclair&#x27;s stations.

On April 30, 2017, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; reported that there were competing bids for Tribune from a partnership between 21st Century Fox and private equity firm Blackstone Group (under which Fox would contribute its existing station group into a joint venture with Blackstone), and Nexstar Media Group. The Fox/Blackstone deal was being proposed as a defensive measure, due to concerns by 21st Century Fox over the number of Fox-affiliated stations Sinclair would control if it acquired Tribune Media. However, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Fox had not actually made a formal bid for Tribune Media.

On May 8, 2017, Sinclair Broadcast Group officially announced its intent to acquire Tribune Media in a cash-and-stock deal valuing the company at $3.9 billion, plus the assumption of $2.7 billion in debt held by Tribune.

The proposed sale resulted in concerns from various groups over the effects of the UHF discount on U.S. media; the Institute for Public Representation coalition filed a request for an emergency motion to stay the reinstatement of the UHF discount order pending a court challenge, echoing Wheeler&#x27;s opinion that it was outdated and intended to trigger media consolidation. On June 1, 2017, a federal appeals court issued a temporary administrative stay whilst evaluating the request, and rejected it on June 15.

On July 13, 2017, a Tribune Media shareholder, identified as Sean McEntire, filed a class-action lawsuit, seeking to halt Tribune&#x27;s sale to Sinclair, while former U.S. Securities and Exchange Commission (SEC) attorney Willie Briscoe has begun investigating Tribune&#x27;s sale to Sinclair. On that same date, another Tribune Media shareholder, identified in legal paperwork as Robert Berg, also filed a class-action lawsuit. The lawsuit accuses Sinclair and Tribune of withholding the details of the two companies&#x27; financial projections and the processes used in valuation analyses performed by their financial advisors. Additionally, the registration statement allegedly omits information about potential conflicts of interest concerning Tribune&#x27;s board of directors and one of its financial advisors. Berg further claims that stockholders are entitled to &quot;an accurate description&quot; of the background of the deal, including processes used by the board to arrive at their decision to recommend the merger. Without this information, Berg argues, stockholders cannot determine whether they support the deal. On July 18, 2017, a third Tribune Media shareholder, identified in legal paperwork as David Pill, also filed a class-action lawsuit which seeks to halt Sinclair&#x27;s acquisition of Tribune. On July 27, 2017, the law firm of Faruqi &amp; Faruqi, LLP, filed a class-action lawsuit on behalf of Tribune Media shareholders who have been harmed by Tribune&#x27;s and its board of directors&#x27; alleged violations of Sections 14(a) and 20(a) of the Securities Exchange Act of 1934 in connection with the proposed merger of the Company with Sinclair Broadcast Group, Inc.

On October 19, 2017, the sale was approved by Tribune Media shareholders.

On July 16, 2018, FCC chairman Ajit Pai was reported to have &quot;serious concerns&quot; about the merger and proposed a hearing before an administrative law judge.

On August 9, 2018, Tribune decided to back out on the merger, and decided to sue Sinclair, alleging breach of contract.

==== Acquisition by Nexstar Media Group ====
In November 2018, sale rumors intensified again, with Byron Allen (founder of Entertainment Studios), Ion Media (in partnership with Cerberus Capital Management and Hicks Equity Partners) having reported interest and Nexstar Media Group reported as being a leading bidder.

On December 3, 2018, Nexstar Media Group announced its intent to merge with Tribune Media for $6.4 billion and it will still be known as &quot;Nexstar Media Group&quot;. The sale would give the company 216 stations in 118 markets, placing it just below the FCC&#x27;s market cap of 39% of TV households. The sale price reflects a 45% increase in valuation over Sinclair&#x27;s offer. Nexstar plans to divest some stations and &quot;non-core&quot; assets as part of the acquisition.

On January 21, 2019, it was reported that Nexstar Media Group has agreed to merge with Tribune Media for about $4.1 billion in cash, making it the largest regional U.S. TV station operator and will take the Nexstar name.

On August 1 of that year, the United States Department of Justice approved the deal.

The sale was approved by the FCC on September 16, and completed on September 19.

The town is the administrative centre of the South Holland District. The town is located between the cities of Peterborough and Lincoln.

The town was well known for the annual Spalding Flower Parade, held from 1959 to 2013. The parade celebrated the region&#x27;s vast tulip production and the cultural links between the Fens and the landscape and people of South Holland. At one time, it attracted crowds of more than 100,000. Since 2002 the town has held an annual pumpkin festival in October.
In 2023 a new flower parade was organised by former councillor Steve Timewell. As well as the Flower Parade Spalding Round Table also host Spalding Festival.

==History==
===Ancient===
Archaeological excavations at Wygate Park in Spalding have shown that there has been occupation in this area from at least the Roman period, when this part of Lincolnshire was used for the production of salt. It was a coastal siltland. At Wygate Park salt-making seems to have come to an end by the mid-7th century BC climatic change and flooding may have made such activities difficult, causing the practice to die out.
The settlement&#x27;s name is derived from an Anglian tribe, the Spaldingas, who settled in the area during the 6th century. They may have retained their administrative independence within the Kingdom of Mercia into the late 9th century, when Stamford became one of the Five Boroughs of the East Midlands under Danish control after years of invasion and occupation.

===Domesday Book ===
Spalding was a settlement mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, in the hundred of Elloe and the county of Lincolnshire.
It had a recorded population of 91 households in 1086, putting it in the largest 20% of settlements recorded in Domesday, and is listed under 3 owners in Domesday Book.

===Victorian Era===
In John Bartholomew&#x27;s &quot;Gazetteer of the British Isles&quot; (1887), Spalding was described as a:
market town and par. with ry. sta., Lincolnshire, on River Welland, 14 m. SW. of Boston, 12,070 ac., pop. 9260; P.O., T.O., three Banks, two newspapers. Market-day, Tuesday. Spalding is an important railway centre, while the river has been made navigable to the town for vessels of from 50 to 70 tons. It is in a rich agricultural district, and has a large trade, by river and by rail, in corn, wool, coal, and timber. It has also flour, bone, and sawmills, breweries, and coach works. There are remains of a priory of 1501, a fine old church (restored 1860), a grammar school, a corn exchange, and a spacious market place.

==River Welland==

===Draining of the Fens===
The River Welland flows north from Crowland, through Spalding and passing the village and port of Fosdyke before leading out to the Wash, bisecting Spalding from east to west; the town has developed as a linear settlement around the river. Land had been reclaimed from the wetlands in the area since mediaeval times, and Spalding was subject to frequent flooding. The Coronation Channel, opened in 1953, diverted the excess waters around Spalding and ended the flooding. The area around the banks has been developed for residential and business use. Although this area has become heavily built up, there is much recreational use of the river and fishing is still popular.

===Water Taxi===

In July 2005 a &quot;Spalding Water Taxi&quot; service was launched, running from Easter to late October. Its route is from just off Spalding&#x27;s High Street, upstream along the river, turning into the Coronation Channel, and then to Springfields Outlet Shopping &amp; Leisure, and back. It is mainly used as a recreational tourist attraction.

===Vernatt&#x27;s Drain===

Around the northwest of Spalding is a large waterway called Vernatt&#x27;s Drain, named after one of the Adventurers who drained the Fens in the 17th century. Philibert Vernatti was made a baronet on 7 June 1643.
A South Holland council nature reserve is situated on part of the old Boston railway line at Vernatts Drain. The Drain runs from the pumping station at Pode Hole to Surfleet Seas End.
Fulney Lock is the point where the Welland is no longer tidal. Spalding falls within the drainage area of the Welland and Deepings Internal Drainage Board.

==Demography==
The town (including the large village of Pinchbeck, to the north and the hamlet of Little London to the south) had a population of about 31,588 at the 2011 census and an estimated population of 36,737 in 2020 according to government data.

In the past concerns have been expressed about the exploitation of farm and industrial workers from eastern Europe, as well as increased pressure on local services as a result of unplanned population increase; in 2007 the local MP, Mark Simmonds, said that &quot;the real scale [of modern slavery in the area] is unknown, but it is out of control&quot;.

==Healthcare==
The Johnson Hospital, named after prominent local figures, the Johnson family of Ayscoughfee Hall, is in Spalding. The maternity ward was closed in the 1990s, and it served as a casualty hospital. The elderly and care patients were cared for at the Welland Hospital. Limits on expansion due to the historic nature of the building and space limitations (it is in a densely developed area) and lack of funding are causing financial trouble for the hospital and it relocated in 2000 to a new site in the town.
 
A new nurse-led hospital was built in 2009 off Pinchbeck Road in the north of the town, near the Pinchbeck Industrial Estate. The hospital is known as &quot;The Johnson Community Hospital&quot;, keeping the historic connection with the Johnson family. The Princess Royal formally opened the new hospital in January 2010. This has drawn facilities from existing scattered sites into a modern central unit. The Johnson Hospital has 32 in-patient beds in the Welland Ward, including the four beds of the Tulip Suite for palliative care. There are two major local doctors&#x27; surgeries: Munro Medical Centre, West Elloe Avenue, and the relocated Church Street Surgery at Beechfield Medical Centre in Beechfield Gardens. Smaller surgeries are in surrounding villages.

The nearest major acute hospitals to Spalding are the Pilgrim Hospital in Boston (18 miles north) and Peterborough City Hospital in Peterborough (22 miles south-west).
==Education==
===Primary schools===
* Ayscoughfee Hall - a private school, situated near the river
* Spalding Parish Church of England Day School- Clay Lake
* St John the Baptist School (C of E) - Hawthorn Bank
* St Norbert&#x27;s Roman Catholic Primary School - Tollgate
* Monkshouse Primary - Pennygate
* St Paul&#x27;s Primary - Queen&#x27;s Road
* Spalding Primary School - Woolram Wygate
* Wygate Park Academy - Witham Road

===Secondary schools===
Spalding&#x27;s two secondary modern schools (11-16) were the Gleed Boys&#x27; School and the Gleed Girls&#x27; Technology College. In 2012 they were combined as the Sir John Gleed School. On leaving Sir John Gleed School, many pupils transferred to nearby sixth forms or attended Boston College or New College Stamford, which both have Further Education centres in the town. In 2016, South Lincolnshire Academies Trust (SLAT) took over management of the Sir John Gleed School from CFBT, and it was renamed Spalding Academy.
The town&#x27;s state grammar schools (still selective by eleven-plus exam) are Spalding Queen Elizabeth Royal Free Grammar School (11-16 for boys) and Spalding High School (11-16 for girls), both of which have mixed sixth forms (16-18). 
There are also schools for children with special learning needs: the Priory School (for those with mild to moderate learning difficulties) and the Garth School (for those with more demanding educational needs).

===Sixth Form Colleges===
A vocational 6th form was established and launched in September 2008 as part of the Gleed Campus. It is not an automatic transition as with other schools in the area, like the Grammar, High, and the Deepings. Previous to this, there was no sixth-form available for pupils not attending the grammar schools, although pupils from Gleed schools can and do transfer to the Grammar and High for A-Levels.

==Industry and commerce==

===Flowers and vegetables===

Spalding is located at the centre of a major region of flower and vegetable cultivation, due to the rich silty soil, which mainly comprises drained, recovered marshland or estuary. There are many garden centres and plant nurseries, as well as a thriving agricultural industry and various vegetable packing plants. The main vegetables are potatoes, peas, carrots, wheat, barley, oats, broccoli, spinach, lettuce, cabbage, kale and Brussels sprouts. The vast majority of these are sold to large concerns such as supermarkets, with little being available for sale locally.
Spalding has a popular, reasonably-sized, market every Tuesday and Saturday and on the first Saturday in every month a farmers market. Local fruit and vegetable shop &quot;Booth&#x27;s&quot; sells much local produce to Spalding&#x27;s citizens. They sell all major fruit and vegetables ranging from the famous, locally grown &#x27;Boston&#x27; potatoes to imported rarities such as custard apples.
===Tulips===

Known as &quot;The Heart of the Fens&quot;, Spalding has been long famous as a centre of the bulb industry. It has had close links with the Netherlands (origin of the Geest family, who were former major local employers).
The annual Tulip Parade took place on the first Saturday in May, from 1959 and was a major tourist attraction. Its procession of floats on various themes, was each decorated with tulip petals, a by-product of the bulb industry. In years when the tulips are late, daffodils or hyacinths were sometimes used in their place. When the tulips were early, crepe paper had to be substituted. The flower industry has become less important since the early 21st century. The bands of brightly coloured tulip fields in bloom in spring that covered the fenland have decreased markedly. At its peak, the Parade attracted more than 100,000 visitors, but by 2012, fewer than 40,000 attended. That year, the Lincolnshire County Council and South Holland District Council announced they would not fund the parade beyond 2013.

Spalding was chosen to host the World Tulip Summit in 2008, alongside a broader &quot;Tulipmania&quot; festival which coincided with the date of the fiftieth Flower Parade.

The Spalding Tulip Parade was revived in 2023 by Stephen Timewell and many volunteers, and paid for through crowdfunding.

===Rail===

Spalding railway station is situated on the Lincoln Central - Peterborough railway line, operated by East Midlands Railway. The service is irregular, and it does not run at night or on Sundays. It does provide convenient access to Peterborough for employment and shopping. The service to Peterborough was withdrawn by BR in October 1970 as part of the closure of the East Lincolnshire route from Grimsby and Boston, but reinstated in June 1971 with a grant from Spalding Urban District Council. This was one of the first examples of this type of rail support in the UK and was not advocated in the Beeching Report.
The section of the Great Northern &amp; Great Eastern &#x27;Joint&#x27; line from March, which carried the &#x27;Boat Train&#x27; between Harwich and Sheffield, closed in 1982.
Spalding was also on the east–west Midland and Great Northern Joint Railway, which had Bourne to the West and Holbeach to the east. It closed in February 1959, ending through passenger services from Leicester to Great Yarmouth via King&#x27;s Lynn and Norwich. Local freight, mainly farm produce, continued to be carried between Bourne and Sutton Bridge until 1964.
On 4 May 2002, Spalding had the honour of having a main-line diesel locomotive named after it. Class 31 diesel No. 31106, in immaculate condition after a major works overhaul, hauled the &#x27;St James Tripper&#x27; excursion to Peterborough from Preston via Doncaster, Lincoln and Sleaford, and made a brief stop at the station to have its &#x27;Spalding Town&#x27; nameplates unveiled by Colin Fisher, Chairman of South Holland District Council. No. 31106 was owned by Norfolk-based businessman and author Howard Johnston, who was born at nearby Cowbit and educated in the town. The locomotive was employed on Network Rail track measurement trains all over the United Kingdom, but was sold in 2020. A replica &#x27;Spalding Town&#x27; nameplate was presented to SHDC for public display.

<doc id="368393" wikidata="Q836891" url="?curid=368393" title="Hardtack">
<text>Hardtack (or hard tack) is a type of dense cracker made from flour, water, and sometimes salt. Hardtack is inexpensive and long-lasting. It is used for sustenance in the absence of perishable foods, commonly during long sea voyages, land migrations, and military campaigns. Along with salt pork and corned beef, hardtack was a standard ration for many militaries and navies from the 17th to the early 20th centuries.

==Etymology==
The name is derived from &quot;tack&quot;, the British sailor slang for food. The earliest use of the term recorded by the &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; is from 1830.

It is known by other names including &quot;brewis&quot; (possibly a cognate with &quot;brose&quot;), &quot;cabin bread&quot;, &quot;pilot bread&quot;, &quot;sea biscuit&quot;, &quot;soda crackers&quot;, &quot;sea bread&quot; (as rations for sailors), &quot;ship&#x27;s biscuit&quot;, and pejoratively as &quot;dog biscuits&quot;, &quot;molar breakers&quot;, &quot;sheet iron&quot;, &quot;tooth dullers&quot;, &quot;Panzerplatten&quot; (&quot;armor plates&quot;; Germany) and &quot;worm castles&quot;. Australian and New Zealand military personnel knew them with some sarcasm as &quot;ANZAC wafers&quot; (not to be confused with Anzac biscuit).

==History==
The introduction of the baking of processed cereals, including the creation of flour, provided a more reliable source of food. Egyptian sailors carried a flat brittle loaf of millet bread called dhourra cake. A cracker called &quot;bucellatum&quot; is known in Ancient Rome. King Richard I of England left for the Third Crusade (1189–1192) with &quot;biskit of muslin&quot;, which was a mixed grain compound of barley, bean flour, and rye. The more refined captain&#x27;s biscuit was made with finer flour. Some 5th century BCE physicians, such as Hippocrates, associated most medical problems with digestion. For sustenance and health, eating a biscuit daily was considered good for one&#x27;s constitution.

As the hardtack biscuits softened with time due to exposure to humidity and other weather elements, they became more palatable, so the bakers in the 12th century made biscuits as hard as possible. Because it was baked hard, it would stay intact for years if kept dry. For long voyages, hardtack was baked four times, rather than the more common two, and prepared six months before sailing. Because it is dry and hard, hardtack (when properly stored and transported) will survive rough handling and temperature extremes.

When James VI and I set sail for Norway in October 1589, his provisions included 15,000 &quot;bisquit baiks&quot;. In 1665, Samuel Pepys first regularized naval victualling in the Royal Navy with varied and nutritious rations, to include &quot;one pound daily of good, clean, sweet, sound, well-baked and well-conditioned wheaten biscuit&quot;. By at least 1731, it was officially codified in Naval regulation that each sailor was rationed of biscuit per day.

Hardtack, crumbled or pounded fine and used as a thickener, was a key ingredient in New England seafood chowders from the late 1700s.

In 1801, Josiah Bent began a baking operation in Milton, Massachusetts, selling &quot;water crackers&quot; made of flour and water that would be resistant to deterioration during long sea voyages from the port of Boston. These were also used extensively as a source of food by the gold prospectors who migrated to the gold mines of California in 1849. Since the journey took months, hardtack was stored in the wagon trains. Bent&#x27;s company later sold the original hardtack crackers used by troops during the American Civil War. The G. H. Bent Company operated in Milton and sold these items to Civil War re-enactors and others until 2018.
By 1818, the United States Navy had outlined that each sailor was to be given 14 ounces of bread per day as part of their daily ration while serving onboard in the form of hardtack. The procurement of these stores was the responsibility of the ship&#x27;s Purser, and was not strictly outlined by the Board of Navy Commissioners.

During the American Civil War (1861–1865), hardtack was shipped from Union and Confederate storehouses. Civil War soldiers generally found their rations to be unappealing, and joked about the poor quality of the hardtack in the satirical song &quot;Hard Tack Come Again No More&quot;. The song was sung to the tune of the Stephen Foster song &quot;Hard Times Come Again No More&quot;, and featured lyrics describing the hardtack rations as being &#x27;old and very wormy&#x27; and causing many &#x27;stomachs sore&#x27;. John Billings, a soldier in the 10th Massachusetts Battery, outlines many details on how hardtack was utilized during the war in his book &quot;Hard Tack and Coffee&quot;.
With insect infestation common in improperly stored provisions, soldiers would break up the hardtack and drop it into their morning coffee. This would not only soften the hardtack but the insects, mostly weevil larvae, would float to the top, and the soldiers could skim off the insects and resume consumption. The weevils &quot;left no distinctive flavor behind.&quot; Some men also turned hardtack into a mush by breaking it up with blows from their rifle butts, then adding water. If the men had a frying pan, they could cook the mush into a lumpy pancake; otherwise they dropped the mush directly on the coals of their campfire. They also mixed hardtack with brown sugar, hot water, and sometimes whiskey to create what they called a pudding, to serve as dessert.

Royal Navy hardtack during Queen Victoria&#x27;s reign was made by machine at the Royal Clarence Victualing Yard at Gosport, Hampshire, stamped with the Queen&#x27;s mark and the number of the oven in which it was baked. When machinery was introduced into the process, the dough was thoroughly mixed and rolled into sheets about long and wide, which were then stamped in one stroke into about sixty hexagonal shaped biscuits. The hexagonal shape saved material and time and made them easier to pack compared to the traditional circular shaped biscuit. Hardtack remained an important part of the Royal Navy sailor&#x27;s diet until the introduction of canned foods; canned meat was first marketed in 1814, and preserved beef in tins was officially introduced to the Royal Navy rations in 1847.

As early as the Spanish–American War in 1898, some military hardtack was used by service members in etching or writing notes, often commemorating events or coined with phrases of the time.

===Cocket bread===
Cocket bread was a type of bread in England, as referenced in the Assize of Bread and Ale (&quot;temp. incert.&quot;) (c. 1266), where it is one of several kinds of bread named. It seems to have been hard sea-biscuit, which perhaps had then some mark or seal (a cocket) on it; or else, was so called from its being designed for the use of the coxswains, or seamen.

==Modern use==
Commercially available hardtack is a significant source of food energy in a small, durable package. A store-bought 24-gram cracker can contain 100 calories (20 percent from fat) from 2 grams of protein but practically no fiber.

===Asia===
Ma Bo mentioned hardtack as being a staple food of Chinese hard-labor workers in Inner Mongolia, during the Cultural Revolution.

Hardtack was a staple of military servicemen in Japan and South Korea well into the late 20th century. It is known as &quot;Kanpan&quot; (乾パン) in Japan and &quot;geonbbang (geonppang, 건빵)&quot; in South Korea, meaning &#x27;dry bread&#x27;, and is still sold as a fairly popular snack food in both countries. (Canned kanpan is also distributed in Japan as emergency rations in case of earthquake, flood, or other disaster.) A harder hardtack than Kanpan, called &quot;Katapan&quot; (堅パン), is historically popular in Kitakyushu City, Fukuoka, Japan as one of its regional specialty foods. In Korea, geonppang (hardtacks) mixed with byulsatang (star candy) as a medley is considered a popular snack. 

===Europe===
Hardtack, baked with or without the addition of fat, was and still is a staple in Russian military rations, especially in the Navy, as infantry traditionally preferred simple dried bread when long shelf life was needed. Called &quot;galeta&quot; (галета) in Russian, it is usually somewhat softer and more crumbly than traditional hardtack, as most varieties made in Russia include at least some fat or shortening, making them closer to saltine crackers. One such variety, &quot;khlyebtsy armyeyskiye&quot; (хлебцы армейские), or &quot;army crackers&quot;, is included in Russian military rations. Other brands enjoy significant popularity among the civilian population as well, both among campers and the general populace.

In Genoa, hardtack was and still is a traditional addition to a fish and vegetable salad called cappon magro.

In Germany, hardtack is included in every military ration and colloquially known as &quot;Panzerplatten&quot; (armor plates) or Panzerkekse (armor cookies/tank cookies). Due to conscription for many years a large part of the male population knew about them from their service and thus they became somewhat popular even in civilian use. The company that makes them also sells them unaltered to the civilian market. They are said to have many properties, some jokingly assigned, such as the ability to combine them with standard issue shoe polish to create a flammable device, or to glue them onto vehicles to increase their armor protection. One quality, liked by many soldiers, is its ability to hinder one&#x27;s need to defecate, some claiming they did not need to defecate for three days after consuming large quantities of them.

In Poland, hardtack wafers (known by their official name: &quot;Suchary Specjalne SU-1&quot; or &quot;SU-2 – Special Hardtacks&quot;) are still present in Polish Army military rations. In military slang they are jokingly called &quot;Panzerwaffel&quot; (tank or armor wafers), a pun on &quot;Panzerwaffe&quot;, the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; armored motorized forces (the German words &quot;Panzer&quot; and &quot;Waffe&quot; mean &quot;tank&quot; or &quot;armor&quot; and &quot;weapon&quot;, respectively). They are also popular amongst civilians, and are a common part of a meal in some regions.

===Melanesia===
Hardtack remains popular today in Papua New Guinea. The Lae Biscuit Company, which is the most commonly found and popular brand in that country, makes multiple varieties of hardtack.

===North America===

====Canada====
Hardtack is a mainstay in parts of Canada. Purity Factories is one maker of traditional hardtack. They specialize in a high density, high caloric product that is well suited for use by expeditions.

Located in St. John&#x27;s, Newfoundland and Labrador, they currently produce three varieties of hardtack:

* The first variety, a cracker similar to a cross between an unsalted saltine and hardtack, Crown Pilot Crackers. It was a popular item in much of New England and was manufactured by Nabisco until it was discontinued in the first quarter of 2008. It was discontinued once before, in 1996, but a small uprising by its supporters brought it back in 1997. This variety comes in two sub-varieties, Flaky and Barge biscuits.
* The second is Hard Bread, a traditional hardtack, and is the principal ingredient in fish and brewis, a traditional Newfoundland and Labrador meal.
* The third variety is Sweet Bread, which is slightly softer than regular hardtack due to a higher sugar and shortening content, and is eaten as a snack food.

====United States====
Interbake Foods of Richmond, Virginia, produces most of the commercially available hardtack in the United States, under the &quot;Sailor Boy&quot; label. As of January 2015, 98 percent of its production goes to Alaska. Alaskans are among the last to still eat hardtack as a significant part of their normal diet. Originally imported as a food product that could endure the rigors of transportation throughout Alaska, hardtack has remained a favored food even as other, less robust foods have become more readily available.

Alaskan law requires all light aircraft to carry &quot;survival gear&quot;, including food. Therefore, the blue-and-white Sailor Boy Pilot Bread boxes are ubiquitous at Alaskan airstrips, in cabins, and in virtually every village. Unlike the traditional hardtack recipe, Sailor Boy Pilot Bread contains leavening and vegetable shortening.

Hardtack is also a common pantry item in Hawaii, and The Diamond Bakery&#x27;s &quot;Saloon Pilot&quot; cracker is available there in grocery and convenience stores. The round hardtack crackers are available in large- and small-diameter sizes.

Those who buy commercially baked hardtack in the contiguous US are often those who stock up on long-lasting foods for disaster survival rations, though these usually take the form of food ration bars or freeze dried meals rather than traditional hardtack.

Many other people who currently buy or bake hardtack in the US are Civil War re-enactors. The 3rd US Regular Infantry Reenactors, for example, often cook many recipes during their reenacting camps, to include hardtack.

<text>Dorothea Helen Puente (; January 9, 1929 – March 27, 2011) was an American convicted serial killer. In the 1980s, she ran a boarding house in Sacramento, California, and murdered various elderly and mentally disabled boarders before cashing their Social Security checks. Puente&#x27;s total count reached nine murders; she was convicted of three and the jury hung on the other six. Newspapers dubbed Puente the &quot;Death House Landlady&quot;.

== Background ==
Dorothea Puente was born Dorothea Helen Gray on January 9, 1929, in Redlands, California, to Trudy Mae () and Jesse James Gray. Both parents were alcoholics, and Puente&#x27;s father repeatedly threatened to kill himself in front of his children; he died of tuberculosis in 1937. Her mother, who worked as a sex worker, lost custody of her children in 1938 and died in a motorcycle accident by the end of the year. Puente and her siblings were subsequently sent to an orphanage, where she was sexually abused.

Puente&#x27;s first marriage at age 16, in 1945, was to a soldier named Fred McFaul, who had just returned from the Pacific theater of World War II. They had two daughters between 1946 and 1948; Puente sent one child to live with relatives in Sacramento, and placed the other for adoption. She also suffered a miscarriage.

In the spring of 1948, Puente was arrested for purchasing women&#x27;s accessories using forged checks in Riverside. She pled guilty to two counts of forgery, serving four months in jail and three years&#x27; probation. Six months after her release, she left Riverside. Later that year, Puente&#x27;s first husband left her.

In 1952, Puente allegedly married merchant seaman Axel Bren Johansson in San Francisco. She created a fake persona, calling herself &quot;Teya Singoalla Neyaarda&quot;, a Muslim woman of Egyptian and Israeli descent. They had a turbulent marriage; Puente took advantage of Johansson&#x27;s frequent trips to sea by inviting men to their home and gambling away his money.

Puente was arrested in 1960 for owning and operating a bookkeeping firm as a front for a brothel in Sacramento; she was found guilty and was sentenced to ninety days in the Sacramento County Jail. In 1961, Johansson had Puente briefly committed to DeWitt State Hospital after a binge of drinking, lying, criminal behavior and suicide attempts. While there, she was diagnosed by doctors as a pathological liar with an unstable personality.

Puente and Johansson divorced in 1966, although she continued to use Johansson&#x27;s name for some time following their separation. She assumed the identity of &quot;Sharon Johansson&quot;, hiding her delinquent behavior by portraying herself as a devout Christian woman. She established her reputation as a caregiver, providing young women with a sanctuary from poverty and abuse without charge.

In 1968, Dorothea married Roberto Jose Puente. After sixteen months, the couple separated, with Dorothea citing domestic abuse. She attempted to serve him with a divorce petition, but he fled to Mexico; the divorce was not finalized until 1973. The two continued to have a turbulent relationship, and Dorothea filed a restraining order in 1975. She continued to use the surname Puente for more than twenty years.

Following her divorce, Puente focused on running a boarding house located near 15th and F streets in Sacramento. She established herself as a genuine resource to the community to aid alcoholics, homeless people and the mentally ill by holding Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and assisting individuals to sign up to receive Social Security benefits. She changed her public image to that of a respectable older matron by putting on vintage clothing, wearing large glasses, and not dyeing her greying hair. She also established herself as a respected member of the local Hispanic community, funding charities, scholarships and radio programs. She eventually met and married Pedro Angel Montalvo, though Montalvo abruptly left the relationship a week after their marriage.

On December 21, 1978, Puente was convicted of illegally cashing thirty-four state and federal checks that belonged to her tenants. She was given five years&#x27; probation and ordered to pay $4,000 in restitution.

== Victims ==
On January 16, 1982, Puente met Malcolm McKenzie, 74, in a bar and accompanied him back to his apartment. He later reported that Puente had drugged him by slipping something into his drink before she robbed him of a coin collection, watches and other jewelry, including a diamond ring belonging to his mother, which she removed from his finger while he was incapacitated.

On April 28, 1982, Ruth Munroe, 61, who had visited Puente&#x27;s home two weeks earlier, was found dead due to respiratory depression, caused by a massive overdose of codeine. Munroe was reportedly in good health when she arrived at Puente&#x27;s home; however, by April 25, she told a friend, &quot;I am so sick I feel like I am going to die.&quot; Munroe&#x27;s death was originally ruled an &quot;undetermined overdose,&quot; but later classified as a homicide.

On May 16, 1982, Dorothy Osborne, 49, found checks, credit cards, and other items missing eight hours after Puente visited her home and prepared her a drink.

In July 1982, Puente was convicted of three grand theft charges. She was sentenced to five years in prison, state parole until March 21, 1986, and her federal parole sentence was extended another two years, until 1990. During her incarceration, she began corresponding with Everson Theodore Gillmouth, a 77-year-old retiree from Oregon. At the beginning of September in 1985, Gillmouth came to Sacramento with his truck and trailer and arrived at Puente&#x27;s boarding house. On September 9, 1985, after serving only half her sentence, Puente was released from prison, whereupon she was picked up by Gillmouth and Ricardo Ordorica, a close friend who lived with his family in the downstairs flat at 1426 F Street. In October 1985, Puente wrote to Gillmouth&#x27;s sister informing her that she and Gillmouth were to be married on November 2. A short time later, Puente hired a handyman, Ismael Carrasco Florez, to remodel, and asked him to build a 6-foot by 30-inch by 30-inch storage box. She agreed to give him Gillmouth&#x27;s truck and $800 as payment. The day after he completed the box, he returned to find it nailed shut. Puente asked Florez to help her move the box, which now weighed approximately 300 pounds, to a storage location, but ended up dumping the box near a river about an hour away from Sacramento. On January 1, 1986, a fisherman discovered the suspicious box along the Sacramento River and notified authorities, who found a human body inside, determined on December 28, 1998, to be Gillmouth&#x27;s. His severely decomposed body was wrapped in numerous plastic bags and covered with a bed sheet held in place by electrical tape. Moth balls and &quot;blue toilet deodorizer&quot; were also found inside the box. It was later discovered that after Gillmouth&#x27;s death, Puente had mailed fake letters and cards to his sister in an attempt to make her believe Gillmouth was still alive. Puente was also found to have forged Gillmouth&#x27;s signature on his truck&#x27;s certificate of title, and continued cashing Gillmouth&#x27;s benefit checks until July 1986.

In the fall of 1986, Betty Mae Palmer, 78, arrived at Puente&#x27;s boarding house. On October 14, 1986, Puente obtained a California ID card with her photo and Palmer&#x27;s name. Two months later, the mailing address on Palmer&#x27;s social security checks was changed to Puente&#x27;s F Street address. Puente forged Palmer&#x27;s signature and cashed nearly $7,000 worth of benefit checks belonging to Palmer. In November 1988, Palmer&#x27;s partially dismembered body was discovered in a shallow hole in Puente&#x27;s front yard. Her head, hands, and lower legs were never found. Toxicology reports of the body revealed the presence of Doxylamine, an over-the-counter antihistamine, as well as Haloperidol and flurazepam, both of which were previously prescribed to Palmer. She was identified on January 24, 1989, through comparison to previous medical X-rays.

On October 21, 1986, Puente summoned a notary to the hospital room of Leona Carpenter, 78, who had suffered a flurazepam overdose. She was given power of attorney over Carpenter and began cashing her social security checks just ten days later. In December, after Carpenter was released from the hospital, she went to live with Puente. Once again, Carpenter returned to the hospital, and just a few weeks after she was discharged, in February 1987, she disappeared. In November 1988, her body was found in the southeastern corner of Puente&#x27;s yard. Toxicology reports of Carpenter&#x27;s brain tissue revealed the presence of codeine, diazepam, and flurazepam.

In February 1987, James Gallop, 62, moved into Puente&#x27;s home. On July 20, 1987, a potentially malignant tumor was found in Gallop&#x27;s colon. He agreed to further testing, but Puente later contacted his doctor&#x27;s office, notifying them that he had gone to Los Angeles indefinitely. Gallop&#x27;s body was found buried under a gazebo in Puente&#x27;s yard in November 1988. Toxicological testing of Gallop&#x27;s brain and liver revealed the presence of amitriptyline, nortriptyline, phenytoin, and flurazepam.

In July 1987, Eugene Gamel, 58, was found dead of an apparent suicide, having overdosed on amitriptyline and ethanol. Puente, who was Gamel&#x27;s landlady, said he had a history of suicide attempts. Though Puente was never charged with Gamel&#x27;s murder, he was considered a possible victim.

On October 2, 1987, Vera Faye Martin, 61, was sent to live with Puente. Starting October 5, 1987, Puente forged a number of Martin&#x27;s social security checks, totalling over $7,000. On October 19, 1987, Martin failed to contact her daughter on her birthday, as she had done each year. In November 1988, Martin&#x27;s body was found buried under a metal shed in Puente&#x27;s yard. Toxicology reports of her brain and liver revealed flurazepam.

On October 21, 1987, Dorothy Miller, 65, was placed in an upstairs flat in Puente&#x27;s home. She introduced Miller to Ricardo Ordorica, who the following November became the representative payee for Miller&#x27;s social security benefits. Just weeks after her arrival, Miller disappeared, and on November 20, 1987, Puente hired a carpet cleaner to remove a large &quot;pile of foul smelling slime&quot; in Miller&#x27;s room. Puente continued to forge Miller&#x27;s checks, totalling over $11,000, after she was no longer at her house. Miller&#x27;s remains were later discovered buried under a slab of concrete, near some rose bushes. Tissue samples from Miller&#x27;s brain revealed the presence of carbamazepine and flurazepam.

On November 29, 1987, Brenda Trujillo sent a letter to the Social Security office in Sacramento, accusing Puente of stealing her Social Security checks, totalling $3,500. Trujillo had met Puente in the Sacramento County Jail in 1982 and the two had later shared a prison cell. After her release, Trujillo had moved into Puente&#x27;s boarding house, where Puente had helped her apply for Social Security benefits. Trujillo claimed that Puente had drugged her and called her parole officer, causing her parole to be revoked and so preventing her from receiving the checks.

In February 1988, Alvaro &quot;Bert&quot; Gonzales Montoya, 51, arrived at Puente&#x27;s home. In March, an application designating Puente as Montoya&#x27;s benefits payee was filed. At the end of August, a roommate saw a man clearing Montoya&#x27;s clothes out of the closet. He was last seen on August 24 and missed an appointment on August 29. Puente told several people that Montoya had gone to Mexico to visit his relatives. Social workers continued to attempt to contact Montoya in September and October to no avail. In November, Puente asked Donald Anthony, a former convict who had been working in her yard, to contact the social worker, pretending to be Montoya&#x27;s brother-in-law. He agreed, and called stating his name was &quot;Michel Obergone&quot; and that he had picked up Montoya from the F Street house and taken him to Utah. The social worker was suspicious and told Puente that she was going to call the police. On November 10, the social worker received a letter, purportedly from &quot;Michel Obergone,&quot; wrapped in a paper towel to avoid finger prints. Days later, Montoya&#x27;s body was found buried adjacent to Carpenter&#x27;s. Toxicology testing revealed the presence of loxapine, flurazepam, diphenhydramine, amitriptyline, and carbamazepine. Montoya had prescriptions for all of the drugs except for carbamazepine.

On March 9, 1988, Benjamin Fink, 55, was sent to live with Puente. Fink&#x27;s brother visited him on a weekly basis, for six weeks. By the end of April, Fink was gone. Another tenant reported smelling a foul odor emanating from his room, but was told by Puente that it was a sewer backup. On April 29, Puente received 12 bags of cement. That June, next to the door of the metal shed, she had a hole dug, which was later filled in with concrete. In November, Fink&#x27;s body was discovered in this area, wrapped in plastic knotted bedspread, secured with duct tape, and covered with blue absorbent pads. His toxicology report revealed the presence of amitriptyline, loxapine, and flurazepam.

== Arrest ==
On November 7, 1988, police spoke with John Sharp, a former resident, about the disappearance of Montoya. Initially, Sharp told police that he had seen Montoya two days earlier, but then he slipped a note to the officer that said, &quot;She wants me to lie to you.&quot; He later met with an officer to tell his story. On November 11, 1988, a detective returned to Puente&#x27;s residence and, with her permission, began digging in areas that appeared to be recently disturbed. Thirty minutes later, he discovered the first body there. Just hours afterward, Puente slipped away from police. On November 13, 1988, an all-points bulletin was issued for her.

On November 16, 1988, Charles Willgues, along with Gene Silver of CBS, alerted police to Puente&#x27;s whereabouts at a motel in Los Angeles. Willgues met Puente, who was using the alias Donna Johansen, the day before at a nearby bar. He later recalled seeing her on a CBS morning newscast and reached out to Gene Silver, who met with Willgues at his apartment. The two contacted local law enforcement, and Puente was arrested the same day.

== Trial and conviction ==
On November 17, 1988, Puente was flown from the Hollywood Burbank Airport to Sacramento, escorted by police, and booked in the county jail. She was then formally charged with the murder of Montoya.

On March 10, 1989, criminal charges against Ismael Florez were dismissed because the statute of limitations had expired three years after Gillmouth&#x27;s body was discovered. Florez was later granted immunity for his testimony against Puente.

On March 31, 1989, an amended complaint was filed, charging Puente with nine counts of murder, with special circumstance, qualifying it as a death penalty case. According to investigators, most of her victims had been drugged until they overdosed; Puente had then wrapped them in bed-sheets and plastic lining before dragging them to open pits in the backyard for burial. By May 24, 1990, the prosecutor rested his case for the preliminary hearing to determine whether the case could proceed to trial, having called 71 witnesses and introducing 108 exhibits. On June 19, 1990, a judge ruled that there was &quot;ample circumstantial evidence&quot; to send Puente to trial, and on July 31, 1990, Puente pleaded not guilty.

After numerous delays, on October 19, 1992, a judge ruled that Puente would face all nine murder counts, and that all cases would be heard in Monterey County. On December 21, 1992, twelve jurors, consisting of eight men and four women, were selected for Puente&#x27;s trial. The following month, six alternate jurors, five women and one man, were selected to back up the twelve regular jurors.

Puente&#x27;s trial began on February 9, 1993. By the conclusion of the trial, 156 witnesses testified, more than 3,100 exhibits had been submitted, and over 22,000 pages of transcript were recorded. After deliberating for eleven days, the jury told Judge Michael J. Virga on August 2, 1993, that they were deadlocked on all nine counts of murder and asked for further instruction. The next day, Virga ordered the jury to resume their efforts to break the deadlock. On August 26, 1993, Puente was convicted on three counts of murder: Benjamin Fink, Leona Carpenter, and Dorothy Miller. The jury, after deliberating for thirty five days, remained deadlocked on six cases: Ruth Munroe, Everson Theodore Gillmouth, Betty Mae Palmer, James Gallop, Vera Faye Martin, and Alvaro Gonzales Montoya.

During the penalty phase of the trial, jurors found themselves deadlocked once again, and on October 13, 1993, Puente was spared the death penalty. On December 10, 1993, she was sentenced to life imprisonment without the possibility of parole. She was incarcerated at Central California Women&#x27;s Facility (CCWF) in Chowchilla, California.

On August 28, 1997, an appellate court in San Jose affirmed Puente&#x27;s murder convictions, but ordered an examination of juror misconduct allegations. After a three-day hearing, on September 25, 1998, judge William D. Curtis rejected each allegation of jury misconduct in Puente&#x27;s trial. 
== Death ==
Puente died in prison at Chowchilla on March 27, 2011, from natural causes; she was 82.

== Media ==
Puente has been featured on numerous true crime television shows, including &quot;Crime Stories&quot;, &quot;Deadly Women&quot;, &quot;A Stranger in My Home,&quot; &quot;World&#x27;s Most Evil Killers,&quot; and &quot;Worst Roommate Ever&quot;.

In 1998, Puente began corresponding with Shane Bugbee. The result was &quot;Cooking with a Serial Killer&quot; (2004), which included a lengthy interview, almost fifty recipes, and various pieces of prison art sent to Bugbee by the convicted murderer. Jodi Picoult mentions Puente&#x27;s crimes and cookbook in her novel &quot;House Rules&quot;.

The boarding house at 1426 F Street in Sacramento was included in the 2013 home tour held by the Sacramento Old City Association. It was then the subject of the 2015 documentary short &quot;The House Is Innocent&quot; and was again opened to tours for one day in conjunction with a local film festival&#x27;s showing of the film.

<text>Yeovil () is a town and civil parish in Somerset, England. The population of Yeovil at the last census (2021) was 49,698. It is close to Somerset&#x27;s southern border with Dorset, west of London, south of Bristol, west of Sherborne and east of Taunton. The aircraft and defence industries which developed in the 20th century made it a target for bombing in the Second World War; they are still major employers. Yeovil Country Park, which includes Ninesprings, is one of several open spaces with educational, cultural and sporting facilities. Religious sites include the 14th-century Church of St John the Baptist. The town is on the A30 and A37 roads and has two railway stations.

==Geography==

Yeovil is in the south of Somerset, close to the border with Dorset, from London, south of Bristol and from Taunton. It lies in the centre of the Yeovil Scarplands, a natural region of England. The suburbs include Summerlands, Hollands, Houndstone, Preston Plucknett, Penn Mill, New Town, Hendford, Old Town, Forest Hill, Abbey Manor, Great Lyde. Outlying villages include East Coker, West Coker, Hardington Mandeville, Evershot, Halstock, Stoford, Barwick, Sutton Bingham, Mudford and Yetminster. Other nearby villages include Bradford Abbas, Thornford Corscombe, Montacute (with Montacute House) and Pendomer. The village of Brympton, now almost a suburb of Yeovil, contains the medieval manor of Brympton d&#x27;Evercy. Tintinhull, also close to Yeovil, features the National Trust-owned Tintinhull House and Gardens.

Ninesprings Country Park is in the south-east near Penn Hill, linked by a cycle way along the route of the old railway to Riverside Walk, Wyndham Hill and Summerhouse Hill, forming the Yeovil Country Park.

===Climate===
Like the rest of South West England, Yeovil has a temperate climate generally wetter and milder than the rest of the country. The annual mean temperature is about and shows seasonal and diurnal variation, but the sea has a modifying effect. January is the coldest month, with mean minimum temperatures between and . July and August are the warmest months, with mean daily maxima around .

The south-west of England is in a favoured location for the Azores high pressure zone, when it extends north-eastwards towards the UK, particularly in summer. However, convective cloud often forms inland, especially near hills, reducing the number of hours of sunshine, whose annual average annual is about 1,700 hours.

Rainfall tends to be associated with Atlantic depressions or with convection. The Atlantic depressions are more vigorous in autumn and winter, when most of the rain that falls in the south-west is from that source. Average rainfall is about . November to March have the highest mean wind speeds, with June to August having the lightest winds. The predominant wind direction is from the south-west.
==History==
Archaeological surveys have yielded Palaeolithic burial and settlement sites mainly to the south of the modern town, particularly in Hendford, where a Bronze Age golden torc (twisted collar) was found.

Yeovil is on the main Roman road from Dorchester to the Fosse Way at Ilchester. The route of the old road is aligned with the A37 from Dorchester, Hendford Hill, Rustywell, across the Westland site, to Larkhill Road and Vagg Lane, rejoining the A37 at the Halfway House pub in the Ilchester Road. The Westland site has evidence of a small Roman town. There were several Roman villas (estates) in the area. Finds have been made at East Coker, West Coker and Lufton.

===Medieval times===
Yeovil was first named in a Saxon charter dated 880 as Gifle. It derives from the Common Brittonic river-name &quot;gifl&quot; &quot;forked river&quot;, an earlier name of the River Yeo.

The estate was bequeathed in the will of King Alfred the Great to his youngest son Aethelweard. It was recorded in the Domesday Book as &quot;Givele&quot;, a thriving market community. The parish of Yeovil was part of the Stone Hundred. After the Norman Conquest, the manor, later known as Hendford, was granted to the Count of Eu and his tenant Hugh Maltravers, whose descendants became Earls of Arundel and held the lordship until 1561. In 1205 it was granted a charter by King John. By the 14th century, the town had gained the right to elect a portreeve.

The Black Death exacted a heavy toll, killing about half the population.

In 1499 a major fire destroyed many wooden, thatch-roofed buildings in the town. Yeovil suffered further fires in 1620 and 1643.

===Ownership===
After the dissolution of the monasteries, the lord of the manor was the family of John Horsey of Clifton Maybank from 1538 to 1610, followed by the Phelips family until 1846, when it passed to the Harbins of Newton Surmaville. Babylon Hill across the River Yeo to the south east of the town was the site of a minor skirmish, the Battle of Babylon Hill, during the Civil War, which resulted in the Earl of Bedford&#x27;s Roundheads forcing back Sir Ralph Hopton&#x27;s Cavaliers to Sherborne.

===Development===

In the 1800s Yeovil was a glove-making centre, whose the population expanded fast. In the mid-19th century it became linked to the rest of Britain by a complex of railway lines, with competition between the broad gauge lines of the Great Western Railway (GWR) and the standard gauge lines of the London and South Western Railway (LSWR). In 1853 the Great Western Railway line was opened between Taunton and Yeovil.

The town&#x27;s first railway was a branch line from the Bristol and Exeter Railway near Taunton to a terminus at on the western side of the town, which opened on 1 October 1853. As an associate of the GWR, this was a broad-gauge line. The GWR itself opened Yeovil Pen Mill railway station on the east side of the town as part of its route from London on 1 September 1856, extended to Weymouth on 1 January 1857), and the original line from Taunton connected with this. The LSWR route from London reached Hendford on 1 June 1860, but a month later the town was by-passed by an extension of the LSWR to Exeter. A new station at was provided south of the town from where passengers could catch a connecting service to Hendford. On 1 June 1861 passenger trains were withdrawn from Hendford and transferred to a new, more central, Yeovil Town railway station.

In 1854, the town gained borough status and had its first mayor. In the early 20th century Yeovil had around 11,000 inhabitants and was dominated by the defence industry, making it a target of German raids during World War II. The worst bombing was in 1940 and continued until 1942. During that time 107 high-explosive bombs fell on the town, 49 people died, 68 houses were totally destroyed and 2,377 damaged.

Industrial businesses developed around the Hendford railway goods station to such a degree that a small was opened on 2 May 1932 for passengers, but the growth of road transport and a desire to rationalise the rail network led to half of the railway stations in Yeovil being closed in 1964. First to go was Hendford Halt, closed on 15 June along with the line to Taunton, then closed on 2 October. Long-distance trains from Pen Mill were withdrawn on 11 September 1961, leaving only with a service to London, but the service between there and Pen Mill, the two remaining stations, was also withdrawn from 5 May 1968.

As a former centre of Britain&#x27;s leather industry, the town is post-industrial in character. Journalist John Harris, for instance, described the towns Taunton, Yeovil and Bridgwater as a &quot;post-industrial, hardscrabble place that contain[s] 19 of the council wards in the 20% of English areas classed as the most deprived.&quot;

==Governance==
Officially designated as Yeovil Municipal Borough in 1854, the town continued to lend its name to the area with the creation of the local government district of Yeovil on 1 April 1974, with the merging several neighbouring rural and urban districts, which later became South Somerset, a now-defunct district. Some suburbs fall within the civil parishes of Yeovil Without and Brympton.

Yeovil still has a town council, which took over the functions of the Charter Trustees in 1982. It has responsibility for the management of recreational and leisure facilities, open spaces and play areas. In 2005, Yeovil Town Council became the first large council in Somerset to be awarded Quality Town Council status. Yeovil Town Council is based at the Town House.
All other council services are provided by Somerset Council, a unitary authority established in April 2023.

There are five electoral wards covering Yeovil.

Yeovil is a county constituency represented in the House of Commons of the Parliament of the United Kingdom. It elects one Member of Parliament (MP). It covers the Somerset towns of Yeovil, Chard, Crewkerne and Ilminster. Until 1983 Somerset was split into four constituencies and Yeovil constituency also covered Ilchester, Martock and Somerton, but these were moved into the new constituency of Somerton and Frome. From the 2010 general election, Yeovil constituency regained Ilchester, to equalise the constituency populations. The Boundary Commission for England estimated the electorate of Yeovil constituency after the boundary changes to be 77,049. The current MP is Adam Dance of the Liberal Democrats, who was elected in July 2024.

==Demography==
At the 2011 census, the population of the built-up area (which extends beyond Yeovil civil parish to include the urban parts of Yeovil Without and Brympton parishes) was 45,784, forming 28% of the population of South Somerset district.
==Economy==

Leonardo manufactures helicopters in Yeovil, and Honeywell Aerospace, formerly Normalair Garratt, builder of aircraft oxygen systems, is also based there.

Yeovil&#x27;s role as a centre of the aircraft and defence industries continued into the 21st century, despite attempts to diversify and the creation of industrial estates. In January 1986 a proposed sale of Westland Helicopters to the US Sikorsky Aircraft group led to the Westland affair, a crisis in the Thatcher government, the resignation of Michael Heseltine as Secretary of State for Defence, and two weeks later the resignation of Secretary of State for Trade and Industry Leon Brittan, who admitted leaking a governmental law officer&#x27;s letter harshly critical of Heseltine. Leonardo, formerly AgustaWestland, created through the acquisition of Westland by Finmeccanica in 2000, remains the main employer in Yeovil.

Yeovil Aerodrome , (sometimes known as Yeovil/Westland &quot;Judwin&quot; to avoid confusion with nearby RNAS Yeovilton), is west of the town centre. British defence giant BAE Systems also runs a site producing high-integrity networked software, mainly for the armed forces.

Screwfix, based in Houndstone, started life as Woodscrew Supply Company in 1979. It is now a subsidiary of Kingfisher plc. The company warehouse relocated to Stoke-on-Trent after failing to gain planning permission for expansion.

Quedam Shopping Centre has some 45 shops: the usual high-street chains, several independents, and a multi-storey car park with about 650 spaces.

In 2015, leather manufacturer Pittards bought back its 1964 purpose-built tannery in Sherborne Road, Yeovil. In September 2023, the company went into administration.

==Landmarks==

One symbol of Yeovil is &quot;Jack the Treacle Eater&quot;, a folly consisting of a small archway topped by a turret with a statue on top. This stands in the village of Barwick, just to the south of the town. The hamstone Abbey Farm House was built about 1420 by John Stourton II, known as Jenkyn, as was Abbey Barn.

Hendford Manor in the town centre was built about 1720 and has since been converted into offices. It is a Grade II* listed building. Newton Surmaville is a small park and house also known as Newton House, built in 1608–1612 for Robert Harbin, a Yeovil merchant. It is a Grade I listed building.

* Yeovil Junction is on the London Waterloo to Exeter line, served by South Western Railway. It is located just over to the south of the town centre.

===Roads===
The town is on the A30; it was the main route between London and the South West until it was supplanted by the A303 to its north. Junction 25 of the M5 motorway lies around to the west, near Taunton, giving access to Bristol and the Midlands. Yeovil is also on the mainly single-carriageway A37 north–south road between Bristol and Weymouth.

==Sport==

The town&#x27;s football team, Yeovil Town F.C., plays in green and white livery at Huish Park, and currently competes in the National League. Known as the &quot;Glovers&quot; (referring to the town&#x27;s glove-making past), it was founded in 1895 and won, as Football Conference (the then name of National League) champions in 2003, promotion to the English Football League for the first time in its history. It had achieved numerous FA Cup victories over Football League sides in the past 50 years, and since joining the League has won promotion again – as League Two champions in 2005 and League One play-off winners in 2013. However, the stay in tier 2 of English football only lasted for a season. In women&#x27;s football, Yeovil Town L.F.C. was founded in 1990 and won promotion to England&#x27;s highest tier, the FA Women&#x27;s Super League, in 2016, before merging with Bridgwater United W.F.C. in 2021. Yeovil Town W.F.C. was then re-formed in January 2023. Other football teams in the town include Westland&#x27;s Sports F.C., which plays at Alvington Lane, and Pen Mill Athletic.

Yeovil Olympiads Athletics Club, founded in 1969, has produced many international athletes. The first was Eric Berry, who came 6th in the 1973 European Juniors in the hammer event. Olympians who started with the club include Max Robertson and Gary Jennings, both 400-metre hurdlers.

Yeovil is home to Ivel Barbarians Rugby Club, formed in 1995 by a merger of the Yeovil and Westlands clubs. South Somerset Warriors formed in 2010 and played in the South West Division of the Rugby League Conference until it folded in 2011.

In late July 2007, South Somerset District Council plans were made public by the &quot;Western Gazette&quot; to build a £21-million Yeovil Sports Zone on Yeovil Recreation Ground, which has been a popular open green space with the local community for over 70 years. Residents fought to protect it, leading to rejection of the proposals in 2009, and further consultations in 2010.

The recreation space known as Mudford Rec was frequented by England cricket star Ian Botham during a childhood stay in Yeovil. Another regeneration project would have meant demolishing Foundry House, a former glove factory, but a local campaign led to this becoming a listed building. It will now be converted into a restaurant and offices and new shop and houses built on the surrounding site.

==Popular culture==
Yeovil is known in Thomas Hardy&#x27;s Wessex as &quot;Ivell&quot;. It is also one of three main locations in John Cowper Powys&#x27;s 1929 novel, &quot;Wolf Solent&quot;.

Local band The Chesterfields released a single called &quot;Last train to Yeovil&quot; and pop band Bubblegum Splash a song called &quot;18:10 to Yeovil Junction&quot;. The folk band Show of Hands wrote a song called &quot;Yeovil Town&quot; about violence and crime they experienced after playing a small gig in Yeovil.

<text>Judd Alan Gregg (born February 14, 1947) is an American politician and attorney who served as the 76th governor of New Hampshire from 1989 to 1993 and a United States senator from New Hampshire from 1993 to 2011 where he was Chairman of the Health Committee and the Budget Committee. A member of the Republican Party, he was a businessman and attorney in Nashua before entering politics. Gregg currently serves as the Chair of the Public Advisory Board at the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College.

Gregg was nominated for Secretary of Commerce in the Cabinet by President Barack Obama, but withdrew his name on February 12, 2009. He chose not to run for reelection to the Senate in 2010; former State Attorney General Kelly Ayotte, also a Republican, was elected to succeed him.

On May 27, 2011, Goldman Sachs announced that Gregg had been named an international advisor to the firm. In May 2013, Gregg was named the CEO of the Securities Industry and Financial Markets Association, a Wall Street lobbying group. He later stepped down as CEO in December 2013 and became a senior adviser.

For the 2016 presidential election Gregg endorsed former Florida Governor Jeb Bush, and upon Bush&#x27;s suspension of his campaign Gregg endorsed Ohio Governor John Kasich. In the 2024 Republican Party presidential primary, he endorsed Nikki Haley.

==Early life==

Born in Nashua, New Hampshire, he is the son of Catherine Gregg (née Warner) and Hugh Gregg, who was Governor from 1953 to 1955. Gregg graduated from Phillips Exeter Academy in 1965. Gregg received his baccalaureate from Columbia University in 1969 and, from Boston University School of Law, a Juris Doctor in 1972 and a Master of Laws in 1975.

==Early political career==

The first elective office held by Gregg was a seat on the Executive Council of New Hampshire, a post which he held from 1979 to 1981. He was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1980, and was reelected in 1982, 1984 and 1986.

He declined to run for re-election in 1988, and ran for Governor of New Hampshire instead. He won that election and was re-elected in 1990, New Hampshire being one of two states (Vermont is the other) that continues to elect its governors to two-year, rather than four-year, terms. As Governor, he balanced the budget, leaving the office in 1993 with a $21 million surplus. However, his political opponents in the 1990s attacked Judd for the state&#x27;s weak economy and his Vietnam War deferments.

==U.S. Senate tenure==

===Elections===
In 1992, Gregg decided to run for the U.S. Senate seat being vacated by two-term Republican Warren Rudman. He defeated Democrat John Rauh, and took his seat as a United States Senator in 1993. He was re-elected to a second term in 1998 after defeating George Condodemetraky. He ran for a third term in 2004 and defeated campaign finance activist Doris &quot;Granny D&quot; Haddock, the then 94-year-old Democratic nominee, by 66% to 34%.

After withdrawing from his nomination to become United States Secretary of Commerce in the presidential administration of Democrat Barack Obama on February 12, 2009, Gregg said he would &quot;probably not&quot; seek reelection in 2010, when his term of office was set to expire.

===Leadership===
In January 2005, Gregg was elected to chair the U.S. Senate Committee on Budget by the Senate Republican Conference, and steadfastly supported lower spending. 

On November 14, 2008 Gregg was appointed by United States Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell to serve on the five-member Congressional Oversight Panel created to oversee the implementation of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act. Gregg &quot;stepped aside&quot; on December 1, citing his Senate workload:

===Platform===
Judd Gregg is a moderate Republican. He is fiscally conservative and socially moderate. The non-partisan &quot;National Journal&quot; gave then-Senator Gregg a composite ideology rating of 65% conservative and 35% liberal.

Republicans for Environmental Protection issued Gregg an &quot;environmental harm demerit&quot; for sponsoring the 2006 S.C. Resolution 83, which according to REP &quot;included only one revenue-raising instruction to Senate appropriations committees, an abuse of the congressional budget process in order to force oil drilling in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge&quot;, and &quot;would perpetuate America&#x27;s dangerous oil dependence and damage the most scenic, wildlife-rich reserve in the circumpolar north.&quot; Nonetheless, the same organization praised Gregg, together with John E. Sununu, for their work to pass the New England Wilderness act, which classified nearly of New Hampshire and Vermont as wilderness. In 2006, Gregg received a score of 43% from the nonpartisan League of Conservation Voters.

The University of New Hampshire renamed its Environmental Technology Building Gregg Hall, because Gregg used earmarks to secure $266 million of federal funds for research and development projects for the university. The Judd Gregg Meteorology Institute (JGMI), established in 2003, is the center of meteorological and atmospheric research at Plymouth State University in Plymouth, NH, which offers the only meteorology degree program in the state. The Senator was also instrumental in the establishing of the New Hampshire Institute of Politics at Saint Anselm College in 1999.

In 2007, Gregg voted for the Clean Energy Act of 2007 (H.R. 6) and the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act of 2007 (S. 1639).

In October 2009, Gregg said, &quot;You talk about systemic risk. The systemic risk today is the Congress of the United States ... we&#x27;re creating these massive debts which we&#x27;re passing on to our children ... (the figures) mean we&#x27;re basically on the path to a banana republic-type of financial situation in this country. &quot;

Gregg has a moderate record on social issues. In June 2006, he joined six of his fellow Republicans in voting against the Federal Marriage Amendment. In April 2007, he was among the breakaway Republicans to support the Stem Cell Research Enhancement Act. However, his record on the issue of abortion is otherwise a solidly anti-abortion one. Gregg has voted for some gun control measures and against others. He voted against the Brady Bill, but in recent years has voted for trigger control locks on firearms and in favor of the ban on assault weapons.

On December 17, 2009, Gregg voted to extend Chairman Ben Bernanke&#x27;s term.

===Presidential politics===
During the 2004 Presidential Election, Gregg stood in for John Kerry during practice sessions held by George W. Bush in preparation for the 2004 United States Presidential Election Debates. Four years earlier he had played the part of Al Gore for the same purpose.

On October 29, 2007, Gregg endorsed Mitt Romney, former Governor of Massachusetts, to be the Republican nominee for President of the United States.

Gregg has not foreclosed the possibility of running for President himself after he leaves the Senate but he has said it&#x27;s &quot;not likely&quot;:

===The Spanish Justice System and Guantanamo Bay===

In April 2009, Senator Gregg was sent to accompany an American diplomat to speak with a Spanish diplomat Luis Felipe Fernández de la Peña after a war crimes case was filed by Spanish NGO Association for the Dignity of Spanish Prisoners at the Audiencia Nacional of Spain accusing them of crimes in Iraq and Guantanamo Bay. The case targeted six former US government officials for allegedly violating the Geneva Convention, the 1984 Convention Against Torture, and the 1998 Rome Statute. The six accused were: Alberto Gonzales, David Addington, William Haynes, Douglas Feith, Jay Bybee, and John Yoo.

===Controversies===
In the Senate, Gregg was the leading Republican negotiator and author of the TARP program, which bailed out financial institutions, while he had a multimillion-dollar investment in Bank of America. After leaving the Senate Gregg became an advisor to the investment bank Goldman Sachs.

In February 2009, the Associated Press reported that Gregg and his family had profited personally from federal earmarks secured by the senator for the redevelopment of the Pease Air Force Base in Portsmouth, New Hampshire into an industrial park. According to Senate records, Gregg has collected from $240,017 to $651,801 from his investments in Pease Air Force Base, while helping to arrange at least $66 million in federal aid for the former base. Gregg has denied any wrongdoing in the matter and claimed that his withdrawal from consideration for the Commerce Secretary was unrelated to the White House&#x27;s discovery during the vetting process of his involvement in his family&#x27;s real estate investments in Pease. Gregg explained away his actions by saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve throughout my entire lifetime been involved in my family&#x27;s businesses and that&#x27;s just the way our family works. We support each other and our activities.&quot;

Gregg as a member of President Barack Obama&#x27;s deficit commission defended cutting Social Security by quoting Willie Sutton who, when asked why he robbed banks, replied, &quot;because that&#x27;s where the money is.&quot;

==Commerce Secretary nomination and withdrawal==

On February 2, 2009, &quot;Politico&quot; and CNN reported that Gregg accepted President Obama&#x27;s offer to be the next United States Secretary of Commerce. If Gregg had been confirmed by the Senate, he would have had to resign his Senate seat and be replaced with an appointment by Democratic Governor John Lynch. Sources from both parties confirmed that Gregg&#x27;s former chief of staff, Republican Bonnie Newman, would have been chosen to replace him. &quot;The Washington Post&quot; had alleged that Gregg would not accept the appointment unless Governor Lynch agreed to appoint a Republican to fill his seat until 2010. In February 2009, many news outlets noted that Gregg had in 1995 voted to abolish the United States Department of Commerce. Although Gregg stated that he supported the stimulus package promoted by President Obama, he clarified that he would recuse himself from voting on the package.

With reports that the Obama Administration would move the United States Census Bureau, typically run by the Commerce Department, out of Gregg&#x27;s jurisdiction, Republican leaders urged Obama to allow Gregg to run the census or withdraw Gregg&#x27;s nomination. On February 12, 2009, Gregg withdrew his name from consideration for the position of United States Commerce Secretary, citing disagreements with issues surrounding the census and the stimulus bill. White House Press Secretary Robert Gibbs issued a statement regarding Gregg&#x27;s withdrawal in which he accused the senator of not following through on his alleged statements of support for Obama&#x27;s economic agenda made during the vetting process:

While speaking to press afterward, Gregg acknowledged responsibility for his decision and accepted the blame for accepting and then rejecting the Commerce Secretary nomination.

In an interview response to the AP, Gregg was quoted as saying,

For 30 years, I&#x27;ve been my own person in charge of my own views, and I guess I hadn&#x27;t really focused on the job of working for somebody else and carrying their views, and so this is basically where it came out.

In February 2009, the Associated Press reported that Gregg and his family had profited personally from federal earmarks secured by the Senator for the redevelopment of the Pease Air Force Base into an industrial park. According to Senate records, Gregg has collected from $240,017 to $651,801 from his investments in Pease Air Force Base, while helping to arrange at least $66 million in federal aid for the former base. Gregg claimed that his withdrawal from consideration for the Commerce Secretary was unrelated to the White House&#x27;s discovery during the vetting process of his involvement in his family&#x27;s real estate investments in Pease.

==Personal life==
Gregg belongs to the Congregationalist Church. He is married to Kathleen MacLellan Gregg. They have two daughters, Molly and Sarah, and a son, Joshua.

Gregg won more than $850,000 in 2005 from the D.C. Lottery after buying $20 worth of Powerball tickets at a Washington, D.C. convenience store.

<doc id="368402" wikidata="Q261147" url="?curid=368402" title="Barbara Mikulski">
<text>Barbara Ann Mikulski ( ; born July 20, 1936) is an American politician and social worker who served as a United States senator from Maryland from 1987 to 2017. A member of the Democratic Party, she also served in the United States House of Representatives from 1977 to 1987. Mikulski is the third-longest-serving female United States Senator, and the longest-serving U.S. Senator in Maryland history.

Raised in the Fells Point neighborhood of East Baltimore, Mikulski attended Mount Saint Agnes College and the University of Maryland School of Social Work. Originally a social worker and community organizer, she was elected to the Baltimore City Council in 1971 after delivering a highly publicized address on the &quot;ethnic movement&quot; in America. She was elected to the House of Representatives in 1976, and in 1986, she became the first woman elected to the United States Senate from Maryland.

From the death of Senator Daniel Inouye in December 2012 until 2015, Mikulski chaired the Senate Appropriations Committee. She was the first woman and first Marylander to hold the position. At her retirement, she was the ranking minority member of the committee. She also served on the Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions Committee and the Select Committee on Intelligence.

On March 2, 2015, Mikulski announced that she would retire after five terms in the Senate and would not seek reelection in 2016. In January 2017, Mikulski joined Johns Hopkins University as a professor of public policy and advisor to University President Ronald J. Daniels.

==Early life, education, and career==
Mikulski was born and raised in the Fell&#x27;s Point neighborhood of East Baltimore, the eldest of the three daughters of Christine Eleanor (&quot;née&quot; Kutz) and William Mikulski. Her parents were both of Polish descent; her immigrant great-grandparents had owned a bakery in Baltimore. During her high school years at the Institute of Notre Dame, she worked in her parents&#x27; grocery store, delivering groceries to elderly neighbors who were unable to leave their homes.

After graduating with a Bachelor of Arts in Sociology from Mount Saint Agnes College (now a part of Loyola University Maryland) in 1958, she obtained her master&#x27;s degree in social work (MSW) from the University of Maryland School of Social Work in 1965. She worked as a social worker for Catholic charities and Baltimore&#x27;s Department of Social Services, helping at-risk children and educating seniors about the Medicare program. Mikulski became an activist social worker when she heard about plans to build Interstate 95 through Baltimore&#x27;s Fells Point and Canton neighborhoods. She helped organize communities on both sides of the city and successfully fought to stop the construction of the road. Her efforts to prevent the highway from running through Southeast Baltimore also resulted in the establishment of the Southeast Community Organization, a non-profit which worked to improve Baltimore neighborhoods.

==Early political career==
Mikulski first received national attention in 1970 because of her remarks at a conference at The Catholic University of America regarding &quot;Ethnic Americans&quot; convened by Msgr. Geno Baroni. Her message became one of the major documents of the &quot;ethnic movement&quot;. Mikulski&#x27;s remarks included the following:

Mikulski&#x27;s activism led to a seat on the Baltimore City Council in 1971. In 1973 incoming Chairperson of the Democratic National Committee Robert S. Strauss appointed then Baltimore City Councilperson Mikulski to chair the Democratic Party Commission on New Delegate Selection and Party Structure. She was instrumental in solidifying democratizing reforms to the national delegate selection process.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 1976, Paul Sarbanes gave up his seat in Maryland&#x27;s 3rd congressional district to make a successful run for the Senate. Mikulski won a crowded seven-way Democratic primary—the key election given a heavily Democratic district—and won easily in the November elections. She was reelected four more times, never facing substantive opposition.

==U.S. Senate==

===Elections===

Mikulski first ran for the U.S. Senate in 1974, winning the Democratic nomination to face Republican incumbent Charles Mathias. Although well known to residents in her city, Mikulski had limited name recognition in the rest of the state.

As an advocate for campaign finance reform, Mathias refused to accept any contribution over $100 to &quot;avoid the curse of big money that has led to so much trouble in the last year&quot;. However, he still managed to raise over $250,000, nearly five times Mikulski&#x27;s total. Ideologically, Mikulski and Mathias agreed on many issues, such as closing tax loopholes and easing taxes on the middle class. On two issues, however, Mathias argued to reform Congress and the U.S. tax system to address inflation and corporate price fixing, contrary to Mikulski. In retrospect, &quot;The Washington Post&quot; felt the election was &quot;an intelligent discussion of state, national, and foreign affairs by two smart, well-informed people&quot;.

With Maryland voters, Mathias benefited from his frequent disagreements with the Nixon administration and his liberal voting record. On November 5, 1974, he was re-elected by a 57% to 43% margin, though he lost badly in Baltimore City and Baltimore County, where Mikulski was popular. This election is the only election that Mikulski has ever lost.

Mathias announced his retirement before the 1986 elections. At the time of this announcement, it was expected that then-Governor Harry Hughes would be the favorite to succeed Mathias. However, Hughes became caught up in the aftermath of the Maryland savings and loan crisis. He lost popularity with voters, opening the door for Mikulski&#x27;s bid for the Senate. The Republican nominee was Linda Chavez, who left her post as Assistant to the President for Public Liaison in an attempt to win the seat. The election was the second time in modern U.S. history that two women faced each other in a statewide general election. The race was covered by national media, with observers noting that Chavez was very unlikely to win.

In the campaign, Chavez attacked Mikulski, a lifelong Baltimore resident, as a &quot;San Francisco-style, George McGovern, liberal Democrat&quot;. Chavez was accused of making Mikulski&#x27;s sexual orientation a central issue of the political campaign. Chavez wrote that the term referred to Jeane Kirkpatrick&#x27;s 1984 Republican National Convention &quot;Blame America First&quot; speech, in which she coined the phrase &quot;San Francisco Liberal&quot; in reference to the Democratic National Convention in San Francisco. Using political advertisements and press conferences, Chavez attacked Mikulski&#x27;s former aide Teresa Brennan as &quot;anti-male&quot; and a &quot;radical feminist&quot;, implying that Brennan and Mikulski were radical lesbians and that &quot;fascist feminism&quot; was Mikulski&#x27;s political philosophy. Brennan had not been part of Mikulski&#x27;s staff for five years, but Chavez implied Brennan was still working on Mikulski&#x27;s campaign. Mikulski did not respond in kind to the attacks. She defeated Chavez with 61% of the vote. She also served alongside Paul Sarbanes, the man she&#x27;d succeeded in the House.

Mikulski, popularly known as &quot;Senator Barb&quot;, was re-elected with large majorities in 1992, 1998, 2004, and 2010. Having won re-election in 2010, she has surpassed Margaret Chase Smith as the longest-serving female senator. ABC News named Mikulski its &quot;Person of the Week&quot; for that milestone. On March 17, 2012, she became the longest-serving female member of Congress in the history of the United States, surpassing the previous record-holder, Rep. Edith Nourse Rogers of Massachusetts, who served from 1925 to 1960.

In September 2009, the &quot;tell-all&quot; book &quot;The Clinton Tapes&quot; revealed that during the 2000 presidential election, President Bill Clinton suggested Mikulski as a running mate for Al Gore, who instead chose his colleague Joe Lieberman. In 2007, Mikulski endorsed her colleague, Sen. Hillary Clinton (D-NY), for President of the United States, praising her as a leader and citing her desire to break the &quot;glass ceiling&quot; by electing the first woman president. Senator Mikulski nominated Hillary Clinton for President of the United States at the Democratic National Convention on July 26, 2016.

From 2007 to 2017, Mikulski served alongside Ben Cardin, who succeeded her in the 3rd District and held it for 20 years until succeeding Sarbanes in the Senate.

===Legislation===
On June 3, 2013, Mikulski introduced the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 2013 (S. 1086; 113th Congress), which passed in the Senate. The bill would reauthorize the Child Care and Development Block Grant Act of 1990 to provide block grants to the states to help low-income parents find child care for their children. In addition to reauthorizing the program, it also makes amendments to the law to try to improve it. Some of those improvements include required background checks on grant recipients and annual inspections. Mikulski argued that &quot;this bill ensures that all children get the care they need and deserve.&quot;

On April 1, 2014, Mikulski introduced the Paycheck Fairness Act (S. 2199; 113th Congress), a measure that aims to strengthen the Fair Labor Standards Act&#x27;s protections against pay inequalities based on gender. It is a bill that &quot;punishes employers for retaliating against workers who share wage information, puts the justification burden on employers as to why someone is paid less and allows workers to sue for punitive damages of wage discrimination&quot;. Mikulski said that &quot;it brings tears to my eyes to know women are working so hard and being paid less&quot; and that &quot;it makes me emotional when I hear that... I get angry, I get outraged and I get volcanic&quot;.

===Committee assignments===
In the 114th Congress, Mikulski served on the following Senate committees (standing committees in bold):
* Committee on Appropriations (Ranking Member)
** Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies (Ranking Member)
** Subcommittee on Defense
** Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies
** Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations, and Related Programs
** Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies
** As Ranking Member of the full committee, Mikulski may serve as an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of any subcommittee of which she is not a full member
* Committee on Health, Education, Labor, and Pensions
** Subcommittee on Children and Families
** Subcommittee on Primary Health and Aging
* Select Committee on Intelligence

===Other===
Women were not allowed to wear pants on the U.S. Senate floor until 1993. In 1993, Senators Mikulski and Carol Moseley Braun wore pants onto the floor in defiance of the rule, and female support staff followed soon after, with the rule being amended later that year by Senate Sergeant-at-Arms Martha Pope to allow women to wear pants on the floor so long as they also wore a jacket.

In 2014, Mikulski was voted the &quot;meanest senator&quot; in &quot;Washingtonian&quot;&#x27;s survey of congressional staffers.

==Political positions==
Mikulski was one of 11 senators to vote against both the 1991 and 2002 resolutions authorizing the use of force in Iraq.

Mikulski has opposed predatory lending, and has been an outspoken opponent of Fairbanks Capital (now Select Portfolio Servicing), alleged to have illegally foreclosed on over 100 homes in Maryland.

Mikulski has been an outspoken advocate for the Equal Rights Amendment. She has also spoken in support of abortion rights and has stated she does not view the opposition to this issue as misogynistic.

On October 1, 2008, Mikulski voted in favor of HR1424, the Senate version of the Emergency Economic Stabilization Act of 2008, which provided a $700 billion bailout to the United States financial market.

In October 2013, Mikulski sponsored a bill honoring naturopathic medicine.

==Awards and honors==

In 1979, the Supersisters trading card set was produced and distributed; one of the cards featured Mikulski&#x27;s name and picture.

The NASA-funded Space Telescope Science Institute (STScI) in Baltimore named one of the world&#x27;s largest astronomy databases after Mikulski (Barbara A. Mikulski Archive for Space Telescopes), as she was a long time champion of the Hubble and James Webb space telescopes.

In 2011, Mikulski was inducted into the National Women&#x27;s Hall of Fame.

In 2012, when NASA discovered an exploding star, they named it &quot;Supernova Mikulski&quot; in her honor. Also in 2012, Mikulski was presented the Harriet Ross Tubman Lifetime Achievement Award by the Maryland African American Tourism Council.

On August 22, 2013 the President of Poland Bronisław Komorowski honored Mikulski with a Commander&#x27;s Cross with Star of the Order of Polonia Restituta for &quot;outstanding achievements in the development of Polish-American cooperation and activity for Poles living in the United States&quot;.

In November 2015, Mikulski was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President Barack Obama at a ceremony in the White House.

In 2020, the Senator Barbara A. Mikulski Room, with mementos and Mikulski’s Presidential Medal of Freedom, was opened in the Enoch Pratt Free Library.

On June 8, 2022, a room in the United States Capitol was named after Mikulski. It is the Barbara Mikulski room, S-115, located on the first floor of the side of the Capitol where the Senate is. It is one of the first two rooms in the Capitol to be named after women who were senators, the other being the Margaret Chase Smith room, which was named on the same day.

==Personal life==
Barbara Mikulski never married and has no children. She is only 4 ft 11 in (150 cm) tall and often jokingly said: &quot;I may be short, but I won&#x27;t be overlooked&quot;. She is a Roman Catholic. Raised in a Polish-American and devoutly Catholic family, Mikulski attended the Mount Saint Agnes College in Baltimore and considered joining Sisters of Mercy, but ultimately decided against it. Discussing her decision to remain a laywoman, she stated: &quot;The vow of obedience did not have great appeal for me. Poverty was one thing, and I could go along with chastity. But it was obedience. I thought, &#x27;My God, all my life there could be someone telling me what to do and where to go!&#x27; And inside me beats the heart of a protestor.&quot;

<doc id="368404" wikidata="Q1895804" url="?curid=368404" title="Paul Sarbanes">
<text>Paul Spyros Sarbanes (; February 3, 1933 – December 6, 2020) was an American politician and attorney from Maryland. A member of the Democratic Party, he served in both chambers of the United States Congress as a member of the United States House of Representatives from 1971 to 1977 and as a member of the United States Senate from 1977 to 2007. Sarbanes was the longest-serving senator in the History of Maryland until he was surpassed by Barbara Mikulski by a single day when her term ended on January 3, 2017. He was the first Greek American senator.

Born in Salisbury, Maryland, Sarbanes was a graduate of Princeton University, Balliol College, Oxford, and Harvard Law School. Elected to the Maryland House of Delegates in 1966, he went on to serve two terms in the Maryland House from 1967 to 1971. In 1970, he won a seat in the United States House of Representatives, representing Maryland&#x27;s 4th congressional district and later Maryland&#x27;s 3rd congressional district from 1971 to 1977.

In 1976, he ran for the United States Senate, defeating Republican incumbent J. Glenn Beall Jr. with 59% of the vote. Sarbanes was re-elected four times, each time receiving no less than 59% of the vote. He did not seek re-election in 2006, when he was succeeded by fellow Democrat Ben Cardin. Sarbanes was known for his low-key style, often shunning the limelight over his thirty-year Senate career. He was a coauthor of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act, which is generally noted as his most noteworthy piece of legislation.

==Early life==
Sarbanes was born on Maryland&#x27;s Eastern Shore in the city of Salisbury to Greek immigrant parents, Matina (née Tsigounis) and Spyros P. Sarbanes, who had emigrated from Laconia, Greece and owned a Salisbury restaurant.

A graduate of Wicomico High School in Salisbury, Maryland, Sarbanes attended Princeton University, where (like the younger Bill Bradley) he played basketball and earned a bachelor&#x27;s degree in 1954 from the Princeton School of Public and International Affairs after completing a senior thesis titled &quot;The Smith Act: A Denial of American Freedoms&quot;. At Princeton, Sarbanes was a member of the American Whig–Cliosophic Society. As a senior, he received the Moses Taylor Pyne Honor Prize, Princeton&#x27;s highest undergraduate honor. He also was awarded a Rhodes Scholarship that brought him to Balliol College of the University of Oxford in Oxford, England. He graduated with a First Class degree in 1957. Sarbanes then returned to the United States and attended Harvard Law School.

After graduating in 1960, he clerked for Federal Judge Morris Ames Soper before entering private practice with two Baltimore law firms.

==Political career==
===State legislature===
In 1966, Sarbanes ran for the Maryland House of Delegates in Baltimore and won. During his four years as a State delegate in Annapolis, Maryland he served on both the Judiciary and the Ways and Means Committees.

===U.S. House of Representatives===
Sarbanes was elected to the United States House of Representatives in 1970 from the fourth district of Maryland and was reelected in 1972 and 1974 from the third district. While in the House, Sarbanes served on the Judiciary Committee, the Merchant Marine and Fisheries Committee, and the Select Committee on House Reorganization.

As a member of the Judiciary Committee he participated in the impeachment process against Richard Nixon. On July 26, 1974, he introduced the first articles of impeachment against President Nixon for obstruction of justice.


===U.S. Senate===
Sarbanes was elected to the United States Senate in 1976 and re-elected in 1982, 1988, 1994, and 2000. In 2002, he was the United States Senate sponsor of the Sarbanes–Oxley Act of 2002, which reformed federal securities laws in the wake of the 2002 accounting scandals.

Sarbanes served on the following Senate committees:
* Ranking Member, Banking, Housing and Urban Affairs
* Ranking Member, Special Whitewater
* Senior Member, Foreign Relations
* Senior Member, Budget
* Senior Member, Joint Economic

By 1981, Sarbanes was noted as a frequent critic of military budgets. In spite of this, in May of that year, he voted in favor of approving a Reagan administration-backed $136.5 billion military authorization bill. In December, he voted in favor of an amendment to President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s MX missiles proposal that would divert the silo system by $334 million as well as earmark further research for other methods that would allow giant missiles to be based. While the military authorization bill was seen as supporting the administration, the December vote was viewed as a rebuff of Reagan.

On March 11, 2005, Sarbanes, the longest-serving senator in Maryland history, announced at a news conference his decision not to seek re-election in 2006. Colleagues of Sarbanes said that the reason for his retirement from the Senate was due to his annoyance with not having any leadership roles on committees.

Sarbanes received the Foreign Language Advocacy Award in 2007 from the Northeast Conference on the Teaching of Foreign Languages in recognition of his lifelong commitment to the values, languages, and cultures of the ancient world in service to the modern world.

==Personal life and death==
In June 1960, Sarbanes married Christine Dunbar of Brighton, England; they had three children (John Sarbanes, Michael Anthony Sarbanes, and Janet Matina Sarbanes) and seven grandchildren. Christine Sarbanes died of cancer on March 22, 2009. Sarbanes held the highest lay office in the Greek Orthodox Church, &quot;Order of St. Andrew, Archon of the Ecumenical Patriarchate&quot; and was a member of the Greek Orthodox Cathedral of the Annunciation in Baltimore.

His son, John Sarbanes, won the general election for Maryland&#x27;s 3rd congressional district in 2006, the district that Paul Sarbanes represented prior to his election as senator.

Paul Sarbanes died at his home in Baltimore on December 6, 2020, at the age of 87.

In April 2021, Wicomico Public Libraries announced that the library in downtown Salisbury would be renamed after Sarbanes.

<doc id="368408" wikidata="Q2105495" url="?curid=368408" title="1383–1385 Portuguese interregnum">
<text>The 1383–1385 Portuguese interregnum was a war of succession in Portuguese history during which no crowned king of Portugal reigned. The interregnum began when King Ferdinand I died without a male heir and ended when King John I was crowned in 1385 after his victory during the Battle of Aljubarrota.

The Portuguese interpret the era as their earliest national resistance movement to counter Castilian intervention, and Robert Durand considers it as the &quot;great revealer of national consciousness&quot;.

The bourgeoisie and the nobility worked together to establish the Aviz dynasty, a branch of the Portuguese House of Burgundy, securely on an independent throne. That contrasted with the lengthy civil wars in France (Hundred Years&#x27; War) and England (War of the Roses), which had aristocratic factions fighting powerfully against a centralised monarchy.

It is usually known in Portugal as the 1383–1385 Crisis (&quot;Crise de 1383–1385&quot;).

==Background==
In 1383, King Ferdinand I of Portugal was dying. From his marriage to Leonor Telles de Menezes, only Princess Beatrice of Portugal survived. Her marriage was the major political issue of the day since it would determine the future of the kingdom.

Several political factions lobbied for possible husbands, which included English and French princes. Finally, the king settled for his wife&#x27;s first choice, King John I of Castile. Ferdinand had waged three wars against Castile during his reign, and the marriage, celebrated in May 1383, was intended to put an end to hostilities by a union of the two crowns but was not a widely-accepted solution. The dynastic union meant that Portugal would lose independence to Castile. Many nobles were fiercely opposed to that possibility but were not united under a common pretender to the crown. There were two candidates, both illegitimate half-brothers of Ferdinand:

*John, son of Peter I of Portugal and Inês de Castro, then lived in Castile.
*John, Great Master of Aviz, another natural son of Peter I, was very popular among the Portuguese middle class and traditional aristocracy.

On October 22, 1383, King Ferdinand died. According to the marriage contract, Dowager Queen Leonor assumed regency in the name of her daughter Beatrice and son-in-law, John I of Castile. Since diplomatic opposition was no longer possible, the party for independence took more drastic measures, which started the 1383–1385 crisis.

==1383==
The regent&#x27;s privy council made the error of excluding any representation of the merchants of Lisbon. On the other hand, the popular classes of Lisbon, Beja, Porto, Évora, Estremoz, Portalegre and some other municipalities of the kingdom rose in favour of John (João), Master of Avis, seeing him as the national candidate (and the preferred national candidate). The first move was taken by the faction of John of Aviz in December 1383. João Fernandes Andeiro, Count of Ourém, called Conde Andeiro, the detested lover of the dowager queen, was murdered by a group of conspirators led by João of Aviz. Following this act, John, acclaimed &quot;rector and defender of the realm&quot; by the people of Lisbon, and also supported by the city&#x27;s great merchants, was now the leader of the opposition to the pretensions of John I of Castile, who tried to be recognised as monarch iure uxoris, against the Treaty of Salvaterra.

==1384==

The armed resistance met the Castilian army on April 6, 1384, in the Battle of Atoleiros. General Nuno Álvares Pereira won the battle for the Aviz party, but victory was not decisive. John I of Castile then retreated to Lisbon in May and besieged the capital, with an auxiliary fleet blocking the city&#x27;s port in the river Tagus, in a severe drawback to the independence cause. Without the capital and its riches and commerce, little could be done to free the country from the Castilian king. On his side, John I of Castile needed Lisbon, not only for financial reasons, but also for political ones—neither he nor Beatrice had been crowned as monarchs of Portugal, and without a coronation in the capital he was only a designated king.

Meanwhile, John of Aviz had surrendered the military command of the resistance to Nuno Álvares Pereira. The general continued to attack cities loyal to the Castilians and to harass the invading army. John of Aviz was now focused on diplomatic offensives. International politics played an important role in deciding Portuguese affairs. In 1384, the Hundred Years&#x27; War was at its peak, with English and French forces in a struggle for the crown of France. The conflict spilled beyond the French borders, and influenced, for instance, the Western Schism in a papacy only recently moved to Avignon from Rome. Castile was a traditional ally of France, so, looking for assistance in England was the natural option for John of Aviz. In May, with Lisbon under siege, an embassy was sent to Richard II of England to make a case for Portuguese independence. Richard was seventeen years old in 1384, and power lay with his uncle John of Gaunt, 1st Duke of Lancaster and regent of England. Despite initial reluctance to concede men, John of Gaunt finally agreed to levy troops to reinforce the Portuguese army.

Lisbon was struggling with famine and feared defeat by the Castilian siege. Blocked by land and by the river, the city had no hope of relief by the Aviz army, which was too small to risk an intervention and was occupied subduing other cities. An attempt was made by a Portuguese fleet to relieve the Castilian blockade. On July 18 a group of ships led by captain Rui Pereira managed to break the blockade and deliver precious supplies of food to Lisbon. The cost was high, since three of four boats were seized and Rui Pereira himself died in the naval combat. Despite this minor success, the siege held on; the city of Almada on the south bank of the Tagus surrendered to Castile. But the siege was hard not only on the inhabitants of Lisbon: the army of Castile was also dealing with a shortage of food supplies, due to the harassment of Nuno Álvares Pereira, and the bubonic plague. It was the outbreak of an epidemic in his ranks that forced John I of Castile to raise the siege on September 3 and retreat to Castile. Weeks later, the Castilian fleet also abandoned the Tagus, and Lisbon avoided conquest.

==1385==
In late 1384 and the early months of 1385, Nuno Álvares Pereira and John of Aviz pursued the war, but they did not manage to subdue the majority of those Portuguese cities then in favour of the Castilian cause. Answering the call for help, English troops (an Anglo-Gascon contingent) landed in Portugal on Easter Day. They were not a big contingent, around 600 men (of which about 100 would be present in Ajubarrota), but they were mainly veterans of the Hundred Years&#x27; War battles and thereby well schooled in successful English military tactics. Among them were a small number of longbowmen who had already demonstrated their value against cavalry charges.

At the same time, John of Aviz organised a meeting in Coimbra of the &quot;Cortes&quot;, the assembly of the kingdom. There, on April 6, he was proclaimed the tenth king of Portugal, a clear act of defiance against the Castilian pretensions. John I of Portugal nominated Nuno Álvares Pereira Constable of Portugal and went to subdue the resistance still surviving in the north.

John I of Castile was not pleased. His first move was to send a punitive expedition, but the forces were heavily defeated in the Battle of Trancoso in May. From January, he began preparing his army to solve the problem definitively. The king himself led an enormous Castilian army that invaded Portugal in the second week of June through the central north, from Celorico da Beira to Coimbra and Leiria. An allied contingent of French heavy cavalry travelled with them. The power of numbers was on their side—about 32,000 men on the Castilian side versus 6,500 on the Portuguese. They immediately headed to the region of Lisbon and Santarém, the country&#x27;s major cities.

Meanwhile, the armies of John I of Portugal and Nuno Álvares Pereira joined together in the city of Tomar. After some debate, a decision was made: the Castilians could not be allowed to besiege Lisbon once again, since the city would undoubtedly fall, so the Portuguese would intercept the enemy in the vicinity of Leiria, near the village of Aljubarrota. On August 14, the Castilian army, very slow due to its huge numbers, finally met the Portuguese and English troops. The ensuing fight, the Battle of Aljubarrota, was fought in the style of the Battles of Crécy and Poitiers. These tactics allowed a reduced infantry army to defeat cavalrymen with the use of longbowmen in the flanks and defensive structures (like caltrops) in the front. The Castilian army was not only defeated, but annihilated. Their losses were so great that John I of Castile was prevented from attempting another invasion in the following years.

==Legacy==
With this victory, John of Aviz was recognised as the undisputed king of Portugal as John I, putting an end to the &quot;interregnum&quot; and anarchy of the 1383–1385 crisis. Recognition from Castile would not arrive until 1411, after another Portuguese victory at the Battle of Valverde, with the signing of the Treaty of Ayllón. The English–Portuguese alliance would be renewed in 1386 with the Treaty of Windsor and the marriage of John I to Philippa of Lancaster, daughter of John of Gaunt. In 1387, taking advantage of the renewed alliance, John I, leading a Portuguese army of 9,000 men, reinforced by a 1,500-man English contingent that landed in Galicia, invaded Castile to sit John of Gaunt on the Castilian throne, which he claimed on his marriage to Infanta Constance of Castile. The Castilian forces refused to offer battle, after two months no significant town was taken and the allies, struck by disease and lack of supplies, met with an overwhelming failure.

The treaty, still valid today, established a pact of mutual support between the countries: Indeed, Portugal would use it again against its neighbours in 1640, to expel the Spanish Habsburg kings from the country, and again during the Peninsular War. The Anglo-Portuguese Alliance would also be used by Britain (in succession from England) in the Second World War (allowing the Allies to establish bases on the Azores) and during the 1982 Falklands War.

<doc id="368411" wikidata="Q22771585" url="?curid=368411" title="Interregnum">
<text>An interregnum (plural interregna or interregnums) is a period of discontinuity or &quot;gap&quot; in a government, organization, or social order. Archetypally, it was the period of time between the reign of one monarch and the next (coming from Latin &quot;inter-&quot;, &quot;between&quot; and &quot;rēgnum&quot;, &quot;reign&quot; [from &quot;rex, rēgis&quot;, &quot;king&quot;]), and the concepts of interregnum and regency therefore overlap. Historically, longer and heavier interregna have been typically accompanied by widespread unrest, civil and succession wars between warlords, and power vacuums filled by foreign invasions or the emergence of a new power. A failed state is usually in interregnum.

The term also refers to the periods between the election of a new parliament and the establishment of a new government from that parliament in parliamentary democracies, usually ones that employ some form of proportional representation that allows small parties to elect significant numbers, requiring time for negotiations to form a government. In the UK, Canada and other electoral systems with single-member districts, this period is usually very brief, except in the rare occurrence of a hung parliament as occurred both in the UK in 2017 and in Australia in 2010. In parliamentary interregnums, the previous government usually stands as a caretaker government until the new government is established. Additionally, the term has been applied to the United States presidential transition, the period of time between the election of a new U.S. president and his or her inauguration, during which the outgoing president remains in power, but as a lame duck.

Similarly, in some Christian denominations, &quot;interregnum&quot; (interim) describes the time between vacancy and appointment of priest or pastors to various roles.

==Historical periods of interregnum==

Particular historical periods known as interregna include:
* The Chu–Han Contention of 206–202 BC in China, after the death of Emperor Qin Er Shi, when there was a contest to the throne. It ended with the accession of Liu Bang, ushering in the Han dynasty and ending the Qin dynasty.
* In the Kingdom of Mauretania, after the death of Bocchus II, the throne was unoccupied for 8 years (33-25 BC), before Juba II was granted control of the kingdom as a client state of Rome.
* The Crisis of the Third Century (235–284) in the Roman Empire, when it was split into multiple realms and chaos (invasion, civil war, Cyprian Plague, and economic depression) was a constant threat until Aurelian and Diocletian restored the empire. The crisis forced Diocletian to partition the Empire and marked the beginning of the fall of the Western Roman Empire.
* From 423 to 425 in the Roman Empire, between the death of Honorius and the accession of Valentinian III. A usurper called Joannes seized power.
* The ten-year period after the death of King Cleph from 574/575 to 584/585 in the Kingdom of the Lombards, known as the Rule of the Dukes. Marked by increasing domination of the Italian Peninsula by the Franks and the Byzantine Empire. Ended with the election of Authari as king.
* The Sasanian Interregnum (628–632), a conflict that broke out after the death of Khosrau II between the Sasanian nobles of different factions. Ended with the victory of Yazdegerd III and contributed to the fall of the Sasanian Empire.
* The 1022–1072 period in Ireland, between the death of Máel Sechnaill mac Domnaill and the accession of Toirdhealbhach Ua Briain, is sometimes regarded as an interregnum, as the High Kingship of Ireland was disputed throughout these decades. The interregnum may even have extended to 1121, when Toirdhealbhach Ua Conchobhair acceded to the title.
* From 1089 to 1102 in the Kingdom of Croatia, between death of Croatian king Demetrius Zvonimir and when Coloman, king of Hungary is crowned king of Croatia in 1102.
* From 13 April 1204 to 25 July 1261 in the Byzantine Empire. Following the Sack of Constantinople during the Fourth Crusade, the Byzantine Empire was dissolved, to be replaced by several Crusader states and several Byzantine states. It was re-established by Nicean general Alexios Strategopoulos who placed Michael VIII Palaiologos back on the throne of a united Byzantine Empire.
* From 21 May 1254 to 29 September 1273, The Great Interregnum in the Holy Roman Empire after the deposition of the last Hohenstaufen emperor Frederick II by Pope Innocent IV and the death of his son King Conrad IV of Germany until the election of the Habsburg scion Rudolph as &quot;Rex Romanorum&quot;.
* First Interregnum in Scotland, which lasted from either 19 March 1286 or 26 September 1290 until 17 November 1292. The exact dating of the interregnum depends on whether the uncrowned Margaret, Maid of Norway was officially queen before her death in 1290. It lasted until John Balliol was crowned King of Scots.
* Second Interregnum in Scotland, from 10 July 1296, when John Balliol was deposed, until 25 March 1306, when Robert the Bruce was crowned.
* From 14 January 1301 until 1308 in the Kingdom of Hungary between the extinction of the Árpád dynasty and when Charles I of Hungary secured the throne for himself against several pretenders.
* From 5 June 1316 to 15 November 1316 in France and Navarre, between the death of Louis X and the birth of his posthumous son John I.
* From 2 August 1332 until 21 June 1340 in Denmark when the country was mortgaged to a few German counts.
* The Portuguese Interregnum, from 22 October 1383 until 6 April 1385, a result of the succession crisis caused by the death of Ferdinand I without a legitimate heir. Ended when John I&#x27;s forces won the Battle of Aljubarrota, beginning the Aviz dynasty.
* The Ottoman Interregnum, from 20 July 1402 until 1413, a result of the capture of Sultan Bayezid I at the hands of Central Asian warlord Timur (Tamerlane) in the Battle of Ankara. A period of civil war ensued as none of Bayezid&#x27;s sons could establish primacy. The crisis was resolved when one of his sons, Mehmed, defeated and killed his brothers and reestablished the Empire.
* From 20 January 1410 to 1412 in the Crown of Aragon. The death of King Martin without heir led to a succession crisis and a period of civil war, resolved ultimately by the Compromise of Caspe.
* The 1453–1456 period of civil war in Kingdom of Majapahit (now in Java, Indonesia)
* From 1481 until 1483 in the Kingdom of Norway, during a conflict over the succession of John, during the period of the Kalmar Union. The Norwegian Council of the Realm initially refused to accept the hereditary succession of John; as they asserted that Norway was an elective monarchy. When no serious opposition candidate emerged, the Council relented and elected John. There was also an interregnum from 1533 to 1537, after the death of Frederick I and the interregnum ended with a coup d&#x27;état by his son Christian III.
* From 6 April 1490 to 15 July 1490 in the Kingdom of Hungary between the death of Matthias Corvinus and election of Vladislaus II.
* The Time of Troubles in Russia (1598–1613) between the Rurikid and Romanov dynasties, which caused a famine and an invasion by Poland-Lithuania as numerous usurpers and false Dmitrys claimed to be the legitimate successor to the dead Fyodor I. Ended when the Zemsky Sobor elected Michael Romanov as the new tsar, beginning the Romanov dynasty.
* The Interregnum of 1649–1660, a republican period in the three kingdoms of England, Ireland and Scotland. Government was carried out by the Commonwealth and the Protectorate of Oliver Cromwell after the execution of Charles I and before the restoration of Charles II.
* A second English interregnum occurred between 23 December 1688, when James II was deposed in the Glorious Revolution, and the installation of William III and Mary II as joint sovereigns on 13 February 1689 pursuant to the Declaration of Right.
* French and British interregnum in the Dutch East Indies between 1806 and 1815 was a period of French and then British rule on the Dutch East Indies after the collapse of the Dutch East Indies Company. The First French Empire ruled between 1806 and 1811. The British Empire took over for 1811 to 1815, and transferred control back to the Dutch in 1815.
* The brief Russian interregnum of 1825, caused by uncertainty over who succeeded the deceased Emperor Alexander I, only lasted between 1 December and 26 December 1825, but was used to stage the highly resonant Decembrist revolt. It ended when Grand Duke Konstantin Pavlovich renounced his claim to throne, allowing Nicholas I to declare himself Tsar.
*After World War I, the Habsburg ruler of the Kingdom of Hungary was disposed. On 1 March 1920, the Kingdom of Hungary was re-established. However, restoration of a Habsburg king was deemed unacceptable by to the Entente powers. Instead, the National Assembly of Hungary appointed Miklós Horthy as regent. Charles IV of Hungary made two unsuccessful attempts to retake the throne. Horthy remained as the Regent of Hungary until German invasion on 15 October 1944. 
* A brief interregnum occurred in Thailand between 13 October and 1 December 2016 upon the death of King Bhumibol Adulyadej. The crown prince Vajiralongkorn, in an unprecedented move, did not assume the throne immediately after the death of the previous monarch, as he asked for time to mourn while he continued functioning in his role as the crown prince. During this period, Prem Tinsulanonda served as the regent pro tempore.

In some monarchies, such as the United Kingdom, an &quot;interregnum&quot; is usually avoided due to a rule described as &quot;The King is dead. Long live the King&quot;, i.e. the heir to the throne becomes a new monarch immediately on his predecessor&#x27;s death or abdication. This famous phrase signifies the continuity of sovereignty, attached to a personal form of power named &quot;Auctoritas&quot;. This is not so in other monarchies where the new monarch&#x27;s reign begins only with coronation or some other formal or traditional event. In the Polish–Lithuanian Commonwealth for instance, kings were elected, which often led to relatively long interregna. During that time it was the Polish primate who served as an interrex (ruler between kings). In Belgium the heir only becomes king upon swearing an oath of office before the parliament.

==Christianity==

===Catholicism===
A &quot;Papal interregnum&quot; occurs upon the death or resignation of the Pope of the Catholic Church, though this particular form is called a &quot;sede vacante&quot; (literally &quot;when the seat is vacant&quot;). The interregnum ends immediately upon the election of a new Pope by the College of Cardinals.

===Anglicanism===
&quot;Interregnum&quot; is the term used in the Anglican Communion to describe the period before a new parish priest is appointed to fill a vacancy. During an interregnum, the administration of the parish is the responsibility of the churchwardens.

===Mormonism===
In the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints, when the President of The Church dies, the First Presidency is dissolved and the Quorum of the Twelve Apostles (the Twelve) becomes the Church&#x27;s presiding body. Any members of the First Presidency who were formerly members of the Twelve rejoin that quorum. The period between the death of the President and the reorganization of the First Presidency is known as an &quot;Apostolic Interregnum&quot;.

==Chess==
FIDE, the world governing body of international chess competition, has had two Interregnum periods of having no chess champions, both during the 1940s.

===Men===
* 1946–1948 — Men&#x27;s World Chess Champion Alexander Alekhine died of natural causes in 1946. Interregnum lasted until 1948, when Mikhail Botvinnik won a FIDE-held chess tournament to decide on a successor.

===Women===
* 1944–1950 — Women&#x27;s World Chess Champion Vera Menchik was killed in an air-raid during World War II in Britain in 1944. Interregnum lasted until 1950, when Lyudmila Rudenko won a FIDE-held chess tournament to decide on a successor.

==In fiction==
* The events of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s &quot;Foundation Trilogy&quot; take place during the galactic interregnum in his Foundation Universe, taking place in the 25th millennium. Foundation begins at the end of the Galactic Empire and notes in the novels from the Encyclopedia Galactica imply that a Second Galactic Empire follows the 1000 year interregnum.
* In J. R. R. Tolkien&#x27;s &quot;legendarium&quot; set in Middle-earth, the disappearance of the King Eärnur of Gondor is followed by a 968-year interregnum (the Steward years), which ends with the return of Aragorn in &quot;The Lord of the Rings&quot;. 
* &quot;The Old Kingdom Trilogy&quot; takes place after 200 years of interregnum, where the reigning Queen and her two daughters were murdered by Kerrigor, 180 years of regency first and 20 years of anarchy following the death of the last Regent.
* The &quot;Vlad Taltos&quot; series is set in a fantastical world of magic, at a time directly following a 250-year interregnum wherein traditional sorcery was impossible due to the orb being destroyed.
* In the &quot;Elder Scrolls&quot; video games, there was an Interregnum in the Second Era when the Second Cyrodillic Empire collapsed. It led to just over four centuries of bickering between small kingdoms and petty states. The Interregnum ended when Tiber Septim, or Talos, formed the Third Empire after a decade of war. Similarly, with the sacrifice of Martin Septim during the Oblivion Crisis in the Third Era, the Septim dynasty came to an end, and a seven-year interregnum occurred before Titus Mede I restored the throne and ushered in the Fourth Era.
* In &quot;Poland&quot; by James A. Michener, 1983, interregnum is mentioned numerous times in the ever-shifting power struggles that plagued that country, even up to the 1980s.
* In the film &quot;A Christmas Prince&quot;, the Kingdom of Aldovia limits interregna to a maximum of one year. This becomes a central plot point when it appears Crown Prince Richard may not accept the throne prior to the Christmas deadline.

==In media==
* The television game show &quot;Jeopardy!&quot; has been regarded as being in two interregnums, during Season 37 after the death of Alex Trebek following the taping of Episode 75 (aired January 8, 2021), and lasting until Episode 230 (aired August 13, 2021). The second interregnum, in Season 38, came following the resignation of Mike Richards following the taping of Episode 5 (aired September 17, 2021). Mayim Bialik and Ken Jennings hosted in both interregnums.

<text>Postcolonial literature is the literature by people from formerly colonized countries, originating from all continents except Antarctica. Postcolonial literature often addresses the problems and consequences of the decolonization of a country, especially questions relating to the political and cultural independence of formerly subjugated people, and themes such as racialism and colonialism. A range of literary theory has evolved around the subject. It addresses the role of literature in perpetuating and challenging what postcolonial critic Edward Said refers to as cultural imperialism. 

Migrant literature and postcolonial literature show some considerable overlap. However, not all migration takes place in a colonial setting, and not all postcolonial literature deals with migration. A question of current debate is the extent to which postcolonial theory also speaks to migration literature in non-colonial settings.

== Terminology ==
The significance of the prefix &quot;post-&quot; in &quot;postcolonial&quot; is a matter of contention among scholars and historians. In postcolonial studies, there has not been a unified consensus on when colonialism began and when it has ended (with numerous scholars contending that it has not). The contention has been influenced by the history of colonialism, which is commonly divided into several major phases; the European colonization of the Americas began in the 15th century and lasted until the 19th, while the colonisation of Africa and Asia reached their peak in the 19th century. By the dawn of the 20th century, the vast majority of non-European regions were under European colonial rule; this would last until after the Second World War when anti-colonial independence movements led to the decolonization of Africa, Asia and the Americas. Historians have also expressed differing opinions in regards to the postcolonial status of nations established through settler colonialism, such as the United States, Canada, Australia and New Zealand. Ongoing neocolonialism in the Global South and the effects of colonialism (many of which have persisted after the end of direct colonial rule) have made it difficult to determine whether or not a nation being no longer under colonial rule guarantees its postcolonial status.

Pramod Nayar defines postcolonial literature as &quot;that which negotiates with, contests, and subverts Euro-American ideologies and representations&quot;

=== Evolution of the term ===
Before the term &quot;postcolonial literature&quot; gained currency among scholars, &quot;commonwealth literature&quot; was used to refer to writing in English from colonies or nations which belonged to the British Commonwealth. Even though the term included literature from Britain, it was most commonly used for writing in English written in British colonies. Scholars of commonwealth literature used the term to designate writing in English that dealt with the topic of colonialism. They advocated for its inclusion in literary curricula, hitherto dominated by the British canon. However, the succeeding generation of postcolonial critics, many of whom belonged to the post-structuralist philosophical tradition, took issue with the &quot;commonwealth&quot; label for separating non-British writing from &quot;English&quot; language literature written in Britain. They also suggested that texts in this category frequently presented a short-sighted view on the legacy of colonialism.

Other terms used for English-language literature from former British colonies include terms that designate a national corpus of writing such as Australian or Canadian literature; numerous terms such as &quot;English Literature Other than British and American&quot;, &quot;New Literatures in English&quot;, &quot;International Literature in English&quot;; and &quot;World Literatures&quot; were coined. These, however, have been dismissed either as too vague or too inaccurate to represent the vast body of dynamic writing emerging from British colonies during and after the period of direct colonial rule. The term &quot;colonial&quot; and &quot;postcolonial&quot; continue to be used for writing emerging during and after the period of colonial rule respectively.

=== &quot;Post-colonial&quot; or &quot;postcolonial&quot;? ===
The consensus in the field is that &quot;post-colonial&quot; (with a hyphen) signifies a period that comes chronologically &quot;after&quot; colonialism. &quot;Postcolonial,&quot; on the other hand, signals the persisting impact of colonization across time periods and geographical regions. While the hyphen implies that history unfolds in neatly distinguishable stages from pre- to post-colonial, omitting the hyphen creates a comparative framework by which to understand the varieties of local resistance to colonial impact. Arguments in favor of the hyphen suggest that the term &quot;postcolonial&quot; dilutes differences between colonial histories in different parts of the world and that it homogenizes colonial societies. The body of critical writing that participates in these debates is called Postcolonial theory.

== Critical approaches ==
Postcolonial fiction writers deal with the traditional colonial discourse, either by modifying or by subverting it, or both. Postcolonial literary theory re-examines colonial and postcolonial literature, especially concentrating upon the social discourse between the colonizer and the colonized that shaped and produced the literature. In &quot;Orientalism&quot; (1978), Edward Said analyzed the fiction of Honoré de Balzac, Charles Baudelaire, and Lautréamont (Isidore-Lucien Ducasse), exploring how they shaped and were influenced by the societal fantasy of European racial superiority. He pioneered the branch of postcolonial criticism called colonial discourse analysis.

Another important theorist of colonial discourse is Harvard University professor Homi K. Bhabha, (born 1949). He has developed a number of the field&#x27;s neologisms and key concepts, such as hybridity, third-space, mimicry, difference, and ambivalence. Western canonical works like Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;The Tempest,&quot; Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre,&quot; Jane Austen&#x27;s &quot;Mansfield Park,&quot; Rudyard Kipling&#x27;s &quot;Kim,&quot; and Joseph Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; have been targets of colonial discourse analysis. The succeeding generation of postcolonial critics focus on texts that &quot;write back&quot; to the colonial center. In general, postcolonial theory analyzes how anti-colonial ideas, such as anti-conquest, national unity, &quot;négritude&quot;, pan-Africanism and postcolonial feminism were forged in and promulgated through literature. Prominent theorists include Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, Frantz Fanon, Bill Ashcroft, Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o, Chinua Achebe, Leela Gandhi, Gareth Griffiths, Abiola Irele, John McLeod, Hamid Dabashi, Helen Tiffin, Khal Torabully, and Robert J. C. Young.

=== Nationalism ===
The sense of identification with a nation, or nationalism, fueled anti-colonial movements that sought to gain independence from colonial rule. Language and literature were factors in consolidating this sense of national identity to resist the impact of colonialism. With the advent of the printing press, newspapers and magazines helped people across geographical barriers identify with a shared national community. This idea of the nation as a homogeneous imagined community connected across geographical barriers through the medium of language became the model for the modern nation. Postcolonial literature not only helped consolidate national identity in anti-colonial struggles but also critiqued the European colonial pedigree of nationalism. As depicted in Salman Rushdie&#x27;s novels for example, the homogeneous nation was built on European models by the exclusion of marginalized voices. They were made up of religious or ethnic elites who spoke on behalf of the entire nation, silencing minority groups.

=== Negritude, pan-Africanism and pan-nationalism ===
&quot;Négritude&quot; is a literary and ideological philosophy, developed by francophone African intellectuals, writers, and politicians in France during the 1930s. Its initiators included Martinican poet Aimé Césaire, Léopold Sédar Senghor (a future President of Senegal), and Léon Damas of French Guiana. Négritude intellectuals disapproved of French colonialism and claimed that the best strategy to oppose it was to encourage a common racial identity for native Africans worldwide.

Pan-Africanism was a movement among English-speaking black intellectuals who echoed the principles négritude. Frantz Fanon (1925–1961), a Martinique-born Afro-Caribbean psychiatrist, philosopher, revolutionary, and writer, was one of the proponents of the movement. His works are influential in the fields of postcolonial studies, critical theory, and Marxism. As an intellectual, Fanon was a political radical and Marxist humanist concerned with the psychopathology of colonization, and the human, social, and cultural consequences of decolonization.

====Back to Africa movement====
Marcus Mosiah Garvey, Jr. (1887–1940), another proponent of Pan-Africanism, was a Jamaican political leader, publisher, journalist, entrepreneur, and orator. He founded the Universal Negro Improvement Association and African Communities League (UNIA-ACL). He also founded the Black Star Line, a shipping and passenger line which promoted the return of the African diaspora to their ancestral lands. Prior to the 20th century, leaders such as Prince Hall, Martin Delany, Edward Wilmot Blyden, and Henry Highland Garnet advocated the involvement of the African diaspora in African affairs. However, Garvey was unique in advancing a Pan-African philosophy to inspire a global mass movement and economic empowerment focusing on Africa. The philosophy came to be known as Garveyism. Promoted by the UNIA as a movement of &quot;African Redemption&quot;, Garveyism would eventually inspire others, ranging from the Nation of Islam to the Rastafari movement (some sects of which proclaim Garvey as a prophet).

Against advocates of literature that promoted African racial solidarity in accordance with negritude principles, Frantz Fanon argued for a national literature aimed at achieving national liberation. Paul Gilroy argued against reading literature both as an expression of a common black racial identity and as a representation of nationalist sentiments. Rather, he argued that black cultural forms—including literature—were diasporic and transnational formations born out of the common historical and geographical effects of transatlantic slavery.

=== Anti-conquest ===
The &quot;anti-conquest narrative&quot; recasts the indigenous inhabitants of colonized countries as victims rather than foes of the colonisers. This depicts the colonised people in a more human light but risks absolving colonisers of responsibility by assuming that native inhabitants were &quot;doomed&quot; to their fate.

In her book &quot;Imperial Eyes,&quot; Mary Louise Pratt analyzes the strategies by which European travel writing portrays Europe as a secure home space against a contrasting representation of colonized outsiders. She proposes a completely different theorization of &quot;anti-conquest&quot; than the ideas discussed here, one that can be traced to Edward Said. Instead of referring to how natives resist colonization or are victims of it, Pratt analyzes texts in which a European narrates his adventures and struggles to survive in the land of the non-European Other. This secures the innocence of the imperialist even as he exercises his dominance, a strategy Pratt terms &quot;anti-conquest.&quot; The anti-conquest is a function of how the narrator writes him or her self out of being responsible for or an agent, direct or indirect, of colonization and colonialism. This different notion of anti-conquest is used to analyze the ways in which colonialism and colonization are legitimized through stories of survival and adventure that purport to inform or entertain. Pratt created this unique notion in association with concepts of contact zone and transculturation, which have been very well received in Latin America social and human science circles. The terms refer to the conditions and effects of encounter between the colonizer and the colonized.

===Postcolonial feminist literature===
Postcolonial feminism emerged as a response to the Eurocentric focus of feminism. It accounts for the way that racism and the long-lasting political, economic, and cultural effects of colonialism affect non-white, non-Western women in the postcolonial world. Postcolonial feminism is not simply a subset of postcolonial studies or another variety of feminism. Rather, it seeks to act as an intervention that changes the assumptions of both postcolonial and feminist studies.Audre Lorde&#x27;s foundational essay, &quot;The Master&#x27;s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master&#x27;s House&quot;, uses the metaphor of the master&#x27;s tools and master&#x27;s house to explain that western feminism fails to make positive change for third world women because it uses the same tools as the patriarchy. Postcolonial feminist fiction seeks to decolonize the imagination and society. With global debt, labor, and environmental crises one the rise, the precarious position of women (especially in the global south) has become a prevalent concern of postcolonial feminist novels. Common themes include women&#x27;s roles in globalized societies and the impact of mass migration to metropolitan urban centers. Pivotal texts, including Nawal El Saadawi&#x27;s The Fall of the Iman about the lynching of women, Chimamanda Adichie&#x27;s &quot;Half of a Yellow Sun&quot; about two sisters in pre and post war Nigeria, and Giannina Braschi&#x27;s United States of Banana which declares the independence of Puerto Rico. Other major voices include Maryse Condé, Fatou Diome, and Marie NDiaye.

Postcolonial feminist cultural theorists include Rey Chow, Maria Lugones, Gayatri Chakravorty Spivak, and Trinh T. Minh-ha.

==Pacific Islands==

The &quot;Pacific Islands&quot; comprise 20,000 to 30,000 islands in the Pacific Ocean. Depending on the context, it may refer to countries and islands with common Austronesian origins, islands once or currently colonized, or Oceania.
There is a burgeoning group of young pacific writers who respond and speak to the contemporary Pasifika experience, including writers Lani Wendt Young, Courtney Sina Meredith and Selina Tusitala Marsh. Reclamation of culture, loss of culture, diaspora, all themes common to postcolonial literature, are present within the collective Pacific writers. Pioneers of the literature include two of the most influential living authors from this region: Witi Ihimaera, New Zealand&#x27;s first published Māori novelist, and Samoan poet Albert Wendt (born 1939). Wendt lives in New Zealand. Among his works is &quot;Leaves of the Banyan Tree&quot; (1979). He is of German heritage through his paternal great-grandfather, which is reflected in some of his poems. He describes his family heritage as &quot;totally Samoan&quot;, even though he has a German surname. However, he does not explicitly deny his German heritage.

Another notable figure from the region is Sia Figiel (born 1967), a contemporary Samoan novelist, poet, and painter, whose debut novel &quot;Where We Once Belonged&quot; won the Commonwealth Writers&#x27; Prize &quot;Best First Book of 1997,&quot; &quot;South East Asia and South Pacific Region&quot;. Sia Figiel grew up amidst traditional Samoan singing and poetry, which heavily influenced her writing. Figiel&#x27;s greatest influence and inspiration in her career is the Samoan novelist and poet, Albert Wendt.

===Australia===
At the point of the first colonization of Australia from 1788, Indigenous Australians (Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people) had not developed a system of writing, so the first literary accounts of Aboriginal peoples come from the journals of early European explorers, which contain descriptions of first contact, both violent and friendly. Early accounts by Dutch explorers and the English buccaneer William Dampier wrote of the &quot;natives of New Holland&quot; as being &quot;barbarous savages&quot;, but by the time of Captain James Cook and First Fleet marine Watkin Tench (the era of Jean-Jacques Rousseau), accounts of Aboriginal peoples were more sympathetic and romantic: &quot;these people may truly be said to be in the pure state of nature, and may appear to some to be the most wretched upon the earth; but in reality they are far happier than ... we Europeans&quot;, wrote Cook in his journal on 23 August 1770.

While his father, James Unaipon (c. 1835–1907), contributed to accounts of Aboriginal mythology written by the South Australian missionary George Taplin, David Unaipon (1872–1967) provided the first accounts of Aboriginal mythology written by an Aboriginal person in his &quot;Legendary Tales of the Australian Aborigines&quot;. For this he is known as the first Aboriginal author.

Oodgeroo Noonuccal (born Kath Walker, 1920–1995) was an Australian poet, political activist, artist and educator. She was also a campaigner for Aboriginal rights. Oodgeroo was best known for her poetry, and was the first Aboriginal Australian to publish a book of verse, &quot;We Are Going&quot; (1964).

Sally Morgan&#x27;s novel &quot;My Place&quot; (1987) was considered a breakthrough memoir in terms of bringing Indigenous stories to wider notice. Leading Aboriginal activists Marcia Langton (&quot;First Australians&quot;, 2008) and Noel Pearson (&quot;Up From the Mission&quot;, 2009) are active contemporary contributors to Australian literature.

The voices of Indigenous Australians continue to be increasingly noticed, and include the playwright Jack Davis and Kevin Gilbert. Writers coming to prominence in the 21st century include Kim Scott, Alexis Wright, Kate Howarth, Tara June Winch, in poetry Yvette Holt and in popular fiction Anita Heiss.

Indigenous authors who have won Australia&#x27;s high prestige Miles Franklin Award include Kim Scott who was joint winner (with Thea Astley) in 2000 for &quot;Benang&quot; and again in 2011 for &quot;That Deadman Dance.&quot; Alexis Wright won the award in 2007 for her novel &quot;Carpentaria&quot;.

Bruce Pascoe&#x27;s &quot;Dark Emu: Black Seeds: Agriculture or Accident?&quot; (2014), which, based on research already done by others but rarely included in standard historical narratives, reexamines colonial accounts of Aboriginal people in Australia and cites evidence of pre-colonial agriculture, engineering and building construction by Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander peoples. The book won much acclaim, winning the Book of the Year in the NSW Premier&#x27;s Literary Award and others, as well as selling very well: by 2019 it was in its 28the printing and had sold over 100,000 copies.

Many notable works have been written by non-Indigenous Australians on Aboriginal themes. Eleanor Dark&#x27;s (1901–1985) &quot;The Timeless Land&quot; (1941) is the first of &quot;The Timeless Land&quot; trilogy of novels about European settlement and exploration of Australia. The narrative is told from European and Aboriginal points of view. Other examples include the poems of Judith Wright, &quot;The Chant of Jimmie Blacksmith&quot; by Thomas Keneally, &quot;Ilbarana&quot; by Donald Stuart, and the short story by David Malouf: &quot;The Only Speaker of his Tongue&quot;.

==Africa==


Amadou Hampâté Bâ (1901–1991), a Malian writer and ethnologist, and Ayi Kwei Armah (born 1939) from Ghana, author of &quot;Two Thousand Seasons&quot; have tried to establish an African perspective to their own history. Another significant African novel is &quot;Season of Migration to the North&quot; by Tayib Salih from the Sudan.

Doris Lessing (1919–2013) from Southern Rhodesia, now Zimbabwe, published her first novel &quot;The Grass is Singing&quot; in 1950, after immigrating to England. She initially wrote about her African experiences. Lessing soon became a dominant presence in the English literary scene, frequently publishing right through the century, and won the Nobel Prize in Literature in 2007. Yvonne Vera (1964–2005) was an author from Zimbabwe. Her novels are known for their poetic prose, difficult subject-matter, and their strong women characters, and are firmly rooted in Zimbabwe&#x27;s difficult past. Tsitsi Dangarembga (born 1959) is a notable Zimbabwean author and filmmaker.

Ngũgĩ wa Thiong&#x27;o (born 1938) is a Kenyan writer, formerly working in English and now working in Gikuyu. His work includes novels, plays, short stories, and essays, ranging from literary and social criticism to children&#x27;s literature. He is the founder and editor of the Gikuyu-language journal &quot;Mũtĩiri&quot;.
Stephen Atalebe (born 1983) is a Ghanaian Fiction writer who wrote the Hour of Death in Harare, detailing the post-colonial struggles in Zimbabwe as they navigate through sanctions imposed by the British Government under George Blair. 

Bate Besong (1954–2007) was a Cameroonian playwright, poet and critic, who was described by Pierre Fandio as &quot;one of the most representative and regular writers of what might be referred to as the second generation of the emergent Cameroonian literature in English&quot;. Other Cameroonian playwrights are Anne Tanyi-Tang, and Bole Butake.

Dina Salústio (born 1941) is a Cabo Verdean novelist and poet, whose works are considered an important contribution to Lusophone postcolonial literature, with a particular emphasis on their promotion of women&#x27;s narratives.

===Nigeria===
Nigerian author Chinua Achebe (1930–2013) gained worldwide attention for &quot;Things Fall Apart&quot; in the late 1950s. Achebe wrote his novels in English and defended the use of English, a &quot;language of colonisers&quot;, in African literature. In 1975, his lecture &quot;An Image of Africa: Racism in Conrad&#x27;s &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot;&quot; featured a famous criticism of Joseph Conrad as &quot;a thoroughgoing racist&quot;. A titled Igbo chieftain himself, Achebe&#x27;s novels focus on the traditions of Igbo society, the effect of Christian influences, and the clash of Western and traditional African values during and after the colonial era. His style relies heavily on the Igbo oral tradition, and combines straightforward narration with representations of folk stories, proverbs, and oratory. He also published a number of short stories, children&#x27;s books, and essay collections.

Wole Soyinka (born 1934) is a playwright and poet, who was awarded the 1986 Nobel Prize in Literature, the first African to be honored in that category. Soyinka was born into a Yoruba family in Abeokuta. After studying in Nigeria and Great Britain, he worked with the Royal Court Theatre in London. He went on to write plays that were produced in both countries, in theatres and on radio. He took an active role in Nigeria&#x27;s political history and its campaign for independence from British colonial rule. In 1965, he seized the Western Nigeria Broadcasting Service studio and broadcast a demand for the cancellation of the Western Nigeria Regional Elections. In 1967 during the Nigerian Civil War, he was arrested by the federal government of General Yakubu Gowon and put in solitary confinement for two years. Soyinka has been a strong critic of successive Nigerian governments, especially the country&#x27;s many military dictators, as well as other political tyrannies, including the Mugabe regime in Zimbabwe. Much of his writing has been concerned with &quot;the oppressive boot and the irrelevance of the colour of the foot that wears it&quot;.

Chimamanda Ngozi Adichie (born 1977) is a novelist, nonfiction writer and short story writer. A MacArthur Genius Grant recipient, Adichie has been called &quot;the most prominent&quot; of a &quot;procession of critically acclaimed young anglophone authors [that] is succeeding in attracting a new generation of readers to African literature&quot;.

Buchi Emecheta OBE (1944–2017) was a Nigerian novelist based in Britain who published more than 20 books, including &quot;Second-Class Citizen&quot; (1974), &quot;The Bride Price&quot; (1976), &quot;The Slave Girl&quot; (1977) and &quot;The Joys of Motherhood&quot; (1979). Her themes of child slavery, motherhood, female independence and freedom through education won her considerable critical acclaim and honours.

===South Africa===
Elleke Boehmer writes, &quot;Nationalism, like patriarchy, favours singleness—one identity, one growth pattern, one birth and blood for all ... [and] will promote specifically unitary or &#x27;one-eyed&#x27; forms of consciousness.&quot; The first problem any student of South African literature is confronted with, is the diversity of the literary systems. Gerrit Olivier notes, &quot;While it is not unusual to hear academics and politicians talk about a &#x27;South African literature&#x27;, the situation at ground level is characterised by diversity and even fragmentation&quot;. Robert Mossman adds that &quot;One of the enduring and saddest legacies of the apartheid system may be that no one – White, Black, Coloured (meaning of mixed-race in South Africa), or Asian – can ever speak as a &#x27;South African. The problem, however, pre-dates Apartheid significantly, as South Africa is a country made up of communities that have always been linguistically and culturally diverse. These cultures have all retained autonomy to some extent, making a compilation such as the controversial &quot;Southern African Literatures&quot; by Michael Chapman, difficult. Chapman raises the question:

[W]hose language, culture, or story can be said to have authority in South Africa when the end of apartheid has raised challenging questions as to what it is to be a South African, what it is to live in a new South Africa, whether South Africa is a nation, and, if so, what its mythos is, what requires to be forgotten and what remembered as we scour the past in order to understand the present and seek a path forward into an unknown future.
South Africa has 11 national languages: Afrikaans, English, Zulu, Xhosa, Sotho, Pedi, Tswana, Venda, SiSwati, Tsonga, and Ndebele. Any definitive literary history of South Africa should, it could be argued, discuss literature produced in all eleven languages. But the only literature ever to adopt characteristics that can be said to be &quot;national&quot; is Afrikaans. Olivier argues: &quot;Of all the literatures in South Africa, Afrikaans literature has been the only one to have become a national literature in the sense that it developed a clear image of itself as a separate entity, and that by way of institutional entrenchment through teaching, distribution, a review culture, journals, etc. it could ensure the continuation of that concept.&quot; Part of the problem is that English literature has been seen within the greater context of English writing in the world, and has, because of English&#x27;s global position as &quot;lingua franca&quot;, not been seen as autonomous or indigenous to South Africa – in Olivier&#x27;s words: &quot;English literature in South Africa continues to be a sort of extension of British or international English literature.&quot; The African languages, on the other hand, are spoken across the borders of Southern Africa - for example, Tswana is spoken in Botswana, and Tsonga in Zimbabwe, and Sotho in Lesotho. South Africa&#x27;s borders were established during the colonial era and, as with all other colonies, these borders were drawn without regard for the people living within them. Therefore: in a history of South African literature, do we include all Tswana writers, or only the ones with South African citizenship? Chapman bypasses this problem by including &quot;Southern&quot; African literatures. The second problem with the African languages is accessibility, because since the African languages are regional languages, none of them can claim the readership on a national scale comparable to Afrikaans and English. Sotho, for instance, while transgressing the national borders of the RSA, is on the other hand mainly spoken in the Free State, and bears a great amount of relation to the language of Natal for example, Zulu. So the language cannot claim a national readership, while on the other hand being &quot;international&quot; in the sense that it transgresses the national borders.

Olivier argues that &quot;There is no obvious reason why it should be unhealthy or abnormal for different literatures to co-exist in one country, each possessing its own infrastructure and allowing theoreticians to develop impressive theories about polysystems&quot;. Yet political idealism proposing a unified &quot;South Africa&quot; (a remnant of the plans drawn up by Sir Henry Bartle Frere) has seeped into literary discourse and demands a unified national literature, which does not exist and has to be fabricated. It is unrealistic to ever think of South Africa and South African literature as homogenous, now or in the near or distant future, since the only reason it is a country at all is the interference of European colonial powers. This is not a racial issue, but rather has to do with culture, heritage and tradition (and indeed the constitution celebrates diversity). Rather, it seems more sensible to discuss South African literature as literature produced within the national borders by the different cultures and language groups inhabiting these borders. Otherwise the danger is emphasising one literary system at the expense of another, and more often than not, the beneficiary is English, with the African languages being ignored. The distinction &quot;black&quot; and &quot;white&quot; literature is further a remnant of colonialism that should be replaced by drawing distinctions between literary systems based on language affiliation rather than race.

The first texts produced by black authors were often inspired by missionaries and frequently deal with African history, in particular the history of kings such as Chaka. Modern South African writing in the African languages tends to play at writing realistically, at providing a mirror to society, and depicts the conflicts between rural and urban settings, between traditional and modern norms, racial conflicts and most recently, the problem of AIDS.

In the first half of the 20th century, epics largely dominated black writing: historical novels, such as Sol T. Plaatje&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (1930), Thomas Mofolo&#x27;s &quot;Chaka&quot; (trans. 1925), and epic plays including those of H. I. E. Dhlomo, or heroic epic poetry such as the work of Mazizi Kunene. These texts &quot;evince black African patriarchy in its traditional form, with men in authority, often as warriors or kings, and women as background figures of dependency, and/or mothers of the nation&quot;. Female literature in the African languages is severely limited because of the strong influence of patriarchy, but over the last decade or two society has changed much and it can be expected that more female voices will emerge.

The following are notable white South African writers in English: Athol Fugard, Nadine Gordimer, J. M. Coetzee, and Wilbur Smith. André Brink has written in both Afrikaans and English while Breyten Breytenbach writes primarily in Afrikaans, though many of their works have been translated into English. Dalene Matthee&#x27;s (1938–2005) is another Afrikaner, best known for her four &quot;Forest Novels&quot;, written in and around the Knysna Forest, including &quot;Fiela se Kind&quot; (1985) (&quot;Fiela&#x27;s Child&quot;). Her books have been translated into fourteen languages, including English, French, and German. and over a million copies have been sold worldwide.

==The Americas==
===Caribbean Islands===
Maryse Condé (born 1937) is a French (Guadeloupean) author of historical fiction, best known for her novel &quot;Segu&quot; (1984–1985).

====West Indies====
The term &quot;West Indies&quot; first began to achieve wide currency in the 1950s, when writers such as Samuel Selvon, John Hearne, Edgar Mittelholzer, V.S. Naipaul, and George Lamming began to be published in the United Kingdom. A sense of a single literature developing across the islands was also encouraged in the 1940s by the BBC radio programme &quot;Caribbean Voices&quot;, which featured stories and poems written by West Indian authors, recorded in London under the direction of producer Henry Swanzy, and broadcast back to the islands. Magazines such as &quot;Kyk-Over-Al&quot; in Guyana, &quot;Bim&quot; in Barbados, and &quot;Focus&quot; in Jamaica, which published work by writers from across the region, also encouraged links and helped build an audience.

Some West Indian writers have found it necessary to leave their home territories and base themselves in the United Kingdom, the United States, or Canada in order to make a living from their work—in some cases spending the greater parts of their careers away from the territories of their birth. Critics in their adopted territories might argue that, for instance, V. S. Naipaul ought to be considered a British writer instead of a Trinidadian writer, or Jamaica Kincaid and Paule Marshall American writers, but most West Indian readers and critics still consider these writers &quot;West Indian&quot;.

West Indian literature ranges over subjects and themes as wide as those of any other &quot;national&quot; literature, but in general many West Indian writers share a special concern with questions of identity, ethnicity, and language that rise out of the Caribbean historical experience.

One unique and pervasive characteristic of Caribbean literature is the use of &quot;dialect&quot; forms of the national language, often termed creole. The various local variations in the European languages which became established in the West Indies during the period of European colonial rule. These languages have been modified over the years within each country and each has developed a blend that is unique to their country. Many Caribbean authors in their writing switch liberally between the local variation – now commonly termed nation language – and the standard form of the language. Two West Indian writers have won the Nobel Prize in Literature: Derek Walcott (1992), born in St. Lucia, resident mostly in Trinidad during the 1960s and &#x27;70s, and partly in the United States since then; and V. S. Naipaul, born in Trinidad and resident in the United Kingdom since the 1950. (Saint-John Perse, who won the Nobel Prize in 1960, was born in the French territory of Guadeloupe.)

Other notable names in (anglophone) Caribbean literature have included Earl Lovelace, Austin Clarke, Claude McKay, Orlando Patterson, Andrew Salkey, Edward Kamau Brathwaite (who was born in Barbados and has lived in Ghana and Jamaica), Linton Kwesi Johnson, and Michelle Cliff. In more recent times, a number of literary voices have emerged from the Caribbean as well as the Caribbean diaspora, including Kittitian Caryl Phillips (who has lived in the UK since one month of age), Edwidge Danticat, a Haitian immigrant to the United States; Anthony Kellman from Barbados, who divides his time between Barbados and the United States; Andrea Levy of the United Kingdom, Jamaicans Colin Channer and Marlon James, the author of the Man Booker Prize-winning novel &quot;A Brief History of Seven Killings&quot; (2014) (as well as &quot;John Crow&#x27;s Devil&quot;, &quot;The Book of Night Women&quot;, the unpublished screenplay &quot;Dead Men&quot;, and the short story &quot;Under Cover of Darkness&quot;), Antiguan Marie-Elena John, and Lasana M. Sekou from St. Maarten/St. Martin.

The most famous writer from the island of Dominica is British-Dominican author Jean Rhys, best known for her 1966 novel &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot;, which was written as a prequel to Charlotte Brontë&#x27;s &quot;Jane Eyre&quot;. The novel deals with themes of women living in a patriarchal society, race, and assimilation. On 5 November 2019, &quot;BBC News&quot; listed &quot;Wide Sargasso Sea&quot; on its list of the 100 most influential novels. The novel has been adapted for stage, film and radio numerous times, most recently as a radio play by BBC Radio 4.

Earl Lovelace (born 1935) is a Trinidadian novelist, journalist, playwright, and short story writer. He is particularly recognized for his descriptive, dramatic fiction on Trinidadian culture: &quot;Using Trinidadian dialect patterns and standard English, he probes the paradoxes often inherent in social change as well as the clash between rural and urban cultures.&quot; As Bernardine Evaristo notes, &quot;Lovelace is unusual among celebrated Caribbean writers in that he has always lived in Trinidad. Most writers leave to find support for their literary endeavours elsewhere and this, arguably, shapes the literature, especially after long periods of exile. But Lovelace&#x27;s fiction is deeply embedded in Trinidadian society and is written from the perspective of one whose ties to his homeland have never been broken.&quot;

===United States===

American David Henry Hwang&#x27;s play &quot;M. Butterfly&quot; addresses the Western perspective on China and the French as well as the American perspectives on Vietnam during the Vietnam War. It was inspired by Giacomo Puccini&#x27;s opera &quot;Madama Butterfly&quot;.

Maxine Hong Kingston (born 1940) is a Chinese American author who has written three novels and several works of non-fiction about the experiences of Chinese immigrants living in the United States.

Bharati Mukherjee although of East Indian ancestry has gone on record that she considers herself an American writer, and not an Indian expatriate writer. In a 1989 interview with Amanda Meer, Mukherjee said: &quot;I totally consider myself an American writer, and that has been my big battle: to get to realize that my roots as a writer are no longer, if they ever were, among Indian writers, but that I am writing about the territory about the feelings, of a new kind of pioneer here in America. I&#x27;m the first among Asian immigrants to be making this distinction between immigrant writing and expatriate writing. Most Indian writers prior to this, have still thought of themselves as Indians, and their literary inspiration, has come from India. India has been the source, and home. Whereas I&#x27;m saying, those are wonderful roots, but now my roots are here and my emotions are here in North America.&quot;

Jhumpa Lahiri (born 1967) is an Indian-American author. Lahiri&#x27;s debut short story collection &quot;Interpreter of Maladies&quot; (1999) won the 2000 Pulitzer Prize for Fiction, and her first novel, &quot;The Namesake&quot; (2003), was adapted into the popular film of the same name.

====African-American literature====

Throughout American history, African Americans have been discriminated against and subject to racist attitudes. This experience inspired some Black writers, at least during the early years of African-American literature, to prove they were the equals of European-American authors. As Henry Louis Gates, Jr, has said, &quot;it is fair to describe the subtext of the history of black letters as this urge to refute the claim that because blacks had no written traditions they were bearers of an inferior culture.&quot;

By refuting the claims of the dominant culture, African-American writers were also attempting to subvert the literary and power traditions of the United States. Some scholars assert that writing has traditionally been seen as &quot;something defined by the dominant culture as a white male activity.&quot; This means that, in American society, literary acceptance has traditionally been intimately tied in with the very power dynamics which perpetrated such evils as racial discrimination. By borrowing from and incorporating the non-written oral traditions and folk life of the African diaspora, African-American literature broke &quot;the mystique of connection between literary authority and patriarchal power.&quot; In producing their own literature, African Americans were able to establish their own literary traditions devoid of the white intellectual filter. In 1922, W. E. B. Du Bois wrote that &quot;the great mission of the Negro to America and to the modern world&quot; was to develop &quot;Art and the appreciation of the Beautiful&quot;.

====Puerto Rico====
Giannina Braschi (born 1953) is a Puerto Rican writer, who is credited with writing the first Spanglish novel &quot;Yo-Yo Boing!&quot; (1998), the post-modern poetry trilogy &quot;Empire of Dreams&quot; (1994), and the philosophical fiction &quot;United States of Banana&quot; (2011), which chronicles the Latin American immigrants&#x27; experiences in the United States and the Puerto Rican battle with Spanish and American colonialism.

===Canada===
Canadian writer Margaret Laurence&#x27;s work was informed by colonial relations and African culture when she lived in British Somaliland then the Gold Coast British colony in the 1950s near the end of their times as colonies. Margaret Atwood is a post-colonial writer who dealt with themes of identity-seeking through her Southern Ontario Gothic style of writing.

Canadian Michael Ondaatje, is an internationally acclaimed author with Sri Lankan roots, which he has explored in works like &quot;Running in the Family&quot; (1983) and &quot;The Cat&#x27;s Table&quot; (2011).

Cyril Dabydeen (born 1945) is a Guyana-born, Canadian writer of Indian descent. He grew up in a sugar plantation with the sense of Indian indenture rooted in his family background.

African-Canadian George Elliott Clarke has promoted Black authors with &quot;Directions Home: Approaches to African-Canadian Literature&quot; (2012) as well as his own poetry, novels and plays.

In the decade 2008-2018 Canadian Indigenous writers published so many works that some critics called it a renaissance. This phenomenon was studied in &quot;Introduction to Indigenous Literary Criticism in Canada&quot; (2015). Eds Heather MacFarlane &amp; Armand Garnet Ruffo.

Canadian scholar, Joseph Pivato has promoted the study of ethnic minority authors with &quot;Comparative Literature for the New Century&quot; (2018). Eds. Giulia De Gasperi &amp; Joseph Pivato.

== East Asia ==
===Korea===
Chunghee Sara Soh&#x27;s book &quot;The Comfort Women: Sexual Violence and Postcolonial Memory in Korea and Japan&quot; has shed new light on the practice of having forced sexual slavery, called &quot;comfort women&quot; during the Imperial Japanese army before and during World War II.
==West Asia: The Middle East==
Major figures in the postcolonial literature of the Middle East included Egyptian novelist Naguib Mahfouz and Palestinian-American scholar Edward Said. Said published his most famous work, &quot;Orientalism&quot;, discussing the depiction of Asia by the Western world. Mahfouz was inspired to write in a large part by his experiences during the Egyptian Revolution of 1919 (when he was seven years old), including witnessing British soldiers firing on crowds of demonstrators in an effort to disperse them; according to Mahfouz, &quot;You could say ... that the one thing which most shook the security of my childhood was the 1919 revolution&quot;, as he recounted in an interview.

==South and Southeast Asia==
===Philippines===
Philippine literature includes the legends of prehistory, and the colonial legacy of the Philippines. Pre-Hispanic Philippine literature were actually epics passed on from generation to generation originally through oral tradition. However, wealthy families, especially in Mindanao were able to keep transcribed copies of these epics as family heirloom. One such epic was the &quot;Darangen&quot;, epic of the Maranaos of Lake Lanao. Most of the epics were known during the Spanish era.

Most of the notable literature of the Philippines was written during the Spanish period and the first half of the 20th century in the Spanish language. Philippine literature is written in Spanish, English, or any indigenous Philippine languages. Notable authors include F. Sionil José, Jose Dalisay, Jr., N. V. M. Gonzalez and Nick Joaquin.

===Indonesia===
====Dutch East Indies====
Dutch Indies literature includes Dutch language postcolonial literature reflecting on the era of the Dutch East Indies (now Indonesia). Much of the postcolonial literature of this genre is written by Dutch Eurasians known as Indos. Important authors that have been translated to English include, Tjalie Robinson, Maria Dermout, and Marion Bloem.

===Singapore===
Bonny Hicks (1968–1997) was a Singapore Eurasian model and writer. After garnering fame as a model, she gained recognition for her contributions to Singaporean post-colonial literature and for the philosophy conveyed in her works. Her first book, &quot;Excuse Me, Are You A Model?&quot;, is recognised as a significant milestone in the literary and cultural history of Singapore.

===India===
One of the key issues is the superiority/inferiority of Indian Writing in English (IWE) as opposed to the literary production in the various languages of India. Key polar concepts bandied in this context are superficial/authentic, imitative/creative, shallow/deep, critical/uncritical, elitist/parochial and so on.

The views of Salman Rushdie and Amit Chaudhuri expressed through their books &quot;The Vintage Book of Indian Writing&quot; and &quot;The Picador Book of Modern Indian Literature&quot; respectively essentialise this battle. Rushdie&#x27;s statement in his book – &quot;the ironic proposition that India&#x27;s best writing since independence may have been done in the language of the departed imperialists is simply too much for some folks to bear&quot; – created a lot of resentment among many writers, including writers in English. In his book, Amit Chaudhuri questions – &quot;Can it be true that Indian writing, that endlessly rich, complex and problematic entity, is to be represented by a handful of writers who write in English, who live in England or America and whom one might have met at a party?&quot;

Chaudhuri feels that after Rushdie, Indian writing in English started employing magical realism, bagginess, non-linear narrative and hybrid language to sustain themes seen as microcosms of India and supposedly reflecting Indian conditions. He contrasts this with the works of earlier writers such as R. K. Narayan where the use of English is pure, but the deciphering of meaning needs cultural familiarity. He also feels that Indian is a theme constructed only in IWE and does not articulate itself in the vernacular literature. He further adds &quot;the post-colonial novel, becomes a trope for an ideal hybrid by which the West celebrates not so much Indian, whatever that infinitely complex thing is, but its own historical quest, its reinterpretation of itself&quot;.

Some of these arguments form an integral part of what is called postcolonial theory. The very categorisation of IWE – as IWE or under post-colonial literature – is seen by some as limiting. Amitav Ghosh made his views on this very clear by refusing to accept the Eurasian Commonwealth Writers Prize for his book &quot;The Glass Palace&quot; in 2001 and withdrawing it from the subsequent stage.

Indian authors like Amitav Ghosh, Anita Desai, Hanif Kureishi, Rohinton Mistry, Meena Alexander, Arundhati Roy and Kiran Desai have written about their postcolonial experiences.

The Hungry Generation was a literary movement in the Bengali language launched by what is known today as the &quot;Hungryalist quartet&quot;, &quot;i.e.&quot; Shakti Chattopadhyay, Malay Roy Choudhury, Samir Roychoudhury and Debi Roy (alias Haradhon Dhara), during the 1960s in Kolkata, India. Due to their involvement in this avant garde cultural movement, the leaders lost their jobs and were jailed by the incumbent government. They challenged contemporary ideas about literature and contributed significantly to the evolution of the language and idiom used by contemporaneous artists to express their feelings in literature and painting.

Khushwant Singh (1915-2014) has written numerous fiction and non-fiction novels about the India-Pakistan Partition.

Nissim Ezekiel (1924–2004) was a foundational figure in postcolonial India&#x27;s literary history, specifically for Indian writing in English.

Mahashweta Devi (1926–2016) is an Indian social activist and writer.

Urvashi Butalia&#x27;s &quot;The Other Side of Silence&quot; is a collection of oral histories and testimonies about the India-Pakistan Partition.

===Sri Lanka===
Sri Lankan writers like Nihal De Silva and Carl Muller write about the post-colonial situation and the ethnic conflict in Sri Lanka. Notably authors such as the D.C.R.A Goonetilleke in Sri Lankan English Literature and the Sri Lankan People 1917-2003 targets the evolution of Sri Lankan English Literature specifically in regards to the acceptance of the English language and other major controversies of the time in Sri Lankan literature, after its Independence from the British Empire in 1948.

==Europe==
===Britain===
The novels of J. G. Farrell are important texts dealing with the decline of the British Empire. Farrell&#x27;s novel &quot;Troubles&quot;, set during the Irish War of Independence (1919–1921), is the first instalment in Farrell&#x27;s &quot;Empire Trilogy&quot;, preceding &quot;The Siege of Krishnapur&quot; and &quot;The Singapore Grip&quot;, all written during the 1970s. Although there are similar themes within the three novels (most notably that of the British Empire), they do not form a sequence of storytelling. &quot;The Siege of Krishnapur&quot; was inspired by events such as the sieges of Cawnpore and Lucknow, and details the siege of a fictional Indian town, Krishnapur, during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 from the perspective of the city&#x27;s British residents. &quot;The Singapore Grip&quot; is satirical book about events following Japan&#x27;s entry into the Second World War and occupation of Singapore. The story centres on a British family who own one of the colony&#x27;s leading trading companies.

Novelist E. M. Forster&#x27;s &quot;A Passage to India&quot; (1924) takes as its subject the relationship between East and West, seen through the lens of India in the later days of the British Raj. Forster connects personal relationships with the politics of colonialism through the story of the Englishwoman Adela Quested, the Indian Dr. Aziz, and the question of what did or did not happen between them in the Marabar Caves.

&quot;The Raj Quartet&quot; a four-volume novel sequence, written by Paul Scott, also deals with the subject of British colonial rule in India, in this case the concluding years of the British Raj. The series was written during the period 1965–1975. &quot;The Times&quot; called it &quot;one of the most important landmarks of post-war fiction.&quot; The story of &quot;The Raj Quartet&quot; begins in 1942. World War II is at its zenith, and in South East Asia, the Allied forces have suffered great losses. Burma has been captured by Japan, and the Japanese invasion of the Indian subcontinent from the east appears imminent. The year 1942 is also marked by Indian nationalist leader Mahatma Gandhi&#x27;s call for the Quit India movement to the British colonial government. &quot;The Raj Quartet&quot; is set in this tumultuous background for the British soldiers and civilians stationed in India who have a duty to manage this part of the British Empire. One recurrent theme is the moral certainty of the older generation as contrasted with the anomie of the younger. Another theme is the treatment of Indians by Britons living in India. As a reflection of these themes. the British characters let themselves be &quot;trapped by codes and principles, which were in part to keep their own fears and doubts at bay.&quot;

&quot;An Outpost of Progress&quot; and &quot;Heart of Darkness&quot; by Polish-British writer Joseph Conrad are based on his experiences in the Congo Free State. There is also &quot;The Congo Diary and Other Uncollected Pieces&quot;.

===Wales===
Wales was gradually annexed by the Kingdom of England during the Middle Ages, and was fully incorporated within the English legal system under the Laws in Wales Acts 1535–1542. Distinctive Welsh politics developed in the 19th century, and Welsh nationalism grew during the 20th century. The Welsh nationalist party, Plaid Cymru, was formed in 1925 and the Welsh Language Society in 1962.

Welsh poet, novelist and dramatist Saunders Lewis, who was a prominent support of nationalism in Wales, rejected the possibility of Anglo-Welsh literature due to the language&#x27;s status as the official tongue of the British state, affirming that &quot;the literature which people called Anglo-Welsh was indistinguishable from English literature&quot;. Saunders Lewis was himself born in Wallasey in England to a Welsh-speaking family.

The attitude of the post-war generation of Welsh writers in English towards Wales differs from the previous generation, in that they were more sympathetic to Welsh nationalism and to the Welsh language. The change can be linked to the nationalist fervour generated by Saunders Lewis and the burning of the Bombing School on the Lleyn Peninsula in 1936, along with a sense of crisis generated by the Second World War. In poetry R. S. Thomas (1913–2000) was the most important figure throughout the second half of the 20th century, beginning with &quot;The Stones of the Field&quot; in 1946 and concluding with &quot;No Truce with the Furies&quot; (1995). While he &quot;did not learn the Welsh language until he was 30 and wrote all his poems in English&quot;, he wanted the Welsh language to be made the official language of Wales, and the policy of Anglo-Welsh bilingualism abolished. He wrote his autobiography in Welsh, but said he lacked the necessary grasp of the language to employ it in his poems. Although an Anglican priest, he was a fervent nationalist and advocated boycotts against English owners of holiday homes in Wales. As an admirer of Saunders Lewis, Thomas defended his need to use English: &quot;Since there is in Wales a mother tongue that continues to flourish, a proper Welshman can only look on English as a means of rekindling interest in the Welsh language, and of leading people back to the mother tongue.&quot;

With the creation the National Assembly for Wales, under the Government of Wales Act 1998, Wales now has more local autonomy from the central government in London. The Welsh Language Act 1993 and the Government of Wales Act 1998 provide that the English and Welsh languages be treated on a basis of equality. English is spoken by almost all people in Wales and is the &quot;de facto&quot; main language. Northern and western Wales retain many areas where Welsh is spoken as a first language by the majority of the population, and English learnt as a second language. The 2011 Census showed 562,016 people, 19.0% of the Welsh population, were able to speak Welsh.

===Ireland===
The English language was introduced to Ireland in the 13th century, following the Norman Conquest of Ireland. However, English rule did not extend over the whole island until the 16th–17th century Tudor conquest, which led to plantation of Ireland. In the 1690s, the Protestant Anglo-Irish started to become dominant over the Catholic majority, which was extended during the 18th century. The Irish language, however, remained the dominant language of Irish literature down to the 19th century, despite a slow decline which began in the 17th century with the expansion of English control in Ireland.

The 17th century saw the tightening of English control over Ireland and the suppression of the Irish aristocracy. This meant that the literary class lost its patrons, since the new nobility were English speakers with little interest for the older culture. The elaborate classical metres lost their dominance and were largely replaced by more popular forms. This was an age of social and political tension, as expressed by the poet Dáibhí Ó Bruadair and the anonymous authors of &quot;Pairliment Chloinne Tomáis&quot;, a prose satire on the aspirations of the lower classes. Prose of another sort was represented by the historical works of Geoffrey Keating (Seathrún Céitinn) and the compilation known as the &quot;Annals of the Four Masters&quot;.

The consequences of these changes were seen in the 18th century. Poetry was still the dominant literary medium and its practitioners were poor scholars, often educated in the classics at local schools and schoolmasters by trade. Such writers produced polished work in popular metres for a local audience. This was particularly the case in Munster, in the south-west of Ireland, and notable names included Eoghan Rua Ó Súilleabháin and Aogán Ó Rathaille of Sliabh Luachra. A certain number of local patrons were still to be found, even in the early 19th century, and especially among the few surviving families of the Gaelic aristocracy. In the first half of the 18th century Dublin was the home of an Irish-language literary circle connected to the Ó Neachtain (Naughton) family, a group with wide-ranging Continental connections.

With the Acts of Union in 1801, Ireland became a part of the United Kingdom. The latter part of the 19th century saw a rapid replacement of Irish by English in the greater part of the country, though Irish was still an urban language, and continued to be so well into the 19th century. At the end of the 19th century, however, cultural nationalism displayed a new energy, marked by the Gaelic Revival (which encouraged a modern literature in Irish) and more generally by the Irish Literary Revival.

A war of independence in the early 20th century was followed by the partition of the island, creating the Irish Free State in 1922, which became increasingly sovereign over the following decades, and Northern Ireland, which remained a part of the United Kingdom.

===Poland===
Clare Cavanagh believes that literature of Poland is postcolonial. Dariusz Skórczewski supports her and reveals how the experiences of foreign domination and the history of empire have shaped contemporary Polish culture and society. They both criticize Marxist basis of postcolonialism.

<doc id="368414" wikidata="Q5574677" url="?curid=368414" title="Go (Vertical Horizon album)">
<text>Go is the fourth studio album by alternative rock band Vertical Horizon. The album, a follow-up to the band&#x27;s double platinum &quot;Everything You Want&quot;, continues to expand upon the band&#x27;s alternative and pop rock sound while moving into more hard rock directions as well. Recorded in early 2002, the album was ready as early as that August, but was instead delayed extensively due to restructuring at the band&#x27;s label, RCA Records. The album was released over a year later on September 23, 2003. The singles off the album were &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot;, &quot;Forever&quot;, and &quot;When You Cry&quot;.

The album was well received by critics, who praised the album for being enjoyable despite not being especially inventive, but did not perform well commercially, with it not charting within the top 60 in its first week, and failing to achieve any RIAA certification. The album was later re-released as &quot;Go 2.0&quot; in 2005 on Hybrid Recordings, with a new track &quot;Better When You&#x27;re Not There&quot; and rearranged track listing.

==Background==
After the band&#x27;s release of their double platinum album &quot;Everything You Want&quot; in 1999, the band had initially intended to record a follow-up right away. However, the band ended up touring in support of &quot;Everything You Want&quot; for about two and a half years at request of their label. The band took a break from touring in early 2002 to move to Los Angeles and start recording sessions for &quot;Go&quot;.

==Writing and recording==
The &quot;Go&quot; sessions began after commencing the two and a half years of touring in support of &quot;Everything You Want&quot; in early 2002. Despite the band&#x27;s origins as a duo where Matthew Scannell and Keith Kane split singing and songwriting duties, the band dynamic shifted to Scannell proving majority of both for &quot;Everything You Want&quot;, and all of both for &quot;Go&quot;. The process started with Scannell writing material in solitude, and then presenting his ideas to the rest of the band. How developed song ideas were varied by the track; some, such as &quot;Underwater&quot;, was only a loose outline of a song, where as the track &quot;Forever&quot;, was almost fully realized. Once ample ideas were in place, the band would enter the rehearsal space, where the band worked on arranging the album, and either expanding or trimming segments of tracks.

Upon a couple of weeks of rehearsing, the band began recording alongside music producer John Shanks. The band first began by recording bass, drums, and guitars first, and then adding Scannel&#x27;s vocals. However, the exception to the process was the track &quot;Forever&quot;, which was added at the last minute in the initial recording sessions; where they started with Scannel&#x27;s vocals and guitar, and then filled in the drums and bass afterwards. The band recorded a total of 16 songs for the album, but always envisioned paring it down to 11 or 12 for the final release.

An album&#x27;s worth of material had been finished by August 2002. However, complications and delays arose due to issues with their record label, RCA Records, which was going through a major restructuring at the time. The band ended up under the jurisdiction the company&#x27;s new CEO, Clive Davis. Davis did not approve of the band, with Scannell later recounting that &quot;...it’s safe to say we were not Clive’s favorite band...It was a torturous time.&quot; The combination of RCA&#x27;s troubles and Davis&#x27;s low opinion would delay the album over a year, until September 2003. In that time, Davis also requested the band come up with a stronger first single, so the band continued to work on further material, which resulted in the album&#x27;s first single &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot;. The album&#x27;s production was wrapped up with mixing by Ben Grosse and Chris Lord-Alge along with mastering by Ted Jensen.

==Lyrical themes==
The album&#x27;s title reflects the band&#x27;s &quot;just go for it&quot; mentality during the recording sessions. Part of the inspiration for this approach were the difficult &quot;Everything You Want&quot; sessions, where band members stressed out over every little detail of the album.&quot; The band resolved to go with their instinct rather that worrying excessively, something they felt they had honed through two and a half years of touring since the last time they had recorded in the studio.&quot; Scannell stated that, while none of the tracks overtly reference the September 11 attacks, the event did influence this mentality as well, having an important effect on his inspiration and emotions during the creation of the album.&quot;
&quot;A lot of the themes in these songs are about taking control of your life and living it the way you want to live it, and acting and doing and not just talking and thinking about it. It&#x27;s really important in the big sense in a post 9/11 world to make sure we all live our life in a way where we feel good about it. There are certainly messages within some of the songs at certain points on the album that deal with feelings of loss and those types of emotions, and also some feelings of, &#x27;Hey, I want to get up and dust myself off and get on with my life. Both of those could be seen as viable and relevant reactions to 9/11.&quot;

==Musical style and composition==
The album&#x27;s sound is considered to be a continuation of &quot;Everything You Want&quot;&#x27;s sound. &quot;Go&quot; has specifically been described as alternative rock and pop rock. Emphasis is placed on high production values with a highly polished and processed sound. A few tracks, notably &quot;Sunshine&quot; and &quot;One of You&quot;, veer into a heavier, hard rock sound.

Most of the tracks are arranged in a conventional verse-chorus structure, although the track&#x27;s final chorus typically contain an expanded variation both lyrically and instrumentally. Verses commonly contain acoustic guitar, clean electric guitar tones, and a bass and drum lead beat, while choruses commonly erupt into heavier distorted guitar and heavy bass notes played, commonly creating a loud-soft dynamic. Tracks commonly contain an outro instrumental interlude as well. A few tracks, most notably &quot;Inside&quot;, prominently feature orchestration in the form of a string section as well.

==Release and promotion==
&quot;Go&quot; was released on September 23, 2003. The band was featured on television on multiple instances during the album&#x27;s initial week of release, including appearances on &quot;CBS Weekend&quot;, CNN, Fox News and WGN. The band also performed at the Experience Music Project, which was later aired in October on VH1. The band also promoted the release through a North American tour through mid-November, a South-Eastern tour after that, and then many radio-sponsored performances in December.

Despite the band&#x27;s efforts, the album had a weak commercial impact, debuting at number 61 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The first single, &quot;I&#x27;m Still Here&quot;, only peaked at number 17 on the Adult Top 40 as well. The band cited lack of support from their record label, with Scannell stating:

&quot;Clive Davis had just taken over RCA Records and we knew he was not a fan of our band and certainly didn’t like me or our music much...We knew this album was going to virtually end up stillborn. I remember walking around to seven different record stores that day and finding only one copy of the new album.&quot;

On June 28, 2005, Hybrid Recordings, the label owned by Sony BMG, which bought out RCA in 2004 re-released &quot;Go&quot; as &quot;Go 2.0&quot;. The album featured a slightly altered track listing that included a previously unreleased track, &quot;Better When You&#x27;re Not There&quot;, and new cover art. After the re-release, &quot;Forever&quot; was released as a single; it reached no. 18 in the Billboard Adult Top 40 charts. The third and final single, &quot;When You Cry&quot;, charted at No. 35. &quot;Forever&quot; also made the top 20 of the Billboard Hot AC chart, peaking at #17.

The album was also released in South Africa through Musketeer Records, where it charted in the top 10 album downloads from iTunes.

==Reception==
Reception for the album garnered mixed reactions by critics. AllMusic panned the album for sounding generic, stating it sounded like &quot;insipid radio filler&quot; and &quot;soundtracks for Pottery Barn&quot; and that it &quot;reaffirms their status as third-tier imitators&quot;. Conversely, Alternative Addiction strongly praised the album for being &quot;great from beginning to end, proving that Vertical Horizon is one of the few bands that still not only makes great songs, but great albums...This album might not be &quot;Everything You Want&quot; but its still pretty damn good.&quot; The album&#x27;s &quot;layered guitar-work&quot; was cited as a standout element. &quot;The Daily Star&quot; similarly praised the album for being &quot;a brilliant album with varied songs put together, with each of them fitting different occasions and moods.&quot; The &quot;Collegiate Times&quot; also praised the album for being &quot;rock that&#x27;s not going to scare away the children, but at the same time has enough backbone to satisfy a U2 or Collective Soul fan&quot; and cited the track &quot;One of You&quot; as a standout track for fans of hard rock.

<text>Jeffrey David Sachs ( ; born November 5, 1954) is an American economist and public policy analyst who is a professor at Columbia University, where he was formerly director of The Earth Institute. He worked on the topics of sustainable development and economic development.

Sachs is director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University and president of the UN Sustainable Development Solutions Network. He is an SDG Advocate for United Nations (UN) Secretary-General António Guterres on the Sustainable Development Goals (SDGs), a set of 17 global goals adopted at a UN summit meeting in September 2015.

From 2001 to 2018, Sachs was special advisor to the UN Secretary General, and held the same position under the previous UN Secretary-General Ban Ki-moon and prior to 2016 a similar advisory position related to the earlier Millennium Development Goals (MDGs), eight internationally sanctioned objectives to reduce extreme poverty, hunger and disease by 2015. In connection with the MDGs, he had first been appointed special adviser to the UN Secretary-General in 2002 during the term of Kofi Annan.

Sachs is co-founder and chief strategist of Millennium Promise Alliance, a nonprofit organization dedicated to ending extreme poverty and hunger. From 2002 to 2006, he was director of the United Nations Millennium Project&#x27;s work on the MDGs. In 2010, he became a commissioner for the Broadband Commission for Sustainable Development, whose stated aim is to boost the importance of broadband internet in international policy. Sachs has written several books and received several awards. His views on economics, on the origin of COVID-19, and on the Russian invasion of Ukraine have garnered attention and some criticism.

== Early life and education ==
Sachs was raised in Oak Park, Michigan, in the Detroit metro area, and is the son of Joan (née Abrams) and Theodore Sachs, a labor lawyer. His family is Jewish. He graduated from Oak Park High School and attended Harvard College, where he received his Bachelor of Arts, &quot;summa cum laude&quot;, in 1976. He went on to receive his M.A. and Ph.D. in economics from Harvard with his thesis titled &quot;Factor Costs and Macroeconomic Adjustment in the Open Economy: Theory and Evidence,&quot; and was invited to join the Harvard Society of Fellows while still a Harvard graduate student.

== Academic career ==
=== Harvard University ===
In 1980, Sachs joined the Harvard faculty as an assistant professor, and was promoted to associate professor in 1982. A year later at the age of 28, he became a professor of economics with tenure at Harvard.

During the next 19 years at Harvard, Sachs became the Galen L. Stone Professor of International Trade, director of the Harvard Institute for International Development (1995–1999) and director of the Harvard Institute for International Development (1999–2002).

=== Columbia University ===
Sachs is the director of the Center for Sustainable Development at Columbia University. He is university professor at Columbia University. From 2002 to 2016, Sachs was director of the Earth Institute of Columbia University, a university-wide organization, with an interdisciplinary approach to addressing complex issues facing the Earth, in support of sustainable development. Sachs&#x27;s classes are taught at the School of International and Public Affairs and the Mailman School of Public Health, and his course &quot;Challenges of Sustainable Development&quot; is taught at the undergraduate level.

== Scholarship, consulting, and activism ==
Sachs has advised several countries on economic policy.

=== Bolivia ===
Prior to the 1985 Bolivian general election, Sachs was invited by Hugo Banzer to advise him on an anti-inflation economic plan to implement if he was elected. Sachs&#x27; stabilization plan centered on price deregulation, particularly for oil, along with cuts to the national budget. Sachs stated that his plan could end Bolivian hyperinflation, which had reached up to 14,000%, in a single day. Although Banzer lost the election to Víctor Paz Estenssoro, Sachs&#x27;s plan was still implemented. Inflation quickly stabilized in Bolivia.

Sachs&#x27;s suggestion for reducing inflation was to apply fiscal and monetary discipline and end economic regulation that protected the elites and blocked the free market. Hyperinflation reduced within weeks of the Bolivian government instituting his suggestions and the government settled its $3.3 billion debt to international lenders for about 11 cents on the dollar. At the time, this was about 85% of Bolivia&#x27;s GDP.

=== Advising in post-communist economies ===

In 1989, Sachs advised Poland&#x27;s anticommunist Solidarity movement and the government of Prime Minister Tadeusz Mazowiecki. He wrote a comprehensive plan for the transition from central planning to a market economy which became incorporated into Poland&#x27;s reform program led by Finance Minister Leszek Balcerowicz. Sachs was the main architect of Poland&#x27;s debt reduction operation. Sachs and IMF economist David Lipton advised on the rapid conversion of all property and assets from public to private ownership. Closure of many uncompetitive factories ensued. In Poland, Sachs was firmly on the side of rapid transition to capitalism. At first, he proposed American-style corporate structures, with professional managers answering to many shareholders and a large economic role for stock markets. That did not bode well with the Polish authorities, but he then proposed that large blocks of the shares of privatized companies be placed in the hands of private banks. As a result, there were some economic shortages and inflation, but prices in Poland eventually stabilized. The government of Poland awarded Sachs one of its highest honors in 1999, the Commander&#x27;s Cross of the Order of Merit. He also received an honorary doctorate from the Kraków University of Economics. Based on Poland&#x27;s success, his advice was sought first by Soviet President Mikhail Gorbachev and by his successor, Russian President Boris Yeltsin, on the transition of the USSR/Russia to a market economy.

Sachs&#x27; methods for stabilizing economies became known as shock therapy and were similar to successful approaches used in Germany after the two world wars. He faced criticism for his role after the Russian economy faced significant struggles after adopting the market-based shock therapy in the early 1990s.

=== Work on global economic development ===
Since his work in post-communist countries, Sachs has turned to global issues of economic development, poverty alleviation, health and aid policy and environmental sustainability. He has written extensively on climate change, disease control and globalization. Since 1995, he has been engaged in efforts to alleviate poverty in Africa. According to &quot;New York Magazine&quot;, Sachs&#x27;s ambitions are hard to overstate... &quot;His ultimate goal is to change the world — to &#x27;bend history,&#x27; as he once said, quoting Robert F. Kennedy,&quot; wrote Nina Munk in &quot;The Idealist&quot;, a biography of Sachs. By the early aughts, he had risen from wonky academic to celebrity public intellectual. According to Munk, people in Sachs&#x27;s inner circle affectionately called him a &quot;shit disturber,&quot; someone whose ego was offset by a selfless genius and a penchant for challenging orthodoxies. &quot;There&#x27;s a certain messianic quality about him,&quot; George Soros, one of his patrons, told Munk.
In his 2005 work &quot;The End of Poverty&quot;, which had a foreword by Bono, Sachs wrote that &quot;Africa&#x27;s governance is poor because Africa is poor&quot;. According to Sachs, with the right policies and key interventions, extreme poverty—defined as living on less than $1 a day—can be eradicated within 20 years. India and China are examples, with the latter lifting 300 million people out of extreme poverty during the last two decades. Sachs has said that a key element to accomplishing this is raising aid from $65 billion in 2002 to $195 billion a year by 2015. He emphasizes the role of geography and climate as much of Africa is landlocked and disease-prone. However, he stresses that these problems can be overcome.

Sachs suggests that with improved seeds, irrigation and fertilizer, the crop yields in Africa and other places with subsistence farming can be increased from 1 ton per hectare to 3 to 5 tons per hectare. He said that increased harvests would significantly increase the income of subsistence farmers, thereby reducing poverty. Sachs does not believe that increased aid is the only solution. He also supports establishing credit and microloan programs which are often lacking in impoverished areas. Sachs advocates the distribution of free insecticide-treated bed nets to combat malaria. The economic impact of malaria has been estimated to cost Africa $12 billion per year. Sachs estimates that malaria can be controlled for $3 billion per year, therefore suggesting that anti-malaria projects would be an economically justified investment.

He is founding editor of the World Happiness Report.

The Millennium Villages Project (MVP), which he directs, operates in more than a dozen African countries and covers more than 500,000 people. Critics of the MVP have questioned both the design of the project and claims made for its success. In 2012, &quot;The Economist&quot; reviewed the project and concluded &quot;the evidence does not yet support the claim that the millennium villages project is making a decisive impact&quot;. Critics have said that the programme had not included suitable controls to allow an accurate determination of whether the MVP methods were responsible for any observed gains in economic development. A 2012 &quot;Lancet&quot; paper claiming a three-fold increase in the rate of decline in childhood mortality was criticized for flawed methodology and the authors later admitted that the claim was &quot;unwarranted and misleading&quot;. In her 2013 book, &quot;The Idealist: Jeffrey Sachs and the Quest to End Poverty&quot;, journalist Nina Munk concluded that the MVP was a failure.

Following the adoption of the Millennium Development Goals (MDGs) in 2000, Sachs chaired the WHO Commission on Macroeconomics and Health (2000–2001) which played a pivotal role in scaling up the financing of health care and disease control in the low-income countries to support MDGs 4, 5 and 6. He worked with UN Secretary-General Kofi Annan in 2000–2001 to design and launch The Global Fund to Fight AIDS, Tuberculosis and Malaria. He also worked with senior officials of the George W. Bush administration to develop the PEPFAR program to fight HIV/AIDS and the PMI to fight malaria. On behalf of Annan, from 2002 to 2006 he chaired the UN Millennium Project which was tasked with developing a concrete action plan to achieve the MDGs. The UN General Assembly adopted the key recommendations of the UN Millennium Project at a special session in September 2005.

Previously a special adviser to secretary-general António Guterres, Sachs is an advocate for the 2015 Sustainable Development Goals which build upon and supersede the MDGs.

In his capacity as a special adviser at the UN, Sachs has frequently met with foreign dignitaries and heads of state. He was photographed with Matt Damon and developed a friendship with international celebrities Bono and Angelina Jolie, who traveled to Africa with Sachs to witness the progress of the Millennium Villages.

Sachs has criticized the International Monetary Fund and its policies around the world and blamed international bankers for what he says is a pattern of ineffective investment strategies.

During the Greek government-debt crisis in July 2015, Sachs, Heiner Flassbeck, Thomas Piketty, Dani Rodrik and Simon Wren-Lewis, published an open letter to the Chancellor of Germany Angela Merkel, regarding Greek debt.

Sachs is one of the founders of the Deep Decarbonization Pathways Project.

==Views and commentary==

===Nuclear power===
In 2012 Sachs stated that nuclear power is the only solution to climate change. In 2021 he suggested that carbon neutrality could be achieved without the use of nuclear power by mid-century, if rapid technological development continues.

===China===
According to Stuart Lau and Luanna Muniz writing in &quot;Politico&quot;, Sachs is a &quot;long-time advocate of dismantling American hegemony and embracing the rise of China.&quot; He said the term &quot;genocide&quot; is mistaken in relation to the repression of the Uyghurs in China. He has argued for closer relations between the US and China and warned of the danger of tensions between them.

===Syria===
In April 2018, he supported President Donald Trump&#x27;s view that the United States should come out of Syria &quot;very soon&quot;, adding: &quot;It&#x27;s long past time for the United States to end its destructive military engagement in Syria and across the Middle East, though the security state seems unlikely to let this happen.&quot; When asked by Isaac Chotiner if he was aware that Syrian leader Bashar Al-Assad had killed his own people in a 2023 interview, Sachs answered no to the question and replied that he was &quot;aware of a lot more than you are aware of about Syria, because I know a great deal about the day-to-day events from the spring of 2011 onward.&quot;

===Venezuela===
A 2019 report authored by Sachs and Mark Weisbrot, published by the Center for Economic and Policy Research, stated that a 31% rise in the number of deaths between 2017 and 2018 was due to the sanctions imposed on Venezuela in 2017 and that 40,000 people in Venezuela may have died as a result. The report states: &quot;The sanctions are depriving Venezuelans of lifesaving medicines, medical equipment, food, and other essential imports.&quot; Weisbrot stated that the authors &quot;could not prove those excess deaths were the result of sanctions, but said the increase ran parallel to the imposition of the measures and an attendant fall in oil production.&quot;

A United States Department of State spokesperson said that &quot;as the writers themselves concede, the report is based on speculation and conjecture.&quot; Ricardo Hausmann, a Harvard economist who was adviser to then Venezuelan opposition leader, Juan Guaidó, stated that the analysis was flawed because it made invalid assumptions about Venezuela based on a different country, Colombia, saying that &quot;taking what happened in Colombia since 2017 as a counterfactual for what would have happened in Venezuela if there had been no financial sanctions makes no sense.&quot; Calling it &quot;sloppy reasoning&quot;, Hausmann also stated that the analysis failed to rule out other explanations and failed to correctly account for PDVSA finances.

===COVID-19===
Early in the COVID-19 pandemic, Sachs said the COVID-19 lab leak theory, which posited the SARS-CoV-2 virus was released from a Chinese laboratory, was &quot;reckless and dangerous,&quot; and said that right-wing politicians pointing fingers at the Wuhan Institute of Virology could &quot;push the world to conflict... Neither the biology nor chronology support the laboratory-release story&quot;.

In spring 2020, Richard Horton, editor of &quot;The Lancet&quot;, appointed Sachs as chair of its COVID-19 Commission, whose goals were to provide recommendations for public health policy and improve the practice of medicine. Sachs set up a number of task forces, including one on the origins of the virus. Sachs appointed British American disease ecologist Peter Daszak, a colleague of Sachs&#x27; at Columbia, to head this task force, two weeks after the Trump administration prematurely ended a federal grant supporting a project led by Daszak, EcoHealth Alliance, which worked with the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Sachs later came to believe that Daszak had a conflict of interest due to his connections to the Wuhan lab and the nature of the lab&#x27;s research. Richard Ebright, chemical biologist at Rutgers University, called the commission an &quot;entirely Potemkin commission&quot; in the &quot;National Review&quot;. As Sachs became increasingly drawn to the lab leak theory, he came into conflict with Daszak and his task force. Daszak left as chair of the taskforce in June 2021 and Sachs disbanded the group in September that year.

In July 2022, Sachs said he was &quot;pretty convinced,&quot; though &quot;not sure&quot; that COVID-19 came out of &quot;U.S. lab biotechnology,&quot; which is considered by the European Union to be COVID-19 disinformation by China. While Sachs has leanings toward the possibility of a virus leak from a &quot;U.S.-backed laboratory research program,&quot; he has stated that &quot;A natural spillover is also possible, of course. Both hypotheses are viable at this stage.&quot;

In August 2022, Sachs appeared on the podcast of Robert F. Kennedy Jr., who is a proponent of COVID-19 vaccine misinformation, where he said that officials such as Anthony Fauci were not being honest about the origins of COVID.

In September 2022, the Lancet commission published a wide-ranging report on the pandemic, stating that the origins of the virus remain unknown. &quot;There are two leading hypotheses: that the virus emerged as a zoonotic spillover from wildlife or a farm animal, possibly through a wet market, in a location that is still undetermined; or that the virus emerged from a research-related incident, during the field collection of viruses or through a laboratory-associated escape. Commissioners held diverse views about the relative probabilities of the two explanations, and both possibilities require further scientific investigation.&quot; Virologist David Robertson said the suggestion of US laboratory involvement was &quot;wild speculation&quot; and that &quot;it&#x27;s really disappointing to see such a potentially influential report contributing to further misinformation on such an important topic.&quot; In the same article, Angela Rasmussen of the Canadian Vaccine and Infectious Disease Organization said that the release of the report may have been &quot;one of &quot;The Lancet&quot;&#x27;s most shameful moments regarding its role as a steward and leader in communicating crucial findings about science and medicine.&quot;

===War in Ukraine===

In May 2022, Sachs said that the Russian invasion of Ukraine in February 2022 would be hard to beat and that Finland&#x27;s moves to join NATO would undermine a negotiated peace: &quot;All of this talk of defeating Russia, to my mind, is reckless.&quot; In June 2022, he co-signed an open letter calling for a &quot;ceasefire&quot; in the war, questioning Western countries&#x27; continuing military support for Ukraine.

In 2022, Sachs appeared several times on one of the top-rated shows funded by the Russian government, hosted by Vladimir Solovyov, to call for Ukraine to negotiate and step away from its &quot;maximalist demands&quot; of removing Russia from Ukrainian territory.

Sachs has suggested that the U.S. was responsible for the sabotage of the Nord Stream pipeline. In February 2023, he was invited by the Russian government to address the United Nations Security Council about the topic.

== Critical reception ==

===Economics===
Sachs&#x27;s policies for the global eradication of extreme poverty have been the subject of controversy. Nina Munk, author of the 2013 book &quot;The Idealist: Jeffrey Sachs and the Quest to End Poverty&quot;, says that &quot;sometimes good intentions have left people even worse off than before&quot;. Stephan Richter, editor-in-chief at &quot;The Globalist&quot;, and James D. Bindenagel, a former U.S. ambassador, wrote that &quot;In his books and articles, Jeff Sachs has done much to frame and popularize the language and thinking to push a sustainable development agenda on the world stage. That is an achievement in which he can rightfully take considerable pride&quot;.

William Easterly, a professor of economics at New York University, reviewed &quot;The End of Poverty&quot; for the &quot;Washington Post&quot;, calling Sachs&#x27;s poverty eradication plan &quot;a sort of Great Leap Forward&quot;. According to Easterly&#x27;s cross-country statistical analysis in his book &quot;The White Man&#x27;s Burden,&quot; from 1985 to 2006, &quot;When we control both for initial poverty and for bad government, it is bad government that explains the slower growth. We cannot statistically discern any effect of initial poverty on subsequent growth once we control for bad government. This is still true if we limit the definition of bad government to corruption alone.&quot; Easterly deems the massive aid proposed by Sachs to be ineffective, as its effect will be hampered by bad governance and/or corruption.

Commenting on Sachs&#x27;s $120 million effort to aid Africa, American travel writer and novelist Paul Theroux says these temporary measures failed to create sustained improvements. Theroux focuses on a project in a sparsely populated community of nomadic camel herders in Dertu, Kenya, funded by Sachs&#x27;s Millennium Villages Project, which cost million over a three-year period. Theroux says that the project&#x27;s latrines were clogged and overflowing, the dormitories it built quickly became dilapidated, and the livestock market it established ignored local customs and was shut down within a few months. He says that an angry Dertu citizen filed a 15-point written complaint against Sachs&#x27;s operation, claiming it &quot;created dependence&quot; and that &quot;the project is supposed to be bottom top approached but it is visa versa.&quot;

According to the Canadian journalist Naomi Klein, Jeffrey Sachs is one of the architects of &quot;disaster capitalism&quot; after his recommendations in Bolivia, Poland and Russia led to millions of people ending up in the streets.

===China===
In December 2018, Meng Wanzhou, Chief Financial Officer of Huawei, was arrested in Canada at the request of the U.S., which was seeking her extradition to face charges of allegedly violating sanctions against Iran. Soon after Meng&#x27;s arrest, Sachs wrote an article in which he said her arrest was part of efforts to contain China and accused the U.S. of hypocrisy for seeking her extradition. He wrote that none of the executives of several U.S. companies which had been fined for sanctions violations were arrested. After he was criticized for the article, Sachs closed his Twitter account, which had 260,000 followers. Isaac Stone Fish, a senior fellow at Asia Society, wrote that Sachs had written a foreword to a Huawei position paper, and asked if Sachs had been paid by Huawei. Sachs said he had not been paid for the work.

In June 2020, Sachs said the targeting of Huawei by the US was not solely about security. In their 2020 book &quot;Hidden Hand&quot;, Clive Hamilton and Mareike Ohlberg commented on one of Sachs&#x27;s articles in which he accused the U.S. government of maligning Huawei under hypocritical pretenses. Hamilton and Ohlberg wrote that Sachs&#x27;s article would be more meaningful and influential if he did not have a close relationship with Huawei, including his previous endorsement of the company&#x27;s &quot;vision of our shared digital future.&quot; The authors also alleged that Sachs has ties to a number of Chinese state bodies and the private energy corporation CEFC China Energy for which he has spoken.

During a January 2021 interview, despite the interviewer&#x27;s repeated prompting, Sachs did not answer questions about China&#x27;s repression of Uyghur people and instead referred to Jesus&#x27; parable about the Mote and the Beam, referring to &quot;huge human rights abuses committed by the U.S.&quot;. Subsequently, 19 advocacy and rights groups jointly wrote a letter to Columbia University questioning Sachs&#x27; comments. The letter&#x27;s signatories wrote that Sachs took the same stance as China&#x27;s Ministry of Foreign Affairs, a digression to the history of U.S. rights violations as a way to avoid discussions of China&#x27;s mistreatment of Uyghurs. The rights groups went on to say that Sachs &quot;betrayed his institution&#x27;s mission&quot; by trivializing the perspective of those who were oppressed by the Chinese government. Stephan Richter, editor-in-chief at &quot;The Globalist&quot;, and J.D. Bindenagel, a former U.S. ambassador, wrote that Sachs was &quot;actively agitating(!) for a classic Communist propaganda ploy&quot;.

===War in Ukraine===
In March 2023 a group of 340 economists published an open letter, criticising his views on the ongoing Russia-Ukraine war.

== Personal life ==

<doc id="368421" wikidata="Q1441734" url="?curid=368421" title="Garden-path sentence">
<text>A garden-path sentence is a grammatically correct sentence that starts in such a way that a reader&#x27;s most likely interpretation will be incorrect; the reader is lured into a parse that turns out to be a dead end or yields a clearly unintended meaning. &quot;Garden path&quot; refers to the saying &quot;&quot;, meaning to be deceived, tricked, or seduced. In &quot;A Dictionary of Modern English Usage&quot; (1926), Fowler describes such sentences as unwittingly laying a &quot;false scent&quot;.

Such a sentence leads the reader toward a seemingly familiar meaning that is actually not the one intended. It is a special type of sentence that creates a momentarily ambiguous interpretation because it contains a word or phrase that can be interpreted in multiple ways, causing the reader to begin to believe that a phrase will mean one thing when in reality it means something else. When read, the sentence seems ungrammatical, makes almost no sense, and often requires rereading so that its meaning may be fully understood after careful parsing. Though these sentences are grammatically correct, such sentences are syntactically non-standard (or incorrect) as evidenced by the need for re-reading and careful parsing. Garden-path sentences are not usually desirable in writing that intends to communicate clearly.

==Examples==
===&quot;The old man the boat.&quot;===
This is a common example that has been the subject of psycholinguistic research and has been used to test the capabilities of artificial intelligence efforts. The difficulty in correctly parsing the sentence results from the fact that readers tend to interpret &quot;old&quot; as an adjective. Reading &quot;the&quot;, they expect a noun or an adjective to follow, and when they then read &quot;old&quot; followed by &quot;man&quot; they assume that the phrase &quot;the old man&quot; is to be interpreted as &quot;determiner&quot; – &quot;adjective&quot; – &quot;noun&quot;. When readers encounter another &quot;the&quot; following the supposed noun &quot;man&quot; (rather than the expected verb, as in e.g., &quot;The old man washed the boat&quot;), they are forced to re-analyze the sentence. As with other examples, one explanation for the initial misunderstanding by the reader is that a sequence of words or phrases tends to be analyzed in terms of a frequent pattern: in this case: &quot;determiner&quot; – &quot;adjective&quot; – &quot;noun&quot;. Rephrased, the sentence could be rewritten as &quot;Those who man the boat are old.&quot;

===&quot;The complex houses married and single soldiers and their families.&quot;===
This is another commonly cited example. Like the previous sentence, the initial parse is to read &quot;the complex houses&quot; as a noun phrase, but &quot;the complex houses married&quot; does not make semantic sense (only people can marry) and &quot;the complex houses married and single&quot; makes no sense at all (after &quot;married and...&quot;, the expectation is another verb to form a compound predicate). The correct parsing is &quot;The complex&quot; [noun phrase] &quot;houses&quot; [verb] &quot;married and single soldiers&quot; [noun phrase] &quot;and their families&quot; [noun phrase]. Rephrased, the sentence could be rewritten as &quot;The complex provides housing for the soldiers, married or single, as well as their families.&quot;

===&quot;The horse raced past the barn fell.&quot;===
This frequently used, classic example of a garden-path sentence is attributed to Thomas Bever. The sentence is hard to parse because &quot;raced&quot; can be interpreted as a finite verb or as a passive participle. The reader initially interprets &quot;raced&quot; as the main verb in the simple past, but when the reader encounters &quot;fell&quot;, they are forced to re-analyze the sentence, concluding that &quot;raced&quot; is being used as a passive participle and &quot;horse&quot; is the direct object of the subordinate clause. The sentence could be replaced by &quot;The horse that was raced past the barn fell&quot;, where &quot;that was raced past the barn&quot; tells the reader which horse is under discussion. Such examples of initial ambiguity resulting from a &quot;reduced relative with [a] potentially intransitive verb&quot; (&quot;The horse raced in the barn fell.&quot;) can be contrasted with the lack of ambiguity for a non-reduced relative (&quot;The horse &quot;that was&quot; raced in the barn fell.&quot;) or with a reduced relative with an unambiguously transitive verb (&quot;The horse frightened in the barn fell.&quot;). As with other examples, one explanation for the initial misunderstanding by the reader is that a sequence of phrases tends to be analyzed in terms of the frequent pattern: &quot;agent&quot; – &quot;action&quot; – &quot;patient&quot;.

=== In other languages ===

====German====

This example turns on the two meanings of German : the adjective meaning English &#x27;modern&#x27;, and the verb meaning &#x27;to rot&#x27;.

The theme of the &quot;picture exhibition&quot; in the first clause lends itself to interpreting as an adjective meaning &#x27;contemporary&#x27;, until the last two words of the sentence: 

* &#x27;Most of all, it is the picture frames in this exhibition that are becoming modern, because they are made out of wood, and had been stored in the dank cellar.&#x27;

This causes dissonance at the end of the sentence, and forces backtracking to recover the proper usage and sense (and different pronunciation) of the first word of the sentence, not as the adjective meaning &quot;contemporary&quot;, but as the verb meaning &quot;going moldy&quot;:

* &#x27;Most of all, it is the picture frames in this exhibition that are becoming moldy, because they are made out of wood and had been stored in the dank cellar.&#x27;

The ambiguity, however, is only perceived in writing, since the two occurrences of the word in the sentence have different pronunciations (for &#x27;going moldy&#x27; it is stressed on the first syllable, while for &#x27;contemporary&#x27; on the second one).

====Portuguese====

This example makes use of the ambiguity between the and the , which is also captured by the English word &quot;suspect&quot;. It also makes use of a misreading in which the word is passed over by the parser, which lends to two different meanings.

* In a first parse, the sentence might be read as &#x27;[A] mother [who is the] suspect of son&#x27;s death runs away.&#x27; In this sentence, the serves as an adjective for the mother who runs away due to the fact that is easily overlooked.
* A second parse, however, reveals the true reading of the sentence to be &#x27;[A] mother suspects son&#x27;s death and runs away.&#x27; now serves as a verb and reveals that a mother suspects that her son might be dead.

==Parsing==

When reading a sentence, readers will analyze the words and phrases they see and make inferences about the sentence’s grammatical structure and meaning in a process called parsing. Generally, readers will parse the sentence chunks at a time and will try to interpret the meaning of the sentence at each interval. As readers are given more information, they make an assumption of the contents and meaning of the whole sentence. With each new portion of the sentence encountered, they will try to make that part make sense with the sentence structures that they have already interpreted and their assumption about the rest of the sentence. The garden-path sentence effect occurs when the sentence has a phrase or word with an ambiguous meaning that the reader interprets in a certain way and, when they read the whole sentence, there is a difference in what has been read and what was expected. The reader must then read and evaluate the sentence again to understand its meaning. The sentence may be parsed and interpreted in different ways due to the influence of pragmatics, semantics, or other factors describing the extralinguistic context.

===Parsing strategies===
Various strategies can be used when parsing a sentence, and there is much debate over which parsing strategy humans use. Differences in parsing strategies can be seen from the effects of a reader attempting to parse a part of a sentence that is ambiguous in its syntax or meaning. For this reason, garden-path sentences are often studied as a way to test which strategy humans use. Two debated parsing strategies that humans are thought to use are serial and parallel parsing.

Serial parsing is where the reader makes one interpretation of the ambiguity and continues to parse the sentence in the context of that interpretation. The reader will continue to use the initial interpretation as reference for future parsing until disambiguating information is given.

Parallel parsing is where the reader recognizes and generates multiple interpretations of the sentence and stores them until disambiguating information is given, at which point only the correct interpretation is maintained.

==Reanalysis of a garden-path sentence==
When ambiguous nouns appear, they can function as both the object of the first item or the subject of the second item. In that case, the former use is preferred. It is also found that the reanalysis of a garden-path sentence gets more and more difficult with the length of the ambiguous phrase.

===Recovery strategies===
A research paper published by Meseguer, Carreiras and Clifton (2002) stated that intensive eye movements are observed when people are recovering from a mild garden-path sentence. They proposed that people use two strategies, both of which are consistent with the selective reanalysis process described by Frazier and Rayner in 1982. According to them, the readers predominantly use two alternative strategies to recover from mild garden-path sentences. 
* The more common one includes the regression of eyes from the first disambiguation directly to the main verb of the sentence. Then the readers reread the remainder of the sentence, fixating their eyes to the next region and the adverb (the beginning of the ambiguous part of the sentence).
* The lesser-used strategy includes the regression from the first disambiguation directly to the adverb.

===Partial re-analysis===
Partial re-analysis occurs when analysis is not complete. Frequently, when people can make even a little bit of sense of the later sentence, they stop analysing further so the former part of the sentence still remains in memory and does not get discarded from it.

Therefore, the original misinterpretation of the sentence remains even after the re-analysis is done; hence participants&#x27; final interpretations are often incorrect.

===Difficulties in revision===
Recent research has utilized adult second-language learners, or L2 learners, to study difficulties in revision of the initial parsing of garden-path sentences. During the processing of garden-path sentences, the reader has an initial parse of the sentence, but often has to revise their parse because it is incorrect. Unlike adult native speakers, children tend to have difficulty revising their first parsing of the sentence. This difficulty is attributed to the underdeveloped executive functioning of children. Executive functioning skills are utilized when the initial parsing of a sentence needs to be discarded for a revised parsing, and underdeveloped or damaged executive functioning impairs this ability. As the child ages and their executive functioning completes development, they gain the ability to revise the initial incorrect parsing. However, difficulties in revision are not unique to children. Adult L2 learners also exhibit difficulty in revisions, but the difficulties cannot be attributed to underdeveloped executive functioning.

In a 2015 study, adult L2 learners were compared to adult native speakers and native-speaking children in revision and processing of garden-path sentences using act-out errors and eye movement. Adult native English speakers, English-speaking children, and adult English L2 learners were shown garden-path sentences or disambiguated garden-path sentences that either had reference information or no reference information and then asked to act out the sentence. Adult L2 speakers had fewer act-out errors than native-speaking children when the garden-path sentence was presented with referential information, similarly to the adult native speakers that present less act-out errors than both the adult L2 learners and native-speaking children. Adult L2 speakers and native adult speakers were able to use discourse and referential information to aid in their processing of the garden-path sentences. This ability could be due to the adults’ developed executive functioning allowing them more cognitive resources, discourse and referential information, to aid in parsing and revision. Additionally, the use of discourse and referential information could be due to L1-transfer because Italian and English share the same sentence structure. However, when the garden-path sentences are disambiguated and then presented, the adult L2 speakers had the highest act-out error rate followed by native-speaking children and then by adult native speakers. The results of this study indicate that difficulties in parsing revision are more common than originally thought and are not confined to children or individuals with reduced executive functioning. Adults, both native speakers and L2 learners, use discourse and referential information in parsing and sentence processing. But adult L2 learners and native-speaking children had similar error rates for garden-path sentences with no reference information, indicating systematic revision failure.

<doc id="368422" wikidata="Q454292" url="?curid=368422" title="Alfred Vail">
<text>Alfred Lewis Vail (September 25, 1807 – January 18, 1859) was an American machinist and inventor. Along with Samuel Morse, Vail was central in developing and commercializing American electrical telegraphy between 1837 and 1844.

Vail and Morse were the first two telegraph operators on Morse&#x27;s first experimental line between Washington, D.C., and Baltimore, and Vail took charge of building and managing several early telegraph lines between 1845 and 1848. He was also responsible for several technical innovations of Morse&#x27;s system, particularly the first sending key, which Vail invented, and improved recording registers and relay magnets. Vail left the telegraph industry in 1848 because he believed that the managers of Morse&#x27;s lines did not fully value his contributions.

His last assignment, superintendent of the Washington and New Orleans Telegraph Company, paid him only $900 a year, leading Vail to write to Morse,
: &quot;I have made up my mind to leave the Telegraph to take care of itself, since it cannot take care of me. I shall, in a few months, leave Washington for New Jersey, ... and bid &quot;adieu&quot; to the subject of the Telegraph for some more profitable business.&quot;

==Early life==

Vail&#x27;s parents were Bethiah Youngs (1778–1847) and Stephen Vail (1780–1864). Vail was born in Morristown, New Jersey, where his father was an entrepreneur and industrialist who built the Speedwell Ironworks into one of the most innovative iron works of its time. Their other son George Vail, Alfred&#x27;s brother, was a noted politician.

Alfred attended public schools before taking a job as a machinist at the iron works. He enrolled in New York University to study theology in 1832, where he was an active and successful student and a member of the Eucleian Society, graduating in 1836.

==Involvement with Morse&#x27;s telegraph==
Visiting his alma mater on September 2, 1837, Vail happened to witness one of Samuel Morse&#x27;s early telegraph experiments. He became fascinated by the technology and negotiated an arrangement with Morse to develop the technology at Speedwell Ironworks, at his own expense, in return for 25% of the proceeds. Alfred split his share with his brother George Vail.
After having secured his father&#x27;s financial backing, and being a skilled machinist, Vail refined Morse&#x27;s crude prototype telegraph to make it suitable for public demonstration and commercial operation.

The first successful completion of a transmission with this system was at the Speedwell Iron Works on January 6, 1838, across two miles (3 km) of wire. The message read &quot;A patient waiter is no loser.&quot; Over the next few months Morse and Vail demonstrated the telegraph to Philadelphia&#x27;s Franklin Institute, members of Congress, and President Martin Van Buren and his cabinet. Demonstrations such as these were crucial to Morse&#x27;s obtaining a Congressional appropriation of $30,000 to build his first line in 1844 from Washington to Baltimore.

==Retirement from telegraphy==
When Morse took on an influential congressman as a partner, Morse cut the Vail brothers&#x27; share to one-eighth, although the other partners&#x27; shares were not reduced. Morse retained patent rights to all the apparatus and the alphabetic code-system that Vail had developed.

Vail retired from the telegraph operations in 1848 and moved back to Morristown, where he spent his last ten years researching genealogy. Since Alfred and his brother George shared a one-eighth interest in Morse&#x27;s telegraph patents, Vail realized far less financial gain from his work on the telegraph than Morse and others.

His papers and equipment were subsequently donated by his son Stephen to the Smithsonian Institution and New Jersey Historical Society.

Alfred Vail&#x27;s cousin, Theodore N. Vail, became the first president of American Telephone &amp; Telegraph.

==Morse code==
Alfred Vail and Samuel Morse collaborated in the invention of Morse code.

The &quot;Morse code&quot; that went into operational use after Vail had become involved was very different from Morse&#x27;s original plan. A controversy exists over the role of each in the invention. The argument for Vail being the original inventor is laid out by several scholars.

The argument offered by supporters of Morse claims that Morse originally devised a cipher code similar to that used in existing semaphore line telegraphs, by which words were assigned three- or four-digit numbers and entered into a code book. The sending operator converted words to these number groups and the receiving operator converted them back to words through the same code book.

Morse spent several months compiling this code dictionary. It is said by Morse supporters that Vail, in public and private writings, never claimed the code for himself. According to one researcher, in a February 1838 letter to his father, Judge Stephen Vail, Alfred wrote,
: &quot;Professor Morse has invented a new plan of an alphabet, and has thrown aside the Dictionaries.&quot;
In an 1845 book Vail wrote describing Morse&#x27;s telegraph, he also attributed the code to Morse. He died in 1859 at the age of 51.

==Honors==
A U.S. Army base was named in Vail&#x27;s honor: Camp Vail in Eatontown, New Jersey, later temporarily renamed Fort Monmouth, was an Army housing complex.

After World War II the families of servicemen and civilian Army employees negotiated with the Army to purchase the development, which they incorporated as the &quot;Alfred Vail Mutual Association&quot;. Due to the diligent efforts of the town clerk, the rights of the charter of the original Shrewsbury Township (est. 1693) were transferred to the residents. The housing development exists under that name to this day.

An elementary school in Morristown, New Jersey, near the site of the Speedwell Iron Works, is named Alfred Vail Elementary School in his honor.

<doc id="368423" wikidata="Q189186" url="?curid=368423" title="Zelman Cowen">
<text>Sir Zelman Cowen, (7 October 1919 – 8 December 2011) was an Australian legal scholar and university administrator who served as the 19th Governor-General of Australia, in office from 1977 to 1982.

Cowen was born in Melbourne, and attended Scotch College before going on to the University of Melbourne where he was resident at Ormond College. His studies were interrupted by World War II, during which he served in the Royal Australian Navy. After the war&#x27;s end, Cowen attended New College, Oxford, on a Rhodes Scholarship. He subsequently won the prestigious Vinerian Scholarship as the best student in the Bachelor of Civil Law degree. He remained at Oxford after graduating, serving as a fellow of Oriel College from 1947 to 1950.

In 1951, Cowen returned to Australia to become dean of the law faculty at the University of Melbourne. In 1953, still while at the University of Melbourne, he was awarded a Fulbright Senior Scholarship in Law to Harvard University. He became known as an expert on constitutional law, and was a visiting professor at a number of overseas institutions. He later served as vice-chancellor of the University of New England (1966–1970) and the University of Queensland (1970–1977). In 1977, Malcolm Fraser appointed Cowen to succeed John Kerr as governor-general. He was an uncontroversial choice, and became the second Jewish holder of the position, after Sir Isaac Isaacs. After leaving office, Cowen returned to academia, serving as provost of Oriel College, Oxford, from 1982 to 1990.

==Early life==
Cowen was born in Melbourne in 1919 into a Jewish family named Cohen, the son of Bernard Cohen (1892–1975), from Belarus and Sara Cohen (née Granat; 1894–1989), born in Australia. His paternal grandparents were Jewish immigrants from Belarus in the Russian Empire. The name was formally changed to Cowen when he was a young boy. He was educated at St Kilda Park State School, Scotch College and the University of Melbourne. He served in the Royal Australian Navy during the Second World War, and was in Darwin during the bombing raid of 1942, before being transferred to Brisbane to work in the cipher unit of General MacArthur&#x27;s office. He married Anna Wittner in 1945. Cowen then went as a Rhodes Scholar to New College, Oxford, where he completed a Bachelor of Civil Law degree and jointly won the Vinerian Scholarship. From 1947 to 1950 he was a fellow of Oriel College, Oxford, and was also a consultant on legal matters to the British Military Government in Allied-occupied Germany.

Zelman Cowen was a 1953 Fulbright Senior Scholar in Law from the University of Melbourne to Harvard University.

==Educational career==
In 1951 Cowen returned to Australia and became dean of the law faculty at the University of Melbourne, a post he held until 1966 where he appointed, and worked with Francis Patrick Donovan. During these years he was frequently a visiting professor at American universities, including the University of Chicago, the University of Illinois and the University of Washington. He also advised the British Colonial Office on constitutional matters and advised the governments of Ghana and Hong Kong on legal issues. Among many other works, he published a biography of Sir Isaac Isaacs, the first Australian-born and first Jewish Governor-General of Australia.

Cowen was appointed Vice-Chancellor of the University of New England in Armidale, New South Wales, in 1966. The following year, he produced for ABC television the &quot;Yes&quot; case for the Australian referendum, 1967 (Aboriginals). From 1970 to 1977 he was Vice-Chancellor of the University of Queensland in Brisbane, during the difficult years of the Vietnam War and Springbok tour student protests. In 1977 Ray Crooke painted &quot;Portrait of Professor Emeritus Sir Zelman Cowen&quot; which is part of the University of Queensland collection. By this time he was regarded as one of the leading constitutional lawyers in the English-speaking world. He was Emeritus Professor of Law at Melbourne and the Tagore Professor of Law at the University of Calcutta. During his time in Queensland he handled disturbances at the university, resulting from protests against the Vietnam War, with diplomatic skill.

==Governor-General==

When Sir John Kerr&#x27;s turbulent period of office as Governor-General ended with his early resignation in 1977, the Prime Minister, Malcolm Fraser, offered Cowen the post. He was in some ways a perfect choice. He was a distinguished Australian with an international reputation, his knowledge of the Constitution and the law were beyond dispute, and his political views were unknown. The fact that Cowen was Jewish gave his appointment a multicultural aspect in keeping with contemporary Australian sentiment. He served four and a half years as Governor-General, from December 1977 to July 1982.

==Post vice-regal career==
From 1982 to 1990 Cowen was Provost of Oriel College, Oxford. After his retirement he returned to Australia and became active in Jewish community affairs in Melbourne. He also pursued a range of other interests, including serving for five years on the board of Fairfax Newspapers (three of them as Chairman) during a turbulent period for the company; and being patron of St Kilda Football Club. During the lead-up to the 1999 Australian republic referendum, he supported a moderate republican position.

==Personal life==
On 7 June 1945, Cowen married Anna Wittner (5 July 1925 – 10 June 2022) and had four children, Shimon, Yosef, Kate and Ben. His son, Rabbi Shimon Cowen, is Director of the Institute for Judaism and Civilization in Melbourne.

==Death==
Cowen suffered from Parkinson&#x27;s disease for at least the last 15 years of his life. He died on 8 December 2011, at the age of 92, at his home in Toorak, Victoria. It was the 34th anniversary of his swearing-in as Governor-General in 1977.

His state funeral at Melbourne&#x27;s Temple Beth Israel in St Kilda was attended by the Governor-General, Dame Quentin Bryce, the Prime Minister, Julia Gillard, the Opposition Leader, Tony Abbott, and former Prime Ministers Malcolm Fraser, Bob Hawke and John Howard.

==Honours==
Cowen&#x27;s first honour was a Knight Bachelor in 1976. When appointed Governor-General he was made a Knight Grand Cross of the Order of St Michael and St George (GCMG) and Knight of the Order of Australia (AK) in 1977, and sworn into the Privy Council in 1977 (Rt Hon). When Queen Elizabeth II visited Australia in 1980 she appointed Cowen a Knight Grand Cross of the Royal Victorian Order (GCVO).

He was an Honorary Fellow of the Australian Academy of Technological Sciences and Engineering (FTSE).

In 1985, he was made an honorary fellow of Trinity College Dublin.

==Named Awards==

In 1981, the Royal Australian Institute of Architects (RAIA) established the Sir Zelman Cowen Award for Public Architecture which is widely recognised as Australia&#x27;s leading award for public buildings.

Melbourne Law School awards the &quot;Zelman Cowen Scholarship&quot; to incoming Juris Doctor students. Awarded purely on the basis of academic merit, it is the law school&#x27;s most prestigious scholarship. A special issue of the &quot;Melbourne University Law Review&quot; in 2015 published papers from a 2014 conference on legal, international, liberty, literary, university, and other public issues of significance in Cowen&#x27;s life and work; contributors included Glyn Davis, Justice Susan Kenny, Michael Crommelin, Donald Markwell, Cheryl Saunders, and Sir Frank Berman.

<text>Nathaniel Mayer Victor Rothschild, 3rd Baron Rothschild, (31 October 1910 – 20 March 1990), was a British scientist, intelligence officer during World War II, and later a senior executive with Royal Dutch Shell and N M Rothschild &amp; Sons, and an advisor to the Edward Heath and Margaret Thatcher governments of the UK. He was a member of the prominent Rothschild family.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Rothschild was born in Kensington, London, the only son of Charles Rothschild and Rózsika Rothschild (&quot;née&quot; Baroness Edle von Wertheimstein). Both parents were Jewish, his father a member of the Rothschild banking family and his mother the daughter of the first titled Jew in Austria. He grew up in Waddesdon Manor and Tring Park Mansion, among other family homes. He had three sisters, including Pannonica de Koenigswarter (who would become known as the &quot;Jazz Baroness&quot;) and Dame Miriam Louisa Rothschild. His father died by suicide when Rothschild was 13 years old. He was educated at Stanmore Park preparatory school (which he later dubbed a &quot;hell hole&quot;) and Harrow School, where the combination of archaic privileges and pointless rituals served only to annoy and bore him.

=== Cambridge and London ===
At Trinity College, Cambridge, Rothschild read physiology, French, and English, and was considered impressive enough an undergraduate to be spared the rigours of sitting the Natural Sciences Tripos, thus allowing him to embark immediately on a career in scientific research. Working in the Zoology Department, he was awarded a fellowship by Trinity in 1935 and a PhD two years later. He played first-class cricket for the University and Northamptonshire, where his experience of batting against the Nottinghamshire pair of Harold Larwood and Bill Voce he was later to describe as the most alarming of his life. At Cambridge he was known for his playboy lifestyle, driving a Bugatti and collecting art and rare books.

Rothschild joined the Cambridge Apostles, a secret society, which at that time was predominantly Marxist, though he stated himself that he &quot;was mildly left-wing but never a Marxist&quot;. He became friends with Guy Burgess, Anthony Blunt and Kim Philby, members of the Cambridge Spy Ring. His flat in London was shared with Burgess and Blunt; this later aroused suspicion that he was the so-called Fifth Man in the Spy Ring. In 1933, Rothschild gave Blunt £100 to purchase &quot;Eliezer and Rebecca&quot; by Nicolas Poussin. The painting was sold by Blunt&#x27;s executors in 1985 for £100,000 and is now in the Fitzwilliam Museum.

Rothschild inherited his title at the age of 26 following the death of his uncle Walter Rothschild, 2nd Baron Rothschild on 27 August 1937. He sat as a peer in the House of Lords, but spoke only twice there during his life (both speeches were in 1946, one about the pasteurization of milk, and another about the situation in Palestine). In November 1945 he joined the Labour Party.

===World War II===
Rothschild was recruited to work for MI5 during World War II in roles including bomb disposal, disinformation and espionage, winning the George Medal for &quot;dangerous work in hazardous circumstances&quot;. He was the head of B1C, the &quot;explosives and sabotage section&quot;, and worked on identifying where Britain&#x27;s war effort was vulnerable to sabotage and counter German sabotage attempts. This included personally dismantling examples of German booby traps and disguised explosives.

With his assistant Theresa Clay, he ran the &quot;Fifth Column&quot; operation, which saw MI5 officer Eric Roberts masquerade as the Gestapo&#x27;s man in London in order to identify hundreds of Nazi sympathizers.

===Cold War, Shell and Think Tank===
In &quot;Who Paid the Piper?&quot; (1999), an account of CIA propaganda during the Cold War, author Frances Stonor Saunders alleges that Rothschild channelled funds to &quot;Encounter&quot;, an intellectual magazine founded in 1953 to support the &quot;non-Stalinist left&quot; to advance US foreign policy goals.

After the war, he joined the zoology department at Cambridge University from 1950 to 1970. He served as chairman of the Agricultural Research Council from 1948 to 1958 and as worldwide head of research at Royal Dutch/Shell from 1963 to 1970.

Flora Solomon claims in her autobiography that in August 1962, during a reception at the Weizmann Institute, she told Rothschild that she thought that Tomás Harris and Kim Philby were Soviet spies.

When Anthony Blunt was unmasked as a member of the Cambridge Spy ring in 1964, Rothschild was questioned by Special Branch (though Blunt was not publicly identified as a Soviet agent until 1979 in the House of Commons by Prime Minister Margaret Thatcher). Rothschild was cleared and continued working on projects for the British government.

Rothschild was head of the Central Policy Review Staff from 1971 to 1974 (known popularly as &quot;The Think Tank&quot;) a staff which researched policy specifically for the Government until Margaret Thatcher abolished it.

In 1971 Rothschild was awarded an honorary degree from Tel Aviv University for &quot;the advancement of science, education and the economy of Israel&quot;. It was followed in 1975 by an honorary degree from Jerusalem&#x27;s Hebrew University. The annual &quot;Victor Rothschild Memorial Symposia&quot; is named after Rothschild.

=== Thatcher years and &quot;Spycatcher&quot; ===
In the 1980s, Rothschild joined the family bank as chairman in an effort to quell the feuding between factions led by Evelyn Rothschild and Victor&#x27;s son, Jacob Rothschild. In this, he was unsuccessful as Jacob resigned from the bank to found J. Rothschild Assurance Group (a separate entity, now St. James&#x27;s Place plc).

In 1982 he published &quot;An Enquiry into the Social Science Research Council&quot; at the behest of Sir Keith Joseph, a Conservative minister and mentor of Margaret Thatcher.

He continued to work in security as an adviser to Margaret Thatcher.

He appears several times in the book &quot;Spycatcher&quot;, which he hoped would clear the air over suspicions about his wartime role and the possibility he was involved in the Cambridge spy ring. In early 1987 Tam Dalyell MP used parliamentary privilege to suggest Rothschild should be prosecuted for a chain of events he had &quot;set in train, with Peter Wright and Harry Chapman Pincher&quot; which had led to a &quot;breach of confidence in relation to information on matters of state security given to authors&quot;.

He was still able to enter the premises of MI5 as a former employee and was aware of suspicions there was a &quot;mole&quot; in MI5, but felt himself above suspicion. While Edward Heath was Prime Minister, Rothschild was a frequent visitor to Chequers, the Prime Minister&#x27;s country residence. Throughout Rothschild&#x27;s life, he was a valued adviser on intelligence and science to both Conservative and Labour Governments.

In his 1994 book &quot;The Fifth Man&quot;, Australian author Roland Perry asserted that in 1993, after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, six retired KGB colonels, including Yuri Modin, the spy ring&#x27;s handler, alleged Rothschild was the so-called &quot;Fifth Man&quot;: &quot;Rothschild was the key to most of the Cambridge ring&#x27;s penetration of British intelligence. &quot;He had the contacts&quot;, Modin noted. &quot;He was able to introduce Burgess, Blunt and others to important figures in Intelligence such as Stewart Menzies, Dick White and Robert Vansittart in the Foreign Office ... who controlled MI6.&quot; However this suggestion is rebutted by other researchers; commentator Sheila Kerr pointed out that as soon as the book came out, Modin denied Perry&#x27;s version of their discussions (having already stated that the fifth man was Cairncross), and concluded that &quot;Perry&#x27;s case against Rothschild is unconvincing because of dubious sources and slack methods&quot;. Noel Annan, who was criticised by the author Perry for a negative view of the latter&#x27;s book and claims, writes: &quot;Amid clouds of misstatements he [Perry] relies almost wholly on insinuation and bluster. ... when Andrew Boyle published his book and exposed Blunt, why did Margaret Thatcher acknowledge in the House of Commons the truth about Blunt, but later, in the case of Rothschild, clear him? Mr. Perry is saying she lied to the House. He tries to make much of her curt statement, &quot;I am advised that we have no evidence that he was ever a Soviet spy.&quot; It is the only official reply she could have made. In MI5 jargon there was &quot;No Trace&quot; against his name&quot;. Christopher Andrew and Vasili Mitrokhin, in &quot;The Mitrokhin Archives&quot;, make no mention of Rothschild as a Soviet agent and instead identify John Cairncross as the Fifth Man.

Former KGB controller Yuri Modin denied ever having named Rothschild as &quot;any kind of Soviet agent&quot;. &quot;Because he was in MI5 they learned things from him. This doesn&#x27;t make him the fifth man, and he wasn&#x27;t,&quot; Modin wrote. His own book&#x27;s title clarifies the name of all five of the Cambridge spy group: &quot;My Five Cambridge Friends: Burgess, Maclean, Philby, Blunt, and Cairncross by Their KGB Controller&quot;. Since Rothschild had died prior to the publication of the Perry book, the family was unable to start a libel action.

Rothschild published two volumes of memoirs, &quot;Meditations of a Broomstick&quot; (1977) and &quot;Random Variables&quot; (1984).

Despite being an opposition Labour party peer, in 1987, during the Thatcher Government, Rothschild played a role in the sacking of Director-General of the BBC Alasdair Milne, who had backed the programmes &quot;Secret Society&quot;, &quot;Real Lives&quot;, and &quot;Panorama&quot;: &quot;Maggie&#x27;s Militant Tendency&quot; which had angered the Thatcher government. Marmaduke Hussey, who was Chairman of the BBC Board of Governors at the time, implied Rothschild initiated the Milne sacking in his autobiography &quot;Chance Governs All&quot;.

Rothschild took the step of publishing a letter in British newspapers on 3 December 1986 to state &quot;I am not, and never have been, a Soviet agent&quot;.

He was an advisor to William Waldegrave during the design of the Community Charge, which led to the Poll Tax Riots.

==Family==
In 1933, he married Barbara Judith Hutchinson (1911–1989). They had three children.
* Sarah Rothschild (born 1934)
* Jacob Rothschild (1936–2024), later 4th Baron Rothschild
* Miranda Rothschild (born 1940)

In 1946, he married Teresa Georgina Mayor (1915–1996), who had worked as his assistant at MI5. Mayor&#x27;s maternal grandfather was Robert John Grote Mayor, the brother of English novelist F. M. Mayor and a great-nephew of philosopher and clergyman John Grote. Her maternal grandmother, Katherine Beatrice Meinertzhagen, was the sister of soldier Richard Meinertzhagen and the niece of author Beatrice Webb. They had four children:
* Emma Rothschild (born 1948), married the Bengali Hindu economist Amartya Kumar Sen (b. 1933) in 1991.
* Benjamin Mayer Rothschild (born and died 1952).
* Victoria Katherine Rothschild (born 1953), an academic lecturer at Queen Mary, University of London, and the second wife and widow of English writer Simon Gray (1936–2008).
* Amschel Rothschild (1955–1996), married to Anita Patience Guinness of the Anglo-Irish Protestant Guinness family. He died by suicide in 1996. They had three children; Kate Emma Rothschild Goldsmith (b. 1982), Alice Miranda Rothschild (b. 1983) and James Amschel Victor Rothschild (b. 1985)

Born into a nominally Jewish family, in adult life Rothschild declared himself to be an atheist. However, after his death, from a heart attack in London on 20 March 1990, his body was interred in the historic Jewish Brady Street Cemetery, which remarkably saved that cemetery from proposed redevelopment for 100 years. His sister Miriam Louisa Rothschild was a distinguished entomologist, and his sister Nica de Koenigswarter was a bebop jazz enthusiast and patron of Thelonious Monk and Charlie Parker.

<text>The purple finch (Haemorhous purpureus) is a bird in the finch family, Fringillidae. It breeds in the northern United States, southern Canada, and the west coast of North America. 

==Taxonomy==
The purple finch was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the finches in the genus &quot;Fringilla&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Fringilla purpurea&quot;. Gmelin specified the locality as Carolina. Gmelin based his account on the &quot;purple finch&quot; that had been described and illustrated by the English naturalist Mark Catesby in his book &quot;The Natural History of Carolina, Florida and the Bahama Islands&quot;. The purple finch is now one of three finches placed in the genus &quot;Haemorhous&quot; that was introduced in 1837 by the English naturalist William Swainson.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;H. p. purpureus&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – central south, southeast Canada and northeast USA
* &quot;H. p. californicus&quot; (Baird, SF, 1858) – southwest Canada and west USA

This species and the other &quot;American rosefinches&quot; were formerly included with the rosefinches of Eurasia in the genus &quot;Carpodacus&quot;; however, the three North American species are not closely related to the rosefinches of the Old World, and have thus been moved to the genus &quot;Haemorhous&quot;.

==Description==
The purple finch is in overall length and weighs a mean 23.3 g (0.82 oz), ranging from 19.8–28.4 g (0.7 - 1.0 oz). It has a short forked brown tail and brown wings. Adult males are raspberry red on the head, breast, back and rump; their back is streaked. Adult females have light brown upperparts and white underparts with dark brown streaks throughout; they have a white line on the face above the eye.

The subspecies &quot;H. p. californicus&quot; differs from the nominate in having a longer tail and shorter wings. The plumage of both males and females is darker, and the coloration of the females is more greenish. It also has a longer bill.

==Distribution and habitat==
Their breeding habitat is coniferous and mixed forest in Canada and the northeastern United States, as well as various wooded areas along the U.S. Pacific coast.

Birds from northern Canada migrate to the southern United States; other birds are permanent residents.

The purple finch population has been displaced from some breeding season habitats in the Eastern United States following the introduction of the house finch, which is native to the western U.S. and Mexico. The two species share a similar niche, with the house finch often outcompeting the purple finch during the summer.

==Behavior==
===Food and feeding===
These birds forage in trees and bushes, sometimes in ground vegetation. They mainly eat seeds, berries, and insects. They are fond of sunflower seeds, millet, and thistle.

===Breeding===
The purple finch prefers nesting in lowland coniferous and mixed forests, avoiding more heavily populated urban areas, but sometimes found in rural residential areas. The female Purple Finch usually builds her nest on horizontal branches of coniferous trees, away from the trunk, but occasionally in tree forks. The nest is shaped like an open cup, made up of rootlets, twigs, and weeds, and lined with grass, hair, and moss.

==Cultural depictions==
The purple finch was designated the state bird of New Hampshire in 1957. The New Hampshire red hen (breed of domestic chicken) was also proposed, but was not chosen in favor of the purple finch. In 1763, Richard Brookes made the description of the female purple finch in Mexico with the name of &quot;chiantototl&quot; (chia seed bird).

<doc id="368433" wikidata="Q279000" url="?curid=368433" title="South Shields">
<text>South Shields () is a coastal town in South Tyneside, Tyne and Wear, England; it is on the south bank of the mouth of the River Tyne. The town was once known in Roman times as &quot;Arbeia&quot; and as &quot;Caer Urfa&quot; by the Early Middle Ages. In 2021 it had a population of 75,337. It is the fourth largest settlement in Tyne and Wear, after Newcastle upon Tyne, Sunderland and Gateshead.

Historically within the county of Durham, South Shields is south of North Shields and Tynemouth across the River Tyne; and east of Newcastle upon Tyne and Jarrow.

==History==

Evidence of human inhabitation at South Shields dates from the Late Mesolithic. The first evidence of a settlement within what is now the town of South Shields dates from pre-historic times. Stone Age arrow heads and an Iron Age round house have been discovered on the site of Arbeia Roman Fort. The Roman garrison built a fort here around AD 160 and expanded it around AD 208 to help supply their soldiers along Hadrian&#x27;s Wall as they campaigned north beyond the Antonine Wall. Divisions living at the fort included Tigris bargemen (from Persia and modern day Iraq), infantry from Iberia and Gaul, and Syrian archers and spearmen. The fort was abandoned as the Roman Empire declined in the fourth century AD. Many ruins still exist today and some structures have been rebuilt as part of a modern museum and popular tourist attraction.

There is evidence that the site was used in the early post-Roman period as a British settlement. It is believed it became a royal residence of King Osric of Deira; records show that his son Oswin was born within &#x27;Caer Urfa&#x27;, by which name the fort is thought to be known after the Romans left. Furthermore, Bede records Oswin giving a parcel of land to St Hilda for the foundation of a monastery here in ; the present-day church of St Hilda, by the Market Place, is said to stand on the monastic site.
In the ninth century, Scandinavian peoples made Viking raids on monasteries and settlements all along the coast, and later conquered the Anglian Kingdoms of Northumbria, Mercia and East Anglia, who hailed from Angelnen in Denmark (modern day Germany). It is said in local folklore that a Viking ship was wrecked at Herd Sands in South Shields in its attempts to disembark at a cove nearby. Other Viking ships were uncovered in South Shields Denmark Centre and nearby Jarrow.

The current town was founded in 1245 and developed as a fishing port. The name South Shields developed from the &#x27;Schele&#x27; or &#x27;Shield&#x27;, which was a small dwelling used by fishermen. Another industry that was introduced, was that of salt-panning, later expanded upon in the 15th century, polluting the air and surrounding land. In 1864, a Tyne Commissioners dredger brought up a nine-pounder breech-loading cannon; more cannonballs have been found in the sands beside the Lawe; these artifacts belonged to the English civil war. At the outbreak of the war in 1642, the North, West and Ireland supported the King; the South East and Presbyterian Scotland supported Parliament. In 1644 Parliament&#x27;s Scottish Covenanter allies, in a lengthy battle, seized the town and its Royalist fortification, the fortification was close to the site of the original Roman fort. They also seized the town of Newburn. These raids were done to aid their ongoing siege of the heavily fortified Newcastle upon Tyne, and in a bid to control the River Tyne, and the North, and the Shields siege helped cause their battalions to maneuver south to York; this may have also led to a brief winter skirmish on the outskirts of Boldon, though the topography is not favourable for a battle.

In the 19th century, coal mining, alkaline production and glass making led to a boom in the town. The population increased from 12,000 in 1801 to 75,000 by the 1860s, bolstered by economic migration from Ireland, Scotland and other parts of England. These industries played a fundamental part in creating wealth both regionally and nationally. In 1832, with the Great Reform Act, South Shields and Gateshead were each given their own Member of Parliament and became boroughs, resulting in taxes being paid to the Government instead of the Bishops of Durham. However, the rapid growth in population brought on by the expansion of industry made sanitation a problem, as evident by Cholera outbreaks and the building of the now-listed Cleadon Water Tower to combat the problem. In the 1850s &#x27;The Tyne Improvement Commission&#x27; began to develop the river, dredging it to make it deeper and building the large, impressive North and South Piers to help prevent silt build up within the channel. Shipbuilding (along with coal mining), previously a monopoly of the Freemen of Newcastle, became another prominent industry in the town, with John Readhead &amp; Sons Shipyard the largest.

During World War I, German Zeppelin airships bombed South Shields in 1916. Later during World War II, the German Luftwaffe repeatedly attacked the town and caused massive damage to industries which supported the war effort, killing many innocent residents. Particularly, a bomb shelter in the market place of South Shields, where the deceased were commemorated in a cobblestone of the British flag. Later controversially removed and the bodies interred elsewhere. Gradually throughout the late 20th century, the coal and shipbuilding industries were closed, due to competitive pressures from more cost-effective sources of energy (including workers) and more efficient shipbuilding elsewhere in Eastern Europe (e.g. Poland) and in South East Asia. In the 21st century, the local economy primarily includes port-related, ship repair and offshore industries, manufacturing, retail (nearby Newcastle, Durham, Washington and Sunderland), the public sector and the ever-increasing role of tourism. This is illustrated by the new multi-million Haven centre, Dunes centre and seaside improvements in the coastal area and a new multimillion-pound library The Word.

==Geography==
South Shields is situated in a peninsula setting, where the River Tyne meets the North Sea. It has six miles of coastline and three miles of river frontage, dominated by the massive North and South Piers at the mouth of the Tyne. These are best viewed from the Lawe Top, which also houses two replicas of cannon captured from the Russians during the Crimean War, the originals having been melted down during World War II.

The town slopes gently from Cleadon Hills down to the river. Cleadon Hills are made conspicuous by the Victorian Cleadon Water Tower and pumping station (opened in 1860 to improve sanitation) and a now derelict windmill, both of which are listed and can be seen from many miles away and also out at sea.

South Shields boasts extensive beaches, sand dunes and coves, as well as dramatic Magnesian Limestone cliffs with grassy areas above known as The Leas, which cover three miles of the coastline and are a National Trust protected area. Marsden Bay, with its famous Marsden Rock and historic Grotto public house and restaurant set in the cliffs, is home to one of the largest seabird colonies in Britain.

One of the most historic parts of the town is the quaint and beautiful Westoe village, which consists of a quiet street of first grade and second grade Georgian and Victorian houses, many of which had been built by business leaders from the coal and shipping industries in the town. Given its beautiful setting, parks and trees, this street was often the setting for a number of books by the novelist Catherine Cookson. Westoe village was once a separate village about a mile from South Shields, but urban sprawl has now consumed it, along with the village of Harton to the south on the main route towards Cleadon and Sunderland.

===Climate===
Climate in this area has mild differences between highs and lows, and there is adequate rainfall year-round. The Köppen Climate Classification subtype for this climate is &quot;Cfb&quot; (Marine West Coast Climate/Oceanic climate).
==Demographics==

Before 1820, South Shields was a predominantly sparse hamlet- and village-based rural economy with some small-scale shipbuilding, glass making and salt processing along the riverside. Beyond 1820 and into the Industrial Revolution, South Shields expanded into an urban settlement built around shipbuilding and coal mining. Migration came from up the River Tyne, with other migrants from rural County Durham, Northumberland, Scotland and Ireland. The majority of the people living in South Shields are descendants of those who migrated and settled in the area during the Industrial Revolution in order to work in expanding coalmines and shipyards. Towards the end of the 19th century, with the British Navy needing seamen, Yemeni British sailors settled in the town, this resulted in the first roots of the Yemeni British community in the town.
In South Shields, 6.7% of the population are from an ethnic minority (non white British), compared with 5.0% in the surrounding borough of South Tyneside. Most of the Asians in South Shields are Bangladeshi, with the Beacon and Bents ward that covers South Shields town centre, had 9.9% of the population registering as that ethnicity. The Bangladeshi community is the third largest in Tyne and Wear, after Newcastle upon Tyne and Sunderland with 1.7% of the town&#x27;s population being Bangladeshi or 1300 people. Nearly all of the ethnic minority population in South Tyneside is concentrated in South Shields town centre and suburban areas immediately to the south such as Rekendyke and Westoe. There are hardly any in Jarrow, Hebburn which are the other two major areas in the borough. The population of the South Tyneside Metropolitan borough had decreased from 152,785 in 2001, to 148,127 in 2011. In 2001, the population of South Shields was 82,854. Population data from the 2011 United Kingdom Census return classifies South Shields as a medium-sized coastal town.

===Yemeni community===
South Shields has been home to a Yemeni British community since the 1890s. The main reason for the Yemeni arrival was the supply of seamen, such as engine room firemen, to British merchant vessels. Similar communities were founded in Hull, Liverpool and Cardiff. In 1909, the first Arab Seamen&#x27;s Boarding House opened in the Holborn riverside district of the town. At the time of the First World War there was a shortage of crews due to the demands of the fighting and many Yemenis were recruited to serve on British ships at the port of Aden, then a British protectorate. At the end of the war, the Yemeni population of South Shields had risen to over 3,000. Shields lost one of the largest proportions of Merchant Navy sailors. Approximately 1 in 4 of these men was of Yemeni background. The port in South Shields employed men of Yemeni, Aden, Somali, African, Indian and Malaysian nationalities.

Disputes over jobs led to race riots – also called the Arab Riots – in 1919 and 1930. However, over time, attitudes to Yemenis in the town were softened and there was no significant recurrence of this violence.

After World War II, the Yemeni population declined, partly due to migrations to other industrial areas such as Birmingham, Liverpool and Sheffield. However, the main reason for the reduction in numbers was the end of the shipping industry and the need for sailors as coal-burning ships decreased in numbers. Today, the Yemeni population of South Shields numbers around 1,000. Many Yemeni sailors married local women and became integrated with the wider community, resulting with a migrant population less distinct than in other mixed communities across the UK. The Yemeni are the first, settled Muslim community in Britain.

There is a mosque at Laygate, including the Yemeni School, which was visited by American boxer Muhammad Ali in 1977. He had his marriage blessed at the Al-Azhar Mosque, one of the earliest mosques in UK. This story is covered in a documentary film, &quot;The King of South Shields&quot;. Throughout April and early May 2008, the BALTIC Arts Centre in Gateshead chronicled the Yemeni community of South Shields, including interviews with the last remaining survivors of the first Yemeni generation. The exhibition depicted the Yemeni story as an example of early successful multi-cultural integration in Britain, as well as showcasing the high-profile 1977 visit by Muhammad Ali.

In 2005, the Customs House commissioned author Peter Mortimer to write a play on the subject of the 1930 Yemeni Riot. The resultant play RIOT was staged at the venue in 2005 and 2008.

In 2008, South Shields resident and filmmaker Tina Gharavi unveiled plans for a plaque to mark Ali&#x27;s visit.

In 2008, a critically acclaimed exhibition about the South Shields Yemeni community was held entitled &quot;The Last of the Dictionary Men – Stories from South Shields&#x27; Yemeni Sailors&quot;, was held at the Baltic Centre for Contemporary Art, Gateshead.

In 2009, the detective series George Gently, based on the novels by Alan Hunter, portrayed the Yemeni integration in a 1960s setting.

===Bangladeshi community===
The Bangladeshi community is actually larger than the Yemeni community. However, Yemenis have been in South Shields a lot longer. The Bangladeshi community is the third largest in the North East of England.

In 2008, the Bangladesh Welfare Association was opened in South Shields.

==Economy==

The last shipbuilder, John Readhead &amp; Sons, closed in 1984 and the last pit, Westoe Colliery, closed in 1993. Today, the town relies largely on service industries, whilst many residents commute to work in nearby Newcastle, Gateshead, North Tyneside and Sunderland.

Despite a skilled local workforce, for many years South Tyneside had the highest unemployment rate in mainland Britain, although between December 2002 and December 2008 unemployment in South Shields fell by 17.8%, and that of South Tyneside by 17.7%, the best performance in the North East region over that time period.

In January 2011, the Guardian reported the unemployment rate at 6.5%, and at 7.5% in October 2011.

The Port of Tyne is one of the UK&#x27;s most important and is further developing its freight and passenger activities. In 2007, it imported two million tonnes of coal. Manufacturing and ship repair/engineering are other significant sectors.

South Shields benefits from significant public and private sector investment. More recently this has included primarily the town centre, riverside and foreshore areas, given the decline of once-traditional heavy industries with the town&#x27;s growing importance as a major commercial centre and tourist destination.

===Tourism===

The town is a popular seaside resort with multiple landmarks and tourist attractions. As with other resorts tourism is a large part of the town&#x27;s economy: to attract tourists the town has an extensive network of cycle paths and walking trails; a promenade; parks-and-gardens; fairground rides; amusement arcades, crazy golf, laser tag, a miniature steam railway; boating lake; a ten-pin bowling centre and an amphitheatre.

===Leisure and entertainment===
There is a good choice of restaurants, cafes, public houses and nightlife as well as hotels, guest houses and caravan parks in and around the town.

South Shields plays host to an annual free summer festival and each autumn the town is the seaside finish to the week as well as public gala shows at the Customs House. During the week is the Magic Convention – 3 days of lectures and shows by the world&#x27;s best magicians.

==Landmark==
A notable landmark in the town is the reconstructed Roman fort and excavations of the ancient Arbeia Roman Castra. This form part of the Hadrian&#x27;s Wall World Heritage Site. South Shields is also home of the oldest provincial newspaper in the UK, the &quot;Shields Gazette&quot;.

The town&#x27;s museum &amp; art gallery, includes a permanent exhibition dedicated to the life and times of Catherine Cookson. From 1985 to 2009 the area marketed itself as &quot;Catherine Cookson Country&quot;, which attracted many visitors.

They are a number of trade related landmarks: this includes the headquarters, warehouse and factory of the fashion company Barbour; the Customs House theatre and arts venue and the historic Mill Dam riverside. The town hosts traditional, continental and farmers&#x27; markets and has high street of shops.

Geographical landmarks include The Leas cliff tops and Haven Point as well as the bays of Littlehaven, Sandhaven and Marsden.

Notable buildings in and around the town include:
* St Hilda&#x27;s Church, thought to be built on the site of Hilda&#x27;s seventh-century chapel
* The combined Jubilee Clocktower and Wouldhave Memorial, which stands on Pier Parade alongside &quot;Tyne&quot;, Britain&#x27;s second-oldest preserved lifeboat.
* the National Trust-owned Souter Lighthouse.

===Lighthouses and pier===

Work on the North and South Tyne Piers was begun in 1854 by the newly formed Tyne Improvement Commission, for the protection of shipping entering and leaving the river. The principal architect and engineer was James Walker, until his death in 1862 (whereupon John F. Ure took over). Construction was delayed by storm damage in 1862, which led to parts of the foundations having to be rebuilt. The South Pier was finished in 1895 and its lighthouse was operational that same year (it was equipped with a third-order fixed optic and a clockwork occulting mechanism, by Chance Brothers &amp; Co.). The lighthouse currently displays an occulting sector light with white, red and green sectors; the green sector is used to indicate safe waters near the coast to the north of Tynemouth, while red indicates an area with numerous wrecks to the east and south of the lighthouse. The pier is long (accessible from South Shields seafront, it is open to the public except in bad weather).

It was originally intended that the North (Tynemouth) Pier and lighthouse would mirror their South Shields counterparts, but a series of breaches and collapses meant that the North Pier was completed much later and to a different design. Following completion of the North Pier, in January 1908 the South Pier Lighthouse was provided with a bell, which sounded once every thirty seconds during foggy weather (in contrast to the reed fog horn sounded from the North Pier light).

On 20 October 2023, Storm Babet hit the North East Coast with high winds. The South Pier Lighthouse lost its dome due to waves breaching the pier wall.

There is a third lighthouse, just upstream of the pier, on the Herd Groyne at South Shields (which was constructed in 1861–67 to preserve Littlehaven Beach, then known as Herd Sands, which had begun to be washed away by the change of currents caused by the new piers). This very unusual lighthouse resembling a 1940s sci-fi movie space craft was built by Newcastle-upon-Tyne Trinity House in 1882 (ownership was passed to the Tyne Improvement Commission the following year). It consists of an upper hexagonal part (including the lantern) of wood and corrugated iron construction, sitting on twelve cylindrical steel legs. The whole structure is painted red and stands in height. The Groyne shows an occulting light which marks a safe entrance course between the piers, showing white to a vessel approaching from seaward on the correct course, green to a vessel off-course to the north, and red to one off-course to the south.

In 1928, both the South Pier and the Groyne lights were converted from incandescent gas to automatic electric operation. They were run off mains electricity (the gas lights being retained as an emergency standby). At the same time each lighthouse was equipped with an electrically activated fog bell; these were switched on and off remotely from a control hut in the pier blockyard. In the event of a power cut, each bell was designed to keep ringing for a further six hours. In 1961 the Commissioners installed a groundbreaking system by which the two fog bells would be switched on and off by the keepers on duty in the Tynemouth Pier lighthouse, using an &#x27;infra-red ray&#x27; beamed across the river. This was in turn replaced by a radio link to an automatic fog detector when the latter lighthouse was automated in 1967. At the same time the South Shields lights were themselves fully automated, with the addition of standby diesel alternators and automatic lamp changers.

In 1999, the white sector of the light was intensified by the addition of a PEL sector light above the optic, with the same occulting characteristic but a range of 19 nautical miles (rather than 13, as previously). The installation of this powerful light (which is visible during the day as well as by night), rendered the High and Low Lights of North Shields redundant, and they were therefore decommissioned at the same time. The Herd Groyne lighthouse was refurbished and repainted in 2014, and still acts as a navigational aid to ships entering the River Tyne. In 2015 it was stated that the fog bells on the two lighthouses were no longer operational.

===Town halls===
A prominent landmark is South Shields Town Hall, built 1905–1910, a sumptuous building &quot;the most convincing expression in the county of Edwardian prosperity&quot;. The architect was E. E. Fetch of London. Ornamentation includes several references to the town&#x27;s nautical heritage: Britannia and other sculpted figures in the pediment above the front entrance, a figure of Mercury atop a globe on the dome of the Council chamber, fountains and nymph lampholders in the forecourt alongside a statue of Queen Victoria. The 145-foot clock tower contains a Potts chiming clock and five bells, and is topped by a weathervane in the shape of a galleon.

The Old Town Hall, a square building of 1768, provides the centrepiece of the Market Place and closes the vista along King Street. The ground floor is open with arches on each side (and a central pillar which predates the rest of the structure); the enclosed first floor has pitched roof, topped by a wooden bell turret. Originally built and used by the Dean and Chapter of Durham, it was sold by them to the town Corporation in 1855.

==Education==

South Shields is home to South Tyneside College, one of the two leading maritime training centres in the UK, with facilities including a marine safety training centre and a simulated ship&#x27;s bridge for the training of deck officers. The college was also home to the only planetarium in the region, and to an observatory; and in its time was a popular visitor attraction for local schools and visitors in general. The observatory was used for 20 years and in 2008 it was deemed redundant to the future curriculum needs of the college. The domed room that housed the planetarium is now a mosque. The college provides a wide range of other flexible vocational and training courses.

Local schooling is generally regarded as being very good, which is reflected in continuing improvements to school results and independent inspections.

In 2007, Brinkburn Comprehensive and King George V Comprehensive merged forming South Shields Community School. The new school was built at a cost of £19 million on the King George V School site and was opened in September 2011. However this school closed in 2020.

St Mary&#x27;s C of E Primary School was a Christian voluntary aided school educating children aged 3–11 located in South Shields. The school was founded in 1867 to provide education for the children of the labouring and manufacturing and poorer classes, with regard to the principles of the established church of the same name which was affiliated with the school. This school closed July 2008. Demolition of the school began early October 2016 and was finalised late November 2016.

==Regional identity==
People born in South Shields are considered to be Geordies, a term commonly associated with all residents of Tyneside.

A less commonly used colloquial term is Sandancer. It is presumed to originate from the town&#x27;s beach and history.

==Sport==
===Football===
South Shields F.C. is the town&#x27;s main football team. Originally formed during the first decade of the 20th century, the team played in the Football League during the 1920s. The club recently shot to fame with a run to win the FA Vase in 2017. The side currently play in the National League North after winning promotion to it in 2023, the sixth tier of English Football. They also have a women&#x27;s team who play in the fifth tier of the Women&#x27;s pyramid, the North East Regional Women&#x27;s League Premier Division.

Recently, the town were also represented by Harton &amp; Westoe C.W. They played their games at the Harton &amp; Westoe Miners Welfare near Whiteleas and spent the majority of their existence in the Wearside League before going out of existence in 2019.

===Rugby===
South Shields is the home of two rugby union clubs, South Shields RFC and Westoe RFC.

South Shields RFC have been playing at Grosvenor Road, South Tyneside College since they were formed in 1956. They currently play in the Durham &amp; Northumberland 3rd Division, the ninth tier of the English rugby union pyramid

Westoe RFC (now called South Shields Westoe), formed in 1875, still play at their original ground, Wood Terrace. In 2005 they had an Intermediate Cup run and got to Twickenham but were beaten by Morley R.F.C. from Yorkshire. They rose to the fourth tier National League Two. They now play in rugby&#x27;s seventh Tier, the Durham &amp; Northumberland 1st Division.

For two seasons 1902–03 and 1903–04 the town also had a semi-professional rugby league club, South Shields who played at Horsley Hill while the club competed on the second division of the Northern Union. The club was voted out of the league at the end of their second season and the club disbanded shortly afterwards.

==Politics==
South Shields is a safe Labour Party Parliamentary seat, the only constituency in existence since the Great Reform Act of 1832 never to have elected a Conservative MP. It is currently held by Emma Lewell-Buck, who won the seat in a by-election held on 3 May 2013 which had been triggered by the retirement from politics of the previous incumbent David Miliband, who had served as Foreign Secretary in the government of Gordon Brown. Previous incumbents of the constituency&#x27;s seat include former cabinet ministers David Clark and Chuter Ede; the latter was Home Secretary in Clement Attlee&#x27;s post-war government for 6 years.

The local authority, South Tyneside Metropolitan Borough Council, is also controlled by Labour.

The town has a local independent political party, the Progressive Party. This broadly centre-right party was formed in the 1950s to address hostility towards the Conservative Party. The Progressives have no representation beyond South Shields. The party controlled the old County borough of South Shields council until 1974.

==Transport==

South Shields is bounded by the A19 trunk road to the West and situated close to the Tyne Tunnel at Jarrow. The town is well connected to other areas of Tyne &amp; Wear and to the strategic road network – the A194(M) motorway provides a direct link between the Borough and the A1/A1(M).

The Tyne and Wear Metro light rail system was introduced in the 1980s and replaced British Rail services over the same route. The Metro network serves South Tyneside, Gateshead, Newcastle, North Tyneside, Sunderland and Newcastle Airport. The platform at the former South Shields Metro station is situated on a bridge directly above King Street – the town&#x27;s main shopping area. When Metro services were introduced, the railway line at the former High Shields LNER station at Laygate was re-routed eastwards to the then-new Chichester Metro and bus interchange. The former South Shields LNER station was also closed and the Victorian buildings survived as a secondary entrance to the Metro station until they were demolished in 1998. As well as in South Shields town centre and in Chichester, there are other Metro stations at Tyne Dock, Simonside and Brockley Whins. Long-term plans by Nexus to re-open the former Sunderland to South Shields line between Tyne Dock, Brockley Whins and East Boldon would create a direct rail service between South Shields and Sunderland, without the need for passengers to change trains at Pelaw in Gateshead. Nexus also plans to open two new stations at Harton and Cleadon, raising the number of metro stations within the town from four to six. There are no railway stations within the town (stations operated by National Rail) or in the surrounding borough. The new integrated bus and Metro interchange opened on 4 August 2019 on Keppel Street - across the road from the original Metro station at King Street - on the site of the former head post office and Royal Mail delivery office.

There is a frequent pedestrian ferry service to North Shields on the opposite bank of the Tyne. The Shields Ferry carries tens of thousands of commuters and pleasure trippers each year. There has been a cross-river ferry service between the two towns since 1377.

The Port of Tyne headquarters and international freight terminal are located at Tyne Dock in South Shields. The Port has a freight rail connection.

Local bus routes are operated by Stagecoach North East and Go North East, which are planned to integrate with Metro services.

There is a National Express coach service direct to London.

The town&#x27;s extensive network of strategic footpaths and cycle routes includes the Sea to Sea Cycle Route and National Cycle Route 1.

<text>Whitley Bay is a seaside town in the North Tyneside borough in Tyne and Wear, England. It was formerly governed as part of Northumberland and has been part of Tyne and Wear since 1974. It is part of the wider Tyneside built-up area, being around east of Newcastle upon Tyne. Two notable landmarks are the Spanish City (a domed building on the seafront) and St Mary&#x27;s Lighthouse, the latter on a small island near the town.

==History==

=== Early history ===
Whitley was first mentioned around 1100 when King Henry I conferred it with other possessions on the Priory of Tynemouth being referred to in ancient documents and maps before that date as Witelei, Wyteley, Hwyteleg, Witelithe, Wheteley, Wytheleye, Whitlaw, Whitlathe and Whitlag. Whitley is also referred to in the charters of King Henry II, King Richard I and King John, confirming to the priors their possessions and liberties.

Whitley was connected with the Crusades when Pope Nicholas IV granted to Edward I the first-fruits and tenths of all ecclesiastical possessions for six years to defray the expenses of an expedition to the Holy Land. A valuation was made of the spiritual and temporal goods of the Priory on 26 March 1292, when the yearly rents from Whitley were returned as 20 shillings, and the tithes as 9 marks.

About the beginning of the 14th century, the manor of Whitley was held from the Prior of Tynemouth by a singular feudal service called the Conveyes which seems to have originated from John de Whitley. Richard de Emeldon, eighteen times Mayor of Newcastle and seven times its representative in Parliament, was the Lord of the Manor of Whitley in 1333.

On 9 April 1345, Edward III granted Gilbert de Whitley a licence to crenellate his manor house at Whitley. To crenellate a house was to place battlements on it. Before this could be done, the sanction of the Crown was often sought. Although battlements were often largely symbolic, in this instance it is probably an indication of the degree of insecurity felt even this far south during the Edwardian wars with Scotland. The licence and crenellations were an indication of status. Only 2% of the small tower houses of the sort Gilbert built had licences. The &#x27;sanction&#x27; of the crown was a sought-after bonus, but not a requirement.

After the Dissolution of the Monasteries, Whitley was held under the Crown for a time. By a grant of Edward VI dated 8 December 1551, it came into the hands of Dudley, Earl of Warwick who was created Duke of Northumberland. It remained in the Percy family until 1632 after which time the area appeared to be let at a yearly rental to various holders until it came into the possession of the Duke of Somerset on his marriage in 1682 with Elizabeth, the heiress of Joscelyn, the 11th Earl of Northumberland. Whitley subsequently passed by inheritance to her granddaughter Elizabeth Seymour who had married Sir Hugh Smithson, a Yorkshire baronet, afterwards created Duke of Northumberland. Whitley has since been retained by descendants and the present Duke of Northumberland is the Lord of the Manor and principal landowner.

Monkseaton, which forms the greater part of the north west of the district, is also very old and its industries were common with those of Whitley being chiefly coalmining and limestone quarrying.

===19th century to present===

From the late 19th century and into the 20th century, the adverse effects of the decline of local coal mining and dependent industries in the area were ameliorated by the emergence of Whitley as a seaside holiday resort. The opening of the North Tyne Loop railway line in 1882, connecting the coastal villages to Newcastle, benefited the tourism industry. The line, now followed by the present Metro system, included a new railway station in the centre of the town, and another at Monkseaton. Both stations remain in use as Metro stations. Whitley Bay remains a popular holiday resort, with a caravan park operated by Parkdean Resorts for both holidaymakers and holiday home owners.

The parish church is St. Paul&#x27;s Church. It was provided by the Duke of Northumberland when the parish of Tynemouth was divided in 1860 and it was consecrated in 1864.

The Whitley and Monkseaton Local Board was established in 1873. The district of the Local Board became the Urban District of Whitley and Monkseaton.

The town was known as Whitley until the 1890s, by which time confusion with Whitby, in North Yorkshire, regularly caused mail to be misdirected. The final straw came in September 1901 when a former resident died in Edinburgh and his body was to be buried in St Paul&#x27;s churchyard, Whitley. Unfortunately, the body was mistakenly transported to Whitby, thereby delaying the funeral. When the council asked residents for suggestions of a new name, the most popular choice was Whitley Bay. Though since known officially as Whitley Bay, many residents still refer to the town as &#x27;Whitley&#x27;.
On 1 January 1944, the Whitley and Monkseaton Urban District became the Whitley Bay Urban District and on 5 March 1954 it was granted a Royal Charter of Incorporation as the Borough of Whitley Bay. The charter was presented by The Princess Royal at a ceremony in the town on 14 April 1954.

The Local Government Act 1972 abolished the borough, with Hartley in the north of the borough becoming a part of Blyth Valley district in Northumberland, and the majority of the town including Whitley Bay and Monkseaton forming part of the Metropolitan Borough of North Tyneside in the Tyne and Wear area. The town is in the constituency of Tynemouth.
== Geography ==

Whitley Bay is around 10 miles east of Newcastle upon Tyne. It is bounded by the coastline of the North Sea to the east. Tynemouth is 3 miles south.

St Mary&#x27;s Island, a tidal island at the northern tip of the town, is the site of a lighthouse, one of the town&#x27;s landmarks. Coal seams are exposed in the cliffs next to the beach just North of St Mary&#x27;s Island and it is possible to pick up coal from the beach at low tide. The coal seams in the cliffs extend all the way to Seaton Sluice.

== Transport ==
The Tyne and Wear Metro yellow line runs through the town with , , and stations serving the town. A Metro journey to Newcastle city centre takes around 25 minutes, via South Gosforth or Wallsend.

The main bus operators in the town are Stagecoach North East, Go North East and Arriva Northumbria. Until the late 1990s, Arriva owned and operated a bus station and depot in the town. This closed in 1998, and the Park View Shopping centre sits on the site of both this, and the old Post office building.

== Media ==
The local weekly newspaper, &quot;The News Guardian&quot;, is published by Johnston Press and printed on the presses of the &quot;Sunderland Echo&quot; in nearby Sunderland. The alternative free weekly paper is the &quot;Chronicle Extra&quot;, formerly known as the &quot;Herald and Post&quot;.

== Education ==
There are two high schools in the town, Whitley Bay High School and Monkseaton High School. The town is one of the few remaining in the UK that operates on a three-tier system, with first, middle and high schools.

==Regeneration==

On 20 February 2007, North Tyneside Council announced plans to regenerate the Spanish City and Whitley Bay. At the core of the plan was the redevelopment of the Spanish City site with its iconic dome, completed in 1912. For many years it was home to a theme park with rides and attractions, until falling into decay following the closure of the theme park in 2000. The Spanish City was reopened in July 2018.

Recent civic improvements include, a skatepark opened in the Panama Dip in 2008, a children&#x27;s play park on Whitley Park in 2007, refurbishment of the swimming pool and the Playhouse both re-opened in 2009. A new library (behind the main street in the town centre) with a tourist information office, and joint service centre on the site of York Road was completed in 2013.

==Sport==

===Football===

Whitley Bay F.C. play at the town&#x27;s Hillheads Park, adjacent to the ice rink. The Hillheads stadium in the west of the town and holds approximately 4,500 spectators with 250 seats in the main stand. Now playing in the Northern League Division One, the club won the FA Vase (amateur FA Cup) in 2002, beating Tiptree United at Villa Park, Birmingham.

Whitley Bay reached the FA Vase final again in May 2009, when the club beat Glossop North End 2–0 at the new Wembley Stadium. They retained the trophy the following year by beating Wroxham 6–1 at Wembley in the final of the 2009–10 FA Vase. In May 2011 they made it an unprecedented three in a row, and four wins in total this time beating Coalville Town 3–2.

===Ice Hockey===
Whitley Bay Ice Rink is home of Whitley Warriors Ice Hockey Club. The team enjoyed success together with local rivals Durham Wasps at a national level during the 1980s and early 1990s.

===Rugby union===
Whitley Bay Rockcliff RFC play at the Lovaine Avenue ground in Hillheads. Founded in 1887 as Rockcliff RFC, and still generally known as &quot;Rockcliff&quot;, they were originally based on the seafront in the Rockcliff area of the town, prior to moving along the seafront to the site later occupied by the Spanish City. In 1907 they moved to the present site in Lovaine Avenue. The years immediately after formation and up to the First World War were the most successful in the club&#x27;s history, when they were one of the strongest sides in England, beating the world-famous Barbarians in 1892, and producing a number of international players including E.W &quot;Little Billy&quot; Taylor, who captained England in the 1890s. The introduction of the league structures in the late 1980s saw the club climb into the north east leagues in the early 1990s. The club now plays in the Durham and Northumberland Division 2.

===Speedway===
The Rockcliff ground was the home of the short-lived Dirt Track or Speedway venture in the spring of 1929. The first venue on Tyneside, it was not as popular as the sister track at Gosforth Stadium which opened early summer and was closed after only two months, when the operator Tyneside Speedways Ltd went into liquidation.

<text>Dunblane (, ) is a town in the council area of Stirling in central Scotland, and inside the historic boundaries of the county of Perthshire. It is a commuter town, with many residents making use of good transport links to much of the Central Belt, including Glasgow and Edinburgh.

Dunblane is built on the banks of the Allan Water (or River Allan), a tributary of the River Forth. Dunblane Cathedral is its most prominent landmark. Dunblane had a population of 8,114 at the 2001 census, which grew to 8,811 at the 2011 census; both of these figures were computed according to the 2010 definition of the locality. In mid-2016 it was estimated that the population had grown to 9,410.

== Origin of name ==

The most popular theory for the derivation of the name &quot;Dunblane&quot; is that it means &quot;fort of Blane&quot;, commemorating Saint Blane (or Blán in Old Irish), an early Christian saint who lived probably in the late 6th century. His main seat was originally Kingarth on the Isle of Bute. He or his followers may have founded a church at Dunblane; the cult of Blán possibly came there with settlers from what is now Argyll in later centuries.

The earliest spellings of the name Dunblane are of the form &quot;Dul Blaan&quot;, the first element being a Pictish word for &#x27;water meadow, haugh&#x27; which was borrowed into Scottish Gaelic. There are parallels to Dul Blaan in such Scottish place-names as Dalserf, Dalmarnock and Dalpatrick, all of which commemorate saints.

== History ==
The earliest evidence for Christianity on the site are two cross-slabs of the 10th to 11th centuries which are preserved in the cathedral. Incorporated into the later medieval building, but originally free-standing, is an 11th-century bell-tower, whose height was increased in the 15th century. The nave and aisleless choir date from the 13th century. 

Dunblane did not have a rich or extensive medieval diocese (37 parishes), and so the cathedral is relatively modest in scale, but its refined architecture is much admired, as is its setting overlooking the valley of the Allan Water. After the Reformation, the nave of the cathedral was abandoned and soon became roofless and used for burials. The choir was retained as the parish church.

In 1715, the Battle of Sherriffmuir was fought on land very close to Dunblane. Many combatants were billeted in the town before the battle.

Dunblane Railway Station opened in 1848 as a stop on the Scottish Central Railway&#x27;s Stirling to Perth line, and later served as a junction with another line to Callander that eventually reached Oban. This line was axed with the Beeching cuts, closing in 1965.

During the boom years of the Hydropathy movement in the 19th century, Dunblane was the location of a successful hydropathic establishment (see photo below). The nave of the cathedral was re-roofed between 1889 and 1893, with new furnishings provided by Robert Rowand Anderson.

Since the early 1970s the town has grown extensively and is now regarded as a highly sought-after commuter town due to its excellent road and rail links and good schools. Dunblane is close to the University of Stirling&#x27;s campus at Bridge of Allan, and is a popular location for academics.

=== Massacre ===
On 13 March 1996 local man Thomas Hamilton shot dead 16 children and their teacher, Gwen Mayor, in Dunblane Primary School&#x27;s gymnasium before killing himself. He used his licensed weapons and ammunition.

There is a memorial to the 17 victims in the local cemetery and a cenotaph in the cathedral. There are also stained-glass windows in Church of the Holy Rude, St Blanes and Lecropt tempering the Children and their Teacher. The funds raised in the aftermath of the tragedy were used to build a new community centre (the Dunblane Centre). Following the incident, the government passed legislation banning ownership of all handguns—firearms under in overall length, in the United Kingdom.

Tennis players Jamie Murray and Andy Murray were in the school at the time of the massacre.

== Governance and status ==
The town was a royal burgh and part of Perthshire until the 1975 abolition of Scottish counties, from which point it became part of Stirling District in Central Region. In 1994, the regions were themselves abolished and Dunblane&#x27;s only local authority became Stirling Council. Dunblane also has an active community council.

Until 1983, Dunblane was part of the Kinross and Western Perthshire constituency of the UK parliament, being represented by predominantly Unionist (and Conservative) MPs. After 1983, it became part of the Stirling constituency, and since then has been represented by Conservative, Labour and SNP MPs. In the Scottish Parliament, Dunblane is part of the Clackmannanshire and Dunblane constituency and the Mid Scotland and Fife region. It shares a ward with Bridge of Allan in council elections.

Dunblane is often referred to as a city, due to the presence of Dunblane Cathedral. However, this status was never officially recognised.

== Landmarks, facilities and civic life ==
Dunblane currently has two supermarkets, a Tesco (opened in 1996) and a M&amp;S Foodhall (opened in 2009). Among other shops, the High Street has two independent butchers.

Over the course of 6 years, a small group of young local boys and their parents raised money to build a skatepark in the Laighills. The skatepark was completed on 23 February 2007 and has already been visited by Death skateboard team and by the Vans UK Tour.

=== Transport ===
The town is served by Dunblane railway station, which has regular services to Stirling, Perth, Glasgow and Edinburgh. It is also a stop on the Caledonian Sleeper from Inverness, and several other long-distance trains to Aberdeen, Dundee, Inverness, and even London. Formerly, Dunblane station was also the junction for services over the scenically attractive route to Doune, Callander and Crianlarich, where the line joined the still extant line from Glasgow to Oban. The route to Oban via the popular Callander line closed in 1965. As of 2022, Dunblane is the northernmost electrified station on the British railway network.

Dunblane is the point at which the M9 motorway ends and joins the A9 dual carriageway north towards Perth. The A9 formerly went through the centre of Dunblane, but a bypass was completed in 1991 and the old road became the B8033. The rapid expansion of the town has led to a large increase in local car usage, resulting in considerable parking problems.

=== Churches ===
* Dunblane Cathedral – Church of Scotland
* St Blane&#x27;s Church – Church of Scotland
* St Mary&#x27;s Church – Scottish Episcopal Church
* Church of the Holy Family – Roman Catholic Church
* Free Church of Scotland
* Dunblane Christian Fellowship
* Community of St Nicholas – Eastern Orthodox Church
Dunblane Cathedral is remarkable in having retained more of its late-medieval choir stalls than any other Scottish church building (except King&#x27;s College Chapel, Aberdeen), and also is noted for its organ. Further fragments of medieval woodwork from the cathedral are displayed in the town&#x27;s museum, formerly the Cathedral Museum, situated nearby. Though still used as a parish church, the building is in the care of Historic Scotland. To the south of the cathedral are some stone vaults of medieval origin, which are the only remaining fragment of the bishop&#x27;s palace.

Adjacent to the cathedral, &quot;Scottish Churches House&quot; was (from the 1960s until its closure in 2011) a centre for ecumenical study and the former headquarters for Action of Churches Together in Scotland. It now operates as a hotel, featuring a medieval chapel in the grounds.

=== Leighton Library ===
The old town centre retains a number of historic buildings in addition to the cathedral, including the 17th century Leighton Library, the oldest private library in Scotland open to the public (on selected days in summer). A well-preserved late medieval town-house nearby (which was probably built as the manse of the Dean of the medieval cathedral) houses a local history museum (open in the summer; free entry). A modern extension has recently been completed within its interior courtyard to provide additional exhibition space and allow disabled access.

===Dunblane Centre===
The Dunblane Centre is a purpose-built youth, family, arts, sports and community centre. It was built after a community vote chose that option for money from a consolidation of several funds which were created in the aftermath of the 1996 tragedy. It opened in 2004 and receives no state finance, relying on user revenue and fundraising. It is run by the Dunblane Youth and Sports Centre Trust (Charity No. SC027397), with a board of trustees from the community. 

=== Hotels ===

The north side of the town is dominated by the Dunblane Hydro Hotel, currently owned by the Hilton Hotel Group and operated under the Doubletree brand. The Victorian building sits in wooded grounds on the top of a steep and wide grass slope. Dating from the late 19th century, it has been redeveloped and extended several times but still retains its main building relatively intact. It originally housed extensive spa and therapeutic bath facilities (like the other Scottish &quot;Hydros&quot;, such as Crieff and Peebles).

===Schools===
There are currently around two thousand pupils in schools in Dunblane.

====Dunblane Primary School====
Dunblane Primary School is on Doune Road, on the western side of Dunblane. The school has a large playing field (with a basketball court), regularly used for extra-curricular activities and by local clubs. A council-run nursery is attached to the school, in a separate building.

As of 2022, it is the 2nd largest primary school in Stirling Council with 395 students.

In 1996, the school&#x27;s gym was the scene of the Dunblane massacre. The school reopened within days, and the old gym was quickly demolished and replaced with an extension at the other end of the building. The former gym site became a memorial garden.

Dunblane Primary&#x27;s uniform consists of blue polo shirts and red jumpers (except Primary 7, whose jumpers are black). The colour of the school logo on jumpers varies by house. The houses are named after local castles; Airthrey (red), Doune (blue), Drummond (yellow) and Kilbryde (green).

====St. Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Primary School====
St Mary&#x27;s is the oldest and smallest primary school in Dunblane, located near the middle of the town. It has been on its current site in Smithy Loan (near the Fourways roundabout) since 1850. St Mary&#x27;s was established as a church school for poor children under the incumbency of the first rector of St Mary&#x27;s Episcopal Church, Canon Henry Malcolm. It was renovated and extended in 1997.

St Mary&#x27;s had two teachers until the 1970s. There are now four classes covering the seven primary years, plus a nursery class. The St Mary&#x27;s uniform consists of blue polo shirts and green jumpers. The houses are Cromlix, Keir, Kilbryde and Kippenross.

====Newton Primary School====
Newton Primary was opened in 1996. The name of the school comes from Newton Farm, which goes back as far as the Charter of 1655 when Oliver Cromwell confirmed James Pearson of Kippenross as the owner. The streets that encircle the school, Newton Crescent and Ochiltree (named after the Bishop of Dunblane from 1429 to 1447), are reflected in the logo of the school, which includes a tractor and a celtic cross.

Around 440 pupils attend Newton Primary. Like the other two primary schools in Dunblane, it also has an attached nursery. Newton Primary&#x27;s uniform consists of white polo shirts and royal blue jumpers. For Primary 7&#x27;s the uniform is slightly different, instead consisting of white polo shirts and a Darker Navy blue jumper.

In 2019 the head teacher of Newton Primary died, since then they have built a memorial building in remembrance.

====Dunblane High School====
Dunblane High School has roughly 1000 pupils and 60 teachers and is fed mainly by pupils from Dunblane&#x27;s three primary schools. The school is in the south west of Dunblane, on Old Doune Road. The current building was completed in November 2007, later being formally opened by Jamie Murray. It was constructed on the playing fields of the previous 1970s structure, the old campus being sold for residential development and the playing fields moved to the other side of the bypass. The current building includes some theatre facilities, a fitness suite, a dance studio, several pupil lounges, and an all weather sports pitch that was originally built for the old building. The building was the first Public-Private Partnership school project in the Stirling Council area. Complaints were made that it had inadequate catering facilities, and was the only Stirling school built without a swimming pool. The school has not had a library since 2011.

The school has consistently performed well academically. In 2013, the school was listed in the top ten performing schools of Scotland relating to academic achievement, with well over three quarters of its roll progressing to higher education. In 2019, the school was named as Scotland&#x27;s second best performing state school as 76% of school leavers had achieved five or more highers in 2018.

Dunblane High&#x27;s uniform has been, since 2010, a white shirt with black trousers or skirt, &quot;Blu Tack&quot; blue knitwear and a royal blue blazer (or a black blazer with light blue braiding for S6). Ties vary by year group. The houses are Ramoyle (red), Sheriffmuir (yellow) and Kilbryde (blue).

====Queen Victoria School====
Queen Victoria School is a co-educational boarding school for children of those in the British Armed Forces, and is managed and funded by the Ministry of Defence. It is situated roughly north of the town centre, in a secluded area overlooking the A9. The school&#x27;s chapel is a notable example of Scottish medieval revival architecture, based on the 14th century Dominican (later parish) church of St Monans in Fife.

<doc id="368445" wikidata="Q1293366" url="?curid=368445" title="Teesside">
<text>Teesside () is an urban area around the River Tees in North East England. Straddling the border between County Durham and North Yorkshire, it spans the boroughs of Middlesbrough, Stockton-on-Tees and Redcar and Cleveland. In 2011, it was the eighteenth largest urban area in the United Kingdom. It forms part of the wider Tees Valley area, which also includes the boroughs of Darlington and Hartlepool. 

Towns on Teesside include Middlesbrough, Stockton-on-Tees, Billingham, Redcar, Thornaby-on-Tees, and Ingleby Barwick. The local economy was once dominated by heavy manufacturing until deindustrialisation in the latter half of the 20th century.

==History==
===1968–1974: County borough===
Before the county of Cleveland was created, the area (including Stockton-on-Tees) existed as a part of the North Riding of Yorkshire, due to most land being south of the Tees. Teesside was created due to Stockton-on-Tees being linked heavily with Thornaby (which had amalgamated with South Stockton/Mandale to form the Borough of Thornaby), Middlesbrough and Redcar by industry.

Compared to the modern Teesside conurbation, the area was smaller, then excluding towns such as Hartlepool, Ingleby Barwick and Yarm, the latter two being in the Stokesley Rural District until Cleveland was created. The Teesside name is still used as a synonym for Tees Valley with most signage and local business retaining the name.

===1969: Redcliffe-Maud Report===
The Royal Commission, proposed in the Redcliffe-Maud Report, a large unitary authority called Teesside. It would have covered what came to be the County of Cleveland in addition to Whitby and Stokesley.

===1974–1996: Non-metropolitan county===
The County of Cleveland was created in 1974. It was smaller and included a county and four borough councils than the Redcliffe-Maud report&#x27;s single council.

The name was also changed from Teesside to Cleveland as the report&#x27;s area South of the River Tees corresponded to the Langbaurgh Wapentake, which had the alternative name of Cleveland. Cleveland Police was retained, along with other institutions covering the four boroughs. Each borough became a unitary authority with the county council abolished in 1996.

===From 2016: Mayoralty===

In 1998 the neighbouring Borough of Darlington gained unitary authority status. Tees Valley was initially a statistical sub-region of North East England across the four former Cleveland boroughs and the Borough of Darlington.

This name and area carried over to an enterprise partnership formed in 2011 and a combined authority created in 2016, twenty years after the abolition of the Cleveland county. The authority is headed by a mayor, presently William Boyle.

==Demography==

The Teesside Built-up Area (BUA), previously the Teesside Urban Area in 2001, identified by the ONS for statistical purposes had a population of around 376,633 according to the 2011 census which is up 3% on the 2001 figure of 365,323, and had the following subdivisions:
*North Tees
**Stockton-on-Tees (82,792)
**Billingham (35,392)
**Wolviston (877)
**High Clarence (773)
*South Tees
**Middlesbrough (174,700)
**Redcar (37,073)
**Thornaby-on-Tees (24,741)
**Ingleby Barwick (20,378)
Eaglescliffe (north) and Yarm (south) are counted as a separate Yarm urban area, separated by a narrow gap, which had a population of 19,184 according to the 2011 census; up 5% from the 2001 figure of 18,335. Infilling development may join the two urban areas together. Marske-by-the-Sea is another separate Urban Area nearly contiguous with Redcar with a population of 8,282 down 7% from the 2001 figure of 8,921.

The nearby Hartlepool built-up area is sometimes grouped with the area, due to it previously being in Cleveland county. The Hartlepool area has an urban population of 88,855 an increase of 3% from the 2001 figure of 86,085 and this can be referred to as the Teesside &amp; Hartlepool Urban Area. If this definition is taken into consideration, with the addition of the Eaglescliffe area and Marske, Teesside would have a population of approximately 492,954 people.

==Processing==
Teesside industry is dominated by the commodity and integrated chemical producers in the North East of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC). These companies are based on three large chemical sites at Wilton, Billingham and Seal Sands. These companies make products such as petrochemicals, commodity chemicals, fertilizers and polymers.

===Salt===

Salt extraction for human consumption and had taken place at Seal Sands since Roman times through the use of panning. This continued throughout the 20th century and left caverns which are now used as liquid/gas storage facilities for the process industry.

In 1859, rock salt deposits were discovered in Middlesbrough by Henry Bolckow and Vaughan while boring for water. This led to heavy chemical industry moving to the area.

Salt works were established at Haverton Hill in 1882 by the Bell Brothers. It was the first firm to begin large scale salt production in the area, this required some workers in from Cheshire. Salt-making interests of the Bell Brothers were bought by Brunner Mond &amp; Co of Cheshire in 1890. Brunner Mond became a giant of the area&#x27;s chemical-making in the late 19th and early 20th centuries.

During the 20th century, salt extraction on the Tees&#x27;s north bank (by aqueous hydraulic means) resulted in a number of underground salt cavities that are impervious to gas and liquids. Consequently, these cavities are now used to store both industrial gases and liquids by companies which are members of the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC).

Today Venator Materials is based close to Greatham, operating one of the world&#x27;s largest chemical plants for titanium dioxide manufacturing. It is a brilliant white pigment used in paints, Polo mints, cosmetics, UV sunscreens, plastics, golf balls, the white part of a traffic cone and sports field line markings.

===Alkali===
In 1860 William James established an alkali company at Cargo Fleet and in 1869 Samuel Sadler also set up a factory nearby. Sadler&#x27;s works produced synthetic aniline and alzarin dyestuffs and distilled tar. The introduction of the Solvay Process to make alkali in 1872 made nearby Tyneside alkali industry uneconomical but helped Teesside industry which was invigorated by the discovery of further salt deposits at Port Clarence near Seal Sands by Bell Brothers in 1874.

===Ammonia===

The chemical industry was established at Billingham in 1918 by the Government for the production of synthetic ammonia, with its intended use being the manufacture of munitions during the Great War. The 700 acre Grange Farm at Billingham was chosen for the site. However, by the time the plant opened the war was over and its manufacturing techniques outdated. It was taken over by Brunner Mond in 1920 and manufactured synthetic ammonia and fertilisers. Brunner Mond merged with other large scale chemical manufacturers in 1926 to form Imperial Chemical Industries (ICI).

===Sulphuric acid and fertilisers===
Teesside&#x27;s first chemical works was when Robert Wilson produced sulphuric acid and fertilisers at Urlay Nook near Egglescliffe in 1833.

In 1928, anhydrite was mined from below Billingham for making sulphuric acid, a component for detergent and fertilizer manufacturing. Ammonia and fertiliser works are operated by CF Fertilisers.

===Plastics and nylon===
Billingham&#x27;s plastic manufacturing began in 1934. This was one of the earliest sites in the world where large-scale manufacture of these materials took place. Another chemical plant was established the following year to make oil and petrol from creosote and coal by a process called hydrogenation. In 1946 another large chemical works opened on Teesside at Wilton, on the south side of the River Tees. Further lands were purchased by ICI in 1962 at Seal Sands, where land had been reclaimed from the sea, becoming the third large-scale chemical manufacturing site on Teesside. Today all three Teesside chemical sites at Billingham, Wilton, and Seal Sands remain in use for large-scale chemical manufacture by the members of the Northeast of England Process Industry Cluster (NEPIC), and plastics and polymers continue to be manufactured there by Lotte Chemicals(PET), SABIC (HDPE), Victrex (PEEK) and Lucite International (Perspex). Nylon 66 manufacture ceased on Teesside in 2008 with the Invista manufacturing unit closed.

===Petrochemical===
Coke ovens used in chemical production at Billingham were replaced in 1962 by plants using the steam naphtha process, which enabled use of crude oil as feedstock for a process known as cracking. This proved to be a much cheaper way to produce ethylene, aromatics, petroleum derivatives and other chemicals such as ammonia. From 1964 to 1969 four large oil refineries were erected at the mouth of the Tees, two by Phillips Petroleum and one each by ICI and Shell. Their main purpose was to supply Billingham&#x27;s chemical industry. A pipeline was built in 1968 for the transport of ethylene and linked chemical works on Teesside with chemical plants at Runcorn. Today, ConocoPhillips operate oil refinery sites while Ensus Energy and Harvest Energy have biorefineries, the latter two produce biodiesel and bioethanol as transport fuels. SABIC operate the ethylene cracker at Wilton.

==Metal works==

Before 1846 Walbottle, Elswick, Birtley, Ridsdale, Hareshaw, Wylam, Consett, Stanhope, Crookhall, Tow-Law and Witton Park all had iron works but the discovery of a rich seam of iron ore to the south of the region gradually drew iron and steel manufacture towards Teesside.
In 1850 iron ore was discovered in the Cleveland Hills near Eston to the south of Middlesbrough and Iron gradually replaced coal as the lifeblood of Eston. The ore was discovered by geologist John Marley and first used by John Vaughan, the principal ironmaster of Middlesbrough who along with his German business partner Henry Bolckow had already established a small iron foundry and rolling mill using iron stone from Durham and the Yorkshire coast, with the new discovery prompting them to build Teesside&#x27;s first blast furnace in 1851. Many more iron works followed, such as those built in the region by Losh, Wilson and Bell (see Sir Issac Lowthian Bell) who in 1853 were operating 5 furnaces in the region.

The success of John Vaughan and Henry Bolckow&#x27;s first blast furnace meant that by 1873 Middlesbrough was producing 2 million tonnes of pig iron a year. Iron was in big demand in Britain in the late 19th century, particularly for the rapid expansion of the railways. More and more blast furnaces were opened in the vicinity of Middlesbrough to meet this demand such that by the end of the century Teesside was producing about a third of the nation&#x27;s iron output. Middlesbrough, which became known by its nickname &quot;Ironopolis&quot;, was visited in 1862 by then prime minister William Ewart Gladstone who said &quot;This remarkable place, the youngest child of England&#x27;s enterprise, is an infant, but if an infant, an infant Hercules&quot;
By the 1870s steel, a much stronger and more resilient metal, was in big demand and Middlesbrough had to compete with Sheffield as the major producer. In 1875 Bolckow and Vaughan opened the first Bessemer Steel plant in Middlesbrough and the River Tees then become known as &quot;The Steel River&quot; leaving its old nickname &quot;Ironopolis&quot; behind. In 1881 Hugh Reid (Liberal politician) described how &quot;The iron of Eston has diffused itself all over the world. it furnishes the railways of the world; it runs by neapolitan and papal dungeons; it startles the bandit in his haunt in cicilia; it crosses over the plains of Africa; it stretches over the plains of India. it has crept out of the Cleveland Hills where it has slept since Roman days, and now like a strong and invincible serpent, coils itself around the world&quot;

By 1929 the great depression began to effect Britain and the famous name of Bolckow-Vaughan merged with neighbour Dorman-Long &amp; Co. who then became Britain&#x27;s biggest iron and steel maker and employed 33,000 people. In 1954 the post-war boom saw Dorman-Long build a state of the art steelworks at Lackenby and then new blast furnaces at Clay Lane. 1967 saw Dorman-Long become part of the nationalized British Steel Corporation as production boomed in Britain and in 1979 the largest blast furnace in Europe was erected at BSC&#x27;s new Redcar plant. This plant which was subsequently acquired and operated by Corus, Tata Steel and then Sahaviriya Steel Industries (SSI) who are still the plant operating today.

===British Steel Industrial Archive===
The British Steel Collection, now housed at Teesside University, contains the records of over forty iron and steel companies based in the Teesside area of the North East of England and covers the period –1970. The history of Teesside and its rapid growth during the 19th century is directly linked to the expansion of the railways from Darlington and Stockton towards the mouth of the Tees estuary and the subsequent discovery of ironstone in the Cleveland Hills which attracted iron companies to the area. The British Steel Collection archives the company records of iron and steel companies such as Bolckow &amp; Vaughan, Bell Brothers, Cochrane &amp; Co. Ltd., Dorman, Long &amp; Co. Ltd., South Durham Steel &amp; Iron Co. Ltd., Cargo Fleet Iron Company and Skinningrove Iron Co. Ltd. With records of associated institutions such as the Middlesbrough Exchange Co. Ltd. and the Cleveland Mineowners&#x27; Association also being preserved.

==Uses in local culture==

Teesside continues to be used locally to refer to the entire urban area and the name can still be seen in the following uses:

*Teesside University
*Teesside retail and leisure park which was founded by the now defunct Teesside Development Corporation
*Teesside International Airport and Teesside Airport railway station, the local airport and railway station serving the airport
*BBC Radio Tees broadcast across the area from its studios located in Middlesbrough
*Local TV Teesside, a local-based television channel 
*TeessideLive, online version of &quot;The Gazette&quot;, a regional newspaper
*Teesside 3t Training centre, long-standing processing and heavy industries
*’T-Side’, a clothing brand featuring iconic parts of the area. 
*&quot;Teesside&quot; continues to be used as signed destination on UK road signs. It is only once the boroughs are entered that local town names are used. This is due to the County Borough of Teesside being active during the building of multiple roads at the time.

It has also been adopted for various other purposes as a synonym for the former county of Cleveland.

<text>The Merrion Gates () is a railway level crossing in Merrion/Sandymount, Dublin, Ireland, where the DART and Dublin–Rosslare railway line crosses Strand Road near its junction with Merrion Road. There is pedestrian access to Sandymount Strand immediately to the east of the railway crossing.

First built in 1834, the junction is a &quot;notorious&quot; traffic bottleneck, which also restricts the possible frequency of railway traffic. The term &quot;Merrion Gates&quot; is sometimes used to refer to the surrounding area, and a number of nearby businesses take their name from the junction.

==History==
The Merrion Gates site is close to the former Merrion Castle, which was destroyed during the Irish Rebellion of 1641. The railway line and gates were built in 1834 by the Dublin and Kingstown Railway, at a site described in some sources as a &quot;symbolic entry point to the inner city&quot;. Important passengers, who travelled to Dublin by train from Dún Laoghaire port, were sometimes greeted at the Merrion Gates – including the Papal legate in advance of the 1932 Eucharistic Congress.

In 1921, during the Irish War of Independence, the Merrion Gates were the site of an ambush and shootout which resulted in the deaths of two civilians.

The Merrion Gates railway crossing lies just north of the former Merrion railway station. This station opened in 1835 and closed in 1935. Neighbouring stations still in operation include Sydney Parade to the north and Booterstown to the south.

==Development proposals==
As of the early 21st century, the Merrion Gates are a well-known and &quot;notorious&quot; traffic bottleneck, where the gates have been reportedly &quot;closed for up to 20 minutes per hour at peak times&quot;.

In 2016, the National Transport Authority unveiled a proposal to close the Merrion Gates and to divert motor traffic onto a new road bridge to be built over the railway approximately 250 metres to the north. The proposal expected that pedestrian and cycle traffic would be routed through a tunnel under the crossing. As of mid-2018, these proposals had reportedly been &quot;shelved&quot;.

<text>The Goodwill Games were an international sports competition created by Ted Turner in reaction to the political troubles surrounding the Olympic Games of the 1980s. In 1979, the Soviet invasion of Afghanistan caused the United States and other Western countries to boycott the 1980 Summer Olympics in Moscow, an act reciprocated when the Soviet Union and other Eastern Bloc countries (with the exception of Romania) boycotted the 1984 Summer Olympics in Los Angeles.

The idea came to Turner in 1984 during his visit to Moscow. He was disappointed with the boycott, evaluating it as a negative outcome for both sides in the conflict. The magnate also believed that it was an opportune moment to create alternative high-level competitions that could “steal” some of the success from the Olympics. The organization of the competition cost him more than $11 million.

Like the Olympics, the Goodwill Games were held every four years (with the exception of the final Games), and had a summer and winter component. However, unlike the Olympics, figure skating, ice hockey and short track speed skating were part of summer editions. The Summer Goodwill Games occurred five times, between 1986 and 2001, while the Winter Goodwill Games occurred only once, in 2000. They were cancelled by Time Warner, which had bought ownership of them in 1996, because of low television ratings after the 2001 Games in Brisbane.

==Overview==
Founded in 1985 by then-Turner Broadcasting System chairman Ted Turner, The Goodwill Games were created to foster athletic competition between the United States and the Soviet Union during the Cold War. The first Goodwill Games, held in Moscow in 1986, featured 182 events and attracted over 3,000 athletes representing 79 countries. World records were set by Sergey Bubka (pole vault), Jackie Joyner-Kersee (heptathlon), and both the men and women&#x27;s 200 m cycle racing, by East Germany&#x27;s Michael Hübner and the Soviet Union&#x27;s Erika Salumäe, respectively. World records also fell at the 1990 Games in Seattle, to Mike Barrowman in the 200 m breaststroke and Nadezhda Ryashkina in the 10 km walk.

The 1994 Games in Saint Petersburg, Russia were the first competition held since the dissolution of the Soviet Union. Russians set five world records in the weightlifting section, and the games were the first major international event to feature beach volleyball, which would appear at the Olympics for the first time at the 1996 Summer Olympics.

In October 1996, Turner&#x27;s company, the Turner Broadcasting System, merged with Time Warner, thus bringing the Goodwill Games under the control of the latter. Ted Turner&#x27;s last Games were in 1998 in New York City, with memorable highlights including Joyner-Kersee winning her fourth straight heptathlon title, the U.S. 4 × 400 m relay team setting a world&#x27;s best time, plus Michelle Kwan and Todd Eldredge winning the gold in figure skating, and Dominique Moceanu capturing the women&#x27;s gymnastics gold medal. Time Warner organized the 2001 Games in Brisbane, Australia, before announcing that this would be the last edition of the games. With the cancellation of the Games, Phoenix and Calgary lost their respective Summer and Winter Games, scheduled for 2005. The 2001 edition witnessed Australia winning the most medals with 75, but it received very low television ratings in the United States. Nevertheless, critics praised Turner Network Television for showing the games live, rather than on tape delay.

During a live interview at the 2009 Denver SportAccord conference, Turner blamed the demise of the Games on the short-sighted management of Time Warner, and stated, &quot;If I&#x27;d have stayed there the Goodwill Games would not have been canceled.&quot; Turner expressed hope that the games would return as a bridge to restore cultural contact between Russia and the U.S., stating that the relationship between the two had steadily disintegrated since the Cold War, which he called a dangerous situation because of both countries&#x27; massive nuclear arsenals. He also reiterated his belief in the power of international sporting competitions to prevent war, saying that &quot;as long as the Olympics are taking place and not being boycotted, it&#x27;s virtually impossible to have a world war&quot;, because the nations involved &quot;wouldn&#x27;t want a war to mess up their chances&quot;.

<text>County borough is a term introduced in 1889 in the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland, to refer to a borough or a city independent of county council control, similar to the unitary authorities created since the 1990s. An equivalent term used in Scotland was a county of city. They were abolished by the Local Government Act 1972 in England and Wales, but continue in use for lieutenancy and shrievalty in Northern Ireland. In the Republic of Ireland they remain in existence but have been renamed &quot;cities&quot; under the provisions of the Local Government Act 2001. The Local Government (Wales) Act 1994 re-introduced the term for certain &quot;principal areas&quot; in Wales. Scotland did not have county boroughs but instead had counties of cities. These were abolished on 16 May 1975. All four Scottish cities of the time—Aberdeen, Dundee, Edinburgh, and Glasgow—were included in this category. There was an additional category of large burgh in the Scottish system (similar to a municipal borough in England and Wales), which were responsible for all services apart from police, education and fire.

When county councils were first created in 1889, it was decided that to let them have authority over large towns or cities would be impractical, and so any large incorporated place would have the right to be a county borough, and thus independent from the administrative county it would otherwise come under. Some cities and towns were already independent counties corporate, and most were to become county boroughs. Originally ten county boroughs were proposed; Bristol, Hull, Newcastle upon Tyne and Nottingham, which were already counties, and Birmingham, Bradford, Leeds, Liverpool, Manchester, and Sheffield, which were not. The Local Government Act 1888 as eventually passed required a population of over 50,000 except in the case of existing counties corporate. This resulted in 61 county boroughs in England and two in Wales (Cardiff and Swansea). Several exceptions were allowed, mainly for historic towns, including Bath and Dudley, which would still remain below the 50,000 limit by the time of the 1901 census. Some of the smaller counties corporate—Berwick upon Tweed, Lichfield, Poole, Carmarthen and Haverfordwest—did not become county boroughs, although Canterbury, with a population under 25,000, did.

==== Growth ====
The county councils and county borough councils came into operation on 1 April 1889. Just seven months later, on 9 November 1889, the city of Oxford was the first borough which had not been made a county borough by the 1888 Act to be elevated to county borough status. Various other new county boroughs were constituted in the following decades, generally as more boroughs reached the 50,000 minimum and then promoted Acts to constitute them county boroughs. The granting of county borough status was the subject of much disagreement between the large municipal boroughs and the county councils. The population limit provided county councils with a disincentive to allow mergers or boundary amendments to districts that would create authorities with large populations, as this would allow them to seek county borough status and remove the tax base from the administrative county.

County boroughs to be constituted in this era were a mixed bag, including some towns that would continue to expand such as Bournemouth and Southend-on-Sea. Other towns such as Burton upon Trent and Dewsbury were not to increase in population much past 50,000. 1913 saw the attempts of Luton and Cambridge to gain county borough status defeated in the House of Commons, despite the approval of the Local Government Board – the removal of Cambridge from Cambridgeshire would have reduced the income of Cambridgeshire County Council by over half.

==== Slowdown ====

Upon recommendation of a commission chaired by the Earl of Onslow, the population threshold was raised to 75,000 in 1926, by the Local Government (County Boroughs and Adjustments) Act 1926, which also made it much harder to expand boundaries. The threshold was raised to 100,000 by the Local Government Act 1958.

The viability of the county borough of Merthyr Tydfil came into question in the 1930s. Due to a decline in the heavy industries of the town, by 1932 more than half the male population was unemployed, resulting in very high municipal rates in order to make public assistance payments. At the same time the population of the borough was lower than when it had been created in 1908. A royal commission was appointed in May 1935 to &quot;investigate whether the existing status of Merthyr Tydfil as a county borough should be continued, and if not, what other arrangements should be made&quot;. The commission reported the following November, and recommended that Merthyr should revert to the status of a non-county borough, and that public assistance should be taken over by central government. In the event county borough status was retained by the town, with the chairman of the Welsh Board of Health appointed as administrative adviser in 1936.

After the Second World War the creation of new county boroughs in England and Wales was effectively suspended, pending a local government review. A government white paper published in 1945 stated that &quot;it is expected that there will be a number of Bills for extending or creating county boroughs&quot; and proposed the creation of a boundary commission to bring coordination to local government reform. The policy in the paper also ruled out the creation of new county boroughs in Middlesex &quot;owing to its special problems&quot;. The Local Government Boundary Commission was appointed on 26 October 1945, under the chairmanship of Sir Malcolm Trustram Eve, delivering its report in 1947. The commission recommended that towns with a population of 200,000 or more should become one-tier &quot;new counties&quot;, with &quot;new county boroughs&quot; having a population of 60,000 – 200,000 being &quot;most-purpose authorities&quot;, with the county council of the administrative county providing certain limited services. The report envisaged the creation of 47 two-tiered &quot;new counties&quot;, 21 one-tiered &quot;new counties&quot; and 63 &quot;new county boroughs&quot;. The recommendations of the commission extended to a review of the division of functions between different tiers of local government, and thus fell outside its terms of reference, and its report was not acted upon.

==== Partial reform ====
The next attempt at reform was by the Local Government Act 1958, which established the Local Government Commission for England and the Local Government Commission for Wales to carry out reviews of existing local government structures and recommend reforms. Although the Commissions did not complete their work before being dissolved, a handful of new county boroughs were constituted between 1964 and 1968. Luton, Torbay, and Solihull gained county borough status. Additionally, the Teesside was formed from a merger of the existing county borough of Middlesbrough, and the municipal boroughs of Stockton-on-Tees, Redcar and Thornaby; Warley was formed from the county borough of Smethwick and the non-county boroughs of Oldbury and Rowley Regis; and West Hartlepool was merged with Hartlepool. Following these changes, there was a total of 79 county boroughs in England. The Commission also recommended the downgrading of Barnsley to be a non-county borough, but this was not carried out.

==== Abolition ====

The county boroughs of East Ham, West Ham and Croydon were abolished in 1965 with the creation of Greater London and went on to form parts of London boroughs. The remaining county boroughs were abolished in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972, and replaced with non-metropolitan districts and metropolitan districts, all beneath county councils in a two-tier structure. In Greater London and the metropolitan counties the lower tier districts retained a wider range of powers than in the non-metropolitan counties.

==== Revival ====

This situation did not persist long. In 1986 the metropolitan county councils and the Greater London Council were abolished, returning the metropolitan boroughs to a status equivalent to the former county boroughs, but sharing some powers (police and transport for example). In the 1990s, many of the non-metropolitan former county boroughs were reformed again as unitary authorities – essentially the same as a county borough. As a result, by 2015, most former county boroughs were either metropolitan boroughs or unitary authorities with a status similar to the old county boroughs. In England, most of those former county boroughs that did not gain unitary authority status—Barrow-in-Furness, Burnley, Canterbury, Carlisle, Chester, Eastbourne, Gloucester, Great Yarmouth, Hastings, Ipswich, Lincoln, Northampton, Norwich, Oxford, Preston, and Worcester—have given their names to non-unitary local government districts (in some cases coterminous with the old county borough, in other cases much larger). Burton upon Trent became an unparished area in the East Staffordshire borough, and has now been divided into several parishes.

In Wales, several principal areas are county boroughs:

* Newport (acquired city status in 2002)
* Merthyr Tydfil
* Caerphilly
* Blaenau Gwent
* Torfaen
* Vale of Glamorgan
* Bridgend
* Rhondda Cynon Taf
* Neath Port Talbot
* Wrexham
* Conwy

For all practical purposes, county boroughs are exactly the same as the other principal areas of Wales called &quot;&quot;counties&quot; (including &quot;cities and counties&quot;&quot;) as all these areas are run by unitary authorities (i.e. have the functions of both boroughs and counties). Although unitary authorities are functionally equivalent to county boroughs, only in Wales is the title given official recognition by Act of Parliament.

=== English county boroughs in 1973 ===
The map depicts the county boroughs in England immediately prior to their abolition in 1974. County boroughs in Wales and Northern Ireland are not shown.

This table shows those county boroughs that existed in England and Wales between the Local Government Acts of 1888 (that created them) and 1972 (that abolished them from 1974).

Only four districts with more than one county borough were formed: Wirral, Sandwell, Sefton and Kirklees. Elsewhere, county boroughs usually formed the core or all of a district named after the county borough – with the exceptions of Halifax, whose metropolitan district was named Calderdale, Burton upon Trent, which became part of the East Staffordshire district, and Teesside, which was split up between three non-metropolitan districts.

=== Previous county boroughs ===

County boroughs to be abolished prior to 1974 were:

== Northern Ireland ==
The county boroughs of Belfast and Derry were created by the Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898.

In Northern Ireland, local government has not used county boroughs since 1973, but they remain in use for lieutenancy.

For administrative purposes the two county boroughs in Northern Ireland were replaced with two larger districts (Belfast and Londonderry).

==Republic of Ireland==
The Local Government (Ireland) Act 1898 created county boroughs in Ireland. Under the Act, four former counties corporate (Cork, Dublin, Limerick and Waterford) became county boroughs.

Galway became a county borough in 1986.

In the Republic of Ireland, the relevant legislation remained in force (although amended), and county boroughs on the original model existed until 2001. Under the Local Government Act 2001 (which replaced most existing local government legislation in Ireland), the term &quot;County Borough&quot; was abolished and replaced with &quot;City&quot; (and hence, &quot;Corporation&quot; with &quot;City Council&quot;). However Kilkenny, while a traditional city, was never a county borough. Under the Local Government Reform Act 2014, the borough of Kilkenny was abolished, but the municipal district containing the administrative area of the former borough of Kilkenny would be known as the Municipal District of Kilkenny City.

<text>Alton Brooks Parker (May 14, 1852 – May 10, 1926) was an American judge. He was the Democratic nominee in the 1904 United States presidential election, losing in a landslide to incumbent Republican Theodore Roosevelt.

A native of upstate New York, Parker practiced law in Kingston, New York, before being appointed to the New York Supreme Court and elected to the New York Court of Appeals. He served as Chief Judge of the latter from 1898 to 1904, when he resigned to run for president. In 1904, he defeated liberal publisher William Randolph Hearst for the Democratic Party nomination for President of the United States. In the general election, Parker opposed popular incumbent Republican President Theodore Roosevelt. After a disorganized and ineffective campaign, Parker was defeated by 336 electoral votes to 140, carrying only the traditionally Democratic Solid South. He then returned to practicing law.

In later life, he managed John Alden Dix&#x27;s successful 1910 campaign for Governor of New York and served as prosecution counsel for the 1913 impeachment of Dix&#x27;s successor, Governor William Sulzer. During the 1912 presidential election, Parker joined with other constitutional conservatives in an absolute defense of the power of judicial review against critics like Theodore Roosevelt or William Jennings Bryan who advocated a popular check on judicial decisions.

==Early life==
Parker was born in Cortland, New York, to John Brooks Parker, a farmer, and Harriet F. Stratton. Both of his parents were well educated and encouraged his reading from an early age. At the age of 12 or 13, Parker watched his father serve as a juror and was so fascinated by the proceedings that he resolved to become a lawyer. He attended Cortland Academy, and left to begin working as a teacher in Binghamton. There he became engaged to Mary Louise Schoonmaker, the daughter of a man who owned property near his school. He then returned to Cortland Academy.

While at Cortland Normal School, Parker was a member of Gamma Sigma Fraternity. After graduation, he attended the State Normal School in Cortland (now the State University of New York College at Cortland), Parker married Schoonmaker in 1872 and became a clerk at Schoonmaker &amp; Hardenburgh, a legal firm at which one of her relatives was the senior partner. He then enrolled at Albany Law School. After graduating with an LL.B. degree in 1873, he practiced law in Kingston until 1878 as the senior partner of the firm Parker &amp; Kenyon.

Parker also became active with the Democratic Party. In 1877, he won election as surrogate court judge of Ulster County, and he was elected to a new six-year term in 1883. He served as a delegate to the 1880 and 1884 Democratic national conventions. In between the two conventions, he helped Grover Cleveland get elected Governor of New York in 1882. At the 1884 convention, he supported Cleveland, who was named the party&#x27;s presidential nominee; Cleveland went on to narrowly defeat Republican James G. Blaine in the fall election. The new president offered Parker the position of first assistant postmaster general, but Parker rejected the offer, citing monetary reasons. During this time, Parker also became a protege of David B. Hill, managing Hill&#x27;s 1885 gubernatorial campaign.

== Judicial career ==
After his election, Hill appointed Parker to fill an 1885 vacancy on the New York Supreme Court created by the death of Justice Theodore R. Westbrook. In 1886, Parker was elected to his own fourteen-year term in the seat. The Republicans declined to nominate a candidate to run against Parker. Three years later, Parker became an appellate judge when Hill appointed him to the newly formed Second Department of the Appellate Division. In November 1897, Parker successfully ran for the post of Chief Judge of the Court of Appeals, defeating Republican William James Wallace.

As a judge, Parker was notable for independently researching each case that he heard. He was considered to be pro-labor and was an active supporter of social reform legislation, for example upholding a maximum-hours law as constitutional. His judicial opinions were noted &quot;for their forceful diction, comprehensive grasp of the fundamental questions involved, unsparing labor in citing precedents, close reasoning, and their tendency to disregard merely technicalities.&quot; 

During his time as Chief Judge, Parker and his wife sold their Kingston home and bought an estate in Esopus on the Hudson River, calling the house &quot;Rosemount&quot;. They were the parents of two children, Bertha and John. John died of tetanus while still a child. Bertha Schoonmaker Parker married the Reverend Charles Mercer Hall, with whom she had two children, Alton Parker Hall and Mary McAlister Hall Oxholm.

===Notable cases===
* In the landmark &quot;Hamer v. Sidway&quot; (1891) case, Parker held that forbearance (voluntarily abstaining) of legal rights on promises of future benefit made by other parties can constitute valid consideration for the purposes of forming a contract. Parker&#x27;s &quot;Hamer&quot; opinion also held that unilateral contracts were valid under New York law.
* In &quot;Roberson v. Rochester Folding Box Co&quot; (1902), Parker held against Abigail Roberson, a teenager whose face had been used in advertisements without her permission. Parker held that this use did not violate her common law privacy rights. The decision was unpopular in the press and led to the passage of a privacy law by the New York State Legislature the following year.
* In &quot;People v. Place&quot; (1902), Parker wrote an opinion upholding the death sentence given to convicted murderer Martha Place, who became the first woman to be executed by electric chair.

== Presidential nomination ==
As the 1904 presidential election approached, the Democrats began to search for a nominee to oppose popular incumbent Republican president Theodore Roosevelt, and Parker&#x27;s name arose as a possible candidate. Roosevelt&#x27;s Secretary of War Elihu Root said of Parker that he &quot;has never opened his mouth on any national question&quot;, but Roosevelt feared that the man&#x27;s neutrality would prove a political advantage, writing that &quot;the neutral-tinted individual is very apt to win against the man of pronounced views and active life&quot;.

The 1904 Democratic National Convention was held in July in St. Louis, Missouri, then also hosting the 1904 World&#x27;s Fair and the 1904 Summer Olympics. Parker&#x27;s mentor David B. Hill—having attempted and failed to capture the nomination himself at the 1892 convention—now led the campaign for his protege&#x27;s nomination. William Jennings Bryan, who had been nominated but defeated by William McKinley in both 1896 and 1900, was no longer considered by delegates to be a viable alternative. Radicals in the party supported publisher William Randolph Hearst but lacked sufficient numbers to secure the nomination due to opposition from Bryan and Tammany Hall, the powerful New York political machine. Small clusters of delegates pledged support to other candidates, including Missouri Senator Francis Cockrell; Richard Olney, Grover Cleveland&#x27;s Secretary of State; Edward C. Wall, a former Wisconsin State Representative; and George Gray, a former Senator from Delaware. Other delegates spoke of nominating Cleveland, who had already served two nonconsecutive terms, but Cleveland was no longer popular outside the party or even within it, due to his rift with Bryan.

Parker&#x27;s long service on the bench proved to be an advantage in his nomination, as he had avoided taking stands on issues that divided the party, particularly that of currency standards. Hill and other Parker supporters remained deliberately silent on their candidate&#x27;s beliefs. By the time the convention cast their votes, it was clear that no candidate but Parker could unify the party, and he was selected on the first ballot. Henry G. Davis, an elderly West Virginia millionaire and former senator, was selected as the vice presidential candidate in the hope that he would partially finance Parker&#x27;s campaign.

The convention was driven by debate over whether to include a free silver plank in the campaign&#x27;s platform, opposing the gold standard and calling for the government to mint large numbers of silver dollars. The &quot;free silver&quot; movement, a key plank for the party in 1896 and 1900, was popular among indebted Western farmers who felt that inflation would help them repay their debts. Business interests, in contrast, supported the lower inflation of the gold standard. Bryan, famous for his 1896 &quot;Cross of Gold&quot; speech opposing the gold standard, fought bitterly to avoid the inclusion of the gold standard in the party platform in 1904. Ultimately the convention agreed not to include a plank on the subject.

However, seeking to win the support of the Eastern &quot;sound money&quot; faction, Parker sent a telegram to the convention immediately upon hearing news of his nomination that he considered the gold standard &quot;firmly and irrevocably established&quot; and would decline the nomination if he could not state this in his campaign. The telegram sparked a new debate and fresh opposition from Bryan, but the convention eventually replied to Parker that he was free to speak on the issue as he liked. National support for Parker began to rise, and Roosevelt praised his opponent&#x27;s telegram in private as &quot;bold and skillful&quot; and &quot;most adroit&quot;.

== Campaign ==

After receiving the nomination, Parker resigned from the bench. On August 10, he was formally visited at Rosemount by a delegation of party elders to inform him of his nomination. Parker then delivered a speech criticizing Roosevelt for his administration&#x27;s involvement in Turkish and Moroccan affairs and having failed to give a date on which the Philippines would become independent of American control. The speech was considered even by supporters to be impersonal and uninspiring. Historian Lewis L. Gould described the speech as a &quot;fiasco&quot; for Parker from which the candidate did not recover. After this initial speech, Parker retreated into a strategy of silence again, avoiding comment on all major issues.

Parker&#x27;s campaign soon proved to be poorly run as well. Parker and his advisors opted for a front porch campaign, in which delegations would be brought to Rosemount to see Parker speak on the model of McKinley&#x27;s successful 1896 campaign. However, due to Esopus&#x27;s remote location and the campaign&#x27;s inefficient use of funds to bring in delegates, Parker received few visitors. Rather than introducing issues that would differentiate the two parties, the Democrats preferred to emphasize Roosevelt&#x27;s character, portraying him as dangerously unstable. Parker&#x27;s campaign also failed to reach out to traditional Democratic voting blocs such as Irish Catholic immigrants. In contrast, Roosevelt&#x27;s campaign, headed by George Cortelyou, organized committees to appeal specifically to demographics including Jewish, black, and German-American voters. John Hay, Roosevelt&#x27;s Secretary of State, wrote of Parker&#x27;s poor showing to Henry Adams, calling it &quot;the most absurd political campaign of our time&quot;.

A month before the election, Parker became aware of the large volume of corporate donations Cortelyou had solicited for the Roosevelt campaign, and made &quot;Cortelyouism&quot; a theme of his speeches, accusing the president of being insincere in previous trust busting efforts. In late October, he also went on a speaking tour in the key states of New York and New Jersey, in which he reiterated the president&#x27;s &quot;shameless exhibition of a willingness to make compromise with dignity&quot;. Roosevelt, enraged, released a statement calling Parker&#x27;s criticisms &quot;monstrous&quot; and &quot;slanderous&quot;.

Parker&#x27;s attacks came too late to turn the election, however. On November 8, Roosevelt won in a landslide of 7,630,457 votes to Parker&#x27;s 5,083,880. Roosevelt carried every Northern and Western state, including Missouri, for a total of 336 electoral votes; Parker carried only the traditionally Democratic Solid South, accumulating 140 electoral votes. Parker telegraphed his congratulations to Roosevelt that night and returned to private life.

In Irving Stone&#x27;s 1943 book, &quot;They Also Ran&quot;, about defeated presidential candidates, the author stated that Parker was the only defeated presidential candidate in history never to have a biography written about him. Stone theorized that Parker would have been an effective president and the 1904 election was one of a few in American history in which voters had two first-rate candidates to choose from. Stone professed that Americans liked Roosevelt more because of his colorful style.

== Later life ==

=== Legal career ===
After the election, Parker resumed practicing law and served as the president of the American Bar Association from 1906 to 1907. He was a founding member of the New York County Lawyers&#x27; Association and served as the group&#x27;s president from 1909 to 1912. Parker was elected president of the New York State Bar Association on January 28, 1913. He served as the president of the NYSBA from 1913 to 1914.

Parker represented organized labor in several cases, most notably in &quot;Loewe v. Lawlor&quot;, popularly known as the &quot;Danbury Hatters&#x27; case&quot;. In the case, the fur hat manufacturer D. E. Loewe &amp; Company had attempted to enforce an open shop policy; when unions had subsequently boycotted the company, it sued the United Hatters of North America for violation of the Sherman Antitrust Act. The U.S. Supreme Court found for Loewe by ruling that the union had been acting in restraint of interstate commerce. Parker had more success representing Samuel Gompers and other labor leaders in &quot;Gompers v. United States&quot;, in which the Supreme Court overturned their convictions for contempt of court on statute of limitations grounds.
In 1913, Parker was appointed lead trial counsel in the impeachment of New York governor William &quot;Plain Bill&quot; Sulzer. Sulzer faced eight articles of impeachment, alleging that he made and filed a false statement regarding his campaign accounts, perjured himself in verifying the statement concerning his campaign accounts, bribed witnesses and fraudulently induced them to withhold evidence from the legislative committee investigating his misconduct, suppressed evidence by threatening witnesses, dissuaded a witness from appearing before the committee pursuant to a duly authorized subpoena, used campaign contributions to speculate in the stock market, promised and threatened to use his influence as governor to affect the votes or political actions of certain members of the general assembly and used his authority and influence as governor &quot;to affect the current prices of securities listed and selling on the New York Stock Exchange.&quot; Sulzer was found guilty of three charges (making and filing a false statement regarding his campaign accounts, perjuring himself in verifying the statement concerning his campaign accounts and suppressing evidence by threatening witnesses) and was ultimately removed from office.

=== Political activity and the election of 1912 ===
Parker later re-entered politics, managing John Alden Dix&#x27;s successful 1910 gubernatorial campaign. He announced his support for women&#x27;s suffrage in 1911, telling a group of women lawyers that he supported the suffrage movement &quot;most heartily.&quot; In 1913, he was counsel for the managers of the trial leading to the impeachment of Dix&#x27;s successor as governor, William Sulzer.

During that election year, Parker actively resisted what he viewed as dangerous positions regarding the nation&#x27;s judiciary held by men like Theodore Roosevelt, who initially sought the Republican nomination, and William Jennings Bryan, who still held considerable sway in the Democratic Party. Roosevelt had come out as early as 1910 in opposition to whom he called &quot;fossilized judges&quot; that struck down reform legislation as unconstitutional. By 1912, both Roosevelt and Bryan had called for amendments to enable the recall of judges and judicial decisions that the people at large deemed incorrect as a popular check on judicial review. Parker believed this proposal to be a danger to the nation&#x27;s constitutional order, siding with conservatives in the GOP like William Howard Taft and Elihu Root to oppose Roosevelt&#x27;s candidacy. Parker was elected to deliver the keynote address at the 1912 Democratic National Convention. He was elected against the opposition of Bryan, and the convention ultimately nominated Woodrow Wilson for president. While Wilson was more progressive than Parker&#x27;s preferred candidate, Champ Clark, and held the endorsement of Bryan, he also came out against judicial recall. The result was the triumph of a supreme view of judicial review in both the Democratic and Republican parties.

=== Death ===
Parker&#x27;s wife, Mary, died in 1917. He remarried in 1923 to Amelia Day &quot;Amy&quot; Campbell. On May 10, 1926, only a few days after recovering from bronchial pneumonia, Parker died from a heart attack while riding in his car through New York City&#x27;s Central Park, four days before his 74th birthday. He was survived by Mrs. Charles Mercer Hall, his daughter from his first wife, two grandchildren, and his second wife. He was buried in Wiltwyck Cemetery in Kingston.

<text>The house finch (Haemorhous mexicanus) is a North American bird in the finch family. It is native to Mexico and southwestern United States, but has since been introduced to the eastern part of North America and Hawaii; it is now found year-round in all parts of the United States and most of Mexico, with some residing near the border of Canada. There are estimated to be 40 million house finches across North America, making it the second-most populous finch, just behind the American goldfinch. The house finch and the other two American rosefinches (Cassin&#x27;s and purple finch) are placed in the genus &quot;Haemorhous&quot;.

==Description==
The house finch is a moderate-sized finch, long, with a wingspan of . Body mass can vary from , with an average weight of . Among standard measurements, the wing chord is , the tail is , the culmen is and the tarsus is .

Adults have a long, square-tipped brown tail and are a brown or dull-brown color across the back with some shading into deep gray on the wing feathers. Breast and belly feathers may be streaked; the flanks usually are. In most cases, adult males&#x27; heads, necks and shoulders are reddish. This color sometimes extends to the belly and down the back, between the wings. Male coloration varies in intensity with the seasons and is derived from the berries and fruits in its diet. As a result, the colors range from pale straw-yellow through bright orange (both rare) to deep, intense red. Adult females have brown upperparts and streaked underparts.

The house finch&#x27;s songs typically consist of a series of high-pitched musical jumbles ending with a distinct high note, &quot;wheer.&quot; Calls from flight include a soft &quot;cheet&quot; or &quot;wheat&quot;, with perched birds giving a more drawn-out version.

==Distribution and habitat==
House finches are mainly permanent residents throughout their range, some birds migrate to the south, with adult females moving longer distances than males. Their breeding habitat is urban and suburban areas across North America, as well as various semi-open areas in the west from southern Canada to the Mexican state of Oaxaca; the population in central Chiapas may be descended from escaped cagebirds. Analyses of nest records from house finches in California spanning more than a century found that egg‐laying occurred significantly earlier in warmer springs.

Originally only a resident of Mexico and the southwestern United States, house finches were introduced to eastern North America in the 1940s. The birds were sold illegally in New York City as &quot;Hollywood finches&quot;, a marketing artifice. To avoid prosecution under the Migratory Bird Treaty Act of 1918, vendors and owners released the birds. They have since become naturalized; in largely unforested land across the eastern U.S. they have displaced the native purple finch and even the non-native house sparrow. Sometime in the 19th century, they were introduced to Hawaii and are now abundant on all its major islands.

According to the Partners in Flight database, there are estimated to be 40 million house finches across North America.

Instances of naturalization originating in escapes or releases of cage birds have been recorded in Europe, such as in 2020 in Murcia, (Spain).

==Feeding==

House finches forage on the ground or in vegetation normally. They primarily eat grains, seeds and berries, being voracious consumers of weed seeds such as nettle and dandelion; included are incidental small insects such as aphids. They are frequent visitors to bird feeders throughout the year, particularly if stocked with sunflower or nyjer seed, and will congregate at hanging nyjer sock feeders. The house finch is known to damage orchard fruit and consume commercially grown grain, but is generally considered an annoyance rather than a significant pest.

==Breeding==

Nests are made in cavities, including openings in buildings, hanging plants, and other cup-shaped outdoor decorations. Sometimes nests abandoned by other birds are used. Nests may be re-used for subsequent broods or in following years. The nest is built by the female, sometimes in as little as two days. It is well made of twigs and debris, forming a cup shape, usually above the ground.

During courtship, the male will touch bills with the female. He may then present the female with choice bits of food, and if she mimics the behavior of a hungry chick, he may feed her. The male also feeds the female during breeding and incubation of the eggs, and raising of the young, and the male is the primary feeder of the fledglings (who can be differentiated from the females by the pin feathers remaining on their heads). Females are typically attracted to the males with the deepest pigment of red to their head, more so than the occasional orange or yellowish-headed males that sometimes occur.

The female lays clutches of eggs from February through August, two or more broods per year with 2 to 6 eggs per brood, most commonly 4 or 5. The egg laying usually takes place in the morning, at one egg per day. The eggs are pale bluish-green with few black spots and a smooth, somewhat glossy surface. In response to mite infestation, which has a more deleterious effect on male chicks than on females, the mother finch may lay eggs containing females first, to reduce the length of time male chicks are exposed to mites. This strategy increases the likelihood that representative numbers of both sexes will survive. The female incubates the eggs for 12 to 14 days. Shortly after hatching, she removes the empty eggshells from the nest. The hatchlings are pink with closed eyes and tufts of fluffy down. The female always feeds the young. The male usually joins in. The young are silent for the first seven or eight days, and subsequently start peeping during feedings. Initially, the mother carries fecal sacs out of the nest, but when the young become older, she no longer carries them all away, allowing droppings to accumulate around the edge of the nest. Before flying, the young often climb into adjacent plants and usually fledge at about 11 to 19 days after hatching. Dandelion seeds are among the preferred seeds for the young. Contrary to the way most birds, even ones with herbivorous leanings as adults, tend to feed their nestlings animal matter to give them the protein necessary to grow, house finches are one of the few birds who feed their young only plant matter.

House finches are aggressive enough to drive other birds away from places such as feeders.

==Threats==

The house finch may be infected by several parasites including &quot;Plasmodium relictum&quot; and &quot;Mycoplasma gallisepticum&quot;, which caused the population of house finches in eastern North America to crash during the 1990s.

The mite &quot;Pellonyssus reedi&quot; is often found on house finch nestlings, particularly for nests later in the season.

The brown-headed cowbird, a brood parasite, will lay its eggs in house finch nests, although the diet house finches feed their young is inadequate for the young cowbirds, which rarely survive.

In 2012, house finches positive for West Nile virus were found in northwestern Riverside County, CA.

== Status ==
The house finch is assessed as &quot;Least Concern&quot; on the IUCN Red List due to its extensive range, increasing population trend, and large population size, none of which approach Vulnerable thresholds. North American data indicate a substantial and statistically significant population increase (82.9% over 40 years, or 16.3% per decade) based on Breeding Bird Survey and Christmas Bird Count data.

<text>A direct-controlled municipality is the highest level classification for cities used by unitary states, with status equal to that of the provinces in the respective countries. A direct-controlled municipality is similar to, but not the same as, a federal district, a common designation in various countries for a municipality that is not part of any state, and which usually hosts some governmental functions. Usually direct-controlled municipality are under central government control with limited power. In some cases, a similar term in federal states is the federal city. 

Many countries have adopted this system with some different variations. Geographically and culturally, many of the municipalities are enclaves in the middle of provinces. Some occur in strategic positions in between provinces.

<text>Tyneside is a built-up area across the banks of the River Tyne in Northern England. Residents of the area are commonly referred to as Geordies. The whole area is surrounded by the North East Green Belt. 

The population of Tyneside as published in the 2011 census was 774,891, making it the eighth most-populous urban area in the United Kingdom. In 2013, the estimated population was 832,469.

Politically, the area is mainly covered by the metropolitan boroughs of Newcastle-upon-Tyne, Gateshead, North Tyneside and South Tyneside. The boroughs on the Tyne are joint with Wearside which is in both the ceremonial counties of Durham (Chester-le-Street) and Tyne and Wear.

==Settlements==

The ONS 2011 census had 774,891 census respondents inside the &quot;Tyneside Built-up Area&quot; or &quot;Tyneside Urban Area&quot;. These figures are a decline from 879,996; this loss was mainly due to the ONS reclassifying Hetton-le-Hole, Houghton-le-Spring, Chester-le-Street and Washington in the Wearside Built-up Area instead of Tyneside. In both the 2001 and 2011 census the area was given the following subdivisions; Gateshead, Jarrow and Tynemouth had boundary changes:

==Geordies==
The people of Newcastle, called &quot;Geordies&quot;, have a reputation for their distinctive dialect and accent. Newcastle may have been given this name, a local diminutive of the name &quot;George&quot;, because their miners used George Stephenson&#x27;s safety lamp (invented in 1815 and called a &quot;Georgie lamp&quot;) to prevent firedamp explosions, rather than the Davy lamp used elsewhere. An alternative explanation relates that during the Jacobite risings of 1715 and 1745 the people of Newcastle declared their allegiance to the Hanoverian Kings of Great Britain, George I and George II; whereas the rest of the county of Northumberland, to the north, stood loyal to James Francis Edward Stuart.

==Coal production==
While Newcastle upon Tyne had been an important local centre since Roman times, and was a major local market town from the Middle Ages, the development of Newcastle and Tyneside is owed to coal mining. Coal was first known to be dug in Tyneside from superficial seams in around 1200, but there is some evidence from Bede&#x27;s writings that it may have been dug as early as 800 AD. Coal was dug from local drift mines and bell pits, and although initially only used locally, it was exported from the port of Newcastle from the mid 14th century onwards. Tyneside had a strategic advantage as far as the coal trade was concerned, because collier brigs could be loaded with coal on the Tyne and could sail down the east coast to London. In fact, the burgesses of Newcastle formed a cartel, and were known as the Hostmen. The Hostmen were able gain a monopoly over all of the coal exported from Tyneside, a monopoly which lasted a considerable time. A well-known group of workers on the river were the keelmen who handled the keels, boats that carried the coal from the riverbanks to the waiting colliers.

==Steel and shipbuilding==

The Derwent (valley), a major tributary of the Tyne that rises in County Durham, saw the development of the steel industry from around 1600 onwards. This was led by German immigrant cutlers and sword-makers, probably from around Solingen, who fled from religious persecution at home and settled in the then village of Shotley Bridge, near Consett.

The combination of coal and steel industries in the area was the catalyst for further major industrial development in the 19th century, including the shipbuilding industry; at its peak, the Tyneside shipyards were one of the largest centres of shipbuilding in the world and built an entire navy for Japan in the first decade of the 20th century. There is still a working shipyard in Wallsend.

==Professional competitive rowing on the Tyne==
From early in the 19th century, it was a custom to hold boat races on the Tyne. The Tyne had a large number of keelmen and wherrymen, who handled boats as part of their jobs. As on the River Thames, there were competitions to show who was the best oarsman. As a wherryman did not earn very much, competitive rowing was seen as a quick way of earning extra money. Regattas were held, and provided modest prizes for professionals, but the big money was made in challenge races, in which scullers or boat crews would challenge each other to a race over a set distance for a side stake. The crews would usually have backers, who would put up the stake money, as they saw the chance of financial gain from the race. In the days before mass attendances at football matches, races on the river were enormously popular, with tens of thousands attending. Betting would go on both before and during a race, the odds changing as the fortunes of the contestants changed. Contestants who became champions of the Tyne would often challenge the corresponding champions of the River Thames, and the race would be arranged to take place on one of the two rivers.

Rivalry between the Tyne and the Thames was very keen, and rowers who upheld the honour of the Tyne became local heroes. Three such oarsmen, who came from humble backgrounds and became household names in the North East, were Harry Clasper, Robert Chambers and James Renforth. Clasper was a champion rower in fours, as well as an innovative boat designer and a successful rowing coach. Chambers and Renforth were oarsmen who excelled at sculling. Both held the World Sculling Championship at different times.
The popularity of all three men was such that when they died, many thousands attended their funeral processions, and magnificent funeral monuments were provided by popular subscription in all three cases. At the end of the 19th century professional competitive rowing on the Tyne began a gradual decline and would die out entirely leaving the amateur version.

==Rapper dancing==
Despite its rapid growth in the Industrial Revolution, Tyneside developed one peculiar local custom, the rapper sword dance, which later spread to neighbouring areas of Northumberland and County Durham.

==Industrial decline and regeneration==
During the 1970s and 1980s, there was major industrial decline in the traditional British heavy industries, and Tyneside was hit hard. High unemployment rates and the national [Thatcher] government&#x27;s resolve to push through with economic transformation led to great social unrest with strikes and occasional rioting in depressed areas.

From the late 1980s onward, an improving national economy and local regeneration helped the area to recover, and although unemployment is still a problem compared with some other areas of Britain, expansion of new industries such as tourism, science and high-technology, has fuelled local development, especially in Newcastle upon Tyne and Gateshead.

<text>Prenzlau (, formerly also Prenzlow) is a town in Brandenburg, Germany, the administrative seat of Uckermark District. It is also the centre of the historic Uckermark region.

==Geography==
The town is located on the Ucker river, about north of Berlin. Prenzlau station—which opened in 1863—is a stop on the Angermünde–Stralsund railway line.

==History==
Settled since Neolithic times, the Prenzlau area from the 7th century AD was the site of several gords erected by the Polabian Slavs called Ukrani. In the late 12th century, the Dukes of Pomerania had the region colonized by Low German settlers.

Prenzlau itself, named after Slavic &quot;Premyslaw&quot;, was first mentioned in 1187. It received town privileges by Duke Barnim I of Pomerania in 1234. When Duke Barnim signed the Treaty of Landin with the Ascanian margraves of Brandenburg in 1250, Prenzlau was already a fortified town with walls and moats, four parish churches and a monastery. Together with Berlin-Cölln, Frankfurt and Stendal, it ranked among the largest towns in the margraviate.

The Prenzlau and the Uckermark region were devastated during the Thirty Years&#x27; War. From the late 17th century onwards French Huguenot refugees settled here and an economic recovery started. Also a garrison town, Prenzlau was again ravaged by passing troops during the Seven Years&#x27; War and the Napoleonic Wars. In the mid 19th century, several citizens emigrated to Australia, where they founded the town of Prenzlau, Queensland west of Brisbane.

In World War II the Oflag II-A prisoner-of-war camp was located just south of Prenzlau on the main road to Berlin. The town centre was largely destroyed. The East German authorities had it rebuilt with large panel Plattenbau buildings.

<text>Tynemouth () is a coastal town in the metropolitan borough of North Tyneside, in Tyne and Wear, England. It is located on the north side of the mouth of the River Tyne, hence its name. It is 8 mi (13 km) east-northeast of Newcastle upon Tyne. The medieval Tynemouth Priory and Castle stand on a headland overlooking both the mouth of the river and the North Sea, with the town centre lying immediately west of the headland.

Historically part of Northumberland until 1974, the town was a county borough which included the nearby town of North Shields.

At the 2021 census the Tynemouth built-up area as defined by the Office for National Statistics (which also includes North Shields) had a population of 60,605.

==History==
The headland towering over the mouth of the River Tyne has been settled since the Iron Age. The Romans may have occupied it as a signal station, though it is just north of the Hadrian&#x27;s Wall frontier (the Roman fort and supply depot of Arbeia stands almost opposite it on the southern headland of the Tyne). In the 7th century a monastery was built in Tynemouth and later fortified. The headland was known as &quot;Pen Bal Crag&quot;. The monastery was sacked by the Danes in 800, rebuilt, and destroyed again in 875, but by 1083 it was again operational.

Three kings are reported to have been buried within the monastery: Oswin, King of Deira (651); Osred II, King of Northumbria (792); and, for a time, Malcolm III, King of Scots (1093). Three crowns still adorn the North Tyneside coat of arms. (North Tyneside Council, 1990).

The queens of Edward I and Edward II stayed in the Castle and Priory while their husbands were campaigning in Scotland. King Edward III considered it to be one of the strongest castles in the Northern Marches. After the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314, Edward II fled from Tynemouth by ship.

A village had long been established in the shelter of the fortified Priory, and around 1325 the prior built a port for fishing and trading. This led to a dispute between Tynemouth and the more powerful Newcastle over shipping rights on the Tyne, which continued for centuries. For more history see North Shields.

Prince Rupert of the Rhine landed at Tynemouth in August 1642 on his way to fight in the English Civil War.

Tynemouth was an ancient parish. It was divided into eight townships, being Chirton, Cullercoats, Monkseaton, Murton, North Shields, Preston, Whitley and a Tynemouth township covering the area around the original settlement. Such townships were also made civil parishes in 1866. In the 19th century North Shields rapidly expanded from a small fishing village into a town, overtaking Tynemouth itself to become the largest settlement in the parish. North Shields was given improvement commissioners in 1828 to administer the growing town; the commissioners&#x27; district covered the whole of the North Shields township and parts of the Chirton, Preston and Tynemouth townships.

In 1832 a parliamentary borough (constituency) called Tynemouth and North Shields was created, covering the whole of the townships of Tynemouth, North Shields, Chirton, Cullercoats and Preston. The same area was made a municipal borough in 1849, which was just called Tynemouth despite North Shields being the larger settlement within the borough. The first town clerk was Thomas Carr Leitch.

The borough council based itself at Tynemouth Town Hall at the junction of Howard Street and Saville Street in North Shields, which had been built for the old North Shields improvement commissioners in 1844/5. In 1904 the borough was elevated to become a county borough, making it independent from Northumberland County Council for local government purposes, whilst remaining part of Northumberland for judicial and lieutenancy purposes. The county borough was abolished in 1974, when the area became part of North Tyneside in the new metropolitan county of Tyne and Wear.

Tynemouth was listed in the 2018 &quot;Sunday Times&quot; report on best places to live in Northern England.

==Climate==
Tynemouth has a very moderated oceanic climate heavily influenced by its position adjacent to the North Sea. As a result of this, summer highs are subdued and, according to the Met Office 1981–2010 data, average around . Due to its marine influence, winter lows especially are very mild for a Northern English location. Sunshine levels of 1515 hours per annum are in the normal range for the coastal North East, which is also true for the relatively low amount of precipitation at .

== Attractions and amenities ==

===Beaches===

In the late 18th century, sea-bathing from Tynemouth&#x27;s east-facing beaches became fashionable. King Edward&#x27;s Bay and Tynemouth Longsands are very popular with locals and tourists alike.

King Edward&#x27;s Bay (possibly a reference to Edward II) is a small beach on the north side of the Priory, sheltered on three sides by cliffs and reached by stairways or, by the fit and adventurous who understand the weather and tides, over the rocks round the promontories on the north or south sides.

Longsands is the next beach to the north, an expanse of fine sand long, lying between the former Tynemouth outdoor swimming pool and Cullercoats to the north. The outdoor pool opened in 1925 and was considered a major tourist attraction in its heyday.

In 2013, Longsands was voted one of the best beaches in the country by users of the world&#x27;s largest travel site TripAdvisor. TripAdvisor users voted the beach the UK&#x27;s fourth favourite beach in its 2013 Travellers&#x27; Choice Beaches Awards. The beach was also voted the 12th best in Europe.
Prior&#x27;s Haven is a small beach within the mouth of the Tyne, sheltered between the Priory and the Spanish Battery, with the pier access on its north side. It was popular with Victorian bathers and is now home to Tynemouth Rowing Club and the local sailing club.

===Tynemouth Priory and Castle===

A medieval Benedictine priory at the mouth of the time. Founded in the 7th century, a castle was added around 1095. The priory was surrender to the king during the Dissolution of the Monasteries in 1539 A lighthouse was built in the 1660s and it was adapted as a barracks in the 18th century. New buildings for breech loading guns were built at the end of the 19th century. These can be seen during a visit to the site. The Priory and Castle is now run by English Heritage. 


===Front Street===

A statue of Queen Victoria by Alfred Turner, unveiled on 25 October 1902, is situated at the edge of the Village Green which is home to the War Memorials for the residents of Tynemouth lost during the Second Boer War of 1899–1902. Designed by A.B. Plummer, it was unveiled on 13 October 1903 by William Brodrick, 8th Viscount Midleton.

The larger central memorial is made of white granite with a cruciform column rising from between four struts in a contemporary design for its time. The front face has a relief sword and wreath carved onto it with the inscription below. The other three faces hold the honour roll for those lost during both World Wars. It was unveiled in 1923. DM O&#x27;Herlihy was named as the original designer but a press report stated that a Mr Steele designed the monument and credited O&#x27;Herlihy with preparatory works on the village green. The 82 names from World War II were added in 1999.

Tynemouth Clock Tower on Front Street was erected in 1861 by William Scott, esq., a native of the town. Designed by Oliver and Lamb with carvings by Robert Beall, the tower housed a clock by Joyce of Whitchurch. At ground level there were drinking fountains (and drinking troughs for dogs) on the north and south sides, a marine barometer (by Negretti and Zambra) to the west and an access door to the east. Made of polychrome bricks and ashlar, the tower (which has been Grade II listed since 1986) is described as being in the Venetian Gothic style.

===Kings Priory School===
Located on Huntingdon Place, Kings Priory School (formerly The King&#x27;s School and Priory Primary School) is a co-educational academy with over 800 pupils aged between 4 and 18. Though founded in Jarrow in 1860, the school moved to its present site in Tynemouth in 1865 originally providing a private education for local boys. The school has an Anglican tradition, but admits students of all faiths. Formerly a fee-paying independent school, in 2013 the school merged with the local state Priory Primary School to become a state academy.

Former King&#x27;s School was named in reference to the three ancient kings buried at Tynemouth Priory: Oswin, Osred and Malcolm III. Its most famous old boy is Stan Laurel, one half of the comedy duo Laurel and Hardy. Hollywood film director Sir Ridley Scott, and racing driver Jason Plato also attended the school.

=== Tynemouth Pier and lighthouse ===
This massive stone breakwater extends from the foot of the Priory some 900 yards (810 metres) out to sea, protecting the northern flank of the mouth of the Tyne. It has a broad walkway on top, popular with Sunday strollers. On the lee side is a lower level rail track, formerly used by trains and cranes during the construction and maintenance of the pier. At the seaward end is a lighthouse.

The pier&#x27;s construction took over 40 years (1854–1895). In 1898 the original curved design proved inadequate against a great storm and the centre section was destroyed. The pier was then rebuilt in a straighter line and completed in 1909. A companion pier at South Shields protects the southern flank of the river mouth.
A lighthouse had built on the old North Pier (first lit in 1895, it displayed three lights mounted vertically: green over white over red, with a range of ); however, when the pier had to be rebuilt to a new design, an entirely new lighthouse was required. The work was undertaken by Trinity House, beginning in 1903; the lighthouse was finished before the pier itself, and was first lit on 15 January 1908. The revolving optic, manufactured by Barbier, Bénard, et Turenne, displayed a flash three times every ten seconds; it remains in use today. The light source was an incandescent oil vapour lamp, which (together with the optic) produced a 70,000 candle-power light with a range of . The lighthouse was also equipped with a reed fog signal, powered by compressed air, which was mounted &#x27;on the cupola&#x27;; it sounded one long blast every ten seconds. It was manned by four keepers, with two on duty at any one time. In September 1961 a new, more powerful electric light was installed by the Tyne Improvement Commissioners (powered from the mains). Then in 1967 the lighthouse (by then staffed by six keepers on rotation) was automated; a diesel generator was installed along with an electric foghorn.

Before the pier was built, a lighthouse stood within the grounds of Tynemouth Priory and Castle. It was demolished in 1898. It stood on the site of the now-disused Coastguard Station.

On 20 October 2023, the dome of the lighthouse was &quot;forcibly removed by the relentless combination of sea and wind&quot; caused by Storm Babet.

=== The Spanish Battery ===

The headland dominates the river mouth and is less well known as Freestone Point. Settlements dating from the Iron Age and later have been discovered here. The promontory supposedly takes its name from Spanish mercenaries who manned guns there in the 16th century to defend Henry VIII&#x27;s fleet. Most of the guns had been removed by 1905. It is now a popular vantage point for watching shipping traffic on the Tyne.

=== The Collingwood Monument ===

Beyond the Battery, and commanding the attention of all shipping on the Tyne, is the giant memorial to Lord Collingwood, the Collingwood Monument. Collingwood was Nelson&#x27;s second-in-command at the Battle of Trafalgar, who completed the victory after Nelson was killed in action. Erected in 1845, the monument was designed by John Dobson and the statue was sculpted by John Graham Lough. The figure is some tall and stands on a massive base incorporating a flight of steps flanked by four cannons from HMS &quot;Royal Sovereign&quot; – Collingwood&#x27;s ship at Trafalgar.

=== The Black Middens ===

These rocks in the Tyne near the Monument are covered at high water, and the one rock that can sometimes be seen then is called Priors Stone. Over the centuries they have claimed many ships whose crew &quot;switched off&quot; after safely negotiating the river entrance. In 1864, the Middens claimed five ships in three days with many deaths, even though the wrecks were only a few yards from the shore. In response a meeting was held in North Shields Town Hall in December 1864 at which it was agreed that a body of men should be formed to assist the Coastguard in the event of such disasters. This led to the foundation of the Tynemouth Volunteer Life Brigade.

===Tynemouth Aquarium===

Undersea aquatic park, containing seahorses, sharks, giant octopus, frogs, otters and many other creatures. Its Seal Cove is a purpose-built outdoor facility providing an environment for a captive-bred colony of harbour seals. The pool includes rocky haul-out areas and underwater caves, specially created to ensure marine mammals are kept in near natural conditions. It was previously known as the Blue Reef Aquarium Tynemouth.

==Transport==

Maintaining transport links between Tynemouth and Newcastle is Tynemouth Metro station, originally opened in 1882 as a mainline station catering for the thousands of holiday-makers who flocked to the Tynemouth beaches. Its ornate Victorian ironwork canopies have earned it Grade II listed status. They were restored in 2012, and the station now provides a venue for a weekend &quot;flea market&quot;, book fairs, craft displays, coffee shops, restaurants, exhibitions and other events.

Tynemouth is the end point for the long Coast to Coast Cycle Route from Whitehaven or Workington in Cumbria.

==Demographics==
In 2011, Tynemouth had a population of 67,519, compared to 17,056 a decade earlier. This is mainly because of boundary changes rather than an actual population increase: for example, North Shields was a separate urban subdivision in 2001 and had a population of over 36,000. Shiremoor was also a different urban subdivision, with a population of almost 5000 in 2001. The 2011 definition of the town of Tynemouth includes North Shields along with some areas in the north west of the town such as Shiremoor or West Allotment. However using 2011 methodology boundaries Tynemouth had a population of 60,881 in 2001 based on the 2011 boundaries. Thus Tynemouth has become larger in both area and population.

== Religion ==
Tynemouth&#x27;s Parish Church is the Church of the Holy Saviour in the Parish of Tynemouth Priory. It was built in 1841 as a chapel of ease to the main Anglican church in the area, Christ Church, North Shields. In Front Street there were two other churches, the Catholic Parish of Our Lady &amp; St Oswin&#x27;s, opened in 1899, and also Tynemouth Congregational Church, which closed in 1973 and is now a shopping arcade.

==Notable visitors==

Charles Dickens visited Tynemouth and wrote in a letter from Newcastle, dated 4 March 1867:

&#x27;We escaped to Tynemouth for a two hours&#x27; sea walk. There was a high wind blowing, and a magnificent sea running. Large vessels were being towed in and out over the stormy bar with prodigious waves breaking on it; and, spanning the restless uproar of the waters, was a quiet rainbow of transcendent beauty. the scene was quite wonderful. We were in the full enjoyment of it when a heavy sea caught us, knocked us over, and in a moment drenched us and filled even our pockets.&#x27;

Giuseppe Garibaldi sailed into the mouth of the River Tyne in 1854 and briefly stayed in Huntingdon Place. The house is marked by a commemorative plaque.

Lewis Carroll states in the first surviving diary of his early manhood, that he met &#x27;three nice little children&#x27; belonging to a Mrs Crawshay in Tynemouth on 21 August 1855. He remarks: &#x27;I took a great fancy to Florence, the eldest, a child of very sweet manners&#x27;.

Algernon Charles Swinburne arrived hot foot from Wallington Hall in December 1862 and proceeded to accompany William Bell Scott and his guests, probably including Dante Gabriel Rossetti on a trip to Tynemouth. Scott writes that as they walked by the sea, Swinburne declaimed his &quot;Hymn to Proserpine&quot; and &quot;Laus Veneris&quot; in his strange intonation, while the waves &#x27;were running the whole length of the long level sands towards Cullercoats and sounding like far-off acclamations&#x27;.

Peter the Great of Russia is reputed to have stayed briefly in Tynemouth while on an incognito visit to learn about shipbuilding on the Tyne. He was fascinated by shipbuilding and Western life. Standing and with body-guards, he would not have been troubled by the locals.

<text>The Warsaw Radio Mast () was a radio mast located near Gąbin, Poland, and was the world&#x27;s tallest structure at 2,120 ft (646.30 m) from 1974 until its collapse on 8 August 1991. The mast was designed for extreme height in order to broadcast Communist propaganda around the world, including to the remotest areas such as Antarctica. As of 2023, it was the third-tallest manmade structure ever built, after the Burj Khalifa tower in the United Arab Emirates in 2009, and Merdeka 118 tower in Malaysia in 2022.

Designed by Jan Polak, its construction started with earthworks for the foundations on 5 July 1969, while construction of the tower itself began on 18 October 1972 with a ceremony, and was completed on 18 May 1974. Its transmitter, whose installation started in October 1973, entered regular service on 22 July 1974. The opening of the mast was met with extensive celebration and was covered by the Polish Film Chronicle. The tower was used by Warsaw Radio-Television (Centrum Radiowo-Telewizyjne) for radio broadcasting on a frequency of AM-LW (longwave) 227 kHz before 1 February 1988 and 225 kHz (1332m) afterwards. Its base was above sea level. Because there was a potential difference of 120 kV between the mast and ground, it stood on a -high insulator. It operated as a mast radiator (half-wave radiator), so its height was half of its 1332m broadcasting wavelength. The signals from its 2 MW transmitters could be received across essentially the entire globe. The structure&#x27;s weight was debated, with some Polish sources claiming it weighed .

The mast was designed for national pride, mainly because of the height of the mast, which made it the tallest structure in the world at the time, surpassing the KVLY-TV mast in Blanchard, North Dakota, US. It was also designed to broadcast the &quot;propaganda of the successes.&quot; Due to the mast&#x27;s height, listeners from all over the world could tune in to Polish radio broadcasts, including those in remote places such as Antarctica.

The official name of the facility was &quot;Radiofoniczny Ośrodek Nadawczy w Konstantynowie&quot; (Radiophonic Transmission Centre Konstantynów), &quot;Radiowe Centrum Nadawcze w Konstantynowie&quot; (Radio Transmission Centre Konstantynów; RCN Konstantynów) or &quot;Warszawska Radiostacja Centralna (WRC) w Gąbinie&quot; (Warsaw Central Radio Station Gąbin). It broadcast Polskie Radio&#x27;s Program I (unofficially referred to as &quot;Jedynka&quot;). The transmitter was so powerful that Program I could be received in parts of Canada and the United States.

==Construction==
The mast&#x27;s location, which was finalised to be in Gąbin, was chosen because of its high soil conductivity and the need for a position in the centre of Poland. A large amount of research was utilised to decide where to build the mast, which included factors such as soil resistance, ownership of property, and the quality of infrastructure (especially roads).

The mast was initially constructed to replace the Raszyn radio transmitter, which had been constructed in 1931 and rebuilt in 1949. The Raszyn transmitter was designed to cover the Eastern Borderlands, and so Polish authorities did not consider reception in the Recovered Territories. When it became evident that Raszyn could not provide coverage to the entire country, the station received an increase of power to 500 kW, but this too failed. In the late 1960s it was decided to construct a new central transmitter at the geographical centre of Poland (post-WWII borders). Gąbin was chosen not only due to its central position, but also its high soil conductivity. During storms, when the mast could not operate, the signal would be temporarily switched to Raszyn, a process that was eased thanks to direct phone lines from RCN Konstantynów to both Raszyn and the energy sector.

The Warsaw radio mast was a guyed steel lattice mast of equilateral triangular cross section, with a face width of . The vertical steel tubes forming the structures of the mast had a diameter of 245 millimetres (10 in); the thickness of the walls of these tubes varied between 8–34 mm (0.31–1.33 in) depending on height. The mast consisted of 86 sections, each of which had a length of . The mast had 3 arrays of guy wires, each array attached to the mast at 5 levels: , , , , and above ground. Each guy was fixed on a separate anchor block at the ground and was in diameter. To prevent the guy wires from interfering with the radio transmissions, the guys were insulated at regular intervals. The weight of guys and insulators used to anchor the mast was . An elevator and separate protected ladders were installed in the interior of the mast to facilitate access to the various mast components, including the aircraft warning lamps. The elevator was designed by , a Swedish company, and took 45 minutes to reach the top. The lift was nicknamed &quot;Alimak&quot;, as a nod to the company that designed it. Safety was a priority, so &quot;Alimak&quot; had a safety procedure, where it could be stopped, but this precaution never had to be used. A maximum of 3 people could ride up the elevator, although sources claim it would be crowded. The elevator was powered by an internal combustion engine. An area for maintenance supplies was present, in order to transport materials such as lightbulbs for the aircraft warning lights. Inspection crews travelled up it once per month to replace light bulbs, and watch for cracks in the steel. If a crack was found, the transmitters were turned off and the Raszyn radio mast took over the broadcast. Any cracks were then fixed by welders from Mostostal Zabrze by making patches out of sheet metal.

In the lower half of the mast, there was a vertical steel tube, attached to the mast&#x27;s outer structure with large insulators. This tube was grounded at the bottom, and connected electrically to the mast structure by an adjustable metal bar at a height of when the tower transmitted on 227 kHz longwave and at a height of when it switched to 225 kHz on 1 February 1988. This technique allowed adjusting the impedance of the mast for the transmitter and worked by applying a direct current ground at a point of low radio frequency voltage, to conduct static charge to ground without diminishing the radio energy. Static electrical charge can build up to high values, even at times of no thunderstorm activity, when such tall structures are insulated from ground. Use of this technique provides better lightning protection than using just a spark gap at the mast base, as it is standard at most mast radiators insulated against ground.

The mast was equipped in 16 levels with arrays of six air traffic warning lights with 200 W power. At the top there was a flashing beacon consisting of two lamps of 1,000 W.
A long special overhead radio frequency transmission line of 120 ohms was used to transfer the signal from the transmitter building to the mast. Featuring an asymmetrical coaxial power supply, it consisted of the inner &quot;hot&quot; core of 24 copper wires connected to a small ring at each post, and each was connected by three insulated cables to the outer ring. The outer ring served as the support of another set of 24 wires, known as the &quot;outer braid.&quot; The transmission line was monitored whenever the mast was in operation; at night the line was illuminated with street lights, to prevent trespassers from electrocuting themselves. The transmitter building had a volume of and was approximately from the mast. The transmitter consisted of two 1,000 kW units built by Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie. An atomic clock was used to generate the transmission frequency in order to provide a very accurate, stable signal source which could be used as a frequency standard by anyone within signal range. The transmitters had the ability for each component to be turned on manually or all be started with one button. The transmitters were capable of receiving remote input, but the devices needed to utilize this were not implemented in Konstanynów. When high-voltage power was switched on, the transmitter was protected by two locked doors and crews were informed by way of illuminating a red lightbulb. This lightbulb was controlled by a photodiode that would additionally flash the lightbulb if a short-circuit in the transmitter was detected. 

The station, which had an area of , also had a lattice tower of rectangular cross-section close to the transmitter building. This tower was used to provide a radio link for programme feeds from the studio, which ran from the Palace of Culture and Science, Warsaw via a radio relay tower at Wiejca. At Konstantynów, the signal was focused on a parabolic dish at 30 dB and was captured in a horn antenna at the focal point of the dish. Upon reaching the transmitters, a dehydrator ensured that no condensation occurred. The transmission building used a NEC radio set and the TN60 multiple telephony system. This allowed for 60 telephone lines connected to the Polska Poczta, Telegraf i Telefon fixed-line telephone network to be run off the station but the full possibilities of this system were never used.

To supply power to the station, a 110 kV substation was built. The substation was over-engineered due to the strategic importance of the station as Poland&#x27;s central transmitter: although the power consumption of the transmitting station was large at an estimated 6,000 kW, the substation was capable of supplying much more. Six small towers were erected around the periphery of the station&#x27;s grounds in order to support aircraft warning lamps where the guy ropes were located.

==Problems==
Approximately ten years after completion of the mast, inspections revealed structural damage caused by wind-induced oscillations at the mast, the backstay insulators and the guys. Repair work was considered to be expensive and difficult, so replacement of the mast by a stronger construction of the same height was considered; but this was not carried out due to Poland&#x27;s worsening economic situation. Repainting was started in 1988, but could not be completed because not enough paint was available. A lack of equipment and training of maintenance teams led to a severe degradation of the mast&#x27;s condition by the late 1980s. An inspection in May 1989 found that 13 strands of the upper guys had been fractured and, by the time of the collapse of the mast in 1991, seven guy wire insulators had been damaged. Another cause of the structure&#x27;s deterioration was insufficient knowledge of the strains exerted on structures of such a great height. Additionally, on 23 March 1992, Adam Brzeziński, managing director of Mostostal Zabrze at the time, stated to Dziennik Zachodni that Mostostal should have prepared a technical report before starting construction on the risks faced during repair of a strained mast.

==Staff==
The manager of the radio station from 1974 to 1980 was Zygmunt Duczmalewski (died 2016). His successor, Witold Czowgan (1947–2017), served as the manager from 1983 to 1986.

The mast had a total of 30 engineers and technicians. It also had 15 administrative staff. Because a large portion of the staff was recruited from around Poland, a new block of flats was built 30 km away in Sochaczew to accommodate the staff. More specialised staff were accommodated in the guest rooms of the transmission building. The facility also had a complement of guards, hired directly by the Ministry of Interior, mainly from the local population of Konstantynów.

==Collapse==

At 16:00 UTC on 8 August 1991 a catastrophic failure led to the collapse of the mast. During replacement of frayed guy wires, one of the main cables had to be replaced by two temporary ones. After the main cable had been disconnected and before the temporary ones could be connected, a gust of wind twisted the temporarily unmoored tower, pulling loose the other guys. The unsupported mast first bent, and then snapped at roughly half its height. The helix building and the transmitter building and transmitter were not damaged. The transmission line was also unaffected, but it was dismantled shortly after the collapse of the tower, leaving only the sustaining poles in place. A mobile crane belonging to Mostostal Zabrze was destroyed when the tower collapsed. As the foreman did not keep a construction log it was hard to determine the exact events that led to the catastrophe. The construction coordinator and the division chief of the company responsible for maintaining the mast were found liable for the collapse, and both were sentenced to 2.5 years in prison. The construction manager&#x27;s sentence was eventually shortened to six months.

Since the collapse of the Warsaw radio mast, the tallest structure in Poland has been the FM radio and TV transmission mast at Olsztyn-Pieczewo, tall.

==Replacement==
After the collapse, Polskie Radio used the old Raszyn transmitter with its mast near Warsaw, which had been used since 1978 for daytime transmissions of a second Polish broadcasting service programme in the longwave range on the frequency AM-LW 198 kHz, for transmissions on AM-LW 225 kHz with a power of 500 kW. It is not possible to transmit from Raszyn on AM-LW (long wave) 198 kHz/1515 metres and 225 kHz/1333 metres simultaneously due to risk of interference, so the transmissions on the second longwave frequency AM-LW (long wave) 198 kHz had to be discontinued until either a second longwave broadcasting transmitting facility was built in Poland or a special frequency switch, which would allow transmissions on both frequencies, was installed at the Raszyn transmitter. The latter, simpler solution would have decreased the effectiveness and reliability of both transmitters and was therefore rejected.

Because of the importance of Polish longwave transmitters to Polish people abroad, as early as April 1992 the Polish government planned to rebuild the mast at Konstantynów. In September 1995 the Polish government was set to rebuild the mast. Although refurbishment of the old foundations, which could be reused, had already started, the rebuilding of the mast was cancelled due to protests by local residents, who claimed that radiation from the mast was a health hazard. While the accuracy of these claims has not been verified, a new site for the transmitter was sought. Several other locations were considered, but due to the continuing resistance of nearby inhabitants (backed by the Solidarity trade union), planned mast height and transmitter range were both greatly reduced, and an old military site just southeast of Solec Kujawski was chosen. There were once again protests in this location, but tensions were eased when Polish Radio donated PLN 3.5 million towards the development of the local community. There, a new longwave transmission facility was built in 1998–1999, with a transmitter of 1200 kW output power for the frequency AM-LW (long wave) 225 kHz. This facility, which was inaugurated on 4 September 1999, uses one 330 metre (1083 ft) and one 289 metre (948 ft) grounded top-fed masts as aerials.

After the inauguration of the transmitter at Solec Kujawski, the transmitter at Raszyn was again used for transmitting on the frequency AM-LW (long wave) 198 kHz for until it ended LW transmissions in 2009.

At Gąbin, there was also a radio link relay tower, commissioned in 1974, last used in 1998 and demolished in 2021. It was used as a radio relay link to receive Polskie Radio Program I programming from the microwave link at the RTCN Warszawa (PKiN) transmitter to Konstantynów. In front of the entrance to the mast, a cross was erected by local residents associated with the now defunct &quot;Association for the Protection of Human Life at the Highest Mast of Europe.&quot;

From 2001 to 2012, the facility was managed by the Real Estate department of Telekomunikacja Polska S.A. (TP SA). Due to the 2012 merger of TP and Orange Polska, the facility is now managed by the Orange Polska SA Real Estate Sales Office. The facility is protected against unauthorised access, as it is worth approximately PLN 3,650,000 (approx. $1 million USD).

==State since 1991==
Except for the mast and the radio-frequency transmission line that led to it, nearly all components of the facility remained in place, unused and slowly deteriorating. Some local people have visited the remains of the mast on anniversaries, such as the 20th anniversary in 2011.

In 2018, the Swiss Brown, Boveri &amp; Cie 2 piece radio transmitter (Brown Boveri SL 61 B3) was donated by Orange Polska, a Polish telecommunications provider, to the &quot;Babice Transatlantic Radio Station Culture Park Association&quot;. It was then transferred to Warsaw for renovation. There are plans to restore the transmitter for active usage in a museum.

At the end of September 2021, the Konstantynów relay tower was decommissioned and demolished.

== In popular culture ==
The Warsaw radio mast was added to The Guinness Book of World Records; the record was given for the mast&#x27;s height, which was later surpassed by the Burj Khalifa.

The Warsaw Radio mast&#x27;s successor and predecessor, the Raszyn Mast, was depicted on several stamps issued by the Polish government.

The &quot;Polish Film Chronicle&quot;, a Polish newsreel typically shown in cinemas before a movie, showed the Warsaw Radio Mast.
