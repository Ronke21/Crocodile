<text>The Society of Antiquaries of London (SAL) is a learned society of historians and archaeologists in the United Kingdom. It was founded in 1707, received its royal charter in 1751 and is a registered charity. It is based at Burlington House in Piccadilly, a building owned by the UK government.

The modern membership of around 3,300 fellows mostly consists of archaeologists and historians, who can use the post-nominal letters FSA after their names.


==Membership==

Fellows (full members) of the society are elected by existing fellows and are entitled to use the post-nominal letters FSA after their names. The election procedure is selective and fellowship is regarded as recognition of significant achievement in the fields of archaeology, antiquities, history or heritage. A nomination must be made by an existing fellow and endorsed by between five and twelve other fellows. A secret ballot of the membership is then held; to be successful a candidate must receive two &quot;yes&quot; votes for every &quot;no&quot; vote.

 the society has a membership of around 3,300 fellows.

In June 2022, the society introduced a lower tier of &quot;affiliate membership&quot;, open to anyone on payment of an annual subscription. Benefits include access to and borrowing rights from the society&#x27;s library.

==History and antecedents==
A precursor organisation, the College of Antiquaries, was founded and functioned largely as a debating society until it was forbidden to do so by King James I in 1614.

The first informal meeting of the modern Society of Antiquaries occurred at the Bear Tavern on The Strand on 5 December 1707. This early group, conceived by John Talman, John Bagford, and Humfrey Wanley, sought a charter from Queen Anne for the study of British antiquities; its projected ventures included a series of 35 books to be issued. The proposal for the society was to be advanced by Robert Harley, 1st Earl of Oxford, but his dismissal from government caused it to become idle. The formalisation of proceedings occurred in 1717, and the first minutes at the Mitre Tavern, Fleet Street, are dated 1 January 1718. The first secretary of the revived society was William Stukeley.

Those attending these early meetings examined objects, gave talks, and discussed theories of historical sites. Reports on the dilapidation of significant buildings were also produced. The society was also concerned with the topics of heraldry, genealogy, and historical documents. In 1751, a successful application for a charter of incorporation was sought by its long-serving vice president Joseph Ayloffe, which allowed the society to own property.

The society began to gather large collections of manuscripts, paintings, and artefacts, housing such gifts and bequests while a proper institution for them did not exist. The acquisition of a large group of important paintings in 1828 preceded the establishment of the National Portrait Gallery by some 30 years. A gift of Thomas Kerrich, which included portraits of Edward IV, Mary Tudor, and two of Richard III, reveal anti-Tudor bias in their later portrayal.

Following the London Blitz, the society organised many of the excavations of Roman and medieval ruins exposed by the bombing of the City, with annual surveys performed every year between 1946 and 1962. Among other finds, they discovered the previously unknown London citadel () in the northwest corner of the London Wall. The findings were summarized in 1968 by W. F. Grimes.

In 1962, the society became the owner of the house and land of Kelmscott Manor, the former home of William Morris.

In 2007, the society celebrated its tercentennial year (recognising the first, less formal meetings) with an exhibition at the Royal Academy entitled &quot;Making History: Antiquaries in Britain 1707–2007&quot;. The tercentenary was also marked by two substantial publications: a collection of seventeen scholarly essays on the parallel themes of the history of the society itself and changing interpretations of the material relics of the past over the three centuries of its existence; and the illustrated catalogue of the exhibition, which included fifteen shorter thematic essays by various expert contributors.

The society faced controversy in 2019, when its council was unable to pass a resolution to eject fellow Hubert Chesshyre. In 2015, a trial of the facts had reached the verdict that Chesshyre had committed child sexual abuse offences, leading to a recommendation from the Honours Committee that he be stripped of honours. The council issued a statement saying that it &quot;regrets that a majority of those present [at the vote] did not see fit to support the resolution&quot; and that the incident showed &quot;need to modernise the society&#x27;s statutes and governance procedures&quot;.

In 2020, following comments made by David Starkey on slavery and genocide, the society announced that they were modernising their procedures for dealing with behaviour which runs contrary to their values. Starkey subsequently resigned his fellowship.

==Library==

The society&#x27;s library is the major archaeological research library in the UK. Having acquired material since the early 18th century, the Library&#x27;s present holdings number more than 100,000 books and around 800 currently received periodical titles. The catalogue include rare drawings and manuscripts, such as the inventory of all Henry VIII&#x27;s possessions at the time of his death.

As the oldest archaeological library in the country, the Library holds an outstanding collection of British county histories, a fine collection of 18th- and 19th-century books on the antiquities of Britain and other countries and an exceptionally wide-ranging collection of periodical titles (British and foreign) with runs dating back to the early to mid-19th century.

==Publications==
===&quot;Vetusta Monumenta&quot;===
In 1718, the society began to publish a series of illustrated papers on ancient buildings, sites, and artefacts, mainly those of Britain and usually written by members of the society, under the title &quot;Vetusta Monumenta&quot;. The series continued to appear on an irregular basis until 1906. The papers were published in a folio format, and were notable for the inclusion of finely engraved views and reproductions of artefacts.
An engraver was employed by the society from its inception – the earliest were George Vertue, James Basire and successors – labouring to produce the copperplate used in the printing of the folio editions. The prints were often large and appealing, and were intended to satisfy popular demand for archæological subject matter; their quasi-scientific illustrations were often inset with multiple viewpoints of architectural details. A fellow of the society, Richard Gough (director 1771 to 1791), sought to expand and improve publication of the society&#x27;s research, motivated by the steady dilapidation of examples of Gothic architecture.

A later series of oversize issues was used to accommodate the format of some historical works, which the society had commissioned to be reproduced by Edward Edwards and Samuel Hieronymus Grimm in water-colour in 1771; the first issues of these were mostly done by Basire. The first of these with a reproduction of a 16th-century oil painting of the historic scene at the Field of the Cloth of Gold. The paper for this series required a larger size than was available, the manufacturer James Whatman was instructed to create a sheet ; the name given to this format is &quot;Antiquarian&quot;. The engraving of the plate, measuring by , required two years to complete. The standard printing for this series was 400 prints; the plates were carefully stored by the society and used occasionally to fulfil later requests; only three of the seven plates still exist.

===&quot;Archaeologia&quot;===
The society&#x27;s first journal was &quot;Archaeologia&quot; (full title: &quot;Archaeologia; or, Miscellaneous Tracts relating to Antiquity&quot;), of which the first volume appeared, in a quarto format, in 1770. The journal mainly contained papers that had been delivered at the society&#x27;s meetings: in the early years these included many delivered in previous decades that had remained unpublished. &quot;Archaeologia&quot; continued to appear on a more or less regular basis until after the Second World War, but then became increasingly irregular, some of its ground having been taken by the society&#x27;s other journals. Only two volumes were published in the 1980s (vols 107 and 108), and two in the 1990s (vols 109 and 110, published in 1991 and 1992 respectively). The society&#x27;s tercentennial collection of essays of 2007 was technically published as vol. 111 of &quot;Archaeologia&quot;. No print volumes have been published since.

In January 2023, &quot;Archaeologia&quot; was relaunched as an occasional digital journal, to serve as a vehicle for open access research papers of a length falling above the upper limit of 10,000 words for the &quot;Antiquaries Journal&quot;. 

===&quot;Proceedings&quot; and &quot;Antiquaries Journal&quot;===
In 1843 the society took the decision to publish some of its proceedings in a second periodical in a smaller format, initially unillustrated, which could appear on a more frequent basis than &quot;Archaeologia&quot;: it was entitled &quot;Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of London&quot;. The first part appeared in 1844 (containing papers delivered in 1843), and this first series continued until 1859, by which time four volumes had appeared. A second series was then begun, in which 32 volumes appeared down to 1920.

In 1921 &quot;Proceedings&quot; was superseded by a new annual journal, the &quot;Antiquaries Journal&quot;. This continues to the present day, volume 101 having been published in 2021.

===&quot;Salon&quot;===
Since the end of 2001, the society has published a fortnightly online newsletter called &quot;Salon&quot; (Society of Antiquaries Online Newsletter).

<text>Aline Chrétien (; May 14, 1936 – September 12, 2020) was a Canadian academic administrator who was the wife of Canada&#x27;s 20th prime minister, Jean Chrétien. She previously worked as a secretary, payroll manager, and model. In her later life, she was a trained pianist with The Royal Conservatory of Music.

==Early life and family==
Aline Chaîné was born on May 14, 1936, in Shawinigan, Quebec, the eldest child of Yvonne (Bellemar) and Albert Chaîné. Her mother was a hairdresser; her father worked at a power plant. She left school at age 16 and never attended university but took correspondence courses while working as a secretary. She was also employed as a payroll manager and did some modelling for local clothing stores.

Chaîné married lawyer Jean Chrétien on September 10, 1957. They had two sons, Hubert and Michel Chrétien (adopted), and one daughter, France Chrétien Desmarais. After her husband was elected to Parliament, she taught herself English, Italian, and Spanish, and became fluent in those languages in addition to her native French.

==Spouse of the prime minister==
Chrétien was active in a number of charitable organizations from the time that her husband was first elected to the House of Commons of Canada in 1963. In addition to her keen interest in languages, she took piano courses during her 50s and became an advocate for The Royal Conservatory of Music in Toronto. Jean Chrétien purchased a grand piano for her using the damages he was awarded in a libel case against &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;.

On November 5, 1995, an intruder, André Dallaire, broke into the prime minister&#x27;s residence at 24 Sussex Drive, in Ottawa, Ontario. Awakened next to her sleeping husband, Chrétien confronted the intruder at their bedroom door. Seeing that he was armed with a large knife, she slammed the door and locked it, then woke her husband.

Jean Chrétien often sought out his wife&#x27;s advice. &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; magazine in 1996 listed her first among his most influential advisors, saying &quot;Never mind calling her the power behind the throne—she shares the seat of power.&quot; In the same magazine in 2000, Allan Fotheringham described Jean and Aline Chrétien as the two &quot;most powerful&quot; politicians in Canada, above Eddie Goldenberg and Jean Pelletier.

Jean Chrétien has publicly stated that his wife was his key advisor. He once joked that Canada was run exclusively by women: the monarch (Queen Elizabeth II), the governor general (Adrienne Clarkson), and the chief justice (Beverley McLachlin) were all women, and Madame Chrétien was pulling the strings of the prime minister. He made similar jokes often, once telling a reporter that he did not know when the next election would be because he had not yet asked Aline to set a date.

In her role as the prime minister&#x27;s spouse, Chrétien went to the memorial of the victim of the W. R. Myers High School shooting in 1999, along with Alberta Premier Ralph Klein, Opposition Leader Preston Manning, and the Attorney General of Canada Anne McLellan. She was awarded her first honorary degree from Laurentian University in 2003.

==Later years==
On September 22, 2010, Chrétien was named as the first chancellor of Laurentian University, a bilingual educational institution in Sudbury, Ontario.

Chrétien suffered from Alzheimer&#x27;s disease. She died on September 12, 2020, at her home in Lac des Piles near Shawinigan. She was 84 and had celebrated her 63rd wedding anniversary two days before. No cause of death was disclosed.

<text>Sinhala ( ; Sinhala: , , ), sometimes called Sinhalese ( ), is an Indo-Aryan language primarily spoken by the Sinhalese people of Sri Lanka, who make up the largest ethnic group on the island, numbering about 16 million. It is also the first language of about 2 million other Sri Lankans, as of 2001. It is written in the Sinhala script, a Brahmic script closely related to the Grantha script of South India. The language has two main varieties, written and spoken, and is a notable example of the linguistic phenomenon known as diglossia.

Sinhala is one of the official and national languages of Sri Lanka. Along with Pali, it played a major role in the development of Theravada Buddhist literature.

Early forms of the Sinhala language are attested to as early as the 3rd century BCE. The language of these inscriptions, still retaining long vowels and aspirated consonants, is a Prakrit similar to Magadhi, a regional associate of the Middle-Indian Prakrits that had been spoken during the lifetime of the Buddha. The most closely-related languages to Sinhala are the Vedda language and the Maldivian languages; the former is an endangered indigenous creole still spoken by a minority of Sri Lankans, which mixes Sinhala with an isolate of unknown origin. Old Sinhala borrowed various aspects of Vedda into its main Indo-Aryan substrate.

== Etymology ==

&quot;Sinhala&quot; () is a Sanskrit term; the corresponding Middle Indo-Aryan (Eḷu) word is .
The name is a derivative of , the Sanskrit word for &#x27;lion&#x27; . The name is sometimes glossed as &#x27;abode of lions&#x27;, and attributed to a supposed former abundance of lions on the island.

== History ==
According to the chronicle , written in Pali, Prince Vijaya of the Vanga Kingdom and his entourage merged in Sri Lanka with later settlers from the Pandya kingdom. In the following centuries, there was substantial immigration from Eastern India, including additional migration from the Vanga Kingdom (Bengal), as well as Kalinga and Magadha. This influx led to an admixture of features of Eastern Prakrits.

=== Stages of historical development ===
The development of Sinhala is divided into four epochs:

* Elu Prakrit (3rd c. BCE to 4th c. CE)
* Proto-Sinhala (4th c. CE to 8th c. CE)
* Medieval Sinhala (8th c. CE to 13th c. CE)
* Modern Sinhala (13th c. CE to the present)

=== Phonetic development ===
The most important phonetic developments of Sinhala include:
* the loss of aspiration as a distinction for plosive consonants (e.g. &quot;eating&quot; corresponds to Sanskrit , Hindustani )
* the loss of original vowel length distinction; long vowels in the modern language are found in loanwords (e.g. &quot;exam&quot; &lt; Sanskrit ) or as a result of sandhi, either after elision of intervocalic consonants (e.g. &quot;to put&quot; &lt; ) or in originally compound words.
* the simplification of consonant clusters and geminate consonants into geminates and single consonants respectively (e.g. Sanskrit &quot;time&quot; &gt; Sinhalese Prakrit &gt; Modern Sinhala )
* development of to and/or (e.g. / &quot;moon&quot; corresponds to Sanskrit ) and development of to (e.g. &quot;web&quot; corresponds to Sanskrit )
* development of prenasalized consonants from Sanskrit nasal + voiced stops (as in )
* retention of initial and , the latter only shared with Kashmiri (as in and &quot;fit, proper&quot; &lt; Sanskrit )

=== Western vs. Eastern Prakrit features ===
According to Wilhelm Geiger, an example of a possible Western feature in Sinhala is the retention of initial which developed into in the Eastern languages (e.g. Sanskrit &quot;twenty&quot;, Sinhala , Hindi ). This is disputed by Muhammad Shahidullah who says that Sinhala Prakrit branched off from the Eastern Prakrits prior to this change. He cites the edicts of Ashoka, no copy of which shows this sound change.

An example of an Eastern feature is the ending for masculine nominative singular (instead of Western ) in Sinhalese Prakrit. There are several cases of vocabulary doublets, one example being the words (&quot;fly&quot;) and (&quot;flea&quot;), which both correspond to Sanskrit but stem from two regionally different Prakrit words (Western Prakrits) and (as in Eastern Prakrits like Pali).

=== Pre-1815 Sinhalese literature ===


In 1815, the island of Ceylon came under British rule. During the career of Christopher Reynolds as a Sinhalese lecturer at the School of African and Oriental Studies, University of London, he extensively researched the Sinhalese language and its pre-1815 literature. The Sri Lankan government awarded him the Sri Lanka Ranjana medal for his work. He wrote the 377-page &quot;An anthology of Sinhalese literature up to 1815&quot;, selected by the UNESCO National Commission of Ceylon

=== Substratum influence in Sinhala ===
According to Wilhelm Geiger, Sinhala has features that set it apart from other Indo-Aryan languages. Some of the differences can be explained by the substrate influence of the parent stock of the Vedda language. Sinhala has many words that are only found in Sinhala, or shared between Sinhala and Vedda and not etymologically derivable from Middle or Old Indo-Aryan. Possible examples include for leaf in Sinhala and Vedda (although others suggest a Dravidian origin for this word.), for pig in Vedda and offering in Sinhala. Other common words are for wild duck, and for stones (in toponyms used throughout the island, although others have also suggested a Dravidian origin). There are also high frequency words denoting body parts in Sinhala, such as for head, for leg, for neck and for thighs, that are derived from pre-Sinhalese languages of Sri Lanka. The oldest Sinhala grammar, , written in the 13th century CE, recognised a category of words that exclusively belonged to early Sinhala. The grammar lists (to see) and (fort or harbour) as belonging to an indigenous source. is the source of the name of the commercial capital Colombo.

===South Dravidian substratum influence===

The consistent left branching syntax and the loss of aspirated stops in Sinhala is attributed to a probable South Dravidian substratum effect. This has been explained by a period of prior bilingualism:

=== Influences from neighbouring languages ===
In addition to many Tamil loanwords, several phonetic and grammatical features also present in neighbouring Dravidian languages set modern spoken Sinhala apart from its Northern Indo-Aryan relatives. These features are evidence of close interactions with Dravidian speakers. Some of the features that may be traced to Dravidian influence are:
* the loss of aspiration
* the use of the attributive verb of &quot;to say&quot; as a subordinating conjunction with the meanings &quot;that&quot; and &quot;if&quot;, e.g.:

=== European influence ===
As a result of centuries of colonial rule, interaction, settlement, intermarriage and assimilation, modern Sinhala contains many Portuguese, Dutch and English loanwords.

=== Influences on other languages ===
Macanese Patois or Macau Creole (known as to its speakers) is a creole language derived mainly from Malay, Sinhala, Cantonese, and Portuguese, which was originally spoken by the Macanese people of the Portuguese colony of Macau. It is now spoken by a few families in Macau and in the Macanese diaspora.

The language developed first mainly among the descendants of Portuguese settlers who often married women from Malacca and Sri Lanka rather than from neighbouring China, so the language had strong Malay and Sinhala influence from the beginning.
== Accents and dialects ==
The Sinhala language has different types of variations which are commonly identified as dialects and accents. Among those variations, regional variations are prominent. Some of the well-known regional variations of Sinhala language are:

# The Uva Province variation (Monaragala, Badulla).
# The southern variation (Matara, Galle).
# The up-country variation (Kandy, Matale).
# The Sabaragamu variation (Kegalle, Balangoda).

===Uva regional variation in relation to grammar===
People from Uva province also have a unique linguistic variation in relation to the pronunciation of words. In general, Sinhala singular words are pluralized by adding suffixes like , , or . But when it comes to Monaragala, the situation is somewhat different as when nouns are pluralized a nasal sound is added.

===Southern variation===
The Kamath language (an indigenous language of paddy culture) used by the Southerners is somewhat different from the &#x27;Kamath language&#x27; used in other parts (Uva, Kandy) of Sri Lanka as it is marked with a systematic variation; &#x27;boya&#x27; at the end of the majority of nouns as the examples below show.

:Crops: (bran)
:           (banana)
:Tools: (bucket)
:Other words: (home)

Here the particular word &#x27;boya&#x27; means &#x27;a little&#x27; in the Southern region and at the end of most of nouns, &#x27;boya&#x27; is added regularly. This particular word &#x27;boya&#x27; is added to most words by the Southern villages as a token of respect towards the things (those things can be crops, tools etc.) they are referring to.

===Kandy, Kegalle and Galle people===
Even though the Kandy, Kegalle and Galle people pronounce words with slight differences, the Sinhalese can understand the majority of the sentences.

===Diglossia===
In Sinhala there is distinctive diglossia, where the literary language and the spoken language differ from each other in significant ways. While the lexicon can vary continuously between formal and informal contexts, there is a sharp contrast between two distinct systems for syntax and morphology. The literary language is used in writing for all forms of prose, poetry, and for official documents, but also orally for TV and radio news broadcasts. The spoken language is used in everyday life and spans informal and formal contexts. Religious sermons, university lectures, political speeches, and personal letters occupy an intermediate space where features from both spoken and literary Sinhala are used together, and choices about which to include give different impressions of the text.

A number of syntactic and morphological differences exist between the two varieties. The most apparent difference is the absence of subject-verb agreement in spoken Sinhala. Agreement is the hallmark of literary Sinhala, and is the sole characteristic used in determining whether a given example of Sinhala is in the spoken or literary variety. Other distinctions include:
* The copula (), in equational sentences is required in literary but prohibited in spoken Sinhala.
* The accusative and locative cases are missing in colloquial spoken Sinhala (but recovered in formal speech).

==Writing system==


The Sinhala script, , is based on the ancient Brahmi script, and is thus a Brahmic script along with most Indian scripts and many Southeast Asian scripts. The Sinhala script is closely related to Grantha script and Khmer script, but it has also taken some elements from the related Kadamba script.

The writing system for Sinhala is an abugida, where the consonants are written with letters while the vowels are indicated with diacritics () on those consonants, unlike alphabets like English where both consonants and vowels are full letters, or abjads like Urdu where vowels need not be written at all. Also, when a diacritic is not used, an &quot;inherent vowel&quot;, either or , is understood, depending on the position of the consonant within the word. For example, the letter ක on its own indicates , realized as in stressed syllables and in unstressed syllables. The other monophthong vowels are written: කා , කැ , and කෑ (after the consonant); කි and කී (above the consonant); කු and කූ (below the consonant); කෙ and කේ (before the consonant); and lastly, කො and කෝ (surrounding the consonant). For simple without a following vowel, a vowel-cancelling diacritic called (, ) is used, creating ක් .

There are also a few diacritics for consonants, such as in special circumstances, although the tendency now is to spell words with the full letter ර , with a on whichever consonant has no vowel following it. One word that is still spelt with an &quot;r&quot; diacritic is ශ්‍රී, as in (). The &quot;r&quot; diacritic is the curved line under the first letter (&quot;ශ&quot; → &quot;ශ්‍ර&quot;). A second diacritic representing the vowel sound completes the word (&quot;ශ්‍ර&quot; → &quot;ශ්‍රී&quot;).

Several of these diacritics occur in two or more forms, and the form used depends on the shape of the consonant letter. Vowels also have independent letters, but these are only used at the beginning of words where there is no preceding consonant to add a diacritic to.

The complete script consists of about 60 letters, 18 for vowels and 42 for consonants. However, only 57 (16 vowels and 41 consonants) are required for writing colloquial spoken Sinhala (). The rest indicate sounds that have been merged in the course of linguistic change, such as the aspirates, and are restricted to Sanskrit and Pali loan words. One letter (), representing the sound , is attested in the script, although only a few words using this letter are known ().

The Sinhala script is written from left to right, and is mainly used for Sinhala. It is also used for the liturgical languages Pali and Sanskrit, which are important in Buddhism and academic works. The alphabetic sequence is similar to those of other Brahmic scripts:

== Phonology ==

Sinhala has a smaller consonant inventory than most Indo-Aryan languages, but simultaneously has a larger vowel inventory than most. As an insular Indo-Aryan language, it and Dhivehi have features divergent from rest of the Indo-Aryan languages. Sinhala&#x27;s nasal consonants are unusual among Indo-Aryan languages for lacking the retroflex nasal while retaining nasals in the other four positions. Sinhala and Dhivehi are together unique for having prenasalised consonants, which are not found in any other Indo-Aryan language.

=== Consonants ===
Sinhala has so-called prenasalised consonants, or &#x27;half nasal&#x27; consonants. A short homorganic nasal occurs before a voiced stop, it is both shorter than a nasal alone and shorter than a sequence of nasal plus stop. The nasal is syllabified with the onset of the following syllable, which means that the moraic weight of the preceding syllable is left unchanged. For example, &#x27;copper&#x27; contrasts with &#x27;boil&#x27;.

All consonants other than the prenasalised consonants, , , , and can be geminated (occur as double consonants), but only between vowels. In contexts that otherwise trigger gemination, prenasalised consonants become the corresponding nasal-voiced consonant sequence (e.g. is replaced with ).

 is found in learned borrowings from Sanskrit, including in the honorific (), found in phrases including the country&#x27;s name, Sri Lanka (, ). is restricted to loans, typically for English. They are commonly sometimes replaced by and respectively. Some speakers use , as in English, and some use due to its similarity to the native .

=== Vowels ===

Sinhala has seven vowel qualities, with a phonemic vowel length distinction between long and short for all qualities, giving a total inventory of 14 vowels. The long vowel is not present in native Sinhala words, but instead is found in certain English loanwords. Like in non-rhotic dialects of English, this long vowel can be represented by the short vowel followed by an (), as in (&quot;shirt&quot;).

 and have a largely complementary distribution, found primarily in stressed and unstressed syllables, respectively. However, there are certain contrasting pairs between the two phonemes, particularly between homographs (&quot;shoulder&quot;) and (&quot;to do&quot;). In writing, and are both spelt without a vowel sign attached to the consonant letter, so the patterns of stress in the language must be used to determine the correct pronunciation. Stress is largely predictable and only contrastive between words in relatively few cases, so this does not present a problem for determining the pronunciation of a given word.

Most Sinhala syllables are of the form CV. The first syllable of each word is stressed, with the exception of the verb (&quot;to do&quot;) and all of its inflected forms where the first syllable is unstressed. Syllables using long vowels are always stressed. The remainder of the syllables are unstressed if they use a short vowel, unless they are immediately followed by one of: a CCV syllable, final (), final (), or a final consonant without a following vowel. The sound is always stressed in nouns, adjectives, and adverbs, and so is not pronounced except in the word (&quot;forty&quot;), where the initial is stressed and the final is unstressed.

Nasalisation of vowels is common in certain environments, particularly before a prenasalised consonant. Nasalised and exist as marginal phonemes, only present in certain interjections.

=== Phonotactics ===

Native Sinhalese words are limited in syllable structure to (C)V(C), V̄, and CV̄(C), where V is a short vowel, V̄ is a long vowel, and C is a consonant. Exceptions exist for the marginal segment CC. Prenasalised plosives are restricted to occurring intervocalically, and cannot end a syllable. Much more complicated consonant clusters are allowed in loan words, particularly from Sanskrit and English, an example being (&quot;question&quot;). Words cannot end in nasals other than . Because of historical loss of the fricative in the suffix , at the end of a word behaves as its own syllable.

== Morphology ==
=== Nominal morphology ===
The main features marked on Sinhala nouns are case, number, definiteness and animacy.

==== Cases ====
Sinhala distinguishes several cases. The five primary cases are the nominative, accusative, dative, genitive, and ablative. Some scholars also suggest that it has a locative and instrumental case. However, for inanimate nouns the locative and genitive, and instrumental and ablative, are identical. In addition, for animate nouns these cases formed by placing (&quot;with the hand&quot;) and (&quot;near&quot;) directly after the nominative.

The brackets with most of the vowel length symbols indicate the optional shortening of long vowels in certain unstressed syllables.

==== Number marking ====
Forming plurals in Sinhala is unpredictable. In Sinhala animate nouns, the plural is marked with &quot;-o(ː)&quot;, a long consonant plus &quot;-u&quot;, or with &quot;-la(ː)&quot;. Most inanimates mark the plural through disfixation. Loanwords from English mark the singular with &quot;ekə&quot;, and do not mark the plural. This can be interpreted as a singulative number.

On the left hand side of the table, plurals are longer than singulars. On the right hand side, it is the other way round, with the exception of paːrə &quot;street&quot;. [+Animate] lexemes are mostly in the classes on the left-hand side, while [-animate] lexemes are most often in the classes on the right hand.

==== Indefinite article ====
The indefinite article is for animates and for inanimates. The indefinite article exists only in the singular, where its absence marks definiteness. In the plural, (in)definiteness does not receive special marking.

=== Verbal morphology ===
Sinhala distinguishes three conjugation classes.
Spoken Sinhala does not mark person, number or gender on the verb (literary Sinhala does). In other words, there is no subject–verb agreement.

== Syntax ==

* Left-branching language (see branching), which means that determining elements are usually put in front of what they determine (see example below).
* An exception to this is formed by statements of quantity which usually stand behind what they define.

* SOV (subject–object–verb) word order, common to most left-branching languages.
* As is common in left-branching languages, it has no prepositions, only postpositions (see Adposition).

* Sinhala has no copula. There are two existential verbs, which are used for locative predications, but these verbs are not used for predications of class-membership or property-assignment, unlike English &quot;is&quot;.

* There are almost no conjunctions as English &quot;that&quot; or &quot;whether&quot;, but only non-finite clauses that are formed by the means of participles and verbal adjectives.
== Semantics ==

There is a four-way deictic system (which is rare): There are four demonstrative stems (see demonstrative pronouns):
# &quot;here, close to the speaker&quot;
# &quot;there, close to the person addressed&quot;
# &quot;there, close to a third person, visible&quot;
# &quot;there, close to a third person, not visible&quot;

===Use of ()===
Sinhalese has an all-purpose odd suffix () which when suffixed to a pronoun creates a formal and respectful tone in reference to a person. This is usually used in referring to politicians, nobles, and priests.

e.g. () - you (vocative, when addressing a minister, high-ranking official, or generally showing respect in public etc.)

===Discourse===

Sinhala is a pro-drop language: Arguments of a sentence can be omitted when they can be inferred from context. This is true for subject—as in Italian, for instance—but also objects and other parts of the sentence can be &quot;dropped&quot; in Sinhala if they can be inferred. In that sense, Sinhala can be called a &quot;super pro-drop language&quot;, like Japanese.

==Vocabulary==

In informal contexts, Sinhala slang may be integrated into the vocabulary used.

<text>Ischia ( , , ) is a volcanic island in the Tyrrhenian Sea. It lies at the northern end of the Gulf of Naples, about from the city of Naples. It is the largest of the Phlegrean Islands. Although inhabited since the Bronze Age, as a Greek emporium it was founded in the 8th or 9th century BCE, and known as , Pithekoūsai (Monkey Island).

Roughly trapezoidal in shape, it measures approximately east to west and north to south and has about of coastline and a surface area of . It is almost entirely mountainous; the highest peak is Mount Epomeo, at . The island is very densely populated, with 60,000 residents (more than 1,300 inhabitants per square km). Ischia is the name of the main &quot;comune&quot; of the island. The other &quot;comuni&quot; of the island are Barano d&#x27;Ischia, Casamicciola Terme, Forio, Lacco Ameno and Serrara Fontana.

==Geology and geography==
The roughly trapezoidal island is formed by a complex volcano immediately southwest of the Campi Flegrei area at the western side of the Bay of Naples. The eruption of the trachytic Green Tuff Ignimbrite about 56,000 years ago was followed by the formation of a caldera comprising almost the entire island and some of the surrounding seabed. The highest point of the island, Monte Epomeo (), is a volcanic horst consisting of green tuff that was submerged after its eruption and then uplifted. Volcanism on the island has been significantly affected by tectonism that formed a series of horsts and grabens; resurgent doming produced at least of uplift during the past 33,000 years. Many small monogenetic volcanoes formed around the uplifted block. Volcanism during the Holocene produced a series of pumiceous tephras, tuff rings, lava domes, and lava flows. The last eruption of Ischia, in 1302, produced a spatter cone and the Arso lava flow, which reached the NE coast.

The surrounding waters including gulfs of Gaeta, Naples and Pozzuoli are both rich and healthy, providing a habitat for around 7 species of whales and dolphins including gigantic fin and sperm whales. Special research programmes on local cetaceans have been conducted to monitor and protect this bio-diversity.

From its roughly trapezoidal shape, the island is approximately 18 nautical miles from Naples, 10 km wide from east to west, 7 km from north to south, with a coastline of 43 km and an area of approximately 46.3 km2. The highest elevation is Monte Epomeo, standing at 788 meters and located in the center of the island. This is an horst, a tectonic volcano, meaning a block of the Earth&#x27;s crust that has been uplifted compared to the surrounding crust due to magmatic pressure (horst is a German term meaning &quot;rock&quot;). Monte Epomeo is mistakenly thought of as a volcano, although it lacks any volcanic characteristics. Island volcanism, in fact, is particularly prevalent along the fractures that border the horst, namely Monte Epomeo.

Strabo reports what the Greek historian Timeo said about a tsunami that occurred in Ischia shortly before his time. Following the volcanic activity of Epomeo, &quot;...the sea receded for three stages; afterwards (...) it turned back again and its ebb tide submerged the island (...) those who lived on the mainland fled from the coast into the interior of Campania&quot; (Geography V, 4, 9). Cumae, not far from that coast, in Greek means &quot;wave&quot;. Volcanic activity on Ischia has generally been characterized by eruptions that were not very significant and occurred at great intervals. After eruptions in Greek and Roman times, the last one occurred in 1302 in the eastern sector of the island with a brief flow (known as Arso) reaching the sea.

==Name==

The Greeks called their colony on the island Pithekoussai (Πιθηκοῦσσαι), from which the Latin name Pithecusa was derived. The name has an uncertain etymology. According to Ovid (Metamorphoses 14.92) and the Alexandrian historian Senagora, the name would derive from pithekos, monkey, and refer to the myth of the Cercopes, inhabitants of the Phlegraean islands transformed by Zeus into monkeys. More plausible is the interpretation of Pliny the Elder (Nat. Hist. 111, 6.82), who instead derives the name from pythos, amphora, a theory supported by archaeological finds that testify to the Greek-Italic production of ceramics (and in particular of wine amphorae) on the island and in the Gulf of Naples.
It has also been proposed that the name describes a characteristic of the island, rich in pine forests. &quot;Pitueois&quot; (rich in pines), &quot;pituis&quot; (pine cone), &quot;pissa, pitta&quot; (resin) appear as descriptive terms from which Pithekoussai could derive, meaning &quot;island of resin,&quot; an important substance used, among other things, to waterproof wine vessels. The name Aenaria, also used by the Latins, is linked to metallurgical workshops (from aenus, metal) located on the eastern coast, under the castle.

The first evidence of the island&#x27;s current toponym dates back to the year 812, in a letter from Pope Leo III in which he informs Emperor Charlemagne of devastations that occurred in the area, calling the island Iscla maior: &quot;Ingressi sunt ipsi nefandissimi Mauri [...] in insulam, quae dicitur Iscla maiore, non longe a Neapolitana urbe.&quot; Some scholars connect the term to the Phoenician word, and therefore Semitic i-schra, &quot;black island.&quot; The Phoenician presence on the island is archaeologically documented from a very ancient era and, as reported by Moscati (an Italian historian), in the spread in Campania and southern Etruria, since the 8th century BC, of objects of Egyptian production or inspiration, &quot;the Phoenician merchants settled in Ischia and then frequented the Tyrrhenian coasts&quot; certainly played a part.

On the other hand, the modern &quot;Island of Ischia&quot; could derive from the Latin &quot;insula visca&quot; – compare the Greek noun (ϝ)ἰξός, (w)ixós, (mistletoe) and the adjective (ϝ)ἰξώδης, (w)ixṓdēs, (viscous, sticky), which as usual have lost the initial digamma. In favor of this theory could be the fact that in the same area, at the foot of Vesuvius covered with pines, the popular name of Herculaneum was &quot;Resìna,&quot; perhaps reminiscent of an ancient market for this product, similarly to the toponym &quot;Pizzo&quot; in Calabria, from where the best resin, the &quot;pece brettia&quot; obtained from the pines of the nearby Sila, came from.

Virgil poetically referred to it as &quot;Inarime&quot; and still later as &quot;Arime&quot;. Martianus Capella followed Virgil in this allusive name, which was never in common circulation: the Romans called it &quot;Aenaria&quot;, the Greeks, , &quot;Pithekoūsai&quot;.

&quot;(In)arime&quot; and &quot;Pithekousai&quot; both appear to derive from words for &quot;monkey&quot; (Etruscan &quot;arimos&quot;, Ancient Greek , &quot;píthēkos&quot;, &quot;monkey&quot;). However, Pliny derives the Greek name from the local clay deposits, not from &quot;píthēkos&quot;; he explains the Latin name &quot;Aenaria&quot; as connected to a landing by Aeneas (&quot;Princeton Encyclopedia&quot;). If the island actually was, like Gibraltar, home to a population of monkeys, they were already extinct by historical times as no record of them is mentioned in ancient sources.

==History==

===Ancient times===
An acropolis site of the Monte Vico area was inhabited from the Bronze Age, as Mycenaean and Iron Age pottery findings attest. Euboean Greeks from Eretria and Chalcis arrived in the 8th century BC to establish an emporium for trade with the Etruscans of the mainland. This settlement was home to a mixed population of Greeks, Etruscans, and Phoenicians. Because of its fine harbor and the safety from raids afforded by the sea, the settlement of Pithecusae became successful through trade in iron and with mainland Italy; in 700 BC Pithecusae was home to 5,000–10,000 people.

The ceramic Euboean artifact inscribed with a reference to &quot;Nestor&#x27;s Cup&quot; was discovered in a grave on the island in 1953. Engraved upon the cup are a few lines written in the Greek alphabet. Dating from c. 730 BC, it is one of the most important testimonies to the early Greek alphabet, from which the Latin alphabet descended via the Etruscan alphabet. According to certain scholars the inscription also might be the oldest written reference to the Iliad.

In 474 BC, Hiero I of Syracuse came to the aid of the Cumaeans, who lived on the mainland opposite Ischia, against the Etruscans and defeated them on the sea. He occupied Ischia and the surrounding Parthenopean islands and left behind a garrison to build a fortress before the city of Ischia itself. This was still extant in the Middle Ages, but the original garrison fled before the eruptions of 470 BC and the island was taken over by Neapolitans. The Romans seized Ischia (and Naples) in 322 BC.

===From 1st century AD to 16th century===

In 6 AD, Augustus restored the island to Naples in exchange for Capri. Ischia suffered from the barbarian invasions, being taken first by the Heruli then by the Ostrogoths, being ultimately absorbed into the Eastern Roman Empire. The Byzantines gave the island over to Naples in 588 and by 661 it was being administered by a Count liege to the Duke of Naples. The area was devastated by the Saracens in 813 and 847; in 1004 it was occupied by Henry II of Germany; the Norman Roger II of Sicily took it in 1130 granting the island to the Norman Aldoyn de Candida created Count d’Ischia; the island was raided by the Pisans in 1135 and 1137 and subsequently fell under the Hohenstaufen and then Angevin rule. After the Sicilian Vespers in 1282, the island rebelled, recognizing Peter III of Aragon, but was retaken by the Angevins the following year. It was conquered in 1284 by the forces of Aragon and Charles II of Anjou was unable to successfully retake it until 1299.

As a consequence of the island&#x27;s last eruption in 1302, the population fled to Baia where they remained for 4 years. In 1320 Robert of Anjou and his wife Sancia visited the island and were hosted by Cesare Sterlich, who had been sent by Charles II from the Holy See to govern the island in 1306 and was by this time nearly 100 years of age.

Ischia suffered greatly in the struggles between the Angevin and Durazzo dynasties. It was taken by Carlo Durazzo in 1382, retaken by Louis II of Anjou in 1385 and captured yet again by Ladislaus of Naples in 1386; it was sacked by the fleet of the Antipope John XXIII under the command of Gaspare Cossa in 1410 only to be retaken by Ladislaus the following year. In 1422 Joan II gave the island to her adoptive son Alfonso V of Aragon, though, when he fell into disgrace, she retook it with the help of Genoa in 1424. In 1438 Alfonso reoccupied the castle, kicking out all the men and proclaiming it an Aragonese colony, marrying to his garrison the wives and daughters of the expelled. He set about building a bridge linking the castle to the rest of the island and he carved out a large gallery, both of which are still to be seen today. In 1442, he gave the island to one of his favorites, Lucretia d&#x27;Alagno, who in turn entrusted the island&#x27;s governance to her brother-in-law, Giovanni Torella. Upon the death of Alfonso in 1458, they returned the island to the Angevin side. Ferdinand I of Naples ordered Alessandro Sforza to chase Torella out of the castle and gave the island over, in 1462, to Garceraldo Requesens. In 1464, after a brief Torellan insurrection, Marino Caracciolo was set up as governor.

In February 1495, with the arrival of Charles VIII, Ferdinand II landed on the island and took possession of the castle, and, after having killed the disloyal castellan Giusto di Candida with his own hands, left the island under the control of Innico d&#x27;Avalos, marquis of Pescara and Vasto, who ably defended the place from the French flotilla. With him came his sister Costanza and through them they founded the D&#x27;Avalos dynasty which would last on the island into the 18th century.

===16th–18th centuries===
Throughout the 16th century, the island suffered the incursions of pirates and Barbary privateers from North Africa: in 1543 and 1544 Hayreddin Barbarossa laid waste to the island, taking 4,000 prisoners in the process. In 1548 and 1552, Ischia was beset by his successor Dragut Rais. With the increasing rarity and diminishing severity of the piratical attacks later in the century and the construction of better defences, the islanders began to venture out of the castle and it was then that the historic centre of the town of Ischia was begun. Even so, many inhabitants still ended up slaves to the pirates, the last known being taken in 1796. During the 1647 revolution of Masaniello, there was an attempted rebellion against the feudal landowners.

===Since the 18th century===
With the extinction of the D&#x27;Avalos line in 1729, the island reverted to state property. In March 1734 it was taken by the Bourbons and administered by a royal governor seated within the castle. The island participated in the short-lived Republic of Naples starting in March 1799 but by April 3 Commodore Thomas Troubridge under the command of Lord Nelson had put down the revolt on Ischia as well as on neighboring Procida. By decree of the governor, many of the rebels were hanged in a square on Procida now called Piazza dei martiri (Square of the Martyrs). Among these was Francesco Buonocore who had received the island to administer from the French Championnet in Naples. On February 13, 1806, the island was occupied by the French and on the 24th was unsuccessfully attacked by the British.

On June 21 and 22, 1809 the islands of Ischia and Procida were attacked by an Anglo-Bourbon fleet. Procida surrendered on June 24 and Ischia soon afterwards. However the British soon returned to their bases in Sicily and Malta.
In the 19th century Ischia was a popular travel destination for European nobility.

On July 28, 1883, an earthquake destroyed the villages of Casamicciola Terme and Lacco Ameno.

Ischia developed into a well-known artist colony at the beginning of the 20th century. Writers and painters from all over the world were attracted. Eduard Bargheer, Hans Purrmann and Arrigo Wittler lived on the island. Rudolf Levy, Werner Gilles, Max Peiffer Watenphul with Kurt Craemer and Vincent Weber stayed in the fishing village of Sant&#x27;Angelo on the southern tip of the island shortly before the outbreak of the Second World War.
In 1936 Ischia had a population of 30,418.

Spa tourism did not start again until the early 1950s. At that time, a quite remarkable artist colony of writers, composers and visual artists lived in Forio, including Ingeborg Bachmann. Elizabeth Taylor and Luchino Visconti stayed here for filming.
On August 21, 2017, Ischia had an 4.2 magnitude earthquake which killed 2 people and injured 42 more.

Today, Ischia is a popular tourist destination, welcoming up to 6 million visitors per year, mainly from the Italian mainland as well as other European countries like Germany and the United Kingdom (approximately 5,000 Germans are resident on the island), although it has become an increasingly popular destination for Eastern Europeans. The number of Russian guests rose steadily from the 2000s onwards, before the number came to an almost complete standstill due to the currency depreciation of the ruble and COVID-19 pandemic.

From Ischia, various destinations such as Naples, Vesuvius, Amalfi Coast, Capri, Herculaneum, Paestum and the neighboring island Procida can be booked. 
Ischia is easily reached by ferry from Naples. The number of thermal spas on the islands makes it particularly popular with tourists seeking &quot;wellness&quot; holidays. A regular visitor was Angela Merkel, the former German chancellor.

===Events===
The island is home to the Ischia Film Festival, an international cinema competition celebrated in June or July, dedicated to all the works that have promoted the value of the local territory.

===Notable guests and works===

==Wines==
The island of Ischia is home to the eponymous &quot;Denominazione di origine controllata&quot; (DOC) that produces both red and white wines though white wines account for nearly 80% of the island&#x27;s wine production. Vineyards planted within the boundaries of the DOC tend to be on volcanic soils with high pumice, phosphorus and potassium content.

The white wines of the island are composed primarily of Forastera (at least 65% according to DOC regulation) and Biancolella (up to 20%) with up to 15% of other local grape varieties such as Arilla and San Lunardo. Grapes are limited to a harvest yield of no more than 10 tonnes/ha with a finished minimum alcohol level of at least 11%. For wines labeled as &quot;Bianco Superiore&quot;, the yield is further restricted to a maximum of 8 tonnes/ha with a minimum alcohol level of 12%. Only certain subareas of the Ischia DOC can produce &quot;Bianco Superiore&quot; with the blend needing to contain 50% Forastera, 40% Biancolella and 10% San Lunardo.

Red wines produced under the Ischia DOC are composed of 50% Guarnaccia, 40% Piedirosso (known under the local synonym of Per&#x27;e Palummo) and 10% Barbera. Like the white wines, red grapes destined for DOC production are limited to a harvest yield of no more than 10 tonnes/ha though the minimum finished alcohol level is higher at 11.5% ABV.

==Main sights==


===Aragonese Castle===
The Aragonese Castle (&quot;Castello Aragonese&quot;, Ischia Ponte) was built on a rock near the island in 474 BC, by Hiero I of Syracuse. At the same time, two towers were built to control enemy fleets&#x27; movements. The rock was then occupied by Parthenopeans (the ancient inhabitants of Naples). In 326 BC the fortress was captured by Romans, and then again by the Parthenopeans. In 1441 Alfonso V of Aragon connected the rock to the island with a stone bridge instead of the prior wood bridge, and fortified the walls to defend the inhabitants against the raids of pirates. Around 1700, about 2000 families lived on the islet, including a Poor Clares convent, an abbey of Basilian monks (of the Greek Orthodox Church), the bishop and the seminar, and the prince, with a military garrison. There were also thirteen churches. In 1912, the castle was sold to a private owner. Today the castle is the most visited monument of the island. It is accessed through a tunnel with large openings which let the light enter. Along the tunnel there is a small chapel consecrated to Saint John Joseph of the Cross (San Giovan Giuseppe della Croce), the patron saint of the island. A more comfortable access is also possible with a modern lift. After arriving outside, it is possible to visit the Church of the Immacolata and the Cathedral of Assunta. The first was built in 1737 on the location of a smaller chapel dedicated to Saint Francis, and closed after the suppression of convents in 1806, as well as the Poor Clares convent.

===Gardens of &quot;La Mortella&quot;===

The gardens, located in Forio-San Francesco, were originally the property of English composer William Walton. Walton lived in the villa next to the gardens with his Argentine wife Susana. When the composer arrived on the island in 1946, he immediately called Russell Page from England to lay out the garden. Wonderful tropical and Mediterranean plants were planted and some have now reached amazing proportions. The gardens include wonderful views over the city and harbour of Forio. A museum dedicated to the life and work of William Walton now comprises part of the garden complex. There&#x27;s also a recital room where renowned musical artists perform on a regular schedule.

===Villa La Colombaia===
&quot;Villa La Colombaia&quot; is located in Lacco Ameno and Forio territories. Surrounded by a park, the villa (called &quot;The Dovecote&quot;) was made by Luigi Patalano, a famous local socialist and journalist. It is now the seat of a cultural institution and museum dedicated to Luchino Visconti. The institution promotes cultural activities such as music, cinema, theatre, art exhibitions, workshops and cinema reviews. The villa and the park are open to the public.

==Environmental problems==
The sharp increase of the population between 1950 and 1980 and the growing inflow of tourists (in 2010 over 4 million tourists visited the island for at least one day) have increased the anthropic pressure on the island. Significant acreage of land previously used for agriculture has been developed for the construction of houses and residential structures. Most of this development has taken place without any planning and building permission. As at the end of 2011, the island lacked the most basic system for sewage treatment; sewage is sent directly to the sea. In 2004 one of the five communities of the island commenced civil works to build a sewage treatment plant but since then the construction has not been completed and it is currently stopped.

On June 14, 2007, there was a breakage in one of the four high-voltage underwater cables forming the power line maintained by Enel S.p.A. — although never authorized by Italian authorities – between Cuma on the Campania coast and Lacco Ameno on the island of Ischia. Inside each cable there is an 18 mm‑diameter channel filled with oil under high pressure. The breakage of the Enel cable resulted in the spillage of oil into the sea and into other environmental matrices – with the consequent pollution by polychlorobiphenyls (PCBs, the use of which was banned by the Italian authorities as long ago as 1984), polycyclic aromatic hydrocarbons (PAHs) and linear alkyl benzenes (aromatic hydrocarbons) — in the ‘Regno di Nettuno’, a marine protected area, and the largest ecosystem in the Mediterranean Sea, designated as a ‘priority habitat’ in Annex I to the Habitats Directive (92/43/EEC) and comprising oceanic posidonia beds.

To reduce pollution due to cars, Ischia has been the place of the first complete sustainable mobility project applied to an urban center, created in 2017 with Enel in collaboration with Aldo Arcangioli, one the main Italian experts of green mobility, under the name of &quot;Green Island&quot;.

<doc id="366384" wikidata="Q7966301" url="?curid=366384" title="Walter Trohan">
<text>Walter Trohan (July 4, 1903 – October 30, 2003) was a 20th-century American journalist, known as a long-time &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reporter (1929–1971) and its bureau chief in Washington, D.C. (1949–1968).

==Background==
Trohan was born on July 4, 1903, in Mount Carmel, Pennsylvania. In 1920, he family moved to the South Side of Chicago, where his father was a wholesale grocer. He attended Bowen High School, reported for a bit at the &quot;Daily Calumet&quot;, and in 1926 graduated from the University of Notre Dame.

==Career==

After college, Trohan went to New York City to work but &quot;didn&#x27;t like it&quot; and returned to Chicago. In 1927, Trohan went to work at the for the City News Bureau of Chicago (1927–1929).

On February 29, 1929, he received an offer to jon the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; newspaper. As a young reporter, he was first on the scene of the infamous St. Valentine&#x27;s Day Massacre, when Al Capone&#x27;s gang gunned down several members of the rival Bugs Moran gang.

In 1934, the &quot;Tribinue&quot; transferred Trohan as assistant correspondent to Washington, DC, when Franklin Roosevelt was president. In spite of the &quot;Tribune&quot;&#x27;s hostility to Roosevelt&#x27;s policies, Trohan and the president &quot;maintained cordial relations.&quot; (Later, Trohan said that Roosevelt had &quot;charisma in spades&quot; but was &quot;the worst snob I ever ran across.&quot;) In 1936, Trohan called FBI Director J. Edgar Hoover a &quot;Keystone cop,&quot; but eventually, they became friends.

===Harry Truman===
Trohan recalled that he did not know Harry Truman well initially because he did not cover Capitol Hill much. However, he met him and noted that US Senator Burton K. Wheeler had gotten Truman a seat on the Senate&#x27;s Interstate Commerce Committee. He said that he received a lot of advice from Wheeler and Lewis B. Schwellenbach. On the committee, Truman proved himself &quot;quite and expert investigator.&quot; That said, he did not think Truman had enough experience to run for vice president and believed that Roosevelt chose Truman simply to avoid running again with Henry A. Wallace.

===Anticommunist and Alger Hiss===
On December 26, 1946, the &quot;Tribune&quot; had a front-page story by Trohan, &quot;New Congress&#x27; Pink &#x27;Advisors&#x27; Face G.O.P. Ax.&quot;

In 1947, Trohan became &quot;executive director&quot; of the &quot;Tribune&quot;&#x27;s Washington bureau through 1949.

On September 26, 1948, he reported that Alger Hiss was about to flee the country, rather than file a libel suit against Whittaker Chambers. Hiss filed the suit the very next day. Overall, Trohan was critical of Truman&#x27;s handling of the Hiss Case: &quot;Like the time he fronted for Alger Hiss. He wasn&#x27;t fronting for Alger Hiss, per se, he thought they were attacking him through Hiss. Roosevelt would have sacrificed Hiss at the snap of the finger. He would have sacrificed anybody, but Mr. Truman figured that that was a fight on him, so he supported Hiss whom he didn&#x27;t really like; thought he was a terrible fellow.&quot;

===Douglas MacArthur===
In 1949, Trohan became Washington bureau chief (or &quot;director&quot;) until 1969. In 1951, Trohan was known for ferreting out the fact that Truman planned to fire General Douglas MacArthur, the commander of UN forces in Korea. When Truman found out that Trohan knew about his plan, he publicly announced his decision via General Omar Bradley and robbed Trohan of the scoop. He experienced censorship during World War II as well.

===&quot;Washington Report&quot;===
From 1951 to 1968, Trohan also filed a radio broadcast, &quot;Washington Report.&quot; In 1959, he accompanied US President Dwight Eisenhower on a three-continent tour.

In 1969, he retired from his position as Washington bureau chief and, on December 31, 1971, from his radio and column.

===Richard Nixon===
Trohan was a long-time &quot;intimate journalist friend&quot; of Richard Nixon. In 1953, he wrote Nixon (then the vice president) a letter that warned him against U.S. Senator Joseph McCarthy.

==Personal==
Around 1929, Trohan married Carol Rowland. They had two daughters and a son.

Trohan was president of the White House Correspondents&#x27; Association in 1937-1938 and the Gridiron Club in 1967.

Trohan was anti-Semitic. For instance, in 1950, he wrote an article that accused US Senator Herbert H. Lehman, Supreme Court Justice Felix Frankfurter, and US Treasury Secretary Henry Morgenthau Jr. were part of an alleged &quot;secret super-Government of Jews in Washington.&quot;

Trohan and his wife lived in County Clare, Ireland, from 1971 to 1978 and then returned to live in Columbia, Maryland.

==Death==
Trohan died at 100 on October 28, 2003, in a hospital in Bethesda, Maryland.

==Legacy==

Trohan is the source for much unique information about Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s health that turned up in various publications and FBI documents. He was the source for much of a controversial article published by Dr. Karl C. Wold in Look Magazine in 1947. He also collaborated with James A. Farley in ghost writing his memoirs. Trohan&#x27;s papers are housed at the Herbert Hoover Library, near Cedar Rapids, Iowa.

==Work==

In 1975 Trohan wrote his memoirs and titled the book &quot;Political Animals&quot;. In the book, he recalled how when he arrived in Washington in 1934 as an assistant correspondent in the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s Washington Bureau. He could remember freely wandering Roosevelt&#x27;s White House and interviewing cabinet members and other staff. Due to tightened security measures, this freedom no longer exists.

<text>The Mighty Boosh is a British comedy troupe featuring comedians Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding. Developed from three stage shows, &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot;, &quot;Arctic Boosh&quot; (1999) and &quot;Autoboosh&quot; (2000) as well as a six-episode radio series, it has since spanned a total of 20 television episodes for BBC Three which aired from 2004 to 2007, and two live tours of the UK, as well as two live shows in the United States. The first television series is set in a zoo operated by Bob Fossil, the second in a flat and the third in a secondhand shop in Dalston called Nabootique.

The style of humour in the Mighty Boosh is often described as being surreal, as well as being escapist and new wave comedy.

Various members of The Mighty Boosh have appeared in a number of different comedy series including &quot;Nathan Barley&quot;, &quot;Snuff Box&quot; and &quot;Noel Fielding&#x27;s Luxury Comedy&quot;. Regular Boosh collaborators include Michael Fielding, Rich Fulcher, Dave Brown, Nigel Coan, Richard Ayoade and Matt Berry. The troupe is named after a childhood hairstyle of co-star Michael Fielding.

==History==

Noel Fielding first met Mighty Boosh collaborator Dave Brown whilst Fielding was studying a foundation course in fine arts at the Croydon School of Art. Then from 1992 to 1995 Fielding studied Graphic Design and Advertising at Buckinghamshire College of Higher Education and whilst there both Dave Brown and Nigel Coan were studying the same course as Fielding and all three shared a student house together. After they had lived together in student housing, Fielding, Brown and Coan then later lived together in a flat in Hackney in London.

It has been commented that Noel Fielding and Julian Barratt first met when in 1997 they both appeared on the same comedy bill at a pub in north London. In 2006 Fielding commented that &quot;We were doing stand-up and were on the same bill together. I was on first and usually you can only have about one weird comedian on a line-up. He’d been doing it a bit longer than me... [Barratt was like]&#x27;...Let’s write together&#x27;. I’ve been stuck with him ever since and that was about eight years ago or something.&quot; It has also been commented that whilst Fielding and Dave Brown were both art students at Buckinghamshire College of Higher Education &quot;They were both regular visitors to the Hellfire Comedy nights next to the Wycombe Swan Theatre in High Wycombe, which is where Noel first met future Boosh co-creator, Julian Barratt&quot;.

Whilst Barratt and Fielding were on The Jonathan Ross Show, Ross asked them &quot;And did you perform as solo acts ever, did you do like stand up...&quot; with Barratt responding &quot;yeah, yeah, that&#x27;s how we sort of met really on the circuit, doing stand up, yeah.&quot;, with Ross responding &quot;But, but was it similar to the Boosh stuff, &#x27;cos the Boosh stuff it seems to be so much of a partnership I can&#x27;t imagine it being taken apart and being served up separately.&quot;, with Barratt responding that &quot;We were both doing quite surreal stuff, eh...&quot;, with Fielding adding &quot;It was quite weird wasn&#x27;t it, a lot weirder than the show in a way...&quot;, with Barratt continuing &quot;...but we sort of, when we first met we kind of liked each others comedy but we didn&#x27;t know that it would work, we didn&#x27;t know whether it was gonna cancel each other out and make...&quot;, with Fielding responding &quot;Yeah, too weird to make sort of, straight...&quot;, with Barratt continuing &quot;...might just become geography or something else or... this sort of thing, but it worked for some reason...&quot;, with Fielding adding &quot;We had quite a good chemistry straight away.&quot;

On the day they met they both went back to Julian&#x27;s place that night where Barratt played music on his Akai sampler whilst Fielding used a ping-pong ball to make an eye patch. The pair soon found that they shared common interests in music and comedy which included Vic Reeves and Bob Mortimer and it was also commented that &quot;Both wanted to get their material heard; neither had found anyone to work with who remotely understood what was going on in their head. It was a huge relief when they chanced upon one another and decided to be the new Goodies... ...What they take from the classic Seventies series is more the spirit of... ...silly and surreal comedy.&quot; Fielding has commented on their shared interest in music that &quot;I was sort of a bit more rock n roll and pop and he [Julian Barratt] was a bit more jazz but then we sort of met in the middle with electro... but Julian was... I think he left univeristy to join a band, we were both in bands before we were in the Boosh, so we sort of came from that background. Lot of our friends were in bands.&quot; It has also been commented that Barratt &quot;...had dropped out of an American studies course at Reading University&quot; and Barratt has also commented that when he was seventeen &quot;We went to stay with a friend of a friend’s uncle but we came back after three days. We thought we’d make inroads into the jazz scene in London – we’d read biographies about guys who got gigs at Ronnie Scott’s and got spotted and immediately taken into someone’s band. So we told our parents we were leaving home. They gave us two days and we lasted three...&quot;. It was also commented that &quot;...both [Fielding and Barratt] had fathers who loved Frank Zappa and Captain Beefheart, and who encouraged their sons to avoid getting proper jobs.&quot;

On his beginnings in stand up Barratt has commented that &quot;I was never like Noel [Fielding] or Lee Mack, who are just funny all the time. No one ever said to me, you should be a comedian mate. But I watched a lot of stand-up at uni – people like Mark Lamarr, Sean Hughes, Eddie Izzard, just standing on a stage doing these phenomenal routines. And I could see how you could do it. So I started doing it myself, and I was so shocked when it worked. I remember one time I completely forgot what I was about to say, and I just ran out of the venue.&quot; It has also been commented that this occurred &quot;...during his first standup sketch at Reading University...&quot; and that he &quot;...ran through the back door mid-act and through fields to a lake.&quot; Barrett has further commented that after he left the venue &quot;...the manager came out after me and said: &#x27;Get back in there, it’s going well.&#x27; So I went back. I suppose that was a big turning point for me.&quot;

Barratt and Fielding have commented on the beginning of the Mighty boosh, with Barratt commenting that &quot;We performed together for the first time in... ... was it in that show by Stewart Lee?&quot;, with Fielding replying &quot;yeah, Stewart Lee&#x27;s show, Moby Dick and King Dong (At the Edinburgh Fringe Festival, 1997)... ...Julian played King Dong&#x27;s penis...&quot;, with Barratt replying &quot;...an enormous penis...&quot;, and then with Fielding replying &quot;...a perfect King Dong... ...then we thought lets do a show together.&quot;

Sometime in around 1998 they then put on their first comedy show and it was commented by Nigel Coan with whom they collaborated with on Mighty Boosh that &quot;They did their first gig at Oranje Boom Boom which is sort of in Chinatown in London, and ah, which was ridiculous, I mean it was really, like, ridiculous costumes and um, they didn&#x27;t know what... they really [didn&#x27;t] know what they were doing... ...It was very raw, but it was, it was hilarious...&quot; After Barratt and Fielding&#x27;s first performance together at Oranje Boom Boom at bar De Hems, in London in April 1998, they developed their zookeeper characters, Howard Moon and Vince Noir, in a series of sketches for Paramount Comedy’s &quot;Unnatural Acts&quot; with Barratt commenting that &quot;Early on we had Rich Fulcher, we were working on a sketch show...&quot;.

Nigle Coan has commented further on them developing the Mighty boosh &quot;...They thought lets do a show, an Edinburgh show. I think they started to think about doing that. So they got a gig at Hen and Chickens...&quot;. Dave Brown who also collaborated on the Mighty Boosh with them commented further on their time at the Hen and chickens which is a theatre bar in Islington, London, &quot;They would use the Hen and Chickens as this kind of... place to, a platform to just try stuff out and it was just a great little place they could do a regular spot... ...where they would probably write and have ideas in the week, try stuff out for half of that and then for the rest of it, it would just be improv and mucking about. Then they took the, um, took &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; up to Edinburgh and then two more shows &quot;Arctic Boosh&quot; (1999), &quot;Autoboosh&quot; (2000)...&quot;.

Fielding and Barratt commented on their time at the Hen and Chickens, with Fielding commenting that &quot;...cos it&#x27;d be stand up and people would come on and do straight stand up. And then we used to put potted plants all around the gig and music on... ...to try and make it into a sort of play... people couldn&#x27;t believe the audacity. It got some sort of reputation as being sort of enigmatic but we&#x27;re just really unprofessional. We didn&#x27;t know anything about theatre or what you did.&quot; with Barratt responding to Fielding &quot;Speak for yourself, I was in a Sartre play at university I&#x27;ll have you know. &quot;Huis Clos&quot;.&quot; Fielding has commented further on their first live show, &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot;, “Julian had a song about a mammoth that he wanted to sing to a girl in the audience, and I had a few ideas for some weird sketches... ...We started working on our ideas together... ...We were zookeepers and we got sucked through our bosses’ eyes and into a magic forest...&quot;

Michael Fielding and Richard Ayoade both performed with the Mighty Boosh in 2002 during a live run through of a Mighty Boosh pilot. Richard Ayoade played adventurer Dixon Bainbridge, but Matt Berry replaced him in the first television series, since Ayoade was under contract with Channel 4. Ayoade returned in the second and third series as a belligerent shaman named Saboo. The name &quot;Mighty Boosh&quot; was originally a phrase used by a friend of Michael Fielding&#x27;s to describe the hair that Michael had as a child.

All three of the Mighty Boosh stage shows – &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; (1998), &quot;Arctic Boosh&quot; (1999) and &quot;Autoboosh&quot; (2000) – were taken to the Edinburgh Fringe and with the success of &quot;Autoboosh&quot;, a radio series was commissioned by the BBC. Produced by Danny Wallace, &quot;The Boosh&quot; radio show was a six-part series that was first broadcast in 2001 on BBC London Live, later transferring to BBC Radio 4, and Barratt has humorously commented that &quot;...so we did a radio show, we did, we sort of recorded it in a sort of old railway sort of arch... [with Fielding adding] in Shoreditch... ...built our studio out of weird... little children&#x27;s toys...&quot;.

From the radio show Fielding and Barratt were given a half-hour television pilot of the same name, and Barratt has commented that &quot;...we wanted to get on TV but it&#x27;d been a lot of trouble because they thought it was eh, the scripts we sort of gave them were sort of like massive epic adeventures that sounded like it would cost them a million pounds to make so they said this isn&#x27;t, I dont know how this is going to work on stage, well actually what happened is...&quot;, with Fielding adding &quot;We wrote it for Channel 4 originally...&quot;, and Barratt replying &quot;[we spoke to them]...before we&#x27;d done a stage show and they said how is this going to work on TV cos it is ridiculous. So we wrote, we did a stage show and then they said hows that going to work on TV because its really good live, so, perhaps we should&#x27;ve done it inside a television set.&quot; In 2013 Fielding has also commented that &quot;I would love to do a Boosh film I really would. I hope we do cos I feel like thats what we started out wanting to do. We really wanted to do a film, really... ...we wanted to do a film, and then we thought alright we&#x27;ll do a live show. We didn&#x27;t really know how to do a live show we thought we&#x27;d just learn, and then we sort of... ...we did a radio show, we did a TV show, we never quite got around to doing a film...&quot; In 2008 Fielding commented that &quot;A film is the first thing we ever wanted to do, so we&#x27;ve always come up with ideas and stuck them in a drawer.&quot; and in 2014 it was commented that &quot;The pair have written two film scripts in the past, though neither made it to production. One was a &quot;Rocky Horror Picture Show type thing,&quot; according to Fielding, in which Barratt played a character who has woken up believing himself to be the last man on earth. The other was an Arctic adventure – &#x27;because we always liked the Arctic&#x27;.&quot;

The first 8-part series was then commissioned for BBC Three, directed by Paul King and broadcast in 2004, with a second series of 6 episodes the next year. The second series moved away from the zoo setting to show Howard, Vince, Naboo the shaman and Bollo the talking ape living in a flat in Dalston. In 2006, the Boosh returned to theatre with &quot;The Mighty Boosh Live&quot;, which featured a new story entitled &quot;The Ruby of Kukundu&quot;.

Fielding has commented in relation to touring that &quot;The touring lifestyle is quite hard... ...In the boosh tour we did a 100 day tour and we had one day off a week to travel and we were playing arenas and we partied every single night and we got up for sound check at six o&#x27;clock. So we were like Dracula. I was like Dracula. So I&#x27;d wake up at six, do a sound check, wake up, do the show, go to a party, stay up till five in the morning, sleep all day, every day for a hundred... .&quot; Fielding has further commented about the Mighty Boosh that &quot;It was crazy cos we were just going... ...it was never mean&#x27;t to be, we were never mean&#x27;t to be playing the O2 and Wembley and being on the cover of Time Out and... ...being on Jonathan Ross I dont think we ever thought that would happen... ...We always sort of just made it in our bedroom and then brought it out and stuff happened. We were as surprised as anyone when we won the Perrier and we were surprised when it got put on telly. We were like &#x27;Wow this is great&#x27; we weren&#x27;t ever sort of planning it. Like... ..we didn&#x27;t even know if we could make a living from it.&quot; Fielding has commented further that “We always thought we’d make one show and that’d be the end of it. But after we won the Perrier, everyone was telling us that we had to do another, which we did and brought it to Melbourne and won the Barry, and then we made a radio show that won the Douglas Adams Award. We won loads. It was manic. We always thought we’d do a couple of years together and go our separate ways. We went from stages to the radio show to television to live shows. It went on and on.” Barratt has also commented that “Me and Noel went to HBO once and pitched this really ludicrous idea about us driving around in a haunted car and they just stared at us. Literally stared at us!... ...Luckily, we were together so we could laugh about it...&quot;
Fielding commented in 2015 that whilst creating &quot;Noel Fielding&#x27;s Luxury Comedy&quot; that &quot;Originally I used to do all the paintings for the animations. This meant that I was filming in the day and staying up until 5 am painting. After three weeks of this I started to feel unusual so Ivana Zorn, who is Nigel Coan&#x27;s partner, now does a majority of the painting and I just design the main characters. Nigel animates everything like a futuristic goose.&quot;
Fielding formed &quot;Secret Peter Productions&quot; with Nigel Coan who, along with Fielding and Zorn, helped to animate series 1 and 2 of the Mighty Boosh TV show, &quot;An evening with Noel Fielding&quot; and &quot;Noel Fielding&#x27;s Luxury Comedy&quot;. Coan also directed &quot;Noel Fielding&#x27;s Luxury Comedy&quot; as well as helping to write it along with Fielding. Dave Brown also contributed to graphics for the Mighty Boosh including the DVD cover art for the &quot;Mighty Boosh Live&quot; 2006 stage show. Brown also &quot;...designed and compiled &quot;The Mighty Book of Boosh&quot;...&quot; as well as all the publishing output for the Mighty Boosh. It has been commented that Barratt &quot;...composed all the music for The Mighty Boosh.&quot; with Barratt also commenting that &quot;I write the music, eh, but we both sort of write, we both write the lyrics, and we, I do the music mostly...&quot; with Fielding replying to Barratt that &quot;I have a go at the melodies then he goes away and makes it...&quot; and then with Barratt replying &quot;...tweaks, tweaks it a bit&quot;. Fielding also made drawings that formed a basis for the characters costumes and make-up in the Mighty boosh TV show. Regular Boosh collaborators include Michael Fielding, Rich Fulcher, Dave Brown, Nigel Coan, Richard Ayoade, Matt Berry and Ivanna Zorn. In 2002 during a live run through of a Mighty Boosh pilot Richard Ayoade played adventurer Dixon Bainbridge, but Matt Berry replaced him in the first television series, since Ayoade was under contract with Channel 4.

Fielding has further commented that &quot;&#x27;I think our show is magical and fantastical. We tell very intricate, weird stories. Vince Noir is quite modern, a bit of an indie kid; Howard Moon is... ...eccentric... ...and we rely heavily on Julian&#x27;s music and my animation... ...It&#x27;s such a weird shambles of stuff.&#x27;&quot; It was also commented that the Mighty Boosh &quot;... almost didn&#x27;t make it to television. Around 2000, Barratt and Fielding disappeared into development hell. They had done a sketch show for Radio 4, but no one was sure how to translate their act on to TV. That&#x27;s until Steve Coogan, who had seen them in Edinburgh in 1999 when they were performing as Arctic Boosh, moved things along. His production company... ...sold the concept to the BBC simply by saying: &#x27;If we were young, we&#x27;d want to be them.&#x27;&quot; From August 2008 to January 2009 they went on tour for a second time with a new stage show of the Mighty Boosh.

After two years away from television, the Boosh returned in November 2007. Set in Naboo&#x27;s second-hand shop below the flat, the third series drew approximately 1 million viewers with its first episode, and in light of its success, BBC Three broadcast an entire night of &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; on 22 March 2008, which included a new documentary and 6 of Barratt and Fielding&#x27;s favourite episodes from all 3 series. J. G. Quintel has said that The Mighty Boosh was a large influence on his animated series &quot;Regular Show&quot;.
In June 2013, it was confirmed that The Mighty Boosh would reunite for a US festival called Festival Supreme in October 2013.

On 1 January 2020, Fielding posted an image of himself and Barratt on Instagram with the caption, &quot;There really wasn&#x27;t enough Boosh this decade ! let&#x27;s try and rectify that in the next one ;) x&quot;.

===Main cast===

==Theatre==
===Original stage shows===
====&quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; (1998)====

The Boosh, then consisting of only Barratt and Fielding, conceived &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; whilst working on Stewart Lee&#x27;s Edinburgh Festival show &quot;King Dong vs. Moby Dick&quot; in which they played a giant penis and a whale respectively.

In 1998, they took &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; to the Edinburgh Festival, recruiting fellow comedian Rich Fulcher, whom the pair had met while working on &quot;Unnatural Acts&quot;. The show won the Perrier Award for Best Newcomer. During their residency at North London&#x27;s Hen and Chickens Theatre the following year, they built up a cult following, introducing new characters whilst developing old ones.

====&quot;Arctic Boosh&quot; (1999)====

In 1999, the Boosh returned to the Edinburgh Festival with a new show, &quot;Arctic Boosh&quot;, with Dave Brown acting as choreographer and photographer, as well as playing a variety of characters. &quot;Arctic Boosh&quot; sold out every night and was nominated for the Perrier Award. The show was directed by Stewart Lee.

====&quot;Autoboosh&quot; (2000)====

In 2000, the Boosh premiered their third stage show, &quot;Autoboosh&quot;, at the Melbourne International Comedy Festival, adding Fielding&#x27;s younger brother Michael to the cast. &quot;Autoboosh&quot; won the festival&#x27;s Barry Award.

===Nationwide tours===
====&quot;The Mighty Boosh Live&quot; (2006)====

The Boosh returned to the stage in 2006, touring the UK for the first time. Though drawing heavily from their earlier material, the main story combined these elements into a new narrative. A recording of this show at the Brixton Academy was later released on DVD, before being broadcast on BBC Three on Boxing Day, 2007.

====&quot;The Mighty Boosh Live: Future Sailors Tour&quot; (2008/09)====

The Boosh toured the UK and Ireland for a second time from September 2008 to February 2009. The show featured characters from all three series as well as the Boosh Band.

They made appearances throughout the UK after their live shows, at after-parties held in different places in each city. The events were called &quot;Outrage&quot;, after the catchphrase by Tony Harrison.

==Radio==
===&quot;The Boosh&quot; (2001)===

From the success of &quot;Autoboosh&quot;, the BBC commissioned a six-part radio series for the Boosh. In October 2001 &quot;The Boosh&quot; radio series, produced by Danny Wallace, was broadcast on BBC London Live, then BBC Radio 4, and later on BBC 7. The show focuses on the adventures of a pair of zookeepers at &quot;Bob Fossil&#x27;s Funworld&quot;: socially awkward, jazz enthusiast Howard TJ Moon, and ultra-vain, fashion-obsessed Vince Noir. This also included voices from Lee Mack, playing such characters as the Plumber or the Gardener.

===Further appearances===

The Mighty Boosh returned to radio on 22 October 2004, in a one-off comedy special for &quot;The Breezeblock&quot;, a show on BBC Radio 1. Instead of the plot driven nature of their own series, this show featured improvised conversational comedy with Barratt, Fielding and Fulcher, combined with the show&#x27;s usual mix of electronic music.

On 15 November 2007, as part of the publicity for the premier of their third series the same day, Julian Barratt and Noel Fielding returned to Radio 1, this time on Jo Whiley&#x27;s Live Lounge.

On 9 April 2019, it was announced that The Mighty Boosh will be the UK ambassadors for the Record Store Day at 13 April 2019, a show on BBC Radio 1.

==Television==
===&quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; (2004–07)===

In May 2004, after the success of the Boosh pilot,Steve Coogan&#x27;s company, Baby Cow Productions, produced the first television series of &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; for BBC Three, before it moved to BBC Two in November that same year. Though each episode invariably starts and ends in Dixon Bainbridge&#x27;s dilapidated zoo, the &quot;Zooniverse&quot;, the characters of Vince and Howard often depart for other locations, such as the Arctic tundra and limbo.

A second series, shown in July 2005, saw Howard and Vince sharing Naboo&#x27;s flat in Dalston with previously minor characters Naboo and his familiar, Bollo, a gorilla living at the &quot;Zooniverse&quot;. This series had an even looser setting as the four characters leave the confines of the flat in every episode, travelling in their van to a variety of surrealistic environments, including Naboo&#x27;s home planet &quot;Xooberon&quot;.

Series three started in November 2007, still set in Dalston, but this time the foursome are selling &#x27;Bits &amp; Bobs&#x27; in their shop, the Nabootique. Their adventures and outings in this series focused more on the involvement of new characters (e.g. Sammy the Crab, or Lester Corncrake etc.) rather than just the two of them.

Although BBC America originally aired only series 1 in the U.S. (all episodes in their entirety), &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; began airing in North America on Cartoon Network&#x27;s Adult Swim block (with up to 6 minutes cut from each episode), starting 29 March 2009 with the third series. In February 2016 series 1 of &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; was made available to watch via the online service BBC iPlayer for six weeks; this included every episode minus the final episode of the first series &#x27;Hitcher&#x27;.

===&quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; Night===
On 22 March 2008, BBC Three broadcast a whole night of &quot;The Mighty Boosh&quot; from 9:05 pm, starting with a new documentary titled &quot;The Mighty Boosh: A Journey Through Time and Space&quot;, documenting the history of the Boosh from their first amateur performances to their then-upcoming 2008 tour. This was followed by six of Barratt and Fielding&#x27;s favourite episodes from the three series: &quot;Party&quot;, &quot;The Power of the Crimp&quot;, &quot;The Nightmare of Milky Joe&quot;, &quot;The Priest and the Beast&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Old Gregg&quot;, and &quot;Tundra&quot;. The pair also appeared in live links throughout the night, in a similar style to the openings of Series 1 episodes. On 23 December 2008, BBC3 held a Merry Booshmas Party featuring the entire series 3 as well as a broadcast of &quot;The Mighty Boosh Live&quot;.

==Film==
On 8 February 2012, whilst sledging, Noel Fielding said that he and Barratt had discussed plans to make a Mighty Boosh film.

==Festival==
On 5 July 2008, the Boosh held their own festival in the Hop Farm in Kent. It featured musical acts, Robots in Disguise, The Charlatans, The Kills, Gary Numan, and The Mighty Boosh Band, as well as comedy acts Frankie Boyle and Ross Noble.

==Media==
===Audio CDs===
According to an official MySpace page for PieFace Records (the fictitious music label mentioned throughout the series), Barratt and Fielding are to release an album of music from the show, &quot;along with extras, versions, remixes and rare unreleased stuff all to be released later in the year on their own label—this one&quot;. In interviews since, The Mighty Boosh have confirmed they will be releasing an album of their music. On 21 October 2013 episode of &quot;Never Mind the Buzzcocks&quot;, Fielding stated that the Boosh have recorded an album, but don&#x27;t know when it will be released.

===DVDs===
Previously most of the DVDs were only released in Region 2 but as a result of a growing fan base in the U.S., the BBC rereleased in Region 1, Series 1–3 individually on 21 July 2009, and a Special Edition Series 1–3 Boxset on 13 October 2009.

===Books===
On 18 September 2008, Canongate Books published &quot;The Mighty Book of Boosh&quot;, designed and compiled by Dave Brown and written by Noel Fielding, Julian Barratt, Rich Fulcher, Dave Brown, Richard Ayoade and Michael Fielding. The book includes original stories, crimps, concept art, behind-the-scenes photography, comics, and various other things, featuring old and new Mighty Boosh characters. On 1 October 2009, a paperback version was released under the name &quot;The Pocket Book of Boosh&quot;.

==Awards==
Particularly popular among followers of the indie and electro music genres catered to by NME magazine, The Mighty Boosh has been recipient of the Shockwaves NME Awards Best TV Show for three consecutive years, even though there were no new episodes broadcast for the latter two of the three years.

<text>The ginkgo-toothed beaked whale (Mesoplodon ginkgodens) is a poorly known species of whale even for a beaked whale, and was named for the unusual shape of its dual teeth. It is a fairly typical-looking species, but is notable for the males not having any scarring.

==Description==

Ginkgo-toothed beaked whales are more robust than most mesoplodonts, but otherwise look fairly typical. Halfway through the jaw, there is a sharp curve up where the ginkgo leaf-shaped tooth is. 

Unlike other species such as Blainville&#x27;s beaked whale and Andrews&#x27; beaked whale, the teeth do not arch over the rostrum. The beak itself is of a moderate length. 

The coloration is overall dark gray on males with light patches on the front half of the beak and around the head, and small white spots on the bottom of the tail, but the location may be variable. Females are a lighter gray and have countershading. 

Both sexes reach in length. They are around long when born.

==Population and distribution==
This beaked whale has had fewer than 20 strandings off the coasts of Japan, Taiwan, California, the Galapagos Islands, New South Wales, New Zealand, Sri Lanka, the Maldives, and the Strait of Malacca. Its range is essentially tropical and temperate waters in the Indian and Pacific Ocean. There are currently no population estimates.

A potential sighting occurred in the South China Sea in May 2019, although it was possible the sighted whales were Deraniyagala&#x27;s beaked whales. In February 2021, a pod of three whales was sighted at the Parengarenga Canyons, off North Cape (Otou), New Zealand.

==Behavior==
Unlike all other known members of Ziphiidae, there is no evidence that the males engage in combat, although this may be due to a limited sample size. The species probably feeds primarily on squid. No other information is known.

==Conservation==
The only observations of this species while alive have come from hunters off the coasts of Japan and Taiwan, who occasionally take an individual. They are also affected by drift gillnets. One individual, identified from a DNA sample, was known to have interacted with a pelagic longline fishery in the central and western Pacific Ocean. The ginkgo-toothed beaked whale is covered by the &quot;Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region&quot; (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).

<text>Gray&#x27;s beaked whale (Mesoplodon grayi), sometimes known as Haast&#x27;s beaked whale, the scamperdown whale, or the southern beaked whale, is one of the better-known members of the genus &quot;Mesoplodon&quot;. This species is fairly gregarious and strands relatively frequently for a beaked whale. In the Māori language, this species is called &quot;hakurā&quot; or &quot;iheihe&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described in 1876 by Julius von Haast, director of the Canterbury Museum, Christchurch, New Zealand. He named it after the British taxonomist John Edward Gray, a zoologist at the British Museum. His description was based on three skulls he had received in May 1875 from a Louis Walter Hood Esq.
(1837 – 11 February 1912, generally known as Walter) the storekeeper at Waitangi, Chatham Island, who had retrieved them from three specimens that were part of a group of 28 individuals that had stranded on Waitangi Beach in the summer of 1874–75.

==Description==

Gray&#x27;s beaked whale is a fairly slender member of the genus. The melon on the whale bulges towards the blowhole and slopes down towards the beak. The beak itself is very long and pointed for a beaked whale, and has a relatively straight mouth line. In both sexes, 17–22 small teeth per row located towards the back of the mouth have been reported, but not confirmed. In males, two small, triangular teeth are present halfway down the mouth. The overall coloration is dark on top and light below, and both sexes have a white beak. Females are lighter on top and have additional white markings near the genitals. Adult males often carry linear scars that probably result from fighting, and both males and females may display circular scars from cookiecutter shark bites. &quot;M. grayi&quot; are long and weigh around . They are believed to be around long when born.

==Behavior==

Gray&#x27;s beaked whale is very gregarious. It has a tendency to strand in large groups, once involving 28 individuals. Other strandings involved five to eight animals. The upper teeth may be used in holding prey, but why only this species has them is not clear.

Gray&#x27;s beaked whale is said to be the most common species of whale to beach in New Zealand. Two whales that stranded themselves on Opape Beach in the Bay of Plenty, New Zealand, in December 2010, were initially thought to be Gray&#x27;s beaked whales, but later found to be the very rare spade-toothed whale.

==Population and distribution==
This species typically lives in the Southern Hemisphere between 30 and 45°, and is typically observed at depths of . Many strandings have occurred off New Zealand, but others have happened off Australia, South Africa, South America, and the Falkland Islands. This species has been sighted in groups off the coast of Madagascar and in the Antarctic area. Oddly, one specimen stranded off the Netherlands, in a different hemisphere and several thousand miles away from all other strandings. No population estimates exist, but they are believed to be rather common.

==Conservation==
These whales have not been hunted deliberately and they have not been entangled in fishing gear. Gray&#x27;s beaked whale is included in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU)

<text>Hector&#x27;s beaked whale (Mesoplodon hectori), is a small mesoplodont living in the Southern Hemisphere. This whale is named after Sir James Hector, a founder of the colonial museum in Wellington, New Zealand. The species has rarely been seen in the wild.

Some data supposedly referring to this species, especially juveniles and males, turned out to be based on the misidentified specimens of Perrin&#x27;s beaked whale - especially since the adult male of Hector&#x27;s beaked whale was only more recently described.

==Taxonomy==
The English taxonomist John Edward Gray first named the species &quot;Berardius hectori&quot; in 1871, based on a specimen (a male) collected in Tītahi Bay, New Zealand in January, 1866. The following year, 1872, English anatomist William Henry Flower placed it in the genus &quot;Mesoplodon&quot;, while in 1873, Scottish scientist James Hector assigned the same specimen to the species &quot;M. knoxi&quot;. The species remained in the genus &quot;Mesoplodon&quot; until 1962, when Charles McCann, a vertebrate zoologist at the Dominion Museum in Wellington, argued that the species only represented a juvenile of &quot;Berardius arnuxi&quot;. Beaked whale specialist Joseph Curtis Moore (1968) and J. G. B. Ross (1970) contested this designation, arguing that &quot;M. hectori&quot; was a valid species. Adult male specimens from the 1970s and 1980s confirmed the species&#x27; specific status.

=== Molecular Taxonomy ===

With abundant and easily observable species, the use of synapomorphic characters to assign observed individuals to a particular species, is a reasonably effective approach to taxonomy, at least in its rudimentary phase. However, the translation of this approach to rare species with elusive life histories, such as the Hector&#x27;s beaked whales, can be problematic for many reasons. Also, the usefulness of whole or partial &quot;voucher&quot; specimens in private collections to assign taxonomic difference based on morphology is equally susceptible to inaccuracy, and additionally can lead to unethical acquisition methods, such as illegal hunting of a rare species. Therefore, the accurate and ethical approach to the taxonomic study of rare and elusive species, such as are found within the mysterious, deep-diving family Ziphiidae, is a molecular phylogenetic taxonomic methodology. This method has yielded insightful discovery in recent studies of the family Ziphiidae. Between 1975 and 1997, five beaked whales were found stranded in Southern California; based on morphology, four were identified as members of &quot;M. Hectori&quot; and one was identified as a member of &quot;Ziphius cavirostris&quot;. This discovery was puzzling, because although the suspected range of &quot;Ziphius cavirostris&quot; was met by the stranding location, &quot;M. Hectori&quot; was thought to be restricted solely to the Southern Hemisphere. mtDNA sequencing of the sample species revealed that all five individuals could be genetically distinguished from all other members of Ziphiidae, including the two species they were previously identified as. They were subsequently classified as a new species, Perrin&#x27;s beaked whale (&quot;M. Perrini&quot;). More recent phylogenetic analyses of nuclear actin sequences substantiated the validity of this classification, as a distinct 34 base-pair deletion was found in the allele, screened across all species, of the two &quot;M. perrini&quot; samples in particular.

==Description==
Reaching a maximum length around 4.2 m (1.9 m when born), and with an estimated weight around 1 tonne (1.032 tons), Hector&#x27;s is one of the smallest of the beaked whales. It is known from only a few stranded animals and a single confirmed sighting of a juvenile off Western Australia. Hector&#x27;s beaked whales are dark greyish-brown dorsally, paler ventrally. A single female specimen found in Argentina was light grey dorsally and white ventrally. An individual male described in the same study had several scars and teeth marks found diffuse on its back and flanks. Intra-specific male-to-male interactions are possibly the cause for such marks. Additionally, oval white scars on the ventral portion of this male specimen were likely caused from cookie-cutter sharks of the &quot;Isistius&quot; species. Another single adult male specimen had a white beak and white on the anterior portion of the head, with white, linear scars criss-crossing its body, while the juvenile seen off Western Australia had a mask covering its eyes and extending unto its melon and upper beak. The melon, which is not very prominent, slopes quite steeply to the short beak. The dorsal fin is triangular to slightly hooked, small, and rounded at the tip. The leading edge of the dorsal fin joins the body at a sharp angle.

=== Stomach ===
Like other members of the Mesoplodont genus, the stomach is divided into four chambers. The proximal main stomach, the distal main stomach, the connecting stomachs, and the pyloric stomach are the four chambers respectively. The first, second, and fourth chambers are pink in color and soft to touch. The third chamber is grey in color and hard externally. The first and third chamber have internal folds but the folds are longer and larger in the third chamber. The second chamber is smooth, with no folds. The first chamber connects to the esophagus and the fourth chamber connects to the small intestine. The orange gastric fluid found in the stomach has also been found in some areas of the intestines. The specimen&#x27;s stomach from Argentina had many small crystalline lenses in the first and fourth stomachs. Although, other food remains were not present. The specimen&#x27;s stomach also had dozens of nematodes in all the stomach chambers except the connecting chamber. Histo-pathological analysis showed that these nematodes were later found to be of the Anisakis species.

=== Dentition ===
Adult males have a pair of flattened, triangular teeth near the tip of the lower jaw. As with most other beaked whales, the teeth do not erupt in females.

In March 2016, the South Australian Museum conducted a necropsy on a beached female specimen of the species from Waitpinga beach, near Adelaide, South Australia. The specimen was found to have a pair of large fangs not seen among the species typical dentition, especially for females, who typically have none. The fangs are possibly vestigial, or atavisms of some other kind, though a definitive answer is difficult because of the dearth of knowledge about the species.

==Distribution and ecology==
Hector&#x27;s beaked whale has a circumpolar distribution in cool temperate Southern Hemisphere waters between about 35 and 55°S. Most records are from New Zealand, but also reports from Falkland Sound, Falkland Islands, Lottering River, South Africa, Adventure Bay, Tasmania, and Tierra del Fuego, in southern South America have been made. Supposed Northeast Pacific records in the older literature actually refer to Perrin&#x27;s beaked whale.

Sightings are rare due to their deep-ocean distribution, elusive behaviour and possible low numbers. Nothing is known about the diet of this species, although it is assumed to feed on deepwater squid and fish. Because they lack functional teeth, they presumably capture most of their prey by suction.

Body scarring suggests there may be extensive fighting between males, which is common in beaked whales. Nothing is known about breeding in this species.

This species has never been hunted at all, and has not entangled itself in fishing gear. Most records of the whale have been stranded specimens on beaches, particularly in New Zealand.

==Conservation==
Hector&#x27;s beaked whale is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).

<text>The strap-toothed beaked whale (Mesoplodon layardii), also known as Layard&#x27;s beaked whale, is one of the largest members of the &quot;Mesoplodon&quot; genus, growing to in length and reaching up to .
The common and scientific name was given in honor of Edgar Leopold Layard, the curator of the South African Museum, who prepared drawings of a skull and sent them to the British taxonomist John Edward Gray, who described the species in 1865.

==Description==
Adult strap-toothed beaked whales show a distinctive colouration that perhaps makes them one of the most readily distinguishable beaked whale species. Adults have a white beak, with a pale white &#x27;cape&#x27; that extends to halfway between the dorsal fin and head. The dorsal fin is set far back down the body and is white-tipped. The flukes also have white tips. When observed closely, either at sea or when stranded, these whales show a pale neckband that separates the darker grey colouration found upon the head and melon from the rest of the body. While adult whales show striking colouration, juvenile animals are harder to distinguish from other beaked whale species, having a uniform grey colouration. Males can reach around , whereas females reach and likely weigh around . Newborn calves may be up to in length.

Beaked whales show remarkable sexual dimorphism in that only the males retain functional teeth. Male strap-toothed beaked whales begin to develop a large flat tusk from each lower jaw as juveniles, growing at a 45° angle back towards the head and over the rostrum (beak). Reaching up to 34 cm in length, the teeth may overlap at the tips, restricting the gape size of the animal. Two stranded adult male strap-toothed beaked whales were recorded as only being able to open their mouths 3.2 cm and 4 cm wide, compared to females and juveniles that had a gape size of 6.5 cm. It is thought male beaked whales use their teeth to compete for mating access to females, as evidenced by scars and scratches on the bodies of males. However it is unlikely the whale uses the whole tusk for such aggressive interactions, instead, it is probable that only a small denticle found upon the upper surface of the tooth is utilised.

==Geographical range/ distribution==
Based on sporadic sightings and a number of stranded animals, it appears that the strap-toothed beaked whale ranges widely across the Southern Ocean, with a possible circumpolar distribution in sub-Antarctic and temperate waters. Records for the species have been made in Tierra del Fuego and Chubut in Argentina, the Falkland Islands, Western and Southern Australia and New Zealand.

The northernmost extent of the range is continually changing; strandings were noted at 31–32° south of the equator along Brazil&#x27;s southern coast until an emaciated carcass was found at 13° S on Maré Island off the north-east coast of Brazil in 2002. However, in 2011 an adult male strap-toothed beaked whale stranded alive in Myanmar at 16° north of the equator; more than 5000 km further north than the previously accepted range of the species. The whale died and a necropsy revealed that there was no prey within the stomach, but the overall body condition was good.

It is possible that this species migrates due to the seasonality of observed strandings.

==Behaviour==

Little is known about the behaviour of this species. Beaked whales are thought to travel in small groups, and observed group sizes for the strap-toothed beaked whale range from two to ten individuals.
Social structure of mesoplodonts in general is largely understudied, due to the difficulty of observing individuals at sea. It is possible that group sizes and composition are controlled by the type of rostrum and teeth found amongst the various species. Larger and heavily armed species that can inflict wounds generally travel in groups where only one or two males are present, reducing the risk of aggressive interactions.
Despite having large tusks, male strap-toothed beaked whales likely only use a small protruding denticle on each tooth in agonistic interactions. Subsequently, this species may travel in groups with multiple males as the risk of serious injury is lessened.

The species is reported to bask at the water&#x27;s surface on calm days, but is noted to be difficult to approach in vessels. Strap-toothed beaked whales typically do not show their flukes upon diving. A number of observations suggest that diving is typified by a slow descent beneath the surface, with dive duration lasting between 10 and 15 minutes. The species can travel at speed, and may show &#x27;porpoising&#x27; behaviour.
The killer whale (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;) is a documented predator of this species. One was recorded chasing, attacking and killing a solitary adult strap-toothed whale about 50 km offshore of Bremer Bay in south-western Australia.

The main prey of the strap-tooth beaked whale is thought to be oceanic squid species. In an extensive dietary analysis of 14 stranded whales from New Zealand and South Africa, 94.8% of the stomach contents were composed of cephalopods, with evidence of some fish and crustaceans. A difference in the shape of consumed prey was noted between male and female whales, but it was determined that both sexes targeted squid of a similar size. While adult males have a restricted gape size due to the position of their overlapping tusks, it is possible that this allows them to create more suction when feeding, allowing them to forage effectively on the same prey as females and juveniles.

==Population status==
The size of the population is unknown, however it has been noted that the species is one of the more common beaked whale species found in the southern ocean.

==Threats==

Strap-toothed beaked whales have not been commercially hunted; however, they are at risk from entanglement and disturbance from anthropogenic noise. Intense noise, particularly that from sonar, has been shown to cause panic, rapid ascent and subsequent death due to decompression sickness in a number of beaked whale species.

As the species has a largely circumpolar distribution, it is likely to be at risk from the impacts of anthropogenic climate change. The International Union for the Conservation of Nature (IUCN) lists habitat alteration and habitat shift as possible threats related to climate change.

<text>True&#x27;s beaked whale (Mesoplodon mirus) is a medium-sized whale in the genus &quot;Mesoplodon&quot;. It is native to the northern Atlantic Ocean. The common name is in reference to Frederick W. True, a curator at the United States National Museum (now the Smithsonian).

==Taxonomy==
The species was first described in 1913 by Frederick W. True from an adult female that had stranded on the outer bank of Bird Island Shoal, Beaufort Harbor, North Carolina, in July 1912.

Previously, this species was thought to have two separate populations representing potential subspecies; one in the North Atlantic, and another in the southern Indian Ocean. However, in 2021 the Indian Ocean population (which was found to have a significantly wider range throughout the Southern Hemisphere) was described as a distinct species: Ramari&#x27;s beaked whale (&quot;M. eueu&quot;).
==Physical description==


This whale has a normal mesoplodont body, except that it is rotund in the middle and tapering towards the ends. The two distinctive teeth on the males are small and set on the very end of the beak (however additional teeth have been recorded ). The melon is rather bulbous, and leads into a short beak. There is a crease behind the blowhole, and a sharp dorsal ridge on the back near the dorsal fin. The coloration is gray to brownish gray on the back which is lighter below, and notably darker on the &quot;lips&quot;, around the eye, and near the dorsal fin. There is sometimes a dark blaze between the head and dorsal fin as well. One female in the Southern Hemisphere was bluish black with a white area between the dorsal fin and tail as well as a light gray jaw and throat, as well as black speckling. One individual from the Canary Islands had an area of white from snout to blowhole. Scars from fighting and cookiecutter sharks are present on males. This species reaches around with the females weighing and the males weighing . They are around long when born.

==Behavior==

They have been seen in small groups, and are believed to be squid eaters. The most complete description of recorded live sightings and strandings, as well as the first underwater footage, was published in a 2017 article by Natacha Aguilar de Soto in the open access journal PeerJ.

==Population and distribution==
This species lives in the North Atlantic and has stranded from Nova Scotia in the western Atlantic to Ireland in the eastern Atlantic and as far south as Florida, the Bahamas, and Canary Islands. The species does not inhabit the Southern Atlantic and appears to avoid tropical waters.

==Conservation==
This species has not been hunted and has not been a victim of fishing nets. True&#x27;s beaked whale is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS) and the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS). The species is further included in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU).

<doc id="366407" wikidata="Q910093" url="?curid=366407" title="Tropical bottlenose whale">
<text>The tropical bottlenose whale (Indopacetus pacificus), also known as the Indo-Pacific beaked whale or Longman&#x27;s beaked whale, was considered to be the world&#x27;s rarest cetacean until recently, but the spade-toothed whale now holds that position. As of 2010, the species is now known from nearly a dozen strandings and over 65 sightings. This is the only species in the genus Indopacetus.

==History of discovery==
The species has had a long history riddled with misidentifications, which are now mostly resolved. A skull and jaw found on a beach in Mackay, Queensland, in 1882, provided the basis for the initial description of this species by H. A. Longman in 1926. Other researchers were not convinced, and felt this specimen might instead represent a Pacific form of True&#x27;s beaked whale or a female bottlenose whale. Almost 30 years after Longman&#x27;s original publication, a second skull was discovered near Danane, Somalia (1955). This specimen likely stranded on the coast, but was subsequently processed into fertilizer. Only the skull survived. Biologist Joseph C. Moore used this skull, together with the original Mackay specimen, to effectively demonstrate that Longman&#x27;s beaked whale was a unique species and elevated it to its own genus, &quot;Indopacetus&quot;.

Dalebout et al. (2003) used a combination of genetic and morphological analyses to identify four further specimens, including a complete adult female with a fetus found in the Maldives in January 2000. The other remains consisted of a skull from Kenya collected some time before 1968, and two juvenile males from South Africa from strandings in 1976 and 1992. Based on morphological analyses, Dalebout et al. concluded that the genus &quot;Indopacetus&quot; was a valid one. The external appearance and colour pattern of this species was also revealed, and a firm connection was established with the mysterious tropical bottlenose whales that had been sighted in the Indian and Pacific Oceans since the 1960s. While this paper was in press, a specimen that was first misidentified as a Baird&#x27;s beaked whale washed up in Kagoshima, Japan, in July 2002.

==Description==
Longman&#x27;s beaked whales look rather similar to both mesoplodont beaked whales and bottlenose whales, which led to a great deal of taxonomic confusion. The Maldives female had a robust body like the bottlenoses, although this may be a distortion, since the less-decomposed female specimen from Japan had a laterally compressed body typical of &quot;Mesoplodon&quot;. The juvenile specimens have a very short beak similar to a bottlenose whale, but the adult females seen so far have had rather long beaks sloping gently into a barely noticeable melon organ. Additionally, the dorsal fins of adult specimens seem unusually large and triangular for beaked whales, whereas in juveniles they are rather small and swept back.

An adult male specimen has yet to wash up, but sightings of the tropical bottlenose whale indicate they have a rather bulbous melon, two teeth located towards the front of the beak, and scars from fighting with the teeth. Scars from cookiecutter sharks are also rather common on the whale. The rather unusual coloration of the juveniles helped connect the Longman&#x27;s to the tropical bottlenose whale; both have dark backs behind the blowholes, which quickly shade down to a light gray and then white. The blackness from the back extends down to the eye of the whale except for a light spot behind the eye, and then continues on in a line towards the flipper, which is also dark.

Dark markings are also present on the tip of the beak and rostrum. The females have a simpler coloration; the body is typically grayish except for a brown head. The coloration appears to be rather variable in this species. The female specimen from the Maldives was 6 m (20 ft) in length, with a 1 m (3 ft) fetus, and the Japanese female was 6.5 m (22 ft) in length. Reports of tropical beaked whales put them even longer, in the 7 to 9m (23 to 29.5 ft) range, which is larger than any mesoplodont and more typical of a bottlenose whale. No weight estimation or reproductive information is known.

==Behavior==

Tropical bottlenose whale observations indicate they travel in larger groups than any other local species of beaked whales. The size of the pods ranges from the tens up to 100, with 15 to 20 being typical, and the groups appear very cohesive. 

Their pods are sometimes associated with other species, such as short-finned pilot whales, bottlenose dolphins, spinner dolphins, and humpback whales. 

Tropical bottlenose whales have been known to breach the surface, and they normally have visible, but short, blows. Their dives last between 11 and 33 minutes, with one individual diving for least 45 minutes.

==Population and distribution==
Strandings and sightings indicate the species ranges across the Indian Ocean from southern and eastern Africa to the Maldives, Sri Lanka, and east to Myanmar, with a Pacific range extending from Australia to Japan. However, if the sightings of tropical beaked whales are taken into account, the range of this whale is more extensive; they have been sighted from the Arabian Sea including the Gulf of Aden to Guadalupe Island and the Gulf of California (the sightings off Mexico (in 1992 and 1993) are probably extralimital, as they are associated with abnormally warm water during El Niño events). Sightings in the Gulf of Mexico are possible, which may indicate they are present in the tropical Atlantic Ocean, as well. The most frequent observations have occurred off the coasts of Hawaii. Although only a single specimen has washed up in Hawaii, they are apparently rather common; a 2002 survey estimated 766 animals. No other population estimates exist for other locales, although a single individual was apparently identified in the Comoro Islands in the summer of 2002–2003. One whale was observed from a whale-watching vessel off Choshi in December, 2015. Possible sightings were made off Tokara Islands and Bonin Islands, as well. They have also recorded off New Caledonia.

The range of Longman&#x27;s beaked whales was once considered to be restricted to warmer waters of Pacific, but stranding records in recent years revealed they may migrate further north to sub-Arctic regions such as off Hokkaido. No occurrence has been confirmed in the Sea of Japan, but a possible Longman&#x27;s beaked whale stranded on a beach near Vladivostok in 2011.

In 2009, the first confirmed sighting was made of tropical bottlenose whales in the southern Bay of Bengal. In the summer and fall of 2010, researchers aboard the NOAA ship &quot;McArthur II&quot; made two sightings of groups of tropical bottlenose whales off Hawaii. The first sighting consisted of a &quot;large, active group&quot; of over 70 individuals surfacing rapidly and breaching on occasion; the second sighting, late in October, did not last as long, as the group &quot;ran away&quot;. Increasingly more sightings and strandings have been recorded in Taiwan and surrounding small islands such as at Yilan the Green Island, and Orchid Island. An entangled individual was saved by local fishermen off Pakistan in 2015.

Since Dalebout et al. (2003), additional strandings have been reported in the Philippines (2004), Taiwan and Myanmar (2005), the Andaman Islands (2009), and Maui (2010).

==Conservation==
No records report the whale being hunted, although individuals have been trapped in fishing nets off Sri Lanka and a stranding in Taiwan in 2005 involving a cow-calf pair may have been due to nearby naval exercises. The tropical bottlenose whale is covered by the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MOU).

<text>The pygmy beaked whale (Mesoplodon peruvianus), also known as the bandolero beaked whale, Peruvian beaked whale and lesser beaked whale, is the smallest of the mesoplodonts and one of the newest discoveries. There were at least two dozen sightings of an unknown beaked whale named &quot;Mesoplodon sp. A&quot; before the initial classification, and those are now believed to be synonymous with the species. The species was formally described in 1991, based on ten specimens obtained from Peru between 1976 and 1989, including a adult male as the type specimen. A specimen that stranded at Paracas, Peru in 1955 (first tentatively identified as Andrews&#x27; beaked whale) has since been identified as a pygmy beaked whale. Since 1987, there have been an additional 40 sightings of the species, for a total of 65 (as of 2001).

==Description==
The body of the pygmy beaked whale is the rather typical spindle shape of the genus, although the tail is unusually thick. The melon is somewhat bulbous and slopes down into a rather short beak. The mouthline in males has a very distinct arch with two teeth protruding slightly from the gum line before the apex. The coloration is typically dark gray on the top and lighter below, especially on the lower jaw, throat, and behind the umbilicus. Males may have distinct pale &quot;chevron&quot; patterns on their backs. This species&#x27; size is around 4 meters (13 feet) long in mature animals, and around 1.6 meters (5.2  ft) when born.

This beaked whale has been recorded in the eastern tropical Pacific between Baja California and Peru through sightings and strandings. Further strandings have been recorded in Chile () and Monterey Bay (a 3.6 m (11.8 ft) female found at Salinas State Beach), and a fresh specimen in Humboldt County, CA in 1995, 2001, and 2012, respectively, extending the species&#x27; range far to the north and south. Another specimen washed up in New Zealand, although this stranding is considered extralimital.

Little is known about the group behaviors of this whale, and small groups have been seen. Stomach contents reveal at least one specimen is a fish eater, as opposed to the squid normally eaten by the genus. This species may be quite vulnerable to gillnets in Peru, since scientists found six dead adults in a very small sample.

<doc id="366411" wikidata="Q1125029" url="?curid=366411" title="Stejneger's beaked whale">
<text>Stejneger&#x27;s beaked whale (Mesoplodon stejnegeri), also known as the Bering Sea beaked whale or the saber-toothed whale, is a relatively unknown member of the genus &quot;Mesoplodon&quot; inhabiting the North Pacific Ocean. Leonhard Hess Stejneger collected the type specimen (a beach-worn skull) on Bering Island in 1883, from which Frederick W. True provided the species&#x27; description in 1885. In 1904, the first complete skull (from an adult male that had stranded near Newport, Oregon) was collected, which confirmed the species&#x27; validity. The most noteworthy characteristic of the males is the very large, saber-like teeth, hence the name.

==Description==

The body for this species is typical for a mesoplodont, long and tapering at both ends. The beak is of medium length, and the mouthline forms an arch, though much smoother than other species. The teeth of the males are much larger than those of most other mesoplodonts and point forwards and inwards right in front of the apex. Only strap-toothed whales and spade-toothed whales have longer teeth. The coloration is overall dark gray to black on the body with light coloration below, and around the head giving it a &quot;helmeted&quot; appearance. The coloration darkens with age, but females have a light pattern on the bottom of the flukes that becomes more apparent with age. Like most species, scars occur on the males (from other males) and cookiecutter shark bites are present on both sexes. The length is at least for males and for females. They are likely around in length when born.

==Population and distribution==
This is the northernmost species of beaked whale in the Pacific Ocean, ranging up into the Bering Sea. They are distributed along both sides of the Pacific to Miyagi Prefecture, Japan and southern California. They may migrate south in winter.

==Behavior==
The whales are typically found in groups of three to four and sometimes up to 15 animals in a very close group. The groups may have age and sex segregation. Adult males fight each other extensively, and some specimens have been found with healed jaw fractures.

==Conservation==
This species has been occasionally hunted in Japan in the past, and occasionally been caught in drift nets. It is uncertain how much this affects the population.

<doc id="366415" wikidata="Q6013220" url="?curid=366415" title="Ross Noble">
<text>Ross Markham Noble (born 6 June 1976) is an English stand-up comedian and actor. Noble rose to mainstream popularity through making appearances on British television, particularly interviews and on panel shows such as &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot;. He has also released DVDs of several of his tours.

In 2007, he was voted the 10th-greatest stand-up comic on Channel 4&#x27;s &quot;100 Greatest Stand-Ups&quot; and again in the updated 2010 list as the 11th-greatest stand-up comic.

In 2012, Noble made his film debut in the fantasy comedy horror movie &quot;Stitches&quot;. In 2015, he made his musical theatre debut in &quot;The Producers&quot; and in 2018 was nominated for a Laurence Olivier Award for his performance in &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; in the West End.

==Early life==
Noble was born in 1976 in Newcastle upon Tyne and brought up in Cramlington, Northumberland. He was taught at Cramlington Learning Village. Both of his parents were teachers.

==Stand-up performance==

Noble&#x27;s stand-up routine is a largely improvised and surreal performance with a stream of consciousness delivery. He is often referred to as a randomist. Often, a large percentage of his set becomes based around heckles and conversations with members of the audience. Although he does often have a few set topics which he performs throughout a tour, he describes the planning for the entire show as &quot;about four words on a piece of scrap paper&quot;.

Noble often mimes actions on-stage to help the audience visualise his surreal ideas, for example, telling the audience to never put a blanket over an owl, and exactly what an owl neck detection device is (&quot;just a stick with a pointy bit on it&quot;) or showing the audience how to serve double header ice creams properly after considering his own made-up plot of &quot;24&quot; in which Jack Bauer escapes a cell using a greasy goose.

Noble&#x27;s style is recognised as spontaneous, due to his unpredictable performance style, interruptions from hecklers or because he has drifted off into another surreal tangent. During his shows he is known to dabble onto one topic, ask a member of the audience something about him or herself and use that as material, and carry on with that, and later on seems to forget about the routine, digressing into another topic. Thus the audience pesters Noble to tell the ending of his unfinished stories, which are usually eventually concluded at the end of his shows. His most famous example is in his &quot;Randomist&quot; tour, where he started to tell a story about him being interviewed after Live 8 near the beginning of a show in Newcastle, which he did not finish until the end of the performance, around two hours later. This relates to an earlier comment he made in his &quot;Regent&#x27;s Park&quot; show, saying that his mind &quot;Tends to wander off [the point] slightly&quot;, and later added that &quot;[he] can open up too many tangents at once... it&#x27;s a never-ending expanding spiral of possibilities.&quot;

==Career==

===Early years===
Noble is originally from Cramlington, Northumberland, England. &quot;The ultimate place to live&quot; helped him with his career—he found little to do in his hometown so he became particularly imaginative. At the age of 11, it was discovered that he was dyslexic. Because of this, Noble decided to work within a career which did not rely on academic skills. He had a brief stint as a street juggler with a friend, and aspired to join a circus. He joined a clown troupe and sold balloons as a stilt-walker, before deciding to become a comedian after winning tickets to a comedy show. As a teenager, Ross was a member of the youth theatre at the People&#x27;s Theatre in Heaton, Newcastle. In 1997, he was doing warm-ups at the BBC for &quot;Friday Night Armistice&quot;. One of his earliest on-screen appearances was on Richard Whiteley&#x27;s regional chatshow for Yorkshire Television in 1996.

Noble has been performing stand-up since the dyslexia diagnosis, and appeared in his local comedy club at the age of 15, despite licensing laws that prohibited him working there and forced him to leave through the kitchen. Noble studied performing arts at Newcastle College, after he told his careers adviser at school he wanted to be a comedian. He later stated that this had no effect on his stand-up ability, as he believes that the information taught is not important in being a good performer.

===Stand-up career===
Since starting as a stand-up comedian, Noble has won many awards, including a &quot;Time Out&quot; award winner in 2000 for his Edinburgh Fringe Festival show &quot;Chickenmaster&quot;, and a Perrier Award nomination in 1999 for another Edinburgh show &quot;Laser Boy&quot;. He has since achieved great popularity in both the UK and Australia, where he has toured extensively every year since 2001. Noble&#x27;s 2003 show &quot;Unrealtime&quot; was the best-selling show at the Edinburgh Fringe, before transferring to London&#x27;s West End for a monthlong season at the Garrick Theatre where it played to packed houses. A recording of this tour was shown on BBC Two in 2004, and a double-DVD set was released later that year.

During 2004, Noble performed at the Edinburgh Fringe and the Melbourne International Comedy Festival and other venues with his show &quot;Noodlemeister&quot;. His 2005 UK tour, &quot;Randomist&quot;, ran from September to December, of which he continued in Australia during 2006. In April 2006, Noble was involved in a motorbike accident, and both fractured and dislocated his collarbone. Conveniently, he crashed right outside a hospital. Noble performed his shows over the following weeks with his arm in a sling. During his &#x27;Things&#x27; tour, in Bristol on 1 March 2009, he claimed that before the ambulance officers would help him, he was forced to do his Stephen Hawking impression.

While performing in Edinburgh in September 2006 for his &quot;Fizzy Logic&quot; tour, a fight broke out during the gig, caused by a drunken member of the audience arguing with another. Also, in his Edinburgh gig, some one gave him a basket of mini-muffins with faces printed on them; this is related to a sketch from Noble&#x27;s DVD &quot;Sonic Waffle&quot;, in which he mentions his hobby of finding faces in muffins. At another gig, he found someone filming the show on their mobile phone and confiscated the phone. He then recorded a video on it himself. After finding that several people recorded his finale skit, &quot;The falling owl stunt&quot;, Noble encouraged the entire audience to record the stunt simultaneously and post them on YouTube, in an attempt to achieve, &quot;The largest number of videos showing exactly the same thing.&quot; He then took his tour to Australia in February 2007, during which he filmed a documentary about his travels around the country.

In 2007, Noble finished his &quot;Nobleism&quot; tour in the UK with a show in Liverpool on 21 October 2007 which was screened live to 43 Vue cinemas. If the event had sold out, he would have played to over 10,000 people. Upon walking offstage, Noble enquired if the broadcast had succeeded and was informed by a technician that &quot;it worked perfectly... but we lost Aberdeen&quot;. To this day, Noble maintains that this is the &quot;coolest thing anyone has ever said&quot; to him.

Noble likes to have spontaneous material related to each specific show, and therefore encourages heckling and has increasingly indulged in the audience giving him gifts during shows. At a gig at the Edinburgh Playhouse during Noble&#x27;s 2005 &quot;Randomist&quot; tour, a member of the audience put his feet up on the stage, and later removed his shoes and put them on the stage instead. It is now traditional for the entire front row of an Edinburgh audience to place their shoes upon the stage during the interval, which causes Noble much amusement when he returns.

Noble performed at the 2008 Latitude Festival and rounded off his set by leading everyone in the tent in a huge conga line (which quickly turned into a stampede) to a vegan food stand so they could all ask for pies and sausage rolls.

The DVD of his show &quot;Nobleism&quot; was released in November 2009.

===TV and radio===

In 2012, Noble made his film debut in the fantasy comedy horror movie &quot;Stitches&quot; playing the titular character, an undead birthday clown out for revenge.

====Guest appearances====
Noble had not done any acting work on TV until the summer of 2013 when he appeared opposite Ian Smith as a gay lover in the Australian TV series &quot;It&#x27;s a date&quot;, or radio, as he prefers stand-up for giving him the freedom to say what he wants without being influenced by a script or crew. Nevertheless, he has made many TV appearances, which mainly take the form of interviews and panel game participation. In the UK, he has appeared on BBC&#x27;s &quot;Johnny Vaughan Tonight&quot; and &quot;Friday Night with Jonathan Ross&quot;. Noble has also made 16 appearances, the highest number of appearances of any guest, on BBC One&#x27;s &quot;Have I Got News for You&quot; including the first show guest presented by Paul Merton. His most memorable appearance on the show saw him and Paul Merton answer all their questions wrong, and getting no points in the entire show. He was Paul Merton&#x27;s guest on &quot;Room 101&quot;, where he wanted to consign to history the likes of Craig David, cartoon animals who wear clothes, people who look like cats, clipboards and Christian rock music. He makes regular contributions to BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Just a Minute&quot; and has also appeared on &quot;I&#x27;m Sorry I Haven&#x27;t a Clue&quot; and presented &quot;4 At The Store&quot;. In July 2007, Ross featured, as part of his &quot;In The Company Of...&quot;, on the Colin Murray show on BBC Radio 1, and in August 2007 Noble appeared on &quot;Steve Wright in the Afternoon&quot; on BBC Radio 2.

In Australia, he has guested on such TV and radio shows as Network 10&#x27;s &quot;Rove (Live)&quot;, &quot;The Panel&quot;, &quot;Good News Week&quot;, &quot;Thank God You&#x27;re Here&quot;, &quot;Studio 10&quot;, &quot;The Project&quot;, &quot;Would I Lie to You? Australia&quot; and &quot;Hughesy, We Have a Problem&quot;, the ABC&#x27;s &quot;The Glasshouse&quot;, &quot;Spicks and Specks&quot;, and &quot;A Quiet Word With ...&quot;, as well as Triple M radio show &quot;Get This&quot;, regular appearances on Triple J.

In Ireland, he appeared on the first series of &quot;Tubridy Tonight&quot;, where he went over to a prop bookcase to inspect if the books were real. Upon reading one book, he found a photo of Mike Yarwood on one page, which he cut out and wore as a mask for a portion of the interview.

Since 2010, he has made eighteen guest appearances on British comedy panel show &quot;QI&quot;.

In July 2011, Ross appeared in the second episode of the 17th series of &quot;Top Gear&quot;. On the show, he revealed that he currently owns earth moving machines as well as an Abbott 433 self-propelled gun, which he calls his &quot;Tank&quot;. He did a lap around the Top Gear track in 1.43.5, beating Tom Cruise and placing him in second place behind John Bishop.

In 2012, he was a regular panelist on &quot;That Sunday Night Show&quot; on ITV.

In April 2012, he featured on Triple J for a day where he co-hosted some shows, and played an imaginative game of Cluedo, where they found people from around Melbourne that matched the Cluedo characters names to come into the studio and play.

Appears briefly in &quot;TT3D: Closer to the Edge&quot; in conversation with Richard &#x27;Milky&#x27; Quayle.

====Hosted series====
Besides making various guest appearances, Noble has been the host of an Australian radio show, and the subject of two BBC radio series. Noble&#x27;s worldwide travels as a stand-up were the subject of his own BBC Radio 4 series &quot;Ross Noble Goes Global&quot;, produced by Danny Wallace. This series, recorded between April and May 2001, saw him recording his observations as he travelled around various countries. In January 2005, Noble joined Australian comedian Terri Psiakis in co-hosting &quot;Ross and Terri&quot;, the weekday lunch shift on national radio station Triple J. Following on from &quot;Ross Noble Goes Global&quot;, Radio 4 broadcast a new series called &quot;Ross Noble On...&quot; during January to February 2007. The 4-episode series followed his 2006 UK tour, featuring performances in Brighton, York, Manchester and Newcastle. All of the Radio 4 programmes have since been released as BBC audio CDs.

Noble once again teamed up with Terri Psiakis on Triple J for two weeks of &quot;Ross and Terri&quot; in January 2006. This second period on Triple J also saw Ross and Terri founding &quot;Pants Across Australia&quot;, during which, 4 pairs of trousers were sent to the north, south, east and west extremities of Australia and then back to Melbourne. &quot;Ross and Terri&quot; did not return to this slot in 2007, however Terri Psiakis and Amy Blackmur (the pair&#x27;s producer from their 2006 show) did present a limited run of shows during a similar time frame earlier in the year, under the working title &quot;T &#x27;n&#x27; A&quot; (&quot;Terri and Amy&quot;). As well as this, Terri and Amy decided to continue in the evening slot of 6pm – 10pm.

In 2007, Stunt Baby Productions filmed a documentary about Ross Noble&#x27;s 95-day Fizzy Logic tour of Australia. Ross Noble travels by motorbike when touring, which for this tour travelled on a BMW R1150GS Adventure (as mentioned during the encore of one of his Canberra gigs), covering a distance of approximately 26,000 km around Australia clockwise from Brisbane. The show was broadcast as &quot;Ross Noble&#x27;s Australian Trip&quot; on UK TV channel 5 from Monday 28 September 2009 at 10pm for 6 weeks, repeating at the same time on Fiver on the following Thursdays. The show aired in Australia on Channel 10 on Mondays at 10:00 pm.

In 2013-15 Noble hosted his own show on Dave titled &quot;Freewheeling&quot;. Described as an anti-travelogue around Britain, in the show Noble took the freestyle philosophy he embraces in his live shows and utilised his trademark audience participation gimmick and transferred it to television as he rode around the UK on his motorbike taking live requests on Twitter instructing him on where he should go next, making the road trip entirely unpredictable.

====Celebrity contestant====
In October 2020, Noble was announced as a competing celebrity contestant on the fifth season of &quot;The Celebrity Apprentice Australia&quot; in 2021. He finished as the runner-up of the series, raising over $100,000 for his charity, the Australian Red Cross - Disaster Response and Recovery Fund.

===Theatre===
Noble made his musical theatre debut as Franz Liebkind in the 2015 UK tour of Mel Brooks&#x27; &quot;The Producers&quot; from May to July 2015.

In September 2017, he played Igor in another Mel Brooks musical &quot;Young Frankenstein&quot; at the Garrick Theatre in London&#x27;s West End (following a tryout at the Theatre Royal, Newcastle) before leaving in February 2018 due to his Australian stand-up tour. Noble received a WhatsOnStage Award for his performance and was nominated for the Laurence Olivier Award for Best Actor in a Supporting Role in a Musical. During his time in the show, he and co-star Hadley Fraser did a recording called &quot;Poddin&#x27; On The Ritz&quot; to discuss behind-the-scenes at the show and musical theatre.

==Personal life==
Noble has two daughters, with his Australian wife. He lived on a farm in St Andrews, a semi-rural town on the northern outskirts of Melbourne, Australia, until it was destroyed by 2009 Victorian bushfires along with all his material possessions. Noble and his family were not harmed in the fire. The family returned to the UK in 2010. In February 2017, Noble and his family moved back to Australia, purchasing a house in Mount Eliza, Victoria. In September 2019, they sold this property for $2.725 million AUD and moved to the Mornington Peninsula south of Melbourne.

A keen biker and off-road rider, Noble is also a fan of MotoGP, WSBK, and The Isle of Man TT. He has created an off-road track in the paddock at his home, and has a number of vehicles to use on it, including an FV433 Abbot SPG self-propelled gun. He has competed in many races—notably, The Romaniacs and the 24-hour Dusk to Dawn. He attended several track days in 2011, including Brands Hatch on the GP circuit as a guest of MSV aboard his Triumph Daytona 675R.

===Charity work===
Following the 2009 Victoria bushfires, Noble has used the event in his act and donates profits from the sale of the show&#x27;s programme/poster (or &quot;postergram&quot; as it is called) to a charitable fund to help those similarly affected.

Noble supports British charity Riders for Health and donated money earned from limited edition signed posters together with bucket collections after each gig from his Nonsensory Overload tour to Riders for Health. This raised £42,000 for Riders. He has attended their fundraising event Day of Champions on a number of occasions, most recently at Silverstone in 2010. He also voiced the Riders for Health BBC Radio 4 appeal aired just before Christmas 2010.

In May 2011, to celebrate his 20th anniversary of stand-up, Noble teamed up with Triumph Motorcycles which were also celebrating a milestone, having just produced their 500,000th bike (since the company was relaunched 20 years earlier) and did the &quot;Sit Down&quot; tour. Using only Twitter as a guide, Noble travelled around the UK on the unique Triumph Speed Triple guided by his Twitter followers and accompanied by a film crew. The Triumph Speed Triple was auctioned by Bonhams at the Goodwood festival of speed on 1 July 2011, with all the proceeds (£8,000) going to Noble&#x27;s charity of choice, Riders for Health.

In July 2011, Noble competed in the Red Bull Romaniacs, which is &quot;one of the toughest extreme motorcycle events on the planet&quot;. as part of the Desert Rose Racing Team with fellow rider Clive &quot;Zippy&quot; Town (Dakar 2006) with both riders on 350 Exc-F KTMs.

===DVD releases===
Several recorded performances of Noble are available on DVD, notable for the large number of extras that appear on them. Noble&#x27;s recorded shows are mostly dominated by Noble with just a few moments of audience participation. Throughout the rest of his tour Noble is more relaxed, with the audience joining in. However, the audience can sometimes dominate a show, as seen on the extra &quot;Live in Birmingham&quot; gig on the &quot;Randomist&quot; DVD. Although on the official website it states that all of Noble&#x27;s DVDs are region-free, with the exception of &quot;Unrealtime&quot;, his latest two DVDs have only been released in Region 2 format so far.

<text>Iris recognition is an automated method of biometric identification that uses mathematical pattern-recognition techniques on video images of one or both of the irises of an individual&#x27;s eyes, whose complex patterns are unique, stable, and can be seen from some distance. The discriminating powers of all biometric technologies depend on the amount of entropy they are able to encode and use in matching. Iris recognition is exceptional in this regard, enabling the avoidance of &quot;collisions&quot; (False Matches) even in cross-comparisons across massive populations. Its major limitation is that image acquisition from distances greater than a meter or two, or without cooperation, can be very difficult. However, the technology is in development and iris recognition can be accomplished from even up to 10 meters away or in a live camera feed.

Retinal scanning is a different, ocular-based biometric technology that uses the unique patterns on a person&#x27;s retina blood vessels and is often confused with iris recognition. Iris recognition uses video camera technology with subtle near infrared illumination to acquire images of the detail-rich, intricate structures of the iris which are visible externally. Digital templates encoded from these patterns by mathematical and statistical algorithms allow the identification of an individual or someone pretending to be that individual. Databases of enrolled templates are searched by matcher engines at speeds measured in the millions of templates per second per (single-core) CPU, and with remarkably low false match rates.

At least 1.5 billion people around the world (including 1.29 billion citizens of India, in the UIDAI / Aadhaar programme as updated on 30 November) have been enrolled in iris recognition systems for national ID, e-government services, benefits distribution, security, and convenience purposes such as passport-free automated border-crossings. A key advantage of iris recognition, besides its speed of matching and its extreme resistance to false matches, is the stability of the iris as an internal and protected, yet externally visible organ of the eye.

In 2023, Pakistan&#x27;s National Database &amp; Registration Authority (NADRA) has launched IRIS for citizen registration/ Civic Management during registration at its offices for the National ID Card. After its initial stage, the eye-recognition verification access will be available for LEAs, banking sectors, etc.

==History==
Although John Daugman developed and in the 1990s patented the first actual algorithms to perform iris recognition, published the first papers about it and gave the first live demonstrations, the concept behind this invention has a much longer history and today it benefits from many other active scientific contributors. In a 1953 clinical textbook, F.H. Adler wrote: &quot;In fact, the markings of the iris are so distinctive that it has been proposed to use photographs as a means of identification, instead of fingerprints.&quot; Adler referred to comments by the British ophthalmologist J.H. Doggart, who in 1949 had written that: &quot;Just as every human being has different fingerprints, so does the minute architecture of the iris exhibit variations in every subject examined. [Its features] represent a series of variable factors whose conceivable permutations and combinations are almost infinite.&quot; Later in the 1980s, two American ophthalmologists, L. Flom and Aran Safir managed to patent Adler&#x27;s and Doggart&#x27;s conjecture that the iris could serve as a human identifier, but they had no actual algorithm or implementation to perform it and so their patent remained conjecture. The roots of this conjecture stretch back even further: in 1892 the Frenchman A. Bertillon had documented nuances in &quot;Tableau de l&#x27;iris humain&quot;. Divination of all sorts of things based on iris patterns goes back to ancient Egypt, to Chaldea in Babylonia, and to ancient Greece, as documented in stone inscriptions, painted ceramic artefacts, and the writings of Hippocrates. (Iris divination persists today, as &quot;iridology.&quot;)

The core theoretical idea in Daugman&#x27;s algorithms is that the failure of a test of statistical independence can be a very strong basis for pattern recognition, if there is sufficiently high entropy (enough degrees-of-freedom of random variation) among samples from different classes. In 1994 he patented this basis for iris recognition and its underlying computer vision algorithms for image processing, feature extraction, and matching, and published them in a paper. These algorithms became widely licensed through a series of companies: IriScan (a start-up founded by Flom, Safir, and Daugman), Iridian, Sarnoff, Sensar, LG-Iris, Panasonic, Oki, BI2, IrisGuard, Unisys, Sagem, Enschede, Securimetrics and L-1, now owned by French company Morpho.

With various improvements over the years, these algorithms remain today the basis of all significant public deployments of iris recognition, and they are consistently top performers in NIST tests (implementations submitted by L-1, MorphoTrust and Morpho, for whom Daugman serves as Chief Scientist for Iris Recognition). But research on many aspects of this technology and on alternative methods has exploded, and today there is a rapidly growing academic literature on optics, photonics, sensors, biology, genetics, ergonomics, interfaces, decision theory, coding, compression, protocol, security, mathematical and hardware aspects of this technology.

Most flagship deployments of these algorithms have been at airports, in lieu of passport presentation, and for security screening using watch-lists. In the early years of this century, major deployments began at Amsterdam&#x27;s Schiphol Airport and at ten UK airport terminals allowing frequent travellers to present their iris instead of their passport, in a programme called IRIS: Iris Recognition Immigration System. Similar systems exist along the US / Canada border, and many others. In the United Arab Emirates, all 32 air, land, and seaports deploy these algorithms to screen all persons entering the UAE requiring a visa. Because a large watch-list compiled among GCC States is exhaustively searched each time, the number of iris cross-comparisons climbed to 62 trillion in 10 years. The Government of India has enrolled the iris codes (as well as fingerprints) of more than 1.2 billion citizens in the UIDAI (Unique Identification Authority of India) programme for national ID and fraud prevention in entitlements distribution. In a different type of application, iris is one of three biometric identification technologies internationally standardised since 2006 by ICAO for use in e-passports (the other two are fingerprint and face recognition).

== Visible vs near infrared imaging ==
Iris melanin, also known as chromophore, mainly consists of two distinct heterogeneous macromolecules, called eumelanin (brown–black) and pheomelanin (yellow–reddish), whose absorbance at longer wavelengths in the NIR spectrum is negligible. At shorter wavelengths within the VW spectrum, however, these chromophores are excited and can yield rich patterns. Hosseini, &quot;et al.&quot; provide a comparison between these two imaging modalities. An alternative feature extraction method to encode VW iris images was also introduced, which may offer an alternative approach for multi-modal biometric systems.

== Operating principle ==

First the system has to localize the inner and outer boundaries of the iris (pupil and limbus) in an image of an eye. Further subroutines detect and exclude eyelids, eyelashes, and specular reflections that often occlude parts of the iris. The set of pixels containing only the iris, normalized by a rubber-sheet model to compensate for pupil dilation or constriction, is then analyzed to extract a bit pattern encoding the information needed to compare two iris images.

In the case of Daugman&#x27;s algorithms, a Gabor wavelet transform is used. The result is a set of complex numbers that carry local amplitude and phase information about the iris pattern. In Daugman&#x27;s algorithms, most amplitude information is discarded, and the 2048 bits representing an iris pattern consist of phase information (complex sign bits of the Gabor wavelet projections). Discarding the amplitude information ensures that the template remains largely unaffected by changes in illumination or camera gain, and contributes to the long-term usability of the biometric template.

For identification (one-to-many template matching) or verification (one-to-one template matching), a template created by imaging an iris is compared to stored templates in a database. If the Hamming distance is below the decision threshold, a positive identification has effectively been made because of the statistical extreme improbability that two different persons could agree by chance (&quot;collide&quot;) in so many bits, given the high entropy of iris templates.

== Advantages ==
The iris of the eye has been described as the ideal part of the human body for biometric identification for several reasons:

It is an internal organ that is well protected against damage and wear by a highly transparent and sensitive membrane (the cornea). This distinguishes it from fingerprints, which can be difficult to recognize after years of certain types of manual labor. The iris is mostly flat, and its geometric configuration is only controlled by two complementary muscles (the sphincter pupillae and dilator pupillae) that control the diameter of the pupil. This makes the iris shape far more predictable than, for instance, that of the face.

The iris has a fine texture that—like fingerprints—is determined randomly during embryonic gestation. Like the fingerprint, it is very hard (if not impossible) to prove that the iris is unique. However, there are so many factors that go into the formation of these textures (the iris and fingerprint) that the chance of false matches for either is extremely low. Even genetically identical individuals (and the left and right eyes of the same individual) have completely independent iris textures. An iris scan is similar to taking a photograph and can be performed from about 10 cm to a few meters away. There is no need for the person being identified to touch any equipment that has recently been touched by a stranger, thereby eliminating an objection that has been raised in some cultures against fingerprint scanners, where a finger has to touch a surface, or retinal scanning, where the eye must be brought very close to an eyepiece (like looking into a microscope).

The commercially deployed iris-recognition algorithm, John Daugman&#x27;s IrisCode, has an unprecedented false match rate (better than 10−11 if a Hamming distance threshold of 0.26 is used, meaning that up to 26% of the bits in two IrisCodes are allowed to disagree due to imaging noise, reflections, etc., while still declaring them to be a match). While there are some medical and surgical procedures that can affect the colour and overall shape of the iris, the fine texture remains remarkably stable over many decades. Some iris identifications have succeeded over a period of about 30 years.

Iris recognition works with clear contact lenses, eyeglasses, and non-mirrored sunglasses. The early Sensar technology worked by first finding the face, then the eyes, and then took the Iris images. This was all done using infrared lighting. It is possible to identify someone uniquely in a dark room while they were wearing sunglasses.

Mathematically, iris recognition based upon the original Daugman patents or other similar or related patents define the strongest biometric in the world. Iris recognition will uniquely identify anyone, and easily discerns between identical twins. If a human can verify the process by which the iris images are obtained (at a customs station, entering or even walking by an embassy, as a desktop 2nd factor for authentication, etc.) or through the use of live eye detection (which varies lighting to trigger slight dilation of the pupil and variations across a quick scan which may take several image snapshots) then the integrity of the identification are extremely high.

== Shortcomings ==
Many commercial iris scanners can be easily fooled by a high quality image of an iris or face in place of the real thing. The scanners are often tough to adjust and can become bothersome for multiple people of different heights to use in succession. The accuracy of scanners can be affected by changes in lighting. Iris scanners are significantly more expensive than some other forms of biometrics, as well as password and proximity card security systems.

Iris recognition is very difficult to perform at a distance larger than a few meters and if the person to be identified is not cooperating by holding the head still and looking into the camera. However, several academic institutions and biometric vendors are developing products that claim to be able to identify subjects at distances of up to 10 meters (&quot;Standoff Iris&quot; or &quot;Iris at a Distance&quot; as well as Princeton Identity&#x27;s &quot;Iris on the Move&quot; for persons walking at speeds up to 1 meter/sec).

As with other photographic biometric technologies, iris recognition is susceptible to poor image quality, with associated failure to enroll rates. As with other identification infrastructure (national residents databases, ID cards, etc.), civil rights activists have voiced concerns that iris-recognition technology might help governments to track individuals beyond their will. Researchers have tricked iris scanners using images generated from digital codes of stored irises. Criminals could exploit this flaw to steal the identities of others.

The first study on surgical patients involved modern cataract surgery and showed that it can change iris texture in such a way that iris pattern recognition is no longer feasible or the probability of falsely rejected subjects is increased.

==Security considerations==
As with most other biometric identification technology, an important consideration is live-tissue verification. The reliability of any biometric identification depends on ensuring that the signal acquired and compared has actually been recorded from a live body part of the person to be identified and is not a manufactured template. Besides a person&#x27;s physical characteristics, which includes the eyes, one&#x27;s voice and handwriting too, are not protected by the Fourth Amendment even though they are all constantly exposed. Many commercially available iris-recognition systems are easily fooled by presenting a high-quality photograph of a face instead of a real face, which makes such devices unsuitable for unsupervised applications, such as door access-control systems. However, this is not the case with all iris recognition algorithms. The problem of live-tissue verification is less of a concern in supervised applications (e.g., immigration control), where a human operator supervises the process of taking the picture.

Methods that have been suggested to provide some defence against the use of fake eyes and irises include changing ambient lighting during the identification (switching on a bright lamp), such that the pupillary reflex can be verified and the iris image be recorded at several different pupil diameters; analysing the 2D spatial frequency spectrum of the iris image for the peaks caused by the printer dither patterns found on commercially available fake-iris contact lenses; analysing the temporal frequency spectrum of the image for the peaks caused by computer displays.

Other methods include using spectral analysis instead of merely monochromatic cameras to distinguish iris tissue from other material; observing the characteristic natural movement of an eyeball (measuring nystagmus, tracking eye while text is read, etc.); testing for retinal retroreflection (red-eye effect) or for reflections from the eye&#x27;s four optical surfaces (front and back of both cornea and lens) to verify their presence, position and shape. Another proposed method is to use 3D imaging (e.g., stereo cameras) to verify the position and shape of the iris relative to other eye features.

A 2004 report by the German Federal Office for Information Security noted that none of the iris-recognition systems commercially available at the time implemented any live-tissue verification technology. Like any pattern-recognition technology, live-tissue verifiers will have their own false-reject probability and will therefore further reduce the overall probability that a legitimate user is accepted by the sensor.

==Deployed applications==

* United Arab Emirates IrisGuard&#x27;s Homeland Security Border Control has been operating an expellee tracking system in the United Arab Emirates (UAE) since 2003, when the UAE launched a national border-crossing security initiative. Today, all of the UAE&#x27;s land, air and sea ports of entry are equipped with systems. All foreign nationals who need a visit visa to enter the UAE are now processed through iris cameras installed at all primary and auxiliary immigration inspection points. To date, the system has apprehended over 330,000 persons re-entering the UAE with either another name or nationality (which needs a visa), or even fraudulent travel documents.
* Bank United of Texas. In 1999 Bank United became the first bank in the world to deploy iris recognition ATMs. These ATMs were manufactured by Diebold using Sensar iris recognition technology. The pilots deployed by Bank United received national television coverage. Coverage and interviews of Sensar executives and Bank United executives included Good Morning America, USA Today, and many other national television shows.

* Hashemite Kingdom of Jordan - 2009, IrisGuard deployed one of the world&#x27;s first operational iris-enabled automated teller machine at Cairo Amman Bank, where bank customers can seamlessly withdraw cash from ATM&#x27;s without a bank card or pin but simply by presenting their eye to the iris recognition camera on the ATM. Since June 2012, IrisGuard is also providing financial inclusion to UNHCR registered Syrian refugees in Jordan on ATM&#x27;s. The system is designed to facilitate cash-supported interventions that help deliver financial assistance to refugees with speed and dignity while lowering overhead costs and boosting accountability.
* Aadhaar began operation in 2011 in India, whose government is enrolling the iris patterns (and other biometrics) of more than one billion residents for the Aadhaar scheme for entitlements distribution, run by the Unique Identification Authority of India (UIDAI). This programme at its peak was enrolling about one million persons every day, across 36,000 stations operated by 83 agencies. By October 2015, the number of persons enrolled exceeded 926 million, with each new enrollee being compared to all existing ones for de-duplication checks (hence 926 trillion, i.e. 926 million-million, iris cross-comparisons per day). Its purpose is to issue residents a biometrically provable unique entitlement number (Aadhaar) by which benefits may be claimed, and social inclusion enhanced; thus the slogan of UIDAI is: &quot;To give the poor an identity.&quot; Iris technology providers must be granted a STQC (Standardisation Testing and Quality Certification) certificate in order to supply iris scanners for the project. By far, there are providers such as: IriTech Inc. (dual iris scanner IriMagic 100BK), Cogent (CIS-202), Iris ID (icam TD 100), Iris Guard (IG-AD-100), etc.
* Police forces across America planned to start using BI2 Technologies&#x27; mobile MORIS (Mobile Offender Recognition and Information System) in 2012. The New York City Police Department was the first, with a system installed in Manhattan in the fall of 2010.
* Iris recognition technology has been implemented by BioID Technologies SA in Pakistan for UNHCR repatriation project to control aid distribution for Afghan refugees. Refugees are repatriated by UNHCR in cooperation with Government of Pakistan, and they are paid for their travel. To make sure people do not get paid more than once, their irises are scanned, and the system will detect the refugees on next attempt. The database has more than 1.3 million iris code templates and around 4000 registrations per day. The one-to-many iris comparison takes place within 1.5 seconds against 1.3 million iris codes.
* In early 2013, United Nation High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) also installed a new biometrics identity management system (BIMS) by IriTech Inc. for the refugees in the Malawi Camp. During the pilot program, which lasted four weeks, more than 17,000 people enrolled their iris biometric data and had their identities verified. After the successful pilot in Malawi, Thailand was recently chosen to be the first site of the global roll-out. After 5 months, in June 2015, UNHCR has completed its registration for nearly 110,000 Myanmar refugees in Thailand&#x27;s border camps with the help of the new system.
* At Amsterdam Airport Schiphol, Netherlands, iris recognition has permitted expedited, passport-free border security passing since 2001 through the Privium program.
* Canadian Air Transport Security Authority&#x27;s Restricted Area Identity Card (RAIC) program is the world&#x27;s first dual-biometric program deployed around major Canadian airports for staff and aircrews to access the restricted areas using separate channels from passengers.
* In a number of Canadian airports, as part of the NEXUS program that facilitates entry into the US and Canada for pre-approved, low-risk travellers.
* In several Canadian airports, as part of the CANPASS Air program that facilitates entry into Canada for pre-approved, low-risk air travelers.

* UK&#x27;s Iris Recognition Immigration System, which started operating in 2004 but which was closed to new registrations in 2011 and which has been phased out in 2012 and 2013.
* Used in 2002 to verify the recognition of the &quot;Afghan Girl&quot; (Sharbat Gula) by &quot;National Geographic&quot; photographer Steve McCurry.
* Since at least 2011, Google uses iris scanners to control access to their datacentres.
* In 2010, Leon, Mexico, deployed iris scanners in public spaces, that can identify up to fifty people at once.
* On May 10, 2011, Hoyos Group demonstrated a device called EyeLock using iris-recognition as an alternative to passwords to log people into password-protected Web sites and applications, like Facebook or eBay.
* Princeton Identity has been developing an &quot;Iris on the Move&quot; system and set of products, primarily for U.S. Government clients, capable of identifying 30 people per minute. Most recently, they have specialized in a product where drivers can be identified without needing to leave their vehicle.
* M2SYS Technology has deployed their RightPatient biometric patient identification system using iris recognition at 11 Novant Health hospitals in the Charlotte and Winston-Salem markets. The RightPatient iris biometric patient identification system is designed to capture both the face and the iris pattern of patients and uniquely link them to their electronic medical record.
* In March 2015, India&#x27;s Andhra Pradesh state has launched an iris-based identity management solution developed by IriTech for enhancing pension distribution system. The Chief Minister N. Chandrababu Naidu demonstrated IriShield USB MK2120U device during a launching event of Andhra Pradesh state&#x27;s iris scanning facility for pension distribution. &quot;The state&#x27;s decision to use iris technology as a primary method to issue Aadhaar verified DBT (Direct Benefit Transfer) will address concerns of total inclusiveness of its residence as well as providing a more accurate and a hygiene solution,&quot; says Binod E. Mathai, Director of Biometronic Technology.
* On May 28, 2015, Fujitsu released ARROWS NX F-04G the first smartphone with an iris scanner. 
* On mid 2015, the Kenya Ministry of Education, Science and Technology in order to provide an accurate attendance tracking for all students in classes (roll-call) or school buses (getting on/off tracking) has implemented iris biometric system. The solution includes IriTech&#x27;s IriShield camera connecting to a low cost Android phone or tablet via USB cable. Iris matching is done on-board of IriShield whose internal gallery can hold up to 500 identities (expandable to 5,000 identities) which is more than enough for most of the schools. The local matching capability is a particular advantage in the school-bus scenario because it does not require wireless/3G communication between the biometric terminal in the bus and a back-end server. 
* At the end of 2015, Microsoft launched two Lumia phones (Lumia 950 and Lumia 950 XL) featuring iris scanning as a way to authenticate the user.
* In August 2016, Samsung released their first smartphone with iris recognition technology, the Galaxy Note 7, using a front-facing camera and infrared illumination. This technology was provided as an option to unlock the smartphone, and to authenticate the users for different features such as Knox security framework, and to restore the Samsung account password.
* May 1, 2017, the first iris-enabled humanitarian blockchain system in the world was deployed in Azraq Refugee camp in Jordan by IrisGuard. More than 10,000 Syrian refugees use only their eyes without any token to pay for their food on WFP Building Blocks (a Private Ethereum Blockchain on AWS) to redeem their assistance. The project expanded to 100,000 refugees in January 2018.
*March 2018, World Food Program (WFP) started to implement iris recognition in its food distribution system for the first time in Uganda. The country is hosting approximately 1.4 million refugees and asylum-seekers. It is one of the countries with the highest number of refugees in the world. IriTech&#x27;s iris scanner BK 2121U is being used to deliver the right food to the right refugees, making sure that they get the food assistance they are entitled to. WFP plans to scale up the system to 180 food distribution sites across Uganda by the end of the year.
*Sept 2019, ZainCash started to deploy iris recognition to perform cash distribution for refugees and IDPs for the first time using IrisGuard EyePay mobile phone in Kurdistan, Iraq using ZainCash mobile wallet. The world first mobile iris deployment is carried out with United Nations High Commissioner for Refugees (UNHCR) IrisGuard and Zain Iraq.
*In June 2023, Apple introduced the Vision Pro mixed reality headset with a biometric security authentication technology called Optic ID. According to Apple, Optic ID analyzes a user’s iris through LED light exposure and then compares it with an enrolled Optic ID stored on the device’s Secure Enclave. The system can, reportedly, differentiate between the irises of identical twins.

==Iris recognition in television and movies==
* &quot;I Origins&quot; (2014), a Hollywood film by writer-director Mike Cahill and winner of the Alfred Sloan Award for best exposition of technology (2014 Sundance Film Festival), uses iris recognition for its core plot. Culminating in India with the UIDAI project to encode and enroll the iris patterns of one billion or more Indian residents by the end of 2015, the film is described as a &quot;science fiction love story incorporating spiritualism and reincarnation&quot;, seeking to reconcile science with religious spirit-world beliefs.
* Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2002 science fiction film &quot;Minority Report&quot; depicts a society in which what appears to be a form of iris recognition has become daily practice. The principal character undergoes an eye transplant in order to change his identity but continues to use his original eyes to gain access to restricted locations.
* In &quot;The Island&quot; (2005), a clone character played by Ewan McGregor uses his eye to gain access through a security door in the home of his DNA donor.
* &quot;The Simpsons Movie&quot; (2007) features a scene that illustrates the difficulty of image acquisition in iris recognition.
* The TV series &quot;Numb3rs,&quot; features a scene where a robber gets into the CalSci facility by cracking the code assigned to a specific iris.
* &quot;NCIS&quot; uses an iris scanner in the garage, where forensic vehicle investigations are carried out and evidence is stored. There is another scanner at the entrance to MTAC. The sequence of Leroy Jethro Gibbs being verified is shown in the title sequence. The imagery for this sequence has been &quot;enhanced&quot; using special effects. Iris recognition systems do not use the laser like beams shown in the sequence and the light that they do use is near-infrared and nearly invisible.
* The 2010 film Red includes a scene where Bruce Willis&#x27; character uses a contact lens to pass an iris scan and gain access to CIA headquarters.
* The film &quot;Angels and Demons&quot; and also the book featured an iris scanner as the method by which the protagonist broke into CERN and stole one of the antimatter storage modules. 
* The film &quot;Demolition Man&quot; also had a scene where an eyeball on a stick was used to break into a weapons storage facility.

<text>Geometric transformations can be distinguished into two types: active or alibi transformations which change the physical position of a set of points relative to a fixed frame of reference or coordinate system (&quot;alibi&quot; meaning &quot;being somewhere else at the same time&quot;); and passive or alias transformations which leave points fixed but change the frame of reference or coordinate system relative to which they are described (&quot;alias&quot; meaning &quot;going under a different name&quot;). By &quot;transformation&quot;, mathematicians usually refer to active transformations, while physicists and engineers could mean either.

For instance, active transformations are useful to describe successive positions of a rigid body. On the other hand, passive transformations may be useful in human motion analysis to observe the motion of the tibia relative to the femur, that is, its motion relative to a (&quot;local&quot;) coordinate system which moves together with the femur, rather than a (&quot;global&quot;) coordinate system which is fixed to the floor.

In three-dimensional Euclidean space, any proper rigid transformation, whether active or passive, can be represented as a screw displacement, the composition of a translation along an axis and a rotation about that axis.

The terms &quot;active transformation&quot; and &quot;passive transformation&quot; were first introduced in 1957 by Valentine Bargmann for describing Lorentz transformations in special relativity.

== Example ==
As an example, let the vector formula_1, be a vector in the plane. A rotation of the vector through an angle &quot;θ&quot; in counterclockwise direction is given by the rotation matrix:
formula_2
which can be viewed either as an &quot;active transformation&quot; or a &quot;passive transformation&quot; (where the above matrix will be inverted), as described below.

== Spatial transformations in the Euclidean space R3 ==
In general a spatial transformation formula_3 may consist of a translation and a linear transformation. In the following, the translation will be omitted, and the linear transformation will be represented by a 3×3 matrix formula_4.

===Active transformation===
As an active transformation, formula_4 transforms the initial vector formula_6 into a new vector formula_7.

If one views formula_8 as a new basis, then the coordinates of the new vector formula_9 in the new basis are the same as those of formula_10 in the original basis. Note that active transformations make sense even as a linear transformation into a different vector space. It makes sense to write the new vector in the unprimed basis (as above) only when the transformation is from the space into itself.

=== Passive transformation ===
On the other hand, when one views formula_4 as a passive transformation, the initial vector formula_6 is left unchanged, while the coordinate system and its basis vectors are transformed in the opposite direction, that is, with the inverse transformation formula_13. This gives a new coordinate system &quot;XYZ&quot; with basis vectors:
formula_14

The new coordinates formula_15 of formula_16 with respect to the new coordinate system &quot;XYZ&quot; are given by: 
formula_17

From this equation one sees that the new coordinates are given by
formula_18

As a passive transformation formula_4 transforms the old coordinates into the new ones.

Note the equivalence between the two kinds of transformations: the coordinates of the new point in the active transformation and the new coordinates of the point in the passive transformation are the same, namely
formula_20

== In abstract vector spaces ==

The distinction between active and passive transformations can be seen mathematically by considering abstract vector spaces. 

Fix a finite-dimensional vector space formula_21 over a field formula_22 (thought of as formula_23 or formula_24), and a basis formula_25 of formula_21. This basis provides an isomorphism formula_27 via the component map formula_28.

An active transformation is then an endomorphism on formula_21, that is, a linear map from formula_21 to itself. Taking such a transformation formula_31, a vector formula_32 transforms as formula_33. The components of formula_34 with respect to the basis formula_35 are defined via the equation formula_36. Then, the components of formula_37 transform as formula_38.

A passive transformation is instead an endomorphism on formula_39. This is applied to the components: formula_40. Provided that formula_4 is invertible, the new basis formula_42 is determined by asking that formula_43, from which the expression formula_44 can be derived.

Although the spaces formula_45 and formula_46 are isomorphic, they are not canonically isomorphic. Nevertheless a choice of basis formula_35 allows construction of an isomorphism.

=== As left- and right-actions ===

Often one restricts to the case where the maps are invertible, so that active transformations are the general linear group formula_48 of transformations while passive transformations are the group formula_49.

The transformations can then be understood as acting on the space of bases for formula_21. An active transformation formula_51 sends the basis formula_52. Meanwhile a passive transformation formula_53 sends the basis formula_54. 

The inverse in the passive transformation ensures the &quot;components&quot; transform identically under formula_34 and formula_4. This then gives a sharp distinction between active and passive transformations: active transformations act from the left on bases, while the passive transformations act from the right, due to the inverse.

This observation is made more natural by viewing bases formula_35 as a choice of isomorphism formula_58. The space of bases is equivalently the space of such isomorphisms, denoted formula_59. Active transformations, identified with formula_48, act on formula_59 from the left by composition, that is if formula_34 represents an active transformation, we have formula_63. On the opposite, passive transformations, identified with formula_49 acts on formula_59 from the right by pre-composition, that is if formula_4 represents a passive transformation, we have formula_67.

This turns the space of bases into a &quot;left&quot; formula_48-torsor and a &quot;right&quot; formula_49-torsor.

From a physical perspective, active transformations can be characterized as transformations of physical space, while passive transformations are characterized as redundancies in the description of physical space. This plays an important role in mathematical gauge theory, where gauge transformations are described mathematically by transition maps which act &quot;from the right&quot; on fibers.

<doc id="366439" wikidata="Q951591" url="?curid=366439" title="Out (magazine)">
<text>Out is an American LGBTQ news, fashion, entertainment, and lifestyle magazine, with the highest circulation of any LGBTQ monthly publication in the United States. &quot;Out&quot; was owned by Robert Hardman of Boston, its original investor, until 2000. It then changed hands among LPI Media, PlanetOut Inc., Here Media, and Pride Media. In June 2022, Pride Media was acquired by Equal Entertainment LLC, taking on the name Equal Pride.

&quot;Out&quot; is known for the Out100, its annual list of the most &quot;impactful and influential LGBTQ+ people&quot;.

==History==
&quot;Out&quot; was founded by Michael Goff in 1992 as editor in chief and president. The executive editor was Sarah Pettit (since deceased). In 1996, owner Robert Hardman fired Goff and hired Henry E. (Hank) Scott, a former New York Times Co. executive, as president of Out Publishing Inc., with the charge to rescue the financially troubled magazine company. When Scott joined &quot;Out&quot;, the company had annual revenues of less than $4 million and expenses of $7 million. Scott changed &quot;Out&quot; LGBT focus, arguing that gay men and lesbians had little in common other than political and legal issues. He fired Pettit and hired James Collard, editor of &quot;Attitude&quot;, a gay magazine published in the UK, to refocus &quot;Out&quot; on an affluent and style-conscious gay male audience. Audited circulation grew by 67 percent to over 130,000 and the household income of the average &quot;Out&quot; reader, as measured by MRI, grew from $70,000 a year to $90,000 a year. With the help of Lou Fabrizio, a senior advertising executive whom Scott hired from &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Out&quot; began attracting major fashion advertisers and brands such as Saturn, which previously had not advertised in gay publications. Three years after Scott took control of &quot;Out&quot;, it had tripled its revenue and become the largest-circulation gay magazine in US history. Those changes positioned the publication for a sale by Hardman to LPI Media in 2000.

In 2001 the circulation was 100,000. Judy Wieder, who was the first female editor in chief of &quot;The Advocate&quot;, became the first female editorial director of &quot;Out&quot;. By 2006, when the magazine was acquired by PlanetOut, &quot;Out&quot; circulation had reached 130,000. &quot;Out&quot; attracted international attention when it published its debut Power Issue in May 2007, with a cover that featured two models wearing masks of journalist Anderson Cooper and actor Jodie Foster above the cover line, &quot;The Glass Closet&quot;. Some lesbians have criticized &quot;Out&quot; for primarily focusing on gay men. A writer for the website &quot;AfterEllen&quot; noted that in 2008, no lesbians were featured on the magazine&#x27;s cover, and that only 22% of the persons featured in the Out100 were lesbians.

In 2008, &quot;Out&quot;, along with its sister publication &quot;The Advocate&quot;, was purchased by Here Media Inc. Here Media expanded the magazine&#x27;s web presence, OUT.com, and added a mobile application. In April 2012, &quot;Out&quot; laid off the twelve members of its editorial staff with one month severance; editor-in-chief Aaron Hicklin said he intended to hire back most of them as contractors with his new company Grand Editorial.

In 2017, Here Media sold its magazine operations to a group led by Oreva Capital, who renamed the parent company Pride Media. In August 2018, Hicklin stepped down after 12 years as editor-in-chief and was replaced by Phillip Picardi.

Despite editorial changes, &quot;Out&quot; and Pride still faced financial issues and frequent complaints from freelancers and contract employees. In February 2019, &quot;Women&#x27;s Wear Daily&quot; reported that more than forty contributors wrote an open letter to Pride Media and Oreva Capital, its operating entity, as well as its former editorial management partners Grand Editorial and McCarthy LLC, demanding payment for past work. They filed a nonpayment grievance via the National Writers Union. &quot;The National Writers Union is now representing 25 freelance contributors to Out magazine, who are owed more than $40,000 for work that was contracted, produced and published,&quot; the union said in a statement. &quot;The New York Times&quot; detailed the nonpayment issues and that the total owed was in excess of $100,000. The &quot;New York Post&quot; reported Pride Media owed more than $100,000 in unpaid ad commissions to &quot;PinkNews&quot;, a London-based digital publisher catering to the global LGBT audience.

In December 2018, Raquel Willis was appointed as executive editor, becoming the first trans woman to take on a leadership position at the publication. While at &quot;Out&quot;, Willis won a GLAAD Media Award for Outstanding Magazine Article for &quot;The Trans Obituaries Project&quot;.

Picardi left &quot;Out&quot; in December 2019, announcing his abrupt departure via Twitter. In September 2020, David Artavia was appointed as the magazine&#x27;s new editor-in-chief. In January 2020, Diane Anderson-Minshall was named CEO of Pride Media and later that year became the editorial director of &quot;Out&quot;. In June 2022, Equal Entertainment—the largest LGBTQ-owned media company in the United States—acquired Pride Media and took on the name Equal Pride.

== Out100 ==
Since its beginning, &quot;Out&quot; offered an annual list, the Out100, documenting a hundred &quot;influential, inspirational&quot; LGBTQ personalities and celebrities and &quot;founded to celebrate and honor some of the most influential LGBTQIA figures.&quot; In conjunction with the listings is the annual Out100 Awards honoring a handful of that year&#x27;s celebrities with: Ingenue of the Year, Reader&#x27;s Choice, Artist of the Year, and Entertainer of the Year. In 2019, editor Phillip Picardi said the Out100 was the magazine&#x27;s &quot;greatest and most well-known tradition&quot;. &quot;Out&quot; introduced a Reader&#x27;s Choice Award in 2013 in addition to its editorially curated list of the top 100 honorees.

<text>Mathematical puzzles make up an integral part of recreational mathematics. They have specific rules, but they do not usually involve competition between two or more players. Instead, to solve such a puzzle, the solver must find a solution that satisfies the given conditions. Mathematical puzzles require mathematics to solve them. Logic puzzles are a common type of mathematical puzzle.

Conway&#x27;s Game of Life and fractals, as two examples, may also be considered mathematical puzzles even though the solver interacts with them only at the beginning by providing a set of initial conditions. After these conditions are set, the rules of the puzzle determine all subsequent changes and moves. Many of the puzzles are well known because they were discussed by Martin Gardner in his &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; column in Scientific American. Mathematical puzzles are sometimes used to motivate students in teaching elementary school math problem solving techniques. Creative thinkingor &quot;thinking outside the box&quot;often helps to find the solution.

<doc id="366446" wikidata="Q4357982" url="?curid=366446" title="Lincoln Alexander">
<text>Lincoln MacCauley Alexander (January 21, 1922 – October 19, 2012) was a Canadian lawyer and politician who became the first Black Canadian to be a member of Parliament in the House of Commons, a federal Cabinet Minister (as federal Minister of Labour), a Chair of the Worker&#x27;s Compensation Board of Ontario, and the 24th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 1985 to 1991. Alexander was also a governor of the Canadian Unity Council.

Alexander was born in Toronto to Caribbean immigrant parents. After service during World War II, he received a Bachelor of Arts from McMaster University in 1949 before earning his law degree from Osgoode Hall Law School in 1953. A member of the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada, he became the first black Member of Parliament in Canadian history after being elected to the House of Commons in the 1968 Canadian federal election. He was named Minister of Labour in 1979 under prime minister Joe Clark, holding the position until the PC party&#x27;s defeat in the 1980 election. He resigned from the House of Commons later that year and became Chair of the Worker&#x27;s Compensation Board of Ontario.

In 1985, he was appointed Lieutenant Governor of Ontario, holding the position until 1991. From 1991 to 2007, he became Chancellor of the University of Guelph, becoming the first person to serve five terms in that capacity. He died in 2012 and was accorded a state funeral. Ryerson University (now Toronto Metropolitan University)&#x27;s faculty of law was renamed in his honour in 2021.

==Early life and education==
Alexander was born on January 21, 1922, in a row house on Draper Street near Front Street and Spadina Avenue in Toronto, Ontario. He was the eldest son of Mae Rose (née Royale), who immigrated from Jamaica, and Lincoln McCauley Alexander Sr., a carpenter by trade who worked as a porter on the Canadian Pacific Railway, who had come to Canada from St. Vincent and the Grenadines. Lincoln had a younger brother Hughie, born in 1924, and an older half-brother Ridley &quot;Bunny&quot; Wright, born to his mother in 1920 prior to her marriage to his father.

Alexander went to Earl Grey Public School where he was the only Black child in his kindergarten class. He noted in his memoir that he &quot;never raced home from school and cried&quot; but earned the respect of his classmates, sometimes by fighting. This taught him &quot;to always walk tall, and with a certain bearing, so people knew I meant business&quot;. In his 2006 memoir, &quot;Go to School, You&#x27;re a Little Black Boy&quot;, Alexander recalled: &quot;Blacks at that time made up a sliver-thin portion of the city&#x27;s population, and racial prejudice abounded.&quot; When the family moved to the east end of Toronto, and he attended Riverdale Collegiate, Alexander knew only three Black families. &quot;The scene in Toronto at that time wasn&#x27;t violent, though you had to know your place and govern yourself accordingly.&quot;

His family was religious and enjoyed a social life centred on regularly attending a Baptist church in downtown Toronto. His father was a stern disciplinarian who wanted his son to play the piano. Alexander preferred various sports, including track, soccer, hockey, softball, and boxing; he never learned to swim. His size made him uncoordinated so he was not a natural athlete.

As a teen Alexander&#x27;s mother moved to Harlem with his half-brother Ridley after his father beat her violently. Lincoln and his brother Hughie were cared for by Sadie and Rupert Downes until his mother could send for one of them. She chose Lincoln; Hughie remained with the Downes family and the brothers grew apart.

In New York he attended DeWitt Clinton High School, the only member of his family to do so. He recalled in his memoir, &quot;[G]iven the message about education that had been pounded into my head since I was a young child, the fact those kids didn’t go to school was an eye-opener for me.&quot; As a black community, Harlem allowed him to find role models who worked at jobs that did not involve manual labour.

===Second World War===
In 1939, after Canada declared war on Germany, his mother sent him back to Toronto to live with his father. Lincoln met Yvonne (Tody) Harrison at a dance in Toronto. The youngest of four daughters of Robert, a railway porter, and his wife Edythe (née Lewis), Harrison lived in Hamilton, Ontario. Alexander was smitten by her and resolved to marry her. Because he was too young to enlist in the armed forces, he took a job as a machinist making anti-aircraft guns at a factory in Hamilton to be close to her.

He first distinguished himself in service to Canada in 1942 as a corporal and wireless operator in the Royal Canadian Air Force during the Second World War. He served in many parts of the country including Portage La Prairie. He was ineligible for combat duty because of poor eyesight.

While stationed in Vancouver, he was refused service at a bar because of his race. He reported the incident to a superior officer who refused to take action. Alexander quit the Air Force in 1945 and was granted an honourable discharge. Of that incident, he said: &quot;[A]t that time they didn&#x27;t know how to deal with race relations of this sort of thing; they just turned a blind eye to it.&quot;

===Post-secondary schooling and legal career===
After the war Alexander completed his studies at Hamilton&#x27;s Central Collegiate and then entered McMaster University in 1946 to study economics and history, receiving a BA in 1949.

At age 25, on September 10, 1948, he married Yvonne &quot;Tody&quot; Harrison, five years his senior. Upon graduating in 1949, he applied for a sales job at Stelco, a steel plant in Hamilton, Ontario. Although he had references, the support of McMaster and the mayor of Hamilton, Stelco was unwilling to have a black man on its sales force. He declined their offer of his old summer job working in the plant.

In 1948, Alexander&#x27;s mother died at age 49, suffering from dementia; his father committed suicide four years later. He married his first wife, Yvonne Harrison, in 1948; their only child, a son Keith, was born in 1949. In 1986, Alexander said in a &quot;Chatelaine&quot; magazine interview: &quot;My mother was the single biggest influence on me–before my wife, I’ve always regretted that she didn’t live to see me graduate from university.&quot;

Alexander then attended Osgoode Hall Law School in Toronto. While there, he suggested to the Dean during a lecture that he was using inappropriate language: &quot;looking for a nigger in a woodpile&quot;. Challenging the Dean he said: &quot;But you can&#x27;t say that because you have to show leadership. You&#x27;re in a position of authority, a leader in the community. A leader has to lead and not be using such disrespectful comments without even thinking about them.&quot; Of the incident he recalled: &quot;I don&#x27;t know whatever made me stand up and ask him that in a class of 200 people. ... But I will tell you one thing, that day made me a man.&quot; His actions did not end his career as he feared and Alexander graduated from Osgoode Hall in 1953.

After articling for Sam Gottfried, the only job offer he received was from Helen and Ted Okuloski, a brother and sister who had started their own practice in Hamilton when they were unable to find jobs with existing firms. Here he practiced real estate and commercial law and established a political base in the German and Polish communities in Hamilton. Two years later Alexander partnered with Dave Duncan, forming the firm Duncan &amp; Alexander, which he claimed was the first inter-racial law partnership in Canada. Alexander bought his own home on Proctor Blvd in the east end of Hamilton in 1958 and was able to move his family out of his in-laws&#x27; house. He lived there for nearly four decades.

In 1960, he and his wife visited twenty-three countries in Africa as volunteers with Operation Crossroads Africa, a trip he said that made him realize: &quot;In Africa, I was a black man and I was somebody.&quot; Alexander wrote in his memoir:

The experience was an eye-opener for me not only as a lawyer but also as a human being because I began to realize what black people could do. I saw that, unlike the Hollywood version, these Africans were men and women of significant talents. I became conscious of my blackness. I had come from a white world. Now we were in Africa, and I realized we are people of skill and creativity. I was a black man and I was a somebody. I started standing tall.

In 1962, Alexander&#x27;s partnership with Duncan was dissolved. He joined former McMaster classmate Jack Millar in the firm Millar, Alexander, Tokiwa and Isaacs, which eventually became known as &quot;the United Nations law firm&quot;. In his memoir, Alexander recalls: &quot;A Caucasian, a black, Japanese and a Native Canadian. We were white, black, yellow and red, we used to laugh.&quot; He has appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel in 1965.

==Politics==
In 1965, Alexander ran in the Canadian federal election as the Progressive Conservative Party of Canada candidate in the Hamilton West electoral district but was defeated. He ran again in the 1968 federal election and on June 25, 1968, he won the seat, becoming Canada&#x27;s first black Member of Parliament.

On September 20, 1968, he made his maiden speech in the House of Commons saying:&quot;I am not the spokesman for the Negro; that honour has not been given to me. Do not let me ever give anyone that impression. However, I want the record to show that I accept the responsibility of speaking for him and all others in this great nation who feel that they are the subjects of discrimination because of race, creed or colour&quot;

In 1970, Alexander voted in favour of the &quot;War Measures Act&quot; invoked by then Prime Minister Pierre Trudeau but later felt he had erred in this decision, saying: &quot;[T]he issue of limiting rights has far more serious implications than I thought at the time. You become vulnerable, grasped by the tentacles of Government power.&quot; In 1976, he voted to abolish capital punishment in a free vote introduced by the governing Liberal party.

Alexander wrote in his memoir that he did not shy away from voting with the Liberal government if an issue warranted his support. As an example, he threatened to break ranks with his own party to vote in favour of anti-hate legislation, saying &quot;screw you&quot; to his party&#x27;s argument that it would curtail freedom of speech. &quot;Are you saying that you can call my son or daughter a nigger and that is free speech?&quot; he asked during debate on the bill. Heath MacQuarrie, then a Tory MP from Prince Edward Island, stood up and said, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to let Linc stand alone on this.&quot; Together they led 17 members of their caucus in support of the government&#x27;s legislation.

It was Alexander and Newfoundland MP John Lundrigan who provoked Trudeau into mouthing an obscenity in the House of Commons during a discussion of training programs for the unemployed in February 1971. This quickly became known as the &quot;fuddle duddle&quot; incident.

Alexander was an observer to the United Nations in 1976 and 1978 and served briefly as Minister of Labour in the Progressive Conservative Party&#x27;s minority government headed by Joe Clark from 1979 to 1980.

He held the seat through four successive elections until resigning his seat on May 27, 1980, when he was asked by then Premier of Ontario Bill Davis to serve as chairman of the Ontario Worker&#x27;s Compensation Board. He misunderstood Davis&#x27;s request and recalled: &quot;I said [to the Premier], &#x27;do you think this is going to give you the black vote around here, the vote of the visible minority ...?&#x27; I will never forget his look; he was extremely angry. I shouldn&#x27;t have said that.&quot;

==Viceregal service==
In 1985, on the advice of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, Governor General Jeanne Sauvé appointed Alexander Lieutenant Governor of Ontario. He became the first black person to serve in a viceregal position in Canada. (James Douglas, who was of mixed descent, was Governor of Vancouver Island and of British Columbia prior to Canadian Confederation when these were British colonies with no connection to the Canadas.)

During his appointment, he focused attention on multicultural issues and education, racism, and youth issues. As viceroy he visited 672 communities, held 675 receptions, received roughly 75,000 guests, attended 4,000 engagements, and visited 230 schools.

==Later life==

Alexander served as Chair of the Workers Compensation Board of Ontario from 1980 to 1985. The organization underwent its most extensive legislative overhaul since 1915 during his tenure. Also during his tenure, the WCBO sanctioned the use of chiropractors, over the objections of doctors, and created an independent appeals tribunal.

In 1992, Alexander was appointed to the Order of Ontario and became a Companion of the Order of Canada. From 1991 to 2007, he served as Chancellor of the University of Guelph. His fifteen-year term as Chancellor exceeded that of any of his predecessors, and he assumed the office of Chancellor Emeritus in June 2007. He was succeeded as Chancellor by then broadcaster Pamela Wallin.

In 2000, Alexander was named Chair of the Canadian Race Relations Foundation, where he remained an active spokesman on race relations and veterans&#x27; issues. Until the time of his death, he was the Honorary Patron of the Hamilton, Ontario, branch of St. John Ambulance, as well as Honorary Chief of the Hamilton Police Service and Honorary Commissioner of the Ontario Provincial Police.

In November 2006, his autobiography &quot;Go to School, You&#x27;re a Little Black Boy: The Honourable Lincoln M. Alexander: A Memoir&quot; was published. The title reflects advice his mother had given him as a boy.

==Death==

Alexander died in his sleep on the morning of October 19, 2012, aged 90. The national and provincial flags outside the Ontario Legislative Building were flown at half-mast and tributes were given by various viceroys and politicians.

His body lay in state, first inside the Ontario Legislative Building at Queen&#x27;s Park, then at Hamilton City Hall.

He was survived by his son Keith Lincoln Alexander from his marriage to his first wife Yvonne Harrison (died 1999). He was also survived by daughter-in-law Joyce Alexander and grandchildren Erika and Marissa Alexander, and his second wife Marni Beal whom he married in 2011.

Alexander was accorded an Ontario state funeral conducted by the Reverend Allison Barrett. With the co-operation of thousands of officials, both Provincial and Federal, and Police Services across Canada, and featuring the Burlington Teen Tour Band and, Police Pipe and Drum band, it was conducted at Hamilton Place and attended by 1,500 people. Those in attendance included then-Prime Minister Stephen Harper, former Ontario Premier Dalton McGuinty, then-Ontario Premier Kathleen Wynne, Governor General David Johnston, former Governor General Michaëlle Jean, former Prime Minister Joe Clark, federal cabinet minister Julian Fantino, Dr. Alastair Summerlee, President of the University of Guelph, and Dr. Peter George, former President of McMaster University in Hamilton, Ontario. Also in attendance were the chairman of the Raptors Foundation and the publisher of the Hamilton newspaper, &quot;The Spectator&quot;.

==Legacy==
In December 2013 the legislature of Ontario proclaimed January 21 &quot;Lincoln Alexander Day&quot; in the province. In December 2014 Parliament passed a law designating January 21 &quot;Lincoln Alexander Day&quot; across Canada, which was observed for the first time in 2015.

In 2018, Canada Post marked Black History Month with stamps featuring Alexander and Kay Livingstone.

Several schools have been named in his honor.

The Lincoln M. Alexander Parkway municipal expressway in Hamilton, Ontario, was named in his honour.

On May 6, 2021, Ryerson University&#x27;s faculty of law was renamed the Lincoln Alexander School of Law in his honour.

<text>The balboa (sign: B/.; ISO 4217: PAB) is, along with the United States dollar, one of the official currencies of Panama. It is named in honor of the Spanish explorer and conquistador Vasco Núñez de Balboa. The balboa is subdivided into 100 &quot;centésimos&quot;.

==History==
The balboa replaced the Colombian peso in 1904 following the country&#x27;s independence. The balboa has been tied to the United States dollar (which is also legal tender in Panama) at an exchange rate of 1:1 since its introduction and has always circulated alongside dollars.

Panama has never had an official central bank. The National Bank of Panama, one of two government-owned banks, was responsible for nonmonetary aspects of central banking in Panama, assisted by the National Banking Commission (&quot;Superintendencia del Mercado de Valores&quot;), which was created along with the country&#x27;s International Financial Center, and was charged with licensing and supervising banks.

==Coins==
===Current===
===Obsolete===

In 1904, silver coins in denominations of , 5, 10, 25, and 50 centésimos were introduced. These coins were weight-related to the 25 gram 50 centésimos, making the centésimos coin 1.25 grams. Its small size led to it being known as the &quot;Panama pill&quot; or the &quot;Panama pearl&quot;. In 1907, copper-nickel , and centésimo coins were introduced, followed by copper-nickel 5 centésimo coins in 1929. In 1930, coins for , , and balboa were introduced, followed by 1 balboa in 1931, which were identical in size and composition to the corresponding U.S. coins. In 1935, bronze 1 centésimo coins were introduced, with centésimo pieces minted in 1940.

In 1966, Panama followed the U.S. in changing the composition of their silver coins, with copper-nickel-clad and balboa, and .400 fineness balboa. One-balboa coins, at .900 fineness silver, were issued that year for the first time since 1947. In 1973, copper-nickel-clad balboa coins were introduced. 1973 also saw the revival of the centésimos coin, which had a size similar to that of the U.S. half dime, but these were discontinued two years later due to lack of popular demand. In 1983, 1 centésimo coins followed their U.S. counterpart by switching from copper to copper-plated zinc. Further issues of the 1 balboa coins have been made since 1982 in copper-nickel without reducing its size.

Modern 1, 5 centésimo, , , and balboa coins are the same weight, dimensions, and composition as the U.S. cent, nickel, dime, quarter, and half dollar, respectively. In 2011, new 1-balboa bimetallic coins were issued that are the same dimensions as the U.S. dollar coin.

In addition to circulating issues, commemorative coins in denominations of 5, 10, 20, 50, 75, 100, 150, 200, and 500 balboas have also been issued. At the time the .925 fineness sterling silver 20 balboa coin honoring Simón Bolívar was introduced in 1971, it was the largest legal tender silver coin in the world, containing 3.85 ozt silver and having a 61 mm diameter.

==Banknotes==

In 1941, President Arnulfo Arias pushed the government to enact Article 156 to the constitution, authorizing official and private banks to issue paper money. As a result, on 30 September 1941, El Banco Central de Emisión de la República de Panamá (&quot;Central Bank of Issue of the Republic of Panama&quot;) was established. Arias was deposed in a coup in October and the new banknotes were withdrawn and most destroyed.

Panama uses U.S. banknotes as its main form of cash.

<text>James Karl Bartleman (24 December 1939 – 14 August 2023) was a Canadian diplomat and author who served as the 27th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 2002 to 2007.

Bartleman was a son of Percy Scott Bartleman and Maureen Florence Bartleman (Simcoe). He grew up in the Muskoka town of Port Carling, and he was a member of the Chippewas of Mnjikaning First Nation. In 1963, he earned a Bachelor of Arts degree (BA) in History from the University of Western Ontario, where he was initiated as a member of Phi Delta Theta.

From 2007 to 2012, Bartleman was the Chancellor of the Ontario College of Art and Design (OCAD) in Toronto.

==Foreign service career==
Prior to taking on the role of lieutenant governor, Bartleman had a distinguished career of more than 35 years in the Canadian foreign service. In 1967, he began his diplomatic career in what was then known as the Department of External Affairs (now Global Affairs Canada). Following an assignment in Bogota, Colombia, Bartleman was given the task in 1972 of opening Canada&#x27;s first diplomatic mission in the newly independent People&#x27;s Republic of Bangladesh. Bartleman later served in a diplomatic posting in Brussels. At External Affairs, Bartleman headed the Commonwealth Caribbean Division for several years. He was then made Canada&#x27;s ambassador to Cuba (Havana) from 1981 to 1983. Upon his return from Cuba, he was appointed director general of security and intelligence for the Department of External Affairs. In 1986, Bartleman was appointed Canada&#x27;s Ambassador to Israel (Tel Aviv), while also serving as non-resident High Commissioner to Cyprus. In 1990, Bartleman was named Canadian Ambassador to the North Atlantic Council of the North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) in Brussels, Belgium. In 1994, Bartleman returned to Ottawa, where he served in the Privy Council Office as foreign policy advisor to Prime Minister Chretien. In 1998, Bartleman became Canada&#x27;s High Commissioner to the Republic of South Africa (Pretoria). In February 1999, while in Cape Town to attend the opening of Parliament, Bartleman was attacked and robbed by an assailant. Later that year, he was reassigned to Australia (Canberra), where Bartleman served as High Commissioner. In 2000, Bartleman was named ambassador to the European Union in Brussels.

Bartleman was director of security and intelligence for the Department of External Affairs at the time of the 1985 Air India Bombing. On 3 May 2007, he testified at the Air India Inquiry that he had presented an intelligence document to the RCMP warning of a possible attack days prior to the bombing. Bob Rae, who had been tasked with advising deputy PM Anne McLellan, later admitted that he never bothered to interview Bartleman, the former head of intelligence for Foreign Affairs Canada.

==Lieutenant Governor of Ontario==
Bartleman was sworn in as the 27th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario on 7 March 2002. He was Ontario&#x27;s 41st Vice-regal representative (27th since confederation, 41st since the establishment of the post in 1792).

As is traditional to a vice-regal appointment, Bartleman used his position to spearhead three initiatives that he personally identified with and considered important. During his mandate as Lieutenant Governor, he sought to:
# Reduce the stigma of mental illness;
# Fight racism and discrimination;
# Promote literacy among First Nations children.

To these ends, he initiated the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s Book Program in 2004. He has collected over 1.2 million books, donated from all corners of the province from both institutions and individuals, to stock school libraries in First Nations communities, particularly in Northern Ontario. In 2005, to further promote literacy and bridge building, Bartleman initiated a program to pair up Native and non-Native schools in Ontario and Nunavut, and set-up summer camps for literacy development in five northern First Nations communities.

==Personal life and death==
Bartleman was related to honorary Chief of the Mnjikaning Indians John Bigwin, on his mother&#x27;s side.

James Bartleman died on 14 August 2023, at the age of 83.

Unlike most vice-regal funerals, which are public, Bartleman&#x27;s funeral was private but flags flew at half mast.

==Writing==
Bartleman published several works of non-fiction, both before and during his viceregal term. These included the childhood memoirs &quot;Out of Muskoka&quot; (2002) and &quot;Raisin Wine: A Boyhood in a Different Muskoka&quot; (2007), and the professional career memoirs &quot;On Six Continents&quot; (2004) and &quot;Rollercoaster: My Hectic Years as Jean Chrétien&#x27;s Diplomatic Advisor&quot; (2005).

Following the end of his viceregal term, Bartleman has also published a trilogy of social justice novels, &quot;As Long as the Rivers Flow&quot; (2011), &quot;The Redemption of Oscar Wolf&quot; (2013) and &quot;Exceptional Circumstances&quot; (2015). &quot;As Long as the Rivers Flow&quot; was a finalist for the 2013 Burt Award for First Nations, Métis and Inuit Literature.

<text>Christopher Gilbert Pérez (born August 14, 1969) is an American guitarist, best known as lead guitarist for the Tejano band Selena y Los Dinos. He married the frontwoman of the group, Selena, on April 2, 1992. Pérez grew up in San Antonio, Texas as one of two children of Gilbert Pérez and Carmen Medina. In 1986, he began his tenure by joining Shelly Lares&#x27; band. By the late 1980s, Pérez was respected among Tejano musicians for his guitar skills. This caught A.B. Quintanilla&#x27;s attention; at the time, A.B. was seeking another guitarist for the band he produced, Selena y Los Dinos. Between one and two years after Pérez joined the band, he and Selena began a personal relationship.

Selena&#x27;s father, Abraham Quintanilla, forced them to end their relationship because he felt Pérez&#x27;s image might damage Selena&#x27;s career. They ignored his threats that he would disband the group, and continued their relationship. Abraham fired Pérez from the band, forbidding Selena to go with him. Pérez wed Selena in 1992. On March 31, 1995, Selena was shot and killed by her former friend and former manager of her boutiques, Yolanda Saldívar. Selena&#x27;s murder greatly devastated Pérez, who began abusing drugs and alcohol.

Pérez formed the Chris Pérez Band and began writing songs for their debut album. They signed with Hollywood Records and released their first album, &quot;Resurrection&quot;, which won a Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock or Alternative Album. The band disbanded after their second album, &quot;Una Noche Mas&quot; (2002), was released. Pérez continued in the music business and often played with A.B.&#x27;s groups, the Kumbia Kings and the Kumbia All Starz. He left both groups and formed another band (the Chris Pérez Project, which included American singer Angel Ferrer) in 2010. In 2012, Pérez wrote a book about his relationship with Selena, entitled &quot;To Selena, with Love&quot;.

== Early life ==
Christopher Pérez was born on August 14, 1969, in San Antonio, Texas to Gilbert Pérez, a computer programmer, and Carmen Medina. He is of Mexican-American ancestry. Perez&#x27;s parents divorced in 1974, when he was four years old. His mother remarried in 1978.

Pérez learned to play the French horn in middle school and joined his school&#x27;s concert band with his mother&#x27;s support. He decided to teach himself to play electric guitar despite his mother&#x27;s disapproval due to the negative stereotypes associated with the rock-and-roll world. Pérez&#x27;s favorite musicians were Van Halen, Mötley Crüe, Def Leppard, Kiss, the Scorpions, Ozzy Osbourne and Iron Maiden. He also grew to admire Ricky Martin during the 1990s. Many of his guitar solos are inspired by Carlos Santana.

Pérez wanted to run away to Los Angeles, California to start a rock band when he was seventeen. At the time, he shared an apartment with his father and worked at a library. Pérez was asked by Tony Lares to join his cousin Shelly Lares&#x27; band in 1986. Lares told Pérez that Shelly performed Tejano music—a mixture of traditional Mexican folk music, polkas and country music sung in Spanish or English. Pérez disliked Tejano music and wrote in &quot;To Selena, With Love&quot; that he joined Shelly&#x27;s band with &quot;foot-dragging resistance&quot; because this job paid more than working at the library. He became Shelly&#x27;s musical director after Tony left the group, and co-wrote three songs for Shelly&#x27;s debut album in 1989. His guitar playing received a positive reception from the band and its fans. Around this time, he also formed a rock band with two friends and planned to leave Shelly&#x27;s band.

== Career ==

=== 1989–1995: Selena y Los Dinos ===
Roger Garcia, lead guitarist for Selena y Los Dinos, married and left the music business in 1989. The group&#x27;s bassist, A.B. Quintanilla III, had heard good things about Pérez from other Tejano groups. He and other band members went to watch Pérez rehearse with Shelly. Quintanilla invited Chris to one of Selena&#x27;s performances, and asked if he was interested in playing with Selena y Los Dinos. Pérez accepted, basing his decision on Los Dinos&#x27;s sound, which was more &quot;hip and sophisticated&quot; than other Tejano bands, and he hoped to learn more about musical arrangement from A.B., whose work he admired.

Pérez auditioned for the group&#x27;s manager, A.B.&#x27;s father Abraham Quintanilla Jr. Abraham initially disliked Pérez&#x27;s rocker image and insisted that he change his appearance for the band. The elder Quintanilla feared that allowing Pérez in the group might affect his daughter Selena&#x27;s &quot;perfect image&quot; and ruin her career. A.B. convinced his father to accept Pérez, and encouraged Pérez to explore different musical genres and mold their sounds to his own tastes. He and A.B became close friends occasionally collaborated on writing songs for Selena&#x27;s next recording. Pérez, like Selena, knew little Spanish, and lead keyboardist Ricky Vela tutored him.

==== Relationship with Selena ====
In 1989 Pérez and A.B. wrote Selena&#x27;s Coca-Cola commercial jingle. After the company accepted the lyrics and Selena filmed the commercial, A.B. treated the band to a vacation in Acapulco, Mexico. During the trip Pérez realized he was attracted to Selena although he had a girlfriend in San Antonio. Pérez thought it best for both of them if he tried to distance himself from her, but found it difficult and decided to try building a relationship with her. They expressed their feelings for each other at a Pizza Hut restaurant, and shortly afterwards became a couple. They hid their relationship from her father out of fear that Abraham would try to break them up. This stressed Selena, who did not want to hide her feelings.

Suzette ended up reporting the relationship to Abraham, who took Pérez off the bus and informed him that it was over. The couple continued their relationship secretly despite Abraham&#x27;s disapproval. Selena took hope from the fact that her mother Marcella approved of their courtship, until one day when Abraham stopped the tour bus and went to the back where Pérez and Selena were sitting. He shouted that their relationship was over and Selena screamed back at him. Pérez tried to calm them both down, but joined in the argument after Abraham insulted him by calling him a &quot;cancer in my family.&quot; Finally Abraham threatened to disband the group if they did not break up. Intimidated, Selena and Pérez backed off. Abraham fired him from the band and prevented Selena from running off with him, leaving Selena both extremely devastated and heartbroken.

After Pérez was fired from the band, he moved back in with his father and began playing music wherever he could. He wrote that &quot;free of that nerve-racking situation with her father and the other members of Los Dinos, I started enjoying my life again.&quot; Selena, however, suffered from their separation and the two tried to keep in touch while she was touring. On the morning of April 2, 1992, Selena pounded on his hotel-room door. She forced her way in and began to cry, saying she could not go on without him. Selena wanted to get married that day, but Pérez argued it was not the right thing to do at the moment. Selena insisted her father would never accept their relationship, and would not attend any wedding they planned. Pérez agreed and they eloped in Nueces County, Texas.

Selena was sure her father would leave them alone if they were married, and they could be together openly. They planned to keep the elopement a secret until she found the right moment to reveal her marriage, but the media announced their elopement over the radio within hours of the marriage ceremony. Selena&#x27;s family tried to track her down. Abraham did not take the news well, and alienated himself for a time. Selena and Pérez moved into an apartment in Corpus Christi until Abraham approached them, apologized, accepted the marriage and Pérez back into the band.

Pérez became a fully accepted member of the Quintanilla family after the marriage, and Abraham asked Pérez to write songs for a rock band he was managing after he opened a recording studio, Q-Productions, in late 1993. That collaboration resulted in a posthumous recording for Selena when the lead vocalist for that rock group, Nando &quot;Guerro&quot; Dominguez, went to Selena&#x27;s house to begin a recording. Pérez was ending the recording session several hours later when Selena asked to record Dominguez&#x27;s demo. Her version of the song was unreleased until 2004, when it was added to her posthumous compilation album &quot;Momentos Intimos&quot; as &quot;Puede Ser&quot;. A.B. wrote &quot;Ya No&quot;, the last recording for Selena&#x27;s studio album &quot;Amor Prohibido&quot; (1994). He wanted to turn it into a rock song and asked for Pérez&#x27;s assistance.

=== 1995–1998: After Selena, remarriage and fatherhood ===

In spring 1995, Abraham found out that Yolanda Saldívar, who managed Selena&#x27;s boutiques and fan club, was embezzling money. They held a meeting in early March, with Saldívar denying she had anything to do with fiscal discrepancies in checks that were found written in her name. Selena tried to repair her friendship with Saldívar despite her father&#x27;s warnings. On March 30, 1995, Selena and Pérez met with Saldívar at a motel to recover missing financial papers for tax purposes. When Selena and Pérez arrived home she found that Saldivar did not give her the correct documents. She phoned Saldívar, who tried to convince Selena to return to her motel room alone. Pérez insisted that it was too late, and he did not want Selena driving alone at night. Selena then agreed to meet with Saldivar the next morning.

On March 31, Selena woke up early to meet Saldívar at the motel where she was staying. She met with Saldívar, who delayed the transfer of papers with a story about having been raped in Mexico. Selena took Saldívar to a local hospital, where doctors found no evidence of rape. When they returned to the motel room, Selena ended their four-year working relationship. As Selena turned to leave, Saldívar reached into her purse, pulled out a Taurus Model 85 .38 caliber revolver, pointed it at Selena and pulled the trigger. The bullet entered Selena&#x27;s right shoulder blade from the back, piercing a major artery running from her heart and exiting from just below her right collarbone. She ran to the motel lobby and collapsed to the floor. As the motel employees gathered round, she named Saldívar as her assailant. Selena was transferred to a nearby hospital, where doctors found the damage irreparable. She was pronounced dead within the hour.

Pérez could not eat for two days after his wife&#x27;s murder. In his book he says that when he could not sleep he began abusing alcohol and other drugs, and went into seclusion. Family members noticed he was rapidly losing weight. Chris felt guilty for not protecting Selena from Saldívar.

In 1996, he moved out of his Corpus Christi house and back in with his father in San Antonio. John Garza introduced him to Venessa Villanueva, and after getting to know each other they became a couple in 1998. In 2001, Pérez married Villanueva and they had two children, a boy Noah and a girl Cassie.

Although it was rumored that Villanueva did not want to divorce, and wanted to try and work things out in their relationship, the couple finally decided their relationship was irreconcilable. They filed for divorce in 2008. Despite getting married again and having 2 children, Pérez has since remained in touch with the Quintanillas following Selena&#x27;s death.

=== 1999–2010: Chris Pérez Band, Kumbia Kings and Kumbia All Starz ===

Pérez&#x27;s friend, John Garza moved in with him six months after Selena&#x27;s death. They began writing music, which Pérez found healing. In 1998 he formed a rock band with Garza, Rudy Martinez (former member of La Mafia) on bass, former Selena y Los Dinos keyboardist Joe Ojeda and Jesse Esquivel on drums. The band&#x27;s name (the Chris Pérez Band) was chosen by Garza, Martinez, Ojeda and Esquivel. Chris preferred the name Cinco Souls, but the other band members wanted to utilize his &quot;reluctant celebrity.&quot; The band was signed to Hollywood Records, and went to A&amp;M Studios (now Henson Studios) in Los Angeles to begin recording their debut album. Pérez wrote the song &quot;Best I Can&quot; to explore his feelings about losing Selena and his struggle to continue without her. The song was not planned for the album, for fear that listeners would think he included the track for commercial reasons, but Hollywood Records and the band convinced him to include it on the album after hearing the demo.

&quot;Another Day&quot; (about devotion to Selena) was included on the album. Ojeda wrote &quot;Solo Tu&quot;, a romantic ballad which Pérez changed into a rock song. &quot;Resurrection&quot; was released on May 18, 1999, and won the 2000 Grammy Award for Grammy Award for Best Latin Rock, Urban or Alternative Album. The record company released two promotional singles (one English and one Spanish: the title track and the ballad &quot;Por Que Tu Fuiste&quot;) to radio stations with intent to appeal to both audiences. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote that the album was &quot;upbeat and danceable, the lyrics speak almost uniformly of loss, anger, violence and abandonment&quot;. The Chris Pérez Band was the opening act for Mexican band Mana. In March 2000, Pérez began preparing for his second studio album; On April 16, the band released its second and final album, &quot;Una Noche Más&quot;, before breaking up. Pérez joined his brother-in-law A.B.&#x27;s band, the Kumbia All Starz, in 2006 and left it in 2010 to form his own band. On April 7, 2005, Los Dinos reunited at the &quot;Selena ¡VIVE!&quot; tribute concert.

=== 2010–present: The Chris Pérez Project, &quot;To Selena, With Love&quot;, Blue Mariachi Productions ===
In 2010, Pérez formed a new group (the Chris Pérez Project) with Puerto Rican singer Angel Ferrer, releasing &quot;Todo es Diferente&quot;.

In March 2012 Pérez published &quot;To Selena, With Love&quot;, which described their relationship and struggles. He had been reluctant to write the book, saying that fans asked him to write it. He did not seek the approval of the Quintanilla family to write &quot;To Selena, With Love&quot; and did not disclose the project in fear of their reaction. He approached Abraham after the book was finished. Abraham approved of it. In an interview with &quot;The Hollywood Reporter&quot;, Pérez said writing &quot;To Selena, With Love&quot; helped him &quot;move forward&quot;. The book was praised by critics and fans. &quot;To Selena, With Love&quot; dispelled the rumor that Selena was pregnant when she died (which had appeared in media reports after her death).

In November 2016, Pérez announced that a made-for-television miniseries would be made from his book. This prompted Abraham to file a lawsuit against him since it violated an estate properties agreement originally signed between him and the family two months after Selena&#x27;s death in 1995. The lawsuit also sparked a bitter dispute between the family and Pérez, who in September 2020, went on Instagram and publicly accused the Quintanilla family of erasing his legacy with Selena. Suzette posted a rebuttal shortly thereafter and Perez later apologized. The case was settled in September 2021.

In August 2021 Pérez&#x27;s label Blue Mariachi Productions signed its first act, ZEUS. El Mero Necio alias Carlton Zeus.

In December 2021, the 1997 biopic &quot;Selena&quot; was inducted into the National Film Registry on the film&#x27;s 25th anniversary. Pérez recognized the occasion by posting a statement and photo of a white rose.

== Personality and musical influences ==
According to &quot;The Dallas Morning News&quot;, Hollywood.com, &quot;Justice for Selena&quot;, &quot;They Died Too Young&quot; and &quot;Selena: Como La Flor&quot;, Pérez is a shy person. He was the antithesis of Abraham Quintanilla&#x27;s &quot;clean-cut, nice kids&quot; in his early career as a guitarist for Selena y Los Dinos, a rebellious rocker and a &quot;long-haired tough guy&quot;. In an interview with the &quot;Corpus Christi Caller-Times&quot;, he admitted discomfort at being an entertainer. Until the release of his book, he had kept quiet about his personal life and shied away from media attention. Carlos Valdez, the District Attorney who prosecuted Yolanda Saldívar, described Pérez as &quot;shy and uncomfortable when in the spotlight&quot;, and this was echoed by the &quot;Corpus Christi Caller-Times&quot;. His inability to talk about himself when interviewed was also discussed in Valdez&#x27; book. Valdez said the music business was not work for Pérez, who enjoyed being a guitarist and called it his &quot;reason for [his] existence&quot;. Valdez considers him &quot;honest, sincere, and someone who could be trusted and believed [in].&quot;

Leila Cobo of &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine believed his musical styles included contemporary cumbia music, reminiscent of music produced by A.B., R&amp;B, rap and funk music. Chuck Taylor, a &quot;Billboard&quot; editor, called The Chris Pérez Project debut album a &quot;lot of classic rock elements&quot;. David Cazares of the &quot;Sun Sentinel&quot; called Pérez&#x27; debut album &quot;average rock&quot; music. The &quot;San Antonio Express-News&quot; said that &quot;Resurrection&quot; was a fusion of &quot;pop rock grooves and Tejano soul&quot;. Pérez is known for tapping into Latin genres, such as cumbia and Latin rock.

In the 1997 biopic-film, &quot;Selena&quot;, Pérez was portrayed by Jon Seda while actor Jesse Posey portrayed him in &quot;&quot;.

<text>Henry Newton Rowell &quot;Hal&quot; Jackman (born June 10, 1932) is a Canadian billionaire businessman who served as the 25th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 1991 to 1997. He is the son of former Member of Parliament Harry Jackman and philanthropist Mary Rowell Jackman. His mother was the daughter of another former Member of Parliament, Newton Rowell. His sister, Nancy Ruth, is a philanthropist who was appointed to the Senate in 2005.

==Life and career==
Jackman was educated at Pickering College, the University of Toronto Schools, Upper Canada College (where he was a member of Jackson&#x27;s House), the University of Toronto Faculty of Law, and the London School of Economics.

He was the chairman of the board of National Trust Company and The Empire Life Insurance Company, businesses primarily owned and controlled by his family. In 1964, he married Maruja Trinidad Duncan.

Jackman was the Progressive Conservative candidate in the Toronto riding of Rosedale, which had been previously held by his father, in the 1963, 1965 and 1974 Canadian federal elections. He lost on all three occasions to Liberal Donald Stovel Macdonald.

Jackman was a longtime fundraiser for the Progressive Conservatives, and he became a supporter of the Canadian Alliance when it was formed prior to the 2000 election. He was also an advocate of the Unite the Right movement, which resulted in the creation of the Conservative Party of Canada.

==Viceregal appointment==
Jackman was appointed as Lieutenant Governor of Ontario by Governor General Ray Hnatyshyn in 1991, on the advice of Prime Minister Brian Mulroney, and he became a Member of the Order of Canada the same year. He focused on support for the arts, history and national unity during his time in office.

He served as Lieutenant Governor until 1997 and was then appointed to the Order of Ontario in 1998. He was promoted to Officer in the Order of Canada in the year 2000.

==Other distinctions==
Jackman did not serve in the military, but he received the Canadian Forces&#x27; Decoration in recognition of his time as an honorary colonel of the Governor General&#x27;s Horse Guards, a Toronto militia unit.

He was named chancellor of the University of Toronto in 1997. Following his retirement from that post, he was elected as the fourth Visitor of Massey College.

<text>John Black Aird (May 5, 1923 – May 6, 1995) was a Canadian lawyer, corporate director, and political figure. He served in the Senate of Canada from 1964 to 1974, and he was Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 1980 to 1985.

==Life and career==
Aird was born in Toronto, Ontario, and was the grandson of Sir John Aird, a prominent Canadian banker. He was educated at Upper Canada College, Trinity College and Osgoode Hall Law School. Aird was a Brother at the Toronto Chapter of Alpha Delta Phi.

During World War II, Aird served in the Royal Canadian Naval Volunteer Reserve. In July 1944, he married Lucille “Jane” Housser.

Aird practised law in Toronto and headed his own firm, Aird &amp; Berlis, in 1974. He also served as a director of several corporations. In 1958, he was appointed to the board of directors of Callaghan Mining. He later was chairman of the board of Algoma Central Railway.

From 1964 to 1974, he was a Liberal party Senator. In 1971, he served as chairman of the Canada-United States Permanent Joint Board on Defence. From 1977 to 1985, he was Chancellor of Wilfrid Laurier University in Waterloo.

Aird was appointed an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1976, and he served as 23rd Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 1980 to 1985. The main focus of his mandate was Ontarians with disabilities. He wrote a book, &quot;Loyalty in a Changing World&quot;, about the contemporary function of the Lieutenant Governor.

He was lieutenant governor when, 22 days into the 33rd Parliament of Ontario, Premier Frank Miller resigned following his Progressive Conservative government&#x27;s defeat due to a motion of no confidence. The defeat occurred after an accord had been reached between David Peterson&#x27;s Liberals and Bob Rae&#x27;s New Democratic Party to allow Petersen to form a minority government for two years with NDP support, despite the fact that the Liberals had slightly fewer seats than the Tories. Some media outlets, such as the conservative &quot;Toronto Sun&quot;, compared the matter to the King-Byng Affair and accused Aird of partisanship for asking Peterson to form a government rather than dissolving the legislature and calling a new election.

==Honours==

In 1983 Algoma Central launched a ship named the &quot;John B. Aird&quot;. Aird had previously been chairman of the board of Algoma Central Railway.

After his term as lieutenant governor, Aird became chancellor of the University of Toronto, his &quot;alma mater&quot;. He was made an Honorary Senior Fellow of Renison University College in 1985. He also served as Governor of the Royal Canadian Geographical Society.

Aird was appointed to the Order of Ontario in 1987, and he was promoted to Companion of the Order of Canada in 1992. He died in Toronto in 1995.

<doc id="366477" wikidata="Q86483" url="?curid=366477" title="Black Friday (shopping)">
<text>Black Friday is the Friday after Thanksgiving in the United States. It traditionally marks the start of the Christmas shopping season and is the busiest shopping day of the year in the United States. Many stores offer highly promoted sales at heavily discounted prices and often open early, sometimes as early as midnight or even on Thanksgiving. Some stores&#x27; sales continue to Monday (&quot;Cyber Monday&quot;) or for a week (&quot;Cyber Week&quot;).

&quot;Black Friday&quot; has evolved in meaning and impact over the years, initially referring to calamitous days, with a notable early instance being Black Friday (1869) in the US. This financial crisis saw a dramatic plunge in gold prices, affecting investors. The term was later used in American retail, starting ambiguously in the 1950s. Initially associated with workforce absence post-Thanksgiving, it was reinterpreted by Philadelphia police to describe the shopping-induced congestion. Attempts at rebranding to &quot;Big Friday&quot; failed, and the term &quot;Black Friday&quot; solidified by the 1980s, referring to the pivotal point where retailers purportedly shifted from loss (&quot;in the red&quot;) to profit (&quot;in the black&quot;). This day marks the unofficial start of the Christmas shopping season, with promotional sales aiming to draw large crowds. Black Friday is the busiest shopping day of the year in the United States and retailers prioritize it and Cyber Monday as highly profitable holiday shopping days.

The concept has since globalized, with countries around the world adopting &quot;Black Friday&quot; sales to mimic the US phenomenon, adjusting local customs or creating similar events. The advent of online shopping and events like &quot;Cyber Monday&quot; have expanded the traditional one-day shopping frenzy into a broader holiday shopping season, diluting the singular focus of Black Friday, and expanding its economic impact.

== Etymology ==

For centuries, the adjective &quot;black&quot; has been applied to days upon which calamities occurred. Many events have been described as &quot;Black Friday&quot;, although the most significant such event in American history was the Panic of 1869, which occurred when financiers Jay Gould and James Fisk took advantage of their connections with the Grant Administration in an attempt to corner the gold market. When President Grant learned of this manipulation, he ordered the Treasury to release a large supply of gold, which halted the run and caused prices to drop by 18%. Fortunes were made and lost in a single day, and the president&#x27;s own brother-in-law, Abel Corbin, was ruined.

The earliest known use of &quot;Black Friday&quot; to refer to the day after Thanksgiving occurred in the journal, &quot;Factory Management and Maintenance&quot;, for November 1951, and again in 1952. Here it referred to the practice of workers calling in sick on the day after Thanksgiving, in order to have a four-day weekend. However, this use does not appear to have caught on. Around the same time, the terms &quot;Black Friday&quot; and &quot;Black Saturday&quot; came to be used by the police in Philadelphia and Rochester to describe the crowds and traffic congestion accompanying the start of the Christmas shopping season. In 1961, the city and merchants of Philadelphia attempted to improve conditions, and a public relations expert recommended rebranding the days &quot;Big Friday&quot; and &quot;Big Saturday&quot;, but these terms were quickly forgotten.

The use of the phrase spread slowly, first appearing in &quot;The New York Times&quot; on November 29, 1975, in which it still refers specifically to &quot;the busiest shopping and traffic day of the year&quot; in Philadelphia. Although it soon became more widespread, &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; reported in 1985 that retailers in Cincinnati and Los Angeles were still unaware of the term.

As the phrase gained national attention in the early 1980s, merchants objecting to the use of a derisive term to refer to one of the most important shopping days of the year suggested an alternative derivation: that retailers traditionally operated at a financial loss for most of the year (January through November) and made their profit during the holiday season, beginning on the day after Thanksgiving. When this was recorded in the financial records, once-common accounting practices would use red ink to show negative amounts and black ink to show positive amounts. Black Friday, under this theory, is the beginning of the period when retailers would no longer be &quot;in the red&quot;, instead of taking in the year&#x27;s profits. The earliest known published reference to this explanation occurs in &quot;The Philadelphia Inquirer&quot; for November 28, 1981.

Since the early 21st century, there have been attempts by US-based retailers to introduce a retail &quot;Black Friday&quot; to other countries around the world. Retailers outside the US have attempted to promote the day to remain competitive with US-based online retailers.

In more recent decades, global retailers have adopted the term and date to market their own holiday sales.

== History ==

Thanksgiving&#x27;s relationship to Christmas shopping led to controversy in the 1930s. Retail stores would have liked to have a longer shopping season, but no store wanted to break with tradition and be the one to start advertising before Thanksgiving. For this reason, in 1939, President Franklin D. Roosevelt issued a presidential proclamation proclaiming Thanksgiving to be the fourth Thursday in November rather than the last Thursday, meaning in some years one week earlier, in order to lengthen the Christmas shopping season. Most people adopted the President&#x27;s change, which was later reinforced by an act of Congress, but many continued to celebrate Thanksgiving on the traditional date.

In 2015, Amazon.com was the first to offer &quot;Black Friday in July&quot; deals on what they called &quot;Prime Day&quot;, promising better deals than on Black Friday. Amazon repeated the practice in 2016 and 2017, and other companies began offering similar deals.

Analyst Marshal Cohen of The NPD Group claimed in 2020 that Black Friday is declining in favor of online shopping, and that the COVID-19 pandemic has accelerated this process. The pandemic also resulted in holiday deals being offered over a longer period of time, even as early as October. Fewer people shopped in person on Black Friday 2020, and most business took place online. Market research company Numerator said sellers of clothing, tools and other items considered nonessential during lockdowns were not promoted as heavily because lower production meant less available to sell. Adobe Analytics reported that online sales reached $9 billion in 2020, 22% more than the previous year. Foot traffic to stores fell 48% in 2020 from last year, according to RetailNext, while Sensormatic Solutions reported a 52% decrease.

=== &quot;Black Thursday&quot; ===

For many years, retailers pushed opening times on Black Friday earlier and earlier, eventually reaching midnight, before opening on the evening of Thanksgiving. Kmart opened its stores on Thanksgiving as early as 1991, and was open on Thanksgiving Day for many years. In 2009, Kmart manager Freddy Moss opened at 7 p.m. on Thanksgiving in order to allow shoppers to avoid Black Friday traffic and return home in time for dinner with their families. Two years later, a number of retailers began opening at 8 p.m. or 9 p.m., on what became derisively known as &quot;Black Thursday&quot;. In subsequent years, other stores followed this trend, opening earlier and earlier on Thanksgiving, or remaining open all day, beginning in the early morning hours. Some retail and media sources have used the terms &quot;Gray Thursday&quot; or &quot;Brown Thursday&quot; instead.

The 2014 &quot;Black Thursday&quot; sales were generally a failure, as overall sales for the holiday week-end fell 11% compared to the previous year despite heavy traffic at the stores on Thanksgiving night. In response, a number of retailers decided to go back to closing on Thanksgiving for 2015, and Walmart, although its holding firm opening on the holiday and holding its sale, also pledged to offer the same deals online for those who wished to stay home.

Retailers have received pushback from some consumers over opening on Thanksgiving Day. Shopper opposition to stores opening on Thursday includes the perceived over-commercialization of Thanksgiving, retail workers not being able to spend time with their loved ones on the holiday, and Thursday doorbuster sales forcing consumers to sacrifice enjoying Thanksgiving evening with their families in order to avoid missing out on highly sought-after items which might not be available again prior to Christmas.

Most retailers abandoned efforts to hold doorbuster sales on Thanksgiving in 2020; large crowds had been forbidden under most circumstances since March due to the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, major retailers such as Walmart and Target had already reduced their hours and dropped 24/7 operations in response to the pandemic, and several retailers known for opening on the holiday (particularly Kmart, which has typically been open regular hours) have rapidly declined. According to Adobe Analytics, online shopping set a record on Thanksgiving 2020 with $5.1 billion in total spending, 21.5% higher than in 2019. Most major retailers again closed on Thanksgiving in 2021, with Target stating that its decision would be permanent; the small minority of retail chains remaining open on the holiday that year were limited mainly to pharmacies, dollar stores and grocery stores, retail categories that traditionally do not hold doorbusters.

== Black Friday around the world ==

===Africa===

====Egypt====
Black Friday, in Egypt, started in 2014, being introduced as White Friday. The change of name was due to religious, traditional, and cultural concepts.

====Libya====

Black Friday deals started in Libya since 2019, also introduced as White Friday due to religious, traditional and cultural concepts.

===Asia===
==== Pakistan ====
The use Black Friday shopping festival terminology started in 2014 in major cities of Pakistan which later changed with &quot;Blessed Friday&quot; due to the religious reasons and welcomed by all religions and ethnic societies of Pakistan. Now Blessed Friday (Black Friday) shopping festival is being observed regularly all over Pakistan.

==== India ====

The holiday shopping season in India has traditionally been aligned around the &quot;festive period&quot; of major festivals usually falling around October or November, such as Diwali. Similar to US-style shopping events such as Black Friday, online retailers adopted the practice of holding multi-day promotions during this period, such as Amazon&#x27;s &quot;Great Indian Festival&quot; and Flipkart&#x27;s &quot;Big Billion Days&quot;. India&#x27;s Independence Day (August 15) had also recently attracted similar events.

Nonetheless, the concept of Black Friday has also been imported into the subcontinent via international retailers – a move that influenced some Indian retailers to also adopt the promotion.

====Saudi Arabia====

In Saudi Arabia, black Friday started when a local e-commerce platform noon.com created Yellow Friday Sale which is now an annual event.

====United Arab Emirates====

U.A.E. Black Friday started as White Friday campaign in 2014. In 2018 local e-commerce platform noon.com created Yellow Friday in the U.A.E.. The Yellow Friday Sale is now an annual event in U.A.E., falling around the same time as Black Friday globally.

===Europe===

====Belgium====
Black Friday in Belgium is seriously marketed by retailers since 2016. Especially online shops have broke sales records during the last edition of Black Friday, which provides a base for further growth of popularity of Black Friday in Belgium. After 2016, Black Friday in Belgium has grown strongly. The participating shops have increased to over seventy during the Black Friday period of 2017. During Black Friday 2018, a total of 119 participating stores were measured in Belgium.

==== France ====
French businesses are slowly introducing the Black Friday custom into the market. Discounts of up to 85% were given by retailing giants such as Apple and Amazon in 2014. French electronics retailers such as FNAC and Auchan advertised deals online, while Darty also took part in this once-a-year monster sale. Retailers favored the very American term &quot;Black Friday&quot; to &quot;Vendredi noir&quot; in their advertisements. In 2016, because of the terror attacks in Paris in November the year before, some retailers used the name &quot;Jour XXL&quot; (XXL day) instead of Black Friday. An alternative was brought up by some online businesses in 2018, called &quot;French Days&quot;, which goal is to replicate Black Friday during spring season (starting around the first day of May).

On November 20, 2020, the French government finalized an agreement with e-commerce businesses like Amazon and supermarket chains to postpone Black Friday promotions by a week. Discounted shopping promotions were to begin on December 4 instead, after physical stores shuttered during the COVID-19 pandemic were allowed to reopen.

==== Germany ====

In Germany, &quot;Black Friday&quot; retailer advertisements refer to &quot;Black Week&quot; and &quot;Black Shopping&quot; in English with sales lasting an entire week (excluding Sundays when most retail stores are closed). During this sales period, stores keep their normal working hours. Although goods are offered at reduced prices, the prices are not cut significantly more than normal weekly price reductions. Apple was the first company to run a special Black Friday campaign for the German market in 2006. Apple never used the name Black Friday in Germany, but promotes only a &quot;one-day shopping event&quot;. In the first years, mostly internet retailers have used the event as an occasion to attract new customers with discounts, but bricks and mortar stores have already begun to adapt.

====Ireland====

Black Friday was introduced in 2014.

====Latvia====

In 2017, Black Friday became widely popular in Latvia. There was even a Black week and Black week-end sales in shopping centres.

====Liechtenstein====

In Liechtenstein, Black Friday Sale is a joint sales initiative by hundreds of online vendors. Over its first 24-hour run on November 28, 2013, more than 1.2 million people visited the site, making it the single largest online shopping event in German-speaking countries.

====Netherlands====

In the Netherlands, Black Friday was introduced in 2015. Some years before, there were already a number of large and small retailers that used Black Friday in their marketing. However, with a total of 35 participating stores, 2015 can be considered the year in which Black Friday started in the Netherlands due to a more widespread support of large retailers. The popularity of Black Friday has grown rapidly in the Netherlands. The number of participating stores has increased to over 125 during the Black Friday period of 2017. For the 2018 edition, 166 shops joined the largest black Friday platform in the Netherlands.

====Norway====

In Norway, Black Friday started as a publicity stunt campaign in 2010 to increase the sales to the shopping mall Norwegian Outlet. Since the introduction, it has been promoted every year in a larger and growing market all over the country.

====Poland====

There has been growing interest for Black Friday in Poland as well.

==== Romania ====

The concept was imported in Romania by and Flanco in 2011 and became bigger each year. The two reported the biggest Black Friday sales in 2014. eMAG sold products worth some 37 million euros while Flanco&#x27;s sales totaled 22 million euros. Hundreds of retailers announced their participation in the 2015 campaign.

In 2015, 11 million Romanians say they have heard about Black Friday which is 73% of the 15 million people target segment; 6.7 million plan on buying something on biggest shopping event of the year in Romania.

In Romania, Black Friday is two weeks before the US Black Friday.

====Spain====

In 2015, Spain joined with some small retailers. The celebration became more famous year by year, until the big retailers grew.

====Sweden====

In Sweden, Black Friday is widely practiced.

==== Switzerland ====

In 2015, Swiss retailer Manor was the first to launch a special Black Friday promotion. The year after, most Swiss retailers launched special offers during the Black Friday Week. In 2024, sales of 470 million Swiss francs are expected. Although Singles&#x27; Day (November 11) had initially grown in importance, it has now become significantly less relevant than Black Friday in Switzerland.

==== Turkey ====
Efsane Cuma, or &quot;Legendary Friday,&quot; is the Turkish version of Black Friday – a major shopping event that falls on the last Friday of November. Efsane Cuma offers customers substantial discounts, promotions, and special deals across a variety of products, from electronics to clothing. This sales period has gained popularity in Turkey as both online and brick-and-mortar stores attract large crowds seeking bargains, often extending the deals for a few days or even over a week.

====Ukraine====

In 2016, Black Friday was introduced in Ukraine.

==== United Kingdom ====

In the United Kingdom, the term &quot;Black Friday&quot; originated within the police and NHS to refer to the Friday before Christmas. It is the day when emergency services activate contingency plans to cope with the increase in workload due to many people going out drinking on the last Friday before Christmas. These plans can include setting up mobile field hospitals near city centre nightspots. The term has then been adopted outside those services to refer to the evening and night of the Friday immediately before Christmas, and would now be considered a mainstream term and not simply as jargon of the emergency services.

Traditionally, Boxing Day had been considered the biggest shopping day of the year in the UK. However in the 2010s, several American-owned retailers, such as Amazon UK and the Walmart-owned chain Asda, began to hold US-style Black Friday promotions; in 2014, more British retailers began to adopt the concept, including Argos, John Lewis, and Very. That year, police forces were called to shops across Britain to deal with crowd control issues, assaults, threatening customers, and traffic issues. In response to incidents at branches of Tesco, Greater Manchester Police&#x27;s deputy chief constable Ian Hopkins said shoppers had behaved in an &quot;appalling&quot; fashion, and criticized shops for not making adequate security arrangements to ensure the safety of customers.&quot; Following these incidents, some retailers began to discontinue or heavily modify their promotions, with Asda stating that it would not hold all of its sales across a single day.

In 2016, total spending on online retail sites on Black Friday was £1.23 billion, a 2.2% increase over 2015. In 2017, UK retail sales in November grew faster than in December for the first time.

In Welsh, Black Friday is known by some as &quot;Dydd Gwener y Gwario Gwirion&quot; (Silly Spending Friday).

===North America===

==== Canada ====

The large population centers on Lake Ontario and the Lower Mainland in Canada have always attracted cross-border shopping into the United States, and as Black Friday became more popular in the US, Canadians often flocked over the border because of their lower prices and a stronger Canadian dollar. After 2001, many were traveling for the deals across the border. Starting in 2008 and 2009, due to the parity of the Canadian dollar compared with the American dollar, several major Canadian retailers ran Black Friday deals of their own to discourage shoppers from leaving Canada.

The year 2012 saw the biggest Black Friday to date in Canada, as Canadian retailers embraced it in an attempt to keep shoppers from travelling across the border.

Before the advent of Black Friday in Canada, the most comparable holiday was Boxing Day in terms of retailer impact and consumerism.

==== Mexico ====

In Mexico, Black Friday was the inspiration for the government and retailing industry to create an annual week-end of discounts and extended credit terms, , meaning &quot;the good weekend&quot; in Spanish. has been in existence since 2011 and takes place on November in the week-end prior to the Monday in which the Mexican Revolution holiday is pushed from its original date of November 20, as a result of the measure taken by the government of pushing certain holidays to the Monday of their week in order to avoid the workers and students to make a &quot;larger&quot; week-end (for example, not attending in a Friday after a Thursday holiday, thus making a four-day week-end). On this week-end, major retailers extend their store hours and offer special promotions, including extended credit terms and price promotions.

==== United States ====
Black Friday is not an official holiday in the United States, but California and some other states observe &quot;The Day After Thanksgiving&quot; as a holiday for state government employees. It is sometimes observed in lieu of another federal holiday, such as Columbus Day. Many non-retail employees and schools have both Thanksgiving and the following Friday off. Along with the following regular week-end, this makes Black Friday weekend a four-day weekend, which is said to increase the number of potential shoppers.

The SouthPark neighborhood of Charlotte, North Carolina, is the most trafficked area of the United States on Black Friday.

Black Friday is a shopping day for a combination of reasons. As the first day after the last major holiday before Christmas, it marks the unofficial beginning of the Christmas shopping season. Additionally, many employers give their employees the day off as part of the Thanksgiving holiday week-end. In order to take advantage of this, virtually all retailers in the country, big and small, offer various sales including limited amounts of &quot;doorbuster&quot; items to entice traffic.

For many years, it was common for retailers to open at 6a.m., but in the late 2000s many opened at 4a.m.–5a.m. The early 2010s have seen retailers extend beyond normal hours in order to maintain an edge or to simply keep up with the competition. In 2010, Toys &quot;R&quot; Us began their Black Friday sales at 10p.m. on Thanksgiving and further upped the ante by offering free boxes of Crayola crayons and coloring books for as long as supplies lasted. Other retailers, like Sears, Express, MK, Victoria&#x27;s Secret, Zumiez, Tillys, American Eagle Outfitters, Nike, Jordan, Puma, Aéropostale, and Kmart, began Black Friday sales early Thanksgiving morning and ran them through as late as 11p.m. Friday evening. Forever 21 went in the opposite direction, opening at normal hours on Friday, and running late sales until 2a.m. Saturday morning. In 2011, several retailers (including Target, Kohl&#x27;s, Macy&#x27;s, Best Buy, and Bealls) opened at midnight for the first time. In 2012, Walmart and several other retailers announced that they would open most of their stores at 8p.m. on Thanksgiving, prompting calls for a walkout among some workers. In 2014, stores such as JCPenney, Best Buy, and Radio Shack opened at 6a.m. on Thanksgiving while stores such as Target, Walmart, Belk, and Sears opened at 7p.m. on Thanksgiving. Three statesRhode Island, Maine, and Massachusettsprohibit large supermarkets, big box stores, and department stores from opening on Thanksgiving, in what has been referred to as a legacy of blue laws. A bill to allow stores to open on Thanksgiving was the subject of a public hearing on July 8, 2017.

Historically, it was common for Black Friday sales to extend throughout the following week-end. However, this practice has largely disappeared in recent years, perhaps because of an effort by retailers to create a greater sense of urgency.

The news media usually give heavy play to reports of Black Friday shopping and their implications for the commercial success of the Christmas shopping season, but the relationship between Black Friday sales and retail sales for the full holiday season is quite weak and may even be negative.

In 2014, spending volume on Black Friday fell for the first time since the 2008 recession. 50.9 billion dollars were spent during the four-day Black Friday week-end, down 11% from the previous year. However, the US economy was not in a recession. Christmas creep has been cited as a factor in the diminishing importance of Black Friday, as many retailers now spread out their promotions over the entire months of November and December rather than concentrate them on a single shopping day or week-end.

On April 23, 2014, &quot;.blackfriday&quot; joined a growing list of ICANN top-level domains (such astraditionally.com, .net, and .org).

In 2015, Neil Stern of McMillan Doolittle said, &quot;Black Friday is quickly losing its meaning on many fronts,&quot; because many stores opened on Thanksgiving, and a lot of sales started even earlier than that. Online shopping also made the day less important. A Gallup poll in 2012 has shown that only 18% of American adults planned to shop during Black Friday.

In 2020, an article in &quot;Ad Age&quot; magazine stated that &quot;an American capitalist tradition ... has been on the wane for years as online shopping rises in popularity&quot; but the COVID-19 pandemic, &quot;which has dramatically altered shopping patterns, has seemingly dealt a fatal blow.&quot;

By 2021, spending during the holiday season was expected to continue to increase, but Black Friday was no longer a single day. It was instead an opportunity for retailers to offer deals during the season as online shopping continued to change consumer behavior. COVID-19 had increased the changes in buyer and retailer moves toward online transactions. Supply chain disruptions caused consumers to buy earlier when they could find items.

===Oceania===

==== Australia ====

In Australia, the term is controversial, as prior to its popularisation as a shopping day, it referred not to shopping at all, but to the devastating Black Friday bushfires that occurred in Victoria 1938–39. It was not until the 2010s that it was heavily promoted as a shopping day in Australia by in-store and online retailers, despite backlash and confusion by consumers. In 2011, Online Shopping USA hosted an event on Twitter. Twitter users had to use the hashtag #osublackfriday, which allowed them to follow along and tweet their favourite deals and discounts from stores. In 2013, Apple extended its Black Friday deals to Australia. Purchasing online gave customers free shipping and free iTunes gift cards with every purchase. The deals were promoted on its website, reading &quot;Official Apple StoreOne day Apple shopping event Friday, November 29&quot;. Australia Post&#x27;s ShopMate parcel-forwarding service allows Australian customers to purchase products with &quot;Black Friday&quot; deals from the US and get them shipped to Australia. ShopMate ran from 2014 to 2022. It closed in February 2022 amid controversy about shipping costs.
In addition to this service, numerous stores in the country run Black Friday promotions in-store and online throughout the country.

====New Zealand====
Black Friday started picking up in New Zealand around 2013. In 2015, major retailers such as The Warehouse, Noel Leeming and Harvey Norman offered Black Friday sales, and by 2018 were joined by Farmers, JB Hi-Fi, Briscoes and Rebel Sport. Paymark, which processes around 75% of New Zealand&#x27;s electronic transactions, recorded $219 million NZD (US$151 million) of transactions on Black Friday 2017, up over 10% from the previous year.

===South America===

====Bolivia====

2014 marked the introduction in Bolivia.

====Brazil====

Black Friday has been increasingly adopted by stores in Brazil since 2010, although not without its share of inflated prices and other scams, especially in its earlier years, earning the nickname &quot;&quot;Black Fraude&quot; (Black Fraud) or also &quot;Black Furadei&quot;, which comes from the slang word &quot;furada&quot;&quot;, meaning a &quot;jam&quot; or tough situation, usually involving money. It is also common to hear Brazilian people say that prices on Brazilian Black Friday are &quot;half of the double&quot;.

====Colombia====

Black Friday was introduced in 2014.

====Costa Rica====

Black Friday is known as &quot;Viernes Negro&quot; in Costa Rica.

====Panama====

In Panama, Black Friday was first celebrated in 2012, as a move by the government to attract local tourism to the country&#x27;s capital city. During its first year, it was believed to have attracted an inflow of about 35,000 regional tourists according to the government&#x27;s immigration census.

== Violence ==

Despite frequent attempts to control the crowds of shoppers, minor injuries are common among the crowds, usually as a result of being pushed or thrown to the ground in small crowd crushes. While most injuries remain minor, serious injuries and even deliberate violence have taken place on some Black Fridays.

===2008===

In 2008, a crowd of approximately 2,000 shoppers in Valley Stream, New York, waited outside for the 05:00 opening of the local Walmart. When the doors were opened, the crowd pushed forward, breaking the door down, and 34-year-old employee Jdimytai Damour was trampled to death. The shoppers did not appear concerned with the victim&#x27;s fate, expressing refusal to halt their charge when other employees attempted to intervene and help the injured employee, complaining that they had been waiting in the cold and were not willing to wait any longer. Shoppers had begun assembling as early as 21:00 the evening before. Even when police arrived and attempted to render aid to the injured man, shoppers continued to pour in, shoving and pushing the officers as they made their way into the store. Several other people incurred minor injuries, including a pregnant woman who had to be taken to the hospital. The incident may be the first case of a death occurring during Black Friday sales; according to the National Retail Federation, &quot;We are not aware of any other circumstances where a retail employee has died working on the day after Thanksgiving.&quot;

On the same day, two people were fatally shot during an altercation at a Toys &quot;R&quot; Us in Palm Desert, California.

===2010===

During Black Friday 2010, a Madison, Wisconsin, woman was arrested outside of a Toys &quot;R&quot; Us store after cutting in line, and threatening to shoot other shoppers who tried to object.

She had been asked to leave the store, but refused.

A man was arrested at a Florida Walmart on drug and weapons charges after other shoppers waiting in line for the store to open noticed he was carrying a handgun and reported it to the police. He was discovered to also be carrying two knives and a pepper spray grenade. A man in Buffalo, New York, was trampled when doors opened at a Target store and unruly shoppers rushed in, in an episode reminiscent of the deadly 2008 Wal-Mart crowd crush.

===2011===

On Black Friday 2011, a woman at a Porter Ranch, California Walmart used pepper spray on fellow shoppers, causing minor injuries to a reported 20 people who had been waiting hours for the store to open. The incident started as people waited in line for the newly discounted Xbox 360. A witness said a woman with two children in tow became upset with the way people were pushing in line. The witness said she pulled out pepper spray and sprayed the other people in line. Another account stated: &quot;The store had brought out a crate of discounted Xbox 360s, and a crowd had formed to wait for the unwrapping, when the woman began spraying people &#x27;in order to get an advantage,&#x27; according to the police. In an incident outside a Walmart store in San Leandro, California, one man was wounded after being shot following Black Friday shopping at about 1:45 a.m. In South Charleston, West Virginia, a 61-year-old pharmacist collapsed and died after suffering a heart attack at a store. The &quot;New York Daily News&quot; reported other shoppers did not stop to help the man, with some stepping over his collapsed body.

He was charged with disorderly conduct, aggravated assault, and resisting arrest.

===2014===

In 2014, three buyers were arrested after a group of five people started fighting at a Kohl&#x27;s store in Tustin, California.

== Black Friday online ==

=== High traffic challenges for retailers ===

Some online stores invest a lot of money in promotional campaigns to generate more sales and drive traffic to their stores. However, they often forget about the high loads their sites are going to experience. According to &quot;Retail Gazette&quot;, &quot;A number of major retailers&#x27; websites went down as they failed to cope with the surge in Black Friday traffic in 2017... This just highlights that some retailers have not taken the necessary steps to prepare for Black Friday. Failing to prepare for peak can cause poor performance, site downtime, and ultimately lost revenue for retailers&quot;. Such carelessness results in huge reputational damage. Moreover, the 2017 Veeam Availability Report in South Africa found that &quot;Unplanned downtime costs organisations around the world an average of R270m annually, up from the R210m of the previous year&quot;.

=== Advertising tip sites ===

Some websites offer information about day-after-Thanksgiving specials up to a month in advance. The text listings of items and prices are usually accompanied by pictures of the actual ad circulars. These are either leaked by insiders or intentionally released by large retailers to give consumers insight and allow them time to plan.

In recent years, some retailers (including Walmart, Target, OfficeMax, Big Lots, and Staples) have claimed that the advertisements they send in advance of Black Friday and the prices included in those advertisements are copyrighted and are trade secrets. Some of these retailers have used the take-down system of the Digital Millennium Copyright Act (DMCA) as a means to remove the offending price listings.

The benefit of threatening Internet sites with a DMCA-based lawsuit has proved tenuous at best. While some sites have complied with the requests, others have either ignored the threats or simply continued to post the information under the name of a similar-sounding fictional retailer. However, careful timing may mitigate the take-down notice. An Internet service provider in 2003 brought suit against Best Buy, Kohl&#x27;s, and Target Corporation, arguing that the take-down notice provisions of the DMCA are unconstitutional. The court dismissed the case, ruling that only the third-party posters of the advertisements, and not the ISP itself, would have standing to sue the retailers.

Usage of Black Friday advertising tip sites and buying direct varies by state in the US, influenced in large part by differences in shipping costs and whether a state has a sales tax. However, in recent years, the convenience of online shopping has increased the number of cross-border shoppers seeking bargains from outside of the US, especially from Canada. Statistics Canada indicates that online cross-border shopping by Canadians has increased by about 300M a year since 2002. The complex nature of additional fees such as taxes, duties, and brokerage can make calculating the final cost of cross-border Black Friday deals difficult. Cross-border shopping solutions exist to mitigate the problem through estimation of the various cost involved.

In 2019, Adobe shopping data showed that around 39% of the shopping was done through smartphones. In 2022, 48% of online sales are made through smartphones, up from 44% in 2021. Meanwhile, consumers spent a record $9.12 billion shopping online during Black Friday this year.

=== Cyber Monday ===
The term &quot;Cyber Monday&quot;, a neologism invented in 2005 by the National Retail Federation&#x27;s division Shop.org, refers to the Monday immediately following Black Friday based on a trend that retailers began to recognize in 2003 and 2004. Retailers noticed that many consumers who were too busy to shop over the Thanksgiving week-end or did not find what they were looking for shopped for bargains online that Monday from home or work. In 2010, Hitwise reported:

In 2013, Cyber Monday online sales grew by 18% over the previous year, hitting a record $1.73 billion, with an average order value of $128.
In 2014, Cyber Monday was the busiest day of the year with sales exceeding $2 billion in desktop online spending, up 17% from the previous year.

=== Cyber Week ===
As reported in the &quot;Forbes&quot; &quot;Entrepreneurs&quot; column on December 3, 2013: &quot;Cyber Monday, the online counterpart to Black Friday, has been gaining unprecedented popularityto the point where Cyber Sales are continuing on throughout the week.&quot; Peter Greenberg, travel editor for CBS News, further advises: &quot;If you want a real deal on Black Friday, stay away from the mall. Black Friday and Cyber Monday are all part of Cyber Week...&quot;

== Retail sales impact ==
The National Retail Federation releases figures on the sales for each Thanksgiving week-end. The Federation&#x27;s definition of &quot;Black Friday week-end&quot; includes Thursday, Friday, Saturday and projected spending for Sunday. The survey estimates number of shoppers, not number of people.

The length of the shopping season is not the same across all years: the date for Black Friday varies between November 23 and 29, while Christmas Eve is fixed at December 24.

<text>Alcester ( ) is a market town and civil parish in the Stratford-on-Avon District in Warwickshire, England. It is west of Stratford-upon-Avon, and 7 miles south of Redditch. The town dates back to the times of Roman Britain and is located at the junction of the River Alne and River Arrow.

In the 2021 census, the population of the parish was 6,035, with 6,421 in the built-up area.

==Etymology==
The poet and antiquary John Leland wrote in his &quot;Itinerary&quot; (ca. 1538–43) that the name Alcester was derived from that of the River Alne. The suffix &#x27;cester&#x27; is derived from the Old English word &#x27;ceaster&#x27;, which meant a Roman fort or town, and derived from the Latin &#x27;castrum&#x27;, from which the modern word &#x27;castle&#x27; also derives.

==History==
Alcester was founded by the Romans in around AD 47 as a walled fort. The walled town, possibly named &quot;Alauna&quot; developed from the military camp. It was sited on Icknield Street, a Roman road that ran the length of Roman Britain from south-west England to south Yorkshire. The town was also just north of the Fosse Way, another important thoroughfare in Roman Britain. By the end of the 2nd century, Roman Alcester had developed into a bustling trading and market town: A small walled area in the centre of the town was surrounded by an extensive grid of roads serving a complex of workshops and their associated housing, which specialised in trades such as tanning, metal working and pottery manufacture. Some of the houses of Roman Alcester appear to have been well endowed, with features such as heating, painted plaster and mosaic floors. Along with most Romano-British towns, it appears to have gone into decline in the 4th century when the Romans began to leave Britain. Detailed archaeological work began in the 1920s.

In the Early Middle Ages, &quot;Alencestre&quot; had become an Anglo-Saxon market town in the Kingdom of Mercia. Alcester was also the site of Alcester Abbey, a Benedictine monastery founded in 1138 by Ralph le Boteler. Richard de Tutbury, the last abbot, resigned his office in 1467 and Alcester Abbey was absorbed into the neighbouring Evesham Abbey. By 1515 Alcester Abbey was in ruins as a result of the neglect of various abbots, and later during the dissolution of the monasteries under Henry VIII it was largely demolished. The ruins were granted to the local Greville family, who used much of the stone to rebuild their family seat of Beauchamp Court.

Alcester competed in the competition for city status as part of the Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours.

==Notable buildings==
Today the town features architecture from the Medieval, Tudor, Georgian, Victorian eras and the 20th century. The oldest house appears to be The Old Malthouse at the corner of Church Street and Malt Mill Lane, which probably dates from about 1500.

St Nicholas&#x27;s Church is a Grade II* listed building. Its clock is in an unusual position on the south-west corner of the 14th-century tower, to make it visible from the High Street. The church also houses the tomb of Fulke Greville, grandfather of poet and statesman Fulke Greville, 1st Baron Brooke. The church&#x27;s Georgian nave with Doric columns and plastered ceiling is believed to have been designed by Francis Smith of Warwick, supervisor of its rebuild by the Woodward brothers of Chipping Campden in 1729.

Alcester Town Hall was built between 1618 and 1641, and is a grade I listed building.

==Transport==
Alcester was previously served by Alcester railway station belonging to the Midland Railway (later part of the LMS Railway), on the Gloucester Loop Line, branching off the Birmingham and Gloucester Railway main line at , passing through , Alcester and and rejoining the main line at , near . The loop was built to address the fact that the main line bypassed most of the towns it might otherwise have served, but it took three separate companies to complete, Alcester being on the Evesham and Redditch railway prior to absorption by the Midland.

In addition a branch line provided by the Alcester Railway Company (later part of the Great Western Railway) ran from to , thus giving access to . This line, however, was an early casualty, closing in September 1939. The Midland loop was due to close between and in June 1963 but the poor condition of the track led to all trains between and Redditch being withdrawn in October 1962 and replaced by a bus service for the final eight months. Redditch to remains open on the electrified Birmingham suburban network.

Currently, Alcester is served by one regular bus route, the hourly Stagecoach Midlands-operated X19 between Redditch and Stratford-upon-Avon. The Diamond West Midlands-operated route 247 operates irregularly through Alcester between Redditch and Evesham.

==Current attractions==
Alcester is also known for two nearby stately homes. To the north is Coughton Court, the family seat of the Throckmorton baronets as well as a National Trust property. To the south-west is Ragley Hall, the home of the Marquis of Hertford, whose gardens contain a children&#x27;s adventure playground.

Kinwarton, which is just north of Alcester, contains a church of Anglo Saxon origin and a historic dovecote, Kinwarton Dovecote, which is also a National Trust property. Alcester is also a significant town on the 100-mile-long Heart of England Way long-distance trail. Recent developments, carried out by a multi-agency partnership, include &#x27;Roman Alcester&#x27;, a museum exhibiting locally found archaeological artifacts from the 1st to 4th century. 2024 marked the 20th anniversary of its opening.

==Annual events==
In early June, Alcester holds the Court Leet charity street market with a procession and competitions for best stall and best fancy dress. On the first Monday and Tuesday in October, Alcester holds an annual mop fair where amusement rides, side stalls and food booths line the High Street, Church Street and Henley Street. The mop fair has gradually decreased in size over a period of years, likely an external influence since the people of Alcester still flock to the streets during the two nights.

The Alcester and Forest of Arden Food Festival is held every May and October. The St Nicholas Night Fair is held on 6 December each year. The annual duck race takes place on the 2nd Saturday in July to raise funds for the summer bunting and Christmas lights.

==Flooding==

The River Alne and Arrow, which join on the outskirts of Alcester, have occasionally flooded and on a few occasions engulfed part of the town. The last occurrences were in 1956, 10 April 1998 (Maunday Thursday) and on 21 July 2007 when 200 homes were left uninhabitable. In response to the severe flooding of 2007 Alcester flood scheme completed an underground storage tank with a 3.25 million litre capacity in June 2011, costing just over £1 million. The scheme attracted funding from the Regional Flood and Coastal Committee&#x27;s Local Levy with contributions from Warwickshire County Council, Stratford-on-Avon District Council and Alcester Town Council. The scheme included work on the two pumping stations located at Bleachfield Street and Gas House Lane.

==Sports==

Alne Cricket Club (Great Alne) is a cricke club about 2 miles from Alcester centre that play in local competitions and have a summer fun week for children. Adults can also play in their &quot;Adult Team&quot;.

<text>Bishop&#x27;s Castle () is a market town in the south west of Shropshire, England. According to the 2011 Census it had a population of 1,893.

Bishop&#x27;s Castle is east of the Wales–England border, about north-west of Ludlow and about south-west of Shrewsbury. To the south is Clun and to the east is Church Stretton. The town is within an agricultural area and has also become known for its alternative community including artists, musicians, writers and craftspeople. The surrounding area is hillwalking country and Bishop&#x27;s Castle is a &quot;Walkers are Welcome Town&quot;, gaining the award in 2008. The long distance footpath the Shropshire Way runs through the town and Offa&#x27;s Dyke is only a few miles to the west.

The ancient trackway of the Kerry Ridgeway, a prehistoric Bronze Age route, runs from the town. The BC Ring, a challenging route around the town, was published in 2008. The town has two micro-breweries, including the Three Tuns, the UK&#x27;s oldest brewery.

==History==

===The castle===
Documented history begins in Saxon times for Bishop&#x27;s Castle when Edwin Shakehead, grateful for being miraculously cured of the palsy at Saint Ethelbert&#x27;s tomb in Hereford Cathedral gave part of his lands to the incumbent Bishop of Hereford. A later Bishop of Hereford built a castle, originally a motte and bailey design, in 1087 to defend the church and village from the threat of the Welsh (its site ). The castle has been under attack several times, not always by Welsh raiders, most notably in 1263 when John Fitzalan, Lord of Arundel and feudal Lord of Oswestry and Clun, held it under siege in the course of a feud with the Bishop of Hereford and caused significant damage, estimated at 1,060 marks.

In the Early Middle Ages the castle and parish were situated partly in Wales and partly in England so territorial disputes literally &#x27;came with the territory&#x27;.

In 1557 the castle was described as follows: &quot;thirteen rooms covered with lead, a tower on the outer wall on the eastern side containing a stable, and two rooms covered with tiles. There were two other rooms called &#x27;le new buyldinge&#x27; situated on the outer wall between the building over the gate and the tower called &#x27;le prison tower&#x27;. There was also a dovecote, a garden, a forest and a park.&quot;

As peace came to the Welsh Marches Bishop&#x27;s Castle became one of the notorious rotten boroughs, an electorally corrupt situation wherein the tiny borough elected two members of parliament from 1585.

In 1618 the castle started to deteriorate and in the 1700s the stone keep and surroundings were flattened to make a bowling green. (Some historians believe that the houses along Market Square and Castle Street were built upon the foundations of an outer wall due to the curvature of the houses).

In 1642, the Three Tuns Brewery was established on its current site, making it the oldest licensed brewery site in Britain. While some of the current building dates to the seventeenth century, the main building is a Victorian tower brewery erected about 1888.

In 1719 – the fifth year of the reign of George I and the year Daniel Defoe published Robinson Crusoe – the Castle Hotel was constructed over the site of the old &quot;baille&quot; [the French word for an enclosed court] of the ancient castle. It was built on the orders of a local landowner, James Brydges (1673–1744), who in the year the hotel was completed was created Duke of Chandos. In an age of unabashed corruption, he acquired a number of lucrative sinecure offices and amassed such wealth that he was known as &#x27;Princely Chandos&#x27;.

The 1st Duke of Chandos sold the Castle Hotel to John Walcot who in turn sold it to Robert Clive, 1st Baron Clive of Plassey (1725–1774), known as &#x27;Clive of India&#x27;, who amassed such wealth during his time in that country that Horace Walpole writing from London to a country friend said: &#x27;you will be frightened by the dearness of everything ... I expect that a pint of milk will soon not be sold under a diamond, and then nobody can keep a cow but my Lord Clive&#x27;. From Lord Clive the hotel descended to his son, Edward, and then to his grandson, who changed the family name to Herbert, his mother&#x27;s maiden name. The older Edward became Earl of Powis on the death of his brother-in-law, George Herbert, 2nd Earl of Powis (of the previous creation of that title).

Local landowners, including Lord Clive, expended large sums of cash buying votes, a common practice at the time in some areas to ensure a seat in Parliament. In 1726 one unsuccessful parliamentary candidate was subsequently able to prove that of the 52 people voting for his rival, the incumbent MP, 51 had received bribes and inducements. The Reform Act 1832 eradicated this practice and Bishop&#x27;s Castle was disenfranchised.

All that is physically left of the castle today is a 10 m long, coursed stone wall on the west side of the castle site which is 2 m thick and 3 m high. It was overgrown with ivy and was recently renovated to keep it safe and stable. The Castle Hotel stands on the site of the castle itself and is largely built of stone salvaged from the original castle.

===The town===
The layout of the town in the present day shows that originally the town was made up of 46 burgage plots which were separated by a few small lanes which have developed to be Church Street, Union Street and Station Street.

In 1249 a royal charter for a weekly market and an annual fair was granted. They are both still very popular.

In the 17th century, Bishop&#x27;s Castle Town Hall was constructed as a new administrative centre, a court and a prison. It was refurbished with support from the Heritage Lottery Fund and was re-opened in June 2014.

The town was classified as a municipal borough in 1885. It lost this status in the 1960s, but still has a mayor and its regalia. It is now a &quot;Quality Town Council&quot;.

Bishop&#x27;s Castle was close to the epicentre of a magnitude 5.1 earthquake on 2 April 1990, which was felt throughout much of England and Wales.

The town is located close to the Shropshire Hills Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty.

==Governance==
From 1584 to 1832 it was its own parliamentary borough with two MPs. It was part of the Ludlow constituency from 1885 until its redesignation as South Shropshire in 2024 following constituency boundary changes.

Today the town forms a civil parish, with its own town council and mayor. The original Town Council website was one of the first in the UK to publish agendas and minutes (from late 2000).

An electoral ward of the same name exists in the Shropshire Council. This ward stretches north east to Ratlinghope and at the 2011 Census had a total population of 3,728.

==Amenities==

There are a variety of shops, local businesses and services ranging from clothes shops to the usual high street banks. The town is notable for a thriving selection of specialist retailers.

There are several public houses in the town, and two micro-breweries: the Six Bells Brewery painted yellow, and the Three Tuns Brewery. Additionally, the town sports a number of restaurants and bed and breakfasts, and a hotel, The Castle Hotel, built on the site of the outer bailey of the old bishop&#x27;s castle. Other sights in the town include the House on Crutches Museum of country life, the Rail &amp; Transport Museum, and the old cattle market in the centre of town.

Many properties are painted in various colourful hues of blue, pink, yellow and green which are reflected on the Wintles, a new neighbourhood of energy efficient eco-houses built by Living Villages.

==Education==
The town possesses a high school (Bishop&#x27;s Castle Community College) which teaches 11- to 16-year-olds, around 450 students from the town and surrounding villages and towns. It also has a primary school and a Nursery.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the local relay transmitter.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Shropshire, Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire, Greatest Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire and Capital North West and Wales.

The town is served by the local newspapers, &quot;Ludlow Advertiser&quot;, &quot;County Times&quot;, and &quot;Shropshire Star&quot;.

==Sport==
Sports played by local clubs include:

===Cricket===
1st XI play in Division 2 of the Shropshire Cricket League, and the club play friendlies on Sundays, with regular youth coaching sessions (usually Monday evenings) and matches for school age children. Cricket was first recorded being played in 1841 on Love Lane, and the club was officially formed in 1896 at a meeting held in the Six Bells public house, and have played at the Manor Ground since 1946.
The 1st XI equalled their highest ever finish of 4th in 2011 (previously achieved in 2009) with a record points total of 332. The club&#x27;s social base is the Castle Hotel off Market Square.

===Football===
Bishops Castle Town play in the Montgomeryshire Amateur League and were Division 1 Champions in 2017–18, having previously played for 6 years in the Mercian Regional Football League Division One. Previously they played in Division 1 of the Montgomeryshire Amateur League, having gained promotion from Division 2 in the early 1990s, and having joined Division 2 in 1984–85. Before that they played in various leagues including the South Shropshire League and the West Shropshire Alliance. The club was formed in the 1880s.
The club&#x27;s social base after matches and for meetings is The Kings Head Public House in Church Street. The club play their Home matches at the Community College ground on Colebatch Road.

===Rugby===
Bishop&#x27;s Castle and Onny Valley Rugby Club was formed in the late 1970s and spent the early years playing friendly games against teams from Mid-Wales and Shropshire, before joining the league structure in the early 1990s. Now they play in Midlands Division Fourth North.

===Other sports===
*Women&#x27;s Hockey
*Squash
*Tennis

==Transport==
Bishop&#x27;s Castle has been on a main route for travellers since prehistoric times, although the town was bypassed in the 19th century by Thomas Telford&#x27;s great road. The inns would have provided accommodation for travellers and have stabled their horses.

There is no main road running through the town, though the A488 runs north–south just to the east of the town, on its way from Shrewsbury, Pontesbury and Minsterley to Clun and Knighton. The B4385 runs around the town and connects with the A488.

Bishop&#x27;s Castle had a railway, the Bishops Castle Railway, between 1865 and 1935. Originally it was meant to go from Craven Arms to Montgomery, but that speculation failed due to lack of finance. Sections of the old railway can still be seen today, including some of the embankments, bridges and stations. Today the nearest station is Broome on the Heart of Wales Line.

There is a limited daytime bus service 553 on Mondays to Saturdays between Bishop&#x27;s Castle and Shrewsbury, operated by local independent operator Minsterley Motors.

<doc id="366485" wikidata="Q7155057" url="?curid=366485" title="Pauline Mills McGibbon">
<text>Pauline Mills McGibbon (21 October 1910 – 14 December 2001) served as the 22nd Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 1974 to 1980. In addition to being the first woman to occupy that position, she was also the first woman to serve as a viceregal representative in Canadian history.

Once described as &#x27;Ontario’s Eve&#x27; for all her &#x27;first woman&#x27; achievements, the Honourable Pauline McGibbon dedicated her life to the betterment of her community, province and nation. A 1976 article indicated &#x27;She has a warm, smiling face wreathed by a grey braid, her trademark… She is almost apologetic for being ‘old-fashioned,&#x27; but, because of her upbringing, she says she rarely feels really dressed, without gloves&#x27;. Former Governor-General Adrienne Clarkson once commented that McGibbon &#x27;was perceptive, incisive, amusing and self-deprecating&#x27;.

== Early life ==

Pauline Emily Mills was born 20 October 1910 in Sarnia, Ontario. She was the only child of Alfred William and Ethel Selina Mills, her father being a textiles and goods merchant. After George Street, and Lochiel Street Schools, and Sarnia Collegiate, she studied at Victoria College at the University of Toronto, graduating in 1933 with a Bachelor of Arts in Modern History. 

In January 1935 Pauline married football star and her childhood sweetheart Donald Walker McGibbon, both attending the university together. Don later became vice-president and treasurer of Imperial Oil Limited.

== Career == 

A lifelong volunteer and supporter of the arts, McGibbon became president of the Dominion Drama Festival from 1957 to 1959. She volunteered for years including national president of the Imperial Order of the Daughters of the Empire from 1963 to 1965. She was the first woman to lead such organizations as the Canadian Conference of the Arts (1972).

McGibbon served as chancellor, and first female in those roles, of the universities of Toronto (1971–1974) and Guelph (1977–1983). 

Appointed by prime minister Pierre Trudeau, McGibbon was installed as the first female Lieutenant Governor of Ontario on 17 January 1974, and thus became the first female governor in the country. (The first female Governor in the Commonwealth was Dame Hilda Bynoe, Governor of Grenada 1968–1974.) She held the office until 1980. A particular focus of her mandate was the arts in Ontario. This was her first salaried employment, due to the support of her husband which had enabled her to devote much time to voluntary work. Of her annual $35 000 salary, she gave back the money other than for $200 a month which at her husband&#x27;s request went into a retirement savings plan.

Additional to her benevolent work, McGibbon was an active member of the business community, and served as director on companies in Canada such as IBM Canada Limited, Imasco, Mercedes-Benz, and George Weston Limited.

From 1980 McGibbon was a director of Massey Hall and Roy Thomson Hall. She also served as chairman, and their first female chair of the National Arts Centre in Ottawa (1980), and honorary colonel of 25 (Toronto) Service Battalion and No. 7 Cadet Corps of Saint Thomas. 

During her life, McGibbon was also the governor of the Upper Canada College. 

== Later life ==

She and Don had no children.

By the end of her life, McGibbon had been the chairman, a board member, director, and/or president of at least fifteen arts associations, including the National Arts Centre (Ottawa), the Toronto International Festival of Dance and Music, and the du Maurier Council for the Performing Arts.

After a lengthy illness, McGibbon died in Toronto on Friday, 14 December 2001, aged 91. She was buried in the family plot in the Lakeview Cemetery in Sarnia, Ontario. 

== Legacy ==

Established in 1981, the Pauline McGibbon Award, a monetary $7000 (2021) award, is given each year to a member of Ontario’s professional theatre community in the early stages of the member&#x27;s career who has displayed a unique talent and a potential for excellence. The Ontario Arts Council manages the award. 

Her name is also given to Pauline McGibbon Park, 180 North College Avenue, Sarnia.

== Awards ==

McGibbon is the first woman to hold the presidency of the University of Toronto Alumni Association (1952–53). In November 1956, she received a life membership in Ontario provincial chapter, to which she had given continuous service since 1940. McGibbon was one of many people recognised by the Alumni as 1990 Arbor Award recipients for generosity and contribution to the experience of university members.

She received the medal of service of the Order of Canada in recognition of her contributions to worthy causes. She was made a Dame of the Order of Saint Lazarus. In 1957 McGibbon received the Canadian Drama Award for outstanding service to theatre in Canada. 

She received the Civic Award of Merit from the City of Toronto, and in the same year an honorary doctor of laws degree from University of Alberta.

McGibbon was named as an Officer of the Order of Canada in December 1967, for her contribution to the theatre and education, and several volunteer organizations. After leaving Office, McGibbon was promoted to be a Companion of the Order of Canada in 1980, and was separately appointed to the Order of Ontario in December 1988. 

In October 1975 as a lieutenant-governor, she was awarded an honorary law degree by the University of Toronto.

By March 1977, McGibbon held seven honorary degrees from Canadian universities, an Honorary Fellow of the Royal College of Physicians and Surgeons of Canada, a Dame of Grace of the Order of Saint John of Jerusalem, the Canadian Centennial Medal (1967), and the Award of Merit from the Canadian Public Relations Society. She had also been the first woman member of the Royal Canadian Military Institute.

<doc id="366486" wikidata="Q644530" url="?curid=366486" title="Blandford Forum">
<text>Blandford Forum ( ) is a market town in Dorset, England, on the River Stour, north-west of Poole. It had a population of 10,355 at the 2021 census.

The town is notable for its Georgian architecture, the result of rebuilding after a major fire in 1731; it was assisted by an Act of Parliament and a donation by George II, to designs by local architects John and William Bastard.

The town&#x27;s economy is based on a mix of the service sector and light industry. Blandford Camp, a military base, is on the hills north-east of the town. It is the base of the Royal Corps of Signals, the communications wing of the British Army, and the site of the Royal Signals Museum.

==History==
Blandford has been a fording point on the River Stour since Anglo-Saxon times. The name Blandford derives from the Old English &quot;blǣge&quot;, and probably means ford where gudgeon or blay are found. The name &quot;Blaneford&quot; or &quot;Bleneford&quot; is recorded in the Domesday Book, referring not to Blandford Forum itself but to the adjacent villages of Bryanston and Blandford St Mary on the opposite side of the ford, and Langton Long Blandford further downstream.

By the 13th century, the settlement on the north bank of the river had become a market town with a livestock market serving the nearby Blackmore Vale with its many dairy farms. At the start of the 14th century it returned two members of parliament and was also known as &quot;Cheping Blandford&quot;, where &quot;Cheping&quot; or &quot;Chipping&quot; refers to a market. The Latin translation &quot;Forum&quot; was first recorded in 1540.

In &quot;Survey of Dorsetshire&quot;, written by Thomas Gerard of Trent in the early 1630s, Blandford was described as &quot;a faire Markett Towne, pleasantlie seated upon the River ... well inhabitted and of good Traffique&quot;. In the 17th-century English Civil War Blandford was a Royalist centre; most inhabitants supported the king.

In the 18th century Blandford was one of several lace-making centres in the county; Daniel Defoe stated that lace made in the town was &quot;the finest bonelace in England... I think I never saw better in Flanders, France or Italy&quot;. In the 17th and 18th centuries Blandford was also a malting and brewing centre of some significance.


Almost all of Blandford&#x27;s buildings were destroyed on 4 June 1731 by the &quot;great fire&quot;, which was the last of several serious fires that occurred in the 16th, 17th and 18th centuries. The fire began in a tallow chandler&#x27;s workshop on a site that is now The King&#x27;s Arms public house. Within a few hours, almost 90% of the town&#x27;s fabric had gone; all fire-fighting equipment had been lost to the fire and the church&#x27;s lead roof had melted. Even properties west of the river in Blandford St Mary and Bryanston were burned, though notable buildings that survived in the town include the Ryves Almshouses and Dale House in Salisbury Street, Old House in The Close, and much of East Street, including Stour House. An Act of Parliament was introduced that stated that rebuilding work must be in brick and tile and should begin within four years. With assistance from the rest of the country—including £1,000 given by King George II—the town was rebuilt over the next ten years to the designs of local architects John and William Bastard. Bottlenecks were removed and streets realigned in the new town plan, which also provided a wider market place. As well as residential and commercial property, new buildings included a new town hall, school and church. The redesigned town centre has survived to the present day virtually intact.
After the post-fire reconstruction Blandford remained a thriving market town. Wool spinning and button making were also significant, and the brewing and hostelry trades expanded. The turnpike road between Salisbury and Dorchester was made in 1756 and passed through the town, and the arrival of the coaching era increased the town&#x27;s prosperity, though the built fabric of the town changed little until the first half of the 19th century, when houses for wealthier inhabitants were built to the north alongside the roads to Salisbury and Shaftesbury. Later in the 19th century, perhaps following the installation of piped water, more densely packed buildings were built to the northeast, replacing gardens and barracks for the poor (that had been erected following the fire) between the roads to Salisbury and Wimborne Minster. Rail transport arrived in Blandford in the 1860s, though this did not impact greatly on the town&#x27;s economy.

Blandford&#x27;s weekly animal market disappeared in the 20th century, perhaps a casualty of motorised transport that enabled larger markets to be held in fewer centres (the market at nearby Sturminster Newton increased significantly). By the middle of the 20th century Blandford Fair, a seasonal sheep fair held in summer and autumn, had also disappeared, due to changes in animal husbandry and a reduction in sheep numbers in the county.

==Governance==
In the United Kingdom national parliament, Blandford is in the North Dorset parliamentary constituency whose current Member of Parliament (MP) is Simon Hoare of the Conservative party. At the top tier of local government Blandford ward is governed by Dorset Council, which provides all services apart from those provided by Blandford Forum Town Council, which has responsibilities that include outdoor fitness and play areas, CCTV, the cemetery and allotments, venue hire, the indoor market, grass cutting and grit bins.
For electoral purposes on the town level Blandford is divided into four electoral wards: Blandford Central, Blandford Hilltop, Blandford Langton St.Leonards and Blandford Old Town. A fifth ward, Riversdale and Portman, covers Bryanston and Blandford St Mary west of the river; these are not within the parish of Blandford, but the town&#x27;s built-up area extends into Blandford St Mary parish. In national parliamentary elections these five wards are joined with 22 others that together elect the Member of Parliament for the North Dorset constituency. In town council elections Blandford&#x27;s four wards together elect thirteen councillors to Blandford Forum Town Council; Blandford Central ward elects seven councillors, and the other three wards each elect three. The mayor of Blandford for 2022 - 2023 is Colin Stevens.
==Geography==
Blandford is situated between Cranborne Chase and the Dorset Downs, to the south-east of the Blackmore Vale, northwest of Poole and south-west of Salisbury. It is sited in the valley of the River Stour, mostly on rising ground northeast of the river, but with some development south of the river at Blandford St Mary. The underlying geology is Cretaceous chalk bedrock that in places is overlain by Quaternary drift: alluvium in the river&#x27;s flood plain, head deposits around the town&#x27;s south-west, south and south-east borders, and clay with flints at the highest part of the town in the north. The town is almost surrounded by land that has been designated as having landscape value of national significance: the Dorset National Landscape (an Area of Outstanding Natural Beauty, or AONB) to the west and the Cranborne Chase and West Wiltshire Downs AONB to the north and east.

==Architecture==
Most of the buildings in Blandford&#x27;s centre are Georgian, due to the rebuilding after the 1731 fire and the absence of subsequent change. Pevsner stated that &quot;hardly any other town in England can be compared with it&quot;. A 1970 report by Donald Insall Associates described Blandford as &quot;the most complete and cohesive surviving example of a Georgian country town in England&quot;, with the Market Place area in particular given the status of &quot;An Area of National Importance&quot; and described as &quot;a brilliant master piece&quot; [sic]. Buildings that have received Grade I listing by English Heritage are the parish church of St Peter and St Paul, the town hall and corn exchange, The Old House, Coupar House, Pump House, and several buildings in Market Place: numbers 18, 20 and 26, and the old Greyhound Inn. All the listed structures in Market Place, including the church and another seventeen buildings with either Grade II or Grade II* status, form a group, together with several listed properties in West Street and East Street.
The parish church of St Peter and St Paul was built between 1732 and 1739 and is a classical building with a cupola on top of the tower. The design by John Bastard originally specified that the tower would have a steeple, but lack of money resulted in the wooden cupola instead, a decision that disgusted Bastard, who stated that &quot;it will not keep the wett nor the weather out&quot;. Sir Frederick Treves was not a fan of the church&#x27;s appearance, describing it in his 1906 &quot;Highways &amp; Byways in Dorset&quot; as &quot;ugly, and only tolerable from a distance&quot;. The interior remains relatively unaffected by Victorian interference and retains its font, pulpit, box pews and Mayoral seat. The pulpit, originally designed for St Antholin&#x27;s in London, is by Sir Christopher Wren. The organ, dating from 1794, is by George Pike England and is the most intact of his surviving works; it allegedly had been intended for the Savoy Chapel in London, but was too big, so George III supposedly gave it to Blandford instead. In 1893 the church was enlarged by moving the apsidal sanctuary out on rollers onto new foundations and building a new chancel behind it. The Victorians did install galleries to accommodate an increasing congregation, though these were removed in the 1970s, a change that Pevsner called &quot;a visual blessing&quot;.

Blandford Forum Town Hall occupies a site in the Market Place close to the site that was occupied by its predecessor. It dates from 1734 and has a two-storey three-windowed frontage of Portland stone ashlar. The ground floor has three semi-circular arches leading to an open portico or loggia, called The Shambles, that used to be part of the market. Toward the back of the building is the old corn exchange, a late 19th-century assembly hall with &quot;interesting elliptical roof-trusses&quot;.

Coupar House, dated around 1750, is the largest private house in Blandford that dates from the post-fire period. It has a richly decorated interior with a notable staircase, and is unique among the town&#x27;s private dwellings for having Portland stone dressings to its brick façade, though the design of this frontage has been described as &quot;curiously amateurish&quot; with &quot;little attention ... paid to rules of proportion&quot;.

The Old House was probably built some time between 1650 and 1670 by a German doctor who practised in Blandford after graduating from The Queen&#x27;s College, Oxford. Its unusual design, which includes a steep hipped roof with wide spreading eaves, has elements of artisan style popular at the time, though it was described by John Hutchins as &quot;an architectural graft from the &#x27;fatherland&#x27; planted by the worthy doctor on the soil of his adopted country&quot;.

The Pump House fire monument was built by John Bastard in classical style to commemorate the fire. It dates from 1760, is of Portland stone and stands adjacent to the churchyard wall. The inscription on its rear wall states its purpose is &quot;... to prevent by a timely Supply of Water, (with God&#x27;s Blessing) the fatal Consequences of FIRE hereafter&quot;. In 1768 Bastard provided an endowment of £600. The monument was repaired in 1858 and the pump was replaced by a fountain in 1897.

To the south of the town a six-arch stone bridge spans the River Stour; it is built mostly of greensand with some heathstone and was extensively restored in 1726. The water meadows between it and the town are crossed by a causeway and two smaller bridges.

==Demography==
The 2021 census recorded a parish population of 10,355. At the 2011 census, Blandford Forum civil parish and the small neighbouring parish of Langton Long Blandford had a combined population of 10,325. The built-up area of Blandford extends south of the River Stour into the civil parish of Blandford St Mary; in 2013 the population of Blandford St Mary and Blandford Forum civil parishes combined was estimated as 12,110.

Previous census returns for the town show that it had a population of less than 4,000 until 1981, after which it increased rapidly; in the 2001 census, the town had 4,524 dwellings and a population of 8,760, of whom 96.5% were White British. Some of the population increase however can be accounted for by a boundary change which incorporated housing estates that already existed but were previously within a different parish (Pimperne) on the town&#x27;s northern side. Previous census figures for the town&#x27;s civil parish are shown in the table below:

==Transport==

Blandford lies at the junction of the A350 and A354 main roads but is skirted by an eastern bypass. The main road running through the town is the B3082, connecting Blandford Forum to Wimborne Minster. Blandford Forum is around southwest of junction 1 of the M27 motorway at Cadnam. Buses run from the town to locations including Poole, Bournemouth, Salisbury and Shaftesbury with the primary operator being Wilts &amp; Dorset.

Blandford is from Bournemouth Airport and from Poole railway station. From 1860 to 1966, was a stop on the Somerset and Dorset Joint Railway, which ran from Bath to Bournemouth, though until the bridge was built over the river Stour, opening in 1863, the Dorset Central section of the line terminated at the hamlet of Blandford St. Mary. Blandford Forum railway station, along with the whole line, closed to passengers in 1966. Located between and Broadstone, the railway was still open until the closure of the Blandford&#x27;s goods yard in 1969, after which the track was lifted. The station was immortalised in 1964 in the song &quot;Slow Train&quot; by Flanders and Swann.

Blandford Camp was served by a short-lived three-mile branch line, which left the main line just north of the river bridge. This operated intermittently from 1918 to 1928.

The Blandford fly (&quot;Simulium posticatum&quot;), a small (2–3 mm) biting fly belonging to the family Simuliidae or &quot;blackflies&quot; lives in the area. In recent years the weed beds in the river have been sprayed to reduce numbers.

Blandford Elm (&quot;Ulmus glabra&quot; &#x27;Superba&#x27;) is a (now rare) very large-leaved wych cultivar, first raised by nurseryman Gill of Blandford Forum in the early 1840s, and distributed by nurseries in the UK, Europe and the USA. Only one specimen is known to survive (2020), in Edinburgh.

<text>William Samuel Paley (September 28, 1901 – October 26, 1990) was an American businessman, primarily involved in the media, and best known as the chief executive who built the Columbia Broadcasting System (CBS) from a small radio network into one of the foremost radio and television network operations in the United States. 

==Early life and education==
Paley was born on September 28, 1901, in Chicago, Illinois, the son of Goldie ( Drell) and Samuel Paley. His family was Jewish, and his father was an immigrant from Ukraine who ran a cigar company. As the company became increasingly successful, Samuel Paley became a millionaire, and moved his family to Philadelphia in the early 1920s. 

William Paley matriculated at Western Military Academy in Alton, Illinois but later transferred to, and recorded his degree from, the University of Pennsylvania, where he was a member of the Theta chapter of Zeta Beta Tau fraternity. He was expecting to take an increasingly active role running the family cigar business upon graduation.

In 1927, Samuel Paley, Leon Levy (who was married to Paley&#x27;s sister, Blanche), and some business partners bought a struggling Philadelphia-based radio network of 16 stations called the Columbia Phonographic Broadcasting System. Samuel Paley&#x27;s intention was to use his acquisition as an advertising medium for promoting the family&#x27;s cigar business, which included the La Palina brand. Within a year, under William&#x27;s leadership, cigar sales had more than doubled, and, in 1928, the Paley family secured majority ownership of the network from their partners. Within a decade, William S. Paley had expanded the network to 114 affiliate stations.

==Career==
===Broadcasting===

Paley quickly grasped the earnings potential of radio and recognized that good programming was the key to selling advertising time and, in turn, bringing in profits to the network and to affiliate owners. Before Paley, most businessmen viewed stations as stand-alone local outlets, as the broadcast equivalent of local newspapers. Individual stations originally bought programming from the network and, thus, were considered the network&#x27;s clients.

Paley changed broadcasting&#x27;s business model not only by developing successful and lucrative broadcast programming but also by viewing advertisers and sponsors as the most significant element of the broadcasting equation. Paley provided network programming to affiliate stations at a nominal cost, thereby ensuring the widest possible distribution for both the programming and the advertising. The advertisers then became the network&#x27;s primary clients and, because of the wider distribution brought by the growing network, Paley was able to charge more for the ad time. Affiliates were required to carry programming offered by the network for part of the broadcast day, receiving a portion of the network&#x27;s fees from advertising revenue. At other times in the broadcast day, affiliates were free to offer local programming and sell advertising time locally.

Paley&#x27;s recognition of how to harness the potential reach of broadcasting was the key to his growing CBS from a tiny chain of stations into what was eventually one of the world&#x27;s dominant communication empires. During his prime, Paley was described as having an uncanny sense for popular taste and exploiting that insight to build the CBS network. As war clouds darkened over Europe in the late 1930s, Paley recognized Americans&#x27; desire for news coverage of the coming war and built the CBS news division into a dominant force just as he had previously built the network&#x27;s entertainment division.

As early as 1940 Paley envisioned the creation of a network division within CBS tasked with serving much of South America. In collaboration with his news director Paul White and his director of short wave operations Edmund Chester, Paley laid the foundation for a chain of sixty-four stations in eighteen countries which would subsequently be known as La Cadena de las Americas (The Network of the Americas). By 1942, Paley&#x27;s innovative network was broadcasting both news and cultural programming live from CBS in New York City in cooperation with the government&#x27;s Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs under the direction of a young Nelson Rockefeller. During World War II, these broadcasts played a central role in promoting cultural diplomacy and Pan Americanism as part of President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s Good Neighbor Policy. In 1943, he and Chester were awarded the Carlos Manuel de Cespedes National Order of Merit by the Cuban government in recognition of his efforts to foster greater understanding between the peoples of Cuba and the United States of America, in recognition of services performed by the Columbia Broadcasting System&#x27;s Latin-American shortwave radio network.

During World War II, Paley served as director of radio operations of the Psychological Warfare branch in the Office of War Information at Allied Force Headquarters in London, where he held the rank of colonel. While based in England during the war, Paley came to know and befriend Edward R. Murrow, CBS&#x27;s head of European news who expanded the news division&#x27;s foreign coverage with a team of war correspondents later known as the Murrow Boys. In 1946, Paley promoted Frank Stanton to president of CBS. CBS expanded into television and rode the postwar TV boom to surpass NBC, which had dominated radio.

CBS has owned the Columbia Record Company and its associated CBS Laboratories since 1939. In June 1948, Columbia Records introduced the 33-1/3-rpm LP record, which could hold more than 20 minutes&#x27; worth of music on each side, and became a standard recording format through the 1970s. Also, CBS Laboratories and Peter Goldmark developed a method for color television. After lobbying by RCA President David Sarnoff and Paley in Washington, D.C., the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) approved the CBS system, but later reversed the decision based on the CBS system&#x27;s incompatibility with black and white receivers. The new, compatible RCA color system was selected as the standard, and CBS sold the patents to its system to foreign broadcasters as PAL SECAM. CBS broadcast few color programs during this period, reluctant to supplement RCA revenue. They did, however, buy and license some RCA equipment and technology, taking the RCA markings off of the equipment, and later relying exclusively on Philips-Norelco for color equipment beginning in 1964, when color television sets became widespread. PAL or Phase Alternating Line, an analogue TV-encoding system, is today a television-broadcasting standard used in large parts of the world.

&quot;Bill Paley erected two towers of power: one for entertainment and one for news,&quot; &quot;60 Minutes&quot; creator Don Hewitt claimed in his autobiography, &quot;Tell Me a Story&quot;. &quot;And he decreed that there would be no bridge between them... In short, Paley was the guy who put Frank Sinatra and Edward R. Murrow on the radio and &quot;60 Minutes&quot; on television.&quot;

Paley was not fond of one of the network&#x27;s biggest stars. Arthur Godfrey had been working locally in Washington, DC and New York City hosting morning shows. Paley did not consider him worthy of CBS, being a mere local host. When Paley went into the Army and took up his assignment in London, and Frank Stanton assumed his duties, he decided to try Godfrey on the network. By the time Paley returned, Godfrey was a rising star on the network with his daily &quot;Arthur Godfrey Time&quot; program. Paley had to accept the entertainer, but the two were never friends. Godfrey would, on occasion, mock Paley and other CBS executives by name, on the air. Godfrey&#x27;s massive revenues from advertising on the popular morning programs and his two prime-time shows &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot; and &quot;Arthur Godfrey and his Friends,&quot; protected him from any reprisals. In private, Paley and his colleagues despised Godfrey.

The relationship between Paley and his news staff was not always smooth. His friendship with Edward R. Murrow, one of the leading lights in the CBS news division (and by then a vice president of CBS), suffered during the 1950s over the hard-hitting tone of the Murrow-hosted &quot;See It Now&quot; series. The implication was that the network&#x27;s sponsors were uneasy about some of the controversial topics of the series, leading Paley to worry about lost revenue to the network as well as unwelcome scrutiny during the era of McCarthyism. In 1955, Alcoa withdrew its sponsorship of &quot;See It Now&quot;, and eventually the program&#x27;s weekly broadcast on Tuesdays was stopped, though it continued as a series of special segments until 1958.

In 1959, James T. Aubrey Jr. became the president of CBS. Under Aubrey, the network became the most popular on television with shows like &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies&quot; and &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;. However, Paley&#x27;s personal favorite was &quot;Gunsmoke&quot;; in fact, he was such a fan of &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; that, upon its threatened cancellation in 1967, he demanded that it be reinstated, a dictum that led to the abrupt demise of &quot;Gilligan&#x27;s Island&quot;, which had already been renewed for a fourth season.

During the 1963–1964 television season, 14 of the top 15 shows on prime-time and the top 12 shows of daytime television were on CBS. Aubrey, however, fought constantly with Fred W. Friendly of CBS News, and Paley did not like Aubrey&#x27;s taste in low-brow programming. Aubrey and Paley bickered to the point that Aubrey approached Frank Stanton to propose a take-over of CBS. The takeover never materialized and, when CBS&#x27;s ratings began to slip, Paley fired Aubrey in 1965.

In 1972, Paley ordered the shortening of a second installment of a two-part &quot;CBS Evening News&quot; series on the Watergate scandal, based on a complaint by Charles Colson, an aide to President Richard Nixon. And later, Paley briefly ordered the suspension of instant and often negatively critical analyses by CBS news commentators which followed presidential addresses.

Over the years, Paley sold portions of his family stockholding in CBS. At the time of his death, he owned less than nine percent of the outstanding stock. In 1995, five years after Paley&#x27;s death, CBS was bought by Westinghouse Electric Corporation and, in 1999, by Viacom, which itself was once a subsidiary of CBS. Today, CBS is owned by Paramount Global, after merging with the &quot;new&quot; Viacom in 2019.

== Art Collection ==
Paley acquired an art collection consisting of approximately forty works, many of which are today in the Museum of Modern Art in New York. Paley&#x27;s collection included works by Cezanne, Matisse, Picasso, Toulouse-Lautrec, Degas, Derain, Bonnard, Gauguin, and Rouault. He acquired Picasso&#x27;s &quot;Boy Leading a Horse&quot; in 1936 and donated it to the MoMA in 1964 however its Nazi-era provenance turned out to be problematic and resulted in a claim for restitution filed by the heirs of Paul von Mendelssohn-Bartholdy who said it had been sold under duress. The lawsuit, known as Schoeps v. The Museum of Modern Art, was about to go to trial when a settlement between the parties was announced. 

Other works from the Paley collection include Paul Cézanne L&#x27;Estaque which he acquired in 1935, Henri Matisse&#x27;s &quot;Woman with a Veil,&quot; which he acquired in 1936, Paul Gauguin&#x27;s Washerwomen, which he acquired in 1958 and Paul Cézanne&#x27;s &quot;Milk Can and Apples.&quot;

The MoMA organized a special exhibition of the William Paley Collection in 1992. 

In 2022, twenty-nine artworks, including five on long term loan to the MoMA, from the Paley collection were auctioned at Sothebys on consignment from the William S. Paley Foundation. 

==Other interests==
In the 1940s, William Paley and his brother-in-law Leon Levy formed Jaclyn Stable, which owned and raced a string of thoroughbred race horses. He enjoyed photographing Picasso in Cap d&#x27;Antibes. Like Picasso, Paley drove an exotic French Facel Vega Facel II, the fastest four-seater car in the world in the early 1960s.

In 1964, CBS purchased the New York Yankees from Del Webb and Dan Topping. Subsequently, the storied baseball team fell into mediocrity, not making the postseason for the next ten years. In 1973, Paley sold the team at its low ebb for $8.7 million to Cleveland shipbuilder George Steinbrenner and a group of investors. Under the Steinbrenner regime, the Yankees grew in value to what, in April 2006, &quot;Forbes&quot; magazine estimated was $1.26 billion, or about $280 million in 1973 dollars.

===Philanthropy===
Encouraged by Paley&#x27;s avid interest in modern art and his outstanding collection, the Rockefeller family&#x27;s Museum of Modern Art made Paley a trustee in the 1930s; in 1962 he was tapped by then-chairman David Rockefeller to be its president. In 1968, he joined a syndicate with Rockefeller and others to buy six works by Picasso for the museum from the notable Gertrude Stein collection. He subsequently became chairman, stepping down from the museum post in 1985.

In 1974, Paley dedicated the second building at the S.I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University. He also personally dedicated the Samuel L. Paley library at Temple University named in honor of his father.

The Paley Center for Media was founded by Paley in New York City in 1976 as the Museum of Broadcasting. From 1991 to 2007, it was known as The Museum of Television and Radio; its new location was known as the Paley Building. An L.A. branch opened in 1996, and closed in 2020.

==Personal life==

===Marriage to Dorothy Hart Hearst===
Paley met Dorothy Hart Hearst (1908–1998) while she was married to John Randolph Hearst, the third son of William Randolph Hearst. Paley fell in love with her, and, after her Las Vegas divorce from Hearst, she and Paley married on May 12, 1932, in Kingman, Arizona.

Dorothy called on her extensive social connections acquired during her previous marriage to introduce Paley to several top members of President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s government. She also exerted a considerable influence over Paley&#x27;s political views. She later said: &quot;I can&#x27;t believe he would have voted Democrat without me.&quot;

Dorothy began to become estranged from Paley during the early 1940s because of his infidelity. They divorced on July 24, 1947, in Reno, Nevada. She retained custody of their two adopted children, Jeffrey Paley and Hilary Paley. In 1953, Dorothy married stockbroker Walter Hirshon; they divorced in 1961.

===Marriage to Barbara Cushing Mortimer===
Paley married divorcée, socialite and fashion icon Barbara Cushing Mortimer (1915–1978) affectionally referred to as &quot;Babe&quot; on July 28, 1947 and they remained married until her death. She was the daughter of renowned neurosurgeon Harvey Cushing. William and Babe Paley, in spite of their successes and social standing, were barred from being members of country clubs on Long Island because he was Jewish. As an alternative, the Paleys built a summer home, &quot;Kiluna North,&quot; on Squam Lake in New Hampshire and spent the summers there for many years, routinely entertaining their many friends, including Lucille Ball, Grace Kelly, and David O. Selznick. The couple had two children, William and Kate.

===Other affairs===
Paley was a notorious womanizer his entire life. His first marriage to Dorothy ended when a newspaper published a suicide note written to Paley by a former girlfriend. He provided a small stipend to a former lover, actress Louise Brooks, for the rest of her life. In his later years he enjoyed keeping company with several women. Paley was included in a list of the ten most eligible bachelors compiled by &quot;Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine in 1985; the irony of the octogenarian Paley being on the list was an inspiration for &quot;Late Night with David Letterman&#x27;s&quot; nightly Top Ten lists.

===Death===
Paley died of kidney failure on October 26, 1990, less than a month after his 89th birthday. He was buried at the Memorial Cemetery of St. John&#x27;s Episcopal Church beside his second wife Babe.

<doc id="366491" wikidata="Q4899777" url="?curid=366491" title="Bexhill, New South Wales">
<text>Bexhill is a small village in New South Wales, Australia. As of 2006, the town had a population of 472 people. It is located about from Byron Bay and about from Lismore and is within the City of Lismore local government area.

It is on the Murwillumbah railway line and on Bangalow Road.

The traditional owners of this area are the Widjabul people of the Bundjalung nation.

== Attractions ==
Bexhill is well known for its open air cathedral which is managed by volunteers from the nearby Uniting Church. The &quot;cathedral&quot; has native gardens and overlooks a large length of valley and hills along Coopers Creek. It is well used for wedding services and special events.

The village also contains an old quarry, formerly the Bexhill Brickworks, which is officially closed for recreational purposes. In 2016, the Daily Telegraph reported that the water had high levels of acidity but many people swim there despite the closure.

The Bexhill Quarry Parklands Association has been set up with the aim of developing the site into a regional parkland for visitors and residents. The quarry site would be linked with the planned Northern Rivers Rail Trail which is partly complete. 

The regeneration plan for the quarry was boosted in July 2023 by $2000 in funding from Greater Bank&#x27;s #GreaterNorthernRivers Community Funding program. 

== Geography ==
The village is located on the end of a ridge of basalt hills. The village itself is located on sedimentary rocks of the Clarence Moreton Basin and is surrounded by the Wilsons River and Coopers Creek flood plains.

Bexhill, established in the early 19th century, was the central point of the early North Coast of New South Wales. In the 19th century Bexhill was known as Baldhill.

Bexhill&#x27;s early production was red cedar logging, its close proximity to Boat Harbour made the floating of logs an easy task during flood waters. The Bexhill Public School (established around 1850) was subject to easy flooding as well, and was eventually relocated to higher ground. After the Federation of Australia the population of Bexhill began to dwindle. 

The trades it produced were no longer as vital and people started to migrate to more lively parts of the far north coast. With the population slowly moving out, parts of Bexhill began to close. The post office which brought the surrounding areas its post closed down, relocating to Lismore. The Bexhill Brick works which produced the bricks for the far north coast closed down towards the end of the 1990s, unable to keep up with the production of bricks from Coffs Harbour and Newcastle.

<doc id="366496" wikidata="Q2580406" url="?curid=366496" title="William Ross Macdonald">
<text>William Ross Macdonald (December 25, 1891 – May 28, 1976), served as the 21st Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 1968 to 1974, and as 22nd Speaker of the House of Commons of Canada from 1949 to 1953.

== Early life ==
Macdonald was born in Toronto, Ontario, to a dry goods merchant who had immigrated from Scotland. He went on to study law at the University of Toronto and the Osgoode Hall Law School. Upon completion, he practised law in Brantford, Ontario, and served with the 2nd Canadian Division Cyclist Company and 4th Battalion of the Canadian Expeditionary Force in the First World War.

In 1921, Macdonald married Muriel Whittaker.

== Political career ==
Macdonald sought Liberal Party nomination to run for election to the House of Commons of Canada for the 1926 election, but lost the nomination by a single vote. He won the nomination for the Brantford riding in the next election, but lost the election. Macdonald was elected in the 1935 election. He served as Member of Parliament (MP) until 1953.

During World War II, Macdonald was a staunch supporter of conscription. His position is made clear in this wartime quote taken from a Canadian newspaper, &quot;There is a victory to be won and that can be accomplished only by every Canadian taking part.&quot; After the war, he served as Deputy Speaker (1945–1949) and then as Speaker of the House of Commons (1949–1953).

While serving as Speaker of the House of Commons Macdonald made a famous ruling, banning musical instruments from being played in the Chamber, on June 3, 1950. The ban came about after Daniel McIvor MP for Fort William played a flute while waiting for a vote call.

In 1953, Governor General Vincent Massey, on the advice of Prime Minister Louis St. Laurent, appointed Macdonald to the Senate of Canada, where he became Leader of the Government in the Canadian Senate and a minister without portfolio in the Canadian Cabinet. From 1954 until the Liberal government&#x27;s defeat in the 1957 election, Macdonald served as Solicitor General of Canada.

With the defeat of the Liberals, he became Leader of the Opposition in the Canadian Senate, and served again as Government Leader when the Liberals returned to power in 1963. He retired from the Cabinet in 1964. From 1964 to 1972, he was the second Chancellor of Waterloo Lutheran University.
Governor General Roland Michener, on the advice of Lester Pearson, appointed Macdonald to serve as Lieutenant Governor from 1968 to 1974. In this role, he was involved with many service groups, such as the Canadian Order of Foresters and the Kiwanis Club.

In 1974, he was made an Officer of the Order of Canada. The Ontario School for the Blind in Brantford was renamed the W. Ross Macdonald School in his honour.

He died in Toronto in 1976.

== Freemasonry ==
William Macdonald was a devoted Freemason initiated on March 17, 1917 at the Doric Lodge No. 121 in Brantford, Ontario.

<doc id="366497" wikidata="Q288082" url="?curid=366497" title="Gainsborough, Lincolnshire">
<text>Gainsborough () is a market town and civil parish in the West Lindsey district of Lincolnshire, England. The population was 20,842 at the 2011 census, and estimated at 23,243 in 2019. It lies on the east bank of the River Trent, north-west of Lincoln, south-west of Scunthorpe, 20 miles south-east of Doncaster and east of Sheffield. It is sometimes claimed to be England&#x27;s furthest-inland port.

==History==


===King Alfred, Sweyn Forkbeard and Cnut the Great===
The place-name Gainsborough first appears in the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle of 1013 as &quot;Gegnesburh&quot; and &quot;Gæignesburh&quot;. In the Domesday Book of 1086, it appears as &quot;Gainesburg&quot;: Gegn&#x27;s fortified place. It was one of the capital cities of Mercia in the Anglo-Saxon period that preceded Danish rule. Its choice by the Vikings as an administrative centre was influenced by its proximity to the Danish stronghold at Torksey.

In 868 King Alfred married Ealhswith (Ealswitha), daughter of Æthelred Mucel, chief of the Gaini, whence the town gets its name.

Historically, Gainsborough is the &quot;capital that never was&quot;. Towards the end of July 1013, the Dane Sweyn Forkbeard and his son and heir Cnut (Canute) arrived in Gainsborough with an army of conquest. Sweyn defeated the English opposition, and King Ethelred fled the country. Sweyn was declared King of England and returned to Gainsborough. Sweyn and Cnut took up high office at the Gainsborough Castle on the site of the present-day Old Hall, while his army occupied the camp at Thonock (now known as Castle Hills). However, Sweyn died, or perhaps was killed five weeks later in Gainsborough. His son Cnut established a base elsewhere. So Gainsborough was named as capital of England and of Denmark for five weeks in the year 1013.

Cnut may have performed his unsuccessful attempt to turn the tide back in the River Trent at Gainsborough. Historians believe he may have been demonstrating on the Trent Aegir, a tidal bore. He and his supporters may have known Gainsborough was the furthest reach of the aegir, and ideal for his demonstration. However, the story was only written down a century later by Henry of Huntingdon, who gives no location, and it may have been a myth or a fable.

===Medieval Gainsborough===
The Domesday Book (1086) records that Gainsborough was a community of farmers, villeins and sokemen, tenants of Geoffrey de Guerche.

The Lindsey Survey of 1115–1118 records that Gainsborough was held by Nigel d&#x27;Aubigny, the forebear of the Mowbray family, whose interest in Gainsborough continued until at least the end of the 14th century.

A weekly market was granted by King John in 1204.

===Gainsborough Old Hall===
Thomas Burgh acquired the manor of Gainsborough in 1455. He built Gainsborough Old Hall between 1460 and 1480, a large, 15th-century, timber-framed medieval strong house, and one of the best-preserved manor houses in Britain. It boasts a magnificent Great Hall and strong brick tower. King Richard III in 1483 and King Henry VIII in 1541 both stayed at the Old Hall. The manor was sold to the Hickman family in 1596.

===English Civil War===
The town was garrisoned for the King in January 1643 and began cooperating with the garrison at Newark in raiding the surrounding countryside and harassing Parliamentarians there. With the Great North Road blocked to Parliamentarian traffic, Gainsborough became significant as part of a route around Newark by way of Lincoln and the line of the modern A15 road. It was in Royalist interests to obstruct this, which gave rise to battles at Gainsborough and Winceby. Parliament captured Gainsborough in the battle on 20 July, but it was immediately besieged by a large Royalist army and forced to surrender after three days.

Parliament captured Gainsborough again on 18 December 1643, but had to withdraw in March 1644, razing the town&#x27;s defences to prevent their use by the enemy. The Earl of Manchester&#x27;s army passed through Gainsborough in May 1644 on its way to York and the Battle of Marston Moor.

After the Civil War ended in 1645, several people in Gainsborough were fined for Royalist sympathies, including Sir Willoughby Hickman, 1st Baronet at the Old Hall, who had been created the first Baronet of Gainsborough by Charles I in 1643.

===Churches===

The first record of a church at Gainsborough is in 1180, when the rectory there was granted by Roger de Talebu to the great Preceptory of the Knights Templar in Lindsey, at Willoughton. In 1547, following the English Reformation, the parish of Gainsborough came under the jurisdiction of the Bishop of Lincoln for the first time.

The medieval Church of All Saints fell into disrepair after the Civil War. In 1736 it was demolished to make way for a new parish church completed in 1748 in a mix of perpendicular Gothic and Classical Revival styles. All that remains of the medieval church is the west tower, 90 feet high with a ring of eight bells. A monument to Richard Rollett, master sailmaker on Captain James Cook&#x27;s second voyage, is located in the porch. All Saints remains the main parish church of the town.

The town&#x27;s rising 19th-century population called for a second church in the south of the town; Holy Trinity Church opened in 1843. This was followed by St John the Divine Church in Ashcroft Road in 1882, and St George&#x27;s Church in Heapham Road in the 1950s. Holy Trinity closed in 1971 and is now the Trinity Arts Centre. St John the Divine church was closed in 2002 and it is now used for a cafe and community centre.

Non-conformism flourished in Gainsborough. It has often been claimed that some of the Mayflower Pilgrims worshipped in secret at the Old Hall before sailing for Holland to find religious freedom in 1609; no historical evidence for this has been found, whereas the congregation of John Smyth that met in the town developed into the Baptists and some returned to England. The John Robinson Memorial Church in Church Street was dedicated in 1897; the cornerstone was laid by Thomas F. Bayard, US Ambassador. Now the United Reformed Church, it was named in honour of John Robinson (1576–1625), pastor of the &quot;Pilgrim Fathers&quot; before they left on the &quot;Mayflower&quot;.

John Wesley, the founder of Methodism, preached in Gainsborough several times between 1759 and 1790. The town&#x27;s first Methodist chapel opened in Church Lane in 1788, moving to a new site in North Street in 1804, and rebuilt there as St Stephen&#x27;s in 1966. The Primitive Methodists set up in the town in 1819, with chapels in Spring Gardens (1838), Trinity Street (1877) and Ropery Road (1910). St Thomas&#x27;s Church in Cross Street caters for the town&#x27;s Roman Catholics.

===Second World War===
Gainsborough suffered its only large-scale air raid of the war on the night of 10 May 1941. High-explosive bombs and incendiaries were dropped, but many fell harmlessly on the surrounding countryside. There was only minor damage in the town and no casualties.

On the night of 28–29 April 1942 a single Dornier 217 dropped a stick of bombs on the town centre, causing extensive damage and the loss of seven lives. On 31 December 1942, a RCAF Bristol Beaufighter aircraft on a training exercise crashed on Noel Street, killing both airmen and a three-year-old girl. On 22 May 1944 a RAF Spitfire fighter, in a training exercise, collided with a Wellington bomber and crashed into a Sheffield-bound goods train as it was passing over the railway bridge on Lea Road. The pilot was the only casualty.

In the early hours of 5 March 1945 a single Junkers Ju 88 fighter/bomber made a low-level attack over the town, dropping anti-personnel bombs on Church Street and the surrounding residential area. Three people died and 50 houses were damaged.

===New town===
There was a proposal to develop Gainsborough as a new town linked to Sheffield, but the plan was not pursued. New housing was instead built to the south-east of Sheffield.

===Governance===

The town was before 1974 in the Gainsborough Urban District in the county of Lindsey. West Lindsey District Council was formed from five former councils. Gainsborough Town Council was established in 1992, and in the same year Gainsborough&#x27;s first mayor was appointed. The council consists of four wards, Gainsborough Hill, Gainsborough North-East, Gainsborough North-West, and Gainsborough Trent, which elect a total of 18 councillors. The next municipal elections are scheduled for May 2027.

Sir Edward Leigh has been Gainsborough&#x27;s Member of Parliament (MP) since 1983.

===Oil===
In July 1958, BP discovered oil at Corringham, then at Gainsborough in January 1959.

==Geography==

The town is at the meeting point of the east–west A631, which crosses the Trent on Trent Bridge at the only point between the M180 and the A57), the A156 from the south to Torksey and A159 from Scunthorpe).

The dual-carriageway &quot;Thorndike Way&quot; was intended to link with the A15 at Caenby Corner; it only reaches eastward to the town boundary. It is named after the locally born actress Dame Sybil Thorndike. The former A631 through the town is now the B1433. Work on the 4km bypass was started by Tarmac in late 1972, and opened on Friday 10 May 1974.

The civil parish extends south across rural land to Lea. The boundary passes to the south of Warren Wood, north of Lea Wood Farm, and along the northern edge of Lea Wood northwards through Bass Wood, where it meets Corringham, the main settlement to the east of Gainsborough. The boundary crosses &quot;Thorndike Way&quot; (A631) and briefly follows the B1433. At Belt Farm it meets &quot;Thonock&quot;, then follows &quot;The Belt Road&quot;, to the south of Gainsborough Golf Club, then down &quot;Thonock Hill&quot; to the edge of the Trent Valley.

==George Eliot and &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot;==
Many scholars believe Gainsborough to be the basis for the fictional town of St Ogg&#x27;s in George Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot; (1860). The novelist visited Gainsborough in 1859, staying in the house of a shipbuilder in Bridge Street, which survives today as the United Services Club. The stone bridge and the nearby willow tree are mentioned and the Old Hall is described in detail. Thomas Miller&#x27;s &quot;Our Old Town&quot; published two years before, included the true story of a miller who loses a lawsuit after assaulting his adversary, and George Eliot used a similar story plot in &quot;The Mill on the Floss&quot; as the basis of the Tulliver/Wakem feud. It is also possible that she witnessed the Trent Aegir, which inspired the flood in her story&#x27;s climax.

==Economy==
===Boiler-maker and ironworks===
Gainsborough has a long history of industry. It was the manufacturing base of Marshall, Sons &amp; Co., a boiler-maker founded by William Marshall in 1848, who died in 1861 and was buried in the cemetery in Ropery Road. His business became one of the joint-stock companies run by his sons James and Henry. It occupied the 16-acre Britannia Ironworks, the biggest in Europe when built. Marshall&#x27;s Works&#x27; steam engines were sold worldwide until it closed in the 1980s. The site is now split among various companies. Tesco in Beaumont Street and Dransfield&#x27;s occupy about nine acres; the remainder is held by local companies.

===Packaging===
Another area of Gainsborough industry is Rose Brothers, named after William German Rose and Walter Rose, the co-founders. In 1893 William Rose invented the world&#x27;s first packaging machine. Two years later it bought the Trentside Works site and started to expand into many other areas, producing items such as starch, razor blades and sweets such as Cadbury&#x27;s chocolates, its name appearing on the Roses selection. The firm produced seaside rock-making machines, cigarette-making machines and bread-slicing and wrapping machines. When it closed, A. M. P. Rose bought the confectionery packaging side. The Rose Brothers Ground hosted cricket matches.

By the east bank of the Trent near the railway bridge is a large mill owned by Kerry Ingredients (headquartered in Tralee).

===Wigs, jokes and exhausts===
Gainsborough is the home of two of the largest importers of jokes and novelties into the UK: Smiffy&#x27;s (formerly known as RH Smith &amp; Sons, founded in 1894), and Pam&#x27;s of Gainsborough, a smaller firm founded in 1986. Smiffy&#x27;s were the only wigmaker left in the UK until December 2008, when bulk production moved to the Far East and over 35 jobs were lost. The firm has set its future goals on a more mature fancy dress and party market.

Another local business is Eminox, founded in 1978. It started by building replacement exhausts for the local bus company, then expanded into manufacturing large stainless steel exhaust systems for buses and commercial vehicles. It also builds low-emission catalytic systems for the London low emission zone.

==Landmarks==
Beside Riverside Walk are Whitton&#x27;s Mill flats, which won a Royal Town Planning Institute award for the East Midlands. Marshall&#x27;s Yard also received an award, for regeneration.

West Lindsey District Council had its offices at the Guildhall, Lord Street, but moved in January 2008 to a £4.3 million new-build in Marshall&#x27;s Yard.

Silver Street is home to many Gainsborough shops. Elswitha Hall is the birthplace of Halford John Mackinder, founder of the Geographical Association.

A water tower in Heapham Road was built in 1897 to mark the Diamond Jubilee of Queen Victoria.

==Transport==
===Railway===

The town has two railway stations on different routes. The main station is Gainsborough Lea Road in Lea Road (A156) in the south of the town, serving the Sheffield-Lincoln and Doncaster-Lincoln lines with mainly hourly services to , and . Sheffield services generally call at , and Sheffield only, then continue towards . The other station is Gainsborough Central near the town centre. It serves the Brigg branch line and is the terminus of an hourly service to and from Sheffield on Mondays to Saturdays, calling at all stations. On Saturdays there are three services to via and .

Where the railway crosses the Trent, the four lines come together at two junctions on either side of the river. The lines from Lincoln and Cleethorpes meet at East Trent Junction, east of the river. Those from Sheffield and Doncaster meet at West Trent Junction on the opposite side in Nottinghamshire.

West Burton Power Station is to the south-west of the town, next to the Sheffield-Lincoln Line.

===Buses===
The town bus station in Hickmen Street has frequent services on Monday to Saturday, but no Sunday services. Most town routes are served by Stagecoach. Two local services connect the uphill area of the town and Morton to the town centre, one running clockwise, the other anti-clockwise. The town has a connection hub with hourly services to Lincoln, Scunthorpe and Retford and a service to Doncaster every two hours. These serve several villages along the route. Other bus services run during school terms.

===Rivers===

Gainsborough is sometimes claimed as the British port furthest inland, at over from the North Sea. It has had a long history of river shipping trade.

There is still one wharf, but ships no longer navigate this far up river. Commercial shipping remains further down the river at Gunness Wharf, Grove Wharf and Flixborough Wharf, which has direct rail links. This leads to some to argue that Goole, to the north of the town, is now the most inland port in the UK.

At the A631 Trent Bridge, there was a ferry before 1787, a distance of 235 feet. The bridge was completed for £12,000 in the spring of 1791, but it meant that taller river traffic of the day could no longer go further upstream. Originally a toll bridge, it was bought by the Ministry of Transport, Lindsey County Council, Gainsborough Urban District and Nottinghamshire County Council for £130,000 in 1927 and declared toll-free on 31 March 1932.

In the 1970s, the town council planned to build another bridge adjacent to the existing one on the North side and extend the Thorndike Way dual-carriageway across the river and join The Flood Road dual-carriageway. However, all of the funding for the project was given for the completion of the Humber Bridge, which opened in 1981.

==Sport==
The town is home to the semi-professional football club Gainsborough Trinity F.C., which plays in the Northern Premier League, the seventh level of English football. For a brief spell in the early 20th century, the club was professional and a member of the Football League. The Gainsborough United F.C. was active in 1980.

Gainsborough Rugby Club (the All Blacks) has played Rugby Union in the town since 1924.

The town is home to the Gainsborough &amp; Morton Striders Athletic Club, who in 2013 were awarded England Athletics&#x27; &quot;Run England&quot; National Group of the Year. The club was founded in July 1983.

There are several cycling clubs, including Trent Valley Road Club, Viking Velo and Gainsborough Aegir Cycling Club.

==Media==
Television signals are received from either the Belmont or Emley Moor TV transmitters.
Local radio stations are BBC Radio Lincolnshire, Greatest Hits Radio Lincolnshire, Hits Radio Lincolnshire and Trentside Radio, a community based radio station. 
The town&#x27;s local newspapers are the &quot;Gainsborough Standard&quot; and &quot;Lincolnshire Echo&quot;.

==Attractions==
The house and grounds of Richmond Park, in the north of the town, opened as a public park in 1947; attractions include greenhouses, an aviary and a 600-year-old oak tree. Whitton Gardens on the Riverside opened in 1973.

Gainsborough Model Railway Society features one of the largest model railways in ‘O’ gauge, depicting The East Coast Main Line from Kings Cross to Leeds Central. The model railway build commenced in 1953, covers 2500 square feet, has over 1200 feet of main line track and needs ten operators.

Gainsborough Old Hall is over five hundred years old and one of the best preserved medieval manor houses in England.

Gainsborough Town Hall, which was built in 1892, is now an entertainment venue with seating for up to 150 people.

Renovation of the town&#x27;s river banks was completed in 2002, providing riverside access. On the second weekend in June in that year, the town hosted the Gainsborough Riverside Festival, an annual arts/heritage event that ran until 2013, when it fell to financial constraints.

Trinity Art Centre hosts live music, plays, comedy, and also screens films. There is a volunteer-run charity called Gainsborough Heritage Centre, with displays of a range of object from the town&#x27;s past.

==Education==
Unlike most of the UK, Lincolnshire retains a tripartite system, with secondary education for many pupils decided by voluntary examination at eleven. The town has one of the top state schools in the country, Queen Elizabeth&#x27;s High School (selective state grammar school from 11 to 18 featuring a sixth form) on Morton Terrace (A159).

QEHS students earn outstanding GCSE and A-Level results and the school is over-subscribed.
The town has several primary schools.

There are links beyond the town to the John Leggott Sixth Form College in Scunthorpe, North Lindsey College, and Lincoln College, which has a branch at Gainsborough College in Acland Street, focusing on vocational education.

<doc id="366499" wikidata="Q6732036" url="?curid=366499" title="Magnum Research">
<text>Magnum Research, Inc. (MRI) was an American privately held corporation based in Fridley, Minnesota which manufactured and distributed firearms. The majority owners, Jim Skildum (President and CEO) and John Risdall (Chairman, COO), had been with the company since its founding in 1979.

In June 2010 Magnum Research, in financial difficulties, was sold to Kahr Arms, an American-based producer of compact pistols.

== Products ==

=== Desert Eagle Pistol ===
MRI was responsible for the design and development of the Desert Eagle pistol. The design was refined and for some time the pistols were also manufactured by Israel Military Industries (IMI) until 1995, when MRI shifted the manufacturing contract and license to Saco Defense in Saco, Maine. In 1998 MRI shifted manufacturing back to IMI, which later reorganized under the name Israel Weapon Industries. Since 2009 the Desert Eagle Pistol has been exclusively produced in the USA only, at MRI’s Pillager, Minnesota facility. Both Saco and IMI/IWI were strictly manufacturing contractors: all of the intellectual property, including patents, copyrights and trademarks of the Desert Eagle since its creation have been the property of Magnum Research Incorporated, excluding the patent on the production model which was owned by IMI.

=== Jericho 941 Pistol / Baby Eagle ===
Magnum Research imported the IMI/IWI Jericho 941 series of pistols under the Baby Eagle name until the end of 2008 and resumed importation of this model in 2011 under the name Baby Eagle II. Currently, the Baby Eagle name is used on a new series of striker-fired polymer-framed pistols. For a time they also imported the Barak SP-21 pistol, but it is no longer offered. 

=== Single-Action Magnum Revolvers ===
Other products include the BFR series of single-action magnum revolvers, the Mountain Eagle rifle, Magnum Lite rifle, and Micro Desert Eagle.

=== Custom Service ===
MRI offered custom gunsmithing services and had a line of guns that were coated with titanium nitride in artful patterns and designs.

=== Current models ===

* Magnum Research DE1911G, DE1911C, and DE1911U 
* Desert Eagle (Mark VII pistol, Mark XIX pistol)
* Magnum Lite (rimfire rifle)
* Magnum Research BFR (Big Frame Revolver)

* MR Eagle Series Pistols
* Mountain Eagle (center-fire rifle)

<text>William Earl Rowe, (13 May 1894 – 9 February 1984), was a politician in Ontario, Canada. He served as the 20th Lieutenant Governor of Ontario from 1963 to 1968.

==Background==
Rowe was born in Hull, Iowa, United States, of Canadian parents in 1894. He moved to Ontario with his family at the age of two and grew up to become a farmer and cattle breeder. In 1917, he married Treva Alda Lillian Lennox. Together, they had four children, one of whom died during labour.

==Politics==
He was reeve of the township of West Gwillimbury from 1919 to 1923. Rowe served as a Member of Provincial Parliament from 1923 to 1925, when elected to the House of Commons, where he served until 1935.

From 1936 to 1938, he was leader of Conservative Party of Ontario, but he did not have a seat in the legislature and so George S. Henry remained Leader of the Opposition.

In the public mind, the cause of labour was identified with the American Congress of Industrial Organizations and communism. During the 1937 provincial election, when Liberal premier Mitchell Hepburn was railing against the CIO&#x27;s attempt to unionize General Motors and the supposed threat posed by organized labour, Rowe refused to take a stand against the CIO and repeatedly asserted that &quot;the issue was not law and order but the right of free association.&quot; The Conservatives were then strongly associated with the Orange Order, which had long held a pro-labour position. Rowe&#x27;s stance resulted in George A. Drew breaking with the party to run unsuccessfully as an &quot;Independent Conservative&quot; in the 1937 election in opposition to Rowe&#x27;s position.

Rowe failed to win his seat in the 1937 provincial election but successfully ran in a by-election held in November 1937 to regain the seat in the federal House of Commons from which he had resigned two months earlier to run in the provincial election. He was succeeded as leader by his former rival, Drew. Drew went on to serve as Premier of Ontario in the 1940s before he moved to federal politics.

Rowe served in the House of Commons until 1962. On two occasions (1954–1955 and 1956) when Drew, who had by this point become federal PC leader, was unable to perform his duties because of ill health, Rowe served as acting leader of the official opposition. Following Drew&#x27;s resignation in September 1956, Rowe took over as interim party leader until the 1956 Progressive Conservative leadership convention. He publicly remained neutral in the contest, though quietly supported Donald Fleming&#x27;s ultimately unsuccessful campaign.

From 1958 to 1962, he and his daughter, Jean Casselman Wadds, were the only father and daughter to ever sit together in Parliament.

==Later life==
Rowe was lieutenant governor of Ontario from 1963 to 1968. A champion and supporter of agriculture and rural affairs, particularly harness horse racing, he died in 1984 at Newton Robinson, Ontario.

==Legacy==
The Honourable Earl Rowe Public School, in Bradford, Ontario, and Earl Rowe Provincial Park, near Alliston, are named in his honour.

<doc id="366505" wikidata="Q3266912" url="?curid=366505" title="The Brian Setzer Orchestra">
<text>The Brian Setzer Orchestra (sometimes known by its initials BSO) is a swing and jump blues band formed in 1992 by Stray Cats frontman Brian Setzer. In 1998, for their breakout album &quot;The Dirty Boogie&quot;, the group covered Louis Prima&#x27;s &quot;Jump, Jive an&#x27; Wail&quot;, which originally appeared on Prima&#x27;s 1957 album &quot;The Wildest!&quot;. The BSO&#x27;s follow up single, appearing on the album &quot;Vavoom!&quot;, was &quot;Gettin&#x27; in the Mood.&quot;

==History==
Setzer grew up in Long Island, New York. In his youth, he played the euphonium and other brass instruments in school jazz bands. In the 1970s, he found ways to hear jazz and big band music at the Village Vanguard, but he was also drawn to blues, rock, punk, and rockabilly. He admired the jump blues of Louis Prima and Big Joe Turner, but also the rock and roll of Elvis Presley, Eddie Cochran, Gene Vincent, and Carl Perkins.

During the early 1980s, he led the rockabilly trio the Stray Cats and found popular and commercial success. After the band broke up, Setzer worked as a side man and on a solo career. In 1994, he released the debut album of the Brian Setzer Orchestra, which combined his rockabilly style with swing, big band, and jump blues. The orchestra had a hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; singles chart with its cover version of &quot;Jump, Jive an&#x27; Wail&quot; by Louis Prima.

==Activities==
The BSO often plays during the December holidays covering Christmas songs, and plays the Rockefeller Center tree-lighting ceremony. Setzer tunes have been used in commercials.

The Brian Setzer Orchestra performed 36 concerts on their &quot;Christmas Rocks! 2017&quot; tour which ran from November to December 2017.

<text>Sheffield City Hall is a Grade II* listed building in Sheffield, England in Barker&#x27;s Pool, one of the city&#x27;s central squares. It was built and is owned by Sheffield City Council.

==History==
The building was designed in 1920 by E. Vincent Harris but construction was delayed for 8 years because of the economic climate in the early 1920s. Eventually construction began with the laying of the foundation stone on 27 June 1929 and, after the works has been undertaken by the local contractor, George Longden &amp; Son, the City Hall was officially opened on 22 September 1932. It was originally proposed in 1916 as a Memorial Hall to commemorate the dead of the Great War, but by the time of completion the name had changed to Sheffield City Hall, after some years of controversy.

During the Second World War, a bomb exploded in Barkers Pool, damaging the building&#x27;s pillars. The scars of the explosion can still be seen. In 2005, the City Hall and its surroundings were refurbished and re-developed at a cost of £12.5 million.

It is currently managed by the Sheffield City Trust under a 99-year lease and is operated by Sheffield International Venues as a venue for concerts and other events in its various rooms. However in July 2024, it was announced that due to financial pressures, the venue is due to be taken over by ASM Global in January 2025.

==Concerts and performers==

In 1932 the famous violinist Yehudi Menuhin performed at the City Hall.

In the late 1940s and early 1950s the Hallé gave regular concerts on Saturday evenings. These &quot;Hallé Concerts&quot; were often conducted by the orchestra&#x27;s principal conductor Sir John Barbirolli.

Other performers at the City Hall included the American singer/pianist Nat King Cole in April 1954 and the American singer/trumpeter, Louis Armstrong in March 1959. The Beatles performed in March/May 1963 and November 1964. 

Later performers have included the progressive rock band, The Nice, in 1969, the singer/pianist/composer, Elton John, in December 1971, the rock band Bon Jovi in November 1986, the electronic band Kraftwerk in July 1991, the singer, Kylie Minogue, in November 1991 and the mezzo-soprano, Katherine Jenkins in January 2012.

==Other events==
In June 1934, Oswald Mosley and the British Union of Fascists held a rally in the Hall. In April 1951 Winston Churchill was awarded the Freedom of the City in the Hall.

==Architecture and features==
It is a building in the neo-classical style with a giant portico. The Oval Hall is the largest hall in the building, seating 2,271 people. The Grand Willis III Organ is the largest in Sheffield with over 4,037 pipes, 75 stops and four manuals. The organ sits in a chamber situated behind the large decorative grilles facing the audience. In addition to the Oval Hall, facilities include the Memorial Hall with capacity to seat 425 people and the Ballroom with capacity to seat 400 people.

A pair of four-foot high stone Art Deco lions, designed by John Hodge and each weighing 2.5 tonnes, stood at either side of the stage when the main hall first opened in 1932. They were removed in 1962 as part of a refurbishment of the City Hall, apparently because the conductor Sir Thomas Beecham, found them distracting. They were acquired by Tarmac Group for use at their offices at John Hadfield House in Matlock and later removed to their offices in Ettingshall (a district of Wolverhampton) in 1997 before being returned to the foyer of the City Hall, as part of the building&#x27;s 85th anniversary celebrations, in October 2017.

<text>Attercliffe Chapel, also known as the Hill Top Chapel, is a Gothic chapel in Attercliffe, now a suburb of Sheffield, South Yorkshire, England. The chapel was constructed in 1629, when Attercliffe was a township separate from Sheffield, although in the same parish. Consecration took place on St. Matthias&#x27; day, 24 February 1630.

By the 1840s, the chapel was used only for funeral services.
The chapel, surrounded by its cemetery, and lying on the south bank of the River Don, was largely rebuilt in 1909, but retains its period atmosphere. It is Grade II listed.

As of 2014, the Sheffield congregation of this Presbyterian Church began meeting at the chapel.

==Famous interments==
* Benjamin Huntsman, inventor
* William Staniforth, surgeon

==In popular culture==
The exterior of the chapel was a location used in the music video for Cabaret Voltaire&#x27;s single &quot;Sensoria&quot;. The video was directed by Peter Care and released in 1984.

<doc id="366512" wikidata="Q977409" url="?curid=366512" title="Cathedral Church of St Marie, Sheffield">
<text>The Cathedral Church of St Marie is the Roman Catholic cathedral in Sheffield, England. It lies in a slightly hidden location, just off Fargate shopping street, but signals its presence with a spire, the tallest in Sheffield. It is a notable example of an English Roman Catholic cathedral, with much fine interior decoration. Reordering of the sanctuary following the Second Vatican Council has been sensitive. There are several notable side altars as well as historic statues and painted tiles.

==History==
===Reformation===
Before the English Reformation the Church of England was part of the Roman Catholic Church and Sheffield&#x27;s medieval parish church of St Peter (now the Cathedral Church of Saint Peter and Saint Paul) was the principal Catholic church in the district. In 1534, during the reign of Henry VIII, the Church of England separated from Rome and Catholic worship was outlawed. Until the 18th century, Catholics faced fines, loss of property and social exclusion and Catholic priests were hunted down, imprisoned and martyred. The main landowners in Sheffield were the Dukes of Norfolk, and the Shrewsbury Chapel in the now Anglican parish church remained Catholic until 1933. During the reordering of St Mary&#x27;s in 1970, at the invitation of the Anglican cathedral, Mass was celebrated on the altar of the Shrewsbury Chapel once again. The altar retains its Catholic consecration crosses and relics. Mass was celebrated in a few houses of gentry in Sheffield, including in a house on Fargate that belonged to the Duke of Norfolk, which had a hidden chapel in its roof.

===Establishment of the Church of St Marie ===

The Catholic Emancipation of the late 18th and early 19th centuries allowed Catholics to worship more openly. Sheffield Catholics bought the ageing house which stood on the corner of Fargate and Norfolk Row. They built a small chapel in its back garden on a site which is now between the mortuary and the Blessed Sacrament chapels. The names of the priests who served Sheffield before the cathedral was built and the dates of their deaths are on the wall of the Mortuary Chapel. The rest of the land where the cathedral now stands became a cemetery. (Bodies from the cemetery were moved to the new Catholic cemetery at St Bede&#x27;s in Rotherham and work on St Marie&#x27;s began.) By 1846 the chapel was too small and the young priest, Fr Pratt, was keen to build a church for the expanding town. A leading local architect, Matthew Ellison Hadfield, designed St Marie&#x27;s based on a 14th-century church at Heckington in Lincolnshire. The church was expensively decorated with the aid of generous donations from the Duke of Norfolk, his mother and parishioners. Pratt died while the church was being built and was buried at St Bede&#x27;s. However, a stonemason who had often heard Pratt say he wanted to be buried in St Marie&#x27;s, dug up the coffin and reburied it in a tomb he had prepared near the altar. Pratt&#x27;s coffin still lies there and a plaque marks the spot, but his effigy has been moved to beneath the altar in the Mortuary chapel.

St Marie&#x27;s was completed in 1850 and opened on 11 September. Building the church cost more than £10,500 – a very large sum in those days (about £1.5 million in 2020) – and it was not until 1889 that the church was free from debt. The Parish of St Marie&#x27;s, which covered the whole of Sheffield, became part of the Diocese of Beverley in 1850, when Catholic dioceses were re-established for the first time since the English Reformation. In 1902 a new presbytery, now known as Cathedral House, was opened. During the Second World War a bomb blew out stained glass windows in the Blessed Sacrament chapel. The remaining windows were removed and stored in a shaft at Nunnery Colliery. The mine flooded during the war, the glass sunk in mud, and drawings for recreating the windows were destroyed, however it was still possible to reinstall the windows in 1947. When St Marie&#x27;s was reordered in 1970 following Vatican II, dark woodwork was removed and new lighting and benches were installed. In 1972, a new altar allowing Mass to be celebrated &quot;versus populum&quot; was consecrated by Bishop Gerald Moverley, auxiliary Bishop of Leeds. The church is a Grade II* listed building and was first listed in 1973.

On 30 May 1980 the new Diocese of Hallam was created and St Marie&#x27;s became a cathedral. Bishop Moverley was installed as its first bishop and served until his death in 1996, after which Bishop John Rawsthorne became the second Bishop of Hallam.

An extensive programme of renovations caused the cathedral to close in September 2011, reopening in November 2012. During that time the sanctuary was extended into the crossing and reordered, a new cathedra was installed and the choir moved to the west end of the building. Side chapels and roofing was restored, in some cases revealing original features previously hidden. New heating and toilet facilities have also been installed. During the restoration process, a collection of Nottingham alabaster carvings, mostly originating from the 15th century, were discovered and also underwent extensive restoration, finally going on display in the cathedral cloisters in April 2017.

Following the reopening in November 2012, Bishop Rawsthorne retired at the age of 78. In July 2014, Bishop Ralph Heskett was installed as the third Bishop of Hallam.
The cathedral is one of few Catholic churches equipped for change ringing. It has eight bells in the ring and an Angelus bell. The main ring is by Mears &amp; Stainbank from 1874, the Angelus being an earlier 1850 Charles &amp; George Mears. Steel bells were first installed in 1861, before being replaced with bronze ones in 1874.

In recent years, the cathedral has been developed as a place of significant public interest, and as an especially fine concert venue, having hosted many of the finest choral ensembles in the world.

<text>The Luo (also spelled Lwo) are several ethnically and linguistically related Nilotic ethnic groups that inhabit an area ranging from Egypt and Sudan to South Sudan and Ethiopia, through Northern Uganda and eastern Congo (DRC), into western Kenya, and the Mara Region of Tanzania. Their Luo languages belong to the western branch of the Nilotic language family.

The Luo groups in South Sudan include the Shilluk, Anuak, Pari, Acholi, Balanda Boor, Thuri and Luwo. Those in Uganda include the Alur, Acholi, Jonam and Padhola. The ones in Kenya and Tanzania are the Joluo (also called Luo in Kenyan English).

The Joluo and their language Dholuo are also known as the &quot;Luo proper&quot; by Kenya based observers, even though their dialect has more Bantu loan words than the rest.
The level of historical separation between these groups is estimated at eight centuries. Dispersion from an alleged Nilotic core region in South Sudan is presumed to have been triggered by the turmoil of the Muslim conquest of Sudan. The migration of individual groups over the last few centuries can to some extent be traced in the respective group&#x27;s oral history.

==Origins in South Sudan==

The Luo are part of the Nilotic group of people. The Nilotes had separated from the other members of the East Sudanic family by about the 3rd millennium BC. Within Nilotic, Luo forms part of the Western group.

Within Luo, a Northern and a Southern group is distinguished. Dholuo is part of the Southern Luo group. Northern Luo is mostly spoken in South Sudan, while Southern Luo groups migrated south from the Bahr el Ghazal area in the early centuries of the second millennium AD (about eight hundred years ago).

A further division within the Northern Luo is recorded in a &quot;widespread tradition&quot; in Luo oral history: the foundational figure of the Shilluk (or Chollo) nation was a chief named &quot;Nyikango&quot;, dated to about the mid-15th century. After a quarrel with his brother, he moved northward along the Nile and established a feudal society. The Pari people descend from the group that rejected Nyikango.

==Ethiopia==

The Anuak are a Luo people whose villages are scattered along the banks and rivers of the southwestern area of Ethiopia, with others living directly across the border in South Sudan. The name of these people is also spelled Anyuak, Agnwak, and Anywaa. The Anuak of South Sudan lives in a grassy region that is flat and virtually treeless. During the rainy season, this area floods, so that much of it becomes swampland with various channels of deep water running through it.

The Anuak who live in the lowlands of Gambela are Luo people. These have accused the current Ethiopian government of encroachment. The government&#x27;s oppression has affected the Anuak&#x27;s access to education, health care, and other basic services, as well as limiting opportunities for the development of the area.

The Acholi also spelt Acoli, another Luo people in South Sudan, occupy what is now called Magwi County in Eastern Equatorial State. They border the Uganda Acoli of Northern Uganda. The South Sudan Acholi numbered about 10,000 on the 2008 population Census.

==Uganda==

In the 1500s, a small group of Luo known as the Biito-Luo (Paluo), led by Labongo encountered Bantu-speaking peoples living in the area of Bunyoro. These Luo settled with the Bantu and established the Babiito dynasty, replacing the Bachwezi dynasty of the Empire of Kitara. According to the legends, Isingoma Mpuga Rukidi (Grandson to Labongo), the first in the line of the Babiito kings of Bunyoro-Kitara, was the twin brother of Kato Kimera, the first king of Buganda. These Luo were assimilated into the Bantu&#x27;s society and lost their language and culture.

Later in the 18th century, other Luo-speaking people moved to the area that encompasses present-day South Sudan, Northern Uganda, and North-Eastern Congo (DRC) – forming the Alur, Jonam and Acholi.

Between the middle of the 16th century and the beginning of the 17th century, some Luo groups proceeded eastwards. One group called Padhola (or &quot;Jopadhola&quot; - people of Adhola), led by a chief called Adhola, settled in Budama in Eastern Uganda. They settled in a thickly forested area as a defence against attacks from Bantu neighbours who had already settled there. This self-imposed isolation helped them maintain their language and culture amidst Bantu and Ateker communities.

Those who went further a field were the Jo k&#x27;Ajok and Jo k&#x27;Owiny. The Ajok Luo moved deeper into the Kavirondo Gulf; their descendants are the present-day Jo Kisumo and Jo Karachuonyo amongst others. Jo k&#x27;Owiny occupied an area near Got Ramogi or Ramogi hill in Alego of Siaya district. The Owiny&#x27;s ruins are still identifiable to this day at Bungu Owiny near Lake Kanyaboli.

The other notable Luo group is the Omolo Luo who inhabited Ugenya and Gem areas of Siaya district. The last immigrants were the Jo Kager, who are related to the Omollo Luo. Their leader Ochieng Waljak Ger used his advanced military skill to drive away the Omiya or Bantu groups, who were then living in present-day Ugenya around 1750AD.

==Kenya and Tanzania==


Between about 1500 and 1800, other Luo groups crossed into present-day Kenya and eventually into present-day Tanzania. They inhabited the area on the banks of Lake Victoria. According to the Joluo, a warrior chief named Ramogi Ajwang led them into present-day Kenya about 500 years ago.

As in Uganda, some non-Luo people in Kenya have adopted Luo languages. A majority of the Bantu Suba people in Kenya speak Dholuo as a first language and have largely been assimilated.

The Luo in Kenya, who call themselves &quot;Joluo&quot; (&quot;people of Luo&quot;), are the fourth largest community in Kenya after the Kikuyu, Luhya and Kalenjin. In 2017 their population was estimated to be 6.1 million. In Tanzania they numbered (in 2010) an estimated 1,980,000 . The Luo in Kenya and Tanzania call their language Dholuo, which is mutually intelligible (to varying degrees) with the languages of the Alur, Acoli, and Padhola of Uganda, South Sudan and Jo Nam or Alur of Congo.

The Luo (or Joluo) are traditional fishermen and practice fishing as their main economic activity. Other cultural activities included wrestling (yii or dhao) for the young boys aged 13 to 18 in their age sets. Their main rivals in the 18th century were the Lango, the Highland Nilotes, who traditionally engaged them in fierce bloody battles, most of which emanated from the stealing of their livestock.

The Luo people of Kenya are nilotes and are related to the Nilotic people. The Luo people of Kenya are the fourth largest community in Kenya after the Kikuyu and, together with their brethren in Tanzania, form the largest single ethnic group in East Africa.

This includes peoples who share Luo ancestry and/or speak a Luo language.

<text>Gaetano Bresci (; 11 November 186922 May 1901) was an Italian anarchist who assassinated the king Umberto I of Italy. As a young weaver, his experiences with exploitation in the workplace drew him to anarchism. Bresci emigrated to the United States, where he became involved with other Italian immigrant anarchists in Paterson, New Jersey. News of the Bava Beccaris massacre motivated him to return to Italy, where he planned to assassinate Umberto. Local police knew of his return but did not mobilize. Bresci killed the king in July 1900 during Umberto&#x27;s scheduled appearance in Monza amid a sparse police presence.

The government of Italy suspected that Bresci had been a part of a conspiracy but no evidence was found, indicating that Bresci had acted alone. He was consequently sentenced to life imprisonment for murder and confined on Santo Stefano Island in Latina, Lazio, where he was found dead of an apparent suicide within the year. After his death, Bresci gained the status of a martyr within the Italian anarchist movement, who defended his regicidal act. Bresci inspired some anarchists to carry out their own acts of propaganda by deed, most prominently Leon Czolgosz&#x27;s assassination of United States president William McKinley. Italian anarchists erected a monument to Bresci in Carrara despite governmental attempts to block it.

== Early life ==
On 11 November 1869, Gaetano Bresci was born into a lower middle-class family in Prato, Tuscany. His parents owned a small amount of land in , where they farmed wheat, grapes and olives. In 1880, the Kingdom of Italy began importing cheap grain from the United States, which economically devastated small farmers like the Brescis. As the price of grain fell, the family fell into poverty and Gaetano himself started working to support his family&#x27;s income. Before long, he came to blame the Italian state for his family&#x27;s experiences with poverty. At a young age, Bresci began an apprenticeship at a textile factory, qualifying to work as a silk weaver by the age of 15.

Bresci was radicalized by his experiences of exploitation in the workplace, and he joined the Italian anarchist movement. On 3 October 1892, Bresci and a group of about twenty anarchists confronted two police officers that had given a young worker a citation for not closing his butcher shop on time. Armed police dispersed the group and Bresci was later arrested for the act. On 27 December 1892, he was tried and found guilty of insulting the police. He was sentenced to 15 days in prison, and was subsequently marked in police files as a &quot;dangerous anarchist&quot;.

Bresci was arrested again in 1895 after organising a textile workers&#x27; strike, for which he was exiled to Lampedusa by the government of Francesco Crispi. During his on the island, Bresci studied anarchist literature and became further radicalized. Bresci was granted amnesty in 1896 and returned to the mainland, where he went back to work in a wool factory. He developed a reputation as a dandy and engaged in numerous affairs, possibly fathering a child with one of his co-workers.

In 1897, Bresci immigrated to the United States. From New York City, Bresci moved to Hoboken, New Jersey, where he met Sophie Kneiland, an Irish-American with whom he fathered two daughters: Madeleine and Gaetanina. To support his family, Bresci spent his weekdays working as a silk weaver in Paterson, returning to Hoboken on weekends. In Paterson, Bresci quickly became involved in the local trade unions and the immigrant anarchist movement, regularly attending meetings. He briefly joined the Right to Existence Group () but left after a few months, finding the group insufficiently radical. Bresci co-founded and financially supported its newspaper, &quot;La Questione Sociale&quot;, for which he became a prolific &quot;firebrand&quot; contributor. At one of the group&#x27;s meetings, Bresci reportedly saved the life of Errico Malatesta, when he disarmed a disgruntled individualist anarchist who had shot Malatesta.

== Assassination of Umberto I ==

In 1898, Bresci received news of the Bava Beccaris massacre. Protests in Milan against the rising price of bread, in which men, women and children participated, had been violently suppressed by the Royal Italian Army, which fired on and killed many of the protestors. Bresci swore revenge against the king, Umberto I of Italy, who he held personally responsible for the massacre, as he had decreed a state of siege in Milan and awarded Fiorenzo Bava Beccaris, the general who ordered the shooting. 

With money from &quot;La Questione Sociale&quot;, Bresci bought a .32 S&amp;W revolver and a one-way ticket back to Europe. They respectively cost him $7 () and $27 (), with the latter discounted for the occasion of the 1900 Paris Exposition. Before leaving, he told his wife that he was returning to resolve his deceased parents&#x27; estate. Bresci set sail in May 1900, disembarking at Le Havre and briefly staying in Paris, before leaving for Italy. In June 1900, Bresci returned to his home city of Prato, where he stayed with his brother&#x27;s family. Although the local police chief was aware of Bresci&#x27;s presence and knew that police records had listed him as a &quot;dangerous anarchist&quot;, the chief did not follow procedure of informing Italy&#x27;s Ministry of the Interior or retaining Bresci&#x27;s passport. Unsurveilled, Bresci was free to practice firing his revolver daily.

In July 1900, Bresci visited his sister in Castel San Pietro Terme, before moving on to Milan. On 25 July, he toured Milan with his friend Luigi Granotti before traveling to Monza. Bresci learned that the King of Italy was due to attend a gymnastics competition at the Royal Villa of Monza. Bresci found a room near the Monza train station and waited to strike. For two days, he scouted the area and inquired about the king&#x27;s activities.
On the morning of 29 July 1900, after preparing his weapon and thoroughly grooming himself, Bresci left his hotel intent on assassinating the king at the end of the contest. He spent most of the day walking around town and eating ice cream, briefly stopping for lunch with a stranger, whom he told, &quot;Look at me carefully, because you will perhaps remember me for the rest of your life.&quot; That evening at 21:30, Umberto took his car to the stadium, where he was to hand out medals to the competition&#x27;s athletes at 22:00. There were very few law enforcement agents () stationed along the route and not enough to effectively carry out crowd control at the stadium.

Bresci had positioned himself along the road exiting the stadium to give himself a chance at escape; the excited crowd swept him within three meters of the king&#x27;s car and blocked his way out. While amongst the crowd, Bresci drew his revolver and shot Umberto three or four times. As the king lay dying, the angered crowd wrestled Bresci to the ground and a &quot;Carabinieri&quot; marshal intervened before Bresci could be lynched. He accepted arrest without resistance, declaring: &quot;I did not kill Umberto. I have killed the King. I killed a principle.&quot;

== Trial and conviction ==

A month after the assassination, Bresci was tried, convicted, and sentenced on 30 August 1900, a single day. His lawyer, Francesco Saverio Merlino, argued that the idolization of kings had weakened Italy and that the criminalization of the anarchist movement had directly led to Umberto&#x27;s assassination. He proposed that the decriminalization of radical ideologies and the resumption of civil liberties would put an end to propaganda of the deed, the anarchist practice of political assassination. Bresci&#x27;s character was further defended by his old foreman, a long-time co-worker, and his own wife, who herself expressed surprise that her husband could have committed the assassination. Examinations by the Italian criminologist Cesare Lombroso found no evidence of mental illness and the prosecution was thus unable to establish criminal insanity.

The government of Italy assumed Bresci had acted as part of a conspiracy. The then Interior minister Giovanni Giolitti was convinced the assassination had been plotted by Paterson anarchists such as Errico Malatesta together with the exiled Neapolitan Queen Maria Sophie of Bavaria, whom Giolitti alleged was planning to return to power in Italy. Another popular conspiracy theory asserted that Giuseppe Ciancabilla had originally been selected as the assassin by a revolutionary committee in London but was replaced by Bresci after he got into a conflict with Malatesta over the editorship of &quot;La Questione Sociale&quot;. In the investigation that ensued after Bresci&#x27;s trial, eleven associates of Bresci – including his brother, travel companions, and epistolary partners – were arrested and held in solitary confinement under suspicion of collaborating on the assassination. They were finally released the following year, when the Milan appellate court found insufficient evidence of their involvement and dropped the charges. Further investigations in the United States likewise found no evidence of a conspiracy by Paterson anarchists to assassinate Umberto. The Italian diplomats and Saverio Fava were themselves left thoroughly dissatisfied with the &quot;worthless&quot; investigations conducted by the New York City Police Department, United States Secret Service, and the Pinkerton detective agency.
Bresci himself was convicted of murder and sentenced to life imprisonment, the most severe punishment available, as Italy had already abolished the death penalty. Bresci was initially held in Milan&#x27;s San Vittore Prison, then transferred to a prison in Elba, where he was illegally held in an underground cell below sea level. Fears of news leaking about the conditions of his imprisonment, combined with unrest among Bresci&#x27;s supporters in the prison, resulted in him being transferred again on 23 January 1901. He was moved to solitary confinement on the remote Santo Stefano Island, where he was held in a small, unfurnished cell, with his feet shackled. 

Bresci was only allowed to keep a few personal items, such as clothing and hairstyling tools. His daily rations consisted largely of soup and bread, with meat being saved for Sundays and public holidays, and occasional wine and cheese bought with money sent by his wife. For one hour of each day, he was permitted to exercise in the corridor outside his cell. The rest of his time was spent in solitary confinement, away from other prisoners and prohibited from receiving visitors, with even his own guards being forbidden from speaking to him. To keep himself entertained, he used a napkin as a makeshift football and read from a French dictionary. Bresci reportedly remained in high spirits throughout his time in prison, which the prison authorities reported was due to his belief that he would be freed from prison in an imminent revolution. By May 1901, Giolitti himself began to fear that Bresci&#x27;s conspirators were planning to break him out of prison. To deter such a plot, Giolitti deployed an armed force to guard the island.

== Death ==

On 22 May 1901, Bresci was found hanging by the neck in his cell. &quot;Vengeance&quot; had been carved into the wall. With his cell under constant surveillance, Bresci had apparently hanged himself while one of his guards was asleep and the other was using the toilet. The prison director reported that Bresci had hanged himself from his cell window using a towel – which prisoners were prohibited from possessing – knotted to the collar of his jacket. All this occurred at a time that Bresci was awaiting the results of an appeal to Italy&#x27;s Supreme Court of Cassation. He also left wine and cheese uneaten, which he had reportedly purchased that morning. 

Upon receiving word of Bresci&#x27;s death, Giolitti immediately dispatched a prison inspector to Santo Stefano, where he reportedly arrived late on the night of 22 May. The inspector and three physicians autopsied Bresci and confirmed that he had died of strangulation but also found that his body had undergone a level of putrefaction suggesting that he had died earlier than reported. They raised this with the prison authorities but the matter was not investigated any further. On 26 May, Bresci was buried in the prison cemetery, interred with his belongings and letters from his wife that he had not been permitted to read. &quot;The New York Times&quot; celebrated the news of Bresci&#x27;s death, while Umberto&#x27;s successor and son, Victor Emmanuel III, commented that it was &quot;perhaps the best thing that could have happened to the unhappy man&quot;.

The circumstances of Bresci&#x27;s death aroused suspicion, with a number of 21st-century historians suggesting that he was murdered. Investigations into Giolitti&#x27;s papers in the Central Archives of the State found two empty folders pertaining to Bresci, the title of the first indicated that the prison inspector had actually arrived on the island on 18 May 1901. While looking further into the case, Italian journalist Arrigo Petacco found that Bresci&#x27;s page in the Santo Stefano prison registry had been torn out.

== Legacy ==

=== Governmental and policing reforms ===
Prior to Umberto&#x27;s assassination by Bresci, the reactionary government of Luigi Pelloux had been replaced by a left-wing government under Giuseppe Saracco of the Historical Left and Italy experienced a return to democracy. Other than a series of arrests during the investigation of the case, the state repression Italian anarchists had expected in the wake of the assassination never actually manifested. Subsequent governments led by Giolitti passed a series of reforms of the Italian law enforcement apparatus, reining in police repression against striking workers. Giolitti himself downplayed or suppressed information about further violent attacks by anarchists, even omitting any mention of anarchism from his memoirs about Bresci&#x27;s assassination, which he depicted as the result of a &quot;deranged mind&quot;. Dissatisfied with the ineffectiveness of their foreign intelligence apparatus, as well as the investigations of the American authorities, the Italian government also established a new surveillance network to monitor emigrant Italian anarchists in Europe and the Americas.

Robert Gascoyne-Cecil, 3rd Marquess of Salisbury, the then British prime minister, responded to the assassination by proclaiming that European governments had been too lenient towards anarchists, whose &quot;morbid thirst for notoriety&quot; he feared presented a threat to the existence of civilization. Switzerland passed a new law that punished expressions of support for crimes committed by anarchists, imprisoning Luigi Bertoni under this law after he publicly praised Bresci&#x27;s actions. European governments that had participated in the International Conference of Rome for the Social Defense Against Anarchists also attempted to appeal to the United States government, calling for it to surveil the American anarchist movement and suppress the radical press. The United States State Department, without a federal law enforcement agency, responded that it lacked the means to carry out such an operation. Bresci&#x27;s assassination of Umberto nevertheless contributed to a rising climate of xenophobia and anti-anarchist sentiment in the United States, culminating in the passage of the Immigration Act of 1903.

=== Regard in left-wing circles ===

Although the assassination was condemned by some anarchists, including Errico Malatesta, who rejected revenge killings and worried it might harm the anarchist cause, it was praised by others. The assassination quickly became a cornerstone of Italian left-wing counterculture, and anarchists came to regard Bresci as a martyr. The American anarchist newspaper &quot;Free Society&quot; stated that anarchists regarded Bresci&#x27;s actions with &quot;unqualified approval&quot;. In its ode to Bresci, the paper described him as a &quot;kind hearted and humane man&quot; who had resolved to kill the &quot;tyran[t]&quot; Umberto, not as a representative of an organization but in an individual act of revenge for the &quot;great suffering and misery caused by the oppressive measures of the Italian government&quot;. Bresci was praised in the same paper by Emma Goldman, who said he had &quot;loved his kind, felt the existing wrongs in the world, and dared to strike a blow at organized authority&quot;. She described him as having had &quot;overflowing sympathy with human suffering&quot;, and declared his assassination of Umberto to have been &quot;good and noble, grand and useful&quot;, as she believed he had intended it to help &quot;free mankind from tyranny&quot;.

On Italian anarchist postcards, Bresci&#x27;s face was superimposed onto the Statue of Liberty, and his deeds were eulogized in a poem by the American anarchist Voltairine de Cleyre and in Italian revolutionary music. Paterson itself became known as the &quot;capital of world anarchism&quot; after Bresci&#x27;s assassination of Umberto. Although Bresci&#x27;s wife did not know about her husband&#x27;s plan to assassinate Umberto, or even what anarchism entailed, she was routinely surveilled by the police and harassed by members of her own community, forcing her to move to Chicago. When the Italian monarchist newspaper &quot;L&#x27;Araldo Italiano&quot; raised one thousand dollars to decorate Umberto&#x27;s tomb, the Paterson anarchists quickly matched the amount to support Bresci&#x27;s widow and two daughters, despite police harassment at their fundraising events. Luigi Galleani was accused of embezzling funds raised for Bresci&#x27;s children, but he denied the charges and published letters from Sophia Bresci and the benefit fund&#x27;s organizer attesting to his innocence.

A Roman Catholic priest was imprisoned for declaring his support for Bresci&#x27;s actions, which he characterized as &quot;an instrument of divine vengeance against a dynasty [the House of Savoy] that had deprived the Popes of their temporal power.&quot; In 1910, when he was still a member of the Italian Socialist Party, the future Italian fascist dictator Benito Mussolini praised Bresci in the pages of the socialist newspaper &quot;Lotta di Classe&quot;.

=== Further assassinations and attempts ===
Shortly after Umberto&#x27;s death, the French anarchist François Salson attempted to assassinate the Persian king Mozaffar ad-Din Shah Qajar in Paris. Although Salson himself never disclosed his motives, international newspapers (including &quot;Corriere della Sera&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, and the &quot;New York Herald&quot;) all claimed that the attempt had been directly inspired by Bresci&#x27;s actions. Print media also linked Bresci&#x27;s actions with those of Belgian anarchist Jean-Baptiste Sipido (who attempted to assassinate the British Prince of Wales--later Edward VII) and Italian anarchist Luigi Lucheni (who had assassinated Empress Elisabeth of Austria). Bresci and Lucheni shared little motive in common; Lucheni himself later expressed his admiration for Bresci&#x27;s actions.
The assassination directly inspired the Polish-American anarchist Leon Czolgosz. According to his parents, Czolgosz obsessively read newspaper accounts of the assassination, keeping a newspaper clipping with him for months and reading it in bed each night. In May 1901, he inquired for information from an anarchist group in Cleveland about newspaper stories that American anarchists were plotting a similar assassination but the group&#x27;s treasurer denied the rumors. In early September, Czolgosz read an article in &quot;Free Society&quot; which exalted &quot;monster-slayers&quot; such as Bresci. This ultimately drove him to carry out the assassination of the then United States president William McKinley. In the wake of this assassination, mounting public pressure and police surveillance forced Bresci&#x27;s family to flee their home in Cliffside Park, New Jersey. 

Bresci and Czolgosz would later be a source of inspiration for the insurrectionary anarchist Luigi Galleani, who praised their actions in his newspaper &quot;Cronaca Sovversiva&quot;. In 1911, Italian anarchists inspired by Bresci planned to assassinate Victor Emanuele III and Giolitti at the Turin International but were arrested before they could carry out their attack. Italian anarchists from Paterson and New York established groups in Bresci&#x27;s name, while a group in Pittsburgh named themselves in the &quot;Twenty-Ninth of July&quot; group, in reference to the date of Umberto&#x27;s assassination. By 1914, the New York-based Bresci Circle had reached 600 members, who met frequently on East Harlem&#x27;s 106th Street. The group was implicated in a plot to assassinate John D. Rockefeller, the richest person of the &quot;fin de siècle&quot; era. The following year, the group was infiltrated by an undercover operation and two of its members were convicted of plotting to bomb St. Patrick&#x27;s Cathedral in Manhattan. The group was also suspected of involvement in the 1919 United States anarchist bombings, and finally disbanded during the Palmer Raids. Bresci&#x27;s example, along with that of the anarchist assassins Émile Henry, Michele Angiolillo and Paulí Pallàs, was later invoked by Nicola Sacco when he was on death row.

=== Contemporary commemorations ===
In 1976, a street in Bresci&#x27;s home town of Prato was named after him. During the 1980s, Tuscan anarchists commissioned a monument to Bresci to be erected in Turigliano, near Carrara; it was blocked by the government. In July 1986, the Italian Communist Party-controlled municipal council voted to allow the anarchists space in the to construct their monument to Bresci to the protest of monarchist activists and the then interior minister Oscar Luigi Scalfaro. Court proceedings were initiated against members of the council and of the &quot;Bresci committee&quot; but were all acquitted, as the proposed monument&#x27;s inscription did not mention the assassination of Umberto. In 1990, it was erected overnight in the cemetery by Ugo Mazzucchelli, who turned himself in afterwards. In response, the then mayor declared that the council&#x27;s resolution to allow the monument was still valid. Victor Emanuele III commissioned the Expiatory Chapel of Monza to commemorate the place where his father Umberto had been assassinated. In 2013, Bresci&#x27;s name was adopted by a short-lived occupied social centre in Catania, and his name was referenced in the 2016 film &quot;Paterson&quot;.
