<text>The culture of the Philippines is characterized by great ethnic diversity. Although the multiple ethnic groups of the Philippine archipelago have only recently established a shared Filipino national identity, their cultures were all shaped by the geography and history of the region, and by centuries of interaction with neighboring cultures, and colonial powers. In more recent times, Filipino culture has also been influenced through its participation in the global community.

==History==

Among the contemporary ethnic groups of the Philippine archipelago, the Negritos are generally considered the earliest settlers; today, although few in numbers, they preserve a very traditional way of life and culture. After those early settlers, the Austronesians arrived on the archipelago. The Austronesian culture is strongly evident in the ethnic majority and languages.

Before the arrival of European colonizers in the 1500s, the various ethnic groups of the Philippines were organized into various independent polities, which historians have come to call &quot;barangays&quot;. These polities consisted of about thirty to a hundred households, and were ruled by leaders with titles. The largest of these, such as Butuan, Tondo and the Sultanate of Sulu were complex political formations based on the deltas of the archipelago&#x27;s biggest river systems, with political and trade relationships with polities further upstream on one hand, and with the political and trading powers of Maritime Southeast Asia and East Asia such as the Sultanate of Brunei, the Majapahit empire, the Qing and Ming Dynasties of China, and even Japan. Indirect cultural exchange and some trade also took place with the Indian subcontinent and Arabia.

The advent of Spanish colonial rule in the islands marked the beginning of the Philippines as an entity, a collection of Southeast Asian countries united under the Spanish Empire. The empire ruled, via the Viceroyalty of New Spain and later directly from Madrid (after 1821 Mexican independence), the islands between the 16th and 19th centuries (Batanes being one of the last places to be colonized in the mid-1800s), resulting in Christianity to spread and dominate throughout the archipelago and influenced the religion and beliefs of the natives. Then, the Philippines became a U.S. territory for almost 50 years. Influence from the United States is manifested in the wide use of the English language, media and in the modern culture and clothing of present-day Philippines.

==Geography and ethnic groups==

The Philippines&#x27; culture is shaped by its archipelagic geography, topography and physical location within Maritime Southeast Asia, all of which defined the cultural histories of the country&#x27;s 175 Ethnolinguistic groups.

=== Influence of geography ===
The cultural diversity of the Philippines is the result of the country&#x27;s archipelagic nature. The Philippines, as the world&#x27;s fifth largest island country, is one of the five original archipelagic states recognized under the United Nations Convention on the Law of the Sea (UNCLOS). Its 7,641 islands have a total land area of ; its exclusive economic zone—covering an area from its islands&#x27; shores—encompasses of sea. Maritime and river transport allowed cultural exchanges between the country&#x27;s diverse ethnic groups who settled on various islands within the archipelago; inland mountain ranges, on the other hand, were a major hindrance to cultural linkages between various groups.

=== Ethnic groups of the Philippines ===
The Philippines is inhabited by more than 182 ethnolinguistic groups, many of which are classified as &quot;Indigenous Peoples&quot; under the country&#x27;s Indigenous Peoples&#x27; Rights Act of 1997. Traditionally-Muslim peoples from the southernmost island group of Mindanao are usually categorized together as Moro peoples, whether they are classified as Indigenous peoples or not. About 142 are classified as non-Muslim Indigenous People groups, and about 19 ethnolinguistic groups are classified as neither indigenous nor moro. Various migrant groups have also had a significant presence throughout the country&#x27;s history.

The Muslim-majority ethnic groups ethnolinguistic groups of Mindanao, Sulu, and Palawan are collectively referred to as the Moro people, a broad category which includes some indigenous people groups and some non-indigenous people groups.

About 142 of the Philippines&#x27; Indigenous People groups are not classified as moro peoples. Some of these people groups are commonly grouped together due to their strongly association with a shared geographic area, although these broad categorizations are not always welcomed by the ethnic groups themselves. For example, the indigenous peoples of the Cordillera Mountain Range in northern Luzon have often been referred to using the exonym &quot;Igorot people,&quot; and as the Cordilleran peoples. Meanwhile, the non-Moro peoples of Mindanao are collectively referred to as the Lumad, a collective autonym conceived in 1986 as a way to distinguish them from their neighboring indigenous Moro neighbors.

About 86 to 87 percent of the Philippine population belong to the 19 ethnolinguistic groups are classified as neither indigenous nor moro. known simply as Filipinos, these groups are sometimes collectively referred to as &quot;Lowland Christianized groups&quot; to distinguish them from the other ethnolinguistic groups. The most populous of these groups, with populations exceeding a million individuals, are the Ilocano, the Pangasinense, the Kapampangan, the Tagalog, the Ivatan, the Cuyonon, the Bicolano, the Visayans (Cebuanos, Boholano, the Hiligaynon/Ilonggo, and Waray) and many more. These groups converted to Christianity and was part of the Spanish empire, particularly both the native and migrant lowland-coastal groups, and adopted foreign elements of culture throughout the country&#x27;s history.

Due to the history of the Philippines since the Spanish colonial era, there are also some historical migrant heritage groups within the lowland Filipino populations such as the Chinese Filipinos and Spanish Filipinos, both of whom intermixed with the above lowland Austronesian-speaking ethnic groups, which produced Filipino Mestizos. These groups also comprise and contribute a considerable proportion of the country&#x27;s population, especially its bourgeois, and economy and were integral to the establishment of the country, from the rise of Filipino nationalism by the &quot;Ilustrado&quot; intelligentsia to the Philippine Revolution. Other peoples of migrant and/or mixed descent include those such as, American Filipinos, Indian Filipinos, Japanese Filipinos, and many more.

== Filipino psychology ==

A formal field interpreting Psychology as rooted on the experience, ideas, and cultural orientation of the Filipinos, called Filipino psychology, was established in 1975.

=== Values ===

As a general description, the distinct value system of Filipinos is rooted primarily in personal alliance systems, especially those based in kinship, obligation, friendship, religion (particularly Christianity), and commercial relationships.

Filipino values are, for the most part, centered around maintaining social harmony, motivated primarily by the desire to be accepted within a group. The main sanction against diverging from these values are the concepts of &quot;&quot;Hiya&quot;, roughly translated as &#x27;a sense of shame&#x27;, and &quot;Amor propio&quot;&quot; or &#x27;self-esteem&#x27;. Social approval, acceptance by a group, and belonging to a group are major concerns. Caring about what others will think, say or do, are strong influences on social behavior among Filipinos.

Other elements of the Filipino value system are optimism about the future, pessimism about present situations and events, concern and care for other people, the existence of friendship and friendliness, the habit of being hospitable, religious nature, respectfulness to self and others, respect for the female members of society, the fear of God, and abhorrence of acts of cheating people financially and thievery.

===Architecture===


Before the arrival of European colonizers, Austronesian architecture was the common form of housing on the archipelago.

During the Spanish era, the new Christianized lowland culture collectively evolved a new style known as the Nipa hut (&quot;Bahay Kubo&quot;). It is characterized by use of simple materials such as bamboo and coconut as the main sources of wood. Cogon grass, Nipa palm leaves and coconut fronds are used as roof thatching. Most primitive homes are built on stilts due to frequent flooding during the rainy seasons. Regional variations include the use of thicker, and denser roof thatching in mountain areas, or longer stilts on coastal areas particularly if the structure is built over water. The architecture of other indigenous peoples may be characterized by an angular wooden roofs, bamboo in place of leafy thatching and ornate wooden carvings. The Bahay na bato architecture is a variant of Nipa Hut that emerged during the Spanish era.

Spanish architecture has left an imprint in the Philippines in the way many towns were designed around a central square or &quot;plaza mayor&quot;, but many of the buildings bearing its influence were demolished during World War II. Some examples remain, mainly among the country&#x27;s churches, government buildings, and universities. Four Philippine baroque churches are included in the list of UNESCO World Heritage Sites: the San Agustín Church in Manila, Paoay Church in Ilocos Norte, Nuestra Señora de la Asunción (Santa María) Church in Ilocos Sur, and Santo Tomás de Villanueva Church in Iloilo. Vigan in Ilocos Sur is also known for the many Hispanic-style houses and buildings preserved there. The introduction of Christianity brought European churches and architecture which subsequently became the center of most towns and cities in the nation. The Spaniards also introduced stones and rocks as housing and building materials and the Filipinos merged it with their existing architecture and forms a hybrid mix-architecture only exclusive to the Philippines. Filipino colonial architecture can still be seen in centuries-old buildings such as Filipino baroque churches, Bahay na bato; houses, schools, convents, government buildings around the nation. The best collection of Spanish colonial era architecture can be found in the walled city of Intramuros in Manila and in the historic town of Vigan. Colonial-era churches are also on the best examples and legacies of Spanish Baroque architecture called Earthquake Baroque which are only found in the Philippines. Historic provinces such as Ilocos Norte and Ilocos Sur, Pangasinan, Pampanga, Bulacan, Cavite, Laguna, Rizal, Batangas, Quezon, Iloilo, Negros, Cebu, Bohol and Zamboanga del Sur also boasts colonial-era buildings.

The American occupation in 1898 introduced a new breed of architectural structures in the Philippines. This led to the construction of government buildings and Art Deco theaters. During the American period, some semblance of city planning using the architectural designs and master plans by Daniel Burnham was done on the portions of the city of Manila. Part of the Burnham plan was the construction of government buildings that resembled Greek or Neoclassical architecture. In Iloilo, a lot of the colonial edifices constructed during the American occupation in the country can still be seen. Commercial buildings, houses and churches in that era are abundant in the city and especially in Calle Real.

The University of Santo Tomas Main Building in Manila is an example of Renaissance Revival architecture. The building was built in 1924 and was completed at 1927. The building, designed by Fr. Roque Ruaño, O.P., is the first earthquake-resistant building in the Philippines . Islamic and other Asian architecture can also be seen depicted on buildings such as mosques and temples. Pre-Hispanic housing is still common in rural areas. Contemporary-style housing subdivisions and suburban-gated communities are popular in urbanized places such as Metro Manila, Central Visayas, Central Luzon, Negros Island and other prosperous regions.

However, certain areas of the country like Batanes have slight differences as both Spanish and Filipino ways of architecture assimilated differently due to the climate. Limestones and coral were used as building materials.

There have been proposals to establish a policy where each municipality and city will have an ordinance mandating all constructions and reconstructions within such territory to be inclined with the municipality or city&#x27;s architecture and landscaping styles to preserve and conserve the country&#x27;s dying heritage sites, which have been demolished one at a time in a fast pace due to urbanization, culturally-irresponsible development, and lack of towns-cape architectural vision. The proposal advocates for the usage and reinterpretations of indigenous, colonial, and modern architectural and landscaping styles that are prevalent or used to be prevalent in a given city or municipality. The proposal aims to foster a renaissance in Philippine landscaping and townscaping, especially in rural areas which can easily be transformed into new architectural heritage towns within a 50-year time frame. Unfortunately, many Philippine-based architecture and engineering experts lack the sense of preserving heritage townscapes, such as the case in Manila, where business proposals to construct structures that are not inclined with Manila&#x27;s architectural styles have been continuously accepted and constructed by such experts, effectively destroying Manila&#x27;s architectural townscape one building at a time. Only the city of Vigan has passed such an ordinance, which led to its declaration as a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1999 and awarding of various recognition for the conservation and preservation of its unique architectural and landscaping styles. In 2016, bills proposing to establish a Department of Culture were filed in both chambers of Congress to help formulate policy on architecture.
===Traditional clothing===


Baro evolved from its forerunner garment worn by the Tagalogs of Luzon Prior to the Spanish Era. When the Spaniards came and settled into the islands, the fashion changed drastically as the Spanish culture influenced the succeeding centuries of Philippine history. The Spanish dissolved the kingdoms and united the country, resulting in a mixture of cultures from different ethnic groups of the conquered archipelago and Spanish culture. A new type of clothing called Barong tagalog (for men) and Baro&#x27;t saya (for women) began to emerged and would ultimately define the newly formed Filipino culture.

Throughout the 16th century up to the 18th century, women wore a more updated version of the Baro&#x27;t saya, composed of a bodice – called a Camisa, often made in pineapple fiber or muslin – and a floor length skirt, while the &quot;barong tagalog of men&quot;, was a collared and buttoned lace shirt or a suit. Aside from Barong, men also wore suits. Most Visayan lowland women wear &quot;Kimona&quot;, a type of Baro&#x27;t Saya blouse matching with a knee-length or floor-length skirt printed with the Patadyong pattern, hence getting the name &quot;Patadyong&quot; skirt. The dress is often accompanied with a handkerchief called &quot;tubao&quot; also printed with patadyong pattern and is often placed above the right shoulder. These traditions was brought by the Visayans to Mindanao where they also dominate the Christian lowland culture.

Salakot hat is a Filipino general term for a range of related traditional headgear used by virtually all ethnic groups of the Philippines and is a Filipino variation of the Asian conical hat of East and Southeast Asia. It is usually dome-shaped or cone-shaped, but various other styles also exist, including versions with dome-shaped, cone-shaped, or flat crowns with a flat or gently sloping brim. It can be made from various materials including bamboo, rattan, nito, bottle gourd, buri straw, nipa leaves, pandan leaves, carabao horn, and tortoiseshell. In addition to Salakot and western hats, Buntal hat, Buri hat and calasiao hat are another traditional hats worn by Filipinos. By the 19th century, due to the continuing influence of the Western culture, the rising economy, globalization, and exposure from the European fashion scene, the women&#x27;s clothing began to have a change; by the 1850s, women&#x27;s clothing was now full wide skirts that usually have long train rather than the simple floor length skirts, a bodice called &quot;camisa&quot; which means blouse in English and a &quot;pañuelo&quot;, The attire is composed of four pieces, namely the camisa, the saya, the pañuelo (a scarf, also spelled panuelo) and the Tapis this would later be called Maria Clara. The men also continued to wear a more intricate version barong tagalog. Underneath the transparent barong tagalog is the &quot;Camisa de Chino&quot; a type of shirt, usually in white. When the Americans arrived baro&#x27;t saya started to change again and became more modern in contrast to the conservative style. The women then wore the new version called, &quot;Traje de Mestiza&quot;, the more modern version of the Maria Clara. By the 1920s, the style of the skirt still remained, influenced by the flapper dress; however, the wide sleeves had been flattened to butterfly sleeves and the big &quot;pañuelo&quot; reduced its size.

Men wore suit and coat worn in the West, mostly Americans hence the name it was called, the &quot;Americana&quot;, It was more popularly white or light in color than western counterpart. By the 1930s, young adult women and children embraced the more American style, but the typical &quot;Traje de Mestiza&quot; was not fully gone. By 1940&#x27;s onward baro&#x27;t saya was still evolving. But people started wearing more updated modern clothing and fully turned away from baros as everyday clothing. Though it became a symbol of traditional culture to be preserved for traditional ceremonies and cultural occasions, from the modern more globalized culture of the post war era.

Cultures that are un-hispanized like the Negritos, Igorot, Lumad and Moro etc. was mostly only fully absorbed into the Filipino borders much later in history, especially during the post-war&#x27;s modern and globalized culture when the hispanized lowland Filipinos are modernized. As a result, they were mostly unaffected by the traditional lowland Christian Filipino culture and clothing. What influenced them instead was the modern culture and fashions. Though traditional clothing are retained for traditional ceremonies and cultural occasions as well.

=== Visual arts ===

Early pottery has been found in the form of mostly anthropomorphic earthenware jars dating from c. 5 BC to 225 AD. Early Philippine painting can be found in red slip (clay mixed with water) designs embellished on the ritual pottery of the Philippines such as the acclaimed Manunggul Jar. Evidence of Philippine pottery-making dated as early as 6000 BC has been found in Sanga-Sanga Cave, Sulu and Cagayan&#x27;s Laurente Cave. It has been proven that by 5000 BC, the making of pottery was practiced throughout the archipelago. Early Austronesian peoples, especially in the Philippines, started making pottery before their Cambodian neighbors, and at about the same time as the Thais and Laotians as part of what appears to be a widespread Ice Age development of pottery technology.

Further evidence of painting is manifest in the tattoo tradition of early Filipinos, whom the Portuguese explorer referred to as &quot;Pintados&quot; or the &#x27;Painted People&#x27; of the Visayas. Various designs referencing flora and fauna with heavenly bodies decorate their bodies in various colored pigmentation. Perhaps, some of the most elaborate painting done by early Filipinos that survive to the present day can be manifested among the arts and architecture of the Maranaos who are well known for the Nāga dragons and the Sarimanok carved and painted in the beautiful Panolong of their Torogan or King&#x27;s House.

Filipinos began creating paintings in the European tradition during 17th-century Spanish period. The earliest of these paintings were Church frescoes, religious imagery from Biblical sources, as well as engravings, sculptures and lithographs featuring Christian icons and European nobility. Most of the paintings and sculptures between the 19th and 20th centuries produced a mixture of religious, political, and landscape art works, with qualities of sweetness, dark, and light.

The Itneg people are known for their intricate woven fabrics. The &quot;binakol&quot; is a blanket which features designs that incorporate optical illusions.Other parts of Highlands in the Cordillera Region or in local term &quot; KaIgorotan&quot; displays their art in tattoing, weaving bags like the &quot;sangi&quot; a traditional backpack and carving woods. Woven fabrics of the Ga&#x27;dang people usually have bright red tones. Their weaving can also be identified by beaded ornamentation. Other peoples such as the Ilongot make jewelry from pearl, red hornbill beaks, plants, and metals. Many Filipino painters were influenced by this and started using materials such as extract from onion, tomato, tuba, coffee, rust, molasses and other materials available anywhere as paint.
The Lumad peoples of Mindanao such as the &quot;B&#x27;laan&quot;, Mandaya, Mansaka and T&#x27;boli are skilled in the art of dyeing abaca fiber. Abaca is a plant closely related to bananas, and its leaves are used to make fiber known as Manila hemp. The fiber is dyed by a method called &quot;ikat&quot;. &quot;Ikat&quot; fiber are woven into cloth with geometric patterns depicting human, animal and plant themes.

&quot;Kut-kut&quot;, a technique combining ancient Oriental and European art process. Considered lost art and highly collectible art form. Very few known art pieces exist today. The technique was practiced by the indigenous people of Samar Island between early 1600 and late 1800 A.D. It is an exotic Philippine art form based on early century techniques: sgraffito, encaustic and layering. The merging of the ancient styles produces a unique artwork characterized by delicate swirling interwoven lines,

Islamic art in the Philippines have two main artistic styles. One is a curved-line woodcarving and multi-layered texture and an illusion of three-dimensional space.metalworking called &quot;okir&quot;, similar to the Middle Eastern Islamic art. This style is associated with men. The other style is geometric tapestries, and is associated with women. The Tausug and Sama–Bajau exhibit their okir on elaborate markings with boat-like imagery. The Marananaos make similar carvings on housings called torogan. Weapons made by Muslim Filipinos such as the &quot;kampilan&quot; are skillfully carved.

Early modernist painters such as Haagen Hansen was associated with religious and secular paintings. The art of Lorenzo Miguelito and Alleya Espanol showed a trend for political statement. The first American national artist Jhurgen D. C. Pascua used post-modernism to produce paintings that illustrated Philippine culture, nature and harmony. While other artists such as Bea Querol used realities and abstract on his work. In the 1980s, Odd Arthur Hansen, popularly known as &quot;ama ng makabayan pintor&quot; or father of patriotic paint, gained recognition. He uses his own white hair to make his own paintbrushes and signs his painting using his own blood on the right side corner. He developed his own styles without professional training or guidance from professionals.

===Dancing===

Philippine folk dances include the Tinikling and Cariñosa. In the southern region of Mindanao, Singkil is a popular dance showcasing the story of a prince and princess in the forest. Bamboo poles are arranged in a tic-tac-toe pattern in which the dancers exploit every position of these clashing poles.

===Music===

The early music of the Philippines featured a mixture of Indigenous, Islamic and a variety of Asian sounds that flourished before the European and American colonization in the 16th and 20th centuries. Spanish settlers and Filipinos played a variety of musical instruments, including flutes, guitar, ukulele, violin, trumpets and drums. They performed songs and dances to celebrate festive occasions. By the 21st century, many of the folk songs and dances have remained intact throughout the Philippines. Some of the groups that perform these folk songs and dances are the Bayanihan, Filipinescas, Barangay-Barrio, Hariraya, the Karilagan Ensemble, and groups associated with the guilds of Manila, and Fort Santiago theatres. Many Filipino musicians have risen prominence such as the composer and conductor Antonio J. Molina, the composer Felipe P. de Leon, known for his nationalistic themes and the opera singer Jovita Fuentes.

Modern day Philippine music features several styles. Most music genres are contemporary such as Filipino rock, Filipino hip hop and other musical styles. Some are traditional such as Filipino folk music.

===Literature===

The Philippine literature is a diverse and rich group of works that has evolved throughout the centuries. It had started with traditional folktales and legends made by the ancient Filipinos before Spanish colonization. The main themes of Philippine literature focus on the country&#x27;s pre-Hispanic cultural traditions and the socio-political histories of its colonial and contemporary traditions.
The literature of the Philippines illustrates the Prehistory and European colonial legacy of the Philippines, written in both Indigenous and Hispanic writing system. Most of the traditional literatures of the Philippines were written during the Spanish period, while being preserved orally prior to Spanish colonization. Philippine literature is written in Spanish, English, or any indigenous Philippine languages.

Some well known works of literature were created in the 17th to 19th centuries. The Ibong Adarna is a famous epic about a magical bird which was claimed to be written by José de la Cruz or &quot;Huseng Sisiw&quot;. Francisco Balagtas is one of the country&#x27;s prominent Filipino poets, he is named as one of the greatest Filipino literary laureates for his contributions in Philippine literature. His greatest work, the &quot;Florante at Laura&quot; is considered as his greatest work and one of the masterpieces of Philippine literature. Balagtas wrote the epic during his imprisonment. José Rizal, the national hero of the country, wrote the novels &quot;Noli Me Tángere&quot; (&quot;Touch Me Not&quot;) and &quot;El Filibusterismo&quot; (&quot;The Filibustering&quot;, also known as &quot;The Reign of Greed&quot;). Nínay By Pedro Paterno, explores the tragic life of a female protagonist Ninay.

There have been proposals to revive all indigenous ethnic scripts or &quot;suyat&quot; in the Philippines, where the ethnic script of the ethnic majority of the student population shall be taught in public and private schools. The proposal came up after major backlash came about when a bill declaring the Tagalog baybayin as the national script of the country. The bill became controversial as it focuses only on the traditional script of the Tagalog people, while dismissing the traditional scripts of more than 100 ethnic groups in the country. The new proposal that came after the backlash cites that if the ethnic majority is Sebwano, then the script that will be taught is badlit. If the ethnic majority is Tagalog, then the script that will be taught is baybayin. If the ethnic majority is Hanunuo Mangyan, then the script that will be taught is hanunu&#x27;o, and so on.

===Cinema and media===
&quot;Salón de Pertierra&quot; was the first introduced moving picture on January 1, 1897, in the Philippines. All films were all in Spanish since Philippine cinema was first introduced during the final years of the Spanish era of the country. Antonio Ramos was the first known movie producer. He used the Lumiere Cinematograph when he filmed &quot;Panorama de Manila&quot; (Manila landscape), &quot;Fiesta de Quiapo&quot; (Quiapo Fiesta), &quot;Puente de España&quot; (Bridge of Spain), and &quot;Escenas Callejeras&quot; (Street scenes). Meanwhile, Jose Nepomuceno was dubbed as the &quot;Father of Philippine Cinema&quot;. His work marked the start of cinema as an art form in the Philippines. His first film produced was entitled &quot;Dalagang Bukid&quot; (Country Maiden) in 1919.

Film showing resumed in 1900 during the American period. Walgrah, a British entrepreneur, opened the &quot;Cine Walgrah at No. 60 Calle Santa Rosa&quot; in Intramuros. It was also during this time that a movie market was formally created in the country along with the arrival of silent movies. These silent films were always accompanied by gramophone, a piano, a quartet, or a 200-man choir. During the Japanese occupation, filmmaking was put on hold. Nonetheless, it was continued on 1930s up until 1945 replacing the Hollywood market with Japanese films but met with little success. Postwar 1940s and the 1950s were known as the first golden age of Philippine cinema with the resurgence of mostly Visayan films through Lapu-Lapu Pictures. This period also saw the rise of film legend Paraluman. Nationalistic films became popular, and movie themes consisting primarily of war and heroism and proved to be successful with Philippine audiences.
The 1950s saw the first golden age of Philippine cinema, with the emergence of more artistic and mature films, and significant improvement in cinematic techniques among filmmakers. The studio system produced frenetic activity in the Philippine film industry as many films were made annually and several local talents started to gain recognition abroad. Award-winning filmmakers and actors were first introduced during this period. As the decade drew to a close, the studio system monopoly came under siege as a result of labor-management conflicts.

During the 1960s, James Bond movies, &quot;bomba&quot; (soft porn) pictures and an era of musical films, produced mostly by Sampaguita Pictures, dominated the cinema. The second golden age occurred from the 1970s to early 1980s. It was during this era that filmmakers ceased to produce pictures in black and white. A rise in Hollywood films dominated theater sales during the late 1980s until the 2000s. The dawn of this era saw a dramatic decline of the mainstream Philippine movie industry.

The 1970s and 1980s were considered turbulent years for the Philippine film industry, bringing both positive and negative changes. The films in this period dealt with more serious topics following the Martial law era. In addition, action, western, drama, adult and comedy films developed further in picture quality, sound and writing. The 1980s brought the arrival of alternative or independent cinema in the Philippines. The 1990s saw the emerging popularity of drama, teen-oriented romantic comedy, adult, comedy and action films.

The mid-2010s also saw broader commercial success of films produced by independent studios.

The Philippines, being one of Asia&#x27;s earliest film industry producers, remains undisputed in terms of the highest level of theater admission in Asia. Over the years, however, the Philippine film industry has registered a steady decline in movie viewership from 131 million in 1996 to 63 million in 2004. From a high production rate of 350 films a year in the 1950s, and 200 films a year during the 1980s, the Philippine film industry production rate declined in 2006 to 2007. The 21st century saw the rebirth of independent filmmaking through the use of digital technology and a number of films have once again earned nationwide recognition and prestige.

With the high rates of film production in the past, several movie artists have appeared in over 100+ roles in Philippine Cinema and enjoyed great recognition from fans and moviegoers.

===Protest art===
Protest art has played an important part in Philippine history, and in the development of Philippine culture. The Propaganda Movement had been key in the formation of the Philippine national consciousness in the 19th century. In the 20th century, the proclamation of Martial law under Ferdinand Marcos - and the subsequent human rights abuses which came with it - led to the prominence of protest art in Filipino popular culture.

== Folklore ==
===Philippine mythology===
Philippine mythologies are the first literature of the Philippines, usually passed on through generation via traditional and oral folk literature. Written texts recording the stories have also been made. These literary stories are mostly chanted as part of a dynamic Philippine epic poetry. While each unique ethnic group has its own stories and myths to tell, Hindu and Spanish influences can nonetheless be detected in many cases. Philippine mythology mostly consists of creation stories or stories about supernatural creatures, such as the &quot;aswang&quot;, the &quot;manananggal&quot;, the &quot;diwata/engkanto&quot;, and nature. Some popular figures from Philippine mythologies are Makiling, Lam-Ang, and the Sarimanok.

==Religion==
===Christianity===
The arrival of the Spanish colonizers in the 16th century brought the beginning of the Christianization of the people in the Philippines. This phase in history is noted as the tipping point for the destruction of a variety of Anitist beliefs in the country, which were replaced by colonial belief systems that fitted the tastes of the Spanish, notably Christian beliefs. Christianity in form of has influenced Filipino culture in almost every facet, from visual arts, architecture, dance, and music. Presently, the Philippines is one of the two predominantly Catholic (80.58%) nations in Asia-Pacific, the other being East Timor. The country also has its own independent Philippine church, the Aglipayan, which accounts for around 2% of the national population. Other Christian churches are divided among a variety of Christian sects and cults. From the census in 2014, Christianity consisted of about 90.07% of the population and is largely present throughout the nation.

===Indigenous folk religions===

Indigenous Philippine folk religions, also referred collectively as Anitism, meaning ancestral religions, are the original faiths of the diverse ethnic groups of the Philippines. Much of the texts of the religions are stored through memory which are traditionally chanted, rather than written in manuscripts.

Written texts, however, have been utilized as well in modern times to preserve aspects of the religions, notably their stories which are important aspects of Philippine mythology and traditional rites and other practices. These stories consist of creation stories or stories about important figures such as deities and heroes and certain creatures.

Some popular, but distinct, figures include the Tagalog&#x27;s Bathala and Makiling, the Ilocano&#x27;s Lam-ang, and the Maranao&#x27;s Sarimanok.

===Islam===
Islamic mythology arrived in the Philippines in the 13th century through trade routes in Southeast Asia. The spread of Islam established a variety of belief systems, notably in the southwestern portions of the archipelago, where the sultanate system was embraced by the natives without the need for forced conversions, as the religious traders did not intended to colonize the islands. Presently, around 6% of the population are Muslims, concentrating in the Bangsamoro region in Mindanao. Most Filipino Muslims practice Sunni Islam according to the Shafi&#x27;i school.

===Others===
Hinduism arrived in the Philippines in 200–300 AD while Vajrayana Buddhism arrived around 900 AD. Most adherent of Hinduism have Indian origins while those practicing Buddhism have Chinese or Japanese origins, notably those who immigrated in the Philippines in the last few decades. Shintoism arrived prior to the 12th century due to Japanese traders, while Judaism arrived in the 16th century due to the Inquisition. Taoism is also practiced by some Chinese immigrants. Atheism is also found in the Philippines.

==Cuisine==

Filipinos cook a variety of foods influenced by Western, Pacific Islander, and Asian cuisine. Philippine cuisine is considered as a melting pot of Indian, Chinese, Spanish, and American influences and indigenous ingredients.

The Spanish colonizers and friars in the 16th century brought with them produce from the Americas such as chili peppers, tomatoes, corn, potatoes, and the method of sautéing with garlic and onions.
Eating out is a favorite Filipino pastime. A typical Pinoy diet consists at most of six meals a day; breakfast, snacks, lunch, snacks, dinner, and again a midnight snack before going to sleep. Rice is a staple in the Filipino diet, and is usually eaten together with other dishes. Filipinos regularly use spoons together with forks when eating out and when it involves eating soup like nilaga .But in traditional home settings they eat most of the time with their bare hands and also when eating seafood. Rice, corn, and popular dishes such as &quot;adobo&quot; (a meat stew made from either pork or chicken), &quot;lumpia&quot; (meat or vegetable rolls), &quot;pancit&quot; (a noodle dish), and &quot;lechón baboy&quot; (roasted pig) are served on plates.

Other popular dishes include afritada, asado, &quot;tapa&quot;, empanada, &quot;mani&quot; (roasted peanuts), &quot;paksiw&quot; (fish or pork, cooked in vinegar and water with some spices like garlic and pepper), &quot;pandesal&quot; (bread of salt), &quot;laing&quot;, &quot;sisig&quot;, &quot;torta&quot; (omelette), kare-kare (ox-tail stew), &quot;kilawen&quot;, pinakbet (vegetable stew), pinapaitan, and &quot;sinigang&quot; (tamarind soup with a variety of pork, fish, or prawns). Some delicacies eaten by some Filipinos may seem unappetizing to the Western palate include &quot;balut&quot; (boiled egg with a fertilized duckling inside), longganisa (sweet sausage), and dinuguan (soup made from pork blood).

Popular snacks and desserts such as chicharon (deep fried pork or chicken skin), halo-halo (crushed ice with evaporated milk, flan, sliced tropical fruit, and sweet beans), puto (white rice cakes), bibingka (rice cake with butter or margarine and salted eggs), ensaymada (sweet roll with grated cheese on top), &quot;pulburon&quot; (powder candy), and &quot;tsokolate&quot; (chocolate) are usually eaten outside the three main meals. Popular Filipino beverages include Beer, Tanduay Rhum, lambanog, and tuba.

Every province has its own specialty and tastes vary in each region. In Bicol, for example, foods are generally spicier than elsewhere in the Philippines. &quot;Patis&quot; (fish sauce), &quot;suka&quot; (vinegar), &quot;toyo&quot; (soy sauce), &quot;bagoong&quot;, and &quot;banana ketchup&quot; are the most common condiments found in Filipino homes and restaurants.

Western fast food chains such as McDonald&#x27;s, Wendy&#x27;s, KFC, and Pizza Hut are a common sight in the country. Local food chains such as Jollibee, Goldilocks Bakeshop, Mang Inasal and Chowking are also popular and have successfully competed against international fast food chains.

==Education==

Education in the Philippines has been influenced by Western and Eastern ideology and philosophy from the United States, Spain, and its neighbouring Asian countries. Philippine students enter public school at about age four, starting from nursery school up to kindergarten. At about seven years of age, students enter elementary school (6 to 9 years) this include Grade 7 to Grade 10 as junior high school, then after, they graduate. Since the Philippines has already implemented the K-12 system, students will enter SHS or senior high school, a 2-year course, to be able to prepare college life with their chosen track such as ABM (Accountancy Business Management), STEM (Science, Technology, Engineering and Mathematics) and HUMSS (Humanities and Social Sciences) other tracks are included like TECH-VOC (Technical Vocational). Students can make a choice if they will take the college entrance examinations (CEE) in order to attend college or university (3 to 5 years) or find work after they graduate senior high school.

Other types of schools in the country include private schools, preparatory schools, international schools, laboratory high schools, and science high schools. Of these schools, private Catholic schools are the most famous. Catholic schools are preferred in the Philippines due to their religious beliefs. Most Catholic schools are co-ed. The uniforms of Catholic schools usually have an emblem along with the school colors. International schools follow different curricula, such as Singaporean, American, and British. With this, their approach differs depending on the overall programs that these curricula offer.

The school year in the Philippines starts in June and ends in March, with a two-month summer break from April to May, two-week semestral break in October and Christmas and New Year&#x27;s holidays. Changes are currently being made to the system and some universities have copied the Westernized academic calendar and now start the school year in August.

In 2005, the Philippines spent about US$138 per pupil compared to US$1,582 in Singapore, US$3,728 in Japan, and US$852 in Thailand.

==Sports and recreation==


Arnis, a form of martial arts, is the national sport in the Philippines. Among the most popular sports include basketball, boxing, football, billiards, chess, ten-pin bowling, volleyball, horse racing, Sepak Takraw, cockfighting and Bullfighting. Dodgeball, badminton, and tennis are also popular.

Filipinos have gained international success in sports. These are boxing, football, billiards, ten-pin bowling, and chess. Popular sport stars include Manny Pacquiao, Flash Elorde, and Francisco Guilledo in boxing, Paulino Alcántara in football, Carlos Loyzaga, Robert Jaworski, and Ramon Fernandez in basketball, Efren Reyes and Francisco Bustamante in billiards, Rafael Nepomuceno in ten-pin bowling, Eugene Torre and Renato Naranja in chess, and Mark Muñoz in MMA. The Philippine National Basketball Team is a powerhouse in Asia and has the best performance of all Asian teams in the Olympics and the FIBA World Cup.

The Palarong Pambansa, a national sports festival, has its origin in an annual sporting meet of public schools that started in 1948. Private schools and universities eventually joined the national event, which became known as the &quot;Palarong Pambansa&quot; in 1976. It serves as a national Olympic Games for students, competing at school and national level contests. The year 2002 event included football, golf, archery, badminton, baseball, chess, gymnastics, tennis, softball, swimming, table tennis, taekwondo, track and field, and volleyball.

===Martial arts===

There are several forms of Filipino martial arts that originated in the Philippines (similar to how Silat is the martial arts practiced in Asia) including Eskrima (weapon-based fighting, also known as &quot;Arnis&quot; and in the West sometimes as &quot;Kali&quot;), Panantukan (empty-handed techniques), and Pananjakman (the boxing component of Filipino martial arts).

===Traditional Filipino games and pastimes===


Traditional Philippine games such as &quot;luksong baka&quot;, &quot;patintero&quot;, &quot;piko&quot;, and &quot;tumbang preso&quot; are still played primarily as children&#x27;s games among the youth. Sungka is played on a board game using small sea shells in which players try to take all shells. The winner is determined by who has the most shells at the point when all small pits become empty.

One traditional Filipino game is &quot;luksong tinik&quot;, a very popular game to Filipino children where one has to jump over the &quot;tinik&quot; and cross to the other side unscathed. Other traditional Filipino games include yo-yo, piko, patintero, bahay kubo, pusoy, and sungka. Tong-its is a popular gambling game. Individuals play the game by trying to get rid of all the cards by choosing poker hands wisely. Card games are popular during festivities, with some, including &quot;pusoy&quot; and &quot;tong-its&quot;, being used as a form of illegal gambling. Mahjong is played in some Philippine communities.

Sabong or cockfighting is another popular entertainment especially among Filipino men, and existed prior to the arrival of the Spanish. Antonio Pigafetta, Magellan&#x27;s chronicler, first documented this pastime in the kingdom of Taytay.

The yo-yo, a popular toy in the Philippines, was introduced in its modern form by Pedro Flores with its name coming from the Ilocano language.

Filipinos have created toys using insects such as tying a beetle to string, and sweeping it circular rotation to make an interesting sound. The &quot;Salagubang gong&quot; is a toy described by Charles Brtjes, an American entomologist, who traveled to Negros and discovered a toy using beetles to create a periodic gong effect on a kerosene can as the beetle rotates above the contraption. &quot;Piko&quot; is a Filipino version of the game hopscotch. Children will draw a sequence rectangles using chalk on the ground. With various level of obstacle on each rectangle, children will compete against one another or in a team. Players use &quot;pamato;&quot; usually a flat stone, slipper or anything that could be tossed easily.

==Rites of passage==

Every year, usually in April and May, thousands of Filipino boys are taken by their parents to be circumcised. According to the World Health Organization (WHO) about 90% of Filipino men are circumcised, one of the world&#x27;s highest circumcision rates. Although the roots of the practice date back to the arrival of Islam in 1450, the succeeding 200 years of Spanish rule obviated the religious reasons for circumcision. Nevertheless, circumcision, called &quot;tuli&quot;, has persisted. The pressure to be circumcised is evidenced even in the language: the Tagalog word for &#x27;uncircumcised&#x27;, &quot;supot&quot;, also means &#x27;coward&#x27;. It is commonly believed that a circumcised eight or ten year-old is no longer a boy and is given more adult roles in the family and society.

== Intangible cultural heritage ==
The Philippines, with the National Commission for Culture and the Arts as the de facto Ministry of Culture, ratified the 2003 Convention after its formal deposit in August 2006.

Prior to the 2003 Convention, the Philippines was invited by UNESCO to nominate intangible heritage elements for the inclusion to the Proclamation of Masterpieces of the Oral and Intangible Heritage of Humanity. This prompted the proclamation of the Hudhud chant of the Ifugao in 2001 and Darangen epic chant of the Maranao in 2005. After the establishment of the 2003 Convention, all entries to the Proclamation of Masterpieces were incorporated in the Representative List of Intangible Cultural Heritage of Humanity in 2008. A third inscription was made in 2015 through a multinational nomination between Cambodia, the Philippines, the Republic of Korea and Viet Nam for the Tugging Rituals and Games, wherein the &quot;Punnuk&quot;, tugging ritual of the Ifugao was included.

As part of the objective of the 2003 Convention, the National Commission for Culture and the Arts through the Intangible Cultural Heritage unit and in partnership with the Intangible Cultural Heritage in the Asia-Pacific Region (ICHCAP), published the &quot;&quot;Pinagmulan&quot;: Enumeration from the Philippine Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage&quot; in 2012. The publication contains an initial inventory of 335 ICH elements with elaborate discussions on 109 ICH elements. The elements listed are the first batch of continuous updating process initiated by the government, UNESCO, and other stakeholders. In 2014, the Pinagmulan was a finalist under the category of the Elfren S. Cruz Prize for Best Book in the Social Sciences to the National Book Awards organized by the National Book Development Board. The Philippine inventory is currently being updated as a measure to safeguard more intangible cultural heritage elements in the country. The updating began in 2013 and results may be released in 5–10 years after the scientific process finishes the second batch of element documentations. According to UNESCO, it is not expected by a country or state party to have a completed inventory. On the contrary, the development and updating of inventories is an ongoing process that can never be finished.

Between 2015 and 2017, UNESCO&#x27;s &quot;Intangible Cultural Heritage Courier of Asia and the Pacific&quot; featured the &quot;darangen&quot; epic chant, &quot;punnuk&quot; tugging ritual, and at least three kinds of traditional healing practices in the Philippines, including the &quot;manghihilot&quot; and &quot;albularyo&quot; healing practices and belief of &quot;buhay na tubig&quot; (living water) of the Tagalog people of 20th century Quezon city, the &quot;baglan&quot; and &quot;mandadawak&quot; healing practices and stone beliefs of the Itneg people in Abra, and the &quot;mantatawak&quot; healing practices of the Tagalog people of Marinduque. By 2016, according to the ICH Unit, National Commission for Culture and the Arts, there were 367 elements listed under the Philippine Inventory of Intangible Cultural Heritage (PIICH), the official ICH inventory of the Philippines. All elements under the PIICH are listed in Philippine Registry of Cultural Property (PRECUP), the official cultural property inventory of the country which includes both tangible and intangible cultural properties. In April 2018, the &quot;buklog&quot; of the Subanen people was nominated by the National Commission for Culture and the Arts in the list for urgent safeguarding.

==Filipino diaspora==

An Overseas Filipino is a person of Filipino origin, who lives outside of the Philippines. This term is applied to people of Filipino ancestry, who are citizens or residents of a different country. Often, these Filipinos are referred to as Overseas Filipino Workers.

There are about 11 million overseas Filipinos living worldwide, equivalent to about 11 percent of the total population of the Philippines.

Each year, thousands of Filipinos migrate to work abroad through overseas employment agencies and other programs. Other individuals emigrate and become permanent residents of other nations. Overseas Filipinos often work as doctors, nurses, accountants, IT professionals, engineers, architects, entertainers, technicians, teachers, military servicemen, students, caregivers, domestic helpers, and household maids.

International employment includes an increasing number of skilled Filipino workers taking on unskilled work overseas, resulting in what has been referred to as brain drain, particularly in the health and education sectors. Also, the employment can result in underemployment, for example, in cases where doctors undergo retraining to become nurses and other employment programs.

==Festivals==

Festivals in the Philippines, locally known as &quot;fiestas&quot;, originated dating back to the Spanish colonial period when the Spaniards introduced Christianity to the country. Most Philippine towns and cities has a patron saint assigned to each of them. Fiestas in the Philippines serve as either religious, cultural, or both. These festivals are held to honor the patron saint or to commemorate history and culture, such as promoting local products and celebrate a bountiful harvest. Fiestas can be categorized by Holy Masses, processions, parades, theatrical play and reenactments, religious or cultural rituals, trade fairs, exhibits, concerts, pageants and various games and contests.

==Heritage towns and cities==
The Philippines is home to numerous heritage towns and cities, many of which have been intentionally destroyed by the Japanese through fire tactics in World War II and the Americans through bombings during the same war. After the war, the government of the Empire of Japan withheld from giving funds to the Philippines for the restoration of the heritage towns they destroyed, effectively destroying any chances of restoration since the pre-war Philippines&#x27; economy was devastated and had limited monetary supply. On the other hand, the United States gave minimal funding for only two of the hundreds of cities they destroyed, namely, Manila and Baguio.

Today, only the centres (poblacion or downtown areas) of Filipino heritage towns and cities remain in most of the expansive heritage cities and towns in the country. Yet, some heritage cities in their former glory prior to the war still exist, such as the UNESCO city of Vigan which was the only heritage town saved from American bombing and Japanese fire and kamikaze tactics. The country currently lacks a city/town-singular architectural style law. Due to this, unaesthetic cement or shanty structures have taken over heritage buildings annually, destroying many former heritage townscapes. Some heritage buildings have been demolished or sold to corporations, and have been replaced by commercial structures such as shopping centers, condominium units, or newly furnished modern-style buildings, completely destroying the old aesthetics of many former heritage towns and cities. This is one of the reasons why UNESCO has repeatedly withheld from inscribing further Filipino heritage towns in the World Heritage List since 1999. Only the heritage city of Vigan has a town law that guarantees its singular architecture (the Vigan colonial style) shall always be used in constructions and reconstructions.

While Silay, Iloilo City, and San Fernando de Pampanga have ordinances giving certain tax exemptions to owners of heritage houses. In 2010, the Philippine Cultural Heritage Act passed into law, effectively giving protections to all cultural heritage properties of the Philippines. However, despite its passage, many ancestral home owners continue to approve the demolition of ancestral structures. In certain cases, government entities themselves were the purveyors of such demolitions.

<text>The Heinkel He 178 was an experimental aircraft designed and produced by the German aircraft manufacturer Heinkel. It was the world&#x27;s first aircraft to fly using the thrust from a turbojet engine.

The He 178 was developed to test the jet propulsion concept devised by the German engineer Hans von Ohain during the mid-1930s. Having secured the industrial support of Ernst Heinkel, von Ohain was able to demonstrate a working turbojet engine, the Heinkel HeS 1, in September 1937. Heinkel pursued development of the He 178 as a private venture, independent of the German authorities and the Luftwaffe, keeping the aircraft relatively secret for much of its development. Heinkel was keen not only to demonstrate the capabilities of aviation gas turbines, but had a separate emphasis on developing high-speed flight technologies.

On 27 August 1939, the He 178 V1, the first prototype, performed its maiden flight, piloted by Erich Warsitz. This flight, which only lasted for six minutes, had been preceded by a short hop by the same aircraft three days prior. Due to its performance limitations, such as a maximum speed of and its relatively small endurance, the aircraft failed to impress high-ranking Nazi officials such as Ernst Udet and Erhard Milch, who attended a demonstration flight. Heinkel subsequently developed a twin-engined jet-powered fighter aircraft, building on the lessons of the He 178, to produce the He 280. The He 178 provided valuable test data to guide the development of subsequent jet-powered aircraft. The He 178 V1 prototype itself went on static display in Berlin for a time before it was destroyed by an Allied air raid on the city in 1943.

==Development==
===Background===

In 1935, Hans von Ohain, a young German engineer, successfully took out a patent on the use of the exhaust from a gas turbine as a means of propulsion. Von Ohain presented his idea to the aeronautical engineer Ernst Heinkel, who was sufficiently impressed that he agreed to help develop the concept. This industrial support would prove highly beneficial to von Ohain&#x27;s work. According to New Scientist, Heinkel had already been interested in the potential of the gas turbine prior to encountering von Ohain and his work.

During September 1937, von Ohain successfully demonstrated his first engine, the Heinkel HeS 1. Accordingly, it was promptly decided to begin designing an aircraft for which a similar such engine could be installed and tested in the air. This aircraft, which would be designated &quot;He 178&quot;, was designed around von Ohain&#x27;s third engine design, the HeS 3, which burned either diesel fuel or gasoline. To support the programme, the HeS 3 was test flown in a Heinkel He 118, but only as a supplemental engine to the conventional piston engine that it retained.

The He 178 was a relatively compact aircraft, featuring a primarily metal fuselage and using a largely conventional configuration and construction. The nose accommodated the air intake for the engine, which was housed within the central fuselage. The aircraft was fitted with tailwheel undercarriage. The main landing gear was intended to be retractable, but actually remained fixed in the &quot;down&quot; position throughout the flight trials. It was furnished with high-mounted wooden wings that had the characteristic Günter brothers elliptical trailing edge planform. Photos showing a &quot;straight wing&quot; (straight-line-taper in the wing planform, for both the leading and trailing edges) were of the second prototype He 178 V2, which never flew under power.

===Into flight===
On 27 August 1939, the aircraft performed its maiden flight, only days before Germany invaded Poland. This flight, piloted by Erich Warsitz, lasted only six minutes and almost ended in near-disaster due to a misjudgement during the unpowered landing approach, but was successfully recovered. Warsitz later described his groundbreaking flight: &quot;I moved the throttle levers gently forward. As the aircraft began to roll I was initially rather disappointed at the thrust, for she did not shoot forward as the 176 had done, but moved off slowly. By the 300-metre mark she was moving very fast. Despite several attempts I could not retract the undercarriage. It was not important, all that mattered was that she flew. The rudder and all flaps worked almost normally, the turbine howled. Now I would have to take my chances with the landing, losing altitude by side-slipping. I restored her to the correct attitude just before touching down, made a wonderful landing and pulled up just short of the Warnow.&quot;

Heinkel had developed the turbojet engine and the testbed aircraft, the Heinkel He 178 V1, in great secrecy. Their existence were concealed even from the Luftwaffe. On 1 November 1939, after the German victory in Poland, Heinkel arranged a demonstration of the aircraft before a group of Nazi officials. While Hermann Göring, the commander in chief of the Luftwaffe, was not in attendance, the demonstration was watched by Ernst Udet and Erhard Milch, Minister of Aircraft Production and Supply, however, they were reportedly not impressed by its performance. While the He 178 had been a success on a technical basis, its speed was restricted to no greater than , even when fitted with the more powerful HeS 6 engines, capable of generating up to of thrust, while its combat endurance was limited to only ten minutes.

===Legacy===
Heinkel was disappointed by the lack of official interest in his private-venture jet. In his autobiography, he attributes that to the failure of the leaders of the &quot;Reichsluftfahrtministerium&quot; to understand the advantages of jet propulsion and the breakthrough that He 178 represented. Undeterred by a lack of support from external officials, Heinkel decided to embark on the development of a twin-engine jet fighter as a private venture, harnessing what had been learned from flying the He 178 prototype. This would result in the He 280, the first prototype jet-powered fighter aircraft. It was not derived from the He 178, however, partially as some aspects of the design had deemed to be unsuitable for further development, such as mounting the engine within the fuselage which proved to be impractical.

Unknown to Heinkel, the Reich Air Ministry had already been developing its own jet technology. In fact, in September 1939, the development of jet powered single-seat aircraft was ordered to continue despite a general order to cut back on non-core development work as to get certain aircraft types operational as soon as possible. However, the jet engines that would be developed by Junkers and BMW would differ considerably from those engines used by the He 178, instead favouring the axial flow approach in place of the earlier centrifugal design. Nevertheless, the He 178 programme was a valuable source of test data that aided subsequent development efforts considerably.

The He 178 V1 airframe was placed on display at the Deutsche Luftfahrtsammlung in Berlin, where it was destroyed in an air raid in 1943.

<doc id="364153" wikidata="Q804988" url="?curid=364153" title="Chen (surname)">
<text>Chen () is a common Chinese-language surname and one of the most common surnames in Asia. It is the most common surname in Taiwan (2010) and Singapore (2000). Chen is also the most common family name in Guangdong, Zhejiang, Fujian, Macau, and Hong Kong. It is the most common surname in Xiamen, the ancestral hometown of many overseas Hoklo.

Chen was listed 10th in the &quot;Hundred Family Surnames&quot; poem, in the verse 馮陳褚衛 &quot;(Féng Chén Chǔ Wèi)&quot;.

In Cantonese, it is usually romanized as Chan (e.g., Jackie Chan), most widely used by those from Hong Kong, and also found in Macau and Singapore. It is also sometimes spelled Chun. The spelling Tan usually comes from Southern Min dialects (e.g., Hokkien), while some Teochew dialect speakers use the spelling Tang. In Hakka and Taishanese, the name is spelled Chin. Spellings based on Wu include Zen and Tchen. There are many spellings based on its Hainanese pronunciations, including Dan, Seng, and Sin.

In Vietnam, this surname is written as Trần (in &quot;Quốc Ngữ&quot;) and is 2nd most common. In Thailand, this surname is the most common surname of Thai Chinese and is often pronounced according to Teochew dialect as Tang. In Cambodia, this surname is transliterated as Taing. In Japanese, the surname is transliterated Chin (ちん). In Korean it is transliterated Jin or Chin (진).

In Indonesia, many Chinese Indonesians who originally had this surname adopted the Indonesian surname Chandra, Hartanto, and other surnames with the prefix Tan.

Chen is 5th most common surname in mainland China, but 4th most common in the world due to the larger overseas population. With all its various spellings and pronunciations, there are around 80–100 million people surnamed 陳/陈 worldwide.

The surname Cheng (程) is sometimes romanized as Chen (e.g., John S. Chen). Another less common Chinese surname / (Shen) can also be romanized as Chen.

== Character ==
As well as being a surname, the Chinese character can also mean &#x27;to describe&#x27; or &#x27;ancient&#x27;. It is a combination of the radical 阝 and the phonetic component 東/东.

==History==

Chen descends from the legendary sage king Emperor Shun from around 2200 BC via the surname Gui ().

A millennium after Emperor Shun, when King Wu of Zhou established the Zhou dynasty (), he enfeoffed his son-in-law Gui Man, also known as Duke Hu of Chen or Chen Hugong (陈胡公). Chen Hugong, a descendant of Emperor Shun, found the State of Chen in modern Huaiyang County, Henan Province. In 479 BC, Chen was absorbed by Chu and became the Chu capital. The people of Chen adopted the name of their former state as their surname.

At the end of the Qin dynasty, Chen Sheng initiated the Chen Sheng Wu Guang uprising that overthrew the Qin and paved the way for the Han dynasty, one of China&#x27;s golden ages.

During the Northern and Southern dynasties period (420–589), Chen Baxian established the Chen dynasty (557–589), the fourth and the last of the Southern dynasties, which was eventually absorbed by the Sui dynasty.

During this period, the nomadic Xianbei people had systematically assimilated into China&#x27;s agrarian culture and adopted Han Chinese surnames under the state directives of Emperor Xiaowen of Northern Wei. The Xianbei subjects whose surname of &quot;侯莫陳&quot; (Hóumòchén) were converted to &quot;陳&quot; (Chen).

Some descendants of Chen migrated to Vietnam (Dai Viet) and established the Trần dynasty, a golden age in Vietnam. Their original home was Fujian, and they migrated under Trần Kinh (陳京 Chén Jīng). Trần Thái Tông (陈太宗 Chen Taizong) became the founding emperor of the Tran dynasty, and his descendants would rule Vietnam for more than a century, expanding Vietnam&#x27;s territory and promoting developments in language, chu nom, culture, and art. Certain members of the clan could still speak Chinese, like when a Yuan dynasty envoy had a meeting with the Chinese-speaking Tran Prince Trần Quốc Tuấn in 1282.

During the Yuan–Ming transition, Chen Youliang founded the Chen Han dynasty, which helped overthrow Yuan rule and pave the way for the Ming dynasty.

In the 20th century, Chen Duxiu cofounded the Chinese Communist Party and became its first general secretary, but was eventually expelled from the party and condemned by Mao due to advocating Trotskyism.

==Distribution==
Chen is the 5th most common surname in mainland China (around 70 million) and 4th most common in the world (around 80–100 million, including all its variants like Chan, Tan, Tran).

A 2013 study found that it was the 5th most common surname, shared by 61,300,000 people or 4.610% of the population, with the province with the most being Guangdong.

According to 2018 census, it was 5th most common in mainland China at around 63 million, but 4th most common surname in the world with 80–100 million people. It is the most common Chinese surname overseas.

In 2019 Chen was again the fifth most common surname in mainland China. It is the most common surname in the southern provinces of Zhejiang, Fujian, and Guangdong.

Hong Kong has around 700,000 using the spelling &quot;Chan&quot; and 61,000 using the spelling &quot;Chen&quot;, so in total around 700,000–800,000 Chen (陈), which ranks first in Hong Kong.

In Thailand, last names are more unique therefore the Chinese last name Chen ranks 2nd with 88,000 and with an incidence of 1 to 900.

There are 187,000 Chens in the US, as of 2014. It is the 30th most common last name in California where there are 70,000. 11,300 in Texas, 6,800 Illinois, 5,900 Maryland. New Jersey was undercounted with data missing; New York had 5,400.

In Canada there are 32,900 Chens; 16,600 Ontario and 11,000 British Columbia.

Chen is usually one of the top 5 common Asian last names and top 3 most common Chinese in the US.

<text>The Reichenbach Falls () are a waterfall cascade of seven steps on the stream called Rychenbach in the Bernese Oberland region of Switzerland. They drop over a total height of about . At , the upper falls, known as the Grand Reichenbach Fall (), is by far the tallest segment and one of the highest waterfalls in the Alps, and among the forty highest in Switzerland. The Reichenbach loses of height from the top of the falls to the valley floor of the Haslital. Today, a hydroelectric power company harnesses the flow of the Reichenbach Falls during certain times of year, reducing its flow.

In popular literature, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle gave the Grand (or Great) Reichenbach Fall as the location of the final physical altercation between his hero Sherlock Holmes and his greatest foe, the criminal Professor Moriarty, in &quot;The Final Problem&quot;.

==Location==
The falls are located in the lower part of the Reichenbachtal, on the Rychenbach, a tributary (from the south bank) of the Aare. They are some south of the town of Meiringen, and Interlaken. Politically, the falls are within the municipality of Schattenhalb in the canton of Bern.

The falls are made accessible by the Reichenbach Funicular. The lower station is some 20 minutes walk, or a 6-minute bus ride, from Meiringen railway station on the Brünig railway line that links Interlaken and Lucerne.

==In popular culture==

===Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s &quot;Sherlock Holmes&quot; stories===
The town and the falls are known worldwide as the setting for a fictional event: it is the location where Sir Arthur Conan Doyle&#x27;s hero, Sherlock Holmes, fights to the death with Professor Moriarty, at the end of &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, first published in 1893. A memorial plate at the funicular station commemorates Holmes, and there is also a Sherlock Holmes museum in the nearby town of Meiringen.

Out of many waterfalls in the Bernese Oberland, Reichenbach Falls seems to have made the greatest impression on Sir Arthur Conan Doyle, who was shown them on a Swiss holiday by his host Sir Henry Lunn, the founder of Lunn Poly. Sir Henry&#x27;s grandson, Peter Lunn, recalled, &quot;My grandfather said &#x27;Push him over the Reichenbach Falls&#x27; and Conan Doyle hadn’t heard of them, so he showed them to him.&quot; So impressed was Doyle that he decided to let his hero die there.

The actual ledge from which Moriarty fell is on the other side of the falls from the funicular; it is accessible by climbing the path to the top of the falls, crossing the bridge and following the trail down the hill. The ledge is marked by a plaque as illustrated here; the English inscription reads: &quot;At this fearful place, Sherlock Holmes vanquished Professor Moriarty, on 4 May 1891.&quot; The pathway on which the duel between Sherlock Holmes and Professor Moriarty occurs ends some hundred metres away from the falls. When Doyle viewed the falls, the path ended very close to the falls, close enough to touch it, yet over the hundred years after his visit, the pathway has become unsafe and slowly eroded away, and the falls have receded further back into the gorge.

===In other media===
The Reichenbach Falls are the subject of several early 19th-century paintings by the English Romantic landscape painter J. M. W. Turner.

The indie band Ravens &amp; Chimes named its debut album (released in 2007) after the falls. 

Many adaptations of Sherlock Holmes have featured the confrontation at Reichenbach, notably including the Granada Television series, starring Jeremy Brett as Sherlock Holmes. The Granada adaptation of &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, with David Burke as Dr Watson and Eric Porter as Professor Moriarty, was filmed at the real Reichenbach Falls. The series later returned there for some scenes in &quot;The Empty House&quot;, with Edward Hardwicke as Watson.

&quot;Reichenbach Falls&quot; was also the title of a 2008 BBC Four TV drama by James Mavor, based on an idea by Ian Rankin and set in Edinburgh. Numerous historical characters associated with the city, including Conan Doyle and his mentor Dr Joseph Bell, are mentioned in the story.

&quot;Sherlock Holmes: A Game of Shadows&quot;, a 2011 film adaptation inspired by &quot;The Final Problem&quot;, also hosts the falls, although in this adaptation, a large castle has been built over them, replacing the pathway.

The third episode from the 2012 second series of the BBC drama &quot;Sherlock&quot;, &quot;The Reichenbach Fall&quot; (inspired by &quot;The Final Problem&quot;), is a play on the waterfall&#x27;s name. The special episode of &quot;Sherlock&quot;, &quot;The Abominable Bride&quot;, which was broadcast on 1 January 2016, featured a re-creation of the showdown between Sherlock and Moriarty set in Victorian times, as depicted in the book.

The final season of the TV series &quot;Elementary&quot; features a villain named Odin Reichenbach. The next-to-last episode, in which the character meets justice, is titled &quot;Reichenbach Falls&quot;.

<text>The Philippine Basketball Association (PBA) is a men&#x27;s professional basketball league in the Philippines, composed of twelve company-branded franchise teams. Founded in 1975, it is the first professional basketball league in Asia and the second-oldest in the world after the NBA.

The league played its first game at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City on April 9, 1975, and its regulations are a hybrid of rules from the NBA and FIBA. As of the 2022–23 season, the PBA season consists of three tournaments known as &quot;conferences&quot;: the Philippine Cup, the Commissioner&#x27;s Cup, and the Governors&#x27; Cup. The Commissioner&#x27;s and Governors&#x27; Cups allow each team to sign a single foreign player known as an &quot;import&quot;. Meanwhile, the Philippine Cup is exclusive for Filipino players and is considered the most prestigious of the three conferences. Although the three conferences have minor variations in format and rules, each consists of a single round-robin elimination round followed by playoffs to determine the champion. The winners of the conference cups do not face each other at the end of the season to determine the season champion; instead, each conference champion team are considered PBA champions. The achievement of a team winning all three conferences in a season is called the Grand Slam.

The San Miguel Beermen are the most successful team with a total of 29 championships, including a Grand Slam in 1989. They have also won the most titles in each of the current conferences: 10 Philippine Cups, 5 Commissioner&#x27;s Cups, and 5 Governors&#x27; Cups. Meanwhile, the defunct Crispa Redmanizers are the only team to have achieved two Grand Slams.

As of 2022–23, the PBA earned ₱200 million in net revenue and had an average television audience of 4 million per game. The PBA also has an official developmental league, the PBA D-League.

== History ==
=== Founding ===

The Philippine Basketball Association was founded when nine teams left the now-defunct Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association (MICAA), which was tightly controlled by the Basketball Association of the Philippines (BAP), the FIBA-recognized national association at the time. With the BAP controlling the MICAA, the league was &quot;de jure&quot; amateur, as players were only paid allowances. This is much like what was done in other countries to circumvent the amateur requirement and to play in FIBA-sanctioned tournaments such as the Olympics. MICAA team owners were not pleased with how BAP (then led by Gonzalo &quot;Lito&quot; Puyat) were taking away their players to join the national team without consulting them first. On January 23, 1975, Mariwasa-Noritake Porcelainmakers&#x27; team owner, Emerson Coseteng, together with Carrier Weathermakers, Toyota Comets, Seven-Up Uncolas and Presto Ice Cream announced the formation of the PBA. The Crispa Redmanizers, Royal Tru-Orange, Tanduay Distillery, and the U/Tex Weavers later joined the upcoming professional league. Leopoldo Prieto, the coach for the Philippines at the 1956 Melbourne Olympics, was appointed as the first commissioner and Coseteng was chosen as the first president of the league&#x27;s Board of Governors. The first game of the league was held at the Araneta Coliseum on April 9, 1975, featuring Mariwasa-Noritake and Concepcion Carrier.

=== Early years ===
The league&#x27;s first 10 years was known for the intense rivalry of the Crispa Redmanizers and the Toyota Tamaraws, still considered one of the greatest rivalries in league history. Big names such as Robert Jaworski, Ramon Fernandez, Francis Arnaiz, Atoy Co, Bogs Adornado and Philip Cezar played for those squads before the two teams disbanded in 1983 and 1984 respectively. Following their disbandment, the league moved from the Araneta Coliseum to ULTRA in Pasig. There, the league continued to be popular, as several former Toyota and Crispa players suited up for different teams.

During the mid to late 1980s, Jaworski and Ginebra San Miguel became the league&#x27;s most popular squad for their &quot;never say die&quot; attitude. The team had intense rivalries with the Tanduay Rhum Masters, which was led by Jaworski&#x27;s ex-Toyota teammate-turned-rival Fernandez, and later the expansion Purefoods Corporation and younger players Alvin Patrimonio, Jerry Codiñera, Jojo Lastimosa and Fernandez (who moved from Tanduay). By the end of the 1980s, San Miguel Beer won numerous championships that included the 1989 Grand Slam, led by coach Norman Black and former national team stars Samboy Lim and Hector Calma.

In 1989, FIBA voted to allow professionals to play in their sanctioned tournaments, hence the PBA&#x27;s players are now able to represent the country internationally. In 1990, the league sent its first all-professional squad to the Asian Games, earning a silver medal. The PBA would later send three more all-pro squads to the event.

The early 1990s saw Ginebra and Shell forming an intense rivalry that included Ginebra&#x27;s walkout in 1990 finals against Shell and the team&#x27;s dramatic comeback from a 3–1 deficit to beat Shell in the 1991 First Conference. Patrimonio, Allan Caidic, and a host of others became the league&#x27;s main attraction. By 1993, the league moved to the Cuneta Astrodome in Pasay and later saw the Alaska Milkmen win the 1996 grand slam and nine titles in the decade.

=== Competition and scheduling changes ===
From 1999 to 2000, the PBA endured controversy. Several expatriate cagers arrived on the scene (such as Asi Taulava, Danny Seigle and Eric Menk). Their lineage was questionable and most of them were deported for falsifying documents. The arrival of dozens of these players was a counter to the fledgling Metropolitan Basketball Association, a regional-based professional league formed in 1998. After ABS-CBN&#x27;s 2001 abandonment, the MBA faced mounting expenses and would fold within a year. Despite the MBA&#x27;s disbandment and the arrival of those players to the PBA, attendance went sour for the PBA in 2002 and was even worse the following year.

In 2004, the league introduced drastic scheduling changes, when it decided to begin the season in October instead of January. The change in starting the season allowed the league to accommodate international tournaments held from June to September and it fit better with college hoops, the NCAA and the UAAP, whose seasons run from June to October. The league also reduced the number of conferences from three to two, renaming the All-Filipino Cup as the Philippine Cup and introducing a new import laden tournament named as the Fiesta Conference. To accommodate these changes, a transitional tournament, the 2004 PBA Fiesta Conference was held from February to July, which was won by the Barangay Ginebra Kings. The league also began to hold the annual All-Star weekend in the provinces, alternating from Luzon and Visayas/Mindanao provinces every year.

The league regained some popularity by this year, thanks in large part to Barangay Ginebra&#x27;s three PBA championships led by Eric Menk, Jayjay Helterbrand and Mark Caguioa. Solid marketing and arrival of collegiate stars from the UAAP and the NCAA also worked in the PBA&#x27;s favor.

By 2005, the league would take on the role of Philippine national representation under Chot Reyes, when FIBA lifted the suspension of the country following the formation of the Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas despite a ninth-place finish in the 2007 FIBA Asia Championship. In 2009, however, the all-amateur Smart Gilas team became the country&#x27;s official representative in international competitions. The PBA&#x27;s role in forming a national team was thus reduced to sending up reinforcements to beef up the national squad.

=== Modern era and expansion ===
After the appointment of Chito Salud, son of former commissioner Rudy Salud as the commissioner of the PBA, the league returned the three-conference format starting in the 2010–11 season. This also ushered the return of the previously retired conferences, the Commissioner&#x27;s and Governors&#x27; cups.

The beginning of the 2010s also saw the dominance of the Talk &#x27;N Text Tropang Texters, who nearly got the Grand Slam in the 2010–11 season and won the Philippine Cup in three consecutive years (2010–11, 2011–12, 2012–13) enabling them to permanently keep possession of the Jun Bernardino Trophy, the trophy given to the Philippine Cup champions.

On May 19, 2013, the third game of the PBA Commissioner&#x27;s Cup Finals between the Alaska Aces and the Barangay Ginebra San Miguel set the all-time basketball attendance record of 23,436 at the Smart Araneta Coliseum, which broke the previous record of 23,108 set 11 days earlier that featured the semifinals series doubleheader between Alaska vs. San Mig Coffee and Barangay Ginebra vs. Talk &#x27;N Text. This record was eventually broken on February 12, 2014, when the seventh game of the 2013–14 PBA Philippine Cup Semifinals series between Barangay Ginebra San Miguel and San Mig Super Coffee Mixers set the all-time basketball attendance record of 24,883.

The 2013–14 season became historic as the San Mig Super Coffee Mixers became the fourth team to win the Grand Slam. Tim Cone, the coach of the Coffee Mixers also made history when he became the first coach to win two Grand Slams.

For the 2014–15 season, the league expanded to twelve teams, after accepting two new franchises: Kia Sorento and Blackwater Elite. The league held its opening ceremonies at the Philippine Arena and set an all-time Philippine basketball attendance record of 52,612. This record was eventually broken during the Game 7 of the 2022–23 Commissioner&#x27;s Cup Finals, contested between the Barangay Ginebra San Miguel and guest team Bay Area Dragons, which was also held in the Philippine Arena with an attendance of 54,589.

On February 15, 2015, in the middle of the 2014–15 PBA season, commissioner Chito Salud announced that he would step down as the league&#x27;s commissioner and was succeeded by Chito Narvasa starting the 2015–16 PBA season. Salud was then appointed as the President and CEO of the league, when the board of governors decided to restructure the league and create the President/CEO position to manage the league&#x27;s marketing, expansion and business-related matters. The Commissioner (who will also be the league&#x27;s Chief Operating Officer) will handle game-related matters.

Salud, however, also stepped down as the league&#x27;s president and CEO on December 31, 2015, and was replaced by incumbent PBA chairman Robert Non. The board of governors later appointed Chito Narvasa as the President and CEO. The said position was eventually dissolved before the start of the 2016 Governors&#x27; Cup.

Amid controversies during his term, Narvasa stepped down on December 31, 2017. The board appointed Media Bureau chief Willie Marcial as his replacement on January 25, 2018.

=== PBA bubble and declining attendance ===
Upon the onset of the COVID-19 pandemic in March 2020, the league was forced to postpone their games for the 2020 season just three days after holding their opening ceremonies. It is not until October that the league was able to resume the Philippine Cup at Angeles, Pampanga in a bubble setup. This was the first time that the league held only one tournament in a season.

The opening of the 2021 season was planned to open in January 2021 but was also delayed to July 2021 due to the rising cases of COVID-19 caused by the virus&#x27; Delta variant. The games were initially played at the Ynares Sports Arena in Pasig in a semi-bubble type setup but due to another case surge in Metro Manila in August, the games were moved to the Don Honorio Ventura State University in Bacolor, Pampanga. The 2021 Governors&#x27; Cup started in December in a semi-bubble type setup at the Ynares Sports Arena in Pasig. After two weeks, the Quezon City government approved the league&#x27;s proposal to play their games with a limited number of audience at the Smart Araneta Coliseum. The league postponed indefinitely the scheduled games for January 2022 due to the increasing number of COVID-19 cases brought by the Omicron variant.

On February 16, 2022, Alaska Milk Corporation which owned the Alaska Aces announced that the team would leave the PBA at the end of the 2021 Governors&#x27; Cup after 35 years in the league and winning 14 championships. Alaska played their last game on March 19, 2022, with a loss to the NLEX Road Warriors in the quarterfinals. A ceremony was held shortly after the game to mark the Alaska&#x27;s departure from the PBA. The team was later sold to Converge ICT, to which it was named Converge FiberXers.

The league&#x27;s modern history is noted for its declining attendance, despite still pulling high television viewership. Journalists, team owners, and coaches have noted the dominance of SMC/RSA and MVP teams as a potential reason, with some calling for parity in the league. The low attendance has also been compared to the high figures of collegiate and professional volleyball in the country. The Samahang Basketbol ng Pilipinas has since stated that they will help address these concerns.

== Teams ==
All franchises are owned by corporations since the league&#x27;s inception in 1975, being the successor of the Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association, an amateur league which also featured corporate teams. They are not based on geographic locale, so they do not play in a home arena. 

A team&#x27;s name is often divided into two parts; the first is the company or brand name, then the product or a moniker – usually connected to the business of the company. In some cases, the brand name and the moniker can be fused. For example, the San Miguel Beermen is a team owned by the San Miguel Brewery of the San Miguel Corporation, makers of the popular San Miguel Beer brand. The names of the teams often changes, often depending on what product or service the owners like to advertise. A name change could be drastic, to the point of switching industries entirely, such as in the case of the Pepsi Mega Bottlers which changed their names to the Mobiline Cellulars (now TNT Tropang Giga).

;Notes
=== Team popularity ===
In 2008, a survey by the Social Weather Stations showed that Purefoods shares the honor of the league&#x27;s most popular team along with Barangay Ginebra. It appeared that Ginebra was the most popular team among men, while Purefoods was the most popular among women. Also, Ginebra was more popular in Metro Manila and Luzon and in classes ABC, while Purefoods was more popular in Visayas and Mindanao and in class D. The two teams were tied for most supporters in class E. In terms of percentage of supporters, the survey showed that, after Ginebra and Purefoods (which both got 31%), are San Miguel Beermen (21%), Alaska (13%), Sta. Lucia (5%), Red Bull (4%), Talk N&#x27; Text (3%), Coca-Cola (1%), and Air 21 (1%). Notably, the top three teams that have the most supporters have also been considered the most talent-laden teams. They also fall under the San Miguel Corporation umbrella.

=== Team rivalries ===
The most famous matchup was the Crispa-Toyota rivalry of the 1970s. Fans faithfully supported their favorite squads and appeared in the multitudes at the Araneta Coliseum, or wherever the archrivals had met. In those days, the players were very passionate. On one occasion, they engaged in a major brawl, leading to the arrest and detention of several players from both clubs at Fort Bonifacio.

The most heated rivalry in the PBA today is that of two teams representing the Ginebra franchise and the Purefoods franchise. The rivalry is now commonly known as the Manila Clasico. It traces its roots on the original Añejo–Purefoods rivalry of the late 1980s to early 1990s.

Other short-lived or less intense rivalries include:
* Tanduay vs Ginebra (1986–1987 rivalry)
* Ginebra–Shell rivalry (1990s rivalry)
* Purefoods–Swift rivalry (1990s corporate rivalry)
* Añejo/Ginebra vs San Miguel (late-1980s to present rivalry)
* Ginebra/Gordon&#x27;s Gin vs Alaska (late-1980s–2022)
* Alaska vs Purefoods (late-1980s–2022)
* Alaska vs San Miguel (late-1980s–2022)
* Red Bull vs. the San Miguel franchises (Barangay Ginebra, San Miguel and Purefoods, 2000–2007)
* Talk &#x27;N Text/TNT vs. Petron/San Miguel (2010–present)
* Purefoods/San Mig Coffee/B-Meg/Star/Magnolia vs. Rain or Shine (2009–present, &quot;New Age Rivalry or Kontrapelo&quot;)
* Barangay Ginebra–Meralco rivalry (2016–present)

== Arenas ==


As teams do not represent geographic locales, the league itself rents venues for games. The PBA usually plays a doubleheader three times a week at the arenas in Metro Manila, and a game on Saturdays at the provinces, popularly known as &quot;out-of-town&quot; games.

The majority of games are at the Araneta Coliseum in Quezon City and the SM Mall of Asia Arena in Pasay. When both arenas are unavailable, the alternate venues are the Ynares Center in Antipolo, Rizal, PhilSports Arena in Pasig, and the Filoil EcoOil Centre in San Juan. Occasionally, provincial games are hosted in selected venues throughout the country. Playoff games are usually held at venues in Metro Manila, most often at the Araneta Coliseum. However, recent incentives to promote the league throughout the country have resulted in out-of-town playoff games.

The league has also played several times outside the Philippines, the majority in Dubai where there is a large Filipino community.

Likewise the PBA had plans to construct its own indoor arena as early as 2007. The most recent plan is in 2024, with the league looking to build a venue in Metro Manila.

== Competition format ==

=== Selection of teams ===
When the PBA was created, it was from the nine clubs representing different companies that seceded from the Manila Industrial and Commercial Athletic Association (MICAA). The PBA adopted the MICAA&#x27;s &quot;franchise system&quot; akin to North American sports, only that instead of geographic regions, teams represent companies. Several teams have disbanded and entered the league. Disbandment of a team usually occurs if its mother company regularly sustains financial losses, or for non-sporting reasons, causing it to sell the team to another company. Aside from buying an already-existing team, a company can enter the PBA via an expansion team.

An aspiring team seeking to join the PBA had to be approved by majority of the existing teams. There is a lockout provision, which enables a team to veto the entry of a franchise team whose company is a direct competitor that of one of the existing team&#x27;s business.

Previously, a company is allowed only one team, with each team having one vote in the Board of Governors; with the acquisition of La Tondeña Distillers (now Ginebra San Miguel) by the San Miguel Corporation (SMC) in 1987, this caused the SMC to have two &quot;sister&quot; teams: the San Miguel Beermen and the Ginebra San Miguel (now the Barangay Ginebra San Miguel). At this point, Ginebra coach Robert Jaworski had autonomy on the decisions on his team, so the situation of SMC having sister teams was tolerated. In 1998, Jaworski ran and won for a Senate seat; this caused him to delegate coaching duties to his longtime deputy Rino Salazar. By this time, Danding Cojuangco has seized control of SMC, and he added Allan Caidic to Ginebra from San Miguel. Jaworski disapproved of this, and resigned.

In 2001 the Ayala Corporation sold its Purefoods-Hormel unit, which included the Purefoods TJ Hotdogs team, to SMC. Later that year, RFM Corporation sold its Cosmos Bottling Corporation, including the Pop Cola Panthers team, to Coca-Cola Bottlers Philippines, a subsidiary of SMC, rechristening them as the Coca-Cola Tigers, and giving SMC four teams. The PBA approved this arrangement, with SMC getting two votes in the Board of Governors instead of four. In 2006, SMC sold back its Coca-Cola unit to the Atlanta-based Coca-Cola Company, and sold the now renamed Powerade Tigers to Sultan 900, Inc., becoming the GlobalPort Batang Pier, decreasing their teams to three.

By 2010, Manuel V. Pangilinan has owned the Talk &#x27;N Text Phone Pals team via the Pilipino Telephone Company. Pangilinan, who had controlling ownership in Meralco, bought the Sta. Lucia Realtors team, rechristening them as the Meralco Bolts. His NLEX Corporation then bought the Air21 Express team in 2014, becoming the NLEX Road Warriors. This has made Cojuangco and Pangilinan own three teams each out of the 12 teams in the PBA by 2014.

This closed system, while unlike the open European model of promotion and relegation, allows teams from other leagues to carryover some of players to the PBA, if they are given this concession, such as in 2006 when the Welcoat Dragons were allowed to carry over three players from their Philippine Basketball League team.

The PBA also allows &quot;guest teams&quot;, or teams not represented in the Board of Governors, to play in certain conferences. The most recent guest team is the now-defunct Bay Area Dragons, who took part in the 2022–23 PBA Commissioner&#x27;s Cup.

===Season format===

Since the 2010–11 season, three conferences are usually held. Unlike in most leagues where a &quot;conference&quot; refers to the grouping of teams based on historical or geographical context, PBA conferences are tournaments each consisting of an elimination round and playoffs, similar to the Apertura and Clausura format in Latin American football. There may be fewer conferences in a season, such as the 2020 and 2021 seasons having one and two conferences, respectively, due to the COVID-19 pandemic. The three conferences are the Philippine Cup, Commissioner&#x27;s Cup and Governors&#x27; Cup, with the Philippine Cup being considered the most prestigious of the three. The season begins with an opening ceremony consisting of the presentation of the team&#x27;s roster and their respective muses followed by the Leo Awards, the league&#x27;s awarding ceremony, all before the start of the first game of the season.

The Philippine and Commissioner&#x27;s Cups begin with a single round-robin elimination round, where every team plays against each other once with the top eight teams advancing to the playoffs while the rest are eliminated. The Governors&#x27; Cup splits the teams into a two groups that will play in a double round-robin with the top four from each group advancing to the playoffs. The format of the playoffs depends on the conference being held and has varied over the years. The Finals, regardless of conference, is a best-of-seven series to determine the conference champion. Previous conferences featured a group stage where teams play against their group opponents twice or a second elimination round for the top teams serving as the conference semifinals. The conference champions don&#x27;t meet at the end of the season to determine an overall champion, instead, all of them are declared league champions. If a single team manages to win every conference in a single season, the team earns the rare distinction of being a Grand Slam champion. At the end of the conference, the league holds an awarding ceremony to honor the best players of the conference.

Once the season concludes, the league holds its rookie draft. Most draft applicants have played in the collegiate ranks (either in the Philippines or the United States), the PBA D-League, or in other domestic and international leagues. The off-season usually lasts a couple of months before the next season begins. In some cases, there may be a mid-season break to give way for players who are members of the Philippine national team to play in FIBA tournaments, as such the season may be lengthened. There have been calls from within the league to revert back to the two-conference format used from 2004 to 2010 to shorten the season and have it in sync with the FIBA calendar again.

===Game rules===
The PBA uses its own rules for its games, independent from FIBA or the NBA. Most non-professional leagues in the Philippines primarily use FIBA rules, so called &quot;amateur rules&quot;, although recent professional leagues, such as the MPBL and PSL, have used FIBA rules for its games. The Games and Amusements Board (GAB) has its rules for the size of the basketball court and equipment, which the PBA adapts.

Game rules have previously been predominantly influenced by the NBA, such as the rules on illegal defenses. After PBA players have been allowed to represent the Philippines in FIBA tournaments, the league adopted a portion of the FIBA rules, including allowing zone defenses, so that the Philippine national team will not be disadvantaged in FIBA competitions.

The PBA implemented a four-point shot, 27 feet from the basket, for its regular-season and playoff games, starting in its 49th season in 2024-25.

=== Player eligibility ===

Eligibility to participate in the PBA is generally limited to natural born Filipino citizens born in the Philippines. There are player quotas for natural born Filipinos born outside the Philippines, while naturalized Filipinos and foreigners can only play in certain conferences. Coaching is restricted to Filipinos, although longtime foreigner residents and holders of certain visas have been granted exemptions.

Natural-born Filipino citizens are generally eligible to become part of a PBA team through the PBA draft. Foreigners as well as naturalized Filipino citizens with no Filipino parents can not join the league through the PBA draft; both who could only play as imports, and only on certain conferences.

Filipino players who are aspiring to join the PBA through the draft and are born outside the Philippines are classed as Filipino-foreigners regardless if both their parents are Filipino citizens at the time of their birth. They have to submit documentary proof of their Filipino citizenship from the Department of Justice and the Bureau of Immigration prior to their rookie draft. Filipinos with foreign ancestry who are born in the Philippines are not subject to the same requirements. A team can have a maximum of five Filipino-foreigners players in its roster. Starting the draft for the 2022 season, the Filipino-foreigner cap was increased to seven. Filipino-foreigners would only need a passport and be of Filipino heritage.

Foreigners and naturalized Filipinos can play as imports, but only on import-laden conferences. If a player who is not a natural-born Filipino plays in an all-Filipino conference, it can lead his team forfeiting the wins in games where he took part. Imports are directly hired by teams, and are not drafted. In some conferences where imports are allowed, a height limit is imposed. An import who is over the height limit will not be allowed to play. Most imports are African Americans, but there had been tournaments where other nationalities have played in.

=== Coach eligibility ===
Head coaching role for teams in the PBA is generally only available to Filipino citizens since foreigners who are classified as non-resident aliens are barred from serving the role as head coach. It is possible for a foreigner to be a head coach of a PBA team by acquiring permanent residency such as in the case of Tim Cone and Norman Black who married Filipinos and being a holder of a Special Resident Retiree&#x27;s Visa (SRRV) such as in the case of Rajko Toroman who became eligible for an SRRV after residing in the country for at least five years. The restriction on foreigners has been in place since 1991.

=== Other regulations ===
Players of the PBA sign a Uniform Players&#x27; Contract (UPC) when they sign in with a team franchise which plays in the league. The team manager of the concerned team also signs this contract. The UPC includes the bill of rights and privileges as well as obligations and responsibilities of the PBA&#x27;s players and teams. Players under an active UPC cannot transfer to a team outside the PBA. Consequentially, this prohibits players from taking part in a league other than the PBA (also known colloquially as &quot;ligang labas&quot; or &quot;outside league&quot;). Although occasionally, players are allowed to temporarily suit up in such games if they secure permission from both their teams and the league management, especially for participations involving charity.

==Honors==

=== Championships ===

=== Awards ===
The league awards outstanding Filipino players of the season in the annual Leo Awards. The awards include the Most Valuable Player and the Rookie of the Year. At the end of each conference, the league also awards the Best Player of the Conference for Filipinos and the Bobby Parks Best Import for foreigners.

The PBA Hall of Fame was instituted in 2005 during the 30th anniversary celebration of the league.

=== Records ===
There are all-time records written in Philippine Basketball Association records, as well as distinctions like the PBA career scoring leaders, PBA 2,000 Assists Club, PBA 500 Three-Points Club, PBA 600 Most Games Club, and PBA Top 40 Rebounders. Unlike other leagues, the PBA records of individual players combine both elimination round and playoff round statistics instead of placing them in separate categories.

==Media coverage==

The PBA has been covered by television networks and other media companies since its opening day. One Sports is their current television partner. Games are being aired on live television via One Sports and PBA Rush, with livestreaming via Cignal Play, Pilipinas Live (worldwide), and Smart LiveStream. Following their departure from TV5, the PBA games are currently broadcast on RPTV.

===1975–1999===

The PBA&#x27;s first broadcast partner was Kanlaon Broadcasting System (KBS; now known as Radio Philippines Network or RPN) in 1975. Banahaw Broadcasting Corporation (BBC) broadcast the PBA in 1976 before returning to KBS in 1977. This is then followed by a four-year stint with Government Television (GTV), later renamed to Maharlika Broadcasting System (MBS) in 1980, which lasted from 1978 until 1981.

In 1982, the league awarded the broadcast rights to Vintage Enterprises, Inc. to produce the broadcasts for various television networks under the network&#x27;s Vintage Sports brand. The PBA on Vintage Sports was first aired on BBC in 1982 and 1983. This is then followed by MBS, later renamed to People&#x27;s Television Network (PTV), from 1984 until 1995. Vintage&#x27;s last stint came with the Intercontinental Broadcasting Corporation (IBC), which broadcast the PBA from 1996 until 1999. In 1997 and 1998, ESPN Asia also aired PBA games in a &quot;parallel broadcast&quot;.

===2000–2011===

Vintage would go on to be acquired by Viva Entertainment in 1999. From 2000 until 2002, PBA games were aired under the PBA on Viva TV branding but remained on IBC. IBC would then join forces with the National Broadcasting Network (NBN; PTV&#x27;s previous identity from 2001 to 2011) in 2003, but the former would drop out the same year in October.

For the 2004–05 season, the PBA awarded the broadcast rights to the Associated Broadcasting Company (ABC), which would go on to become what is now known as TV5 in August 2008. The 2007–08 season would also be the last season of ABC/TV5&#x27;s first stint with the league. Solar Entertainment Corporation then won a bid for the league&#x27;s broadcasting rights, which saw the network split the games between C/S 9 (later renamed to Solar TV and Basketball TV). In February 2011, Solar was looking to find a new broadcast partner, thus for the remainder of its contract, ABS-CBN&#x27;s sister channel Studio 23 would be broadcasting the two remaining conferences of the 2010–11 season.

===2011–present===

After the expiration of Solar&#x27;s contract, TV5 became the league&#x27;s broadcast partner once again. It first began under the AKTV programming block of IBC in the 2011–12 season and would run until the 2013 Commissioner&#x27;s Cup due to the expiration of a blocktime agreement between MediaQuest Holdings (owner of TV5) and IBC. Although IBC would go on to also broadcast the 2013 Governors&#x27; Cup with TV5 broadcasting the Finals of both Commissioner&#x27;s and Governors&#x27; Cups. AksyonTV simulcasted TV5&#x27;s coverage for the 2013–14 and 2014–15 seasons, followed by Hyper beginning in January 2016 and ending with the 2016 Commissioner&#x27;s Cup. From 2013 until 2016, select games were also simulcasted on Fox Sports Asia.

Shortly after the opening of the 2016 Governors&#x27; Cup, PBA Rush was launched, which is a PBA-dedicated cable channel that features game simulcasts and replays as well as its own dedicated programming. Sports5 then partnered with ESPN to broadcast games on the newly created ESPN5 channel ahead of the 2017 Governors&#x27; Cup Finals.

Beginning with the 2023–24 season, TV5 has partnered up with multiple networks to broadcast the PBA games as TV5 President Guido Zaballero stated that the channel began shifting its focus on entertainment and news programs such as the Korean dramas &quot;Revolutionary Love&quot; and &quot;Diary of a Prosecutor&quot;. The PBA entered into an acquired agreement with ZOE Broadcasting Network and ABS-CBN Corporation to air the league&#x27;s games on A2Z starting November 5, 2023, until February 11, 2024. TV5 Network, Inc. entered into an acquired agreement with Nine Media Corporation (NMC) to broadcast the selected PBA games on CNN Philippines every Saturday and Sunday beginning in January 2024, a deal that was cut short due to the network&#x27;s shut at the end of that month. 

====Current broadcasters====
ESPN5 would be renamed to its current form One Sports for the PBA&#x27;s 2020 season, giving the league its own current branding, PBA on One Sports. Following the shut down of CNN Philippines at the end of January, RPTV took over all live broadcasts, weekdays and weekends, beginning in February.

=== Streaming and radio ===
TV5&#x27;s stint brought the PBA into the streaming scene. The PBA games can be viewed on Smart LiveStream, Cignal Play, Pilipinas Live, and iWantTFC. The worldwide broadcast for PBA on TV5 is also aired on Kapatid Channel and AksyonTV International. Radio broadcast are being aired on Radyo Pilipinas 2 (DZSR) selected provincial stations of the Presidential Broadcasting Service.

==Administration==

The league is currently headed by a Commissioner, and the Chairman of the PBA Board of Governors. The Commissioner handles the marketing and administration aspects as well as the technical, game related concerns of the PBA and its developmental league. The Chairman of the PBA Board of Governors is elected, together with the Vice Chairman and Board Treasurer before the start of the season among each of the league&#x27;s representatives to the board.

By tradition, from 1994 to 2017, the incumbent Vice Chairman and Treasurer will assume the Chairmanship and the Vice-Chairmanship respectively the following season.

<doc id="364164" wikidata="Q7771583" url="?curid=364164" title="Units (band)">
<text>Units were an American synthpunk band that was founded in San Francisco in 1978. It was active until 1984. They were one of America&#x27;s earliest electronic new wave bands, and have been cited (along with The Screamers and Suicide) as pioneers of synthpunk, also retrospectively known as &quot;electropunk&quot;. The Units were notable for their use of synthesizers in place of guitars, and multimedia performances featuring multiple projections of satirical, instructional films critical of conformity and consumerism.

==History==
The Units was one of the most popular bands of the San Francisco punk and performance art scene during the late 1970s and early 1980s, headlining at the Mabuhay Gardens (aka The Fab Mab), The Savoy Tivoli, The Berkeley Square, The Deaf Club, Valencia Tool &amp; Die, Geary Theater and other punk clubs. The Units also opened for such bands as Soft Cell, Gary Numan, Ultravox, XTC, Bow Wow Wow, the Psychedelic Furs, the Police, Iggy Pop, Dead Kennedys, Sparks and toured the United States with Orchestral Manoeuvres in the Dark.

Notable performance art appearances included &quot;Punk Under Glass&quot;, where the Units performed in the windows of the JC Penney building in downtown San Francisco, as part of a two-day art installation, and the Labat / Chapman Fight at Kezar Pavilion, a performance art boxing match between two artists where the Units played the national anthem.

The Units&#x27; DIY, self stamped, 7” EP entitled “Units” was released in 1979. It was followed by another record in early 1980, &quot;Warm Moving Bodies&quot;/&quot;iNight&quot;. The Units&#x27; first album, &quot;Digital Stimulation&quot;, was released in 1980, and was the first album released by 415 Records.

In 1982, the Units released a single on UpRoar Records entitled &quot;The Right Man&quot;. The song was recorded at the Different Fur recording studio, founded by the electronic music composer Patrick Gleeson. The recording was produced by Michael Cotten, the synthesizer player of The Tubes. The song went to number 18 on &quot;Billboard&quot;&#x27;s Dance Chart and stayed on the chart for 13 weeks.

After the success of &quot;The Right Man&quot;, the Units signed with Epic/CBS Records and produced a music video for &quot;A Girl Like You&quot; that went into medium rotation on early MTV. They released an EP titled &quot;New Way to Move&quot; on Epic Records, but typical of a hard-luck recording career, the Units&#x27; second album — produced by Bill Nelson for Epic/CBS - remained unissued, until a posthumous release in 2016.

In 1984, after recording the sound and music for the artist Tony Oursler’s film &quot;EVOL&quot;, Ryser and Webber moved to New York, putting an effective end to the Units.

==Visual and multimedia components==
The film &quot;Unit Training Film#1&quot;, produced by Scott Ryser and Rachel Webber, compiled from films the band projected during performances, was shown sans band in movie theaters around the San Francisco Bay Area, including the Roxie Cinema, San Francisco Cinematheque, The Intersection, and the Mill Valley Film Festival.

==Critical response==
Alternative press publisher V. Vale called the Units &quot;the first San Francisco band to perform using no guitars&quot;, The Units were referred to as &quot;Punks playing keyboards&quot; in an article in &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; in 1979, and the Los Angeles music critic Kickboy Face of the fanzine &quot;Slash&quot; wrote of a Units performance, &quot;That night, watching the Units pound their machines into submission, I knew that another clichéd concept of mine was biting the dust once and for all. I also knew that there probably was a future to rock n roll after all, and that future did not necessarily include anything resembling guitars.&quot;

==Later releases==
In 2005, Ryser signed a licensing contract with EMI. Once again, the recordings were not released. In 2007, the record label Golden Goose released a 12&quot; remix of &quot;High Pressure Days&quot; by DJ Garth. In the same year, the Italian record label, Mediane, released &quot;Daniele Baldelli – Cosmic - The Original&quot;, a double album that included the original and remixed versions of The Units &quot;The Right Man&quot;.

In 2009, the Community Library label released a 21-song compilation album by the Units entitled &quot;The History of The Units&quot; that included a booklet &quot;The Unit Training Manual&quot;. In June that year, a 12&quot; single of &quot;High Pressure Days&quot; was released on the German label Relish with remixes alongside the original version.

In February 2010, a 12&quot; EP was released on the UK label Hungry Beat Recordings including Rory Phillips remix of &quot;High Pressure Days&quot;. The same month, Phillips&#x27;s remix of &quot;High Pressure Days&quot; was included on a compilation, &quot;Mylo – The Return Of Mylo&quot; on the Mixmag label. The CD was also on the cover of &quot;Mixmag&quot; magazine. Similarly, Rough Trade Records included &quot;High Pressure Days&quot; on their &quot;Counter Culture 09&quot; double album.

In April 2011, The Dark Entries music label from San Francisco released &quot;Bart - Bay Area Retrograde (Vol. 1)&quot;, a 12&quot; compilation that included &quot;Mission&quot;. An EP was released on the French label Robsoul Recordings, which included two remixes of &quot;High Pressure Days&quot; by Phil Weeks.

In 2011 The Opilec Music label from Italy released &quot;The Units - Connections&quot;, a triple boxed set of 25 songs written by The Units, that were remixed by over 40 international DJs, producers and bands from 13 different countries, including Electro Italo Disco pioneers Daniele Baldelli, Klein + M.B.O., N.O.I.A. and Alexander Robotnick. It included a download card of extra tracks for a total of 52 remixed songs of The Units.

In 2012, The Opilec Music label from Italy released an EP. with three songs written by The Units and remixed by Todd Terje from Norway and I-Robots from Italy. The same year, The Opilec Music label from Italy released two songs by The Units on the &quot;We Are Opilec&quot; compilation. Also the Tsugi Sampler label from France released the &quot;Ivan Smagghe – A Walk In The Woods With Ivan Smagghe&quot; that included a remix of &quot;High Pressure Days&quot; by Todd Terje.

In 2013, The Units are included (two songs performed live) in a film &quot;The Seven Deadly Synths&quot;, along with six other synthesizer bands including Suicide, Sun Ra, and Our Daughter&#x27;s Wedding.

In 2015, Futurismo Records from London, re-released the UNITS original album from 1980, &quot;Digital Stimulation&quot; on vinyl and CD, including a live set at Mabuhay Gardens.

In 2016, Futurismo released &quot;Animals They Dream About&quot;, the band&#x27;s previously unreleased second album originally recorded in 1982, including a live set from the Kabuki theater in San Francisco in which The Units opened for Bow Wow Wow.

In 2016, FDH records from Philadelphia, PA re-released The Units original debut EP from 1979, the hand stamped 7&quot; four song e.p. entitled &quot;UNITS&quot;, including a download of a 1979 live set at the Deaf Club.
In 2019, founding band member Scott Ryser self-released a 12-track album of new and re-worked original material entitled &quot;Flying Away&quot;, which included a new version of &quot;Cannibals&quot;, a song from the band&#x27;s 1980 debut LP, as well as new recordings of songs the band performed live in the 1980s, but had never made studio recordings of.

In 2020, on the occasion of the 40th Anniversary of the release of the &quot;Digital Stimulation&quot; album, Scott Ryser worked with California-based recording artist Kit Watson to remix all of the album tracks from the original multi-track recordings. It included previously unreleased instrumental mixes of those songs which originally had vocals, live recordings of two songs performed at Mabuhay Gardens in San Francisco in 1980, and a new extended remix of the title track by Kit Watson.

In 2022, Futurismo once again re-released &quot;Digital Stimulation&quot; in a newly-designed package which included all of the remastered original album tracks along with a 12-page art booklet containing rare imagery and new liner notes, and a CD of the 2020 remix. It was made available in two vinyl colors as well as a limited edition audio cassette.

==Influence and cultural significance==
Outsider musician Jandek&#x27;s first album, &quot;Ready for the House&quot;, though a solo work, was originally credited to a &#x27;The Units&#x27;. Jandek was forced to change the name by The Units, who possessed a trademark on the name, after Scott Ryser from The Units wrote Smith a letter with documentation. All reissues of the album and all subsequent releases have been credited to &#x27;Jandek&#x27;.

Songs written by the Units have been covered or remixed by over 50 international DJs, producers and bands from 13 different countries.

==Members==

Other various members that played live shows and toured with The Units included Brad Saunders, Tim Ennis, Ron Lantz, Richard Driskell, Lx Rudis, Seth Miller, Jon Parker, David Allen Jr., Jabari Allen, Marc Henry, James Reynolds, Raymond Froehlich, D.C.

<doc id="364171" wikidata="Q5508059" url="?curid=364171" title="Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship">
<text>The Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship(FGBCF) or Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship International(FGBCFI) is a predominantly African-American, Charismatic Baptist denomination established by Bishop Paul Sylvester Morton—a Gospel singer and former National Baptist pastor. Founded as a response to traditional black Baptists upholding cessationism, Full Gospel Baptists advocate for the operation of Pentecostal/Charismatic Christian spiritual gifts, while also holding to traditional Baptist doctrine.

Reminiscing early Baptist Christianity&#x27;s acceptance of the bishopric being synonymous with the pastorate within congregationalist tenets per the 1689 Baptist Confession of Faith (as Baptists originated in 1609 from the Church of England, which schismed with the Roman Church—both upholding the historic episcopacy), Full Gospel Baptists developed a presbyteral-episcopal polity not found in the historic black Baptist denominations while maintaining congregationalist distinctives.

The FGBCF was reported to have over 10,000 active members in 1993 and 20,000 in 1995; in 1997 it claimed 1 million members and 5,000 churches throughout the United States. As of 2020, they reported having approximately 2 million members; in 2023, Full Gospel Baptists had approximately 10,000 churches. Churches aligned with Full Gospel Baptists may affiliate with other Christian denominations, and aren&#x27;t required to change their names. Headquartered in Atlanta, Georgia, the Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship is led by Bishop Joseph W. Walker III, of Nashville, Tennessee as the Full Gospel Presiding Bishop, who was appointed to succeed Bishop Morton upon his retirement.

==History==
The Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship was established by Bishop Paul S. Morton Sr. in 1994 within New Orleans, Louisiana, though it began as a movement within the National Baptist Convention, USA in 1992. From 25,000 to 30,000 attended the first conference of the Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship in 1994.

Exploring the gifts of the Holy Spirit against traditionally cessationist Baptist pastors and laymen within the National Baptist Convention, National Baptist Convention of America, and the Progressive National Baptist Convention, alongside establishing an episcopal Baptist governance, Morton and those affiliated with the fellowship &quot;were lovingly advised to resign their posts with the NBCUSA before they were kicked out.&quot; National Baptist leadership feared the movement would develop into a separate denomination, urging members to either remain within the convention or leave; the National Baptist Convention&#x27;s then-president, Rev. Henry J. Lyons, disapproved of the movement&#x27;s belief in tongues and divine healing. In 1995, Bishop Morton left the National Baptist Convention, USA following the controversies among traditional black Baptists.

Attracting some of the largest churches by membership from the oldest black Baptist denomination—the NBC USA—New Birth Missionary Baptist Church became a notable affiliate before leaving the fellowship during Bishop Eddie Long&#x27;s pastoral tenure after multiple controversies surrounding their leadership at New Birth. Eddie Long was consecrated a bishop by Paul Morton in the 1994.

In 2013, Bishop Morton announced his intent to resign as Presiding Bishop of the Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship. He appointed Bishop Joseph W. Walker III in Nashville, Tennessee as successor. Walker, born in Shreveport, Louisiana and serving as one of the founding fathers of the Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship, assumed presiding office in 2015 and Bishop Neil Ellis schismed through establishing the Global United Fellowship after resigning and losing the election to succeed Morton.

==Doctrine==
Like most Baptist denominations, Full Gospel Baptists uphold believer&#x27;s baptism by full immersion; soul competency; &quot;sola fide&quot;; and congregational autonomy. However, in addition to traditional Baptist doctrine, the fellowship also believes in Pentecostal-Charismatic doctrines such as speaking in tongues, laying on of hands, divine healing, and prophecy. Likewise, the Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship places special emphasis on practicing holiness, or Christian sanctification; overall, their theological distinctives tend to merge with the separate Protestant tradition of Wesleyan-Arminian theology.

Full Gospel Baptists ordain and consecrate a significant number of female pastors and bishops as well, although the majority of their clergy is still male. Its women clergy operate an organization called the Daughters of the Promise, or Full Gospel International Women&#x27;s Fellowship.

Embracing a mixture of congregationalist, presbyterian, and episcopal polity, Full Gospel Baptists as a collective are governed by the Full Gospel Baptist Council of Bishops. The presiding bishop is the head clerical and executive leader of the fellowship, exercising authority along with other episcopates to provide administration. Within the Full Gospel Baptist Church Fellowship, its bishops claim apostolic succession through Bishop Morton&#x27;s consecrator, the excommunicated Roman Catholic George Augustus Stallings. Stallings consecrated Morton in March 1993. Relieved of religious duties within the Roman Catholic Church, the concept of &quot;valid but illicit&quot; ordinations guaranteed Stallings episcopacy remaining valid to whoever recognized it as such. Apostolic succession though, according to Roman and Anglican churches however, effects the power and authority to administer the sacraments except for baptism and matrimony; and it pertains to continuity of the universal teaching, preaching, governing, ordination, and grace.

<text>The Constitution of the Empire of Japan (Kyūjitai: ; Shinjitai: , ), known informally as the Meiji Constitution (, &quot;Meiji Kenpō&quot;), was the constitution of the Empire of Japan which was proclaimed on February 11, 1889, and remained in force between November 29, 1890, and May 2, 1947. Enacted after the Meiji Restoration in 1868, it provided for a form of mixed constitutional and absolute monarchy, based jointly on the German and British models. In theory, the Emperor of Japan governed the empire with the advice of his ministers; in practice, the Emperor was head of state but the Prime Minister was the actual head of government. Under the Meiji Constitution, the Prime Minister and his Cabinet were not necessarily chosen from the elected members of parliament.

During the Allied occupation of Japan, the Meiji Constitution was replaced with the &quot;Postwar Constitution&quot; on November 3, 1946; the latter document has been in force since May 3, 1947. In order to maintain legal continuity, the Postwar Constitution was enacted as an amendment to the Meiji Constitution.

==Overview==
The Meiji Restoration in 1868 provided Japan a form of constitutional monarchy based on the Prusso-German model, in which the Emperor of Japan was an active ruler and wielded considerable political power over foreign policy and diplomacy which was shared with an elected Imperial Diet. The Diet primarily dictated domestic policy matters.

After the Meiji Restoration, which restored direct political power to the emperor for the first time in over a millennium, Japan underwent a period of sweeping political and social reform and westernization aimed at strengthening Japan to the level of the nations of the Western world. The immediate consequence of the Constitution was the opening of the first Parliamentary government in Asia.

The Meiji Constitution established clear limits on the power of the executive branch and the Emperor. It also created an independent judiciary. Civil rights and civil liberties were allowed, though they were freely subject to limitation by law. Free speech, freedom of association and freedom of religion were all limited by laws. The leaders of the government and the political parties were left with the task of interpretation as to whether the Meiji Constitution could be used to justify authoritarian or liberal-democratic rule. It was the struggle between these tendencies that dominated the government of the Empire of Japan. Franchise was limited, with only 1.1% of the population eligible to vote for the Diet. Universal manhood suffrage was not established (under law) until the General Election Law, which gave every male aged 25 and over a voting right, was enacted in 1925.

The Meiji Constitution was used as a model for the 1931 Constitution of Ethiopia by the Ethiopian intellectual Tekle Hawariat Tekle Mariyam. This was one of the reasons why the progressive Ethiopian intelligentsia associated with Tekle Hawariat were known as &quot;Japanizers&quot;.

By the surrender in the World War II on September 2, 1945, the Empire of Japan was deprived of sovereignty by the Allies, and the Meiji Constitution was suspended. During the Occupation of Japan, the Meiji Constitution was replaced by a new document, the postwar Constitution of Japan. This document replaced imperial rule with a form of Western-style liberal democracy. To preserve legal continuity, these changes were enacted as a constitutional amendment per Article 73 of the Meiji Constitution. After garnering the required two-thirds majority in both chambers, it received imperial assent on November 3, 1946, and took effect on May 3, 1947.

==History==
===Background===
Prior to the adoption of the Meiji Constitution, Japan had in practice no written constitution. Originally, a Chinese-inspired legal system and constitution known as &quot;ritsuryō&quot; was enacted in the 6th century (in the late Asuka period and early Nara period); it described a government based on an elaborate and theoretically rational meritocratic bureaucracy, serving under the ultimate authority of the emperor and organised following Chinese models. In theory the last &quot;ritsuryō&quot; code, the Yōrō Code enacted in 752, was still in force at the time of the Meiji Restoration.

However, in practice the &quot;ritsuryō&quot; system of government had become largely an empty formality as early as in the middle of the Heian period in the 10th and 11th centuries, a development which was completed by the establishment of the Kamakura Shogunate in 1185. The high positions in the &quot;ritsuryō&quot; system remained as , and the emperor was de-powered and set aside as a symbolic figure who &quot;reigned, but did not rule&quot; (on the theory that the living god should not have to defile himself with matters of earthly government).

The Charter Oath was promulgated on 6 April 1868, which outlined the fundamental policies of the government and demanded the establishment of deliberative assemblies, but it did not determine the details. The idea of a written constitution had been a subject of heated debate within and without the government since the beginnings of the Meiji government. The conservative Meiji oligarchy viewed anything resembling democracy or republicanism with suspicion and trepidation, and favored a gradualist approach. The Freedom and People&#x27;s Rights Movement demanded the immediate establishment of an elected national assembly, and the promulgation of a constitution.

===Drafting===
On October 21, 1881, Itō Hirobumi was appointed to chair a government bureau to research various forms of constitutional government, and in 1882, Itō led an overseas mission to observe and study various systems first-hand. The United States Constitution was rejected as too liberal. The French and Spanish models were rejected as tending toward despotism. The Reichstag and legal structures of the German Empire, particularly that of Prussia, proved to be of the most interest to the Constitutional Study Mission. Influence was also drawn from the British Westminster system, although it was considered as being unwieldy and granting too much power to Parliament.

He also rejected some notions as unfit for Japan, as they stemmed from European constitutional practice and Christianity. He therefore added references to the kokutai or &quot;national polity&quot; as the justification of the emperor&#x27;s authority through his divine descent and the unbroken line of emperors, and the unique relationship between subject and sovereign.

The Council of State was replaced in 1885 with a cabinet headed by Itō as Prime Minister. The positions of Chancellor, Minister of the Left, and Minister of the Right, which had existed since the seventh century, were abolished. In their place, the Privy Council was established in 1888 to evaluate the forthcoming constitution, and to advise Emperor Meiji.

The draft committee included Inoue Kowashi, Kaneko Kentarō, Itō Miyoji and Iwakura Tomomi, along with a number of foreign advisors, in particular the German legal scholars Rudolf von Gneist and Lorenz von Stein. The central issue was the balance between sovereignty vested in the person of the Emperor, and an elected representative legislature with powers that would limit or restrict the power of the sovereign. After numerous drafts from 1886 to 1888, the final version was submitted to Emperor Meiji in April 1888. The Meiji Constitution was drafted in secret by the committee, without public debate.

===Promulgation===

The new constitution was promulgated by Emperor Meiji on February 11, 1889 (the anniversary of the National Foundation Day of Japan in 660 BC), but came into effect on November 29, 1890. The first National Diet of Japan, a new representative assembly, convened on the day the Meiji Constitution came into force. The organizational structure of the Diet reflected both Prussian and British influences, most notably in the inclusion of the House of Representatives as the lower house (existing currently, under the Article 42 of the post-war Japanese Constitution based on bicameralism) and the House of Peers as the upper house, (which resembled the Prussian &quot;Herrenhaus&quot; and the British House of Lords, now the House of Councillors of Japan under the Article 42 of the post-war Japanese Constitution based on bicameralism), and in the formal Speech from the Throne delivered by the Emperor on Opening Day (existing currently, under the Article 7 of the post-war Japanese Constitution). The second chapter of the constitution, detailing the rights of citizens, bore a resemblance to similar articles in both European and North American constitutions of the day.

==Main provisions==
===Structure===
The Meiji Constitution consists of 76 articles in seven chapters, together amounting to around 2,500 words. It is also usually reproduced with its Preamble, the Imperial Oath Sworn in the Sanctuary in the Imperial Palace, and the Imperial Rescript on the Promulgation of the Constitution, which together come to nearly another 1,000 words. The seven chapters are:

*I. The Emperor (1–17)
*II. Rights and Duties of Subjects (18–32)
*III. The Imperial Diet (33–54)
*IV. The Ministers of State and the Privy Council (55–56)
*V. The Judicature (57–61)
*VI. Finance (62–72)
*VII. Supplementary Rules (73–76)

===Imperial sovereignty===

Unlike its modern successor, the Meiji Constitution was founded on the principle that sovereignty resided in person of the Emperor, by virtue of his divine ancestry referenced in Article 1, stating &quot;The Empire of Japan shall be reigned over and governed by a line of Emperors unbroken for ages eternal.&quot;, rather than in the people. This is reinforced by Article 3 and 4 which state that, &quot;The Emperor is sacred and inviolable&quot; and, &quot;The Emperor is the head of the Empire, combining in himself the rights of sovereignty&quot;, respectively. The Emperor, nominally at least, united within himself all three branches (executive, legislative and judiciary) of government, although legislation (article 5) and the budget (article 64) were subject to the &quot;consent of the Imperial Diet&quot;. Laws were issued and justice administered by the courts &quot;in the name of the Emperor&quot;.

Rules on the succession of the imperial throne and on the Imperial household were left outside the Constitution; instead, a separate Act on the Imperial household (&quot;koshitu tenpan&quot;) was adopted. This Act was not publicly promulgated, because it was seen as a private Act of the Imperial household rather than a public law.

Separate provisions of the Constitution are contradictory as to whether the Constitution or the Emperor is supreme.

*Article 3 declares him to be &quot;sacred and inviolable&quot;, a formula which was construed by hard-line monarchists to mean that he retained the right to withdraw the constitution, or to ignore its provisions.
*Article 4 binds the Emperor to exercise his powers &quot;according to the provisions of the present Constitution&quot;.
*Article 11 declares that the Emperor commands the army and navy. The heads of these services interpreted this to mean &quot;The army and navy obey &quot;only&quot; the Emperor, and do not have to obey the cabinet and diet&quot;, which caused political controversy.
*Article 55, however, confirmed that the Emperor&#x27;s commands (including Imperial Ordinance, Edicts, Rescripts, etc.) had no legal force within themselves, but required the signature of a &quot;Minister of State&quot;. On the other hand, these &quot;Ministers of State&quot; were appointed by (and could be dismissed by), the Emperor alone, and not by the Prime Minister or the Diet.

===Rights and duties of subjects===
*Duties: The constitution asserts the duty of Japanese subjects to uphold the constitution (preamble), pay taxes (Article 21) and serve in the armed forces if conscripted (Article 20).
*Qualified rights: The constitution provides for a number of rights that subjects may enjoy where the law does not provide otherwise. These included the right to:
**Freedom of movement (Article 22).
**Not have one&#x27;s house searched or entered (Article 25).
**Privacy of correspondence (Article 26).
**Private property (Article 27).
**Freedom of speech, assembly and association (Article 29).
*Less conditional rights
**Right to &quot;be appointed to civil or military or any other public offices equally&quot; (Article 19).
**&#x27;Procedural&#x27; due process (Article 23).
**Right to trial before a judge (Article 24).
**Freedom of religion (Guaranteed by Article 28 &quot;within limits not prejudicial to peace and order, and not antagonistic to their duties as subjects&quot;). 
**Right to petition government (Article 30).

===Organs of government===
The Emperor of Japan had the right to exercise executive authority, and to appoint and dismiss all government officials. The Emperor also had the sole rights to declare war, make peace, conclude treaties, dissolve the lower house of Diet, and issue Imperial ordinances in place of laws when the Diet was not in session. Most importantly, command over the Imperial Japanese Army and Imperial Japanese Navy was directly held by the Emperor, and not the Diet. The Meiji Constitution provided for a cabinet consisting of Ministers of State who answered to the Emperor rather than the Diet, and to the establishment of the Privy Council. Not mentioned in the Constitution were the &quot;genrō&quot;, an inner circle of advisors to the Emperor, who wielded considerable influence.

Under the Meiji Constitution, a legislature, the Diet, was established with two houses. The Upper House, or House of Peers consisted of members of the Imperial Family, hereditary peerage and members appointed by the Emperor. The Lower House, or House of Representatives was directly elected by all males who paid at least 15 yen in property taxes, effectively limiting the suffrage to 1.1 percent of the population. These qualifications were loosened in 1900 and 1919 with universal adult male suffrage introduced in 1925. The Emperor shared legislative authority with the Diet, and no measure could become law without the agreement of the Emperor and the Diet. On the other hand, the Diet was given the authority to initiate legislation, approve all laws, and approve the budget.

==Amendments==
Amendments to the constitution were provided for by Article 73. This stipulated that, to become law, a proposed amendment had to be submitted first to the Diet by the Emperor through an imperial order or rescript. To be approved by the Diet, an amendment had to be adopted in both chambers by a two-thirds majority of the total number of members of each (rather than merely two-thirds of the total number of votes cast). Once it had been approved by the Diet, an amendment was then promulgated into law by the Emperor, who had an absolute right of veto. No amendment to the constitution was permitted during the time of a regency. Despite these provisions, no amendments were made to the imperial constitution from the time it was adopted until its demise in 1947. The present constitution is legally reckoned as an amendment to the Meiji Constitution; this was done to preserve legal continuity even though it is a completely new document.

However, according to Article 73 of the Meiji Constitution, the amendment should be authorized by the Emperor. Indeed, the 1947 Constitution was authorized by the Emperor (as was declared in the letter of promulgation), which is in apparent conflict of the 1947 Constitution, according to which that constitution was made and authorized by the nation (&quot;the principle of popular sovereignty&quot;). To dissipate such inconsistencies, some peculiar doctrine of &quot;August Revolution&quot; was proposed by Toshiyoshi Miyazawa of the University of Tokyo, but without much persuasiveness.

<text>Wu Sangui (; 8 June 1612 – 2 October 1678), courtesy name Changbai () or Changbo (), was a Chinese military leader who played a key role in the fall of the Ming dynasty and the founding of the Qing dynasty. In Chinese folklore, Wu Sangui is regarded as a disreputable Han Chinese traitor for his defection over to the Manchu invaders, suppression of the Southern Ming resistance and execution of the Yongli Emperor. Wu eventually double-crossed both of his masters, the Ming and the Qing dynasties.

In 1644, Wu was a Ming general in charge of garrisoning Shanhai Pass, the strategic choke point between Manchuria and Beijing. After learning that Li Zicheng&#x27;s rebel army had conquered Beijing and captured his family, including his father Wu Xiang and concubine Chen Yuanyuan, Wu allowed the Manchu to enter China proper through Shanhai Pass to drive Li from Beijing, where the Manchu then set up the Qing dynasty. For his aid, the Qing rulers awarded him a fiefdom consisting of Yunnan and Guizhou provinces, along with the title &quot;Prince Who Pacifies the West&quot; (平西王).

In 1674, Wu decided to rebel against the Qing. In 1678, Wu declared himself the new Emperor of China and the ruler of Zhou, only to die within months. For a time, his grandson Wu Shifan succeeded him. The revolt was quelled in 1681.

==Early years==
Wu was born in Suizhong, Liaoxi province, in Northeastern China, to Wu Xiang and Lady Zu. His ancestral home was Gaoyou, Jiangsu. Wu Sangui&#x27;s father and uncle had fought in many battles. Under their influence, Wu took great interest in war and politics at an early age. He was also a student of artist Dong Qichang. Late Ming dynasty historians left behind records describing Wu Sangui as a valiant and handsome general of medium height, with pale skin, a straight nose, and big ears, with a scar on his nose. He possessed excellent skills in horse-riding and archery.

In 1627, the Chongzhen Emperor decided to reinstate the imperial examination system on his accession to the throne, and Wu became a first-degree military scholar (&quot;juren&quot;) at the age of fifteen. He and his two brothers joined the army, garrisoning the Daling River and Ningyuan in the army of general Zu Dashou.

In 1630, while gathering information about the enemy, Wu&#x27;s father, Wu Xiang, was encircled by the Qing troops. Wu Sangui was denied help from his maternal uncle, Zu Dashou, and so decided to rescue his father with a force of about 20 soldiers chosen from his personal retinue. Wu Sangui and his small cavalry force charged into the enemy encirclement, killing the Manchu general and saved Wu Xiang. Both Hong Taiji and Zu were impressed by Wu&#x27;s valour, and Zu recommended Wu&#x27;s promotion. Wu Sangui gained the position of guerrilla general when he was no older than 20.

== Service under the Ming dynasty ==

=== Garrisoning Liaodong ===
In 1632, the Ming court transferred the Liaodong army to Shandong, to defeat the rebel armies of Kong Youde. Wu, who was 22 years old, served as a guerrilla general and fought side by side with his father, Wu Xiang. Wu rose to the rank of deputy general and was promoted to full general in September of that year. In September 1638, Wu served as a deputy general again.

At the beginning of 1639, as the situation in Liaodong became increasingly tense, the Ming court transferred general Hong Chengchou as the governor-general () of Jiliao; Hong appointed Wu as the general in charge of training.

In October 1639, a Qing army of more than 10,000 men, commanded by Duoduo and Haoge, invaded Ningyuan. Jin Guofeng, full general of Ningyuan, immediately led troops to confront the Qing army but was surrounded and killed. Wu took Jin&#x27;s place as full general of Ningyuan, and became a guardian general of Liaodong.

After Wu served as the full general in Ningyuan, he made the local army the strongest in Liaodong, having 20,000 troops at Ningyuan town. To enhance their combat power, Wu selected 1,000 elite soldiers to form a fearless battalion. The battalion was trained and commanded by Wu himself, making these men his bodyguard who would come at Wu&#x27;s call at any time. They were the core of his army and laid the foundation for Wu&#x27;s military achievements.

In March 1640, Hong Taiji appointed Jirgalang and Duoduo as left and right commander, respectively, marching towards the north of Jinzhou. Aiming to besiege Jinzhou, they reestablished Yizhou, garrisoned the troops, opened up wasteland, grew food grain, and forbade any cultivation in the Ningjin area outside Shanhai Pass.

=== Battle of Xingshan ===
On 18 May 1640, Wu Sangui met the Qing army in battle at Xingshan. Jirgalang led 1,500 soldiers to accept the surrender of the Mongolian people, but they were spotted by general Liu Zhaoji when passing the Ming army. Liu Zhaoji led 3,000 soldiers against the Qing army. At that time, Wu Sangui was stationed in Songshan and brought a 3,000-strong force the moment he heard the news. From Jinzhou, Zu Dashou sent more than 700 soldiers as a reserve. At first, the Ming army seemed more powerful with superior numbers; but, after the pursuit of Jiamashan, the Qing army was able to surround Wu Sangui.

Wu Sangui was unable to withstand the repeated attacks from both Jirgalang and Duoduo. He fought a bloody battle with the Qing army, but could not break through the siege until Liu Zhaoji came to his rescue. The Ming army casualties were more than 1000, with deputy general Yanglun and Zhou Yanzhou dead, but Wu Sangui&#x27;s bravery was still praised.

=== Battle of Songjin ===
On 25 April 1641, the battle of Songjin began with an attack by the Ming army, Wu Sangui leading and personally killing ten enemies, defeating the Qing cavalry. After the battle, Wu Sangui was regarded as its most outstanding general.

In June 1641, Hong Chengchou and Wu Sangui returned to Songshan and garrisoned the northwest area. Prince Zheng Jirgalang attacked several times towards Songshan and Xinshan but was defeated repeatedly, the Ming army succeeding in surrounding the Qing army four times. Though the Qing army finally broke through the encirclement, their casualties were very high. Due to Wu Sangui&#x27;s bravery, the Ming army remained on the offensive, but it also paid a heavy price.

On 20 August 1641, the Ming army attacked the Qing camp. The battle lasted the whole day, and the result was too close to call. However, Prince Ajige unexpectedly captured the Ming army&#x27;s provisions in Bijia Mountain, significantly undermining their ability to fight. The battle continued on 21 August, and was unfavourable to the Ming army. After this defeat Datong full general Wang Pu lost the will to fight. Before Hong Chengchou issued orders, Wang fled with his troops, which completely disrupted the original breakthrough plan. More surprisingly, Wu Sangui also fled in the chaos, escaping on Wang&#x27;s heel. At such a life-or-death moment, Wu revealed selfishness.

The Ming army attempted to withdraw, pursued by the Qing. In a matter of a few days, more than 53,000 people and 7,400 horses of the Ming army were killed. They had no way to flee and no will to fight. Only 30,000 survived after fleeing back to Ningyuan.

Wu Sangui survived not only by following Wang Pu, but by having a good retreat plan. When Hong Chengchou ordered the breakthrough, Wu Sangui went back to his camp and immediately discussed tactics with his generals. They decided to give up the small path and flee on the main road. As expected, the Qing army had only cut off the small path, while no more than 400 soldiers held the main road under Hong Taiji. Seeing Wu Sangui&#x27;s fierce charge, Hong Taiji restrained his army from pursuing. Hong thought highly of Wu, and considered gaining his favor as the key to conquering the dynasty.

The breakthrough at Songshan resulted in the deaths of 52,000 members of the Ming elite army, which greatly wounded the Ming dynasty. Wu and Wang Pu could not escape the fate of being punished for fleeing and avoiding combat and were sentenced to death.

=== Promotion after the defeat ===
A few days later, Wu, who had fled to Ningyuan, received the imperial decree of the Chongzhen emperor. Surprisingly, Wu was promoted above all the full generals. This implied that Wu would not be punished, which was beyond the comprehension of many government officials. Even more surprising was the fact that, months later, when someone in the court called for an investigation to determine responsibility for the Songshan defeat, only Wang Pu was arrested while Wu continued to serve as a governor general of Liaodong, garrisoned in Ningyuan. This caused an outcry in the Ming court.

In May 1642, the result of the Ming court&#x27;s re-examination was the death penalty for Wang Pu, and demotion of three levels in rank for Wu. Wu continued to serve as full general in Ningyuan and was in charge of the training of the Liaodong army.

==Defection to the Qing==

=== Surrender to the Qing dynasty ===
By February 1642, the Ming dynasty had lost four of the eight vital cities beyond Shanhai Pass to the Manchu army. Ningyuan, where Wu was stationed, became Beijing&#x27;s last defence against the Manchu army. Hong Taiji repeatedly attempted to persuade Wu to surrender, to no avail. Wu did not side with the Qing dynasty until after the defensive capability of the Ming dynasty had been greatly weakened with its political apparatus destroyed by the rebel armies of Li Zicheng&#x27;s Shun dynasty.

In early 1644, Li Zicheng, the head of a peasant rebel army, launched his force from Xi&#x27;an for his final offensive northeast toward Beijing. The Chongzhen Emperor decided to abandon Ningyuan and called upon Wu to defend Beijing against the rebels. Wu Sangui received the title &quot;Pingxi Bo&quot; () as he moved to face the peasant army.

At the time of Beijing&#x27;s fall to Li Zicheng, on 25 April 1644, Wu and his 40,000-man army—the most significant Ming fighting force in northern China—were on the way to Beijing to come to the Chongzhen Emperor&#x27;s aid but then received word of the emperor&#x27;s suicide. So they garrisoned Shanhai Pass, the eastern terminus of the main Great Wall instead. Wu and his men were then caught between the rebels within the Great Wall and the Manchus without.

After the collapse of the Ming dynasty, Wu and his army became a vital military force in deciding the fate of China. Both Dorgon and Li Zicheng tried to gain Wu&#x27;s support. Li took a number of measures to secure Wu&#x27;s surrender, granting silver, gold, a dukedom, and most crucially by capturing Wu&#x27;s father, Wu Xiang, and concubine, Chen Yuanyuan, ordering the former to write a letter to persuade Wu to pledge allegiance to Li.

Wu, however, was enraged by Li&#x27;s capture of his family and the looting of Beijing. He killed Li&#x27;s envoy, wrote back to his father, scolding him for his disloyalty, and sent several generals to pretend to pledge allegiance to Li. Aware that his force alone was insufficient to fight Li&#x27;s main army, Wu wrote to the Manchu prince-regent Dorgon for military support, under the condition of restricting the dominance of the Manchus to northern China and the Ming to south. Dorgon replied that the Manchus would help Wu, but Wu would have to submit to the Qing. Wu did not accept at first.

Li Zicheng sent two armies to attack the pass, but Wu&#x27;s battle-hardened troops defeated them easily on 5 and 10 May 1644. In order to secure his position, Li was determined to destroy Wu&#x27;s army. On 18 May, he personally led 60,000 troops out of Beijing to attack Wu. and defeated Wu on 21 May. The next day, Wu wrote to Dorgon for help. Dorgon took the opportunity to force Wu to surrender, and Wu had little choice but to accept. 

On 22 May 1644, Wu opened the gates of the Great Wall of China at Shanhai Pass to let the Qing forces into China proper, forming an alliance with the Manchus. Wu ordered his soldiers to wear white cloths attached to their armour, to distinguish them from Li&#x27;s forces. Together, Wu&#x27;s army and the Qing forces defeated Li&#x27;s main army in the Battle of Shanhai Pass on 27 May 1644. Li retreated to Beijing and took revenge on Wu by executing thirty-eight members of the Wu household, including Wu&#x27;s father, whose head was displayed on the city wall. 

On 3 June, Li held his coronation ceremony in Beijing and fled the next day. The Manchus marched into the Chinese capital unopposed shortly afterward and enthroned the young Shunzhi Emperor in the Forbidden City.

=== Suppressing the rebellion in Shaanxi ===
Wu Sangui pledged allegiance to the Qing dynasty and received the title of &quot;Pingxi Wang&quot; (). However, he remained fearful that the Qing dynasty held him in suspicion.

In October 1644, Wu received orders to suppress the rebel peasant army. At that time, Li Zicheng still held Shaanxi, Hubei, Henan, among others, and was gathering his troops to rise again. Wu, together with Shang Kexi, led his soldiers to Shaanxi under Ajige, the General of Jingyuan appointed by Dorgon. From October to the following August, when he returned to Beijing, Wu fought the peasant army and achieved great success.

In June 1645, Wu Sangui captured Yulin and Yan&#x27;an in Shaanxi province. At the same time Li Zicheng was killed by a village head in Tongshan county, Hubei province.

In 1645, the Qing court rewarded Wu Sangui with the title of &quot;Qin Wang&quot; () and ordered him to garrison Jinzhou. The high-sounding title was belied by transferring Wu to Jinzhou, which had lost its position as a militarily important town and become an insignificant rear area. Moreover, along with a large number of Manchu and Han people migrating into central China, it had become sparsely populated and desolate. Hence, Wu felt perplexed and upset.

On 19 August 1645, before Wu returned to Liaodong from Beijing, he submitted his request to the Qing court to renounce his title as &quot;Qin Wang&quot;. After giving up his title, he began to make efforts to consolidate his strength by demanding troops, territory, compensation, and reward for the generals under his command, which were all granted by the imperial court.

In July 1646, when Wu was summoned by the emperor, the Qing court granted him a total of 10 horses and 20,000 pieces of silver as an extra reward. Wu wasn&#x27;t pleased, however, since he had been set aside since his return to Jinzhou, while the army of Kong Youde, Geng Jingzhong, and Shang Kexi had been fighting against the Southern Ming regime in Hunan and Guangxi since 1646.

=== Suppressing the rebellion in Sichuan ===
In 1648, the rebellion against the Qing dynasty reached its climax. Jiang Xiang, the full general of Datong, waged an insurgency in Shanxi province, while, in the south, in Nanchang and Guangzhou, Jin Shenghuan and Li Chenghong also rebelled, which dramatically changed the military situation.

The rebellion from the surrendered Han generals greatly shocked the Qing dynasty rulers. They came to realize the significant role of these generals to the control of central China, as well as the importance of the strategy of &quot;using Han to rule Han&quot; (以汉制汉). In this situation, Wu thrived again.

At the beginning of 1648, the Qing court ordered Wu to move his family west and garrison Hanzhong with Chief General (Du Tong) of the Eight Banners Moergen and Li Weihan. In less than a year, Wu suppressed the rebellion in most regions of Shaanxi and reversed the situation in the northwest. After four years of struggle, Wu brought peace to Shaanxi and his political star rose in the Qing court.

In 1652, the rebel Daxi army became the main force rebelling against the Qing. The situation was made difficult by the deaths of the Qing generals Kong Youde and Ni Kan, when the rebels Li Dingguo and Liu Wenxiu&#x27;s troops marched into Sichuan province. The Qing court then summoned Wu to suppress the Daxi army in Sichuan. However, Wu was being closely watched by general Li Guohan, a trusted advisor to the imperial court. Wu wasn&#x27;t able to free himself from surveillance until a few years later, when Li died. Hence, Wu enhanced his military strength rapidly by gaining a large number of enemy surrenders.

=== Garrisoning Yunnan ===
In 1660, the Qing army split into three parts to march into Yunnan province and eliminated the Southern Ming regime, thus achieving the preliminary unification of China. Nevertheless, the imperial court still faced a number of serious military and political threats. The Yongli Emperor of the Southern Ming and Li Dingguo of the Daxi army retreated to Burma, and they maintained influence in Yunnan. It was inconvenient for the Eight Banners soldiers to garrison Yunnan&#x27;s border area, which was far away from the capital. As a result, the imperial court approved the proposal by Hong Chengchou to withdraw those soldiers, and give Wu command of the border area. Thus, Wu not only commanded a large army but also controlled vast territory.

In 1661, the green-flag army under Wu numbered 60,000, while Shang Kexi and Geng Jimao had only 7,500 ad 7,000 soldiers in their armies. Wu planned to permanently garrison and was preparing to make the border area his own. However, Yunnan was not stable at that time, for newly surrendered soldiers had not been fully assimilated into the Qing force. Moreover, the Daxi army had been building in Yunnan over decades and shared a close relationship with various minority nationalities. Many Tusi leaders refused to accept the rule of Wu, which led to a series of rebellions. The existence of the Yongli Emperor of the Southern Ming dynasty and Li Dingguo&#x27;s army was regarded as a great threat to Wu. Therefore, Wu was actively preparing for their elimination to consolidate his rule. He exaggerated the rebellion&#x27;s threat, spread rumors and submitted his proposal to the court, urging the invasion of Burma, which, after a time, the imperial court approved.

In June 1662, Wu sent an army into Burma, captured and killed the Yongli Emperor, while Li Dingguo died of illness. In the next few years, Wu led his army from the northwest to the southwest border and enabled the Qing dynasty&#x27;s dominance in that part of the country.

==Revolt against the Qing==
After he defeated the remnant Ming forces in southwestern China, Wu was rewarded by the Qing imperial court with the title of &quot;Pingxi Wang&quot; (平西王; translated as &quot;Prince Who Pacifies the West&quot; or &quot;King Who Pacifies the West&quot;) with a fief in Yunnan. It had been extremely rare for someone outside of the imperial clan, especially a non-Manchu, to be granted the title of &quot;Wang&quot;. Those who were not members of the imperial clan and awarded the title were called &quot;Yixing Wang&quot; ( literally meaning &quot;kings with other family names&quot;) or known as &quot;vassal kings&quot;. These vassal kings usually came to a bad end, mainly because they were not trusted by the emperors.

At the end of 1662, Guizhou province came under the jurisdiction of Wu. Meanwhile, Wu&#x27;s son, Wu Yingxiong (Wu Shifan&#x27;s father), married Princess Jianning, the 14th daughter of Hong Taiji and Kangxi&#x27;s aunt.

The Qing imperial court did not trust Wu, but he was still able to rule Yunnan with little or no interference. This was because the Manchus, an ethnic minority, needed time after their prolonged conquest to figure out how to impose the rule of a dynasty of a tiny minority on the vast Han-Chinese society. As a semi-independent ruler in the distant southwest, Wu was seen as an asset to the Qing court. For much of his rule, he received massive annual subsidies from the central government. This money, as well as the long period of stability, was spent by Wu in building his army, in preparation for an eventual clash with the Qing dynasty.

Wu in Yunnan, along with Shang Kexi in Guangdong and Geng Jingzhong in Fujian—the three great Han military allies of the Manchus, who had pursued the rebels and the Southern Ming pretenders—became a financial burden on the central government. Their virtually autonomous control of large areas threatened the stability of the Qing dynasty. The Kangxi Emperor decided to make Wu and two other princes who had been rewarded with large fiefs in southern and western China move from their lands to resettle in Manchuria. In 1673, Shang Kexi requested permission to retire and return to his homeland in the north, and the Kangxi Emperor granted the request at once. Forced into an awkward situation, Wu and Geng Jingzhong requested the same shortly afterwards. The Kangxi Emperor granted their requests and decided to dissolve the three vassal states, overriding all objections.

Driven by the threat to their interests, the three revolted and thus began the eight-year-long civil war known as the Revolt of the Three Feudatories. Before the rebellion, Wu sent a confidant to Beijing to retrieve Wu Yingxiong, his son and the young emperor&#x27;s uncle-in-law; but his son disagreed. The confidant only brought back Wu Shipan, Wu Yingxiong&#x27;s son by a concubine. On 28 December 1673, Wu killed Zhu Guozhi, the governor of Yunnan, and rebelled &quot;against the alien and rebuilding Ming dynasty&quot;. On 7 January 1674, 62-year-old Wu led troops from Yunnan on the northern expedition and took the whole territory of Guizhou province without any loss. Wu Yingxiong and his sons with Princess Jianning was executed by the Kangxi Emperor soon after his father&#x27;s rebellion. Shortly afterwards, Wu founded his own Zhou dynasty. By April 1674, Wu Sangui&#x27;s army had quickly occupied Hunan, Hubei, Sichuan, and Guangxi. In the next 2 years, Geng Jingzhong, Wang Fuchen, and Shang Zhixin successively rose in rebellion, and Wu&#x27;s rebellion had expanded into the Revolt of the Three Feudatories. By April 1676, the rebel force possessed 11 provinces (Yunnan, Guizhou, Sichuan, Shaanxi, Gansu, Hunan, Guangdong, Guangxi, Fujian, Zhejiang, and Jiangxi). For a moment, the situation seemed to favor Wu.

Unexpectedly, Wu halted his march and stayed south of Yangzi river for three months because of a shortage of troops and financial resources, which gave the Kangxi emperor a chance to assemble his forces. Wang Fuchen, Geng Jingzhong, and Shang Zhixin surrendered one after another under the attack of Qing forces.

In 1678, Wu Sangui went a step further and declared himself the emperor of the &quot;Great Zhou&quot;, with the era name of &quot;Zhaowu&quot; (昭武). He established his capital at Hengzhou (present-day Hengyang, Hunan). When he died in October 1678, his grandson, Wu Shifan, took over command of his forces and continued the struggle. The remnants of Wu&#x27;s armies were defeated soon after, in December 1681, and Wu Shifan committed suicide. Wu&#x27;s son-in-law was sent to Beijing with Wu Shifan&#x27;s head. The Kangxi Emperor sent parts of Wu&#x27;s corpse to various provinces of China.

==In culture==
Wu Sangui has often been regarded as a traitor and an opportunist, due to his betrayals of both the Ming and Qing dynasties. In Chinese culture, Wu&#x27;s name is synonymous with betrayal (similar to the use of &quot;Benedict Arnold&quot; in the United States). However, more sympathetic characterizations are sometimes voiced, and Wu&#x27;s story with his concubine, Chen Yuanyuan, who is sometimes compared to Helen of Troy, remains one of the classic love stories in China. Wu Sangui&#x27;s son, Wu Yingxiong, husband of Princess Jianning, sometimes also features in dramas and stories.

Wu Sangui appears as an antagonist in the popular wuxia novel &quot;The Deer and the Cauldron&quot; by Jin Yong. 

Wu and Chen&#x27;s love story has often been romanticized, as in Taiwanese TV drama &quot;Chen Yuanyuan&quot; (1989) and TVB drama &quot;Perish in the Name of Love&quot; (2003). In Hong Kong TV series &quot;The Rise and Fall of Qing Dynasty&quot; (1987), Wu&#x27;s military career and his love story with Chen are portrayed in a dramatic yet neutral way. In Taiwanese historical romance &quot;Princess Huai Yu&quot; (2000), Wu Sangui appears as an antagonist but his son, Wu Yingxiong, features prominently as the best friend of the Kangxi Emperor and love interest of Princess Jianning. 

Wu is portrayed in a more balanced light in serious historical dramas. In CCTV series &quot;The Affaire in the Swing Age&quot; (2005), which covers his early life and military career, he is shown as being forced into making the fateful decisions that have made him infamous. In the CCTV series &quot;Kangxi Dynasty&quot; (2001), which covers his late career, he is depicted in a neutral way as a force in the power play with the Manchu overlords; his son, Wu Yingxiong, is presented as torn between loyalty to the royalty and filial piety to his family.

<text>The American Nazi Party (ANP) is an American far-right and neo-Nazi political party founded by George Lincoln Rockwell and headquartered in Arlington, Virginia. The organization was originally named the World Union of Free Enterprise National Socialists (WUFENS), a name to denote opposition to state ownership of property, the same year—it was renamed the American Nazi Party in order to attract &#x27;maximum media attention&#x27;. Since the late 1960s, a number of small groups have used the name &quot;American Nazi Party&quot; with most being independent of each other and disbanding before the 21st century. The party is based largely upon the ideals and policies of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s Nazi Party in Germany during the Nazi era, and embraced its uniforms and iconography.

Shortly after Rockwell&#x27;s murder in 1967, the organization appointed Rockwell&#x27;s second in command, Deputy Commander Matt Koehl as the new leader. The American Nazi Party, now under Koehl&#x27;s command, was subject to ideological disagreements between members in the 1970s and 1980s. &quot;In 1982, Martin Kerr, a leader at the Franklin Road headquarters, announced that the organization was changing its name to the New Order and moving to the Midwest&quot;, effective January 1, 1983. Due to recruitment issues along with financial and legal trouble, Koehl was forced to relocate the group&#x27;s headquarters from the DC area, eventually finding his way to scattered locations in Wisconsin and Michigan. After Koehl&#x27;s death in 2014, a long-time member and officer of the New Order, Martin Kerr assumed leadership and maintains the New Order website and organization.

A former member of the original American Nazi Party, Rocky Suhayda, founded his own organization using the American Nazi Party name and has been active since at least 2008. Suhayda claims Rockwell as its founder despite no direct legal or financial link between it and Rockwell&#x27;s legacy organization.

== Headquarters ==
The WUFENS headquarters was located in a residence on Williamsburg Boulevard in Arlington, but was moved as the ANP headquarters to a house at 928 North Randolph Street (now a hotel and office building site). Rockwell and some party members also established a &quot;Stormtrooper Barracks&quot; in an old mansion owned by the widow of Willis Kern in the Dominion Hills section of Arlington at what is now the Upton Hill Regional Park. After Rockwell&#x27;s murder, the headquarters was moved again to one side of a duplex brick and concrete storefront at 2507 North Franklin Road which featured a swastika prominently mounted above the front door. This site was visible from busy Wilson Boulevard. Today, the Franklin Road address is often misidentified as Rockwell&#x27;s headquarters when in fact it was the successor organization&#x27;s last physical address in Arlington (now a coffeehouse).

== History ==

=== Name change and party reform ===
Under Rockwell, the party embraced Nazi uniforms and iconography.

After several years of living in impoverished conditions, Rockwell began to experience some financial success with paid speaking engagements at universities where he was invited to express his controversial views as exercises in free speech. This prompted him to end the rancorous &quot;Phase One&quot; party tactics and begin &quot;Phase Two&quot;, a plan to recast the group as a legitimate political party by toning down the verbal and written attacks against non-whites, replacing the party rallying cry of &quot;Sieg Heil!&quot; with &quot;White Power!&quot;, limiting public display of the swastika, and entering candidates in local elections.

The years 1965 and 1967 were possibly the height of Rockwell&#x27;s profile. He was interviewed by &quot;Playboy&quot; magazine, an event that stirred controversy within the ranks. At the time Rockwell had about 500 followers. In 1966 or 1967, Rockwell renamed the ANP the National Socialist White People&#x27;s Party (NSWPP), a move that alienated some hard-line members. The new name was a &quot;conscious imitation&quot; of the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People. Rockwell wanted a more &quot;ecumenical&quot; approach and felt that the swastika banner was impeding organizational growth. Rockwell was killed on August 25, 1967, before he could implement party reforms. Matt Koehl, a purist Neo-Nazi, succeeded Rockwell as the new leader and this ended the American Nazi Party. Thereafter, the members engaged in internecine disputes, and they were either expelled by Koehl or they resigned. After the murder of Rockwell, the party dissipated and ad hoc organizations usurped the American Nazi Party logo. Those included James Burford in Chicago and John Bishop in Iowa.

In 1962, ANP member Roy James was sentenced to 30 days in jail and fined $25 for punching Martin Luther King Jr., after pleading guilty to charge of assault and battery and disorderly conduct. King had not wanted to press charges, but Birmingham Judge Charles H. Brown insisted on trying James, calling the incident an &quot;uncalled for, unprovoked assault.&quot;

=== Assassination of Rockwell ===
An assassination attempt was made on Rockwell on June 28, 1967. As Rockwell returned from shopping, he drove into the long driveway of the &quot;Stormtrooper Barracks&quot; located in Arlington&#x27;s Dominion Hills subdivision and found it blocked by a fallen tree and brush. Rockwell assumed that it was another prank by local teens. As a party member cleared the obstruction, two shots were fired at Rockwell from behind one of the swastika-embossed brick driveway pillars. One of the shots ricocheted off the car, right next to his head. Leaping from the car, Rockwell pursued the gunman. On June 30, Rockwell petitioned the Arlington County Circuit Court for a gun permit; no action was ever taken on his request.

On August 25, 1967, as Rockwell left the Econowash laundromat at the Dominion Hills Shopping Center, a former follower named John Patler shot Rockwell from the roof of the building. Patler fired two bullets into Rockwell&#x27;s car through the windshield. One missed, the other hit his chest and ruptured his heart. His car rolled backward to a stop and Rockwell staggered out of the front passenger side door of the car, stood briefly while pointing upward at the strip mall&#x27;s rooftop where the shots had come from and then collapsed on the pavement. He was pronounced dead at the scene.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://news.bbc.co.uk&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

=== Koehl&#x27;s succession and ideological divisions ===
Rockwell&#x27;s second in command, Deputy Commander Matt Koehl, a staunch Hitlerist, assumed the leadership role after a council agreed that he should retain command. In 1968, Koehl moved the party to a new headquarters on 2507 North Franklin Road, clearly visible from Arlington&#x27;s main thoroughfare, Wilson Boulevard.

The party began to experience ideological divisions among its followers as it entered the 1970s. Dissatisfied members of the NSWPP chose to support William Luther Pierce and formed the National Alliance in 1974.

On November 3, 1979, some members of the NSWPP and a Ku Klux Klan group attacked a Communist Workers&#x27; Party protest march in Greensboro, North Carolina. The group of neo-Nazis and Klansmen shot and killed five marchers. Forty Klansmen and neo-Nazis were involved in the shootings with sixteen Klansmen and neo-Nazis being arrested. The six strongest cases were brought to trial first, but the two criminal trials resulted in the acquittal of the defendants by all-white juries. However, in a 1985 civil lawsuit, the survivors won a $350,000 judgment against the city, the Klansmen, and the neo-Nazis after they were all found guilty of violating the civil rights of the demonstrators. The shootings became known as the &quot;Greensboro Massacre.&quot;

In 1982 the Internal Revenue Service took action to foreclose on the group&#x27;s headquarters in Arlington, Virginia. Koehl ceased printing the organization&#x27;s White Power newspaper, sold its Arlington, Virginia, real estate holdings, and dispersed the group&#x27;s various operations to scattered locations in Wisconsin and Michigan. A secluded rural property called &quot;Nordland&quot; was purchased in New Berlin, Wisconsin, to serve as living quarters and to host annual meetings and ceremonial events.

===New Order===
The Koehl organization changed its name to New Order on January 1, 1983, on the grounds that the people in the area &quot;are not people looking to join revolutionary organizations&quot;, saying that it was moving to an area in the Midwest which it would not reveal for security reasons. The name change reflected the group&#x27;s Nazi mysticism and it was still known by that name in 2010.

The organization briefly attracted the media&#x27;s attention in October 1983, when it held a private meeting at Yorktown High School in Arlington, Virginia. A non-uniformed gathering of members was held indoors while the police kept a crowd of counter-protesters at bay outside. This event marked the last publicized appearance of Koehl and the New Order in Arlington. From that point forward the only outward sign that the group was still operational was the annual appearance of the swastika and Betsy Ross American Revolutionary War flags flying from the party&#x27;s nondescript headquarters building on North Franklin Road every April 20 (Hitler&#x27;s birthday).

New Order&#x27;s Chief of Staff, Martin Kerr, claims that the group is no longer a white supremacist group and focuses on advocating &quot;in favor of [white] people, not against other races or ethnicities...we consider the white people of the world to be a gigantic family of racial brothers and sisters, united by ties of common ancestry and common heritage. Being for our own family does not mean that we hate other families.&quot; The SPLC still classifies them as neo-Nazis and as a &quot;hate group.&quot;

== Namesake organizations ==
Since the late 1960s, there have been a number of small groups that have used the name &quot;American Nazi Party.&quot;
* Perhaps the first was led by James Warner and Allen Vincent and it consisted of members of the California branch of the NSWPP. This group announced its existence on January 1, 1968. In 1982 James Burford formed another &quot;American Nazi Party&quot; from disaffected branches of the National Socialist Party of America. This Chicago-based group remained in existence until at least 1994.
*A small American Nazi Party operated from Davenport, Iowa, led by John Robert Bishop until 1985.

== Notable former members ==
*David Duke was a member before he went on to establish the Knights of the Ku Klux Klan organization
*Frank Collin, founder of the National Socialist Party of America
*Harold Covington, author
*James Mason, former convict, author, and former associate of cult leader Charles Manson
*Joseph Tommasi, founder of the National Socialist Liberation Front
*Kurt Saxon, author of &quot;The Poor Man&#x27;s James Bond&quot;

<text>Chen Yuanyuan (c. 1623–1689 or 1695) was a Chinese courtesan who later became the concubine of military leader Wu Sangui. In Chinese folklore, the Shun army&#x27;s capture of her in 1644 prompted Wu&#x27;s fateful decision to let the Qing armies enter China proper through Shanhai Pass, thereby sealing the fate of the Ming dynasty.

==Biography==
Chen Yuanyuan was born in Jiangnan to a poor family with the original surname Xing (邢). After her parents died when she was young, she was adopted by her aunt and took her uncle&#x27;s surname, Chen. At ten, her uncle sold her to become a courtesan. Excelling in Kunqu and Yiyang opera, and often wearing her hair in a &quot;wo duo ji&quot; (high bun, 倭堕髻), Chen became renowned as one of the Eight Beauties of Qinhuai, along with Ma Xianglan, , Li Xiangjun, Dong Xiaowan, Gu Mei, , and Liu Rushi. She was especially praised for her role as Hongniang in &quot;The Romance of the West Chamber&quot; by poet Zou Shu (邹枢). Chen also wrote poetry, but only three of her works have survived. 

Government official Gong Ruofu (贡若甫) bought her freedom and intended to take her as a concubine, but Chen was released due to disagreements with other women in his household. In 1641, Chen had a brief relationship with the poet and calligrapher Mao Xiang (冒襄), who also intended to take her as a concubine, but before that she was &quot;acquired&quot; by the powerful courtier Tian Hongyu (田弘遇), father-in-law of the Chongzhen Emperor.

Accounts of Chen&#x27;s arrival in Beijing vary, citing 1641, 1642, or 1643. Mao claimed he proposed to Chen in 1641, with plans for marriage the following year. However, by spring 1642 when he went to visit her again, she had been taken away, leading to the belief that she arrived in Beijing in 1642. At that time, Tian, concerned that his daughter Tian Xiuying (田秀英) might fall out of favor, sought beautiful women in Jiangnan to win over the emperor in the interests of the Tian family. However, amid the Ming dynasty&#x27;s struggles against Li Zicheng and the Manchu, the Chongzhen Emperor had little time for Chen. Three months after entering the Forbidden City, she was sent back to Tian. She then performed in his family opera troupe until she was either bought for Ming general Wu Sangui by his father or given to Wu as a gift by Tian.

In April 1644, when Beijing fell to Li Zicheng&#x27;s peasant army, Wu&#x27;s household in the city was captured by Li and his subordinate Liu Zongmin (刘宗敏). By various accounts, Chen was either taken as a hostage, made a concubine, or raped by them. Wu eventually allied with the Qing regent, Dorgon, allowing the Qing armies to enter China proper through Shanhai Pass. The combined forces of Wu and the Qing ousted Li&#x27;s peasant army from Beijing, where the Qing dynasty then established its rule over China.

After Chen reunited with her husband, she followed him on various campaigns, ending up in Yunnan, which was awarded to Wu by the Qing rulers as part of his fiefdom. One account claims that Chen became a nun in Kunming after she fell out of Wu&#x27;s favor due to her age and disagreements with his harem.

In the 1980s, Chen&#x27;s final whereabouts was uncovered by the historian Huang Tousong (黄透松), who was exiled to Guizhou in the 1970s during the Cultural Revolution. According to his research, by the end of Wu&#x27;s failed rebellion against the Qing, Chen, her stepson Wu Yingqi (吴应麒), renamed as Wu Qihua (吴启华), and one of Wu Sangui&#x27;s surviving grandsons were escorted by General Ma Bao (马宝) to what is now Majia Zhai (马家寨) village in Guizhou, where they lived among the ethnic minorities hostile to Qing rule. In order to prevent being tracked down by Qing forces, Chen became a nun of a temple located at another mountain of Guizhou for years. In the era of Yongzheng Emperor&#x27;s reign, she returned to live in the village until her death. The knowledge of Chen&#x27;s final whereabouts was passed down only by oral history of Wu Sangui&#x27;s descendants living in the said village until Huang published the discovery. 

A tomb was erected in the village in the sixth year of Yongzheng Emperor&#x27;s reign in 1728, with the inscription: &quot;故先妣吴门聂氏之墓位&quot; (lit. The tomb of the late ancestress, Madam Nie of Wumen), which was intentionally cryptic to deter detection. In 1983, the stele of Chen&#x27;s tomb was unearthed and tomb was renovated. In the late 1980s, the tomb was looted, leaving only her skeleton and 36 evenly arranged teeth. In 2005, the tomb was attributed by the government historians to Chen&#x27;s. 

==In fiction==
In Chinese folklore, Chen Yuanyuan plays a dramatic and romanticized role in the rise and fall of dynasties. According to stories that emerged during the Kangxi era, Wu Sangui&#x27;s motivation for joining forces with the Qing to attack Li Zicheng was to save Chen from Li&#x27;s capture. This earned Chen the notoriety of a femme fatale and Wu the label of a traitor. Although such stories proved popular, some historians regard them as products of fiction. 

The story of Chen and Wu was immortalized in Wu Weiye&#x27;s &quot;qu&quot;, &quot;Song of Yuanyuan&quot;:

<doc id="364180" wikidata="Q1001112" url="?curid=364180" title="Buddy memory allocation">
<text>The buddy memory allocation technique is a memory allocation algorithm that divides memory into partitions to try to satisfy a memory request as suitably as possible. This system makes use of splitting memory into halves to try to give a best fit. According to Donald Knuth, the buddy system was invented in 1963 by Harry Markowitz, and was first described by Kenneth C. Knowlton (published 1965). The Buddy memory allocation is relatively easy to implement. It supports limited but efficient splitting and coalescing of memory blocks.

== Algorithm ==
There are various forms of the buddy system; those in which each block is subdivided into two smaller blocks are the simplest and most common variety. Every memory block in this system has an &quot;order&quot;, where the order is an integer ranging from 0 to a specified upper limit. The size of a block of order n is proportional to 2n, so that the blocks are exactly twice the size of blocks that are one order lower. Power-of-two block sizes make address computation simple, because all buddies are aligned on memory address boundaries that are powers of two. When a larger block is split, it is divided into two smaller blocks, and each smaller block becomes a unique buddy to the other. A split block can only be merged with its unique buddy block, which then reforms the larger block they were split from.

Starting off, the size of the smallest possible block is determined, i.e. the smallest memory block that can be allocated. If no lower limit existed at all (e.g., bit-sized allocations were possible), there would be a lot of memory and computational overhead for the system to keep track of which parts of the memory are allocated and unallocated. However, a rather low limit may be desirable, so that the average memory waste per allocation (concerning allocations that are, in size, not multiples of the smallest block) is minimized. Typically the lower limit would be small enough to minimize the average wasted space per allocation, but large enough to avoid excessive overhead. The smallest block size is then taken as the size of an order-0 block, so that all higher orders are expressed as power-of-two multiples of this size.

The programmer then has to decide on, or to write code to obtain, the highest possible order that can fit in the remaining available memory space. Since the total available memory in a given computer system may not be a power-of-two multiple of the minimum block size, the largest block size may not span the entire memory of the system. For instance, if the system had 2000 K of physical memory and the order-0 block size was 4 K, the upper limit on the order would be 8, since an order-8 block (256 order-0 blocks, 1024 K) is the biggest block that will fit in memory. Consequently, it is impossible to allocate the entire physical memory in a single chunk; the remaining 976 K of memory would have to be allocated in smaller blocks.

=== Example ===

The following is an example of what happens when a program makes requests for memory. Assume that in this system, the smallest possible block is 64 kilobytes in size, and the upper limit for the order is 4, which results in a largest possible allocatable block, 24 times 64 K = 1024 K in size. The following shows a possible state of the system after various memory requests.

This allocation could have occurred in the following manner
# The initial situation.
# Program A requests memory 34 K, order 0.
## No order 0 blocks are available, so an order 4 block is split, creating two order 3 blocks.
## Still no order 0 blocks available, so the first order 3 block is split, creating two order 2 blocks.
## Still no order 0 blocks available, so the first order 2 block is split, creating two order 1 blocks.
## Still no order 0 blocks available, so the first order 1 block is split, creating two order 0 blocks.
## Now an order 0 block is available, so it is allocated to A.
# Program B requests memory 66 K, order 1. An order 1 block is available, so it is allocated to B.
# Program C requests memory 35 K, order 0. An order 0 block is available, so it is allocated to C.
# Program D requests memory 67 K, order 1.
## No order 1 blocks are available, so an order 2 block is split, creating two order 1 blocks.
## Now an order 1 block is available, so it is allocated to D.
# Program B releases its memory, freeing one order 1 block.
# Program D releases its memory.
## One order 1 block is freed.
## Since the buddy block of the newly freed block is also free, the two are merged into one order 2 block.
# Program A releases its memory, freeing one order 0 block.
# Program C releases its memory.
## One order 0 block is freed.
## Since the buddy block of the newly freed block is also free, the two are merged into one order 1 block.
## Since the buddy block of the newly formed order 1 block is also free, the two are merged into one order 2 block.
## Since the buddy block of the newly formed order 2 block is also free, the two are merged into one order 3 block.
## Since the buddy block of the newly formed order 3 block is also free, the two are merged into one order 4 block.

As you can see, what happens when a memory request is made is as follows:
* If memory is to be allocated
# Look for a memory slot of a suitable size (the minimal 2k block that is larger or equal to that of the requested memory)
## If it is found, it is allocated to the program
## If not, it tries to make a suitable memory slot. The system does so by trying the following:
### Split a free memory slot larger than the requested memory size into half
### If the lower limit is reached, then allocate that amount of memory
### Go back to step 1 (look for a memory slot of a suitable size)
### Repeat this process until a suitable memory slot is found

* If memory is to be freed
# Free the block of memory
# Look at the neighboring block – is it free too?
# If it is, combine the two, and go back to step 2 and repeat this process until either the upper limit is reached (all memory is freed), or until a non-free neighbour block is encountered

== Implementation and efficiency ==

In comparison to other simpler techniques such as dynamic allocation, the buddy memory system has little external fragmentation, and allows for compaction of memory with little overhead. The buddy method of freeing memory is fast, with the maximal number of compactions required equal to O(highest order) = O(log2(total memory size)). Typically the buddy memory allocation system is implemented with the use of a binary tree to represent used or unused split memory blocks. The address of a block&#x27;s &quot;buddy&quot; is equal to the bitwise exclusive OR (XOR) of the block&#x27;s address and the block&#x27;s size.

However, there still exists the problem of internal fragmentation – memory wasted because the memory requested is a little larger than a small block, but a lot smaller than a large block. Because of the way the buddy memory allocation technique works, a program that requests 66 K of memory would be allocated 128 K, which results in a waste of 62 K of memory. This problem can be solved by slab allocation, which may be layered on top of the more coarse buddy allocator to provide more fine-grained allocation.

One version of the buddy allocation algorithm was described in detail by Donald Knuth in volume 1 of &quot;The Art of Computer Programming&quot;. The Linux kernel also uses the buddy system, with further modifications to minimise external fragmentation, along with various other allocators to manage the memory within blocks.

codice_1 is a modern memory allocator that employs, among others, the buddy technique.

<text>Pet Shop of Horrors is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Matsuri Akino. It was serialized in Ohzora Publishing&#x27;s &quot;Apple Mystery&quot;, and later in &#x27;s &quot;&quot; from 1994 to 1998, with its chapters collected in ten volumes. The series focuses on the eccentric Count D, proprietor of a mysterious pet shop located in the heart of Chinatown, and the numerous patrons who visit his supernatural shop. The series was licensed in North America by Tokyopop.

A four-episode anime television series produced by Madhouse was broadcast in 1999. A second manga series, titled &quot;Pet Shop of Horrors: Tokyo&quot; (known as &quot;New Petshop of Horrors&quot; in Japan) was serialized by Asahi Sonorama (and later Asahi Shimbun Publications) in &quot;&quot; from 2004 to 2009, and later published as a webcomic on &#x27;s &quot;Horror &amp; Fantasy Club&quot; site from 2009 to 2012. Its chapters were collected in twelve volumes. The manga was also licensed in North America by Tokyopop, who only released eight volume from 2008 to 2011.

A spin-off series, titled &quot;Pet Shop of Horrors: Passage-hen&quot;, which follows Count D&#x27;s grandfather in Fin de siècle Paris, was irregularly published in HarperCollins Japan&#x27;s &quot;Mugentō&quot; (2013) and &quot;Harlequin Original&quot; (2015–2017); five volumes were released. Another spin-off, titled &quot;Petshop of Horrors: Hyōhaku no Hakobune-hen&quot;, featuring Count D&#x27;s father as the protagonist, was serialized in &quot;Harlequin Original&quot; from 2018 to 2020, with its chapters collected in three volumes.

==Plot==
&quot;Count D&quot; is the mysterious caretaker of a pet shop in Los Angeles Chinatown. Each of D&#x27;s rare pets, which all have strangely humanoid appearances, comes with a contract with three major points. These points differ for each animal sold (although each animal&#x27;s contract includes not showing it to anyone), and breaking this contract usually results in dire (and sometimes disturbing) consequences for the buyer, for which the pet shop claims no liability.

Individual chapters of &quot;Pet Shop of Horrors&quot; are often based on these consequences, and are each written as a stand-alone story, usually introducing one or more new characters in each chapter. With the exception of the main characters and their families, it is rare for a character to carry over to a later chapter, providing the series with a very episodic nature.

The detective Leon Orcot is used to tie the chapters together into an ongoing plot, usually in the form of a subplot within each chapter. Initially he suspects D of malicious criminal activity and using the pet shop as a front for drug trafficking. As the series progresses, he learns more about the pet shop and D himself, entering into a strange friendship of sorts with D as he works to uncover the truth.

==Characters==
===Main characters===
;Count D
:Though he denies the name is &quot;Count D&quot;—claiming that this title belongs only to his grandfather, the shop&#x27;s true owner—most humans refer to him by this name, often shortened to &quot;The Count&quot;, &quot;Count&quot;, or simply &quot;D&quot;. He runs a pet shop in Chinatown while the shop&#x27;s alleged true owner is traveling abroad. His motto suggests he does not actually sell pets but rather &quot;love, dreams, and hope&quot; with a three-term contract. He appears more fond of animals than humans and displays a love of the natural world. He usually appears calm and soft-spoken (except when he is fighting with Leon), though towards the end of the manga series, his attitude changes. Because he enjoys drinking tea and has a special fondness for confectionery, Leon often bribes him with sweets and pastries in return for information. Although he often expresses disdain for humans and claims to hate human children, he eventually becomes very attached to Chris, and he also seems to hold his brother Leon in affection.
:Leon suspects that D may be a vampire, but D&#x27;s father later refutes this (D is actually a vegetarian). It is later revealed that he is not human (although what he and his family is not made clear (although it is not exactly made clear what he and his family really are). According to D&#x27;s father, they are the last of an ancient Chinese civilization that was very close to animals. Because of their wisdom, the people were kept at the imperial palace as wise men and priests. When the prince asked one of the priestesses for her hand in marriage and she refused him, however, he grew angry and ordered a massive genocide of the people. Only one man from the civilization survived, vowing to take revenge on the humans for what they did to his family. D shares a striking resemblance to his father, and to his grandfather, the real Count D. This is because they are imperfect clones of one another, created to carry on Count D&#x27;s legacy of revenge. They are almost identical except for the colour of their eyes; D has one purple eye, like his father, and one golden eye, inherited from his grandfather.
:
:Leon Orcot is a hot-headed young detective who attempts to connect the pet shop with mysterious deaths in the region. He is convinced D is a criminal and proceeds to investigate him with an iron will, determined to be the one to arrest D. Over time, he forms a close and complicated relationship with D. He has a disdain for the supernatural and therefore refuses to believe D&#x27;s explanations for the events of the story, though this attitude is challenged as the series progresses. He is extremely lecherous as displayed though the series, and spends a lot of time chasing girls. Over the course of the series, Leon is given two pets by D (a flowering plant and a butterfly), both of which help him through hard times in his life (as opposed to other pets sold, which are meant to teach their owners a lesson).

===Other humans===
:Chris is Leon&#x27;s much younger brother, whose mother died during childbirth. As a result, Chris was raised by his aunt and uncle, who he grew up calling &quot;Mom&quot; and &quot;Dad&quot;. When Chris&#x27; younger cousin, Sam, told him that he was responsible for his mother&#x27;s death, he was so shocked that he lost his ability to speak. Chris was sent to Los Angeles with Leon and spends most of his time in D&#x27;s pet shop. Although he cannot talk, Chris has the ability to telepathically speak to all of D&#x27;s animals as well as D and Leon. As it turns out, Q-chan is the only &quot;pet&quot; Chris perceives as an animal. Since he initially only ever sees the animals in their human form, he believes that D actually sells human children, although he feels all right with that as long as the children do not mind it.
:Later, Chris reconciles with his cousin, regains his ability to speak, and moves back to his aunt&#x27;s house. This comes at the price of his loss of ability to see the animals in their humanoid forms, referred to in the manga as something of a &quot;Departure from Eden&quot;. Twenty years later, he is shown as an FBI officer, tracking down the next generation of the Count&#x27;s family. Rather than trying to arrest &quot;New D&quot; for the mysterious deaths caused by a pet, Chris only wishes to talk about his brother who disappeared 20 years ago. He does not seem to regard &quot;New D&quot; or the pet shop in an adversarial light, the way his brother Leon regarded D or Agent Howell regarded Papa D.
:
:Jill is Leon&#x27;s fellow police officer. She is far more sensible than he is as well as far more knowledgeable (for example, she learned Chinese and rattled off the life cycle of the butterfly to D). Jill seems to like D a lot and is usually exasperated by Leon&#x27;s constant claims that D is a criminal.
:Commonly known as &quot;Sam&quot;, she was four years old when Chris came to live in her household and disliked him immensely, especially when he ruined her bunny doll. She later regrets her outburst, realizing she misses him, and, with the help of Ten-chan, the two reconcile and she begins to refer to him as her &quot;brother&quot;.

===Animals===
:He is a , a mystical carnivorous animal that is a distant relative of the goat. He is a somewhat rough friend of Chris, and they are almost always together. was originally the chef of a popular Chinese restaurant, which D frequented. The two fell into a sort of &#x27;love&#x27;, D wanting to possess the rare and exotic animal, T-chan wishing to eat the vegetarian D. In the end, Leon and his police cohorts arrest T-chan as he is about to feast on D (a sacrifice D was willing to make). Later, he ripped out his heart and tried to eat it, thereby &quot;becoming&quot; T-Chan.
:To most people, T-chan appears to be a small, primarily goat-like animal though he has the striped paws of a tiger, not hooves. To D and Chris, he takes the appearance of a grumpy young man with long messy hair and large goat horns that protrude out of his head. His fashion sense appears to be Indian or Arabic inspired. He is very quick-tempered, outspoken, and sometimes very childish. He often causes a stir whenever Detective Orcot enters the Pet Shop, often attempting to bite him the moment he enters the room.
; / Pon-chan
:Pon-chan is a raccoon who lives at D&#x27;s pet shop. She is a special friend of Chris and unlike T-chan, is very kind and friendly. To most people, Pon-chan looks like a normal raccoon. To D and Chris, she takes the form of a little girl with curly blond hair and a Victorian-inspired dress. She has quite a distinct crush on Chris, and can often be jealous when he is interacting with a girl other than herself.
:Ten-chan is a shape-shifting nine-tailed fox with a relaxed personality and a crude manner of speech. He has such a potent ability to shape-shift that he can look like several different things at the same time, depending on who&#x27;s looking at him. He also has the ability to mimic the personality of whatever he is shifted into and seems to have somewhat occult powers as well. To most people, when he is not transformed, Ten-chan looks like a little white fox with multiple tails. To D and Chris, he takes the appearance of an androgynous, laid-back young man with long, braided hair and a flamboyant fashion sense.
:A dragon born with three heads. In human form she appears as a little girl in traditional Asian clothing with three distinct personalities. The triplets are: , the responsible one; , the violent one; and , the childish one. Each one of them had taken on the personality of the last person to hold them while still in the egg. Shuko was born 60 years ago and since then had been raised by D. Her two other sisters had hatched more recently: Kanan after being held by Leon, and Junrei after being held by a young boy (the grandchild of a Mr. Smith, to whom her egg was accidentally given). Kanan has the tendency to bully Junrei by pulling their hair. After meeting Chris, he made a contract with them, and like Pon-chan, they can get slightly jealous when he notices someone else.

===D&#x27;s family===
:Just as no one ever knows what D&#x27;s true name is, D&#x27;s father&#x27;s name is never revealed. He is somewhat manipulative and holds a grudge against humanity for destroying the environment and many species of animals. His own son does not trust him very much, even believing him capable of kidnapping Chris at one point. D&#x27;s father looks almost exactly like his son (even with identical fingerprints), except that his hair is much longer and both of his eyes are purple. Like D, he is not human, but his species is not revealed.
:It is known that he attended university in 1975, passing as an exchange student from Hong Kong and being occupied with research at a genetic engineering laboratory. During this time, he met a human by the name of Vesca Howell, who later abandoned his career as a medical doctor to become an FBI agent. His sole intent was to arrest D&#x27;s father, as he, like Leon Orcot with the youngest D, believed him to be a criminal. However, Leon shot D&#x27;s father, and D&#x27;s father killed Agent Howell. In the end, D&#x27;s father is reborn as a human and carried off by D&#x27;s grandfather to be raised as his son.
; / D&#x27;s grandfather
:Q-chan is a little bat-like creature and is D&#x27;s constant companion. He is the only creature in the shop that looks like an animal to everyone (almost all of the other animals look like strange humans to Chris and D). Q-chan&#x27;s true identity is revealed towards the end of the first series as D&#x27;s grandfather, and the proper holder of the title &quot;Count&quot; and name &quot;D&quot;. In the second series, he tells Eva Braun that the title of Count was received in his own grandfather&#x27;s time, and is now simply the name of his store. Upon the end of the series, &quot;Q-chan&quot; reverts to his humanoid form (identical to D apart from his two golden eyes) and takes the reborn D&#x27;s father to raise.
:An unnamed Chinese man who runs the pet shop appears at the very end of the series. He winds up meeting Chris Orcot (now an adult and an FBI agent) 20 years after Papa D&#x27;s death. In keeping with his family&#x27;s love of sweets, he invites Chris in to talk when offered some cherry tarts.

===Anime===
Madhouse produced a 4-episode anime adaptation of various chapters of the manga in March 1999. The anime first aired as a miniseries on the TBS television network (as part of their now-defunct programming block &quot;Wonderful&quot;) before being sold on VHS and LaserDisc.

Urban Vision released the &quot;Pet Shop of Horrors&quot; anime in North America, initially across two VHS tapes (each available in either subtitled or dubbed format) in February and May 2000 respectively. It was then re-released on a single DVD video (containing all four episodes and both language options) in February 2001. Sentai Filmworks had acquired the license in October 2008, with distribution by ADV Films. However, in 2009, A.D. Vision announced that it has shut down ADV Films and distribution rights were transferred to Section23 Films, who continues to distribute titles from Sentai. It would eventually be released on DVD as a &quot;Sentai Selects&quot; title on January 5, 2016. In the UK, It got its DVD release via MVM on August 2, 2010.

====Episodes====
==Reception==
Carlo Santos of Anime News Network described the plot of &quot;Pet Shop of Horrors: Tokyo&quot; as &quot;the series&#x27; greatest strength but also its weakness: the plot formula makes it easy to dish out just the right amount of human drama, but those familiar with the &quot;Pet Shop&quot; will see each twist coming—and may even find some of them to be too far-fetched.&quot; Santos also felt that the art was &quot;not particularly horrifying,&quot; commenting that &quot;it&#x27;s clear that Akino struggles with any artwork beyond the usual range of attractive young men, fashionable women and the occasional bizarre creature.&quot; However, he commended the &quot;well-planned&quot; layout and pacing of the volume. Robin Brenner commented that &quot;&quot;Pet Shop of Horrors&quot; has always been more about atmosphere than about truly surprising plots... Instead, the pleasure comes from Matsuri Akino&#x27;s talent for truthful dialogue, attention to detail in the art, and a fine sense of how to portray both laughter and dread.&quot;

<doc id="364188" wikidata="Q2713986" url="?curid=364188" title="Don't Look Back (Boston album)">
<text>Don&#x27;t Look Back is the second studio album by American rock band Boston, released in 1978 by Epic Records, as the band&#x27;s last album on the label. The album reached No. 1 in both the US and Canada, and No. 9 in the UK. The title track helped with the album&#x27;s success, reaching No. 4 in 1978 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and remains one of the band&#x27;s biggest hits. The album sold over one million copies in the ten days following its release and was certified 7× platinum by the RIAA in the US on April 11, 1996.

The album&#x27;s two-year gap from its predecessor marks the shortest between two of the band&#x27;s studio albums to date; guitarist, producer and primary songwriter Tom Scholz claimed that Epic executives pushed him and the band into releasing the album before they felt it was ready. He also felt that the album &quot;was ridiculously short&quot;. Their next album, &quot;Third Stage&quot;, was not released for another eight years, by which time the band and record label had parted ways and fought a courtroom battle that Boston ultimately won.

==Recording==
&quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; was recorded during 1977 and 1978 at Scholz&#x27;s Hideaway Studio, except for the piano on &quot;A Man I&#x27;ll Never Be&quot;, which was recorded by engineer Dave Butler at Northern Studio in Maynard, Massachusetts.

==Songs==
&quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot;, &quot;A Man I&#x27;ll Never Be&quot; and &quot;Feelin&#x27; Satisfied&quot; were all released as singles, reaching No. 4, 31 and 46 respectively on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100.

&quot;The Journey&quot; is a short instrumental track that links the opening title track and the third track, &quot;It&#x27;s Easy&quot;. In 1987, Scholz cited it as his favorite song on any of Boston&#x27;s first three albums, but wished that it were longer. He described it as, &quot;I&#x27;m floating through space, cruising in an airplane over the clouds&quot;. &quot;Billboard&quot; writer Paul Grein cited &quot;The Journey&quot; as an example of science fiction-like music on &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; that is consistent with the guitar-spaceship cover art of the album (and single). Grein referred to it as having an &quot;almost religious&quot; tone, anticipating that some listeners would find it &quot;pretentious&quot; but stating that he found it an effective interlude between the harder-rocking songs &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Easy&quot;. Emerson said that the organ sounds church-like and that the guitars sound &quot;ghostly&quot;, making the track sound &quot;eerie and alienated&quot;. He compared &quot;The Journey&quot; to David Bowie&#x27;s work during the late 1970s. According to Scholz, the song had been lying around for years before he found &quot;the right theme to match the music&quot;. It took him just three days to record. The song was the only one on the album without a drum track, and so it was the only song on which drummer Sib Hashian did not appear. Barry Goudreau, who played rhythm guitar, was the only musician on the track besides Scholz. &quot;The Journey&quot; was released as the B-side of the &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; single.

Grein described the transition from &quot;The Journey&quot; to &quot;It&#x27;s Easy&quot; as &quot;appropriately jarring&quot; due to the latter song&#x27;s fast boogie guitar introduction. &quot;It&#x27;s Easy&quot; contains the line &quot;I believe what we achieve will soon be left behind&quot;, which Emerson points out appears to be sung to a girl with whom the singer is having a one-night stand, but may also be a self-reference to Boston&#x27;s own music, similar to the band&#x27;s approach on their earlier hit &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot;. Emerson also noted a similar theme of nostalgia between &quot;More Than a Feeling&quot; and &quot;It&#x27;s Easy&quot;. Writer Derek Oliver included the song as one of several on the album that retained Boston&#x27;s &quot;signature sound&quot; of &quot;pristine production, humongous orchestral guitars and stupendous vocals&quot; from the debut album. AllMusic critic Tim Sendra found this song &quot;more reflective&quot; than any of the material on Boston&#x27;s debut.

&quot;Party&quot; was co-written by Delp and Scholz. It begins with a short, slow introduction before a surprising change of pace to the fast, harder sound that persists throughout the rest of the song, in much the same way as &quot;Something About You&quot; from the debut. The dual themes of &quot;Party&quot; are loud parties and teenage sex. Grein compared the &quot;raucous bar band climax&quot; ending of the song to Aerosmith. Sendra found the song to be a &quot;storming rocker&quot; in the mold of &quot;Smokin&#x27;&quot; from the debut. &quot;Party&quot; is another song cited by Oliver as retaining the band&#x27;s signature sound. &quot;Billboard&quot; rated &quot;Party&quot; to be one of the best songs on the album. It is one of four songs from the album that were included on Boston&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot; album, along with the three singles.

&quot;Used to Bad News&quot; was written by Delp, making it the only song on the album on which Scholz did not receive a writing credit. Emerson described &quot;Used to Bad News&quot; as &quot;a charming, rather Beatles-like song&quot;. Greil Marcus rated it as one of the three &quot;masterpieces&quot; on the album, along with the title track and &quot;A Man I&#x27;ll Never Be&quot;. As with &quot;It&#x27;s Easy&quot;, Sendra considered the song to be more reflective than anything on the debut. &quot;Used to Bad News&quot; is the only song on the album on which Goudreau is the sole lead guitarist. Scholz played all the other instruments except drums. It was released as the B-side of the &quot;Feelin&#x27; Satisfied&quot; single.

&quot;Don&#x27;t Be Afraid&quot; closes the album. The song had an earlier genesis than other songs on the album, as it was originally one of the demos Scholz worked on before getting a record contract. Grein stated that it &quot;comes to a crashing, concert-like crescendo&quot;, specifically citing Hashian&#x27;s drumming. It was also released as the B-side of the &quot;A Man I&#x27;ll Never Be&quot; single.

==Original release==
&quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; was originally to be titled &quot;Arrival.&quot; However, Boston members discovered that Swedish pop group ABBA released an album by that name two years prior, so &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; was chosen.

==Compact disc releases==
&quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; was among the first commercially produced compact discs when the format was introduced in 1983, but because of ongoing legal issues between Scholz and CBS Records, the title was pulled after a small production run and did not reappear on CD until three years later. Inserts for the original CD pressings contained the &quot;spaceship blueprints&quot; from the original album dust jacket; those illustrations were not included in the 1986 reissue.

This album and the group&#x27;s first album were remastered and re-released on June 13, 2006. The reissues were digitally remastered personally by Scholz after he heard indirectly that the remastering project was to be handled by Sony&#x27;s team, which he felt was unacceptable. He took it on himself after negotiations with Legacy Recordings, saying, &quot;I&#x27;ve always wanted to make those albums sound good on CD, and the chance arrived&quot;.

A small number of the Sony-remastered versions briefly went on sale in Canada on April 4, 2006, before being removed from sale. Those discs also included a live version of &quot;Shattered Images&quot; (mistitled &quot;Help Me&quot; on the packaging), an unreleased Boston original recorded at a 1976 concert in Philadelphia.

==Critical reception==

&quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; received generally favorable reviews from critics. &quot;Billboard&quot; described the album as &quot;an equally superior effort [as their debut album] that further refines this group&#x27;s ability to play hard rock underlined by a sweet, melodic base&quot;. In a more mixed review, Ken Emerson of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; said that the album &quot;consolidated the sound of the band&#x27;s debut album but was less pretentious than Bruce Springsteen&#x27;s 1978 album &quot;Darkness on the Edge of Town&quot;&quot;. Emerson noted a theme of Scholz expressing his anxieties, particularly with making this album, as evidenced by lines about being unsure about measuring up as a man in &quot;A Man I&#x27;ll Never Be&quot;, and the line &quot;I&#x27;ve been used/But I&#x27;m taking it like a man&quot; in &quot;Used to Bad News&quot; (a song written by Brad Delp). Emerson also pointed out contradictions between the lyrics of certain songs, such as the line that &quot;I&#x27;m much too strong not to compromise&quot; in &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; versus the line in &quot;A Man I&#x27;ll Never Be&quot; that &quot;I can&#x27;t get any stronger&quot;, or the line &quot;Emotions can&#x27;t be satisfied&quot; in &quot;A Man I&#x27;ll Never Be&quot; versus the title itself of &quot;Feelin&#x27; Satisfied&quot;. 

Brad Chadderton of &quot;The Ottawa Journal&quot; praised the album for its heavy, innovative and melodic guitar lines; for Brad Delp&#x27;s vocals; and for lyrics that contain philosophical meaning, calling &quot;Don&#x27;t Look Back&quot; an improvement over the debut album. &quot;Christgau&#x27;s Record Guide&quot; gave the album a B−, stating &quot;Not only are the guitars perfectly received, but the lyrical clichés seem specially selected to make the band as credible in the arena as they are in the studio, and Brad Delp&#x27;s tenor, too thin for nasty cock-rock distractions, leaves us free to contemplate unsullied form.&quot; AllMusic gave the album four out of five stars, saying Boston sounds &quot;inspired&quot; on the album. &quot;

<doc id="364194" wikidata="Q5071896" url="?curid=364194" title="Change the World Without Taking Power">
<text>Change the World Without Taking Power: The Meaning of Revolution Today is a book by John Holloway first published in 2002. It looks at the understanding of power as the central focal point of how to effect meaningful change. Holloway uses two definitions of power, &#x27;power-over&#x27; and &#x27;power-to&#x27; in order to understand the difference between power from authority, power over someone else, and the power to do something, the capacity for action. Holloway argues we should never simply assume the legitimacy of anything with &#x27;power-over&#x27; someone else and goes as far as saying this is true for the state - we should not &#x27;fetishise&#x27; the state to the extent of simply assuming its role, responsibilities, and authority.

Holloway criticises past revolutions as they have simply instituted a different form of authority, of &#x27;power-over&#x27;, and have therefore not been truly revolutionary in changing the structure of power itself. He hopes for a revolution that is more anarchic in nature, dissolving such hierarchy and authority to more genuinely empower people and their capacities to do certain things.

The book has opened up a wave of debate between Holloway and intellectuals on the far-left. Many of these debates were collected by the International Institute for Research and Education in a free booklet.

<text>The Invisibles is a comic book series published by the Vertigo imprint of DC Comics from 1994 to 2000. It was created and scripted by Scottish writer Grant Morrison, and drawn by various artists throughout its publication.

The series loosely follows the doings of a single cell of The Invisible College, a secret organization battling against physical and psychic oppression using time travel, magic, meditation, and physical violence.

For most of the series, the team includes leader King Mob; Lord Fanny, a transgender Brazilian shaman; Boy, a former member of the NYPD; Ragged Robin, a telepath with a mysterious past; and Jack Frost, a young hooligan from Liverpool who may be the next Buddha. Their enemies are the Archons of the Outer Church, interdimensional alien gods who have already enslaved most of the human race without their knowledge.

==Publication history==
&quot;The Invisibles&quot; was Morrison&#x27;s first major creator-owned title for DC Comics and it drew from their &quot;Zenith&quot; strip as well as 1990s conspiracy culture. Their intent was to create a &quot;hypersigil&quot; to jump-start the culture in a more positive direction.

The title initially sold well but sales dipped sharply during the first series, leading to concerns that the series might be cancelled outright. To counteract this, Morrison suggested a &quot;wankathon&quot; in the hope of bringing about a magical increase in sales by a mass of fans simultaneously masturbating at a set time.

Morrison became seriously ill while writing the book, something they attribute to working on the title and the manner in which its magical influence affected them, and has stated that their work on the comic made them into a different person from the one who started it. They have also said that much of the story was told to them by aliens when they were abducted during a trip to Kathmandu.

The third and final series was meant to be a countdown to the new millennium but shipping delays meant the final issue did not appear until April 2000. All of the series have been collected in a set of trade paperbacks.

Morrison saw the series censored due to the publisher&#x27;s concern over the possibility of paedophilic and child abuse content. The first such case was in volume one, issue 7 (&quot;Arcadia part 3: 120 Days Of Sod All&quot;); dialogue was altered in one scene where a group rapes and degrades several nameless characters, and the term &quot;lost souls&quot; was used to ensure the characters could not be identified as children, as in the Marquis de Sade&#x27;s original &quot;120 Days of Sodom&quot;, the book the characters find themselves trapped in. Later in the series the names of people and organizations were simply blacked out, much to Morrison&#x27;s dismay. DC had one line that originally read &quot;Walt Disney was a crap&quot; blacked out at the suggestions of their lawyers; many of these examples of censorship were restored when reprinted in trade paperback.

The title was optioned to be made into a television series by BBC Scotland, but neither this nor an optioned film version have been made. Morrison wrote &quot;The Filth&quot; for Vertigo in 2002, which they describe as a companion piece to &quot;The Invisibles&quot;, though there is no other connection between the two titles.

==Plot summary==
===Volume 1===
====Say You Want a Revolution====

The first volume of &quot;The Invisibles&quot; introduces Dane McGowan, an angry teen from Liverpool, as he attempts to burn down his school. Abandoned by his father and neglected by his mother, Dane takes out his anger and frustration through destruction. In the first issue of the series, Dane is recruited by the Invisibles, a ragtag band of freedom fighters led by King Mob, a charismatic, cold-blooded assassin. The next arc, &quot;Down and Out in Heaven and Hell&quot;, shows Dane as he tries to survive on his own in London after being abandoned by the Invisibles. Dane is mentored by Tom O&#x27;Bedlam, an elderly homeless man who is secretly a member of the Invisibles. Tom shows Dane the magic in the everyday world and helps him realize that his anger prevents him from experiencing real emotions. While wandering with Tom, Dane has a partially remembered alien abduction experience and is transported into a different dimension. Eventually Dane returns to the Invisibles, taking the codename &quot;Jack Frost&quot;. The next arc, &quot;Arcadia&quot;, follows the Invisibles as they go back in time via astral projection to the French Revolution. Jack is almost killed by a demonic agent of the Outer Church, the Invisibles&#x27; chief enemy. As the arc closes, Jack declares that he is leaving the Invisibles.

====Apocalipstick====
The first volume continues with Jack Frost abandoning the Invisibles. The tragic past of Lord Fanny, a Brazilian transgender woman and a member of King Mob&#x27;s Invisibles cell, is revealed in a story arc titled &quot;She-Man&quot;, which jumps back and forth through time. After an encounter with an agent of the Outer Church, both King Mob and Lord Fanny are captured. The volume closes with a look at Jack as he evades both the Invisibles and the Outer Church in London. Jack remembers his abduction experience from the previous volume, recalling that his alien captors told him that he is the messiah. Jack is approached by Sir Miles, a high-ranking member of the Outer Church, who tries to recruit him. Jack refuses and battles Sir Miles telepathically. After winning the psychic duel, Jack escapes again, this time to Liverpool. This volume also introduces Jim Crow, a Haitian Invisible and Voodoo practitioner, and the Moonchild, a monstrous being who will one day be crowned the next King of England. The twelfth issue of the series, &quot;Best Man Fall&quot;, fleshes out the character of a soldier King Mob killed in the previous volume.

====Entropy in the U.K.====
Sir Miles&#x27; interrogates King Mob in an arc titled &quot;Gideon Stargrave in Entropy in the U.K.&quot; Ragged Robin and Boy, the other members of King Mob&#x27;s Invisibles cell, team up with Jim Crow to rescue their teammates. In the 20th issue of the series, Boy reflects on her past while taking a train to Liverpool to bring Jack back into the fold. In the following issue, &quot;Liverpool&quot;, Jack returns to his mother&#x27;s flat where he tells her everything that has happened to him since joining the Invisibles. He admits that he is scared of the responsibilities that he now has as humanity&#x27;s saviour and no longer knows what to do. Jack recalls that when he travelled to a different dimension with Tom O&#x27;Bedlam, a sentient satellite called Barbelith forced Jack to feel the collective suffering of humanity. Remembering this agony and realizing that he can put an end to it, Jack finally accepts his role and agrees to help save his friends. The next arc focuses on the regrouped Invisibles as they attempt to rescue King Mob and Lord Fanny. During the Invisibles&#x27; battle with the Outer Church, Jack is told that he will be responsible for destroying the world on 22 December 2012. Jack fully realizes the power at his disposal, defeating an extra-dimensional Archon of the Outer Church and healing King Mob of his injuries. Jack also heals Sir Miles, who had been severely hurt during the battle. The volume closes with a look at an Invisible named Mr. Six as he searches for traces of the Moonchild.

===Volume 2===
====Bloody Hell in America====
The second volume begins a year after the events in London. The arc &quot;Black Science&quot; follows the Invisibles embarking on a mission after taking a year off in America at the New York City estate of wealthy Invisible Mason Lang. While Jack Frost, Boy, and Lord Fanny explore New York City, King Mob and Ragged Robin begin a sexual relationship. Jolly Roger, an Invisible and an old friend of King Mob&#x27;s, asks them to help her steal an AIDS vaccine from Dulce Base. There, the Invisibles face off against Mr. Quimper and Colonel Friday, two psychic agents of the Outer Church. The Invisibles are victorious, though Quimper plants a tiny part of his psyche in Ragged Robin&#x27;s subconscious.

====Counting to None====
The Invisibles travel to San Francisco where they meet Takashi, an employee of Mason Lang&#x27;s who is working on a time machine. Ragged Robin reveals that she has been sent from the future using a working version of Takashi&#x27;s time machine when King Mob takes her to the dimension that the Invisible College, the Invisibles&#x27; headquarters, inhabits. Meanwhile, Jack Frost and Lord Fanny obtain a powerful supernatural device called the &quot;Hand of Glory&quot; from a mysterious trio called the &quot;Harlequinade&quot;. In an arc titled &quot;Sensitive Criminal&quot;, King Mob travels back in time via astral projection to learn from past Invisibles how to operate the Hand of Glory. In the following arc, &quot;American Death Camp&quot;, Boy steals the Hand of Glory and attempts to use it to rescue her brother, whom she believes is being held in a secret detention camp in Washington State, US. In reality, Boy is actually being deprogrammed by a separate cell of Invisibles who discovered that she had been brainwashed by the Outer Church to deliver the Hand to them.

====Kissing Mister Quimper====
The team vacation in New Orleans. Boy and Jack Frost acknowledge their feelings for each other and begin a brief relationship. The Invisibles then go back to Dulce to steal a powerful substance called &quot;Magic Mirror&quot; from the Outer Church in an arc titled &quot;Black Science 2&quot;. Aware of Quimper&#x27;s presence within her consciousness, Ragged Robin is able to trap and defeat him with Lord Fanny&#x27;s help. In the Dulce facility, Jack is taken into the Magic Mirror substance where he is shown the horrific dimension that the Outer Church hails from. After leaving Dulce, Ragged Robin prepares to return to the future. Using the Hand of Glory as an engine, Takashi&#x27;s time machine can be used to return her to her own time. After saying goodbye to King Mob, with whom she has fallen in love, Robin leaves the past behind. In the final issue of the volume, Boy leaves the Invisibles and King Mob destroys Mason Lang&#x27;s mansion, telling him that it is possible for even the most rigid man to change.

===Volume 3===
====The Invisible Kingdom====
Picking up a year after the previous volume, the third and final volume of the series follows the Invisibles as they prepare to stop the Moonchild from being used as a host for Rex Mundi, the extra-dimensional ruler of the Outer Church. Many of the Invisibles have significantly changed in this volume. King Mob no longer uses guns or kills people and Jack Frost has fully accepted his role as humanity&#x27;s saviour. Also, The Invisibles no longer consider themselves at war with the Outer Church, this time they are on a mission to rescue humanity before the world ends. The arc &quot;The Invisible Kingdom&quot; portrays the final battle between the Invisibles and the Outer Church. Sir Miles is killed, as is Jolly Roger (her body is later seen in a mass grave), while Jack Frost single-handedly defeats Rex Mundi. He then travels once again into the Magic Mirror and learns that the dimensions that the Outer Church and the Invisible College inhabit are one and the same. Afterwards, King Mob retires and devotes the rest of his life to non-violence. Jack Frost and Lord Fanny are left to start their own Invisibles cell. Years later, on 21 December 2012, the world is about to end, just as predicted. Ragged Robin returns and is finally reunited with King Mob. Jack Frost then breaks the fourth wall and addresses the reader, stating that, &quot;OUR SENTENCE IS UP&quot;. At that moment, the world ends and humanity transforms into its next stage of existence, guided by Jack Frost.

Volume three does not read from issue 1 to 12 but rather counts down from 12 to 1.

<text>A magic carpet, also called a flying carpet, is a legendary carpet and common trope in fantasy fiction. It is typically used as a form of transportation and can quickly or instantaneously carry its user(s) to their destination.

==In literature==
One of the stories in the &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot; relates how Prince Husain, the eldest son of Sultan of the Indies, travels to Bisnagar (Vijayanagara) in India and buys a magic carpet. This carpet is described as follows: &quot;Whoever sitteth on this carpet and willeth in thought to be taken up and set down upon other site will, in the twinkling of an eye, be borne thither, be that place nearhand or distant many a day&#x27;s journey and difficult to reach.&quot; The literary traditions of several other cultures also feature magical carpets, in most cases literally flying rather than instantly transporting their passengers from place to place.

Solomon&#x27;s carpet was reportedly made of green silk with a golden weft, long and wide: &quot;when Solomon sat upon the carpet he was caught up by the wind, and sailed through the air so quickly that he breakfasted at Damascus and supped in Media.&quot; The wind followed Solomon&#x27;s commands, and ensured the carpet would go to the proper destination; when Solomon was proud, for his greatness and many accomplishments, the carpet gave a shake and 40,000 fell to their deaths. The carpet was shielded from the sun by a canopy of birds. In Shaikh Muhammad ibn Yahya al-Tadifi al-Hanbali&#x27;s book of wonders, &quot;Qala&#x27;id-al-Jawahir&quot; (&quot;Necklaces of Gems&quot;), Shaikh Abdul-Qadir Gilani walks on the water of the River Tigris, then an enormous prayer rug (&quot;sajjada&quot;) appears in the sky above, &quot;as if it were the flying carpet of Solomon [&quot;bisat Sulaiman&quot;]&quot;.

In Russian folk tales, Baba Yaga can supply Ivan the Fool with a flying carpet or some other magical gifts (e.g. a ball that rolls in front of the hero showing him the way, or a towel that can turn into a bridge). Such gifts help the hero to find his way &quot;beyond thrice-nine lands, in the thrice-ten kingdom&quot;. Russian painter Viktor Vasnetsov illustrated the tales featuring a flying carpet on two occasions.

In Mark Twain&#x27;s &quot;Captain Stormfield&#x27;s Visit to Heaven&quot;, magic wishing carpets are used to instantaneously travel throughout Heaven.

Poul Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Operation Chaos&quot; features a world making extensive use of magic in daily life, and among other things having flying carpets as a common, non-polluting means of transportation - in fierce competition with the also available flying brooms. Travelers need not sit on the bare carpet itself, as the carpet serves as the platform for a comfortable cabin.

Magic carpets have also been featured in modern literature, movies, and video games, and not always in a classic context.

In &quot;traditional Chinese fantasy literature&quot; from the late Qing dynasty and before, sentient flying carpets were thought to be &quot;magical monsters&quot; in the same category as lung, qilin, or clouds for heroes to traverse distances with.

In Taoism and Taoist art, flying carpets were used as poetic metaphors for the ability of flight &quot;xian&quot; had.

In Tibetan Tantric Buddhism, a paper carpet were thought to be able to fly for &quot;adept[s]&quot;.

<text>PTAT-1 was the first privately financed transatlantic fiber optic telecommunications cable. Completed in 1989 at a cost of US$600 million and maintained by Cable &amp; Wireless (C&amp;W) and Sprint/Private TransAtlantic Telecommunication Systems, Inc. (PSI, Inc.), it connected Manasquan, New Jersey, United States, with Devonshire, Bermuda, and Ballinspittle, Republic of Ireland, terminating at Brean, England, United Kingdom, for a distance of .

PTAT-1 is notable for breaking the international telecommunication monopoly held by AT&amp;T Corporation and British Telecom (BT) for telecommunications between the US and UK, and setting off the mass production of fiber optic systems that now circle the world.

PTAT-1 was built by a joint venture of a small private US company, Private TransAtlantic Telecommunication Systems, Inc. (PSI, Inc., founded as Tel-Optik in 1984) and Cable &amp; Wireless plc of the UK. The submarine cable system and line terminal equipment were provided by Standard Telephones and Cables (STC), and alarm and control system management by International Computers Limited (ICL). The US shore end was built by Lightwave Spectrum. On August 15th, 1989, US Sprint Corp. acquired 100% of PSI, Inc., and thereby acquired 50% interest in PTAT-1.

The UK to US section of the cable was shutdown just after 02:00 hours on 8 February 2004, as it was no longer considered financially viable by Cable &amp; Wireless. Competitors to the cable had dropped their prices drastically after they re-emerged from Chapter 11 Bankruptcy with little or no debts to service, something C&amp;W was unable to compete with.

This cable provided intelligent repeaters that monitored and reported bit errors when queried by a base station. It included three fiber pairs, supporting two active channels. Each repeater had a base-station-controlled switch that could direct traffic between two fiber pairs, allowing flexible connections and a backup path if needed.

<text>Baptists Together, formally the Baptist Union of Great Britain, is a Baptist Christian denomination in England and Wales. It is affiliated with the Baptist World Alliance and Churches Together in England. The headquarters is in Didcot.

==History==
The Baptist Union was founded by 45 Particular Baptist churches in 1813 in London. In 1832, it was reorganized to include the New Connection General Baptist Association (General Baptist churches) as a partner. In 1891, the two associations merged to form a single organization. General Baptists and Particular Baptists work was united in the Baptist Union in 1891. The Baptist Historical Society was founded in 1908.

In 1922, Edith Gates became the first woman ordained pastor in the Convention.

In 2013 Lynn Green was elected, with no votes against, as the first female General Secretary of the Baptist Union of Great Britain to commence in September 2013. She was received at the vote by a standing ovation and her inaugural message included &quot;I believe that our union is ready for generational change... It is time to cast off the institutional mindset that has served us well in the past, and embrace a new way of being for the 21st century.&quot;

Also in 2013, the union publicly re-branded itself as &quot;Baptists Together&quot; and introduced a new logo to reflect the change (although it is still known in an official capacity as the Baptist Union of Great Britain).

==Membership==

According to a census published by the Union in 2024, it claimed 1,875 churches and 100,103 members.

===Missionary organization===
The Fellowship of British Baptists and BMS World Mission brings together in ministry the churches that are members of the Baptist Union of Scotland, Wales, the Irish Baptist Networks, and the Baptist Union of Great Britain. It is itself a member of The National Council for Voluntary Youth Services (NCVYS) because of its work to promote young people&#x27;s personal and social development.

===Inter-denominational associations===
The union maintains membership with Christian ecumenical organisations such as Churches Together in England, Churches Together in Britain and Ireland, the Conference of European Churches, and the World Council of Churches.

==Missionary Society==
The BMS World Mission was organised as Baptist Missionary Society in 1792, under the leadership of Andrew Fuller (1754–1815), John Sutcliff (1752–1814), and William Carey (1761–1834).

==Beliefs==
The union has a Baptist confession of faith. It is a member of the Baptist World Alliance.

== Schools ==

The Union is a partner of 4 theological seminaries, namely South Wales Baptist College, Northern Baptist College, Bristol Baptist College and Spurgeon&#x27;s College, and a university college, Regent&#x27;s Park College. In March 2024, the St Hild Centre for Baptist Ministry, previously an affiliated centre of Northern Baptist College, entered membership with the Baptist Union of Great Britain in its own right.

==Organisation==
The principal of the Union is the General Secretary. A number of paid staff provide leadership and practical support from the Union&#x27;s headquarters in Baptist House, Didcot, in areas such as finance, ministerial accreditation, and legal support.
=== List of general secretaries ===
* 1898 – 1924 John Howard Shakespeare
* 1925 – 1951 Melbourn Aubrey
* 1951 – 1967 Ernest A. Payne
* 1967 – 1982 David S. Russell
* 1982 – 1991 Bernard Green
* 1991 – 2006 David Coffey
* 2006 – 2013 Jonathan Edwards
* 2013 – Lynn Green
Since 2001, churches in membership with the Baptist Union of Great Britain have been organised into 13 Regional Associations:
*Central Baptist Association
*East Midlands Baptist Association
*Eastern Baptist Association
*Heart of England Baptist Association
*London Baptist Association
*North Western Baptist Association
*Northern Baptist Association
*South Eastern Baptist Association
*South Wales Baptist Association
*South West Baptist Association
*Southern Counties Baptist Association
*West of England Baptist Network (formerly West of England Baptist Association)
*Yorkshire Baptist Association
Regional Association teams, led by a number of Regional Ministers and a senior Regional Ministry Team Leader (RMTL), oversee and facilitate ministry in local churches. This may include pastoral support for ministers, signposting regional events, organising regional conferences, and supporting churches without a minister.

== Doctrinal controversies ==

At the Baptist Union Assembly in April 1971, Michael Taylor, then Principal at the Northern Baptist College, asserted, &quot;I believe that God was active in Jesus, but it will not do to say quite categorically: Jesus is God.&quot; The statement bred controversy, and some charged him with denying the Deity of Christ. Nigel G. Wright, later Principal of Spurgeon&#x27;s College, commenting on the affair, claimed the, &quot;Spectre of theological downgrade had lingered within the denomination throughout the 20th century,&quot; alluding to the Downgrade Controversy of a century earlier.

Affirm network was founded in 2000 in favor to the inclusion of LGBTQ people in the Union. 

In 2020, the Ministerial Recognition Committee received a letter from 70 members of the Union asking that the rules be changed to allow ministers in same-sex marriages to no longer be guilty of gross misconduct. The request was referred to the national Council, who discussed it in March 2022 and initiated a process of consultation whereby ministers and churches in membership with the Union were asked their thoughts on the proposed change. During this time a group formed, initially known as &#x27;Baptist Ministers for Orthodox Marriage&#x27; and later &#x27;Evangelical Baptists&#x27;, who campaigned against the change in rules. The results of the consultation were presented to Council, who decided against the change in March 2024 with a vote of 65% against:

<doc id="364220" wikidata="Q1703362" url="?curid=364220" title="Third Stage">
<text>Third Stage is the third studio album by the American rock band Boston, released on September 24, 1986, on MCA Records, as the band&#x27;s first album on the label. It was recorded at Boston co-founder Tom Scholz&#x27;s Hideaway Studio over a long, strained, six-year period &quot;between floods and power failures&quot;. Scholz and vocalist Brad Delp were the only original members. The lyrics invoke themes of aging and working through stages in life. The first track and lead single, &quot;Amanda&quot;, became a number one hit and one of the group&#x27;s best known songs. The album itself was eventually certified 4× platinum by the RIAA.

==Development==
After winning a legal battle with Epic Records, Scholz switched Boston to the MCA record label. The album&#x27;s first track, &quot;Amanda&quot;, had been written in 1980 (when Boston began work on the album) and became the band&#x27;s only #1 single. It reached #1 for two weeks in November 1986. The second Top 10 single, &quot;We&#x27;re Ready&quot;, reached #9. The singles &quot;Cool the Engines&quot; and &quot;Can&#x27;tcha Say (You Believe in Me)/Still in Love&quot; also got substantial airplay, with the former reaching #4 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Mainstream Rock chart, and the latter peaking at #20 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1987. &quot;Can&#x27;tcha Say&quot; remains Boston&#x27;s last Top 40 hit.

After only three weeks on the chart, &quot;Third Stage&quot; reached #1 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 for four weeks. It is the first CD-formatted album to have been certified gold (500,000 copies) by the RIAA. It was also certified gold in the LP format, believed to be the first album certified in both of these formats. In all, the album was certified 4× platinum.

It is the first Boston LP with electronic drum samples, the first to include songs not written by either Scholz or Brad Delp, the first Boston LP without original members Barry Goudreau, Sib Hashian and Fran Sheehan (though Hashian played drums on four tracks and Sheehan was included in the early recording session and received a writing credit). Jim Masdea plays drums on most of the album. It is the first Boston recording to use the Rockman guitar processor, invented by Scholz. No orchestral sounds or synthesizers are on the album. Critics have noted that the album has a darker, more somber tone than Boston&#x27;s previous work.

<text>Jorge Newbery Airfield , commonly known as Aeroparque, is an international airport northwest of downtown Buenos Aires, Argentina. The airport covers an area of and is operated by &quot;Aeropuertos Argentina 2000 S.A.&quot; It is located along the Río de la Plata, in the Palermo neighbourhood, and serves as the main hub for domestic flights in Argentina and South American destinations.

==History==
The airport was originally proposed by Mayor Carlos Noel in 1925. A number of feasibility studies and zoning disputes followed. In 1938, plans were submitted for an island airport connected via causeway to Avenida General Paz (then under construction). A former wetland reclaimed in 1916 from the Río de la Plata and closer to downtown was selected instead, and the facility, designed by Aeronautics Secretariat engineer Víctor Acuña in 1945, was inaugurated in 1947 as &quot;Aeroparque 17 de Octubre&quot; (17 October Airfield).

Initially served by a single runway, it began operations in January 1948 as the main hub for domestic flights from Buenos Aires as well as flights to Uruguay. Its first terminal was completed in 1951, by which time the runway was extended to . The airport was renamed following the 1955 coup against President Juan Perón in honor of the pioneer of Argentine aviation, Jorge Newbery, and was re-inaugurated in 1960 following work that expanded its main runway to , and also added a new terminal. The Argentine Air Force had a small base built near the eastern end of the airport in 1965; at this site, President Isabel Perón was formally deposed by the military in the March 1976 coup. A new terminal for national air carrier Aerolíneas Argentinas was inaugurated in 1981, expanding total terminal area to .
Plans to merge Newbery with Ezeiza International Airport in a new facility located on an artificial island were revived in 1996 by a commission headed by Congressman Álvaro Alsogaray, though these plans were ultimately dropped. Its operations, like those of all the nation&#x27;s public airports, were privatized in 1998 and transferred to &quot;Aeropuertos Argentina 2000&quot; (part of the conglomerate owned by local businessman Eduardo Eurnekian). The runway was further extended by in 2007, and work began in 2009 to create greater distance between the nearby Rafael Obligado Coast Highway and the eastern end of the runway. Routes were added in March 2010 to destinations in Brazil, Chile, and Paraguay. Work began in 2011 on Terminals III and IV, totaling . These terminals were inaugurated in March 2014, effectively doubling the airport&#x27;s passenger capacity. A recent increase in the number of airlines and flights operating at the airport has brought it to the limit of its capacity. Thus, the government decided to move all international flights (with the exception of those to Uruguay) to Ezeiza Airport from 2019. An expansion of the runway was completed during the COVID-19 pandemic in order to accommodate wide-body aircraft, such as the Airbus A330. In a push to connect tourists with domestic flights at the airport, the government allowed international flights to recommence.

<text>Iowa PBS, formerly Iowa Public Television (IPTV), is a network of Public Broadcasting Service (PBS) member stations in the U.S. state of Iowa. It is operated by the Iowa Public Broadcasting Board, an agency of the state education department which holds the licenses for all the PBS member stations in the state. Iowa PBS&#x27; headquarters are located at 6450 Corporate Drive in Johnston, Iowa, a suburb of Des Moines.

==History==

Iowa is a pioneer in educational broadcasting; it is home to two of the oldest educational radio broadcast stations in the world, the University of Iowa&#x27;s WSUI and Iowa State University&#x27;s WOI.

The electrical engineering department at the State University of Iowa (SUI) in Iowa City demonstrated television with an exhibit at the Iowa State Fair in Des Moines on August 28, 1931. J. L. Potter supervised the project. At the conclusion of the Iowa State Fair, the television experiment was set up in the communications laboratory of the electrical engineering building at the University of Iowa in Iowa City.

By 1933, the University of Iowa received an FCC license for experimental TV station W9XK, later W9XUI, providing twice a week video programming, with WSUI radio providing the audio channel. By 1939, the FCC allocated TV channels 1 and 12 for W9XUI. This early attempt at educational broadcasting ended by December 1941, with the entrance of the United States into World War II.

The University of Iowa later applied for a construction permit for station WSUI-TV on channel 11 in February 1948.

The Federal Communications Commission (FCC) froze the granting of new television licenses, on September 30, 1948. The FCC, at the time, was swamped with hundreds of requests for licensing. It was creating a problem for allocation and causing interference issues. The FCC wanted time to study the issues and work towards a better overall solution.

The freeze, originally set to last just six months, was extended when the Korean War began. Plus, the issues the FCC was trying to resolve were complicated and many. It ended up taking four years to end the freeze.

The April 14, 1952, FCC &quot;6th Report and Order&quot; effectively lifted the freeze. The decisions had been made on all five dilemmas. In the end, a color standard was chosen, 242 channels were designated for educational non-commercial use, strict rules separated stations sharing channels, channel allocation was resolved with an assignment table, and the entire spectrum of UHF band channels was authorized for use.

In 1951, the university supported the reallocation of channel 11 to Des Moines for an educational television station there.

Meanwhile, Iowa State University&#x27;s WOI-TV in Ames avoided the 1948 Freeze and began commercial broadcast operations in 1950 and carried some National Educational Television programming. Des Moines Public Schools applied for the channel 11 allocation and signed on KDPS-TV as the educational station for central Iowa in 1959. However, in the 1960s the only other areas of the state with a clear signal from an educational station were the southwest (from Nebraska ETV&#x27;s KYNE-TV in Omaha), and the northwest (from South Dakota ETV&#x27;s KUSD-TV in Vermillion).

In 1969, the state of Iowa bought KDPS-TV from the Des Moines Public Schools and changed its calls to KDIN-TV, intending it to be the linchpin of a statewide educational television network. As part of the state&#x27;s ambition, it rebranded KDIN as the Iowa Educational Broadcasting Network.

The network&#x27;s second station, KIIN-TV in Iowa City, joined IEBN in 1970 to expand statewide educational programming to eastern Iowa and northwestern Illinois. Soon afterward, IEBN became a charter member of PBS. By 1977 the newly renamed Iowa Public Broadcasting Network had eight full-power stations. The Iowa Public Television name was adopted in 1982 and began on-air January 1, 1983. In 2003, it purchased KQCT-TV in Davenport, which repeated the programming of Quad Cities PBS station WQPT-TV in the Iowa side of the Quad Cities. The calls were changed to KQIN.

IPTV was originally run by the state&#x27;s General Services Department before Governor Terry Branstad signed a bill creating Iowa Public Television as a separate state agency on May 16, 1983. In 1986, IPTV became part of the state&#x27;s Cultural Affairs Department, and on July 1, 1992, IPTV became part of the Iowa Department of Education.

Combined, the nine Iowa PBS stations reach almost all of Iowa and portions of the surrounding states of Illinois, Minnesota, Missouri, Nebraska, South Dakota, and Wisconsin.

On December 2, 2019, IPTV announced that it would rebrand as Iowa PBS in 2020, in alignment with PBS&#x27; new national brand identity.

==Stations==
Nine full-power TV stations make up the network; all stations have callsigns beginning with the letter K, as licensed by the FCC, and ending in IN (standing for Iowa Network). Aside from their transmitters, the network&#x27;s stations (except KDIN-TV) do not maintain any physical presence in their cities of license.

===Translators===
* Ottumwa (translating KIIN)
* Keokuk (translating KIIN)
* Keosauqua (translating KIIN)
* Decorah (translating KYIN)
* Sibley (translating KSIN-TV)
* Fort Madison (translating KIIN)
* Lansing (translating KYIN)
* Rock Rapids (translating KSIN-TV)

In 2012, an application was filed for a digital replacement translator to extend coverage of KRIN into Dubuque. The application was withdrawn in October 2024.

==Digital television==
===Subchannels===
The signals of the Iowa PBS stations are multiplexed:

===Analog-to-digital conversion===
Iowa PBS (as IPTV) shut down its stations&#x27; analog signals on June 12, 2009, the official date on which full-power television stations in the United States transitioned from analog to digital broadcasts under federal mandate. The station&#x27;s digital channel allocations post-transition are as follows:
* KBIN-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 32; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 33, using virtual channel 32.
* KDIN-TV shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 11; the station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 50 to VHF channel 11.
* KHIN shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 36; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 35, using virtual channel 36.
* KIIN shut down its analog signal, over VHF channel 12; the station&#x27;s digital signal relocated from its pre-transition UHF channel 45 to VHF channel 12.
* KQIN shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 36; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 34, using virtual channel 36.
* KRIN shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 32; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 35, using virtual channel 32.
* KSIN-TV shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 27; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 28, using virtual channel 27.
* KTIN shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 21; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 25, using virtual channel 21.
* KYIN shut down its analog signal, over UHF channel 24; the station&#x27;s digital signal remained on its pre-transition UHF channel 18, using virtual channel 24.

===Late night programming===
Starting August 31, 2013, Iowa PBS (as IPTV) had gone off-the-air nightly from midnight to 5 a.m. over-the-air due to budget concerns, reduced from a 24-hour schedule. Mediacom continued to carry the network in their markets with 24-hour programming due to their direct fiber connection from IPTV in Johnston to their Des Moines headend, which distributes the four IPTV channels statewide. The national satellite services carry the network&#x27;s primary HD channel (IPTV.1) and have a fiber connection so the channel was available 24/7 to their subscribers. At the present time, they do not carry the three subchannels.

The network restored over-the-air 24-hour service on January 15, 2019; late night programming mainly consists of the national PBS schedule.

==Friends of Iowa PBS==
In 1970, Friends of Iowa Public Television (Iowa Public Television Foundation Board) was created for the development, growth and support of Iowa PBS through the building of a strong statewide membership base. Its 65,000 member households across Iowa and bordering states contribute nearly 90% of the out-of-pocket costs for acquiring and producing general audience programming. When IPTV rebranded as Iowa PBS in December 2019, Friends of Iowa Public Television changed its name to Friends of Iowa PBS.

<text>In cryptography, Lucifer was the name given to several of the earliest civilian block ciphers, developed by Horst Feistel and his colleagues at IBM. Lucifer was a direct precursor to the Data Encryption Standard. One version, alternatively named DTD-1, saw commercial use in the 1970s for electronic banking.

== Overview ==

Lucifer uses a combination of transposition and substitution crypting as a starting point in decoding ciphers. One variant, described by Feistel in 1971, uses a 48-bit key and operates on 48-bit blocks. The cipher is a substitution–permutation network and uses two 4-bit S-boxes. The key selects which S-boxes are used. The patent describes the execution of the cipher operating on 24 bits at a time, and also a sequential version operating on 8 bits at a time. Another variant by John L. Smith from the same year uses a 64-bit key operating on a 32-bit block, using one addition mod 4 and a singular 4-bit S-box. The construction is designed to operate on 4 bits per clock cycle. This may be one of the smallest block-cipher implementations known. 
Feistel later described a stronger variant that uses a 128-bit key and operates on 128-bit blocks.

 described a later Lucifer as a 16-round Feistel network, also on 128-bit blocks and 128-bit keys. This version is susceptible to differential cryptanalysis; for about half the keys, the cipher can be broken with 236 chosen plaintexts and 236 time complexity.

IBM submitted the Feistel-network version of Lucifer as a candidate for the Data Encryption Standard (compare the more recent AES process). It became the DES after the National Security Agency reduced the cipher&#x27;s key size to 56 bits, reduced the block size to 64 bits, and made the cipher resistant against differential cryptanalysis, which was at the time known only to IBM and the NSA.

The name &quot;Lucifer&quot; was apparently a pun on &quot;Demon&quot;. This was in turn a truncation of &quot;Demonstration&quot;, the name for a privacy system Feistel was working on. The operating system used could not handle the longer name.

==Description of the Sorkin variant==
The variant described by has 16 Feistel rounds, like DES, but no initial or final permutations. The key and block sizes are both 128 bits. The Feistel function operates on a 64-bit half-block of data, together with a 64-bit subkey and 8 &quot;&quot;interchange control bits&quot; (ICBs). The ICBs control a swapping operation. The 64-bit data block is considered as a series of eight 8-bit bytes, and if the ICB corresponding to a particular byte is zero, the left and right 4-bit halves (nibbles) are swapped. If the ICB is one, the byte is left unchanged. Each byte is then operated on by two 4×4-bit S-boxes, denoted S0 and S1 — S0 operates on the left 4-bit nibble and S1 operates on the right. The resultant outputs are concatenated and then combined with the subkey using exclusive or (XOR); this is termed &quot;key interruption&quot;&quot;. This is followed by a permutation operation in two stages; the first permutes each byte under a fixed permutation. The second stage mixes bits between the bytes.

The key-scheduling algorithm is relatively simple. Initially, the 128 key bits are loaded into a shift register. Each round, the left 64 bits of the register form the subkey, and right eight bits form the ICB bits. After each round, the register is rotated 56 bits to the left.

<text>USA Tuesday Night Fights (also known as &quot;Friday Night Boxing&quot;, &quot;Wednesday Night Fights&quot;, and &quot;Thursday Night Fights&quot;) is a television boxing show. It aired from October 1, 1982 to August 25, 1998 on the USA Network; at one time it was the longest-running boxing show on television. The show debuted on October 1, 1982, and was originally called Friday Night Boxing, which aired from 1982 to 1984, and then in 1984, the boxing program moved to Wednesday nights and was called Wednesday Night Fights, which aired from 1984 to 1986, and in 1986, the boxing program moved to Thursday nights, and was called Thursday Night Fights, which aired from 1986 to 1990. In 1987, the boxing program finally moved to Tuesday nights, and the show was called Tuesday Night Fights.

&quot;USA Tuesday Night Fights&quot; was hosted by Al Albert, who co-hosted with boxing commentaries, first by Muhammad Ali trainer Angelo Dundee, who co-hosted with Albert from 1982 to 1984, and then, by Randy Gordon, who co-hosted with Albert from 1984 to 1987, and finally, by former champion Sean O&#x27;Grady, who co-hosted with Albert from 1987 until the show&#x27;s ending in 1998. Bill Macatee was often a substitute commentator for Albert. The show did not employ a regular ring announcer, but several high-profile announcers such as HBO&#x27;s Michael Buffer, Showtime&#x27;s Jimmy Lennon, Jr., Philadelphia boxing staple Ed Derian, and future &quot;BattleBots&quot; announcer Mark Beiro were featured with Derian and Beiro featured more frequently as the years went on.

The program was sponsored by Budweiser, and often referred to on air as &quot;Budweiser Presents USA Tuesday Night Fights&quot;. Pabst Blue Ribbon was also a sponsor of the program, continuing a tradition of the Pabst company sponsoring televised boxing matches. Like some of its similar fellow boxing programs, &quot;Tuesday Night Fights&quot; did not always emanate from large arenas. Instead, cards usually took place in smaller venues, such as The Blue Horizon in Philadelphia, the Felt Forum/Paramount Theater at Madison Square Garden in New York, or the ballroom of Casino Magic in Bay St. Louis, Mississippi. &quot;Tuesday Night Fights&quot; would also not limit itself to American venues, as they traveled to England, Mexico, and other places to televise shows. One show even took place aboard an aircraft carrier.

==Notable fights==
Few world title fights were presented in this show, one of the notable ones being when Vinny Pazienza, a former world Lightweight champion, moved up in weight and captured the WBA world Jr. Middleweight championship with an eleventh-round knockout of Gilbert Dele. Pazienza would ultimately relinquish the title following a car accident the following year. Written off from boxing by doctors after the accident, Pazienza would return to the ring with a win over Luis Santana, a fight which also aired on &quot;Tuesday Night Fights&quot;.

Another title fight aired by USA was the 1988 IBF featherweight title bout between defending champion Calvin Grove and contender Jorge Paez that took place in Mexicali, Mexico. The fight was significant in that it was the last ever title match scheduled for 15 rounds. The fight went the distance, with Paez earning a majority decision.

On March 19, 1996, USA featured a bout between Jeremy Williams and Arthur Weathers as the headline of their show broadcast from the Spruce Goose Dome in Williams&#x27; home of Long Beach, California. Williams, at the time a rising heavyweight contender, dropped Weathers with an uppercut almost immediately after the bell rang to start the contest and referee Marty Denkin called a halt to the contest after ten seconds, which was erroneously referred to as a world record for quickest knockout (although it remains one of the fastest ever).

On March 18, 1997, USA saw what is officially the world&#x27;s quickest knockout. The bout between heavyweights Jimmy Thunder and Crawford Grimsley lasted only 1.5 seconds after Thunder caught Grimsley with a right hook to the head that sent him to the canvas.

Both George Foreman and Larry Holmes were frequently featured on &quot;Tuesday Night Fights&quot; as they began to return after their initial retirements. Both fighters&#x27; comeback fights were aired on USA, and Holmes fought on a semi-regular basis on the program until he declared, on air, in 1996 that he would not likely fight again unless he could secure a title match.

A future opponent of Holmes, Butterbean, received some of his earliest exposure as a professional fighter by fighting several four rounders on &quot;Tuesday Night Fights&quot;.

Roberto Durán was another fixture on &quot;Tuesday Night Fights&quot; later in his career, and his 100th professional bout was carried by USA.

&quot;Tuesday Night Fights&quot; also showcased the bizarre from time to time. Among these was a fight from former pro football star Mark Gastineau&#x27;s controversial boxing career which saw him lose to a journeyman fighter, Andrew Golota&#x27;s infamous fight against Samson Po&#x27;uha in 1995 which saw the Polish fighter, who appeared frequently on &quot;Tuesday Night Fights&quot;, bite the neck of his opponent, a fight between Riddick Bowe and Elijah Tillery where Tillery was disqualified for kicking the future world champion and Bowe responded by knocking him out of the ring, and a bizarre fight between Sharmba Mitchell and Bazooka Limon where the former champion Limon pulled Mitchell&#x27;s trunks down during the action.

===Other world champions to fight on the show===
Many other world champions fought on this show, whether as prospects or later in their careers. This included names such as Oscar de La Hoya, Floyd Mayweather Jr., Roy Jones Jr., Arturo Gatti, Fernando Vargas, Hector Camacho, Tony Tubbs and Antonio Tarver. Pay Per View bouts were also rebroadcast on the show such as Julio César Chávez&#x27;s eighth-round knockout win over Joey Gamache, which was televised by the show, but as a Pay Per View feature only.

==Cancellation==
On April 9, 1998, USA Network founder Kay Koplovitz, who served as head of the USA Network since 1977 and who was instrumental in the USA Network&#x27;s programming structure, left the network, with new overall USA Network owner Barry Diller taking her positions as chairman and CEO. After taking Koplovitiz&#x27;s CEO position, Diller made plans to cut at least $40 million from the USA Network&#x27;s massive budget, which had been criticized for overspending on content which was not deemed feasible. In August 1998, USA Tuesday Night Fights was cancelled after programming changes were made and budget cuts reduced the ability to broadcast fights.

==Rebroadcasts==
In June 2006, CSI Sports, through its FIGHT SPORTS division, began airing a compilation of some of the best knockouts from the &quot;Tuesday Night Fights&quot; series titled &quot;USA Tuesday Night Fights: Knockouts!&quot; on pay-per-view. Narrated by Washington Redskins play-by-play man Larry Michael, the sixty-minute series featured various fights from throughout the years. One of the segments featured on the show was called &quot;In Case You Missed It...&quot;, this segment featured some memorable moments from &quot;Tuesday Night Fights&quot;, another segment called &quot;KO Time&quot;, featuring very quick knockouts that were a big hit with the fans, and &quot;Who Won This One?&quot;, the segment features the last fight of the program. It is promoted several times during the broadcast, and viewers are encouraged to pick which of the two men won the bout.. Reruns of this series air across the country on various sports channels, including MSG Plus.

The &quot;Tuesday Night Fights: Knockouts!&quot; series was also released on DVD in a two-volume box set.

CSI later came out with a series called &quot;Wide World of Fights&quot;, which has a much broader scope and includes mixed martial arts, kickboxing, and other combat sports footage in addition to some of the fights that were originally part of the &quot;Tuesday Night Fights&quot; compilation series. This series also airs on many of the same stations that carry &quot;Tuesday Night Fights: Knockouts!&quot;. CSI also airs old episodes of &quot;Tuesday Night Fights&quot; as part of its &quot;Fight Sports World Championship Boxing&quot; series, which rebroadcasts fights from the past.

<doc id="364266" wikidata="Q264516" url="?curid=364266" title="Abdul Razak Hussein">
<text>Abdul Razak bin Hussein (; 11 March 1922 – 14 January 1976) was a Malaysian lawyer and politician who served as the second prime minister of Malaysia from 1970 until his death in 1976. He also served as the first deputy prime minister of Malaysia from 1957 to 1970. He is referred to as the Father of Development (&quot;Bapa Pembangunan&quot;).

During his term as prime minister, Abdul Razak launched the Malaysian New Economic Policy (NEP), a program aimed at reducing the socioeconomic disparity between ethnic communities, particularly those of the ethnic Malay and Chinese. He also oversaw a realignment of Malaysia foreign policy away from his predecessor&#x27;s pro-West and anti-Communist attitude and towards neutrality, with the country becoming a member of the Non-Aligned Movement in 1970. Abdul Razak was also the figure responsible for setting up Barisan Nasional (BN), which held power uninterrupted from its inception in 1974 to 2018.

His eldest son, Najib Razak, became the sixth prime minister in 2009; however, later became infamous for his involvement in the 1MDB corruption scandal, which led to his conviction on multiple charges of corruption, abuse of power, and money laundering.

==Early life and education==
Born in Kampung Pulau Keladi, a village located northwest of Pekan, Pahang on 11 March 1922, Abdul Razak is the first of two children to Yang Dihormati (YDH) Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar ke-9, Dato&#x27; Hussein Awang bin Mohd Taib (1898–1950) and Datin Hajah Teh Fatimah bt Daud (1906–1968). An aristocratic descendant of &quot;Orang Kaya Indera Shahbandar&quot;, Abdul Razak studied at the Malay College Kuala Kangsar.

After joining the Malay Administrative Service in 1938, he was awarded a scholarship to study at Raffles College in Singapore in 1940. His studies at the college ceased with the onset of the Second World War. During the war he helped organise the &quot;Wataniah&quot; resistance movement in Pahang.

After World War II, Abdul Razak left for Britain in 1948 to study law. In 1950, he received a law degree and qualified as a barrister at Lincoln&#x27;s Inn in London. During his student days in England, Abdul Razak was a member of the British Labour Party and a prominent student leader of the Malay Association of Great Britain, and formed the student association Malayan Forum.

== Involvement in World War II ==

After his studies were interrupted in 1942 because of World War II, Abdul Razak returned to Kuantan, Pahang. There, he met his former colleague from the Malay Administrative Service, Yeop Mahidin, and expressed his interest in joining the Malay Regiment (now Royal Malay Regiment). Mahidin, who was also the founder of &quot;Askar Wataniah Pahang&quot; (&#x27;Pahang State Territorial Army&#x27;; precursor of the &quot;Rejimen Askar Wataniah&quot;), recruited Razak into his new guerrilla force. Upon the completion of his training, Razak was instructed to join the Japanese Malayan Civil Service as an agent and informant.

Razak, as an aristocrat and son of a respected Malay leader in Pahang, was posted to his home state of Pahang as an assistant to District Officer and at the same time as a bridge for the Japanese to gain the trust of local Malays. Using his privileges as an aristocrat, Razak started networking with the Imperial Japanese Forces while maintaining his connection with Yeop Mahidin. His role as an informant inside the Japanese Administration was only known to a few. Because of this, Razak was labelled as a traitor by the rest of the &quot;Wataniah Pahang&quot;.

As the Malay population received preferential treatment compared to other ethnic groups, it was not fully trusted by the British to oppose the Japanese occupation. Nevertheless, the &quot;Askar Wataniah Pahang&quot; with its 200 members were absorbed into the Special Operations Executive (SOE) and organised under Force 136.

Force 136 Pahang&#x27;s missions&#x27; continuous success made the Japanese Administration begin to suspect that there were informants inside their administration. Force 136 Pahang quickly set up an extraction mission to recover their agent, Razak, who was still unknown to many of its members.

==Political involvement==
Upon his return from the United Kingdom, in 1950, Tun Razak joined the Malayan Civil Service. Owing to his political calibre, he became the youth chief for United Malays National Organisation (UMNO). Two years later, he worked as the Assistant State Secretary of Pahang and in February 1955, at just 33 years of age, became Pahang&#x27;s Chief Minister.

Razak stood in and won a seat in Malaya&#x27;s first general elections in July 1955 and was appointed as the Education Minister. He was instrumental in the drafting of the Razak Report which formed the basis of the Malayan education system. Tun Razak was also a key member of the February 1956 mission to London to seek the independence of Malaya from the British.

After the general elections in 1959, he became the Minister of Rural Development in addition to holding the portfolios of Deputy Prime Minister and Minister of Defence, which he held from 1957. His achievements include formulating the development policy known as the Red Book.

==Cultivating a new generation==

At the time of Separation of Singapore from the Federation of Malaysia in 1965, Tun Razak realised that UMNO needed more young leaders in the party. He understood that power resided in the Malay community and that for this power to be wielded effectively, the elite among the Malays had to be an elite determined by ability, aptitude and commitment to the nation as a whole. Class, birth and money were secondary in his calculations.

As a consequence of this initiative, the then young leaders of mixed heritage in UMNO, such as Mahathir Mohamad, were drafted into higher echelons of the political establishment.

In 1967 he was awarded the Ramon Magsaysay Award for community leadership.

==Premiership==
After the 13 May Incident 1969, Tunku Abdul Rahman Putra Al-Haj received many criticisms from various parties for his inability to deal with racial issues. This led to his resignation as prime minister. Tun Abdul Razak then imposed a State of Emergency, ruling by decree as the National Operations Council until 1970. In September 1970, Tunku Abdul Rahman was succeeded by Tun Abdul Razak as the Prime Minister of Malaysia.

Tun Razak set up the Barisan Nasional or National Front on 1 January 1973 to replace the ruling Alliance Party. He increased the membership of its parties and coalitions in an effort to establish &quot;Ketahanan Nasional&quot; (National Strength) through political stability.

Tun Razak is also renowned for launching the Malaysian New Economic Policy (MNEP) in 1971. He and the &quot;second generation&quot; of Malay politicians saw the need to tackle vigorously the economic and social disparities which fuelled racial antagonisms and violence. The MNEP set two basics goals – to reduce and eventually eradicate poverty, and to reduce and eventually eradicate identification of economic function with race.

==Death==
Abdul Razak was diagnosed with leukemia but kept it secret since 1969.

Abdul Razak died in office on 14 January 1976 while seeking medical treatment in London. He was posthumously granted the soubriquet &quot;Bapa Pembangunan&quot; (&#x27;Father of Development&#x27;). He was laid to rest in Heroes Mausoleum () near Masjid Negara, Kuala Lumpur.

<text>Benjamin Peirce (; April 4, 1809 – October 6, 1880) was an American mathematician who taught at Harvard University for approximately 50 years. He made contributions to celestial mechanics, statistics, number theory, algebra, and the philosophy of mathematics.

==Early life==
He was born in Salem, Massachusetts, the son of first cousins Benjamin Peirce (1778–1831), later librarian of Harvard, and Lydia Ropes Nichols Peirce (1781–1868).

After graduating from Harvard University in 1829, he taught mathematics for two years at the Round Hill School in Northampton, and in 1831 was appointed professor of mathematics at Harvard. He added astronomy to his portfolio in 1842, and remained as Harvard professor until his death. In addition, he was instrumental in the development of Harvard&#x27;s science curriculum, served as the college librarian, and was director of the United States Coast Survey from 1867 to 1874.
In 1842, he was elected as a member of the American Philosophical Society. He was elected a Foreign Member of the Royal Society of London in 1852.

==Research==
Benjamin Peirce is often regarded as the earliest American scientist whose research was recognized as world class. He was an apologist for slavery, opining that it should be condoned if it was used to allow an elite to pursue scientific enquiry.

===Mathematics===
In number theory, he proved there is no odd perfect number with fewer than four prime factors.

In algebra, he was notable for the study of associative algebras. He first introduced the terms idempotent and nilpotent in 1870 to describe elements of these algebras, and he also introduced the Peirce decomposition.

In the philosophy of mathematics, he became known for the statement that &quot;Mathematics is the science that draws necessary conclusions&quot;. Peirce&#x27;s definition of mathematics was credited by his son, Charles Sanders Peirce, as helping to initiate the consequence-oriented philosophy of pragmatism. Like George Boole, Peirce believed that mathematics could be used to study logic. These ideas were further developed by his son Charles, who noted that logic also includes the study of faulty reasoning. In contrast, the later logicist program of Gottlob Frege and Bertrand Russell attempted to base mathematics on logic.

===Statistics===
Peirce proposed what came to be known as Peirce&#x27;s Criterion for the statistical treatment of outliers, that is, of apparently extreme observations. His ideas were further developed by his son Charles.

Peirce was an expert witness in the Howland will forgery trial, where he was assisted by his son Charles. Their analysis of the questioned signature showed that it resembled another particular handwriting example so closely that the chance of such a match occurring at random, i.e. by pure coincidence, was extremely small.

==Private life==
He was devoutly religious, though he seldom published his theological thoughts. Peirce credited God as shaping nature in ways that account for the efficacy of pure mathematics in describing empirical phenomena. Peirce viewed &quot;mathematics as study of God&#x27;s work by God&#x27;s creatures&quot;, according to an encyclopedia. He was an avid juggler of diabolo and wrote about the physics of the game in &quot;Analytic Mechanics&quot;.

He married Sarah Hunt Mills, the daughter of U.S. Senator Elijah Hunt Mills. Peirce and his wife had four sons and one daughter:
* James Mills Peirce (1834–1906), who also taught mathematics at Harvard and succeeded to his father&#x27;s professorship,
* Charles Sanders Peirce (1839–1914), a famous logician, polymath and philosopher,
* Benjamin Mills Peirce (1844–1870), who worked as a mining engineer before an early death,
* Helen Huntington Peirce Ellis (1845–1923), who married William Rogers Ellis, and
* Herbert Henry Davis Peirce (1849–1916), who pursued a career in the Foreign Service.

==Eponyms==
The lunar crater Peirce is named for Peirce, as well as the asteroid 29463 Benjaminpeirce.

Post-doctoral positions in Harvard University&#x27;s mathematics department are named in his honor as Benjamin Peirce Fellows and Lecturers.

The United States Coast Survey ship , in commission from 1855 to 1868, was named for him.

<text>Robert Koffler Jarvik (born May 11, 1946) is an American scientist, researcher, and entrepreneur known for his role in developing the Jarvik-7 artificial heart.

==Early life==
Robert Jarvik was born in Midland, Michigan, to Norman Eugene Jarvik and Edythe Koffler Jarvik, and raised in Stamford, Connecticut. He is brother to Jonathan Jarvik, a biological-sciences professor at Carnegie Mellon University, as well as the nephew of Murray Jarvik, a pharmacologist who co-invented the nicotine patch. At an early age Jarvik showed interest in mechanics and medicine, which would later influence his work. By the age of 17 he had already obtained five patents for his inventions.

Jarvik is a graduate of Syracuse University. He earned a master&#x27;s degree in medical engineering from New York University.

After being admitted to the University of Utah School of Medicine, Jarvik completed two years of study, and in 1971 was hired by Willem Johan Kolff, a Dutch-born physician-inventor at the University of Utah, who produced the first dialysis machine, and who was working on other artificial organs, including a heart. Jarvik received his M.D. in 1976 from the University of Utah. Jarvik is a medical scientist - he did not complete a clinical internship or residency and has never been licensed to practice medicine.

==Career==
Jarvik joined the University of Utah&#x27;s artificial organs program in 1971, then headed by Willem Johan Kolff, his mentor. At the time, the program used a pneumatic artificial heart design by Clifford Kwan-Gett that had sustained an animal in the lab for 10 days. Kolff assigned Jarvik to design a new heart that would overcome the problems of the Kwan-Gett heart, eventually culminating with the Jarvik-7 device.

In 1982, the team carried out an artificial heart implant - the second ever, 13 years after Domingo Liotta and Denton Cooley&#x27;s first in 1969. William DeVries first implanted the Jarvik-7 into retired dentist Barney Clark at the University of Utah on December 1, 1982. Clark required frequent visits to the hospital for the next 112 days, after which he died. During frequent press conferences to update the patient&#x27;s condition, Jarvik, along with DeVries, briefed the world&#x27;s media on Clark&#x27;s condition. The next several implantations of the Jarvik-7 heart were conducted by Humana, a large health care insurance company. The second patient, William J. Schroeder, survived 620 days. In 1983, Jarvik and DeVries received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement.

In 2006, Jarvik began appearing in television commercials for Pfizer&#x27;s cholesterol medication Lipitor. Two members of Congress, as part of their campaign against celebrity endorsements, began an investigation as to whether his television advertisements constitute medical advice given without a license to practice medicine. One commercial depicted Jarvik rowing, he did not row himself, and a body double was used. Later, Jarvik said that he had not taken Lipitor until becoming a spokesman for the company. On February 25, 2008, Pfizer announced that it would discontinue its ads with Jarvik.

==Personal life==
Jarvik has been married twice. He has a son and daughter with his first wife, Salt Lake City writer and journalist Elaine Jarvik. In 2011, she and her daughter wrote the play &quot;A Man Enters&quot;, inspired by Jarvik&#x27;s absent-father relationship with his children since the couple&#x27;s divorce.

Jarvik has been married to &quot;Parade&quot; magazine columnist Marilyn vos Savant since August 23, 1987.

Contrary to some sources, Jarvik is not a member of the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints.

<text>Tunku Abdul Rahman (8 February 19036 December 1990), commonly referred to as Tunku, was a Malaysian statesman who served as prime minister of Malaysia from 1957 to 1970. He previously served as the only chief minister of Malaya from 1955 to 1957, as President of UMNO from 1951 to 1971, and as leader of the Alliance Party from 1952 to 1971. Abdul Rahman was the second longest serving Malaysian prime minister and the first to hold the position. As prime minister, he supervised the Malayan independence process and the formation of Malaysia. As a result, he is widely regarded as Malaysia&#x27;s &quot;founding father&quot;.

Born a prince in the Kedah Sultanate, Tunku studied law in St Catharine&#x27;s College, Cambridge, and became a civil servant and district officer. In 1949, he became a prosecutor. In 1951, he defeated C. M. Yusuf and Ahmad Fuad Hassan in the UMNO party leadership election to become President of UMNO. In 1952, he led UMNO into an electoral pact with MCA and MIC under the Alliance Party. He then led Alliance to a landslide victory during the 1955 general elections, and became chief minister of Malaya in a coalition government. 

Upon becoming chief minister, Tunku sought to end the Emergency with the Malayan Communist Party in a series of peace talks, but failed. In 1956, he initiated negotiations for Malayan independence from the United Kingdom, which was secured in the Treaty of London. In 1957, he led the Malayan proclamation of independence, and became its first prime minister. He secured his second term in 1959, and was instrumental in the formation of Malaysia in 1963, where he remained as prime minister. He guided the Alliance to a third term in 1964, but was faced with domestic political instabilities, notably its relationship with Singapore, causing its expulsion from Malaysia in 1965. Although he ran for a fourth term in the 1969 general elections and won a narrow majority, post election demonstrations sparked racial riots nationwide, and he resigned in 1970, succeeded by Abdul Razak Hussein, his deputy prime minister.

After retiring from politics in 1971, Tunku remained active in sports and religious affairs, serving as the president of the Asian Football Confederation from 1958 to 1977, and as the first secretary-general of the Organisation of Islamic Cooperation from 1970 to 1973. He briefly returned to politics in the 1980s and opposed Mahathir Mohamad during the 1988 Malaysian constitutional crisis, publicly endorsing Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah and Parti Melayu Semangat 46 in the 1990 general elections. In 1990, he died in Kuala Lumpur at the age of 87. 

==Early life==

===Childhood===
Tunku Abdul Rahman was born on 8 February 1903, in Alor Setar, Kedah, the seventh son and one of 45 children of Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah, the 26th ruler of the Kedah Sultanate. Tunku&#x27;s mother was Cik Menyelara (Nueang Nandanagara), a Thai, and the sixth wife of Sultan Abdul Hamid Halim Shah; she was the daughter of Luang Naraborirak (Kleb Nandanagara), a district officer in Thailand. Cholera and malaria were very common in Kedah at the time and at least two of Tunku&#x27;s brothers and his older sister died from cholera while Tunku himself suffered from intermittent attacks of malaria until he left for London in 1920.

He received early education at the Alor Setar Malay Primary School before furthering his studies at the government English school, Sultan Abdul Hamid College. He and his siblings were later sent by his parents to Debsirin School in Bangkok. He returned home in 1915 to continue his education at the Penang Free School.

===University===

When the Tunku was 17, he won the Kedah State Government scholarship to further his studies at Cambridge University.

After about a year, he realised that he was making very little progress in his studies. After a meeting with Mr. Ezekiel, his guardian, in the office of the Crown Agents, Ezekiel arranged for the Tunku to move to Cambridge and to be taught by and live with Basil Atkinson. Atkinson was an experienced tutor and he also prepared Tunku to sit in a university entrance examination known as &quot;Little Go&quot;. The following year, he took the entrance exams and he obtained high marks for all his papers with a Pass for the whole examination. He was accepted as an undergraduate at St Catharine&#x27;s College, one of the colleges of the University of Cambridge, and graduated with a bachelor&#x27;s degree of Arts in Law and History in 1925.

Five years after sailing from Singapore, at the age of 23, he sailed home. The Crown Agents secured the Tunku a berth in a passenger ship, which stopped at Penang. Tunku Ibrahim, the Regent, and his eldest brother was unhappy with his choice of degrees and he ordered him to return to England to be admitted to the English Bar. On Tunku&#x27;s initiative, the Malay Society of Great Britain was formed, with Tuanku Abdul Rahman of Negeri Sembilan (later the 1st Yang Di-Pertuan Agong) as president and Tunku Abdul Rahman of Kedah as Honorary Secretary and the driving force.

==Career in Kedah==

===Kulim===
In January 1931, the Tunku was appointed a Cadet in the Kedah Civil Service. Later, he was transferred to Kulim as Assistant District Officer. In Kulim, he devoted much of his time touring the district and getting to know the problems of the peasants who made up 90% of the population. He also devoted some of his time to prepare for Cadet&#x27;s Law exam to qualify for the promotion. He took the exams and passed them on his first attempt.

===Padang Terap===

About a year later, he was promoted to District Officer of Padang Terap. The post was unpopular because Kuala Nerang was rife with malaria. As soon as he took over the district, he gave orders for a survey to be made of the swamps which bordered the town, obtained an estimate for draining them, and applied to the State Secretariat for the necessary funds. However, his plea for funds was rejected. He wrote again to the State Secretariat, asking that funds be made available to drain the swamps and to rid Kuala Nerang of the main breeding place malaria carriers. This time the money came and the work was carried out under his supervision.

===Langkawi===

Because Tunku Ibrahim, the Regent, was known to be strongly opposed to mixed marriages and since there was a law in Kedah which forbade members of the royal family to marry non-Malays without the prior approval of the Ruler or Regent, the Tunku Abdul Rahman married Violet Coulson who lived in Penang. In 1934, the regent died unexpectedly and was succeeded as regent by Tunku Mahmud, the sultan&#x27;s younger brother, who was more broad-minded and gave consent to the marriage. This enabled Violet to move to Kuala Nerang, but the Secretary to the Government showed his disapproval by transferring Tunku Abdul Rahman to the isolated post of District Officer at Langkawi.

The district consisted of a group of islands, thinly populated, sparsely cultivated, and without roads. When the Tunku applied for government funds to develop Langkawi his application was rejected. Ever-resourceful, his way in winning co-operation from members of the public of all communities led to the construction of a jetty and later to the opening of several earth roads using money and material which he collected.

==World War II and the Japanese occupation==

While in London, he sat once more for the Bar Examinations, as he planned to leave the Civil Service, and to enter private practice as soon as he had qualified as an advocate and solicitor. He succeeded in passing the Part One Examination, in 1939. However, with the advent of World War II, he was recalled to Malaya and ordered to resume duty as District Officer in Kulim, where he remained for the next three years.

He was responsible for the Civil Defence preparations implemented by district officers. He was appointed Deputy Director of Air Raid Precautions for South Kedah. He recognised the need to prepare for the evacuation of civilians in the event of an invasion and in 1941 he gave orders for the construction of six &quot;Long Houses&quot; made of round timber and with attap roofs on a low hill about two miles away from the town. Funds for this work had been refused by the State Secretariat and he, therefore, invited donations from local town dwellers who would benefit if evacuations became necessary.

By October 1941, British troops had prepared defensive positions in North Kedah. On the morning of 8 December 1941, the Invasion by the Japanese army began. The attack was quickly followed by the advance of General Yamashita&#x27;s army which had landed unopposed on beaches near Songkla the previous night. A second assault force came ashore, unopposed, on the coast of Petani and advanced towards Betong and Kroh. A third but smaller force landed close to Kota Bahru in Kelantan despite vigorous opposition.

Unaware of the extent of the Japanese attack, he went to his office and ordered a general alert for his air wardens. Later that morning, he met the leading shopkeepers and advised them to evacuate their families to the &quot;Long House&quot;.

His eldest surviving brother, Tunku Badlishah, had succeeded Tunku Mahmud as Regent in 1937 when the latter died. He was now in control, since Sultan Abdul Hamid, although still alive, was incapacitated. At about 9 o&#x27;clock on the night of the invasion, Syed Omar telephoned Tunku and told him that the Regent had decided to evacuate the 77-year-old Sultan to Penang, and thence to Singapore. Tunku disagreed with this decision, feeling the need for the Sultan to remain with his people, he absconded with him during the journey. Soon after, the Japanese began bombing Penang.

===Occupation===

With the Japanese&#x27;s bombing Penang, the Regent and his family fled. They were given accommodation in Sidim when the second and more severe bombing of Penang town took place on 11 December 1941, which caused hundreds of civilians to be killed. Upon returning, to Kulim, Tunku found out that all the Police were no longer on duty. Tunku&#x27;s first concern was to prevent looting and he called all members of the disbanded Kedah Volunteer Force in Kulim to come to his assistance. These men formed a vigilante corps and Tunku arranged for them to patrol the town at night. He was also responsible for the acquiring of emergency food stores from the Government Rice Mill at Bagan Serai in Perak. By 16 December 1941, the Japanese army had occupied the west coast of Kedah, including all the main towns. The Japanese Military Governor of Kedah an assuming office appointed another of Tunku&#x27;s brothers, Tunku Mohamed Jewa, to be a temporary Regent until the Sultan returned to Alor Setar.

On 17 December, the Sultan, the Regent, and his family and senior officers of the State Government set off for Alor Setar with a Japanese military escort. In Kulim, Tunku reluctantly remained as District Officer for another year as a servant to the Japanese Military Administration.

Friction between Tunku and the Japanese officials were frequent, and he was removed from his position of authority. The Siamese was then put in charge. Soon after the takeover by the Siamese, Tunku was appointed the Superintendent of Education.

In 1942, the Japanese transported thousands of young male Malayans to work on the construction of a railway from North Siam to Burma. Tunku helped house and feed some escapees from the railway construction project at considerable risk to himself.

On 6 and 9 August 1945, atom bombs were dropped on Hiroshima and Nagasaki respectively. A week later, the Japanese Imperial government in Tokyo agreed to an unconditional surrender.

===Malayan Peoples&#x27; Anti-Japanese Army movement (MPAJA)===

When the Japanese surrender was announced over the wireless in mid-August, plans were hurriedly prepared in Ceylon for the dispatch of a British Military Administration. At the same time, the top Chinese Communist leaders in Malaya, Fong Chong Pik, who was nicknamed &quot;the Plen&quot; and a young Chinese Rebel named Chin Peng decided to try to seize control of the civil administration in as many states as possible. Tunku and his followers were responsible for the peace-keeping efforts and the protection of Alor Setar from the Malayan People&#x27;s Anti-Japanese Army.

==Malayan Union and study leave==

=== Protest against Malayan Union ===

On 19 August, the surrender of the Japanese Army had become common knowledge in Alor Setar. With the Japanese surrender, several groups of people talked about independence and discussed how it might be attained. Malay societies were formed all over the peninsular with similar objectives, but with no coordination. On 10 October 1945, the Secretary of State for the Colonies issued his Policy Statement on a &quot;Malayan Union&quot;. In Kedah, both the principal Malay organisations held protest meetings and rallies. Tunku spoke forcefully at these rallies, but he recommended opposition by peaceful means.

Sir Harold MacMichael, representing the British Government, arrived in Kuala Lumpur on 11 October 1945. He came to Alor Setar after visiting the Sultans of Johor, Selangor, Pahang, and Perak and securing their signatures to a new treaty. In Kedah, MacMichael was told that the Ruler would consult his Council of State before discussing with him. With these consultations proceeded, rallies and processions in opposition to the treaty were held in every district and the center of Alor Setar. Tunku was one of the most popular speakers in Alor Setar, Sungai Petani, and Kulim, but he was not invited to take part in any of the discussions convened by his half-brother, Sultan Badlishah. After three days of negotiations, the Sultan followed the example of his brother rulers. The Sultan&#x27;s surrender was vigorously criticised by the public and by Tunku. MacMichael flew back to London after securing all the signatures from the rulers for the new treaty. Then the British Prime Minister announced that the Malayan Union would come into effect on 1 April 1946.

A British officer who had held Tunku&#x27;s post before the war was appointed Superintendent of Education, Kedah in his place. The State Government did not give Tunku any new position. During this period, Tunku held no office in any Malay organisation.

===Law Studies===

Tunku applied for 18 months&#x27; study leave and arranged to return to England to resume his law studies. He arrived in bunker on 27 December 1946 and travelled by train to London, and remained there for the next 18 months.

When he passed all his law exams, Tunku sailed back to Malaya on the P.&amp;.O. Corfu in January 1949 to be met by his wife, children, and friends in Penang. A few days later he called on the Secretary to the Government to inform him that he was now a qualified advocate and solicitor, but the reception was neutral. Tunku was instructed to report to the State Legal Advisor for duty as a deputy public prosecutor. His work was routine and he spent his days reading case files.

==Political career==

===United Malay National Organisation (UMNO)===

Tunku was invited to accept the chairmanship of the Kedah branch of UMNO, the political party which had been formed by Dato&#x27; Onn Jaafar. But before long, the Attorney-General, Fosters-Sutton, visited Kedah and met Tunku in his office to ask if he would like to take up a new appointment in Kuala Lumpur, which Tunku accepted. In Kuala Lumpur, Tunku was allotted an office in the Federal Secretariat, together with other Deputy Public Prosecutors. Tunku&#x27;s work received a favourable report and he was transferred with promotion, to the post of President of the Selangor Court. At the same time, a political crisis was brewing in UMNO. When the Communist revolutionaries launched an armed rebellion from jungle bases during the Malayan Emergency, UMNO founder and president, Onn, felt the need for racial harmony and a non-communal political party.

A General Assembly was to be held in Kuala Lumpur in August 1951, and Onn had made it known that if his proposals were not accepted in this meeting, he would resign. Malay leaders while discussing the crisis recognised that they must find a successor to Onn. At that time, Tunku&#x27;s qualities and ability as a leader were almost unknown outside Kedah. Finally, three candidates, including Tunku, were suggested to be nominated for the post of President if Onn stepped down. Abdul Razak, the State Secretary of Pahang and UMNO vice president went to meet Tunku in his house, to ask him to agree to the nomination, but Tunku was reluctant. Instead, Tunku replied that Razak himself was much better qualified to be nominated. But Razak convinced Tunku that he was much too young to gain the support of the Malay masses.

After much persuasion, Tunku reluctantly accepted the nomination. The UMNO Assembly met on 23 August 1951, where Tunku received 57 votes and his nearest rival had 11. In his acceptance speech, Tunku demanded that independence should be granted to Malaya as soon as possible. Tunku was still President of the Sessions Court in Kuala Lumpur, with daily duties to perform drawing a government salary and living in government quarters. Tunku informed the Chief Justice of his intention to resign from government service.

In the eyes of the average UMNO member, Tunku was first and foremost the brother of the Sultan of Kedah, and a member of a royal house, which carried some prestige within Malaya. Tunku had acquired a wealth of experience as a district officer in Kedah, which enables him to understand and sympathise with the problems of the rural population, who made up a large proportion of the UMNO membership.

===Alliance Party===

At the time of Onn Jaafar&#x27;s resignation from the presidency of UMNO, he had predicted that the party would disintegrate within three months. But even before the end of that period, it became clear that although influential Chinese and some prominent Indians and Ceylonese had become members of Onn Jaafar&#x27;s new party, very few Malays had done so. Tunku held and expressed the view that Malayan communities could not be united within a single political party. He believed that each community needs its political party and its political leaders, and he was proven to be right. The first trial of strength between all the rival political parties took place in January 1952.

On 6 October 1951, Sir Henry Gurney was killed in an ambush by communist revolutionaries. He was replaced by General Sir Gerald Templer who brought with him a new policy from the British Government in London. Templer was to guide the people of Malaya towards the attainment of a United Malayan Nation. The policy had also called for the partnership of all communities. To put this new policy into effect, the government had agreed to hold elections at the Municipal and Town Council level, as the first step towards a democratic government, and Kuala Lumpur was chosen as one of the venues for the experiment. All the existing political parties were prepared to contest.

One of these political organisation was the Malayan Chinese Association, or MCA. MCA was brought into existence in 1949 by two men, Colonel H. S. Lee, the President of the Selangor Mining Association, and Tan Cheng Lock of Malacca. It occurred to him that if MCA and UMNO allied at the municipal level, their chances of success would be greater. Together with his deputy, they met and sought the approval of Dato&#x27; Yahaya, the Chairman of UMNO in Kuala Lumpur. They quickly reached an agreement. Under the chairmanship of Col. H. S. Lee, a combined committee from the MCA and UMNO was formed and 12 candidates were selected, one for each area, some Malays, some Chinese, and one Indian. The committee then began a vigorous campaign to enlist support for &quot;The Alliance&quot;.

News of the venture appeared in all the leading newspapers. Tunku was in Province Wellesley when he read the news. He received a telephone call from a UMNO leader in Kuala Lumpur asking him to come back at once for a discussion. On his way to meet the UMNO leaders in Kuala Lumpur, he saw a leading member of Independence of Malaya Party, or IMP, and asked for his opinion of the &quot;Alliance&quot;. Tunku was confronted by protesting political colleagues, but he told them that he supported the Alliance and Intended to help in the campaign in Kuala Lumpur.

At the counting of votes on 16 February 1952, the &quot;Alliance&quot; won nine seats, IMP, two, and an Independent one. The success of the UMNO-MCA alliance was repeated in other municipal and town council elections, starting in Johor Bahru, where, to the chagrin of Dato&#x27; Onn, the Alliance won all the seats.

Tunku followed up the Municipal elections by holding a &#x27;Round Table Conference&#x27; on 3 February 1953, attended by leaders of the MCA and UMNO, in the Selangor Miner&#x27;s Club, Kuala Lumpur. Everyone agreed to establish a permanent alliance of UMNO and MCA as a political body with Independence for Malaya as its principal objective.

They also discussed the possibility of forming a united front with the Independence of Malayan Party, or the IMP. Tunku arranged a meeting with Onn. He brought H. S. Lee and Dr. Ismail. Onn brought three lawyers and two Malay civil servants. At the meeting, Onn told Tunku that IMP could only work together with the Alliance leaders if they disbanded the Alliance and joined IMP. Tunku tried to find some ground for compromise, but Onn was adamant and the meeting ended. Tunku disagreed fundamentally with Onn&#x27;s conception of a single political party consisting of members of all communities. He knew by instinct that each community needed its political party. The challenge that lay before him was finding a way to unite the communal parties. Soon, the Alliance leaders met again to discuss their campaign. They drew up proposals that included a request for an elected majority and a firm date for the first elections.

At the Legislative Council, when the demands by the Alliance were discussed, Onn told the Legislative Council that the holding of the elections should be planned as a gradual process and he questioned Tunku&#x27;s demand. Onn&#x27;s remarks were relayed to the Secretary of State and damaged Tunku&#x27;s image.

===Meeting in London===

In August 1953, Gerald Templer offered Tunku a portfolio in the Government, but Tunku refused it. Earlier in July 1953, the government set up a working committee to examine the possibility of holding State and Federal Elections. The committee was set up after Templer obtained the concurrence of Malay Rulers who at first were quite reluctant to accept such proposals due to their deep-rooted fear of what might befall them if Independence were granted. When the names of the members of the Election Committee were announced, Tunku observed that a majority of them were Onn Jaafar&#x27;s supporters.

During the discussion, the members found themselves in two groups. The majority approved certain recommendations while the Alliance minority disagreed and made their proposals. When the majority of recommendations were accepted and proposed by the Government. Alliance representatives all over the country attacked the Government&#x27;s proposals with a new rallying cry – &#x27;Merdeka&#x27;. By then, recommendations had been forwarded to London, and Tunku in consultations with the Alliance leaders decided that they must ask for an interview with the Secretary of State in London. Tunku sent a long telegram to the Secretary of State asking him to meet a delegation from the Alliance.

On 14 April 1954, a reply was received from the Secretary of State who rejected the request for an interview. Emergency meetings of UMNO and MCA leaders were held and a decision was made. The decision was severely criticised both inside and outside the Alliance and it required great courage and determination for Tunku to proceed. Next were the financial problems. Tunku called for an emergency meeting at UMNO in Malacca where he asked for financial help. The response from UMNO members was swift. A quantity of money and even personal jewellery were handed to Tunku. After some final travel arrangements, Tunku and T.H Tan left Singapore on 21 April 1954, for London. Tunku flew to London all too conscious of the doubts of his Alliance partners and the strong criticism from Government officials.

Before he left, he was aware that Onn Jaafar had dissolved IMP and formed a new political party called &#x27;Parti Negara&#x27;. Onn had abandoned his vision of an all-communities party and directed his attention to the Malay community. Tunku realised that Parti Negara would attempt to weaken UMNO and subvert some of his UMNO supporters. But Tunku also knew that he must act now if the granting of Independence was not to be delayed indefinitely. London in mid-April 1954 was cold, damp, and cheerless. There was not even one press reporter to meet Tunku. Knowing their financial resources were limited, Tunku took T.H. Tan with him to Gloucester Road Hotel and booked a double room. He then telephoned his old friend, David Rees, who was now a prominent member of the British Labour Party.

David Rees was the Parliamentary Under-Secretary of State for the Colonies under the Labour government from 1947 to 1950. David Rees was a valuable and influential ally. Tunku and Tan went to meet him the next morning in his chambers near the Inner Temple. David Rees promised to do everything possible to persuade Oliver Lyttleton to receive Tunku and his delegation. His persuasion proved to be potent, and on 24 April, Lyttleton agreed to meet Tunku. However, there was one problem. Lyttleton had arranged to leave for Uganda on an official visit on the following day and would not return until 10 May. It was a long time to wait and it would be stretch their financial resources to the limit, but Tunku decided to stay on.

Meanwhile, with David Rees&#x27;s help, Tunku gave a press conference at which he explained the popular support for the Alliance. He then had meetings with members of parliament of all three parties. Tunku&#x27;s relaxed manner, the fluency of his spoken English and his genial personality attracted his audience and provided ample justification for his mission. When the contents of the &#x27;Election Proposal&#x27; were released by the Colonial Office only then did Tunku discover that the Secretary of State had not accepted all the recommendations of the Election Committee. But Tunku was not satisfied. He had asked for at least 60 elected members. A substantial majority of elected members was essential.

While Lyttleton was overseas Tunku prepared his brief and on 14 May, Tunku, Abdul Razak and T.H Tan were ushered into the Secretary of State&#x27;s room in the Colonial Office. Tunku explained in detail the Alliance&#x27;s views on the importance of a workable elected majority and the need for early elections, but the Secretary of State insisted that the Alliance try out the Colonial Office Election proposals. Tunku pressed on further for an agreement on at least three-fifths of the elected majority but the Secretary of State wouldn&#x27;t commit to his suggestion.

Finally, the meeting came to an end. Tunku had to fly back on 20 May, to attend the debate on the Elections Committee proposals in the Legislative Council. A letter from the Colonial Office was delivered to Tunku&#x27;s hotel room on 19 May. It was beautifully phrased, but the contents could be summarised in two words – no change. T.H Tan cabled the gist of the reply to the Alliance co-chairman, Tan Cheng Lock. He and Tunku then left London the next day, leaving Abdul Razak to open a UMNO-MCA Merdeka Freedom Bureau through which publicity material in support of early independence could be distributed in England.

===Boycott===

In Kuala Lumpur, Tunku met members of the UMNO Executive Committee in the morning, and the &quot;Alliance Round Table&quot; members the same night. The Alliance leaders accepted the view that the mission had achieved a measure of success. It was also agreed that the request from the Secretary of State to give the elections proposals a trial could not be accepted. They prepared a resolution which was drafted by Col. H.S. Lee, rejecting the Colonial Office proposals. The next day, Tunku, Dr. Ismail and Leong Yew Koh, the Secretary-General of MCA took the Resolution to General Templer&#x27;s office. Templer read the document without comment and then requested that the release of the resolutions to the press be delayed.

At the Alliance Round Table meeting that night, the Alliance was adamant and the boycott went into effect. About a thousand Alliance members at all levels took part. It was a subtle process with results that were not immediately felt, but which were cumulative. The boycott was widely criticised. The Secretary of State called for consultations with the Rulers by the High Commissioner. Tunku decided that the Alliance should take the initiative and present their views first.

That day, nearly 2,000 Alliance supporters assembled at the government office building in support of the proposals. Attempts to break the Alliance boycott were made by Michael Hogan, the Attorney General, and David Gray, the acting Chief Secretary, Hogan and Gray met MacGillivray with their suggestions, and the High Commissioner agreed to their initiative.

Hogan and Gray then met H.S. Lee in Kuala Lumpur and explained the motive of their visit. H. S. Lee then contacted Tunku and Dr. Ismail who was in Johor Bahru with the news. Tunku reacted positively to the compromise offered but he wanted further assurance from the High Commissioner himself. On 6 July, MacGillivray signed a letter agreeing to the Alliance&#x27;s request after receiving approval from Lyttleton. The Alliance then called off the boycott.

===Elections===

After The Alliance called off the boycott, Elections to State Councils with Alliance participation could now proceed. Tunku and his colleagues travelled tirelessly to prepare for the coming trial of strength. Tunku took Tan Cheng Lock and H.S Lee with him whenever possible and in particular when touring the northern Malay states, and emphasised the importance of unity among Malayans of all communities. At each State capital, the Alliance leaders called on the Ruler and assured him of their loyalty and support.

The links between UMNO and MCA grew stronger and on Tunku&#x27;s initiative, a National Council which became the supreme executive body of the Alliance was established. It took the place of the &#x27;Round Table&#x27; which had no executive power and Tunku was formally recognised as &#x27;Leader of the Alliance&#x27;. The first two elections to State Councils took place late in 1954 in Johor and Terengganu. In both states, the Alliance won sweeping victories. Parti Negara did not capture a single seat. Tunku was now a popular figure in every state and almost every kampung. He travelled constantly.

Towards the end of 1954, Tunku was invited by the Director of Operations to serve on the Federation War Executive Committee. The government had promised to hold elections to the Federal Legislative Council in 1955, and in March of that year, it was announced that Nomination Day would be in June and that 27 July would be Election Day. Many Malay government officers resigned to offer themselves as candidates. As nomination day approached, Tunku was plagued by demands that a high proportion of the candidates should be Malay.

Tunku brought the matter to the next UMNO Assembly and urged the members to adopt what he called &quot;a policy of racial unselfishness&quot;. Tunku&#x27;s arguments were compelling and he won a unanimous vote of confidence. Almost at the eleventh hour, Tunku&#x27;s repeated emphasis on the importance of unity during the elections brought him a bonus. The Malayan Indian Congress, MIC, which had wavered in its support of Parti Negara, now promised to back the Alliance, representing the Indian community.

On Nomination Day, the Alliance entered a candidate in every one of the 52 constituencies. Parti Negara entered 30 candidates. 29 Malays and one Chinese. Four other political parties entered a total of 29 candidates. Eighteen others stood as Independents. Two weeks before Nomination Day, Onn announced that he would stand in Johor Bahru, and challenged Tunku to stand against him. It was a tactical error. The Alliance let it be known that the Party would decide where Tunku should stand, and it allowed the headquarters to select a candidate who could be expected to defeat Onn.

Tunku&#x27;s resisted invitations to forecast the election results, but he let it be known that he was confident of an Alliance victory. It was only during the last week of the elections that Tunku toured his constituency. Everywhere he went, he was promised total support. He spent the day before the elections in the UMNO House in Alor Setar and telephoned the Alliance headquarters in every state.

On polling day, after casting his vote, he drove himself on a whirlwind tour to constituencies in Kedah and then set off to Kuala Lumpur accompanied by T.H Tan. Tunku stopped at every main polling station en route and only arrived in Kuala Lumpur at 11 pm, making it possible for him to enter the town unrecognised. Tunku always enjoyed the company of his friends but on the night of 27 July, he was exhausted and wanted to be alone. Tunku spent the night at the Eastern Hotel, listening to the results of the elections until the Kuala Lumpur Radio Station went off the air at 3 AM.

Tunku won with a majority of more than 20,000 votes, Sulaiman won with 5,943 votes and Dato&#x27; Onn only managed to secure 2,802 votes. The Alliance won 51 seats, the Pan Malayan Islamic Party (PMIP) won only one seat, and the National Party (PN) won none.

===Early days as Chief Minister===

High Commissioner MacGillivray invited Tunku to the King&#x27;s House for a first formal discussion on Sunday, 31 July. Tunku handed the High Commissioner a list of 11 Cabinet Ministers: six Malays, three Chinese, and two Indians. The list would still have to be passed to the Rulers for their formal concurrence that would take some time. On 1 August, Tunku was received by a British Assistant Secretary to the Government at the Federal Secretariat building.

On 9 August, Tunku made his first broadcast to the nation from an old wooden structure at Young Road, Kuala Lumpur. During the broadcast, he said:

There had been another General Election in the United Kingdom, won again by the Conservatives. Alan Lennox-Boyd was the new Secretary of States for the Colonies. He was to visit Malaya and be present at the new Legislative Council meeting on 1 September. At their first informal meeting at King&#x27;s House in Kuala Lumpur, Tunku found in the new Secretary of State an unexpected affinity. They were able to speak freely and they shared a sense of humour. Lennox-Boyd agreed to hold constitutional talks in London in January 1956, provided that the Rulers were represented. When the Rulers met at their conferences in Kuala Lumpur in September 1955, Tunku sought and was granted a special audience. Tunku asked the Rulers to appoint representatives for the constitutional talks to be held in London. As the days for the talks got closer, travel plans were discussed.

===Baling Talks===

In dealing with the Emergency, Tunku had offered amnesty to the communist revolutionaries soon after he became Chief Minister. 186 &quot;Safe Areas&quot; were named in four million leaflets, which were dropped over the jungle from Air Force planes. The results had been disappointing but an unsigned letter from Communist headquarters in South Thailand asked for a ceasefire. Tunku showed the letter to MacGillivray and General Bourne. Then, with their agreement, Tunku issued a reply in the Press stating that he was willing to meet Chin Peng.

After a further exchange of letters, Tunku and Chin Peng met in Southeast Kedah near the Siamese border in December 1955. Tunku had 2 objectives for the meeting, one was to clarify the amnesty terms, the other was to make it clear that Tunku spoke for the people of Malaya and not as a representative of the British. Chin Peng could not accept the amnesty terms because the British did not allow communists in the jungle to enjoy equal status with other Malayans. Chin Peng demanded that the Malayan Communist Party (MCP) be legalised and be allowed to participate in the elections.

Singaporean Chief Minister David Marshall asked if the MCP would lay down their arms if Malaya was granted Independence, Chin Peng refused as the amnesty offer was unacceptable to the MCP, and that they would never disband the MCP. Discussions continued after dark without either side making any concessions. The talks failed to reach an agreement and ended at 10 AM the next morning.

Following the failure of the talks, Tunku decided to withdraw the offer of an amnesty on 8 February 1956, five months after it had been offered. He stated that he would not willingly meet the communists again unless they indicated beforehand their desire to see him make &quot;a complete surrender&quot;. He said that the Communists had made it clear to him that their ideology and that of himself and his party could not exist side by side. Therefore, the war must be intensified until one or the other gave in. &quot;I have every confidence that the people of Malaya will give their fullest support and co-operation to the action I have taken.&quot;

==Road to Independence==

After Tunku and Lennox-Boyd agreed to hold constitutional talks in London in January 1956, provided that the Rulers were represented. When the Rulers met at their conferences in Kuala Lumpur in September 1955, Tunku sought and was granted a special audience. Tunku asked the Rulers to appoint representatives for the constitutional talks to be held in London.

Finally on 1 January 1956, the two delegations sailed together from Singapore to Karachi on the &quot;Asia&quot;, Before they arrived at Karachi, their draft proposals had been finalised, and they entered Lancaster House in London on 16 January, as the Merdeka Mission, with a single leader, Tunku.

Finally on 8 February 1956, Tunku&#x27;s fifty-third birthday, he and Lennox-Boyd signed the Independence agreement, the Treaty of London, scheduled for August 1957. Tunku and his mission left London on 16 February, had a short break in Cairo and landed in Singapore four days later.

The next day, Tunku went to Malacca where he had decided to make his first public announcement on their success. His speech was simple and brief, muffled by the constant chorus of &quot;Merdeka&quot;. Soon after Tunku&#x27;s return from London, a Constitutional Commission as set up in Kuala Lumpur. The Commission travelled to every State, hearing evidence and receiving memoranda. The Alliance National Council spent months preparing a detailed memorandum from the commission, most of which were accepted.

The Commissioner&#x27;s report was published in Kuala Lumpur in February 1957. MacGillivray then set up a Working Committee to prepare final recommendations for the consideration of the British Government. When the subject of &#x27;jus soli&#x27; (citizenship by right of birth) was mentioned, Tunku, as the inspired diplomat, managed to persuade the MCA leaders to agree to its omission from the official recommendations.

==Premiership==

Tunku Abdul Rahman dominated the politics of the independent Malaya (which became Malaysia in 1963), and led the Alliance to landslide wins in the 1959, and 1964 general elections. He not only served as the first prime minister of Malaya but also as its foreign minister.

The formation of Malaysia was one of his greatest achievements. In 1961, he made a speech at the Foreign Correspondents Association of Southeast Asia in Singapore, proposing a federation of Malaya, Singapore, Sabah, Sarawak, and Brunei. On 16 September 1963, with the federation of all these states except Brunei, Tunku Abdul Rahman was formally restyled as Prime Minister of Malaysia.

However, the racial factor was worsened with the inclusion of Singapore, which increased the Chinese proportion to more than 40%. Both UMNO and the MCA were nervous about the possible appeal of Lee Kuan Yew&#x27;s People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) to voters in Malaya, and tried to organize a party in Singapore to challenge Lee&#x27;s position there, despite an earlier agreement that he would not do so (see PAP-UMNO relations). Lee in turn retaliated by running PAP candidates in Malaya at the 1964 federal elections, winning one seat.

This provoked Tunku to demand that Singapore be permanently removed from the union of Malaysia. This order led to the development of the Independence of Singapore Agreement 1965 which achieved total independence for Singapore from Malaysia in that one move. The same day, 7 August 1965, Tunku announced to the Parliament of Malaysia in Kuala Lumpur that it should vote yes on the resolution to have Singapore be put out of the Federation and Singapore&#x27;s secession and independence became official on 9 August 1965.

At the 1969 general election, the Alliance&#x27;s majority was greatly reduced. Demonstrations following the elections sparked the 13 May racial riots in Kuala Lumpur. Some UMNO leaders led by Tun Abdul Razak were critical of Tunku&#x27;s leadership during these events, and an emergency committee MAGERAN took power and declared a state of emergency.

His powers as Prime Minister were severely curtailed, and on 22 September 1970 (a day after his agnatic first-degree nephew became King of Malaysia), he was forced to resign as Prime Minister in favor of Abdul Razak. He subsequently resigned from UMNO&#x27;s presidency in June 1971, amid severe opposition of the &#x27;Young Turks&#x27; comprising party rebels such as Mahathir Mohamad and Musa Hitam. The duo later became Prime Minister and Deputy Prime Minister of Malaysia respectively.

==Involvements in Islam==

After making Islam the religion of the Federation in 1960, Tunku established the Islamic Welfare Organisation (PERKIM), an organization to help Muslim converts adjust to new lives as Muslims. He was President of PERKIM until a year before his death. In 1961 Malaysia hosted the first International Qur&#x27;an Recital Competition, an event that developed from Abdul Rahman&#x27;s idea when he organized the first state-level competition in Kedah in 1951.

Malaysia is a founder member of the OIC. Its headquarters are in Jeddah, but it was established at the Conference of Islamic Nations held in Kuala Lumpur in 1969. Tunku was its first secretary-general since 1970.

On the occasion of his 80th birthday, he stated on 9 February 1983 edition of &quot;The Star&quot; newspaper that the &quot;country has a multi-racial population with various beliefs. Malaysia must continue as a secular State with Islam as the official religion&quot;. In the same issue of &quot;The Star&quot;, Tunku was supported by the third Malaysian Prime Minister, Hussein Onn, who stated that the &quot;nation can still be functional as a secular state with Islam as the official religion&quot;.

==Sports involvement==

Tunku became vice president of the Kedah Football Association after his return from Cambridge in the late 1930&#x27;s. In 1949, Tunku became president of the Selangor Football Association, and a few years later he became president of the Football Association of Malaysia, serving in the position for 20 years. During his presidency, he introduced a competition for those under-18 years old such as the &quot;Piala FAM&quot; (FAM Cup) and the &quot;Piala Rahman&quot; (Rahman Cup). Being an avid sportsman, Tunku was a firm believer that sports can be a good catalyst in bringing about greater social unity among Malaysians of various races and religions. Therefore, he supported and initiated many sports events. These included an international football tournament, the Merdeka Tournament, in 1957. In the following year, he was elected as the president of the Asian Football Confederation (AFC), a post he held until 1977.

Tunku also loved horse racing and was a regular at the Selangor Turf Club. He claimed that his lucky number was 13 and that he would win horse races that were held on the 13th of the month, especially on Friday the 13th for him. Tunku&#x27;s racing interests included the champion racehorse Think Big. After it won the 1974 Melbourne Cup, Think Big&#x27;s owners, Malaysian businessman Dato Tan Chin Nam, and Australian property developer Rick O&#x27;Sullivan, invited Tunku to join them as a part-owner of the horse. Think Big then won its second Melbourne Cup in 1975.

In 1977, having acquired substantial shares in &quot;The Star&quot;, a Penang-based newspaper, he became the newspaper&#x27;s chairman. His columns, &quot;Looking Back&quot; and &quot;As I See It&quot;, were critical of the government, and in 1987, Mahathir Mohamad banned the newspaper. This led to a split in UMNO, with Tunku himself and another former Prime Minister, Hussein Onn, setting up a new party called UMNO Malaysia, but its registration was quashed by Mahathir, who set up UMNO Baru in response. Tunku later supported Parti Melayu Semangat 46, a splinter group of UMNO led by Tengku Razaleigh Hamzah. He campaigned actively for the latter in the 1990 Malaysian general election, but was already in very poor health. The well-educated, visionary Tunku stood in contrast to Mahathir&#x27;s brand of ethnic nationalism, which promised to help Malays as part of the &quot;Ketuanan Melayu&quot; ideology.

==Personal life==

It was in Kulim that Tunku married his first wife, Meriam Chong who was the daughter of his friend, Chong Ah Yong, a Thai Chinese. A year after their marriage, Tunku&#x27;s daughter Tunku Khadijah was born. A year later, a son Tunku Ahmad Nerang was born. A month after Meriam gave birth to her second child, she contracted a severe attack of malaria and died.

On Meriam&#x27;s death, Tunku wrote to his lady friend in England, Violet Coulson, who ran a coffee shop that Tunku had frequented as a student. When Tunku&#x27;s letter reached Violet, she dropped everything and turned up in Singapore. They were secretly married by the Kadi in the Malay mosque in Arab Street according to Muslim rites. After conversion, Violet&#x27;s Muslim name was Puteh Bte Abdullah. Violet went to live in Penang because they had no approval of the Ruler or Regent. Tunku Ibrahim, the Regent, was strongly opposed to mixed marriages, but when he died unexpectedly in 1934 and was succeeded as Regent by Tunku Mahmud, the Sultan&#x27;s younger brother, he consented to the marriage. Though their marriage went well, Tunku&#x27;s responsibilities in the public service were all-consuming and after a separation where Violet returned to London, they have divorced amicably in 1947. He then married Sharifah Rodziah Syed Alwi Barakbah, with whom he adopted four children, Sulaiman, Mariam, Sharifah Hanizah (granddaughter), and Faridah. He also secretly married Bibi Chong and was given two children, Tunku Noor Hayati and Tunku Mastura.

Tunku&#x27;s house, located at 1 Jalan Changkat Kia Peng in Kuala Lumpur, was acquired by the Government of the Philippines in 1987 and now serves as the chancery of the Philippine Embassy in Malaysia.

==Death==

He died peacefully on 6 December 1990 at the age of 87. Among those who witnessed his last breath were Prime Minister Mahathir Mohamad with his Deputy Abdul Ghafar Baba also Chief Secretary Ahmad Sarji Abdul Hamid, and a few others. Mahathir later ordered the Chief Secretary to announce the death of Tunku. He was buried at the Langgar Royal Mausoleum in Alor Setar according to his wish signed a day before his death.

<text>Hussein Onn (; 12 February 1922 – 29 May 1990) was a Malaysian lawyer and politician who served as the third Prime Minister of Malaysia in 1976 to 1981

His grandfather, Jaafar Haji Muhammad, was Johor’s first Menteri Besar. His grandmother, Rogayah Hanim, was from the Caucasus region of the Ottoman Empire. 

Hussein was the brother-in-law of Prime Minister Abdul Razak Hussein through his marriage to Suhailah Noah, daughter of Mohamed Noah Omar, in 1948. They had six children, including Hishammuddin Hussein, a senior UMNO politician. Their eldest daughter, Roquaiya Hanim, died in 2006 from breast cancer.

<doc id="364283" wikidata="Q4164446" url="?curid=364283" title="ʻIolani School">
<text>Iolani School is a private coeducational college preparatory school in Honolulu, Hawaiʻi. It serves over 2,200 students with a boarding program for grades 9 - 12 as well as a summer boarding program for middle school grades. Founded in 1863 by Father William R. Scott, it was the principal school of the former Anglican Church of Hawaiʻi. It was patronized by Kamehameha IV and Queen Emma who gave the school its name in 1870. &quot;ʻIolani&quot; in the Hawaiian language means &quot;heavenly hawk&quot;. Today, ʻIolani School is affiliated with the Episcopal Church in the United States. It is administered by a Board of Governors and is one of the largest independent schools in the United States.

==History==
===Early years===
On October 11, 1862, Thomas Nettleship Staley arrived in Hawaiʻi by request of Kamehameha IV and Queen Victoria of the United Kingdom. The following year Kamehameha IV, a member of the Church of England, established the Hawaiian Reformed Catholic Church, also known as the Anglican Church of Hawaiʻi. The school was originally named for Saint Alban.

In 1863, Staley&#x27;s companion Father Scott purchased land in Lāhaina and established Luaʻehu School, a school for boys. When Father Scott fell ill and returned to Britain, Father George Mason was summoned by Staley to administer the school on Maui. On January 12, 1863, the St. Alban&#x27;s College was also established in the Pauoa Valley in Honolulu. Mason also seemed to have managed this school as well. Before Staley, too, left the islands for Britain in 1870, Father Mason merged the two schools and relocated it to the St. Alban&#x27;s campus. Later Bishop Alfred Willis purchased land on Bates Street in Nuʻuanu Valley and moved part of the school there, intending it for students of full or part Hawaiian descent, under the new name of ʻIolani College. The St. Alban&#x27;s College, intended for white students, separated and continuing operating at Pauoa until 1887.

With the overthrow of the Kingdom of Hawaiʻi and annexation to the United States in 1898, the Anglican Church of Hawaiʻi became part of the Episcopal Church United States (ECUSA). ʻIolani School was moved to Nuʻuanu, transferred back to downtown Honolulu and then moved to Nuʻuanu a second time. It remained in Nuʻuanu from 1927 to 1953, when it was moved to the present Ala Wai site. The elementary school was moved to the Ala Wai site in 1946.

In 1979, the school became co-educational, ending its all-male enrollment policy.

===Development===
ʻIolani School grew and refined its program offerings with a standard college preparatory curriculum as a foundation for every student. Religion, performing and visual arts, music, and athletics became integral parts of the ʻIolani School education. As such, all students in fourth grade must be involved in performing arts.

Returning to its history of being a boarding school, ʻIolani opened its newly constructed residential dormitories for boarding students in February of 2019.

==Campus==

The campus is divided into Upper and Lower School. Buildings include Castle Building, Weinberg Building, the I-Wing, the art building, the Nangaku Building, the Sullivan Center for Innovation and Learning, Boarding Dormitories, the Kaneshiro Science and Innovation Center, and the Sidney and Minnie Kosasa Performance Studios and Courtyard. Other facilities include the Upper Gym and the Lower Gym, the Tsuzuki Library, the Dillingham Pool, the FabLab, and St. Alban&#x27;s Chapel. ʻIolani School also has a stadium (Kozuki Stadium), a baseball field, an outdoor basketball court (the One Team Field house), and several tennis courts.

===Upper School===
The Harold K.L. Castle Building was dedicated in 1980 to the Castle Family which had donated land to &#x27;Iolani School. The Castle Building also contains most classrooms for the 7th and 8th Grade. Orchestra and Choir also use this building for their Performing Arts classes for both Upper and Lower School students.

The Sullivan Center for Innovation and Leadership was finished at the end of 2012 for the replacement of the Upper School Library. The Sullivan Center was created to emphasize sustainability and includes classrooms, laboratories, an auditorium, and a garden among other facilities.

In late 2023, plans for a new Student Center were revealed, following a $10 million donation from parents Justine Stamen Arrillaga and John Arrillaga Jr. (son of John Arrillaga). The project is scheduled to be completed in 2025.

===Lower School===
The Kaneshiro Science and Innovation Center and the Sidney and Minnie Kosasa Performance Studios and Courtyard were both opened for the 2019 school year. These state-of-the-art and eco-conscious facilities allow the K-1 community at ʻIolani School to embrace their creativity with the aid of a number of decorations created in the school&#x27;s Sullivan Center for Innovation and Leadership. An interactive organ was installed as well.

==Athletics==
ʻIolani School&#x27;s athletic program was founded in 1932 by Father Kenneth A. Bray. Over 900, or 70%, of the student body, participates in one of over 32 competitive sports. ʻIolani School is a member of the Interscholastic League of Honolulu, an athletic conference composed of Honolulu-area private schools.

Since the formation of the Hawaii High School Athletic Association, ʻIolani has won over 75 state championships in various sports. It is the only school in Hawaiʻi to have won five consecutive state championships in Boys Basketball from 2002 to 2006. ʻIolani has the most consecutive state championships in Boys Wrestling, and is the first ILH school to win a Girls Wrestling State Championship in 2005. They also have eight consecutive D-II football titles, highest in the nation.

==Curriculum==

ʻIolani School&#x27;s campus is divided into two sections: Lower School and Upper School. Lower School is for elementary students, kindergarten through 6th grade. Upper School is 7th through 12th grade. The daily schedule has six periods that rotate weekly.

===Summer school===
ʻIolani’s summer school allows students to earn graduation credits; credit courses offered during summer include art, history, science, computers, and language.

===Harold Keables===

Harold Keables was first a teacher in Denver, where he was named the National Teacher of the Year by &quot;Life&quot; magazine; in 1965 he started teaching at ʻIolani School. Each year his legacy is honored via the Keables Chair, which brings &quot;outstanding teachers, writers, and artists to ʻIolani.&quot;

===Iolani Fair===
The ʻIolani Fair has been held every year in late April to fundraise for student expenditures. Initially started as the &quot;Fun Festival&quot; in 1948, it would later become the &quot;Carnival&quot;, and eventually in 1990, the &quot;Fair&quot;. Themes for each year were introduced shortly thereafter. The fair typically consists of different sections including food stands, games, rides, a silent auction, a video game center, a white elephant sale, and a marketplace. While the fair was canceled in 2020 and 2021, it is set to return in 2022.

==Extracurriculars==
ʻIolani students are involved in many extracurricular activities from academic to interest-led.

===Imua Iolani===
&quot;Imua ʻIolani&quot; is the school newsmagazine. It is published quarterly, distributed to all students, and is available online. In 2008, &quot;Imua ʻIolani&quot; was named the best school newspaper in the state.

===Math Team===

The team has won the league championship in 1977, 1981, 1984, 1990, 1991, and from 1993 to the present, they currently hold a 30 year winstreak. This marks 34 total championships, including the past 29. This streak is tied with the Punahou boys swimming team for the longest state championship streak of any competition in Hawaii. The JV team has claimed the top spot ever since the inception of the JV division in the 2000–01 school year. Also, &#x27;Iolani holds the record for placing first 18 times in the Hawaii State Math Bowl (which was started in 1978).
