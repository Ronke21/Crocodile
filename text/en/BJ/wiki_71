<text>The Dublin Area Rapid Transit system (stylised as DART) is an electrified commuter rail railway network serving the coastline and city of Dublin, Ireland. The service makes up the core of Dublin&#x27;s suburban railway network, stretching from Greystones, County Wicklow, in the south to Howth and Malahide in north County Dublin. The DART serves 31 stations and consists of 53 route kilometres of electrified railway ( double track, single), and carries in the region of 20 million passengers per year. In a similar manner to the Berlin S-Bahn, the DART blends elements of a commuter rail service and a rapid transit system.

The DART system was established by Córas Iompair Éireann in 1984 to replace an ageing fleet of diesel-powered locomotives. It was, and still is, the only electric mainline railway in Ireland, and one of two currently operating electric railways, the other being the Luas tram which opened in 2004. Since 1987, the service is operated by Iarnród Éireann, Ireland&#x27;s national rail operator. Contemporary rolling stock on the DART network is powered by overhead lines and uses the .

The network is being significantly expanded in the 2020s as part of the DART+ project, with future services to run to Drogheda, County Louth, Celbridge and Maynooth in County Kildare and Dunboyne, County Meath.

==History==

===Initial development===
The section of trackbed between Dún Laoghaire and Dublin City was originally laid out as part of the Dublin and Kingstown Railway, Ireland&#x27;s first railway. This line was later connected with the Belfast mainline to the north and Wexford mainline to the south and joined the Harcourt Street line at Shanganagh Junction. The scenic views from the railway over Dublin Bay at this point have been compared to those on the Gulf of Naples and have resulted in trips to Killiney Hill and Greystones along the line becoming tourist attractions.

Prior to electrification in 1984, the line was operated using 1950s-era CIÉ 2600 Class rail cars which had been converted in the early 1970s to push-pull operation. These diesel-powered trains were powered by a CIE 201 Class locomotive, with a driving trailer carriage on the other end. This service was notoriously uncomfortable, unreliable, and overcrowded. By the late 1970s, the need for an urgent upgrade to the system had become apparent, as the 2600 Class railcars were in poor condition. Replacement parts had become difficult to obtain due to the age of the rolling stock and its conversion to push-pull operation, which had been intended as a temporary measure until a more permanent solution could be established, had come to the end of its serviceable life.

After studies in the early 1970s, the Dublin Rapid Rail Transit Study, published in 1975, recommended the construction of a rapid transit system with 2 lines: the first one between and &#x27;Ronanstown Centre&#x27;, a station to be located roughly where is today, and navigating the city centre via a cross-city tunnel; and the second line between and &#x27;Blanchardstown Centre&#x27;. The two lines would intersect at an interchange known as &#x27;Dublin Central&#x27;. Additionally, branches were to be constructed to serve the suburbs of Ballymun and Tallaght.

The first phase of the project (Howth–Bray) would receive CIÉ approval in 1977, and government approval on 31 May 1979 amidst the 1979 European elections. Linke-Hofmann-Busch would win the contract and supply 40 EMUs, beginning trials in March 1983. Public services began on 23 July 1984 and be inaugurated by Taoiseach Garret FitzGerald on 22 October of that year. The rest of the study would not be implemented reportedly due to a lack of funds.

In conjunction with electrification, three disused stations at Sandymount, Booterstown and Salthill and Monkstown were reopened for the DART in 1984. Sandymount and Booterstown were each built at the sites of a previous station while Salthill and Monkstown was built near the site of the original Kingstown railway terminus, between Seapoint and Dún Laoghaire. As electrification work was undertaken from 1981–1982, a spur which had served the ferry port at Dún Laoghaire was disconnected from the mainline as the installation of overhead power lines to service the harbour would have necessitated the lowering of the track which travelled through a portal south of Dún Laoghaire station.

Early DART services ran from the north-eastern suburb of Howth, through Connolly, Tara Street, and Pearse stations in the city centre and on to Bray, which lies on the border between Dublin and Wicklow. This route remained unchanged for almost sixteen years until the line between Bray and Greystones was electrified. Further electrification of the line took place between Howth Junction &amp; Donaghmede and Malahide, the northernmost DART station, on the Belfast mainline. The service to and began in October 2000.

==Operation==
The DART service is operated by a mixed fleet of electric multiple unit trains. As of 2019, the trains run every ten minutes on weekdays with a reduced service on weekends. Trains north of Howth Junction are split between Howth and Malahide while the Malahide service is supplemented by Northern Commuter trains.

Trains are typically run as four-car, six-car or eight-car sets during the 07.00–09.30 and 17.00–19.00 weekday peak periods. Capacity is reduced during off-peak periods and at weekends, with up to four eight-car sets running. Four-car sets typically consist of a single 8500 Class unit while six-car sets are made up of three 8100 Class units. Eight-car sets can be made up of either two 8500 Class or four 8100 Class units. Both classes had worked in tandem prior to the refurbishment of the ageing 8100 Class in 2007, after which both have been run separately.

Forty two-car 8100 Class units were purchased to run the initial network. Two of these were damaged beyond repair in a depot fire in 2001. Expanding passenger numbers and the need to refurbish the ageing 8100 Class units saw the purchase of four 8500 Class train sets in 2000. These were complemented with three 8510 Class sets in 2001 and ten 8520 Class sets in 2003 and 2004. The now-withdrawn 8200 Class sets which were first run in 2000 operated until 2008 at which point they were retired from revenue service and decommissioned due to longstanding technical issues. A redevelopment of the network&#x27;s stations was undertaken between 2003 and 2005 to lengthen platforms to accommodate eight-car sets, upgrade the power grid, and improve accessibility for disabled passengers.

===Service===
All trains in the Dublin suburban area, including DART services, are monitored and regulated by a Central Traffic Control (CTC) facility located in Connolly Station, known as Suburban CTC. This facility has been extensively automated and requires a staff of five; two signallers, one with responsibility for level crossings, an electrical control officer, who supervises the electrical power supply equipment and an overall supervisor. The main CTC is staffed at all times however, there are also backup local control rooms which allow services to continue in the event of serious technical problems.

A single driver is responsible for the management of each train from the cab in the leading carriage. Automatic doors are controlled by the driver and are armed upon arrival at stations. Real-time passenger information displays on station platforms offer passengers updates on the next train arrival times, service updates and outages. Automatic PA announcements are made in case of service disruptions and are tailored to each station.

The majority of stations on the network have been renovated to include automatic barriers which require passengers to submit their tickets for verification before they can set foot on the platform. A ticket is required in advance of boarding DART services and can be purchased at stations from staffed kiosks and automated machines. Passengers can also avail of the option of using a Leap Card, Dublin&#x27;s integrated ticketing scheme. Leap cards are offered as contactless cards onto which passengers can load set ticket options or a cash balance. Leap fares are typically cheaper than paying in cash for a journey. On the DART network, users tag on at their point of entry and tag off at their exit point. Irish Rail, along with Dublin&#x27;s other public transport operators operated its own smart card system which was phased out to coincide with the Leap Card&#x27;s introduction. Revenue protection officers check passengers&#x27; tickets to ensure validity both onboard trains and on station platforms at random intervals.

== Future ==

===DART+===

In February 2018, the Irish government and National Transport Authority announced a 10-year plan to electrify the lines to Drogheda, Maynooth, Hazelhatch, M3 Parkway and Docklands. The proposed project, which had previously been referred to as &quot;DART Expansion&quot;, was renamed &quot;DART+&quot; in 2020. The project was split into five sub-projects: 

* DART+ Coastal North: Drogheda to Connolly Station.
* DART+ Coastal South: Greystones to Connolly Station.
* DART+ West: Maynooth and the M3 Parkway (merging together at Clonsilla Station) to Connolly Station and Spencer Dock Station.
* DART+ South West: Hazelhatch &amp; Celbridge to Heuston Station and a proposed station at Glasnevin.
* DART+ Fleet : The purchasing of a new fleet to serve these routes.

In 2019, a tender for up to 600 bi-mode battery-electric units was issued to provide fleet capacity for the proposed expansion, and a tender was also issued for initial design work on the additional electrification requirements.

==== Extension to Maynooth (DART+ West) ====
The initial phase of the DART+ plan, DART+ West, proposes to provide of electrification to Maynooth and M3 Parkway, a new terminus at Spencer Dock to replace Docklands station, a new maintenance depot at Maynooth and additional works in relation to signalling and level crossing closures. The project was at the design stage as of April 2019, and the planning stage in December 2021. Public consultation closed in October 2022.

An Bord Pleanála was initially due to issue a decision by March 2023 with Iarnród Éireann hoping to begin construction in early 2024, but later postponed the deadline to December 2023. Permission for DART+ West was granted in July 2024, though permission for the Maynooth depot was refused due to flood risks. As of July 2024, Iarnród Éireann stated that it aimed for services on the lines to &quot;start by 2029&quot;. The company stated a revised proposal for a new depot would be submitted separately and would &quot;not cause delays to the completion date&quot;.

==== Extension to Hazelhatch and Celbridge (DART+ South West) ====
The second phase, DART+ South West, was approved by the government in March 2023. A railway order application was submitted by Iarnród Éireann the same month. The proposal included the electrification of 20 kilometres of track from Connolly to Hazelhatch and Celbridge via the Phoenix Park Tunnel, a new Heuston West station in place of platform 10 at Heuston and an expansion of track capacity along the Dublin–Cork line between Heuston and Park West and Cherry Orchard. If built as planned, the upgraded line would connect at Connolly to the existing DART lines on the east coast to allow for through services. The application was approved by An Bord Pleanála in November 2024.

==== Extension to Drogheda (DART+ Coastal North) ====
The DART+ project proposes an extension to Drogheda through the introduction of new bi-mode rolling stock. The trains would be powered by batteries on the currently unelectrified tracks between Drogheda MacBride station and the current terminus at Malahide, and use the existing overhead wires on the remainder of the route. Iarnród Éireann stated, in 2024, that the trains would enter service on the route in early 2026. Charging facilities are currently under construction at Drogheda MacBride station.

Further infrastructure works to increase capacity on the route are planned as part of the DART+ Coastal North project, which is currently in its planning stage. It proposes the extension of overhead wires on the Belfast–Dublin line by 37 kilometres to Drogheda, a new platform at MacBride station, several modifications to bridges and track configurations as well as upgrades to signalling and power infrastructure. DART+ Coastal North was approved by the government in May 2024 and the railway order application was submitted by Iarnród Éireann in July 2024.

=== Proposed stations ===
In March 2017, the government announced plans for a proposed new DART station, Woodbrook, to be built between Shankill and Bray on the southern section of the DART line. In 2020, Iarnród Éireann submitted a planning application for the station, and planning permission was granted in July 2021. Work on the station commenced by late 2023.

A further station was proposed near the site of the former Glasnevin station as part of the MetroLink project. If built as planned, it would see platforms for mainline trains constructed along the overground Western and Southern Commuter lines, which could become part of the DART network if the DART+ West and South West projects are completed as proposed.

===Former/suspended proposals===
Several proposals have been made to expand the DART network beyond the coastal mainline and provide service to the north and west of the city. These expansion plans included a proposed tunnel linking the Docklands Station at Spencer Dock in the city&#x27;s quays and Heuston Station. This proposed DART Underground project, first posited in 1972, included plans for services from Celbridge/Hazelhatch to the Docklands via St. Stephen&#x27;s Green. The DART Underground project was put on hold in September 2015. While included in the Greater Dublin Transport Strategy 2016-2035 (published in 2016), the DART Underground proposal was not included in the Greater Dublin Area Strategy 2022-2042 (published in 2021).

Plans were unveiled under Transport 21 to expand the DART to consist of two lines. DART Line 1 would go from Maynooth to Greystones, with a branch to M3 Parkway. DART Line 2 would utilise the Interconnector to make a line between Balbriggan and Hazelhatch and retain the Howth branch line. The project was due to be completed in 2009. In April 2009, the government announced plans to extend DART Line 1 from Balbriggan to Drogheda.

===Future fleet changes===
====Dart+ Fleet====

In 2017, IÉ announced plans to procure a new fleet of trains with the intention of extending DART services from 2023 onwards. An initial purchase of 100 vehicles was proposed to allow replacement of the existing fleet; this proposed purchase would include bi-mode units to allow services to run beyond the existing electrified network.

In December 2021, IÉ announced that Alstom had been selected as the provider of up to 750 new vehicles, with 325 planned as part of the DART+ plan. The 90000 Class are part of Alstom&#x27;s X&#x27;Trapolis family. An initial order of 95 vehicles was made, formed into 19 5-car units. A total of 13 of these are due to be fitted both with pantographs to operate using the OHLE on the main DART network, and batteries to allow operation on non-electrified routes. The battery operation is planned to allow the extension of DART services as far as . The remaining units in the initial batch are expected to also be 5-car, fitted with pantograph only.

In 2023, Alstom revealed prototypes of the new DART trains. The prototype plans include 4 bike spaces per car, dedicated wheelchair areas, and automatic ramps for passenger accessibility. In April 2023, TD Fergus O&#x27;Dowd suggested that the first set of trains were due to be delivered by 2025, enabling expansion of DART services to Drogheda along the DART+ Coastal North route. The first train was delivered in November 2024.

==Competitors==
Iarnród Éireann, the operator of DART services, operates a rail monopoly. They also operate faster Commuter and InterCity services, which also serve Greystones, Bray, Dún Laoghaire, Blackrock, Sydney Parade, Lansdowne Road, Grand Canal Dock, Dublin Pearse, Tara Street, Dublin Connolly, Howth Junction &amp; Donaghmede, Clongriffin, Portmarnock and Malahide. The only other company to operate on lines in the Republic of Ireland is Northern Ireland Railways, which jointly operates the cross-border Enterprise service between Dublin and Belfast.

A number of other public transport modes are available in Dublin. The CIÉ-owned Dublin Bus and the private Go-Ahead Ireland (owned by Go-Ahead Group) operate throughout the city and have many routes that run parallel to DART for stretches. However, they do not have any scheduled routes that traverse the entire length of the DART line. As in the rest of Ireland, integration of bus and rail services is limited, though there are some &quot;feeder bus&quot; routes for which it is possible to buy a through ticket valid for both the rail and bus section of the journey. Travel passes and integrated ticketing (Leap Cards) for DART, Luas and Dublin Bus services were introduced in 2011.

<text>Killed in action (KIA) is a casualty classification generally used by militaries to describe the deaths of their personnel at the hands of enemy or hostile forces at the moment of action. The United States Department of Defense, for example, says that those declared KIA did not need to have fired their weapons, but only to have been killed due to hostile attack. KIAs include those killed by friendly fire in the midst of combat, but not from incidents such as accidental vehicle crashes, murder or other non-hostile events or terrorism. KIA can be applied both to front-line combat troops and to naval, air and support troops.

Furthermore, the term died of wounds (DOW) is used to denote personnel who reached a medical treatment facility before dying. The category &quot;died of wounds received in action&quot; (&quot;DWRIA&quot;) is also used for combat related casualties which occur after medical evacuation.

PKIA means presumed killed in action. This term is used when personnel are lost in battle, initially listed missing in action (MIA), but after not being found, are later presumed to have not survived. This is typical of naval battles or engagements on other hostile environments where recovering bodies is difficult. A very large number of soldiers killed in action went unidentified in World War I, like John Kipling, the son of British poet Rudyard Kipling, prompting the formation of the Commonwealth War Graves Commission.

== NATO definition ==
NATO defines killed in action or a battle casualty as a combatant who is killed outright or who dies as a result of wounds or other injuries before reaching a medical treatment facility or help from fellow comrades.

<text>In measure-theoretic analysis and related branches of mathematics, Lebesgue–Stieltjes integration generalizes both Riemann–Stieltjes and Lebesgue integration, preserving the many advantages of the former in a more general measure-theoretic framework. The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral is the ordinary Lebesgue integral with respect to a measure known as the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure, which may be associated to any function of bounded variation on the real line. The Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure is a regular Borel measure, and conversely every regular Borel measure on the real line is of this kind.

Lebesgue–Stieltjes integrals, named for Henri Leon Lebesgue and Thomas Joannes Stieltjes, are also known as Lebesgue–Radon integrals or just Radon integrals, after Johann Radon, to whom much of the theory is due. They find common application in probability and stochastic processes, and in certain branches of analysis including potential theory.

==Definition==
The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral

:formula_1

is defined when  formula_2  is Borel-measurable
and bounded and  formula_3  is of bounded variation in and right-continuous, or when is non-negative and is monotone and right-continuous. To start, assume that is non-negative and is monotone non-decreasing and right-continuous. Define and (Alternatively, the construction works for left-continuous, and ).

By Carathéodory&#x27;s extension theorem, there is a unique Borel measure on which agrees with on every interval . The measure arises from an outer measure (in fact, a metric outer measure) given by

:formula_4

the infimum taken over all coverings of by countably many semiopen intervals. This measure is sometimes called the Lebesgue–Stieltjes measure associated with .

The Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral

:formula_1

is defined as the Lebesgue integral of with respect to the measure in the usual way. If is non-increasing, then define

:formula_6

the latter integral being defined by the preceding construction.

If is of bounded variation, then it is possible to write

:formula_7

where is the total variation
of in the interval , and . Both and are monotone non-decreasing.

Now, if is bounded, the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral of f with respect to is defined by

:formula_8

where the latter two integrals are well-defined by the preceding construction.

===Daniell integral===
An alternative approach is to define the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral as the Daniell integral that extends the usual Riemann–Stieltjes integral. Let be a non-decreasing right-continuous function on , and define to be the Riemann–Stieltjes integral

:formula_9

for all continuous functions . The functional defines a Radon measure on . This functional can then be extended to the class of all non-negative functions by setting

:formula_10

For Borel measurable functions, one has

:formula_11

and either side of the identity then defines the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral of . The outer measure is defined via

:formula_12

where is the indicator function of .

Integrators of bounded variation are handled as above by decomposing into positive and negative variations.

==Example==
Suppose that is a rectifiable curve in the plane and is Borel measurable. Then we may define the length of with respect to the Euclidean metric weighted by ρ to be

:formula_13

where formula_14 is the length of the restriction of to . This is sometimes called the -length of . This notion is quite useful for various applications: for example, in muddy terrain the speed in which a person can move may depend on how deep the mud is. If denotes the inverse of the walking speed at or near , then the -length of is the time it would take to traverse . The concept of extremal length uses this notion of the -length of curves and is useful in the study of conformal mappings.

==Integration by parts==
A function is said to be &quot;regular&quot; at a point if the right and left hand limits and exist, and the function takes at the average value

:formula_15

Given two functions and of finite variation, if at each point either at least one of or is continuous or and are both regular, then an integration by parts formula for the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral holds:

:formula_16

Here the relevant Lebesgue–Stieltjes measures are associated with the right-continuous versions of the functions and ; that is, to formula_17 and similarly formula_18 The bounded interval may be replaced with an unbounded interval , or provided that and are of finite variation on this unbounded interval. Complex-valued functions may be used as well.

An alternative result, of significant importance in the theory of stochastic calculus is the following. Given two functions and of finite variation, which are both right-continuous and have left-limits (they are càdlàg functions) then

:formula_19

where . This result can be seen as a precursor to Itô&#x27;s lemma, and is of use in the general theory of stochastic integration. The final term is which arises from the quadratic covariation of and . (The earlier result can then be seen as a result pertaining to the Stratonovich integral.)

==Related concepts==

===Lebesgue integration===
When for all real , then is the Lebesgue measure, and the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral of with respect to is equivalent to the Lebesgue integral of .

===Riemann–Stieltjes integration and probability theory===
Where is a continuous real-valued function of a real variable and is a non-decreasing real function, the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral is equivalent to the Riemann–Stieltjes integral, in which case we often write
:formula_20
for the Lebesgue–Stieltjes integral, letting the measure remain implicit. This is particularly common in probability theory when is the cumulative distribution function of a real-valued random variable , in which case 
:formula_21
(See the article on Riemann–Stieltjes integration for more detail on dealing with such cases.)

<text>Parkville is an inner-city suburb in Melbourne, Victoria, Australia, north of Melbourne&#x27;s Central Business District, located within the Cities of Melbourne and Merri-bek local government areas. Parkville recorded a population of 7,074 at the 2021 census.

Parkville is bordered by North Melbourne to the south-west, Carlton and Carlton North to the south and east, Brunswick to the north (where a part of Parkville lies within the City of Merri-bek), and Flemington to the west. The suburb includes the postcodes 3052 and 3010 (University).

The suburb encompasses Royal Park, an expansive parkland which is notable as home to the Royal Melbourne Zoological Gardens. Parkville was also the location of the athlete&#x27;s village for the 2006 Commonwealth Games.

Parkville is a major education, research and healthcare precinct and home to the University of Melbourne, Monash University Pharmacy faculty, Royal Melbourne Hospital, Royal Women&#x27;s Hospital, Royal Children&#x27;s Hospital, the Victorian Comprehensive Cancer Centre and CSL.

The residential areas have a high median house price due to the proximity to the city centre and parkland, Victorian era buildings, terrace houses and tree-lined streets.

==History==
===Toponymy===

Originally known as Park ville or Park-ville, the origins of the name are uncertain. The suburb may have been named after Royal Park. &quot;Park-ville&quot; was the name of one of the early homes along Flemington Road owned by the Ryan family in the 1870s, and there was once a street in Hotham named Parkville Street, which may have led toward this home. Before the 1870s, much of the area was known as either Hotham (North Melbourne) or Carlton, and during this time Parkville was simply a locality of Carlton. The name Park Ville came into common use after 1875, and was gradually shortened to its current form.

===University and beginnings===
The first institution of significance erected in the Parkville area was the University of Melbourne in 1853. A housing estate commenced sales in 1861 at what is now Parkville South. In 1868, further excisions from Royal Park were made for housing estates at Parkville North, along Royal Parade, and Parkville West, near Flemington Road. By the 1870s Parkville was a popular area for the middle class, and many large terrace houses were built in the area.

===Between the wars===

During World War One and Two, Royal Park was the site of military encampments. Camp Pell in Royal Park was the temporary military camp for United States forces during the Second World War.

In 1944, Melbourne Hospital was moved to Parkville.

In 1960 Parkville became home to the Victorian College of Pharmacy, on Royal Parade, which is now a campus of Monash University.

The Athlete&#x27;s Village for the 2006 Commonwealth Games was built on the grounds of the former Royal Park Psychiatric Hospital located in Parkville. The Athlete&#x27;s Village has since been converted into a residential area known as Parkville Gardens.

<doc id="368530" wikidata="Q653277" url="?curid=368530" title="Partnership for Peace">
<text>The Partnership for Peace (PfP; ) is a North Atlantic Treaty Organization (NATO) program aimed at creating trust and cooperation between the member states of NATO and other states mostly in Europe, including post-Soviet states; 18 states are members. The program contains 6 areas of cooperation, which aims to build relationships with partners through military-to-military cooperation on training, exercises, disaster planning and response, science and environmental issues, professionalization, policy planning, and relations with civilian government. During policy negotiations in the 1990s, a primary controversy regarding PfP was its ability to be interpreted as a program that is a stepping stone for joining NATO with full Article 5 guarantees.

Amidst the security concerns in Eastern Europe after the Cold War and dissolution of the Soviet Union, and also due to the failure of the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC), the program was launched during the summit in Brussels, Belgium between January 10 and 11, 1994. In the process, neutral countries also faced a situation in which they had to reconsider maintaining military neutrality; therefore, countries such as Austria, Finland and Sweden joined the Partnership for Peace field activities in 1997.

In 2002, it began the Individual Partnership Action Plan to provide members an opportunity to be granted further assistance from NATO without having to commit to becoming full members of NATO. The program has additionally started an initiative for education, specifically military education. Over the course of its creation, the program has struggled with funding due to its ever-changing formation of members.

==Background==
Amidst the security concerns of the post–Cold War era, the North Atlantic Cooperation Council (NACC) was established in 1991 to pay attention to security issues in Eastern Europe. The NACC was first announced at the Rome summit in November 1991 as NATO&#x27;s first attempt to incorporate the former Soviet Union and its Warsaw Pact allies into European security frameworks. This was intended to form diplomatic links between NATO and Eastern European military officials on industrial and military conversations. After 1991, the NACC held annual ministerial meetings and regular consultations between Eastern and Western representatives of NATO&#x27;s political, economic, and military committees. The objective of these meetings was to strengthen the relations between Eastern and Western Europe, thereby contributing to the regional political and military stability. However, the council contained 36 members of considerable geographic, economic, and cultural diversity who were at times in political dispute with each other. Eventually, this caused limited actions on the NACC&#x27;s primary mission. By 1993, a range of Eastern European countries lost confidence in the NACC. The emergence of new states such as Croatia and Ukraine, along with the split of Czechoslovakia, led to Slovakian Foreign Minister, Milan Kňažko, urging the creation of a security framework that would facilitate cooperation on all levels with NATO. The shortcomings of the NACC in their insufficiency when dealing with fast-paced regional events, resulted in heightened pressure by NACC members for a membership into the NATO alliance and also the formation of an alternative program.

The concept of the PfP was first discussed by the Bulgarian society Novae, after being proposed as an American initiative at the meeting of NATO defense ministers in Travemünde, Germany, between October 20 and 21, 1993, and it was formally launched on January 10–11, 1994, at the NATO summit in Brussels, Belgium. According to declassified U.S. State Department records, President Clinton characterized to President Yeltsin the PfP as a &quot;track that will lead to NATO membership&quot; and that &quot;does not draw another line dividing Europe a few hundred miles to the east&quot;. In September 1994 Clinton told Yeltsin that NATO would expand, but there was no timetable. By that time, Yeltsin had claimed a Russian sphere of influence covering the Commonwealth of Independent States. According to Russian Foreign Minister Andrei Kozyrev, in 1993 Yeltsin had been led to believe that Partnership for Peace would be an alternative to NATO membership, not a program for it, although the head of the Foreign Intelligence Service, Yevgeny Primakov, told him this was a way to begin NATO expansion. Yeltsin still authorized Russia to become a member of the PfP on 22 June 1994, but later said he felt betrayed after NATO declared that PfP was a path to membership in December 1994. In early 1995 he changed Russia&#x27;s policy as being opposed to any NATO expansion.

== Purpose ==
Between October 20 and 21, 1993, in Travemünde, Germany, a meeting for NATO defense ministers was held. In the meeting, the US proposed a program called the Partnership for Peace in response to issues in Eastern Europe. This initiative was designed by the US Secretary of Defense Les Aspin who did not want to exclude Russia from international security arrangements. This was mainly an initiative launched to encourage states to build democracy and active participation towards maintaining international security. The program was also put in place in order to strengthen security cooperation with states in Central and Eastern Europe that were not part of the NATO alliance. In the NATO summit held between January 10 and 11, 1994, the PfP was established by NATO under the North Atlantic Council (NAC). It was claimed by Clinton that the partnership would give way for countries in Eastern Europe, including those that were part of the Soviet Union and even Russia itself to work together &quot;for the best possible future for Europe&quot;.

The PfP Framework Document presented six areas of cooperation, including:

* To ensure transparency in national defense proceedings and budgeting procedures;
* To allow defense forces to be controlled through democratic methods;
* Under the jurisdiction of the United Nations or the Conference for Security and Cooperation in Europe (CSCE), states need to retain their ability and preparedness to contribute in constitutional behavior and operations;
* To enhance the ability for states to provide humanitarian missions such as peacekeeping and search and rescue as the main goal through building a cooperative militaristic relationship with NATO and other states involved;
* To build forces that can work with members of the NATO in the long run;
* To consult with and report to NATO if threats made to the security, territory or sovereignty of a participating state are detected.

States were also promised offices at the NATO headquarters and at a Partnership Coordination Cell which was located near the SHAPE (Supreme Headquarters Allied Powers Europe). States participating in the initiative were to receive perks for cooperating, albeit less than states who had already had full membership in the NATO alliance. NATO along with the US government announced that the existing alliance members would only need minimal contributions towards the cost of the initiative while the PfP members would have to fund for most of the cost of the program. The PfP also increased the possibility for participating states who were not part of the NATO alliance to be an official member, but never actually guaranteed a NATO membership. It was claimed that the PfP was used to delay decisions regarding the move towards expanding NATO membership to non-NATO members in Europe. It was also perceived as a devised plot by the West to prepare Eastern European states for the formation of a European Union by turning them into democratic states through military cooperation. By mid-October 1994, 22 states were part of the PfP.

==Membership==

On April 26, 1995, Malta became a member of PfP; it left on October 27, 1996, in order to maintain its neutrality. On March 20, 2008, Malta decided to reactivate its PfP membership; this was accepted by NATO at the summit in Bucharest on April 3, 2008. During the NATO summit in Riga on November 29, 2006, Bosnia and Herzegovina, Montenegro, and Serbia were invited to join PfP, which they did on December 14, 2006.

Belarus and Russia were suspended from the PfP, the former in November 2021.

===Current members===

==== Austria ==== 

Austria&#x27;s participation in PfP was strengthened in 1996. Their views on PfP focused on maintaining the ability and readiness to contribute to operations &quot;under the authority and/or responsibility of the United Nations and/or NATO and/or the OSCE&quot;. An important area of Austrian PfP contribution is private emergency planning. 30% of all PfP activities in this field came from Austria in 1997. In that year, Austria participated in 227 activities, including 14 peacekeeping operations involving 713 people, within the framework of the NATO/PfP program.
===Aspiring members===
====Cyprus====

Cyprus is the only European Union member state that is neither a NATO member state nor a member of the PfP program. The Parliament of Cyprus adopted a resolution in February 2011 in favor of PfP membership, but President Demetris Christofias vetoed the decision, arguing that it would hamper his attempts to negotiate an end to the Cyprus dispute and demilitarize the island. Turkey, a full member of NATO, is likely to veto any attempt by Cyprus to engage with NATO until the dispute is resolved. Nicos Anastasiades, who was elected President in 2013, stated that he intended to apply for membership in the PfP program soon after taking over. His foreign minister Nikos Christodoulides later dismissed Cypriot membership of NATO or Partnership for Peace, preferring to keep Cyprus&#x27; foreign and defence affairs within the framework of the EU, i.e. the Common Security and Defence Policy (CSDP).

After the 2023 presidential election, Anastasiades&#x27; foreign minister Christodoulides succeeded him as President. In November 2024, Christodoulides reversed his previous stance and revealed a plan to deepen Cyprus&#x27; relations with NATO and eventually join as a full member. Under the first phase of the plan, Cyprus would seek to join preparatory organizations linked to NATO, which would require progress in resolving the Cyprus dispute with NATO member Turkey and improvements to EU–Turkey relations.

====Kosovo====

Kosovo has described PfP membership as a tactical and strategic objective of the government. Kosovo submitted an application to join the PfP program in July 2012. However, four NATO member states, Greece, Romania, Slovakia and Spain, do not recognize Kosovo&#x27;s independence and have threatened to block its participation in the program. To be eligible to join, the Kosovar Armed Forces must be established from the Kosovo Security Force.

===Previous members===

16 former member states of the PfP (namely Albania, Bulgaria, Croatia, Czech Republic, Estonia, Finland, Hungary, Latvia, Lithuania, Montenegro, North Macedonia, Poland, Romania, Slovakia, Slovenia and Sweden) have subsequently joined NATO.

====Note====
:1.Known as the former Yugoslav Republic of Macedonia before February 15, 2019.

== Legacy ==
During the post-Cold War era, equal distribution of opportunities to contribute to peacekeeping operations was made, but the status of middle and neutral powers such as Sweden, Finland, and Ireland also decreased. Therefore, neutral countries also faced a situation in which they had to reconsider maintaining military neutrality in the current international political unipolar system. In June 1997, a senior NATO official said a broader role was aimed at working closer with NATO and finally joining the alliance. While the PfP provides a framework for cooperative relations with Russia, it did not include a membership into NATO. Although the PfP has made important contributions to crisis management, such as peacekeeping operations, Ireland and Austria are still not NATO members.

== Evolution ==
In 2001, NATO granted participation in its Membership Action Plan (MAP) to nine of the 26 PfP countries. In 2002, NATO began the Individual Partnership Action Plan (IPAP) initiative during the 2002 Prague Summit. The goal of this plan was to provide member states of PfP a chance to be granted assistance from NATO to &quot;establish reform goals&quot; without the pressure of committing to NATO.

In 2003, the alliance assumed strategic command, control, and coordination of the mission and established a permanent International Security Assistance Force (ISAF) headquarters in Kabul. Since then, the operation has grown to about 120,000 troops from 47 countries.

During NATO&#x27;s 2004 Istanbul Summit, the Istanbul Cooperation Initiative was launched. During this summit, six countries of the Gulf Cooperation Council were included. Over the course of the summit, NATO also established the less formalized Partners across the Globe initiative.

The 2008 Russo-Georgian War had implications for the Partnership for Peace. President Dmitry Medvedev referred to an attack by Georgia against a Russian military base in Tskhinvali, the capital of South Ossetia, as &quot;Russia&#x27;s 9/11&quot;. The subsequent expansion of the previously bilateral Georgia Train and Equip Program, which had been established within the context of Georgia&#x27;s participation in the PfP, was viewed with alarm in Moscow.

As of 2023, Bosnia and Herzegovina is the only remaining participant in NATO&#x27;s Membership Action Plan (MAP).

== Partnership for Peace Education Initiative ==
The PfP has pushed for education programs amongst members of both NATO and the PfP composed of professional military education. Its purpose is to &quot;contribute to peace and security in the Euro-Atlantic region and beyond&quot;. These education programs and training are mostly focused on Central Asia and the South Caucasus.

== Struggles with funding ==
The Partnership for Peace has had ramification on its budget caused by the ever-changing formation of members. For instance, the average annual Wales Initiative Funding (WIF) established for the program was set at $43 million during the fiscal years of 1996 to 2005. In consequence of a decline in the number of countries participating in the program, annual funding was reduced to $29 million in fiscal years 2006 through 2010. Another factor includes the reduction of distribution of WIF funding in the program amongst aspiring members of NATO.

<doc id="368549" wikidata="Q309374" url="?curid=368549" title="Ryutaro Hashimoto">
<text>was a Japanese politician who served as prime minister of Japan from 1996 to 1998.

Born in Okayama Prefecture, Hashimoto graduated from Keio University in 1960 and entered the National Diet in 1963. He rose through the ranks of the Liberal Democratic Party and became major figure in the Tanaka/Takeshita faction, and served as health and welfare minister under Masayoshi Ōhira, transport minister under Yasuhiro Nakasone, and finance minister under Toshiki Kaifu. In 1994, he became minister of international trade and industry, then became prime minister in 1996 as the head of a coalition with the Social Democratic Party and New Party Sakigake. During his tenure, Hashimoto sought currency reform and tried to revive the Japanese economy. He resigned after the LDP lost its majority in the 1998 upper house election, but remained leader of his faction until a scandal in 2004. He retired from politics in 2005.

==Early political life==

Hashimoto was born on 29 July 1937, in Sōja in Okayama Prefecture. His father, Ryōgo Hashimoto, was a cabinet minister under Prime Minister Nobusuke Kishi. Following his father&#x27;s lead, Ryutaro received his degree in political science from Keio University in 1960, and was elected to the House of Representatives of Japan in 1963.

He moved through the ranks of the Liberal Democratic Party over the next twenty years, landing a spot as Minister of Health and Welfare under premier Masayoshi Ōhira in 1978, and in 1980 became the LDP&#x27;s director of finance and public administration. He again became a cabinet minister in 1986 under Yasuhiro Nakasone, and in 1989 became secretary general of the LDP, the highest rank short of party president (if the LDP is in government, usually also the prime minister.)

Hashimoto became a key figure in the strong LDP faction founded by Kakuei Tanaka in the 1970s, which later fell into the hands of Noboru Takeshita, who then was tainted by the Recruit scandal of 1988. In 1991, the press had discovered that one of Hashimoto&#x27;s secretaries had been involved in an illegal financial dealing. Hashimoto retired as Minister of Finance from the Second Kaifu Cabinet. Following the collapse of the bubble economy, the LDP momentarily lost power in 1993/94 during the Hosokawa and Hata anti-LDP coalition cabinets negotiated by LDP defector Ichirō Ozawa. Hashimoto was brought back to the cabinet when the LDP under Yōhei Kōno returned to power in 1994 by entering a ruling coalition with traditional archrival Japanese Socialist Party (JSP), giving the prime ministership to the junior partner, and the minor New Party Harbinger (NPH). Hashimoto became Minister of International Trade and Industry in the Murayama Cabinet of Tomiichi Murayama. As the chief of MITI, Hashimoto made himself known at meetings of APEC and at summit conferences.

In September 1995, Yōhei Kōno did not stand for another term. Hashimoto won the election to LDP president against Jun&#x27;ichirō Koizumi 304 votes to 87, and succeeded Kōno as leader of the party and as deputy prime minister in the Murayama cabinet.

==Prime minister==
When Murayama stepped down in 1996, the 135th National Diet elected Hashimoto to become Japan&#x27;s 82nd prime minister – he was elected against NFP leader Ichirō Ozawa with 288 votes to 167 in the lower house and 158 to 69 in the upper house – and lead the continued LDP-JSP-NPH coalition government (First Hashimoto Cabinet).

Hashimoto reached an agreement with the United States for the repatriation of MCAS Futenma, a controversial U.S. military base in an urban area of Okinawa, in April 1996. The deal was opposed by Japan&#x27;s foreign ministry and defense agency but was backed by Hashimoto&#x27;s American counterpart, President Bill Clinton. The repatriation of the base has yet to be completed as of 2015, as Okinawans have opposed efforts to relocate the base to a new site. Hashimoto&#x27;s domestic popularity increased during the Japanese-US trade dispute when he publicly confronted Mickey Kantor, US Trade Representative for the Clinton administration.

Hashimoto&#x27;s popularity was largely based on his attitude. When asked about why Japanese car dealerships did not sell American cars, he answered, &quot;Why doesn&#x27;t IBM sell Fujitsu computers?&quot; When Japan&#x27;s economy did not seem to be recovering from its 1991 collapse, Hashimoto ordered a commission of experts from the private sector to look into improving the Japanese market for foreign competition, and eventually opening it completely.

On 27 September 1996, the Hashimoto cabinet dissolved the lower house of the National Diet. In the ensuing general lower house election in October, the LDP made gains while its coalition partners SDP – the JSP had been renamed briefly after the formation of the Hashimoto cabinet – and NPH lost seats. Both parties ended the coalition with the LDP, but they remained Diet allies in a cooperation outside the cabinet &quot;(kakugai kyōryoku)&quot; until 1998. Thus, the LDP and the Second Hashimoto Cabinet safely controlled both houses of the Diet, although it was initially technically in the minority by a few seats in the lower house, and well short of a majority in the upper house. It was the first single-party LDP government since 1993. Having achieved this, Hashimoto was confirmed without challenger as party president in September 1997.

Hashimoto&#x27;s government raised the Japanese consumption tax in 1997. Although the government implemented a reduction in the personal income tax prior to raising the consumption tax, the hike still had a negative effect on consumer demand in Japan.

During the Upper House regular election 1998, the LDP failed to restore its majority (lost in 1989 and not to be regained until 2016) and instead lost more seats. Hashimoto resigned to take responsibility for this failure, and was succeeded as LDP president and Prime Minister by Foreign Minister Keizō Obuchi.

==Later political life==

Hashimoto stayed in a LDP adviser party, and in the 2nd Mori Cabinet the Minister of Okinawa Development Agency and Minister in charge of administrative reform were appointed. He led the faction for several years. In 2001 he was one of the leading candidates to take office as prime minister but lost in the election of the more popular Prime Minister Junichiro Koizumi.

Hashimoto&#x27;s faction began to collapse late in 2003 while debating over whether to re-elect Koizumi. In December 2004, Hashimoto stepped down as faction leader when he was found to have accepted a ¥100 million cheque from the Japan Dental Association, and announced that he would not run for re-election in his lower house district.

On World Water Day (22 March) in 2004, United Nations Secretary-General Kofi Annan established a global advisory board on Water and Sanitation, and appointed Ryutaro Hashimoto as its chairman. Just prior to his death, Hashimoto submitted a letter addressed to &quot;The People of the World&quot; for publication in the book &quot;Water Voices from Around The World&quot; (October 2007), which is a book affiliated with the United Nations&#x27; decade of water (2005–15). In his letter, he addressed water-related disasters around the world, with an urgent appeal to the United Nations to halve the number of deaths caused by water disasters by 2015. Hashimoto closes this letter by writing: &quot;An old proverb says &#x27;Dripping water wears away the stone.&#x27; I humbly suggest, that through steadfast efforts, we can overcome any obstacle our civilization may encounter in the coming decade.&quot;

==Personal life==
He was married to Kumiko Hashimoto (born 1941) (橋本 久美子 &quot;Hashimoto Kumiko&quot;), and the couple had two sons and three daughters: Ryu, Gaku, Hiroko, Atsuko, and Danko.

An exchange program between the Scout Association of Japan and the Boy Scouts of America was started in 1998, at the suggestion of then-Prime Minister Hashimoto in a 1996 meeting with U.S. President Bill Clinton. In 1998, he was presented with the Silver World Award by Jere Ratcliffe, Chief Scout Executive of the Boy Scouts of America, &quot;for outstanding contributions to young people on an international level&quot;.

==Death==
In June 2006, Hashimoto was hospitalized in an ICU to undergo surgery to remove a large part of his colon. On 1 July 2006 at the age of 68, Hashimoto died from complications of multiple organ failure and septic shock at the National Center for Global Health and Medicine in Shinjuku, Tokyo, just 28 days before his 69th birthday.

<doc id="368550" wikidata="Q706105" url="?curid=368550" title="Dubbo">
<text>Dubbo (; ) is a city in the Orana Region of New South Wales, Australia. It is the largest population centre in the Orana region, with a population of 43,516 at June 2021.

The city is located at the intersection of the Newell, Mitchell, and Golden highways. Dubbo officially became a city in the year 1966. Dubbo is located roughly above sea level, north-west of Sydney ( by road) and is a major road and rail freight hub to other parts of New South Wales. It is linked by national highways north to Brisbane and Charleville, south towards Melbourne and Canberra, east to Sydney, Newcastle and Gosford and west to Broken Hill and Adelaide.

Dubbo is included in the rainfall and weather forecast region for the Central West Slopes and in the Central West Slopes and Plains division of the Bureau of Meteorology forecasts.

== History ==

Evidence of habitation by the Wiradjuri tribe, Indigenous Australians dates back over 40,000 years.

Explorer and surveyor John Oxley was the first European to report on the area, now known as Dubbo, in 1818. The first permanent British colonists in the area were English-born Robert Dulhunty and his brother Lawrence Dulhunty.

Dulhunty occupied a property, known as Dubbo Station (established in 1828), from the early 1830s on a squatting basis. With the passing of the Squatting Act in 1836, he took out a licence on the property.

Dulhunty showed an affinity with Indigenous Australians, his party included some 40 Aboriginals and he favoured using Aboriginal names for properties, including Dubbo. Dubbo is now thought to be a mispronunciation of the local Wiradjuri word &quot;thubbo&quot;, but because of a lack of precise records from Dulhunty at the time and an incomplete knowledge of the Wiradjuri language today, some conjecture remains over the word&#x27;s meaning. Some references indicate that Dubbo was the name of an old Wiradjuri man who resided at the site when Dulhunty took the land. Dubbo&#x27;s name apparently meant &quot;red soil&quot;, consistent with the local landscape. &quot;Thubbo&quot; or &quot;tubbo&quot; possibly is Wiradjuri for &quot;head covering&quot;.

Dundullimal Homestead is a farmhouse from that period, built around 1840 by John Maugham on his sheep station. The building is one of the oldest homesteads still standing in western NSW and today is open to visitors.

In 1846, due to the number of settlers in the area, the government decided to establish a courthouse, police station, and lock-up in the Dubbo area. A constable&#x27;s residence was completed in 1847 and a wooden slab-construction courthouse and lock-up was completed in early 1848. By this time, the settlement had only four buildings - the constable&#x27;s residence, courthouse and lock-up, a store, and an inn.

Due to the lack of title for the land, in 1848, storekeeper Jean Emile Serisier organised a petition asking for a land sale of town allotments. The plan was presented to the colony&#x27;s surveyor general in May 1849 by surveyor G. Boyle White. The settlement was gazetted as a village in November 1849 with the first land sales taking place in 1850. Population growth was slow until the Victorian gold rush of the 1860s brought an increase in north–south trade. The first bank was opened in 1867. Steady population growth caused the town to be proclaimed a municipality in 1872, when its population was 850. The railway extension of the main western railway from Wellington to Dubbo was formally opened on 1 February 1881. By 1897, Dubbo had a general store, Carrier Arms, a slab courthouse, a gaol, and a police hut. The final section of the Molong to Dubbo railway opened in late May 1925.
Dubbo was officially proclaimed a city in 1966.

On 10 June 1989, during the Queen&#x27;s Birthday Long Weekend, Dubbo became the final stop of the Through West Mail, a train hauled by double-headed locomotives the &quot;Flying Scotsman&quot; and 3801, ending a journey of 289 miles.

==Heritage listings==

Dubbo has a number of heritage-listed sites, including:
* Cobra Street: Dubbo RAAF Stores Depot
* Macquarie Street: Talbragar Shire Council Chambers
* 110–114 Macquarie Street: National Australia Bank building, Dubbo
* 118 Macquarie Street: Colonial Mutual Life building, Dubbo
* 195–197 Macquarie Street: Milestone Hotel
* 215 Macquarie Street: Old Dubbo Gaol
* Main Western railway: Dubbo railway station
* Main Western railway 462.762 km: Macquarie River railway bridge, Dubbo
* Obley Road: Dundullimal Homestead

== Geography ==

The Macquarie River runs through Dubbo, as does Troy Creek. The City of Dubbo lies within a transition zone between the ranges and tablelands of the Great Dividing Range to the east and the Darling Basin plains to the west.

=== Climate ===
Dubbo falls in the warm temperate climate zone. Under Köppen climate classification, Dubbo has a humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cfa&quot;) that borders the semi-arid climate (&quot;BSk&quot;). Summers are warm to hot, and winters cool to cold, bringing some occurrences of early morning frost but generally no snowfall – unlike the nearby city of Orange. The last occurrence of snow was recorded by &quot;The Dubbo Liberal and Macquarie Advocate&quot; in July 1951 and 1920, with a heavy fall of snow in July 1900. The town&#x27;s location in this transition area allows a large temperature variation during the year, with high summer temperatures, often peaking above typical of western New South Wales, and colder subzero temperatures typical of the Central Tablelands in winter.

Dubbo&#x27;s location in the transition area between the Central Tablelands and the Central Western Plains has provided a mild distribution of rainfall throughout the year. Dubbo&#x27;s wettest month is January with an average rainfall of occurring on average over five days. Evaporation in the Dubbo area averages around per year. Dubbo is considerably sunny, receiving 148.6 days of clear skies annually, in contrast to Sydney&#x27;s 104 days.

Wind patterns vary over the whole year. The prevailing winds at Dubbo are from the southeast, south, southwest and west, which account for a combined 64.4% of the wind direction over the whole year.

== Demographics ==

In August 2021, the population of Dubbo was 43,516; 51.6% of residents were female and 48.4% were male. The median age is 35, slightly younger than the national average of 38.

<text>Mumtaz Mahal (; ; born Arjumand Banu Begum; 27 April 1593 – 17 June 1631) was the empress consort of Mughal Empire from 1628 to 1631 as the chief consort of the fifth Mughal emperor, Shah Jahan. The Taj Mahal in Agra, often cited as one of the Wonders of the World, was commissioned by her husband to act as her tomb.

Mumtaz Mahal was born Arjumand Banu Begum in Agra to a family of Persian nobility. She was the daughter of Abu&#x27;l-Hasan Asaf Khan, a wealthy Persian noble who held high office in the Mughal Empire, and the niece of Empress Nur Jahan, the chief wife of Emperor Jahangir and the power behind the emperor. She was married at the age of 19 on 10 May 1612 or 16 June 1612 to Prince Khurram, later known by his regnal name Shah Jahan, who conferred upon her the title &quot;Mumtaz Mahal&quot; . Although betrothed to Shah Jahan since 1607, she ultimately became his second wife in 1612. Mumtaz and her husband had 14 children, including Jahanara Begum (Shah Jahan&#x27;s favorite daughter), and the Crown prince Dara Shikoh, the heir-apparent, anointed by his father, who temporarily succeeded him until deposed by Mumtaz Mahal&#x27;s sixth child, Aurangzeb, who ultimately succeeded his father as the sixth Mughal emperor in 1658.

Mumtaz Mahal died in 1631 in Burhanpur, Deccan (present-day Madhya Pradesh) during the birth of her 14th child, a daughter named Gauhar Ara Begum. Shah Jahan had the Taj Mahal built as a tomb for her, which is considered to be a monument of undying love. As with other Mughal royal ladies, no contemporary likenesses of her are accepted, but imagined portraits were created from the 19th century onwards.

==Family and early life==
Mumtaz Mahal was born as Arjumand Banu on 27 April 1593 in Agra to Abu&#x27;l-Hasan Asaf Khan and his wife Diwanji Begum, the daughter of a Persian noble, Khwaja Ghias-ud-din of Qazvin. Asaf Khan was a wealthy Persian noble who held high office in the Mughal Empire. His family had come to India impoverished in 1577, when his father Mirza Ghias Beg (popularly known by his title of I&#x27;timad-ud-Daulah), was taken into the service of Emperor Akbar in Agra.

Asaf Khan was also the older brother of Empress Nur Jahan, making Mumtaz a niece, and later, a step daughter-in-law of Nur Jahan, the chief consort of Emperor Jahangir, Shah Jahan&#x27;s father. Her older sister, Parwar Khanum, married Sheikh Farid, the son of Nawab Qutubuddin Koka, the governor of Badaun, who was also the emperor Jahangir&#x27;s foster brother. Mumtaz also had a brother, Shaista Khan, who served as the governor of Bengal and various other provinces in the empire during Shah Jahan&#x27;s reign.

Mumtaz was remarkable in the field of learning and was a talented and cultured lady. She was well-versed in Arabic and Persian, and could compose poems in the latter. She was reputed to have a combination of modesty and candor, a woman warmly straightforward yet bemusedly self-possessed. Early in adolescence, she attracted the attention of important nobles of the realm. Jahangir must have heard about her, since he readily consented to Shah Jahan&#x27;s engagement with her.

==Marriage==
Mumtaz Mahal was betrothed to Shah Jahan around 5 April 1607, when she was 14 years old at the time and he was 15. They were, however, married five years after the year of their betrothal on 10 May 1612 or 7 June 1612 in Agra. After their wedding celebrations, Shah Jahan, &quot;finding her in appearance and character elect among all the women of the time&quot;, gave her the title &quot;Mumtaz Mahal&quot; (). During the intervening years between their betrothal and marriage, Shah Jahan had married his first wife, Princess Kandahari Begum in 1610 and in 1617, after marrying Mumtaz, took a third wife, Izz-un-Nissa Begum (titled Akbarabadi Mahal), the daughter of a prominent Mughal courtier. According to the official court historians, both the marriages were political alliances.
By all accounts, Shah Jahan was so taken with Mumtaz that he showed little interest in exercising his polygamous rights with his two other wives, other than dutifully siring a child with each. According to the official court chronicler, Motamid Khan, as recorded in his &quot;Iqbal Namah-e-Jahangiri&quot;, the relationship with his other wives &quot;had nothing more than the status of marriage. The intimacy, deep affection, attention and favour which Shah Jahan had for Mumtaz exceeded what he felt for his other wives.&quot; Likewise, Shah Jahan&#x27;s historian Inayat Khan commented that &#x27;his whole delight was centered on this illustrious lady [Mumtaz], to such an extent that he did not feel towards the others [i.e. his other wives] one-thousandth part of the affection that he did for her.&#x27;
Mumtaz had a loving marriage with Shah Jahan. Even during her lifetime, poets would extol her beauty, grace, and compassion. Despite her frequent pregnancies, Mumtaz travelled with Shah Jahan&#x27;s entourage throughout his earlier military campaigns and the subsequent rebellion against his father. She was his constant companion and trusted confidant, leading court historians to go to unheard lengths to document the intimate and erotic relationship the couple enjoyed. In their 19 years of marriage, they had 14 children together (eight sons and six daughters), seven of whom died at birth or at a very young age.

==Mughal empress==
Upon his accession to the throne in 1628 after subduing his half-brother, Shahryar Mirza, Shah Jahan designated Mumtaz as his chief empress with the title of Padshah Begum &#x27;(First Lady or Queen of the Great)&#x27;, &#x27;Malika-i-Jahan&#x27; (&quot;Queen of the World&quot;) and &#x27;Malika-uz-Zamani&#x27; (&quot;Queen of the Age&quot;) and &#x27;Malika-i-Hindustan (&quot;Queen of the Hindustan&quot;). Mumtaz&#x27;s tenure as empress was brief, spanning only three years due to her untimely death. Nonetheless, Shah Jahan bestowed her with magnanimous luxuries. She was also the only wife of Shah Jahan to be addressed as &quot;Hazrat&quot; being the mother of the heir apparent. For example, no other empress&#x27; residence was as decorated as Khas Mahal (part of Agra Fort), where Mumtaz lived with Shah Jahan. It was decorated with pure gold and precious stones and had rose-water fountains of its own. Each wife of the Mughal emperor was given a regular monthly allowance for her &quot;gastos&quot; (housekeeping or travelling expenses); the highest such allowance on record is the one million rupees per year given to Mumtaz Mahal by Shah Jahan. Apart from this income, he gave her a lot of high-income lands and properties.

Shah Jahan consulted Mumtaz in both private matters and the affairs of the state, and she served as his close confidant and trusted adviser and because of this, she had enormous political power. Like her predecessor and aunt Nur Jahan, Mumtaz sat next to the emperor in the Hall of Private Audience and Hall of Public Audience (Dīwān-e-Khās and Dīwān-e-Ām). She was hidden behind a curtain; if she did not agree with something, she would place her hand on his back, out of sight. At her intercession, he forgave enemies or commuted death sentences. His trust in her was so great that he gave her the highest honour of the land – his imperial seal, the Mehr Uzaz, which validated imperial decrees and nothing could be done without her consent. Mumtaz was portrayed as having no aspirations to political power, in contrast to her aunt, Empress Nur Jahan, the chief consort of Emperor Jahangir, who had wielded enormous power and considerable influence in the previous reign.

An uncontested and great influence on him, often intervening on behalf of the poor and destitute, she also enjoyed watching elephant and combat fights performed for the court. Mumtaz also patronized a number of poets, scholars and other talented persons. A noted Sanskrit poet, Vansidhara Mishra, was the Empress&#x27;s favourite. On the recommendation of her principal lady-in-waiting, Sati-un-Nissa, Mumtaz Mahal provided pensions and donations to the daughters of poor scholars, theologians, and pious men. It was quite common for women of noble birth to commission architecture in the Mughal Empire, so Mumtaz devoted some time to a riverside garden in Agra, which is now known as Zahara Bagh. It is the only architectural foundation that can be connected to her patronage.

== Death and aftermath==
Mumtaz Mahal died from postpartum hemorrhage in Burhanpur on 17 June 1631 while giving birth to her 14th child, after a prolonged labor of around 30 hours. She had been accompanying her husband while he was fighting a campaign in the Deccan Plateau. Her body was temporarily buried at Burhanpur in a walled pleasure garden known as Zainabad originally constructed by Shah Jahan&#x27;s uncle Daniyal on the bank of the Tapti River. The contemporary court chroniclers paid an unusual amount of attention to Mumtaz Mahal&#x27;s death and Shah Jahan&#x27;s grief at her demise. In the immediate aftermath of his bereavement, the emperor was reportedly inconsolable. Apparently, after her death, he went into secluded mourning for a year. When he appeared again, his hair had turned white, his back was bent, and his face worn. Mumtaz&#x27;s eldest daughter, Jahanara Begum, gradually brought her father out of grief and took her mother&#x27;s place at court.

Mumtaz Mahal&#x27;s personal fortune (valued at 10 million rupees) was divided by Shah Jahan between Jahanara Begum, who received half, and the rest of her surviving children. Burhanpur was never intended by her husband as his wife&#x27;s final resting spot. As a result, her body was disinterred in December 1631 and transported in a golden casket escorted by her son Shah Shuja, the deceased empress&#x27;s head lady-in-waiting, and the distinguished courtier Wazir Khan, back to Agra. There, it was interred in a small building on the banks of the Yamuna River. Shah Jahan stayed behind in Burhanpur to conclude the military campaign that had originally brought him to the region. While there, he began planning the design and construction of a suitable mausoleum and funerary garden in Agra for his wife. It was a task that would take 22 years to complete, the Taj Mahal.

=== Taj Mahal ===

The Taj Mahal was commissioned by Shah Jahan to be built as a mausoleum for Mumtaz Mahal. It is seen as an embodiment of undying love and marital devotion. English poet Sir Edwin Arnold describes it as &quot;Not a piece of architecture, as other buildings are, but the proud passion of an emperor&#x27;s love wrought in living stones.&quot; The beauty of the monument is also taken as a representation of Mumtaz Mahal&#x27;s beauty and this association leads many to describe the Taj Mahal as feminine. Since Muslim tradition forbids elaborate decorations on graves, the bodies of Mumtaz and Shah Jahan are placed in a relatively plain crypt beneath the inner chamber with their faces turned to the right and towards Mecca.

The Ninety Nine Names of God are found as calligraphic inscriptions on the sides of the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal in the crypt including, &quot;O Noble, O Magnificent, O Majestic, O Unique, O Eternal, O Glorious...&quot;. There are many theories about the origin of the name of this tomb and one of them suggests that &#x27;Taj&#x27; is an abbreviation of the name Mumtaz. European travelers, such as François Bernier, who observed its construction, were among the first to call it the Taj Mahal. Since they are unlikely to have come up with the name, they might have picked it up from the locals of Agra who called the Empress &#x27;Taj Mahal&#x27; and thought the tomb was named after her and the name began to be used interchangeably, but no firm evidence suggests this. Shah Jahan had not intended to entomb another person in the Taj Mahal; however, Aurangzeb had Shah Jahan buried next to the tomb of Mumtaz Mahal rather than build a separate tomb for his father. This is evident from the asymmetrical placement of Shah Jahan&#x27;s grave on one side of his wife&#x27;s grave which is in the centre.

<doc id="368553" wikidata="Q18569" url="?curid=368553" title="Douglas, Isle of Man">
<text>Douglas (, ) is the capital city and largest settlement of the Isle of Man, with a population of 26,677 (2021) and an area of . It is located at the mouth of the River Douglas, and on a sweeping bay of . The River Douglas forms part of the city&#x27;s harbour and main commercial port.

Douglas was a small settlement until it grew rapidly as a result of links with the English port of Liverpool in the 18th century. Further population growth came in the following century, resulting during the 1860s in a staged transfer of the High Courts, the Lieutenant Governor&#x27;s residence (actually located in nearby Onchan), and finally the seat of the legislature, Tynwald, to Douglas from the ancient capital, Castletown.

The city is the island&#x27;s main hub for business, finance, legal services, shipping, transport, shopping, and entertainment. The annual Isle of Man TT motorcycle races start and finish in Douglas.

== Name ==
It is generally agreed that the toponyms of English &quot;Douglas&quot; and Manx &quot;Doolish&quot; both come from Proto-Celtic *&quot;duboglassio&quot;-, where *&quot;dubo&quot;- (which survives today in Welsh as &quot;du&quot; and Irish as &quot;dubh&quot;) meant &#x27;black; deep&#x27; and *&quot;glassio&quot;- (surviving in Welsh &quot;glais&quot; and Irish &quot;glais&quot;) meant &#x27;water, river&#x27;; thus, it probably meant &#x27;deep river&#x27;. The name of the city thus came from a nearby river. It is a common name for place names around the British Isles, related to other toponyms such as Dyfleis, Dulais, Develish, Dawlish, Dowlish and, of course, other settlements named Douglas.

==History==

===Early history===
In the absence of any archaeological data, the origins of the city may be revealed by analysis of the original street and plot pattern. The discovery of a bronze weapon in central Douglas, and the large Ballaquayle Viking treasure hoard on the outskirts (now in the Manx Museum and British Museum, London), both in the 1890s, hint at the early importance of the site now occupied by Douglas. Scholars agree that the name of the city derives from Early Celtic &#x27;Duboglassio&#x27; meaning &#x27;black river&#x27;. Douglas is twice referred to in the monastic &quot;Chronicle of the Kings of Man and the Isles&quot;: first in 1190, when the monks of St Mary&#x27;s Abbey at Rushen were transferred there for a four-year stay; then again in 1313, when Robert the Bruce, King of Scotland, spent the night at the &quot;monastery of Duglas&quot; on his way to seize Castle Rushen. These may be references to the site of the later Nunnery, a little upstream from the port.

The first detailed documentation shows that in 1511 there were only thirteen resident households in the settlement clustered north of the harbour; most of the property there was classified as &quot;chambers&quot; (unoccupied, unheated, single-celled structures) for which rent was paid by non-residents including clergy, officials and landowners from elsewhere on the island. This suggests that the city&#x27;s nucleus originated as a non-urban port. Speculation links the store buildings with the Irish Sea herring fishery, and the import/export trade.

===Growth and development===
In 1681 Thomas Denton described Douglas as &quot;the place of greatest resort&quot; on the Isle of Man, and by 1705 a clear picture of the early town emerges, with hints that its residential, market, and military defence functions were growing in importance alongside the port facility. The town thrived in the next 60 years, as imposing merchants&#x27; houses, large warehouses, quays and a pier were built to accommodate the burgeoning &quot;running trade&quot; (smuggling): one of the stimuli for the town&#x27;s expansion. Other forms of trade also grew, and after the Revestment Act 1765, Douglas began to reap the benefits of transatlantic trade, due in part to co-operation at a local level with Liverpool. Legitimate merchants who rose to prominence over the period included the Murreys, the Moores, and the Bacons. The town&#x27;s later prosperity was facilitated by the low cost of living, and the favourable legal status enjoyed by English debtors and half-pay officers. The initial growth and development of the ALR owed much to its natural harbour (now the Inner Harbour), since greatly expanded and improved. Over the 18th century, the town&#x27;s population rose from about 800 in 1710 to nearly 2,500 in 1784.

Throughout the 19th century, the town&#x27;s demographics followed the same trends as the United Kingdom, due to the Industrial Revolution. The number of holiday visitors grew from the early 19th century, and from around 1870 onwards, the town was transformed into a leading holiday resort. But there were increasingly unsanitary conditions, and poor quality housing; again reflecting a trend seen across the United Kingdom. The open sewage, middens (domestic waste dumps), and smell from the harbour at low tide all contributed to the town&#x27;s uncleanliness. Oil and gas lamps first appeared in the late 1820s and 1830s, the first hospital to join the Dispensary was built in 1850, and in 1832 the scenic Tower of Refuge was built in Douglas Bay to offer shelter and provisions for sailors awaiting rescue. Douglas in the first half of the 19th century often suffered from the destitution of its population and the many epidemics, in particular cholera.

The rise of Douglas as the social and economic stronghold was recognised in 1869, when it became the home of the island&#x27;s parliament, Tynwald, and therefore the capital, an honour previously held by Castletown, a smaller town in the south of the island. Douglas&#x27;s political landscape also changed significantly in the 19th century, in spite of the conservatism of some townsfolk: in 1844, for example, at a public meeting, the idea of a town council was rejected in favour of retaining the system of Town High Bailiffs; when the Town Bill Act was passed at Tynwald in 1852, the people of Douglas again rejected the idea. However, an Act passed later that decade, which did not include opt-out clauses, was accepted, and in 1860, Douglas elected its first town council, which was predominantly middle class in its makeup. The Town Commissioners could tackle the town&#x27;s problems with greater efficiency, and by 1869 the sewage problem had been largely resolved.

The Commissioners also worked to alter the anachronistic architecture of Douglas, built during the era of fishing and trading, and no longer amenable or safe for tourists. The proportion of the total Manx population living in Douglas was also expanding, with 35% living there by 1891. The Victorian and later modernisation of the town was achieved at the expense of the original maze-like layout of the oldest streets. These were cleared away in the new street schemes and slum clearances of the 1870s to 1920s. The town&#x27;s infrastructure was radically altered for tourists&#x27; convenience, and in 1878 the Loch Promenade was constructed. In 1870, there were 60,000 visitors annually; by 1884, this had grown to 182,000. In 1887, 310,916 visited for Queen Victoria&#x27;s Golden Jubilee.

===Seafaring links===
The earliest organised ferry services emerged between Douglas and Whitehaven, established by William Nicholson in the 1750s. More formally, Nicholson&#x27;s Packet Service began in 1765 or 1766, and the Post Office mail contract was secured by 1782. Sailings were irregular and heavily dependent on weather conditions. Steamer services brought a considerable improvement; the first regular link (en route between Greenock and Liverpool) was available from 1819. The formation of what became the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company in 1830 led to greatly improved services, and also laid the foundations for growth in both cargo and tourist traffic.

The Royal National Lifeboat Institution (RNLI) has a lifeboat station at Douglas. The first lifeboat station in the port was established in 1802. In 1825 it was one of the first lifeboat stations to be provided with a purpose-built lifeboat; this was at the request of Sir William Hillary, the founder of the Institution. It was not operational between 1851 and 1868, and it closed in 1895. The station, established in 1874, operates the Tyne-class lifeboat &quot;Sir William Hillary&quot;. There are three memorials to Sir William in Douglas: one in St George&#x27;s Church where he was buried in 1847, one on Loch Promenade, and the other on Douglas Head near where he established the Tower of Refuge in 1832.

===Recent history===
During the First and Second World Wars, some parts of Douglas and elsewhere in the Isle of Man were home to internment camps for &quot;enemy aliens&quot;. Douglas held seven out of the ten internment camps on the island during World War II, including: Hutchinson, Metropole, Central, Palace, Granville and Sefton Camp. Sections of the Promenade were cordoned off and many guest houses were used for the purpose. The war dead of the island are commemorated on the Douglas War Memorial.

Douglas is now the main home of the island&#x27;s offshore financial services industry, and also of the main shopping centre.

The city was the birthplace of brothers Maurice, Robin and Barry Gibb, members of the Bee Gees.

Douglas was home to the Summerland leisure centre, which suffered a catastrophic fire in 1973.

In 2011 Douglas hosted the Commonwealth Youth Games.

On 20 May 2022, it was announced that, as part of the Platinum Jubilee Civic Honours, Douglas would receive city status by Letters Patent sometime later in 2022. The letters patent was expected to be effective from 1 November 2022, although there were some reports in November 2022 that it was somehow delayed following the death of Queen Elizabeth II, to a unknown date. A council meeting was said to discuss the issue in February 2023, but it was not discussed. Queen Camilla presented Letters Patent conferring city status on 20 March 2024.

==Geography==

Douglas is on the east of the island near the confluence of the two rivers Dhoo and Glass forming the Douglas. At Douglas, the river flows through the quay and into Douglas Bay. A gently sloping valley runs inland and there are hills around the city.
The city is surrounded by several villages, most notably Onchan to the north-east (which forms a conurbation with Douglas) and Union Mills to the west.

=== Climate ===
The weather reporting station closest to Douglas is the coastal weather station at Ronaldsway, about south-west of Douglas. The highest temperature recorded in Ronaldsway stands at 
, recorded in July 1983. On average, a temperature of or more is recorded 0.8 days per year at Ronaldsway (1981–2010) and on average the highest temperature of the year is .

On average, 14.5 days of air frost per year were recorded at Ronaldsway in the period 1981–2010. The lowest temperature recorded in Ronaldsway is , recorded in December 1961. For the period of 1981–2010, the lowest temperature of the year was on average.

==Demography==
The Isle of Man census 2021 lists the population of Douglas as 26,677, a reduction from the 2011 population of 27,938. The 2001 census gave a population of 25,347. The city has 31.73% of the island&#x27;s total population of 84,069.

==Governance==
Douglas elects eight members of the House of Keys: two each from four constituencies (Central, East, South and North). The House of Keys is the lower house of Tynwald, the Manx parliament. The local authority responsible for the running of services is Douglas City Council (formerly Douglas Borough Council), which has 12 elected councillors.

==Transport==
Douglas is the hub of the island&#x27;s bus network, with frequent services to Port Erin, Peel and Ramsey, as well as various more local bus services. The city also has the termini of the two main railway lines on the island: the steam railway to Port Erin and the electric tramway to Ramsey. It is also the home of the ferry terminal, from where the Isle of Man Steam Packet Company operates regular services to Heysham and to Liverpool (Birkenhead in winter) and occasional services to Dublin and to Belfast.

==Media==
The Isle of Man&#x27;s three main radio stations Manx Radio, Energy FM and 3FM are all based in Douglas.

Local TV coverage is served by &quot;BBC North West Tonight&quot; on BBC One and &quot;ITV Granada Reports&quot; on ITV1.

The city is served by three local newspapers: the &quot;Isle of Man Examiner&quot;, the &quot;Isle of Man Courier&quot; and the &quot;Manx Independent&quot;.

==Education==
References to education in Douglas begin in the late 17th century, with mention of the schoolmastership, usually combined with the Chaplaincy of Douglas, and reference to a &quot;petty school&quot; in 1675. William Walker (1679–1729) was appointed to the mastership in 1700; school was probably kept in the old Chapel, in later Heywood Place.) Walker was later preferred as Rector of Ballaugh, and received an honorary Doctorate. He is now remembered in his mother&#x27;s Manx Gaelic lament on her sons: &quot;Illiam Walker &quot;as&quot; Robin Tear&quot;.

The more formal history of education in the city begins with Bishop Thomas Wilson&#x27;s establishment of the Douglas Grammar School. Alderman William Dixon (a native of Douglas, but resident in Dublin since at least the 1680s) agreed to hand over his parents&#x27; former home, and passed over the New Bond Street property in 1714. The Bishop raised an endowment of £500 (Irish currency), half being funded by the Barrow Trustees, most of the balance being provided by the Bishop&#x27;s Douglas relatives, the Murrey family. Even after this, the mastership of Douglas Grammar School continued to be combined with the Chaplaincy, now of the new Chapel of St Matthew. Details of the building of the original Grammar School are sparse, but it seems that William Murrey was deeply involved, retaining the use of the capacious storage vault under the school in lieu of repayment of £150 costs.

Another notable Master of the Grammar School was Rev. Philip Moore (1705–1783) who was a native of the city, his father Robert Moore having been one of the &quot;Undertakers&quot; who organised the construction of St Matthews, and his mother Miss Katherine Kelly. Moore was appointed Master in 1735, and was reckoned to be a good classical scholar, and have &quot;an inherent love of teaching&quot;.

Today, Douglas has two high schools: Ballakermeen High School and St. Ninian&#x27;s High School, and numerous primary schools. University College Isle of Man and the International Business School are also located in Douglas.

==Landmarks==

Douglas has a number of attractions and items of interest:

*The Tower of Refuge is a small castle-like shelter built upon Conister Rock in Douglas Bay as a sanctuary for shipwrecked sailors. Construction was instigated by Sir William Hillary, founder of the RNLI.
*Douglas Head is home to the Grand Union Camera Obscura which has recently undergone restoration and is open to the public during the summer months. Other artefacts and remnants of Victorian Tourism can still be found on walks around the area.
*The horse-drawn trams that run along the promenade from the Villa Marina to the Manx Electric Railway station from spring to early autumn.
*Steam trains run 15 miles from Douglas railway station to Port Erin in the south of the island.
*The Grandstand on Glencrutchery Road marks the start and finish of the annual TT Races and various other motorsports.
*The Gaiety Theatre and the Villa Marina are popular venues for all manner of stage acts: from rock music to comedy to drama to ballet. The Gaiety Theatre is one of the best surviving examples of the work of Frank Matcham and dates from 1900. Both venues have recently undergone extensive renovations.
*The award-winning Manx Museum in Kingswood Grove contains many of the most important cultural artefacts relating to the Manx nation.

<doc id="368557" wikidata="Q35001" url="?curid=368557" title="Lismore, New South Wales">
<text>Lismore is a city located in the Northern Rivers region of New South Wales, Australia and the main population centre in the City of Lismore local government area, it is also a regional centre in the Northern Rivers region of the state. Lismore is north of Sydney and south of Brisbane. It is situated on a low floodplain on the banks of the Wilsons River near the latter&#x27;s junction with Leycester Creek, both tributaries of the Richmond River which enters the Pacific Ocean at Ballina, to the east. 

The original settlement initially developed as a grazing property in the 1840s, then became a timber and agricultural town and inland port based around substantial river traffic, which prior to the development of the road and rail networks was the principal means of transportation in the region. Use of the river for transport declined and then ceased around the mid-twentieth century, however by that time Lismore (which was elevated to city status in 1946) had become well established as the largest urban centre in the region, providing its surrounding area with a range of services. The city is also located on the Bruxner Highway which crosses the Wilsons River at Lismore, and was formerly a stop on the Casino-Murwillumbah railway line. It is the home of one of the three campuses of Southern Cross University.

With its low-lying position adjacent to the Wilsons River, which can rise rapidly following periods of high rainfall in its catchment, the centre of Lismore is susceptible to flooding, although it is partly protected by a system of levees and flood gates. Noteworthy recent floods occurred in 1974, 2017 in the aftermath of Cyclone Debbie and the worst ever in 2022. A budget was announced for additional flood mitigation works in November 2018.

At the , the urban population of Lismore was 28,816.

==History==
===Pre-colonial history===
The city of Lismore lies in the Bundjalung people&#x27;s nation area. However, the actual area of the Bundjalung people from Evans Head is currently under examination, as well as the actual origin of the name Bundjalung. It has been suggested that the Aboriginal people called the area Tuckurimbah meaning &quot;glutton.&quot; 

===Early colonial history===

The British history of the city begins in : a pastoral run covering an area of was taken up by Captain Dumaresq at this time covering the Lismore area and was stocked with sheep from the New England area. Ward Stephens took up the run in the same year, but the subtropical climate was unsuited for sheep grazing, so it was eventually abandoned. In January 1845, William and Jane Wilson took it over. The Wilsons were Scottish immigrants, who arrived in New South Wales in May 1833. Mrs. Wilson named the property after the small island of Lismore, one of the Inner Hebrides in Loch Linnhe, Argyleshire.

In 1855, the surveyor Frederick Peppercorne was instructed by Sir Thomas Mitchell to determine a site for a township in the area. Peppercorne submitted his map of the proposed village reserve on 16 February 1856. The chosen site was William Wilson&#x27;s homestead paddock and the area was proclaimed the &quot;Town of Lismore&quot; in the NSW Government Gazette on 1 May 1856. The township was soon settled and its post office was opened on 1 October 1859. The Wilson family then established a new homestead at Monaltrie, some 6 km south of Lismore, in 1861 which still survives and has been stated to be &quot;Lismore&#x27;s oldest home&quot;, although the Lismore &quot;Northern Star&quot; has elsewhere given that distinction to a timber-built home &quot;Lochiel&quot; adjacent to Arthur Park in North Lismore, stated to date from 1860 and originally occupied by Mr and Mrs John Jones, and later a private hospital and local maternity hospital between 1911 and 1917.
From the 1840s onwards, timber cutters moved up the Richmond River from its Ballina entrance felling timber from the extensive, previously untouched subtropical rainforest covering the region known as the &quot;Big Scrub&quot;; their primary interest was the Australian red cedar, &quot;Toona ciliata&quot;, known locally as &quot;red gold&quot;, which was highly prized for its appearance, ease of working, and pest resistance. At that time there was no substantial network of roads so rivers were the primary means of access and bulk transportation. Despite its low-lying position and propensity for flooding (which was to cause problems in subsequent times), Lismore developed as an inland port owing to its location at the highest navigable point for large cargo-carrying vessels on the north arm of the Richmond, later renamed the Wilsons, River. For the second half of the 19th century the primary industries of the Lismore region continued to be cattle grazing and timber, supporting a growing economy and population and the development of secondary industries which included ship building, transportation, saw milling, tallow manufacturing and more. As the Big Scrub was cleared, it was steadily replaced with new pasture which formed the basis of a flourishing dairy industry, and many processing plants (&quot;butter factories&quot;) and dairy cooperatives were established throughout the region. Infrastructure development in Lismore continued, including the presence of three schools by 1879, a new Government Wharf in 1880, two new bridges over the river in 1884 and 1885, the railway station (1894) and a new post office building (1898); by the end of that century Lismore had a population of over 4,500, although had suffered from some ravages including numerous floods plus a period of drought in the last half of the 1890s.

===20th century and beyond===

At the beginning of the 20th century, river navigation was still the mainstay of transportation in Lismore, the principal operator being the North Coast Steam Navigation Company. The dairy industry was performing strongly, employing hundreds of small family-owned operations, the Lismore region becoming the centre for dairy production from the surrounding farms and the richest dairy district in Australia. The railway station had opened in 1894 as the starting point of the Murwillumbah railway line which, starting at that time in Lismore, ran to the coast at Byron Bay (from which steamers could be caught to Sydney) and then on to Murwillumbah, and subsequently in 1903 inland to Casino, but was not connected to any national network. However, as the century progressed, development of a better road network and the advance of motor transportation made inroads into the long-term success of both the river and rail traffic which eventually declined: river traffic was also affected by requisitioning of ships during the second world war and the largest shipping line operating on the two arms of the Richmond River, the North Coast Steam Navigation Company, went into liquidation in 1954; the railway line lasted until 2004 when it was closed on purely economic grounds after advising that it was &quot;unprofitable&quot; to continue providing services to Murwillumbah, putting an end to 110 years of rail transport in the region. Meanwhile, economic development in Lismore continued, including construction of a new School of Arts (1907, destroyed by fire in 1932), building of churches for four denominations, opening of a new Norco (dairy farmers&#x27; cooperative) factory in 1931, and other utilities.

===Transport in Lismore===
Regular coach services towards Casino and Brisbane are run by Premier Motor Service, and NSW Trainlink.
Ballina Buslines and Northern Rivers Buslines run regular services towards Byron Bay, Kyogle, Ballina, Goonellebah, and Nimbin. These services are cash **ONLY**.
Tickets may be purchased onboard the bus.
The network is considered to be in need of maintenance and work by most residents, due to high levels of crime and bad service outside of the city centre.
===City status===

Lismore was officially gazetted as a city on 9 September 1946, with grant of an official coat of arms on 29 January 1947. In the early 1950s, civic pride was boosted by a visit from the newly crowned Queen Elizabeth II with her consort who visited the city in February 1954, staying at the city&#x27;s Gollan Hotel.

Television came to the city in 1956 and a local channel commenced broadcast in 1962 in the suburb of Goonellabah, which had been incorporated into the city of Lismore four years earlier. In 1969, the aerodrome at South Lismore received its licence from the Department of Civil Aviation, becoming the basis of the future Lismore Airport. The 1960s were something of a boom time in development for Lismore, although the dairy industry was starting to decline and by the end of that decade and into the 1970s, many farmers turned to raising beef cattle instead, or simply let their land condition lapse.

In 1963, a new bridge (the Ballina St. bridge) was opened to carry the Bruxner Highway road traffic across the Wilsons River; previously all traffic between the east and west banks of the river has to travel via the narrower, upstream Fawcett Bridge, originally constructed in 1894, before even motor traffic had come to the area.

Later, especially following the 1973 &quot;alternative society&quot; Aquarius Festival, which was held in the nearby village of Nimbin, the area began to attract so-called &quot;alternative lifestylers&quot; who were able to buy ex-dairying land at reasonable prices and re-invigorate the area with a range of pursuits and values of interest to a new generation, including an interest in owner-building of residences, experiments in communal living, environmental awareness and various artistic and creative activities, leading to badging of the area around Lismore as the &quot;rainbow region&quot;. Meanwhile, Lismore has also become a regional centre for higher education: the original Lismore Teachers College (1970 onwards) becoming first the Northern Rivers College of Advanced Education in 1973, then an associate member of the University of New England, and finally (together with UNE-Coffs Harbour Centre), forming the Lismore Campus of the new Southern Cross University (established 1 January 1994). In addition, tourism has become an important contributor to the region&#x27;s economy as well as the development of new agricultural products such as macadamias, avocado and stone fruit, pecans, and boutique coffee plantations, which are well suited to the rich volcanic soils, subtropical climate and moderately high rainfall of the area.

As traditional agricultural and manufacturing sectors have declined somewhat, so employment in the service sector has expanded. At the 2016 census, within Lismore City and the surrounding region (43,135 persons) the top employment sectors reported were Health Care and Social Assistance (4,534 persons), Retail Trade (2,491 persons), Education and Training (2,448 persons) and Accommodation and Food Services (1,297 persons), followed by Public Administration and Safety (1,204 persons), Agriculture, Forestry and Fishing (1,018 persons), Manufacturing (1,000 persons) and Construction (967 persons).

===Architecture and amenities===


Surviving buildings of historical interest within Lismore City include the old Council Chambers (1928) in Molesworth Street designed by William Gilroy, now home to the Richmond River Historical Society Museum with a collection of objects, documents and photographs relevant to the historical development of the area, including Aboriginal artifacts; the Art Nouveau post office (1897), designed by W.L. Vernon; the original Australian Joint Stock Bank (1891), built in the Italianate style, now the T &amp; G Building; the classical revival courthouse (1883) in Zadoc Street; the Lismore Memorial Baths (1928), constructed as a memorial to local persons who died in World War I; and various churches including St Andrew&#x27;s Anglican Church (1904), St Carthage&#x27;s Roman Catholic Cathedral (1892–1907), the Uniting (formerly Methodist) Church (1908–09), the Church of Christ (1923), and St Paul&#x27;s Presbyterian Church (1907–08). Adjacent to St. Carthage&#x27;s Cathedral, Presentation House, a convent opened for the Roman Catholic Presentation Sisters in 1907 and used by the nuns until 2004, has been refurbished and now serves as the Catholic Schools Office for the Diocese of Lismore.

The commercial city centre retains many shopfronts ranging in date from the late nineteenth to mid twentieth centuries with little modern intrusion; a feature of interest is the presence of numerous arcades, for example the 1920s Star Court Arcade, which includes the 1921 Star Court Theatre, which allow shoppers to continue to shop in comfort in the presence of subtropical downpours as well as extremes of heat or cold.

Many homes in the city are built in the &quot;high set&quot; style otherwise common to much of Queensland (refer accompanying photographs) with living accommodation on the first floor leaving the ground floor unenclosed by structural walls and open to cooling breezes beneath the floorboards in the summer. With the advent of air conditioning in more recent years, such understories have frequently been walled in retrospectively and used for other purposes such as garages, play areas (rumpus rooms) or additional accommodation; in commercial areas they may also be adapted for shop fronts at street/pedestrian level. Most houses also feature covered verandahs wrapping around part or all of the house, to provide both shade from hot sun as needed, and an outdoor area protected from the elements for activities during wet weather.

The city encompasses a range of parks and gardens, some bordering the river, as well as Rotary Park, a patch of regenerated rainforest close to the centre of the city, and a 27 ha remnant of the &quot;Big Scrub&quot; in the form of the Wilson Nature Reserve (see below).

==Rainforest==
Lismore and surrounding towns were once part of the rainforest referred to as the &quot;Big Scrub&quot;, of which less than one percent remains following British settlement. A section of this rainforest is viewable in the grounds of the Southern Cross University and at Wilsons Nature Reserve on Wyrallah Road.

==Geography==

Lismore is located on the Bruxner Highway and it lies at the confluence of the Wilsons River (a tributary of the Richmond River) and Leycester Creek, The state capital city of Sydney is located to the south by highway. Brisbane, the state capital of Queensland, is to the north.

Lismore&#x27;s central business district is located from the eastern coast, and southwest of Byron Bay. The coastal town of Ballina is away. There are a number of rainforest patches in the area, remnants of the Big Scrub. These are preserved today, with a small pocket known as Boatharbour Reserve just east of town on the Bangalow road. The nearest large and publicly accessible national park is Nightcap National Park.

==Climate and weather==
===General characteristics===
Lismore experiences a humid subtropical climate with mild to warm temperatures all year round and ample rainfall, with a long term yearly average of 1,343 mm. Temperatures in summer range between and . The subtropical climate combined with geographical features means the urban area is unusually humid when compared with surrounding areas. Humidity levels often reach 100% in summer. Lismore has 109.6 clear days annually.

===Floods===
Although no other major environmental hazards generally affect the area, Lismore is renowned for frequent floods from Wilsons River and Leycester Creek. Prior to the 2022 event which reached an unprecedented , the worst such floods were in 1954 and 1974, when waters rose to a height of , with a number of others recorded as exceeding the stated height of the levee wall protection at . A history of Lismore flood events from 1870 to 2022 has been published by Lismore council.

In 1999 a government-funded scheme to protect the CBD and South Lismore from a 1-in-10-year flood event was approved. This proposal would mean that most of the smaller floods would not enter the central area of Lismore and substantially improve the time available for the evacuation of residents and the business community in larger floods. Nonetheless, around 3000 residents of Lismore were evacuated after floods affected much of the area on 30 June 2005, many being temporarily housed on the campus of Southern Cross University. However, the new levee that had been completed two weeks prior limited damage and stopped the water reaching the Central Business District.

In the aftermath of Cyclone Debbie in March 2017, Lismore was again badly affected by flooding of up to through all CBD businesses. Wilsons River reached and the levee was overtopped for the first time since its completion. A modelled projection of the maximum flood extent, plus an animation, of this flood event as affecting Lismore is available on the &quot;BigData Earth&quot; Company website.

A budget of $8.2 million for additional flood mitigation works was announced in November 2018.

In February 2022, Lismore and other parts of Northern New South Wales and South East Queensland were flooded to an unprecedented degree, resulting in serious devastation to many buildings in the CBD in addition to adjacent low lying residential areas which will take &quot;years to rebuild&quot;. The Wilsons River in Lismore reached 14.37 metres at its peak, the largest flood since modern records began. One year on from the disaster, the process of reconstruction was still ongoing.

===Drought and water security===
A high degree of year-to-year variation in rainfall is typical of the Northern Rivers region. Periods of reduced rainfall are often associated with El Niño events and increased rainfall with La Niña events. For example, the region experienced a significant reduction in rainfall between late 2002 and mid-2003 and again in 2007 in association with persistent and recurrent El Niño events. In common with other areas in Australia, the Lismore region can experience drought but in general, the Northern Rivers region is less drought prone than many of its neighbours, especially those west of the Great Dividing Range (see example map for the drought-affected month of September 2019 here). The municipal water supply is provided by Rous County Council via Rocky Creek Dam, which is situated in a high rainfall area within the Whian Whian State Conservation Area approximately 20 km north of the city, and can be supplemented by drawing additional water from the Wilsons River when required. According to data in the Drought Management Plan adopted by the Council in 2016, level 1 water restrictions for the whole supply region (which stretches from Woodburn in the south to Ocean Shores in the north, as well as westwards to Lismore) would be triggered if the level in Rocky Creek Dram falls to 60%, level 2 restrictions at 45% of capacity, and so on. From 2002 up to late 2019, only one period of severe water restrictions was recorded (reaching level 5 in March 2003) with one other period of lesser severity (level 1 restrictions) during the second half of 2007.

===Other severe weather events===
Lismore is often hit by severe storms in spring and summer. For example, there was a severe hailstorm on 9 October 2007. A tornado is an extreme rarity, but later that same month one struck nearby Dunoon. It was captured on video as it hit an electrical transformer station there.

===Quantifying natural hazard risks===
In a 2016 report prepared for Insurance Australia Group (IAG), the consulting company SGS Economics and Planning rated and mapped different Local Government Areas (LGAs) across Australia against a range of natural hazard risks, namely Tropical Cyclone, Storm, Bushfire, Earthquake and Flood. On a 0-5 scale where 0 = no exposure, 5 = extreme risk, the region which includes Lismore rated 1 for Earthquake, 2 for Storm and Bushfire, 3 for Tropical Cyclone and 4 for Flood risk (SGS report, Figures 1, 3, 5, 6, 8).

==Demographics==
At the , there were 28,816 people in built-up Lismore.
* Aboriginal and Torres Strait Islander people made up 7.1% of the population.
* 83.5% of people were born in Australia. The most common other countries of birth were England 2.1%, New Zealand 1.1%, Philippines 0.6%, India 0.5% and Germany 0.4%.
* 87.7% of people only spoke English at home. Other languages spoken at home included Italian at 0.5%.
* The most common responses for religion were No Religion 41.8%, Catholic 19.4% and Anglican 11.8%.
The population reached a recent peak of 29,320 at June 2012 and since has experienced a gradual decline to 28,816 in 2021. The population of central Lismore in 2021 was 3,656.

==Media==
&quot;The Northern Star&quot; is an online tabloid newspaper based in Lismore. It covers the region from Lismore, Casino, Ballina, Byron Bay, Murwillumbah, and Tweed Heads, and, like many other regional Australian newspapers owned by NewsCorp, the newspaper ceased print editions in June 2020 and became an online-only publication. 

The &quot;Northern Rivers Echo&quot; was a free weekly community newspaper for Lismore, Alstonville, Wollongbar, Ballina, Casino, Nimbin and Evans Head. The &quot;Lismore CBD Magazine&quot; is a monthly e-magazine publication.

The commercial radio stations of Lismore are Triple Z (Hit Music) and 2LM 900 AM (also broadcast on 104.3FM) and both are run by Broadcast Operations Group.

<text>Peter Douglas Beattie (born 18 November 1952) is an Australian former politician who served as the 36th Premier of Queensland, in office from 1998 to 2007. He was the state leader of the Labor Party from 1996 to 2007.

Beattie was born in Sydney but grew up in Atherton, Queensland. He worked as a lawyer, union secretary and ALP State Secretary before entering politics. Beattie was elected to the Queensland Legislative Assembly at the 1989 state election. He served as a Health Minister from 1995 to 1996 under Wayne Goss, and then replaced Goss as party leader following a change in government. As leader of the opposition, Beattie led the Labor Party back to power at the 1998 election, and won further victories at the 2001, 2004 and 2006 elections. He retired in 2007 and was succeeded by his deputy Anna Bligh.

After retiring as Premier, Beattie was appointed to a series of corporate government and academic boards and held numerous academic roles. He made an unsuccessful attempt to enter federal politics at the 2013 election, standing in the Division of Forde. In 2016, Beattie was made chairman of the organising committee for the 2018 Commonwealth Games on the Gold Coast. He was appointed a Commissioner of the Australian Rugby League Commission in July, 2017 and chair in February 2018 and Deputy Chair of the Rugby League International Federation (RLIF) in November, 2018. Beattie joined the board of the Medical Research Commercialisation Fund in July 2010 and became chair in July 2019.

==Early life==
Beattie was born in Sydney as the youngest of seven children. Following the death of his mother when he was four years old, he was raised by his grandmother at Atherton, a small town in North Queensland, and attended Atherton State High School where he was both Dux and School Captain. He moved to Brisbane to attend the University of Queensland after winning a Commonwealth Scholarship, graduating with a Bachelor of Arts degree and a Bachelor of Laws degree. He was President of the Student Club at St John&#x27;s College. He completed a Master of Arts degree from Queensland University of Technology, and then began practising as a lawyer.

Prior to his election to parliament, Beattie was a solicitor of the Supreme Court of Queensland and secretary of the Railway Station Officers&#x27; Union.

==Pre-parliamentary career==
In 1974, he joined the Australian Labor Party, which had been in opposition for 17 years and had just suffered the worst defeat in its history at the hands of the dominant National Party Premier, Joh Bjelke-Petersen.

In the 1980 federal election, Beattie was the Labor candidate for the federal Division of Ryan and was defeated by the Liberal incumbent John Moore, but achieving a 3 per cent two-party preferred swing in the process. He only nominated for Ryan to give him the right to appeal to the National Executive of the ALP from a six-month suspension from the Queensland ALP for criticising the state parliamentary party for incompetence.

Beattie started a Reform Group within the ALP led by Dr Denis Murphy and himself to reform the Queensland branch of the party, which was dominated by elderly and conservative trade union leaders. In 1981 the federal Labor Party leader, Bill Hayden (himself a Queenslander), led a federal intervention in Queensland, and Beattie became Queensland State Secretary. Eight years later these reforms paved the way for the election of Wayne Goss when he became Queensland&#x27;s first Labor Premier since Vince Gair in 1957.

==Early parliamentary career (1989-1996)==
At the 1989 election Beattie was elected to the Queensland Parliament as MP for Brisbane Central. Something of a maverick within the parliamentary party during his early term, Beattie was opposed by old guard faction leaders and kept out of the ministry for his role as Parliamentary Chair of the Criminal Justice Committee. His main post was as chairman of the parliamentary committee overseeing the Criminal Justice Commission (now the Crime and Corruption Commission), a role in which he frequently took an independent stand against improper behaviour by supporting the CJC Commissioner Sir Max Bingham against the Goss government, earning Goss&#x27;s ire. Beattie also publicly criticised Goss for being out of touch. As a result, Goss did not appoint him to the ministry until Labor&#x27;s near defeat at the 1995 election, where Beattie became Minister for Health. He was only in office for six months before the Goss government lost office following defeat in the Mundingburra by-election.

Goss then stood down as ALP leader, and Beattie was elected in his stead unopposed, thus becoming Opposition Leader. His first act as Opposition leader was a tactical one, moving a motion in Parliament preventing the new Coalition government under Rob Borbidge from calling an early election. Labor was unpopular at the time and feared that an early election could give the Coalition an outright majority. The motion carried.

==Premier (1998-2007)==
At the 1998 state election, Labor won 44 seats out of 89, and was only denied a majority when One Nation won six seats that otherwise would have gone to Labor if not for leakage of Coalition preferences. The balance of power rested with two independents, Peter Wellington and Liz Cunningham, and the 11 One Nation MPs. Labor needed the support of only one crossbencher to make Beattie premier, while the Coalition needed them all for Borbidge to stay in office. After negotiations with Beattie, Wellington announced his support for Labor, allowing Beattie to form a minority government. Beattie said the ALP would govern as if it had a majority of ten.

A few months later, Charles Rappolt, the One Nation member for Mulgrave, abruptly resigned. Labor&#x27;s Warren Pitt, who had held the seat from 1989 to 1995, won the ensuing by-election, giving Beattie a majority in his own right. Pitt would have retaken his old seat a few months earlier, if not for Coalition preferences leaking to Rappolt.

Shortly before the 2001 election, he faced a crisis when a CJC inquiry - the Shepherdson inquiry - revealed that a number of MPs and party activists, including Deputy Premier Jim Elder, had been engaged in breaches of the Electoral Act by falsely enrolling people to boost their faction&#x27;s strength in internal party ballots. Former ALP state secretary and newly elected MP Mike Kaiser, as well as a senior adviser to Wayne Goss had been falsely enrolled some years earlier as part of a factional battle. Beattie acted swiftly, forcing Elder and several other MPs to quit politics and to leave the ALP. In the ensuing campaign, Beattie claimed a Labor win would ensure stable government. He argued the only alternative was a Coalition government propped up by One Nation and former One Nation MPs—an argument that gained particular resonance when Borbidge&#x27;s own party room reneged on Borbidge&#x27;s promise not to preference One Nation. Beattie was rewarded with a smashing victory, winning 66 seats out of 89—the biggest majority Labor has ever won in an election. It also took all but one seat in Brisbane. The Liberal Party ended up with only three seats in parliament.

Beattie&#x27;s key agenda was to transform Queensland into Australia&#x27;s &quot;Smart State&quot; by restructuring the economy and reforming the education system, skilling the workforce and encouraging innovation, research and development and high tech biotechnology, information technology and aviation industries to locate in Queensland including Virgin airlines. In 2003, the Premier was awarded an honorary doctorate of science from the University of Queensland &quot;in recognition of his leadership and commitment to higher education through Smart State initiatives and his support for research in the fields of biotechnology and nanotechnology&quot;.

===2004 state election===
Beattie&#x27;s government drove an innovation agenda in new industries which reduced Queensland&#x27;s unemployment level below its target of 5%. In February 2004 Beattie again went to the polls but a crisis blew up shortly before the election, with a highly critical report on the state of Queensland&#x27;s system of child protection. Beattie accepted full personal responsibility for the issue, and paradoxically turned the issue into a positive for the government. At the 7 February elections Beattie won 63 seats, a net loss of only three, losing four seats to the National-Liberal Opposition but gaining one from them. This made him one of the most successful state politicians in Australian history.

===2005 and 2006 Queensland Health crisis===

Having delivered on his Smart State Strategy, the Beattie government was riding high in public support. However, in the latter part of 2005, Beattie faced potentially his most serious political crisis: the revelations and inquiries into Queensland Health and the Bundaberg public hospital after Jayant Patel, an Indian-born surgeon who performed several botched operations, some of which resulted in death, fled the country to the United States, where he had previously been struck off the register. As was his style, Beattie faced the crisis head on. Amid the controversy and evidence at an Inquiry established by the Beattie government, the health minister Gordon Nuttall resigned his portfolio, the Speaker, Ray Hollis, resigned after controversy associated with his use of Parliamentary expenditure, and the Deputy Premier and Treasurer, Terry Mackenroth, retired, forcing by-elections in the safe Labor seats of Redcliffe and Chatsworth on 20 August. Labor suffered major swings against it and both seats were lost to the Liberal Party, the first serious electoral setback for Beattie since becoming Premier.

Following the retirement of the Premier of New South Wales, Bob Carr in 2005, Beattie became the longest-serving state Premier among his contemporaries.

===2006 state election===
Beattie went on to win the September 2006 election convincingly in a third landslide, with a slight swing towards the ALP in terms of its primary vote, and two party preferred result. The Government even won back the two seats of Redcliffe and Chatsworth it had lost in the recent by elections. Coalition Opposition Leader Lawrence Springborg stepped down. Before the election Liberal Leader Bob Quinn was forced by his party colleagues to step down a fortnight before polling day. The campaign of Quinn&#x27;s replacement Dr Bruce Flegg was characterized by inexperience and indecisiveness and lacked an organised, professional approach. Premier Beattie therefore was never challenged by the opposition and was able to secure a fourth consecutive term in office with another landslide victory. This result puts Beattie in the realm of iconic political figures. He is the only state Labor leader since Neville Wran, NSW Labor Premier from 1976 to 1986, to do so and is Queensland&#x27;s fourth longest serving Premier after Labor&#x27;s William Forgan Smith (1932–1942), the Country Party&#x27;s Frank Nicklin (1957–1968) and National Party Premier Sir Joh Bjelke-Petersen (1968–1987).

==Retirement==
Beattie announced on 10 September 2007 his decision to retire from politics. His resignation as Premier officially took effect on 13 September 2007. At the time of his retirement, he was the longest-serving state premier in the country. Beattie had groomed his deputy Anna Bligh to be his successor for some time and the Labor caucus elected Anna Bligh as its leader on 12 September. In 2009, Anna Bligh led her party to a state election victory, thereby becoming the first Australian female to be popularly elected as state premier in Queensland.

He officially stood down as the Member for Brisbane Central on 14 September 2007. Beattie then served as Queensland&#x27;s Trade Commissioner to North and South America based in Los Angeles, a position he was appointed to by Anna Bligh in March 2008.

In late May 2010 Beattie announced that he was retiring from his position as Queensland&#x27;s Los Angeles-based trade and investment commissioner. to take up an appointment in the US. In June 2010 it was announced that he had accepted a position with Clemson University in South Carolina. On 24 August 2011, the Gillard government appointed Beattie as Australia&#x27;s first Resources Sector Supplier Envoy charged with promoting a Buy Australian at Home and Abroad program for supplying products to the Australian resources industry.

==Federal politics==

Beattie&#x27;s popularity often led to speculation that he would enter national politics, particularly after federal Labor&#x27;s defeat at the 2001 federal election. But Beattie resisted such suggestions, saying that he loved Queensland too much to leave, and anyway Canberra was &quot;too cold&quot;. On announcing his retirement he again ruled out a move to federal politics, saying that he would, politically speaking, disappear.

However, in August 2013, Beattie announced his intention to run in the 2013 federal election in the Queensland federal seat of Forde following an approach by Prime Minister Rudd to Beattie who was then living in New York. The ALP was in electoral trouble and Beattie was convinced to run to save Queensland seats. Following the ALP&#x27;s disastrous national campaign, Beattie was defeated by incumbent Liberal National Party MP Bert van Manen.

==Media involvement==
Beattie&#x27;s description by Liberal Leader Dr David Watson as a &quot;media tart&quot; as well as his political successes have led to a love-hate relationship with &quot;The Courier-Mail&quot;, Brisbane&#x27;s daily newspaper. Columnist Peter Wear, for example, ran a long-running satire on Queensland politics in general with the major role played by &quot;President for Life Mbeattie&quot;.
The controversy over the performance of the government-owned electricity supplier Energex during the severe 2003-2004 storm season in South East Queensland resulted in the characterisation of Beattie as &quot;Power Point Pete&quot; by &quot;Courier-Mail&quot; cartoonist Sean Leahy, with the location of the drawing&#x27;s eyes and nose designed to replicate the holes of a power point.

In August 2007 the Beattie government proposed to reduce the number of councils from 154 to 72, which would result in the merger of a number of regional and extra-metropolitan councils into larger Regional Councils. This proved particularly unpopular in the affected Councils as several hundred local politicians lost their positions.

===Autobiography===
In May 2005 Beattie released his autobiography &quot;Making A Difference&quot;, in which he described his upbringing, political life and his views on key issues, including health, education and social reform. The book is part memoir, part manifesto. Beattie says that the reason he released the book while he is in office, rather than when he is retired, is because no-one would want to read about him if he was not in the public arena. It was Beattie&#x27;s third book after his autobiographical piece &quot;In the Arena&quot; (1990) and the thriller &quot;The Year of the Dangerous Ones&quot;. Beattie wrote a fourth book &quot;Where to from here Australia?&quot; published in 2016.

=== Personal collection ===
Peter Beattie donated his personal collection of records to the State Library of Queensland&#x27;s John Oxley Library. The papers cover the years between 1955 and 2010 and include photographs, correspondence, diaries, political ephemera, speeches, clippings and other material relating to his time as a solicitor and politician. In 2019 the State Library produced a digital story with Peter Beattie. The interview by Peter Shooter covers the events leading up to the reform of the Queensland Labor Party, and focuses on those events which have contributed most significantly to Queensland&#x27;s historical record and on Peter Beattie&#x27;s achievements in government.

===Political commentator===
Beattie joined Sky News Live as a commentator across multiple programs in February 2015. Beattie began co-hosting his own TV program with Peter Reith in April 2016 which continued with former Queensland Premier Campbell Newman in 2017 until May, 2018 when Beattie retired from Sky News to focus on his position of Chair of the ARLC. Beattie was a regular political election commentator on Channels 9 and 7 from 2007 to 2015 and a regular Columnists for The Australian Newspaper from 2010 to 2015.

==Sporting interests==

In May 2016, Premier Annastacia Palaszczuk appointed Beattie chairman of the challenged Gold Coast Commonwealth Games Corporation, the organising committee for the 2018 Commonwealth Games. It was criticised by the Queensland Opposition as a political appointment but well received by the Commonwealth Games Federation. The Games were highly successful and regarded as the best games ever, however, organisers received criticism after broadcasters failed to show footage of the athletes entering the stadium for the closing ceremony, broadcasting &quot;My Kitchen Rules&quot; instead. To avoid any blame games Beattie accepted responsibility, publicly apologised and described it as &quot;clearly a stuff-up&quot;.

Beattie was appointed to the board of the Australian Rugby League Commission (ARLC) on 25 July 2017, as an independent commissioner. In February 2018, he was appointed chairman of the commission in place of John Grant. He is a supporter of reforming the organisation&#x27;s constitution to give National Rugby League (NRL) teams and state organisations direct representation on the board. As Chair of the ARLC, Beattie brought in major reforms including a new &quot;No Fault&quot; stand down rule for players charged with serious offences and ended the battles between the ARLC and the Clubs. He is also a strong supporter of the Magic Round pioneered in Brisbane in May, 2019 and expanding Women&#x27;s rugby league and rugby league in PNG, Fiji and the Pacific Nations.

==Honours==
On 1 January 2001, Beattie was awarded the Centenary Medal for his contribution to Queensland. On 11 June 2012, Beattie was named a Companion of the Order of Australia for &quot;eminent service to the Parliament and community of Queensland, through initiatives in the area of education and training, economic development, particularly in biotechnology, information technology and aviation industries, and to the promotion of international trade.&quot;. Beattie has been awarded five honorary doctorates, from The University of Queensland, Griffith University, QUT, Bond University and in the US an honorary Doctor of Laws from University of South Carolina. Beattie won the first Biotechnology Industry Organisation&#x27;s inaugural &quot;International Award for Leadership Excellence&quot; in 2008.

==Personal life==
Peter is married to Heather Beattie, a former professor of nursing. She was briefly involved in Brisbane City Council politics in her own capacity in 2012. The Beatties have three adult children. Peter is an Anglican, and his wife is the daughter of an Anglican clergyman.

<text>Bondi Beach () is a popular beach and the name of the surrounding suburb in Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. Bondi Beach is located east of the Sydney central business district, in the local government area of Waverley Council, in the Eastern Suburbs. In the 2021 Australian census it had a population of 11,513 residents. Its postcode is 2026. Bondi, North Bondi and Bondi Junction are neighbouring suburbs. Bondi Beach is one of the most visited tourist sites in Australia, and the location of two hit TV series &quot;Bondi Rescue&quot; and &quot;Bondi Vet&quot;.

== History ==

Before the arrival of Europeans in the Port Jackson area, the Waverley and Bondi areas were inhabited for tens of thousands of years by Aboriginal Australian peoples, who left evidence of their habitation in the form of paths, rock carvings, artefacts, and shelters. The eastern beaches were home to the Bidjigal, Birrabirragal, and Gadigal people. The name &quot;Bondi&quot; is derived from the Dharawal language, spoken by the Aboriginal clans who lived further from Sydney Harbour southwards to Shoalhaven. The word &quot;Bondi&quot;, also spelt &quot;Bundi&quot;, &quot;Bundye&quot;, and &quot;Boondye&quot;, originates from the word for a loud thud, such as the sound of waves breaking over rocks, but is also associated with &quot;nulla nulla&quot;, or fighting sticks, which make a loud noise when they hit something. The first record of &quot;bondi&quot; by European-ancestry Australians was made between 1899 and 1903. 

In 1809 the road builder William Roberts received a grant of land in the area. In 1851 Edward Smith Hall and Francis O&#x27;Brien purchased of the Bondi area that included most of the beach frontage, which was named &quot;The Bondi Estate&quot;. Hall was O&#x27;Brien&#x27;s father-in-law. Between 1855 and 1877 O&#x27;Brien purchased his father-in-law&#x27;s share of the land, renamed the land the &quot;O&#x27;Brien Estate,&quot; and made the beach and the surrounding land available to the public as a picnic ground and amusement resort. As the beach became increasingly popular, O&#x27;Brien threatened to stop public beach access. However, the Municipal Council believed that the Government needed to intervene to make the beach a public reserve. In mid-1882, Bondi Beach became a public beach. The first tramway to the beach was established in 1884. The Waverley Council was responsible for building the first surf bathing sheds on the beach in 1903. By 1929 an estimated 60,000 people were visiting the beach on a summer weekend day. The opening of the pavilion in the same year attracted a huge crowd of 200,000. 

On 6 February 1938 five people drowned and over 250 people were rescued or resuscitated after a series of large waves struck the beach and pulled people wading on a sandbank into the sea, a day that became known as &quot;Black Sunday&quot;.

Bondi Beach was a working-class suburb throughout most of the twentieth century with migrant people from New Zealand comprising the majority of the local population. Following World War II, Bondi Beach, and the Eastern Suburbs became home to Jewish migrants from Poland, Russia, Hungary, Czechoslovakia, and Germany. A stream of Jewish immigration continued into the 21st century and the area has some synagogues and a kosher butcher. 
The multicultural migration funded and drove the growth of the suburb throughout the 1990s into the turn of the century, moving it steadily from its working-class roots towards an upper/middle-class enclave similar to its neighbours of Rose Bay and Bellevue Hill which was listed as the most expensive postcode in the country from 2003 to 2005.

Bondi Beach was long a centre for efforts to fight indecency in beach attire. The beach was a focal point of the 1907 Sydney bathing costume protests, organised to oppose proposed dress standards for beachgoers. The Local Government Act, Ordinance No. 52 (1935) governed the decency of swimming costumes and was in force between 1935 and 1961, and resulted in public controversy as the two-piece &quot;bikini&quot; became popular after World War II. Waverley Council&#x27;s beach inspectors, including the Aub Laidlaw, were responsible for enforcing the law and were required to measure the dimensions of swimwear and order offenders against public decency off the beach. While vacationing in Australia in 1951, American movie actress Jean Parker made international headlines when she was escorted off the beach after Laidlaw determined her bikini was too skimpy. The rule became increasingly anachronistic during the 1950s and was replaced in 1961 with one requiring bathers be &quot;clad in a proper and adequate bathing costume&quot;, allowing for more subjective judgment of decency. By the 1980s topless bathing had become common at Bondi Beach, especially at the southern end.

Sydney&#x27;s Water Board maintained an untreated sewage outlet not far from the north end of the beach until the 1960s when a sewage treatment plant was built. In the mid-1990s the plant was upgraded &amp; a deepwater ocean outfall was completed to meet water quality standards.

In March 2007, Waverley Council started proceedings to evict a hermit who was living in squalor on a cliff overlooking the beach. Peter James Paul Millhouse, calling himself Jhyimy &quot;Two Hats&quot; Mhiyles, came to the beach during the 2000 Sydney Olympic Games and became a local celebrity for his lifestyle and poetry recitals to visitors. Residents and tourists put together a &quot;save the caveman&quot; petition to allow him to continue residing but under certain rules. In 2009, he was arrested and charged for the rape of a tourist. While he was in custody, Waverley Council under then-mayor Liberal Sally Betts removed his belongings from the cliff. In September 2011, charges against Jhyimy were dropped by the Director of Public Prosecutions over concerns of the reliability of the witness. Waverley Council has not offered recompense for his eviction from his home or loss of belongings.

In March 2020, the Government of New South Wales closed Bondi Beach after several people there exceeded Australia&#x27;s outdoor-gathering limit imposed to slow the spread of the coronavirus in New South Wales.

== Heritage listings ==
Bondi Beach has several heritage-listed sites, including:
* 20 Hall Street: Bondi Beach Post Office
* Queen Elizabeth Drive: Bondi Beach Cultural Landscape

Bondi Beach was added to the Australian National Heritage List in 2008.

==Overview==

Bondi Beach is about long and receives many visitors throughout the year. Surf Life Saving Australia gave different hazard ratings to areas of Bondi Beach in 2004. While the northern end has been rated a gentle 4 (with 10 as the most hazardous), the southern side is rated as a 7 due to a famous rip current known as the &quot;Backpackers&#x27; Rip&quot; because of its proximity to the bus stop. Many backpackers and tourists do not realise that the flat, smooth water is a dangerous rip current, and tourists can be unwilling to walk the length of the beach for safer swimming. The south end of the beach is generally reserved for surfboard riding. Yellow and red flags define safe swimming areas, and visitors are advised to swim between them.

There is an underwater shark net; however, it does not stretch the entire beach, it is made up of overlapping sections. Many other beaches along the same stretch of the coast have similar shark nets. Pods of whales and dolphins have been sighted in the bay during the months of migration (March-May, September–November). Fairy penguins, while uncommon, are sometimes also seen swimming close to shore or amongst surfers in southern line-ups.

In 2007, the Guinness World Record for the largest swimsuit photo shoot was set at Bondi Beach, with 1,010 women wearing bikinis taking part.

In 2011, Waverley Council implemented Wi-Fi for Bondi Beach users. Service is free with limits on access periods and downloads per use. The cost of setup was estimated to be between $34,000 and $50,000 with annual costs of $25,000. Local businesses as well as The Bondi Chamber of Commerce supported the notion that locals and visitors can connect with local businesses, events, and other community and council events. In 2012 the Mayor of Waverley Sally Betts said that for the 2 million visitors annually, Wi-Fi offers access to local events and business information.

==Sport and recreation==
Bondi Beach is represented in one of the most popular sporting competitions across Australia, the National Rugby League competition, by the local team the Sydney Roosters, officially the Eastern Suburbs District Rugby League Football Club (ESDRLFC).

Bondi Beach is the end point of the City to Surf Fun Run which is held each year in August. The race attracts over 63,000 entrants who complete the run from the Sydney central business district to Bondi Beach. Other annual activities at Bondi Beach include Flickerfest, Australia&#x27;s premier international short film festival in January, World Environment Day in June, Sculpture by the Sea in November, and the Winter Magic Festival that attracted 60,000 visitors in 2016. In addition to many activities, the Bondi Beach Markets is open every Sunday, and a food market every Saturday, at Bondi Beach Public School. Many Irish and British tourists spend Christmas Day at the beach.

An Oceanway connects Bondi to South Head to the north and other beaches to the south up to Coogee.
Bondi Beach hosted the beach volleyball competition at the 2000 Summer Olympics. A temporary 10,000-seat stadium, a much smaller stadium, 2 warm-up courts, and 3 training courts were set up to host the tournament.

===Lifesaving clubs===

Bondi Surf Bathers&#x27; Life Saving Club claims to be the world&#x27;s first surf lifesaving club, and North Bondi Surf Life Saving Club is a federation club. Both clubs were founded in 1907. Bondi members invented the surf reel and many other icons of lifesaving. Surf lifesavers from both clubs were involved in the largest rescue ever on a single day, known as &#x27;Black Sunday&#x27;. Bondi holds the most Australian Surf Lifesaving Championship gold medals in R&amp;R (rescue &amp; resuscitation) and North Bondi holds the most gold medals in March Past.

===Bondi Icebergs===

The Bondi Icebergs Swimming Club origin dates back to 1929 and owes its origins to the desire of a band of dedicated local lifesavers who wished to maintain their fitness during the winter months. They formed the Bondi Icebergs Winter Swimming Club drew up a constitution and elected office bearers. Included in the constitution was a rule that to maintain membership it was mandatory that swimmers compete on three Sundays out of four each month for five years.

=== Bondi Skate Park ===
The Bondi Skate Park opened to the public in 1991 with only two skate ramps. In 2004, the council sought consultation with the skating community for input on how best to upgrade the site. The end result was the construction of a bowl with a deep end and a shallow end, rated 4 out of 5 stars by Skateboard Australia. The bowl was designed by Chad Ford and built by the company Zalem. The park has been hosting BOWL-A-RAMA, an international skating competition, since 2004;.

==Commercial area==
Bondi Beach has a commercial area along Campbell Parade and adjacent side streets, featuring many popular cafes, restaurants, and hotels, with views of the beach. Pacific Bondi Beach is a shopping centre that features Woolworths Metro, QT Hotel and 22 stores. It was built on the old Swiss Grand Hotel. 

The Hotel Bondi is a landmark on Campbell Parade. It was built from 1915 to the 1920s and was designed by E. Lindsay Thompson. It combines Italianate, Federation and Free Classical elements and has been described as an &quot;important landmark building in the Bondi Beach townscape.&quot; It has a state heritage listing. The Beach Road Hotel, originally opened in 1956 and was formerly The Regis and before that The Rex, is on the corner of Glenayr Avenue and Beach Road.

<doc id="368568" wikidata="Q1866414" url="?curid=368568" title="Morecambe Bay">
<text>Morecambe Bay is an estuary in north-west England, just to the south of the Lake District National Park. It is the largest expanse of intertidal mudflats and sand in the United Kingdom, covering a total area of . In 1974, the second largest gas field in the UK was discovered west of Blackpool, with original reserves of over 7 trillion cubic feet (tcf) (200 billion cubic metres). At its peak, 15% of Britain&#x27;s gas supply came from the bay but production is now in decline. Morecambe Bay is also an important wildlife site, with abundant birdlife and varied marine habitats.

==Natural features==

The rivers Leven, Kent, Keer, Lune and Wyre drain into the Bay, with their various estuaries making a number of peninsulas within the bay. Much of the land around the bay is reclaimed, forming salt marshes used in agriculture. The bay is known for its wildlife populations, being a Special Area of Conservation, Special Protection Area and a Site of Special Scientific Interest, and there is a bird observatory at Walney Island. Some of the surrounding land is also a protected area, forming the Morecambe Bay Pavements, home to rare butterflies such as the high brown fritillary. The bay has rich cockle beds, which have been fished by locals for generations. 

There are seven main islands in the bay, all to the west; Walney, Barrow, Sheep, Piel, Chapel, Foulney and Roa. Walney is substantially larger than the others, with its southern tip marking the north-western corner of the Bay. Sheep, Piel, Chapel and Foulney Islands are tidal and can be walked to at low tide with appropriate care. Local guidance should be sought if walking to Chapel or Piel islands as fast tides and quicksand can be extremely dangerous. Roa Island is linked to the mainland by a causeway, while Barrow Island has been connected to the mainland as part of the docks system at Barrow-in-Furness.

==History==

The extensive sandflats are the remains of a vast sandur or outwash plain established by meltwaters as the last ice age waned. Sea-level was still some 3m below present day levels at the start of the Holocene some 11,000 years ago.

The Greek geographer and astronomer Claudius Ptolemy (died c170 AD) referred in his writings to &quot;Morikambe eischusis&quot; as a location on Britain&#x27;s west coast, lying between the Ribble and the Solway. The sixteenth-century scholar William Camden identified the locality as being near Silloth, hence the similar name of that bay but the eighteenth century antiquarian John Horsley who translated Ptolemy into English in 1732 favoured it being the bay on the then Lancashire—Cumberland border. In 1771 historian John Whitaker took up this latter suggestion and the name appeared on maps subsequently. The first recorded to do so being one associated with Father Thomas West&#x27;s &quot;Antiquities of Furness&quot; of 1774. Camden believed the name originated with two words meaning &quot;crooked sea&quot; whilst West offered up &quot;white/beautiful haven&quot; though current thought is that it refers to a &quot;curve of the sea&quot;.

The bay has quicksand and fast moving tides. There have been royally appointed local guides (holding the post of King&#x27;s Guide to the Sands) for crossing the bay for centuries; appointment of guides is now delegated to a trust. This difficulty of crossing the bay added to the isolation of the land to its north which, due to the presence of the mountains of the Lake District, could only be reached by crossing these sands or by ferry, until the Furness Railway was built in 1857. This skirts the edge of the bay, crossing the various estuaries. The London-Glasgow railway also briefly runs alongside the baythe only place where the West Coast Main Line actually runs alongside the coast.

The dangers presented by the bay were demonstrated in the 2004 Morecambe Bay cockling disaster when 23 undocumented immigrants from China were drowned by an incoming tide, after being cut off while harvesting cockles. Criminal prosecution of the gangmaster and his associates for manslaughter and aiding immigration offences resulted in terms of imprisonment. These events were covered in a drama film and a non-fiction documentary. The incident has had a lasting effect on the community and estuary harvesting regulations.

Morecambe Bay is also home to several of the UK&#x27;s offshore wind farms: West of Duddon Sands, Burbo Bank, Walney, Barrow, and Ormonde.

==Population==
Around 320,000 people live along the coastline of Morecambe Bay, with the largest town being Barrow-in-Furness to the west. Morecambe was once a popular seaside holiday destination, whilst Barrow still relies on the seas for a large percentage of its economy in ship and submarine construction.

==Natural gas==

The bay has Britain&#x27;s second-largest natural gas field, in the Triassic Sherwood Sandstone with a seal of Mercia Mudstone and a Carboniferous source. The South Morecambe Field, covering an area of , was discovered in 1974 and the first gas came ashore in 1985. The North Morecambe Field, found in 1976, to the north, is and started production in 1994. Both are operated by Centrica Energy. They are west of Blackpool in 30 metres of water; the top of the gas reservoir is at a depth of just , necessitating slant drilling for the first time in European waters. The combined gas reserves on discovery were estimated at 179 billion cubic metres (6.45 trillion cubic feet (tcf)). A further 0.65tcf is recognised in the satellite fields of Bains, Calder (Rivers), Dalton, Millom East and Millom West, and a number of smaller fields have been identified.

The gas is landed at three terminals at Westfield Point in Barrow-in-Furness, collectively referred to as the Rampside Gas Terminal. The South Morecambe Central Processing Complex is connected via a 36-inch pipeline to the South Morecambe terminal. North Morecambe gas has a different composition so the unmanned Drilling and Production Platform is linked by a separate 36&quot; wet sealine to the North Morecambe Terminal, where it is stripped of water, CO2 and nitrogen. The Rivers Terminal has a dedicated pipeline for sour gas from the Calder field, which must be stripped of hydrogen sulphide before processing by the North Morecambe Terminal. The hydrogen sulphide is converted to sulphuric acid which is sold for industrial use. In 1991 a 229 MW CCGT power plant was opened near the terminals, on the site of the former coal-fired Roosecote Power Station. There is a support base at Heysham Port and personnel are typically moved by helicopter from Blackpool International Airport. Five rig workers and the two pilots of a Eurocopter AS365 Dauphin were lost when it crashed in sight of the platform on 27 December 2006.

At peak production 15% of UK supply came from the two main fields. As of 2006 Centrica reckoned there was about 1.2tcf of economic gas remaining in them, and they planned to operate the fields for another 10–15 years. In June 2011 they announced the South Morecambe field would be suspended as a result of tax increases in the 2011 Budget which meant South Morecambe would be paying a rate of 81% tax; North Morecambe and Rivers would continue in production as they are taxed at 62%. Production resumed from the South Morecambe field in July 2011.

==Bridge and tidal barrage proposal==
In 2004, a proposal was made to build a bridge across the bay flanked by wind turbines and using tidal power. Proposals from &quot;Northern Tidal Power Gateways&quot; in 2019 outlined a tidal barrage with a road running along on top.

==Media==
* A brief article by David Cawley on the Morecambe Bay tidal crossing appeared in the September 2005 issue of &quot;Hidden Europe&quot; magazine.
* A fictionalised account of the Morecambe Bay cockling disaster was made into a 2006 drama film &quot;Ghosts&quot; by documentary maker Nick Broomfield; Channel 4&#x27;s documentary series &quot;The Other Side&quot; commissioned a factual work from a local Cumbrian filmmaker on the same events.
* The crime drama television series &quot;The Bay&quot; is set in and around Morecambe Bay, and derives its name from the location. Location filming for the series was shot around the area.
* A book about the bay, &quot;The Gathering Tide: A Journey Around the Edgelands of Morecambe Bay&quot; (2016) by environmentalist Karen Lloyd, is a memoir of a year spent walking the coast, involving social history, archaeology and local wildlife.

<doc id="368569" wikidata="Q21946958" url="?curid=368569" title="Hume Dam">
<text>Hume Dam, formerly the Hume Weir, is a major dam across the Murray River downstream of its junction with the Mitta River in the Riverina region of New South Wales, Australia. The dam&#x27;s purpose includes flood mitigation, hydro-power, irrigation, water supply and conservation. The impounded reservoir is called Lake Hume, formerly the Hume Reservoir. It is a gated concrete gravity dam with four earth embankments and twenty-nine vertical undershot gated concrete overflow spillways.

The dam is part of the Engineering Works of the River Murray that are listed as a National Engineering Landmark by Engineers Australia, as part of its Engineering Heritage Recognition Program.

==Location==
Constructed over a 17-year period between 1919 and 1936, the Hume Dam is located approximately east of the city of Albury. The dam was built, involving a workforce of thousands, by a consortium of NSW and Victorian government agencies that included the Water Resources Commission of New South Wales, the Public Works Department of New South Wales, and the State Rivers and Water Supply Commission of Victoria. 

Supplies to the construction site were delivered via rail, through the construction of a branch siding from the Wodonga – Cudgewa railway. Hume Dam is jointly managed by Victorian and New South Wales authorities on behalf of the Murray-Darling Basin Authority. Goulburn-Murray Water manages water and land located in Victoria, and the New South Wales State Water Corporation is responsible for day-to-day operation and maintenance and the management of major remedial works at the dam.

==Description==
The dam is a mix of a concrete gravity dam with four earth embankments. The dam wall height is . The crest is long, with the auxiliary embankments extending a further . The maximum water elevation above sea level is . At 100% capacity the dam wall holds back of water at AHD.

The surface area of Lake Hume is . The catchment area is . The dam wall is constructed of rock covered with clay and other earth and is designed to carry vehicular traffic. A controlled concrete spillway has a gated concrete overflow, with twenty-nine vertical undershot gates, is capable of discharging .

Water is retained nearly upstream of the reservoir in the valleys of both the Murray and Mitta Mitta rivers.

The dam wall was extended during the 1950s, and completed in 1961, necessitating the wholesale removal of Tallangatta township and its re-establishment at a new site west of the original, as well as the raising of the Bethanga Bridge. Monitoring of the dam in the early 1990s revealed that the water pressure and leakage had caused the dam to move on its foundations slightly, leading to concerns that the dam was heading for collapse, threatening Albury-Wodonga and the entire Murray basin. Authorities denied any short-term threat. 

Traffic was banned from the spillway, and remedial work began involving, in part, the construction of a secondary earth wall behind the original to take the strain. Further upgrades to the dam at an estimated cost of A$60 million began in 2007 and were completed in 2013. These works include the installation of an improved filter and drainage system on the junction between the concrete spillway and southern embankment, construction of a concrete buttress on the southern training wall, and possible modifications to improve the ability of the dam to manage extreme floods.

==Power station==

The Hume Power Station is a hydro-electric power station installed in the dam wall, and is primarily used for peak-load generation. The station has an average annual output of . The power station has two turbines and is operated by Meridian Energy. In October 2012, a high voltage transformer at the power station caught fire, requiring more than fifty fire fighters who worked into the long hours of the night to put the blaze out.

The power station was completed in 1957, running two turbines. In 2000, these turbines were each upgraded to .

==Etymology==
Originally named the Mitta Mitta Dam site, following representations from the Municipal Council of Albury, on 17 February 1920 the River Murray Commission decided to honour Hamilton Hume, who, in company with William Hovell, was one of the first Europeans to see and cross the Murray River in 1824. In 1920, the reservoir was named the Hume Reservoir and the dam adopted the name of the Hume Weir, the name given by the Victorian Place Names Committee. Following a proposal from Hume Shire Council, in 1996 both the NSW and Victorian governments agreed that the dam should be named the Hume Dam, and the reservoir be named Lake Hume.

==Lake Hume==

Lake Hume is estimated to hold approximately six times the volume of water in Sydney Harbour. The small towns of Tallangatta, Bonegilla and Bellbridge are located on the shores of Lake Hume. The reservoir is often referred to as the Hume Weir, and was named Lake Hume in the mid-1980s.

===Reservoir levels===
Lake Hume was the furthest upstream of the major reservoirs on the Murray River system, before the Dartmouth Dam was built further up the Mitta Mitta River to provide improved buffering during prolonged dry spells. The Hume Dam has the capacity to release water at the fastest rate. Irrigation authorities use the reservoir as the storage of first resort. Typically, the reservoir had fallen to less than one-third of its capacity by March each year. In normal years, it refills to at least two-thirds of its capacity before November.

Australia&#x27;s highly unpredictable climatic conditions cause those norms to vary quite significantly from year to year. In 2007, during the Millennium Drought, Lake Hume fell to 1% capacity, barely more than the water in the Murray and Mitta Mitta rivers flowing through on their original paths. Between 2010 and April 2013, the lowest storage level was in the range of .

===Recreation===
The lake is stocked with fish. Most of these are introduced species – carp, redfin and trout though native species such as Golden Perch and Murray Cod can also be found. The fishing varies from year to year. It is also popular for water skiing, and several holiday resorts catering for fishing and skiers are dotted around the upper reaches of the lake. An annual Canoe marathon race the &#x27;Frank Harrison Classic&#x27; is run on the river beginning below the dam each February and attracts competitors from across Australia.

====Sailing on Hume Dam====
In 1958, a group of enthusiastic sailors established a Sailing Club and started to run regular regattas.

The sailing club has since grown and is now known as the Albury Wodonga Yacht Club (AWYC). The club offers sail training for children and adults, and regular weekend racing. Once a year, on the first weekend in November, AWYC runs SailCountry, a large regatta which attracts entrants from all over Australia.

==Impact on the ecology of the Murray River==
The construction of Hume Dam has caused significant changes to the flow patterns and ecology of the Murray River. Before the construction of the Hume Weir, flows in normal, non-drought years were low in summer and autumn, though still significant overall, rising in winter due to seasonal rainfall and reaching a flood-peak in late spring due to snow-melt in the Murray and its tributaries&#x27; alpine headwaters. The flow is now effectively reversed, with low flows in winter and sustained, relatively high flows in late spring, summer and early autumn to meet irrigation demands. The spring flood peak has been virtually eliminated.

The water released from the base of the Hume Weir is unnaturally cold, at least 10 °C (18 °F) colder than it naturally should be. This flow reversal, temperature depression, and removal of the spring flood peak, has led to the drying out and loss of many billabongs and has harmed the populations of native fish of the Murray River such as the iconic Murray Cod and the freshwater catfish, which can no longer be found downstream of the dam as far as Yarrawonga, where it had previously been recorded up until the 1960s.

==Hume Weir Football Club==
The Hume Weir FC was established in 1921, mainly from footballers working on the construction of the new weir. The club initially played in the Albury &amp; Border Football Association from 1921 to 1923, wearing black and white striped jumpers. Andrew Mafferzoni was the club&#x27;s initial coach in 1921 and they played at the &quot;Weir Ground&quot;. Hume Weir won the Albury &amp; Border FA premiership in 1922 and 1923.

In 1924, Hume Weir joined the Ovens and Murray Football League (O&amp;MFL) and played there until 1929. Percy Jones kicked 104 goals for Hume Weir in 1928 before being lured to Geelong in 1929. As part of being admitted into the O&amp;MFL in 1924, Hume Weir agreed to play their home games at the Wodonga Racecourse Oval. Hume Weir were runners up to Wangaratta in 1925 and were coached by Tim Archer. In 1927, Hume Weir played their home games at Wodonga Park.

In 1930, Hume Weir merged with Ebden Rovers Football Club to become the Weir United Football Club. Weir United won the 1930 and 1931 O&amp;MFL premierships.

In 1933, East Albury Football Club and Weir United Football Club merged to become the Border United Football Club (Albury based). They wore green and white jumpers. They played in and lost the 1933 O&amp;MFL grand final to Wangaratta. In 1935, they lost the O&amp;MFL grand final to Rutherglen.

In 1936, Border United FC (Albury based) merged with the Albury Football Club and became known as Albury FC.

Albury FC played in the 1937, 1939 and 1940 O&amp;MFL grand finals. Immediately after the World War II recess, Albury played in the 1946, 1947 and 1948 O&amp;MFL grand finals.

<text>James Larry Grantham (September 16, 1938 – June 17, 2017) was an American professional football player who was a linebacker for the New York Titans/Jets of the American Football League (AFL) and later National Football League (NFL). He played college football for the Ole Miss Rebels. He also played pro ball for the Florida Blazers of the World Football League (WFL).

==Early life==
Grantham was born in Crystal Springs, Mississippi. He was not initially on the radar for recruiting in football due to his size, which never got to over 195 pounds. It was an American Legion baseball game in 1956 where he played for Crystal Springs against Brookhaven that changed that idea. On a play at the plate where Brookhaven had Lance Alworth (a future star at Arkansas) on second base trying to run all the way to home on a bunt, Grantham dipped his shoulder and successfully blocked the plate. At the game that day was Tom Swayze and Buster Poole - the former was the head coach of the baseball team at the University of Mississippi and the latter was the assistant football coach. Grantham was signed to a baseball scholarship at Ole Miss and offered a tryout as a linebacker on the football team. In his sophomore year, he won a starting spot and lettered that season while also playing end on offense. His senior season was the famed 1959 squad that allowed just 21 points on defense while only losing to LSU. In the 1960 Sugar Bowl, he caught a touchdown pass, blocked a punt and had a team-leading nine tackles in the 21–0 victory over LSU as revenge for the previous 7–3 loss to them. Grantham was later named to the Ole Miss Athletic Hall of Fame.

==Pro career==
Grantham was drafted by the American Football League&#x27;s New York Titans in the 1960 college draft along with the Baltimore Colts in the 8th round. He chose to play with the Titans due to the fresh start presented by the newly formed league. He started as a wide receiver in training camp but quickly found an interest in linebacker due to his interest in hitting people. He helped form the backbone of a team (later rebranded as the New York Jets) with a defense that reached the playoffs in 1968 and 1969, and in 1968 captured the AFL Championship and the World Championship, over the NFL&#x27;s Baltimore Colts. Therein Grantham&#x27;s team, with him as a starter throughout, went from being the worst team in an upstart league (the AFL) to World Champions in just nine years.

From his right outside linebacker spot, Grantham wrought havoc on opposing offenses. He recorded 24 interceptions, with his most being five in 1960 and 1967. Unofficially, he also had 38.5 sacks in his career. In a ten-year span from his rookie year in 1960 to 1969, he was named an All-Pro eight times, with five of them being first-team, and he was named to the All-Star team five times. He was selected to the Second-team of the American Football League All-Time Team. In Super Bowl III, he was cited as a key part of calling defensive formations on the field in the stunning upset that the Jets would complete where they held Baltimore to no points until late in the fourth quarter of a 16–7 victory.

He is one of only twenty players to have competed in the American Football League for its entire ten-year existence, and one of only seven AFL players to have played their entire careers in one city. Grantham was also named the 1971 New York Jets MVP. Teammate Gerry Philbin, citing him as a leader, once said, &quot;pound for pound he was the best player on the Jets.”

He played one last season in 1974 for the Florida Blazers of the start-up World Football League. The Blazers made it to World Bowl 1, losing to the Birmingham Americans.

The Professional Football Researchers Association named Grantham to the PRFA Hall of Very Good Class of 2014.

==Personal life and death==
Grantham served as color analyst on radio broadcasts for the Jets after he retired, which lasted a year due to trouble with alcoholism, as he had been drinking on a significant basis since high school. He worked in public relations with First National Bank in Jackson, Mississippi after moving his family back to the state in 1975 and he later was a sideline commentator on Ole Miss radio broadcasts. His problems with alcohol led to a divorce in 1981 and two car accidents, with the latter seeing him charged with a DUI. He cited seeing his cellmates as an impetus to stop drinking for his grandchildren, and he soon checked into a recovery clinic. He was diagnosed with lymphoma in the late 2000s, with rising bills seeing him try to sell his Super Bowl ring to a memorabilia dealer in Las Vegas, but the dealer decided to send it back after hearing about Grantham&#x27;s story. The lymphoma was treated and later went in remission. In 2011, Grantham was inducted into the Jets Ring of Honor, which he called an &quot;unbelievable&quot; honor.

Grantham died on June 17, 2017, at the age of 78 from complications of chronic obstructive pulmonary disease. He was 78.

<text>Northallerton ( ) is a market town and civil parish in North Yorkshire, England. It is near the River Wiske in the Vale of Mowbray and had a population of 16,832 in 2011. Northallerton is an administrative centre for York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority and North Yorkshire Council.

There has been a settlement at Northallerton since Roman times. That grew in importance from the 11th century when King William II gifted land there to the Bishop of Durham, and it became an important religious centre. The Battle of the Standard fought nearby in 1138 involved the death of up to 12,000 Scots.

Northallerton was an important stopping point for coaches on the road between Edinburgh and London until the arrival of the railway.

== History ==

===Early===

Due to its proximity to a Roman road, entrenchments and relics, the earliest settlement at Northallerton was a Roman military station. There is evidence that the Romans had a signal station on Castle Hills just to the west of the town as part of the imperial Roman postal system and a path connecting Hadrian&#x27;s Wall with Eboracum (York) ran through what is now the neighbouring village of Brompton.

The first church was set up by St Paulinus of York on the site of the present All Saints Parish Church sometime in the early 7th century. It was made from wood and nothing survives of it. In 855 a stone church was built on the same site; fragments of stone have been found during restoration work which provide strong evidence of this Angle church.

It was believed that an Anglo-Saxon town known as &quot;Alvertune&quot; then developed. In Pierre de Langtoft&#x27;s history of King Alfred he writes that in 865 it was the site of a number of battles between King Elfrid and his brother Alfred on one side and five Danish kings and a similar number of earls. Later, in the 10th century, Danes settled at Romanby and Brompton. A fine example of English stonecarving from the period, the Brompton Hogbacks, can be found in Brompton Parish Church.

In the Domesday Survey, Norman scribes named the settlement &quot;Alvertune&quot;, &quot;Aluertune&quot; and &quot;Alretone&quot; and there is a reference to the &quot;Alvertune wapentac&quot;, an area almost identical to the Allertonshire wapentake of the North Riding, which was named after the town.

The origin of the town&#x27;s name is uncertain, though it is believed that the name derives from a derivation of the name &quot;Aelfere&quot;, Aelfereton translates as the farm belonging to Aelfere or even of King Alfred. Alternatively it may be referring to the Alder trees which grew nearby. The prefix of North was added in the 12th century to differentiate from the parish of Allerton Mauleverer, to the south.

Its position on a major route brought death and destruction to the town on many occasions. In 1069, in an attempt to quell rebellion in the north, the area between the Ouse and the Tyne was laid waste by the armies of William the Conqueror. The town of Northallerton was almost totally destroyed or depopulated. Just a few years later it is described in the Domesday Book as &quot;modo est in manu regis et wastum est&quot; (put down as waste).

=== Battle of the Standard ===


On 22 August 1138, English forces repelled a Scottish army on Cowton Moor in Brompton parish, around north of the town. This was the first major battle between the Scots and the English after the Norman conquest and one of the two major battles in the civil war between King Stephen and Empress Matilda. The English forces were summoned by Archbishop Thurstan of York, who had gathered local militia and baronial armies from Yorkshire and the North Midlands. They arrayed themselves round a chariot with a ship&#x27;s mast carrying the consecrated banners of St Peter of York, St John of Beverley, St Wilfrid of Ripon and St Cuthbert of Durham, it was this standard-bearing chariot that gave the battle its name.

King David had entered England in support of his niece, Empress Matilda, who was viewed as the rightful heiress to the English throne usurped by King Stephen. With Stephen fighting rebel barons in the south, the Scottish armies had already taken Cumberland and Northumberland, the city of Carlisle and the royal castle at Bamburgh. Finding the English in a defensive position on a hill, David elected to force a battle counting on his superior numbers, 16,000 Scots against 10,000 Englishmen. Repeated attacks by native Scots failed against the onslaught from the English archers, with losses of up to 12,000 Scots. A subsequent attack by mounted knights met initial success but fell back due to lack of infantry support. The battle ended when David&#x27;s reserve deserted, forcing him to retreat. The English elected not to pursue, and despite their great losses the Scots were able to regroup in sufficient number to besiege and capture Wark Castle. The victory by the English ensured the safety of Northern England.

===Religion===

Shortly after his accession William Rufus gave the town, with the lands adjacent, to the see of Durham, and, under the patronage of the bishops of that diocese, it grew in importance, and became an episcopal residence. In 1130 a castle was built on the west side of the town adjacent to North Beck by Bishop Rufus and was expanded in 1142 after William Cumin seized the Bishopric of Durham in 1141. The castle was further expanded in 1173 by Hugh Pudsey and garrisoned by a group of Flemish soldiers, an act which enraged King Henry II who ordered that it be razed to the ground in 1177. A more substantial fortified palace surrounded by a moat was built on the same site in 1199, replacing the traditional motte-and-bailey castle. The palace became an important administrative centre for the bishops&#x27; lands in Yorkshire and served as a major residence for the bishops and their staff. The palace lay on the main road from York to Durham and was a regular stopping place for royalty and other dignitaries. The palace fell into ruin by 1658 and the site is now a cemetery.

In 1318, the town was destroyed by the Scots, under Sir James Douglas following the Capture of Berwick upon Tweed. A Carmelite priory was founded in 1354, but was demolished soon after the dissolution of the monasteries in 1538. The site passed to various people and was used for arable farming before a workhouse was built on the site in 1857. Subsequently, the Friarage Hospital, which takes its name from the friary, was built.

Following development of the site in 2006, archaeologists uncovered the remains of eight monks along with other artefacts.

===Law and order===

A house of correction opened in 1783 on Priest Garth (land owned by the Bishop of Durham), beside what is now East Road. This became HM Prison Northallerton, which served (at different times) as an adult prison, a Young Offender Institution, and a military prison. The prison closed in 2013 and is now partially demolished. It once had the world&#x27;s largest treadmill. As of February 2021, the site of the former prison has two retail outlets, Iceland and Lidl situated on it.

The Quarter Sessions for the area were held in the town from the 17th century in various buildings including the Tollbooth, the Guild Hall and Vine House. In 1875, architect John Carr was commissioned to build a dedicated courthouse on Zetland Road, adjacent to the prison. When in 1856 the North Riding Constabulary was founded, one of the last county forces to be formed, Northallerton was selected as its headquarters. Initially it operated from a converted house beside the prison, moving to a purpose-built structure in 1880. Police HQ moved to nearby Racecourse Lane (the site of the former Northallerton horse-racing course) in 1910, with the court moving opposite it in 1936. The previous courthouse and police buildings were demolished in the 1990s. The court building on Racecourse Lane later housed the magistrates&#x27; court and coroner&#x27;s court.

When the Poor Law union system was introduced, a workhouse was established in the town to serve the three parishes in the area. This building is now part of the Friarage Hospital.

The Thirsk Road drill hall was opened in 1911, just before the First World War.

== Governance ==
The ancient parish of Northallerton covered a wide area including the townships and chapelries of Romanby, Brompton and Deighton, and the detached part of High Worsall on the River Tees. They became separate civil parishes in the 19th century.

The parish council of Northallerton is a town council and has 12 councillors, elected in four wards. The town council is based at Northallerton Town Hall.

Northallerton has been twinned with Ormesson-sur-Marne, a suburb of Paris, since 1994.
In 1889 the County of York, North Riding administrative county was formed. In 1894 it was divided into municipal boroughs, urban districts and rural districts. Following a review of local government in 1974, the North Riding was abolished as an administrative county. The district council of Hambleton was formed from the merger of Northallerton Urban District with Bedale Rural District, Easingwold Rural District, Northallerton Rural District, Thirsk Rural District and Croft Rural District. This became part of the non-metropolitan county of North Yorkshire.

Since 2023, North Yorkshire Council has provided both district-level and county-level services. York and North Yorkshire Combined Authority assumed its powers on 1 February 2024. The first Mayor of York and North Yorkshire will be elected in May 2024.

Northallerton was a parliamentary borough. Its first representatives were John le Clerk and Stephen Maunsell, who were elected to the parliament of King Edward I in 1298, but no subsequent return was made until 1640, when the privilege was resumed by order of the House of Commons. From 1640 to 1885, the town formed the parliamentary borough of Northallerton, returning two Members of Parliament (MPs) until the Great Reform Act of 1832. Under the Act, boundaries were extended to include Brompton and Romanby and representation was reduced to a single member.

In 1885 the constituency was abolished and absorbed into the Richmond division of the North Riding. The serving member for the Richmond constituency is Rishi Sunak of the Conservative Party, who has held the seat since 2015 when he succeeded former party leader and Foreign Secretary William Hague. Sunak served as Prime Minister between 2022 and 2024. In modern times it has been a safe seat for the Conservative Party, which has held it since 1929.

== Geography ==

=== Distance to other places ===

=== Topography ===

Northallerton lies north of the Vale of York in the Vale of Mowbray just south of County Durham. To the west are the Pennines, a range of hills that rise to around , and to the east are the North York Moors which rise to around . The proximity of these hills is significant in the climatology of the area. The River Wiske, a tributary of the River Swale passes to the west of the town. The Wiske is fed by Brompton Beck, Turker Beck, Willow Beck and North Beck all of which flow through the town. Although small in nature these have been the focus of flash flooding in Northallerton and in Brompton village in the 21st century.

=== Climate ===

According to the Köppen classification, the British Isles experience a maritime climate characterised by relatively cool summers and mild winters. Compared with other parts of the country, the Vale of York is slightly warmer and sunnier in the summer and colder and frostier in the winter. Owing to its inland position, and sheltered by the Pennines to the west, North Yorkshire is one of the driest counties in the UK, receiving, on average, around of rain per year. The mean annual daily duration of bright sunshine is three hours and 42 minutes.

There are two distinct local weather phenomena. The first is marked downslope lee wind caused by the proximity of the Pennines to the west, leading to super geostrophic winds which can reach in excess of 60 KT (70 mph), most commonly in winter and spring. In the winter, the presence of a subsidence inversion between the Pennines and the North York Moors can allow dense, persistent fog to form, sometimes lasting for several days.

The nearest official Met Office weather station to Northallerton is Leeming, about to the west. Temperature extremes have ranged from during July 2022, (making Leeming the northernmost place in the UK to exceed , down to during December 2010.

Leeming recorded its warmest December temperature on record in 2015.

== Demography ==

According to the United Kingdom Census 2001, the town of Northallerton had a total resident population of 15,741 or 18.5% of the total of Hambleton District. This figure, combined with an area of , provides Northallerton with a population density figure of . This is higher than the average population density of England (at ). There are 8,203 females and 7,538 males, which works out at 91.9 males for every 100 females. The place of birth of the town&#x27;s residents was 98.5% United Kingdom, 0.35% Ireland, 0.37% from other European Union countries, and 0.75% from elsewhere in the world. Compared with the average demographics of England, Northallerton has low proportions of people born outside the United Kingdom and ethnic minorities, and above average numbers of people over 65 years of age.

This table summarises the population changes in the town since 1801: the population grew in the early 19th century and again in the 20th century. In particular, between 1961 and 1991 the population more than doubled. The fall in population between 1851 and 1871 has been attributed to the collapse in coaching as the railways became popular.

== Economy ==

The economic activity of residents aged 16–74 was 44.3% in full-time employment, 15% in part-time employment, 6.8% self-employed, 2.5% unemployed, 2.6% students with jobs, 4.7% students without jobs, 15.8% retired, 6.5% looking after home or family, 5.3% permanently sick or disabled, and 3.1% economically inactive for other reasons.

The average price of a house in Northallerton for the 12-month period ending July 2008 was £209,082 compared to £200,433 for North Yorkshire and the national average of £178,364.

The town is a market centre for the area and also draws traders from further afield to its two annual fairs (formerly four). Cattle drovers bringing cattle, horses and sheep from Northumbria and Scotland regularly came to the town. The original cattle market was by the church, but sheep were sold on High Street until the early part of the 20th century. With the arrival of the railway, a mart was built close to the station, but this closed in 1981 and all business was concentrated on the cattle market held in Applegarth Court.

Northallerton&#x27;s wide High Street incorporates shops, restaurants, pubs and cafes, including local, independent retailers Bettys, Lewis &amp; Cooper, Barkers and Boyes.

== Transport ==

Northallerton was built on the Roman Dere Street. It was a major stopping point on coach routes between Scotland and London with four coaching inns along the High Street. Coaching operations declined in the mid-19th century after the railway arrived in 1841.

Two main A roads pass through the town: the A684 runs approximately east–west through the town and links the A1(M) motorway at Leeming Bar and the A19 at Osmotherley; the A167 runs approximately north–south between the A1(M) at Darlington and the A168 at Topcliffe. The A168 runs from Wetherby via Thirsk to Northallerton.

<doc id="368581" wikidata="Q865716" url="?curid=368581" title="Redditch">
<text>Redditch is a town and non-metropolitan district with borough status in Worcestershire, England. It is located south of Birmingham, east of Bromsgrove, north-west of Alcester and north-east of Worcester. In 2021, the town had a population of 81,637 and the district had a population of 87,037. In the 1800s, it became a centre for the needle and fishing tackle industry; by the end of the century,
90% of the world&#x27;s needles were manufactured in the town and its surrounding areas.

In the 1960s, it became part of the new town planning movement which included it expanding into neighbouring villages and hamlets surrounding the town. It is the second largest settlement in Worcestershire, after Worcester.

==History==
The first recorded mention of Redditch (&quot;Red-Ditch&quot;, thought to be a reference to the red clay of the nearby River Arrow) is in 1348, the year of the outbreak of the Black Death. During the Middle Ages, it became a centre of needle-making and later prominent industries were fish-hooks, fishing tackle, motorcycles and springs, the last of which was notably undertaken by Herbert Terry and Sons. Redditch was designated a new town on 10 April 1964, and the population increased dramatically from 32,000 to around 77,000. Housing developments such as Church Hill, Matchborough, Winyates, Lodge Park, and Woodrow were created to accommodate a large overspill from the industrially expanding Birmingham. Redditch was built as a &quot;flagship&quot; town using new methods and new town planning: all the main roads (mostly new dual carriageways as well as a ring road for the town centre) were banked to reduce noise to the new housing estates, and the whole of Redditch was landscaped. Historically, much of present-day Redditch was located within Warwickshire, but it is now in its entirety administered as a part of Worcestershire.

By the 21st century, needle-making and other traditional industries had been replaced by modern light industry and services, with Redditch also functioning as a dormitory town for Birmingham. The automotive retailer Halfords and engineering company GKN both have their headquarters in Redditch. Manufacturer of precious metal contacts, Samuel Taylor Ltd, has manufacturing plants within the town. Following the redevelopment of the flagship Kingfisher Shopping Centre in 2002, Redditch is undergoing an economic and cultural renaissance.

The town is home to several historical sites. The National Needles Museum and the ruins of Bordesley Abbey are located in the Abbey Ward district, and the remains of a medieval moated settlement called Moons Moat are within the Church Hill estate.

==Governance==

There are two main tiers of local government covering Redditch, at district and county level: Redditch Borough Council and Worcestershire County Council. The borough council is based at Redditch Town Hall on Walter Stranz Square, which was purpose-built for the council and opened in 1982.

The borough contains just one civil parish at Feckenham, in the more rural south-western part of the borough. The rest of the borough is an unparished area.

The parliamentary constituency of Redditch is represented by Chris Bloore of the Labour Party, elected at the 2024 general election.

==Geography==
Redditch is south of the West Midlands urban area. It is north of Evesham on the A435, which skirts it to the east. The main access routes are the A441 via junction 2 of the M42 Motorway, the A435 from junction 3 of the M42 and the A448 via junctions 4 or 5 of the M5. The Roman Road known as Icknield Street is prominent, running north to south through the eastern side of the town.

===Districts of Redditch===
The Borough of Redditch is divided into several districts. To the east of the town are &quot;New Town Districts&quot; built in the 1970s and 1980s. To the west of the Borough are older &quot;Former Village Districts&quot; that dominate the south and west.

See: Districts of Redditch

Since 2011, Redditch has participated in the Greater Birmingham &amp; Solihull Local Enterprise Partnership along with neighbouring authorities Birmingham, Bromsgrove, Cannock Chase, East Staffordshire, Lichfield, Solihull, Tamworth and Wyre Forest.

===Green belt===

Redditch is within a green belt region that extends into the wider surrounding counties, and is in place to reduce urban sprawl, prevent further convergence between the towns surrounding the West Midlands conurbations of Birmingham and Coventry, protect the identity of outlying communities, encourage brownfield reuse and preserve nearby countryside. This is achieved by restricting inappropriate development within the designated areas, and imposing stricter conditions on permitted building.

The main urban area up to the Webheath, Walkwood, and Hunt End suburbs, Astwood Bank, and the southernmost extent of the borough are exempt from the green belt area, bar small adjacent green belt &#x27;wedges&#x27;, but surrounding smaller villages, hamlets and rural areas such as Feckenham, Littleworth, Old Yarr and Ham Green up to the B4090 Salt Way road are &#x27;washed over&#x27; by the designation. The green belt was first drawn up under Worcestershire County Council, and the size in the borough in 2017 amounted to some .

==Transport==
The M42 motorway is a short drive away and it is linked by dual carriageways and A-class roads to surrounding towns such as Bromsgrove and Evesham. There are regular bus services to Studley, Bromsgrove, Catshill and Birmingham.

===Railway===
The railway station is the southern terminus of the Cross-City Line and provides a regular train service via to and Lichfield. Redditch railway station was first opened as the terminus of the Redditch Railway on 19 September 1859, alongside what is now Clive Road. This first station stayed until 4 May 1868 when the last section from Alcester to Redditch of the Redditch and Evesham Railway was closed, at which point a second station was built alongside the junction of Bromsgrove Road and Plymouth Road. This station was provided with a standard Midland Railway design and two platforms. The current station was built in 1993.

===Buses===

There is an extensive network of local bus services run by Diamond West Midlands and other operators (including Stagecoach and a community run bus). Many services run from the bus station in the town centre, a postcard of which was voted Britain&#x27;s most boring postcard in a competition run by the photographer Martin Parr. The bus station was rebuilt as part of the 2002 shopping centre expansion.

Some areas of Redditch have dedicated bus routes; however, there have been issues with safety on these routes and three children have died over the past 15 years.

===Road system===
Redditch is occasionally noted for its confusing road system dominated by a system of dual carriageways built when it became a New Town, including the only cloverleaf interchange in England at the junction of the A441 and the Bromsgrove-bound A448. The system is designed to allow rapid flow of large volumes of traffic around the various districts and into the town centre, whilst keeping fast moving vehicles separated from residential streets. Redditch was briefly famous (via &quot;The Graham Norton Show&quot;) for a tongue-in-cheek calendar featuring its &quot;picturesque&quot; roundabouts created by a local printing company. The calendar was called, unsurprisingly, &quot;Roundabouts of Redditch&quot;, and it proved so successful that it sparked a national series. This self-similar pattern is found on a smaller scale in many of the modern estates in the town, which follow a Radburn style of planned community.

==Education==

Redditch is one of the few areas of the country where the three-tier system of first, middle and high schools still exists. Students attend first school from the age of four, middle school from the age of nine and high school at the age of 13. Other areas of Worcestershire adopted this system at the same time as Redditch (in the 1970s), but many have reverted to the traditional 5–7 infant, 7–11 junior and 11-16/18 secondary schools.

Redditch currently has four high schools (RSA Academy Arrow Vale, Saint Augustine&#x27;s Catholic High School, Tudor Grange Academy, Trinity High School) and six middle schools.

Heart of Worcestershire College (often referred to locally as &quot;HOW College&quot;) is a large general further education college: one of its four campuses is in central Redditch; the other three are in Bromsgrove, Worcester and Malvern. The closest university is the University of Birmingham, 12.5 miles (20 km) to the north.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Sutton Coldfield transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Hereford and Worcester, Heart West Midlands, Radio Wyvern, Capital Mid-Counties, Greatest Hits Radio Midlands, Hits Radio Herefordshire &amp; Worcestershire and Smooth West Midlands.

Redditch&#x27;s local newspapers are &quot;The Redditch Standard&quot; and &quot;The Redditch Advertiser&quot;. 

==Amenities==

Since June 2013, the swimming pool at Abbey Stadium Leisure Centre has been warmed using waste heat from the nearby Redditch Crematorium, in a scheme designed to save around £15,000 a year.

==In popular culture==

The 2012 film &quot;Sightseers&quot; is partly set in Redditch.

Redditch is featured in a section heading in &quot;An Utterly Impartial History of Britain&quot; by John O&#x27;Farrell.

Birmingham and national TV comedian Jasper Carrott makes Redditch a repeated butt of his jokes, for example over the difficulty of escaping the Redditch ring road.

There is a listed theatre in Redditch called the Palace Theatre.

==Places of interest==

*Bordesley Abbey: remains of a former Cistercian abbey, later used as a Royal Swannery.
*Forge Mill Needle Museum: exhibition of traditional needle making.
*Redditch Library: the second-largest library in Worcestershire which attracts up to 12,500 visitors a month.

===Kingfisher Shopping Centre===
Kingfisher Shopping Centre was opened in 1976 by the then Prime Minister James Callaghan and now forms the town&#x27;s primary retail centre.

The centre has over of retail space, with stores including Primark, Next, Boots UK, H&amp;M, The Perfume Shop and Warren James Jewellers. It is one of the largest covered shopping centres in the United Kingdom. In 2007, a cinema opened on the new upper floor and is now owned by Vue Cinemas.

===Arrow Valley Country Park===

Redditch has of public open space in Arrow Valley Country Park. This incorporates the Arrow Valley Lake, fed by the River Arrow. The park incorporates a Local Nature Reserve, Proctor&#x27;s Barn Meadow.
The Arrow Valley Countryside centre, opened in 2000 in the Country Park, has a lakeside café, gift shop and an interactive exhibition. The lake is also used for water sports. There are four waymarked trails for walking and cycling around the lake and through the Country Park. There is a skate park in the south of the park with walks along the river Arrow through the Country Park to the Forge Mill Museum in the north. There are interactive events and family activities at the Countryside Centre and a comprehensive children&#x27;s play area.

===Royal Enfield motorcycles===
Redditch was the home of the Royal Enfield motorcycle. This is where the main factory of the original company was located and the business continued manufacturing until the 1960s, the last model being the Interceptor. The Redditch factory was closed in 1967 and production was moved to the Bradford on Avon factory, which closed in 1970, ending English Enfield manufacturing. In the mid 1950s, the company established a partner, Madras Motors, in Madras, India, who manufactured the Bullet 350 model. The Indian factory is producing new models and has taken Royal Enfield into its third century of manufacturing. Some of the original factory buildings in Redditch still remain, most are in a derelict state and can be seen from Hewell Road. Some buildings have been taken over and now make the old part of Enfield Industrial Estate close to the town centre on Hewell Road.

<text>The speaker of a deliberative assembly, especially a legislative body, is its presiding officer, or the chair. The title was first used in 1377 in England.

== Usage ==
The title was first recorded in 1377 to describe the role of Thomas de Hungerford in the Parliament of England.

The speaker&#x27;s official role is to moderate debate, make rulings on procedure, announce the results of votes, and the like. The speaker decides who may speak and has the powers to discipline members who break the procedures of the chamber or house. The speaker often also represents the body in person, as the voice of the body in ceremonial and some other situations. 

A speaker usually presides the lower house. Different styles are employed to refer to those who preside upper houses or Senates. 

By convention, speakers are normally addressed in Parliament as &#x27;Mister Speaker&#x27; if a man, or &#x27;Madam Speaker&#x27; if a woman. In other cultures, other styles are used, mainly being equivalents of English &quot;chairman&quot; or &quot;president&quot;. Many bodies also have a speaker &quot;pro tempore&quot; (or deputy speaker), designated to fill in when the speaker is not available.

The speaker is commonly supported by a &#x27;speaker&#x27;s office&#x27;.

Examples of speakers include:

===Armenia===
The president of the National Assembly of Armenia is the speaker of the house in the National Assembly of Armenia. The formation of this position was established on 1 August 1918.

===Australia===
The speaker of the House of Representatives is the presiding officer of the Australian House of Representatives, the lower house of the Parliament of Australia. The president of the Senate is the presiding officer of the Australian Senate, the upper house of the Parliament.

=== Brazil ===
==== Federal ====
The Federal Constitution determines that both houses of the National Congress, in the first session after taking office, must elect their &quot;Mesas Diretoras&quot; (Presiding Boards), consisting each of a president, two vice presidents, four secretaries and alternates to serve two-year terms, with no reappointment to the same position in the immediately subsequent election. In addition to voting as senator or federal deputy at their respective houses, both presidents also hold the casting vote in case of a tie, but the large number of legislators (81 in the Federal Senate and 513 in the Chamber of Deputies, as of 2023) makes this attribution rarely used.

The president of the Federal Senate is the presiding officer of the Federal Senate, the upper house. The president of the Chamber of Deputies is the presiding officer of the Chamber of Deputies, the lower house. The Constitution also determines that the president of the Federal Senate presides over the Board of the National Congress in the joint sessions of both houses, the Common Regulations of the National Congress refer to the president of the Federal Senate on these occasions as &quot;President of the National Congress&quot;.

==== States ====
Following the Brazilian political tradition, the legislative assemblies of the states (Legislative Chamber in the case of the Federal District), all unicameral, adopt rules identical to those of the National Congress, electing a Presiding Board among the state deputies for two-year terms on the first session after taking office.

===Canada===

==== Federal ====
In Canada, the speaker of the House of Commons (&quot;Président de la Chambre des communes&quot;) is the individual elected to preside over the House of Commons, the elected lower house. The speaker is a member of parliament (MP) and is elected at the beginning of each new parliament by fellow MPs. The speaker&#x27;s role in presiding over the House of Commons is similar to that of speakers elsewhere in other countries that use the Westminster system. The speaker does not vote except in the case of a tie. By convention, if required to vote, the speaker will vote in favour of continuing debate on a matter, but will not ultimately vote for a measure to be approved.

The speaker of the Senate (&quot;président du Sénat&quot;) is the presiding officer of the Senate, the appointed upper house. The speaker represents the Senate at official functions, rules on questions of parliamentary procedure and parliamentary privilege, and presides over debates and voting in the &quot;Red Chamber&quot;. The speaker of the Senate is appointed by the governor general from amongst sitting senators upon the advice of the prime minister. The speaker has a vote on all matters. In the event of a tie, the matter fails.

==== Provinces ====
At the provincial level, the presiding officer of the provincial legislatures is called the &quot;speaker&quot; (&quot;président&quot;) in all provinces except Quebec, where the term &quot;president&quot; is used. The presiding officer fulfills the same role as the speaker of the House of Commons.

===Chile===
The president of the Chamber of Deputies is the highest authority of the Chamber of Deputies. The president of the Senate is the highest authority of the Senate of Chile.

===China===
In the People&#x27;s Republic of China, the chairman of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress is the presiding officer of the Standing Committee of the National People&#x27;s Congress, which is considered China&#x27;s top legislative body. As stipulated in Article 84 of the Constitution of China, should both the president and vice-president become incapacitated, and the National People&#x27;s Congress is unable to elect a timely replacement, the chairman of the NPC Standing Committee will act as president.

==== Hong Kong ====
The president of the Legislative Council of Hong Kong is the speaker of the Legislative Council and is elected by and from its members. The president presides over the Council meetings and is empowered to enforce the Rules of Procedures solely.

While members of the Legislative Council may be Hong Kong residents who are not Chinese citizens, the president can only be selected from people with Chinese nationality who do not have a right of abode in foreign countries.

=== Italy ===
Parliamentarism in Italy is centred on the presidents of the two Houses, vested in defence of the members and of the assembly as a whole; so &quot;the Speaker invites the representative of the Government not to deviate from the rules of parliamentary behaviour&quot;. Now constitutional community highlights changes also in this role. The president of the Senate also acts as deputy president of the republic &quot;in all cases in which the president cannot perform them&quot;.

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the speaker of the House of Representatives is the presiding officer of the New Zealand House of Representatives, the only chamber of the New Zealand Parliament. Precedent set by other Westminster-style parliaments means that members of Parliament must always address the speaker. 

===Singapore===
In Singapore, the speaker of the Parliament of Singapore is the head officer of the country&#x27;s legislature. By recent tradition, the prime minister nominates a person, who may or may not be an elected member of parliament (MP), for the role. The person&#x27;s name is then proposed and seconded by the MPs, before being elected as speaker. The Constitution states that Parliament has the freedom to decide how to elect its speaker.

While the speaker does not have to be an elected MP, they must possess the qualifications to stand for election as an MP as provided for in the Constitution. The speaker also cannot be a cabinet minister or parliamentary secretary, and must resign from those positions prior to being elected as speaker.

The speaker is one of the few public sector roles which allow its office-holder to automatically qualify as a candidate in the Singapore presidential elections.

===Spain===
The president of the Congress of Deputies is the speaker of the Congress of Deputies, the lower house of the Cortes Generales (the Spanish parliament). The president is elected among the members of the Congress and is, after the king and the prime minister, the highest authority in the Kingdom of Spain.

The president of the Senate is the speaker of the Spanish upper house called Senate.

===Taiwan===
The Legislative Yuan is the highest legislative body of Taiwan. The president of the Legislative Yuan presides over its meetings and is elected by the legislators from among themselves. Until 1993, the president of the Control Yuan was elected by and from the members like the speaker of many other parliamentary bodies.

===United Kingdom===
In the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the Speaker is the individual elected to preside over the elected House of Commons. The speaker is a member of Parliament (MP) and is elected at the beginning of each new parliament by fellow MPs. MPs also elect three Deputy Speakers, known as the Chairman of Ways and Means and the First and Second Deputy Chairmen of Ways and Means.

The Lord Speaker is the presiding officer of the House of Lords. The presiding officer of the House of Lords was until recently the Lord Chancellor, who was also a member of the government (a cabinet member) and the head of the judicial branch. The Lord Chancellor did not have the same authority to discipline members of the Lords that the speaker of the Commons has in that house. The Lord Speaker is elected by the members of the House of Lords and is expected to be politically impartial.

==== Devolved parliaments ====

The presiding officer of the Scottish Parliament is the president, presiding officer and speaker of the Scottish Parliament.

The Llywydd of the Senedd is the speaker of the Senedd, the Welsh parliament.

The speaker of the Northern Ireland Assembly presides over the Northern Ireland Assembly.

===United States===

==== Federal ====
Both chambers of the United States Congress have a presiding officer defined by the United States Constitution. The speaker of the United States House of Representatives presides over the lower house of Congress, the House of Representatives. The speaker, elected by the entire House, is the top-ranking officer of the legislative branch of the federal government. Unlike in Commonwealth realms, the position is partisan, and the speaker often plays an important part in running the House and advancing a political platform; Joseph Gurney Cannon, speaker from 1903 to 1911, is an extreme example.

The vice president of the United States, as provided by the United States Constitution formally presides over the upper house, the Senate. In practice, however, the vice president does not regularly appear in Congress owing to responsibilities in the executive branch and the fact that the vice president may only vote to break a tie, something that rarely occurs due to the filibuster preventing tie votes from occurring in practice. In the vice president&#x27;s absence, the presiding role is delegated to the most senior member of the majority party, who is the president pro tempore of the United States Senate. Since the Senate&#x27;s rules give little power to its non-member presider (who may be of the minority party), the task of presiding over daily business is typically rotated among junior members of the majority party.

====States====
In the forty-nine states that have a bicameral legislature, the highest leadership position in the lower house is usually called the &quot;Speaker&quot; and the upper house is usually the &quot;President of the (State) Senate&quot;. In Nebraska—the only state with a unicameral legislature—the senators elect one senator to serve as &quot;Speaker of the Nebraska Legislature&quot;, who presides over legislative sessions in the absence of the Lieutenant Governor but retains the powers typical of other legislative speakers. In Tennessee, the senators elect a &quot;Speaker of the Senate&quot; who presides over the Tennessee Senate and serves as lieutenant governor.

==Similar posts==
The presiding officer for an upper house of a bicameral legislature usually has a different title such as Chairman or President of the senate when the upper house is called a senate, but they have the same duties. Australia, Chile, the United States and many other countries have upper houses with presiding officers titled &quot;president&quot;. In several American republics, the vice president of the country serves as the president of the upper house. This pattern is not universal, however. Some upper houses, including those of Canada, have a speaker.

<text>The speaker of the House of Commons () is the presiding officer of the lower house of the Parliament of Canada. A member of Parliament (MP), a speaker is elected at the beginning of each new parliament by fellow MPs. The speaker&#x27;s role in presiding over the House of Commons of Canada is similar to that of speakers elsewhere in other countries that use the Westminster system.

The 38th speaker of the House of Commons is Greg Fergus, who assumed the role on October 3, 2023. He is the first person of colour to be elected speaker. The speaker with the longest tenure is Peter Milliken who was elected for four consecutive terms lasting 10 years, 124 days.

==Role==
In Canada it is the speaker&#x27;s responsibility to manage the House of Commons and supervise its staff. It is also the speaker&#x27;s duty to act as a liaison with the Senate and the Crown. They are to rule over the house and have the government answer questions during the question period as well as keep decorum with the house. The speaker receives a salary of CA$299,900 ($203,100 as an MP in addition to $96,800 as speaker) and has use of a small apartment, in the House of Commons, and an official residence, The Farm, an estate located at Kingsmere in Gatineau Park, Quebec, across the river from Ottawa. 

Along with the Senate speaker, the speaker of the House is responsible for the Parliamentary Protective Service, which provides security to Parliament Hill with the Royal Canadian Mounted Police (RCMP).

The term &quot;speaker&quot; originates from the British parliamentary tradition. The French term now used in Canada is (president, chairperson, or presiding officer); the term , a calque (literal translation) of &quot;speaker&quot; and formerly the term used in France for the Speaker of the House of Commons of the United Kingdom, was used until the early 1980s.

The speaker and their deputies preside over debates of the House of Commons, invite particular members to speak, maintain order and decorum (including reproving members who misbehave), and make rulings on points of order and points of privilege. By parliamentary rule and tradition, all statements in the House are addressed to the speaker, never to another member. For example, one does not say, &quot;Prime Minister, will you explain to this House...&quot;, or &quot;Thank you for the question.&quot; Instead, one would say, &quot;Mr. Speaker, will the Prime Minister explain to this House...&quot; or &quot;Madam Speaker, I thank the honourable member for her question.&quot; Members are not allowed to speak while the speaker is speaking, and must sit down when the speaker rises to speak.

By convention, speakers are normally addressed in Parliament as &quot;Mr. Speaker&quot; (&quot;monsieur le président&quot;) for a man, and &quot;Madam Speaker&quot; (&quot;madame la présidente&quot;) for a woman; the speaker has also been addressed using the Inuktitut term ᐅᖃᖅᑎᑦᑎᔨ &quot;(Uqaqtittiji)&quot;. Deputies of the speaker who are presiding at a given time are also addressed as &quot;Mr./Madam Speaker.&quot;

==Election==
Although the Constitution requires that the speaker be elected by the House of Commons, traditionally this amounted to the rubber-stamp approval of an MP nominated by the prime minister. However, in 1986 this was changed and they are now selected by secret ballot. The speaker remains a sitting MP, but only votes on matters in the case of a tie.

All MPs except for Cabinet ministers and party leaders are eligible to run for speaker. Any MP who does not wish to put their name forward must issue a letter withdrawing from the ballot by the day before the vote. All MPs who do not remove their name from the ballot as of 6:00 p.m. the day before the election are listed as candidates on the ballot and are allowed a five-minute speech to persuade their colleagues as to why they should be elected.

The dean of the House supervises the election of the speaker. The current dean is Louis Plamondon, who is also the longest continuously serving MP who is not in Cabinet.

All candidates who receive less than 5 per cent of the vote are removed from the ballot. If no candidate received less than 5% of the vote then the MP with the fewest vote drops off. This continues, with a one-hour break between ballots, until one candidate receives more than 50 per cent of the vote. In the event of a tie on the final ballot, the ballot is taken again. This happened once, in 1993, when Gilbert Parent won over Jean-Robert Gauthier.

The winner is escorted to the speaker&#x27;s chair by the prime minister and leader of the Official Opposition. The newly elected speaker, by tradition, feigns reluctance as they are &quot;dragged&quot; to the chair in a practice dating from the days when British speakers risked execution if the news they reported to the king was displeasing.

On June 2, 2011, Conservative Andrew Scheer (Regina—Qu&#x27;Appelle) was elected speaker, defeating the following MPs over the course of six ballots: New Democrat Denise Savoie (Victoria) and Conservatives Dean Allison (Niagara West—Glanbrook), Barry Devolin (Haliburton—Kawartha Lakes—Brock), Ed Holder (London West), Lee Richardson (Calgary Centre), Bruce Stanton (Simcoe North), and Merv Tweed (Brandon—Souris). At the age of , Scheer was the youngest Speaker in Canadian history.

On December 2, 2015, Liberal Geoff Regan was elected speaker by members of the 42nd Parliament over fellow Liberal candidates Denis Paradis, Yasmin Ratansi and Conservative Bruce Stanton. He was the first speaker from Atlantic Canada or Nova Scotia in nearly a hundred years since Edgar Nelson Rhodes in 1922.

Anthony Rota was elected as 37th speaker on December 5, 2019, by winning a ranked ballot between himself, Joël Godin, Carol Hughes, Geoff Regan (the speaker during the previous Parliament), and Bruce Stanton. Following Rota&#x27;s win, the Conservatives said that he had them to thank for his new election, after they decided in a Conservative caucus meeting to unseat Regan as a show of strength to the Liberal minority government that had obtained from the election that October 21. They did so by ranking Regan lower on the ranked ballot.

===Opposition speakers===
The speaker usually comes from among MPs of the governing party. But because they cannot vote unless their vote would break a tie and by convention must vote to maintain the status quo (which includes voting confidence in the government), a minority government can slightly weaken the opposition&#x27;s power by electing an opposition speaker.

Speakers have been elected from opposition parties during the 1926 tenure of Arthur Meighen&#x27;s Conservative ministry, the 1979 ministry of Progressive Conservative Joe Clark, and Stephen Harper&#x27;s Conservative Ministry from 2006 to 2011. In the 39th Parliament, opposition members Peter Milliken, Diane Marleau, and Marcel Proulx ran for speaker. In 1957, when John Diefenbaker took power with a minority Progressive Conservative government, he offered the speaker&#x27;s chair to Stanley Knowles of the opposition Co-operative Commonwealth Federation (the precursor to the New Democratic Party, or NDP) who declined. So far, every speaker from an opposition party has been a Liberal. Louis Plamondon, who became interim speaker on September 28, 2023 following the resignation of Anthony Rota and will serve until the election of a new speaker in early October, is a member of the Bloc Québécois.

==Impartiality==
The speaker is required to perform their office impartially, but does not resign from their party membership upon taking office, as is done in the United Kingdom. Speaker Lucien Lamoureux, the 27th holder, decided to follow the custom of the speaker of the British House of Commons and ran in the 1968 election as an independent. Both the Liberal Party and the Progressive Conservative Party agreed not to run candidates against him. The New Democratic Party, however, declined to withdraw their candidate. Lamoureux was re-elected and continued to serve as speaker. However, in the 1972 election, the opposition parties did not come to an agreement and ran candidates against him. Lamoureux was again returned but no subsequent speakers have repeated his attempt to run as an independent. The opposition parties may have chosen not to follow the 1968 precedent because of how close the election was: it produced a Liberal minority government with just two more seats than the Conservatives.

==Tie-breaking votes==
On May 19, 2005, Speaker Peter Milliken was required to cast the tie-breaking vote during a confidence measure for the first time in Canadian history. Faced with the defeat of Paul Martin&#x27;s minority government, Milliken voted in favour of the NDP budget amendment. Despite popular belief that the speaker, as a Liberal MP, would automatically support the government, his vote was pre-determined by other factors. As speaker, Milliken&#x27;s vote must be cast to allow the continuation of debate, or to maintain the status quo, a reflection of Speaker Denison&#x27;s rule practiced in the British House of Commons. Thus, the speaker voted in favour of second reading, &quot;to allow the House time for further debate so that it can make its own decision at some future time.&quot; The bill would later pass third reading without the need for Milliken&#x27;s vote.

Speakers have only needed to vote in order to break a tie 11 times in Canadian parliamentary history. Milliken did so on five occasions, almost as many as all previous speakers combined.

==Deputy speaker==
In addition to the speaker, a deputy speaker, also known as the Chair of Committees (of the whole), is elected at the beginning of each parliament to act in place of the speaker when the latter is unavailable. Under the Standing Orders, the speaker, after consulting with each of the party leaders, nominates a candidate for deputy speaker to the House, which then votes on that nomination. The deputy speaker presides over daily sessions of the House when the speaker is not in the chair. The deputy speaker also chairs the House when it sits as a Committee of the Whole. Other presiding officers, the deputy chair of committees and the assistant deputy chair of committees, are chosen each session to occupy the chair when the speaker and deputy speaker are not available. The deputy speaker and the other presiding officers are members of the Panel of Chairs, and can therefore be selected by the speaker to chair legislative committees. Like the speaker, the deputy speaker has a role in administering the House.

The deputy speaker of the 44th Canadian Parliament was Chris d&#x27;Entremont (Conservative); and the assistant deputy speaker was Carol Hughes (NDP).

The Chair of Committees is vested by Subsection 43(1) of the Parliament of Canada Act with full and adequate authority to address matters in the titular Speaker&#x27;s absence: &quot;Whenever the House of Commons is informed of the unavoidable absence of the Speaker thereof by the Clerk at the table, the Chairman of Committees, if present, shall take the chair and perform the duties and exercise the authority of Speaker in relation to all the proceedings of the House, as Deputy Speaker.&quot;

==Retirement==
Most former speakers retire from Parliament after their tenure as speaker, sometimes after returning to the backbench for a period. Several have been appointed to diplomatic positions, summoned to the Senate, or appointed to a vice-regal position such as lieutenant-governor of a province or, in two cases, governor general of Canada (Roland Michener and Jeanne Sauvé). While several former Cabinet ministers have served as speaker or stood for the position, no former speakers have subsequently been appointed to Cabinet. One speaker, Andrew Scheer, has gone on to assume a front bench position in the House of Commons: Scheer became leader of the Conservative Party of Canada in 2017 and served as leader of the Opposition from 2017 to 2020.

==Interim speaker==

The resignation of Speaker Anthony Rota on September 27, 2023, led to an unprecedented situation in which there was no Speaker while the House had several sitting days already planned. To give time for the election of a new Speaker to be organized, the House agreed by unanimous consent on September 26 to name Louis Plamondon of the Bloc Québécois as interim Speaker until the election. He was chosen as interim speaker by virtue of his status as Dean of the House, the longest-serving MP who is not a cabinet member or party leader; the Dean of the House is in any event in charge of presiding over the election of a Speaker at the beginning of a new Parliament. 

==Honorary Speaker==

On March 9, 2016 Liberal MP Mauril Bélanger served as honorary speaker for about an hour to honour his years of service. Speaker Regan resumed his duties for the remainder of the sitting of the House.

Bélanger had initially been considered a front runner to be speaker in the previous year, but had withdrawn due to his being diagnosed with amyotrophic lateral sclerosis. Bélanger died on August 15, 2016, five months after being named honorary speaker.

==Counterparts==
The speaker&#x27;s counterpart in the upper house is the speaker of the Senate of Canada. Canadian provincial and territorial legislatures also have speakers with much the same roles. The position was preceded by the speaker of the Legislative Assembly of the Province of Canada.

<text>Los Jairas was a Bolivian folk music group that was active in the 1960s. Their work features the charango, a stringed instrument from Bolivia.

&quot;World Music&quot; wrote that &quot;In Bolivia innumerable groups have followed the Los Jairas model. Among the more prominent — through tours or recordings — are Los K&#x27;jarkas, Savia Andina, Khanata, Los Quipus, Wara, Los Yuras, Grupo Aymara and Paja Brava.&quot;

Los Jairas formed in 1965 by Edgar &#x27;Yayo&#x27; Jofré, who brought the group together to play at &quot;Pena Naira&quot;.

One of the early members was Gilbert Favre, founder of the folklore cabaret La Pena Naira in La Paz.

Members of the band:
*Ernesto Cavour - charango
*Edgar Joffré - voice, drums, zampoña (also called sicu)
*Julio Godoy
*Gilbert Favre - quena (kena)

Favre was a Swiss jazz player who played the quena with great skill and sensitivity.

On several of their albums, they featured Alfredo Dominguez, one of the finest Bolivian guitar players who wrote and composed many songs. His appearance on the album &quot;Grito de Bolivia&quot; was the highlights of Los Jairas&#x27; research into neo-folklore.

<doc id="368608" wikidata="Q7349067" url="?curid=368608" title="Robert Purvis">
<text>Robert Purvis (August 4, 1810 – April 15, 1898) was an American abolitionist in the United States. He was born in Charleston, South Carolina, and was likely educated at Amherst Academy, a secondary school in Amherst, Massachusetts. He spent most of his life in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1833 he helped found the American Anti-Slavery Society and the Library Company of Colored People. From 1845 to 1850 he served as president of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society and also traveled to Britain to gain support for the movement.

Of mixed race, Purvis and his brothers inherited considerable wealth from their native British father after his death in 1826. Purvis&#x27;s parents had lived in a common law marriage, prevented from marrying because his mother was a mixed race free woman of color, of Sub-Saharan African and Jewish descent. The sons chose to identify with the black community and used their education and wealth to support abolition of slavery and anti-slavery activities, as well as projects in education to help the advance of African Americans.

==Early life==
Purvis was born in 1810 in Charleston, South Carolina. His maternal grandparents were Dido Badaraka, a former enslaved woman, and Baron Judah, a Jewish American native of Charleston. His mother Harriet Judah was born a free woman of color. Purvis&#x27;s father was an immigrant from Great Britain.

As an adult, Purvis told a reporter about his family. His maternal grandmother, Badaraka, was kidnapped at age 12 from Morocco where she was already a slave, she was then transported to South Carolina on a slave ship, and sold as a slave in India. He described her as dark-skinned with tightly curled hair, she was most likely of Sub-Saharan African descent as evidenced by her name and her physical description. She was freed at age 19 by her master&#x27;s will. Harriet&#x27;s father was Baron Judah, born in Charleston of Ashkenazi and Sephardi Jewish descent. Baron was the third of ten children born to Hillel Judah, a Jewish immigrant from Germany, and Charleston native Abigail Seixas, his Spanish-Portuguese Jewish wife.

Purvis told the reporter that his grandparents Badaraka and Judah had married. This claim has been questioned by 21st-century biographers, given the social prominence of the Judah family in Charleston. Judah&#x27;s parents owned slaves. In any case, Badaraka and Judah had a relationship for several years, and had two children together, Harriet and her brother. In 1790, Judah broke off his relationship with Badaraka when he moved with his parents from Charleston to Savannah, Georgia. In 1791 he moved to Richmond, Virginia. There he married a Jewish woman and had four children with her.

William Purvis was from Northumberland. His father died while he was a child, and his mother moved to Edinburgh for her sons&#x27; education. He immigrated to the United States as a young man with some of his brothers to make their fortunes. William became a wealthy cotton salesman in Charleston and was a naturalized United States citizen.

William Purvis and Harriet Judah lived together as husband and wife, but racial law prevented their marriage. The couple had three sons: William, born in 1806; Robert, born in 1810; and Joseph, born in 1812. In 1819 the family moved north to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where the boys attended the Pennsylvania Abolitionist Society&#x27;s Clarkson School. William intended to consolidate his business affairs and return with his family to Britain, where he thought his sons would have better opportunities. He died in 1826 before they could move.

William Purvis had intended his sons to be educated as gentlemen, and Robert and Joseph Purvis likely attended Amherst Academy, a secondary school in Amherst, Massachusetts. There is no evidence that either Robert or Joseph Purvis attended Amherst College, a common misconception. (Amherst College catalogs from the 1820s do not list them as enrolled.) The brothers returned to Philadelphia, where their family was among the black elite. After their father died, Purvis and his two brothers were to share an estate worth $250,000. In 1828 the oldest brother William died of tuberculosis. Robert and Joseph inherited increased shares of the estate; they used their wealth to support their political activism and public service.

==Marriage and family==

In 1832, Purvis married Harriet Davy Forten, a woman of color and the daughter of wealthy sailmaker James Forten and his wife Charlotte, both prominent abolitionists and leaders in Philadelphia. Like her parents and siblings, Harriet Forten Purvis was active in anti-slavery groups in the city, including the interracial Philadelphia Female Anti-Slavery Society.

The Purvises had eight children, including son Charles Burleigh Purvis (1841-1926). He became a surgeon and professor for 30 years in the medical school at Howard University. In addition, the couple raised Harriet&#x27;s niece, Charlotte Forten Grimké, after her mother died. In her later life, Harriet Forten Purvis lectured publicly against segregation and for expanded suffrage for all citizens.

After Harriet died, Purvis married Tacie Townsend, who was of European descent. She was from Byberry Township (now Northeast Philadelphia), where Purvis had moved after the 3-day riots threatened his safety. As a public figure, he was criticized for this marriage by both whites and blacks who cared about the color line.

==Political life==
In 1833, Purvis helped abolitionist William Lloyd Garrison establish the American Anti-Slavery Society in Philadelphia and signed its &quot;Declaration of Sentiments&quot;. Living for nearly the rest of the 19th century, Purvis was the last surviving member of the society. That same year, he helped establish the Library Company of Colored People, modeled after the Library Company of Philadelphia, a subscription organization. With Garrison&#x27;s support, in 1834, Purvis traveled to Britain to meet leading abolitionists.

In 1838, he drafted the &quot;Appeal of Forty Thousand Citizens Threatened with Disfranchisement&quot;, which urged the repeal of a new state constitutional amendment disfranchising free African Americans. There were widespread tensions and fears among whites following Nat Turner&#x27;s slave rebellion of 1831 in Virginia. Although Pennsylvania was a free state that had abolished slavery, state legislators persisted in passing this amendment to restrict free blacks&#x27; political rights. Free men of color in Pennsylvania did not regain suffrage until after the ratification of the Fifteenth Amendment in 1870, following the Civil War.

From 1845 to 1850, Purvis served as president of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, a biracial organization. As a supporter of the Underground Railroad, Purvis served as chairman of the General Vigilance Committee from 1852 to 1857, which gave direct aid to fugitive slaves. According to his records, Purvis estimated that from 1831 to 1861, he helped one slave per day achieve freedom, aiding a total of more than 9,000 slaves to escape to the North. He used his own house, then located outside the city, in Byberry Township, as a station on the Underground Railroad. One of these slaves was Madison Washington, who Purvis harboured during his escape to Canada. Purvis built Byberry Hall on the edge of the Quaker-owned, Byberry Friends Meeting campus. Byberry Hall, which still stands today, hosted anti-slavery speakers and was across the street from Purvis&#x27;s home. Among the enslaved Africans he assisted was Thomas J. Dorsey, who became one of three of the top caterers in Philadelphia in the 19th century. Purvis was a friend of both Thomas and his son William Henry Dorsey, who was an artist and collector of Black history. William compiled hundreds of scrapbooks of Black history during the 19th century and built a collection that he laid out in his home in Philadelphia.

Purvis supported many progressive causes in addition to abolition. With Lucretia Mott, he supported women&#x27;s rights and suffrage. He was a member of the American Equal Rights Association while Mott was president. Purvis also attended the founding meeting of the Pennsylvania Woman Suffrage Association.

He supported temperance and similar social issues. He believed in integrated groups working for greater progress for all. By the end of the Civil War, which gained the emancipation of slaves and suffrage for black men, Purvis had reached his late 50s and became less active in political affairs.

==Lombard Street riot==

Irish Catholics, often competitors for the lowest-paying, unskilled and menial jobs, perceived successful African-American residents in the city as flaunting their success. Immigrants expressed their frustrations and jealousy in various attacks on blacks.

A three-day race riot began on August 1, 1842. The mostly Irish rioters set fires and attacked firefighters and police as they went, heading for Purvis&#x27;s home, where they protested outside for forty hours. Purvis and his home were reportedly saved from the Irish mob solely by a Catholic priest&#x27;s intervention.

==Death and legacy==
Neither of Purvis&#x27;s elder sons survived the American Civil War. Both William P. Purvis (1832–1857) and Robert Purvis (1834–1862) were buried in the Byberry burial ground in northeast Philadelphia. When the burial ground of St. Thomas African Episcopal Church was closed, where his mother had been buried in central Philadelphia, Purvis had her remains transferred to Fair Hill Burial Ground in Philadelphia&#x27;s Fairhill neighborhood. His wife (1810-1875) and daughter Georgianna (1848-1877) who had died of consumption were buried here, as he was in 1898.

His abolitionist efforts are memorialized by the state of Pennsylvania and by the National Park Service.

<text>A livery company is a type of guild or professional association that originated in medieval times in London, England. Livery companies comprise London&#x27;s ancient and modern trade associations and guilds, almost all of which are styled the &quot;Worshipful Company of&quot; their craft, trade or profession. There are 112 livery companies in total. They play a significant part in the life of the City of London (i.e. the financial district and historic heart of the capital), not least by providing charitable-giving and networking opportunities. Liverymen retain voting rights for the senior civic offices, such as the Lord Mayor, Sheriffs and Common Council of the City Corporation, London&#x27;s ancient municipal authority with extensive local government powers.

The term &quot;livery&quot; originated in the designed form of dress worn by retainers of a nobleman and then by extension to special dress to denote status of belonging to a trade. Livery companies evolved from London&#x27;s medieval guilds, becoming corporations by royal charter responsible for training in their trades, as well as for the regulation of aspects such as wage control, labour conditions and industry standards. Early guilds often grew out of parish fraternal organizations, where numerous members of the same trade lived in close proximity often congregating at the same church. Like most organisations during the Middle Ages, these livery companies had close ties with the Roman Catholic Church (before the Protestant Reformation), endowing religious establishments such as chantry chapels and churches, observing religious festivals and hosting ceremonies as well as well-known mystery plays. Most livery companies retain their historical religious associations, although nowadays members are free to follow any faith or none. 

Many, but not all, Livery companies established a guild or meeting hall. Though these halls faced destruction in the Great London Fire of 1666 and during the Blitz of World War II, over forty companies still own or share ownership of livery halls, some elaborate and historic, others modern replacements for halls destroyed or redeveloped. Most of these halls are made available for use by other companies not having a livery hall of their own.

Many ancient livery companies maintain contact with their original trade or craft. In some cases, livery companies have chosen to support a replacement industry fulfilling a similar purpose today, e.g. plastics replacing the use of horn or ivory in the case of the Horners&#x27; Company and fashion for the Haberdashers&#x27; Company. Modern companies (those created after 1926) are mainly representatives of today&#x27;s professions and industries and operate in close association with these. Many ancient crafts remain as relevant today as when their guilds were originally established. Some still exercise powers of regulation, inspection and enforcement, e.g. the Goldsmiths&#x27; Company Assay Office, while others are awarding bodies for professional qualifications. The Scriveners&#x27; Company admits senior members of legal and associated professions, the Apothecaries&#x27; Society awards post-graduate qualifications in some medical specialities, and the Hackney Carriage Drivers&#x27; Company comprises licensed taxi drivers who have passed the &quot;Knowledge of London&quot; test. Several companies restrict membership to those holding relevant professional qualifications, e.g. the City of London Solicitors&#x27; Company and the Worshipful Company of Engineers. Other companies whose trade died out long ago, such as the Bowyers&#x27; Company, have evolved into being primarily charitable foundations. Many companies, for example the Pinmakers, have disappeared entirely since their creation.

After the Carmen&#x27;s Company received City livery status in 1848 no new companies were established until 1926 when the Honourable Company of Master Mariners was founded (granted livery in 1932). Post-1926 creations are known as &quot;modern livery companies&quot;. The Worshipful Company of Entrepreneurs, the newest, was granted livery status in 2025, making it the 112th City livery company in order of precedence. 

The Honourable Company of Air Pilots is just one example of London&#x27;s livery companies to have active overseas committees.

==Purpose==

===Training and industry===
London&#x27;s Livery companies originally began to be established in the 12th century, to guarantee that a member was trustworthy and fully qualified, and that the goods they produced were of reputable quality, the two-fold aim being to protect the public and to protect members from charlatans. They continued to be established until the 17th century, when political upheaval in England, particularly the Civil War, as well as the growth of London outwards from the City rendered many such livery companies, which only controlled trade within the Square Mile, less competitive or viable. Following the Stuart Restoration many livery companies were revived, but with Britain taking a leading role in the expansion of global trade the City also adapted by establishing exchanges, some of which later became guardians of business conduct.

From the 1870s, there was a further revival of livery companies, with many extending their original educational purpose to technical education, supporting new industries and providing the necessary training, most notably through the City and Guilds of London Institute.

===Charity and education===
From their inception, livery companies cared for their members in sickness and old age by the giving of alms. Today, they continue to support both their members, and wider charitable aims and activities such as education and training.

Numerous educational establishments in England were founded by and retain association with livery companies, among the best-known being the Haberdashers&#x27;, Merchant Taylors&#x27; and Skinners&#x27; schools.

===Support for the Armed Forces===
Most livery companies maintain proud affiliations with regular and reserve units of the British Armed Forces, providing links between civilian and military life.

===City of London governance===
The livery companies have always been a constituent part of the governance of the City of London. The senior members of the livery companies, i.e. liverymen, elect the City&#x27;s Sheriffs, Bridge Masters, Ale Conners, Auditors, members of the City Livery Committee, and approve the aldermanic candidates for election to the office of Lord Mayor of London.

==Entry==
Entry to a livery company may be by one of four routes:
* By invitation to become an Honorary Freeman/Liveryman/Assistant. This is rare, and is considered a great honour.
* By apprenticeship or servitude. This is nowadays less common. In earlier days, someone wishing to enter a trade would bind himself as apprentice to a member of his chosen trade. As such, he was required to do as he was instructed, and in return for strict adherence to the master&#x27;s rules the apprentice learned his trade, while his master was required to provide such training that, at the end of the apprenticeship (usually seven years) the apprentice would be sufficiently knowledgeable to become a member – and a Freeman of the City of London – free of the obligations of apprenticeship. 
* By patrimony. Generally, a member&#x27;s son/grandson (or now also a daughter/granddaughter) who was born after the parent became a member of a company are entitled to become a member by patrimony.
* By redemption. Redemption is the path to the freedom for all others who do not qualify for apprenticeship, patrimony or by invitation and requires the payment of a fine (fee) as well as an interview or other admission procedure.

Regardless of method of entry, membership carries the same duties, responsibilities and privileges. Membership of a livery company may combine with the freedom of the City of London, now an essential formality, though in the past the Freedom carried benefits, such as being able to drive a flock of sheep across London Bridge at no charge.

==Governance==
Livery companies are governed by a Master (alternatively styled Prime Warden in some companies, or Upper Bailiff of the Weavers&#x27; Company), a number of Wardens (holding various titles such as the Upper, Middle, Lower, or Renter Wardens), and a court of Assistants (board of directors), responsible for company business and electing its Master and Wardens. The &quot;Clerk to the Company&quot; is the most senior permanent member of staff, who as chief executive officer runs its day-to-day activities.

The livery companies elect a majority of the members of the Livery Committee, a body administered at Guildhall. The committee oversees the elections of Sheriffs and the Lord Mayor, educates liverymen regarding the City Corporation&#x27;s activities and represents the livery companies in communications with the City.

Membership generally falls into two categories: freemen and liverymen.

==Freemen==
One may become a freeman, or be admitted to the &quot;freedom of the company&quot;, upon fulfilling certain criteria: traditionally, by &quot;patrimony&quot;, if either parent/grandparent were a liveryman of the company; by &quot;servitude&quot;, if one has served a requisite number of years as an apprentice to a senior company member; or by &quot;redemption&quot;, upon paying a fee. Most livery companies reserve the right to admit distinguished people, particularly in their sphere of influence, as Honorary Freeman/Liveryman/Assistant. Freemen may advance to become liverymen, after obtaining the Freedom of the City of London, and with their court of Assistants&#x27; approval. Only liverymen are eligible to vote in the annual election of the Lord Mayor of London, the Sheriffs and various other City civic offices, including the Ale Conners and Bridge Masters.

==Liverymen==

A liveryman is a full member of his/her respective company.

When a freeman is promoted liveryman, the candidate is said to be &#x27;clothed in the livery&#x27;: indeed, a &quot;livery gown&quot; is placed on him at the Court meeting which he wears to the subsequent formal or social occasion. Thereafter only the Master, Wardens and Assistants wear livery gowns at company functions. Masters wear them at the City&#x27;s formal events, e.g. the two Common Halls and the United Guilds Service, and Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show, wherever they may participate. Ordinarily, liverymen wear ties or brooches at formal functions and each company differs by allowing men/women to wear distinct items subject to the occasion, such as a tie, scarf, badge or brooch.

Freemen are expected to advance to become liverymen by a vote of the court of each company. Liverymen no longer have any local government franchise in the City, but retain the exclusive right of voting in the election of the Lord Mayor (Michaelmas &#x27;Common Hall&#x27; 29 September) and for the Sheriffs (Mid-Summer &#x27;Common Hall&#x27; 24 June) held at Guildhall as a ceremonial occasion. The votes are made by &#x27;acclamation&#x27; subject to a challenge/demand from the floor for a ballot which would be held a week later. Any two liverymen may nominate a candidate for the freedom of the City.

===Former parliamentary election rights===
Before the Reform Act 1832 the liverymen had the exclusive right to elect the four Members of Parliament (MPs) representing the City. Between 1832 and 1918 being a liveryman was one of a number of possible franchises which could qualify a parliamentary elector in the City of London constituency, as it was a preserved ancient borough franchise under the terms of the 1832 Act.

==Livery halls==
Today 39 out of 112 City livery companies own premises in London, as well as the Watermen and Lightermen which although not strictly a livery company, retains headquarters still in regular use. Among the earliest companies known to have had halls are the Merchant Taylors and Goldsmiths in the 14th century, and, uniquely, the kitchen and the crypt of Merchant Taylors&#x27; Hall survived both the Great Fire of London and the Blitz, the kitchen now having been in uninterrupted use for over 600 years.

Besides part of Merchant Taylors&#x27; Hall kitchens, the oldest interiors extant of a livery hall proper are those of the Apothecaries&#x27; Society, most rooms of which date from 1668 to 1671; significant portions of the fabric of this building are also medieval, from the 13th-century priory, part of which became Apothecaries&#x27; Hall. Several companies that do not have a hall of their own share office premises within the hall of another company on a semi-permanent basis, examples being the Spectacle Makers&#x27; Company, which uses part of Apothecaries&#x27; Hall, and the Worshipful Company of Shipwrights, which co-habits with the Ironmongers. Many livery halls can be hired for business and social functions, and are popular for weddings, commercial and society meetings, luncheons and dinners.

Three livery companies (the Glaziers and Painters of Glass, Launderers and Scientific Instrument Makers) share a hall in Southwark, just south of and outside the City of London, while the Worshipful Company of Gunmakers has long been based at Proof House in the London Borough of Tower Hamlets. Companies without halls customarily book use of another livery hall for their formal gatherings, giving members and guests the opportunity to visit and enjoy different City livery halls by rotation.

Blue plaques throughout the City of London indicate where companies formerly had halls. Whilst several livery companies may aspire to owning or regaining their own hall it is appreciated that any increase in the overall number of livery halls would inevitably lead to some dilution of use of the existing halls. There is also attraction in belonging to a company which is .

==Precedence==
In 1515, the Court of Aldermen of the City of London settled an order of precedence for the 48 livery companies then in existence, based on those companies&#x27; contemporary economic or political power. The 12 highest-ranked companies remain known as the Great Twelve City Livery Companies. Presently, there are 111 City livery companies, with the newer companies generally being ranked by seniority of creation. The origins of some companies, and the granting of their liveries, are now obscure.

The Merchant Taylors and the Skinners have long disputed their precedence, so once a year (at Easter) they swap between sixth and seventh places. This mix-up is a favourite theory for the origin of the phrase &quot;at sixes and sevens&quot;, as has been pointed out by at least one Master Merchant Taylor; however, it is possible that the phrase may have been coined before the dispute arose, as it comes from the companies both receiving their Charters in 1327 with no proof surviving as to which was granted first.

===Notes===
===Coats of arms of the Great Twelve Livery Companies===

=== City companies without grant of livery===

&quot;Company without Livery&quot; is a status which applies during the period between when a guild is recognised by the Court of Aldermen and when it is granted the rights of a livery. A guild initially applies to be a &quot;London Guild&quot;, and may later apply to the Court to become a &quot;Company of the City of London&quot;. After an indefinite period, such a &quot;Company of the City of London&quot; can apply to the Aldermen for livery status; if granted, they can thereafter use the honorific prefix &quot;Worshipful Company&quot;.

* Company of Communicators (recognised as a City Company in 2022)

====Guilds and companies aiming to obtain the grant of Livery====

* Guild of Human Resource Professionals
* Guild of Investment Managers

===Other companies and organisations===

* Worshipful Company of Parish Clerks
* Company of Watermen and Lightermen

Neither the &quot;Company of Parish Clerks&quot; nor the &quot;Company of Watermen&quot; have applied or intend to apply for livery status, which remains a long-standing City tradition. This is granted by the City Corporation in effect to control a company. The Watermen and Parish Clerks are governed by statutes and royal charters with responsibilities outside the City. The Company of Watermen and Lightermen was established by Act of Parliament in 1555 to regulate the watermen on the River Thames responsible for the movement of goods and passengers and remains the only ancient City guild to be formed and governed by Act of Parliament. They are then strictly not &#x27;companies without livery&#x27; at all but simply &#x27;companies&#x27;.

The Ward Beadles of the City of London are the elected officials, not representatives, of the City Wards so have constitutional standing. They are associated together for mainly communications and social activities; they are a corps rather than a guild.

City Livery Club, founded in 1914, is a livery-oriented organisation of over 1000 members based at Bell Wharf Lane near Southwark Bridge. The club&#x27;s motto is &quot;uniting the livery, promoting fellowship&quot;.

The Guild of Young Freemen and the Guild of Freemen of the City of London, whilst not being livery companies, are popular associations amongst the freemen of the City, with the young freemen being open to those under the age of 40. 

The Honourable Company of Freemen of the City of London of North America (headquartered in Toronto, Ontario, Canada) represents Freemen and Liverymen of the City of London living in North America.

===The Southwark Manors===
The City Corporation of London retains the lordship of three manors in Southwark (Guildable, King&#x27;s and Great Liberty). 

Now membership organisations, members are eligible to serve as ceremonial officers or jurors in their relevant manorial jurisdiction. These courts retain legal-standing under the Administration of Justice Act 1977, being in no way &quot;guilds&quot; never having been related to trading and occupational activities.

===Former livery companies===
Guilds which at one point attained the status of livery companies and have since ceased to exist include the following:

*Combmakers
*Silk Throwsters
*Silkmen
*Pinmakers
*Soap Makers
*Hatband Makers
*Long Bowstring Makers

<doc id="368621" wikidata="Q900117" url="?curid=368621" title="Sphere packing">
<text>In geometry, a sphere packing is an arrangement of non-overlapping spheres within a containing space. The spheres considered are usually all of identical size, and the space is usually three-dimensional Euclidean space. However, sphere packing problems can be generalised to consider unequal spheres, spaces of other dimensions (where the problem becomes circle packing in two dimensions, or hypersphere packing in higher dimensions) or to non-Euclidean spaces such as hyperbolic space.

A typical sphere packing problem is to find an arrangement in which the spheres fill as much of the space as possible. The proportion of space filled by the spheres is called the &quot;packing density&quot; of the arrangement. As the local density of a packing in an infinite space can vary depending on the volume over which it is measured, the problem is usually to maximise the average or asymptotic density, measured over a large enough volume.

For equal spheres in three dimensions, the densest packing uses approximately 74% of the volume. A random packing of equal spheres generally has a density around 63.5%.

== Classification and terminology ==
A lattice arrangement (commonly called a regular arrangement) is one in which the centers of the spheres form a very symmetric pattern which needs only &quot;n&quot; vectors to be uniquely defined (in &quot;n&quot;-dimensional Euclidean space). Lattice arrangements are periodic. Arrangements in which the spheres do not form a lattice (often referred to as irregular) can still be periodic, but also aperiodic (properly speaking non-periodic) or random. Because of their high degree of symmetry, lattice packings are easier to classify than non-lattice ones. Periodic lattices always have well-defined densities.

== Regular packing ==

===Dense packing===

In three-dimensional Euclidean space, the densest packing of equal spheres is achieved by a family of structures called close-packed structures. One method for generating such a structure is as follows. Consider a plane with a compact arrangement of spheres on it. Call it A. For any three neighbouring spheres, a fourth sphere can be placed on top in the hollow between the three bottom spheres. If we do this for half of the holes in a second plane above the first, we create a new compact layer. There are two possible choices for doing this, call them B and C. Suppose that we chose B. Then one half of the hollows of B lies above the centers of the balls in A and one half lies above the hollows of A which were not used for B. Thus the balls of a third layer can be placed either directly above the balls of the first one, yielding a layer of type A, or above the holes of the first layer which were not occupied by the second layer, yielding a layer of type C. Combining layers of types A, B, and C produces various close-packed structures.

Two simple arrangements within the close-packed family correspond to regular lattices. One is called cubic close packing (or face-centred cubic, &quot;FCC&quot;)—where the layers are alternated in the ABCABC... sequence. The other is called hexagonal close packing (&quot;HCP&quot;), where the layers are alternated in the ABAB... sequence. But many layer stacking sequences are possible (ABAC, ABCBA, ABCBAC, etc.), and still generate a close-packed structure. In all of these arrangements each sphere touches 12 neighboring spheres, and the average density is
:formula_1

In 1611, Johannes Kepler conjectured that this is the maximum possible density amongst both regular and irregular arrangements—this became known as the Kepler conjecture. Carl Friedrich Gauss proved in 1831 that these packings have the highest density amongst all possible lattice packings. In 1998, Thomas Callister Hales, following the approach suggested by László Fejes Tóth in 1953, announced a proof of the Kepler conjecture. Hales&#x27; proof is a proof by exhaustion involving checking of many individual cases using complex computer calculations. Referees said that they were &quot;99% certain&quot; of the correctness of Hales&#x27; proof. On 10 August 2014, Hales announced the completion of a formal proof using automated proof checking, removing any doubt.

=== Other common lattice packings ===

Some other lattice packings are often found in physical systems. These include the cubic lattice with a density of formula_2, the hexagonal lattice with a density of formula_3 and the tetrahedral lattice with a density of formula_4.

===Jammed packings with a low density===
Packings where all spheres are constrained by their neighbours to stay in one location are called rigid or jammed. The strictly jammed (mechanically stable even as a finite system) regular sphere packing with the lowest known density is a diluted (&quot;tunneled&quot;) fcc crystal with a density of only . The loosest known regular jammed packing has a density of approximately 0.0555.

== Irregular packing ==

If we attempt to build a densely packed collection of spheres, we will be tempted to always place the next sphere in a hollow between three packed spheres. If five spheres are assembled in this way, they will be consistent with one of the regularly packed arrangements described above. However, the sixth sphere placed in this way will render the structure inconsistent with any regular arrangement. This results in the possibility of a &quot;random close packing&quot; of spheres which is stable against compression. Vibration of a random loose packing can result in the arrangement of spherical particles into regular packings, a process known as granular crystallisation. Such processes depend on the geometry of the container holding the spherical grains.

When spheres are randomly added to a container and then compressed, they will generally form what is known as an &quot;irregular&quot; or &quot;jammed&quot; packing configuration when they can be compressed no more. This irregular packing will generally have a density of about 64%. Recent research predicts analytically that it cannot exceed a density limit of 63.4% This situation is unlike the case of one or two dimensions, where compressing a collection of 1-dimensional or 2-dimensional spheres (that is, line segments or circles) will yield a regular packing.

==Hypersphere packing==
The sphere packing problem is the three-dimensional version of a class of ball-packing problems in arbitrary dimensions. In two dimensions, the equivalent problem is packing circles on a plane. In one dimension it is packing line segments into a linear universe.

In dimensions higher than three, the densest lattice packings of hyperspheres are known up to 8 dimensions. Very little is known about irregular hypersphere packings; it is possible that in some dimensions the densest packing may be irregular. Some support for this conjecture comes from the fact that in certain dimensions (e.g. 10) the densest known irregular packing is denser than the densest known regular packing.

In 2016, Maryna Viazovska announced a proof that the E8 lattice provides the optimal packing (regardless of regularity) in eight-dimensional space, and soon afterwards she and a group of collaborators announced a similar proof that the Leech lattice is optimal in 24 dimensions. This result built on and improved previous methods which showed that these two lattices are very close to optimal.
The new proofs involve using the Laplace transform of a carefully chosen modular function to construct a radially symmetric function such that and its Fourier transform   both equal 1 at the origin, and both vanish at all other points of the optimal lattice, with negative outside the central sphere of the packing and positive. Then, the Poisson summation formula for   is used to compare the density of the optimal lattice with that of any other packing. Before the proof had been formally refereed and published, mathematician Peter Sarnak called the proof &quot;stunningly simple&quot; and wrote that &quot;You just start reading the paper and you know this is correct.&quot;

Another line of research in high dimensions is trying to find asymptotic bounds for the density of the densest packings. It is known that for large , the densest lattice in dimension has density formula_5 between (for some constant ) and . Conjectural bounds lie in between. In a 2023 preprint, Marcelo Campos, Matthew Jenssen, Marcus Michelen and Julian Sahasrabudhe improved the lower bound of the maximal density to formula_6, among their techniques they make use of the Rödl nibble.

==Unequal sphere packing==
Many problems in the chemical and physical sciences can be related to packing problems where more than one size of sphere is available. Here there is a choice between separating the spheres into regions of close-packed equal spheres, or combining the multiple sizes of spheres into a compound or interstitial packing. When many sizes of spheres (or a distribution) are available, the problem quickly becomes intractable, but some studies of binary hard spheres (two sizes) are available.

When the second sphere is much smaller than the first, it is possible to arrange the large spheres in a close-packed arrangement, and then arrange the small spheres within the octahedral and tetrahedral gaps. The density of this interstitial packing depends sensitively on the radius ratio, but in the limit of extreme size ratios, the smaller spheres can fill the gaps with the same density as the larger spheres filled space. Even if the large spheres are not in a close-packed arrangement, it is always possible to insert some smaller spheres of up to 0.29099 of the radius of the larger sphere.

When the smaller sphere has a radius greater than 0.41421 of the radius of the larger sphere, it is no longer possible to fit into even the octahedral holes of the close-packed structure. Thus, beyond this point, either the host structure must expand to accommodate the interstitials (which compromises the overall density), or rearrange into a more complex crystalline compound structure. Structures are known which exceed the close packing density for radius ratios up to 0.659786.

Upper bounds for the density that can be obtained in such binary packings have also been obtained.

In many chemical situations such as ionic crystals, the stoichiometry is constrained by the charges of the constituent ions. This additional constraint on the packing, together with the need to minimize the Coulomb energy of interacting charges leads to a diversity of optimal packing arrangements.

The upper bound for the density of a strictly jammed sphere packing with any set of radii is 1an example of such a packing of spheres is the Apollonian sphere packing. The lower bound for such a sphere packing is 0an example is the Dionysian sphere packing.

==Hyperbolic space==
Although the concept of circles and spheres can be extended to hyperbolic space, finding the densest packing becomes much more difficult. In a hyperbolic space there is no limit to the number of spheres that can surround another sphere (for example, Ford circles can be thought of as an arrangement of identical hyperbolic circles in which each circle is surrounded by an infinite number of other circles). The concept of average density also becomes much more difficult to define accurately. The densest packings in any hyperbolic space are almost always irregular.

Despite this difficulty, K. Böröczky gives a universal upper bound for the density of sphere packings of hyperbolic &quot;n&quot;-space where &quot;n&quot; ≥ 2. In three dimensions the Böröczky bound is approximately 85.327613%, and is realized by the horosphere packing of the order-6 tetrahedral honeycomb with Schläfli symbol {3,3,6}. In addition to this configuration at least three other horosphere packings are known to exist in hyperbolic 3-space that realize the density upper bound.

==Touching pairs, triplets, and quadruples==
The contact graph of an arbitrary finite packing of unit balls is the graph whose vertices correspond to the packing elements and whose two vertices are connected by an edge if the corresponding two packing elements touch each other. The cardinality of the edge set of the contact graph gives the number of touching pairs, the number of 3-cycles in the contact graph gives the number of touching triplets, and the number of tetrahedrons in the contact graph gives the number of touching quadruples (in general for a contact graph associated with a sphere packing in &quot;n&quot; dimensions that the cardinality of the set of &quot;n&quot;-simplices in the contact graph gives the number of touching (&quot;n&quot; + 1)-tuples in the sphere packing). In the case of 3-dimensional Euclidean space, non-trivial upper bounds on the number of touching pairs, triplets, and quadruples were proved by Karoly Bezdek and Samuel Reid at the University of Calgary.

The problem of finding the arrangement of &quot;n&quot; identical spheres that maximizes the number of contact points between the spheres is known as the &quot;sticky-sphere problem&quot;. The maximum is known for &quot;n&quot; ≤ 11, and only conjectural values are known for larger &quot;n&quot;.

==Other spaces==
Sphere packing on the corners of a hypercube (with Hamming balls, spheres defined by Hamming distance) corresponds to designing error-correcting codes: if the spheres have radius &quot;t&quot;, then their centers are codewords of a (2&quot;t&quot; + 1)-error-correcting code. Lattice packings correspond to linear codes. There are other, subtler relationships between Euclidean sphere packing and error-correcting codes. For example, the binary Golay code is closely related to the 24-dimensional Leech lattice.

For further details on these connections, see the book &quot;Sphere Packings, Lattices and Groups&quot; by Conway and Sloane.

<text>Bahadur Shah II (born Mirza Abu Zafar Siraj-ud-din Muhammad (24 October 1775 – 7 November 1862), usually referred to by his poetic title Bahadur Shah &quot;Zafar&quot; (; &quot;Zafar&quot; ), was the twentieth and last Mughal emperor and a Hindustani poet. He was the second son and the successor to his father, Akbar II, who died in 1837. He was a titular Emperor, as the Mughal Empire existed in name only and his authority was limited only to the walled city of Old Delhi (Shahjahanbad). Following his involvement in the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British deposed him and exiled him to Rangoon in British-controlled Burma in late 1858, after convicting him on several charges. The title of Empress of India was subsequently assumed by Queen Victoria (but only after 1876).

Bahadur Shah Zafar&#x27;s father, Akbar II, had been imprisoned by the British and he was not his father&#x27;s preferred choice as his successor. One of Akbar Shah&#x27;s queens pressured him to declare her son, Mirza Jahangir, as his successor. However, the East India Company exiled Jahangir after he attacked their resident in the Red Fort, paving the way for Bahadur Shah to assume the throne.

==Reign==


Bahadur Shah Zafar ruled over a Mughal Empire that had by the early 19th century been reduced to only the city of Delhi and the surrounding territory as far as Palam. The Maratha Empire had brought an end to the Mughal Empire in the Deccan during the 18th century and the regions of India formerly under Mughal rule had either been absorbed by the Marathas or had declared independence and become smaller kingdoms. The Marathas installed Shah Alam II in the throne in 1772, under the protection of the Maratha general Mahadaji Shinde and maintained suzerainty over Mughal affairs in Delhi. The East India Company became the dominant political and military power in mid-nineteenth century India. Outside the region controlled by the company, hundreds of kingdoms and principalities fragmented their land. The emperor was respected by the company, who provided him with a pension. The emperor permitted the company to collect taxes from Delhi and maintain a military force in it. Zafar never had any interest in statecraft or had any &quot;imperial ambition&quot;. After the Indian Rebellion of 1857, the British exiled him from Delhi.

Bahadur Shah Zafar was a noted Urdu poet, having written a number of Urdu &quot;ghazals&quot;. While some part of his opus was lost or destroyed during the Indian Rebellion of 1857, a large collection did survive, and was compiled into the &quot;Kulliyyat-i-Zafar.&quot; The court that he maintained was home to several renowned Urdu scholars, poets and writers including Mirza Ghalib, Daagh Dehlvi, Momin Khan Momin, and Mohammad Ibrahim Zauq (who was also Bahadur Shah Zafar&#x27;s mentor).

After Zafar&#x27;s defeat, he said:
&lt;poem&gt;

&quot;Hinduyoñ meñ bū rahe gī jab talak īmān kī&quot;
As long as there remains the scent of Iman in the hearts of Hindus (Indians),

&quot;Takht-i-Landan tak chale gī tegh-i-Hindostān kī.&quot;
So long shall the sword of Hindustan flash before the throne of London.

&lt;/poem&gt;

==1857 Rebellion==
As the Indian Rebellion of 1857 spread, Sepoy regiments reached the Mughal Court at Delhi. 

On 12 May 1857, Zafar held his first formal audience in several years. It was attended by several sepoys who were described as treating him &quot;familiarly or disrespectfully&quot;. When the sepoys first arrived at Bahadur Shah Zafar&#x27;s court, he asked them why they had come to him, because he had no means of maintaining them. Bahadur Shah Zafar&#x27;s conduct was indecisive. However, he yielded to the demands of the sepoys when he was told that they would not be able to win against the East India Company without him.

On 16 May, sepoys and palace servants killed fifty-two Europeans who were prisoners of the palace and who were discovered hiding in the city. The executions took place under a peepul tree in front of the palace, despite Zafar&#x27;s protests. The aim of the executioners was to implicate him in the killings. Once he had joined them, Bahadur Shah II took ownership for all the actions of the mutineers. Though dismayed by the looting and disorder, he gave his public support to the rebellion. It was later believed that Bahadur Shah was not directly responsible for the massacre, but that he may have been able to prevent it, and he was therefore considered a consenting party during his trial.

The administration of the city and its new occupying army was described as &quot;chaotic and troublesome&quot;, which functioned &quot;haphazardly&quot;. The Emperor nominated his eldest son, Mirza Mughal, as the commander in chief of his forces. However, Mirza Mughal had little military experience and was rejected by the sepoys. The sepoys did not have any commander since each regiment refused to accept orders from someone other than their own officers. Mirza Mughal&#x27;s administration extended no further than the city. Outside Gujjar herders began levying their own tolls on traffic, and it became increasingly difficult to feed the city.

During the Siege of Delhi when the victory of the British became certain, Zafar took refuge at Humayun&#x27;s Tomb, in an area that was then at the outskirts of Delhi. Company forces led by Major William Hodson surrounded the tomb and Zafar was captured on 20 September 1857. The next day, Hodson shot his sons Mirza Mughal and Mirza Khizr Sultan, and grandson Mirza Abu Bakht under his own authority at the Khooni Darwaza, near the Delhi Gate and declared Delhi to be captured. Bahadur Shah himself was taken to his wife&#x27;s &quot;haveli&quot;, where he was treated disrespectfully by his captors. When brought news of the executions of his sons and grandson, the former emperor was described as being so shocked and depressed that he was unable to react.

==Trial==
The trial was a consequence of the Sepoy Mutiny and lasted for 21 days, had 19 hearings, 21 witnesses and over a hundred documents in Persian and Urdu, with their English translations, were produced in the court. At first the trial was suggested to be held at Calcutta, the place where Directors of East India company used to their sittings in connection with their commercial pursuits. But instead, the Red Fort in Delhi was selected for the trial. It was the first case to be tried at the Red Fort.

Zafar was tried and charged on four counts:
On the 20th day of the trial Bahadur Shah II defended himself against these charges. Bahadur Shah, in his defense, stated his complete haplessness before the will of the sepoys. The sepoys apparently used to affix his seal on empty envelopes, the contents of which he was absolutely unaware. While the emperor may have been overstating his impotence before the sepoys, the fact remains that the sepoys had felt powerful enough to dictate terms to anybody. The eighty-two-year old poet-king was harassed by the mutineers and was neither inclined to nor capable of providing any real leadership. Despite this, he was the primary accused in the trial for the rebellion.

Hakim Ahsanullah Khan, Zafar&#x27;s most trusted confidant and both his Prime Minister and personal physician, had insisted that Zafar did not involve himself in the rebellion and had surrendered himself to the British. But when Zafar ultimately did this, Hakim Ahsanullah Khan betrayed him by providing evidence against him at the trial in return for a pardon for himself.

Respecting Hodson&#x27;s guarantee on his surrender, Zafar was not sentenced to death but exiled to Rangoon, Burma. His wife Zeenat Mahal and some of the remaining members of the family accompanied him. At 4 am on 7 October 1858, Zafar along with his wives, two remaining sons began his journey towards Rangoon in bullock carts escorted by 9th Lancers under command of Lieutenant Ommaney.

==Death==

In 1862, at the age of 87, he reportedly acquired an illness. In October, his condition deteriorated. He was &quot;spoon-fed on broth&quot; but he found that difficult too by 3 November. On 6 November, the British Commissioner H.N. Davies recorded that Zafar &quot;is evidently sinking from pure desuetude and paralysis in the region of his throat&quot;. To prepare for his death Davies commanded for the collection of lime and bricks and a spot was selected at the &quot;back of Zafar&#x27;s enclosure&quot; for his burial. Zafar died on Friday, 7 November 1862 at 5 am. Zafar was buried at 4 pm near the Shwedagon Pagoda at 6 Ziwaka Road, near the intersection with Shwedagon Pagoda road, Yangon. The shrine of Bahadur Shah Zafar Dargah was built there after recovery of his tomb on 16 February 1991. Davies commenting on Zafar, described his life as &quot;very uncertain&quot;.

==Family and descendants==

Bahadur Shah Zafar had four wives and numerous concubines. His wives were:

*Begum Ashraf Mahal

Many individuals claim to be descendants of Bahadur Shah Zafar, living in places throughout India, such as Hyderabad, Aurangabad, Delhi, Bhopal, Kolkata, Bihar, and Bengaluru. However, the claims are often disputed.

==Religious beliefs==

Bahadur Shah Zafar was a devout Sufi. He was regarded as a Sufi Pir and used to accept &quot;murids&quot; or pupils. The newspaper &quot;Delhi Urdu Akhbaar&quot; described him as &quot;one of the leading saints of the age, approved of by the divine court.&quot; Before his accession, he lived like &quot;a poor scholar and dervish&quot;, differing from his three royal brothers, Mirza Jahangir, Salim and Babur. In 1828, a decade before he succeeded the throne, Major Archer said that &quot;Zafar is a man of spare figure and stature, plainly apparelled, almost approaching to meanness.&quot; His appearance is that of an indigent munshi or teacher of languages&quot;.

As a poet, Zafar imbibed the highest subtleties of mystical Sufi teachings. He was also a believer of the magical and superstitious side of the Orthodox Sufism. Like many of his followers, he believed that his position as both a Sufi pir and emperor gave him spiritual powers. In an incident in which one of his followers was bitten by a snake, Zafar tried to cure him by giving a &quot;seal of Bezoar&quot; (a stone antidote to poison) and some water on which he had breathed to the man to drink.

The emperor had a staunch belief in &quot;ta&#x27;aviz&quot; or charms, especially as a palliative for his constant complaint of piles, or to ward off evil spells. During a period of illness, he told a group of Sufi pirs that several of his wives suspected that someone had cast a spell over him. He requested them to take some steps to remove all apprehension on this account. The group wrote some charms and asked the emperor to mix them in water and drink it, which would protect him from the evil. A coterie of pirs, miracle workers and Hindu astrologers were always in touch with the emperor. On their advice, he would sacrifice buffaloes and camels, buried eggs and arrested alleged black magicians, and wore a ring that they told him would cure his indigestion. He also donated cows to the poor, elephants to the Sufi shrines and horses to the &quot;khadims&quot; or clergy of Jama Masjid.

In one of his verses, Zafar explicitly stated that both Hinduism and Islam shared the same essence. This philosophy was implemented by his court which embodied a multicultural composite Hindu-Islamic Mughal culture. He celebrated many Hindu festivals like Rakhi, Holi, Diwali etc in the court. Zafar was also tolerant of Shia Muslims who regained their lost influence at the Mughal court under him.

==Epitaph==
He was a prolific Urdu poet and calligrapher. He wrote the following Ghazal as his own epitaph. In his book, &quot;The Last Mughal&quot;, William Dalrymple states that, according to Lahore scholar Imran Khan, the beginning of the verse, &quot;umr-e-darāz māṅg ke&quot; (&quot;I asked for a long life&quot;) was not written by Zafar, and does not appear in any of the works published during Zafar&#x27;s lifetime. The verse was allegedly written by Simab Akbarabadi.

==In popular culture==

Zafar was portrayed in the play &quot;1857: Ek Safarnama&quot; set during the Indian Rebellion of 1857 by Javed Siddiqui. It was staged at Purana Qila, Delhi ramparts by Nadira Babbar and the National School of Drama repertory company in 2008. A Hindi-Urdu black-and-white movie, &quot;Lal Quila&quot; (1960), directed by Nanabhai Bhatt, showcased Bahadur Shah Zafar extensively.

===TV Serials and Films===
A television show, &quot;Bahadur Shah Zafar&quot;, aired on Doordarshan in 1986. Ashok Kumar played the lead role in it.

In the 2001 Hindi historical drama series &quot;1857 Kranti&quot;, on DD National, the character of Bahadur Shah Zafar was played by S. M. Zaheer.

In the 2005 Bollywood film &quot;Mangal Pandey: The Rising&quot;, directed by Ketan Mehta, the character of Bahadur Shah Zafar was played by Habib Tanveer.

<doc id="368630" wikidata="Q19545459" url="?curid=368630" title="Missa solemnis">
<text>is Latin for [[Solemn Mass]]. and is a genre of musical settings of the Mass Ordinary, which are festively scored and render the Latin text extensively, opposed to the more modest Missa brevis. In French, the genre is &quot;Messe solennelle&quot;. The terms came into use in the classical period.

When &quot;Missa solemnis&quot; is used as a name, without referring to a composer, Beethoven&#x27;s work is generally implied. Some of the greatest compositions in the genre have unique common names other than &quot;Missa solemnis&quot;—namely, Bach&#x27;s &quot;Mass in B minor&quot; and Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Great Mass in C minor&quot;. Some works are solemn settings in proportion and scoring, but are not called a &quot;Missa solemnis&quot;, for example several late settings of both Haydn and Schubert, and three settings by Anton Bruckner.

A solemn mass has been written by well-known composers including:
* Bach: &quot;Mass in B minor&quot; (1733/1749)
* Beethoven: &quot;Missa solemnis&quot; in D major (1823)
* Berlioz: &quot;Messe solennelle&quot; (1824)
* Bruckner: &quot;Missa solemnis&quot; in B flat minor (1854)
* Cherubini: &quot;Messa solenne&quot; &quot;Per il Principe Esterházy&quot; (1811)
* Haydn: &quot;Missa in tempore belli&quot; (Mass in the Time of War) in C major, (1796)
* Hummel: &quot;Missa solemnis&quot; in C major (1806)
* Liszt: &quot;Missa solennis zur Einweihung der Basilika in Gran (Gran Mass)&quot; (first version 1855, second version 1857–58)
* Mozart: &quot;Mass in C minor&quot;, K. 139 &quot;Waisenhaus&quot; (1768)
* Mozart: &quot;Mass in C major&quot;, K. 337 &quot;Solemnis&quot; (1780)
* Mozart: &quot;Great Mass in C minor&quot;, K. 427 (1782/1783)
* Rossini: &quot;Petite messe solennelle&quot; (1863)
* Schubert: Mass No. 1, Mass No. 4, Mass No. 5, Mass No. 6
* Vierne: &quot;Messe solennelle&quot;
* Weber: &quot;Missa solemnis No. 2&quot; (1818–1819) &quot;Messe du Freischutz&quot;

Other composers who wrote works titled &quot;Missa solemnis&quot; have included France Ačko (1941), Hendrik Andriessen (1946), Marco Betta, František Brixi, Antonio Buonomo (1983), Alfredo Casella (1944), Paul Creston, Georg Druschetzky (1804), Bohumil Fidler (1901), Joseph-Hector Fiocco, Konstanty Gorski, Michael Haydn (1772), Václav Emanuel Horák, Sigurd Islandsmoen (1954), Friedrich Kiel, Karel Blažej Kopřiva, Jean Langlais, Josef Lammerz (1990), Colin Mawby, Boleslaw Ocias, Antonio Sacchini, Johann Nepomuk Schelble, Wolfgang Seifen, Johann Baptist Wanhal (1778), and Bedřich Antonín Wiedermann (1848).

Festive mass settings in other languages include Jakub Jan Ryba&#x27;s Czech Christmas Mass.

<text>Mirza Mu&#x27;izz-ud-Din Beg Muhammad Khan (10 May 1661 – 11 February 1713), better known by his title Jahandar Shah (, ), was briefly the ninth Mughal emperor from 1712 to 1713. He was the son of Emperor Bahadur Shah I, and the grandson of Emperor Aurangzeb. 

Jahandar Shah was the first puppet ruler of the Mughal dynasty, having been placed on the throne by powerful noble Zulfiqar Khan. His reign was short and turbulent, lasting less than a year. He was deposed by the Sayyid brothers and succeeded by his nephew Farrukhsiyar.

==Early life==
Prince Mu&#x27;izz-ud-din was born on 10 May 1661 in Deccan Subah to Prince Mu&#x27;azzam. His mother Nizam Bai, the daughter of Fatehyawar Jang, was a noble from Hyderabad. He was Muazzam&#x27;s eldest son, and eldest grandson of reigning emperor Aurangzeb. Following Mughal tradition, his birth was grandly celebrated by the Mughal court. 

During Aurangzeb&#x27;s reign, he participated in military campaigning in the Deccan for three years, after which he was permanently shifted to northern India.

After Aurangzeb&#x27;s death, Prince Mu&#x27;azzam won the ensuing succession struggle and in June 1707, ascended the throne as Bahadur Shah. Upon his father&#x27;s accession, Mu&#x27;izz-ud-din was awarded the title Jahandar Shah, and made governor of Thatta and Multan. Through the course of Bahadur Shah&#x27;s reign, Jahandar Shah would stay at the imperial court, like the other sons of Bahadur Shah, because the emperor had ascended the throne at an old age, and the princes wanted to be within close reach of the throne in case of his demise.

== War of succession ==
A war of succession began as Bahadur Shah lay on his deathbed in 1712. The most powerful prince at the time of his death was his second son Azim-us-Shan, who had amassed significant resources as the s&quot;ubahdar&quot; of Bengal. Jahandar Shah was the weakest, with little-to-no military power or funds. 

Unlike previous Mughal wars of succession, the outcome of this war was engineered by a noble, Zulfiqar Khan, the &quot;mir bakhshi&quot; and one of the most powerful figures in the Mughal empire. He built an alliance between Jahandar Shah, and his younger brothers Rafi-us-Shan and Jahan Shah, proposing to them that they could divide the empire between them upon victory (with Zulfiqar Khan serving as their common &quot;mir bakhshi&quot;). Azim-us-Shan was defeated and killed, following which Jahandar Shah broke the alliance and turned on his brothers, defeating them and killing them with the help of Zulfiqar Khan, emerging as the victor of the succession struggle.

==Reign==
Jahandar Shah was crowned on 29 March, 1712. His accession was not well-supported in the empire, and he was viewed as an illegitimate ruler. Hence, upon his coronation, Jahandar Shah moved to consolidate his authority by rewarding and promoting his supporters. He departed from previous Mughal succession practices by severely punishing the nobles who had supported his brothers in the succession, with several of them being executed. He also let the bodies of the defeated princes rot in the open for several days before their entombment, unlike previous emperors who had insisted on a proper burial.

With Jahandar Shah&#x27;s accession, Zulfiqar Khan assumed the post of &quot;wazir&quot;. Due to Jahandar Shah&#x27;s complete dependence on him, and the circumstances of his accession to the throne, effective power was wielded not by the emperor but by Zulfiqar Khan himself. This was the first occurrence in Mughal history that absolute power over the empire was wielded by an outsider to the dynasty. As the effective ruler during Jahandar Shah&#x27;s reign, Zulfiqar Khan sought to establish amicable relationships with the Rajputs, Sikhs, and Marathas, and bring back peace in the empire. However, the empire&#x27;s finances were deteriorating, continuing a trend that had begun with Jahandar Shah&#x27;s predecessors, which decreased the empire&#x27;s military effectiveness. The excessive power enjoyed by Zulfiqar Khan caused Jahandar Shah to conspire against him, creating political chaos.

During his reign, Jahandar Shah married tawaif Lal Kunwar, who was considered to be of lowly origins; she became his favoured wife, and subsequently her family gained unprecedent power and status. Jahandar Shah also indulged in feasts and entertainments. Contemporary chroniclers and later historians have pointed out such aspects of the emperor&#x27;s personal life, and the cruelty meted to his opponents, as reasons behind the turbulence of his reign. However, recent scholars highlight other factors; Munis Faruqui emphasizes his political weakness as a prince, which set him up for failure as a ruler. Abhishek Kaicker notes that nobles had themselves became more self-interested around the time of Jahandar Shah&#x27;s accession, and that the &quot;cruelty&quot; of his reign was their defense for siding with Farrukhsiyar, who deposed Jahandar Shah.

=== Deposition ===
Jahandar Shah&#x27;s accession invited the challenge of his nephew Farrukhsiyar, the son of Azim-us-Shan, who was based in Bengal. With little independent resources, he unsuccessfully attempted to find backing for his bid. He eventually found powerful support in the Sayyid brothers, Husain Ali Khan and Abdullah Khan, administrators of Azim-us-Shan who had been removed from their postings by Jahandar Shah. With their resources and political connections, Farrukhsiyar assembled a rebel army and advanced on the throne. The underpaid imperial army was defeated in battle near Agra in early 1713.

==Death==
Upon defeat, Jahandar Shah fled to Delhi and sought refuge at the house of Zulfiqar Khan and his father Asad Khan. However, the two imprisoned him and turned him over to Farrukhsiyar, in hopes of securing his favour. Farrukhsiyar had both Jahandar Shah and Zulfiqar Khan executed, with Jahandar Shah being beaten to death and then beheaded on 11 February, 1713. Jahandar Shah&#x27;s body was paraded around Delhi in parts, hanging upside down from two elephants. He was buried in Humayun&#x27;s tomb.

==Marriages==
Jahandar Shah&#x27;s first wife was the daughter of Mirza Mukarram Khan Safavi. The marriage took place on 13 October 1676. After her death he married her niece, Sayyid-un-Nisa Begum, the daughter of Rustam Mirza, on 30 August 1684. Qazi Abu Sa&#x27;id united them in the presence of Emperor Aurangzeb, and Prince Mu&#x27;azzam. The marriage was consummated on 18 September. Sayyid-un-Nisa Begum was presented with jewels worth 67,000 rupees. The celebrations were supervised by Princess Zinat-un-nissa Begum.

== Full title ==
His full title was &quot;Shahanshah-i-Ghazi Abu&#x27;l Fath Mu&#x27;izz-ud-Din Muhammad Jahandar Shah Sahib-i-Qiran Padshah-i-Jahan (Khuld Aramgah)&quot;.

==Coins==
Jahandar Shah reintroduced couplets and issued coins in gold, silver, and copper. Two couplets i.e. Abu al-Fateh and Sahab Qiran were used. Copper coins were issued in both weight standard i.e. 20 grams and 14 grams.

<text>Laurentius Petri Nericius (1499 – 27 October 1573) was a Swedish clergyman and the first Evangelical Lutheran Archbishop of Sweden. He and his brother Olaus Petri are, together with the King Gustav Vasa, regarded as the main Lutheran reformers of Sweden. They are commemorated by the Evangelical Lutheran Church in America on 19 April.

== Early life ==
Laurentius was born Lars Persson in Örebro, Närke. Laurentius studied in Germany in 1520, possibly together with his brother. Here they took influence from Lutheranism, among other things they met with Martin Luther himself. On returning home to Stockholm, they got stranded and nearly lost their lives as the boat went ashore on the island of Gotland. They both survived however, and settled on the island, and Laurentius became headmaster at a school while Olaus became assistant to a priest. Not long after, Olaus travelled with the priest to Stockholm and the crowning of King Gustav Vasa. Subsequently, he managed to get on friendly terms with the King, and soon moved to Stockholm where he worked in the vicinity of the King.

== Archbishop ==
At the Uppsala Council of 1531, the Swedish king Gustav Vasa took the final step of breaking with the Roman Catholic Church, by personally appointing Laurentius as the new archbishop. On 22 September that year, Laurentius was consecrated archbishop by the Peder Månsson, Bishop of Västerås. Månsson was ordained bishop in Rome by Bishop Paris de Grassis, and by consecrating Laurentius the apostolic succession was retained in the Church of Sweden, which was considered important. But although the consecration took place according to Catholic ritual, those who officiated at the consecration made a secret declaration that they were acting under pressure.

Later that year Laurentius married Elisabeth Didriksdotter, a daughter of the King&#x27;s cousin becoming the first Swedish archbishop to be married. His brother Olaus had already become the first priest to marry in 1525.

The king forbade Laurentius to interfere with the reformation plans. Laurentius wisely defended the autonomy of the Church against the various ideas of Gustav, such as his wish to abolish all bishops, while still steady advancing and promoting the ideas of the reformation texts within Sweden. His main contribution were his abundant writings which laid the foundation for the Swedish Church Ordinance established at the Uppsala Council 1571.

He was archbishop for 42 years, unparalleled in Sweden, and during his time he was often in conflicts with the monarchs. In 1539 his brother Olaus was sentenced to death by the King over some arguments, and Laurentius was among those forced to sign the death sentence. It has been disputed whether Laurentius was doing this because of a weak character or if he thought it better to formally obey so that he could continue to spread the reformation ideas. Olaus did eventually get pardoned in 1542, much due to his influential friends, but he was forced to keep a low profile, leaving the role of main reformator solely to Laurentius.

==Diplomat==

Gustav I of Sweden entrusted Laurentius Petri to head the delegation who negotiated the Treaty of Novgorod (1557), which ended the Russo-Swedish War (1554–1557).

== Works ==
The first complete Swedish translation of the Bible was published in 1541, nicknamed the Vasa Bible after the King. Laurentius was one of the main proponents supervising the project, together with his brother Olaus and the clergyman Laurentius Andreae.

In the 1560s, when the ideas of Calvin gained in influence, Laurentius published several texts where he spoke for Lutheranism. It has been suggested that it was the first time the Swedish Church defined its Lutheran character.

== Family ==
His wife was Elizabeth Didriksdotter daughter of Didrik the Mint Master and Birgitta Kristiernsdotter Vasa (paternal cousin of Gustav I of Sweden). They were betrothed on 23 September 1531, after Laurentius Petri married Gustav I of Sweden to Catherine of Saxe-Lauenburg. Two daughters were born in the marriage: Margaret, who married Laurentius Petri Gothus (They had two daughters) and Magdalene, who married Abraham Angermannus.

<text>William Still (October 7, 1819 – July 14, 1902) was an African-American abolitionist based in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. He was a conductor of the Underground Railroad and was responsible for aiding and assisting at least 649 slaves to freedom. Still was also a businessman, writer, historian and civil rights activist. Before the American Civil War, Still was chairman of the Vigilance Committee of the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, named the Vigilant Association of Philadelphia. He directly aided fugitive slaves and also kept records of the people served in order to help families reunite.

After the war, Still continued as a prominent businessman, a coal merchant, and philanthropist. He used his meticulous records to write an account of the underground system and the experiences of many escaped slaves, entitled &quot;The Underground Railroad Records&quot; (1872).

==Household==
William Still was born in Shamong Township, Burlington County, New Jersey, to former slaves Charity (formerly named Sidney) and Levin Still. He was the youngest of eighteen children. His parents had migrated separately to New Jersey. First, his father had bought his freedom in 1798 from his master in Caroline County, Maryland, on the Eastern Shore and moved north to New Jersey. Levin stayed around in Maryland until 1805 in order to keep watch on his wife and children. After arriving in Evesham Township, they became friends with families named “Still” and assumed the last name in order to hide Charity’s fugitive status. 

His mother, Charity, escaped twice from Maryland. The first time, she and four children were all recaptured and returned to slavery. A few months later, Charity escaped again, taking only her two younger daughters with her, and reached her husband in New Jersey. Following her escape, Charity and Levin had 14 more children, of whom William was the youngest. Though these children were born in the free state of New Jersey, under Maryland and federal slave law, they were still legally slaves, as their mother was an escaped slave. According to New Jersey law, however, they were free. They settled in the Pine Barrens of New Jersey a small township named Shamong Township.

Neither Charity nor Levin could free their two older boys, who remained enslaved in Maryland. Levin, Jr., and Peter Still were sold from Maryland to slave owners in Lexington, Kentucky. Later they were resold to planters in Alabama in the Deep South. Levin, Jr., died from a whipping while enslaved. Peter, his wife &quot;Vina&quot;, and most of his family escaped from slavery when he was about age 50, with the help of two brothers named Friedman, who operated mercantile establishments in Florence, Alabama, and Cincinnati, Ohio. They were the subject of a book published in 1856.

Later Peter Still sought help at the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society, seeking to find his parents or other members of his birth family. He met William Still there, but initially had no idea they were related. As William listened to Peter&#x27;s story, he recognized the history his mother had told him many times. After learning that his older brother Levin was whipped to death for visiting his wife without permission, William shouted, &quot;What if I told you I was your brother!&quot; Later Peter and his mother were reunited after having been separated for 42 years.

Another of William&#x27;s brothers was James Still. Born in New Jersey in 1812, James wanted to become a doctor but said he &quot;was not the right color to enter where such knowledge was dispensed.&quot; James studied herbs and plants and apprenticed himself to a white doctor to learn medicine. He became known as the &quot;Black Doctor of the Pines&quot;, as he lived and practiced in the Medford Township, New Jersey. James&#x27;s son, James Thomas Still, was the third African-American to graduate from Harvard Medical School in 1871.

William&#x27;s other siblings included Levin, Jr.; Peter; James; Samuel; Mary, a teacher and missionary in the African Methodist Episcopal Church; Mahala (who married Gabriel Thompson); and Kitturah, who moved to Pennsylvania.

==Marriage and children==
In 1844, William Still moved from New Jersey to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. In 1847, the same year he was hired as a clerk for the Pennsylvania Society for the Abolition of Slavery, Still married Letitia George. They had four children who survived infancy. Their oldest was Caroline Virginia Matilda Still (1848–1919), one of the first Black women to become a physician in the United States. Caroline attended Oberlin College and the Women&#x27;s Medical College of Philadelphia (much later known as the Medical College of Pennsylvania). She married Edward J. Wiley. After he died, she married again, to the Reverend Matthew Anderson, longtime pastor of the Berean Presbyterian Church in North Philadelphia. She had an extensive private medical practice in Philadelphia and was also a community activist, teacher and leader.

William Wilberforce Still (1854–1932) graduated from Lincoln University and subsequently practiced law in Philadelphia. Robert George Still (1861–1896) became a journalist and owned a print shop on Pine at 11th Street in central Philadelphia. Frances Ellen Still (1857–1943) became a kindergarten teacher (she was named after poet Frances Ellen Watkins Harper, who had lived with the Stills before her marriage). According to the 1900 U.S. Census, William W., his wife, and Frances Ellen all lived in the same household as the elderly William Still and his wife, confirming the custom of extended families living together.

==Activism==
===Abolitionism===
In 1847, three years after settling in Philadelphia, Still began working as a clerk for the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society. When Philadelphia abolitionists organized a Vigilance Committee to directly aid escaped slaves who had reached the city, Still became its chairman. This led him and his wife Letitia to move to a relatively new rowhouse on the east side of Ronaldson Street between South and Bainbridge Streets, which still stands today at 625 S. Delhi Street. The Stills occupied this house, which was an Underground Railroad Way Station, from 1850 through 1855. It was here where Stills untied the box that carried Lear Green on her escape from Maryland in a steamer chest. Through his status as chairman of the Vigilance Committee, Still was one of the leaders of Philadelphia&#x27;s African-American community.

In 1855, he participated in the nationally covered rescue of Jane Johnson, a slave who sought help from the Society in gaining freedom while passing through Philadelphia with her master John Hill Wheeler, newly appointed US Minister to Nicaragua. Still and others liberated her and her two sons under Pennsylvania law, which held that slaves brought to the free state voluntarily by a slaveholder could choose freedom. Her master sued him and five other African-Americans for assault and kidnapping in a high-profile case in August 1855. Jane Johnson returned to Philadelphia from New York and testified in court as to her independence in choosing freedom, winning an acquittal for Still and four others, and reduced sentences for the last two men.

In 1859, Still challenged the segregation of the city&#x27;s public transit system, which had separate seating for whites and blacks. He kept lobbying and, in 1865, the Pennsylvania legislature passed a law to integrate streetcars across the state.

===Underground Railroad===
In his obituary, The &quot;New York Times&quot; proclaimed Still &quot;The Father of the Underground Railroad.&quot; William Still helped as many as 800 slaves escape to freedom. He interviewed each person and kept careful records, including a brief biography and the destination for each, along with any alias adopted. He kept his records carefully hidden but knew the accounts would be critical in aiding the future reunion of family members who became separated under slavery, which he had learned when he aided his own brother Peter, whom he had never met before.

Still worked with other Underground Railroad agents operating in the South, including in Virginia ports, nearby Delaware and Maryland, and in many counties in southern Pennsylvania. His network to freedom also included agents in New Jersey, New York, New England and Canada. William Still provided material support and encouragement for Harriet Tubman to begin her work as a conductor of the Underground Railroad. She traveled through his office with fellow passengers on several occasions during the 1850s. Still also forged a connection with the family of John Brown, and sheltered several of Brown&#x27;s associates fleeing the 1859 raid on Harpers Ferry.

===American Civil War and aftermath===

During the American Civil War, Still operated the post exchange at Camp William Penn, the training camp for United States Colored Troops north of Philadelphia. He also opened a stove store and in 1861 bought a coal yard and operated a coal delivery business, which he continued to operate after the war.

In 1867, Still published &quot;A Brief Narrative of the Struggle for the Rights of Colored People of Philadelphia in the City Railway Cars&quot;.

In 1872, Still published an account of the Underground Railroad, &quot;The Underground Railroad Records&quot;, based on the carefully recorded secret notes he had kept in diaries during those years. His book includes his impressions of station masters such as Thomas Garrett, Daniel Gibbons and Abigail Goodwin. It went through three editions and in 1876 was displayed at the Philadelphia Centennial Exhibition. Historians have since used it to understand how the Underground Railroad worked; both Project Gutenberg and the Internet archive make the text freely available.

===Business and philanthropy===
After the war, Still continued as an active businessman, philanthropist and social activist in the Philadelphia metropolitan areas.

In addition to the ongoing coal business, Still owned considerable real estate, including Liberty Hall, for some time the largest public hall in the U.S. owned by a black man. He also owned stock in the journal the &quot;Nation&quot;, was a member of Philadelphia&#x27;s Board of Trade, and financed and was officer of the Social and Civil Statistical Association of Philadelphia (which in part tracked freed people).

Still also remained active in the Colored Conventions Movement, having attended national conventions including the New England Colored Citizens&#x27; Convention of 1859, where he advocated for equal educational opportunities for all African Americans. He also advocated for temperance which motivated him to organize a mission Sabbath School for the Presbyterian Church. He was a member of the Freedmen&#x27;s Aid Union and Commission, an officer of the Philadelphia Home for the Aged and Infirm Colored Persons, and an elder in the Presbyterian church (where he established Sabbath Schools to promote literacy including among freed blacks).

He had a strong interest in the welfare of black youth. He helped to establish an orphanage and the first YMCA for African Americans in Philadelphia. In addition to continuing as member of the board for the Soldiers and Sailors Orphan Home and the Home for the Destitute Colored Children, Still became a trustable person at Storer College.

==Death, legacy and honors==
Still died July 14, 1902, at his home on 726 South 19th Street in Philadelphia. He was buried in Eden Cemetery in Collingdale, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, as would later be his wife and daughter. Founded just a month before Still&#x27;s death, Eden Cemetery is now the nation&#x27;s oldest African-American owned cemetery, and on the National Register of Historic Places since 2010. In March 2018, Still&#x27;s residence of 1850–1855 was identified and placed on the Philadelphia Register of Historic Places.

===Descendants===
Family members donated his papers, including personal papers 1865–1899, to the Charles L. Blockson Afro-American Collection at Temple University Library, where they remain accessible to researchers.

Peter lived (b. 1801- d.1868) in Burlington Township, New Jersey. Dr. James (b.1812- d. 1882) resided in Medford, New Jersey. Dr. James Still&#x27;s descendants include the WNBA basketball player Valerie Still and her brother, NFL defensive end Art Still, and Devon Still, former NFL defensive end with the Houston Texans. It has been assumed for many years that all the Still family members were blood related but through research and DNA testing there are definitely different progeny of the Still family.

===National Underground Railroad Network===
In 1997, Congress passed H.R. 1635, which President Bill Clinton signed into law, and which authorized the United States National Park Service to establish the National Underground Railroad Network to Freedom program to identify associated sites and popularize the Underground Railroad. This also affirmed Still&#x27;s national importance as a leading Underground Railroad agent in a major center of abolition.

<doc id="368650" wikidata="Q381010" url="?curid=368650" title="Olaus Petri">
<text>Olof Persson, sometimes Petersson (6 January 1493 – 19 April 1552), better known under the Latin form of his name, Olaus Petri (or less commonly, Olavus Petri), was a clergyman, writer, judge, and major contributor to the Protestant Reformation in Sweden. His brother, Laurentius Petri (Lars Persson), became the first Evangelical Lutheran Archbishop of Sweden.

==Early life==
Born in Örebro, in south-central Sweden, and the son of Peter Olofsson (a local blacksmith) and Kristina Larsdotter, Olaus Petri learned to read and write at the local Carmelite monastery. He then went to the capital and studied at the University of Uppsala, studying theology and German. Later, he attended the University of Leipzig until 1516, and finally finished his education and received a Master&#x27;s degree at the University of Wittenberg in February 1518. While in Wittenberg with his younger brother Lars, Olaus met with and was influenced by the main characters of the German reformation, Philipp Melanchthon and Martin Luther.

==Career==
Both Petri brothers returned to Sweden in 1519, nearly dying as their ship ran aground on Gotland island during a storm. They remained on Gotland for a while, with Olaus preaching and assisting the local priest, Soren Norby, and Lars teaching at the local school. In 1520, Olaus returned to Strängnäs on the mainland, accepting ordination as a deacon and serving bishop Mattias Gregersson Lilje as secretary, chancellor of the Diocese of Strängnäs, canon of the Strängnäs Cathedral and dean of the cathedral school.

Olaus accompanied Mattias to Stockholm and attended the tumultuous crowning of Danish King Christian II, who had captured Stockholm and held it for about a year until returning to Denmark, where he was soon deposed and replaced by his uncle, who became King Frederick I of Denmark. Meanwhile, at the notorious Stockholm Bloodbath in early November, King Christian violated his promises of a general amnesty for the Sture party, and during the post-coronation festivities arrested and executed 80–90 churchmen and secular Swedish nobles, including Bishop Mattias. When Olaus expressed his outrage, he was almost executed as well, but a German who had seen him in Wittenberg identified Olaus as a fellow German and thus saved his life. King Christian tried to appoint his friend and bishop of Odense, Jens Andersen Beldenak, to the now-vacant Strängnäs bishopric, but both Danes soon returned to Denmark, and the scholar-priest Laurentius Andreae, who had been named archdeacon in 1520, ran the diocese.

The massacre provoked the Swedish War of Liberation, including the election and crowning of Gustav Vasa as King of Sweden, in Strängnäs in 1523. Olaus (whose father died in 1521, after which he and his brother had joined the insurgents under Vasa&#x27;s leadership) attended the coronation, swore fealty to his monarch, and soon became the kingdom&#x27;s chancellor. A year later, Olaus was appointed Stockholm&#x27;s town secretary and moved to the capital, where he also served as a judge (despite a lack of specific legal training) and town councilor.

Olaus became known for his advocacy of Lutheranism and criticism of the prevailing Roman Catholicism. In October 1524, the Uppsala Cathedral&#x27;s chapter excommunicated both brothers on grounds of heresy. They remained, however, confident in the new Swedish king&#x27;s strong support. In 1525, Olaus married, as Lutheran practice permitted, and also implemented another of Luther&#x27;s ideas by having the mass sung in Swedish for the first time. Throughout this period Olaus was also involved in scholarly endeavours, including translating Lutheran works into Swedish. In 1526, Olaus published the first Swedish translation of the New Testament, and also published a catechism in Swedish.

The Petri brothers&#x27; efforts to teach their king and fellow Swedes about Luther&#x27;s ideas bore fruit the following year, as the Diet of Västerås declared Sweden Lutheran. In 1531, Olaus published a slightly simplified version of the Catholic mass in Swedish. Vasa also confirmed the kingdom&#x27;s Lutheran alignment in 1531 by appointing Lars (who had been ordained a priest in 1527 and had married a daughter of the king&#x27;s cousin that year) Archbishop of Uppsala, in part because the Pope refused to acknowledge the consecration of his candidate as bishop of Strängnäs, Magnus Sommar (1528–36; ultimately deposed and forced into retirement by the king).

Contemporaries described Olaus as energetic and pushy, particularly about matters in which he believed strongly. He also wrote a Swedish hymnal, liturgical manual, and many homiletic and polemic tracts. In fact, some consider the brothers and their ally Laurentius Andreae (who had physically crowned Gustav Vasa king in 1523) responsible for most early Swedish printed literature. Olaus also wrote a Chronicle of Sweden, which despite some historical inaccuracies, contains many interesting facts and anecdotes and remains an important historical document. Olaus also had an important part in translating the whole Bible into the vernacular; the Gustav Vasa Bible was completed circa 1541.

In 1539, Olaus Petri was ordained a priest, as permitted under Luther&#x27;s reforms, and perhaps influenced by the Sun dog phenomenon of 20 April 1535 which caused Olaus to commission the mystical painting Vädersolstavlan and preach some apocalyptic sermons. However, shortly after his ordination, Olaus&#x27; relationship with King Gustav deteriorated sharply. Olaus was arrested and put on trial for treason, supposedly because he had learned about a conspiracy against the King during confession and had not revealed it. One historian suggests that Olaus&#x27; writings criticizing the King&#x27;s harsh punishments and taxation policies contributed to the criminal trial. King Gustav also wanted to control the church, while Olaus distrusted the king&#x27;s autocratic tendencies and supported religious self-governance. After Olaus Petri and Laurentius Andreae were found guilty on January 2, 1540, both received death sentences, and even his brother Lars signed the judgment. However, after much bargaining and many requests, friends managed to get both clergymen released on bail (Stockholm&#x27;s merchants contributing to pay the stiff fines), although clearly their political careers had ended.

Olaus received a royal pardon in 1542, possibly as a reward for completing the massive biblical translation project, and in that year was appointed inspector over Stockholm&#x27;s schools. The following year, he was promoted to dean of St. Nicholas&#x27; Church (Storkyrkan) in Stockholm, and fulfilled that priestly position during the final nine years of his life.

==Death and legacy==

Olaus Petri was buried at Storkyrkan, which became the national cathedral (supplanting Uppsala Cathedral) two centuries later. Since 1898, a large plaque and statue outside Storkyrkan have commemorated the reformer. His younger brother Lars survived him by two decades, completing the Swedish church&#x27;s alignment with Lutheran (contrasted with Calvinist) reformed practices.

In 1616, long after his death, the &quot;Rule for Judges&#x27; Associations&quot; was published, which is now thought to have been written circa 1520–1540 and has long been attributed to Olaus Petri. These 42 general rules, a mixture of common law and statutes, have formed the basis of Scandinavian legal traditions, particularly in Sweden and Finland. In the law of Finland, they are always included in the introduction section of legal codices, despite never having been enacted as binding law. Although some aspects seem outdated (particularly overt religious references), Olaus&#x27; twin values of legal certainty, and equity and justice, remain important to Nordic legal scholarship and practice. Part of the problem in assessing his life, however, is that accounts of the trial which ended his legal career were also published long after his death by Vasa&#x27;s chronicler, Erik Jöransson Tegel.

The Evangelical Lutheran Church in America remembers the brothers jointly with a liturgical commemoration on 19 April, the anniversary of his death.

Olaus Petri is the main character of August Strindberg&#x27;s play &quot;Master Olof&quot; (Swedish title: &quot;Mäster Olof&quot;), the five-hour-long première of which opened on 30 December 1881.

His collected works (Samlade skrifter av Olavus Petri) were published in Uppsala (1913–1917).

<doc id="368659" wikidata="Q3539246" url="?curid=368659" title="Trimontium (Newstead)">
<text>Trimontium was a Roman fort complex located at Newstead, near Melrose, in the Scottish Borders, in view of the three Eildon Hills which probably gave its name (Latin: &quot;trium montium&quot;, three hills).

It was occupied intermittently from about 79 to 184 AD and was the largest of the &quot;outpost&quot; forts after the construction of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall in the 120s AD. It was located 60 miles north of the wall on the extension of Dere Street the main Roman route to the north, initially in seemingly &quot;hostile&quot; territory. Trimontium was about three times larger than any fort on Hadrian&#x27;s Wall and by 180 became the most northerly settlement of the whole Roman Empire.

Trimontium is also considered of international importance as the site of one of the largest caches of Roman military objects in Britain, found in 117 pits.

It was identified by Roman geographer Ptolemy in his &quot;Geography.&quot;

The fort sits on the banks of the River Tweed, with the Eildon Hills and the Iron Age hillfort atop Eildon North, a visible reminder of both the local population and imposing landscape of the Scottish Borders. The location benefitted from the rivers Tweed and Leader providing routes for the movement of goods and people and from the Roman road that became Dere Street passing alongside the fort.

==Historical background==

It took the Romans almost four decades, from the invasion of 43 AD and subsequent conquest of southern &amp; eastern Britain, followed by expansion into northern England and Wales, for them to be closing in on southern Scotland when the fort was first constructed.

In 79 AD Roman general Agricola moved against the Brigantes of northern England and the Selgovae along the southern coast of Scotland, using overwhelming military power to establish Roman control. He built a network of military roads and forts, including Trimontium, to secure the Roman occupation. Existing forts were strengthened and new ones planted in northeastern Scotland along the Highland Line, consolidating control of the glens that provided access to and from the Scottish Highlands. The line of military communication and supply across southeastern Scotland and northeastern England was Dere Street (on which Trimontium was located) which was well-fortified.

After Agricola was recalled from Britain in 84 AD the Romans retired from northerm Scotland to a more defensible line along the Forth–Clyde isthmus.

Around 105 there appears to have been a serious setback at the hands of the tribes of the Picts: several Roman forts were destroyed by fire, with human remains and damaged armour at Trimontium indicating hostilities. Trimontium was abandoned and in the 120s Hadrian established the frontier further south by building his wall.

The fort&#x27;s fortunes mirrored that of the later Roman expansion and retreat in the area, as its role swung from frontier post beyond Hadrian&#x27;s Wall to supply and logistical waypoint for the Antonine Wall after 136, and back to frontier outpost from 164.

From its first construction phase in c.80 AD through to the last occupation and retreat shortly after 180 the fort would have been a focal point and centre of activity for both Romans and locals alike. The local Iron Age population, living in family farmsteads across the region, and gathering at times within the network of hillforts across the landscape would have had to develop a range of strategies to exist within or alongside the Roman presence. These could vary from alliance and trade to dispute and warfare.

==The Fort==


The fort was constructed in multiple phases. Dr Simon Clarke of Bradford University has produced a logical sequence of building and destruction for the fort and its annexes. This was managed by combining evidence from the first excavations of James Curle and Sir Ian Richmond with aerial photographs and modern search and rescue excavations of Bradford University (1987–1997)

Phase 1 (c.79-87 AD): The earliest occupation of the site identified by aerial photographs since the 1940s have revealed at least three and possibly as many as five camps in this area. The enormous &quot;Great Camp&quot; identified by Curle was on the highest point of the ridge at the centre of the whole enclosure, commanding a view over the road from the Cheviots, and across the Leader valley to control the crossing of the river. It had an area of 49 acres and each of its 4 gates had a &quot;titulus&quot;, a long straight ditch for defence, dug in front of it. Its size means it must have been constructed for a large, probably legionary, force and its occupation must have been of short duration. In Scotland the only excavated camp that compares with it in size is the legionary fort at Inchtuthil of 56 acres. In Wales, Caerleon of 50 acres occupied by the Second Legion, corresponds closely in area.

The later smaller Agricolan fort was built to the west of the Great Camp about 80 AD by the Legio XX Valeria Victrix mentioned on many of the inscriptions. It had a turf rampart on a cobble foundation with two ditches in front of it, overlapping each entrance. On the west side was an annexe which was also defended by a similar rampart and ditches arrangement.

Phase 2 (c.90-105 AD): After a possible short abandonment of the fort, the Romans were back, and building in strength. Old ditches were filled in and new defences constructed. This resulted in a colossal strengthening of the fort. The new turf rampart was built on a cobble base which measured 13.5 m across and around 8.4 m high. In front of this was a single ditch between 5 &amp; 7 m wide and 2 to 4 m deep. New, well defended annexes appear on the south, east and probably north sides of the fort, inhabited by civilians and camp followers.

Phase 3 (c.105-137 AD): Trimontium was deserted as the Roman occupiers retreated south of Hadrian&#x27;s Wall.

Phase 4 (c.137-139 AD): Clarke suggests that evidence points to the possibility that the fort was reoccupied a few years prior to the 140 AD advances into Caledonia by Emperor Antoninus Pius. If this is the case, the fort would have been a formidable outpost beyond Hadrian&#x27;s Wall, with a civilian population within the annexes. Excavations and modern archaeology show the main entrance is now positioned through the southern annexe.

Phase 5 (c.140-158 AD): As the Roman presence pressed northwards and work began on the Antonine Wall (from 142 AD), the role of Trimontium changed. It was reduced in size with the building of a 2 m thick masonry wall through the main fort, though at the same time stone was used in the rebuilding. Manufacturing was becoming an important role for this newly purposed supply and logistics centre. Now behind the front line, it is believed that the civilian population attached to the fort may have numbered some 2–3,000.

Phase 6 (c.160 AD): Around this time the previous construction of the subdividing wall was removed as Trimontium&#x27;s role changed from supply and manufacture to a front line fort due in part to the abandonment of the Antonine Wall. Within the fort a long, narrow barrack block was constructed and evidence points to a large decrease in the civilian population surrounding the fort.

Phase 7 (c.160-184 AD): As the civilian population surrounding and supporting the fort diminished further, the land that housed the annexes returned to a more natural state. The military presence reduced further, with the barrack block now housing the remaining soldiers and their families. The evidence points to the fort being deserted some time around 180 AD. It is unclear whether the remaining civilian population left at this time or remained, outside or even inside the fort. Evidence does point to the potential use of early 3rd and late 4th century coins in the area (coins have been found to the south and to the west of Newstead village). The local population may still have engaged in a Romanised trade and economic pattern of behaviour.

Evidence from the site indicate the presence of a considerable cavalry contingent at Trimontium. The list of such archaeological finds is extensive and includes horse skeletons, multiple parts of horse tack or harnesses, outstanding decorated cavalry parade helmets and face masks that can be seen at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh, and intriguingly the prospect of a gyrus, or training ring.

During these phases of occupation, the population of the fort varied considerably, the permanent garrison level was probably around 1000 but this number would be complemented by the trades, manufacturers, craftsmen and families associated with the camp during the different phases of occupation. It has been estimated that the number could have risen to anywhere between 2000–5000.

==Site archaeology==
The earliest modern reference to the archaeological significance of Trimontium stems from finds uncovered during mid-Victorian railway cutting works as part of the Waverley Line construction in 1846. As land to the east of the village of Newstead was worked, finds from pits full of Roman artefacts were uncovered.

Excavations by James Curle between February 1905 and September 1910 began the first exploration of the site, making many findings. These include foundations of successive forts described earlier, which throw much light on the character of this site, an unparalleled collection of Roman armour, including ornate cavalry parade (or &#x27;sports&#x27;) helmets, horse fittings including bronze saddleplates and studded leather chamfrons, numerous artefacts associated with trade and manufacture, building and construction, and daily life on the Roman frontier. In 1911 Curle published his archaeological findings in &#x27;A Roman Frontier Post and its People&#x27;. This volume quickly became a standard reference work, ahead of its time and still the most decisive work published in Scotland covering this period of Roman occupation, expansion and retreat.

Sir Ian Richmond undertook small scale excavations and some re-interpretations of Curle&#x27;s work in 1947. At this time, with the advent and development of aerial photography as a tool in modern archaeological research, Dr Kenneth St Joseph’s work at Trimontium revealed up to nine temporary encampments, evidenced through cropmarkings.

In 1989 The Newstead Project began, a 5-year archaeological investigation undertaken by the Department of Archaeological Sciences of Bradford University. Initially under the direction of Dr. Rick Jones, and thereafter Dr. Simon Clarke, the project employed the most modern archaeological techniques to the Trimontium site for the first time. Clarke uncovered forty major archaeological features in his 1994 &#x27;rescue excavation&#x27;, including six deep pits containing a wealth of organic material. In 1996 he returned to the site to examine the suspected amphitheatre and suspected north annexe, and in 1997 the Bradford University team completed the geophysics survey of the Trimontium site.

==Museums==

The Trimiontium Trust run a museum local to the Trimontium site in the nearby town of Melrose. The museum&#x27;s £1.4 million redevelopment was part of a project supported by the National Lottery Heritage Fund to enhance and extend the galleries, displays and interpretation of Trimontium&#x27;s history. The trust carry out guided walks to the Trimontium site, run a lecture and talk series, undertake activities linked to local community events, and present school and family workshops.

Many of the original and later finds from Trimontium are of such quality and importance that they are displayed at the National Museum of Scotland in Edinburgh. Items such as the cavalry helmets and decorative face mask, horse chamfron, leather work and much else besides can be seen as well as other Roman finds.

The Trimontium Trust museum redevelopment project has seen key finds return to the vicinity of the original fort site &amp; archaeological excavations. They are housed within this contemporary museum setting which extends, redesigns, reinterprets and re-displays objects telling the story of Trimontium and its relationship with the local population.

<doc id="368663" wikidata="Q453972" url="?curid=368663" title="John Collier (painter)">
<text>John Maler Collier (; 27 January 1850 – 11 April 1934) was a British painter and writer. He painted in the Pre-Raphaelite style, and was one of the most prominent portrait painters of his generation. Both of his marriages were to daughters of Thomas Henry Huxley. He was educated at Eton College, and he studied painting in Paris with Jean-Paul Laurens and at the Munich Academy starting in 1875.

==Family==

Collier was from a talented and successful family. His grandfather, John Collier, was a Quaker merchant who became a member of parliament. His father, Robert, (was a member of parliament, Attorney General and, for many years, a full-time judge of the Privy Council) was created the first Lord Monkswell. Collier was a member of the New Society of Artists as well as the Royal Society of British Artists. He had artists&#x27; studios in his home at 7 Chelsea Embankment for the use of John and his wife Marion. John Collier&#x27;s elder brother, the second Lord Monkswell, was Under-Secretary of State for War and Chairman of the London County Council.

In due course, Collier became an integral part of the family of Thomas Henry Huxley PC, President of the Royal Society from 1883 to 1885. Collier married two of Huxley&#x27;s daughters and was &quot;on terms of intimate friendship&quot; with his son, the writer Leonard Huxley. Collier&#x27;s first wife, in 1879, was Marian Huxley (Mady). She was a painter who studied, like her husband, at the Slade and exhibited at the Royal Academy and elsewhere. In 1881, the couple settled in Tite Street, Chelsea, in a purpose-built studio house, alongside their friend Anna Lea Merritt. After the birth of their only childa daughter, Joyce, Marian suffered severe post-natal depression and was taken to Paris for treatment where, however, she contracted pneumonia and died in 1887. Joyce became a portrait miniaturist and was a member of the Royal Society of Miniature Painters.

In 1889 Collier married Mady&#x27;s younger sister Ethel Huxley. Until the Deceased Wife&#x27;s Sister&#x27;s Marriage Act 1907 such a marriage was not possible in England, so the ceremony took place in Norway. By his second wife he had a daughter and a son, Sir Laurence Collier, who was the British Ambassador to Norway 1941–1951.

==Subjects==
Collier&#x27;s range of portrait subjects was broad. In 1893, for example, his subjects included Lovelace Stamer, Bishop of Shrewsbury; Sir John Lubbock FRS; A N Hornby (Captain of the Lancashire Eleven); Edward Augustus Inglefield (Admiral and Arctic explorer).

His commissioned portrait of the Duke of York (later George V) as Master of Trinity House in 1901, and the Prince of Wales (later Edward VIII) were his major royal portraits. The latter work was hung in Durbar Hall, Jodhpur, Rajputana.

Other subjects included two Lord Chancellors (the Earl of Selborne in 1882 and the Earl of Halsbury) in 1897; The Speaker of the House of Commons, William Gully, (1897); senior legal figures the Lord Chief Justice Lord Alverstone (1912) and the Master of the Rolls Sir George Jessel (1881).

Rudyard Kipling (1891); the painter Sir Lawrence Alma-Tadema (1884); the actors J.L. Toole (1887) and Madge Kendal, Ellen Terry and Herbert Beerbohm Tree (in &quot;The Merry Wives of Windsor&quot;) (1904); heads of educational institutions such as the Master of Balliol Edward Caird (1904), the Warden of Wadham G.E. Thorley (1889) and the Provost of Eton (1897) were also subjects for Collier. His portraits also include those of soldiers such as Field Marshal Lord Kitchener of Khartoum (1911) and Field Marshal Sir Frederick Haines (1891); two Indian maharajahs, including the Maharajah of Nepal (1910); and scientists including Charles Darwin (1882), the artist&#x27;s father-in-law Professor Huxley (1891), William Kingdom Clifford, James Prescott Joule and Sir Michael Foster (1907). Clark reports a total of thirty-two Huxley family portraits during the half-century after his first marriage.

A photocopy of John Collier&#x27;s &quot;Sitters Book&quot; (made in 1962 from the original in the possession of the artist&#x27;s son) can be consulted in the Heinz Archive and Library, National Portrait Gallery. This is the artist&#x27;s own handwritten record of all his portraits, including name of subject, date, fee charged, and details of any major exhibitions of the picture in question.

==Posthumous reputation==


Collier died in 1934. His entry in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot; (volume for 1931–40, published 1949) compares his work to that of Frank Holl because of its solemnity. This is only true, however, of his many portraits of distinguished old men – his portraits of younger men, women and children, and his so-called &quot;problem pictures&quot;, covering scenes of ordinary life, are often very bright and fresh.

His entry in the &quot;Dictionary of Art&quot; (1996 vol 7, p569), by Geoffrey Ashton, refers to the invisibility of his brush strokes as a &quot;rather unexciting and flat use of paint&quot; but contrasts that with &quot;Collier&#x27;s strong and surprising sense of colour&quot; which &quot;created a disconcerting verisimilitude in both mood and appearance&quot;.

The &quot;Dictionary of Portrait Painters in Britain up to 1920&quot; (1997) describes his portraits as &quot;painterly works with a fresh use of light and colour&quot;.

==Public collections==
Sixteen of John Collier&#x27;s paintings are now in the collections of the National Portrait Gallery in London, and two are in the Tate Gallery. Four of the National Portrait Gallery paintings were in December 1997 on display: John Burns, Sir William Huggins, Thomas Huxley (the artist&#x27;s father in law) and Charles Darwin (copies of the last two are also prominently displayed at the top of the staircase at the Athenaeum Club in London).

A 1907 self-portrait has been preserved in the Uffizi in Florence which presumably commissioned it as part of its celebrated collection of artists&#x27; self-portraits.

Other pictures may be seen in houses and institutions open to the public: his &quot;Clytemnestra&quot;, a large and striking painting of the mythical figure, is in the Guildhall Gallery of the City of London. Another version, in which Clytemnestra has committed the murder and stands half-naked by the bath with a bloody sword is in the Worcester City Art Gallery &amp; Museum. &quot;Sentence of Death&quot; was given by the widow of the artist to Wolverhampton Art Gallery. His portrait of the Earl of Onslow (1903), is at Clandon Park, Surrey (National Trust). His full-length portrait of Sir Charles Tertius Mander, first baronet, is at Owlpen Manor, Gloucestershire, with another version in the collection of the National Trust at Wightwick Manor, and his &quot;Lady Godiva&quot; is in the Herbert Art Gallery and Museum. &quot;A glass of wine with Caesar Borgia&quot; 1893, can be seen hanging in the atrium of Ipswich Town Hall.

Reproductions of many others, from various collections, may be consulted in the John Collier box in the National Portrait Gallery Heinz Archive and Library, and a good selection is published in &quot;The Art of the Honourable John Collier&quot; by W.H. Pollock (1914). His work was also included in the Great Victorian Pictures exhibition mounted by the Arts Council in 1978 (catalogue, p27).

==Views on ethics and religion==
Collier&#x27;s views on religion and ethics have been compared with the views of Thomas and Julian Huxley, both of whom gave Romanes lectures on that subject. Collier (1926) explains
: &quot;It [the book &quot;The Religion of an Artist&quot;] is mostly concerned with ethics apart from religion ... I am looking forward to a time when ethics will have taken the place of religion ... My religion is really negative. [The benefits of religion] can be attained by other means which are less conducive to strife and which put less strain upon the reasoning faculties.&quot;
On secular morality:
: &quot;My standard is frankly utilitarian. As far as morality is intuitive, I think it may be reduced to an inherent impulse of kindliness towards our fellow citizens.&quot;
His views on ethics, then, were very close to the agnosticism of T.H. Huxley and the humanism of Julian Huxley.

On the idea of God:
: &quot;People may claim without much exaggeration that the belief in God is universal. They omit to add that superstition, often of the most degraded kind, is just as universal.&quot;
And
: &quot;An omnipotent Deity who sentences even the vilest of his creatures to eternal torture is infinitely more cruel than the cruellest man.&quot;
And on the Church:
: &quot;To me, as to most Englishmen, the triumph of Roman Catholicism would mean an unspeakable disaster to the cause of civilization.&quot;
And on non-conformists:
: &quot;They have a superstitious belief in the actual words of the Bible which is very dangerous&quot;.

<text>John Henry Noyes Collier (3 May 1901 – 6 April 1980) was a British-born writer and screenwriter best known for his short stories, many of which appeared in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; from the 1930s to the &#x27;50s. Most were collected in &quot;The John Collier Reader&quot; (Knopf, 1972); earlier collections include a 1951 volume, &quot;Fancies and Goodnights&quot;, which won the International Fantasy Award and remains in print. Individual stories are frequently anthologized in fantasy collections. John Collier&#x27;s writing has been praised by authors such as Anthony Burgess, Ray Bradbury, Roald Dahl, Neil Gaiman, Michael Chabon, Wyndham Lewis, and Paul Theroux. He appears to have given few interviews in his life; those include conversations with biographer Betty Richardson, Tom Milne, and Max Wilk.

==Life==
Born in London in 1901, John Collier was the son of John George and Emily Mary Noyes Collier. He had one sister, Kathleen Mars Collier. His father, John George Collier, was one of seventeen children, and could not afford formal education; he worked as a clerk. Nor could John George afford schooling for his son beyond prep school; John Collier and Kathleen were educated at home. He was privately educated by his uncle Vincent Collier, a novelist. Biographer Betty Richardson wrote:

When, at the age of 18 or 19, Collier was asked by his father what he had chosen as a vocation, his reply was, &quot;I want to be a poet.&quot; His father indulged him; over the course of the next ten years Collier lived on an allowance of two pounds a week plus whatever he could pick up by writing book reviews and acting as a cultural correspondent for a Japanese newspaper. During this time, being not overly burdened by any financial responsibilities, he developed a penchant for games of chance, conversation in cafes and visits to picture galleries. He never attended university.

He was married to early silent film actress Shirley Palmer in 1936; they were divorced. His second marriage in 1945 was to New York actress Beth Kay (Margaret Elizabeth Eke). They divorced a decade later. His third wife was Harriet Hess Collier, who survived him; they had one son, John G. S. Collier, born in Nice, France, on 18 May 1958.

==Career==

===Poetry===
He began writing poetry at the age of nineteen, and was first published in 1920.

For ten years Collier attempted to reconcile intensely visual experience opened to him by the Sitwells and the modern painters with the more austere preoccupations of those classical authors who were fashionable in the 1920s. He felt that his poetry was unsuccessful, however; he was not able to make his two selves (whom he oddly described as the &quot;archaic, uncouth, and even barbarous&quot; Olsen and the &quot;hysterically self-conscious dandy&quot; Valentine) speak with one voice.

Being an admirer of James Joyce, Collier found a solution in Joyce&#x27;s &quot;Ulysses&quot;. &quot;On going for my next lesson to &quot;Ulysses&quot;, that city of modern prose,&quot; he wrote, &quot;I was struck by the great number of magnificent passages in which words are used as they are used in poetry, and in which the emotion which is originally aesthetic, and the emotion which has its origin in intellect, are fused in higher proportions of extreme forms than I had believed was possible.&quot; The few poems he wrote during this time were afterward published in a volume under the title &quot;Gemini&quot;.

===Fiction===
While he had written some short stories during the period in which he was trying to find success as a poet, his career did not take shape until the publication of &quot;His Monkey Wife&quot; in 1930. It enjoyed a certain small popularity and critical approval that helped to sell his short stories. Biographer Richardson explained the literary context for the book:

As a private joke, Collier wrote a decidedly cool four-page review of &quot;His Monkey Wife&quot;, describing it as an attempt &quot;to combine the qualities of the thriller with those of what might be called the decorative novel,&quot; and concluding with the following appraisal of the talents of its author: &quot;From the classical standpoint his consciousness is too crammed for harmony, too neurasthenic for proportion, and his humor is too hysterical, too greedy, and too crude.&quot; Author Peter Straub has done the same with fake, negative reviews, in admiration of Collier.

His second novel, &quot;Tom&#x27;s A-Cold: A Tale&quot; (1933) depicted a barbaric and dystopian future England; it is mentioned in Joshua Glenn&#x27;s essay &quot;The 10 Best Apocalypse Novels of Pre-Golden Age SF (1904-33).&quot; Richardson calls it &quot;part of a tradition of apocalyptic literature that began in the 1870s&quot; including &quot;The War of the Worlds&quot;: &quot;Usually, this literature shows an England destroyed by alien forces, but in Collier&#x27;s novel, set in Hampshire in 1995, England has been destroyed by its own vices—greed, laziness, and an overwhelming bureaucracy crippled by its own committees and red tape.&quot; 

His final novel, &quot;Defy the Foul Fiend; or, The Misadventures of a Heart&quot;, another title taken from the same speech in &quot;King Lear&quot; as &quot;Tom&#x27;s A-Cold&quot;, was published in 1934. He received the Edgar Award in 1952 for the short story collection &quot;Fancies and Goodnights&quot;, which also won the International Fantasy Award in 1952.

===Writing style===
David Langford described Collier as &quot;best known for his highly polished, often bitterly flippant magazine stories... [His] best stories are touched with poetry and real wit, sometimes reminiscent of Saki&#x27;s. There are moments of outrageous Grand Guignol; the occasional sexual naughtiness is far beyond Thorne Smith in sophistication.&quot; Langford praises Collier&#x27;s &quot;smiling misanthropy&quot;. Similarly, Christopher Fowler wrote in &quot;The Independent&quot;, &quot;His simple, sharp style brought his tales colourfully to life&quot; and described Collier&#x27;s fiction as &quot;sardonic&quot;. John Clute wrote, &quot;He was known mainly for his sophisticated though sometimes rather precious short stories, generally featuring acerbic snap endings; many of these stories have strong elements of fantasy...&quot; E. F. Bleiler also admired Collier&#x27;s writing, describing Collier as &quot;&quot;One of the modern masters of the short story and certainly the preeminent writer of short fantasies&quot;, and stating that &quot;The Devil and All&quot; was &quot;one of the great fantasy collections&quot;.

==Other media==
In the succeeding years, Collier traveled between England, France and Hollywood. He continued to write short stories, but as time went on, he would turn his attention more and more towards writing screenplays.

Max Wilk, who interviewed Collier for his book &quot;Schmucks with Underwoods&quot;, tells how, during the 1930s, Collier left the home he owned in England, Wilcote Manor, and traveled to France, where he lived briefly at Antibes and Cassis. The story of how Collier wound up going to Hollywood has been mistold sometimes, but Collier told Wilk that in Cassis,

The film &quot;Sylvia Scarlett&quot; starred Katharine Hepburn, Cary Grant, Brian Aherne, and Edmund Gwenn; it was the comic story of a widower, his daughter Sylvia who disguises herself as a boy, and a con man; Collier&#x27;s collaborators on the script were Gladys Unger and Mortimer Offner. Wilk writes that the film was considered bizarre at the time, but decades later, it enjoys a cult following.

Collier landed in Hollywood on May 16, 1935, but, he told Wilk, after &quot;Sylvia Scarlett&quot; he returned to England. There, he spent a year working on &quot;Elephant Boy&quot; for director Zoltan Korda.

Collier suggested a way to make the footage cohere into a story and to make &quot;a star out of that little boy, Sabu.&quot; After these two unorthodox starts to screenwriting, Collier was on his way to a new writing career.

===Screenplays===

Collier returned to Hollywood, where he wrote prolifically for film and television. He contributed notably to the screenplays of &quot;The African Queen&quot; along with James Agee and John Huston, &quot;The War Lord&quot;, &quot;I Am a Camera&quot; (adapted from &quot;The Berlin Stories&quot; and remade later as &quot;Cabaret&quot;), &quot;Her Cardboard Lover&quot;, &quot;Deception&quot; and &quot;Roseanna McCoy&quot;.

==Awards==
* Poetry award granted by the Paris literary magazine &quot;This Quarter&quot; for his poetry collection &quot;Gemini&quot;.
* International Fantasy Award for Fiction (1952) for &quot;Fancies and Goodnights&quot; (1951).
* Edgar Award for Best Short Story (1952) for &quot;Fancies and Goodnights&quot; (1951).

==Death==
Collier died of a stroke on 6 April 1980, in Pacific Palisades, Los Angeles, California. Near the end of his life, he wrote, &quot;I sometimes marvel that a third-rate writer like me has been able to palm himself off as a second-rate writer.&quot;

==Collections of Collier&#x27;s papers==
* The Harry Ransom Humanities Research Center at the University of Texas at Austin&#x27;s papers &quot;represent his transition from a poet to writer of novels, short stories, and screenplays. The bulk of the papers are manuscripts covering several genres, although a substantial amount of correspondence is also included.&quot;

;Notes
==Selected short stories==
* Another American Tragedy — A man mutilates himself in order to murder an aged rich relative and impersonate him, to change the will in his own favor - only to discover he isn&#x27;t the only one who wants the old man dead.
* Back for Christmas — A man plots a foolproof way to murder his wife, but the murder is exposed because of an unexpected gift she left for him to find. Originally published in &quot;The New Yorker&quot; (7 October 1939). (Grams erroneously cites a later publication: 13 December 1939 issue of &quot;The Tattler&quot; (sic - The Tatler was the magazine concerned).) This story has been dramatised many times: once for &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, three times for the &quot;Suspense&quot; radio series (Peter Lorre portrayed the main character in the first broadcast in 1943; the 1948 and 1956 broadcasts both starred Herbert Marshall), as well as once for an episode of &quot;Tales of the Unexpected&quot;.
* Bottle Party — A jinn (genie) tricks a man into taking his place in the bottle.
* Cancel All I Said — A couple&#x27;s young daughter takes a screen test. The couple&#x27;s lives are torn apart by the studio head&#x27;s spoken offer to make the child a star.
* The Chaser — A young man buying a genuine love potion cannot understand why the seller sells love potions for a dollar, but also offers a colorless, tasteless, undetectable poison at a much, much higher price.
* Evening Primrose — Probably his most famous; about people who live in a department store, hiding during the day and coming out at night. Betty Richardson wrote that the store is &quot;the Valhalla, of course, of a consumer society ... populated by acquisitive people who pose as mannequins by daylight; by night, they emerge to grab what they want&quot;: &quot;Happy to sacrifice all human emotions—love, pity, integrity—for the sake of consumer goods, these denizens have their own pecking order and police. The primary duty of the latter is to suppress any rebellion against this materialistic society.&quot; The story was read by Vincent Price and recorded on an LP record by Caedmon Audio in 1980. The story also served as the inspiration for the 1984 music video &quot;Prime Time&quot; by the British progressive rock band The Alan Parsons Project.
* Interpretation of a Dream — A man experiences disturbing and serial dreams of falling from the thirty-ninth story of the skyscraper in which he works, passing one story every night. In his dreams, he looks through the window and makes detailed and veridical observations of the real-life inhabitants as he passes.
* Over Insurance — A loving couple puts nine-tenths of their money into life insurance and becomes so impoverished as a result that each spouse decides to poison the other, unaware that the other has made the same decision.
* Special Delivery — A man falls in love with a department-store mannequin. This was later adapted for an episode of the 1960s TV series &quot;Journey to the Unknown&quot;, retitled &quot;Eve&quot;, which starred Dennis Waterman and Carol Lynley.
* The Steel Cat — An inventor uses his pet mouse to demonstrate his better mousetrap to an insensitive prospect who insists on seeing the mouse actually die.
* Three Bears Cottage — A man tries unsuccessfully to poison his wife with a mushroom as retaliation for serving him a smaller egg than the one she served herself.
* Thus I Refute Beelzy — An odiously rational father is confounded by the imagination of his small son.
* The Touch of Nutmeg Makes It — A man tried for murder and acquitted for lack of motive tells his story to sympathetic friends.
* Wet Saturday — Stuck indoors on a rainy Saturday, a family must deal with a problem. The problem turns out to be murder, and how to frame an innocent visitor for the crime. Dramatised in the Suspense radio series broadcast on 24 June 1942 and 16 December 1943 featuring Charles Laughton, and as an episode of &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot; broadcast on 30 September 1956. The episode was actually directed by Hitchcock himself. It was also later adapted for Roald Dahl&#x27;s &quot;Tales of the Unexpected.&quot;
* Youth from Vienna — A couple, whose careers (tennis player and actress) depend on youth, are forced to deal with a gift of a single dose of rejuvenating medicine that cannot be divided or shared. This story was the basis for &quot;The Fountain of Youth,&quot; a 1956 TV pilot for a proposed anthology series, produced by Desilu and written, directed, and hosted by Orson Welles.

<text>James William Charles Pennington ( – October 22, 1870) was an American historian, abolitionist, orator, minister, writer, and social organizer. Pennington is the first known Black student to attend Yale University. He was ordained as a minister in the Congregational Church, later also serving in Presbyterian churches for congregations in Hartford, Connecticut, and New York. After the Civil War, he served congregations in Natchez, Mississippi, Portland, Maine, and Jacksonville, Florida.

In the Antebellum period, Pennington was an abolitionist, and among the American delegates to the Second World Conference on Slavery in London. In 1850, he happened to be in Scotland when the Fugitive Slave Act was passed by the US Congress. As it increased the risk for fugitive slaves in the North, Pennington stayed in the British Isles while friends worked to buy his freedom from his former master and then from his estate. Pennington raised funds for the abolition movement on the public lecture circuit in England.

Pennington wrote and published what is considered the first history of blacks in the United States, &quot;The Origin and History of the Colored People&quot; (1841). His memoir, &quot;The Fugitive Blacksmith,&quot; was first published in 1849 in London.

On April 24, 2023, Yale awarded Pennington a posthumous M.A. &quot;Privatim&quot; degree 

==Early life==
James was born into slavery in 1807, at a Tilghman plantation on the Eastern Shore of Maryland. When he was four years old, James and his mother were given to Frisby Tilghman, their master&#x27;s son, as a wedding gift. They were taken by the younger Tilghman to his new plantation called Rockland, near Hagerstown in western Maryland. There James was trained as a carpenter and blacksmith. On October 28, 1827, at the age of nineteen, James escaped from the plantation, leaving behind his parents and eleven siblings.

Pennington reached Adams County, Pennsylvania, where he was taken in by the Quakers William and Phoebe Wright. They assisted the fugitive from slavery, and paid him wages for his work. As Pennington was illiterate, Wright began to teach him to read and write. Pennington adopted the middle name &quot;William&quot; after his benefactor, and the surname &quot;Pennington,&quot; after Isaac Penington, an English man who was prominent in Quaker history.

==Move to New York==
Moving north to Brooklyn, New York, a year later in 1828, Pennington found work as a coachman for a wealthy lawyer. He continued his education, paying tutors out of his earnings, and teaching himself Latin and Greek. New York&#x27;s law for gradual abolition of slavery did not completely free all adults until 1827. In the early 1800s Kings County and Brooklyn on Long Island still had many enslaved laborers, as they were important to the agricultural economy of the area at the time.

Pennington attended the first Negro National Convention in Philadelphia in 1829. He continued to be active in the Negro Convention Movement, becoming its presiding officer in 1853. Within five years he had learned so much that he was hired to teach school in Newtown (present-day Elmhurst, Queens, in western Long Island). It was he who married there Frederick Douglass and his fiancée.

He also became involved in the Shiloh Presbyterian Church, Manhattan.

==Education==
Pennington applied to Yale Divinity School but was denied admission due to the color of his skin. Yale administrators allowed Pennington to take classes at Yale University without formally matriculating, but under degrading conditions. He was not allowed to speak or ask a question in class, borrow a book from the library, or add his name to the Yale catalog, humiliations that he called &quot;oppression.&quot; After completing his studies at Yale Divinity School, Pennington was ordained to the ministry of the Congregational Church, suggesting that the church recognized he had received a Yale education.

On April 24, 2023, Yale awarded Pennington a M.A. &quot;Privatim&quot;, acknowledging, &quot;Although we cannot return to Pennington...the access and privileges [he was] denied when [he] studied at Yale, we recognize [his] work and honor [his legacy] by conferring on [him a] M.A. Privatim degree.&quot;

==Ministry and social justice work==
Pennington first served a congregation on Long Island, probably in Queens. Next Pennington was called in 1840 by the Talcott Street Church (now called Faith Congregational Church) in Hartford, Connecticut. While serving as minister, Pennington wrote what is believed to be the first history of African Americans, &quot;The Origin and History of the Colored People&quot; (1841), drawing on current works of the time. In this work, Pennington expressed anti-Catholic sentiments and claimed that supposedly Biblical justification for slavery had roots in &quot;a doctrine first invented by a bishop of the Romish church&quot;.

He became deeply involved in the abolition movement. He was selected as a delegate to the Second World Conference on Slavery in London. While in England, he had been invited by churches to preach and serve communion as a matter of course as a visiting minister. After returning to Hartford, he told his white colleagues about this and persuaded them to include him in their pulpit exchanges. On this circuit, he was the first black pastor to preach in a number of Connecticut churches.

He became friends with John Hooker, one of his parishioners, confiding in him in 1844 his status as a fugitive slave and concern about his future. Hooker opened secret negotiations for purchase with his former owner, Frisby Tilghman. Hooker and Pennington did not then have the $500 demanded by the master, who died soon after.

Pennington was among those in the late 1830s who became involved in seeking justice for some West African Mende people illegally taken in slavery. After they mutinied and sailed their ship to Long Island, they were taken into custody by the United States. Spain, the ship&#x27;s owners, the US, and the Mende, all had roles in the complex &quot;Amistad&quot; case, which was litigated from 1839 to 1841. The courts were called on to determine whether the Mende were the property of the ship&#x27;s owners, or of Spain, or free. It was ultimately settled by the United States Supreme Court, which ruled in favor of the Mende, saying that as free men (since the African slave trade had been banned), they had the right to defend themselves and try to regain their freedom. When the West Africans won their case and freedom, thirty-five chose to return to Africa. Pennington formed the United Missionary Society, the first black missionary society, to help raise funds for their return.

Pennington happened to be in Scotland when the Fugitive Slave Law of 1850 was passed, which increased the risk to him as a fugitive from the South. It required even law enforcement and officials in such free states as New York to cooperate in the capture and prosecution of fugitive slaves, and was biased in favor of slave catchers and masters. Bounties were offered for slaves&#x27; capture and documentation requirements were light, making it easy for slave catchers even to take free persons. Although Pennington was called to New York in 1850 to serve the Shiloh Presbyterian Church, he feared returning while at such risk. Hooker worked with abolitionists in England to raise money to purchase Pennington from Tilghman&#x27;s estate (the planter had died). Friends of Pennington in Dunse, Berwickshire raised the funds. Hooker briefly took legal &quot;ownership&quot; of Pennington in order to legally manumit him in New York.

While remaining in the British Isles for nearly two years for his safety, Pennington traveled widely there and in Europe, speaking and raising money for the abolition cause. He had completed writing his memoir, &quot;The Fugitive Blacksmith,&quot; which was first published in 1849 in London. This slave narrative recounted his journey from slavery to the status of educated minister.

While in Europe, Pennington was awarded an honorary doctorate by the University of Heidelberg, becoming the first African American to be so honored.

After returning to the United States, Pennington helped form a committee to protest the segregation of the New York City public transit system. Schoolteacher Elizabeth Jennings had been arrested in 1854 for using a street car reserved for whites. Several private companies operated all the street cars; they required blacks to sit in segregated seating. Defended by young attorney Chester A. Arthur, Jennings won her case in February 1855 in the Brooklyn Circuit Court, after a three-day trial covered by the &quot;New York Times&quot;.

When Pennington was arrested and convicted in 1859 for riding in a &quot;white only&quot; street car operated by another company, he was represented by the Legal Rights Association. It had been formed by Elizabeth&#x27;s father Thomas L. Jennings. He challenged the system successfully and on appeal, gained an 1855 ruling by the State Supreme Court that such racial segregation was illegal and must end. By 1865, after starts and stops, all the street car companies had desegregated their systems.

==Civil War and after==
Pennington identified as a pacifist, but during the American Civil War (1861–1865), he helped recruit black troops for the Union Army. When the war was over, he served for a short time as a minister in Natchez, Mississippi. Next he was called to Portland, Maine, where he served for three years.

Early in 1870, he returned to the South, where he had been appointed by the Presbyterian Church to serve in Florida. He organized an African-American congregation in Jacksonville. He died there on October 22, 1870, after a short illness.

==Legacy and honors==
In 1849 the University of Heidelberg awarded Pennington an honorary doctorate of divinity. The university has created the James W.C. Pennington Award in his honor. It is given to scholars who have done distinguished work on topics important to Pennington. The first recipient was Albert J. Raboteau. The award has also gone to Evelyn Brooks Higginbotham, Laurie Maffly-Kipp,William L. Andrews, and Christopher Cameron.

In 2016, Yale Divinity School renamed a classroom for Pennnington and hung a portrait of him in their common room. In 2023, the Yale Graduate and Professional Student Senate passed a resolution that made Pennington an honorary senator and commissioned a portrait of Pennington to hang in their Senate center, at Gryphon&#x27;s Pub.

Also in 2016, Pennington was inducted into the National Abolition Hall of Fame, in Peterboro, New York.

In 2023, Yale University conferred a posthumous M.A. &quot;Privatum&quot; on Pennington, alongside Rev. Alexander Crummell, nearly two centuries after they attended Yale. This happened in large part due to the advocacy of the Pennington Legacy Group, led by Yale Divinity School students, the Yale Graduate and Professional Student Senate, Yale Divinity Student Government, Yale College Council, and other Yale student clubs.

<text>The Mishneh Torah (), also known as Sefer Yad ha-Hazaka (), is a code of Rabbinic Jewish religious law (&quot;halakha&quot;) authored by Maimonides (Rabbi Moshe ben Maimon/Rambam). The &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; was compiled between 1170 and 1180 CE (4930 and 4940 AM), while Maimonides was living in Egypt, and is regarded as Maimonides&#x27; &quot;magnum opus&quot;. Accordingly, later sources simply refer to the work as &quot;&quot;Maimon&quot;, &quot;Maimonides&quot;, or &quot;RaMBaM&quot;&quot;, although Maimonides composed other works.

&quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; consists of fourteen books, subdivided into sections, chapters, and paragraphs. It is the only medieval-era work that details all of Jewish observance, including those laws that are only applicable when the Temple in Jerusalem is in existence, and remains an important work in Judaism.

Its title is an appellation originally used for the Biblical book of Deuteronomy, and its moniker, &quot;Book of the Strong Hand&quot;, derives from its subdivision into fourteen books: the numerical value fourteen, when represented as the Hebrew letters Yodh (10) and Dalet (4), forms the word (&#x27;hand&#x27;).

Maimonides intended to provide a complete statement of the Oral Law, so that a person who mastered first the Written Torah and then the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; would be in no need of any other book. Contemporary reaction was mixed, with a strong and immediate opposition which focused on the absence of sources and the belief that the work appeared to be intended to supersede study of the Talmud. Maimonides responded to these criticisms, and the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; endures as an influential work in Jewish religious thought. According to several authorities, a decision may not be rendered in opposition to a view of Maimonides, even where he apparently militated against the sense of a Talmudic passage, for in such cases the presumption was that the words of the Talmud were incorrectly interpreted. Likewise: &quot;One must follow Maimonides, even when the latter opposed his teachers, since he surely knew their views, and if he decided against them, he must have disapproved their interpretation.&quot; The &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; was later adapted for an Ashkenazi audience by Meir HaKohen in the form of the &quot;Haggahot Maimuniyyot&quot;. The work consists of supplemental notes to the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; with the objective of implanting contemporary Sephardic thought in Germany and France, while juxtaposing it to contemporary Ashkenazi halakhic customs.

==Sources==

Maimonides sought brevity and clarity in his &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; and, as in his &quot;Commentary on the Mishnah&quot;, he refrained from detailing his sources, considering it sufficient to name his sources in the preface. He drew upon the Torah and the rest of Tanakh, both Talmuds, Tosefta, and the halachic Midrashim, principally Sifra and Sifre.

Later sources include the responsa (&quot;teshuvot&quot;) of the Geonim. The maxims and decisions of the Geonim are frequently presented with the introductory phrase &quot;The Geonim have decided&quot; or &quot;There is a regulation of the Geonim&quot;, while the opinions of Isaac Alfasi and Alfasi&#x27;s pupil Joseph ibn Migash are prefaced by the words &quot;my teachers have decided&quot; (although there is no direct source confirming ibn Migash as Maimonides&#x27; teacher). According to Maimonides, the Geonim were considered &quot;unintelligible in our days, and there are but few who are able to comprehend them&quot;. There were even times when Maimonides disagreed with what was being taught in the name of the Geonim.

A number of laws appear to have no source in any of the works mentioned; it is thought that Maimonides deduced them through independent interpretations of the Bible or that they are based on versions of previous Talmudic texts no longer in our hands. Maimonides himself states a few times in his work that he possessed what he considered to be more accurate texts of the Talmud than what most people possessed at his time. The latter has been confirmed to a certain extent by versions of the Talmud preserved by the Yemenite Jews as to the reason for what previously were thought to be rulings without any source.

==Language and style==
The &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; is written in Hebrew, as the Mishnah had been. As he states in the preface, Maimonides was reluctant to write in Talmudic Aramaic, since it was not widely known. His previous works had been written in Judeo-Arabic.

The &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; virtually never cites sources or arguments, and confines itself to stating the final decision on the law to be followed in each situation. There is no discussion of Talmudic interpretation or methodology, and the sequence of chapters follows the factual subject matter of the laws rather than the intellectual principle involved. Maimonides was criticized for not including sources by his contemporaries. Maimonides later regretted not adding sources but ultimately did not have time to update his work.

==Contemporary reaction==

===Critics and criticism===
The &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; was strongly opposed almost as soon as it appeared. Major sources of contention were the absence of sources and the belief that the work appeared to be intended to supersede study of the Talmud. Some criticisms appear to have been less rational in nature. Indeed, Maimonides quotes the Talmud in stating that one should study the Talmud for a third of one&#x27;s study time.

The most sincere but influential opponent, whose comments are printed parallel to virtually all editions of the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;, was Rabbi Abraham ben David of Posquières (Raavad III, France, 12th century).

Many critics were especially bitter against the new methods which he had employed, and the very peculiarities which he had regarded as merits in his work failed to please his opponents because they were innovations. Thus they reproached him because he departed from the Talmudic order and introduced a division and arrangement of his own, and because he dared to sometimes decide according to the Tosefta and the Jerusalem Talmud as against the Babylonian Talmud.

Especially sharp was the blame heaped upon Maimonides because he neglected to cite his sources; this was considered an evidence of his superciliousness, since it made it difficult, if not absolutely impossible, for scholars to verify his statements, and compelled them to follow his decisions absolutely. Yet, despite all this, Maimonides remained certain that in the future the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; would find great influence and acceptance. This is boldly expressed in a letter to his student Rabbi Yoseph ben ha-rav Yehudah:

=== Maimonides&#x27; response ===

Maimonides defended himself. He had not composed this work for glory; he desired only to supply the necessary, but lacking, code, for there was danger lest pupils, weary of the difficult study, might go astray in decisions of practical importance.

He noted that it had never been his intention to abolish Talmudic studies altogether, nor had he ever said that there was no need of the &quot;Halakot&quot; of Rabbi Isaac Alfasi, for he himself had lectured to his pupils on the Gemara and, at their request, upon Alfasi&#x27;s work. However, he did state that for the masses, there was no need for Talmud study, as the &quot;Mishne Torah&quot;, along with the written Torah, would suffice. He also stated that in-depth study of Talmudic discussions was &quot;a waste of time&quot;, for the sole purpose of study was to know how to practice the law.

He said that his omission of his sources was due solely to his desire for brevity, although he regretted that he had not written a supplementary work citing his authorities for those halakot whose sources were not evident from the context. He would, however, should circumstances permit, atone for this error, however toilsome it might be to write such a supplement.

Raavad was forced to acknowledge that the work of Maimonides was a magnificent contribution, nor did he hesitate to praise him and approve his views in many passages, citing and commenting upon the sources.

Later works (e. g., Yosef Karo&#x27;s &quot;Kesef Mishné&quot;) set out to find sources for Maimonides&#x27; decisions, and to resolve any disputes between him and the Raavad.

===Yonah of Gerona===

Yonah of Gerona was a cousin of Nachmanides (Ramban) who was initially a member of the vocal opponents of the &quot;Yad&quot;. He was involved in the burning of a number of copies of the &quot;Sefer ha-Madda&quot; in the 1240s. Regret followed, when he saw the Talmud being burnt in Paris in 1244, which he interpreted as a sign from Heaven that he had been mistaken. He set out to the Land of Israel, to ask forgiveness on Maimonides&#x27; grave in presence of ten witnesses, but failed to continue to his destination. He composed a classic work on penitence (titled &quot;Shaarei Teshuva&quot;, &quot;The Gates of Repentance&quot;) during his soul-searching.

== Influence ==

Thus the work of Maimonides, notwithstanding the sharp attacks upon it, soon won general recognition as an authority of the first importance for ritual decisions. According to several authorities, a decision may not be rendered in opposition to a view of Maimonides, even though the latter apparently militated against the sense of a Talmudic passage, for in such cases the presumption was that the words of the Talmud were incorrectly interpreted. Likewise: &quot;One must follow Maimonides even when the latter opposed his teachers, since he surely knew their views, and if he decided against them he must have disapproved their interpretation&quot;.

Even when later authorities, like Asher ben Jehiel (the &quot;Rosh&quot;), decided against Maimonides, it became a rule of the Oriental Jews to follow the latter, although the European Jews, especially the Ashkenazim, preferred the opinions of the Rosh in such cases. But the hope which Maimonides expressed, that in time to come his work and his alone would be accepted, has been only half fulfilled. His &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; is indeed still very popular, but there has been no cessation in the study of other works.

Ironically, while Maimonides refrained from citing sources out of concern for brevity (or perhaps because he designed his work to be used without studying the Talmud or other sources first), the result has often been the opposite of what he intended. Various commentaries have been written which seek to supply the lacking source documentation, and, indeed, today, the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; is sometimes used as a sort of an index to aid in locating Talmudic passages. In cases where Maimonides&#x27; sources, or interpretation thereof, is questionable, the lack of clarity has at times led to lengthy analyses and debates – quite the opposite of the brevity he sought to attain. On the other hand, this only became an issue for students and scholars who studied the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;&#x27;s sources. According to Maimonides himself, deducing law from the sources had already become a precarious proposition (for a number of reasons) – even in his own times. This necessarily relates to different subjects – like the influence of the exile, language skills, lack of time, censorship, and alternate versions of the Talmud.

==Printed editions and textual accuracy==
Over time many textual errors and distortions have appeared in the various editions of Maimonides&#x27; &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;. These inaccuracies are in the text of rulings, in the drawings made by Maimonides, as well as in the division (and thus the numbering) of rulings.

There are various reasons for these inaccuracies. Some are due to errors in the copying of manuscripts (before the age of printing) or mistakes by typesetters of later editions. Others are due to conscious attempts to &quot;correct&quot; the text, and yet others to Christian censorship (in countries under its control). In addition, Maimonides himself frequently edited the text of his own autograph copy, such that manuscripts copied from his own book did not preserve his later corrections. Thus, the received version may not be the text that Maimonides intended us to read.

Often the distortions in existing versions prompted questions on the &quot;Mishne Torah&quot; which were solved in many creative and different ways by the scholars throughout the generations; many of these questions don&#x27;t arise in the first place if the version is corrected based upon reliable manuscripts.

In order to determine the exact version, scholars use reliable early manuscripts (some of them containing Maimonides&#x27; own signature), which are free of both Christian censorship and the changes of later readers who tried to &quot;correct&quot; the text on their own, without manuscript evidence. Since the middle of the 20th century there have been five scientific printings of the book:
*Rabbi Shabsai Frankel&#x27;s edition includes critical editions of the &quot;classical&quot; commentators on &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; as well as the book itself. However, the actual text of &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; in this edition is based heavily on the printed editions, rather than the early manuscripts, whose variant readings are relegated to marginal notes and an apparatus at the end of each volume. All the volumes have been published.
*Rabbi Yosef Qafih&#x27;s edition is based mainly on Yemenite manuscripts, and includes an extensive commentary by Qafih that surveys the discussions of the classical commentaries on &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; and includes verbatim citation of previous commentaries in their entirety along with Qafih&#x27;s comments.
*The &quot;Yad Peshutah&quot; edition by Rabbi Nahum Rabinovitch, Rosh Yeshivat Yeshivat Birkat Moshe in Ma&#x27;ale Adumim. This edition is based on a number of manuscripts (different ones are used for the different books, according to their reliability) and includes an original commentary on the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;.
*&quot;The Exact Mishneh Torah&quot; edition by Rabbi Yitzchak Shelat, also of Yeshivat Birkat Moshe, has no commentary. It compares the printed versions to the fixed version. So far, four volumes have been printed; the publisher expects to print two new volumes each year.
*A one-volume edition (1000 pages), published by Yeshivat Or Vishua and now in its third edition, reflects all the editions based on reliable manuscripts, accompanied by surrounding indexes but with no commentary. The text was checked again, based mainly on Qafih&#x27;s edition. It gives variant readings from the other leading editions only in cases where the changes are meaningful. &quot;The Mishne Torah Project&quot; of the yeshiva also plans to publish a multi-volume pocket edition including vowel diacritics and cross-references to other passages and to Maimonides&#x27; other works. The pocket version of &quot;Sefer Ha-Madda&quot; (The Book of Knowledge) is already in print.

===Codes and commentators===

&quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; itself has been the subject of a number of commentaries, the most notable being &quot;Magid Mishné&quot; by Vidal de Toulouse, &quot;Migdal Oz&quot; by Shem Tov ben Abraham ibn Gaon &quot;Kesef Mishné&quot; by Yosef Karo, &quot;Mishné la-Melech&quot; by Judah Rosanes, &quot;Lechem Mishné&quot; by Abraham de Boton, &quot;Rabbi David ben Zimra (Radbaz)&quot; and &quot;Haggahot Maimuniyyot&quot; by Meir HaKohen (which details Ashkenazi customs). Most commentators aim to resolve criticisms of the Raavad, and to trace Maimonides&#x27; sources to the text of the Talmud, Midrash and Geonim.

Later codes of Jewish law, such as &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot; by Rabbi Jacob ben Asher and &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot; by Rabbi Yosef Karo, draw heavily on Maimonides&#x27; work, and in both, whole sections are often quoted verbatim.

Also there were many attempts down to the present time to force those who follow the rulings of Maimonides to change to the Shulchan Aruch or some other latter work of Minhag/Halakha. In response to this Karo wrote:

Who is he whose heart conspires to approach forcing congregations who practice according to the RaMBaM of blessed memory, to go by any one of the early or latter-day Torah authorities?! ... Is it not a case of a fortiori, that regarding the School of Shammai—that the halakhah does not go according to them—they [the Talmudic Sages] said ‘if [one practices] like the School of Shammai [he may do so, but] according to their leniencies and their stringencies’: The RaMBaM, is the greatest of all the Torah authorities, and all the communities of the Land of Israel and the Arab-controlled lands and the West [North Africa] practice according to his word, and accepted him upon themselves as their Chief Rabbi. Whoever practices according to him with his leniencies and his stringencies, why coerce them to budge from him? And all the more so if also their fathers and forefathers practiced accordingly: for their children are not to turn right or left from the RaMBaM of blessed memory. And even if communities that practice according to the Rosh or other authorities like him became the majority, they cannot coerce the minority of congregations practicing according to the RaMBaM of blessed memory, to practice like they do. And there is no issue here concerning the prohibition against having two courts in the same city [‘lo tithgodedu’], since every congregation should practice according to its original custom…

== Present day ==

=== Study ===
The in-depth study of &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; underwent a revival in Lithuanian Judaism in the late 19th century. The Lithuanians did not use it as a source book on practical halakha, as they followed the Ashkenazi authorities such as Moses Isserles and the &quot;Aruch ha-Shulchan&quot;.

Instead, they used it as a guide to Talmudic interpretation and methodology. Given the fact that the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; entirely omits these topics, this reading seems paradoxical and against the grain. Their method was to compare the Talmudic source material with Maimonides&#x27; final decision, in order to reconstruct the rules of interpretation that must have been used to get from one to the other.

It thus remains an integral part of the Yeshiva curriculum. 
As regards Talmud study, it is one of the primary works referenced in analyzing the Talmudic text from a legal point of view, as mentioned.
It is also a primary text referenced in understanding the &quot;Halakha&quot; as presented in the &quot;Arba&#x27;ah Turim&quot; and &quot;Shulchan Aruch&quot;; and &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; is thus one of the first post-Talmudic sources consulted when investigating a question of Jewish law. 
See ; ; .

Prominent recent authorities who have written commentaries on the work include Rabbis Meir Simcha of Dvinsk (&quot;Ohr Somayach&quot;), Chaim Soloveitchik (&quot;Chiddushei Rabbeinu Chaim&quot;), Yitzchok Isaac Krasilschikov (&quot;Tevunah&quot;), Isser Zalman Meltzer (&quot;Even HaEzel&quot;), and, more recently, the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson (&quot;Hadran al HaRambam&quot;), Elazar Shach (&quot;Avi Ezri&quot;), Nahum Rabinovitch (&quot;Yad Peshuta&quot;), and Rabbi Yosef Kapach. See also: List of commentaries on Mishneh Torah

Many scholarly speeches (e. g., the traditional Rabbi&#x27;s speech on the Shabbat preceding Pesach and Yom Kippur) often revolve around a reconciliation between two passages in Maimonides&#x27; work.
Rav Soloveitchik&#x27;s work &quot;Al haTeshuvah&quot; discussing repentance in the light of Rambam&#x27;s work, is widely studied and referenced (in Modern Orthodox communities) in the days leading up to Rosh Hashanah and Yom Kippur.

Today, thousands of Orthodox Jews, particularly Chabad Hasidim, participate in one of the annual study cycles of &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; (one or three chapters a day), innovated by the Lubavitcher Rebbe, Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, in the spring of 1984. Parallel to the three- or one-chapter(s)-a-day cycle, there is a daily study of the Sefer Hamitzvot &quot;Book of the Commandments&quot;, also authored by Maimonides.

A popular commentary, &quot;Rambam La&#x27;Am&quot; (&#x27;Rambam for the Nation&#x27;), was produced in 1971 by Rabbi (published by Mossad Harav Kook). This 20 volume set is widely used in daily Rambam study, in the Israeli Chabad and Religious Zionist communities.
Adin Steinsaltz produced a similarly positioned commentary, published by Koren in 2017.

=== Practice ===
As for &quot;halakha l&#x27;maaseh&quot; (practical application of Jewish law), although the majority of Jews keep Jewish law according to various other Rabbinic codes organized around the Shulchan Aruch, an increasing number of Yemenite Jews, as well as various other individuals, are being attracted to the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; as their choice code of Jewish law by which to live. They may consider it a return to the original ways of their ancestors.

One individual who contributed to this phenomenon was Rabbi Yiḥyah Qafiḥ, the founder of the Dor Daim movement in Yemen. The &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; had always been a leading authority in the Baladi (local, traditionalist) Yemenite community – as a matter of local custom. Scholarly work in this vein was continued by his grandson, Rabbi Yosef Qafiḥ (also spelled Gafah, Qafahh or Kapach). Yosef Qafiḥ is credited with the publication of an almost encyclopedic commentary to the entire &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;, including his own insights, set to a text of the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; based upon the authoritative, hand-written manuscripts preserved by the Yemenite Jewish community. The introduction to his edition of the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; is well known in itself as a defense for the keeping of halakha according to the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;.

During his lifetime, Yosef Qafiḥ was a leading figure in the Baladi Yemenite community as a whole, as well as the Dor Daim or strict &quot;Rambamists&quot;. After Qafiḥ died, Rabbi Rasson Arusi has largely filled his place as the leading public representative of the Baladi and Rambamist communities.

Rabbi Rasson Arusi is founder of &#x27;Halikhoth Ahm Yisroel&#x27; and Makhon Mishnath haRambam, and head of the marriage department of the Rabbinate of Israel, as well as chief rabbi of city of Kiryat Ono in Israel. Arusi and the organization Makhon Mishnath haRambam have published several books filled with commentary on various parts and aspects of the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; as well as topics related to the Yemenite Jewish community. Besides the works of Qafiḥ and Arusi, there are a number of other commentaries to the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; written by leaders of the Yemenite Jewish community.

=== Ethnology ===
Scholars specializing in the study of the history and subculture of Judaism in premodern China (Sino-Judaica) have noted this work has surprising similarities with the liturgy of the Kaifeng Jews, descendants of Persian merchants who settled in the Middle Kingdom during the early Song dynasty. Beyond scriptural similarities, Michael Pollak comments the Jews&#x27; Pentateuch was divided into 53 sections according to the Persian style. He also points out:

The work was being used by the Jews of India during Maimonides&#x27; lifetime. In response to a letter from the Rabbis of Lunel, France requesting him to translate his &quot;Guide of the Perplexed&quot; from Arabic to Hebrew, Maimonides applauded their piety in light of what he viewed as the general stagnation of religiosity throughout the rest of the Jewish world. However, he commented: &quot;Only lately some well-to-do men came forward and purchased three copies of my code [the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;] which they distributed through messengers... Thus, the horizon of these Jews was widened, and the religious life in all communities as far as India revived.&quot; Further support for the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; circulating in India comes in the form of a letter sent from Safed, Israel, to Italy in 1535. In it, David del Rossi claimed that a Tripolitan Jewish merchant had told him the India town of Shingly (Cranganore) had a large Jewish population who dabbled in yearly pepper trade with the Portuguese. As far as their religious life, he wrote they: &quot;only recognize the Code of Maimonides and possessed no other authority or Traditional law.&quot;

Adam Schiff chose to take his Senate oath of office on a second edition (Soncino, 1490) of the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; in 2024, &quot;in part because of his concerns about the state of the rule of law&quot; and also because of &quot;his nerdy interest in how old this volume is and how comprehensive it is&quot;.

==Translations==
The first known English translation of the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; was made in 1832 by Herman Hedwig Bernard, professor of Hebrew at Cambridge University. Bernard&#x27;s work is titled &quot;The Main Principles of the Creed and Ethics of the Jews Exhibited in Selections from the Yad Hachazakah of Maimonides, with A Literal English Translation, Copious Illustrations from the Talmud, &amp;c.&quot;. Bernard&#x27;s work includes a glossary of words and concepts which appear in the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;.

The 1888 work &quot;Dat Vadin&quot; by Rabbi Moses Frankel, published in Odessa, is a Russian language summary of the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;.

In 1944, Philip Birnbaum published an excerpted translation published as &quot;Maimonides&#x27; Mishneh Torah: Yad Hazakah&quot;.

The Yale Judaica Series edition of the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; was started in 1949 and is almost complete, except &quot;the Book of Knowledge&quot;, which is in progress:

In 1981 Feldheim Publishers published an edition of the first two books based on the Oxford manuscript, with the translation of Moses Hyamson. As the translation was made from the traditional printed texts, it does not always match the Hebrew.

Moznaim Publishing Corporation has published an annotated English translation of the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot; by Rabbi Eliyahu Touger. This edition is available online on chabad.org 

In November 2006 Mayer Alter Horowitz of the Boston Hasidic dynasty announced that The Nesher Hagodol Legacy Foundation had begun a translation &quot;Perush HaMeir&quot; elucidating and explaining the &quot;Mishneh Torah&quot;.

<doc id="368673" wikidata="Q153818" url="?curid=368673" title="Emmerich Kálmán">
<text>Emmerich Kálmán ( ; 24 October 1882 – 30 October 1953) was a Hungarian composer of operettas and a prominent figure in the development of Viennese operetta in the 20th century. Among his most popular works are &quot;Die Csárdásfürstin&quot; (1915) and &quot;Gräfin Mariza&quot; (1924). Influences on his compositional style include Hungarian folk music (such as the csárdás), the Viennese style of precursors such as Johann Strauss II and Franz Lehár, and, in his later works, American jazz. As a result of the &quot;Anschluss,&quot; Kálmán and his family fled to Paris and then to the United States. He eventually returned to Europe in 1949 and died in Paris in 1953.

==Biography==

Kálmán was born Imre Koppstein in Siófok, then in Austria-Hungary, on the southern shore of Lake Balaton, to a Jewish family. Kálmán initially intended to become a concert pianist, but because of early-onset arthritis, he focused on composition instead. He studied music theory and composition at the National Hungarian Royal Academy of Music (then the Budapest Academy of Music), where he was a fellow student of Béla Bartók and Zoltán Kodály under Hans Kössler.

His early symphonic poems &quot;Saturnalia&quot; and &quot;Endre és Johanna&quot; were well-received, although he failed to achieve publication. He also composed piano music and wrote many songs: a song cycle on poems by Ludwig Jacobowski and a song collection published under the title &quot;Dalai&quot;.

However, the popularity of his humorous cabaret songs led him towards the composition of operettas. His first great success was &quot;Tatárjárás&quot; – &quot;Ein Herbstmanöver&quot; in German, meaning &quot;Autumn maneuver&quot;, although the English title is &quot;The Gay Hussars&quot;, which was first staged at the in Budapest, on 22 February 1908. Thereafter he moved to Vienna, where he achieved worldwide fame through his operettas &quot;Der Zigeunerprimas&quot;, &quot;Die Csárdásfürstin&quot;, &quot;Gräfin Mariza&quot;, and &quot;Die Zirkusprinzessin&quot;.

Kálmán and Franz Lehár were the leading composers of what has been called the &quot;Silver Age&quot; of Viennese operetta during the first quarter of the 20th century. He became well known for his fusion of Viennese waltz with Hungarian csárdás. Even so, polyphonically and melodically, Kálmán was a devoted follower of Giacomo Puccini, while in his orchestration methods he employed principles characteristic of Tchaikovsky&#x27;s music.

In 1929, his first child (with Vera Mendelsohn), Charles Kalman (1929–2015) was born and would later on be also a composer.

Despite his Jewish origins he was one of Adolf Hitler&#x27;s favorite composers. After the Anschluss, he rejected Hitler&#x27;s offer to become an &#x27;honorary Aryan&#x27; and was forced to move first to Paris, then to the United States, settling in California in 1940.

==Last years and death==
Following his emigration, performances of his works were prohibited in Nazi Germany. He emigrated back to Vienna from New York in 1949 before moving in 1951 to Paris, where he died.

==Popular culture==
In 1958 a West German biopic &quot;The Csardas King&quot; was made of his life, starring Gerhard Riedmann in the lead role.

The supporters of both the national football and handball teams of Iceland use a version of the song &#x27; from his operetta &quot;Das Veilchen vom Montmartre&quot; as an anthem, with Icelandic lyrics (&#x27;).

The overnight sleeper train from Stuttgart to Budapest is named &quot;The Kalman Imre&quot;.

<doc id="368674" wikidata="Q1067506" url="?curid=368674" title="Vasoconstriction">
<text>Vasoconstriction is the narrowing of the blood vessels resulting from contraction of the muscular wall of the vessels, in particular the large arteries and small arterioles. The process is the opposite of vasodilation, the widening of blood vessels. The process is particularly important in controlling hemorrhage and reducing acute blood loss. When blood vessels constrict, the flow of blood is restricted or decreased, thus retaining body heat or increasing vascular resistance. This makes the skin turn paler because less blood reaches the surface, reducing the radiation of heat. On a larger level, vasoconstriction is one mechanism by which the body regulates and maintains mean arterial pressure.

Medications causing vasoconstriction, also known as vasoconstrictors, are one type of medicine used to raise blood pressure. Generalized vasoconstriction usually results in an increase in systemic blood pressure, but it may also occur in specific tissues, causing a localized reduction in blood flow. The extent of vasoconstriction may be slight or severe depending on the substance or circumstance. Many vasoconstrictors also cause pupil dilation. Medications that cause vasoconstriction include: antihistamines, decongestants, and stimulants. Severe vasoconstriction may result in symptoms of intermittent claudication.

==General mechanism==
The mechanism that leads to vasoconstriction results from the increased concentration of calcium (Ca2+ ions) within vascular smooth muscle cells. However, the specific mechanisms for generating an increased intracellular concentration of calcium depends on the vasoconstrictor. Smooth muscle cells are capable of generating action potentials, but this mechanism is rarely utilized for contraction in the vasculature. Hormonal or pharmacokinetic components are more physiologically relevant. Two common stimuli for eliciting smooth muscle contraction are circulating epinephrine and activation of the sympathetic nervous system (through release of norepinephrine) that directly innervates the muscle. These compounds interact with cell surface adrenergic receptors. Such stimuli result in a signal transduction cascade that leads to increased intracellular calcium from the sarcoplasmic reticulum through IP3-mediated calcium release, as well as enhanced calcium entry across the sarcolemma through calcium channels. The rise in intracellular calcium complexes with calmodulin, which in turn activates myosin light-chain kinase. This enzyme is responsible for phosphorylating the light chain of myosin to stimulate cross-bridge cycling.

Once elevated, the intracellular calcium concentration is returned to its normal concentration through a variety of protein pumps and calcium exchangers located on the plasma membrane and sarcoplasmic reticulum. This reduction in calcium removes the stimulus necessary for contraction, allowing for a return to baseline.

==Causes==
Factors that trigger vasoconstriction can be exogenous or endogenous in origin. Ambient temperature is an example of exogenous vasoconstriction. Cutaneous vasoconstriction will occur because of the body&#x27;s exposure to the severe cold. Examples of endogenous factors include the autonomic nervous system, circulating hormones, and intrinsic mechanisms inherent to the vasculature itself (also referred to as the myogenic response).

Exposure to water causes vasoconstriction near the skin, which in turn causes water-immersion wrinkling.

===Examples===
Examples include stimulants, amphetamines, and antihistamines. Many are used in medicine to treat hypotension and as topical decongestants. Vasoconstrictors are also used clinically to increase blood pressure or to reduce local blood flow. Vasoconstrictors mixed with local anesthetics are used to increase the duration of local anesthesia by constricting the blood vessels, thereby safely concentrating the anesthetic agent for an extended duration, as well as reducing hemorrhage.

The routes of administration vary. They may be both systemic and topical. For example, pseudoephedrine is taken orally and phenylephrine is topically applied to the nasal passages or eyes. Examples include:
===Endogenous===
Vasoconstriction is a procedure of the body that averts orthostatic hypotension. It is part of a body negative feedback loop in which the body tries to restore homeostasis (maintain constant internal environment).

For example, vasoconstriction is a hypothermic preventative in which the blood vessels constrict and blood must move at a higher pressure to actively prevent a hypoxic reaction. ATP is used as a form of energy to increase this pressure to heat the body. Once homeostasis is restored, the blood pressure and ATP production regulates. Vasoconstriction also occurs in superficial blood vessels of warm-blooded animals when their ambient environment is cold; this process diverts the flow of heated blood to the center of the animal, preventing the loss of heat.

==Pathology==
Vasoconstriction can be a contributing factor to erectile dysfunction. An increase in blood flow to the penis causes an erection.

Improper vasoconstriction may also play a role in secondary hypertension.

To summarize, vasoconstriction is a physiological process that involves the narrowing of blood vessels, particularly arteries and arterioles, resulting in a reduction of blood flow to specific tissues or organs. This phenomenon is primarily regulated by the contraction of smooth muscle cells within the vessel walls. Several factors contribute to vasoconstriction, including the release of vasoconstrictor substances such as endothelin and angiotensin II, both of which play crucial roles in the modulation of vascular tone.

Additionally, sympathetic nervous system activation, triggered by stress or other stimuli, prompts the release of norepinephrine, a neurotransmitter that induces vasoconstriction by binding to alpha-adrenergic receptors on smooth muscle cells. The narrowing of blood vessels leads to an increase in peripheral resistance, thereby elevating blood pressure. While vasoconstriction is a normal and essential regulatory mechanism for maintaining blood pressure and redistributing blood flow during various physiological processes, its dysregulation can contribute to pathological conditions. Chronic vasoconstriction is associated with hypertension, a major risk factor for cardiovascular diseases such as heart attack and stroke. Moreover, impaired blood flow resulting from abnormal vasoconstriction may contribute to tissue ischemia, which can be observed in conditions like Raynaud&#x27;s disease. Understanding the pathology of vasoconstriction is crucial for developing targeted therapeutic strategies to manage conditions associated with abnormal vascular tone.

<text>In mathematics, the moments of a function are certain quantitative measures related to the shape of the function&#x27;s graph. If the function represents mass density, then the zeroth moment is the total mass, the first moment (normalized by total mass) is the center of mass, and the second moment is the moment of inertia. If the function is a probability distribution, then the first moment is the expected value, the second central moment is the variance, the third standardized moment is the skewness, and the fourth standardized moment is the kurtosis. 

For a distribution of mass or probability on a bounded interval, the collection of all the moments (of all orders, from to ) uniquely determines the distribution (Hausdorff moment problem). The same is not true on unbounded intervals (Hamburger moment problem).

In the mid-nineteenth century, Pafnuty Chebyshev became the first person to think systematically in terms of the moments of random variables.

==Significance of the moments==
The -th raw moment (i.e., moment about zero) of a random variable formula_1 with density function formula_2 is defined byformula_3The -th moment of a real-valued continuous random variable with density function formula_2 about a value formula_5 is the integralformula_6

It is possible to define moments for random variables in a more general fashion than moments for real-valued functions — see moments in metric spaces. The moment of a function, without further explanation, usually refers to the above expression with formula_7.
For the second and higher moments, the central moment (moments about the mean, with &quot;c&quot; being the mean) are usually used rather than the moments about zero, because they provide clearer information about the distribution&#x27;s shape.

Other moments may also be defined. For example, the th inverse moment about zero is formula_8 and the -th logarithmic moment about zero is formula_9

The -th moment about zero of a probability density function formula_2 is the expected value of formula_11 and is called a &quot;raw moment&quot; or &quot;crude moment&quot;. The moments about its mean formula_12 are called &quot;central&quot; moments; these describe the shape of the function, independently of translation.

If formula_13 is a probability density function, then the value of the integral above is called the -th moment of the probability distribution. More generally, if &quot;F&quot; is a cumulative probability distribution function of any probability distribution, which may not have a density function, then the -th moment of the probability distribution is given by the Riemann–Stieltjes integralformula_14where &quot;X&quot; is a random variable that has this cumulative distribution &quot;F&quot;, and is the expectation operator or mean.
Whenformula_15the moment is said not to exist. If the -th moment about any point exists, so does the -th moment (and thus, all lower-order moments) about every point.
The zeroth moment of any probability density function is 1, since the area under any probability density function must be equal to one.

=== Standardized moments ===

The &quot;normalised&quot; -th central moment or standardised moment is the -th central moment divided by ; the normalised -th central moment of the random variable is formula_16

These normalised central moments are dimensionless quantities, which represent the distribution independently of any linear change of scale.

=== Notable moments ===
====Mean====

The first raw moment is the mean, usually denoted formula_17

====Variance====

The second central moment is the variance. The positive square root of the variance is the standard deviation formula_18

====Skewness====

The third central moment is the measure of the lopsidedness of the distribution; any symmetric distribution will have a third central moment, if defined, of zero. The normalised third central moment is called the skewness, often . A distribution that is skewed to the left (the tail of the distribution is longer on the left) will have a negative skewness. A distribution that is skewed to the right (the tail of the distribution is longer on the right), will have a positive skewness.

For distributions that are not too different from the normal distribution, the median will be somewhere near ; the mode about .

====Kurtosis====
The fourth central moment is a measure of the heaviness of the tail of the distribution. Since it is the expectation of a fourth power, the fourth central moment, where defined, is always nonnegative; and except for a point distribution, it is always strictly positive. The fourth central moment of a normal distribution is .

The kurtosis is defined to be the standardized fourth central moment. (Equivalently, as in the next section, excess kurtosis is the fourth cumulant divided by the square of the second cumulant.) If a distribution has heavy tails, the kurtosis will be high (sometimes called leptokurtic); conversely, light-tailed distributions (for example, bounded distributions such as the uniform) have low kurtosis (sometimes called platykurtic).

The kurtosis can be positive without limit, but must be greater than or equal to ; equality only holds for binary distributions. For unbounded skew distributions not too far from normal, tends to be somewhere in the area of and .

The inequality can be proven by consideringformula_19where . This is the expectation of a square, so it is non-negative for all &quot;a&quot;; however it is also a quadratic polynomial in &quot;a&quot;. Its discriminant must be non-positive, which gives the required relationship.

=== Higher moments ===
High-order moments are moments beyond 4th-order moments. 

As with variance, skewness, and kurtosis, these are higher-order statistics, involving non-linear combinations of the data, and can be used for description or estimation of further shape parameters. The higher the moment, the harder it is to estimate, in the sense that larger samples are required in order to obtain estimates of similar quality. This is due to the excess degrees of freedom consumed by the higher orders. Further, they can be subtle to interpret, often being most easily understood in terms of lower order moments – compare the higher-order derivatives of jerk and jounce in physics. For example, just as the 4th-order moment (kurtosis) can be interpreted as &quot;relative importance of tails as compared to shoulders in contribution to dispersion&quot; (for a given amount of dispersion, higher kurtosis corresponds to thicker tails, while lower kurtosis corresponds to broader shoulders), the 5th-order moment can be interpreted as measuring &quot;relative importance of tails as compared to center (mode and shoulders) in contribution to skewness&quot; (for a given amount of skewness, higher 5th moment corresponds to higher skewness in the tail portions and little skewness of mode, while lower 5th moment corresponds to more skewness in shoulders).

=== Mixed moments ===
Mixed moments are moments involving multiple variables.

The value formula_20 is called the moment of order formula_21 (moments are also defined for non-integral formula_21). The moments of the joint distribution of random variables formula_23 are defined similarly. For any integers formula_24, the mathematical expectation formula_25 is called a mixed moment of order formula_21 (where formula_27), and formula_28 is called a central mixed moment of order formula_21. The mixed moment formula_30 is called the covariance and is one of the basic characteristics of dependency between random variables.

Some examples are covariance, coskewness and cokurtosis. While there is a unique covariance, there are multiple co-skewnesses and co-kurtoses.

== Properties of moments ==
=== Transformation of center ===
Since
formula_31
where formula_32 is the binomial coefficient, it follows that the moments about &quot;b&quot; can be calculated from the moments about &quot;a&quot; by:
formula_33

=== The moment of a convolution of function ===

The raw moment of a convolution formula_34 reads 
formula_35
where formula_36 denotes the formula_37-th moment of the function given in the brackets. This identity follows by the convolution theorem for moment generating function and applying the chain rule for differentiating a product.

==Cumulants==
The first raw moment and the second and third &quot;unnormalized central&quot; moments are additive in the sense that if &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are independent random variables then
formula_38

(These can also hold for variables that satisfy weaker conditions than independence. The first always holds; if the second holds, the variables are called uncorrelated).

In fact, these are the first three cumulants and all cumulants share this additivity property.

== Sample moments ==
For all &quot;k&quot;, the -th raw moment of a population can be estimated using the -th raw sample moment
formula_39
applied to a sample drawn from the population.

It can be shown that the expected value of the raw sample moment is equal to the -th raw moment of the population, if that moment exists, for any sample size . It is thus an unbiased estimator. This contrasts with the situation for central moments, whose computation uses up a degree of freedom by using the sample mean. So for example an unbiased estimate of the population variance (the second central moment) is given by
formula_40
in which the previous denominator has been replaced by the degrees of freedom , and in which formula_41 refers to the sample mean. This estimate of the population moment is greater than the unadjusted observed sample moment by a factor of formula_42 and it is referred to as the &quot;adjusted sample variance&quot; or sometimes simply the &quot;sample variance&quot;.

==Problem of moments==

Problems of determining a probability distribution from its sequence of moments are called &quot;problem of moments&quot;. Such problems were first discussed by P.L. Chebyshev (1874) in connection with research on limit theorems. In order that the probability distribution of a random variable formula_1 be uniquely defined by its moments formula_44 it is sufficient, for example, that Carleman&#x27;s condition be satisfied:
formula_45
A similar result even holds for moments of random vectors. The &quot;problem of moments&quot; seeks characterizations of sequences formula_46
and &quot;X&quot; has finite -th central moment if the -th central moment of &quot;X&quot; about &quot;x&quot;0 is finite for some .

<text>Agapanthus () is a genus of plants, the only one in the subfamily Agapanthoideae of the family Amaryllidaceae. The family is in the monocot order Asparagales. The name is derived .

Some species of &quot;Agapanthus&quot; are commonly known as lily of the Nile, or African lily in the UK. However, they are not lilies and all of the species are native to Southern Africa (South Africa, Lesotho, Eswatini, Mozambique), though some have become naturalized in scattered places around the world (Australia, Great Britain, Mexico, Ethiopia, Jamaica, etc.).

Species boundaries are not clear in the genus, and in spite of having been intensively studied, the number of species recognized by different authorities varies from 6 to 10. The type species for the genus is &quot;Agapanthus africanus&quot;. Many hybrids and cultivars have been produced. They are cultivated throughout warm areas of the world. They can especially be spotted throughout Northern California. Most of these were described in a book published in 2004.

==Description==
&quot;Agapanthus&quot; is a genus of herbaceous perennials that mostly bloom in summer. This leads to the Australian common name, Star of Bethlehem, as it blooms just before Christmas. The leaves are basal, curved, and linear, growing up to long. They are rather leathery and arranged in two opposite rows. The plant has a mostly underground stem called a rhizome (like a ginger &#x27;root&#x27;) that is used as a storage organ. The roots, which grow out of the rhizome, are white, thick and fleshy.
The inflorescence is a pseudo-umbel subtended by two large deciduous bracts at the apex of a long, erect scape, up to tall. They have funnel-shaped or tubular flowers, in hues of blue to purple, shading to white. Some hybrids and cultivars have colors not found in wild plants which includes bi-colored blue/lavender and white flowers flushed with pink as the blooms mature. The ovary is superior. The style is hollow. &quot;Agapanthus&quot; does not have the distinctive chemistry of Allioideae.

==Taxonomy==

The genus &quot;Agapanthus&quot; was established by Charles Louis L&#x27;Héritier de Brutelle in 1788.

===Family placement===

Which family the genus belongs to has been a matter of debate since its creation. In the Cronquist system, the genus was placed in a very broadly defined family Liliaceae, along with other lilioid monocots. In 1985, Dahlgren, Clifford, and Yeo placed &quot;Agapanthus&quot; in Alliaceae, close to &quot;Tulbaghia&quot;. Their version of Alliaceae also included several genera that would later be transferred to Themidaceae.

In 1996, following a phylogenetic analysis of DNA sequences of the gene &quot;rbcL&quot;, Themidaceae was resurrected and &quot;Agapanthus&quot; was removed from Alliaceae. The authors found &quot;Agapanthus&quot; to be sister to Amaryllidaceae and transferred it to that family. This was not accepted by the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group when they published the original APG system in 1998, because the clade consisting of &quot;Agapanthus&quot; and Amaryllidaceae had only 63% bootstrap support. The APG system recognized three separate families, Agapanthaceae, Alliaceae sensu stricto, and Amaryllidaceae sensu stricto. Agapanthaceae consisted of &quot;Agapanthus&quot; only, and Dahlgren&#x27;s idea that it is close to &quot;Tulbaghia&quot; was rejected.

When the APG II system was published in 2003, it offered the option of combining Agapanthaceae, Alliaceae sensu stricto, and Amaryllidaceae sensu stricto to form a larger family, Alliaceae sensu lato. When the name Amaryllidaceae was conserved by the ICBN for this larger family, its name was changed from Alliaceae to Amaryllidaceae, but its circumscription remained the same. When APG II was replaced by APG III in 2009, Agapanthaceae was no longer accepted, but was treated as subfamily Agapanthoideae of the larger version of Amaryllidaceae. Also in 2009, Armen Takhtajan recognized the three smaller families allowed by APG II, instead of combining them as in APG III.

The table below summarizes the alternative family divisions:

Further molecular phylogenetic analyses of DNA sequences have confirmed that &quot;Agapanthus&quot; is sister to a clade consisting of subfamilies Allioideae and Amaryllidoideae of the family Amaryllidaceae (sensu APG III).

===Species===
Zonneveld and Duncan (2003) divided &quot;Agapanthus&quot; into six species (&quot;A. africanus, A. campanulatus, A. caulescens, A. coddii, A. inapertus, A. praecox&quot;). Four additional species had earlier been recognised by Leighton (1965) (&quot;A. comptonii, A. dyeri, A. nutans&quot; and &quot;A. walshii&quot;), but were given subspecific rank by Zonneveld and Duncan. , the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families recognises seven species:
;formerly included
The name &quot;Agapanthus ensifolius&quot; was coined in 1799, referring to a species now called &quot;Lachenalia ensifolia.&quot; (see &quot;Lachenalia).&quot;

==Cultivation==
&quot;Agapanthus praecox&quot; can be grown within USDA plant hardiness zones 9 to 11. In lower-numbered zones, the rhizomes should be placed deeper in the soil and mulched well in the fall. Summer water should be provided. &quot;Agapanthus&quot; can be propagated by dividing clumps or by seeds. The seeds of most varieties are fertile.

Several hundred cultivars and hybrids are cultivated as garden and landscape plants. Several are winter-hardy to USDA Zone 7.

In the UK the following cultivars have received the Royal Horticultural Society&#x27;s Award of Garden Merit:

*&#x27;Blue Ice&#x27; - pale blue
*&#x27;Blue Magic&#x27; - dark blue

===Invasive species===
In some regions, some agapanthus are listed as invasive species of plants. In New Zealand, &quot;Agapanthus praecox&quot; is classed as an &quot;environmental weed&quot; and calls to have it added to the National Pest Plant Accord have encountered opposition from gardeners.

===Pests===

As a rule, &quot;Agapanthus&quot; species are pest-hardy, neither being much attacked nor drastically affected by common garden pests. However, since the early 21st century &quot;Agapanthus&quot; in the far south of South Africa have fallen victim to a species of noctuid moth, the &quot;Agapanthus&quot; borer, &quot;Neuranethes spodopterodes&quot;. The larvae of the moth bore into the budding inflorescence and as they mature they tunnel down towards the roots, or emerge from the stem and drop down to feed on the leaves or rhizomes. A severe attack promotes rot and may stunt or even kill the plant; even plants that survive commonly lose most of their inflorescences and fail to produce the desired show of flowers.

Though &quot;Neuranethes spodopterodes&quot; is invasive in the regions where it has emerged as a pest, it is not an exotic invader, but a translocated species, having been imported inadvertently from its natural range in more northerly regions of the country. In its original range, the moth is not of horticultural importance, being controlled by natural enemies that as yet have neither been identified nor imported along with the host plants. In contrast, the &quot;Agapanthus&quot; borer is of considerable concern in the South West, and its voracity is so impressive that the species shows promise as a possible control for invasive &quot;Agapanthus praecox&quot; in countries like New Zealand.

In 2016, a new species of gall midge, &quot;Enigmadiplosis agapanthi&quot;, was described damaging Agapanthus in the United Kingdom.

==Allergenic potential==
&quot;Agapanthus&quot; has low potential for causing allergies; its OPALS allergy scale rating is 2 out of 10.

<text>A prefecture-level city () or prefectural city is an administrative division of the People&#x27;s Republic of China (PRC), ranking below a province and above a county in China&#x27;s administrative structure. 

During the Republican era, many of China&#x27;s prefectural cities were designated as [[Counties of Taiwan|counties]] as the country&#x27;s second level division below a province. From 1949 to 1983, the official term was a province-administrated city (Chinese: 省辖市). Prefectural level cities form the second level of the administrative structure (alongside prefectures, leagues and autonomous prefectures). Administrative chiefs (mayors) of prefectural level cities generally have the same rank as a division chief () of a national ministry. Since the 1980s, most former prefectures have been renamed into prefecture-level cities.

A prefectural level city is a &quot;city&quot; () and &quot;prefecture&quot; () that have been merged into one consolidated and unified jurisdiction. As such it is simultaneously a city, which is a municipal entry with subordinate districts, and a prefecture with subordinate county-level cities and counties which is an administrative division of a province.

A prefectural level city is often not a &quot;city&quot; in the usual sense of the term (i.e., a large continuous urban settlement), but instead an administrative unit comprising, typically, a main central urban area (the core city, city as in the usual sense, usually with the same name as the prefectural level city) surrounded by rural areas, which together are divided into districts, and some surrounding counties or county-level cities governed by the prefecture-level city on behalf of the province, which all have their own urban areas surrounded by their own rural areas. The urban areas of the surrounding counties are usually smaller than the core urban area, and towns also form small urban areas scattered in the rural. The larger prefectural level cities span over .

Prefectural level cities nearly always contain multiple counties, county level cities, and other such sub-divisions. This results from the fact that the formerly predominant prefectures, which prefectural level cities have mostly replaced, were themselves large administrative units containing cities, smaller towns, and rural areas. To distinguish a prefectural level city from its actual urban area (city in the strict sense), the term &quot;shìqū&quot; (市区; &quot;urban area&quot;), is used.

The first prefectural level cities were created on 5 November 1983. Over the following two decades, prefectural level cities have come to replace the vast majority of Chinese prefectures; the process is still ongoing.

Most provinces are composed entirely or nearly entirely of prefectural level cities. Of the 22 provinces and five autonomous regions of the PRC, only nine provinces (Yunnan, Guizhou, Qinghai, Heilongjiang, Sichuan, Gansu, Jilin, Hubei, and Hunan) and three autonomous regions (Xinjiang, Tibet, and Inner Mongolia) have at least one or more second level or prefectural level divisions that are not prefectural level cities. In the case of the disputed Taiwan, it has six prefectural level cities, but these are governed separately by the Republic of China as their special municipalities.

Criteria that a prefecture must meet to become a prefectural level city:

* An urban centre with a non-rural population over 250,000
* gross output of value of industry of 200,000,000 RMB (US$32 million)
* the output of the tertiary sector supersedes that of the primary sector, contributing over 35% of the GDP

Fifteen large prefectural level cities have been granted the status of sub-provincial city, which gives them much greater autonomy.

Shijiazhuang, Suzhou, and Zhengzhou are the largest prefectural level cities with populations approaching or exceeding some sub-provincial cities.

A sub-prefecture-level city is a county-level city with powers approaching those of prefectural level cities.

==Classification==
There are a total of three classifications of prefecture-level cities:

*Regular prefectural level city, which consists of counties, county level cities, and districts subdivisions.
*Consolidated district-governed prefectural level city, which only consists of districts as subdivisions.
** Currently there are only 13 cities under this classification: Ezhou, Foshan, Guangzhou, Haikou, Karamay, Nanjing, Sansha, Sanya, Shenzhen, Wuhai, Wuhan, Xiamen, and Zhuhai
*Prefectural level city with no county-level divisions (direct-piped city), which are cities that do not govern any county-level divisions such as counties, county level cities, or legal administrative districts.
** Currently there are only four cities under this classification: Danzhou, Dongguan, Jiayuguan, and Zhongshan

== Cartographic expression and statistics ==

In Europe and North America, cities are generally represented as points, while counties are represented as areas. Thus, Bloomington, Indiana, is indicated on the map by a point, which is distinct from, and enclosed by, the area of Monroe County, Indiana. In China, however, large cities such as Xianning may, in reality, contain both urban and rural elements. Moreover, they may enclose counties or other cities. On a less detailed map, Xianning would be indicated by a point, more or less corresponding to the coordinates of its city government. Other populous areas may also be exhibited as points, such as the county of Tongshan, with no indication that Tongshan is, in fact, enclosed by Xianning. On a more detailed map, Xianning would be drawn as an area, similar to a county of the United States, and Tongshan would be drawn as a smaller area within Xianning.

This convention may lead to difficulty in the identification of places mentioned in older sources. For example, Guo Moruo writes that he was born in the town of Shawan, within the prefecture of Leshan, and attended primary school in the town of Jiading. A modern map is unlikely to show either town: Shawan, because it is too small, and Jiading, because it is the seat of Leshan, and is therefore indicated on the map by a point labelled &quot;Leshan.&quot; A more detailed map would show Shawan as a district within Leshan, but Jiading would still be missing.

Statistics of China such as population and industrial activity are generally reported along prefectural city lines. Thus, the relatively unknown city of Huangshi has 2.5 million residents, more than most European capitals, but upon closer inspection, the city covers an area almost 100 kilometers across. Furthermore, Huangshi contains several other cities, such as Daye. If a person wished to calculate the population of the urban area of Huangshi, and had a map of Huangshi, and a table of its population by district, the task might not be easy. The urban area might be split between several districts, and some of those districts may include rural elements as well.

<text>Brodiaea , also known by the common name cluster-lilies, is a monocot genus of flowering plants.

One school of thought places the genus in the family , while another school of thought places it in the subfamily Brodiaeoideae of the family Asparagaceae. The USDA Plants Database still classifies the genus &quot;Brodiaea&quot; in the family Liliaceae.

&quot;Brodiaea&quot; species occur along the Pacific Coast region of North America, from British Columbia throughout California into the Baja California Peninsula. They are especially common in northern California.

==Description==
&quot;Brodiaea&quot; species are herbaceous perennials, growing from corms. Between one and six narrow leaves are produced from the corm. The bare flowering stem (scape) carries an umbel of flowers. Individual flowers have six blue to purple tepals, joined at the base to form a tube with free lobes at the mouth. The outer three tepal lobes are narrower than the inner three.

In almost all species, inside the tepals and joined to their bases are three sterile stamens (staminodes), resembling small petals, each opposite one of the outer tepals. Three normal stamens are also joined to the bases of the tepals and are placed opposite the inner ones. The base of the filaments of the stamens may be expanded into various shapes, such as flaps or wings. The size and shape of the staminodes and of the structures at the base of the filaments are important diagnostic characters. The compound pistil is formed of three carpels forming a superior ovary with three locules. The style which emerges between the three stamens has a three-lobed stigma. The seeds are black.

==Taxonomy==
===Nomenclature===
The origin of the scientific name of the genus is somewhat tangled. Specimens of what is now called &quot;Brodiaea&quot; were first collected by Archibald Menzies, botanist to the Vancouver Expedition, in 1792. Menzies collected the plant from the vicinity of the Strait of Georgia, named &quot;New Georgia&quot; by George Vancouver. The first published reference to the plant did not give it a name. This was in James Edward Smith&#x27;s 1807 &quot;An introduction to physiological and systematical botany&quot;, where Smith used it to argue that the tepals of liliaceous plants are sepals rather than petals: 

The following year, early in 1808, Richard Salisbury published a description of the first &quot;Brodiaea&quot; species in &quot;The Paradisus Londinensis&quot;, naming it &quot;Hookera coronaria&quot;, the genus name being in honour of the illustrator William Hooker. Shortly afterwards, Smith named a moss genus &quot;Hookeria&quot;, and in April 1808, he read to the Linnean Society of London a formal description of a new genus, based on the same species as Salisbury&#x27;s &quot;Hookera coronaria&quot;, naming the genus &quot;Brodiaea&quot; in honour of Scottish botanist James Brodie. Formal publication did not occur, however, until Smith&#x27;s presentation went to print in 1810. George Boulger, writing in the &quot;Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, says that Smith&#x27;s actions were deliberately intended to deprive Salisbury of credit for the genus.

If this was Smith&#x27;s intention it was successful, since although Salisbury&#x27;s genus name &quot;Hookera&quot; has priority over Smith&#x27;s name &quot;Brodiaea&quot;, names as similar as &quot;Hookera&quot; and &quot;Hookeria&quot; are considered to be confusing and a formal proposal to conserve the names &quot;Brodiaea&quot; and &quot;Hookeria&quot; over the name &quot;Hookera&quot; was accepted. &quot;Brodiaea&quot; is thus a &quot;conserved name&quot; or &quot;&quot;nomen conservandum&quot;, shown by the abbreviation &quot;nom. cons.&quot;&quot; after the name in botanical sources. The type species is now &quot;Brodiaea coronaria&quot;, and the original type, &quot;Brodiaea grandiflora&quot; , is an illegitimate name.

===Phylogeny and classification===
&quot;Brodiaea&quot; belongs to a group of 12 genera whose affinities were the subject of much controversy until the end of the 20th century. Salisbury treated them as a family which he named Themidaceae. Others placed this group at lower taxonomic rank and usually included them in Liliaceae, Alliaceae, or Amaryllidaceae. Molecular phylogenetic studies confirmed the suspicions of many that this group was misplaced, and consequently, the family Themidaceae was resurrected in 1996. When the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group published the APG II system in 2003, Themidaceae was accepted as an optional family for those who wanted to circumscribe families narrowly in the order Asparagales. When the APG III system was published in 2009, the former Themidaceae was treated as a subfamily, Brodiaeoideae, of the family Asparagaceae sensu lato.

Some sources, such as ITIS, continue to use the polyphyletic groups of obsolete taxonomic systems. Other sources, such as the Angiosperm Phylogeny Website mostly follow the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group.

Brodiaea (or brodeia) is also used as a common name to refer to three genera, &quot;Brodiaea&quot;, &quot;Dichelostemma&quot;, and &quot;Triteleia&quot;. The latter two genera were once included as part of the genus &quot;Brodiaea&quot;.
The monophyly of &quot;Brodiaea&quot; as presently defined is not entirely certain. It might be intermixed with &quot;Dichelostemma&quot;.

===Species===
, the World Checklist of Selected Plant Families lists the following 17 species. English common names are from the &quot;Flora of North America&quot;.

# &quot;Brodiaea appendiculata&quot; - appendage cluster-lily - central California
# &quot;Brodiaea californica&quot; - California cluster-lily - northern California, southwestern Oregon
# &quot;Brodiaea coronaria&quot; - harvest cluster-lily; Californian hyacinth - British Columbia, Washington, Oregon, much of California
# &quot;Brodiaea elegans&quot; - elegant cluster-lily - western Oregon, most of California
# &quot;Brodiaea filifolia&quot; - threadleaf cluster-lily - southern California
# &quot;Brodiaea insignis&quot; - Kaweah cluster-lily - Tulare County
# &quot;Brodiaea jolonensis&quot; - chaparral cluster-lily - southern California, northern Baja California
# &quot;Brodiaea kinkiensis&quot; - San Clemente Island cluster-lily - San Clemente Island
# &quot;Brodiaea matsonii&quot; - Shasta County
# &quot;Brodiaea minor&quot; (syn. &quot;Brodiaea purdyi&quot; ) - vernalpool cluster-lily - northern California 
# &quot;Brodiaea nana&quot; - northern California 
# &quot;Brodiaea orcuttii&quot; - Orcutt&#x27;s cluster-lily - southern California, northern Baja California
# &quot;Brodiaea pallida&quot; - Chinese Camp cluster-lily - Calaveras and Tuolumne Counties
# &quot;Brodiaea santarosae&quot; - Santa Rosa basalt brodiaea - Riverside and San Diego Counties
# &quot;Brodiaea sierrae&quot; - Butte, Yuba and Nevada Counties
# &quot;Brodiaea stellaris&quot; - starflower cluster-lily - Sonoma, Mendocino and Humboldt Counties
# &quot;Brodiaea terrestris&quot; - dwarf cluster-lily - southwestern Oregon and much of coastal and southern California

;formerly included
Numerous other names have been coined using the name &quot;Brodiaea,&quot; referring to species now regarded as better suited to other genera &quot;(Androstephium Beauverdia Dandya Dichelostemma Leucocoryne Nothoscordum Tristagma Triteleia Triteleiopsis).&quot;

==Distribution and habitat==
&quot;Brodiaea&quot; species are confined to western North America, from British Columbia in the north, through the West Coast of the United States region, to northwestern Mexico in the south. The majority of species are endemic to California.

Many are adapted to serpentine soils or other soils with particular chemical compositions, resulting in limited distributions and several rare and endangered species. An example is &quot;Brodiaea pallida&quot;, known only from two populations along the border between Tuolumne County and Calaveras County, California.

==Cultivation==
A number of species of &quot;Brodiaea&quot; are in cultivation. Species such as &quot;B. californica&quot; and &quot;B. coronaria&quot; are recommended for sunny positions in the garden, where they extend the flowering season of most ornamental bulbs, flowering in early summer rather than in spring. The flower heads (umbels) of larger species can be dried for use as winter decorations. Smaller species, such as &quot;B. terrestris&quot;, may be grown in a bulb frame or alpine house.

<text>The flowering plant genus Ipheion (starflower, spring starflower) belongs to Allioideae, a subfamily of the family Amaryllidaceae. It includes three species native to southern Brazil, northeastern Argentina, and Uruguay.

== Description ==
They are small bulbous perennials with narrow grass-like leaves and honey-scented star-shaped flowers in spring, usually in shades of white or pale blue. The genus occurs naturally in Argentina, Uruguay, and southern Brazil, although &quot;Ipheion uniflorum&quot; has naturalized elsewhere.

== Taxonomy ==

=== History ===
The genus was originally described in 1836 by Constantine Samuel Rafinesque, based on &quot;Ipheion uniflorum&quot;, separating it from &quot;Milla uniflora&quot; Graham (now &quot;Tristagma&quot;). The original description was unifloral inflorescences with white flowers, spathe formed by one bifid bract, staminal filaments independently fused to the perigonial tube and the fruit being a clavate trilocular capsule.
The name then disappeared for more than a century and at various times the species have been included under other related genera (&quot;Milla&quot;, &quot;Tristagma&quot;, &quot;Brodiaea&quot; (including &quot;Hookera&quot;), &quot;Leucocoryne&quot;, &quot;Nothoscordum&quot;, &quot;Triteleia&quot; and &quot;Beauverdia&quot;). Several of these genera are now in a completely different but related family (Themidaceae). The closest of these genera to &quot;Ipheion&quot; is actually &quot;Tristagma&quot;. For instance in 1837, at the same time as Rafinesque&#x27;s description, &quot;Ipheion uniflorum&quot; was described by John Lindley in the &quot;Botanical Register&quot; as &quot;Triteleia uniflora&quot; Lindl. (see illustration)

In 1908, Beauverd placed &quot;Ipheion uniflorum&quot; in a new section of &quot;Nothoscordum&quot;, &quot;Nothoscordum&quot; section &quot;uniflora&quot; Beauv. as &quot;Nothoscordum uniflorum&quot; Baker (without attributing Rafinesque), along with four other species. However the name &quot;Ipheion&quot; did not appear again until 1943. In that year Herter elevated &quot;Nothoscordum&quot; section &quot;uniflora&quot; to the rank of genus, as &quot;Beauverdia&quot;. Later that same year Stearn pointed out that the name &quot;Ipheion&quot; had precedence and described the genus with nine species under that name.

There has been constant uncertainty as to the limits of the genus. At one stage it included 23 species in two sections, at other times it was completely absorbed into other genera such as &quot;Tristagma&quot;. Those species with yellow flowers were returned to &quot;Nothoscordum&quot;. In 1972 Guaglianone separated it again from &quot;Tristagma&quot; and divided it into two sections, &quot;Hirtellum&quot; and &quot;Ipheion&quot;. At that time it consisted of eight species in Argentina, Uruguay, southern Brazil and central Chile.

=== Familial circumscription ===
Lindley included &quot;Ipheion&quot; (as &quot;Triteleia&quot;) under the family Liliaceae, a pattern that remained until 1926, when Hutchinson moved parts of that family to Amaryllidaceae, as tribe Gilesieae, an arrangement that has largely persisted since.

=== Phylogenetics ===
In 1996, a molecular phylogenetic study of the &quot;rbcL&quot; gene created the Gilliesioideae, as one of three subfamilies within Alliaceae. As phylogenetically constructed, Gilliesioideae (Gilliesioideae (Lindl.) Am., Botany: 134. 1832 - Gilliesieae Lindl. in Bot. Reg.: ad t. 992. 1826.) consisted of those New World Alliaceae not included in the other two subfamilies, which included both the former Gilliesieae together with &quot;Ipheion&quot;, &quot;Leucocoryne&quot;, &quot;Nothoscordum&quot;, and &quot;Tristagma&quot;. This is the circumscription which the Angiosperm Phylogeny Group (APG) accepted in the APG classification of 1998 and which later became known as Alliaceae &quot;sensu stricto&quot; (&quot;s.s.&quot;).

This construction of Gilliesioideae, implicitly recognised that it was composed of two groups or tribes, informally referred to as Ipheieae and Gilliesieae. The Ipheieae were actinomorphic, and included &quot;Ipheion&quot;, &quot;Nothoscordum&quot;, &quot;Leucocoryne&quot; &quot;s.l.&quot; (including &quot;Pabellonia&quot; and &quot;Stemmatium&quot;). Further phylogenetic analysis revealed that &quot;Ipheion&quot; was not monophyletic but rather biphyletic with some species clustering with &quot;Tristagma&quot;, and others with &quot;Nothoscordum&quot; (Fay 2006) although the division into sections was later supported. Research published in 2010 suggests that although related to genera such as &quot;Tristagma&quot; and &quot;Nothoscordum&quot;, it is a distinct genus of 3 species. However, other sources do not recognize the genus, placing all the &quot;Ipheion&quot; species in &quot;Tristagma&quot;.

&quot;Ipheion&quot; section &quot;Hirtellum&quot; was raised to genus rank in 2014 under the older name of &quot;Beauverdia&quot;, with four species found in Argentina, southern Brazil, and Uruguay. This corresponds to Group 3 of Sassone &quot;et al.&quot; 2013. This leaves &quot;Ipheion&quot; section &quot;Ipheion &quot;representing the genus, but further work is required. This cluster (Group 2 in the cladistic analysis of Sassone &quot;et al.&quot; 2013) which clusters with &quot;Tristagma&quot; may either be an independent genus, or a section of the latter genus. These are the three species listed here.
