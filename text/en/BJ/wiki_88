<text>In mathematics, more specifically in topology, an open map is a function between two topological spaces that maps open sets to open sets. 
That is, a function formula_1 is open if for any open set formula_2 in formula_3 the image formula_4 is open in formula_5 
Likewise, a closed map is a function that maps closed sets to closed sets. 
A map may be open, closed, both, or neither; in particular, an open map need not be closed and vice versa.

Open and closed maps are not necessarily continuous. Further, continuity is independent of openness and closedness in the general case and a continuous function may have one, both, or neither property; this fact remains true even if one restricts oneself to metric spaces. 
Although their definitions seem more natural, open and closed maps are much less important than continuous maps. 
Recall that, by definition, a function formula_1 is continuous if the preimage of every open set of formula_7 is open in formula_8 (Equivalently, if the preimage of every closed set of formula_7 is closed in formula_10).

Early study of open maps was pioneered by Simion Stoilow and Gordon Thomas Whyburn.

==Definitions and characterizations==

If formula_11 is a subset of a topological space then let formula_12 and formula_13 (resp. formula_14) denote the closure (resp. interior) of formula_11 in that space. 
Let formula_1 be a function between topological spaces. If formula_11 is any set then formula_18 is called the image of formula_11 under formula_20 

===Competing definitions===

There are two different competing, but closely related, definitions of &quot;&quot; that are widely used, where both of these definitions can be summarized as: &quot;it is a map that sends open sets to open sets.&quot; 
The following terminology is sometimes used to distinguish between the two definitions. 

A map formula_1 is called a
* &quot; if whenever formula_2 is an open subset of the domain formula_10 then formula_4 is an open subset of formula_25&#x27;s codomain formula_5 
* &quot; if whenever formula_2 is an open subset of the domain formula_10 then formula_4 is an open subset of formula_25&#x27;s image formula_31 where as usual, this set is endowed with the subspace topology induced on it by formula_25&#x27;s codomain formula_5 

Every strongly open map is a relatively open map. However, these definitions are not equivalent in general. 

:Warning: Many authors define &quot;open map&quot; to mean &quot; open map&quot; (for example, The Encyclopedia of Mathematics) while others define &quot;open map&quot; to mean &quot; open map&quot;. In general, these definitions are equivalent so it is thus advisable to always check what definition of &quot;open map&quot; an author is using. 

A surjective map is relatively open if and only if it is strongly open; so for this important special case the definitions are equivalent. 
More generally, a map formula_1 is relatively open if and only if the surjection formula_35 is a strongly open map. 

Because formula_10 is always an open subset of formula_3 the image formula_38 of a strongly open map formula_1 must be an open subset of its codomain formula_5 In fact, a relatively open map is a strongly open map if and only if its image is an open subset of its codomain. 
In summary,

:A map is strongly open if and only if it is relatively open and its image is an open subset of its codomain.

By using this characterization, it is often straightforward to apply results involving one of these two definitions of &quot;open map&quot; to a situation involving the other definition. 

The discussion above will also apply to closed maps if each instance of the word &quot;open&quot; is replaced with the word &quot;closed&quot;.

===Open maps===

A map formula_1 is called an &#x27; or a &#x27; if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions: 

If formula_42 is a basis for formula_10 then the following can be appended to this list:

===Closed maps===

A map formula_1 is called a if whenever formula_45 is a closed subset of the domain formula_10 then formula_47 is a closed subset of formula_25&#x27;s image formula_31 where as usual, this set is endowed with the subspace topology induced on it by formula_25&#x27;s codomain formula_5 

A map formula_1 is called a &#x27; or a &#x27; if it satisfies any of the following equivalent conditions: 

A surjective map is strongly closed if and only if it is relatively closed. So for this important special case, the two definitions are equivalent. 
By definition, the map formula_1 is a relatively closed map if and only if the surjection formula_54 is a strongly closed map. 

If in the open set definition of &quot;continuous map&quot; (which is the statement: &quot;every preimage of an open set is open&quot;), both instances of the word &quot;open&quot; are replaced with &quot;closed&quot; then the statement of results (&quot;every preimage of a closed set is closed&quot;) is to continuity. 
This does not happen with the definition of &quot;open map&quot; (which is: &quot;every image of an open set is open&quot;) since the statement that results (&quot;every image of a closed set is closed&quot;) is the definition of &quot;closed map&quot;, which is in general equivalent to openness. There exist open maps that are not closed and there also exist closed maps that are not open. This difference between open/closed maps and continuous maps is ultimately due to the fact that for any set formula_55 only formula_56 is guaranteed in general, whereas for preimages, equality formula_57 always holds.

==Examples==

The function formula_58 defined by formula_59 is continuous, closed, and relatively open, but not (strongly) open. This is because if formula_60 is any open interval in formula_25&#x27;s domain formula_62 that does contain formula_63 then formula_64 where this open interval is an open subset of both formula_62 and formula_66 However, if formula_60 is any open interval in formula_62 that contains formula_63 then formula_70 which is not an open subset of formula_25&#x27;s codomain formula_62 but an open subset of formula_73 Because the set of all open intervals in formula_62 is a basis for the Euclidean topology on formula_75 this shows that formula_58 is relatively open but not (strongly) open. 

If formula_7 has the discrete topology (that is, all subsets are open and closed) then every function formula_1 is both open and closed (but not necessarily continuous). 
For example, the floor function from formula_62 to formula_80 is open and closed, but not continuous. 
This example shows that the image of a connected space under an open or closed map need not be connected. 

Whenever we have a product of topological spaces formula_81 the natural projections formula_82 are open (as well as continuous). 
Since the projections of fiber bundles and covering maps are locally natural projections of products, these are also open maps. 
Projections need not be closed however. Consider for instance the projection formula_83 on the first component; then the set formula_84 is closed in formula_85 but formula_86 is not closed in formula_87 
However, for a compact space formula_88 the projection formula_89 is closed. This is essentially the tube lemma.

To every point on the unit circle we can associate the angle of the positive formula_90-axis with the ray connecting the point with the origin. This function from the unit circle to the half-open interval [0,2π) is bijective, open, and closed, but not continuous. 
It shows that the image of a compact space under an open or closed map need not be compact. 
Also note that if we consider this as a function from the unit circle to the real numbers, then it is neither open nor closed. Specifying the codomain is essential.

==Sufficient conditions==

Every homeomorphism is open, closed, and continuous. In fact, a bijective continuous map is a homeomorphism if and only if it is open, or equivalently, if and only if it is closed. 

The composition of two (strongly) open maps is an open map and the composition of two (strongly) closed maps is a closed map. However, the composition of two relatively open maps need not be relatively open and similarly, the composition of two relatively closed maps need not be relatively closed. 
If formula_1 is strongly open (respectively, strongly closed) and formula_92 is relatively open (respectively, relatively closed) then formula_93 is relatively open (respectively, relatively closed). 

Let formula_1 be a map. 
Given any subset formula_95 if formula_1 is a relatively open (respectively, relatively closed, strongly open, strongly closed, continuous, surjective) map then the same is true of its restriction 
formula_97
to the formula_25-saturated subset formula_99

The categorical sum of two open maps is open, or of two closed maps is closed. 
The categorical product of two open maps is open, however, the categorical product of two closed maps need not be closed. 

A bijective map is open if and only if it is closed. 
The inverse of a bijective continuous map is a bijective open/closed map (and vice versa). 
A surjective open map is not necessarily a closed map, and likewise, a surjective closed map is not necessarily an open map. All local homeomorphisms, including all coordinate charts on manifolds and all covering maps, are open maps. 

A variant of the closed map lemma states that if a continuous function between locally compact Hausdorff spaces is proper then it is also closed. 

In complex analysis, the identically named open mapping theorem states that every non-constant holomorphic function defined on a connected open subset of the complex plane is an open map. 

The invariance of domain theorem states that a continuous and locally injective function between two formula_100-dimensional topological manifolds must be open. 

In functional analysis, the open mapping theorem states that every surjective continuous linear operator between Banach spaces is an open map. 
This theorem has been generalized to topological vector spaces beyond just Banach spaces. 

A surjective map formula_1 is called an &#x27; if for every formula_102 there exists some formula_103 such that formula_90 is a &#x27; for formula_105 which by definition means that for every open neighborhood formula_2 of formula_107 formula_4 is a neighborhood of formula_109 in formula_7 (note that the neighborhood formula_4 is not required to be an neighborhood). 
Every surjective open map is an almost open map but in general, the converse is not necessarily true. 
If a surjection formula_112 is an almost open map then it will be an open map if it satisfies the following condition (a condition that does depend in any way on formula_7&#x27;s topology formula_114): 
:whenever formula_115 belong to the same fiber of formula_25 (that is, formula_117) then for every neighborhood formula_118 of formula_119 there exists some neighborhood formula_120 of formula_100 such that formula_122 
If the map is continuous then the above condition is also necessary for the map to be open. That is, if formula_1 is a continuous surjection then it is an open map if and only if it is almost open and it satisfies the above condition.

==Properties==

===Open or closed maps that are continuous===

If formula_1 is a continuous map that is also open closed then: 
* if formula_25 is a surjection then it is a quotient map and even a hereditarily quotient map,
** A surjective map formula_1 is called if for every subset formula_95 the restriction formula_128 is a quotient map. 
* if formula_25 is an injection then it is a topological embedding.
* if formula_25 is a bijection then it is a homeomorphism.

In the first two cases, being open or closed is merely a sufficient condition for the conclusion that follows. 
In the third case, it is necessary as well. 

===Open continuous maps===

If formula_1 is a continuous (strongly) open map, formula_132 and formula_133 then:

<text>Vanity of Duluoz: An Adventurous Education, 1935–46 is a 1968 semi-autobiographical novel by Jack Kerouac. The book describes the adventures of Kerouac&#x27;s alter ego, Jack Duluoz, covering the period of his life between 1935 and 1946. The book includes reminiscences of the author&#x27;s high school experiences in Lowell, Massachusetts, his education at Columbia University, and his subsequent naval service during World War II. It culminates with the beginnings of the beat movement. It was Kerouac&#x27;s last work published during his life. The tone of the book has been noted for its stark contrast to &quot;On the Road&quot;.

==Background==
When Kerouac wrote &quot;Vanity of Duluoz&quot; in 1967 he had already been disenchanted and suffered alcoholism for several years, and his literary output had decreased. Typical of his memoir-style writing (but using a more structured grammar style he had abandoned after his first novel The Town and the City), the book delves into his past in Lowell and New York, and narrates his various travels and other living situations. It revolves around the time of the pre-WWII and war years and his time in college and the merchant marines, and concludes with his life in the early renaissance of the Beat Generation. However, due to Kerouac&#x27;s rambling style the book is frequently laced with comments on his contemporary world, his mid-life musings, and jabberwocky-like wordplay, and through certain portions of the book, he addresses the narration to &quot;wifey&quot;.

Towards the end of the book, in Book 13, Kerouac identifies the meaning of his vanity with the words of King Solomon found in Ecclesiastes: &quot;There is nothing new under the sun;&quot; &quot;All is vanity.&quot;

==Character Key ==
Kerouac often based his fictional characters on friends and family.

<doc id="372105" wikidata="Q8026915" url="?curid=372105" title="Wiremu Kīngi Te Rangitāke">
<text>Wiremu Kīngi Te Rangitāke ( – 13 January 1882) was a Māori chief of the Te Āti Awa iwi (tribe) and leader of the Māori forces in the First Taranaki War.

Te Rangitāke was born probably in the final years of the 19th century at Manukorihi pa, near Waitara. He was the son of the chief Te Rere-tā-whangawhanga and his wife Te Kehu and had three younger brothers. He took the name Wiremu Kīngi when he was baptised a Christian in the early 1840s.

He and his father were involved in the major disturbances and migrations caused by the Musket Wars. They probably fought alongside Te Rauparaha during Ngāti Toa&#x27;s migration from Kāwhia to the Kapiti coast in 1822. The Te Āti Awa returned to Taranaki in about 1823. Te Rere-tā-whangawhanga and others led the tribe south in the Heke Niho-puta migration in about 1824 to settle in Waikanae. He and Te Rangitāke participated in Te Āti Awa expeditions with Ngāti Toa and Ngāti Raukawa in the North Island and the South Island. Te Rere-tā-whangawhanga was, for example, on the expedition against Ngāi Tahu in the 1831–32 summer.

In 1839 Colonel William Wakefield persuaded the chiefs to sign deeds that transferred ownership of most of the Te Āti Awa tribal land to the New Zealand Company. The transaction was to cause a great deal of trouble and eventually was a factor that led to war.

Te Āti Awa initially accepted the changes brought about by the arrival of &quot;Pākehā&quot; (European settlers) and their new government. In May 1840 their chiefs signed the Treaty of Waitangi and in 1843–1844 they built a large and beautiful church for the missionaries. On 31 January 1842 the whole of Northern Taranaki from Cape Egmont northwards to the Tongaporutu River was purchased by the Crown from Te Wherowhero, who later became the first Maori king, and his brother Kati for 150 pounds, 2 horses, 2 saddles, 2 bridles and 100 blankets. The sale included all the land around Waitara that was under the mana of Te Wherowhero. The deed was printed in both English and Maori. However, disenchantment began when the Land Commissioner, William Spain, awarded the New Plymouth settlers 200 km² of tribal land around New Plymouth. Wiremu Kīngi wrote to Governor Robert FitzRoy making it clear that they would not yield their tribal lands, particularly around Waitara. Their case was weakened in the minds of settlers because the bulk of the tribe were then living around Waikanae about 250 km to the south since 1822–23. However, despite opposition from the Government, they returned to Taranaki 25 years later, in 1848 and settled around Waitara. Grey recognised that Te Atiawa&#x27;s Wiremu Kīngi had been a valued ally in the 1846 war in Wellington where he had sided with the government forces. Grey was reluctant to take action against someone who had shown his loyalty to the Crown.

Over the next 11 years the government and settlers made numerous attempts to acquire more of the tribal land, but were restricted to about 20 km² around New Plymouth. Wiremu Kīngi remained firm in his refusal to part with any of the tribal land. Gradually relations between the two peoples deteriorated. However, despite his concern with retaining land Kīngi did not support the largely Waikato-centred King movement.

In 1859 a minor tribal chief, Teira, who was feuding with Kīngi, made an offer of some land directly to Governor Thomas Gore Browne. The government accepted the offer despite warnings from many influential missionaries such as Octavius Hadfield and a previous Chief Justice, William Martin, that the purchase was illegal.

The stakes grew as Kīngi refused to budge. Prominent settlers called for him to be surrounded, deported and, if he fired one shot, hanged. The Government pressed ahead and sent in surveyors, declaring that once the survey was complete, the land would be occupied by the military to prevent any Māori occupation. They were blocked by the Te Atiawa people, so the army was sent in. The first shots of the First Taranaki War were fired on 17 March 1860. The war lasted a year and decided nothing except that the Māori were better tacticians than the Pākehā. There followed an uneasy truce when the government agreed to re-examine the question and, three years later, Governor George Grey renounced the purchase.

After the war Kīngi withdrew inland beyond the areas influenced by the Pākehā with the people of Ngati Maru at Manutangihia, in the upper reaches of the Waitara River. In 1863 Kīngi went to the Waikato to take part in this campaign. He was at Rangiriri Pa after the defeat at Meremere by General Cameron. Like many of the leaders he found a reason to leave Rangiriri as the British army, supported by militia and kupapa (loyal) Maori closed in. When the British gunboats appeared Wiremu Kīngi left After 12 years he returned to New Plymouth to make his peace with the Pākehā government and later retired to Parihaka where he lived with the prophet Te Whiti o Rongomai for several years. His last years were spent at Kaingaru near Waitara where he died on 13 January 1882.

In 2004, the New Plymouth District Council resolved to sell 146 ha of land at Waitara to the Crown on condition that it was used in settlement of Te Atiawa claims under the Treaty of Waitangi. Leaseholders mounted unsuccessful legal opposition in 2008 and 2011.

His great grandson was Jack McLeod who played nine matches for the New Zealand rugby league team and represented Taranaki, Auckland, Auckland Māori and New Zealand Māori. McLeod&#x27;s mother was Ada Rahunga McLeod (nee Peters), who was Kingi&#x27;s granddaughter from his second wife (Haupani Mere Peters).

<text>The is one of the constituent companies of the Japan Railways Group (JR Group), and is often referred to using its official abbreviation of . It operates intercity and local rail services in Hokkaido, Japan. The company introduced Kitaca, a smart card ticketing system, in autumn 2008.

At the time of its privatization in 1987, JR Hokkaido operated 21 railway lines totalling of narrow-gauge () track, as well as a ferry service to Aomori. Since then, that figure has dwindled to just below , as unprofitable lines have been shut down or spun off (in the case of the Hokkaidō Chihoku Kōgen Railway). The ferry service has also been replaced by the Seikan Tunnel.

On 19 November 2016, JR Hokkaido&#x27;s president announced plans to further rationalize its network by the withdrawal of services from up to 1,237 km, or about 50% of the current network, including closure of the remaining section of the Rumoi Main Line (the Rumoi - Mashike section closed on 4 December 2016, the Ishikari-Numata to Rumoi section on 31 March 2023 and the Fugagawa to Ishikari-Numata section will close on 31 March 2026), the Shin-Yubari - Yubari section of the Sekisho Line (closed on 1 April 2019), the non-electrified section of the Sassho Line (closed 17 April 2020) and the Nemuro Line between Furano and Shintoku (closed 31 March 2024). Other lines including the Sekihoku Main Line, Senmo Main Line, the Nayoro - Wakkanai section of the Soya Line and Kushiro - Nemuro section of the Nemuro Line are proposed for conversion to Third Sector operation, but if local governments are not agreeable, such sections will also face closure. JR Hokkaido closed 25 stations from March 2021 to March 2022 due to a decrease in passengers.
JR Hokkaido&#x27;s headquarters are in Chūō-ku, Sapporo.

<text>The , commonly known as , is the smallest of the seven constituent companies of the Japan Railways Group (JR Group). It operates of intercity and local rail services in the four prefectures on the island of Shikoku in Japan. The company has its headquarters in Takamatsu, Kagawa.

==Lines==

In 1988 JR Shikoku, unlike other JR companies, discontinued the classification of its rail lines as either main, secondary, or branch lines. Prior to the change, the Dosan, Kōtoku, Tokushima, and Yosan Lines had all been main lines.

Each line is color-coded and labeled with a letter, in conjunction with which a number is assigned to each station on the line. For example, Naruto Station on the Naruto Line (labeled N) is numbered N10. Although this method is now widely used by rail companies, especially metro systems in Japan, JR Shikoku was the first JR company to adopt it.


== Train services ==
JR Shikoku provides intercity transportation with its limited express services, connecting major cities on the island of Shikoku with Okayama on Honshū. The company also operates local trains.

<doc id="372109" wikidata="Q498366" url="?curid=372109" title="Kyushu Railway Company">
<text>The , also referred to as , is one of the seven constituent companies of Japan Railways Group (JR Group). It operates intercity rail services within Kyushu, Japan. It formerly operated the Beetle hydrofoil service across the Tsushima Strait between Fukuoka and Busan, South Korea, before its discontinuation in 2024. It also operates hotels, restaurants, and drugstores across its service region. JR Kyushu&#x27;s headquarters are in Hakata-ku, Fukuoka.

==History==
When Japanese National Railways was divided in 1987, Kyushu Railway Company inherited its assets and operations on the island of Kyushu along with losses of around 28.8 billion yen, exacerbated by a growing highway network in Kyushu and many lightly used rural lines. After privatization, JR Kyushu diversified its business into new ventures such as fish and mushroom farming and car sales. Two of its more successful side ventures were the &quot;Beetle&quot; ferry, started in 1991, and the Train d&#x27;or bakery chain, started in 1992. JR Kyushu also built up its premium rail services through the development of the Kyushu Shinkansen high-speed rail line and the &quot;Seven Stars in Kyushu&quot; luxury excursion train.

The company introduced SUGOCA, a smart card ticketing system, from 1 March 2009.

JR Kyushu executed its initial public offering in October 2016. Non-railway operations account for roughly 60% of the company&#x27;s sales and most of its profits.

<doc id="372110" wikidata="Q1190669" url="?curid=372110" title="Japan Freight Railway Company">
<text>, or , is one of the seven constituent companies of Japan Railways Group (JR Group). It provides transportation of cargo nationwide throughout Japan. Its headquarters are in Shibuya, Tokyo near Shinjuku Station.

The Japan Railways Group was founded on 1 April 1987, when Japanese National Railways (JNR) was privatized. Japanese National Railways was divided into six regional passenger rail companies and a single freight railway company, Japan Freight Railway Company.

The company has only about of track of its own, and therefore operates on track owned by the six JR passenger railways as well as other companies which provide rail transport in Japan.

==Economics==
In 2017, only about 5% of all freight in Japan is carried by rail but nearly all of that, 99%, is carried by JR Freight. Trucks carry about 50% and ships about 44%. JR Freight has seen its share of the freight market gradually decrease since 1993. In the 2010s JR Freight has been carrying more freight because of the decrease in the number of available truck drivers due to age as well as government policy to reduce carbon dioxide. JR Freight has run a deficit for many years.

==Lines==

While major part of the operation of JR Freight is on the tracks owned and maintained by other JR companies, JR Freight owns the railway lines (as Category-1 railway business) as follows:

<doc id="372116" wikidata="Q4696635" url="?curid=372116" title="Aida Fariscal">
<text>Aida D. Fariscal (born c. 1940 - died April 2006) was a former police officer and watch commander in the Manila Police Department in the Philippines. Her name is largely unknown outside of the Philippines.

Fariscal spent seventeen years as a homemaker before enrolling in the police department in 1977. The widow of a slain police officer, she rose through the ranks of the Manila Police Department, and in 1983 won an award for arresting three murder suspects on Mindoro Island.

==Antiterrorism==
On the night of January 6, 1995, she was suspicious about a small fire that went out unassisted at the Doña Josefa Apartments; her suspicions were augmented by a wave of bombings that hit Metro Manila, and Philippine Airlines Flight 434. This led her to uncover a terrorist plot made by alleged Al Qaida agents named Operation Bojinka. She came to the apartment with a partner, looked around, and left after a telephone rang, fearing that it might be a remote trigger for an explosive.

She had to ask 11 judges to find one that would grant her a search warrant. She, along with a group of investigators and police then uncovered evidence, before arresting a suspect who called himself Ahmed Saeed. She refused to let go of the suspect, who turned out to be Abdul Hakim Murad, after he offered her 110,740 Philippine pesos ($2,000 U.S. dollars).

Her decision to investigate the fire possibly saved thousands of lives, including possibly that of Pope John Paul II. She received a monetary award of the equivalent of 33,222 pesos ($700) and a trip to Taiwan from the government. She also won a laminated award from the CIA for her action. The certificate reads, &quot;Awarded to Senior Inspector Aida D. Fariscal, in recognition of your personal outstanding efforts and co-operation.&quot; After she foiled the plot, the Philippine police assigned her two bodyguards for five years. The bodyguard service ended shortly before September 11, 2001.

<text>The Saikyō Line () is a Japanese railway line operated by the East Japan Railway Company (JR East). It connects Ōsaki Station in Shinagawa, Tokyo, and Ōmiya Station in Saitama Prefecture. The line&#x27;s name is a portmanteau of the two areas the line connects: Saitama () and Tōkyō ().

At the northern end of the line, some trains continue beyond Ōmiya as far as on the Kawagoe Line; at the southern end of the line, many Saikyō Line trains continue onward beyond Ōsaki to either on the Rinkai Line (operated by Tokyo Waterfront Area Rapid Transit) or on the Sotetsu Main Line (via the Sōtetsu Shin-Yokohama Line). Moreover, despite the line’s name, some trains only go between Kanagawa and Shinjuku, without continuing to Saitama. Beside the link that connects the Saikyō and Rinkai lines is the JR East Tokyo General Rolling Stock Centre that stores the rolling stock for the Yamanote Line and other types of rolling stock; and the Hinkaku Line which links Saikyo Line to the Tokaido Freight Line and Sotetsu-JR Link Line.

==Route==
The line runs parallel to the Yamanote Line between Ōsaki and Ikebukuro, where it is formally called the Yamanote Freight Line (), and as an alternate route to the Tōhoku Main Line between Akabane and Ōmiya, where it is unofficially called the Tōhoku Honsen Secondary Line (). The portion between Ikebukuro and Akabane is officially known as the Akabane Line (). For most purposes, JR refers to all of these as part of the &quot;Saikyō Line&quot; when being used for Saikyō Line services.

==Service==
There are three types of trains on the Saikyō Line: , , and . Between Akabane and Musashi-Urawa, Rapid trains stop only at Toda-Kōen, while Commuter Rapid trains, which run during rush hours, stop only at Musashi-Urawa between Akabane and Ōmiya. Between Akabane and Ikebukuro, as well as on the Kawagoe and Rinkai lines, all trains stop at all stations. Between Ikebukuro and Osaki on the Yamanote Freight Line, all trains run limited-stop in both directions, with the Yamanote Line providing all-stations service.

==Station list==
* Local trains stop at all stations.
* Rapid and commuter rapid trains stop at stations marked &quot;●&quot; and pass those marked &quot;｜&quot;.

==Rolling stock==
* JR East 205 series 10-car EMUs (July 1989October 2016)
* JR East E233-7000 series 10-car EMUs (since June 2013)
* TWR 70-000 series 10-car EMUs (since 1996)
* Sotetsu 12000 series 10-car EMUs (since 30 November 2019)

Per 30 November 2019 schedule change, services on the Saikyo Line, Kawagoe Line, Rinkai Line, and Sōtetsu Main Line are operated by a fleet of 38 10-car E233-7000 series electric multiple unit (EMU) trains owned by JR East and based at Kawagoe Depot, 10-car TWR 70-000 series EMU trains owned by Tokyo Waterfront Area Rapid Transit and based at Yashio Depot; and 5 sets of Sotetsu 12000 series owned by Sagami Railway and based at Kashiwadai Vehicle Center. The first E233-7000 series trains were delivered in March 2013, entering revenue service from 1 June 2013, gradually displacing the 205 series sets used since 1 July 1989. , all Saikyo Line 205 series sets have been removed from service. With the opening of the Sotetsu-JR Link Line, Sotetsu 12000 series trains begin traveling through to Saikyo Line (via Shonan-Shinjuku Line).

Before the establishment of the Saikyo Line, rolling stock used on the Akabane Line included:
* 72 series 8-car EMUs (1953–1967)
* 101 series 8-car EMUs (1967–1978)
* 103 series 8/10-car EMUs (1978–1985)

==History==
The Akabane Line opened on 1 March 1885 as a segment of the Nippon Railway Shinagawa Line. The company was nationalized in 1906. Electric services on the line began in 1909. From 1972 to 1985, the line was the known as the Akabane Line after being a branch of Yamanote Line.

Before the Saikyo Line, there were several attempts to improve commuter rail service between Saitama and Tokyo. One of the earliest, the , was founded in 1928 but went bankrupt shortly thereafter due to rising land values in the area. Later, in 1968, the Tokyo Metropolitan Board of Transportation proposed to run the new Toei Mita Line to central Ōmiya.

Development of the Saikyo Line began as a Japanese National Railways effort to quell unrest in Saitama regarding the expansion of the Tohoku and Joetsu Shinkansen. During the mid-1970s, local protesters staged sit-ins, demonstrations, and administrative actions to impede the building of the new high-speed lines north of Tokyo. JNR reached a settlement with the activists under which it would build a commuter line to serve these local communities, while being allowed to continue extending the Shinkansen.

The new line, tentatively called the , was built between Ōmiya and Akabane. Through service to Ikebukuro via the existing Akabane Line began on 30 September 1985. The Akabane Line name disappeared from daily use from this time. The Saikyo Line was initially troubled by inadequate train control systems which could not keep pace with its frequency of service; however, these issues were worked out during the first month of service.

When the Tōhoku Main Line portion of the Saikyō Line was being built, the stations from Kita-Akabane to Kita-Yono were designated with numbers from 1 to 10; Kita-Akabane Station was known as &quot;New Commuter Line Station No. 1&quot;. However, even after names were assigned, passengers complained that each station looked just like the next due to their identical construction. As a result, JNR, in an unusual move, assigned colors to those stations so that they could be told apart from one another.
On 3 March 1986, the Saikyo Line began through service to Shinjuku via the Yamanote Freight Line, which had seen less use by freight services since the opening of the Musashino Line in 1973. Freight services on the former Akabane Line ended in 1999. Services southward to Shibuya and Ebisu did not begin until 16 March 1996, when new platforms were completed to accommodate passenger service. Through services to Ōsaki and the Rinkai Line began on 1 December 2002.

The Saikyo Line has had a particularly severe problem of overcrowding during peak periods, especially during weekday mornings. The opening of the Shonan-Shinjuku Line in 2004 and the Tokyo Metro Fukutoshin Line in 2008, both of which parallel the Saikyō Line for part of its route, alleviated some of the worst crowding. Problems resulting from overcrowding have included a higher incidence of groping, as well as delays in train schedule caused by longer time taken at each station to pick up and drop off passengers. The Saikyō Line was notorious for having the highest reported number of groping-related incidents (known as &quot;chikan&quot; incidents) in the Greater Tokyo area. This problem was directly addressed by introducing women-only passenger cars during rush hours, and indirectly addressed by reducing overcrowding problems as a whole.

On 20 August 2016, station numbering was introduced with stations being assigned station numbers between JA08 and JA26. Numbers increase towards in the northbound direction towards Omiya.

Beginning 30 November 2019, some Saikyo Line trains travel through to via the Shonan-Shinjuku Line and the Sotetsu JR-Link Line. In the westbound direction (Omiya to Shinjuku, Osaki, and Ebina), Saikyo Line trains enter the Hinkaku Line after Osaki, stopping at Nishi-Oi and Musashi-Kosugi. After Musashi-Kosugi, trains enter the Tokaido Freight Line track. Near , the train enters the Sotetsu-JR Link Line.

<doc id="372119" wikidata="Q801695" url="?curid=372119" title="Ōsaki Station">
<text>is a railway station in Shinagawa, Tokyo, Japan, jointly owned and operated by East Japan Railway Company (JR East) and Tokyo Waterfront Area Rapid Transit (TWR).

==Lines==
Ōsaki Station is served by the following JR East lines.
* Saikyō Line
* Shōnan-Shinjuku Line
* Yamanote Line
It also forms the western starting point of the TWR Rinkai Line to . Most Saikyō Line trains operate through to Shin-Kiba on the Rinkai Line.

==Station layout==

The station has four island platforms serving eight tracks. Platforms 1 to 4 are for the Yamanote Line, and 5 to 8 are shared by the Saikyō Line, the Shōnan-Shinjuku Line, and the Rinkai Line. Ōsaki is one of the stations on the Yamanote Line loop where trains are put into and taken out of service. It therefore has four tracks (two in each direction) for the Yamanote Line so as not to interfere with continuing trains (trains go several rounds before being taken out); usually platforms 1 and 3 are used by regular services, while platforms 2 and 4 are used by trains entering and exiting service. Chest-high platform edge doors were introduced on platforms 1 and 3 from 22 December 2012.

There are two sets of ticket barriers: the &quot;north&quot; and &quot;south&quot; gates. The north gate provides access to the east and west exits, while the south gate provides access to the new east and new west exits.

Unlike most other stations with service from multiple different transport companies, at Ōsaki the Rinkai line and JR services are behind the same fare gates, and it is possible to change between JR and Rinkai lines without exiting and re-entering. Passengers using Suica or another IC card will be charged the combined fare when they exit. Passengers holding a Japan Rail Pass and transferring onto the Rinkai line, which does not accept the pass, will need to pay the Rinkai line fare when they exit at their Rinkai line destination. A similar arrangement applies to passengers travelling through from the Saikyō line to Oimachi or another Rinkai line destination.

===Platforms===




===Facilities===
The station has a &quot;Midori no Madoguchi&quot; staffed ticket office. Toilet facilities are located inside the ticket barriers, close to the north gate.

==History==
The station opened on 25 February 1901, as a station of Nippon Railway, which was nationalized in 1906. After serving the Yamanote Line for a century, on 1 December 2002, new platforms for the Saikyō Line, the Rinkai Line and the Shōnan-Shinjuku Line opened on the west side of the station.

Station numbering was introduced to the Rinkai Line platforms in 2016 with Ōsaki being assigned station number R08. Later in August 2016, station numbering was introduced to the JR East platforms with Osaki being assigned station numbers JS17 for the Shonan-Shinjuku Line, JA08 for the Saikyo Line, and JY24 for the Yamanote Line. At the same time, JR East assigned its major transfer stations in the Tokyo area a 3-letter code; Osaki was assigned the code &quot;OSK&quot;.

==Passenger statistics==
In fiscal 2013, the JR East station was used by an average of 143,397 passengers daily (boarding passengers only), making it the eighteenth-busiest station operated by JR East. In fiscal 2013, the TWR station was used by an average of 58,041 people daily (boarding passengers only), making it the busiest station operated by TWR. The average boarding passenger figures for previous years are as shown below.

<text>George Smitherman (born February 12, 1964) is a former Canadian politician and broadcaster. He represented the provincial riding of Toronto Centre in the Legislative Assembly of Ontario from 1999 to 2010, when he resigned to contest the mayoralty of Toronto in the 2010 municipal election. Smitherman is the first openly gay Member of Provincial Parliament (MPP) elected in Ontario, and the province&#x27;s first openly gay cabinet minister.

Smitherman was a candidate in the 2018 municipal election running for Toronto City Council in Ward 13 Toronto Centre which included much of the provincial riding he represented as an MPP. He received 15% of the vote, failing to unseat incumbent Kristyn Wong-Tam who received 50%.
Since March 2020 he has been president and CEO of the Cannabis Council of Canada.

==Background==
Smitherman was born at Humber Memorial Hospital (now Humber River Regional Hospital Church site) in Weston, Ontario and spent much of his early years in Etobicoke (he briefly lived in East York, Ontario). He is the son of Irene Margaret (Wood) and Arthur Smitherman, and one of four children. Smitherman spent much time working with his father&#x27;s business, Smitty&#x27;s Haulage (later Sure-Way Transport).

Smitherman admitted a five-year addiction to an illegal drug before running for political office. Smitherman has not indicated the specific drugs he was addicted to during this time, except to say that they were part of the &quot;Toronto party scene&quot;, and that &quot;the drugs were not injected&quot;. He is estranged from his older brother, saying they didn&#x27;t fall out but just drifted apart. Arthur, who ran for city council from Ward 8, endorsed Rob Ford for mayor.

On August 5, 2007, Smitherman married his partner, Christopher Peloso, near Elliot Lake, Ontario. Peloso was a manager with Lindt &amp; Sprüngli. On September 26, 2009, the &quot;Toronto Star&quot; reported that Smitherman and Peloso had been approved as adoptive parents by the Toronto Children&#x27;s Aid Society. They adopted two children named Michael and Kayla. Peloso also had a daughter from a previous relationship. Peloso, who was reportedly suffering from clinical depression, was found dead after going missing in December 2013.

==Early politics==
Smitherman was active in politics at Burnhamthorpe Collegiate Institute, where he was the high school&#x27;s student council president. He left high school before graduation. He dabbled in municipal politics in Etobicoke. Smitherman decided against post-secondary education and began his political career. He worked as an organizer for the Ontario Liberal Party and Premier David Peterson. He was chief of staff to Ontario cabinet minister Hugh O&#x27;Neil and senior advisor to Ontario federal political ministers Herb Gray and David Collenette. He was chief of staff and campaign manager to one-time Mayor of Toronto Barbara Hall. He also ran a private consulting business and co-owned a photofinishing shop in downtown Toronto until 1994.

==Provincial politics==
In the 1999 provincial election Smitherman was nominated as the Liberal Party candidate for the riding of Toronto Centre-Rosedale. Former Toronto mayor John Sewell was running as an independent candidate, and activists accusing him of splitting the left-wing vote with the New Democratic Party. Although a Progressive Conservative government was re-elected, Smitherman won the seat for the Liberals.

In the legislature, Smitherman was nicknamed &quot;Furious George&quot; for his aggressive and often abrasive manner, and rose to become McGuinty&#x27;s right-hand man and favourite &quot;attack dog&quot;. When asked about this nickname, Smitherman mockingly said that he was an &quot;attack poodle&quot;. In the 2003 election Smitherman was re-elected and the Liberals won the election. Dalton McGuinty was sworn in as the 24th Premier of Ontario on October 23, 2003. Smitherman was named to cabinet as Minister of Health and Long-Term Care and the Toronto Regional Minister. In 2006, he was additionally named Deputy Premier of Ontario.

Under Smitherman&#x27;s leadership, the Ministry of Health and Long-Term Care launched the Wait Times Strategy in 2004. The new health care model was designed to reduce wait times for various procedures such as hip and knee replacement, MRIs and CT scans. The Wait Times Strategy also focused on shrinking wait times for cancer, cardiac and cataracts surgeries.

Smitherman also launched the Ministry&#x27;s &quot;Aging at Home&quot; strategy in 2007. The initiative focused on delivering enhanced community health care services and enabling seniors to live independent, healthy lives at home through home care and other community-based services.

In the 2007 election, Smitherman was re-elected as the MPP for Toronto Centre and continued in his roles as Minister of Health and Long-Term Care, Deputy Premier and Toronto Regional Minister.

However, Smitherman was criticized for ignoring calls for an independent investigation into &quot;C. difficile&quot; deaths in hospitals, and he was unable improve the lives of nursing home residents who were often forced to sit in soiled diapers for hours on end. Smitherman was also criticized for failures related to the implementation of an electronic health records system called eHealth that partly occurred during his tenure as Minister of Health and Long-Term Care. eHealth was under criticism for awarding no-bid contracts, as well as the $647 million spent on its predecessor, Smart Systems for Health Agency, which was shut down and restarted as eHealth. Smitherman&#x27;s successor David Caplan resigned as Minister in 2009 to take responsibility for mistakes that were made.
On June 20, 2008, Smitherman was shuffled to the new Ministry of Energy and Infrastructure, a merger of two formerly separate government departments. McGuinty dismissed suggestions that he combined the energy and infrastructure portfolios to satisfy Smitherman, saying, &quot;I think it&#x27;s a great fit, it&#x27;s a natural fit, and it&#x27;s an essential part of our plan to grow this economy.&quot;

As the Minister of Energy and Infrastructure, Smitherman was responsible for Ontario&#x27;s Green Energy Act, which was passed in September 2009. The Act encourages investment in green energy production by providing businesses the ability to sell energy produced from renewable sources to the province&#x27;s electricity grid through a Feed-in-Tariff program. The Green Energy Act has resulted in a series of record-breaking corporate investments in wind and solar energy worth billions of dollars.

The World Wind Energy Association chose Smitherman as the recipient of their annual World Wind Energy Award in 2009 for his outstanding achievements in making Ontario the leading wind energy jurisdiction in North America.

===Cabinet positions===

==Toronto mayoral election==

On September 9, 2009, Smitherman strongly suggested that he would be running for mayor of Toronto in the upcoming 2010 mayoral election. He emphasized that any official announcements would not come before &quot;the unofficial campaign season municipally begins in the new year&quot;.

On November 8, Smitherman announced his resignation from the provincial cabinet in order to run for mayor. He remained in the legislature as a backbench MPP until January 4, 2010.

In April 2010, Smitherman&#x27;s campaign manager, Jeff Bangs, resigned and was replaced by Bruce Davis, chair of the Toronto District School Board and a veteran of local politics.

On August 21, 2010, the Ontario Liberal Party began distributing pamphlets, listing Smitherman&#x27;s provincial record and endorsements, to 75,000 identified Liberal voters. This partisan endorsement led to speculation that Smitherman&#x27;s political fortunes were connected with those of the Liberal provincial government. Several other mayoral candidates criticized Premier McGuinty and the provincial Liberals for jumping into the race.

Smitherman admitted telling a volunteer working for rival Rocco Rossi to &quot;screw off&quot;. Smitherman claims he was set up by Rossi&#x27;s campaign and he said the young woman tried to hand him a paper questioning his work with youth before a debate.

Smitherman&#x27;s campaign has been criticized for swaying first to the left and then the right. After Labour Day, he made fiscal promises to freeze property taxes for a year and cut down on reckless spending.

Following the results of a Nanos Research poll, released on September 19, Smitherman made the following statement &quot;The polling that we&#x27;ve seen tells us that if an election was held now, Rob Ford would be our mayor,&quot; Smitherman said. &quot;That obviously provokes a certain distaste and reinforces for us that we need to work harder for the values of our city.&quot; The poll put Ford&#x27;s level of support at 45.8% among decided voters. Smitherman held 21.3%, Joe Pantalone 16.8%, Rocco Rossi stood at 9.7% and Sarah Thomson at 6.4%. Smitherman vowed to lead the &quot;anybody-but-Ford&quot; movement and encouraged strategic voting.

In October, Smitherman picked up support. Sarah Thomson dropped out and endorsed Smitherman. Smitherman and his staff were also pressing some of Rocco Rossi’s key supporters to switch; Rossi soon dropped out due to being unable to improve poll numbers but did not endorse any other candidates. Former Toronto (pre-amalgamation) mayors David Crombie and Art Eggleton also endorsed Smitherman. Several left-leaning councilors who were normally allies of Joe Pantalone, Joe Mihevc, Adam Vaughan, and Pam McConnell, decided to back Smitherman&#x27;s campaign instead. Smitherman urged strategic voting and repeatedly asserted, &quot;a vote for Joe Pantalone is a vote for Rob Ford.&quot; Smitherman also left a voice-mail for outgoing Mayor David Miller, hoping that Miller would persuade Pantalone to bow out, but Miller never returned the call (back in 2003, Barbara Hall&#x27;s campaign used back-channel efforts to discourage Miller&#x27;s run for mayor) and gave a public endorsement of Pantalone instead. Following the results of the October 18 Angus Reid Public Opinion Poll, Smitherman and Ford were practically tied for first place, with Ford at 41% and Smitherman at 40%.

On election day, Smitherman finished second with 35.6% of the vote compared to Ford who won 47.1%.

==Post-political career==
Smitherman joined radio station CFRB on an occasional basis in January 2011. He turned down an invitation from Premier McGuinty to run in the 2011 provincial election but said he intended to run for office again at some point in the future.

He was the chairman and principal at the consulting firm he founded, G &amp; G Global Solutions and also a zone advisor to Ryerson University&#x27;s Digital Media Zone.

He also serves on the boards of medical marijuana producer THC Meds Ontario Inc., drone maker Alta Vista Ventures and mining company Ceylon Graphite.

Smitherman considered returning to politics and seeking the Liberal Party of Canada&#x27;s nomination for a federal by-election in Toronto Centre but announced on July 29, 2013, &quot;I won&#x27;t be a candidate now. I won&#x27;t be contesting a riding in the 2015 general election or any other,&quot; as he prefers to prioritize &quot;fun, family and finances&quot;.

Smitherman wrote a memoir called &quot;Unconventional Candour&quot;, published in 2019 by Dundurn Press.

Smitherman announced in February 2017 that he intended to run for a seat on Toronto City Council for one of the Toronto Centre wards in the 2018 municipal election. He said if he ran, he would divest himself of any current business interests that may pose a conflict. In May 2018, he confirmed that he would be running in Ward 23.

Smitherman had also expressed interest in returning to provincial politics and reclaiming his former riding of Toronto Centre in the 2018 provincial election, which was vacant following the resignation of Glen Murray, but faced resistance from the leadership of the Liberal Party which considered him an unsuitable candidate for the party&#x27;s nomination due to his association with the eHealth scandal as well as his reputation for being difficult and temperamental, and threatened to disqualify his candidacy. In the face of this opposition, Smitherman decided not to pursue the Liberal nomination and instead focus on his municipal campaign.

He originally ran for an open seat but after Ontario Premier Doug Ford&#x27;s government reduced the number of seats on Toronto City Council by half, Smitherman opted to run in Toronto Centre Ward 13 against incumbent councillors Kristyn Wong-Tam and Lucy Troisi for the new ward&#x27;s single seat on council. He came in second, winning 15% of the vote to Wong-Tam&#x27;s 50%.

<text>The Urskog–Høland Line (), also known as Tertitten, is a narrow-gauge railway between Sørumsand and Skulerud in Norway.

==History==
The original line was long and was built in three stages: Urskogbanen opened in 1896, running from Bingsfossen to Bjørkelangen; Hølandsbanen from Bjørkelangen to Skulerud opened in 1898 and finally the line between Bingsfos and Sørumsand in 1903. Today part of the line is preserved as a museum at Sørumsand in Lillestrøm kommune. The railway company was headquartered at Bjørkelangen. The line was built in the least expensive way as a so-called tertiary railway with a gauge track. This gave the line its diminutive, affectionate nickname, &quot;Tertitten&quot;. The railway was run as a privately owned joint stock company until 1945 when it was bought by the government and run by the Norwegian State Railways (NSB) under the name Aurskog-Hølandbanen.

The basis for the railway lay mostly in forest and agriculture products. Lumber was transported to Skulerud and from there it was rafted to Halden. At one time a tour billed as &quot;The Great Roundtrip&quot; was a popular tourist attraction, combining the train ride with a boat ride on the steam ship &quot;DS Turisten&quot; which trafficked the Halden Canal.

===The restoration===
A cooperative consisting of volunteers was established in 1961 with the aim of securing the line for posterity. A 3-kilometer track at Sørumsand was given to the group along with two steam locomotives and some other stock. The first run as a heritage railway was undertaken in 1966. This stretch had no buildings or side tracks, and all facilities which meet the present-day visitor was built after becoming a heritage railway. Three of the steam locomotives and two passenger carriages were restored.

When the heritage railway was established the terminus was just outside the town center of Sørumsand, with the track leading to the station building already having been removed. In 1987 the line had been extended and the first train could depart from the town center again. After another two years the entire operation, including station building, was finished, and the extended track was officially inaugurated. The entire complex is protected by law. The Urskog–Høland Line is now a museum under the umbrella of Museene i Akershus (MiA) run i cooperation with &quot;Venneforeningen Tertitten&quot;.

<doc id="372152" wikidata="Q118895913" url="?curid=372152" title="Flypaper theory (economics)">
<text>The flypaper theory of tax incidence is a pejorative term used by economists to describe the assumption that the burden of a tax, like a fly on flypaper, sticks wherever it first lands.

Economists point out several flaws with the assumption:
* it ignores the elasticity of goods; and
* it ignores the ability of producers to shift the cost of the tax onto consumers.

For example, consider a tax levied on a luxury item such as jewelry. Such a tax, while intended to target the wealthy, may not actually accomplish this objective, as the wealthy can simply choose to buy less jewelry. Instead of collecting more money from the wealthy, the tax has the effect of hurting jewelry merchants, who are not the intended targets of the tax.

As another example, suppose a tax is levied on the sellers of a product. The sellers may simply raise the price of the product, thus shifting the burden of the tax onto the buyers of the product.

This should not be confused with the flypaper effect, which holds that money from a federal authority to a state authority tends to increase overall expenditure rather than merely substitute for locally-raised revenue.

Jämtland and Härjedalen was separated from Västernorrland County and Gävleborg County in 1810 to form the new county, see List of governors of Västernorrland County, List of governors of Gävleborg County before that date.

The governor has the title &quot;landshövding&quot; in Swedish. The governor is appointed by the government, and presides over the &quot;County Administrative Board&quot; (&quot;länsstyrelse&quot;). The governor&#x27;s office is administrative by nature, which is also hinted at by the now obsolete title &quot;the King&#x27;s Deputy&quot; (&quot;Konungens befallningshavande&quot;) and traditionally used as an honourable post for politicians to conclude their careers.

<text>Peter Cooper (February 12, 1791April 4, 1883) was an American industrialist, inventor, philanthropist, and politician. He designed and built the first American steam locomotive, the &quot;Tom Thumb&quot;, founded the Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, served as its first president, and stood for election as the Greenback Party&#x27;s candidate in the 1876 presidential election.

Cooper began tinkering at a young age while working in various positions in New York City. He purchased a glue factory in 1821 and used that factory&#x27;s profits to found the Canton Iron Works, where he earned even larger profits by assembling the &quot;Tom Thumb&quot;. Cooper&#x27;s success as a businessman and inventor continued over the ensuing decades, and he became the first mill operator to successfully use anthracite coal to puddle iron. He also developed numerous patents for products such as gelatin and participated in the laying of the first transatlantic telegraph cable.

During the Gilded Age, Cooper became an ardent critic of the gold standard and the debt-based monetary system of bank currency, advocating instead for government-issued banknotes. Cooper was nominated for president at the 1876 Greenback National Convention, and the Greenback ticket of Cooper and Samuel Fenton Cary won just under one percent of the popular vote in the 1876 presidential election. His son Edward and his son-in-law Abram Hewitt, both served as Mayor of New York City.

==Early years==
Peter Cooper was born in New York City of Dutch, English and Huguenot descent, the fifth child of John Cooper, a Methodist hatmaker from Newburgh, New York. He worked as a coachmaker&#x27;s apprentice, cabinet maker, hatmaker, brewer and grocer, and was throughout a tinkerer: he developed a cloth-shearing machine which he attempted to sell, as well as an endless chain he intended to be used to pull barges and boats on the newly completed Erie Canal (which was routed west to east across upper New York State from Lake Erie to the upper Hudson River) which its chief supporter, the Governor of New York, De Witt Clinton approved of, but which Cooper was unable to sell.

In 1821, Cooper purchased a glue factory on Sunfish Pond on east side Manhattan Island for $2,000 at Kips Bay, where he had access to raw materials from the nearby slaughterhouses, and ran it as a successful business for many years, producing a profit of $10,000 (equivalent to roughly $200,000 in 21st century value today) within 2 years, developing new ways to produce glues and cements, gelatin, isinglass and other products, and becoming the city&#x27;s premier provider to tanners (leather), manufacturers of paints, and dry-goods merchants. The effluent from his successful factory eventually polluted the pond so much that in 1839 it had to be drained and backfilled for eventual building construction.

==Business career==
Having been convinced that the proposed Baltimore and Ohio Railroad would drive up prices for land in Maryland, Cooper used his profits to buy of land there in 1828 and began to develop them, draining swampland and flattening hills, during which he discovered iron ore on his property. Seeing the Baltimore and Ohio Railroad as a natural market for iron rails to be made from his ore, he founded the Canton Iron Works in Baltimore, and when the railroad developed technical problems, he put together the &quot;Tom Thumb&quot; steam locomotive for them in 1829 from various old parts, including musket barrels, and some small-scale steam engines he had fiddled with back in New York. The engine was a rousing success, prompting investors to buy stock in B&amp;O, which enabled the company to buy Cooper&#x27;s iron rails, making him what would be his first fortune.

Cooper began operating an iron rolling mill in New York beginning in 1836, where he was the first to successfully use anthracite coal to puddle iron. Cooper later moved the mill to Trenton, New Jersey, on the Delaware River to be closer to the sources of the raw materials the works needed. His son and son-in-law, Edward Cooper and Abram S. Hewitt, later expanded the Trenton facility into a giant complex employing 2,000 people, in which iron was taken from raw material to finished product.

Cooper also operated a successful glue factory in Gowanda, New York, that produced glue for decades. A glue factory was originally started in association with the Gaensslen Tannery, there, in 1874, though the first construction of the glue factory&#x27;s plant, originally owned by Richard Wilhelm and known as the Eastern Tanners Glue Company, began on May 5, 1904. Gowanda, therefore, was known as America&#x27;s glue capital.

Cooper owned a number of patents for his inventions, including some for the manufacture of gelatin, and he developed standards for its production. While his patent for “Portable Gelatine” bears a remarkable resemblance to the description of the dessert, Jell-O, that product was trademarked decades after Cooper’s patent expired.

Cooper later invested in real estate and insurance, and became one of the richest men in New York City. Despite this, he lived relatively simply in an age when the rich were indulging in more and more luxury. He dressed in simple, plain clothes, and limited his household to only two servants; when his wife bought an expensive and elaborate carriage, he returned it for a more sedate and cheaper one. Cooper remained in his home at Fourth Avenue and 28th Street even after the New York and Harlem Railroad established freight yards where cattle cars were parked practically outside his front door, although he did move to the more genteel Gramercy Park development in 1850.

In 1854, Cooper was one of five men who met at the house of Cyrus West Field in Gramercy Park to form the New York, Newfoundland and London Telegraph Company, and, in 1855, the American Telegraph Company, which bought up competitors and established extensive control over the expanding American network on the Atlantic Coast and in some Gulf coast states. He was among those supervising the laying of the first Transatlantic telegraph cable in 1858.

== Invention of first steel rocking chair (1830s) ==

During the 1830s Cooper designed the first steel chair in America, which was a rocking chair. Cooper produced a functional, minimalist design radically different from the Victorian heavily decorated, ostentatious style of the time. Most rocking chairs had separate rockers fixed to regular chair legs, but Cooper&#x27;s chair used the curve of its frame to ensure the rocking motion. Cooper&#x27;s chair was made of steel or wrought iron with upholstery slung across the frame. The model was manufactured at R.W. Winfield &amp; Co. in Britain. The firm exhibited examples of the chair at the Great Exhibition of the Works of Industry of all Nations (Crystal Palace Exhibition) in 1851 and the Great London Exposition of 1862.

==Political views and career==

In 1840, Cooper became an alderman of New York City.

Prior to the Civil War, Cooper was active in the anti-slavery movement and promoted the application of Christian concepts to solve social injustice. He was a strong supporter of the Union cause during the war and an advocate of the government issue of paper money.

Influenced by the writings of Lydia Maria Child, Cooper became involved in the Indian reform movement, organizing the privately funded United States Indian Commission. This organization, whose members included William E. Dodge and Henry Ward Beecher, was dedicated to the protection and elevation of Native Americans in the United States and the elimination of warfare in the western territories.

Cooper&#x27;s efforts led to the formation of the Board of Indian Commissioners, which oversaw Ulysses S. Grant&#x27;s Peace Policy. Between 1870 and 1875, Cooper sponsored Indian delegations to Washington, D.C., New York City, and other Eastern cities. These delegations met with Indian rights advocates and addressed the public on United States Indian policy. Speakers included: Red Cloud, Little Raven, and Alfred B. Meacham and a delegation of Modoc and Klamath Indians.

Cooper was an ardent critic of the gold standard and the debt-based monetary system of bank currency. Throughout the depression from 1873 to 1878, he said that usury was the foremost political problem of the day. He strongly advocated a credit-based, Government-issued currency of United States Notes. In 1883 his addresses, letters and articles on public affairs were compiled into a book, &quot;Ideas for a Science of Good Government.&quot;

===Presidential candidacy===

Cooper was encouraged to run in the 1876 presidential election for the Greenback Party without any hope of being elected. His running mate was Samuel Fenton Cary. The campaign cost more than $25,000. The election was won by Rutherford Birchard Hayes of the Republican Party. Cooper was surpassed by another unsuccessful candidate, Samuel J. Tilden of the Democratic Party.

===A political family===

In 1813, Cooper married Sarah Bedell (1793–1869). Of their six children, only two survived past the age of four years: a son, Edward and a daughter, Sarah Amelia. Edward served as Mayor of New York City, as would the husband of Sarah Amelia, Abram S. Hewitt, a man also heavily involved in inventions and industrialization.

Peter Cooper&#x27;s granddaughters, Sarah Cooper Hewitt, Eleanor Garnier Hewitt and Amy Hewitt Green founded the Cooper-Hewitt National Design Museum, then named the Cooper-Hewitt Museum, in 1895. It was originally part of The Cooper Union, but since 1967 has been a unit of the Smithsonian Institution.

==Religious views==
Cooper was a Unitarian who regularly attended the services of Henry Whitney Bellows at the Church of All Souls (New York), and his views were Universalistic and non-sectarian. In 1873 he wrote:

I look to see the day when the teachers of Christianity will rise above all the cramping powers and conflicting creeds and systems of human device, when they will beseech mankind by all the mercies of God to be reconciled to the government of love, the only government that can ever bring the kingdom of heaven into the hearts of mankind either here or hereafter.

==The Cooper Union==
Cooper had for many years held an interest in adult education: he had served as head of the Public School Society, a private organization which ran New York City&#x27;s free schools using city money, when it began evening classes in 1848. Cooper conceived of the idea of having a free institute in New York, similar to the École Polytechnique (Polytechnical School) in Paris, which would offer free practical education to adults in the mechanical arts and science, to help prepare young men and women of the working classes for success in business.

In 1853, he broke ground for The Cooper Union for the Advancement of Science and Art, a private college in New York, completing the building in 1859 at the cost of $600,000. The Cooper Union offered open-admission night classes available to men and women alike, and attracted 2,000 responses to its initial offering, although 600 later dropped out. The classes were non-sectarian, and women were treated equally with men, although 95% of the students were male. Cooper started a Women&#x27;s School of Design, which offered daytime courses in engraving, lithography, painting on china and drawing.

The new institution soon became an important part of the community. The Great Hall was a place where the pressing civic controversies of the day could be debated, and, unusually, radical views were not excluded. In addition, the Union&#x27;s library, unlike the nearby Astor, Mercantile and New York Society Libraries, was open until 10:00 at night, so that working people could make use of them after work hours.

Today The Cooper Union is recognized as one of the leading American colleges in the fields of architecture, engineering, and art. Carrying on Peter Cooper&#x27;s belief that college education should be free, The Cooper Union awarded all its students with a full scholarship until fall 2014, when the college began charging tuition, in part, due to the financial impact of construction loans taken before the Great Recession. The college is currently implementing a financial plan to restore full-tuition scholarships for all its undergraduate students by 2029.

==Philanthropy==
In 1851, Cooper was one of the founders of Children&#x27;s Village, originally an orphanage called &quot;New York Juvenile Asylum&quot;, one of the oldest non-profit organizations in the United States.

==Death and legacy==
Cooper died on April 4, 1883, at the age of 92 and is buried in Green-Wood Cemetery in Brooklyn, New York. The lot number of his current burial site is 3932 &amp; C.

Aside from Cooper Union, the Peter Cooper Village apartment complex in Manhattan; the Peter Cooper Elementary School in Ringwood, New Jersey; the Cooper School in Superior, Wisconsin, the Peter Cooper Station post office; Cooper Park in Brooklyn, Cooper Square in Manhattan, and Cooper Square in Hempstead, New York, Peter Cooper Village Senior Section 8 Housing in West Long Branch, New Jersey, are named in his honor.

<text>The pine siskin (Spinus pinus) is a North American bird in the finch family. It is a migratory bird with an extremely sporadic winter range.

==Taxonomy==
The pine siskin was formally described in 1810 by the American ornithologist Alexander Wilson under the binomial name &quot;Fringilla pinus&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;pinus&quot; is the Latin word for a &quot;pine-tree&quot;. The type locality is Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. The pine siskin is now placed in the genus &quot;Spinus&quot; that was introduced in 1816 by the German naturalist Carl Ludwig Koch in 1816.

Three subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;S. p. pinus&quot; (Wilson, A, 1810) – Alaska, Canada and west, northeast USA
* &quot;S. p. macropterus&quot; (Bonaparte, 1850) – northwest and central Mexico 
* &quot;S. p. perplexus&quot; Van Rossem, 1938 – south Mexico to Guatemala

==Description==
These birds are fairly small, being around the same size as the widespread American goldfinch. In both sexes, total length can range from , with a wingspan of and weight of .

Adults are brown on the upperparts and pale on the underparts, with heavy streaking throughout. They have short forked tails. Their bills are conical like most finches but are more elongated and slender than those of other co-occurring finches. Variably, pine siskins have yellow patches on their wings and tails, which may also consist of white streaks on the wings. Although they can be confused by the more inexperienced for other finches or even American sparrows, pine siskins are distinguished by their heavy streaking, relatively slender bills, notched tail, yellow or whitish patches on the wings and smallish size.

===Separation from the Eurasian siskin===
The pine siskin in its typical morph is a drab bird, whereas the Eurasian siskin (a bird the species does not naturally co-exist with), in many plumages, is much brighter. Adult male Eurasian siskins are bright green and yellow with a black cap, and an unstreaked throat and breast; the pine siskin does not have a corresponding bright plumage. Adult female Eurasian siskins also usually have green and yellow plumage tones: for example, yellow in the supercilium and on the sides of the breast, green tones in the mantle and yellow in the rump. Adult pine siskins of the typical morph do not have green and yellow tones, although juveniles can have a yellowish-buff wash on their underparts and buff-toned wingbars, for a short period prior to their autumn migration. The ground colour of the underparts of the Eurasian siskin is normally pure white, whereas on the pine siskin it is usually a dirtier colour. In female and juvenile Eurasian siskins, the centre of the belly and lower breast are often largely or entirely unstreaked, whereas in most pine siskins the streaking extends across the whole of the underparts. The wingbars of the Eurasian siskin are broad and yellow (with the tips white) whereas they are normally narrower and buffish white in the pine siskin, contrasting with the bright yellow flash at the base of the primaries. Pine siskins have a longer bill, usually with a straight culmen, compare with a short bill in Eurasian siskins, with a decurved culmen. There is a green morph of the pine siskin, closer in appearance to the Eurasian siskin; these birds make up only 1% of the population. These are closer in appearance to female Eurasian siskins, but differ in that they have a yellow wash on the undertail-coverts (white on the Eurasian siskin), no yellow in the supercilium, reduced underparts streaking, and much yellow at the base of the tail and remiges; there may also be a difference in the extent of yellow in the underparts, but this needs further study.

==Distribution and habitat==
Their breeding range spreads across almost the entirety of Canada, Alaska and, to a more variable degree, across the western mountains and northern parts of the United States. As their name indicates, the species occurs mostly as a breeder in open conifer forests. Northern pine forests support the majority of the species&#x27; breeding population. However, stands of ornamental conifers or deciduous trees may support nesting birds in partially developed parks, cemeteries, and suburban woodlands. While they favor feeding in open forest canopies where cone seeds are abundant, they&#x27;ll forage in habitats as diverse as deciduous forests and thickets, meadows, grasslands, weedy fields, roadsides, chaparral, and backyard gardens and lawns. They flock to backyard feeders offering small seeds. Mineral deposits can lure them to otherwise unattractive habitats like winter road beds that are salted to melt snow and ice. The nest is well-hidden on a horizontal branch of a tree, often a conifer.

Migration by this bird is highly variable, probably related to food supply. Large numbers may move south in some years; hardly any in others. This species is one of a few species that are considered &quot;irruptive winter finches&quot; because of the high variability of their movements based on the success of crops from year to year.

==Behavior and ecology==
===Feeding===

These birds forage in trees, shrubs and weeds. They mainly eat seeds, plant parts and some insects. In winter, they often feed in mixed flocks including American goldfinches and redpolls. Small seeds, especially thistle, red alder, birch, and spruce seeds, make up the majority of the pine siskin&#x27;s diet. In a part of their esophagus called the crop, the species can store up to 10% of their body weight in seeds overnight, providing extra food on cold days. They will alternately eat the young buds of willows, elms and maples, and the soft stems and leaves of weeds and even young garden vegetables. They glean the seeds of grass, dandelions, chickweed, sunflowers and ragweed. Bird feeders often attract pine siskins, where they may eat fragments of heavy-shelled seeds, such as black oil sunflowers, left behind by heavier-billed bird species. In summer, they will eat many insects, especially aphids, as well as a few spiders and grubs, which they then feed to the young as a protein-rich food that contributes to their growth. By the time of winter, even first-year siskins predominately eat seeds.

Pine siskins can survive in very cold temperatures. The metabolic rates of this species are typically 40% higher than a &quot;normal&quot; songbird of their size. When temperatures plunge as low as , they can accelerate that rate up to five times normal for several hours. They also put on half again as much winter fat as their common redpoll and American goldfinch relatives. They also can protect their young from cold as well. Nests are often heavily insulated with thick plant materials and females may literally never cease incubating their eggs and hatchlings, while being fed by their male mate.

==Conservation status==
Although considered Washington&#x27;s most common finch, the pine siskin has suffered a significant annual decline in population since 1966, according to the Breeding Bird Survey. Due to the irruptive nature of this species, populations vary widely from year to year, and trends can be difficult to interpret. Parasitism by brown-headed cowbirds can have a significant impact on pine siskin productivity, and forest fragmentation has increased their contact with cowbirds. Maintaining large tracts of coniferous forest will help keep this bird common.

<doc id="372198" wikidata="Q3527219" url="?curid=372198" title="Weierstrass preparation theorem">
<text>In mathematics, the Weierstrass preparation theorem is a tool for dealing with analytic functions of several complex variables, at a given point &quot;P&quot;. It states that such a function is, up to multiplication by a function not zero at &quot;P&quot;, a polynomial in one fixed variable &quot;z&quot;, which is monic, and whose coefficients of lower degree terms are analytic functions in the remaining variables and zero at &quot;P&quot;.

There are also a number of variants of the theorem, that extend the idea of factorization in some ring &quot;R&quot; as &quot;u&quot;·&quot;w&quot;, where &quot;u&quot; is a unit and &quot;w&quot; is some sort of distinguished Weierstrass polynomial. Carl Siegel has disputed the attribution of the theorem to Weierstrass, saying that it occurred under the current name in some of late nineteenth century &quot;Traités d&#x27;analyse&quot; without justification.

==Complex analytic functions==
For one variable, the local form of an analytic function &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) near 0 is &quot;z&quot;&quot;k&quot;&quot;h&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) where &quot;h&quot;(0) is not 0, and &quot;k&quot; is the order of the zero of &quot;f&quot; at 0. This is the result that the preparation theorem generalises. 
We pick out one variable &quot;z&quot;, which we may assume is first, and write our complex variables as (&quot;z&quot;, &quot;z&quot;2, ..., &quot;zn&quot;). A Weierstrass polynomial &quot;W&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is

:&quot;zk&quot; + &quot;g&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1&quot;z&quot;&quot;k&quot;−1 + ... + &quot;g&quot;0

where &quot;g&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;z&quot;2, ..., &quot;zn&quot;) is analytic and &quot;g&quot;&quot;i&quot;(0, ..., 0) = 0.

Then the theorem states that for analytic functions &quot;f&quot;, if

:&quot;f&quot;(0, ...,0) = 0,

and

:&quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;, &quot;z&quot;2, ..., &quot;zn&quot;)

as a power series has some term only involving &quot;z&quot;, we can write (locally near (0, ..., 0))

:&quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;, &quot;z&quot;2, ..., &quot;zn&quot;) = &quot;W&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)&quot;h&quot;(&quot;z&quot;, &quot;z&quot;2, ..., &quot;zn&quot;)

with &quot;h&quot; analytic and &quot;h&quot;(0, ..., 0) not 0, and &quot;W &quot;a Weierstrass polynomial.

This has the immediate consequence that the set of zeros of &quot;f&quot;, near (0, ..., 0), can be found by fixing any small values of &quot;z&quot;2, ..., &quot;zn&quot; and then solving the equation &quot;W(z)=0&quot;. The corresponding values of &quot;z&quot; form a number of continuously-varying &quot;branches&quot;, in number equal to the degree of &quot;W&quot; in &quot;z&quot;. In particular &quot;f&quot; cannot have an isolated zero.

===Division theorem===
A related result is the Weierstrass division theorem, which states that if &quot;f&quot; and &quot;g&quot; are analytic functions, and &quot;g&quot; is a Weierstrass polynomial of degree &quot;N&quot;, then there exists a unique pair &quot;h&quot; and &quot;j&quot; such that &quot;f&quot; = &quot;gh&quot; + &quot;j&quot;, where &quot;j&quot; is a polynomial of degree less than &quot;N&quot;. In fact, many authors prove the Weierstrass preparation as a corollary of the division theorem. It is also possible to prove the division theorem from the preparation theorem so that the two theorems are actually equivalent.

===Applications===
The Weierstrass preparation theorem can be used to show that the ring of germs of analytic functions in &quot;n&quot; variables is a Noetherian ring, which is also referred to as the &quot;Rückert basis theorem&quot;.

==Smooth functions==
There is a deeper preparation theorem for smooth functions, due to Bernard Malgrange, called the Malgrange preparation theorem. It also has an associated division theorem, named after John Mather.

==Formal power series in complete local rings==

There is an analogous result, also referred to as the Weierstrass preparation theorem, for the ring of formal power series over complete local rings &quot;A&quot;: for any power series formula_1 such that not all formula_2 are in the maximal ideal formula_3 of &quot;A&quot;, there is a unique unit &quot;u&quot; in formula_4 and a polynomial &quot;F&quot; of the form formula_5 with formula_6 (a so-called distinguished polynomial) such that
:formula_7
Since formula_4 is again a complete local ring, the result can be iterated and therefore gives similar factorization results for formal power series in several variables.

For example, this applies to the ring of integers in a p-adic field. In this case the theorem says that a power series &quot;f&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) can always be uniquely factored as π&quot;n&quot;·&quot;u&quot;(&quot;z&quot;)·&quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;), where &quot;u&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is a unit in the ring of power series, &quot;p&quot;(&quot;z&quot;) is a distinguished polynomial (monic, with the coefficients of the non-leading terms each in the maximal ideal), and π is a fixed uniformizer.

An application of the Weierstrass preparation and division theorem for the ring formula_9 (also called Iwasawa algebra) occurs in Iwasawa theory in the description of finitely generated modules over this ring.

There exists a non-commutative version of Weierstrass division and preparation, with &quot;A&quot; being a not necessarily commutative ring, and with formal skew power series in place of formal power series.

==Tate algebras==

There is also a Weierstrass preparation theorem for Tate algebras
:formula_10
over a complete non-archimedean field &quot;k&quot;. 
These algebras are the basic building blocks of rigid geometry. One application of this form of the Weierstrass preparation theorem is the fact that the rings formula_11 are Noetherian.

<text>The Pigeon River forms part of the Canada–United States border between the state of Minnesota and the province of Ontario, west of Lake Superior. In pre-industrial times, the river was a waterway of great importance for transportation and the fur trade.

==Geography==
The Pigeon River flows in an easterly direction out of the Boundary Waters Canoe Area Wilderness for until it drains into Lake Superior. The Pigeon is one of the larger rivers on Superior&#x27;s North Shore.

===Headwaters===

The Pigeon River originates from a chain of lakes along the US-Canada border, the highest of which, and furthest west, is Mountain Lake. Among the Pigeon&#x27;s tributaries is the Arrow River of Ontario, which rises in South Lake, west of and at a lower elevation than Mountain Lake. South Lake is separated only by a narrow isthmus from North Lake in the Rainy River watershed. This isthmus is a part of the Northern (or Laurentian) Continental divide, and is crossed by the Height of Land Portage. The fur-trading Voyageurs and coureurs des bois crossed this divide and travelled north and west downstream on the Rainy River and Winnipeg River to Lake Winnipeg, and thence to fur-producing areas of the Canadian northwest.

===Lower course===
Below South Fowl Lake, the Pigeon River alternates between navigable waters and cascades or waterfalls. As the river nears Lake Superior, the gradient increases, culminating in a spectacular gorge including two notable waterfalls: High Falls, at the highest waterfall in Minnesota, and Middle Falls. This gorge is included within both Grand Portage State Park in Cook County, Minnesota, and Pigeon River Provincial Park (9.49 km2) across the border in Thunder Bay District, Ontario. Its lower course also forms the northern boundary of the Grand Portage Indian Reservation.

A portage, known as &quot;Grand Portage&quot; and used for hundreds of years by canoe travelers, bypasses these lower waterfalls and reaches Lake Superior a few miles from the mouth of the river. This historic area is protected as a part of the Grand Portage National Monument.

==History==
Up to the 19th century, the river was a primary water route for fur traders, and even earlier, for Native Americans, leading to the Lake of the Woods and thence to western Canada and Hudson Bay. The Montreal-based North West Company had a post at the community of Grand Portage on the shore of Lake Superior until 1801 when difficulties with the U.S. government following the adoption of the Jay Treaty obliged it to relocate to the Kaministiquia River in British territory.

The region was extensively logged for white and red pine in the early part of the 20th century. An &quot;outlaw&quot; bridge across the river was built by residents of Thunder Bay, Ontario, and opened on August 18, 1917, to permit access to Minnesota. The Canadian road leading to the customs and immigration facilities at the bridge was initially known as the &quot;Scott Highway&quot; after lumberman William Scott, and was designated as King&#x27;s Highway 61 in 1937. Later the Pigeon River Bridge was built downstream and the &quot;outlaw bridge&quot; was removed.

The river&#x27;s English name is a translation of the 18th century French name &quot;Rivière aux Tourtres&quot; or &quot;Tourtes&quot; derived after the passenger pigeon which was once prolific in this region.

<text>Carnie Wilson (born April 29, 1968) is an American singer, songwriter, and television personality. She is the daughter of Brian Wilson and in 1989 co-founded the pop music trio Wilson Phillips with her younger sister Wendy. From 1995 onwards, she has also been a host or guest star on a variety of television shows.

==Early life and musical career==
Carnie Wilson was born in Los Angeles on April 29, 1968, the daughter of Brian Wilson of The Beach Boys and of his first wife, former singer Marilyn Rovell of The Honeys. Her mother is of Jewish heritage, while her father is of Dutch, Scottish, English, German, Irish, and Swedish ancestry.

She co-founded Wilson Phillips with her younger sister Wendy and childhood friend Chynna Phillips in 1989. They released two albums, &quot;Wilson Phillips&quot; and &quot;Shadows and Light&quot;, which between them sold twelve million copies. The group also charted three No. 1 singles and six top 20 hits in the United States before disbanding in 1993.

Carnie &amp; Wendy Wilson continued to record together, releasing the Christmas album &quot;Hey Santa!&quot; in 1993. They joined with their father for the 1997 album &quot;The Wilsons&quot;. Carnie also sang &quot;Our Time Has Come&quot; with James Ingram for the 1997 animated film &quot;Cats Don&#x27;t Dance&quot;.

In 2003, Carnie attempted to launch a solo music career with the album &quot;For the First Time&quot;. The record featured a remake of the Olivia DiNucci-penned Samantha Mumba ballad &quot;Don&#x27;t Need You To (Tell Me I&#x27;m Pretty)&quot;, retitled &quot;I Don&#x27;t Need You To&quot;, as its first single. However, the single failed to gain interest and the album was ultimately shelved when Carnie regrouped with Wendy and Chynna as Wilson Phillips in 2004.

Reunited, the band released a third album, named &quot;California&quot;, which appeared on Sony Music&#x27;s record label. The album featured cover songs, primarily from the 1960s and 1970s, and specifically highlighted the glory days of their parents&#x27; California-based musical groups: The Mamas &amp; the Papas and the Beach Boys.

In 2006, Carnie released an album of lullabies, &quot;A Mother&#x27;s Gift: Lullabies from the Heart&quot;, created shortly after the birth of her daughter, Lola. She released her second solo effort in October 2007, a Christmas album entitled &quot;Christmas with Carnie&quot;, featuring a song written by her husband, &quot;Warm Lovin&#x27; Christmastime&quot;.

==Television career==
From 1995 to 1996, Carnie hosted her own short-lived syndicated television talk show, &quot;Carnie!&quot; The series was launched during the mid-1990s wave of popularity in &quot;tabloid&quot; talk shows, which followed the sudden successes of Ricki Lake and Jerry Springer. Former &quot; Cosmopolitan&quot; magazine&#x27;s Bachelor-of-the-Month Chris Greeley was a guest on the television pilot. Wilson found the experience a disappointment and a source of professional and personal frustration.

She later guest-starred on episodes of &quot;That 70s Show&quot; in 2001 and &quot;Sabrina the Teenage Witch&quot;, before joining the fourth season of VH1&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Fit Club&quot; in 2006.

Wilson has also been a correspondent on &quot;Entertainment Tonight&quot; and in 2006 hosted a special on E! titled &quot;101 Celebrity Slimdowns&quot;. She became a cast member of the CMT series &quot;Gone Country&quot; in January 2008. In April 2008, she was a cast member of the VH1 series &quot;Celebracadabra&quot;. In July 2008, she starred in a show called &quot;Outsider&#x27;s Inn&quot;.

She hosted GSN&#x27;s new edition of &quot;The Newlywed Game&quot;, which premiered April 6, 2009, until late 2010, when she was replaced by Sherri Shepherd.

In addition, a reality show starring Wilson, &quot;Carnie Wilson: Unstapled&quot;, began airing on the Game Show Network on January 14, 2010. In August 2011, Wilson became a judge on the ABC show &quot;Karaoke Battle USA&quot;.

On January 2, 2012, she appeared on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Celebrity Wife Swap&quot;, trading places with actress Tracey Gold for a week.

In the spring of 2012, Carnie along with her sister Wendy and childhood friend Chynna Phillips starred in their own reality show on the TV Guide Network about the rebirth of their band, Wilson Phillips. The show, called &quot;Wilson Phillips: Still Holding On&quot;, logged the journey of the trio getting back together to reform Wilson Phillips on the road, in the studio, and at home as working mothers. A pilot episode aired in November 2011. Seven additional episodes aired in April and May 2012.

Wilson starred in the &quot;Chopped&quot; &quot;All Stars: Celebrities&quot; episode and got to second place.

In 2013, Carnie became a member of &quot;Team Rachael&quot; on the second season of the Food Network&#x27;s &quot;Rachael vs. Guy: Celebrity Cook-Off&quot;. She came in second to Dean McDermott and won $10,000 for her charity, an autism research foundation.

She also frequently fills in as a guest host on CBS&#x27;s &quot;The Talk&quot;.

In 2015, she played herself as an auto insurance claimant on a Progressive Insurance TV commercial. On January 28, 2016, it was announced that she is going to be a contestant on &quot;The New Celebrity Apprentice&quot; (also known as &quot;The Apprentice 15&quot; and &quot;Celebrity Apprentice&quot; 8). On January 2, 2017, Wilson was the second contestant fired, finishing in fifteenth place, earning no money for her charity, &quot;The Weight Loss Surgery Foundation of America&quot;.

In July 2016, Wilson Phillips reunited and performed on ABC&#x27;s &quot;Greatest Hits&quot;.

In February 2017, Wilson made a guest appearance on the reality show &quot;The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills&quot;.

==Personal life==
===Marriage &amp; family===
Wilson married musician and producer Robert Bonfiglio in 2000. They have daughters born in 2005 and 2009.

Her uncles were Dennis Wilson and Carl Wilson. She is a cousin to Beach Boys co-founder Mike Love and his brother, former NBA player Stan Love, as well as Stan&#x27;s son, Miami Heat player Kevin Love.

===Bell&#x27;s palsy diagnosis===
On March 18, 2013, Wilson disclosed, through Twitter, that she had been diagnosed with Bell&#x27;s palsy.

===Love Bites by Carnie===
On August 26, 2017, Carnie and her business partner, childhood friend Tiffany Miller, opened Love Bites by Carnie, a commercial production bakery in Sherwood, Oregon, a suburb of Portland. Love Bites by Carnie makes gourmet, bite-sized cookies.

<doc id="372214" wikidata="Q7392033" url="?curid=372214" title="Timeline of SOE French Section">
<text>The SOE F Section timeline lists the significant events in the history of Section F of the Special Operations Executive. The Special Operations Executive (SOE) was a clandestine organization of the United Kingdom during World War II. The purpose of SOE was to conduct espionage, sabotage, and reconnaissance in countries occupied by the Axis powers. SOE agents allied themselves with resistance groups and supplied them with weapons and equipment parachuted in from England. Section F was responsible for many of SOE&#x27;s activities in France which was occupied by Nazi Germany.

SOE F Section sent about 470 agents to France from 1941 to 1944, of whom about 40 were women. The Valençay SOE Memorial lists 91 men and 13 women agents who were killed, executed, or died in concentration camps during the war. SOE agents in France were organized into networks which usually consisted of an organiser (the leader), a courier, and a wireless operator. Arrivals of agents in France was by parachute, clandestine air flight, or, in a few cases, by ship or boat. Dates of arrivals and departures below reflect that most operations took place about midnight. Supplies and weapons were air-dropped. A task of agents was identifying suitable landing sites, usually farm fields, for parachuters, supplies, and aircraft 

SOE had two sections dealing with France. SOE F Section is the subject of this article. SOE RF Section was controlled by Charles de Gaulle and his supporters. It was similar in size to F Section. The two sections were operationally independent although sharing logistics and transportation. 
==1940==
:19 June
::British Prime Minister Winston Churchill wrote a memorandum proposing to create an organization &quot;to coordinate all action by way of subversion and sabotage against the enemy overseas. The army of Nazi Germany was in the process of occupying many countries of Europe, including France which would initially be divided into the Occupied Zone and the unoccupied or &quot;Free Zone.&quot; (Vichy France)

:22 July
::The Special Operations Executive was created with Hugh Dalton, the Minister of Economic Warfare, appointed at its head. Dalton said that Churchill told him to &quot;set Europe ablaze.&quot;

==1941==
===April 1941===
:April
::Vera Atkins joined SOE and was appointed the intelligence officer for Section F. Romanian born, she became &quot;the most powerful personality in SOE.&quot;

===May 1941===
:May 
::Giliana Balmaceda was the first female SOE agent to be sent to occupied France. A citizen of Chile, she traveled legally to Vichy France and collected documents such as ration and identification cards that could be forged by the SOE for its undercover agents in France.
:5 May
::Wireless operator Georges Bégué was the first male SOE F section agent in France and the first to arrive by parachute. He landed in Indre Department. Headquartered in Châteauroux, he set up radio communications and met agents who followed him.

===June 1941===
:13 June
::The first airdrop of weapons to the French Resistance took place, arranged by Georges Bégue and Pierre de Vomécourt. Two CLE Canisters were parachuted onto the estate of Philippe de Vomécourt near Limoges. The Vomécourt brothers created the first two SOE networks (or reseau) in France, named Autogiro and Ventriloquist.

===August 1941===
:6/7 August
::SOE agents Jacques Vaillant de Guélis and G.C.G Turck parachuted into France. Turck was injured and captured on landing; de Guélis spent a month in France recruiting agents, collecting documents, and preparing the way for the arrival of Virginia Hall. 

:23 August
::American Virginia Hall departed England for Vichy France as a SOE agent. Her cover was as a correspondent for the &quot;New York Post&quot;. The United States was not yet at war with Germany and Americans could travel to and from France. Hall was the first female SOE agent to live and work in France for an extended period of time.

===September 1941===
:September
::Maurice Buckmaster was appointed the leader of SOE F Section. At this time the SOE headquarters staff of Section F consisted of eight people which would be increased to 24 during the next year and many more thereafter. Nicolas Bodington became Buckmaster&#x27;s deputy.

:4/5 September
::The first clandestine landing of a Westland Lysander airplane in support of SOE F Section took place on a farm field in Indre Department. the Lysander dropped off SOE agent Gerald Morel and picked up Jacques Vaillant de Guélis. The Lysander transported agents and reports back and forth from England to France and vice versa. 


:6/7 September
::SOE agents Benjamin Cowburn, Michael Trotobas, Victor Gerson, George Langelaan, Jean du Puy, and André Bloch parachuted into France at night near Châteauroux. They were met by Bégué, Max Hymans, and a local farmer, Octave Chanteraine. Cowburn, Trotobas, and Gerson would become important SOE agents.

:19/20 September
::SOE agent Francis Basin arrived in France by clandestine boat and set up operations in Cannes on the French Riviera. He came into contact with an organization called Carte headed by an artist named André Girard who claimed to have organized a large group of resisters to German control. Basin&#x27;s reports on Carte gave SOE hope that it could be used as the spearhead of a large resistance movement to the Germans.

===October 1941===
:20 October
::In what was called the &quot;mousetrap,&quot; Vichy Police learned of a Marseilles safehouse called the Villa des Bois and arrested about 10 SOE agents who visited the Villa.

:24 October
::As part of the &quot;mousetrap,&quot; Georges Bégué was arrested in Marseilles and in an unrelated action, a routine document check, Michael Trotabas was arrested in Chateauroux. The arrests left Virginia Hall in Lyon as nearly the only SOE agent remaining at large in Vichy France and she had no wireless operator for communication with SOE headquarters.

===November 1941===
:17 November
::In Paris Nazi spy catcher Sergeant Hugo Bleicher led German police in arresting members of a Franco-Polish resistance group, Interallié. Among those arrested was Mathilde Carré, nicknamed &quot;the Cat.&quot; In exchange for money and freedom, Carré agreed to work for Bleicher and helped him arrest additional members of the group. Interallié was destroyed.

===December 1941===
:26 December
::His wireless operator having been arrested, Pierre de Vomécourt had no means of communicating with SOE headquarters in London. In Paris he was introduced to Mathilde Carré who, unknown to him, had become a double agent, working for the Germans. She told him she had access to a wireless. The wireless was controlled by the Germans and they began transmitting, receiving, and reading Vomécourt&#x27;s messages.

==1942==
===January 1942===
:9/10 January
::Peter Churchill landed by submarine at Miramar on the French Riviera, to evaluate the Carte network. Carte&#x27;s leader, André Girard, claimed that his organization could, with SOE help, undertake sabotage and guerilla warfare and eventually field an army of 300,000 men to resist German control of France. Assistance to Carte became F Section&#x27;s top priority in 1942.

===February 1942===
:11 February
::Wireless operator Andre Bloch was executed by the Germans at Mont-Valérien, the first SOE agent in France to be executed. Pierre de Vomécourt said that it was obvious that Bloch was Jewish and sending him as an agent to France showed the ignorance of SOE about wartime life in France.

:26/27 February
::Pierre de Vomécourt and Mathilde Carré departed France by Royal Navy motor torpedo boat to return to England. De Vomécourt had realized she was a German agent and persuaded her to go to England with him. She gained the approval of her German handlers for the trip, because she would learn much about SOE and report to them upon her return to France. Instead, Carré was imprisoned in England for the remainder of the war.

===April 1942===
:25 April
::Pierre de Vomécourt was arrested by Hugo Bleicher in Paris. He had been parachuted back into France on 1 April. Vomécourt persuaded the Germans to treat him and his followers as prisoners of war, rather than spies, and he spent the rest of the war imprisoned in Colditz Castle. His arrest, and the destruction of his Autogiro network, left SOE without any working networks in France, although Virginia Hall remained active in Lyon.

===July 1942===
:1/2 July
::English painter Brian Stonehouse, a wireless operator, parachuted into occupied France near the city of Tours, Indre-et-Loire, in the Loire Valley. Stonehouse was captured in October 1942 along with courier Blanche Charlet, and spent the rest of the war in German prisons, including Natzweiler-Struthof concentration camp. Charlet later escaped and was evacuated to England.

:15 July
::Eleven SOE agents, including Michael Trotobas and Georges Bégué, escaped from a French prison in the Dordogne region. They made their way to Lyon where Virginia Hall helped them cross the border into Spain and return to England.

:29/30 July
::SOE F Section&#x27;s second on command, Nicolas Bodington, landed on the French Riviera via clandestine boat. Landed with him was Carte&#x27;s second-in-command, Henri Frager and courier Yvonne Rudellat. Bodington&#x27;s task was to assess the viability of Carte as a resistance organization and the assistance needed from SOE. Ruddelat would become involved with the Prosper network as a courier and saboteur.

::Claude de Baissac parachuted with Harry Peulevé near Nimes. Dropped from too low an altitude, Peulevé broke his leg. Despite a sprained ankle, de Baissac continued with his mission to set up the Scientist Network and to conduct espionage at Bordeaux. After a partial recovery, Puelevé, still limping, walked across the Pyrenees to Spain and returned to England in November.

===August 1942===
:27/28 August
::John Starr arrived by parachute in a field near Valence, Drôme, in Vichy France on his first mission. Peter Churchill arrived by parachute near Montpellier on his third mission. His job was to liaison with Carte and his network was called Spindle. Both were highly regarded agents.

===September 1942===
:12 September
::Nicolas Bodington returned to England from the French Riviera and presented a favorable report on the Carte network and its potential as a resistance organization. SOE began to plan to provide substantial assistance in money, arms, and supplies to Carte.

:17/18 September
::Michael Trotobas parachuted back into France, landing near Montargis. Trotobas went to Lille where he organized the Farmer network and led many sabotage missions.

:25 September
::Andrée Borrel and Lise de Baissac arrived in German-occupied France by parachute early in the morning of 25 September at a field near Mer, Loir-et-Cher (a parachute jump the previous night was aborted due to the signals in the drop zone being incorrect), after having left England late on the night of 24 September in a RAF Whitley. They were the first SOE female agents to be parachuted into France. Borrel went to Paris to become a key figure in the Prosper network. De Baissac went to Poitiers where, working mostly by herself, she supported several agents and networks.

===October 1942===
:1/2 October
::Francis Suttill arrived by parachute near Vendôme and proceeded to Paris to establish the Prosper (also called Physician) network. Suttill was highly regarded by SOE. Prosper was to replace the now defunct Autogiro network as the most important SOE network in northern France. Andrée Borrel was Suttill&#x27;s courier and his wireless operator was Gilbert Norman.

===November 1942===

:November
::Poor security doomed the Carte network. Traveling by train to Paris, André Marsac&#x27;s briefcase was stolen by a German agent. The briefcase contained the names and personal information about more than 200 Carte supporters. The Germans continued to observe Carte, but did not take immediate action to arrest those on the list.

:3/4 November
::George Starr and Odette Sansom arrived clandestinely by boat at night near Cannes, Alpes-Maritimes, on the Mediterranean coast of France. The return voyage carried John Starr out of France following his first mission, taking with him reports collected by Peter Churchill. George Starr would establish a network in southwestern France and Sansom would become Churchill&#x27;s courier.

:8 November
::Allied forces invaded French colonies in North Africa and in consequence the Germans and Italians invaded and occupied previously un-occupied Vichy France. The German occupation made life for SOE agents in former Vichy France much more dangerous. However, most of Prosper&#x27;s operations were in northern, occupied France.

:13 November
::Phillipe de Vomécourt was arrested by French police near Limoges and sentenced to 10 years in prison.

===December 1942===
:7/12 December
::Claude de Baissac organized the Scientist network in Bordeaux with the all-important priority of gathering intelligence and carrying out sabotage against the submarine base there. De Baissac&#x27;s planned sabotage was thwarted when British commandos simultaneously (without coordination within the British government) carried out Operation Frankton against the submarine base. Frankton was only partially successful, German security increased afterwards and sabotage by de Baissac became infeasible.

:29/30 December
::Jack Agazarian parachuted into France to join the Prosper Network as a second wireless operator. He was later joined by his wife Francine, a courier. They were one of only a few married couples working for SOE, but, although they both worked for Prosper, they had different jobs.

==1943==
===January 1943===
: 2 January
::The Carte network was riven by internal controversy and finally split into factions headed by André Girard and Henri Frager. Peter Churchill, who was the liaison of Carte with SOE, favored Frager. 

:22 January
::Henri Déricourt, a pilot, parachuted into France and went to Paris to work as the air movements officer for the Prosper and other networks. Based in Paris, Déricourt organized Lysander landings at clandestine air fields. Prior to World War II, Déricourt was friends with Nicolas Bodington who became SOE&#x27;s Deputy Director and Karl Boemelburg who became the German Sicherheitsdienst (the SD, the SS security service) director in Paris.

===March 1943===

:23/24 March
::Peter Churchill and Henri Frager of Carte returned to England for consultations with SOE by Lysander flight from near Compiègne. On the inward flight Francis Cammaerts arrived to take Churchill&#x27;s place and was driven to Paris.

:25 March
::The German destruction of Carte commenced with the arrest of André Marsac in Paris which was followed by additional arrests. Francis Cammaerts, recently arrived, was appalled at the loose security of Carte and departed Paris for Annecy.

===April 1943===
:16 April
::One day after Peter Churchill returned to France, he and his courier, Odette Sansom, were arrested by Hugo Bleicher in Saint-Jorioz near Annecy. Bleicher learned their location from arrested Carte members André Marsac and Roger Bardet. The Carte network in which SOE had invested so much hope was destroyed. The Prosper network of Francis Suttill became SOE&#x27;s principal effort to foster resistance to the German occupation. Prosper was based in Paris. Churchill and Sansom would both survive the war in concentration camps.

:18 April
::With contacts from the ruins of the Interallié, Autogiro and Carte networks, Prosper had grown rapidly and its writ now extended &quot;from the Ardennes to the Atlantic.&quot; However, in a first sign of worry, Prosper leader Francis Suttill sent a report to SOE saying that he distrusted former Carte official Henri Frager, now associated with Prosper.

:22 April
::The destruction of the Prosper network began with the arrest by the German SD of sisters Germaine and Madeleine Tambour in Paris. Both had been associated with Carte and also with Prosper. Francis Suttill attempted unsuccessfully to bribe the Germans for their release. Both were later executed. The sisters&#x27; apartment was a safe house and a letter box to pass along messages for SOE agents. A few days before the arrest, Benjamin Cowburn had commented to Suttill that too many people were going in and out of the apartment.

===May 1943===
:20/21 May
::Francis Suttill returned to France after a week of consultations with SOE in London. He informed SOE that he believed the Germans had infiltrated the Prosper network because of the large number of arrests taking place. His mood was described as &quot;jaded,&quot; a &quot;show of nerves,&quot; and antagonistic about what he considered the failings of SOE headquarters.

===June 1943===
:15/16 June
::Noor Inayat Khan, Diana Rowden, and Cecily Lefort arrived by air at a location north-east of Angers, Maine-et-Loire, in the Loire Valley, where they were met by Henri Déricourt. Inayat Khan would work with the Prosper network in Paris. Jack Agazarian left on the return flight to England. Agazarian had been accused by Suttill of being careless.

:15/16 June
::Canadian SOE agents Frank Pickersgill and John Kenneth Macalister had parachuted into France a few days earlier. They were met by Yvonne Rudelatt and Pierra Culioli, who were to drive them to Paris, but the two Canadians were taken into custody by the Germans in Dhuizon. After a car chase Rudelatt and Culioli were wounded and captured.

:23 June
::Andrée Borrel and Gilbert Norman, two of the three central figures of the Prosper network, were arrested by the Germans in Paris. Later that same day their leader Francis Suttill was arrested in a small hotel in Paris. Only Borrel and Norman were likely to have known his location.

::In London temporarily, Jack Agazarian told SOE that Suttill believed the security of Henri Déricourt&#x27;s air movements operation was poor. This was apparently the first of many reports by SOE agents expressing concern about Déricourt. Some called him a &quot;traitor&quot; although it was unclear to SOE in London whether that charge pertained to Déricourt (code named &quot;Gilbert&quot;) or Suttill&#x27;s wireless operator, Gilbert Norman.

===July 1943===
:7 July
::A wireless message ostensibly from Gilbert Norman in Paris confirmed that Suttill had been arrested. However, the message did not contain a security check inserted into all messages by operators to confirm their identity and that they were not broadcasting under duress. Rather than question the provenance of the message, SOE commander Buckmaster replied, &quot;You have forgotten your security check. Be more careful.&quot; The message had in fact been sent to SOE by the Germans.

<text>Grand Theft Parsons is a 2003 comedy-drama film based on the true story of country rock musician Gram Parsons (played by Gabriel Macht), who died of an overdose in 1973. Parsons and his road manager, Phil Kaufman (Johnny Knoxville), made a pact in life that whoever died first would be cremated by the other in what was then the Joshua Tree National Monument, an area of desert they both loved and cherished.

==Plot==
The death of singer Gram Parsons prompts Phil Kaufman to fulfill his promise and a black comedy unwinds, with Kaufman bribing mortuary personnel, renting a psychedelic hearse from Larry Oster-Berg, and trekking across the southern California desert, pursued all the while by Parsons&#x27; ex-girlfriend with Kaufman&#x27;s girlfriend and Parsons’ stepfather.

==Cast==
*Johnny Knoxville as Phil Kaufman
*Christina Applegate as Barbara
*Michael Shannon as Larry Oster-Berg
*Marley Shelton as Susie
*Robert Forster as Stanley Parsons
*Gabriel Macht as Gram Parsons
*Phil Kaufman as Handcuffed Felon

==Reception==
&quot;Grand Theft Parsons&quot; was shown in the &quot;Park City at Midnight&quot; section at the 2004 Sundance Film Festival.

On review aggregator Rotten Tomatoes, 46% of 28 critics gave the film a positive review, with an average rating of 5.4/10, earning it a &quot;Rotten&quot; score. The website&#x27;s critics consensus reads, &quot;&quot;Grand Theft Parsons&quot; pays tribute to a rock legend without following biopic formula -- and proves that a unique perspective doesn&#x27;t always mean a worthwhile film.&quot; On Metacritic, the film holds a weighted average score of 46 out of 100, based on 11 critics, indicating &quot;mixed or average reviews&quot;.

In his review for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, A. O. Scott wrote, &quot;Parsons himself might have written a surreal, funny-sad ballad about the aftermath of his own death, but &quot;Grand Theft Parsons&quot; is little more than a surreal anecdote, told in too much detail and without enough soul or imagination to make anything more than a footnote to a legend&quot;. Kimberley Jones, in her review for the &quot;Austin Chronicle&quot;, wrote, &quot;Black comedy can be a beautiful thing, but &quot;Grand Theft Parsons&quot; consistently misses that mark for a more bottom-feeding tasteless and broad, with the occasional ham-handed, soulless stab at sober reflection&quot;. In his review for the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Kevin Crust found Johnny Knoxville &quot;surprisingly good&quot; but felt that the script left &quot;a lot to be desired, strewn with dialogue as flat and stale as old beer and some invented characters who make the events depicted seem more silly than anarchic&quot;.

However, in his review for the &quot;Sunday Times&quot;, Bryan Appleyard wrote, &quot;&quot;Grand Theft Parsons&quot; is a delight, a comic tragedy that, though it does not say much about Parsons&#x27;s art, says a great deal about the context in which it emerged&quot;. &quot;Time Out London&quot; found that the film &quot;hit on a pleasing vein of deadpan stoner humour, especially in the character of a hearse-driving hippie who comes along for the ride&quot; and &quot;could easily become a cult favourite&quot;. The &quot;Daily Mirror&quot; wrote, &quot;It&#x27;s a mark of this movie&#x27;s tremendous charm that, as the flames rise towards the sky, the ending seems gloriously happy&quot;.

<text>Carl Rakosi (November 6, 1903 – June 25, 2004) was the last surviving member of the Objectivist poets, still publishing and performing poetry well into his 90s.

==Early life==
Rakosi was born in Berlin and lived there and in Hungary until 1910, when he moved to the United States to live with his father and stepmother. His father was a jeweler and watchmaker in Chicago and later in Gary, Indiana. The family lived in semi-poverty but contrived to send him to the University of Chicago and then to the University of Wisconsin–Madison. During his time studying at the university level, he started writing poetry. On graduating, he worked for a time as a social worker, then returned to college to study psychology. At this time, he changed his name to Callman Rawley because he felt he stood a better chance of being employed if he had a more American-sounding name. After a spell as a psychologist and teacher, he returned to social work for the rest of his working life.

==Early writings==
At the University of Wisconsin–Madison, Rakosi edited the &quot;Wisconsin Literary Magazine&quot;. His own poetry at this stage was influenced by W. B. Yeats, Wallace Stevens, and E. E. Cummings. He also started reading William Carlos Williams and T. S. Eliot. By 1925, he was publishing poems in &quot;The Little Review&quot; and &quot;Nation&quot;.

==Pound and the Objectivists==
By the late 1920s, Rakosi was in correspondence with Ezra Pound, who prompted Louis Zukofsky to contact him. This led to Rakosi&#x27;s inclusion in the Objectivists issue of &quot;Poetry&quot; and in the &quot;An &quot;Objectivists&quot; Anthology&quot;. Rakosi himself had reservations about the Objectivist tag, feeling that the poets involved were too different from each other to form a group in any meaningful sense of the word. He especially admired the work of Charles Reznikoff.

==Later career==
Like his fellow Objectivist George Oppen, Rakosi abandoned poetry after the publication in 1941 of his &quot;Selected Poems&quot;. He dedicated himself to social work and apparently neither read nor wrote poetry. Years earlier, shortly after his twenty-first birthday, Rakosi had legally changed his name to Callman Rawley, believing that he would not find work with his foreign-sounding name. Under his adopted name, he served as head of the Minneapolis Jewish Children&#x27;s and Family Service from 1945 until his retirement in 1968. A letter from the English poet Andrew Crozier about his early poetry was the trigger that started Rakosi writing again. His first book in 26 years, &quot;Amulet&quot;, was published by New Directions in 1967, although it consisted mostly of versions of his earlier poems. His &quot;Collected Poems&quot; was published in 1986 by the National Poetry Foundation, which was followed by several more volumes and by readings across the United States and Europe.

In early November 2003, Rakosi celebrated his 100th birthday with friends at the San Francisco Public Library. Upon his death Jacket Magazine editor John Tranter observed the following:

<doc id="372230" wikidata="Q453611" url="?curid=372230" title="Dennis Wilson">
<text>Dennis Carl Wilson (December 4, 1944 – December 28, 1983) was an American musician who co-founded the Beach Boys. He was their drummer and the middle brother of bandmates Brian and Carl Wilson. Dennis was the only true surfer in the Beach Boys, and his personal life exemplified the &quot;California myth&quot; that the band&#x27;s early songs often celebrated. He was also known for his musical association with the Manson Family and for co-starring in the 1971 film &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop.&quot;

He also served mainly on drums and baritone backing vocals for the Beach Boys. His playing can be heard on many of the group&#x27;s hits, belying the popular misconception that he was always replaced on record by studio musicians. He originally had few lead vocals on the band&#x27;s songs due to his limited baritone range, but his prominence as a singer-songwriter increased following their 1968 album &quot;Friends.&quot; His music is characterized for reflecting his &quot;edginess&quot; and &quot;little of his happy charm.&quot; His original songs for the group included &quot;Little Bird&quot; (1968), &quot;Forever&quot; (1970) and &quot;Cuddle Up&quot; (1972). Friends and biographers have asserted that he was an uncredited writer on &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot;, a 1974 hit for Joe Cocker frequently performed by Wilson in concert.

During his final years, Wilson struggled with alcoholism and the use of other drugs (including cocaine and heroin), exacerbating longstanding tensions with some of his bandmates. His solo album, &quot;Pacific Ocean Blue&quot; (1977), was released to warm reviews and moderate sales comparable to those of contemporaneous Beach Boys albums. Sessions for a follow-up, &quot;Bambu,&quot; disintegrated before his death from drowning in 1983 at age 39.

In 1988, he was posthumously inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame as a member of the Beach Boys.

==Childhood==
Dennis Carl Wilson was born on December 4, 1944, the second child of Audree Neva (née Korthof) and Murry Gage Wilson. He spent his family years with his brothers Brian and Carl and their parents in Hawthorne, California. Dennis&#x27;s role in the family dynamic, which he himself acknowledged, was that of the black sheep. According to neighborhood friend David Marks, Dennis&#x27;s &quot;raucous behavior&quot; inspired other kids to nickname him &quot;Dennis the Menace&quot;. Out of the three Wilson brothers, Dennis was the most likely to get beaten by their father and suffer the worst treatment. In 1976, he acknowledged, &quot;We had a shitty childhood ... my dad was a tyrant. He used to wail on us, physically beat the crap out of us. I don&#x27;t know kids who got it like we did.&quot;

Possessed with an abundance of physical energy and a combative nature, Dennis often refused to participate in family singalongs, and likewise avoided vocalizing on the early recordings that Brian made on a portable tape recorder. Dennis later described Brian as a &quot;freak&quot; who would &quot;stay in his room all day listening to records rather than playing baseball. If you could get me to sing a song, yeah, I&#x27;d get into it. But I&#x27;d much rather play doctor with the girl next door or muck around with cars.&quot; However, Dennis would sing with his brothers late at night in their shared bedroom, a song Brian later recalled as &quot;our special one we&#x27;d sing&quot;, titled &quot;Come Down, Come Down from the Ivory Tower&quot;. Brian said of the late night brotherly three-part harmonies, &quot;We developed a little blend which aided us when we started to get into the Beach Boys stuff.&quot;

Dennis noted of himself, &quot;If my dad hadn&#x27;t given me a BB gun when I was nine years old, my life would have been completely different. With that gun I had something I could take my anger out on. Hunting, fishing, racing have been my preoccupations ever since.&quot; Brian told &quot;Melody Maker&quot; in 1966, &quot;Dennis had to keep moving all the time. If you wanted him to sit still for one second, he&#x27;s yelling and screaming and ranting and raving. He&#x27;s the most messed-up person I know.&quot; Around the time he was 14, Dennis began playing piano and learned to play boogie-woogie styles. He remembered attending church gatherings with the rest of his family &quot;because there was this outasight chick there ... [and] I used to try and play boogie woogie on the church piano on Friday nights when all the kids went there to play volleyball.&quot;

==Early career==
===Formation of the Beach Boys===
The Wilsons&#x27; mother, Audree, forced Brian to include Dennis in the original lineup of the Beach Boys. In 1960, Dennis began taking drum lessons at Hawthorne High School. Teacher Fred Morgan later said that Dennis had been &quot;a beater, not a drummer&quot; and &quot;a fast learner when he wanted to learn.&quot; According to Brian, &quot;We kind of developed into a group sort of through the wishes of Dennis. He said that ... the kids at school knew I was musical because I had done some singing for assemblies and so on.&quot; Recalling their first group rehearsals, Dennis said that he was initially &quot;going to play bass, and then I decided to play drums. ... Drums seemed to be more exciting. I could always play bass if I wanted to.&quot; Brian would ultimately play bass. Dennis played the drums on their first studio album &quot;Surfin&#x27; Safari&quot; and sang vocals.

The Beach Boys officially formed in late 1961, with Murry taking over as manager, and had a local hit with their debut record &quot;Surfin&#x27;&quot;, a song that Brian wrote at Dennis&#x27;s urging. Dennis recalled, &quot;We got so excited ... I ran down the street screaming, &#x27;Listen, we&#x27;re on the radio!&#x27; It was really funky. That started it, the minute you&#x27;re on the radio.&quot; Though the Beach Boys developed their image based on the California surfing culture, Dennis was the only actual surfer in the band. Carl supported, &quot;Dennis was the only one who could really surf. We all tried, even Brian, but we were terrible. We just wanted to have a good time and play music.&quot;

In early 1963, Dennis teamed with Brian&#x27;s collaborator Gary Usher. Calling themselves the Four Speeds, they released the single &quot;RPM&quot; backed with &quot;My Stingray&quot;. In March 1964, Dennis moved out of the Wilson family home and took residence at an address in Hollywood. In the sleeve notes of the band&#x27;s July 1964 album &quot;All Summer Long&quot;, Dennis wrote, &quot;They say I live a fast life. Maybe I just like a fast life. I wouldn&#x27;t give it up for anything in the world. It won&#x27;t last forever, either. But the memories will.&quot; In December, Murry told a reporter that Dennis had been &quot;a little too generous&quot; with money and &quot;cried when he learned about how much he had wasted. ... Where the other boys invested or saved their money, Dennis spent $94,000. He spent $25,000 on a home but the rest just went. Dennis [is] like that: he picks up the tab wherever he goes.&quot;

In January 1965, Brian declared to his bandmates that he would no longer tour with the group for the foreseeable future. He later said that Dennis was so devastated by the news that his immediate reaction was to pick up &quot;a big ashtray and told some people to get out of there or he&#x27;d hit them on the head with it. He kind of blew it.&quot; Photographer Ed Roach, a close friend of Dennis, stated that Brian was deterred from the stage due to jealousy over the adulation Dennis received from the audience. Brian remembered that the attention Dennis received was &quot;hard to handle&quot;. The girls would be going &#x27;Dennis, Dennis&#x27; and run right past us to get to him.&quot; Dennis later said of his brother, &quot;Brian Wilson is the Beach Boys. He is the band. We&#x27;re his fucking messengers. He is all of it. Period. We&#x27;re nothing. He&#x27;s everything.&quot;

===Increased record presence===

Brian wrote that he had felt that Dennis &quot;never really had a chance to sing very much&quot;, and so he gave him more leads on their March 1965 album &quot;The Beach Boys Today!&quot;. Dennis sang &quot;Do You Wanna Dance?&quot; and &quot;In the Back of My Mind&quot;. The former became the first song with a Dennis lead that was issued as an A-sided single, peaking at No. 12 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Journalist Peter Doggett later said that Dennis&#x27; performance on the latter song &quot;showed for the first time an awareness that his voice could be a blunt emotional instrument. ... his erratic croon cut straight to the heart, with an urgency that his more precise brothers could never have matched.&quot; Released in July, &quot;Summer Days (And Summer Nights!!)&quot; contained Dennis&#x27;s favorite song by Brian, &quot;Let Him Run Wild&quot;.

By 1966, Dennis had begun using LSD. His drumming contributions on &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; (1966) were limited to the track &quot;That&#x27;s Not Me&quot;. Carl said, &quot;Brian liked to use [session drummer] Hal [Blaine] because he was so much more reliable than Dennis, but whenever Dennis got the chance to play he always did a great job. He played drums on more of our records than most people realize. I think because he didn&#x27;t play on &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; everybody assumes he never played at all, and that&#x27;s just not the case.&quot;

During the &quot;Smile&quot; sessions, Dennis played on &quot;Vega-Tables&quot;, &quot;Holidays&quot;, and &quot;Good Vibrations&quot;. It is rumored that the album&#x27;s working title, &quot;Dumb Angel&quot;, referred to Dennis himself. Van Dyke Parks, the project&#x27;s lyricist, credited Wilson with inspiring the name of the would-be album track &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot;. Dennis said that the group ultimately scrapped &quot;Smile&quot; because they became &quot;very paranoid about the possibility of losing our public. ... Drugs played a great role in our evolution but as a result we were frightened that people would no longer understand us, musically.&quot;

In the latter part of the 1960s, Dennis started writing songs for the Beach Boys. Dennis&#x27;s collaborator Gregg Jakobson commented, &quot;He started taking his piano playing more seriously. He&#x27;d ask Brian to show him stuff until he got a pretty good grasp of chords.&quot; In January 1967, Dennis recorded the original composition &quot;I Don&#x27;t Know&quot;, but it was left unreleased. Music historian Keith Badman states that whether the piece was intended for &quot;Smile&quot; is not definitively known. In December, Wilson recorded a piece called &quot;Tune #1&quot; that was intended for a solo project to be released on Brother Records, but it was also shelved.

Wilson&#x27;s first major released composition was &quot;Little Bird&quot;, issued in April 1968 as the B-side of the &quot;Friends&quot; single. &quot;Little Bird&quot; and another song, &quot;Be Still&quot;, were co-written with poet Stephen Kalinich and featured on the album &quot;Friends&quot; (June 1968). The group&#x27;s next album, &quot;20/20&quot; (February 1969), marked the emergence of Dennis as a producer, including his original songs &quot;Be with Me&quot; and &quot;All I Want to Do&quot;. Dennis&#x27;s &quot;Celebrate the News&quot; was released as the B-side to the standalone single &quot;Break Away&quot;. 

By this time, the Beach Boys&#x27; popularity had faltered considerably. Dennis believed, &quot;Because of the attitude of a few mental dinosaurs intent on exploiting our initial success, Brian&#x27;s huge talent has never been fully appreciated in America and the potential of the group has been stifled. [...] If the Beatles had suffered this kind of misrepresentation, they would have never got past singing &#x27;Please, Please Me&#x27; and &#x27;I Wanna Hold Your Hand&#x27; and leaping around in Beatle suits.&quot;

In 2018, many of Wilson&#x27;s unreleased tracks from this period were released for the compilations &quot;Wake the World: The Friends Sessions&quot; and &quot;I Can Hear Music: The 20/20 Sessions&quot;.

==Manson association==
===Contact with Manson===
On April 6, 1968, Wilson was driving through Malibu when he noticed two female hitchhikers, Patricia Krenwinkel and Ella Jo Bailey. He picked them up and dropped them off at their destination. On April 11, Wilson noticed the same two girls hitchhiking again. This time he took them to his home at 14400 Sunset Boulevard. He recalled that he &quot;told [the girls] about our involvement with the Maharishi and they told me they too had a guru, a guy named Charlie [Manson] who&#x27;d recently come out of jail after 12 years.&quot; Wilson then went to a recording session; when he returned later that night, he was met in his driveway by Charles Manson, and when Wilson walked into his home, about a dozen people were occupying the premises, most of them young women. They were later known as members of the &quot;Manson Family&quot;. By Manson&#x27;s own account, he had met Wilson on at least one prior occasion: at a friend&#x27;s San Francisco house where Manson had gone to obtain marijuana. Manson claimed that Wilson invited him to visit his Sunset Boulevard home when Manson came to Los Angeles.

Wilson was initially fascinated by Manson and his followers, referring to him as &quot;the Wizard&quot; in a &quot;Rave&quot; magazine article at the time. The two struck a friendship, and over the next few months, members of the Manson Family – mostly women who were treated as servants – were housed in Wilson&#x27;s residence, costing him approximately $100,000 (equivalent to $ in ). Much of these expenses went on cars, clothes, food and penicillin injections for their persistent gonorrhoea. This arrangement persisted for about six months. In late 1968, Wilson told the magazine &quot;Record Mirror&quot; that &quot;when I met [Charlie] I found he had great musical ideas. We&#x27;re writing together now. He&#x27;s dumb, in some ways, but I accept his approach and have [learned] from him.&quot; He told reporters that he had been living with 17 women; when asked if he had been supporting them, Wilson replied, &quot;No, if anything, they&#x27;re supporting me. I had all the rich status symbols – Rolls-Royce, Ferrari, home after home. Then I woke up, gave away 50 to 60 percent of my money. Now I live in one small room, with one candle, and I&#x27;m happy, finding myself.&quot;

Wilson introduced Manson to a few friends in the music business, including the Byrds&#x27; producer Terry Melcher. Manson recorded numerous songs at Brian&#x27;s home studio, although the recordings remain unheard by the public. Band engineer Stephen Desper said that the Manson sessions were done &quot;for Dennis [Wilson] and Terry Melcher&quot;.

In September 1968, Wilson recorded a Manson song for the Beach Boys, originally titled &quot;Cease to Exist&quot; but reworked as &quot;Never Learn Not to Love&quot;, as a single B-side released the following December. The writing was credited solely to Wilson. When asked why Manson was not credited, Wilson explained that Manson relinquished his publishing rights in favor of &quot;about a hundred thousand dollars&#x27; worth of stuff&quot;. By another account, Manson was paid cash a BSA motorcycle in exchange for songwriting credit. Around this time, the Family destroyed Wilson&#x27;s Ferrari, as well as his Mercedes-Benz, which had been driven to a mountain outside Spahn Ranch.

===Disassociation===
Growing fearful of the situation, Wilson distanced himself from Manson and moved out of the house, leaving Manson and his followers there, and subsequently took residence with Gregg Jakobson at a basement apartment in Santa Monica. Virtually all of Wilson&#x27;s household possessions were stolen by the Family; the members were evicted from his home three weeks before the lease was scheduled to expire. When Manson subsequently sought further contact, he left a bullet with Wilson&#x27;s housekeeper to be delivered with a threatening message. Commenting on rumors that suggested Wilson had become afraid of Manson, Beach Boys collaborator Van Dyke Parks later said: 

Conversely, band manager Nick Grillo said that Wilson became more concerned after Manson had got &quot;into a much heavier drug situation ... taking a tremendous amount of acid and Dennis wouldn&#x27;t tolerate it and asked him to leave. It was difficult for Dennis because he was afraid of Charlie.&quot; Writing in his 2016 memoir, Mike Love recalled Wilson saying he had witnessed Manson shooting a black man &quot;in half&quot; with an M16 rifle and hiding the body inside a well. Melcher said that Wilson had been aware that the Family &quot;were killing people&quot; and had been &quot;so freaked out he just didn&#x27;t want to live anymore. He was afraid, and he thought he should have gone to the authorities, but he didn&#x27;t, and the rest of it happened.&quot;

===Aftermath===
In August 1969, Manson Family members perpetrated the Tate–LaBianca murders. Shortly afterward, Manson visited Wilson&#x27;s home, telling him that he had &quot;just been to the moon&quot;, and demanded money, which Wilson agreed to give to him. That November, Manson was apprehended and charged with numerous counts of murder and conspiracy to commit murder. Wilson refused to testify against Manson. He explained, &quot;I couldn&#x27;t. I was so scared.&quot; Instead, he was privately interviewed by prosecutor Vincent Bugliosi. Wilson&#x27;s testimony was deemed inessential since Jakobson agreed to publicly testify and corroborate Wilson&#x27;s claims. Melcher later commented that Wilson had not been taken to the stand because the prosecutors &quot;thought he was nuts, and by that time he was. He had a hard time separating reality from fantasy.&quot; Bugliosi said that when he attempted to procure tapes of the songs that Wilson had recorded with Manson, Wilson responded that he had destroyed them because &quot;the vibrations connected with them didn&#x27;t belong on this earth.&quot;

In the subsequent years, Wilson allegedly received death threats from members of the Manson Family, who telephoned his home and told him, &quot;You&#x27;re next&quot;. In 1976, he commented that &quot;I don&#x27;t talk about Manson. I think he&#x27;s a sick fuck. I think of Roman and all those wonderful people who had a beautiful family and they fucking had their tits cut off. I want to benefit from that?&quot; In the 1978 biography &quot;The Beach Boys and the California Myth&quot;, Wilson acknowledged the interest in his relationship with Manson and said, &quot;I know why [he] did what he did. Someday, I&#x27;ll tell the world. I&#x27;ll write a book and explain why he did it.&quot; According to biographer Mark Dillon, &quot;Some attribute [Wilson&#x27;s] subsequent spiral of self-destructive behavior ― particularly his drug intake ― to these fears and feelings of guilt for ever having introduced this evil Wizard into the Hollywood scene.&quot;

Wilson&#x27;s first wife Carole Freedman later told journalist Tom O&#x27;Neill that Wilson and other members of the Hollywood community had closer associations to Manson than what had been reported on the public record. O&#x27;Neill quoted Freedman saying that &quot;It&#x27;s a scary thing, and anyone who knows anything will never talk.&quot; Upon Wilson&#x27;s death, Manson was quoted as saying, &quot;Dennis Wilson was killed by my shadow because he took my music and changed the words from my soul.&quot; Manson never substantiated these claims, but most likely refers to lyrical changes in &quot;Never Learn Not to Love&quot;.

==&quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot;==
From August 13 to late October 1970, Dennis shot his parts for the Universal Pictures road movie &quot;Two-Lane Blacktop&quot;. The film depicts &quot;The Driver&quot; (James Taylor) and &quot;The Mechanic&quot; (Wilson) driving aimlessly across the United States in their 1955 Chevy, surviving on money earned from street racing. It made its worldwide premiere on July 7, 1971, in New York City. The film received mixed reviews but later gained stature as a &quot;cult classic&quot;.

==Solo career==
===Unfinished album===

Dennis continued writing songs for the Beach Boys&#x27; subsequent albums, including &quot;Sunflower&quot; (August 1970), which featured the single &quot;Forever&quot; – commonly regarded as one of his finest songs – and three others: &quot;Slip On Through&quot;, &quot;Got to Know the Woman&quot;, and &quot;It&#x27;s About Time&quot;. Their inclusion was said to be at the insistence of Warner-Reprise, who felt that Dennis&#x27;s songs sounded more contemporary than other rejected Beach Boys tracks. &quot;Slip On Through&quot; became the first of Dennis&#x27;s songs to be issued as an A-sided single by the Beach Boys.

In the early 1970s, Wilson recorded material with Beach Boys touring musician Daryl Dragon to be set aside for a potential solo album, provisionally titled &quot;Freckles&quot;. Dennis also offered &quot;Poops&quot; and &quot;Hubba Hubba&quot; as the album&#x27;s working titles. On December 4, Stateside/EMI released &quot;Sound of Free&quot;, a single issued only in Europe and the UK under the credit &quot;Dennis Wilson &amp; Rumbo&quot;. The B-side was the &quot;Sunflower&quot; outtake &quot;Lady&quot; (also known as &quot;Fallin&#x27; In Love&quot;). At the Beach Boys&#x27; concerts in 1971, Dennis played solo piano renditions of his songs &quot;Barbara&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;. Biographer Jon Stebbins writes, &quot;He was developing a power-ballad style that would become his signature.&quot;

Dennis&#x27;s two song contributions to the Beach Boys&#x27; August 1971 album &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; – &quot;4th of July&quot; and &quot;(Wouldn&#x27;t It Be Nice to) Live Again&quot; – were left off the record. At the time, Dennis stated that he &quot;pulled&quot; the songs off the record because he did not feel they flowed well alongside the other tracks. According to band manager Jack Rieley, the absence of any Dennis songs on &quot;Surf&#x27;s Up&quot; was for two reasons: to quell political infighting within the group concerning the album&#x27;s share of Wilson-brother songs, and because Dennis wanted to save his songs for a solo album.

Engineer Stephen Desper said of Dennis&#x27;s album, &quot;ninety percent of it was ninety percent done&quot;. Fred Vail, the band&#x27;s co-manager, described the album as &quot;diamonds never cut and polished&quot;, and explained, &quot;The Beach Boys obviously weren&#x27;t buying into his songs as part of the group output.&quot; Several tracks from the album – &quot;Baby Baby&quot;, &quot;It&#x27;s a New Day&quot;, &quot;I&#x27;ve Got a Friend&quot;, &quot;Behold the Night&quot;, &quot;Hawaiian Dream&quot;, &quot;Medley: All Of My Love / Ecology&quot;, and &quot;Before&quot; – were released on the 2021 box set &quot;Feel Flows&quot;.

In June 1971, Dennis injured his hand badly enough to prevent him from playing drums for some time, so Ricky Fataar took over as the group&#x27;s drummer between 1972 and 1974. Stebbins writes, &quot;Now, during concerts, the impulsive, physically aggressive Dennis would be reduced to sitting behind a keyboard or standing off to one side behind a microphone. It hurt him deeply. He felt like a caged animal. His drinking became worse and his participation in the band became erratic.&quot; Biographer David Leaf wrote that, by this time, &quot;Dennis was constantly quitting [the band] or getting fired and then rejoining.&quot;

Two more songs intended for Dennis&#x27;s album – &quot;Make it Good&quot; and &quot;Old Movie&quot; (retitled &quot;Cuddle Up&quot;) – were ultimately placed on the Beach Boys&#x27; 1972 release &quot;Carl and the Passions – &quot;So Tough&quot;&quot;. Dennis wrote and produced two songs – &quot;Steamboat&quot; and &quot;Only with You&quot; – on their next album, &quot;Holland&quot; (1973). A third song, &quot;Carry Me Home&quot;, was left off the record. The cover of their 1973 live album, &quot;The Beach Boys in Concert&quot;, depicts only Dennis onstage, although the album itself contains none of his songs.

===&quot;Pacific Ocean Blue&quot;===

Wilson&#x27;s onstage antics (including streaking) occasionally disrupted the Beach Boys&#x27; live shows. He continued recording for his forthcoming solo album at the band&#x27;s Brother Studios facility in Santa Monica. In 1974, concurrent with the success of the greatest hits compilation &quot;Endless Summer,&quot; Dennis returned to his role behind the drums. According to Billy Hinsche, keyboardist for the Beach Boys&#x27; supporting band, it was during this year that Dennis co-wrote the lyrics and modified part of the melody of &quot;You Are So Beautiful&quot; while attending a party with Billy Preston. Hinsche said, &quot;I was there that night, and I would not dispute that Dennis had a hand in writing &#x27;You Are So Beautiful,&#x27; and that&#x27;s the reason we would do it in concert.&quot;

By 1977, Dennis had amassed a stockpile of songs he had written and recorded while factions within the Beach Boys became too stressful for him. He expressed, &quot;If these people want to take this beautiful, happy, spiritual music we&#x27;ve made and all the things we stand for and throw it out the window just because of money, then there&#x27;s something wrong with the whole thing and I don&#x27;t want any part of it.&quot; He then approached James William Guercio, owner of Caribou Records, who stipulated &quot;a structured recording process&quot; before signing Dennis to a two-album contract. According to Guercio, &quot;My discussions with Dennis were along the lines of, &#x27;You just tell Gregg [Jakobson] what you need - you have the studio and your job is to finish the dream. Finish the vision. Trish Roach [personal assistant] will do the paperwork and Gregg&#x27;s the co-ordinator. It&#x27;s your project... You&#x27;ve got to do what Brian used to do. Use anybody you want - it&#x27;s your decision and you&#x27;re responsible.&quot;

Dennis released his debut solo album &quot;Pacific Ocean Blue&quot; in 1977. Although it sold moderately, ultimately reaching No. 96 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; chart, its chart peak outperformed the following two Beach Boys albums. Dates were booked for a Dennis Wilson solo tour, but these were ultimately cancelled when his record company withdrew concert support. He did occasionally perform his solo material on the 1977 Beach Boys tour. Despite Dennis claiming the album had &quot;no substance&quot;, &quot;Pacific Ocean Blue&quot; received positive reviews and later developed status as a cult item, ultimately selling nearly 250,000 copies.

The album remained largely out of print between the 1990s and 2000s. In June 2008, it was reissued on CD as an expanded edition. It was voted the 2008 &quot;Reissue of the Year&quot; in both &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, and &quot;Mojo&quot; magazines and made No. 16 on the British LP charts and No. 8 on both the &quot;Billboard&quot; Catalog chart and the &quot;Billboard&quot; Internet Sales chart.

===&quot;Bambu&quot;===
&quot;Pacific Ocean Blue&quot; follow-up, &quot;Bambu&quot;, began production in 1978 at Brother Studios, with the collaboration of then Beach Boys keyboardist and Dennis&#x27; close friend Carli Muñoz as songwriter and producer. The first four songs officially recorded for &quot;Bambu&quot; were Muñoz&#x27;s compositions: &quot;It&#x27;s Not Too Late&quot;, &quot;Constant Companion&quot;, &quot;All Alone&quot;, and &quot;Under the Moonlight&quot;. The project was initially scuttled by lack of financing, Dennis&#x27; physical and mental decline due to alcoholism and severe drug abuse, which stemmed from his severe economic and marital problems at the time, and the distractions of simultaneous Beach Boys projects. &quot;Bambu&quot; was officially released in 2008 along with the &quot;Pacific Ocean Blue&quot; reissue. This material was also released on vinyl in 2017, without &quot;Pacific Ocean Blue&quot;, for Record Store Day.

Two songs from the &quot;Bambu&quot; sessions, &quot;Love Surrounds Me&quot; and &quot;Baby Blue&quot;, were lifted for the Beach Boys&#x27; &quot;L.A. (Light Album)&quot; (1979). Dennis and Brian also recorded together apart from the Beach Boys in the early 1980s. These sessions remain unreleased, although they are widely bootlegged as &quot;The Cocaine Sessions&quot;.

==Final years and death==

In succeeding years, Dennis abused alcohol, cocaine and heroin. By the last year of his life, he had virtually lost his normal speaking voice, struggled to sing, and had forgotten how to play drums, often missing Beach Boys performances in the process. Following a confrontation on an airport tarmac, he declared to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; on September 3, 1977, that he had left the Beach Boys: &quot;They kept telling me I had my solo album now, like I should go off in a corner and leave the Beach Boys to them. The album really bothers them. They don&#x27;t like to admit it&#x27;s doing so well; they never even acknowledge it in interviews.&quot; Two weeks later, disputes were resolved, and Dennis rejoined the group.

In January 1981, Brian&#x27;s then-girlfriend and nurse Carolyn Williams accused Dennis of enticing Brian to purchase about $15,000 worth of cocaine. When Brian&#x27;s bodyguard Rocky Pamplin and the Wilsons&#x27; cousin Stan Love learned of this incident, they physically assaulted Dennis at his home. For the assault, they were fined about $1,000, and Dennis filed a restraining order.

As the Beach Boys pressured Brian to readmit himself into Eugene Landy&#x27;s 24-hour therapy program, Dennis was informed by friends that he would be the band&#x27;s next target, to Dennis&#x27;s disbelief. His disbelief was proven wrong as the rest of the band gave him an ultimatum after his last performance in September 1983 to check into rehab for his alcohol problems or be banned from performing live with them. By then, he was homeless and living a nomadic life. He checked into a therapy center in Arizona for two days, and then on December 23, 1983, checked into St. John&#x27;s Hospital in Santa Monica, where he stayed until the evening of December 25, 1983. Following a violent altercation at the Santa Monica Bay Inn, Dennis checked into a different hospital in order to treat his wounds. Several hours later, he discharged himself and reportedly resumed drinking immediately.

On December 28, 1983, Dennis drowned at Marina Del Rey after drinking all day and then diving in the afternoon to recover his ex-wife&#x27;s belongings, previously thrown overboard at the marina from his yacht three years earlier amidst their divorce. Forensic pathologist Michael Hunter believed that Dennis experienced shallow-water blackout just before his death. On January 4, 1984, Dennis&#x27;s body was buried at sea by the U.S. Coast Guard, off the California coast. The Beach Boys released a statement shortly thereafter: &quot;We know Dennis would have wanted to continue in the tradition of the Beach Boys. His spirit will remain in our music.&quot; His song &quot;Farewell My Friend&quot; was played at the funeral.

Dennis&#x27;s widow Shawn Love reported that Dennis had wanted a burial at sea, and his brothers Carl and Brian did not want Dennis cremated. At the time, only veterans of the Coast Guard and Navy were allowed to be buried in US waters without being first cremated, but Dennis&#x27;s burial was made possible by the intervention of then-President Ronald Reagan. In 2002, Brian expressed unhappiness with the arrangement, believing that Dennis should have been given a traditional burial.

==Artistry and legacy==
&quot;PopMatters&quot; writer Tony Sclafani summarized in 2007:

A common misconception is that Dennis&#x27; drumming in the Beach Boys&#x27; recordings was filled in exclusively by studio musicians. His drumming is documented on a number of the group&#x27;s early hits, including &quot;I Get Around&quot;, &quot;Fun, Fun, Fun&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Worry Baby&quot;. As the mid-1960s approached, Brian often hired session drummers, such as Hal Blaine, to perform on studio recordings due to Dennis&#x27; limited drumming technique and frequent unavailability. Dennis accepted this situation with equanimity.

In 1967, Dennis was cited as &quot;the closest to brother Brian&#x27;s own musical ideals ... He always emphasises the fusion, in their work, of pop and classical music.&quot; Dennis said his brother Brian was an &quot;inspiration&quot;, not an influence, and that &quot;Musically, I&#x27;m far apart from Brian. He&#x27;s a hundred times more than what I am musically.&quot;

In 1988, Dennis was inducted into the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame posthumously as a member of the Beach Boys.

==Personal life==
Wilson&#x27;s first wife was Carole Freedman, with whom he had a daughter, Jennifer, and adopted son, Scott, from her previous relationship. They married on July 29, 1965, and divorced in 1967. His second was Barbara Charren, with whom he had two sons, Michael and Carl. Dennis&#x27;s songs &quot;Lady&quot; and &quot;Barbara&quot; were written about Charren. Dennis was then married twice to actress Karen Lamm, the former wife of Chicago keyboardist Robert Lamm, in 1976 and again in 1978.

In 1978, following a Beach Boys concert in Arizona, Dennis was arrested for sharing drugs and alcohol with a 16-year-old girl in his hotel room. Dennis referred to the incident as a setup, and paid $100,000 in legal fees.

From 1979 to 1982, Dennis had a very serious relationship with Christine McVie of Fleetwood Mac. Fleetwood Mac&#x27;s 1982 song &quot;Only Over You&quot; was written by McVie about Dennis. McVie later said of Dennis, &quot;Half of him was like a little boy, and the other half was insane.&quot; Mick Fleetwood, who had introduced the couple to each other, wrote that &quot;Chris almost went mad trying to keep up with Dennis, who was already like a man with twenty thyroid glands, not counting the gargantuan amounts of coke and booze he was shoving into himself.&quot;

At the time of his death, Wilson was married to (but separated from) Shawn Marie Harris (born on December 30, 1964), who claimed to be the daughter of his first cousin and bandmate, Mike Love, although Love disputed the claim. Wilson and Shawn had one son, Gage Dennis, born September 3, 1982.

<doc id="372239" wikidata="Q935680" url="?curid=372239" title="Tucuxi">
<text>The tucuxi (Sotalia fluviatilis), alternatively known in Peru bufeo gris or bufeo negro, is a species of freshwater dolphin found in the rivers of the Amazon basin. The word &quot;tucuxi&quot; is derived from the Tupi language word &quot;tuchuchi-ana&quot;, and has now been adopted as the species&#x27; common name. Despite being found in geographic locations similar to those of &#x27;true&#x27; river dolphins such as the boto, the tucuxi is not closely related to them genetically. Instead, it is classed in the oceanic dolphin family (Delphinidae).

Physically, the species resembles the bottlenose dolphins, but differs sufficiently to be placed in a separate genus, &quot;Sotalia&quot;. The Guiana dolphin (&quot;Sotalia guianensis&quot;), a related dolphin present in coastal and estuarine environments and formerly grouped together with the tucuxi, have recently been recognized as a distinct species.

==Description==
The tucuxi is frequently described (see references below) as looking similar to the bottlenose dolphin, but it is typically smaller at around 1.5 m (4.9 ft). The dolphin is colored light to bluish grey on its back and sides. The ventral region is much lighter, often pinkish. It is theorized that this pinkish color may be caused or intensified by increased blood flow. The dorsal fluke is typically slightly hooked. The beak is well-defined and of moderate length. There are 26 to 36 pairs of teeth in the upper and lower jaws. The tucuxi has one of the largest known encephalization quotients among mammals.

==Taxonomy==
The tucuxi (&quot;Sotalia fluviatilis&quot;) was described by Gervais and Deville in 1853, and the costero (&quot;Sotalia guianensis&quot;) by Pierre-Joseph van Bénéden in 1864. These two species were subsequently synonymized, with the two species being treated as subspecies of marine and freshwater varieties. The first to reassert differences between these two species was a three-dimensional morphometric study of Monteiro-Filho and colleagues. Subsequently, a molecular analysis by Cunha and colleagues unambiguously demonstrated that &quot;Sotalia guianensis&quot; was genetically differentiated from &quot;Sotalia fluviatilis&quot;. This finding was reiterated by Caballero and colleagues with a larger number of genes. The existence of two species has been generally accepted by the scientific community.

==Distribution==
The tucuxi exists along much of the length of the Amazon River and many of its tributaries, and is found in Venezuela, Brazil, Peru, Ecuador, and southeastern Colombia. Numerous individuals have been seen in the Orinoco River further north, though it is not clear whether these are tucuxi or costero. The tucuxi has recently been found to inhabit a larger range, including the northeast portion of Brazil such as the state of Amapa, which includes more basins than the Amazon basin. This species occurs in freshwater habitats only.

== Food and foraging ==
Tucuxis forage in tight groups, often chasing fish in rapid dashes just below the water surface, with fish jumping out of their way. Thirty species of fish are known to be prey, some living in protected lakes and channels, while others occur in fast-flowing rivers.

==Behaviour==
The tucuxi exists in small groups of about 10-15 individuals, and swim in tight-knit groups, suggesting a highly developed social structure. Tucuxis are quite active and may jump clear of the water (a behavior known as breaching), somersault, spy-hop or tail-splash. They are unlikely, however, to approach boats.

Tucuxis have been observed to feed with other river dolphins. They feed on a wide variety of fish. Studies of growth layers suggest the species can live up to 35 years . The oldest known animal was 36 years of age.

== Threats ==

=== Medicinal use ===
The oil and fat in the skin of tucuxi is used in local traditional medicine as an ointment to be rubbed on wounds or sore body parts. The ointment is thought to treat illnesses such as hemorrhoids, rheumatism, and arthritis, while the teeth are used in a powder form to treat asthma.

=== Magic and religious use ===
The eyes, teeth, and genital organs of tucuxi are sold throughout Northern Brazil as magical charms that promote good luck, love, and financial rewards. Baths are also created with these body parts and are meant to help one attract sexual partners if they bathed in the water. Other products such as perfumes and powders made with the genital organs are sold as aphrodisiacs. The number of dolphins harvested for magical or religious purposes and its effect on tucuxi populations is unknown.

=== Fishing ===
Interactions of tucuxi dolphins with fishing activity is common in the Western Brazilian Amazon. Tucuxi forage on schooling fish that are also important species for commercial fishing in the area. They are particularly vulnerable to entanglement in commercial fishing nets in the lower Japurá River. The carcasses of the dolphins caught incidentally or intentionally are often used as bait for piracatinga fishing.

=== Habitat degradation and loss ===
The tucuxi&#x27;s habitat has been greatly affected by anthropogenic activities including the expansion of hydroelectric projects, which usually results in isolation where a dam is built. Pollution from human activity has also degraded the quality of the habitat and increases the chance for tucuxis to consume heavy metals.

==Conservation==
The tucuxi is endemic to the regions described above; although no precise estimates of population are available, it is common. A significant human problem is fishing nets. Deliberate hunting in the Amazon basin for food has also been reported. Pollution, in particular, mercury poisoning of water due to gold mining, is a particular concern for this species. The IUCN also cites habitat fragmentation by dam construction as a threat, though more detailed study is necessary.

Tucuxis are observed not to maintain good health and attitude in captive environments. A few tucuxis remained in captivity in European aquaria, but the last one (&quot;Paco&quot;) died in 2009 in the Zoo of Münster, Germany.

The tucuxi is listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS) as it has an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.

<doc id="372240" wikidata="Q340145" url="?curid=372240" title="Tensor product of fields">
<text>In mathematics, the tensor product of two fields is their tensor product as algebras over a common subfield. If no subfield is explicitly specified, the two fields must have the same characteristic and the common subfield is their prime subfield.

The tensor product of two fields is sometimes a field, and often a direct product of fields; In some cases, it can contain non-zero nilpotent elements.

The tensor product of two fields expresses in a single structure the different way to embed the two fields in a common extension field.

==Compositum of fields==

First, one defines the notion of the compositum of fields. This construction occurs frequently in field theory. The idea behind the compositum is to make the smallest field containing two other fields. In order to formally define the compositum, one must first specify a tower of fields. Let &quot;k&quot; be a field and &quot;L&quot; and &quot;K&quot; be two extensions of &quot;k&quot;. The compositum, denoted &quot;K.L&quot;, is defined to be formula_1 where the right-hand side denotes the extension generated by &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot;. This assumes &quot;some&quot; field containing both &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot;. Either one starts in a situation where an ambient field is easy to identify (for example if &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; are both subfields of the complex numbers), or one proves a result that allows one to place both &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; (as isomorphic copies) in some large enough field.

In many cases one can identify &quot;K&quot;.&quot;L&quot; as a vector space tensor product, taken over the field &quot;N&quot; that is the intersection of &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot;. For example, if one adjoins √2 to the rational field formula_2 to get &quot;K&quot;, and √3 to get &quot;L&quot;, it is true that the field &quot;M&quot; obtained as &quot;K&quot;.&quot;L&quot; inside the complex numbers formula_3 is (up to isomorphism)

:formula_4

as a vector space over formula_2. (This type of result can be verified, in general, by using the ramification theory of algebraic number theory.)

Subfields &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; of &quot;M&quot; are linearly disjoint (over a subfield &quot;N&quot;) when in this way the natural &quot;N&quot;-linear map of

:formula_6

to &quot;K&quot;.&quot;L&quot; is injective. Naturally enough this isn&#x27;t always the case, for example when &quot;K&quot; = &quot;L&quot;. When the degrees are finite, injectivity is equivalent here to bijectivity. Hence, when &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; are linearly disjoint finite-degree extension fields over &quot;N&quot;, formula_7, as with the aforementioned extensions of the rationals.

A significant case in the theory of cyclotomic fields is that for the &quot;n&quot;th roots of unity, for &quot;n&quot; a composite number, the subfields generated by the &quot;p&quot;&quot;k&quot;&amp;hairsp;th roots of unity for prime powers dividing &quot;n&quot; are linearly disjoint for distinct &quot;p&quot;.

==The tensor product as ring==

To get a general theory, one needs to consider a ring structure on formula_8. One can define the product formula_9 to be formula_10 (see Tensor product of algebras). This formula is multilinear over &quot;N&quot; in each variable; and so defines a ring structure on the tensor product, making formula_8 into a commutative &quot;N&quot;-algebra, called the tensor product of fields.

==Analysis of the ring structure==

The structure of the ring can be analysed by considering all ways of embedding both &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; in some field extension of &quot;N&quot;. The construction here assumes the common subfield &quot;N&quot;; but does not assume &quot;a priori&quot; that &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; are subfields of some field &quot;M&quot; (thus getting round the caveats about constructing a compositum field). Whenever one embeds &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; in such a field &quot;M&quot;, say using embeddings α of &quot;K&quot; and β of &quot;L&quot;, there results a ring homomorphism γ from formula_8 into &quot;M&quot; defined by:

:formula_13

The kernel of γ will be a prime ideal of the tensor product; and conversely any prime ideal of the tensor product will give a homomorphism of &quot;N&quot;-algebras to an integral domain (inside a field of fractions) and so provides embeddings of &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; in some field as extensions of (a copy of) &quot;N&quot;.

In this way one can analyse the structure of formula_8: there may in principle be a non-zero nilradical (intersection of all prime ideals) – and after taking the quotient by that one can speak of the product of all embeddings of &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; in various &quot;M&quot;, &quot;over&quot; &quot;N&quot;.

In case &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; are finite extensions of &quot;N&quot;, the situation is particularly simple since the tensor product is of finite dimension as an &quot;N&quot;-algebra (and thus an Artinian ring). One can then say that if &quot;R&quot; is the radical, one has formula_15 as a direct product of finitely many fields. Each such field is a representative of an equivalence class of (essentially distinct) field embeddings for &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; in some extension &quot;M&quot;.

==Examples==

To give an explicit example consider the fields formula_16 and formula_17. Clearly formula_18 are isomorphic but technically unequal fields with their (set theoretic) intersection being the prime field formula_19. Their tensor product

: formula_20 

is not a field, but a 4-dimensional formula_2-algebra. Furthermore this algebra is isomorphic to a direct sum of fields

: formula_22 

via the map induced by formula_23.
Morally formula_24 should be considered the &quot;largest common subfield up to isomorphism&quot; of &quot;K&quot; and &quot;L&quot; via the isomorphisms formula_25. When one performs the tensor product over this better candidate for the largest common subfield we actually get a (rather trivial) field

: formula_26.

For another example, if &quot;K&quot; is generated over formula_2 by the cube root of 2, then formula_28 is the sum of (a copy of) &quot;K&quot;, and a splitting field of

:&quot;X&quot;&amp;hairsp;&amp;hairsp;3 − 2,

of degree 6 over formula_2. One can prove this by calculating the dimension of the tensor product over formula_2 as 9, and observing that the splitting field does contain two (indeed three) copies of &quot;K&quot;, and is the compositum of two of them. That incidentally shows that &quot;R&quot; = {0} in this case.

An example leading to a non-zero nilpotent: let

:&quot;P&quot;(&quot;X&quot;) = &quot;X&quot;&amp;hairsp;&amp;hairsp;&quot;p&quot; − &quot;T&quot;

with &quot;K&quot; the field of rational functions in the indeterminate &quot;T&quot; over the finite field with &quot;p&quot; elements (see Separable polynomial: the point here is that &quot;P&quot; is &quot;not&quot; separable). If &quot;L&quot; is the field extension &quot;K&quot;(&quot;T&quot; 1/&quot;p&quot;) (the splitting field of &quot;P&quot;) then &quot;L&quot;/&quot;K&quot; is an example of a purely inseparable field extension. In formula_31 the element

:formula_32

is nilpotent: by taking its &quot;p&quot;th power one gets 0 by using &quot;K&quot;-linearity.

==Classical theory of real and complex embeddings==

In algebraic number theory, tensor products of fields are (implicitly, often) a basic tool. If &quot;K&quot; is an extension of formula_2 of finite degree &quot;n&quot;, formula_34 is always a product of fields isomorphic to formula_35 or formula_3. The totally real number fields are those for which only real fields occur: in general there are &quot;r&quot;1 real and &quot;r&quot;2 complex fields, with &quot;r&quot;1 + 2&quot;r&quot;2 = &quot;n&quot; as one sees by counting dimensions. The field factors are in 1–1 correspondence with the &quot;real embeddings&quot;, and &quot;pairs of complex conjugate embeddings&quot;, described in the classical literature.

This idea applies also to formula_37 where formula_2&quot;p&quot; is the field of &quot;p&quot;-adic numbers. This is a product of finite extensions of formula_2&quot;p&quot;, in 1–1 correspondence with the completions of &quot;K&quot; for extensions of the &quot;p&quot;-adic metric on formula_2.

==Consequences for Galois theory==

This gives a general picture, and indeed a way of developing Galois theory
(along lines exploited in Grothendieck&#x27;s Galois theory). It can be shown that for separable extensions the radical is always {0}; therefore the Galois theory case is the &quot;semisimple&quot; one, of products of fields alone.

<text>Weimarer Land is a &quot;Landkreis&quot; (district) in the east of Thuringia, Germany. Neighboring districts are (from the northeast clockwise) the district Burgenlandkreis in Saxony-Anhalt, the district Saale-Holzland and the district-free city Jena, the district Saalfeld-Rudolstadt, Ilm-Kreis, and the district-free city Erfurt. The district-free city Weimar is completely enclosed by the district.

==History==
The district dates back to the &quot;Großkreis Weimar&quot;, which was created in 1922 after the federal state Thuringia was established. The two cities Weimar and Apolda were not part of the district. In 1952 the district was split into two parts - Weimar and Apolda. In 1994 the two parts were merged again, however not completely covering the territory as before 1952.
==Geography==
The main river in the district is the Ilm. To the south are the hills of the Thuringian Forest, where the highest elevation is the &quot;Riechheimer Berg&quot; with 511 m above sea level. To the north of the district the landscape becomes less hilly, it belongs to the &quot;Thüringer Becken&quot;. In this part is also the lowest elevation with 120 m, at the meeting of the rivers Ilm and Saale. Near Bad Salza starts the Saale-Unstrut wine route, as the viticulture in the district has a tradition of more than 800 years.

==Coat of arms==
The coat of arms shows symbols of the historic states on the territory of the district. The lion to the right stands for the dukes of Saxe-Weimar-Eisenach, the top left displays the Wheel of Mainz, and the three apples are the symbol of Apolda, as they were used in the coat of arms of the governors of Apolda. The coat of arms were granted on November 24, 1994.

<text>In ring theory, a branch of mathematics, a radical of a ring is an ideal of &quot;not-good&quot; elements of the ring.

The first example of a radical was the nilradical introduced by , based on a suggestion of . In the next few years several other radicals were discovered, of which the most important example is the Jacobson radical. The general theory of radicals was defined independently by and . 

==Definitions==
In the theory of radicals, rings are usually assumed to be associative, but need not be commutative and need not have a multiplicative identity. In particular, every ideal in a ring is also a ring.

A radical class (also called radical property or just radical) is a class σ of rings possibly without multiplicative identities, such that:

# the homomorphic image of a ring in σ is also in σ
# every ring &quot;R&quot; contains an ideal &quot;S&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) in σ that contains every other ideal of &quot;R&quot; that is in σ
# &quot;S&quot;(&quot;R&quot;/&quot;S&quot;(&quot;R&quot;)) = 0. The ideal &quot;S&quot;(&quot;R&quot;) is called the radical, or σ-radical, of &quot;R&quot;.

The study of such radicals is called torsion theory.

For any class δ of rings, there is a smallest radical class &quot;L&quot;δ containing it, called the lower radical of δ. The operator &quot;L&quot; is called the lower radical operator.

A class of rings is called regular if every non-zero ideal of a ring in the class has a non-zero image in the class. For every regular class δ of rings, there is a largest radical class &quot;U&quot;δ, called the upper radical of δ, having zero intersection with δ. The operator &quot;U&quot; is called the upper radical operator.

A class of rings is called hereditary if every ideal of a ring in the class also belongs to the class.

==Examples==

===The Jacobson radical===

Let &quot;R&quot; be any ring, not necessarily commutative. The Jacobson radical of R is the intersection of the annihilators of all simple right &quot;R&quot;-modules.

There are several equivalent characterizations of the Jacobson radical, such as:

*J(&quot;R&quot;) is the intersection of the regular maximal right (or left) ideals of &quot;R&quot;.
*J(&quot;R&quot;) is the intersection of all the right (or left) primitive ideals of &quot;R&quot;.
*J(&quot;R&quot;) is the maximal right (or left) quasi-regular right (resp. left) ideal of &quot;R&quot;.

As with the nilradical, we can extend this definition to arbitrary two-sided ideals &quot;I&quot; by defining J(&quot;I&quot;) to be the preimage of J(&quot;R/I&quot;) under the projection map &quot;R&quot; → &quot;R/I&quot;.

If &quot;R&quot; is commutative, the Jacobson radical always contains the nilradical. If the ring &quot;R&quot; is a finitely generated Z-algebra, then the nilradical is equal to the Jacobson radical, and more generally: the radical of any ideal &quot;I&quot; will always be equal to the intersection of all the maximal ideals of &quot;R&quot; that contain &quot;I&quot;. This says that &quot;R&quot; is a Jacobson ring.

===The Baer radical===
The Baer radical of a ring is the intersection of the prime ideals of the ring &quot;R&quot;. Equivalently it is the smallest semiprime ideal in &quot;R&quot;. The Baer radical is the lower radical of the class of nilpotent rings. Also called the &quot;lower nilradical&quot; (and denoted Nil∗&quot;R&quot;), the &quot;prime radical&quot;, and the &quot;Baer-McCoy radical&quot;. Every element of the Baer radical is nilpotent, so it is a nil ideal.

For commutative rings, this is just the nilradical and closely follows the definition of the radical of an ideal.

===The upper nil radical or Köthe radical===
The sum of the nil ideals of a ring &quot;R&quot; is the upper nilradical Nil*&quot;R&quot; or Köthe radical and is the unique largest nil ideal of &quot;R&quot;. Köthe&#x27;s conjecture asks whether any left nil ideal is in the nilradical.

=== Singular radical ===
An element of a (possibly non-commutative ring) is called left singular if it annihilates an essential left ideal, that is, &quot;r&quot; is left singular if &quot;Ir&quot; = 0 for some essential left ideal &quot;I&quot;. The set of left singular elements of a ring &quot;R&quot; is a two-sided ideal, called the left singular ideal, and is denoted formula_1. The ideal &quot;N&quot; of &quot;R&quot; such that formula_2 is denoted by formula_3 and is called the singular radical or the Goldie torsion of &quot;R&quot;. The singular radical contains the prime radical (the nilradical in the case of commutative rings) but may properly contain it, even in the commutative case. However, the singular radical of a Noetherian ring is always nilpotent.

===The Levitzki radical===
The Levitzki radical is defined as the largest locally nilpotent ideal, analogous to the Hirsch–Plotkin radical in the theory of groups. If the ring is Noetherian, then the Levitzki radical is itself a nilpotent ideal, and so is the unique largest left, right, or two-sided nilpotent ideal.

===The Brown–McCoy radical===
The Brown–McCoy radical (called the strong radical in the theory of Banach algebras) can be defined in any of the following ways: 
* the intersection of the maximal two-sided ideals
* the intersection of all maximal modular ideals
* the upper radical of the class of all simple rings with multiplicative identity

The Brown–McCoy radical is studied in much greater generality than associative rings with 1.

===The von Neumann regular radical===
A von Neumann regular ring is a ring &quot;A&quot; (possibly non-commutative without multiplicative identity) such that for every &quot;a&quot; there is some &quot;b&quot; with &quot;a&quot; = &quot;aba&quot;. The von Neumann regular rings form a radical class. It contains every matrix ring over a division algebra, but contains no nil rings.

===The Artinian radical===
The Artinian radical is usually defined for two-sided Noetherian rings as the sum of all right ideals that are Artinian modules. The definition is left-right symmetric, and indeed produces a two-sided ideal of the ring. This radical is important in the study of Noetherian rings, as outlined by .

<text>The Palais Bourbon () is the meeting place of the National Assembly, the lower legislative chamber of the French Parliament. It is in the 7th arrondissement of Paris, on the Rive Gauche of the Seine across from the Place de la Concorde.

The original palace was built beginning in 1722 for Louise Françoise de Bourbon, Duchess of Bourbon, the legitimised daughter of Louis XIV and the Marquise de Montespan. Four successive architects – Lorenzo Giardini, Pierre Cailleteau, Jean Aubert and Ange-Jacques Gabriel – completed the palace in 1728. It was then confiscated from Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé during the French Revolution and nationalised. From 1795 to 1799, during the Directory, it was the meeting place of the Council of Five Hundred, which chose the government leaders. Beginning in 1806, during Napoleon Bonaparte&#x27;s First French Empire, Bernard Poyet&#x27;s Neoclassical façade was added to mirror that of the Église de la Madeleine, facing it across the Seine beyond the Place de la Concorde.

The palace complex today has a floor area of , with over 9,500 rooms, in which 3,000 people work. The complex includes the Hôtel de Lassay, on the west side of the Palais Bourbon; it is the official residence of the President of the National Assembly.

==History==
===An aristocratic palace in Paris (1726–1789)===

The palace was built for Louise Françoise de Bourbon, Duchess of Bourbon (1673–1743), the legitimised daughter of Louis XIV and Madame de Montespan. Begun in 1722 and finished in 1728, it was located in what was then a largely rural quarter at the edge of Paris, which was about to become a very fashionable residential neighbourhood, the Faubourg Saint-Germain. Until that time, the area, called the Pré-au-Clercs, was a wooded area popular for fighting duels. After the death of Louis XIV in 1715, following the example of the Regent, the aristocracy began to move their residences from Versailles back to Paris. As building-space land was scarce in the traditional residential area of the nobility and the densely-populated Marais, the aristocracy of the &quot;Régence&quot; looked for land with space for gardens at the edges of the city, either near the Champs-Élysées, on the right bank, or on the left bank.

The Duchess of Bourbon had been known for frivolity at the court in Versailles, but by the 1720s, she had had seven children and was widowed. The reputed lover of the Duchess, Armand de Madaillan de Lesparre, &quot;Comte de Lassay&quot;, proposed the site of the palace to her; he had purchased land next door along the Seine, and the two buildings were constructed at the same time. The parcel of land for the new palace was large, extending from the Seine to the Rue de l&#x27;Université.
The original plan called for a country residence surrounded by gardens, modelled after the Grand Trianon at Versailles, designed by Jules Hardouin-Mansart, the chief architect of Louis XIV. The Italian architect Lorenzo Giardini made the first plan, but he died in 1722, having made only first sketches. The project was taken over by Pierre Cailleteau, also known as Lassurance, who had been an assistant to Hardouin-Mansart. Cailleteau had worked on the Palace of Versailles and Les Invalides, and he knew the royal style very well, but he died in 1724. He was replaced by Jean Aubert, also a former assistant of Hardouin-Mansart. Aubert had built one of the grandest projects of the time, the stables of the royal residence at Chantilly. In the meantime, the construction of the neighbouring Hôtel de Lassay had begun, following a plan by another noted architect, Ange-Jacques Gabriel, the designer of the buildings around the now-Place de la Concorde. Both buildings were finished in 1728.

Both the Palais Bourbon and the Hôtel de Lassay were in the Italian style, with roofs hidden by balustrades and invisible from street level. The Palais Bourbon was in a U-shape. The main building was parallel to the Seine, with two wings enclosing a courtyard. The entrance to the courtyard and building was on the Rue de l&#x27;Université. The entrance to the courtyard had an ornate archway, flanked by two pavilions. The Hôtel de Lassay was rectangular and more modest in size. The two buildings had identical façades facing the Seine, and featured alternating columns and windows, and decoration on the themes of the seasons, the elements, and, fitting for the daughter of the Sun King, about Apollo. The space between the buildings, and between the buildings and the Seine, was filled with gardens. In addition to the large reception rooms, the interior of the house had many small salons which could be arranged for a variety of purposes. It also had a novelty for buildings of the period; corridors, so one could pass through the building without walking through the rooms. None of the original apartments of the Duchess survive; as they were destroyed in the subsequent remodellings. The Duchesse de Bourbon died in 1743, and de Lassay died in 1750. The palace was purchased by Louis XV, who seems to have wished to include it in the plan of the new Place Louis XV (now the Place de la Concorde) which he was building on the other side of the river. But in 1756 he sold it to grandson of the Duchess, Louis Joseph, Prince of Condé, who had been a military hero in the just-concluded Seven Years&#x27; War. The Prince decided to largely rebuild it, turning it from a country house into a monumental palace, in the new Neoclassical style. With this in mind, in 1768 he purchased the neighbouring Hôtel de Lassay, and planned to make the two buildings into one. A new plan was drawn by Marie-Joseph Peyre, whose style was based on archeological studies of ancient Rome and Greece. Peyre&#x27;s other neoclassical works included the Odéon Theatre. Several different architects were engaged in the project, including Jacques-Germain Soufflot, Bellisard and Charpentier.

For the Neoclassical palace of the Prince, the entrance on the Rue de l&#x27;Université was replaced by a larger and more impressive gate, framed by a gallery of columns. The two wings of the building were extended, and a pavilion was created with apartments for one of his sons. An abundance of military decoration, including stucco sculptures of shields and weapons, was added to the vestibule, and are still visible today. The palace was only finished at the end of the 1780s, at the same time that the French Revolution began. The Prince went into exile following the storming of the Bastille, thus becoming an émigré in the eyes of Revolutionaries, and the two residences were confiscated by the Revolutionary government in 1791.

===The Revolution, Consulate, and Empire (1789–1814)===

The first French National Assembly gathered without royal authorisation on 20 June 1789 in the tennis court of the Palace of Versailles. the first step of the French Revolution, and in May 1793 moved to the empty theatre of the Tuileries Palace in Paris. Most of the aristocracy had fled France for its safety, and the Palais Bourbon and Hôtel de Lassay, like the Luxembourg Palace, Élysée Palace, Hôtel Matignon, and countless other estates were nationalised and used for government functions. The stables of the palace became the headquarters of the administration of military transport, while the Palais Bourbon became, in 1794, the Central School of Public Works, which later became, under Napoleon Bonaparte, the École Polytechnique, the famous military engineering school.

In 1793 and 1794 the Revolution reached its peak of fury and disorder, under the Convention led by Robespierre and Saint-Just. The two leaders of the Terror were arrested and executed on 28 July 1794, and a new government, the Directory, took power. On 23 September 1795 a new constitution was adopted, which called for a parliament with two Chambers, the Council of Five Hundred, the future National Assembly, and the Council of the Ancients. The Council of Five Hundred was given the Palais Bourbon as its future meeting place. The new government commissioned the architects Jacques-Pierre Gisors and Emmanuel-Cherubin Leconte to turn the apartments of the palace along the Seine into a meeting Chamber. The Chamber they designed was in the shape of a hemicycle, similar to a Roman theatre, and was covered with a cupola modelled after that of the amphitheatre of the Academy of Surgery, located not far away in Saint-Germain-des-Prés, which had been built between 1769 and 1774. A few other changes were made to the palace; a vestibule and rotunda was added in the courtyard, and a wooden gallery was constructed to connect the palace with the Hôtel de Lassay.

Two features of the original Chamber can still be found in the current Chamber; the desk and armchair of the president of the National Assembly, made of wood and gilded bronze, designed in a classical Roman style by Jacques-Louis David and the bas-relief behind the tribune, made of carved white marble framed in dark polychrome marble. It features two female figures representing allegorical figures of History and Fame. Fame is announcing the laws with a long trumpet, while History is inscribing them on a tablet. In the center is a bust of Marianne, a symbol of the French Republic, wearing a medallion of the Roman god Janus, whose two faces illustrate the motto that the experience of the past predicts the future. The construction of the Chamber drastically modified the building, as the roof had to be raised well above the old façade. It was also out of alignment with the long axis composed of the Église de la Madeleine, the Place de la Concorde, and the Pont de la Concorde; the view of the Palais Bourbon from the Place de la Concorde was blocked by the decoration of the bridge.

The Council of Five Hundred began meeting on 21 January 1798, a date chosen because it was the anniversary of the murder of the &#x27;last tyrant&#x27;, King Louis XVI. The members arrived dressed in Roman togas and caps, in the Neoclassical fashion. They quickly found out that the new Chamber had little ventilation, was feebly heated in winter, and the acoustics were poor, making it hard to hear the speakers. On 8 November 1799 Napoleon Bonaparte organized a coup d&#x27;état and seized power from the Council of Five Hundred, then meeting at the château de Saint-Cloud. Napoleon formed a new legislature, the &quot;Corps législatif&quot;, whose only duty was to listen to an annual speech by him, now First Consul, and to adopt the laws proposed by the Council of State, debated by another new body, the &quot;Tribunat&quot;.

In 1806 the bureau of the &quot;Corps législatif&quot; proposed the construction of a new façade facing the Seine, which would be aligned with and would match that of the Temple of Glory (which would later be restored to being the Église de la Madeleine) which Napoleon was building at the end of Rue Royale, to the north of the Place de la Concorde. The new Neoclassical façade, designed by architect Bernard Poyet, had twelve corinthian columns in an entirely different style from the Italianate 18th century palace behind it, but it was high enough to be visible from the Place de la Concorde and was correctly aligned to be visible from the Madeleine. The original &quot;fronton&quot; of the façade featured bas-reliefs by sculptor Antoine-Denis Chaudet, showed scenes from the opening of the Corps législatif in 1806; it showed Napoleon on horseback, offering to the members of the Legislature the flags which had been captured from the Austrians at the Battle of Austerlitz, and the inscription, &#x27;To Napoleon I the Great – the Corps législatif&#x27;. In 1810, statues of the goddess Themis, holding a scale in her left hand, and Athena, the symbol of wisdom, were placed in front of the façade on the Seine, along with statues of famous royal ministers, Maximilien de Béthune, Duke of Sully, Jean-Baptiste Colbert, and Henri François d&#x27;Aguesseau, Poyet made two important modifications to the interior; he added two salons, the &quot;Salle des Gardes&quot; and the &quot;Salon de l&#x27;Empereur&quot;, which was intended for the use of Napoleon during his rare visits to the building. Both these rooms retain much of their original decor, trompe-l&#x27;oeil paintings by Alexandre-Évariste Fragonard, the son of the famous court painter of Louis XIV.

===Bourbon Restoration and Louis Philippe: the Chamber of Deputies===

After the fall of Napoleon in 1814, the House of Bourbon was restored under Louis XVIII, but preserved some of the democratic institutions begun during the Revolution. The new government, like the Directory, featured a legislature with two houses, the Chamber of Deputies and the Senate. The Palais Bourbon was formally returned to its aristocratic owner, the Prince of Condé, who had returned from exile. However, the building had been so modified it was impossible to use as a residence; the Prince rented a large part of the palace to the new Chamber of Deputies. The first modification made by the new government, in July of 1815, just a month after Napoleon&#x27;s final defeat at Waterloo, was to erase the inscription to Napoleon, the five bas-reliefs and the numerous Ns and eagles that had been carved on the façades. The bas-relief featuring Napoleon on the Seine façade was replaced by a plaster bas-relief by Alexandre-Évariste Fragonard of Louis XVIII signing the Charter of 1814, the founding document of the new government. The Chamber of Deputies continued to rent the space until 1827, when it finally bought the building from the House of Condé for 5,250,000 francs. Busts of Louis XVI, Louis XVII, and Louis XVIII were also added.

The meeting hall was in a deplorable condition, so the Chamber decided on a major renovation. The architect Jules de Joly (1788–1865) who had been the official architect of the Chamber since 1821, was selected for the task. The architect proposed four possible new shapes for the hall; an ellipse, rectangle, octagon and hemicycle, but the Chamber decided to keep the original hemicycle. De Joly also was asked to redesign the three salons which faced the cour d&#x27;honneur. The plan was submitted in January 1828, approved in April 1829, and the first stone was placed on 4 November 1829. Over three hundred workers were engaged on the project, one of the largest undertaken in Paris during the Restoration. Work continued, despite the Revolution of 1830 that brought down the House of Bourbon and replaced it with a new dynasty. Louis Philippe d&#x27;Orléans, proclaimed King of the French, came to take the oath to the Chamber in its temporary meeting place. A second project, that of constructing a library, was commenced in April 1831. The new interior was completed in September 1832, and formally inaugurated by Louis Philippe on 19 November 1832.

The meeting hall of the deputies kept the same hemicycle form, but the floor was lowered, giving greater height to the ceiling, and increasing the height of the tribune and the desk of the president. A colonnade and balconies, in the form of an arch of triumph, was constructed behind the tribune, giving the appearance of a theatrical stage. The central panel above and behind the tribune was occupied by a large painting of Louis Philippe taking his oath before the Assembly. Niches were constructed on either side of the tribune, with statues of &#x27;Liberty&#x27; and &#x27;Public Order&#x27; by Pradet. The four columns of the arch were decorated with statues representing Force, Justice, Prudence and Eloquence.

The plan by Joly also turned the building around. Under Napoleon, the main entrance, where he entered for his annual address, was on the Seine, under the grand colonnade. Under the new plan, the main entrance was placed on the courtyard, where a delegation of deputies met the Louis Philippe, when he came to the building each year to open the session. To give this entrance greater prominence, Joly constructed a Neoclassical portico with four Corinthian columns, modelled after the ancient Temple of Jupiter Stator. Joly&#x27;s project greatly increased the interior space of the building, adding three new salons (now the Salons Delacroix, Casimir-Périer, and Abel de Pujol). Under the new plan, it was possible to go from one wing of the building to the other without having to cross the courtyard or pass through the meeting Chamber. 
In 1837 a new project was begun to finish the exterior decoration, particularly on the façade facing the Seine. The original three bas-reliefs on the façade beneath the colonnade had been removed with the fall of the Empire, and were not replaced; but two new works replaced other Napoleonic bas-reliefs; &quot;Prometheus animating the arts&quot; by Rude and &quot;Public Education&quot; by James Pradier. The bas-relief on the &quot;fronton&quot;, which had originally depicted Napoleon bringing the flags of Austerlitz to the Assembly, was replaced by a new work by Corton entitled &quot;France supported by Force and Justice&quot;. For the new entry portico on the courtyard, Joly commissioned two new statues by Gayard; titled &quot;France&quot; and &quot;Liberty&quot;. These two statues were not installed until 1860, under Napoleon III, and were given new names; &quot;Force&quot; and &quot;France deposits her ballot in the voting urn.&quot;

The interior minister of Louis Philippe and future president of France, Adolphe Thiers, oversaw the interior decoration of the Assembly. He selected the promising young painter Eugène Delacroix, just 25 years old, to paint murals for the Salon of the King (&quot;Salon du Roi&quot;), though Louis Philippe, in fact, detested Delacroix&#x27;s style. Between 1833 and 1838 Delacroix created a series of allegorical figures representing Justice, Truth, Prudence, War, Industry, and Agriculture. The murals are preserved in what is now called the Salon Delacroix. Another salon, known as the Salon de la Paix, was decorated with allegories by Horace Vernet, illustrating two themes important to Louis Philippe&#x27;s regime: peace in Europe and the expansion of commerce and industry. They showed French ships carrying goods from the new French colonies in Africa, ships in the port of Marseille, the textile mills of Lyon, and a locomotive of the new railways. A third salon was painted by Abel de Pujol, who painted scenes from the history of governments in France, from Charlemagne to Louis Philippe.

The project of reconstruction included a new library, on the east side of the palace. The style was highly classical, and resembled that of the ancient Roman baths; pillars supported five cupolas, over a gallery closed by two semi-circular bays. The lighting came from a recent innovation, skylights; it was later copied in the National Library of France. The painter Eugène Delacroix was commissioned to paint the interior, a project which lasted from 1838 until 1846. Supported by a team of assistants, Delacroix painted the five cupolas and the two hemicycles of the library with a series of allegorical paintings on the themes of philosophy, natural history, legislation, eloquence, literature, poetry and theology; a panorama of all the aspects of civilisation.

Despite the new construction, the Chamber of Deputies was still desperately short of space for meeting rooms and offices. The president lived far from the palace – first on the Rue de Lille then on Place Vendôme. The Chamber purchased the west wing of the palace in 1830, and the Hôtel de Lassay in 1843. Joly once again was the architect chosen to redo the building; his plan called adding another story and restoring, as much as possible, the original Italianate style, both inside and outside. The result was a building which was more intimate and elegant than its Neoclassical neighbor. The work was begun in 1845, and was nearly finished when the French Revolution of 1848 broke out. After days of turmoil and fighting, Louis Philippe abdicated and fled France. The Chamber of Deputies was dissolved, opening the way for the French Second Republic.

===The Second Republic and Second Empire (1848–1870)===

Following the revolution in February 1848, France and its legislature entered a turbulent period. The enormous painting of Louis Philippe taking his oath, hung over the tribune in the Chamber of Deputies, was taken down and replaced by a Gobelin tapestry of the painting of Raphael, &quot;The School of Athens&quot;, made between 1683 and 1688. The Chamber of Deputies elected in 1846 was abruptly disbanded by the revolution. A new election by direct universal suffrage chose a Constituent Assembly. The Constituent Assembly met for the first time in the temporary Chamber which had been constructed in the garden of the Palais Bourbon, and then, on 4 May, the French Second Republic was proclaimed at the palace. On May 15 a mob with red flags invaded the Chamber, demanding a much more radical government. Another unsuccessful attempt to seize the government was launched in June 1848. A new National Assembly was elected along with a new president, Charles-Louis Napoléon Bonaparte, the nephew of Napoleon, who had lived most of his life in exile. On 2 December 1851, when the Assembly refused to change the constitution to allow him to run for a second term, Louis Napoléon organised a coup d&#x27;état, took power, and had himself proclaimed Napoleon III, Emperor of the French, ending the Second Republic. Opposition deputies were arrested and exiled. The Assembly continued to meet in the Palais Bourbon, but had little influence. They were not allowed to speak from the Tribune but only from the floor of the Chamber.

After 1860, the regime was liberalised, giving the deputies greater influence; freedom of speech and press was reestablished, and debates resumed in the Palais Bourbon. On 31 May 1861 a musical and theatrical evening from the Bouffes-Parisiens company, which included the premiere of Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;M. Choufleuri restera chez lui le . . .&quot;, was hosted. In 1870, the Assembly voted with patriotic enthusiasm for a war with Prussia, despite the opposition of a few deputies, including Adolphe Thiers. In a matter of weeks the French army was defeated, Louis Napoléon was captured, the Empire collapsed, and on 2–3 September the French Third Republic was founded.

===The Third Republic (1871–1940) ===
After the defeat at Sedan, A provisional government of Parliament leaders was formed, and tried to continue the war, but Paris was soon surrounded. The leader of the provisional government, Léon Gambetta, had to escape from Paris by balloon. The Palais Bourbon was abandoned; the Assembly moved first to Bordeaux and then to Versailles. The Paris Commune seized power in the city in March 1871, but in May was suppressed by the French Army. The Palais Bourbon escaped destruction, unlike the Tuileries Palace, Hôtel de Ville, the Palace of Justice, State Council, and other government buildings, which were set on fire in the last days of the Commune. While the French Senate returned to Paris soon after the suppression of the Commune, the Assembly remained in Versailles until 27 November 1879.

The new Assembly of the Third Republic was considerably larger than that of early governments, with 531 deputies, compared with 260 under the Second Empire. The new president of the Chamber, Léon Gambetta, called for a study and plan to enlarge the meeting space. A long series of enlargement plans were considered between 1879 and 1913, but none were ever approved.

During the Third Republic, the Palais Bourbon was the home of the primary institution of the French government. The Assembly selected the president of France and controlled finances and foreign policy. Its members were divided between constitutional monarchists and conservatives, who sat to the right of the Chamber as seen from the podium, and the moderate and radical republicans and later socialists, who sat to the left. The Chamber saw many eloquent and spirited debates between the leaders of the parties, and sometimes turmoil. In 1898, during the Dreyfus affair, the socialist leader Jean Jaurès was struck by a monarchist deputy while giving a speech in the Chamber, and a bomb placed by an anarchist exploded in the gallery in 1890. The Assembly declared war in 1914 and celebrated victory in 1918, but was badly divided in the 1930s and was unable to manage the economic crisis and the approach of World War II.

===World War II and Fourth and Fifth Republics===

In June 1940, as the Nazis approached the capital, the government fled Paris and moved first to Tours; then to Bordeaux; and then, under the Pétain government, to Vichy. The Germans used the Palais Bourbon as the military court for the Luftwaffe, and it also housed the offices of the French bureau which sent French workers to factories in Germany. German propaganda banners decorated the Seine façade of the palace. During the liberation of Paris in August 1944, parts of the palace were badly damaged. A fire in the library started by the fighting destroyed twenty thousand books. Philippe de Gaulle, the son of Charles de Gaulle, was sent from Montparnasse Station on 25 August 1944 with orders for the Germans troops entrenched within National Assembly at the Palais Bourbon to surrender. Despite being unarmed and the risk of being killed, he negotiated their surrender.

The Fourth Republic was founded by the adoption of a new constitution in 1946 and brought new technology to the Palais Bourbon, including the first microphones for speakers, but featured a large number of political parties and unstable coalitions which frequently collapsed. The Algerian Crisis of 1956 brought an end to the Fourth Republic, the approval of a new constitution, and the adoption of the still-existing Fifth Republic.

==Today==
===The Cour d&#x27;Honneur===

The Cour d&#x27;Honneur, to the south of the palace, has been the main entrance since the original palace was constructed. It was considerably modified in the 1830s, with the addition of the ceremonial portico over the doorway, but still retains its original outlines. The sculptures on either side of the entrance, representing Universal Suffrage and the Law, were added during the Second Empire in 1860. The granite ball on a pedestal in the centre of the courtyard, called the Sphere of Human Rights, is by the American sculptor Walter De Maria. It was added in 1989 to commemorate the bicentennial of the French Revolution.

===Meeting Chamber===

The &quot;Salle des Séances&quot;, or meeting Chamber of the Palais Bourbon, has the same basic appearance and arrangement as it did in 1832. Per the constitution, the Assembly is in session for nine months, from the beginning of October until the end of June, but the deputies can be summoned at any time for a special session by the president of the French Republic. The 577 deputies, elected for five-year terms, are seated in the hemicycle, with the deputies of the socialists and other parties of the left seated to the left of the speaker, and those of the more conservative parties to the right. The president of the Assembly is seated in the &quot;perchoir&quot;, or perch, a desk high up against the wall of the Chamber, at the height of the highest back row, symbolising that the president is a deputy like the others. The armchair was designed by Jacques-Louis David for the Council of Five Hundred, the first legislature to meet in the building.

deputies vote electronically by pushing a button, and the count is displayed at the front of the Chamber. The sessions of the Chamber are open to the public though access must be requested through the office of a deputy. The sessions are also transmitted live on the Internet site of the Assembly.

===Salons===

The salons of the Palais Bourbon were created during the reign of Louis Philippe and were decorated by prominent artists, most notably Eugène Delacroix: 
*The Salle Casimir-Périer is a wide corridor with a vaulted ceiling which connects the Assembly Chamber with the salons and with the courtyard. The architecture is inspired by that of ancient Rome. Its primary decoration is a massive bronze bas-relief depicting the first meetings of the Assembly during the French Revolution, by sculptor Jules Dalou. It was originally designed for a monument to the Revolution that was never constructed and was then, at the request of Assembly president Léon Gambetta, cast in bronze for the Palais Bourbon. It weighs four tons. The hall also includes six statues of illustrious members of the Assembly by different themes: statues of Mirabeau and Maximilien Sébastien Foy representing resistance to absolute governments; statues of Jean Sylvain Bailly and Casimir-Périer representing resistance to popular sedition; and statues celebrating the authors of the French Civil Code, Jean-Étienne-Marie Portalis and François Denis Tronchet. The decoration also includes bas-reliefs under the ceiling at either end representing Law as the protector and Law avenging injustice. The lunettes illuminating the hall also have sculptural decoration, representing Meditation, Justice, Peace, Work, Industry, Commerce, Force, War, Maritime commerce, and Agriculture. This hall is the place in which members of the government gather before they go into the Chamber on Tuesdays and Wednesdays, when they answer questions from the deputies.
*The Salon Delacroix was decorated by Delacroix beginning when the artist was just twenty-five years old. It was originally called the Salon de Roi and was meant as a place in which Louis Philippe could meet with the deputies when he came to the Chamber. The work was completed in 1836. The dominant elements of the decoration are four allegorical figures, which, according to Delacroix, symbolised &#x27;the living forces of the State; Justice, Agriculture, Industry, and War&#x27;. Two grisaille allegorical paintings of the Ocean and the Mediterranean decorate the west wall. The niche between these paintings originally held the throne used by Louis Philippe during his visits to the Palais Bourbon. The salon is now used as a gathering place for deputies of the left, whose seats are just inside, and informal parliamentary negotiations often take place here.
*The Salle des Pas Perdus originally contained a bedroom and baths in the residence of the Duchess. It was transformed into a formal hall under Louis Philippe, was decorated with paintings by Horace Vernet and Charles Séchan, and was finished in 1839. The centrepiece of the decoration by Vernet is the painting &quot;Peace distributes her benefits&quot;, flanked by &quot;The Genius of steam&quot;, representing a steam railroad locomotive, newly introduced to France; and &quot;the Genius of Steam chasing the gods of the Sea&quot;, featuring a steamship. Following a tradition begun under Louis Phillipe, the president of the Assembly walks through the room on his way from the Hôtel de Lassay to the afternoon session in the hemicycle. When he arrives in the room, drums sound, and he walks through two ranks of Republican Guards with swords who salute his passage.
*The Salon Abel de Pujol was created in 1838–1840 under Louis Philippe. It takes its name from the artist Abel de Pujol who painted the grisailles on the ceiling, which illustrate the role of French monarchs in the establishment of law; Clovis I, the author of the first French laws; Charlemagne; Louis IX (Saint Louis); and Louis Philippe himself, by the Charter of 1830, which established his government. Today, the Salon is used especially as a gathering place for deputies of the right during sessions of the Assembly, where they negotiate last-minute changes and tactics.
*The Salon des Quatre Colonnes is decorated with several works of sculpture which originally stood in the Chamber of the Council of Five Hundred in 1798, and were removed during the works of 1832; statues of ancient legislators; Brutus, Lycurgus, Solomon, and Cato. On either side of the doorway to the Assembly Chamber are busts of two famous deputies symbolising the right and the left; the Christian Democrat Albert de Mun and the socialist Jean Jaurès. A marble monument shows the names of deputies killed in the First World War, and a statue of the Republic commemorates the deputies and Assembly officers who died in the Second World War. The room is used during Assembly sessions for stand-up television interviews with deputies.

===Library===

The Library was built beginning in 1830 against the side of the original palace. The design is from architect Jules de Joly, in the style of the ancient Roman baths, with pillars supporting five cupolas, which provide light. It is closed at either end by curved bays. The decoration, by Eugène Delacroix and a team of assistants, was done between 1838 and 1847. The paintings on the ceiling around each of the cupolas represents a different branch of human knowledge; poetry, theology, legislation, philosophy, and the sciences. The stories that illustrate the themes were taken from antiquity, rather than from French history. They represent the great thinkers Ovid, Demosthenes, Herodotus, and Aristotle, as well as scenes representing the dangers to democracy and civilisation; the death of Saint John the Baptist, the death of Seneca the Younger, and the murder of Archimedes by a Roman soldier. The large paintings on the bays at either end of the room represent &quot;Orpheus bringing the benefits of the arts and civilization&quot; and &quot;Attila and his barbarian hordes at the feet of Italy and the Arts.&quot;

The original collection of the library was assembled from books confiscated from the libraries of the clergy and aristocracy who left Paris during the Revolution. It also includes many rare items donated to the Assembly, including the minutes of the trial of Joan of Arc, the manuscripts of Jean-Jacques Rousseau, donated by his widow in 1794, and the Codex Borbonicus, an Aztec codex written by Aztec priests shortly before or after the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire. The library is reserved for the use of the members of the Assembly and their staff. It&#x27;s not open to the public.

===Salle des Conférences and Buffet===
The Salle des Conférences is a large room with tables and lamps on the east side of the hemicycle, where the deputies can read, talk, and check their messages. It was originally the dining room of the Prince de Condé and was transformed in 1830 into its present use. The ceiling is richly decorated with paintings by Heim on the history of the monarchy and parliaments; by the fireplace are large historical paintings on parliamentary subjects; such as &quot;The Patriotic Devotion of the Bourgeois of Calais&quot; by Ary Scheffer.

Next to the Salle des Conférences is the Buffet, which was created in 1994 in the Belle Époque style and renovated in the same style in 1997. It is reserved exclusively for the use of current and former deputies.

===Hôtel de Lassay===

The adjacent Hôtel de Lassay, connected by a gallery to the Palais Bourbon, serves as the official residence of the National Assembly&#x27;s president. The building underwent major reconstruction in 1846–48 which added an additional story, but the 18th century style of the exterior and interior layout of the building was preserved.

The Cabinet du Départ takes its name from its function; the president of the Assembly departs from this room when a bell announces that the 15:00 session of the Assembly is about to begin. The room is lavishly decorated with a carpet from the period of Louis XIV, originally in Grand Gallery of the Louvre Palace; and a tapestry which reproduces the tapestry of the School of Athens by Raphael that hangs over the president&#x27;s seat in the Assembly Chamber. The room was the original study of the house before the Revolution. The desk was brought from the Palace of Versailles in 1794 during the Revolution for the use of the Committee of Public Safety.

The Salon des Jeux is a conference room on the ground floor of the residence, where the president of the Assembly meets with other Assembly leaders to set the agenda for the sessions. It takes its name from an illustration over the door of a game of lawn bowling by the 18th century artist Heim.

The Salle des Fêtes and the Galerie des Tapisseries are located in the building that connects the Hôtel de Lassay with the Palais Bourbon. The Salle des Fêtes was built between 1846 and 1849, replacing an early wooden passage built in 1809. It is used today for expositions, ceremonies for visiting dignitaries, and the annual New Year&#x27;s greeting by the president of the Assembly. The Gallerie des Tapisseries was created in 1860 to display a collection of paintings. The paintings were removed in 1865 and replaced in 1900 with a set of nine Beauvais tapestries.

===Contemporary Art===

The Palais Bourbon contains several installations of contemporary art. One is a work of modern sculpture, a large granite sphere on a marble pedestal by the American sculptor Walter De Maria, which was installed in the Cour d&#x27;Honneur in 1989 to mark the 200th anniversary of the French Revolution. His design was selected after an international competition; the granite sphere contains a small heart made of gold.

A work by the Belgian artist Pierre Alechinsky was created in 1992 and occupies a small rotunda along the passageway between the Hôtel de Lassay and the Palais Bourbon. It is titled &#x27;The Fragile Garden&#x27; and illustrates the words of the poet Jean Tardieu: &#x27;Men search for the light in a fragile garden where the colours tremble&#x27;.

The Salon of Marianne, created in 2004, displays busts of Marianne, the symbol of the French Republic, from different periods and in different styles. It has displayed since 2015 a work by the American graffiti artist JonOne, called &quot;Liberté, Egalité, Fraternité,&quot; based on Delacroix&#x27;s famous &quot;Liberty Leading the People&quot;, it symbolises Youth, the Future, and Hope.

There are other notable contemporary works on display in the Palais Bourbon by Hervé Di Rosa, Djamel Tatah, Vincent Barré, and Fabienne Verdier.

<text>Upanayana () is a Hindu educational sacrament, one of the traditional saṃskāras or rites of passage that marked the acceptance of a student by a preceptor, such as a &quot;guru&quot; or &quot;acharya&quot;, and an individual&#x27;s initiation into a school in Hinduism. Some traditions consider the ceremony as a spiritual rebirth for the child or future &quot;dvija&quot;, twice born. It signifies the acquisition of the knowledge of and the start of a new and disciplined life as a brahmāchārya. According to the given community and its regional language, it is also known by numerous terms such as
&quot;mekhal&quot; in Kashmiri (मेखल), 
&quot;janeo&quot; in Punjabi (ਜਨੇਓ),
&quot;upnen/upvit&quot; in Rajasthani (उपनेन/उपवीत), &quot;jānoi&quot; in Gujrati (જાનોઇ), &quot;janya&quot; in Sindhi (जन्य),
&quot;janev&quot; in Bhojpuri (जनेव),
&quot;munja&quot; in Marathi (मुंजा), &quot;munji&quot; in Konkani (मुंजी), 
&quot;poite&quot; in Bangla (পৈতৈ),
&quot;brataghara&quot; in Odia (ବ୍ରତଘର), 
&quot;logun dioni&quot; in Assamese (লগুণ দিওনী), 
&quot;bratabandha&quot; in Nepali (ब्रतबन्ध),
&quot;chewar&quot; in Newari (छेवार),
&quot;upanayana&quot; in Kannada (ಉಪನಯನ),
&quot;upanayanamu&quot; in Telugu (ఉపనయనము),
&quot;upanayanam&quot; in Malayalam (ഉപനയനം), and 
&quot;upanayanam&quot; or &quot;pūṇūl&quot; in Tamil (உபநயனம் or பூணூல்).&quot;&quot; The Upanayanam ceremony is arguably the most important rite for Brāhmaṇa, Kṣatriya, and Vaiśya males, ensuring his rights with responsibilities and signifying his advent into adulthood&quot;.&quot;

The tradition is widely discussed in ancient Samskṛta texts of Hinduism and varies regionally. The sacred thread or yajñopavīta (also referred to as &quot;Janeu&quot;, &quot;Jandhyam&quot;, &quot;Pūṇūl, Muñja and Janivara&quot; Yonya) has become one of the most important identifiers of the &quot;Upanayana&quot; ceremony in contemporary times, however this was not always the case. Generally, this ceremony should be performed before the advent of adulthood.

==Etymology==

=== &quot;Upanayana&quot; ===
&quot;Upanayana&quot; literally means &quot;the act of leading to or near, bringing&quot;, &quot;introduction (into any science)&quot; or &quot;initiation&quot; (as elucidated by Monier-Williams). Upanayana is formed from the root √&quot;nī&quot; meaning &#x27;to lead&#x27;. &quot;Nayana&quot; is a noun formed from the root √&quot;nī&quot; meaning &#x27;leading to&#x27;. The prefix &quot;upa&quot; means &#x27;near&#x27;. With the prefix the full literal meaning becomes &#x27;leading near (to)&#x27;. The initiation or rite of passage ceremony in which the sacred thread is given symbolizes the child drawn towards a school, towards education, by the guru or teacher. The student was being taken to the Gods and a disciplined life. As explained by PV Kane, taking (the child) near the acarya (for instruction), or alternately &quot;introducing to studenthood&quot;. It is a ceremony in which a teacher accepts and draws a child towards knowledge and initiates the second birth that is of the young mind and spirit.

=== Variations ===
A popular variation is &quot;Mauñjibandhana&quot;, derived from two words muñja, a type of grass, and &quot;bandhana&quot; which means to tie or bind. The munja grass is tied around the waist. This word was used by Manu. Another variation is &quot;vratabandha(na)&quot; meaning &quot;binding to an observance&quot;. The word &quot;janeu&quot; is a condensed version of &quot;yagyopaveeta&quot;. The ceremony is also known as &quot;punal kalyanam&quot; (meaning auspicious thread ceremony) and &quot;Brahmopadeśa&quot;.

=== &quot;Yajnopavita&quot; ===
The sacred thread or upper garment is called the &quot;yajñopavīta&quot; (), used as an adjective, which is derived from the terms &quot;yajña&quot; (sacrifice) and &quot;upavīta&quot; (worn)&quot;.&quot; The literal meaning would then become &quot;something worn on the body for the sacrifice&quot;. Accoutrements offered along with the &quot;yajnopavita&quot; may include be a &quot;daṇḍa&quot; (staff) and a &quot;mekhala&quot; (girdle).

==Description==
=== Background ===
The earliest form of this saṁskāra, whose name there are no records of, may have been to mark the acceptance of a person into a particular community. Indologically, the ritual is present in the Gṛhyasūtras and Dharmasūtras and &quot;Dharmaśāstras&quot;, as well as a couple of times in the &quot;Saṃhitās&quot;.

Educational courses or training has been referred to in the &quot;Chandogya Upaniṣad&quot; and in the &quot;Yājñavalkya Smṛti&quot;; Gharpure (1956) writes that during the Smṛti period, Upanayana may have attained a permanent fixture if the life of students to be as compared to being optional before.

In the &quot;Atharvaveda&quot;, and later in the Sutras period, the word &quot;Upanayana&quot; meant taking responsibility of a student, the beginning of an education, a student&#x27;s initiation into &quot;studentship&quot; and the acceptance of the student by the teacher. Preceptors could include a guru, ācharya, upādhyāya, and ṛtvik.

Gradually, new layers of meaning emerged, such as the inclusion of goddess Sarasvatī or Sāvitrī, with the teacher becoming the enabler of the connection between this goddess and the student. The meaning was extended to include Vedāngas and vows among other things.

The education of a student was not limited to ritual and philosophical speculations found in the &quot;Vedas&quot; and the &quot;Upaniṣads&quot;. It extended to many arts and crafts, which had their own, similar rites of passages. The &quot;Aitareya Brāhmaṇa, Āgamas,&quot; and &quot;Purāṇas&quot; genres of literature in Hinduism describe these as &quot;Śilpa Śāstras&quot;. They extend to all practical aspects of culture, such as the sculptor, the potter, the perfumer, the wheelwright, the painter, the weaver, the architect, the dancer, and the musician. The training of these began from childhood and included studies about dharma, culture, reading, writing, mathematics, geometry, colours, tools, as well as traditions and trade secrets. The rites of passage during apprentice education varied in the respective guilds. Suśruta and Charaka developed the initiation ceremony for students of Āyurveda. The &quot;Upanayana&quot; rite of passage was also important to the teacher, as the student would therefrom begin to live in the &quot;gurukula&quot; (school).

Upanayana became an elaborate ceremony, that includes rituals involving the family, the child and the teacher. A boy receives during this ceremony a sacred thread called the &quot;yajnopavita&quot; to be worn. The &quot;yajnopavita&quot; ceremony announces that the child had entered into formal education. In the modern era, the Upanayana rite of passage is open to anyone at any age. The Upanayana follows the Vidyārambhaṃ, the previous rite of passage. Vidyārambhaṃ became an intermediary samskāra following the evolution in writing and language. Vidyārambhaṃ now marked the beginning of primary education or literacy while Upanayana went on to refer to spiritual education. The Upanayana can also take place at the student&#x27;s home for those who are home-schooled. Ceremonial bhikṣa as one of the rituals during Upanayana became important, attaining sizeable proportions. The actual initiation occurred during the recitation of the Gāyatrī Mantra. The spiritual birth would take place four days after the initial Upanayana rituals. It was then that the last ritual was performed, the Medhajanana. The Samavartanam or convocation ritual marked the end of the course. The Upanayana became a permanent feature around the Upaniṣad period.

Attire includes a daṇḍa or staff and a mekhala or girdle.

=== Age and varna ===

In Hindu traditions, a human being is born at least twice—once at physical birth and second at intellectual birth through teacher&#x27;s care. The first is marked through the &quot;Jatakarman&quot; rite of passage; the second is marked through &quot;Upanayanam&quot; or &quot;Vidyārambha&quot; rites of passage. A sacred thread was given by the teacher during the initiation to school ceremony and was a symbolic reminder to the student of his purpose at school as well as a social marker of the student as someone who was born a second time (&quot;dvija&quot;, twice born).

Many medieval era texts discuss Upanayana in the context of three of the four &quot;varnas&quot; (caste, class) — Brāhmaṇas, Kṣatriyas and Vaiśyas. The ceremony was typically performed at age eight among the Brāhmaṇas, at age 11 among the Kṣatriyas, and age 12 among Vaiśyas. &quot;Apastamba Gryha Sutra&quot; (verse 1.1.1.27) places a maximum age limit of 24 for the Upanayana ceremony and start of formal education. However, &quot;Gautama Gṛyha Sūtra&quot; and other ancient texts state that there is no age restriction and anyone of any age can undertake Upanayanam when they initiate their formal studies of the Vedas.

Several texts such as &quot;Suśruta Sūtrasthāna&quot;, however, also include the fourth varna, the Śūdras, entering schools and the formal education process, stating that the Upanayana rite of passage was open to everyone.

The large variation in age and changes to it over time was to accommodate for the diversity in society and between families.

Vedic period texts such as the Baudhāyana &quot;Gṛhyasūtra&quot; encouraged the three Varṇas of society to undergo the Upanayana.

===Gender and women===

In some regions, in modern times, some girls undergo Upanayana rite of passage. In ancient and medieval eras, texts such as Harita Dharmasūtras, Aśvālayana Gṛhya Sutra and Yama smrṛti suggest women could begin Vedic studies after Upanayana.

Girls who decided to become a student underwent the Upanayana rite of passage, at the age of 8, and thereafter were called &quot;Brahmavadinī&quot;. They wore a thread or upper garment over their left shoulder. Those girls who chose not to go to a &quot;gurukula&quot; were called &quot;Sadyovadhu&quot; (literally, one who marries straight). However, the &quot;Sadyovadhu&quot;, too, underwent a step during the wedding rituals, where she would complete Upanayana, and thereafter wear her upper garment (saree) over her left shoulder. This interim symbolic Upanayana rite of passage for a girl, before her wedding, is described in multiple texts such as the Gobhila Gṛhya Sūtra (verse 2.1.19) and some Dharmasutras.

=== &quot;Yajnopavita&quot; ===
The sacred thread or the yajnopavita has become one of the most important parts of contemporary Upanayana ceremonies. There are accordingly a number of rules related to it. The thread is composed of three cotton strands of nine strands each. The strands symbolise different things in their regions. For example, among Tamils, each strand is for each of the Tridevī, the supreme trinity of the Hindu goddesses Sarasvatī, Lakṣmī, and Pārvatī. According to another tradition, each of the nine threads represents a male deity, such as Agni, Bhaga, and Chandra.

The predecessor to the sacred thread was an upper garment (such as a dupatta or an uparane). However, as traditions developed, the upper garment began to be worn continuously. The usage of a thread grew out of convenience and manageability, becoming more popular than alternatives such as a kusa rope.

The ancient Saṁskṛta texts offer a diverse view while describing the yajñopavītam or upavita. The term upavita was originally meant to be any upper garment, as stated in Apastamba Dharmasūtra (verse 2.2.4.22–2.2.4.23) or, if the wearer does not want to wear a top, a thread would suffice. The ancient Indian scholar Haradatta states, &quot;&quot;yajñopavītam&quot; means a particular mode of wearing the upper garment, and it is not necessary to have the yajñopavīta at all times&quot;.

There is no mention of any rule or custom, states Patrick Olivelle, that &quot;required Brāhmaṇas to wear a sacred string at all times&quot;, in the Brāhmaṇya literature (Vedic and ancient post-Vedic). Yajñopavīta, textual evidence suggests, is a medieval and modern tradition. However, the term &quot;yajnopavita&quot; appears in ancient Hindu literature, and therein it means a way of wearing the upper garment during a ritual or rites of passage. The custom of wearing a string is a late development in Hinduism, was optional in the medieval era, and the ancient Indian texts do not mention this ritual for any class or for &quot;Upanayana&quot;.

The Gobhila Gṛhya Sutra (verse 1.2.1) similarly states in its discussion on Upanayana, that &quot;the student understands the yajnopavita as a cord of threads, or a garment, or a rope of kusa grass&quot;, and it is its methods of wearing and the significance that matters. The proper manner of wearing the upper garment or thread, state the ancient texts, is from over the left shoulder and under the right arm. &quot;yajñopavīta&quot; contrasts with &quot;Pracinavīta&quot; method of wearing the upper garment, the latter a reverse and mirror image of former, and suggested to signify rituals for elders/ancestors (for example, funeral).

The idea of wearing the upper garment or sacred thread, and its significance, extended to women. This is reflected in the traditional wearing of sari over the left shoulder, during formal occasions and the celebration of rites of passage such as Hindu weddings. It was also the norm if a girl undertakes the Upanayana ceremony and begins her Vedic studies as a &quot;Brahmavadinī&quot;.

The sacred Yajnopavita is known by many names (varying by region and community), such as &quot;Bratabandha, Janivaara&quot;, &quot; Jaanva&quot;, &quot;Jandhyam&quot;, &quot;Poita&quot;, &quot;Pūṇūl&quot;, &quot;Janeu&quot;, &quot;Lagun&quot;, &quot;Yajnopavita&quot;, &quot;Yagyopavit&quot;, &quot;Yonya&quot; and &quot;Zunnar&quot;.

==Scholarly commentary==

=== Doubts about Upanayanam in old texts ===
Scholars state that the details and restrictions in the Upanayana ceremony is likely to have been inserted into ancient texts in a more modern era. Hermann Oldenberg, for example, states that Upanayana — the solemn reception of the pupil by the teacher to teach him the Veda — is joined into texts of Vedic texts at places that simply do not make any contextual sense, do not match the style, and are likely to be a corruption of the ancient texts. For example, in Satapatha Brahmana, the &quot;Upanayana&quot; rite of passage text appears in the middle of a dialogue about Agnihotra; after the Upanayana verse end, sage Saukeya abruptly returns to the Agnihotra and Uddalaka. Oldenberg states that the Upanayana discussion is likely an insertion into the older text.

Kane, in his &quot;History of Dharmasastra&quot; reviews, as well as other scholars, state that there is high likelihood of interpolation, insertion and corruption in dharma sutras and dharma sastra texts on the Upanayana-related rite of passage. Patrick Olivelle notes the doubts in postmodern scholarship about the presumed reliability of Manusmṛti manuscripts. He writes, &quot;Manusmriti was the first Indian legal text introduced to the western world through the translation of Sir William Jones in 1794&quot;. This was based on the Calcutta manuscript with the commentary of Kulluka, which has been assumed to be the reliable vulgate version, and translated repeatedly from Jones in 1794 to Doniger in 1991. The reliability of the Manusmṛti manuscript used since colonial times, states Olivelle, is &quot;far from the truth. Indeed, one of the great surprises of my editorial work has been to discover how few of the over fifty manuscripts that I collated actually follow the vulgate in key readings.&quot;

==Regional variations==

===Nepal===

In Nepal, a ceremony is held which combines &quot;choodakarma&quot; (tonsure, shave the head) and Upanayana saṃskāra locally known as &quot;Bratabandha&quot; (Sanskrit &quot;vrata&quot; = promise, &quot;bandhana&quot; = bond). In Nepal, The one who wears the sacred thread are called as Tagadhari.

This Sanskara involves the participation of entire family and a teacher who then accepts the boy as a disciple in the Guru–shishya tradition of Hinduism. Gayatri Mantra marks as an individual&#x27;s entrance to a school of Hinduism. This ceremony ends after the boy goes for his first alms round to relatives and leave for the guru&#x27;s ashram. Traditionally, these boys were sent to learn in a gurukula system of education but in modern times, this act is only done symbolically.

<text>In neuroscience, long-term potentiation (LTP) is a persistent strengthening of synapses based on recent patterns of activity. These are patterns of synaptic activity that produce a long-lasting increase in signal transmission between two neurons. The opposite of LTP is long-term depression, which produces a long-lasting decrease in synaptic strength.

It is one of several phenomena underlying synaptic plasticity, the ability of chemical synapses to change their strength. As memories are thought to be encoded by modification of synaptic strength, LTP is widely considered one of the major cellular mechanisms that underlies learning and memory.

LTP was discovered in the rabbit hippocampus by Terje Lømo in 1966 and has remained a popular subject of research since. Many modern LTP studies seek to better understand its basic biology, while others aim to draw a causal link between LTP and behavioral learning. Still, others try to develop methods, pharmacologic or otherwise, of enhancing LTP to improve learning and memory. LTP is also a subject of clinical research, for example, in the areas of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and addiction medicine.

==History==

===Early theories of learning===
At the end of the 19th century, scientists generally recognized that the number of neurons in the adult brain (roughly 100 billion) did not increase significantly with age, giving neurobiologists good reason to believe that memories were generally not the result of new neuron production. With this realization came the need to explain how memories could form in the absence of new neurons.

The Spanish neuroanatomist Santiago Ramón y Cajal was among the first to suggest a mechanism of learning that did not require the formation of new neurons. In his 1894 Croonian Lecture, he proposed that memories might instead be formed by strengthening the connections between existing neurons to improve the effectiveness of their communication. Hebbian theory, introduced by Donald Hebb in 1949, echoed Ramón y Cajal&#x27;s ideas, further proposing that cells may grow new connections or undergo metabolic and synaptic changes that enhance their ability to communicate and create a neural network of experiences:

Eric Kandel (1964) and associates were some of the first researchers to discover long-term potentiation during their work with sea slug Aplysia. They attempted to apply behavioral conditioning to different cells in the slug’s neural network. Their results showed synaptic strength changes and researchers suggested that this may be due to a basic form of learning occurring within the slug.

Though these theories of memory formation are now well established, they were farsighted for their time: late 19th and early 20th century neuroscientists and psychologists were not equipped with the neurophysiological techniques necessary for elucidating the biological underpinnings of learning in animals. These skills would not come until the later half of the 20th century, at about the same time as the discovery of long-term potentiation.

===Discovery===
LTP was first observed by Terje Lømo in 1966 in the Oslo, Norway, laboratory of Per Andersen. There, Lømo conducted a series of neurophysiological experiments on anesthetized rabbits to explore the role of the hippocampus in short-term memory.

Lømo&#x27;s experiments focused on connections, or synapses, from the perforant pathway to the dentate gyrus. These experiments were carried out by stimulating presynaptic fibers of the perforant pathway and recording responses from a collection of postsynaptic cells of the dentate gyrus. As expected, a single pulse of electrical stimulation to fibers of the perforant pathway caused excitatory postsynaptic potentials (EPSPs) in cells of the dentate gyrus. What Lømo unexpectedly observed was that the postsynaptic cells&#x27; response to these single-pulse stimuli could be enhanced for a long period of time if he first delivered a high-frequency train of stimuli to the presynaptic fibers. When such a train of stimuli was applied, subsequent single-pulse stimuli elicited stronger, prolonged EPSPs in the postsynaptic cell population. This phenomenon, whereby a high-frequency stimulus could produce a long-lived enhancement in the postsynaptic cells&#x27; response to subsequent single-pulse stimuli, was initially called &quot;long-lasting potentiation&quot;.

Timothy Bliss, who joined the Andersen laboratory in 1968, collaborated with Lømo and in 1973 the two published the first characterization of long-lasting potentiation in the rabbit hippocampus. Bliss and Tony Gardner-Medwin published a similar report of long-lasting potentiation in the awake animal which appeared in the same issue as the Bliss and Lømo report. In 1975, Douglas and Goddard proposed &quot;long-term potentiation&quot; as a new name for the phenomenon of long-lasting potentiation. Andersen suggested that the authors chose &quot;long-term potentiation&quot; perhaps because of its easily pronounced acronym, &quot;LTP&quot;.

===Models and theory===


The physical and biological mechanism of LTP is still not understood, but some successful models have been developed. Studies of dendritic spines, protruding structures on dendrites that physically grow and retract over the course of minutes or hours, have suggested a relationship between the electrical resistance of the spine and the effective synapse strength, due to their relationship with intracellular calcium transients. Mathematical models such as BCM Theory, which depends also on intracellular calcium in relation to NMDA receptor voltage gates, have been developed since the 1980s and modify the traditional &quot;a priori&quot; Hebbian learning model with both biological and experimental justification. Still, others have proposed re-arranging or synchronizing the relationship between receptor regulation, LTP, and synaptic strength.

==Types==
Since its original discovery in the rabbit hippocampus, LTP has been observed in a variety of other neural structures, including the cerebral cortex, cerebellum, amygdala, and many others. Robert Malenka, a prominent LTP researcher, has suggested that LTP may even occur at all excitatory synapses in the mammalian brain.

Different areas of the brain exhibit different forms of LTP. The specific type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends on a number of factors. One such factor is the age of the organism when LTP is observed. For example, the molecular mechanisms of LTP in the immature hippocampus differ from those mechanisms that underlie LTP of the adult hippocampus. The signalling pathways used by a particular cell also contribute to the specific type of LTP present. For example, some types of hippocampal LTP depend on the NMDA receptor, others may depend upon the metabotropic glutamate receptor (mGluR), while still others depend upon another molecule altogether. The variety of signaling pathways that contribute to LTP and the wide distribution of these various pathways in the brain are reasons that the type of LTP exhibited between neurons depends only in part upon the anatomic location in which LTP is observed. For example, LTP in the Schaffer collateral pathway of the hippocampus is NMDA receptor-dependent - this was proved by the application of AP5, an antagonist to the NMDA receptor, which prevented LTP in this pathway. Conversely, LTP in the mossy fiber pathway is NMDA receptor-independent, even though both pathways are in the hippocampus.

The pre- and postsynaptic activity required to induce LTP are other criteria by which LTP is classified. Broadly, this allows classification of LTP into Hebbian, non-Hebbian, and anti-Hebbian mechanisms. Borrowing its name from Hebb&#x27;s postulate, summarized by the maxim that &quot;cells that fire together wire together,&quot; Hebbian LTP requires simultaneous pre- and postsynaptic depolarization for its induction. Non-Hebbian LTP is a type of LTP that does not require such simultaneous depolarization of pre- and postsynaptic cells; an example of this occurs in the mossy fiber hippocampal pathway. A special case of non-Hebbian LTP, anti-Hebbian LTP explicitly requires simultaneous presynaptic depolarization and relative postsynaptic hyperpolarization for its induction.

Owing to its predictable organization and readily inducible LTP, the CA1 hippocampus has become the prototypical site of mammalian LTP study. In particular, NMDA receptor-dependent LTP in the adult CA1 hippocampus is the most widely studied type of LTP, and is therefore, the focus of this article.

==Properties==
NMDA receptor-dependent LTP exhibits several properties, including input specificity, associativity, cooperativity, and persistence.

; Input specificity
: Once induced, LTP at one synapse does not spread to other synapses; rather LTP is &quot;input specific&quot;. Long-term potentiation is only propagated to those synapses according to the rules of associativity and cooperativity. However, the input specificity of LTP may be incomplete at short distances. One model to explain the input specificity of LTP was presented by Frey and Morris in 1997 and is called the synaptic tagging and capture hypothesis.

; Associativity
: &quot;Associativity&quot; refers to the observation that when weak stimulation of a single pathway is insufficient for the induction of LTP, simultaneous strong stimulation of another pathway will induce LTP at both pathways.

; Cooperativity
: LTP can be induced either by strong tetanic stimulation of a single pathway to a synapse, or &quot;cooperatively&quot; via the weaker stimulation of many. When one pathway into a synapse is stimulated weakly, it produces insufficient postsynaptic depolarization to induce LTP. In contrast, when weak stimuli are applied to many pathways that converge on a single patch of postsynaptic membrane, the individual postsynaptic depolarizations generated may collectively depolarize the postsynaptic cell enough to induce LTP cooperatively. Synaptic tagging, discussed later, may be a common mechanism underlying associativity and cooperativity. Bruce McNaughton argues that any difference between associativity and cooperativity is strictly semantic. Experiments performed by stimulating an array of individual dendritic spines, have shown that synaptic cooperativity by as few as two adjacent dendritic spines prevents long term depression (LTD) allowing only LTP.

; Persistence
: LTP is &quot;persistent&quot;, lasting from several minutes to many months, and it is this persistence that separates LTP from other forms of synaptic plasticity.

===Early phase===

====Maintenance====
While induction entails the &quot;transient&quot; activation of CaMKII and PKC, maintenance of E-LTP (early-form LTP) is characterized by their &quot;persistent&quot; activation. During this stage PKMzeta (PKMζ) which does not have dependence on calcium, become autonomously active. Consequently, they are able to carry out the phosphorylation events that underlie E-LTP expression.

====Expression====
Phosphorylation is a chemical reaction in which a small phosphate group is added to another molecule to change that molecule&#x27;s activity. Autonomously active CaMKII and PKC use phosphorylation to carry out the two major mechanisms underlying the expression of E-LTP. First, and most importantly, they phosphorylate existing AMPA receptors to increase their activity. Second, they mediate or modulate the insertion of additional AMPA receptors into the postsynaptic membrane. Importantly, the delivery of AMPA receptors to the synapse during E-LTP is independent of protein synthesis. This is achieved by having a nonsynaptic pool of AMPA receptors adjacent to the postsynaptic membrane. When the appropriate LTP-inducing stimulus arrives, nonsynaptic AMPA receptors are rapidly trafficked into the postsynaptic membrane under the influence of protein kinases. As mentioned previously, AMPA receptors are the brain&#x27;s most abundant glutamate receptors and mediate the majority of its excitatory activity. By increasing the efficiency and number of AMPA receptors at the synapse, future excitatory stimuli generate larger postsynaptic responses.

While the above model of E-LTP describes entirely postsynaptic mechanisms for induction, maintenance, and expression, an additional component of expression may occur presynaptically. One hypothesis of this presynaptic facilitation is that persistent CaMKII activity in the postsynaptic cell during E-LTP may lead to the synthesis of a &quot;retrograde messenger&quot;, discussed later. According to this hypothesis, the newly synthesized messenger travels across the synaptic cleft from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell, leading to a chain of events that facilitate the presynaptic response to subsequent stimuli. Such events may include an increase in neurotransmitter vesicle number, probability of vesicle release, or both. In addition to the retrograde messenger underlying presynaptic expression in early LTP, the retrograde messenger may also play a role in the expression of late LTP.

===Late phase===
Late LTP (L-LTP) is the natural extension of E-LTP. Unlike E-LTP, which is independent of protein synthesis, L-LTP requires gene transcription and protein synthesis in the postsynaptic cell. Two phases of L-LTP exist: the first depends upon protein synthesis, while the second depends upon both gene transcription and protein synthesis. These phases are occasionally called LTP2 and LTP3, respectively, with E-LTP referred to as LTP1 under this nomenclature.

====Induction====
Late LTP is induced by changes in gene expression and protein synthesis brought about by the persistent activation of protein kinases activated during E-LTP, such as MAPK. In fact, MAPK—specifically the extracellular signal-regulated kinase (ERK) subfamily of MAPKs—may be the molecular link between E-LTP and L-LTP, since many signaling cascades involved in E-LTP, including CaMKII and PKC, can converge on ERK. Recent research has shown that the induction of L-LTP can depend on coincident molecular events, namely PKA activation and calcium influx, that converge on CRTC1 (TORC1), a potent transcriptional coactivator for cAMP response element binding protein (CREB). This requirement for a molecular coincidence accounts perfectly for the associative nature of LTP, and, presumably, for that of learning.

====Maintenance====
Upon activation, ERK may phosphorylate a number of cytoplasmic and nuclear molecules that ultimately result in the protein synthesis and morphological changes observed in L-LTP. These cytoplasmic and nuclear molecules may include transcription factors such as CREB. ERK-mediated changes in transcription factor activity may trigger the synthesis of proteins that underlie the maintenance of L-LTP. One such molecule may be protein kinase Mζ (PKMζ), a persistently active kinase whose synthesis increases following LTP induction. PKMζ is an atypical isoform of PKC that lacks a regulatory subunit and thus remains constitutively active. Unlike other kinases that mediate LTP, PKMζ is active not just in the first 30 minutes following LTP induction; rather, PKMζ becomes a requirement for LTP maintenance only during the late phase of LTP. PKMζ thus appears important for the persistence of memory and would be expected to be important in the maintenance of long-term memory. Indeed, administration of a PKMζ inhibitor into the hippocampus of the rat results in retrograde amnesia with intact short-term memory; PKMζ does not play a role in the establishment of short-term memory. PKMζ has recently been shown to underlie L-LTP maintenance by directing the trafficking and reorganization of proteins in the synaptic scaffolding that underlie the expression of L-LTP. Even more recently, transgenic mice lacking PKMζ demonstrate normal LTP, questioning the necessity of PKMζ.

The long-term stabilization of synaptic changes is also determined by a parallel increase of pre- and postsynaptic structures such as axonal bouton, dendritic spine and postsynaptic density.
On the molecular level, an increase of the postsynaptic scaffolding proteins PSD-95 and Homer1c has been shown to correlate with the stabilization of synaptic enlargement.

====Expression====
The identities of only a few proteins synthesized during L-LTP are known. Regardless of their identities, it is thought that they contribute to the increase in dendritic spine number, surface area, and postsynaptic sensitivity to neurotransmitter associated with L-LTP expression. The latter may be brought about in part by the enhanced synthesis of AMPA receptors during L-LTP. Late LTP is also associated with the presynaptic synthesis of synaptotagmin and an increase in synaptic vesicle number, suggesting that L-LTP induces protein synthesis not only in postsynaptic cells, but in presynaptic cells as well. As mentioned previously, for postsynaptic LTP induction to result in presynaptic protein synthesis, there must be communication from the postsynaptic to the presynaptic cell. This may occur via the synthesis of a retrograde messenger, discussed later.

Even in studies restricted to postsynaptic events, investigators have not determined the location of the protein synthesis that underlies L-LTP. Specifically, it is unclear whether protein synthesis takes place in the postsynaptic cell body or in its dendrites. Despite having observed ribosomes (the major components of the protein synthesis machinery) in dendrites as early as the 1960s, prevailing wisdom was that the cell body was the predominant site of protein synthesis in neurons. This reasoning was not seriously challenged until the 1980s, when investigators reported observing protein synthesis in dendrites whose connection to their cell body had been severed. More recently, investigators have demonstrated that this type of local protein synthesis is necessary for some types of LTP.

One reason for the popularity of the local protein synthesis hypothesis is that it provides a possible mechanism for the specificity associated with LTP. Specifically, if indeed local protein synthesis underlies L-LTP, only dendritic spines receiving LTP-inducing stimuli will undergo LTP; the potentiation will not be propagated to adjacent synapses. By contrast, global protein synthesis that occurs in the cell body requires that proteins be shipped out to every area of the cell, including synapses that have not received LTP-inducing stimuli. Whereas local protein synthesis provides a mechanism for specificity, global protein synthesis would seem to directly compromise it. However, as discussed later, the synaptic tagging hypothesis successfully reconciles global protein synthesis, synapse specificity, and associativity.

===Retrograde signaling===
Retrograde signaling is a hypothesis that attempts to explain that, while LTP is induced and expressed postsynaptically, some evidence suggests that it is expressed presynaptically as well. The hypothesis gets its name because normal synaptic transmission is directional and proceeds from the presynaptic to the postsynaptic cell. For induction to occur postsynaptically and be partially expressed presynaptically, a message must travel from the postsynaptic cell to the presynaptic cell in a &quot;retrograde&quot; (reverse) direction. Once there, the message presumably initiates a cascade of events that leads to a presynaptic component of expression, such as the increased probability of neurotransmitter vesicle release.

Retrograde signaling is currently a contentious subject as some investigators do not believe the presynaptic cell contributes at all to the expression of LTP. Even among proponents of the hypothesis there is controversy over the identity of the messenger. Early thoughts focused on nitric oxide, while most recent evidence points to cell adhesion proteins.

===Synaptic tagging===
Before the local protein synthesis hypothesis gained significant support, there was general agreement that the protein synthesis underlying L-LTP occurred in the cell body. Further, there was thought that the products of this synthesis were shipped cell-wide in a nonspecific manner. It thus became necessary to explain how protein synthesis could occur in the cell body without compromising LTP&#x27;s input specificity. The synaptic tagging hypothesis attempts to solve the cell&#x27;s difficult problem of synthesizing proteins in the cell body but ensuring they only reach synapses that have received LTP-inducing stimuli.

The synaptic tagging hypothesis proposes that a &quot;synaptic tag&quot; is synthesized at synapses that have received LTP-inducing stimuli, and that this synaptic tag may serve to capture plasticity-related proteins shipped cell-wide from the cell body. Studies of LTP in the marine snail &quot;Aplysia californica&quot; have implicated synaptic tagging as a mechanism for the input-specificity of LTP. There is some evidence that given two widely separated synapses, an LTP-inducing stimulus at one synapse drives several signaling cascades (described previously) that initiates gene expression in the cell nucleus. At the same synapse (but not the unstimulated synapse), local protein synthesis creates a short-lived (less than three hours) synaptic tag. The products of gene expression are shipped globally throughout the cell, but are only captured by synapses that express the synaptic tag. Thus only the synapse receiving LTP-inducing stimuli is potentiated, demonstrating LTP&#x27;s input specificity.

The synaptic tag hypothesis may also account for LTP&#x27;s associativity and cooperativity. Associativity (&quot;see Properties&quot;) is observed when one synapse is excited with LTP-inducing stimulation while a separate synapse is only weakly stimulated. Whereas one might expect only the strongly stimulated synapse to undergo LTP (since weak stimulation alone is insufficient to induce LTP at either synapse), &quot;both&quot; synapses will in fact undergo LTP. While weak stimuli are unable to induce protein synthesis in the cell body, they may prompt the synthesis of a synaptic tag. Simultaneous strong stimulation of a separate pathway, capable of inducing cell body protein synthesis, then may prompt the production of plasticity-related proteins, which are shipped cell-wide. With both synapses expressing the synaptic tag, both would capture the protein products resulting in the expression of LTP in both the strongly stimulated and weakly stimulated pathways.

Cooperativity is observed when two synapses are activated by weak stimuli incapable of inducing LTP when stimulated individually. But upon simultaneous weak stimulation, both synapses undergo LTP in a cooperative fashion. Synaptic tagging does not explain how multiple weak stimuli can result in a collective stimulus sufficient to induce LTP (this is explained by the postsynaptic summation of EPSPs described previously). Rather, synaptic tagging explains the ability of weakly stimulated synapses, none of which are capable of independently generating LTP, to receive the products of protein synthesis initiated collectively. As before, this may be accomplished through the synthesis of a local synaptic tag following weak synaptic stimulation.

===Modulation===
As described previously, the molecules that underlie LTP can be classified as mediators or modulators. A mediator of LTP is a molecule, such as the NMDA receptor or calcium, whose presence and activity is necessary for generating LTP under nearly all conditions. By contrast, a modulator is a molecule that can alter LTP but is not essential for its generation or expression.

In addition to the signaling pathways described above, hippocampal LTP may be altered by a variety of modulators. For example, the steroid hormone estradiol may enhance LTP by driving CREB phosphorylation and subsequent dendritic spine growth. Additionally, β-adrenergic receptor agonists such as norepinephrine may alter the protein synthesis-dependent late phase of LTP. Nitric oxide synthase activity may also result in the subsequent activation of guanylyl cyclase and PKG. Similarly, activation of dopamine receptors may enhance LTP through the cAMP/PKA signaling pathway.

==Relationship to behavioral memory==
While the long-term potentiation of synapses in cell culture seems to provide an elegant substrate for learning and memory, the contribution of LTP to behavioral learning — that is, learning at the level of the whole organism — cannot simply be extrapolated from &quot;in vitro&quot; studies. For this reason, considerable effort has been dedicated to establishing whether LTP is a requirement for learning and memory in living animals. Because of this, LTP also plays a crucial role in fear processing.

===Spatial memory===
In 1986, Richard Morris provided some of the first evidence that LTP was indeed required for the formation of memories &quot;in vivo&quot;. He tested the spatial memory of rats by pharmacologically modifying their hippocampus, a brain structure whose role in spatial learning is well established. Rats were trained on the Morris water maze, a spatial memory task in which rats swim in a pool of murky water until they locate the platform hidden beneath its surface. During this exercise, normal rats are expected to associate the location of the hidden platform with salient cues placed at specific positions around the circumference of the maze. After training, one group of rats had their hippocampi bathed in the NMDA receptor blocker APV, while the other group served as the control. Both groups were then subjected to the water maze spatial memory task. Rats in the control group were able to locate the platform and escape from the pool, while the performance of APV-treated rats was significantly impaired. Moreover, when slices of the hippocampus were taken from both groups, LTP was easily induced in controls, but could not be induced in the brains of APV-treated rats. This provided early evidence that the NMDA receptor — and by extension, LTP — was required for at least some types of learning and memory.

Similarly, Susumu Tonegawa demonstrated in 1996 that the CA1 area of the hippocampus is crucial to the formation of spatial memories in living mice. So-called &quot;place cells&quot; located in this region become active only when the rat is in a particular location — called a &quot;place field&quot; — in the environment. Since these place fields are distributed throughout the environment, one interpretation is that groups of place cells form maps in the hippocampus. The accuracy of these maps determines how well a rat learns about its environment and thus how well it can navigate it. Tonegawa found that by impairing the NMDA receptor, specifically by genetically removing the NR1 subunit in the CA1 region, the place fields generated were substantially less specific than those of controls. That is, mice produced faulty spatial maps when their NMDA receptors were impaired. As expected, these mice performed very poorly on spatial tasks compared to controls, further supporting the role of LTP in spatial learning.

Enhanced NMDA receptor activity in the hippocampus has also been shown to produce enhanced LTP and an overall improvement in spatial learning. In 1999, Tang &quot;et al&quot;. produced a line of mice with enhanced NMDA receptor function by overexpressing the NR2B subunit in the hippocampus. The resulting smart mice, nicknamed &quot;Doogie mice&quot; after the fictional prodigious doctor Doogie Howser, had larger LTP and excelled at spatial learning tasks, reinforcing LTP&#x27;s importance in the formation of hippocampus-dependent memories.

===Inhibitory avoidance===
In 2006, Jonathan Whitlock and colleagues reported on a series of experiments that provided perhaps the strongest evidence of LTP&#x27;s role in behavioral memory, arguing that to conclude that LTP underlies behavioral learning, the two processes must both mimic and occlude one another. Employing an inhibitory avoidance learning paradigm, researchers trained rats in a two-chambered apparatus with light and dark chambers, the latter being fitted with a device that delivered a foot shock to the rat upon entry. An analysis of CA1 hippocampal synapses revealed that inhibitory avoidance training induced &quot;in vivo&quot; AMPA receptor phosphorylation of the same type as that seen in LTP &quot;in vitro&quot;; that is, inhibitory avoidance training mimicked LTP. In addition, synapses potentiated during training could not be further potentiated by experimental manipulations that would have otherwise induced LTP; that is, inhibitory avoidance training occluded LTP. In a response to the article, Timothy Bliss and colleagues remarked that these and related experiments &quot;substantially advance the case for LTP as a neural mechanism for memory.&quot;

==Clinical significance==
The role of LTP in disease is less clear than its role in basic mechanisms of synaptic plasticity. However, alterations in LTP may contribute to a number of neurological diseases, including depression, Parkinson&#x27;s disease, epilepsy, and neuropathic pain. Impaired LTP may also have a role in Alzheimer&#x27;s disease and drug addiction.

===Alzheimer&#x27;s disease===
LTP has received much attention among those who study Alzheimer&#x27;s disease (AD), a neurodegenerative disease that causes marked cognitive decline and dementia. Much of this deterioration occurs in association with degenerative changes in the hippocampus and other medial temporal lobe structures. Because of the hippocampus&#x27; well established role in LTP, some have suggested that the cognitive decline seen in individuals with AD may result from impaired LTP.

In a 2003 review of the literature, Rowan &quot;et al.&quot; proposed one model for how LTP might be affected in AD. AD appears to result, at least in part, from misprocessing of amyloid precursor protein (APP). The result of this abnormal processing is the accumulation of fragments of this protein, called amyloid β (Aβ). Aβ exists in both soluble and fibrillar forms. Misprocessing of APP results in the accumulation of soluble Aβ that, according to Rowan&#x27;s hypothesis, impairs hippocampal LTP and may lead to the cognitive decline seen early in AD.

AD may also impair LTP through mechanisms distinct from Aβ. For example, one study demonstrated that the enzyme PKMζ accumulates in neurofibrillary tangles, which are a pathologic marker of AD. PKMζ is an enzyme with critical importance in the maintenance of late LTP.

===Drug addiction===
Research in the field of addiction medicine has also recently turned its focus to LTP, owing to the hypothesis that drug addiction represents a powerful form of learning and memory. Addiction is a complex neurobehavioral phenomenon involving various parts of the brain, such as the ventral tegmental area (VTA) and nucleus accumbens (NAc). Studies have demonstrated that VTA and NAc synapses are capable of undergoing LTP and that this LTP may be responsible for the behaviors that characterize addiction.

<text>The dentate gyrus (DG) is one of the subfields of the hippocampus, in the hippocampal formation. The hippocampal formation is located in the temporal lobe of the brain, and includes the hippocampus (including CA1 to CA4) subfields, and other subfields including the dentate gyrus, subiculum, and presubiculum.

The dentate gyrus is part of the trisynaptic circuit, a neural circuit of the hippocampus, thought to contribute to the formation of new episodic memories, the spontaneous exploration of novel environments and other functions. The dentate gyrus has toothlike projections from which it is named.

The subgranular zone of the dentate gyrus is one of only two major sites of adult neurogenesis in the brain, and is found in many mammals. The other main site is the subventricular zone in the ventricular system. Other sites may include the striatum and the cerebellum. However, whether significant neurogenesis takes place in the adult human dentate gyrus has been a matter of debate.

==Structure==
The dentate gyrus, like the hippocampus, consists of three distinct layers: an outer molecular layer, a middle granule cell layer, and an inner polymorphic layer. The polymorphic layer is also the hilus of the dentate gyrus (originally named as CA4, the junction of the hippocampus and dentate gyrus). (In the hippocampus the outer layer is the molecular layer, the middle layer is the pyramidal layer, and the inner layer the stratum oriens.) 

The granule layer is between the overlying molecular layer and the underlying hilus (polymorphic layer).
The granule cells of the granule layer project their axons known as mossy fibers to make excitatory synapses on the dendrites of CA3 pyramidal neurons. The granule cells are tightly packed together in a laminated manner that dampens the excitability of neurons.

Some of the basal dendrites of the granule cells curve up into the molecular layer. Most basal dendrites enter the hilus. These hilar dendrites are shorter and thinner, and have fewer side branches.

A second excitatory cell type in the hilus is the mossy cell, which projects its axons widely along the septotemporal axis (running from the septal area to the temporal lobe) with the ipsilateral projection skipping the first 1–2 mm near the cell bodies, an unusual configuration, hypothesized to prepare a set of cell assemblies in CA3 for a data retrieval role, by randomizing their cell distribution.

Between the hilus and the granule cell layer is a region called the subgranular zone which is a site of adult neurogenesis.

The anteromedial continuation of the dentate gyrus is called the tail of the dentate gyrus, or the band of Giacomini. Most of the dentate gyrus is not exposed on the surface of the brain but the band of Giacomini is visible, and makes an important landmark of the inferior surface of the uncus.

===Trisynaptic circuit===
The trisynaptic circuit consists of excitatory cells (mostly stellate cells) in layer II of the entorhinal cortex, projecting to the granule cell layer of the dentate gyrus via the perforant path. The dentate gyrus receives no direct inputs from other cortical structures. The perforant path is divided into the medial and lateral perforant paths, generated, respectively, at the medial and lateral portions of the entorhinal cortex. The medial perforant path synapses onto the proximal dendritic area of the granule cells, whereas the lateral perforant path does so onto their distal dendrites. Most lateral views of the dentate gyrus may appear to suggest a structure consisting of just one entity, but medial movement may provide evidence of the ventral and dorsal parts of the dentate gyrus. The axons of the granule cells, called mossy fibres, make excitatory synaptic connections with the pyramidal cells of CA3 and CA1.

==Development==
The granule cells in the dentate gyrus are distinguished by their late time of formation during brain development. In rats, approximately 85% of the granule cells are generated after birth. In humans, it is estimated that granule cells begin to be generated during gestation weeks 10.5 to 11, and continue being generated during the second and third trimesters, after birth and all the way into adulthood. The germinal sources of granule cells and their migration pathways have been studied during rat brain development. The oldest granule cells are generated in a specific region of the hippocampal neuroepithelium and migrate into the primordial dentate gyrus around embryonic days (E) 17/18, and then settle as the outermost cells in the forming granular layer. Next, dentate precursor cells move out of this same area of the hippocampal neuroepithelium and, retaining their mitotic capacity, invade the hilus (core) of the forming dentate gyrus. This dispersed germinal matrix is the source of granule cells from that point on. The newly generated granule cells accumulate under the older cells that began to settle in the granular layer. As more granule cells are produced, the layer thickens and the cells are stacked up according to age—the oldest being the most superficial and the youngest being deeper. The granule cell precursors remain in a subgranular zone that becomes progressively thinner as the dentate gyrus grows, but these precursor cells are retained in adult rats. These sparsely scattered cells constantly generate granule cell neurons, which add to the total population. There are a variety of other differences in the rat, monkey and human dentate gyrus. The granule cells only have apical dendrites in the rat. But in the monkey and human, many granule cells also have basal dendrites.

==Function==


The dentate gyrus is thought to contribute to the formation of memories, and to play a role in depression.

The role of the hippocampus in learning and memory has been studied for many decades particularly since the late 1950s, following the results of surgery, in an American male, to remove most of the hippocampus. It remains unclear how the hippocampus enables new memory formation, but one process, called long term potentiation (LTP), occurs in this brain region. LTP involves long-lasting strengthening of synaptic connections after repeated stimulation. While the dentate gyrus shows LTP, it is also one of the few regions of the mammalian brain where adult neurogenesis (the formation of new neurons) takes place. Some studies hypothesize that new memories could preferentially use newly formed granule cells of the dentate gyrus, providing a potential mechanism for distinguishing multiple instances of similar events or multiple visits to the same location. Correspondingly, it has been proposed that the immature, newborn granule cells are receptive to form new synaptic connections with the axons arriving from the layer II of the entorhinal cortex, this way a particular new constellation of events is remembered as an episodic memory by first associating the events in the young granule cells that have the appropriate, permissive age. This concept is reinforced by the fact that increased neurogenesis is associated with improved spatial memory in rodents, as seen through performance in a maze.

The dentate gyrus is known to serve as a pre-processing unit. While the CA3 subfield is involved in encoding, storage, and retrieval of memory, the dentate gyrus is important in pattern separation. When information enters via the perforant path, the dentate gyrus separates very similar information into distinct and unique details. This ensures that new memories are encoded separately without input from previously stored memories of similar feature, and prepares the relevant data for storage in the CA3 region. Pattern separation gives the ability to differentiate one memory from other stored memories. Pattern separation begins in the dentate gyrus. Granule cells in the dentate gyrus process sensory information using competitive learning, and relay a preliminary representation to form place fields. Place fields are extremely specific, as they are capable of remapping and adjusting firing rates in response to subtle sensory signal changes. This specificity is critical for pattern separation, as it distinguishes memories from one another.

The dentate gyrus shows a specific form of neural plasticity resulting from the ongoing integration of newly formed excitatory granule cells.

==Clinical significance==
===Memory===
One of the most prominent early cases of anterograde amnesia (inability to form new memories) linking the hippocampus to memory formation was the case of Henry Molaison (anonymously known as Patient H.M. until his death in 2008). His epilepsy was treated with surgical removal of the hippocampus from both hemispheres, as well as some surrounding tissue. This targeted brain tissue removal left Mr. Molaison with an inability to form new memories, and the hippocampus has been thought critical to memory formation since that time, though the processes involved are unclear.

===Stress and depression===
The dentate gyrus may also have a functional role in stress and depression. For instance, in the rat, neurogenesis has been found to increase in response to chronic treatment with antidepressants. The physiological effects of stress, often characterized by release of glucocorticoids such as cortisol, as well as activation of the sympathetic nervous system (a division of the autonomic nervous system), have been shown to inhibit the process of neurogenesis in primates. Both endogenous and exogenous glucocorticoids are known to cause psychosis and depression, implying that neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus may play an important role in modulating symptoms of stress and depression.

===Blood sugar===
Studies by researchers at Columbia University Medical Center indicate that poor glucose control can lead to deleterious effects on the dentate gyrus, resulting in memory decline.

===Other===
Some evidence seen in the mouse suggests that neurogenesis in the dentate gyrus increases in response to aerobic exercise. Several experiments have shown neurogenesis (the development of nerve tissues) often increases in the dentate gyrus of adult rodents when they are exposed to an enriched environment.

===Spatial behavior===
Studies have shown that after having about 90% of their dentate gyrus cells destroyed, rats had extreme difficulty in maneuvering through a maze they had previously navigated. When being tested a number of times to see whether they could learn a maze, the results showed that the rats did not improve at all, indicating that their working memories were severely impaired. Rats had trouble with place strategies because they could not consolidate learned information about a maze into their working memory, and, thus, could not remember it when maneuvering through the same maze in a later trial. Every time a rat entered the maze, the rat behaved as if it was seeing the maze for the first time.

===DNA double-strand breaks===

Exploration of a novel environment, a natural behavior of young and adult wild-type mice, causes double-strand breaks (DSBs) in their neurons. DSBs occur in multiple brain regions and are most frequent in the dentate gyrus which is involved in learning and memory. These breaks are transient, and are repaired within 24 hours.

<text>The Zoological Society of London (ZSL) is a charity devoted to the worldwide conservation of animals and their habitats. It was founded in 1826. Since 1828, it has maintained London Zoo, and since 1931 Whipsnade Zoo.

==History==


On 29 November 1822, the birthday of John Ray, &quot;the father of modern zoology&quot;, a meeting held in the Linnean Society in Soho Square led by Rev. William Kirby, resolved to form a &quot;Zoological Club of the Linnean Society of London&quot;. Between 1816 and 1826, discussions between Stamford Raffles, Humphry Davy, Joseph Banks and others led to the idea that London should have an establishment similar to the Jardin des Plantes in Paris. It would house a zoological collection &quot;which should interest and amuse the public.&quot;


The society was founded in April 1826 by Sir Stamford Raffles, the Marquess of Lansdowne, Lord Auckland, Sir Humphry Davy, Robert Peel, Joseph Sabine, Nicholas Aylward Vigors along with various other nobility, clergy, and naturalists. Raffles was the first chairman and president, but died after only a few months in office, in July 1826. He was succeeded by the Marquess of Lansdowne who supervised the building of the first animal houses, a parcel of land in Regent&#x27;s Park having already been obtained from the Crown at the inaugural meeting. It received a royal charter from George IV on 27 March 1829.

The purpose of the society was to create a collection of animals for study at leisure, an associated museum and library. In April 1828, the Zoological Gardens were opened to members. In 1831 William IV presented the Royal Menagerie to the Zoological Society, and in 1847 the public was admitted to aid funding, and Londoners soon christened the Zoological Gardens the &quot;Zoo&quot;. London Zoo soon had the most extensive collection of animals in the world.

&quot;A History of the ZSL&quot;, written by Henry Scherren (FZS), was published in 1905. The History was criticised as inadequately researched by Peter Chalmers Mitchell in 1929; both histories were labelled inaccurate by John Bastin in 1970.

As the twentieth century began, the need to maintain and research large animals in a more natural environment became clear. Peter Chalmers Mitchell (ZSL Secretary 1903–35) conceived the vision of a new park no more than away from London and thus accessible to the public, and at least in extent. In 1926, profiting from the agricultural depression, the ideal place was found: Hall Farm, near Whipsnade village, was derelict, and held almost on the Chiltern Hills. ZSL bought the farm in December 1926 for £13,480 12s 10d. In 1928 the first animals arrived at the new Whipsnade Park—two Amherst pheasants, a golden pheasant and five red jungle fowl. Others soon followed, including muntjac deer, llamas, wombats and skunks. In 1931 Whipsnade Park was opened to the public as the world&#x27;s first open zoological park.

In 1960–61, Lord Zuckerman, then Secretary of ZSL, raised funds from two medical foundations to found laboratories as an Institute of Zoology where scientists would be employed by ZSL and undertake research.

The Society is a registered charity under English law.

===Leases from the Crown Estate===

Under the Crown Estate Act 1961, the ZSL had a maximum lease length of 60 years from the Crown Estate, but this was changed to 150 years by the (c. 20).

==The Institute of Zoology==

The Institute of Zoology is the scientific research division of the ZSL. It is a government-funded research institute, which specialises in scientific issues relevant to the conservation of species and their habitats. The Institute of Zoology focuses its research on five areas: evolutionary biology, genetics, ecology, reproductive biology and wildlife epidemiology. The Institute of Zoology was graded 4 in the 1997–2001 UK Research Assessment Exercise, and publishes reports annually. From the late 1980s the Institute of Zoology had been affiliated to the University of London. However, in 2000 this was replaced with a partnership with the University of Cambridge.

==Zoos and publications==
ZSL runs London Zoo, Whipsnade Zoo and had planned to open an aquarium, Biota!. The society published the &quot;Zoological Record&quot; (&quot;ZR&quot;) from 1864 to 1980, when the &quot;ZR&quot; was transferred to BIOSIS. The Society has published the &quot;Proceedings of the Zoological Society of London&quot;, now called the &quot;Journal of Zoology&quot;, since 1830. Since 1998 it has also published &quot;Animal Conservation&quot;. Other publications include the &quot;International Zoo Yearbook&quot; and &quot;Remote Sensing in Ecology and Conservation&quot;.

<text>The Turkmenistan–Afghanistan–Pakistan–India (TAPI) Gas Pipeline, also known as Trans-Afghanistan Pipeline, is a natural gas pipeline being developed by the Galkynysh – TAPI Pipeline Company Limited with participation of the Asian Development Bank. The pipeline will transport natural gas from the Galkynysh Gas Field in Turkmenistan through Afghanistan into Pakistan and then to India. 

The TAPI pipeline was completed on the Turkmenistan side in 2024. The project is currently expanding southbound in Herat Province of Afghanistan. Proponents of the project see it as a modern continuation of the Silk Road.

In August 2024, the Foreign Minister of Turkmenistan Raşit Meredow met virtually with Mullah Abdul Ghani Baradar, Afghanistan&#x27;s Deputy Prime Minister for Economic Affairs. Following this meeting, Foreign Minister Meredow &quot;said that Turkmenistan is ready to begin work on the TAPI project in Afghanistan with the aim of developing political and economic relations.&quot; 

==History==
The roots of this project lie in the involvement of international oil companies in Kazakhstan and Turkmenistan beginning of 1990s. As Russia, who controlled all export pipelines of these countries, consistently refused to allow the use of its pipeline network, these companies needed an independent export route avoiding both Iran and Russia.

The original project started on 15 March 1995 when an inaugural memorandum of understanding between the governments of Turkmenistan and Pakistan for a pipeline project was signed. This project was promoted by Argentinian company Bridas Corporation. The U.S. company Unocal, in conjunction with the Saudi oil company Delta, promoted an alternative project without Bridas&#x27; involvement. On 21 October 1995, these two companies signed a separate agreement with Turkmenistan&#x27;s president Saparmurat Niyazov. In August 1996, the Central Asia Gas Pipeline, Ltd. (CentGas) consortium for construction of a pipeline, led by Unocal, was formed. On 27 October 1997, CentGas was incorporated in formal signing ceremonies in Ashgabat, Turkmenistan, by several international oil companies along with the Government of Turkmenistan.

Since the pipeline was to pass through Afghanistan, it was necessary to work with the Taliban. The U.S. ambassador to Pakistan, Robert Oakley, left his post and was hired by CentGas in 1997. In January 1998, the Taliban, selecting CentGas over Argentinian competitor Bridas Corporation, signed an agreement that allowed the proposed project to proceed. In June 1998, Russian Gazprom relinquished its 10% stake in the project. On 7 August 1998, American embassies in Nairobi and Dar es Salaam were bombed. The United States alleged that Osama bin Laden was behind those attacks, and all pipeline negotiations halted, as the Taliban&#x27;s then leader, Mullah Omar, announced that bin Laden had the Taliban&#x27;s support. Unocal withdrew from the consortium on 8 December 1998, and soon after closed its offices in Afghanistan and Pakistan.

The new deal on the pipeline was signed on 27 December 2002 by the leaders of Turkmenistan, Afghanistan and Pakistan. In 2005, the Asian Development Bank submitted the final version of a feasibility study designed by British company Penspen. The project has drawn strong US support as it would allow the Central Asian republics to export energy to Western markets &quot;without relying on Russian routes&quot;. Then-US Ambassador to Turkmenistan Tracey Ann Jacobson noted, &quot;We are seriously looking at the project, and it is quite possible that American companies will join it&quot;. Due to increasing instability, the project has essentially stalled; construction of the Turkmen part was supposed to start in 2006, but the overall feasibility is questionable since the southern part of the Afghan section runs through territory which continues to be under &quot;de facto&quot; Taliban control.

On 24 April 2008, Pakistan, India and Afghanistan signed a framework agreement to buy natural gas from Turkmenistan. The intergovernmental agreement on the pipeline was signed on 11 December 2010 in Ashgabat. However, in April 2012, India and Afghanistan have failed to agree on transit fee for gas passing through Afghan territory. Consequently, Islamabad and New Delhi too could not agree on the transit fee for the segment of the pipeline passing through Pakistan, which has linked its fee structure to any India-Afghanistan agreement. On 16 May 2012, the Afghan Parliament, approved the agreement on a gas pipeline and the day after, the Indian Cabinet allowed state-run gas-firm GAIL to sign the Gas Sale and Purchase Agreement (GSPA) with Türkmengaz, Turkmenistan&#x27;s national oil company.

The TAPI project started in Turkmenistan on 13 December 2015 and was completed by mid-2019. Work on the Afghan side was scheduled to start in February 2018, but was delayed until September 2024.

==Technical features==
The pipeline will be in diameter with a working pressure of . The capacity will be of natural gas per year of which will be provided to Afghanistan and to each Pakistan and India. Six compressor stations would be constructed along the pipeline. The pipeline was intended to be operational by 2019.

Originally, the cost of the pipeline project was reportedly estimated at US$7.6 billion, but a more recent estimate was $10 billion. The leading partner of the project is Türkmengaz.

==Route==
The pipeline will run from the world&#x27;s second largest gas field namely Galkynysh gas fields in Turkmenistan through Afghanistan and Pakistan to India. In Afghanistan, TAPI pipeline will be constructed alongside the Kandahar–Herat Highway in western Afghanistan, and then via Quetta and Multan in Pakistan. The final destination of the pipeline will be the Indian town of Fazilka, near the border between Pakistan and India.

<text>The State Provincial Office on the Åland Islands () represented the Finnish central government on Åland between 1918 and 2009. Due to its autonomy, it had somewhat different functions than similar offices in other Provinces of Finland. Generally a State Provincial Office was a joint regional authority of seven different ministries of the Government of Finland. In Åland the State Provincial Office also represented a set of other authorities of the central government, which in mainland-Finland has separate bureaucracies. On the other hand duties, which on mainland-Finland were handled by the provincial offices, were transferred to the autonomous government of Åland. 

Along with the abolition of all Provinces of Finland, the Åland State Provincial Office was replaced by the State Department of Åland in 2009.

<doc id="372283" wikidata="Q3909964" url="?curid=372283" title="Politics of Åland">
<text>Politics of the [[Åland|Åland Islands]] takes place in a framework of a parliamentary representative democratic autonomous, demilitarised, and unilingually Swedish territory of Finland, whereby the Lantråd is the head of government, and of a multi-party system.

The Åland Islands are governed according to the Act on Åland Autonomy and international treaties, which guarantees autonomy and demilitarized status. The Government of Åland, or &quot;Landskapsregering&quot;, is dependent on the Parliament of Åland, or &quot;Lagting&quot;, according to the principles of parliamentarism.

In 1634, Åland was made part of the Åbo and Björneborg County as a part of the grand administrative reforms initiated by Count Axel Oxenstierna. The county became part of the Russian Empire within the Grand Duchy of Finland in 1809, when Sweden was forced to cede vast areas in the Napoleonic Wars. When Finland declared its independence in 1917, the newly established state inherited the Åland islands.

During the Civil War in 1918, some Russian troops were still stationed on the islands, causing serious instability and nervousness. This anxiety in the local population, and the other Scandinavian states, resulted in a Swedish occupation and 7,135 people (of a total population of approximately 22,500 at the time) signing the address for Åland joining the kingdom of Sweden. The fear of Russia finally resulted in a German occupation of the islands. In the meantime, the Finnish press was playing with the idea of an exchange of land areas between Sweden and Finland. The areas in question of this exchange would have been the Swedish-speaking Åland to Sweden and some Finnish-speaking areas of Norrbotten and Västerbotten to Finland. The response from the Swedish government was bluntly negative to any exchanges of this nature.

Since the 1920s, the primary political issue in Åland Islands relates to the promotion and protection of the self-government of the islands. There is widespread political support for retaining self-government. The sovereignty over Åland belongs to Finland, and Åland is thus not independent. The Åland Islands are guaranteed representation in the Finnish parliament, and elect one representative.

In 1921 the question of Åland was brought to the council of the League of Nations. The council decided unanimously, that the islands would remain under Finland&#x27;s sovereignty, but stated that the native population&#x27;s rights to their language had to be preserved, that the area had to stay demilitarized, and that Åland was granted autonomy during peacetime.

Åland has its national flag, has issued its postage stamps since 1984, has its police force, and is a member of the Nordic Council. The islands are demilitarised, and the male population is exempted from conscription. Parliamentarism has been the custom since 1988. The Åland autonomy preceded the creation of the Regions of Finland, but the autonomous government of Åland also handles what the regional councils do.

Until the late 1970s, Åland politics was predominantly personalised, as politics was oriented around notable individuals. In the late 1970s, a party system developed. The prominent parties in Åland since 1979 are the Social Democrats, Centre, Liberals, and Moderates. In comparison to the other Nordic countries, the political left is weak in Åland.

In addition to Åland&#x27;s government, the Government of Åland (&quot;Ålands Landskapsregering&quot;), there is also a State Department of Åland (&quot;Statens ämbetsverk på Åland&quot;), headed by the Governor, Peter Lindbäck, and which is a department of the Government of Finland concerned with its functions in the islands.

==Legislative branch==
The Parliament of Åland (&quot;Lagtinget&quot;, which means Law Thing) has 30 members, elected for a four-year term by proportional representation.

<text>The rozhok () is an ancient Russian wooden trumpet, a relative of the cornett, which has remained in continuous use until the present day. It is also known as Vladimirskiy rozhok, (, meaning &quot;Vladimir horn&quot;).

== Names ==

The origins of the instrument date to before AD 1600. The tradition of playing the &quot;rozhok&quot; in an ensemble probably dates to a much earlier time. It is possible that the name &quot;rozhok&quot; was used for the instrument later, and that in the earliest written sources it was simply called a pipe. A rozhok can be called be various names: shepherd&#x27;s horn (), Russian horn (), or song horn (). At the end of the 19th century, the name &quot;Vladimir&quot; was added to this instrument&#x27;s name (, Vladimirskiy rozhok, &quot;Vladimir horn&quot;), due to the success of a chorus of rozhok players under the leadership of Nikolai Vasilyevich Kondratyev from the Vladimir region.

== Structure ==
A rozhok is a conical straight tube with the six playing holes: five on top and one underneath. The total length of a rozhok ranges from 320 to 830 mm (13&quot; to 33&quot;). A mouthpiece is cut in the form of a small cup, and the lower end of the tube is shaped like a conical bell. A rozhok is usually made of birch, maple, or juniper. Musicians say that rozhoks of juniper have the best sound. In the past they were made in the same manner as a shepherd&#x27;s rozhok, in which two halves are fastened together with birch bark; today they are turned. The sound of a rozhok is strong, but mellow, having a range of about an octave, or a little more. There are several types of rozhoks: the shortest one, having the highest sound is called &quot;vizgunok&quot; (squeaker), typically in F# or G; the longest and thus the lowest one is called &quot;bas&quot; (bass), in F# or G an octave below, while a mid-size instrument is called a &quot;polubasok&quot; (half-bass), typically in C. It is &quot;polubasok&quot; instruments that are most frequently used for solo playing. Rozhok ensembles usually consist of just &quot;vizgunok&quot; and &quot;bas&quot; instruments in the ratio 2:1 (twice as many high-pitched horns).

== Varieties ==
Rozhok&#x27;s folk tunes are divided into four stylistic varieties: signal, song, dancing, and dance, with a large number of songs in all styles. There are several types of shepherd&#x27;s signals and more of others. The main repertoire is song folk-tunes.

As of 2015, rozhok ensembles exist in Moscow, Vladimir and Nerekhta. In addition, rozhoks can sometimes be heard in Russian folk orchestra concerts.

<doc id="372290" wikidata="Q735210" url="?curid=372290" title="Short-finned pilot whale">
<text>The short-finned pilot whale (Globicephala macrorhynchus) is one of the two species of cetaceans in the genus &quot;Globicephala&quot;, which it shares with the long-finned pilot whale (&quot;G. melas&quot;). It is part of the oceanic dolphin family (Delphinidae).

It has a worldwide distribution with a global population of about 700,000, and there may be 3 or 4 distinct populations—two in the Pacific and one in the Atlantic and Indian Oceans. Its range is moving northward due to global warming. In the Pacific, males average and females . It generally has a stocky build with black to dark gray or brown skin, and can be distinguished from its counterpart by shorter flippers, fewer teeth, and a shorter beak. It is thought to pursue fast-moving squid typically at a depth of , but the maximum recorded depth is .

The short-finned pilot whale has been reported as being highly playful and social. It typically travels in pods of 10–30 members, usually family, but has been observed moving in groups of several hundred. Like killer whales, it has a matrilineal social hierarchy with an elder female at the head and a sizable post-reproductive lifespan. It is polygynous; females often outnumber males 8:1 in a pod.

Pods are known to mass strand, possibly due to sheer accident, biosonars confused by geomagnetic anomalies, injury from loud military sonar, or disease. It was historically whaled, and is still whaled today by Japan and the Lesser Antilles, but it is protected by several international treaties.

== Taxonomy ==
The name &quot;pilot whale&quot; originated with an early theory that pods were &quot;piloted&quot; by a leader. Other common names include the &quot;pothead whale&quot; (after the bulbous melon), and &quot;blackfish&quot; (a catch-all term used to designate numerous species of small, dark-colored toothed whales, including the pygmy sperm whale and false killer whale).

Worldwide, the diversity of mitochondrial DNA in short-finned pilot whales is considered to be low relative to other species with global distributions. A 2014 study found a unique haplotype in the Caribbean region.

===Evolution===
The short-finned pilot whale is considered to be a single species with three divergent types: the Shiho, Naisa and Atlantic short-finned pilot whales.

The Shiho and Naisa forms are actually subspecies of the short-finned pilot whale, with the Shiho clade having diverged approximately 17.5 thousand years ago (kya), during the last glacial maximum. The exact boundaries of the two subspecies&#x27; ranges remain undefined due to lack of data. Based on current evidence, the Shiho subspecies is distributed in the eastern Pacific Ocean, and the Naisa subspecies encompasses the central/western Pacific and Indian Oceans, as well as the Atlantic Ocean. It appears as though the Pacific Ocean acts as a semi‐permeable barrier between the two subspecies, allowing occasional migration and mixing between the eastern and western Pacific Ocean, but keeping the populations separate enough to drive this differentiation.

The Atlantic clade is thought to have diverged from the Naisa approximately 12.5 kya, however this split is supported by mitochondrial DNA only, and not nuclear DNA. Further analysis is required to clarify whether the Atlantic Ocean and central/western Pacific and Indian Oceans pilot whales may also be sufficiently distinct to be considered subspecies.

The Atlantic and Indian/western-central Pacific types are also diverging from each other, with the Benguela Current off the coast of South Africa separating the two.

==Description==

Short-finned pilot whales are black to dark gray/brown, with a thick tail stock, fluke with sharply pointed tips, bulbous head, and a broad, sickle-shaped dorsal fin. Coloration typically includes light grey to white areas such as a saddle patch behind the dorsal fin, a light grey or white anchor-shaped patch under the chin and belly, and a blaze marking behind the eye. These traits, however, can vary between populations. For example, two distinct forms are described from on the Pacific coast of central Japan: the Shiho morphotype is the larger of the two– females , males , and has a white dorsal patch and round melon, while the Naisa type is smaller– females , males – with a characteristic flattened or squarish melon and a darker, indistinct saddle patch. Short-finned pilot whales can reach up to in length and weigh up to , making it the third-largest species of oceanic dolphin, behind the orca and long-finned pilot whale. When they are born, short-finned pilot whales weigh about at a length of .

Long-finned and short-finned pilot whales are often hard to tell apart. However, as their names indicate, short-finned pilot whale flippers are shorter than those of the long-finned pilot whale, measuring about 1/6th of the body length. Short-finned pilot whales also have fewer teeth – 7–9 in each row – and a shorter and broader rostrum with a premaxilla that covers more of the maxilla. Both species exhibit sexual dimorphism and have similar lifespans of about 45 years for males and 60 years for females, with long-finned pilot whales being generally larger than short-finned pilot whales. The two species have limited overlap worldwide; long-finned pilot whales are found in cooler temperate waters, while the distribution of short-finned pilot whales is largely tropical and subtropical.

== Geographic distribution ==

Short-finned pilot whales are found in both coastal and pelagic waters in temperate and tropical regions of the Indian, Atlantic, and Pacific Oceans. Information on the spatial habitat use of pilot whales in the northwest Atlantic is limited, however short-finned pilot whales are thought to range from the southern end of Georges Bank into the tropics, overlapping with the range of the long-finned pilot whales along the mid-Atlantic shelf break between Delaware and Georges Bank.

Off the coast of Japan, the distributions of the Shiho and Naisa types are well-documented and largely nonoverlapping, with the Naisa-type inhabiting the warm-temperate waters of the Kuroshio Current, and the Shiho-type inhabiting cold-temperate waters of the Oyashio Current. Some evidence suggests these populations might even be distinct subspecies, based on differences in morphology, mitochondrial DNA and breeding seasons. Beyond Japan, the Naisa-type occurs in southeast Asia, the Indian Ocean, and Hawaii, and the Shiho-type can be found in the California Current and off Peru.

Pilot whales show strong natal philopatry, often remaining year-round in places such as Hawaii, the U.S. and British Virgin Islands, the Madeira Islands, and parts of California, though some populations migrate with the seasonal and annual fluctuations in temperature and productivity.

Once commonly seen off of Southern California, short-finned pilot whales disappeared from the area after a strong El Niño year in 1982 and 1983, and have since been encountered infrequently, primarily during warm-water years such as 1991, 1993, 1997, 2014, and 2015. It is not known whether the animals sighted more recently were part of the same population that was documented off Southern California before the mid-1980s, or a different wide-ranging pelagic population, therefore the status of this stock remains unknown.

Pilot whales are economically important in the whale-watching industry of some areas of the world, such as Madeira, Hawaii, and the Canary Islands, which host resident populations of these whales. The effects of tourism activities on pilot whales have not been well studied, but some evidence suggests that the impact of underwater noise from whale-watching boats can have the potential to significantly disrupt communication at close range. Many countries offer safe whale-watching guidelines designed to minimize the impact of their activities on the animals being watched (see supplementary materials).

==Behaviour==
=== Social lives ===
Short-finned pilot whales are long-lived, slow to reproduce, and highly social animals. They are usually found in pods of 10 to 30 individuals, though groups of up to several hundred short-finned pilot whales have been reported in the Caribbean. These pods are stable social structures, meaning that they form hierarchical associations that remain stable for generations, and are primarily thought to be matrilineal, i.e. led by an elder female relative, similar to those of resident killer whales. However, a study by Van Cise et al. (2017) showed that, in the Hawaii islands, the social organization of pods was indicative of familial behaviour rather than matrilineal, and was driven by genetic relatedness. Groups of closely related individuals formed tight associations, or clusters, with other close relatives, and genetic analysis revealed a significant differentiation between clusters, even those that were present in the same area. Clusters that were more genetically different also spent less time together. This could suggest that social behaviour in short-finned pilot whales inhibits gene flow outside of family groups.

Pilot whales are also known for their socializing and playful behaviour at the surface, such as lobtailing (slapping their flukes on the water surface) and spy-hopping (poking their heads above the surface). Members of a pod have also been observed making various altruistic behaviours, such as alloparental care, in which nonparent whales help to take care of young that are not their own. In the closely related long-finned pilot whales, babysitting of calves by other group members is frequently documented, and can be performed by males as well as females.

=== Reproduction ===

Males are polygynous, meaning they will mate with multiple females at one time and throughout their lives. Pods are often found with around one mature male per every eight mature females. During mating aggregations, males will temporarily leave their pods to mate with females from other pods, but will return to their own pods once mating is over, which helps to prevent inbreeding. Female pilot whales mature at about 7–12 years of age, and will start having calves every five to eight years, averaging about 4 to 5 calves in a lifetime. A calf will suckle its mother for a minimum of two years, with most continuing to suckle for five years, and some evidence suggests that females may continue to lactate for up to 15 years after the birth of their last calf. A female will usually stop reproducing once reaching the age of 40 years, even though the maximum lifespan exceeds 60 years.

=== Foraging ===
Short-finned pilot whales are apex predators. The diet preferences and foraging habits of short-finned pilot whales are still poorly understood, however, they are known to be deep-divers, and are generally found foraging on the steep slopes along the continental shelf break. The diet of these large marine predators is thought to consist primarily of squid, but will also include certain species of fish and octopus. On rare occasions, they are also known to prey on other marine mammals.

They use echolocation when they hunt, clicking and listening for echoes from prey as they descend and generating a rapid &quot;buzz&quot; of clicks at the depth of their dive that accompanies a high-speed sprinting attack.

They have been recorded to feed at a maximum depth of 1018 m (3340 ft) for a length of 21 minutes, although average dives tend to be shallower (around 700m) and last around 15 minutes. When foraging, a pod may spread out up to 800 m (half-mile) to find food. Pilot whales are known as the &#x27;cheetahs of the deep&#x27; for the high-speed pursuits of squid at depths of hundreds of meters.

==Population status==

The total of all available abundance estimates for short-finned pilot whales is approximately 700,000 individuals, but populations vary worldwide, and large parts of the species&#x27; range have not been surveyed, therefore actual abundance could be considerably greater than this.

In the western Pacific, population estimates range from 5,300 individuals in Northern Japan to 53,608 in Southern Japan. 7,700 individuals are reported in the eastern Sulu Sea (Philippines), and in the Eastern tropical Pacific the most recent estimate from 2000 gives 589,000 individuals. The resident population in Tenerife, Spain, is estimated at only 350 individuals.

Three stocks of short-finned pilot whales are recognized in U.S. waters, which live along the east and west coasts, and around the Hawaiian Islands. The best available abundance estimates place the West Coast stock at only 800 animals, and the East Coast stock at 21,500. These estimates come from sightings reported from vessel and aerial surveys, and may be under-representing the true population abundance due to the wide range that the species covers, and the difficulty of distinguishing long-finned and short-finned pilot whales at sea.

The Hawaiian archipelago is home to the Naisa-type short-finned pilot whale, which appears to be segregated into three island-associated communities based on photo-ID and satellite tagging data: the Main Hawaiian Islands (MHI) community, the Northwestern Hawaiian Islands (NWHI) community, found around O&#x27;ahu and Kaua&#x27;i Islands, and the central MHI community around O&#x27;ahu and Lāna&#x27;i Islands. There are no population estimates for the different island communities, but in all of Hawaiian waters there are an estimated 90-20 thousand short-finned pilot whales, with the MHI community being the most abundant.

Short-finned pilot whales are among the most frequently encountered cetaceans in the Canary Islands, but estimates of abundance are not available. Records suggest they are also abundant in deep water off the west coast of Africa, around the Maldives, and in the northern Indian Ocean more generally. However, despite previous study efforts, there is still no information on global numbers or trends for this species.

==Threats==
=== Natural predators and strandings ===

One study suggests short-finned pilot whales are among Caribbean Orcas&#x27; prey, and Killer Whales have been recorded attacking short-finned pilot whales in Peru. Most of the data on pilot whale mortalities comes from mass stranding events. Pilot whales are often involved in mass strandings throughout their range, with several well-documented incidents involving dozens of individuals in Australia, the Canary Islands, and the U.S. Many theories have been proposed to explain these events, which include accidents in navigation that lead animals to unexpectedly shallow waters, anomalies in the earth&#x27;s geomagnetic fields impacting navigation, injury or disorientation caused by military sonar, or impaired navigation in diseased individuals that lead the rest of the group astray. Due to their tight social bonds, rescue attempts following strandings are not always successful, as whales will often re-strand themselves upon hearing the calls of their group members on shore.

=== Human-induced threats ===

Short-finned pilot whales have been hunted for many centuries, particularly by Japanese whalers. Between 1948 and 1980, hundreds of whales were exploited at Hokkaido and Sanriku in the north and Taiji, Izu, and Okinawa in the south. Annual catches have ranged from 9 to 198 whales from 2010 to 2023 across the country. Today, pilot whales are hunted in a few areas of Japan, mainly along the central Pacific coast, as well as the Lesser Antilles (e.g., St. Vincent and the Grenadines, St. Lucia, Dominica, Martinique), where whales are commercially hunted and the meat is available for human consumption. Pilot whales&#x27; strong social bonds and herding instincts make them prime candidates for so-called drive fisheries, where whales are herded towards shore by boats and then killed in shallow waters. Other hunting methods include hand or crossbow-projected harpooning, and small-type whaling (defined as the use of a cannon mounted on a vessel below a certain size). From 2010 to 2023, the average annual catch of short-finned pilot whales in Japan was 73 whales, a large proportion of which was allocated to the drive hunt in Taiji. Whaling documentation in the Caribbean has been sporadic and often incomplete, but at least in St. Vincent and the Grenadines, local hunters have taken an average of 141 pilot whales and 159 dolphins of various species annually from 1962 to 2009.

Certain Japanese restaurants serve pilot whale as sashimi, or as steaks that are marinated, cut into small chunks, and grilled. The meat is high in protein and low in fat (a whale&#x27;s fat is contained in the layer of blubber beneath the skin). It is considered integral to certain cultures. When grilled, the meat is slightly flaky and described as being quite flavorful, somewhat gamey, with distinct yet subtle undertones recalling its marine origin.

Like many marine predators, pilot whales are susceptible to entanglement and bycatch in pelagic fishing gear, such as gill nets, long lines and some trawl fisheries. Once entangled or hooked, whales may drag the gear behind them for long distances, resulting in fatigue, compromised feeding ability, or injury, often leading to reduced reproductive success and death. Pilot whales are also susceptible to vessel strikes, which can be lethal, or lead to injury and behavioural changes. As top predators, pilot whales also suffer from the bioaccumulation of contaminants such as heavy metals and organichlorines in their tissues, which can have serious long-term impacts on health and reproduction, and is a rising concern in cultures that consume pilot whale meat. Short-finned pilot whales off the west coast of the US were found to have high amounts of DDT and PCB, however the levels were lower in whales from Japan and the Antilles.

=== Captivity ===

Short-finned pilot whales, have been kept in captivity in various marine parks off southern California, Hawaii and Japan, arguably starting the late 1940s. Pilot whales have historically had low survival rates in captivity, with less than half surviving past 24 months. Bubbles, a female short-finned pilot whale who was displayed in Marineland, and eventually at Sea World California, was one exception to the rule, living to be somewhere in her 50s when she eventually died on 12 June 2016.

=== Climate change ===
In the context of global warming, the ranges of short-finned pilot whales are expected to shift northward in response to warming temperatures, which could eventually lead to increased overlap and potential hybridization with their long-finned cousins. The distribution limit of short-finned pilot whales in the Northeast Atlantic has already shifted 3° latitude in only two decades, and evidence for introgressive hybridization (i.e. the movement of a genes from one species into the gene pool of another) with long-finned pilot whales is appearing in DNA samples from the Northeast Atlantic. Like many other species, pilot whales are also likely to be affected by changes in prey distribution and abundance, habitat degradation, and other secondary effects of climate change, coupled with human-mediated stressors such as marine traffic and pollution, which could lead to the global decline, or even loss, of this species.

==Conservation==
The short-finned pilot whale was listed on the IUCN Red List as Data Deficient in 2008, and remains data-poor in much of its range, especially in the Southern Hemisphere and in large parts of the tropical and warm temperate North Atlantic Ocean.

The short-finned pilot whale is covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS), and the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS). The purpose of these two groups is to reduce threats to cetaceans through improving current knowledge, and enforcement of the outlined conservation measures.

The species is further included in the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU). In the United States, short-finned pilot whales are protected under the Marine Mammal Protection Act. Globally, they are listed in Appendix II of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), which aim is to ensure that international trade in specimens of wild animals and plants does not threaten their survival.

Around the world, several efforts aim to address the threats faced by cetaceans, including pilot whales. For example, in the United States, NOAA Fisheries implemented the Pacific Offshore Cetacean Take Reduction Plan, which aims to reduce serious injuries and deaths of marine mammals incidental to the California/Oregon thresher shark/swordfish drift gillnet fishery through methods like gear modifications, limited fishing depth, and skipper education workshops.

In areas where resident pilot whale populations are seen near the coast, such as those off the Canary Islands, Madeira, and Hawaii, they can be studied using photo-identification. This technique helps researchers identify unique markings and scars on the whales&#x27; dorsal fins, which are used to recognize individuals from photographic surveys to monitor movements and life histories over time. Other research techniques including satellite tagging, acoustics, and genetics to learn about the species&#x27; long-range movements, genetic diversity and social behaviour. However, there have been few long-term studies focused on this species, and data is spotty for many of the small local populations. This makes assessing threats and population dynamics difficult, and more research is needed before any statements can be made on the global status of short-finned pilot whales.

<doc id="372291" wikidata="Q2739940" url="?curid=372291" title="CFG Bank Arena">
<text>CFG Bank Arena is a multipurpose arena in Baltimore, Maryland. This venue is located about one block away from the Baltimore Convention Center on the corner of Baltimore Street and Hopkins Place in downtown Baltimore. With a seating capacity of up to 14,000 for concerts, CFG Bank Arena is owned by the City of Baltimore and managed by the Oak View Group, a global sports and entertainment company.

The venue officially opened on October 23, 1962, as the Baltimore Civic Center. Designed by AG Odell Jr. and Associates, it was built on the site of Old Congress Hall, where the Continental Congress met in 1776. The venue has been home to several Baltimore-based sports teams, most notably the Baltimore Bullets (now Washington Wizards) of the NBA from 1963 to 1973.

As a cornerstone for the Inner Harbor redevelopment during the 1980s, it was reopened after renovations and renamed the Baltimore Arena in 1986. In 2003, it was renamed 1st Mariner Arena for Baltimore-based 1st Mariner Bank, which purchased naming rights to the arena for 10 years. When this naming rights agreement ended in 2013, the arena returned to its &quot;Baltimore Arena&quot; name until convenience store chain Royal Farms purchased the naming rights in September 2014; the arena was known as Royal Farms Arena until 2022. After an extensive renovation, the venue reopened as CFG Bank Arena in February 2023.

==History==

===1960s–1970s===
A cornerstone to the Arena was laid in 1961 with a vault that included messages from then-U.S. President John F. Kennedy, then-Maryland governor J. Millard Tawes, and then-Baltimore Mayor J. Harold Grady. The vault was opened in 2006. The current site that was chosen for the Baltimore Civic Center was actually not one of the many sites proposed to the Greater Baltimore Committee in 1955. Among nine suggested locations were two in Druid Hill Park, three at the end of the Inner Harbor basin (where the World Trade Center and Harborplace are now located), and one in Clifton Park.

From 1962 through 1976, the Baltimore Clippers of the American Hockey League played their home games at the Arena. The financially troubled Clippers ceased operations in mid-season, 1974–75, when the professional Baltimore Blades (the relocated Michigan Stags) of the World Hockey Association (WHA) moved into the market/arena. The Blades folded at the end of the season, and the Clippers regrouped for one final AHL season 1975–76. The Arena has hosted two other AHL franchises: the Baltimore Skipjacks lasted from 1981 to 1993, and the Baltimore Bandits from 1995 to 1997.

On November 12, 1962, the Arena hosted a boxing match between Joey Giardello and Johnny Morris attended by 6,000 fans.

In 1963, the Arena became the home of the NBA&#x27;s Baltimore Bullets, where the team played its home games until their move to the Capital Centre in 1973. The NBA All-Star Game was also played at the Arena in 1969.

The Beatles performed at the Arena on September 13, 1964, to a total of 28,000 attendees in two performances on the same day, at 4:00 pm and 8:30 pm.

On April 3, 1965, defending WWWF champion Bruno Sammartino defeated Gene Kiniski in a return title match. Just a few months later, in January 1966, Kiniski would win the National Wrestling Alliance (NWA) title.

On April 12, 1966, Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. gave a speech, &quot;Race and the Church&quot;, before a gathering of Methodist clergy at the Baltimore Civic Center.

The venue also hosted Led Zeppelin several times through the early 1970s. A couple of scenes from the Led Zeppelin concert film &quot;The Song Remains the Same&quot; were filmed backstage. On June 13, 1970, The Jimi Hendrix Experience played the Civic Center with a last-minute decision to visit from New York and sold out. This was noted to be one of the best performances of the whole 1970 tour and was one of the last shows Hendrix played before his death a few months later. Chicago performed at the Civic Center on September 4, 1971, the month before the release of their fourth album, &quot;Chicago at Carnegie Hall&quot;. Elvis Presley played the Civic Center twice: Tuesday, November 9, 1971, 8:30pm (wearing the Red Lion Suit) and again on Sunday, May 29, 1977, 8:30pm (wearing the Mexican Sundial Suit), less than three months before his untimely death. Both shows were complete sell-outs. The Grateful Dead&#x27;s performance on September 17, 1972, was recorded and later released as &quot;Dick&#x27;s Picks Volume 23&quot;. It contains the complete concert, except for the encore, which was &quot;One More Saturday Night&quot;. It contains the longest CD version of &quot;The Other One&quot;, to date, at nearly 40 minutes long.

In 1974, the World Team Tennis (WTT) Baltimore Banners played their home games there in their only season. World No. 1 player Jimmy Connors was on that team. After Connors defeated Ken Rosewall in Wimbledon they played each other at the Arena in a rematch. Billie Jean King and John Newcombe both played at the Arena, with their respective WTT clubs.

The Civic Center was host to the 1974 and 1975 MEAC men&#x27;s basketball tournament. In 1975, professional basketball returned briefly with the Baltimore Claws of the American Basketball Association (ABA). The Memphis Sounds relocated to Baltimore following the 1974–75 ABA season and were first called the Baltimore Hustlers, before changing their name. Troubled financially from the start, the Claws folded after three road exhibition games.

===1980s–1990s===
The Arena was the home of the Major Indoor Soccer League&#x27;s Baltimore Blast from their arrival in the 1980–1981 season until the league folded in 1992. The Blast won their only championship in the 1983–84 season which was attended by upwards of 11,200 fans. The Blast, regardless of incarnation, were the longest-serving tenant in the Arena&#x27;s history.

Van Halen performed at the Arena on July 22, 1980, as part of their Van Halen World Invasion Tour. Bon Jovi performed to a sold-out Arena crowd during their Slippery When Wet Tour on December 29, 1986. In 1986 and 1989, the Arena was host to popular Italian opera singer Luciano Pavarotti. Def Leppard performed at the Arena on October 9, 1987, during their Hysteria World Tour.

Kiss performed at the Arena on November 27, 1984, as part of their Animalize World Tour. This performance is notable, because lead guitarist Mark St. John makes his live debut with the band, after being temporarily replaced by Bruce Kulick for the first two months of the tour due to contracting reactive arthritis. Kulick played the first five songs of the show, then St. John joined onstage to perform five songs. Kulick returned onstage and finished the show. Both St. John and Kulick bowed with the rest of the members at the end of the show. St. John went on to play only two full shows with the band before being permanently replaced by Kulick.

The Arena was the home of the Major Indoor Lacrosse League (MILL) and later the National Lacrosse League (NLL) Baltimore Thunder from 1987 through 1999. The Thunder won the inaugural MILL championship. Notable players include Gary Gait, Tom Gravante (head Men&#x27;s Lacrosse coach at Mount St. Mary&#x27;s University) and Hugh Donovan.
The Arena was a frequent venue for Jim Crockett Promotions (NWA) and World Championship Wrestling (WCW). Starting in 1988, The Great American Bash pay-per-view was held at the Arena eight times. It also hosted SuperBrawl V in 1995. Sting defeated Ric Flair to win his first NWA World Championship at 1990&#x27;s Great American Bash, and Ron Simmons upset Big Van Vader in 1992 for the WCW title, becoming the first African-American to hold a major world title. The nWo was reformed in 1999 at the Baltimore Arena with Bret Hart, Kevin Nash, Scott Hall and Jeff Jarrett on the Nitro after Starrcade

The Arena has also hosted many WWE events over the years. Most notably the 1994 King of the Ring, No Mercy (2003), No Way Out 2006, Backlash 2008, Extreme Rules (2010), , Payback (2015), and Extreme Rules (2017) as well as multiple &quot;Raw&quot; and &quot;SmackDown!&quot; tapings. Major title changes to take place in the Arena include Superstar Billy Graham over Bruno Sammartino in 1977 for the WWWF championship and Tito Santana over Greg Valentine in 1985 for the WWF Intercontinental title in a steel cage match.

In 1989, the Arena was host to the U.S. National Figure Skating Championships. Three years later, the International Olympic Committee held the U.S. Olympic Gymnastics Trials there. In 1995, the Arena was host to the NCAA Men&#x27;s Basketball Division 1 games (Rounds 1 &amp; 2).

The NBA&#x27;s Washington Bullets (formerly based in Baltimore) played 35 regular season &quot;home&quot; games at the arena from January 1989 through March 1997; their final game at the arena was a 94–87 victory over the Dallas Mavericks on March 29, 1997. The team has yet to play a regular season game in Baltimore under its current Wizards moniker.

===2000s===
The Arena has also been a staple on the PBR&#x27;s Built Ford Tough Series bull riding tour. It first visited the Arena from 2001 to 2003, then came back again from 2008 to 2010. It returned in 2012 and again in 2015.

===2020s===
The COVID-19 pandemic in Maryland led to the postponement or cancellation of a number of arena events. The venue went dark until a September 2021 Guns N&#x27; Roses performance.

In February 2022, the arena hosted the CIAA men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball tournament. No further events were scheduled due to the pending renovation. After the tournament, the city terminated its naming rights deal with Royal Farms. Oak View Group, which is leading the arena&#x27;s renovation, has the right to sell naming rights and other sponsorships.

In October 2022 the arena was renamed CFG Bank Arena. The arena reopened in February 2023 after a year long renovation and once again hosted the 2023 CIAA men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s basketball tournament. The first concert held since the renovation was Bruce Springsteen and the E Street Band in April 2023.

==Proposed replacement and the decision for renovation==
On October 16, 2004, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; revealed that official steps had been taken toward replacing the Arena, then 42 years old. The Maryland Stadium Authority had started soliciting proposals for a feasibility study on building an Arena in downtown Baltimore, due on November 1, 2004. According to the request for proposals, the new Arena would be built on the same site of Royal Farms Arena and &quot;would have a smaller seating capacity than would be required for an NHL or NBA team&quot; but it did not set a specific seating capacity.

On May 15, 2007, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; reported that the feasibility study started in 2004 had been released publicly and the study stated that the current Arena had &quot;served its useful life&quot; and that Baltimore must build a new Arena or face the risk of losing events. The study rejected a proposal to repair the Arena&#x27;s aging systems, citing an estimated cost of $60 million, and instead suggested that the city demolish Royal Farms Arena and build a new Arena on the same site or elsewhere in Baltimore. Notably the proposed new Arena would seat only 15,000 to 16,000 people; the study assumed that Baltimore would never be successful in attracting a major pro team in the future; however, city officials were still open to this idea.

Conceivably, the new arena could be successful in attracting a minor-league hockey team, bringing more than 200 new jobs and generating up to $1 million in additional tax revenue. City officials have said that the private sector would need to bear the brunt of the estimated $162-million construction cost of the new arena, as the city is also considering giving up ownership of the arena. The Baltimore Development Corporation (BDC) stated that it would begin seeking interested developers for the project by June 2007. BDC&#x27;s President M. J. &quot;Jay&quot; Brodie said it was a &quot;miracle&quot; that the current Arena books as many events as it does in its current state. City officials have said the location of the new Arena would be dependent on what the developers suggest. Officials stated that they are equally comfortable with keeping the current Arena, building the new Arena in a new location, then demolishing the current Arena, or encouraging a mixed-use development in the site of the current Arena. Advocates for downtown, including the Downtown Partnership and the Westside Renaissance, want the new Arena to remain in the downtown area.

On November 18, 2007, WJZ 13 reported that seven sites have been submitted to the BDC for a new Arena, and the choices will be narrowed down by the Spring of 2008.

On July 24, 2008, it was reported that the new Arena will be built on the same site as the current one, with a capacity of upwards of 18,500. It was unknown at that time what would happen to concerts and events while construction is underway, or who would develop the new Arena. However, there have been talks about building a temporary facility for events. The Arena was planned to be completed within three years.

On August 27, 2008, &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot; reported that developers were looking for designers to build an apartment building and outdoor shopping stores to be a part of the new Royal Farms Arena. Also, the developers announced that they were accepting all design proposals until November 26, 2008, and that, by the summer of 2009, they planned to make a final design decision.

On December 17, 2008, &quot;The Baltimore Examiner&quot; reported that the Baltimore Development Corp. had received four proposals for the Royal Farms Arena replacement that could take away a &quot;major entertainment venue&quot; for Baltimore for up to &quot;4 years&quot; and the estimated price is $300 million, but could be more depending on additional retail and hotel uses. The Arena is reported to be an 18,500-seat venue built on the site of the current Royal Farms Arena. The four proposals were:

ESmith Legacy and Garfield Traub Development: ESmith Legacy was a team led by former NFL player Emmitt Smith that has offices in Baltimore. This proposal included the following features in addition to the larger Arena:

*7-screen movie theater
* of retail space
*1,000-seat concert venue

Streuver Brothers Eccles &amp; Rouse: A well known Baltimore-based developer. This proposal included:

*300-room hotel
* of retail space

Cormony Development and Harrison Development: Respectively, Rockville- and Baltimore-based development firms who have been involved since 2007. This proposal includes:

*400-room hotel
*240,000 SF office tower
*12,000 SF to 20,000 SF of retail space

A&amp;R Development, J Street Development Co., and Accent Development Co.: A partnership of Baltimore-based A&amp;R and Washington based J Street and Accent Development under the name Arena Development. This proposal includes:

*Up to of retail space

The Baltimore Examiner reported that the BDC could make a decision on the developer as soon as mid-2009.

On July 8, 2009, ArenaDigest.com reported that Baltimore City officials had postponed their plans for constructing a new arena, due in part to the struggling economy, and the officials&#x27; decision split between building either an 18,500-seat Arena for a possible NBA or NHL franchise, or constructing a mid-size facility for concerts, family events, and minor league sports.

However, on November 12, 2010, with the recession rebounding, Mayor Stephanie Rawlings-Blake announced that city officials were considering new sites for a new arena. The plan called for Royal Farms Arena to remain open, while a new arena was constructed. While Rawlings-Blake believed that the new Arena would most likely to be erected in the city&#x27;s West Side, the Greater Baltimore Committee suggested building the Arena as an expansion to the Baltimore Convention Center, to help re-develop the Inner Harbor. The cost would range from $750 to $930 million, since it would include the 18,500-seat Arena, expansion of the Baltimore Convention Center, an underground garage, and a new 500-room Sheraton hotel; the proposed Arena site is where the current Sheraton hotel rests.

On January 14, 2015, David S. Cordish, the chairman and CEO of the Cordish Company, proposed to build a 15,000–16,000-seat waterfront arena, but built with expanded capacity in mind. The Arena, accommodated with an outdoor amphitheater and a pedestrian bridge to connect the Inner Harbor and Federal Hill, would cost $450 million and tie up with Harbor East and Power Plant Live. However, the Cordish proposal was scrapped when Maryland Governor Larry Hogan cancelled the Red Line project, which was a dire need for the arena.

On August 3, 2016, talks about the convention center/arena proposal resumed. Up to that point, a few more studies for a new arena have been planned, including a possible renovation of Royal Farms Arena and construction of a new Arena at the city&#x27;s State Center station.

On November 25, 2020, the Baltimore Development Corporation called for proposals of redeveloping the arena to a state-of-the-art facility, whether through renovation or construction of a brand-new arena. The caveat is that the arena must remain on the current site and that no proposals for alternate sites were under consideration.

On June 23, 2021, it was announced that Oak View Group, in association with the Thirty Five Ventures, the investment company of NBA player Kevin Durant and his agent and business partner, Rich Kleiman entered negotiations to invest $200 million into renovating the Royal Farms Arena. The renovations would feature &quot;overhauled concourses, new suites, new concessions, a new exterior featuring plenty of glass, and new seating.&quot; After which, the two companies would manage and lease the arena. On November 24, 2021, the Board of Estimates approved the arrangement with a one-year renovation project beginning in February 2022. The renovation cost $250 million with the arena reopening in February 2023.

==Transportation==
The CFG Bank Arena is immediately adjacent to the Baltimore Arena station on the Baltimore Light Rail. The Charles Center Metro Subway Station and many bus lines are also nearby.

<text>The long-finned pilot whale, or pothead whale(Globicephalamelas) is a large species of oceanic dolphin. It shares the genus &quot;Globicephala&quot; with the short-finned pilot whale (&quot;Globicephala macrorhynchus&quot;). Long-finned pilot whales are known as such because of their unusually long pectoral fins.

==Taxonomy and naming==

===Etymology===
Pilot whales get their name from the original belief that there was a &quot;pilot&quot; or lead individual in their groups. The name for the genus, &quot;Globicephala&quot; is derived from a combination of Latin &quot;globus&quot; (&quot;globe&quot;) and Greek &quot;kephale&quot; (&quot;head&quot;). The specific name &quot;melas&quot; is Greek for &quot;black&quot;. This species has also earned the nickname of &quot;pothead whale&quot; in some places because the shape of its head reminded early whalers of black cooking pots.

===Taxonomy===
This species was first classified in 1809 by Thomas Stewart Traill and given the name &quot;&quot;Delphinus melas&quot;. However, this scientific name was changed later to &quot;Globicephala melaena&quot;. Then in 1986, the specific name for this species was reverted to its original form as &quot;melas&quot;&quot;.

==Anatomy and morphology==

===Size===
There is sexual dimorphism in the species. Females grow to a maximum length of up to , and a maximum weight of up to . Males are significantly larger at up to in length, and weigh up to . This makes the long-finned pilot whale the second largest member of the dolphin family, behind the Orca (&quot;Orcinus orca&quot;).

===Appearance===
Despite its common name, the long-finned pilot whale is actually a large species of dolphin. The same is true of orcas and several other small whales. It has a bulbous forehead and is black or dark grey in colour with light-grey or white markings on the throat and belly regions. This light grey patch found on the throat of pilot whales forms the shape of an anchor. Some individuals have other distinct markings such as a light coloured area behind dorsal fin, known as a saddle patch, as well as an upwards sweeping stripe just behind the eye. The dorsal fin is thick and falcate in nature, and is located about a third of the way down the length of the animal. The common name of this species is a reference to the pilot whale&#x27;s long, sickle-shaped pectoral flippers that are 18 to 27 percent of its total body length. 
Being a toothed whale, pilot whales have a single blowhole.

It can be challenging to tell male and female apart in the wild for many cetacean species. Long-finned pilot whales are no exception, though it was thought in the past that males had hooked dorsal fins while females did not. Recent research on fin shape has shown that this is not a predictable way to distinguish between the sexes. However, males are bigger in size, and relative fin dimensions as well as other characteristics may still be discovered to allow for distinguishing the sex of at least certain age classes for free-ranging pilot whales.

The ranges of long-finned and short-finned pilot whales overlap in some areas of the world. As the difference between them is mainly distinguished by the length of the pectoral flippers and tooth counts, it is hard to tell the two species apart in these areas.


===Physiology===
The long-finned pilot whale has more neocortical neurons than any mammal studied to date, in fact having almost twice as many as humans.

==Behavior and life history==

===Social behavior===
Long-finned pilot whales are very social in nature. They are usually seen in groups, which range in size from a couple of individuals to aggregations of over a thousand. However, 20 to 150 individuals are more commonly observed. Studies have shown that this species often forms small long-term social units made up of around 8-12 individuals. Genetic investigations of the pilot whales driven ashore in the Faroese hunts have shown a relatedness amongst whales, suggesting a matrilineal structure within social units. This means that calves - females and perhaps the males as well - remain with their mothers for life.

These groups have been observed socializing with common bottlenose dolphins, Atlantic white-sided dolphins and Risso&#x27;s dolphins. Pilot whales mainly feed on cephalopods, though in certain regions fish may be more prominent in their diet. Northwestern Atlantic whales are thought to dine predominately on short-finned squid.

Long-finned pilot whales can often be seen lobtailing and spyhopping. Occasionally they may also breach. This species is notorious for mass strandings. During a specific time of year, approximately December to March, these whales beach themselves in high numbers along the coast of New Zealand. The reasons for stranding are not fully understood, but because pilot whales have strong social bonds, it is hypothesized that when one animal strands, the rest of the group may have the tendency to follow.

These whales have also been observed babysitting calves that are not their own, with one study showing that many of those doing the babysitting are males.

===Communication===
Long-finned pilot whales make many different kinds of sounds. In addition to squeaks, whistles, buzzes, and other calls likely used for communicative functions, they also produce rapid clicks that function as a type of bio sonar known as echolocation. This allows the whales to &quot;see&quot; in the murky, dark environments that they live in by listening to the nature of the echoes that return.

The whistles and pulsed calls that pilot whales make seem not to fall into distinct types, but rather can be arranged on a continuum. These calls are produced in a wide frequency range, which has been observed from less than 1 kHz to about 20 kHz.

Recent studies have found that a large portion of their vocal repertoire is made up of calls produced in repeated sequences. These repetitions are more commonly heard when whales are socializing than any other behavioral state (e.g. foraging, traveling, and resting).

===Decision-making===
During the deeper collective dives of groups of long-finned pilot whales, females on the right and left flanks (periphery) are found to lead most often. This may function in a similar fashion to what is observed in cattle drives, where flanking riders are important for maintaining cohesion of the herd of cattle. The study also found that both mature males and juveniles can lead these dives, but that they do so far less often.

===Diet===
Long-finned pilot whales are apex predators, preying on various species of squid, octopus, crustaceans and fish. Examples of fish species recorded as prey include Lanternfish, Atlantic herring, Silver hake, Atlantic mackerel and Spiny dogfish.

===Reproduction===
Females reach sexual maturity at about 8 years of age, while males reach sexual maturity at around 12 years of age.
It seems that mating can take place at any time during the year, but it peaks in late spring/early summer for both northern and southern hemisphere populations. Mating is thought to occur when different groups meet up, and breeding within units is a rare occurrence.

Gestation lasts approximately 12 to 16 months and calving occurs once every 3 to 6 years. Calves are generally at birth, and weigh about . Most calves are born in the summer, though some calving occurs throughout the year. There is evidence that some males may stay with their mothers after they reach sexual maturity.

===Parasites===
Among other parasites, long-finned pilot whales harbour &quot;Crassicauda carbonelli&quot;, a species of nematodes which is found exclusively in the penis.

==Distribution and abundance==

===Abundance===
Though long-finned pilot whales appear to be abundant, there have been no recent reliable estimates for the worldwide population and very little long-term baseline data collected for monitoring population trends. However, based on their apparent abundance and what information is available, they are currently listed by the IUCN as &quot;Least Concern.&quot; Conservative estimates for the population found off Newfoundland estimated around 13,000 individuals. Another study estimated a total of 780,000 animals in the North Atlantic, though this study includes both short and long-finned pilot whales as they are hard to distinguish at sea.

===Current distribution===
Long-finned pilot whales are found in the North Atlantic (subspecies &quot;Globicephala melas melas&quot;), as well as the Southern Hemisphere (subspecies &quot;Globicephala melas edwardii&quot;). Those in the north are wide-ranging and have been observed off the coast of the eastern U.S. and Canada, across the Atlantic in places such as the Azores and the Faroe Islands, as well as down the western coast of Europe all the way to the Strait of Gibraltar and North Africa. In the southern ocean, long-finned pilot whales are thought to range from 19 to 60° S, but are commonly seen in the Antarctic Convergence Zone and other areas, showing that they go as far as 68° S. This species has been observed near sea ice in the Antarctic.

===Historical distribution===
Though there are only two recognized living subspecies, there was once a third that was found in the western North Pacific around Japan. These are thought to have died off sometime between the 8th and 12th century. This unnamed form was documented in historical literature and confirmed by the discovery of fossils in several locations of Japan, such as on Rebun Island and in Chiba Prefecture. Their biological niche after the extinction has likely been refilled by short-finned pilot whales, who are currently present in parts of this region.

== Antagonistic interactions with other species==

Pilot whales have been occasionally observed harassing, mobbing or chasing other species of cetaceans.

===Orcas===

Chases of orcas have been documented in several parts of the world, including Iceland and the Strait of Gibraltar. It is thought that this might be due to either competition for prey or an anti-predation strategy by the long-finned pilot whales. Recently, an adult female Icelandic orca was observed with a newborn pilot whale travelling alongside her in a mother-calf position, leading to speculation that the relationship between both species might be far more complex than previously suggested. This same orca was seen a year later interacting with a larger group of pilot whales. Whether this newborn calf was adopted or abducted is unknown.

Based on experimentation involving familiar sounds of Orcas that consume fish and unfamiliar vocalizations of mammal-hunting Killer Whales, one study suggests that long-finned pilot whales can distinguish between familiar and unaccustomed types of Orca, noting behavioral differences like the ceasing of feeding when mammal-hunting Orcas&#x27; sounds were played. The study suggests that antagonistic interactions against fish-eating Killer Whales could either be an anti-predatory behavior or an attempt to maintain territory, while actions done in response to mammal-hunting Killer Whales could be a response to a more dangerous threat. 

==Strandings==

===Mass strandings===
Long-finned pilot whales are the most common species involved in mass strandings. The largest event consisted of 1,000 whales on the Chatham Islands in 1918. Though mass strandings of this species are most common in New Zealand, pilot whales have beached themselves in many other countries in places such as northern Europe, the Atlantic coast of North America, South America, and southern parts of Africa.

Over 600 pilot whales were involved in a stranding at Farewell Spit, New Zealand on February 9, 2017. This was the second largest mass stranding event to be documented.

===Research from strandings===
Scientists have learned a number of important things from mass strandings of long-finned pilot whales around the world. Studies suggest that they do not always beach together in family units, as multiple matrilines can be found in a single stranding event.

==Conservation==

===Current conservation status===
The North Sea and Baltic Sea populations of the long-finned pilot whale are listed on Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS), since they have an unfavourable conservation status or would benefit significantly from international co-operation organised by tailored agreements.

The long-finned pilot whale is also covered by the Agreement on the Conservation of Small Cetaceans of the Baltic, North East Atlantic, Irish and North Seas (ASCOBANS), the Agreement on the Conservation of Cetaceans in the Black Sea, Mediterranean Sea and Contiguous Atlantic Area (ACCOBAMS), the Memorandum of Understanding for the Conservation of Cetaceans and Their Habitats in the Pacific Islands Region (Pacific Cetaceans MoU) and the Memorandum of Understanding Concerning the Conservation of the Manatee and Small Cetaceans of Western Africa and Macaronesia (Western African Aquatic Mammals MoU).

===Whaling===

Whaling of this species in the Faroe Islands in the North Atlantic has been practiced since the time of the first Norse settlements there. The hunts, called &quot;grindadráp&quot; in Faroese, are mainly executed during the summer. They are generally regarded as non-commercial - though people may sell their share after the catch has been divided - and organized on a community level. The hunters first surround the pilot whales with a wide semicircle of many boats. The boats then drive the pilot whales into a bay or to the bottom of a fjord. It is regulated by Faroese authorities but not by the International Whaling Commission, which does not regulate the hunts of small cetaceans. As of the end of November 2008 the chief medical officers of the Faroe Islands have recommended that pilot whales no longer be considered fit for human consumption because of the level of mercury in the whales.

Though the Faroe Islands are home to the only remaining large scale long-finned pilot whale hunts in the world, this species has also been hunted historically elsewhere. An industrial drive fishery was started in the Trinity Bay area of Newfoundland, Canada in 1947 by a Norwegian whaling captain. The catches increased every year until in 1956, there were approximately 10,000 pilot whales successfully captured and killed. This species was also historically hunted along the New England coastline.

Aside from the Faroe Islands, a few pilot whales are taken opportunistically in Greenland each year.

===Tourism===
Long-finned pilot whales are economically important in the whale-watching industry of some areas of the world, especially in eastern Canada. Even though there are a number of other species of whales found in the Gulf of the St. Lawrence and around Newfoundland, pilots are one of the more common ones sighted inshore during the summer season. The tour vessels used in these regions are normally old converted fishing vessels or zodiacs. In these places, pilot whales provide valuable income for people living in rural fishing communities.

The effects of whale-watching on long-finned pilot whales have not been well studied.

== Museum specimens ==
The articulated skeleton of a long-finned pilot whale, killed in the Firth of Forth in 1867, was put on display at Leeds City Museum, UK in 2019.

<text>Pilot whales are cetaceans belonging to the genus Globicephala. The two extant species are the long-finned pilot whale (&quot;G. melas&quot;) and the short-finned pilot whale (&quot;G. macrorhynchus&quot;). The two are not readily distinguishable at sea, and analysis of the skulls is the best way to distinguish between the species. Between the two species, they range nearly worldwide, with long-finned pilot whales living in colder waters and short-finned pilot whales living in tropical and subtropical waters. Pilot whales are among the largest of the oceanic dolphins, exceeded in size only by the orca. They and other large members of the dolphin family are also known as blackfish.

Pilot whales feed primarily on squid, but will also hunt large demersal fish such as cod and turbot. They are highly social and may remain with their birth throughout their lifetime. Short-finned pilot whales are one of the few non-primate mammal species in which females go through menopause, and postreproductive females continue to contribute to their pod. Pilot whales are notorious for stranding themselves on beaches, but the reason behind this is not fully understood. Marine biologists have shed some light on the matter, suggesting that it is due to the mammals inner ear (their principal navigational sonar) being damaged from noise pollution in the ocean, such as from cargo ships or military exercises. The conservation status of short-finned and long-finned pilot whales has been determined to be least concern.

==Naming==
The animals were named &quot;pilot whales&quot; because pods were believed to be &quot;piloted&quot; by a leader. They are also called &quot;pothead whales&quot; and &quot;blackfish&quot;. The genus name is a combination of the Latin word &quot;globus&quot; (&quot;round ball&quot; or &quot;globe&quot;) and the Greek word &quot;Kephale&quot; (&quot;head&quot;).

==Taxonomy and evolution==

Pilot whales are classified into two species; the long-finned pilot whale (&quot;Globicephala melas&quot;) and the short-finned pilot whale (&quot;G. macrorhynchus&quot;). The short-finned pilot whale was described, from skeletal materials only, by John Edward Gray in 1846. He presumed from the skeleton that the whale had a large beak. The long-finned pilot whale was first classified by Thomas Stewart Traill in 1809 as &quot;Delphinus melas&quot;. Its scientific name was eventually changed to &quot;Globicephala melaena&quot;. Since 1986, the specific name of the long-finned pilot whale was changed to its original form &quot;melas&quot;. Other species classifications have been proposed but only two have been accepted. There exist geographic forms of short-finned pilot whales off the east coast of Japan, which comprise genetically isolated stocks.

Fossils of an extinct relative, &quot;Globicephala baereckeii&quot;, have been found in Pleistocene deposits in Florida. Another &quot;Globicephala&quot; dolphin was discovered in Pliocene strata in Tuscany, Italy, and was named &quot;G. etruriae&quot;. Evolution of &quot;Tappanaga&quot;, the endemic, larger form of short-finned pilots found in northern Japan, with similar characteristics to the whales found along Vancouver Island and northern USA coasts, has indicated that the geniture of this form could be caused by the extinction of long-finned pilots in north Pacific in the 12th century, where &quot;Magondou&quot;, the smaller, southern type possibly filled the former niches of long-finned pilots, adapting and colonizing into colder waters.

==Description==

Pilot whales are mostly dark grey, brown, or black, but have some light areas such as a grey saddle patch behind the dorsal fin. Other light areas are an anchor-shaped patch under the chin, a faint blaze marking behind the eye, a large marking on the belly, and a genital patch. The dorsal fin is set forward on the back and sweeps backwards. A pilot whale is more robust than most dolphins and has a distinctive large, bulbous melon. Pilot whales&#x27; long, sickle-shaped flippers and tail stocks are flattened from side to side. Male long-finned pilot whales develop more circular melons than females, although this does not seem to be the case for short-finned pilot whales off the Pacific coast of Japan.
Long-finned and short-finned pilot whales are so similar, it is difficult to tell the two species apart. They were traditionally differentiated by the length of the pectoral flippers relative to total body length and the number of teeth. The long-finned pilot whale was thought to have 9–12 teeth in each row and flippers one-fifth of total body length, compared to the short-finned pilot whale with its 7–9 teeth in each row and flippers one-sixth of total body length. Studies of whales in the Atlantic showed much overlap in these characteristics between the species, making them clines instead of distinctive features. Thus, biologists have since used skull differences to distinguish the two species.

The size and weight depend on the species, as long-finned pilot whales are generally larger than short-finned pilot whales. Their lifespans are about 45 years in males and 60 years in females for both species. Both species exhibit sexual dimorphism. Adult long-finned pilot whales reach a body length of approximately 6.5 m, with males being 1 m longer than females. Their body mass reaches up to 1,300 kg in females and up to 2,300 kg in males. For short-finned pilot whales, adult females reach a body length of about 5.5 m, while males reach 7.2 m and may weigh up to 3,200 kg.

==Distribution and habitat==

Pilot whales can be found in oceans nearly worldwide, but data about current population sizes is deficient. The long-finned pilot whale prefers slightly cooler waters than the short-finned and is divided into two populations. The smaller group is found in a circumpolar band in the Southern Ocean from about 20 to 65°S. It may be sighted off the coasts of Chile, Argentina, South Africa, Australia, and New Zealand. An estimated more than 200,000 individuals were in this population in 2006. The second, much larger, population inhabits the North Atlantic Ocean, in a band from South Carolina in the United States across to the Azores and Morocco at its southern edge and from Newfoundland to Greenland, Iceland, and northern Norway at its northern limit. This population was estimated at 778,000 individuals in 1989. It is also present in the western half of the Mediterranean Sea.

The short-finned pilot whale is less populous. It is found in temperate and tropical waters of the Indian, Atlantic and Pacific Oceans. Its population overlaps slightly with the long-finned pilot whale in the temperate waters of the North Atlantic and Southern Oceans. About 150,000 individuals are found in the eastern tropical Pacific Ocean. More than 30,000 animals are estimated in the western Pacific, off the coast of Japan. Pilot whales are generally nomadic, but some populations stay year-round in places such as Hawaii and parts of California. They prefer the waters of the shelf break and slope. Once commonly seen off of Southern California, short-finned pilot whales disappeared from the area after a strong El Niño year in the early 1980s, according to the National Oceanic and Atmospheric Administration. In October 2014, crew and passengers on several boats spotted a pod of 50–200 off Dana Point, California.

==Behavior and life history==
===Foraging and parasites===

Although pilot whales are not known to have many predators, possible threats come from humans and killer whales. 
Both species eat primarily squid. The whales make seasonal inshore and offshore movements in response to the dispersal of their prey. Fish that are consumed include Atlantic cod, Greenland turbot, Atlantic mackerel, Atlantic herring, hake, and spiny dogfish in the northwest Atlantic. In the Faroe Islands, whales mostly eat squid, but will also eat fish species such as greater argentine and blue whiting. However, Faroe whales do not seem to feed on cod, herring, or mackerel, even when they are abundant.

Pilot whales generally take several breaths before diving for a few minutes. Feeding dives may last over ten minutes. They are capable of diving to depths of 600 meters, but most dives are to a depth of 30–60 m. Shallow dives tend to take place during the day, while deeper ones take place at night. When making deep dives, pilot whales often make fast sprints to catch fast-moving prey such as squid. Compared to sperm whales and beaked whales, foraging short-finned pilot whales are more energetic at the same depth. When they reach the end of their dives, pilot whales will sprint, possibly to catch prey, and then make a few buzzes. This is unusual, considering that deep-diving, breath-holding animals would be expected to swim slowly to conserve oxygen. The animal&#x27;s high metabolism possibly allows it to sprint at deep depths, which would also give it shorter diving periods than some other marine mammals. This may also be the case for long-finned pilot whales. In 2024, a gps-fitted long-finned pilot whale recorded a diving depth over 1,100 meters.

Pilot whales are often infested with whale lice, cestodes, and nematodes. They also can be hosts to various pathogenic bacteria and viruses, such as &quot;Streptococcus&quot;, &quot;Pseudomonas&quot;, &quot;Escherichia&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus&quot;, and influenza. One sample of Newfoundland pilot whales found that the most common illness was an upper respiratory tract infection.

===Social structure===

Both species live in groups of 10–30, but some groups may number 100 or more. Data suggest the social structures of pilot whale pods are similar to those of &quot;resident&quot; killer whales. The pods are highly stable and the members have close matrilineal relationships. Pod members are of various age and sex classes, although adult females tend to outnumber adult males. They have been observed making various kin-directed behaviors, such as providing food. Numerous pods will temporarily gather, perhaps to allow individuals from different pods to interact and mate, as well as provide protection.

Both species are loosely polygynous. Data suggest both males and females remain in their mother&#x27;s pod for life; despite this, inbreeding within a pod does not seem to occur. During aggregations, males will temporarily leave their pods to mate with females from other pods. Male reproductive dominance or competition for mates does not seem to exist. After mating, a male pilot whale usually spends only a few months with a female, and an individual may sire several offspring in the same pod. Males return to their own pods when the aggregations disband, and their presence may contribute to the survival of the other pod members. No evidence of &quot;bachelor&quot; groups has been found.
Pilot whale pods off southern California have been observed in three different groups: traveling/hunting groups, feeding groups and loafing groups. In traveling/hunting groups, individuals position themselves in chorus lines stretching two miles long, with only a few whales underneath. Sexual and age-class segregation apparently occurs in these groups. In feeding groups, individuals are very loosely associated, but may move in the same direction. In loafing groups, whales number between 12 and 30 individuals resting. Mating and other behaviors may take place.

===Reproduction and lifecycle===
Pilot whales have one of the longest birth intervals of the cetaceans, calving once every three to five years. Most matings and calvings occur during the summer for long-finned pilot whales. For short-finned pilot whales of the Southern Hemisphere, births are at their highest in spring and autumn, while in Northern Hemisphere, the time in which calving peaks can vary by population. For long-finned pilot whales, gestation lasts 12–16 months, and short-finned pilot whales have a 15-month gestation period.

The calf nurses for 36–42 months, allowing for extensive mother-calf bonds. Young pilot whales will take milk until as old as 13–15 years of age. Short-finned pilot whale females will go through menopause, but this is not as common in females of long-finned pilot whales. Postreproductive females possibly play important roles in the survival of the young. Postreproductive females will continue to lactate and nurse young. Since they can no longer bear young of their own, these females invest in the current young, allowing them to feed even though they are not their own. Short-finned pilot whales grow more slowly than long-finned pilot whales. For the short-finned pilot whale, females become sexually mature at 9 years old and males at about 13–16 years. For the long-finned pilot whale, females reach maturity at around eight years and males at around 12 years.

===Vocalizations===

Pilot whales emit echolocation clicks for foraging and whistles and burst pulses as social signals (e.g. to keep contact with members of their pod). With active behavior, vocalizations are more complex, while less-active behavior is accompanied by simple vocalizations. Differences have been found in the calls of the two species. Compared with short-finned pilot whales, long-finned pilot whales have relatively low-frequency calls with narrow frequency ranges. In one study of North Atlantic long-finned pilot whales, certain vocalizations were heard to accompany certain behaviors. When resting or &quot;milling&quot;, simple whistles are emitted. Surfacing behavior is accompanied by more complex whistles and pulsed sounds. The number of whistles made increases with the number of subgroups and the distance in which the whales are spread apart. 

A study of short-finned pilot whales off the southwest coast of Tenerife in the Canary Islands has found the members of a pod maintained contact with each other through call repertoires unique to their pod. A later study found, when foraging at around 800 m deep, short-finned pilot whales make tonal calls. The number and length of the calls seem to decrease with depth despite being farther away from conspecifics at the surface. As such, the surrounding water pressure affects the energy of the calls, but it does not appear to affect the frequency levels.

When in stressful situations, pilot whales produce &quot;shrills&quot; or &quot;plaintive cries&quot;, which are variations of their whistles. To elude predators, long-finned pilot whales off the southern coast of Australia have been observed to mimic the calls of orcas while scavenging for food. This behaviour is thought to deter orca pods from approaching the pilot whales.

===Antagonistic interactions with other species===

Pilot whales have been occasionally observed mobbing or chasing other species of cetaceans. In several parts of the world, including off Iceland, long-finned pilot whales have been frequently documented chasing killer whales. The reasons for these chases are unknown, but it has been proposed that they might be due to either competition for prey or an anti-predation strategy. In 2021 an adult female killer whale with a newborn pilot whale travelling alongside her was observed off Western Iceland, leading scientists to question whether the relationship between these species might be far more complex than previously suggested. It is not known whether the newborn was adopted or abducted, but this same female killer whale was seen a year later interacting with a larger group of pilot whales.

Based on experimentation involving familiar sounds of Orcas that consume fish and unfamiliar vocalizations of mammal-hunting Killer Whales, one study suggests that long-finned pilot whales can distinguish between familiar and unaccustomed types of Orca, noting behavioral differences like the ceasing of feeding when mammal-hunting Orcas&#x27; sounds were played. The study suggests that antagonistic interactions against fish-eating Killer Whales could either be an anti-predatory behavior or an attempt to maintain territory, while actions done in response to mammal-hunting Killer Whales could be a response to a more dangerous threat. 

===Stranding===
Of the cetaceans, pilot whales are among the most common stranders. Because of their strong social bonds, whole groups of pilot whales will strand. Single stranders have been recorded and these are usually diseased. Group stranding tends to be of mostly healthy individuals. Several hypotheses have been proposed to explain group strandings. When using magnetic fields for navigation, the whales have been suggested to get perplexed by geomagnetic anomalies or they may be following a sick member of their group that got stranded. The pod also may be following a member of high importance that got stranded and a secondary social response makes them keep returning. Researchers from New Zealand have successfully used secondary social responses to keep a stranding pod of long-finned pilot whales from returning to the beach. In addition, the young members of the pod were taken offshore to buoys, and their distress calls lured the older whales back out to sea.

In September 2022, nearly 200 pilot whales died after becoming stranded on Ocean Beach, part of Tasmania&#x27;s west coast. Authorities said only about 35 survived of the 230 that were stranded.

==Human interaction==
The IUCN lists long-finned pilot whales as &quot;least concern&quot; in the Red List of Threatened Species. Long-finned pilot whales in the North and Baltic Seas are listed in Appendix II of the Convention on the Conservation of Migratory Species of Wild Animals (CMS). Those from northwest and northeast Atlantic may also need to be included to Appendix II of CMS. The short-finned pilot whale is listed on Appendix II of CITES.

===Hunting===
The long-finned pilot whale has traditionally been hunted by &quot;driving&quot;, which involves many hunters and boats gathering in a semicircle behind a pod of whales close to shore, and slowly driving them towards a bay, where they become stranded and are then slaughtered. This practice was common in both the 19th and 20th centuries. The whales were hunted for bone, meat, oil, and fertilizer. In the Faroe Islands, pilot whale hunting started at least in the 16th century, and continued into modern times, with thousands being killed during the 1970s and 1980s. In other parts of the North Atlantic, such as Norway, West Greenland, Ireland and Cape Cod, pilot whales have also been hunted, but to a lesser extent. One fishery at Cape Cod harvested 2,000–3,000 whales per year during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Newfoundland&#x27;s long-finned pilot whale fishery was at its highest in 1956, but declined shortly after and is now defunct. In the Southern Hemisphere, exploitation of long-finned pilot whales has been sporadic and low. Currently, long-finned pilot whales are only hunted at the Faroe Islands and Greenland.

According to the IUCN the harvesting of this species for food in the Faroe Islands and Greenland has not resulted in any detectable declines in abundance.

The short-finned pilot whale has also been hunted for many centuries, particularly by Japanese whalers. Between 1948 and 1980, hundreds of whales were exploited at Hokkaido and Sanriku in the north and Taiji, Izu, and Okinawa in the south. These fisheries were at their highest in the late 1940s and early 1950s; 2,326 short-finned pilot whales were harvested in the mid- to late 1980s. This had decreased to about 400 per year by the 1990s.

Pilot whales have also fallen victim to bycatches. In one year, around 30 short-finned pilot whales were caught by the squid round-haul fishery in southern California. Likewise, California&#x27;s drift gill net fishery took around 20 whales a year in the mid-1990s. In 1988, 141 whales caught on the east coast of the U.S. were taken by the foreign Atlantic mackerel fishery, which forced it to be shut down.

===Pollution===
As with other marine mammals, pilot whales are susceptible to certain pollutants. Off the Faroes, France, the UK, and the eastern US, pilot whales were found to have been contaminated with high amounts of DDT and PCB. Pollutants such as DDT and mercury can be passed from mothers to their babies during gestation and lactation. The Faroes whales have also been contaminated with cadmium and mercury. However, pilot whales from Newfoundland and Tasmania were found to have had very low levels of DDT. Short-finned pilot whales off the west coast of the US have had high amounts of DDT and PCB in contrast to the low amounts found in whales from Japan and the Antilles.

===Cuisine===

Pilot whale meat is available for consumption in very few areas of Japan, mainly along the central Pacific coast, and also in other areas of the world, such as the Faroe Islands. The meat is high in protein (higher than beef) and low in fat. Because a whale&#x27;s fat is contained in the layer of blubber beneath the skin, and the muscle is high in myoglobin, the meat is a dark shade of red. In Japan, where pilot whale meat can be found in certain restaurants and &quot;izakayas&quot;, the meat is sometimes served raw, as &quot;sashimi&quot;, but just as often pilot whale steaks are marinated, cut into small chunks, and grilled. When grilled, the meat is slightly flaky and quite flavorful, somewhat gamey, though similar to a quality cut of beef, with distinct yet subtle undertones recalling its marine origin.

In both Japan and the Faroe Islands, the meat is contaminated with mercury and cadmium, causing a health risk for those who frequently eat it, especially children and pregnant women. In November 2008, an article in &quot;New Scientist&quot; reported that research done on the Faroe Islands resulted in two chief medical officers recommending against the consumption of pilot whale meat, considering it to be too toxic. In 2008, the local authorities recommended that pilot whale meat should no longer be eaten due to the contamination. This has resulted in reduced consumption, according to a senior Faroese health official.

===Captivity===

Pilot whales, mostly short-finned pilot whales, have been kept in captivity in various marine parks, arguably starting in the late 1940s. Since 1973, some long-finned pilot whales from New England waters were taken and temporarily kept in captivity. Short-finned pilot whales off southern California, Hawaii and Japan have been kept in aquariums and oceanariums. Several pilot whales from southern California and Hawaii were taken into captivity during the 1960s and early 1970s, two of which were placed at SeaWorld San Diego. During the 1970s and early 1980s, six pilot whales were captured alive by drive hunts and taken for public display. 

Pilot whales have historically had low survival rates in captivity, with the average annual survival being 0.51 years during the mid-1960s to early 1970s. There have been a few exceptions to the rule. Bubbles, a female short-finned pilot whale, who was displayed in Marineland of the Pacific and eventually at Sea World California, lived to be somewhere in her 50s when she eventually died on 12 June 2016.
In 1968, a pilot whale was captured, given the name Morgan, and trained by the U.S. Navy&#x27;s Deep Ops to retrieve deeper-attached objects from the ocean floor. He dove a record depth of 1654 feet and was used for training until 1971.

===Films===
There are two documentaries entirely dedicated to the pilot whales.

* Full-length &quot;Cheetahs of the deep&quot; (49’, 2014, directed by Rafa Herrero Massieu) — tells about the way of life, features of social interaction, the subtleties of hunting, games and breeding on the example of a group of non-migrating short-finned pilot whales living between the Islands of Tenerife and La Gomera of the Canary archipelago. A curious feature of the film is that: “all marine mammals filmed in freediving”.

* Short film &quot;My Pilot, Whale&quot; (28’, 2014, directed by Alexander and Nicole Gratovsky) demonstrates the possibility of interaction between humans and free-living pilot whales, offering the viewer a number of philosophical questions related to cetaceans: about their attitude to the world, what we have in common, what we — humans — can learn from them, and so on. The film has received a number awards of international film festivals.

<text>Sakhalin Oblast () is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast) comprising the island of Sakhalin and the Kuril Islands in the Russian Far East. The oblast has an area of . Its administrative center and largest city is Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk. As of the 2021 Census, the oblast has a population of 466,609.

The vast majority of the oblast&#x27;s residents are ethnic Russians, with a small minority of Sakhalin Koreans. Sakhalin Oblast is rich in natural gas and oil, and is Russia&#x27;s second wealthiest federal subject after the Tyumen Oblast. It borders by sea Khabarovsk Krai to the west and Kamchatka Krai to the north, along with Hokkaido, Japan to the south.

==History==
The etymology of Sakhalin can be traced back to the Manchu hydronym &quot;Sahaliyan Ula&quot; (Manchu: ) for &quot;Black River&quot; (&quot;i.e.&quot; the Amur River). Sakhalin shares this etymology with the Chinese province of Heilongjiang (Chinese for &quot;black dragon river (Chinese: 黑龍江, Hēilóngjiāng)&quot;).

The indigenous people of Sakhalin are the Nivkh, Orok, and Ainu minorities.

The first Europeans to explore the waters around Sakhalin Island were Ivan Moskvitin and Martin Gerritz de Vries in the mid-1600s, Jean-François de La Pérouse in 1787 and Adam Johann von Krusenstern in 1805. Early maps of Sakhalin reflect the uncertainty of the age as to whether or not the land mass was attached to the Asian continent. The fact that it is not connected was conclusively established by Mamiya Rinzō, who explored and mapped Sakhalin in 1809 and definitively recorded by Russian navigator Gennady Nevelskoy in 1849.

Japanese settlement on Sakhalin dates to at least the Edo period. Ōtomari was supposedly established in 1679, and cartographers of the Matsumae domain mapped the island, and named it &quot;Kita-Ezo&quot;. During the Ming and Qing dynasties China considered the island part of its empire, and included the Sakhalin peoples in its &quot;system for subjugated peoples&quot;. At no time though was any attempt ever made to establish an Imperial military presence on the island. Japan, concerned about Russian expansion in northeast Asia, unilaterally proclaimed sovereignty over the whole island in 1845. Russian settlers ignored the claim (and the similar claim of China), however, and, beginning in the 1850s, established coal mines, administration facilities, schools, prisons and churches on the island.

In 1855, Russia and Japan signed the Treaty of Shimoda, which declared that both nationals could inhabit the island: Russians in the north, and Japanese in the south, without a clear boundary between. Russia also agreed to dismantle its military base at Ōtomari. Following the Second Opium War, Russia forced the Qing to sign the Treaty of Aigun and Convention of Peking, under which China lost all territories north of Heilongjiang (Amur) and east of Ussuri, including Sakhalin, to Russia. A Czarist penal colony was established in 1857, but the southern part of the island was held by the Japanese until the 1875 Treaty of Saint Petersburg, when they ceded it to Russia in exchange for the Kuril islands. After the Russo-Japanese War, Russia and Japan signed the Treaty of Portsmouth of 1905, which resulted in the southern part of the island below 50° N passing to Japan; the Russians retained the other three-fifths of the area. South Sakhalin was administered by Japan as Karafuto-chō (樺太庁), with the capital Toyohara, now known as Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk.

After the Russian Revolution and subsequent civil war northern Sakhalin ultimately became governed by the Russian SFSR as a part of Far Eastern Oblast (1922–1926), Far Eastern Krai (1926–1938) and Khabarovsk Krai (included Russian-administered territories of Sakhalin in 1938–1947). Sakhalin Oblast was established on 20 October 1932 as a part of Far Eastern Krai, and became part of Khabarovsk Krai upon the latter foundation in 1938.

===World War II===

In August 1945, the Soviet Union took over the control of the entire Sakhalin and Kuril Islands. The Soviet attack on South Sakhalin started on August 11, 1945, about a month before the Surrender of Japan in World War II. The 56th Rifle Corps consisting of the 79th Rifle Division, the 2nd Rifle Brigade, the 5th Rifle Brigade and the 214th Tank Brigade attacked the Japanese 88th Division. Although the Red Army outnumbered the Japanese by three times, they could not advance due to strong Japanese resistance. It was not until the 113th Rifle Brigade and the 365th Independent Naval Infantry Rifle Battalion from Sovietskaya Gavan (Советская Гавань) landed on Tōrō (塔路), a seashore village of western Sakhalin on August 16 that the Soviets broke the Japanese defense line. Japanese resistance grew weaker after this landing. Actual fighting continued until August 21. However, this was relatively limited in scope. From August 22 to August 23, most of the remaining Japanese units set truce agreements with the Soviet Army. The Soviets completed the conquest of Sakhalin on August 25, 1945, by occupying the capital of Sakhalin, then known as Toyohara. Japanese sources claim that 20,000 civilians were killed during the invasion.

===Post-war===
Soviet-conquered areas of South Sakhalin and Kuril Islands were declared a South Sakhalin Oblast by the Soviet authorities in a decree issued on 2 February 1946. Almost a year later, on January 2, 1947, the South Sakhalin Oblast was disbanded and included into Sakhalin Oblast, forming present-day boundary of the latter. On the same day Sakhalin Oblast was excluded from Khabarovsk Krai. The Japanese who had been living there before mostly repatriated to Japan, but at least one-third of Koreans were refused repatriation; stuck on the island, they and their descendants became known as the Sakhalin Koreans. The Karafuto Prefecture was abolished by Japan as a legal entity on June 1, 1949.

The Treaty of San Francisco (1952) provides, that Japan renounces &quot;all right, title and claim to the Kurile Islands, and to that portion of Sakhalin and the islands adjacent to it over which Japan acquired sovereignty as a consequence of the Treaty of Portsmouth of September 5, 1905&quot;. However, the status of the southern Kuril Islands remains disputed, as Japan does not consider them to be a part of the Kuril Islands (calling them &quot;Northern Territories&quot; instead) and, thus, claims sovereignty over them as &quot;unaffected&quot; by the 1952 renunciation. The issue remains a major strain on Japanese-Russian relations. Even now, no official peace treaty has been signed between the two nations.

In addition, because the treaty did not explicitly specify cession of the renounced areas to the Soviet Union, Japan officially considers South Sakhalin and northern Kuril Islands to be a territories of undetermined ownership and these areas are marked as No Man&#x27;s Land with white color on Japanese maps, although Japan currently has a Consulate-General in Sakhalin&#x27;s capital city of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk, located on the renounced territory.

On September 1, 1983, the Soviets downed Korean Air Lines Flight 007, carrying 269 occupants, including U.S. Congressman Larry McDonald, west of Sakhalin Island near the smaller Moneron Island.

In 1995 the 7.0 Neftegorsk earthquake shook the former settlement of Neftegorsk with a maximum Mercalli intensity of IX (&quot;Violent&quot;). Total damage was $64.1–300 million, with 1,989 deaths and 750 injured. The settlement was not rebuilt. On 24 April 1996 Sakhalin Oblast, alongside Rostov Oblast, signed a power-sharing agreement with the federal government, granting it autonomy. This agreement would be abolished on 4 March 2002.

===Post-war population===
According to the first post World War II Soviet Census in 1959, the population of the oblast numbered 649,405. That figure dropped slightly to 615,652 in 1970 before rising to 661,778 in 1979 and peaking at 710,242 in 1989. Throughout this time period, the Russian population increased slightly in percentage from 77.7% in 1959 to 81.6% in 1989. Following the collapse of the Soviet Union in 1991, the population of the oblast has declined sharply. Compared with the Soviet 1989 Census, the population of the Oblast according to the Russian 2002 Census had declined by 163,547 or 23.0%, to 546,695. The 2010 population of 497,973 recorded in 2010 is the lowest on record since the oblast was created, although the decline was less (8.9%) than during the 1990s.

====Ainu====
As of the 2002 census, 333 residents of the oblast still identified themselves as ethnic Japanese.

Most of the 888 Japanese people living in Russia (2010 Census) are also of mixed Japanese-Ainu ancestry, although they do not acknowledge it (full Japanese ancestry gives them the right of visa-free entry to Japan).

===Oil, gas, and coal===
Several Russian, French, South Korean, British, Canadian and American oil and gas companies have been either drilling or prospecting for oil and gas on the island since the mid-1990s. Coal and some manganese had been mined there by the Soviet authorities since the 1920s.

==Politics==

The governor Alexander Khoroshavin was appointed on August 9, 2007. He was succeeded by Oleg Kozhemyako on March 25, 2015, in 2018 he was replaced by Valery Limarenko.

==Administrative divisions==
==Tourism==
Due to restrictions, the entire Sakhalin Oblast and its internal and territorial waters except for Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk are considered to be a border zone, which means that the freedom of movement for foreigners is dramatically restricted and any movement outside of Yuzhno-Sakhalinsk requires registration to the Federal Security Service (FSB) and the Border Guard. Scuba diving and recreation on the seacoast is permitted only in places defined by the Border Guard.

==Demographics==
Population: According to the 2021 census, there were 466,609 people residing in Sakhalin oblast. The population density was 5.4 inhabitants per square kilometre (14/sq mi). 82.4% lived in urban areas. The annual population growth stood at −0.6% (2010-21).
Vital statistics for 2024:
*Births: 4,472 (9.8 per 1,000)
*Deaths: 6,477 (14.2 per 1,000)

Total fertility rate (2024): 
1.73 children per woman

Life expectancy (2021): 
Total — 68.42 years (male — 63.72, female — 73.41)

Ethnic groups:

Most inhabitants are descendants of Russian and other Slavic settlers. The indigenous Ainu people have historically inhabited the southern part of Sakhalin Island, with only a small number remaining today. The Ainu are not recognized as a separate ethnic group in the Russian census, making it difficult to estimate their total population. Another indigenous group, the Nivkh people, live mainly in the north of the island and amount for roughly 2,000 people. There exists a notable minority of Sakhalin Koreans, who can trace their roots to the immigrants from the Gyeongsang and Jeolla provinces of Korea during the late 1930s and early 1940s, the latter half of the Japanese ruling era. After the Red Army had seized control over southern Sakhalin at the end of WW2, all but a few Japanese there repatriated successfully, while most Koreans could not secure permission to depart either to Japan or their home towns in South Korea. In 2021, there were roughly 16,000 Sakhalin Koreans, down from 25,000 in the 2010 census and 42,000 in the 1959 census. 

=== Religion ===
According to a 2012 survey 21.6% of the population of Sakhalin Oblast adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, 4% are unaffiliated generic Christians, 2% adheres to other Orthodox churches or is an Orthodox believer without belonging to any church, 1% of the population adheres to the Slavic native faith (Rodnovery) or to local Siberian native faiths, 1% adheres to forms of Protestantism. In addition, 37% of the population declares to be &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;, 15% is atheist, and 18.4% follows other religions or did not give an answer to the question.

<text>Eugene Kal Siskel (January 26, 1946 – February 20, 1999) was an American film critic and journalist for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; who co-hosted a movie review television series alongside colleague Roger Ebert.

Siskel started writing for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1969, becoming its film critic soon after. In 1975, he was paired with Roger Ebert to co-host a monthly show called &quot;Opening Soon at a Theater Near You&quot; airing locally on PBS member station WTTW. In 1978, the show, renamed &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;, was expanded to weekly episodes and aired on PBS affiliates across the United States. In 1982, Siskel and Ebert left &quot;Sneak Previews&quot; to create the syndicated show &quot;At the Movies&quot;. Following a contract dispute with Tribune Entertainment in 1986, Siskel and Ebert signed with Buena Vista Television, creating &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot; (renamed &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot; in 1987, and renamed again several times after Siskel&#x27;s death).

Known for their biting wit, intense professional rivalry, heated arguments, and trademark &quot;Thumbs Up or Thumbs Down&quot; movie ratings system, Siskel and Ebert became celebrated in American pop culture. Siskel was diagnosed with brain cancer in May 1998 but remained in the public eye as Ebert&#x27;s professional partner until his death the following year.

== Early life ==
Siskel was born in Chicago on January 26, 1946, the youngest of three children born to Ida (née Kalis) and Nathan William Siskel, who were Russian Jewish immigrants. His father died when he was four and his mother died when he was nine; thereafter, he was raised by his aunt and uncle. He attended Culver Academies, where he experienced anti-Semitism firsthand when a schoolmate gave him a piece of toast on which jam was spread in the shape of a swastika.

Siskel graduated from Yale University with a degree in philosophy in 1967. While at Yale, Siskel was classmates with poet Paul Monette and future New York Governor George Pataki. Siskel studied writing under Pulitzer Prize-winning author John Hersey, whose reference would later help Siskel get a job at the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; in 1969.

== Career ==
=== Writing ===

Siskel&#x27;s first print review, written one month before he became the &quot;Tribune&quot;″s film critic, was for the film &quot;Rascal&quot;. His review of the film was not favorable (&quot;Because of the excessive gimmickry, most kids will miss the tenderness,&quot; he wrote). Prior to this, he served in the U.S. Army Reserve; he was a military journalist and public affairs officer for the Defense Information School. For a time afterwards, he was acquainted with Playboy magazine publisher Hugh Hefner.

In 1986, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; announced that Siskel was no longer the paper&#x27;s film critic, and that his position with the paper had been shifted from that of a full-time film critic to that of a freelance contract writer who was to write about the film industry for the Sunday paper and also provide capsule film reviews for the paper&#x27;s entertainment sections. The demotion occurred after Siskel and Ebert decided to shift production of their weekly movie-review show, then known as &quot;At the Movies&quot; (later known as &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;), from Tribune Entertainment to the Walt Disney Company&#x27;s Buena Vista Television unit. Editor James Squires stated on the move, &quot;He&#x27;s done a great job for us. It&#x27;s a question of how much a person can do physically. We think you need to be a newspaper person first, and Gene Siskel always tried to do that. But there comes a point when a career is so big that you can&#x27;t do that.&quot; Siskel declined to comment on the new arrangement, but Ebert publicly criticized Siskel&#x27;s &quot;Tribune&quot; bosses for punishing Siskel for taking their television program to a company other than Tribune Entertainment. Ebert privately suggested that Siskel join him at the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, but Siskel remained a freelancer for the &quot;Tribune&quot; until his death in 1999. He was replaced as film critic by Dave Kehr.

The last review published by Siskel for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; was for the film &quot;She&#x27;s All That&quot;, published on January 29, 1999, in which he gave a favorable review, giving it three stars out of four and wrote that &quot;Rachael Leigh Cook as Laney, the plain Jane object of the makeover, is forced to demonstrate the biggest emotional range as a character, and she is equal to the assignment. I look forward to seeing her in her next movie.&quot;

=== Siskel &amp; Ebert ===

In 1975, Siskel teamed up with Ebert, film reviewer for the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, to host a show on local Chicago PBS station WTTW which eventually became &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;. Their &quot;thumbs-up, thumbs-down&quot; system soon became an easily recognizable trademark, popular enough to be parodied on comedy shows such as &quot;Second City Television&quot;, &quot;In Living Color&quot;, &quot;Bizarre&quot;, and in movies such as &quot;Hollywood Shuffle&quot; and &quot;Godzilla&quot;. &quot;Sneak Previews&quot; gained a nationwide audience in 1977 when WTTW offered it as a series to the PBS program system.

Siskel and Ebert left WTTW and PBS in 1982 for syndication. Their new show, &quot;At the Movies&quot;, was produced and distributed by Tribune Broadcasting, the parent company of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; and WGN-TV. &quot;Sneak Previews&quot; continued on PBS for 14 more years with other hosts until its cancellation in 1996. In 1986, Siskel and Ebert left Tribune Broadcasting to have their show produced by the syndication arm of the Walt Disney Company. The new incarnation of the show was originally titled &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; the Movies&quot;, but later shortened to &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot;. &quot;At the Movies&quot; also continued for a few more years with other hosts until its cancellation in 1990.

The last five movies Siskel reviewed with Ebert on the show before his death aired during the weekend of January 23–24, 1999. On the show, they reviewed &quot;At First Sight&quot;, &quot;Another Day in Paradise&quot;, &quot;The Hi-Lo Country&quot;, &quot;Playing by Heart&quot;, and &quot;The Theory of Flight&quot;. Siskel gave thumbs up to all of them, except for &quot;Playing by Heart&quot;.

Following Siskel&#x27;s death, Ebert continued the series with rotating guest hosts, which included Martin Scorsese, Janet Maslin, Peter Bogdanovich, Todd McCarthy, Lisa Schwarzbaum, Kenneth Turan, Elvis Mitchell, and the eventual replacement for Siskel, Richard Roeper.

=== Film and TV appearances ===
Siskel and Ebert were known for their many appearances on late-night talk shows, including appearances on &quot;The Late Show with David Letterman&quot; sixteen times and &quot;The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson&quot; fifteen times. They also appeared together on &quot;The Oprah Winfrey Show&quot;, &quot;The Arsenio Hall Show&quot;, &quot;Howard Stern&quot;, &quot;The Tonight Show with Jay Leno&quot;, and &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot;.

In 1982, 1983, and 1985, Siskel, along with Ebert, appeared as themselves on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;. For their first two appearances, they reviewed sketches from that night&#x27;s telecast and reviewed sketches from the &quot;SNL Film Festival&quot; for their last appearance.

In 1991, Siskel, along with Ebert, appeared in a segment on the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Sesame Street&quot; entitled &quot;Sneak Peek Previews&quot; (a parody of &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;). In the segment, the critics instruct the hosts Oscar the Grouch and Telly Monster on how their thumbs up/thumbs down rating system works. Oscar asks if there could be a thumbs sideways ratings, and goads the two men into an argument about whether or not that would be acceptable, as Ebert likes the idea, but Siskel does not. The two were also seen that same year in the show&#x27;s celebrity version of &quot;Monster in the Mirror&quot;.

In 1993, Siskel appeared as himself in an episode of &quot;The Larry Sanders Show&quot; entitled &quot;Off Camera&quot;. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; chose his performance as one of the great scenes in that year&#x27;s television.

In 1995, Siskel and Ebert guest-starred on an episode of the animated TV series &quot;The Critic&quot; entitled &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert &amp; Jay &amp; Alice&quot;. In the episode, Siskel and Ebert split and each wants protagonist Jay Sherman, a fellow movie critic, as his new partner. The episode is a parody of the film &quot;Sleepless in Seattle&quot;.

An early appearance of Siskel, taken from &quot;Opening Soon at a Theater Near You&quot;, the predecessor to &quot;Sneak Previews&quot;, is included in the 2009 documentary film, &quot;For the Love of Movies: The Story of American Film Criticism&quot;. In the film, he is seen debating with Ebert over the merits of the film version of &quot;One Flew Over the Cuckoo&#x27;s Nest&quot;.

== Critical style ==
Gene Siskel had an abrasive review style, and claimed his film criticism was an individual exercise that should not be swayed by public taste. In an interview for the Academy of Television and Radio, his TV co-host said of him, &quot;I think Gene felt that he had to like the whole picture to give it a thumbs up.&quot;

In particular, he often gave negative reviews to films that became box office champs and went on to be considered mainstream classics: &quot;Poltergeist&quot;, &quot;Scarface&quot;, &quot;Beverly Hills Cop&quot;, &quot;The Terminator&quot;, &quot;Aliens&quot;, &quot;Predator&quot;, &quot;Indiana Jones and the Last Crusade&quot;, &quot;Thelma &amp; Louise&quot;, and &quot;Independence Day&quot;. This even extended to several films that went on to win the Oscar for Best Picture: &quot;The Silence of the Lambs&quot; and &quot;Unforgiven&quot;.

Yet, Ebert also noted in a memoriam episode of &quot;Siskel and Ebert&quot; that when Siskel found a movie that he truly treasured, he embraced it as something special. Directly addressing his late colleague, Ebert said: &quot;I know for sure that seeing a truly great movie made you so happy that you&#x27;d tell me a week later your spirits were still high.&quot; Some of Siskel&#x27;s most treasured movies included &quot;My Dinner with Andre&quot; (1981), &quot;Shoah&quot; (1985), &quot;Fargo&quot; (1996), and the documentary &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot; (1994).

== Preferences ==
=== Favorites ===
One of Siskel&#x27;s favorite films was &quot;Saturday Night Fever&quot;; he even bought the famous white disco suit that John Travolta wore in the film from a charity auction. Another all-time favorite was &quot;Dr. Strangelove&quot;. A favorite from childhood was &quot;Dumbo&quot;, which he often mentioned as the first film that had an influence on him.

=== Best films of the year ===
Siskel compiled &quot;best of the year&quot; film lists from 1969 to 1998, which helped to provide an overview of his critical preferences. His top choices were:
* 1969: &quot;Z&quot;
* 1970: &quot;My Night at Maud&#x27;s&quot;
* 1971: &quot;Claire&#x27;s Knee&quot;
* 1972: &quot;The Godfather&quot;
* 1973: &quot;The Emigrants&quot;
* 1974: &quot;Day for Night&quot;
* 1975: &quot;Nashville&quot;
* 1976: &quot;All the President&#x27;s Men&quot;
* 1977: &quot;Annie Hall&quot;
* 1978: &quot;Straight Time&quot;

* 1979: &quot;Hair&quot;
* 1980: &quot;Raging Bull&quot;
* 1981: &quot;Ragtime&quot;
* 1982: &quot;Moonlighting&quot;
* 1983: &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;
* 1984: &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;
* 1985: &quot;Shoah&quot;
* 1986: &quot;Hannah and Her Sisters&quot;
* 1987: &quot;The Last Emperor&quot;
* 1988: &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;

* 1989: &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;
* 1990: &quot;Goodfellas&quot;
* 1991: &quot;Hearts of Darkness: A Filmmaker&#x27;s Apocalypse&quot;
* 1992: &quot;One False Move&quot;
* 1993: &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;
* 1994: &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot;
* 1995: &quot;Crumb&quot;
* 1996: &quot;Fargo&quot;
* 1997: &quot;The Ice Storm&quot;
* 1998: &quot;&quot;

From 1969 until his death in February 1999, he and Ebert were in agreement on nine annual top selections: &quot;Z&quot;, &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;Nashville&quot;, &quot;The Right Stuff&quot;, &quot;Do the Right Thing&quot;, &quot;Goodfellas&quot;, &quot;Schindler&#x27;s List&quot;, &quot;Hoop Dreams&quot;, and &quot;Fargo&quot;. There would have been a tenth, but Ebert declined to rank the -hour documentary &quot;Shoah&quot; as 1985&#x27;s best film because he felt it was inappropriate to compare it to the rest of the year&#x27;s candidates. Six times, Siskel&#x27;s number one choice did not appear on Ebert&#x27;s top ten list at all: &quot;Straight Time&quot;, &quot;Ragtime&quot;, &quot;Once Upon a Time in America&quot;, &quot;The Last Temptation of Christ&quot;, &quot;Hearts of Darkness&quot;, and &quot;The Ice Storm&quot;. Six times, Ebert&#x27;s top selection did not appear on Siskel&#x27;s; these films were &quot;3 Women&quot;, &quot;An Unmarried Woman&quot;, &quot;Apocalypse Now&quot;, &quot;Sophie&#x27;s Choice&quot;, &quot;Mississippi Burning&quot;, and &quot;Dark City&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1980, Siskel married Marlene Iglitzen, who was then a producer for CBS in New York. They had two daughters, Kate and Callie, and a son, Will. Their daughters graduated from Siskel&#x27;s alma mater, Yale University. He is the uncle of Ed Siskel, a lawyer and White House Counsel under U.S. President Joe Biden.

=== Illness and death ===
Siskel was diagnosed with a malignant, terminal brain tumor on May 8, 1998. He underwent brain surgery three days later. For a few weeks during his recovery, he participated on &quot;Siskel &amp; Ebert&quot; by telephone, calling in from his hospital bed while Ebert appeared in the studio. Siskel did not disclose the severity of his illness to anyone outside of his family; publicly, he said that the surgery removed an unspecified &quot;growth&quot; on his brain, and that he was recovering well. He eventually returned to the studio, but was noted to appear more lethargic and mellow than usual. On February 3, 1999, he announced that he was taking a leave of absence from the show, but that he expected to be back by the fall, stating, &quot;I&#x27;m in a hurry to get well because I don&#x27;t want Roger to get more screen time than I.&quot;

Siskel died at a hospital in Evanston, Illinois, on February 20, 1999, nine months after his diagnosis and surgery; he was 53 years old. His funeral was held two days later at the North Suburban Synagogue Beth El. He is interred at Westlawn Cemetery in Norridge, Illinois.

== Legacy ==
Siskel was a Chicago sports fan, especially of his hometown basketball team, the Chicago Bulls, and would cover locker-room celebrations for WBBM-TV news broadcasts following Bulls championships in the 1990s.

Siskel was also a member of the advisory committee of the Film Center at the School of the Art Institute of Chicago, and a strong supporter of the Film Center mission. He wrote hundreds of articles applauding the Film Center&#x27;s distinctive programming and lent the power of his position as a well-known film critic to urge public funding and audience support. In 2000, the Film Center was renamed The Gene Siskel Film Center in his honor.

Only once during his long association with Ebert did Siskel ever change his vote on a movie during the review. He initially gave the film &quot;Broken Arrow&quot; a &quot;thumbs up&quot;, but after hearing Ebert&#x27;s criticism, Siskel changed his mind to &quot;thumbs down&quot;. However, he had changed his opinions on films years after his initial reviews, as with &quot;Tremors&quot;, which he gave a negative review to in 1990 but later gave a glowing positive review in 1994, stating, &quot;I wasn&#x27;t sure what I missed the first time around, but it just didn&#x27;t click.&quot;

Siskel said that he walked out on three films during his professional career: the 1971 comedy &quot;The Million Dollar Duck&quot; starring Dean Jones, the 1980 horror film &quot;Maniac&quot;, and the 1996 Penelope Spheeris film &quot;Black Sheep&quot;. When he mentioned walking out on &quot;Black Sheep&quot; in 1996, he said it was the first time he walked out on a movie he was reviewing since &quot;Million Dollar Duck&quot; in 1971; he later explained that he did not include &quot;Maniac&quot; because he did not review &quot;Maniac&quot; as an assignment for his newspaper or part of his and Ebert&#x27;s weekly TV reviews but only as a &quot;Dog of the Week&quot;, a feature of the TV show in which each critic would single out the very worst movie they had seen that week.

Both critics had specific sensitivities and feelings that would often vary in extremes to certain kinds of bad films. Ebert was very sensitive to films about race and ethnicity; Siskel was sensitive to films about families and family relationships, and had a special hatred for films like &quot;House Arrest&quot; (1996) and &quot;Like Father Like Son&quot; (1987), both of which were about parents and their children.

Following Siskel&#x27;s death in 1999, Ebert wrote:
Ebert once said of his relationship with Siskel:
When both men appeared together on &quot;The Late Show Starring Joan Rivers&quot;, Joan Rivers conducted a &quot;together and separately&quot; interview with them, which at one point had each of them wear Walkman-style headphones, playing loud music, while the other commented on his partner. When asked what he thought was the biggest difference between himself and Ebert, Siskel unhesitatingly replied: &quot;I&#x27;m a better reviewer than he is&quot;, but a few moments later, he said that anyone who read an Ebert review would read &quot;an extremely well-written review&quot;.

At the 1999 Academy Awards ceremony, after its &quot;in memoriam&quot; montage of deceased stars and film contributors (which did not include Siskel), host Whoopi Goldberg gave a brief impromptu tribute to Siskel:

She included the iconic &quot;thumbs-up&quot; gesture; it received a great round of audience applause.

<text>The Ford Laser is a compact car, originally a subcompact car in the first three generations, which was sold by Ford in Asia, Oceania, and parts of South America and Africa. It has generally been available as a sedan or hatchback, although convertible, wagon and pick-up versions have also been available in different markets. The sedan, and briefly station wagon, versions were badged Ford Meteor in Australia between 1982 and 1987. The Ford Meteor name was also used in South Africa.

The Ford Laser was a restyled version of the Familia/323 models produced by Mazda in Japan from 1980 onwards. Ford had acquired a 25% stake in Mazda in 1979.

Platform and assembly-line sharing with the locally produced Mazda Familia in Japan allowed the Laser in that market to be offered with a plethora of engine, paint and trim configurations not available anywhere else in the world. This was most notably evident during the 1980s with multiple turbocharged variants, unique bodyshells such as the cabriolet, and full-time 4WD models all available years before their debuts in other markets (and in some cases, never making it offshore at all). Along with the Japanese produced Ford Telstar and Ford Festiva, the Laser was sold at special &quot;Autorama&quot; dealerships.

In Australia and New Zealand, where Ford was seen as a local brand, the locally assembled Laser outsold its Mazda twin, the 323, especially in Australia, where the 323 was imported. According to research carried out by Ford Australia in 1984, a third of Laser buyers were unaware that the Ford model was based on the Mazda 323.

However, in neighbouring Asian markets, such as Singapore, Malaysia, Indonesia, and Hong Kong, as well as Japan itself, the reverse was the case, although pooling resources with Mazda allowed Ford to maintain a foothold in the region. This was also the case in South America, South Africa, and the Caribbean, where the Laser was also sold, in many cases being locally assembled.

== First generation (KA/KB; 1981) ==
=== Laser (KA/KB) ===
The KA Laser (Australian model code), built under license from Mazda, was introduced in March 1981, replacing the rear-wheel-drive Escort in Australia. The range was available as a hatchback, in both three- and five-door varieties, as well as a four-door sedan badged Ford Meteor. Originally sold only with the 1.3-litre engine, the smaller 1.1-litre engine was never available in Australia. Later, 1.5-litre versions were added, eventually even a turbocharged version. In January 1983, the Laser underwent a facelift to become the KB. Light changes were made to the rear, while the front was redesigned in a more modern style, aligning it with Ford&#x27;s corporate look of the era.

In Japan this is referred to as the &quot;BE&quot; Laser, which was identical to the Australian KB series. The BE model code relates to the BD model code used for the corresponding Familia/323. The first Lasers went on sale in Japan in late 1982. Fuel-injection and a 115 PS turbocharged model were added in July 1983; these variants were never offered for sale outside Japan.

Aside from being built in Australia and Japan, Lasers were also assembled in New Zealand at Ford&#x27;s Wiri plant in Auckland, replacing the Mk2 Escort. In New Zealand, the Laser was sold as both a hatchback and sedan, the Meteor name not being used in that market, and was later joined by the Mazda 323 at the renamed Vehicle Assemblers of New Zealand (VANZ) plant in Wiri, Auckland in a joint venture between Ford New Zealand and Mazda. 323s initially had been assembled at the Motor Industries International plant in Otahuhu, subsequently taken over by Mazda New Zealand. New Zealand-built Ford Laser hatchbacks were available with the 1.1-litre (base and Ritz), 1.3-litre (GL), and 1.5-litre (Sport) engines, while the Laser sedan (base, L, Ghia) was available with the 1.1-, 1.3 and 1.5-litre engines respectively, with the Ghia having an automatic transmission option.

The Laser was also sold in some countries in Latin America, including Argentina. This was identical to the KA version sold in Australia. In Mexico, however, the first-generation Laser had a front end similar to the North American Mazda GLC. In addition, it was sold in right hand drive markets in the Caribbean such as Jamaica and Trinidad and Tobago, where it was locally assembled.
Assembly of the Laser also occurred in Malaysia and Indonesia (in right hand drive) and in left hand drive for markets like Taiwan and the Philippines. In Taiwan, it was assembled using complete knock-down kits from 1981 via the local joint venture Ford Lio Ho.

The Laser was also introduced in Zimbabwe in 1981, the first Ford model to be sold in the country for fourteen years, after the imposition of sanctions on the then Rhodesia after its Unilateral Declaration of Independence. It was assembled at the state-owned Willowvale Motor Industries plant, in Harare, alongside the Mazda 323.

=== Meteor (GA/GB) ===
Introduced in April 1982, Ford Meteor was the name given to the sedan version of the Laser. Designated as the GA series, the Meteor featured conventional three-box styling with a 60/40 folding rear seat to increase luggage capacity that was already considered &quot;very large for the class&quot;. Compared to the Laser, the front seats could be moved back a little further at the expense of rear seat passengers. To further improve practicality, the Meteor&#x27;s spare wheel could be relocated from the floor to an upright position to increase boot depth from . The additional length of over the Laser hatchback was used by Ford Australia to justify the Meteor as replacement to the TF Cortina. In Australia, the Meteor was only available with the 1.5-litre engine and five-speed manual transmission or optional three-speed automatic. Consequently, the Meteor had a difficult undertaking replacing the Cortina, which offered engine displacements from 2.0 litres for the inline-four, up to a 4.1-litre inline-six, plus a station wagon option.&lt;ref name=&quot;1981–85 Ford KA/KB Laser – A Beam of Light&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; However, the Meteor&#x27;s pitch as the Cortina replacement was merely a temporary measure prior to the introduction of the Telstar mid-sized sedan and hatchback in May 1983. In Australia, the Meteor directly competed against the Holden Camira.

The Meteor&#x27;s front styling and grille differed from the corresponding Laser. The Meteor styling was based on the Japanese market Mazda Familia (BD) sedan. Lighting changes included the replacement of the Laser&#x27;s amber front turn signals with clear lenses, plus the fitment of larger, flush headlamps over the Laser&#x27;s smaller lights that were &quot;sunken&quot; into an enclosure. The Meteor grille had more of an &quot;eggcrate&quot; pattern than the plain black slats of the Laser. Suspension was fully independent with coil springs.

Trim levels in Australia comprised the entry-level GL and upmarket Ghia, both available with an optional &quot;S&quot; pack that added full instrumentation and upgraded tyres. Steel wheels with bright metal trim rings differentiated the GL from the Ghia with its alloy wheels and deep side protection mouldings.

The mid-term facelifted model of May 1983, coded GB, brought the range closer together, though Meteors continued as a separate and slightly more premium line.

== Second generation (BF/KC/KE; 1985) ==
=== Japan ===

January 1985 saw the advent of the BF series Laser in Japan. This was the Laser&#x27;s first major redesign. For the first time a diesel version was offered in Japan, as well as a factory two-door cabriolet with 1.5-litre turbo engine, a 1.6-litre DOHC 16-valve Sport version, and a potent 140 PS DOHC turbo model with full-time 4WD drivetrain (identical to the contemporary Mazda Familia BFMR). AWD models for sedan and wagon/van were also available for sale. This added up to an extremely convoluted Japanese product line, which was later streamlined in 1987 with a mid-life model refresh (KE series in other markets). This refresh dropped E-series engines in favour of all-new B-series equivalents, poorer-selling variants were discontinued, and minor changes were made to exterior styling and interior trim. The commercial van model was available until 1994, sold together with next generation Laser.

===Australia and New Zealand===

For Australia, the range was known as the KC Laser and GC Meteor, launched in October 1985. All body styles were carried over, with the addition of a station wagon (badged as &quot;Meteor&quot;, like the sedan) from 1986. A new &quot;TX3&quot; variant, which was at the top of the &quot;Laser&quot; models in specification level and designated &quot;KC2&quot;, replaced the &quot;Sport&quot; variant from the KB series. Unlike the Sport, the TX3 was only available as a three-door (the Taiwanese TX3 was available in a five-door version only). The &quot;L&quot; and &quot;GL&quot; models were no longer available as a three-door. A notable change was the introduction of engines capable of running on 91 RON unleaded petrol (this became mandatory in Australia from 1986).

The &quot;E5&quot; 1.5-litre SOHC carburettored engine that was optional on GL, and standard on Ghia in the KB series was replaced with the new &quot;B6&quot; 1.6-litre I4 SOHC. For the first time, electronic fuel injection was available as an option on Ghia models, and was standard on TX3 models. Buyers who ordered automatic transmission with this engine received an electronically controlled four-speed unit, which was quite advanced for a small car in 1985. The &quot;B3&quot; I4 SOHC 1.3-litre engine was standard on the &quot;L&quot; (hatchback only, the wagon had a 1.6-litre engine). The 1.6-litre engine was standard on GL, Ghia and TX3, though some early GL models were equipped with a 1.5-litre SOHC carburettored.

The KC/KE Laser wagon was also assembled in New Zealand, alongside its Mazda 323 equivalent, until Ford closed their VANZ assembly plant at Wiri, Auckland in 1996.

KC / GC model range (Australia):
* Laser L
* Laser GL
* Laser Ghia
* Laser TX3
* Meteor L (wagon only)
* Meteor GL
* Meteor Ghia

==== Laser (KE) ====
In October 1987, Ford introduced a facelift of the KC series, the KE. There were a number of notable changes with the introduction of the KE. The &quot;Meteor&quot; name was dropped from the sedan and wagon body styles, meaning they were now badged as &quot;Laser&quot;, like the hatchback variants. The TX3 was also now available with a turbocharged engine and all-wheel-drive (AWD) as options. The TX3 Turbo with AWD is now very rare and highly sought after. The AWD was fully imported from Japan, while all other models in the Laser range were manufactured locally in the Sydney suburb of Flemington.

The KE is easy to distinguish from the earlier KC, by different grilles, headlights, tail lights, body-side mouldings, bonnet, front guards, and on some models, wheels. The dashboard and instrument cluster received new graphics, and the interior was available in slightly different colour shades to the KC. In mid-1989, in preparation for a new Australian Design Rules (ADRs) to come into effect in 1990, all models were fitted with a high-mount rear stop lamp as standard. When the redesigned KF Laser was introduced in March 1990, the wagon continued in a sole GL specification, with minor upgrades until September 1994, when Australian production of the Laser ceased.

The &quot;L&quot; is quite rare, as it was primarily aimed at the budget or fleet buyer and available as a five-door hatchback and station wagon. It had silver-painted 13-inch steel wheels, with no centre caps, a large analogue clock in the instrument cluster, no passenger-side rear-view mirror, vinyl interior trim, no body side mouldings, no rear windscreen wiper, and the folding rear seat was only one-piece. The stereo was also AM-only and had no cassette player. Air conditioning was not available. The only engine on offer was the 1.3-litre engine, with four-speed manual transmission (no automatic was available). The &quot;L&quot; wagon had the same level of trim, except the 1.3-litre engine was replaced with the 1.6-litre unit, but still with four-speed transmission (automatic was not available on either the hatchback or wagon).

The &quot;GL&quot; was the most popular model. It featured the same silver-painted 13&quot; steel wheels as the &quot;L&quot; but with satin chrome half-width centre caps (only covering the centre of the wheel), a digital clock on the top of the dashboard, cloth interior trim, grey body side mouldings, a rear windscreen wiper, grey tailgate and beaver panel garnishes and 50/50 split-fold rear seat. The stereo was an analogue-tuned AM/FM unit with a basic cassette player. Air conditioning was optional as a dealer-fit accessory. Power was provided by a 1.6-litre engine, with 4-speed manual transmission (5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic was optional). Sedan and wagon came standard with five-speed transmission.

The Ghia was the luxury model. It had black 14-inch steel wheels with full-size plastic wheel covers, power steering, body-coloured rear-view mirrors and bumpers, velour interior trim, tachometer, centre console with Ghia emblem, lockable glovebox, driver&#x27;s seat with lumbar support and height adjust, storage drawer underneath the front passenger seat, full-size interior door trims, vanity mirror in passenger sun visor, ticket holder in driver&#x27;s sun visor, felt interior headlining and sunvisors, rear headrests, additional warning lights in the instrument cluster, central locking with illuminated driver&#x27;s door lock barrel, remote exterior mirrors, front door map pockets, front seatback pockets, additional reading lamps, chrome insert strips in the body side mouldings and bumpers, red tailgate garnish and orange beaver panel garnish. Air conditioning and power windows were optional. The stereo was a digitally tuned AM/FM unit, which featured a cassette player with Dolby enhanced sound. The 1.6-litre engine was fitted as standard, with EFI optional (standard on wagon), with either 5-speed manual or 3-speed automatic transmission (EFI automatic was 4-speed).

The TX3 was the Laser flagship. It came standard with 14-inch satin-chrome alloy wheels, sports cloth interior trim, red insert strips in the body side mouldings and bumpers, black tailgate and beaver panel garnishes, semi-bucket seats with adjustable seat height, back and lumbar support, auto fade interior lamps, and all other Ghia appointings. EFI and A/C was standard, and automatic transmission was not available. The TX3 also had a unique front fascia with quad headlights and the parker lamps incorporated into the indicator lenses (L/GL/Ghia had the parkers inside the main headlight unit) and two-tone paint.

Halfway through KE production, Ford introduced two limited edition versions, called &quot;Redline&quot;, and &quot;Livewire&quot;. The Redline was based on the GL hatch, while the Livewire was based on the GL sedan and hatch. The Redline featured the TX3&#x27;s alloy wheels, two-tone paint and red inserts in the body-side mouldings and bumpers, air conditioning, and a tachometer. The Livewire featured yellow inserts in the body side mouldings and bumpers, a body coloured grille, air conditioning, and a tachometer. Both models had 5-speed manual transmission (as opposed to the standard 4-speed) as standard, with 3-speed automatic transmission as an option.

KE model range;
* Laser L – Hatch or wagon
* Laser GL – Hatch, sedan or wagon
* Laser Ghia – Hatch, sedan or wagon
* Laser TX3
* Laser TX3 Turbo
* Laser TX3 Turbo 4WD

===Asia===
The Laser was also sold in Thailand, Malaysia, Singapore, Hong Kong, Taiwan, Sri Lanka, and other markets. Trim and specifications vary somewhat between the countries. In Indonesia, this Laser was assembled at Mazda&#x27;s plant in Bekasi together with its Mazda 323 twin. It was available in GL and Ghia trims from late 1985 with the 1.3-litre E3 engine () or 1.5-litre E5 engine (), a five-speed manual transmission, and five-door hatchback or four-door saloon bodywork. Later, a non-emissions scrubbed Laser TX-3 three-door hatchback with the fuel injected B6 1.6-litre engine became available. This produced a claimed at 6000 rpm. The production for general buyers was stopped in 1989, but the GL sedan with 1.3-litre E3 engine was continued to available for taxi fleet until 1997.

In Taiwan, the second generation Laser was assembled by Ford Lio Ho Motor. Unique for this market, it was offered with slightly different exterior styling. The pre-facelift hatchback (only available as five-door) was offered with different headlights (similar styling to KA Laser) and the facelift model received KE TX3 headlights. Second facelift occurred for sedan and wagon, with massive makeover borrowed from the Mazda 323 (BF) facelift styling. A performance five-door hatchback TX3 Turbo was also available in Taiwan with a 1.6-liter DOHC turbo engine.

=== North America === 
A version of the KC Laser, the Mercury Tracer, was marketed in the US and Canada, available as a hatchback and wagon only. The Tracer hatchback shared its bodyshell with its Laser counterpart, but the wagon was a distinct design based on the Laser hatchback, rather than the sedan, as was the case with the Meteor wagon. US versions of the Tracer were built in Mexico at Ford&#x27;s Hermosillo Stamping and Assembly plant, whereas for the Canadian market, Ford opted to import the Mercury Tracer from Taiwan&#x27;s Ford Lio Ho Motor instead. In Bermuda, however, the KE Laser was sold locally in right hand drive badged as a Ford.

===South Africa===
The Laser was introduced in South Africa in 1986, as a hatchback, with the sedan version being sold as the Meteor. Replacing the Ford Escort, it was produced alongside the Mazda 323 by Samcor. Originally the Laser and Meteor were available with Mazda E-series 1.3-litre carb and 1.5-litre carb engines and also a high compression 1.6-litre B6 EFi engine for the 1600i Sport model. From 1989, Ford&#x27;s CVH engines (1.4 and 1.6) were used, replacing the earlier E engines. These were later in turn replaced by Mazda&#x27;s B3 1.3-litre and F6 1.6-litre engines. South African models of the Laser and Meteor also gained the 2.0-litre FE SOHC 8-valve and &quot;FE-DOHC&quot; EFi 16-valve engine from 1991 to 1993, the later was available for the flagship 20i RS. The KC/KE Laser and Meteor remained in production in South Africa until 1995, when the Escort was reintroduced.

However, Ford introduced an entry-level model called the Tonic and Tracer, a rebadged version of the locally manufactured BF series Mazda 323 hatchback, which was sold until 2003. There was also a coupe utility version with facelifted Mazda 323 BF styling, sold as Ford Bantam and Mazda Rustler.

== Third generation (KF/KH; 1989) ==
The third generation BG series of 1989 to 1994 went on to be the most popular Laser sold in Japan, with the new &quot;coupé&quot; (liftback) version an instant success. Again, a DOHC turbo model with full-time 4WD was offered as a companion car to the Mazda Familia GT-X, now producing from an increased displacement of 1.8 litres.

===Australia===
In Australia, this model was released in March 1990 as the KF series and updated in October 1991 with the KH facelift. Local production of the Laser in Australia ceased on 4 September 1994 when Ford closed its plant in Flemington, and imported the new KJ model from Japan;

===New Zealand===
In New Zealand, the KH Laser continued in production at Ford&#x27;s assembly plant in Wiri, Auckland, until the end of 1996 when the factory closed. The extended production model in New Zealand was sold only in five-door hatchback form as either the Laser Encore or Laser Esprit, as a cheaper alternative to the newer KJ Laser imported from Japan. The Encore was the cheaper of the two, available only with a five-speed manual transmission, while the Esprit was slightly higher specification and was available with both the five-speed and also a four-speed automatic. Both featured red pinstriping around the body and many received dealer-fit accessories such as alloy wheels to boost appeal.

===Taiwan===
The third generation Ford Laser was launched in May 1990 in Taiwan, with the additional Chinese name, Golden Laser (金全壘) for the third generation to be sold alongside the updated second generation model exclusively in Taiwan. The second generation models were reduced to a sedan with 5-speed manual transmission or a 3-speed automatic transmission and a station wagon with a 5-speed manual transmission. The third generation Laser was only offered as either a 4-door sedan or a 5-door liftback while the second generation station wagon bodystyle remains to be in production after production of the second generation model ceased in 1990.


===Other markets===
This generation of Laser was also sold in Cyprus and Malta. This generation was the basis of later Escort models sold in North America from 1990 for the 1991 model year, which is not to be confused with the model of the same name sold in Europe. The Escort name was retained for the new model due to both strong brand equity on the Escort name as well as Chrysler already using the Laser name for the Plymouth Laser. The Escort wagon seen in North America during this generation was unique to that continent and was not part of the Laser ranges elsewhere.

In Indonesia, this generation was assembled locally (CKD) and sold from 1990 to 1996. Available in two body styles and four trim levels, 1.3 L sedan &quot;Ghia&quot; and &quot;Sonic&quot;, 1.6 L sedan &quot;Gala&quot; and 5-door liftback &quot;Champ&quot; with 1.8 L DOHC BP engine. The older 1.3 L sedan &quot;GL&quot; from previous generation was also sold for taxi fleet use until 1997.

Engine specifications (Australia):
* Mazda B3, 1.3 L carb, 16V SOHC (XL)
* Mazda B6-2E, 1.6 L carb, 16V SOHC (L, XL, GL, Livewire, Grand Slam, Indy, Collection, Horizon models)
* Mazda B8, 1.8 L fuel-injected, 16V SOHC (Ghia, S and GLi models)
* Mazda BP DOHC, 1.8 L fuel-injected, 16V DOHC (TX3 non-turbo models)
* Mazda BPT, 1.8 L fuel-injected, 16V DOHC Turbo (Turbo 4WD models)
== Fourth generation (KJ/KL/KM; 1994) ==
===Japan===
The fourth generation Laser was known as the BHA series in Japan. All sporting models were discontinued with the release of this model in the wake of poor sales and financial returns as Mazda scaled back operations and sought to rearrange market focus. Only the sedan and three-door hatchback were sold in Japan, the hatch being based on the Mazda Familia Neo.

===Australia===

The Japanese built KJ Laser in Australia went on sale in October 1994 represented a major change in design; looking very different from the previous KH model. The three-door hatchback was known as the Laser Lynx and the five-door as the Laser Liata. 

The new KJ Laser was introduced in 1994 with variants, facelifts (KL of December 1996 and KM of December 1997) and engine driveline improvements continuing up until the last of the KM series were released in 1999. The KJ Laser was the first Laser manufactured wholly in Japan, following Ford Australia&#x27;s decision to close their Flemington plant. 

However, the KJ was disappointing in sales numbers mainly because of the smaller Festiva and other cheaper South Korean cars from Hyundai, Kia and Daewoo to which many conservative buyers flocked.

===New Zealand===
With the introduction of the KJ Laser in 1994, Ford New Zealand found itself in a unique position, offering three different generations of the Laser as new vehicles at once at its dealerships—the new KJ Laser, the previous-generation KH Laser as a five-door hatchback, and the older-shape KE Laser station wagon. These were assembled at the VANZ factory in Wiri, Auckland until 1997 when Ford NZ discontinued local assembly.

The second update KM Laser was not sold in New Zealand. The KL Laser, now replaced in Australia, continued to be sold alongside the European Ford Escort in New Zealand during 1997 but was discontinued locally at the end of the year, the Escort hatchback and sedan replacing it for just 16 months between January 1998 and May 1999 when the new KN Laser was introduced.

===Taiwan===
For 1995 in Taiwan, Ford Lio Ho Motor assembled the Laser sedan branded as the Ford Liata; the Lynx three-door version was rebranded as the Ford Aztec. However, the Liata five-door version was not available in Taiwan, although the Mazda 323 was sold as a rebadged version of the Laser sedan only.

===Latin America===
In Latin America, this generation of Laser was assembled in Colombia and Venezuela, alongside its Mazda 323 counterpart, known as the Mazda Allegro.

Engine Specifications:
* Mazda B6, 80 kW, 1.6L, 16V, DOHC (&#x27;LXi&#x27; models)
* Mazda BP, 92 kW, 1.8L, 16V, DOHC (&#x27;GLXi&#x27; and some &#x27;LXi&#x27; models)
== Fifth generation (KN/KQ; 1998) ==

Fifth generation &quot;BJ&quot; series models were renamed &quot;Laser Lidea&quot; in Japan in December 1998, with popularity falling even further than the previous model. Japanese production ceased at the end of 2002, to be replaced by the imported Ford Focus, which was already sold there since 2000.

Released in Australia in May 1999, the KN Laser was the last generation of the Laser to be introduced. The model range was almost identical to the Mazda 323 on which it was based, which was the first time since the KE Laser. In February 2001, the KN received a minor facelift and became the KQ Laser. The big news with the KQ Laser was the addition of a 2.0-litre four-cylinder engine for the new top-spec &quot;SR2&quot;, which was also the first sports-oriented Laser variant in almost five years, since the unpopular Laser Lynx was discontinued in 1996. A new &quot;SR&quot; level of trim, which sat below SR2 was also introduced at this time. The KQ can be distinguished from the earlier KN, with a new grille with chrome moulding, new headlights, revised tail lights, different exterior colours, and slightly revised interiors.

In March 2002, due to falling sales, Ford made one last attempt to restore the Laser&#x27;s popularity to its former glory, by announcing minor upgrades to the SR2, and added three new exterior colours to the range, being &quot;Goldrush&quot;, &quot;Red Revenge&quot;, and &quot;Electric Blue&quot;. Three engines were available, a 1.6-litre that was fitted to the LXi, a 1.8-litre that was fitted to the GLXi &amp; SR, and a 2.0-litre that was exclusive to the SR2.

Despite the Laser having a good reputation with buyers in the marketplace, and many attempts from Ford to reignite interest in the model, it was unable to sell in reasonable numbers. In September 2002, Ford decided to discontinue the Laser in Australia, replacing it with the European-sourced Focus. However, the Laser continued in New Zealand until mid-2003, when it was also replaced by the facelifted Focus.

Model range:
* Laser LXi (sedan or hatchback)
* Laser GLXi (sedan or hatchback)
* Laser Deluxe 1.6
* Laser Ghia 1.8 AT/MT 
* Laser SR (hatchback only)
* Laser SR2 (hatchback only), renamed Laser XRi in New Zealand

Engine specifications:
* Mazda 1.8 L FP-DE DOHC I4 and 
* Mazda 2.0 L FS, and 
* Mazda 2.0 L FS-ZE (2001 Sport 20)
* Mazda 1.6 L ZM-DE and 

===Ford Tierra===
In Taiwan, Ford Lio Ho Motor renamed the KN/KQ Laser sedan as Ford Tierra while the Laser hatchback was renamed Ford Life, and both was sold as rebadged versions of the pre-facelift Mazda 323 BJ generation without any exterior redesigns. The KQ facelift design was directed by Ford Lio Ho Motor and was based on the Australian KN Laser as the rear fenders are different from the Mazda-derived Ford Tierras. A facelift of the Tierra arrived in the early-to-mid 2000s, distinguished by its completely new front fenders, new hood, a new grille with chrome moulding, new headlights, revised tail lights, new trunk lid, different exterior colours, and slightly revised interiors.

When the facelift for the Tierra was introduced, the pre-facelift model sold alongside it, renamed as Ford Activa and acting as a cheaper alternative. The Activa was sold in both sedan and hatchback forms and a wider variety of colour choices was also available while the Tierra facelift was only offered in sedan form and was offered in a variety of trim levels. The KQ Tierra was sold originally as the Tierra LS and the Tierra RS with a slight performance tuning and body kit. In 2005, the RS was replaced by the Tierra Aero which was a slightly tuned down version of the RS, and later in 2007, the Tierra GT was introduced and later the Tierra XT with a redesigned body kit before the model was replaced by the European second generation Ford Focus.

===Ford Lynx===

The fifth generation Laser was marketed in the Philippines and Malaysia as the Lynx.

In the Philippines, two trim levels were offered; GSi and Ghia. Both were powered with a 1.6-litre petrol engines. Transmission choices were a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic, available in both trims. In 2002, the Lynx received its first facelift, featuring new front fenders, hood, a new grille with chrome moulding, new headlights, tail lights, trunk lid, wheel designs, different exterior colours, and slightly revised interiors. The Ghia grade had an electronic sun visor and beige color tone interior. The LSi was added into the lineup as a base model. It was offered with a 1.3-litre engine, no power features, steel wheels with hubcaps and 2-DIN head unit, and was sold until June 2004.

In June 2003, a second facelift took place, featuring new taillights, front grille, redesigned trunk garnish and bumpers. A new addition was a trim level called the RS. It had a 2.0-litre engine making 143 hp, RS body kit and interior, smoked black headlights and 7-spoke RS wheels. Available colors were Red Metallic and Black Metallic and the only transmission choice was a 5-speed manual.

In Malaysia, only one trim level was originally offered; the 1.6-litre Ghia. It had front discs and rear drum brakes. Transmission choices were a 5-speed manual or 4-speed automatic. In 2002, the Lynx received its first facelift. The RS trim was released in mid-2003 along with a second facelift.

The Laser was replaced in most markets around the world by the European-sourced Focus, designated as one of Ford&#x27;s &quot;world cars&quot;. The Mazda 323&#x27;s replacement, the first generation Mazda3, was also based on the same platform as the Focus, continuing the tradition of both companies having products in this market segment around the world sharing common componentry.

<doc id="372315" wikidata="Q1697" url="?curid=372315" title="Moscow Oblast">
<text>Moscow Oblast (, , informally known as , ) is a federal subject of Russia (an oblast). With a population of 8,524,665 (2021 Census) living in an area of , it is one of the most densely populated regions in the country and is the second most populous federal subject. The oblast has no official administrative center; its public authorities are located in Moscow and Krasnogorsk (the Moscow Oblast Duma and the local government), and also across other locations in the oblast.

Located in European Russia between latitudes 54° and 57° N and longitudes 35° and 41° E, Moscow Oblast borders Tver Oblast in the northwest, Yaroslavl Oblast in the north, Vladimir Oblast in the northeast and east, Ryazan Oblast in the southeast, Tula Oblast in the south, Kaluga Oblast in the southwest, and Smolensk Oblast in the west. The oblast mostly surrounds the federal city of Moscow, which is not part of the oblast, but rather a separate federal subject in its own right. The oblast is highly industrialized, with the major industries being metallurgy, oil refining, and mechanical engineering, along with the food, energy, and chemical industries.

==Geography==
===Relief===
The oblast is mostly flat, with some hills with a height of about in the western and extensive lowlands in the eastern part. From the southwest to northeast, the oblast is crossed by the border of the Moscow glacier to the north of the common ice-erosion form with moraine ridges, and to the south are only erosional landforms. The western and northern parts of the oblast contain the Moscow Uplands. Their average height peaks at about near Dmitrov and the upper point of lies near the village of Shapkino in Mozhaysky District. The northern part of the Moscow Uplands is steeper than the southern part. The uplands contain lakes of glacial origin, such as Lakes Nerskoye and Krugloye. To the north of the Moscow Uplands lies the alluvial Verhnevolzhsk Depression; It is marshy and flat with the height varying between about and .

To the south stretches a hilly area of the Moskvoretsko-Oksk plain. Its greatest height of lies in the area of Tyoply Stan, within the Moscow city limits. The plain has clearly defined river valleys, especially in the south parts, and occasional karst relief, mostly in Serpukhovsky District. In the extreme south, after the Oka River, lies the Central Russian Upland. It contains numerous gullies and ravines and has average height above 200 m with the maximum of 236 m near Pushchino.

Most of the eastern part of Moscow Oblast is taken by the vast Meshchera Lowlands with much wetland in their eastern part. Their highest hill peaks at but the average heights are . Most lakes of the lowlands, such as Lakes Chyornoye and Svyatoye, are of glacial origin. Here lies the lowest natural elevation of the region, the water level of Oka River at .

===Geology and minerals===

====Geology====

Moscow Oblast is located in the central part of the East European craton. Like all cratons, the latter is composed of the crystalline basement and sedimentary cover. The basement consists of Archaean and Proterozoic rocks and the cover is deposited in the Palaeozoic, Mesozoic and Cenozoic eras. The lowest depth of the basement () is to the south of Serebryanye Prudy, in the very south area of the oblast, and the largest () is to the east of Sergiyev Posad, in the northeast region.

Tertiary deposits are almost absent within the oblast. Significantly more abundant are deposits of the Carboniferous and Jurassic periods. In the Cretaceous period, a sea was covering Moscow Oblast, as evidenced by phosphate deposits and a variety of sands. Cretaceous sediments are most common in the north of the oblast. The sea was wider in Jurassic than in Cretaceous period. Typical Jurassic deposits, in the form of black clay, are found within and around the city of Moscow and in the valley of the Moscow River. Carboniferous deposits in Moscow Oblast are represented by dolomite, limestone, and marl. Coal deposits rich in organic remains occur in the south, especially in Serpukhovsky District, and in the western regions. Devonian deposits were also found within the region.

Quaternary deposits are widely distributed in Moscow Oblast; their thickness decreases from the northwest to southeast. It is believed that there were four glaciations in the area. The first occurred in the Lower Pleistocene and spread to the east–west part of the Oka River valley, it left almost no trace in the region. In the Middle Pleistocene, there were two powerful glaciations. The Dnieper glacier covered a large part of the Russian Plain, whereas the Moscow glaciation stopped just south of the present city of Moscow. The last glaciation, the Valdai glaciation, occurred in the Late Pleistocene; it did not directly affect the territory of Moscow Oblast, but left traces in the form of fluvioglacial deposits, mainly in the north area. The glaciers left behind a moraine loam with pebbles and boulders of various rocks, such as granite, gneiss, quartzite, dolomite, limestone and sandstone. Its thickness varies between a few meters at watersheds and 100 m at moraine ridges.

====Minerals====
Moscow Oblast is rich in minerals. Sands from the sediments of different periods (mainly Quaternary and Cretaceous) are of high quality and are widely used in construction. Quartz sand (milled quartz) is used in the glass industry, their production is conducted from the end of 17th century near Lyubertsy. Much of the production is currently halted due to environmental concerns, and only the Yeganovskoye field is being exploited; its silica sand reserves are 33 million tonnes and annual production reaches 675,000 tonnes. Sand and gravel deposits are abundant within the Smolensk-Moscow Upland. Sandstone deposits are developed in Klinsky and Dmitrovsky Districts.

There are numerous clay deposits within the oblast; fusible clay is excavated in Sergiyev Posad. The Yeldiginskoye field near the village of Sofrino has reserves estimated at 30 million cubic meters; its annual production reaches . Refractory white clay occurs in the eastern region, in the Carboniferous and Jurassic sediments, and is extracted from the 14th century near Gzhel. The largest (Kudinovskoye) deposit is near the town of Elektrougli with the reserves of 3 billion tonnes. Also widespread are loams which are used in brick manufacture and limestones (&quot;white stone&quot;). The famous Myachkovo deposit of carboniferous limestone provided material that went for cladding of such buildings in Moscow as the Bolshoi Theater. The mining in Myachkovo had been stopped and currently, limestone is provided by the quarries of Podolsky, Voskresensky, and Kolomensky Districts. The latter district also provides marble-like limestone.

Other industrial minerals of Moscow Oblast are dolomite, limestone tuff, and marl; mostly in the southern and eastern parts. Dolomite is used in the cement industry. Its mining is concentrated mainly near Shchyolkovo, the reserves exceed 20 million tonnes and the annual production is about 650 tonnes.

Phosphates are produced in the Yegorevskoye and Severskoye fields. Meshchera and Verkhnevolzhsk Lowlands are rich in peat. The largest mines are &quot;Ryazanovskoe&quot; (840,000 tonnes per year) and &quot;Radovitsky moss&quot; (760,000 tonnes per year), both around Yegoryevsk. There are deposits of brown coal beyond the Oka River, but they have no commercial value. There are also minor deposits of titanium and iron ore in Serpukhovsky and Serebryano-Prudsky Districts.

Salts of potassium salt are being developed around Serpukhov and Yegoryevsk. There are also numerous mineral springs near Zvenigorod, Klin, and Serpukhov. They include surface springs and reservoirs at the depth of . Deeper, at there is a large sea of salt extending beyond Moscow Oblast. Waters with the salt concentration up to 300 g/L are used in the local food industry and spas.

===Climate===
The climate of Moscow Oblast is humid continental, with clearly expressed seasonality – short but warm summers and long, cold winters; the continentality increases from northwest to southeast. The period of the average temperature below lasts 130–150 days, beginning in early or mid-November and ending in late March (or very early April). The average annual temperature varies from to . The coldest months are January and February with the average temperature of in the west and in the east. With the arrival of arctic air, the temperature drops to below that may last up to twenty days during the winter, with the temperatures reaching . The minimum temperature of was observed in Naro-Fominsk. Thaws often occur in December and February due to the Atlantic, and rarely the Mediterranean cyclones. The thaws usually last several days, and their total number from November to March can reach fifty. Snow starts accumulating in November, though sometimes in late October or early December, and disappears in mid-April (sometimes in late March). The snow depth is and the soil freezes to . The warmest month is July with the average temperature of in the northwest and in the southeast. The maximum temperature of was recorded in Kolomna during 2010 Northern Hemisphere summer heat waves. The average annual rainfall is , the precipitation is maximal in the northwestern and minimal in the southeastern regions. The summer precipitation is usually , but severe droughts occur once in 25–30 years, with less than of rain over June–August.

===Rivers and lakes===
There are more than three hundred rivers with the length above in Moscow Oblast. All rivers are calm and have well-developed valleys and floodplains. They are mostly fed by melting snow and the flood falls on April–May. The water level is low in summer and increases only with heavy rain. The rivers freeze over from late November until mid-April. The only navigable rivers are the Volga, the Oka, and the Moskva River.

Most rivers belong to the basin of the Volga, which itself only crosses a small part in the north of Moscow Oblast, near the border with Tver Oblast. The second largest river of the region is the Oka. The northern part of Moscow Oblast includes such Volga tributaries as the Shosha, the Lama, the Dubna, the Sestra, and the Yakhroma. On the south flow the tributaries of the Oka, including the Nara, the Protva, and the Lopasnya Rivers. The Moskva River, which almost entirely flows within the oblast, also belongs to the Oka basin. The eastern and northeastern regions, including much of Meschersk Depression, are irrigated by the tributaries of the Klyazma River, which itself is a main tributary of the Oka.

The Moscow Canal crosses the northern part of Moscow Oblast through the Ikshinskyoe, Klyazminskoye, Pyalovskoye, and Pestovskoye Reservoirs. In the basin of the Moskva River, there are also Ozerninskoye, Mozhayskoye, Istrinskoye, and Ruza Reservoirs, providing Moscow with drinking water.

There are about 350 lakes in the oblast, almost all are shallow (5–10 m) and many are of glacial origin. The largest are () and Svyatoye () whereas the deepest () is Lake Glubokoye in Ruzsky District. There are also many marshes, especially within the Meshchersk and Verkhnevolzhsk lowlands.

===Soils===
The oblast is dominated by relatively infertile podsol soils which require fertilizers for commercial agriculture. On the hills there is more loam and the low-lying areas have more of bog, sandy loam and sand. Chernozem is scarce and occurs only south of the Oka River. Gray forest soils are spread between the Oka, Moskva, and Klyazma Rivers, mostly in Ramensky and Voskresensky Districts. Marshy soils are common in Meshchersk and Verkhnevolzhsk lowlands. Valleys of large rivers are rich in alluvial soils. In general, soils are heavily polluted with chemical fertilizers, pesticides, and household and industrial waste, especially around Moscow, Orekhovo-Zuyevo, Noginsk, and Voskresensk.

===Flora===
Moscow Oblast lies within the zone of forests and steppes with forests covering over 40% of the region. Coniferous (mainly fir) trees dominate the northern (Verkhnevolzhsk lowlands) and western parts (Mozhaysky, Lotoshinsky, and Shakhovsky Districts). Forests of Meshchora consist primarily of pine; in waterlogged lowlands, there are individual alder forests. Central and eastern regions have coniferous-deciduous forests with the main tree species of spruce, pine, birch, and aspen often mixed with bushes of hazel. To the south lies the subzone of broad-leaved forests of oak, lime, maple and elm. Moscow-Oka Upland is the transition zone which is dominated by spruce, for example, in the upper reaches of the Lopasnya River. Valleys of the Oka are covered in pine forests of the steppe type and the far south regions (Serebryano-Prudsky and partially Serpukhovsky Districts) are cultivated steppes with occasional lime and oak groves.

The intensive cutting of Moscow region forests in the 18–19th centuries reduced them and changed their species: conifers were replaced by birch and aspen. There is almost no logging nowadays and the forests are being restored, especially around Moscow.

Swamps are prevalent in the eastern areas, such as Shatursky and Lukhovitsky Districts. The natural floodplain meadows are almost gone. The number of native plant species is reduced, but some foreign species flourish, such as Canadian maple. Endemic species include water caltrop and lady&#x27;s slipper.

===Fauna===
The mammals of Moscow Oblast include badger, squirrel, beaver, otter, muskrat, stoat, Russian desman, raccoon dog, hedgehog, hare (mountain and European), shrews (common shrew, Eurasian pygmy shrew, lesser white-toothed shrew, Eurasian water shrew, etc.), weasel, fox, moose, wild boar, European mole, brown and black rats, marten, mice and voles (wood mouse, yellow-necked mouse, house mouse, Eurasian harvest mouse, northern birch mouse, bank vole, field vole, tundra vole, European water vole), European mink, deer (roe, red, spotted), hazel and fat dormouse, and European polecat. At the borders there are occasional bears, lynxes and wolves. In the southern areas there are also speckled ground squirrel, dwarf hamster, great jerboa and beech marten. Some areas contain stable populations of imported animals, such as flying squirrel, American mink and Siberian roe deer. In the oblast, there are more than a dozen kinds of bat and moth.

There are more than 170 species of birds in the area with large numbers of crows, sparrows, ducks, magpies, woodpeckers, thrushes, grouses, bullfinches, nightingales, corncrakes, northern lapwings, white storks, grey herons, seagulls and grebes. Over forty species are being hunted.

Rivers and lakes of Moscow Oblast are rich in fish, such as ruffe, carp, bream, bass, roaches, Chinese sleeper, perch and pike. There are six species of reptiles: three lizards (slowworm, viviparous lizard and sand lizard) and three snakes (European adder, grass snake and smooth snake). There is evidence for bog turtles in some areas. Amphibians are represented by 11 species including smooth newt, great crested newt, common toad, European green toad, common frog, moor frog, marsh frog, common spadefoot and European fire-bellied toad. Insects are numerous, with bees alone accounting for more than 300 species.

In Serpukhovsky District, there is the Prioksko-Terrasny Nature Reserve which contains protected wisents. Near Moscow lies Losiny Ostrov National Park of federal significance.
===Environment===
The ecological situation in the Moscow Oblast is serious. The areas adjacent to Moscow, and industrial zones in the east and south-east regions are heavily polluted. Most contamination originates from emissions from Kashira and Shatura Power Stations and disposal of household and industrial waste. For example, the Timohovskaya dump is one of the largest in Europe; other objects of concern are aging oil storage tanks, and nuclear waste in the Sergiyevo-Posadsky District. Contamination level is highest in Moscow, Voskresensk and Klin, high in Dzerzhinsky, Kolomna, Mytishchi, Podolsk, Serpukhov, Shchyolkovo, and Elektrostal, and low in Prioksko-Terrasny Biosphere Reserve. The major contaminants are formaldehyde and phenol in Moscow; ammonia and hydrogen fluoride
in Voskresensk; formaldehyde in Klin, Kolomna, Mytishchi and Podolsk, phenol in Serpukhov. The most polluted rivers are Moscow, Oka and Klyazma. In the Moscow area and in major cities (in particular, in Podolsk, Orekhovo-Zuyevo, Serpukhov, Lukhovitsy and Stupino) also heavily polluted are groundwaters.
==History==
The territory of what is now Moscow Oblast had been inhabited for more than twenty thousand years. Numerous mounds and settlements from Iron Age were discovered there. Up to the 9–10th centuries, the Moskva River basin and adjacent lands were inhabited by Finnic peoples. Slavs populated the area only in the 10th century. In mid-12th century, the lands became part of Vladimir-Suzdal Principality. Several important cities were founded around that time, including Volokolamsk (1135), Moscow (1147), Zvenigorod (1152), and Dmitrov (1154). In the first half of the 13th century, the entire Vladimir-Suzdal Principality, including the Moscow area, was conquered by the Mongols.
In the 13th century, the land around Moscow was part of Grand Duchy of Moscow, which subsequently was the center of the unification of Russian lands, in particular the Mongol raids. In 1380, from Kolomna the prince Dmitry Donskoy led his troops to defeat the Mongols at the Battle of Kulikovo. The southern part of Moscow Oblast was then part of the Principality of Ryazan; it was attached to Moscow only in the 1520.

In 1708, Moscow Governorate was established by the decree of Peter the Great; the area included most of the present Moscow Oblast. The Battle of Borodino, which decided the outcome of the French invasion of Russia was fought in 1812 near Mozhaysk.

Industries developed in Moscow Oblast in the 17–19th centuries. They were centered in Bogorodsk, Pavlovsky Posad, and Orekhovo-Zuyevo and were dominated by textile production. The first railway in Russia was constructed in the Moscow Oblast in 1851, connecting Moscow and Saint Petersburg, and in 1862 the line to Nizhny Novgorod was opened.

In the Russian SFSR, &quot;Central Industrial Oblast&quot; was established on January 14, 1929. It included the abolished Moscow, Ryazan, Tver, Tula, Vladimir, and Kaluga Governorates. The oblast was divided into ten okrugs and had the administrative center in Moscow. On June 3, 1929, the area was renamed &quot;Moscow Oblast&quot; and on July 30, 1930, the division into ten okrugs was abolished.

Parts of the then bulky &quot;Moscow Oblast&quot; were gradually transferred to other divisions. In particular, twenty-six districts became part of Kalinin Oblast in January 1935, and another seventy-seven districts were separated in September 1937 as Tula and Ryazan Oblasts. Borovsky, , Maloyaroslavetsky, Ugodsko-Zavodsky, and Petushinsky Districts were transferred in 1944 to Kaluga and Vladimir Oblasts.

In 1941 and 1942, one of the most significant military operations of World War II—the Battle of Moscow—was fought in the Moscow Oblast. Germany reached Solnechnogorsky, Klinsky, Istrinsky, Lobninsky, Khimkinsky, Naro-Fominsky, Volokolamsky, Kolomensky, Kashirsky, Serybryano-Prudsky Districts and others.

According to the Constitution of Russia, adopted in December 1993, Moscow Oblast is one of the 83 federal subjects of Russia.

==Economy==

===Industry===
In terms of industrial production, Moscow Oblast is second in Russia, after the city of Moscow. The industry of the Oblast relies on imported raw materials, strong scientific and technological base and highly skilled workforce; it is closely linked with the industry of Moscow.

Well developed are machinery and metalworking. There are plants for the thermal and nuclear power engineering (ZiO-Podolsk in Podolsk), nuclear fuel (TVEL in Elektrostal), space and missile (Energia in Korolyov, Lavochkin in Khimki, NGO engineering in Reutov, FTSDT &quot;Union&quot; in Dzerzhinsky – development of solid rocket fuel, etc., IBC &quot;Horizon&quot; in Dzerzhinsky – power plants for aircraft, etc.); locomotives (Kolomna factory), metro cars (Metrowagonmash in Mytischi), electric trains (Demikhovsky Engineering Works), cars (SeAZ), buses (Likinsky bus plant in Likino-Dulyovo); agricultural machines, excavators and cranes (Lyubertsy, Dmitrov, Balashikha); stainless steel (Elektrostal), cables (Podolsk), optical devices (Krasnogorsky plant, Lytkarino Optical Glass Factory).

There are many defense enterprises, such as Russian Center for demonstrations of weapons, military equipment and technology in Krasnoarmeysk; Kamov, Phazotron, Bazalt, NPP Zvezda, MKB Fakel, MKB Raduga, National Research Institute of Aviation Systems, Krasnozavodsk Chemical Plant, Tikhomirov Scientific Research Institute of Instrument Design, Moscow Research Institute &quot;Agat&quot;, Dolgoprudnenskoe Scientific Production Plant, and many others.

Chemical industry of the Oblast produces acids (Shchyolkovo), mineral fertilizers (plants named &quot;Phosphates&quot; and &quot;Mineral fertilizers&quot; in Voskresensk), synthetic fibers (Serpukhov and Klin), plastics (Orekhovo-Zuyevo), varnishes and paints (Sergiyev Posad, Odintsovsky paint factories), pharmaceuticals (Staraya Kupavna). There is a well-developed industry of construction materials with production of cement in Voskresensk and Kolomna (Shchurovsky cement factory), earthenware, porcelain in the Likino-Dulyovo (Dulevo Porcelain Factory) and Verbilki and dry mortar plant in Krasnogorsk.

Light industry is the oldest in the region; it was started in the 17th century and with 35% contribution was leading the gross industrial production. There is still production of cotton (in Yegoryevsk, Noginsk, Orekhovo-Zuyevo), wool (in Pavlovsky Posad and Pushkino) and jerseys (in Ivanteyevka and Dmitrov). The silk production in Naro-Fominsk had been stopped. Traditional and renowned crafts include Gzhel, Zhostovo painting and Fedoskino miniature. Large foreign investment projects include the plant for manufacturing household appliances (TV sets, washing machines, refrigerators, etc.) by the South Korean company LG built near the village of Dorokhovo.

===Energy===
In 1999, Moscow Oblast consumed 15.4 billion m3 of natural gas, 3.32 million tonnes of oil, 2.13 million tonnes of coal and 8.5 billion kWh of electricity. Electricity for the Oblast is provided by the Kashirskaya thermal power plant (TPP, 1910 MW), Dzerzhynskaya TPP No 22 (1300 MW), Thermal Power Plant 27 (1100 MW), Shatura Power Station (1100 MW), Zagorskaya hydroelectric power plant (1200 MW), Elektrogorsk TPP (623 MW) and several smaller plants. Major new energy project in the region is the construction of Zagorsk hydroelectric plant with the capacity of 840 MW. The deficit of energy is provided by powerlines connecting the region with Saint Petersburg, Volga Hydroelectric Station and other energy suppliers.

===Agriculture===
Agriculture has a relatively minor role in the economy of the Oblast. Only 25% of land is cultivated and another 15% are used for other activities such as livestock farming. Agriculture is the least developed in the northern, eastern and western border regions. In the southern region, especially south of the Oka River, more than 50% of land is used in agriculture. Horticulture is typical for the southern region with most of the sown area (more than 3/5) occupied by forage crops. Large areas are reserved for grains, especially wheat, barley, oats and rye, and significant role plays potato. Greenhouses are very common and Moskovsky city hosts the largest greenhouse complex in Europe. Also grown are flowers and mushrooms. Livestock farming predominates over the crop, and is primarily aimed at the production of milk and meat. In addition to cattle, commonly bred are pigs and chickens.

The economic crisis of the 1990s in Russia had severely affected the agriculture of Moscow Oblast. In particular, in the 2000s, as compared with 1970–80s, the grain production has fallen by more than 3 times; potatoes by 2.5 times; vegetables, livestock and poultry by 30%; milk by 2 times and eggs by 4 times.

===Transport===

Moscow Oblast has a dense transport network, including roads, railways and waterways along the largest rivers, lakes and reservoirs. Land routes are radially diverging from Moscow and crossed by one railway and two highway rings. Neither railways nor roads, built for the most part many years ago, can cope with the steadily mounting traffic flows. About half of the roads are overloaded and three quarters do not meet modern requirements. Insufficient width of the roads and frequent repairs cause traffic jams.

Moscow Oblast has the highest density of railways in Russia. Eleven major radial lines originate in Moscow and run through the Oblast; the total length of the railways reaches 2,700 km. Almost all railroads are electrified. The largest rail hubs are Orekhovo-Zuyevo and Bekasovo. Regular navigation is carried on the rivers Volga, Oka and Moscow, as well as on the Moscow Canal. Major river ports are in Serpukhov and Kolomna. Also well-developed is pipeline transport. There are two major oil lines, two natural gas rings and numerous radial lines connecting Moscow with the largest gas producing regions of the country.

Moscow and Moscow Oblast have several international passenger airports, namely Sheremetyevo (with two terminals), Vnukovo, Domodedovo and Ostafyevo. There is also Bykovo Airport, which is used for freight. The largest military airport is Chkalovsky (near Shchyolkovo) which also processes some civilian passenger and cargo flights.

==Government and awards==
Moscow Oblast was awarded three Orders of Lenin, on 3 January 1934, 17 December 1956 and 5 December 1966.

The highest executive organ is the Government of Moscow Oblast. Eighteen ministries act as the executive bodies of state authority. The powers, tasks, functions and competence of the Government are defined by the Charter of the Moscow Region. The Governor of the Moscow Oblast will be elected with the term of 5 years. The Regional Duma of Moscow Oblast was formed on 12 December 1993. It consists of 50 deputies also serving a 5-year term.

Sergey Shoygu was elected as Governor of Moscow Oblast in April 2012 by the Moscow Oblast Duma. Shoygu left office after only six months with his appointment when he was appointed as Minister of Defence by Vladimir Putin. Andrei Vorobyov was appointed as acting governor and won a full term to the office in the 2013 elections.

==Science==
Moscow Oblast has a high density of scientific research institutions, especially related to engineering and military technologies. The latter started developing in the region in 1930–1940s in Zhukovsky (aeronautical engineering), Klimovsk (development of small arms), Reutov (Missile Engineering), Fryazino (microwave electronics) and Korolyov (space technology). They were later joined by famous centers for basic sciences in Troitsk, Chernogolovka (physics and chemistry), Dubna and Protvino (nuclear physics) and Pushchino (biology). Moscow Oblast hosts Mission Control Centers for spacecraft (in Korolyov) and military satellites (Krasnoznamensk), as well as a number of test sites.

==Sport==
===Bandy===
Zorky from Krasnogorsk has become national bandy champions three times. In the 2017–18 season, Zorky is back in Super League, after one season in the second-tier league. Obukhovo is the only location in Russia without a Super League team which has a bandy venue with artificial ice. A plan for artificial ice also existed in Korolyov. However, the project was abandoned. Although an indoor ice hockey-sized arena entered the plans instead, the official reason given was financial problems.

The Russian Rink Bandy Cup 2017 was played in Balashikha.

===Speed skating===
The 2008 European Speed Skating Championships and the 2016 World Single Distance Speed Skating Championships were held in Kolomna.

===Association football===
FK Khimki and Saturn Ramenskoye are the most supported clubs that represent the region. The third professional club Znamya Truda is the oldest existing football club in the country founded in 1909.

==Culture and recreation==

Moscow Oblast has numerous therapeutic and recreational facilities located mainly in western, northwestern and northern parts, and also near Moscow. Of great importance for recreation are forests, which occupy over 40% of the region, as well as horticultural activities. The region has the highest number (over 1 million) of dachas with associated individual gardens. Also numerous are manor complexes, such as those in Abramtsevo, Muranovo, Ostafievo, historical towns (Vereya, Volokolamsk, Dmitrov, Zaraysk, Zvenigorod, Istra, Kolomna, Sergiyev Posad, Serpukhov, etc.), monasteries (Trinity Lavra of St. Sergius, Joseph-Volokolamsk Monastery, Savvino-Storozhevsky Monastery, Nikolo-Ugresh monastery, etc.), and museums (Chekhov museum in Melikhovo, Tchaikovsky museum in Klin, Serpukhov Historical and Art Museum, etc.). The oldest surviving building is the Kamenskoye Church.

== Demographics ==

After the population decline from 6,693,623 as of the 1989 Census to 6,618,538 in the 2002 Census the population of the oblast grew to 7,095,120 (2010 Census). It increased further to 8,524,665 according to the 2021 Census despite the fact that some parts of its territory were ceded to Moscow. The average population density, at 190 inhabitants/km2 (2021), is the largest in Russia, due to a high proportion of urban population (78.5% in 2021). The highest density occurs in and around Moscow (Lyubertsy, Balashikha, Khimki, Krasnogorsk, etc.) and the lowest – about 20 people/km2 – is in the outlying areas of Lotoshinsky, Shakhovskoy, Mozhaysk and Meshchersk lowlands.

=== Ethnic groups in Moscow Oblast (2021 Census) ===
===Vital statistics===
Vital statistics for 2024:
*Births: 71,434 (8.3 per 1,000)
*Deaths: 96,608 (11.2 per 1,000)

Total fertility rate (2024):
1.34 children per woman

Life expectancy (2021): 
Total — 70.35 years (male — 65.73, female — 74.80)

===Religion===
According to a 2012 survey 45.5% of the population of Moscow Oblast adheres to the Russian Orthodox Church, 3% are unaffiliated generic Christians, 2% are Orthodox Christian believers who do not belong to church or belong to non-Russian Orthodox churches, 1% are adherents of Rodnovery (the Slavic folk religious movement) and 1% to Islam. In addition, 29% of the population declares to be &quot;spiritual but not religious&quot;, 9% is Non-Religious, and 9.5% follows other religions or did not give an answer to the question.
==Administrative and municipal divisions==

Administratively, the oblast is divided into 38 cities/towns under oblast jurisdiction and 36 administrative districts, consisting of 46 towns of district significance, 72 urban-type settlements, and 6,119 rural localities.

As of 2011, Moscow Oblast is municipally subdivided into 38 urban okrugs and 36 municipal districts, which consist of 114 urban settlements and 193 rural settlements.
The three largest cities of the oblast are Balashikha (215,494), Khimki (207,425), and Podolsk (186,961). Most other towns have ten to fifty thousand people. The smallest town is Vereya in Naro-Fominsky District with the population of . Among the urban-type settlements, the largest is Nakhabino (36,546) followed by Tomilino (30,605). The oldest populated place in the oblast is Volokolamsk, first mentioned in 1135; slightly younger towns are Zvenigorod (1152), Dmitrov (1154), and Kolomna (1177).

The city of Baikonur in Kazakhstan also belongs administratively to the oblast, as part of Odintsovsky District.

The most intensive formation of towns occurred in 1938–1940. The youngest towns are Golitsyno and Kubinka. They existed for quite some time, but were granted town status only in 2004. Some recent towns separated from the other towns, such as Yubileyny and Peresvet.

New projects have been announced at the beginning of the 21st century. One of them is Rublyovo-Arkhangelsk, which is designed for 30,000 inhabitants with high income and is called by the media the &quot;city for millionaires&quot;. Another is &quot;Great Domodedovo, south of the Moscow Ring Road, which is designed for 450,000 residents. The new city A101 was designed for 300,000 residents in 2009 and the sale of its land in Leninsky District has already begun; the city&#x27;s construction is planned to take thirty-five years.

A part of Moscow Oblast&#x27;s former territory, mainly to the southwest of the city of Moscow, was merged with the federal city of Moscow on July 1, 2012.

The housing stock of the oblast is approximately 125 million square meters. Almost all the houses are equipped with water supply, sewerage, gas, central heating and hot water. However, the telephone network is underdeveloped in rural areas. In the competition for the most comfortable city of 2006 in the Moscow Oblast the winner was Kolomna followed by Balashikha (for cities with population over 100,000) and Vidnoye (&lt;100,000) and then by Mytishchi and Noginsk.
