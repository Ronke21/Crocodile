<text>Makassarese (, ), sometimes called Makasar, Makassar, or Macassar, is a language of the Makassarese people, spoken in South Sulawesi province of Indonesia. It is a member of the South Sulawesi group of the Austronesian language family, and thus closely related to, among others, Buginese, also known as Bugis. The areas where Makassarese is spoken include the Gowa, Sinjai, Maros, Takalar, Jeneponto, Bantaeng, Pangkajene and Islands, Bulukumba, and Selayar Islands Regencies, and Makassar. Within the Austronesian language family, Makassarese is part of the South Sulawesi language group, although its vocabulary is considered divergent compared to its closest relatives. In 2000, Makassarese had approximately 2.1 million native speakers.

== Classification ==
Makassarese is an Austronesian language from the South Sulawesi branch of the Malayo-Polynesian subfamily, specifically the Makassaric group, which also includes both Highland and Coastal Konjo languages and the Selayar language. The Konjo and Selayar language varieties are sometimes considered dialects of Makassarese. As part of the South Sulawesi language family, Makassarese is also closely related to the Bugis, Mandar, and Toraja-Saʼdan languages.

In terms of vocabulary, Makassarese is considered the most distinct among the South Sulawesi languages. The average percentage of vocabulary similarity between Makassarese and other South Sulawesi languages is only 43%. Specifically, the Gowa or Lakiung dialect is the most divergent; the vocabulary similarity of this dialect with other South Sulawesi languages is about 5–10 percentage points lower compared to the vocabulary similarity of Konjo and Selayar with other South Sulawesi languages. However, etymostatistical analysis and functor statistics conducted by linguist Ülo Sirk shows a higher vocabulary similarity percentage (≥ 60%) between Makassarese and other South Sulawesi languages. These quantitative findings support qualitative analyses that place Makassarese as part of the South Sulawesi language family.

=== Dialect ===
The language varieties within the Makassaric group form a dialect continuum. A language survey in South Sulawesi conducted by linguists and anthropologists Charles and Barbara Grimes separated the Konjo and Selayar languages from Makassarese. Meanwhile, a subsequent survey by linguists Timothy Friberg and Thomas Laskowske divided the Konjo language into three varieties: Coastal Konjo, Highland Konjo, and Bentong/Dentong. However, in a book on Makassarese grammar published by the Center for Language Development and Cultivation, local linguist Abdul Kadir Manyambeang and his team include the Konjo and Selayar varieties as dialects of Makassarese.

Excluding the Konjo and Selayar varieties, Makassarese can be divided into at least three dialects: the Gowa or Lakiung dialect, the Jeneponto or Turatea dialect, and the Bantaeng dialect. The main differences among these varieties within the Makassar group lie in vocabulary; their grammatical structures are generally quite similar. Speakers of the Gowa dialect tend to switch to Indonesian when communicating with speakers of the Bantaeng dialect or with speakers of the Konjo and Selayar languages, and vice versa. The Gowa dialect is generally considered the prestige variety of Makassarese. As the dialect spoken in the central region, the Gowa dialect is also commonly used by speakers of other varieties within the Makassaric group.

== Distribution ==
According to a demographic study based on the 2010 census data, about 1.87 million Indonesians over the age of five speak Makassarese as their mother tongue. Nationally, Makassarese ranks 16th among the 20 languages with the most speakers. Makassar is also the second most-spoken language in Sulawesi after Bugis, which has over 3.5 million speakers.

The Makassarese language is primarily spoken by the Makassar people, although a small percentage (1.89%) of the Bugis people also use it as their mother tongue. Makassarese speakers are concentrated in the southwestern peninsula of South Sulawesi, particularly in the fertile coastal areas around Makassar, Gowa Regency, and Takalar Regency. The language is also spoken by some residents of Maros Regency and Pangkajene and Islands Regency to the north, alongside Bugis. Residents of Jeneponto and Bantaeng Regencies generally identify themselves as part of the Makassarese-speaking community, although the varieties they speak (the Jeneponto or Turatea dialect and the Bantaeng dialect) differ significantly from the dialects used in Gowa and Takalar. The closely-related Konjo language is spoken in the mountainous areas of Gowa and along the coast of Bulukumba Regency, while the Selayar language is spoken on Selayar Island, to the south of the peninsula.

Due to Makassarese contact with Aboriginal peoples in Northern Australia, a pidgin of Makassarese was used as &quot;lingua franca&quot; across the region between different Aboriginal groups, though its use declined starting in the early 20th century due to Australian restrictions against Makassarese fishermen in the region and was supplanted by English as a &quot;lingua franca&quot;.

== Current status ==
Makassarese is one of the relatively well-developed regional languages in Indonesia. It is still widely used in rural areas and parts of Makassar. Makassarese is also considered important as a marker of ethnic identity. However, in urban communities, code-switching or code-mixing between Makassar and Indonesian is common. Some urban Makassar residents, especially those from the middle class or with multiethnic backgrounds, also use Indonesian as the primary language in their households. Ethnologue classifies Makassar as a 6b (Threatened) language on the EGIDS scale, indicating that although the language is still commonly used in face-to-face conversations, the natural intergenerational transmission or teaching of the language is beginning to be disrupted.

== Phonology ==
The following description of Makassarese phonology is based on Jukes (2005).

=== Vowels ===
Makassarese has five vowels: , , , , . The mid vowels are lowered to and in absolute final position and in the vowel sequences and .

The vowel phoneme tends to be realized as the open-mid vowel when it is at the end of a word or before a syllable containing the sound . Compare, for instance, the pronunciation of in the word &#x27;already&#x27; with &#x27;go to&#x27;. The phoneme also has an open-mid allophone [ɔ] when it is at the end of a word or precedes a syllable containing the sound [ɔ], as seen in the word &#x27;big&#x27; (compare with &#x27;heavy&#x27;). Regardless of their position within a word, some speakers tend to pronounce these two vowels with a higher (closer) tongue position, making their pronunciation approach that of the phonemes and .

Vowels can be pronounced nasally when they are around nasal consonants within the same syllable. There are two levels of nasalization intensity for vowels: strong nasalization and weak nasalization. Weak nasalization can be found on vowels before nasal consonants that are not at the end of a word. Strong nasalization can be found on vowels before final nasal consonants or generally after nasal consonants. Nasalization can spread to vowels in syllables after nasal vowels if there are no consonants blocking it. However, the intensity of nasalization in vowels like this is not as strong as in the vowels before them, as in the pronunciation of the word &#x27;there is&#x27;.

=== Consonants ===
There are 17 consonants in Makassarese, as outlined in the following table.

Makassarese consonants except the glottal stop and voiced plosives can be geminated. Some instances of these might result from Proto-Malayo-Polynesian schwa phoneme &quot;*&quot; (now merged into &quot;&quot;), which geminated the following consonant (&quot;*bəli&quot; &gt; &quot;*bəlli&quot; &gt; &#x27;to buy, price&#x27; (compare Indonesian ), contrasting with &#x27;to oppose&#x27;).

The phoneme is the only consonant with a dental pronunciation, unlike the phonemes , which are alveolar consonants. The voiceless plosive phonemes are generally pronounced with slight aspiration (a flow of air), as in the words &#x27;we&#x27;, &#x27;go&#x27;, and &#x27;say&#x27;. The phonemes and have implosive allophones and , especially in word-initial positions, such as in &#x27;widow&#x27;, and after the sound , as in &#x27;to let hang&#x27;. These two consonants, especially in word-initial positions, can also be realized as voiceless consonants without aspiration. The palatal phoneme can be realized as an affricate (a stop sound with a release of fricative) or even . The phoneme can also be pronounced as an affricate . Jukes analyzes both of these consonants as stop consonants because they have palatal nasal counterparts , just as other oral stop consonants have their own nasal counterparts.

=== Phonotactics ===
The basic structure of syllables in Makassarese is ()(). The position of C1 can be filled by almost any consonant, while the position of C2 has some limitations. In syllables located at the end of a morpheme, C2 can be filled by a stop (T) or a nasal (N), the pronunciation of which is determined by assimilation rules. The sound T assimilates with (is pronounced the same as) voiceless consonants except , and is realized as in other contexts. The sound N is realized as a homorganic nasal (pronounced at the same articulation place) before a stop or nasal consonant, assimilates with the consonant&#x27;s and , and is realized as in other contexts. On the other hand, in syllables within root forms, Makassarese contrasts an additional sound in the C2 position besides K and N, which is . This analysis is based on the fact that Makassarese distinguishes between the sequences , , and across syllables. However, can also be considered as the realization of a geminate segment rather than a sequence across syllables.

The sounds can be categorized as non-nasal continuous (sounds produced without fully obstructing the flow of air through the mouth) consonants, and none of them can occupy the final position of a syllable except as part of a geminate consonant sequence. Basic words that actually end with these consonants will be appended with an epenthetic vowel identical to the vowel in the preceding syllable, and closed with a glottal stop , as in the words &#x27;rope&#x27;, &#x27;bottle&#x27;, and &#x27;mess, untidy&#x27;. This additional element is also referred to as the &quot;VC-geminate&quot; (echo-VC) sequence, and it can affect the position of stress within a word.

Generally, base words in Makassarese consist of two or three syllables. However, longer words can be formed due to the agglutinative nature of Makassarese and the highly productive reduplication process. According to Jukes, words with six or seven syllables are commonly found in Makassarese, while base words with just one syllable (that are not borrowed from other languages) are very rare, although there are some interjections and particles consisting of only one syllable.

All consonants except for can appear in initial position. In final position, only and are found.

Consonant clusters only occur medially and (with one exception) can be analyzed as clusters of or + consonant. These clusters also arise through sandhi across morpheme boundaries.

The geminate cluster is only found in root-internal position and cannot be accounted for by the above rules.

Sequences of like vowels are contracted to a single vowel; e.g., &#x27;to wash&#x27; + &#x27;nominalizing suffix&#x27; &gt; &#x27;laundry&#x27;, &#x27;small&#x27; + &#x27;third person&#x27; &gt; &#x27;it is small&#x27;.

=== Stress ===
The stress is generally placed on the penultimate (second-last) syllable of a base word. In reduplicated words, secondary stress will be placed on the first element, as in the word &#x27;to fish (casually)&#x27;. Suffixes are generally counted as part of the phonological unit receiving stress, while enclitics are not counted (extrametrical). For example, the word &#x27;strong&#x27;, if the benefactive suffix is added, becomes &#x27;stronger than&#x27; with stress on the penultimate syllable, but if given the first-person marker enclitic , it becomes &#x27;I am strong&#x27;, with stress on the antepenultimate syllable (third-last).

Other morphemes counted as part of the stress-bearing unit include the affixal clitic, marking possession, as in the word (buffalo=.) &#x27;my buffalo&#x27;. Particularly for the definite marker , this morpheme is counted as part of the stress-bearing unit only if the base word it attaches to ends in a vowel, as in the word &#x27;the stone&#x27;—compare with the stress pattern in &#x27;the dog&#x27;, where the base word ends in a consonant. A word can have stress on the preantepenultimate (fourth-last) syllable if a two-syllable enclitic combination such as ( , ) is appended; e.g., &#x27;go up!&#x27; The stress position can also be influenced by the process of vocalic degemination, where identical vowels across morphemes merge into one. For example, the word &#x27;walk&#x27;, when the suffix -ang is added, becomes &#x27;to walk with&#x27;, with stress on the ultimate (last) syllable.

The stress on base words with VC-geminate always falls on the antepenultimate syllable; for example, &#x27;layer&#x27;, &#x27;bottle&#x27;, &#x27;market&#x27;, and &#x27;Makassar&#x27;, because syllables with VK-geminate are extrametrical. However, the addition of suffixes and will remove this epenthetic syllable and move the stress to the penultimate position, as in the word &#x27;to layer&#x27;. Adding the possessive clitic suffix also shifts the stress to the penultimate position but does not remove this epenthetic syllable, as in the word &#x27;its bottle&#x27;. Meanwhile, the addition of the definite marker and enclitics neither remove nor alter the stress position of this syllable, as in the words &#x27;that market&#x27; and &#x27;I&#x27;m going to the market&#x27;.

== Grammar ==

=== Pronouns ===
Personal pronouns in the Makassar language have three forms, namely:
* free forms;
* proclitics that cross-reference S and P arguments (&#x27;absolutive&#x27;);
* and enclitics that cross-reference A arguments (&#x27;ergative&#x27;).

The following table shows these three forms of pronouns along with possessive markers for each series.

The first person plural inclusive pronouns are also used to refer to the second person plural and serve as a form of respect for the second person singular. The first person plural pronoun series is commonly used to refer to the first person plural in modern Makassar; pronouns and possessive marker are considered archaic, while the enclitic can only appear in combination with clitic markers of modality and aspect, such as ( , . ). The plural meaning can be expressed more clearly by adding the word &#x27;all&#x27; after the free form, as in &#x27;they all&#x27; and &#x27;you all&#x27;, or before the enclitic, as in &#x27;they all&#x27;. However, cannot be paired with proclitics.

Proclitic and enclitic forms are the most common pronominal forms used to refer to the person or object being addressed (see the #Basic Clauses section for examples of their use). Free forms are less frequently used; their use is generally limited to presentative clauses (clauses that state or introduce something, see example 1), for emphasis (2), in prepositional phrases functioning as arguments or adjuncts (3), and as predicates (4).



=== Nouns and noun phrases ===

==== Characteristics and types of nouns ====

Nouns in Makassarese are a class of words that can function as arguments for a predicate, allowing them to be cross-referenced by pronominal clitics. Nouns can also serve as the head of a noun phrase (including relative clauses). In possessive constructions, nouns can act as either the possessor or the possessed; an affixal clitic will be attached to the possessed noun phrase. The indefiniteness of a noun can be expressed by the affixal clitic . Uninflected nouns can also function as predicates in a sentence. All of these main points are illustrated in the following example:

In addition, nouns can also be specified by demonstratives, modified by adjectives, quantified by numerals, become complements in prepositional phrases, and become verbs meaning &#x27;wear/use [the noun in question]&#x27; when affixed with the prefix .

Nouns that are usually affixed with the definite clitic and possessive markers are common nouns. On the other hand, proper nouns such as place names, personal names, and titles (excluding kinship terms) are usually not affixed with definiteness and possessive markers but can be paired with the personal prefix like pronouns.

Some common nouns are generic nouns that often become the core of a compound word, such as the words &#x27;water&#x27;, &#x27;excrement&#x27;, and &#x27;child&#x27;. Examples of compound words derived from these generic nouns are &#x27;drinking water&#x27;, &#x27;wax, beeswax&#x27; (literal meaning: &#x27;bee excrement&#x27;), and &#x27;daughter&#x27;. Kinship terms that are commonly used as greetings are also classified as common nouns, such as the words &#x27;father&#x27;, &#x27;mother&#x27;, and &#x27;sibling&#x27;. Another example is the word which is used as a polite greeting in general, or by a wife to her husband.

The other main noun group is temporal nouns, which usually appear after prepositions in adjunct constructions to express time. Examples of temporal nouns are clock times (such as &#x27;5.00 [five o&#x27;clock]&#x27;), estimated times based on divisions of the day (such as &#x27;morning&#x27;), days of the week, as well as dates, months, and seasons.

==== Derived noun ====
Derived nouns in Makassarese are formed through several productive morphological processes, such as reduplication and affixation with , , and , either individually or in combination. The following table illustrates some common noun formation processes in Makassarese:

There are some exceptions to the general patterns described above. For example, reduplication of the word &#x27; &#x27;worm&#x27; to &#x27; results in a broadening of meaning to &#x27;animal&#x27;. The affixation of &#x27; to a verb base does not always indicate an instrument or tool, for example &#x27; &#x27;breath, character, heart&#x27; (as in the phrase &#x27; &#x27;big-hearted&#x27;) which is derived from the word &#x27; &#x27;to breathe&#x27;. The affixation of &#x27; to the verb base &#x27; &#x27;to give birth&#x27; results in the word &quot; meaning &#x27;family&#x27;, although it is possible that this word was originally a metaphor (&#x27;place to have children&#x27;).

==== Noun phrase ====
The components of noun phrases in the Makassarese can be categorized into three groups, namely 1) head, 2) specifier, and 3) modifier.

Modifying elements always follow the head noun-they may be of various types:
* modifying nouns, such as &quot; &#x27;wild boar&#x27; (lit. pig forest)
* adjectives, such as &quot; &#x27;big fish&#x27;
* modifying verbs, such as &quot; &#x27;airplane&#x27; (lit. flying ship)
* possessors, such as &quot;&quot; &#x27;Ali&#x27;s buffalo&#x27;
* relative clauses
In Makassarese, relative clauses are placed directly after the head noun without any special marker (unlike Indonesian, which requires a word like &quot;&#x27; before the relative clause). The verb within the relative clause is marked with the definite marker &#x27;.

=== Basic clause ===

==== Intransitive clauses ====
In Makassarese intransitive clauses, the &#x27;absolutive&#x27; enclitic (=) is used to cross-reference the sole argument in the clause (S) if that argument is definite or salient according to the conversational context. This enclitic tends to be attached to the first constituent in a clause. The prefix is commonly used to form intransitive verbs, although some verbs like &quot;tinro&quot; &#x27;sleep&#x27; do not require this prefix.

Many other types of phrases may head intransitive clauses, for example nominals (13) and pronoun (example (4) above), adjectives (14), or a prepositional phrase (15): 


==== Transitive clauses ====
Verbs in transitive clauses are not affixed, but instead are marked with a pronominal proclitic indicating the A or actor and a pronominal enclitic indicating the P or undergoer.

== Writing systems ==

Although Makassarese is now often written in Latin script, Makassarese has been traditionally written with Lontara script and Makasar script, which once was used also to write important documents in Bugis and Mandar, two related languages from Sulawesi. Further, Makassarese was written in the Serang script, a variant of the Arabic-derived Jawi script. Texts written in the Serang script are relatively rare, and mostly appear in connection with Islam-related topics. Parts of the &quot;Makassar Annals&quot;, the chronicles of the Gowa and Tallo&#x27; kingdoms, were also written using the Serang script.

=== Latin based system ===
The current Latin-based forms:


=== Old Makassar and Lontara script ===
Makassarese was historically written using Makasar script (also known as &quot;Old Makassarese&quot; or &quot;Makassarese bird script&quot; in English-language scholarly works).
In Makassarese the script is known as or (&#x27;bird letters&#x27;). It was used for official purposes in the kingdoms of Makasar in the 17th century but ceased to be used by the 19th century, being replaced by Lontara script.

In spite of their quite distinctive appearance, both the Makasar and Lontara scripts are derived from the ancient Brahmi script of India. Like other descendants of that script, each consonant has an inherent vowel &quot;a&quot;, which is not marked. Other vowels can be indicated by adding diacritics above, below, or on either side of each consonant.
==== Ambiguity ====
Both scripts do not have a virama or other ways to write syllable codas in a consistent manner, even though codas occur regularly in Makassar. For example, in Makassar is &quot;baba&quot; which can correspond to six possible words: &quot;baba, babaʼ, baʼba, baʼbaʼ, bamba,&quot; and &quot;bambang&quot;.

Given that Lontara script is also traditionally written without word breaks, a typical text often has many ambiguous portions which can often only be disambiguated through context. This ambiguity is analogous to the use of Arabic letters without vowel markers; readers whose native language use Arabic characters intuitively understand which vowels are appropriate in a given sentence so that vowel markers are not needed in standard everyday texts.

Even so, sometimes even context is not sufficient. In order to read a text fluently, readers may need substantial prior knowledge of the language and contents of the text in question. As an illustration, Cummings and Jukes provide the following example to illustrate how the Lontara script can produce different meanings depending on how the reader cuts and fills in the ambiguous part:

Without knowing the actual event to which the text may be referring, it can be impossible for first time readers to determine the &quot;correct&quot; reading of the above examples. Even the most proficient readers may need to pause and re-interpret what they have read as new context is revealed in later portions of the same text. Due to this ambiguity, some writers such as Noorduyn labelled Lontara as a defective script.

=== Serang script ===
After Islam arrived in 1605, and with Malay traders using the Arabic-based Jawi script, Makassarese could also be written using Arabic letters. This was called &#x27;serang&#x27; and was better at capturing the spoken language than the original Makassarese scripts because it could show consonants at the ends of syllables. But it wasn&#x27;t widely used, with only a few surviving manuscripts. One key example is the diary of the Gowa and Tallo&#x27; courts, translated from serang into Dutch. However, Arabic script is commonly found in manuscripts to write Islamic names, dates, and religious ideas

<doc id="366985" wikidata="Q13324" url="?curid=366985" title="Minangkabau language">
<text>Minangkabau (Minangkabau: , Jawi script: ; ) is an Austronesian language spoken by the Minangkabau of West Sumatra, the western part of Riau, South Aceh Regency, the northern part of Bengkulu and Jambi, also in several cities throughout Indonesia by migrated Minangkabau. The language is also a lingua franca along the western coastal region of the province of North Sumatra, and is even used in parts of Aceh, where the language is called &quot;Aneuk Jamee&quot;.

Minangkabau is similar to Malay. The relationship between the languages is characterized in different ways. Some see Minangkabau as an early variety of Malay, while others think of Minangkabau as a distinct (Malayic) language.

Minangkabau is one of a few languages that generally lacks verb forms and grammatical subject-object distinctions.

Although Minangkabau is still commonly spoken amongst the Minangkabau people, education specific to the culture in urbanizing locations is slowly being erased as it is deemed less and less important in West Sumatra. The Minangkabau language is deemed as &quot;informal&quot; in the urban regions of Padang, with the Indonesian language being preferred instead in formal institutions. Youth in the city will frequently use a mixture of conversational Minang and Indonesian slang.

==Geographic distribution==
Minangkabau is the native language of the Minangkabau people of West Sumatra. There are approximately 5.5 million speakers of the language. It is also spoken in the western part of Riau, South Aceh Regency, the northern part of Bengkulu and Jambi. Along the western coastal region of North Sumatra, the language is also a lingua franca. The language is used and called &quot;Aneuk Jamee&quot; in parts of Aceh.

Besides Indonesia, Minangkabau is also spoken in Malaysia, by some descendants of migrants from the Minang-speaking region in Sumatra (&quot;Ranah Minang&quot;, &quot;Tanah Minang&quot;, or Land of the Minang). Significant numbers of the early migrants settled in what is now the Malaysian state of Negeri Sembilan; this &quot;Negeri Sembilan Malay&quot;, known as &quot;Bahaso Nogori / Baso Nogoghi&quot;, is now a distinct language, more closely related to Malay than to Minangkabau. More recent immigrants are known as &quot;Minang&quot;.

== Dialects ==
The Minangkabau language has several dialects, sometimes differing between nearby villages (e.g. separated by a river). The dialects are Rao Mapat Tunggul, Muaro Sungai Lolo, Payakumbuh, Pangkalan-Lubuk Alai, Agam-Tanah Datar, Pancungsoal, Kotobaru, Sungai Bendung Air, and Karanganyar. In everyday communication between Minangkabau people of different regions, the Agam-Tanah Datar dialect (&quot;Baso Padang&quot; or &quot;Baso Urang Awak&quot; &#x27;our [people&#x27;s] language&#x27;) is often used and has become a kind of standard.

The Tapan language, spoken in the town of Tapan in southern West Sumatra province, is a recently discovered Malayan language which has been proposed as related to but not part of Minangkabau. Together, Tapan and Minangkabau would form a Greater Minangkabau subgroup. The two languages Tapan and Muko-Muko form a &quot;Lunangic&quot; subgroup within the &quot;Minangic&quot; (Greater Minangkabau) language group.

The Minangic subgroup is characterized by the following word-final sound changes.
* *V[hi]ŋ &gt; V[hi]ăŋ
* *us &gt; uĭh
* *at &gt; eʔ
* *as &gt; eh
* *is &gt; ih

<text>Harriet Jane Carrick Moore (1801 – 6 March 1884) was a British watercolour artist who is best known for her drawings of Michael Faraday&#x27;s work at the Royal Institution. She documented his apartment, study, and laboratory in a series of watercolour paintings in the early 1850s. Letters between Faraday and Moore survive at the Institution of Engineering and Technology.
She, and her family, were close with the Swiss-born artist Henry Fuseli.

She was the eldest of the five children of James Carrick Moore (1762–1860) and Harriet Henderson (1779–1866). She was the niece of Sir John Moore, a British army general in the Peninsular War, and the granddaughter of the actor John Henderson.

<doc id="367003" wikidata="Q5116879" url="?curid=367003" title="Church of God (New Dunkers)">
<text>The Church of God (New Dunkers) was a religious group that was formed in 1848 by dissidents of the Schwarzenau Brethren (now known as Church of the Brethren).

The Church appear to be indebted to Peter Eyman ( 1805–1852) for their origin. In the fall of 1827, the &quot;Dunker&quot; Church in Montgomery County, Ohio, was organized by Eyman, who was the Church&#x27;s first preacher. Then Eyman moved from Ohio in 1828 to Carroll County, Indiana, serving in what became the Bachelor&#x27;s Run and Lower Deer Creek churches.

Bachelor&#x27;s Run was the first Brethren Church in Carroll County. The congregation was organized by Eyman in 1829. In 1838 trouble began between Eyman and fellow minister Peter Replogle, which resulted in a division of Church territory. Replogle started the Deer Creek congregation. Around 1845 Peter Eyman and another minister, George Patton, advocated &quot;variant practices&quot; for which they were disfellowshipped by the Annual Conference in 1848.

The Eyman/Patton group were popularly known as the &quot;New Dunkers&quot;, but they called themselves the Church of God, insisting that &quot;Bible things should be called by Bible names&quot;. They took the position that &quot;Church of God&quot; was the only scriptural church name. In doctrine and practice, they were close to the Brethren from whom they evolved, faithfully observing trine forward immersion, feet washing, the holy kiss, anointing with oil, and other Brethren practices. In the 1940s, the Church had eight churches with about 500 members, but in August 1962 the Church disbanded.

<text>Highway 16 is a highway in British Columbia, Canada. It is an important section of the Yellowhead Highway, a part of the Trans-Canada Highway that runs across Western Canada. The highway closely follows the path of the northern B.C. alignment of the Canadian National Railway (CN). The number &quot;16&quot; was first given to the highway in 1941, and originally, the route that the highway took was more to the north of today&#x27;s highway, and it was not as long as it is now. Highway 16 originally ran from New Hazelton east to Aleza Lake. In 1948, Highway 16&#x27;s western end was moved from New Hazelton to the coastal city of Prince Rupert, and in 1953, the highway was re-aligned to end at Prince George. In 1969, further alignment east into Yellowhead Pass was opened to traffic after being constructed up through 1968 and raised to all-weather standards in 1969. Highway 16&#x27;s alignment on Haida Gwaii was commissioned in 1983&lt;ref name=&quot;G1/83&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and is connected to the mainland segment via BC Ferries route #11.

A series of murders and disappearances has given the stretch between Prince Rupert and Prince George the name Highway of Tears.

== Route description ==
=== Haida Gwaii section ===

The segment of the BC highway begins in the west in the village of Masset, on the northern coast of Graham Island. Proceeding south, the highway goes to the inlet town of Port Clements. Winding its way along the boundary of Naikoon Provincial Park, Highway 16 goes south for before reaching the community of Tlell. south of Tlell, Highway 16 reaches Skidegate, where its Haida Gwaii section terminates.

=== Mainland section ===
BC Ferries then takes Highway 16 across the Hecate Strait for due northeast to its landing at Prince Rupert.

From Prince Rupert, Highway 16 begins its winding route east through the Coast Mountain Ranges. Following the Skeena River, the highway travels for to the city of Terrace. Highway 37 merges onto Highway 16 from north of Highway 16, at the Kitwanga junction. Another northeast, Highway 16 reaches New Hazelton, where it then veers southeast along the Bulkley River. later, the highway reaches the town of Smithers, proceeding southeast another to the village of Houston.
At Houston, Highway 16 begins a parallel course along the upper course of the Bulkley River, proceeding east to its junction with Highway 35, south of Burns Lake. east, after passing through the hamlet of Fraser Lake, Highway 16 reaches its junction with Highway 27 in the town of Vanderhoof. east of Vanderhoof, Highway 16 reaches its B.C. midpoint as it enters the city of Prince George at its junction with Highway 97. Highway 16 leaves Prince George after coursing through the city for .

 east of Prince George, Highway 16 reaches the community of Dome Creek, where it converges with the Fraser River and turns southeast. It follows the Fraser River upstream for to McBride, then continues upstream for another to its junction with Highway 5 at Tête Jaune Cache. east of Tête Jaune Cache, Highway 16 enters Mount Robson Provincial Park, coursing through the park for to the boundary between British Columbia and Alberta within Yellowhead Pass.

==Construction and upgrading==
===Prince George–New Hazelton===
In August 1925, this section opened with the completion of the Burns Lake–Endako link.

===New Hazelton–Kitwanga===
Highway extended west of New Hazelton by about in 1927–28 and another in 1928–29. By 1931–32, Kitwanga–Hazelton was rated fairly good. By mid-1943, the condition was rated rough, awaiting tendering of reconstruction contracts.

===Kitwanga–Usk===
By 1931–32, Cedarvale–Kitwanga was rated passable. For Usk–Cedarvale, several segments were under construction. During 1936–1941, a series of stretches were completed, which included replacing sections washed out by the 1936 flood. By 1937, the Usk–Cedarvale gap still remained on the southeast shore.

By 1940, a gap remained. In 1943, progress reactivated. In May 1944, the gap completed comprised the Pacific–Cedarvale section.

===Usk–Terrace===
Highway extended east of Terrace by about in 1927–28 and another in 1928–29. In September 1929, Terrace–Usk section completed.

===Terrace–Prince Rupert===
* 1927: Aerial reconnaissance to identify possible routes was unsuccessful.
* 1928: Galloway Rapids–Phelan, about cleared. Phelan station was about south of present Port Edward.
* 1930: Galloway Rapids bridge built. Over prior few years, a narrow, winding, gravel road had been cut from the Prince Rupert city limits. A road east from the bridge began.
* Early 1930s: Great Depression relief crews extended road eastward.
* 1935: Completed about eastward to Kloiya Bay. Preliminary decision made to progress a highway eastward rather than via Port Edward and south along the shoreline. Within a few years, a narrow, rough road followed the shores of Taylor and Pudhomme lakes.
* 1938: Option of a route via present Kitimat was rejected.
* 1942: US entry into World War II prompted the building of a highway to move troops in response to a potential Japanese invasion. That year, construction contracts were awarded. Significant parts of the CN right-of-way were appropriated for the highway and the track realigned. A total of 45 bridges would be prefabricated.
* 1943: Working 24/7, progress hampered by high employee turnover owing to cold and wet summer weather. That February, five snowslides buried a construction camp near Kwinitsa, killing two and injuring 11.
* 1944: &quot;Skeena Highway&quot; officially opened in September. However, the road in many places was a narrow winding trail hugging the railway tracks. With the Japanese invasion threat long passed, the road was not snowplowed that winter.
* 1945: Route no longer possessed military value. The federal government initially maintained control because the province did not want to assume maintenance costs.
* 1946: Province took over the highway.
* 1951: Highway was paved. The following winter was the first time snowplowing was used to keep the highway open.
* 1970: Highway rerouted and repaved.
* 1972: January and February brought the heaviest snowfalls and longest road closures.
* 1974: January snowslide about west of Terrace buried motel/restaurant/gas station complex, killing seven people.
* Late 1960s: Prince Rupert–Tyee reconstruction.
* 1980s: Kasiks, Tyee, and Esker railway overpasses erected.
* 1989: Falling ice at Car Wash Rock, about east of Exchamsiks River Provincial Park, killed a motorist.
* Early 1990s: Hazardous Tyee–Khyex section realigned.
* 2020s: Despite promises to rectify, the Car Wash Rock site remains hazardous. About farther east, the Mile 28 project to replace the railway crossing with an overpass has stalled.

==Highway of Tears==

The Highway of Tears is a stretch of Highway 16 between Prince George and Prince Rupert. Since 1970, numerous women have gone missing or have been murdered along the section of highway. Aboriginal organizations speculate that number ranges above forty.

In 2016, the Canadian government launched the National Inquiry into Missing and Murdered Indigenous Women after communicating with victim families. This was done to find methods of slowing the violence within the Indigenous population.

In September 2020 a totem pole honouring missing and murdered Indigenous women was raised on the highway just outside Terrace.

== Major intersections ==
From west to east, the following intersections are observed along Highway 16. Distances exclude the ferry between Skidegate and Prince Rupert.

<doc id="367025" wikidata="Q1468456" url="?curid=367025" title="Fritz Spiegl">
<text>Fritz Spiegl (27 January 1926 – 23 March 2003) was an Austrian-born English musician, journalist, broadcaster, humorist and collector who lived in Britain from 1939. His works include compiling the Radio 4 UK Theme in 1978.

==Early life==
Spiegl was born near the Hungarian border in the village of Zurndorf, Burgenland, Austria, where his father was a businessman manufacturing among other things carbonated water. Spiegl attended the &quot;Gymnasium&quot; in Eisenstadt but, as the family were Jewish, they were persecuted by the Nazis in the wake of the &quot;Anschluss&quot; of 1938. All their property having been confiscated, Fritz&#x27;s parents succeeded in leaving the country in 1939, eventually escaping to Bolivia while sending Fritz and his older sister Hanny (born 1923) to Northamptonshire, England.

On arrival in Britain, Spiegl was sent to Magdalen College School, Brackley, where he learned little beyond &quot;rugger, plane-spotting and a bit of Latin&quot;. Eventually he went to London to work for an advertising agency. But he soon switched to music, taught himself to play the flute, enrolled at the Royal Academy of Music and, within a short time, became principal flautist with the Royal Liverpool Philharmonic Orchestra, a position he kept for more than a decade. Ear damage appears to have played a part in his exit from professional playing, as in later years he would occasionally refer to having been &quot;invalided out by the brass section&quot;.

==Career==
A resident of Liverpool, he organised annual &quot;Nuts in May&quot; concerts, featuring the Loophonium, a &quot;Liszt Twist&quot; and other parody items. This approach helped draw new young audiences into concert halls. Less attracted to pop music, Spiegl once called the Beatles phenomenon &quot;the greatest confidence trick since the Virgin Birth&quot;. His name was often misspelt, including &quot;Spiegel&quot;, &quot;Spiegle&quot;, &quot;Speigl&quot;, &quot;Speigel&quot; or &quot;Speigle&quot;. He was a supporter of Liverpool Football Club.

A native speaker of German, Fritz Spiegl did not speak a word of English when he moved to Britain as a 13-year-old—a fact which has often been regarded as the trigger for his preoccupation with language phenomena such as, say, malapropisms and for the biting yet humorous linguistic purism of his later years. As one commentator remarked, Spiegl

&quot;...soon knew a great deal more about the language than most English people do. And cared more too. One can understand this. It&#x27;s galling, when you&#x27;ve taken the trouble to learn that &quot;an alibi&quot; is not the same as &quot;an excuse&quot;, to find that the natives themselves seem to have forgotten the difference.&quot;

Fritz Spiegl died suddenly aged 77 during a Sunday lunch in Liverpool with his wife, Ingrid Frances Spiegl, and some friends.

==Works==
===Compositions===
As a composer, Spiegl scored a popular success with the original theme from the TV series &quot;Z-Cars&quot;, based on &quot;Johnny Todd&quot;, a Liverpool sea shanty. He also composed the original theme for the &quot;Z Cars&quot; spin-off series &quot;Softly, Softly&quot;; the song was also released as a single on Andrew Loog Oldham&#x27;s Immediate record label in 1966. Another signature tune was &#x27;Conversation Piece&#x27; for &quot;In the Psychiatrist&#x27;s Chair&quot;, which was based on music from Mozart&#x27;s &quot;Les Petits Riens&quot; transcribed for wind instruments.

His &quot;BBC Radio 4 UK Theme&quot;, in which national songs from each of the four constituent countries of the United Kingdom are combined, was heard on Radio 4 at the beginning of each morning&#x27;s broadcasting from November 1978 until April 2006.
His &quot;Eine kleine Beatlemusic&quot; was performed in London and later recorded, as was &quot;Valkyrie And The Rhine Maidens - On The Bayreuth Beat&quot;.

<doc id="367030" wikidata="Q18750" url="?curid=367030" title="Wigan Athletic F.C.">
<text>Wigan Athletic Football Club () is a professional association football club based in Wigan, Greater Manchester, England. The team competes in the EFL League One, the third level of the English football league system.

Founded in 1932, they have played at the 25,138-seat The Brick Community Stadium since 1999, before which they played at Springfield Park. Their colours are blue and white stripes, although all-blue shirts have been common throughout the club&#x27;s history. The club regards Bolton Wanderers as its primary derby rival.

Wigan competed in the Cheshire County League for the first nine seasons of the club&#x27;s existence, winning three league titles before being placed in the Lancashire Combination in 1947. It spent 14 years in the Lancashire Combination and secured four league titles during this time. It spent 1961 to 1968 back in the Cheshire County League, picking up another league title in 1964–65. Invited to become a founder member of the Northern Premier League in 1968, the club won two league titles and also reached the FA Trophy final in 1973. Wigan was elected to the Football League in 1978 and was promoted out of the Fourth Division in 1981–82. The club won the Associate Members&#x27; Cup in 1985, but was relegated back into the fourth tier in 1993. It won the Third Division title in 1996–97, the Football League Trophy in 1999 and the Second Division in 2002–03, before securing promotion out of the Championship in 2004–05.

Wigan lost in the League Cup final in 2006 and won the FA Cup in 2013, beating Manchester City in the final. However, the club was relegated later that year, bringing its eight-season stay in the Premier League to an end. The FA Cup success did, though, gain it a place in the UEFA Europa League group stages the following season. Relegated from the Championship in 2015, the club won the League One title in 2015–16 and repeated this feat in 2017–18 after another relegation. On 1 July 2020, less than a month after a change of ownership, it was placed into administration and was relegated from the Championship due to the subsequent points deduction. After narrowly avoiding relegation to League Two in 2020–21 under new ownership, Wigan won the League One title for a fourth time in 2021–22, but a year later were again relegated from the Championship following two further points deductions. Additional deductions of points were made in May 2023, meaning the club started the 2023–24 League One season with minus eight points.

==History==
===Non-League football: 1932–1978===
Wigan Athletic was formed in 1932, following the winding-up of Wigan Borough the year before. The establishment of Wigan Athletic was the sixth attempt to create a stable football club in the town following the demise of Wigan A.F.C., Wigan County, Wigan United, Wigan Town and Wigan Borough. The town&#x27;s die-hard football enthusiasts planned the rebirth of a town team, and a public meeting was held at the Queen&#x27;s Hall presided over by the then Mayor of Wigan, Councillor W.A. Hipwood, and Callum Roper, who called on the town to keep up its reputation for producing fine sportsmen by keeping intact an Association Football team as well as the Rugby League team. A committee was elected and a new club was formed, Wigan Athletic. Springfield Park, the former home of Wigan Borough, was purchased by the club for £2,850 from the owners of the Woodhouse Lane dog track. Despite their initial application being turned down, Wigan Athletic were elected into the Cheshire County League following the resignation of Manchester Central. The club had also made the first of many attempts to be admitted into the Football League, but failed to receive a single vote. On 27 August 1932, Wigan Athletic played their first-ever league game against Port Vale Reserves. The team played in red and white shirts with black shorts.

Wigan Athletic won its first honours in the 1933–34 season, finishing top of the Cheshire League, despite being based in neighbouring Lancashire. In the following season the club won a second league championship and also entered the FA Cup for the first time, defeating Carlisle United 6–1 in the first round – a cup record for the biggest victory by a non-League club over a League club. In the 1935–36 season, the club won its third consecutive Cheshire League title and the Lancashire Junior Cup.

After the Second World War, Wigan Athletic adopted their present-day blue and white colours. The club struggled to assemble a competitive side and finished bottom of the league in 1946–47 season. Despite their pre-war success, the club failed to gain re-election and was replaced by Winsford United. The club joined the Lancashire Combination, winning the league in their first season. In 1950, Wigan Athletic came close to election to The Football League, narrowly losing out to Scunthorpe United and Shrewsbury Town. The club would frequently apply for election to the Football League over the next 28 years before finally being accepted.

In the 1953–54 season, Wigan played an FA Cup match against Hereford United in front of a crowd of 27,526 – a club record and also a record attendance for a match between two non-League teams at a non-League ground. In the next round of the cup, Wigan Athletic was drawn against First Division side Newcastle United. Wigan Athletic held their top-flight opponents to a 2–2 draw at St James&#x27; Park, but went on to lose the replay 3–2. In 1961, the club moved back to the Cheshire League.

In the 1964–65 season, Wigan Athletic won its first Cheshire League title since returning to the league, with top goalscorer Harry Lyon scoring 66 times. He remains the club&#x27;s greatest goalscorer of all time. Wigan Athletic won four cup titles in the 1966–67 season (Lancashire Floodlit Cup winner, Liverpool Non League Senior Cup winner, Northern Floodlit League winner, Northern Floodlit League Cup winner) and was also Cheshire County League runner-up.

In 1968, Wigan Athletic was a founder member of the Northern Premier League. In winning the league title in 1970–71, the leading goalscorer, with 42 goals including seven hat-tricks, was Geoff Davies, who scored 28 goals in the following 1971–72 season. The team played at Wembley Stadium for the first time in the 1973 FA Trophy final, where they lost 2–1 to Scarborough. After 34 failed election attempts, including one controversial but headline-making application in 1972 to join the Scottish League Second Division, Wigan Athletic was elected to the Football League in 1978.

===Early League years: 1978–1995===

Wigan Athletic finished in second place in the Northern Premier League in the 1977–78 season, behind winners Boston United. But as Boston&#x27;s ground and facilities did not meet the Football League criteria for a League club, whereas Springfield Park did, Wigan Athletic were put forward for election to the league. There was no automatic promotion to the Football League until 1987, and at that time a club had to be &#x27;voted out&#x27; of the League to allow a non-League team to be promoted in their place. At the end of the 1977–78 season, Southport finished next to the bottom of the old Fourth Division, and faced near neighbours Wigan Athletic for their place in the league. The first round of voting was tied, with both clubs receiving 26 votes. After a tense re-vote which Wigan won 29–20, Southport lost their place in the Fourth Division and Wigan Athletic became an English League club on 2 June 1978.

In the club&#x27;s first season of league football, Wigan Athletic finished in sixth place, just six points off promotion and playing in front of an average crowd of 6,701. Two more top-half finishes came in the following seasons, though a relatively weak 1980–81 season saw the dismissal of long-serving manager Ian McNeill shortly before the end of the season. They gained their first Football League promotion under the management of former Liverpool player Larry Lloyd in 1981–82, when a points tally of 91 saw them join the former Division Three for the first time, beginning a 10-year spell in English football&#x27;s third tier. The club struggled in their first season in Division Three, which led to Lloyd&#x27;s sacking in early 1983, at which point Bobby Charlton, a director at the time, took over as temporary manager before being replaced by Harry McNally. Under McNally&#x27;s management, the club stabilised in Division Three and secured a pair of mid-table finishes, but a dreadful 1984–85 season cost him his job, with Tranmere manager Bryan Hamilton stepping into the breach. Under Hamilton&#x27;s management, the club&#x27;s performances went to the next level and they won their first silverware as a league club that season with the Freight Rover Trophy. They were beaten in the Northern final of the same competition the following season by Bolton Wanderers. More importantly, Hamilton achieved Division Three survival, which had looked an impossible task earlier that season.

The 1985–86 season saw a marked improvement in the club&#x27;s league form, eventually finishing in fourth position, a then-club record high which would stand for 17 years until 2002–03. Wigan Athletic finished the season just one point outside the promotion places in the final season before the Football League introduced the play-off system for promotion and relegation. However, Hamilton&#x27;s feats attracted the attention of First Division Leicester City and he left to become their manager in the summer of 1986. His assistant, Ray Mathias, who had followed him from Tranmere, stepped up to the Wigan Athletic manager&#x27;s job. Wigan Athletic managed an identical fourth-place finish in the 1986–87 season, but this time were rewarded with the chance to compete for the final promotion place in the new play-off system. (In the first two years of the play-off system, teams finishing third, fourth and fifth joined the team finishing 20th in the division above to play-off for the promotion place; this was changed to the teams finishing third, fourth, fifth and sixth from the 1988–89 season). The Latics lost at the two-legged semi-final stage to Swindon, who went on to win the final promotion place.

The fourth-place finishes of the 1985–86 and 1986–87 seasons proved to be the high points of Wigan Athletic&#x27;s first stint in Division 3. For the next five years, they finished mid-table, flirting with relegation in 1988–89 (at which time Mathias was sacked and the previous manager Bryan Hamilton returned) and 1989–90, until they were relegated for the first time in the club&#x27;s league history in 1992–93. Wigan Athletic finished in 23rd place, amid tumbling attendances which had fallen from averages of 3,000–4,000 in Wigan Athletic&#x27;s Division 3 years to just 2,593 in 1992–93. Hamilton resigned shortly before the club were relegated, and was replaced by Kenny Swain. A year later, with the club back in the fourth tier of the English League, the Latics finished fourth from bottom, in 19th place. While there was no relegation that season due to the lack of a promotable club in the Football Conference, this remains the club&#x27;s lowest-ever finish. The following season would prove to be arguably even worse, as Swain was sacked early in the campaign following a horrific start, and former player Graham Barrow took over as manager. Despite the club being rooted to the bottom of the table until the start of December, the second half of the campaign saw a major upturn in form, and they finished well clear of the relegation zone in 15th place. Attendances fell to a lowest-ever Wigan Athletic League average of 1,845 by 1995.

===Rising through the league: 1995–2005===
In February 1995, local millionaire and owner of JJB Sports, Dave Whelan purchased the club. Through Whelan&#x27;s business connections in Spain he attracted three Spaniards to the club – Roberto Martínez, Isidro Díaz, and Jesus Seba – who became known as the Three Amigos. The trio became the on-pitch symbols of Whelan&#x27;s ambitious plan to take Wigan Athletic into the Premier League. The Three Amigos were joined at the club by John Deehan, who replaced Barrow as manager during the 1995–96 season following a 6–2 home defeat to Mansfield Town. Deehan took the Latics within two points of a play-off place in his first season; the club had in fact been in the final automatic promotion spot with four games remaining, but lost them all and so failed to even make the playoffs. The following year Wigan Athletic became Division Three champions on the last day of the season, Graeme Jones scoring a club record 31 league goals in the process. In most seasons they would have been runners-up, but a temporary rule change which saw goals scored take precedence over goal difference allowed them to finish above runners-up Fulham, who had the same number of points and a better goal difference.

Following a mid-table finish in Division Two the following season, Deehan quit to become Steve Bruce&#x27;s assistant at Sheffield United. He was succeeded by Ray Mathias, who returned for his third stint as Wigan Athletic manager. Mathias&#x27; team won the Football League Trophy in 1999, beating Millwall 1–0 at Wembley Stadium. The same season the Latics reached the Division Two play-offs, losing 2–1 on aggregate to Manchester City. Mathias was sacked, and replaced by John Benson. He led the team to the top of Division Two in his first six months, but they were only able to qualify for the play-offs. In the last Division Two play-off final played at the old Wembley Stadium, Wigan lost 3–2 after extra time to Gillingham.

Benson moved &#x27;upstairs&#x27; to the new post of director of football in the summer of 2000, when former Arsenal manager Bruce Rioch took the manager&#x27;s job for the 2000–01 season. Rioch was hampered by severe injury problems and after a difficult and often unimpressive first half of the season left the club in February 2001. He was temporarily replaced by club stalwart Colin Greenall, before the surprise appointment of Steve Bruce for the final eight games of the season. His arrival brought renewed vigour to Wigan Athletic performances, but the club ultimately lost in the play-offs again, this time against Reading, and Bruce left for Crystal Palace.

In the summer of 2001, the former Latics forward Paul Jewell took over as manager following an unsuccessful spell at Sheffield Wednesday. His first season in charge saw mixed results and an embarrassing defeat to non-League Canvey Island in the FA Cup first round, although the club eventually finished in mid-table. Jewell&#x27;s second season in charge was far more successful. Wigan Athletic went on a run to the quarter-finals of the League Cup, beating Premier League opponents West Brom, Manchester City and Fulham en route. Wigan Athletic won the Division Two championship in 2002–03 with a points total of 100, powered by the goals of then-record £1.2 million signing Nathan Ellington, with a run of 10 consecutive wins along the way. The club lost only four times all season, and Wigan Athletic secured promotion to the second tier of the English Football League for the first time in their history.

After losing their first Division One game, Wigan Athletic confounded expectations to go unbeaten for the next 17 games and topped the division by November 2003. A weak finish saw Wigan Athletic win only three of their last 10 games to finish seventh in Division One – a last-minute goal by West Ham&#x27;s Brian Deane in the final game of the season saw the Latics drop out of the play-off places in favour of eventual play-off winners Crystal Palace.

Hoping to build on the previous season&#x27;s disappointing finish, the Latics went one better than 2003–04 by remaining unbeaten for the first 17 games of the 2004–05 season. Along with Sunderland and Ipswich, the Latics remained in the promotion hunt all season. By the last day of the season, Sunderland had already won the title and Wigan needed at least a draw against Reading – who themselves needed to win to finish in sixth place – to beat Ipswich to the last automatic promotion spot. A 3–1 victory at the JJB Stadium earned Wigan Athletic promotion to the top division of English football for the first time in their 73-year history.

===Premier League years and FA Cup victory: 2005–2013===
The club&#x27;s first Premier League game was a sell-out at the JJB Stadium against holders Chelsea, a 1–0 defeat after an injury-time winner by Hernán Crespo. A successful run followed, and by November, Wigan were second in the league. Good league form was coupled with an equally strong performance in the Football League Cup, with Wigan reaching their first ever major cup final after defeating Arsenal on away goals in the semi-final. In the final, Wigan were defeated 4–0 by neighbours Manchester United. Wigan Athletic eventually finished the season in 10th place, which remains the club&#x27;s highest ever league placing. Defender Pascal Chimbonda was also included in the 2005–06 PFA Team of the Season, capping off his season by being picked for the France squad for the 2006 FIFA World Cup.

During the close season, Wigan sold many players who had starred in their first season in the Premier League, such as Jimmy Bullard, Jason Roberts and Stéphane Henchoz, while bringing in replacements including Emile Heskey, Denny Landzaat, Chris Kirkland and Antonio Valencia. After a mid-table start to the 2006–07 season, Wigan had eight consecutive losses from mid-December, but was 15th in early March. On the final day of the season, Wigan got a 2–1 away win against Sheffield United, which kept them up at the expense of their opponents. The following day, Paul Jewell unexpectedly resigned as manager; his assistant Chris Hutchings was appointed as his replacement.

Wigan&#x27;s third Premier League campaign saw changes in the squad, with Titus Bramble, Mario Melchiot, Jason Koumas and Marcus Bent among the players brought in, and Melchiot was installed as the new club captain. The 2007–08 season began well for Wigan, with Emile Heskey recalled to the England squad, as the first Wigan player to represent England whilst a full member of the club. However, he broke his foot immediately after his England call-up and was out injured for six weeks. The club&#x27;s league position subsequently worsened, and on the back of a run of six consecutive defeats, Wigan fell into the relegation zone. Whelan took the decision to sack Hutchings on 5 November 2007, after 12 games in charge, reinstating Steve Bruce, who saved the club from relegation.

In the summer of 2008, Bruce signed Lee Cattermole from Middlesbrough for £3.5 million, and Egyptian striker Amr Zaki sign on an initial one-year loan. Zaki had scored 10 Premier League goals by February 2009, as Wigan reached seventh place in the table with 34 points from 25 games. January saw the departure of two key first team members, Wilson Palacios and Emile Heskey, to Tottenham and Aston Villa respectively. Despite these changes, Wigan finished the season in 11th place with 45 points, their second-best finish ever in the Premier League. On 3 June, Bruce left Wigan for the second time to take over the vacant manager position at Sunderland. July saw the departure of another key first team member Antonio Valencia to Manchester United. Before the 2009–10 season got underway, Cattermole left for Sunderland.
Wigan appointed Roberto Martínez, then manager of Swansea City, as manager prior to the 2009–10 Premier League season. He previously played for Wigan from 1995 to 2001. On 26 September, they claimed their first three points against a &quot;Big 4&quot; team after beating Chelsea 3–1, with goals from Titus Bramble, Hugo Rodallega and Paul Scharner. A late surge that included a 1–0 win over Liverpool and a 3–2 win over Arsenal – the latter of which saw Wigan recover from two goals down with ten minutes remaining to win in injury time – saw the team once more survive relegation. Most notably, having never defeated any of the traditional &quot;Big Four&quot; in the league until their win over Chelsea (and with only one win over any of them in cup competitions), Wigan ended the season having defeated three of them at home. Despite this high, the season also saw two humiliating 8 goal defeats, firstly a 9–1 thrashing at Tottenham in November, and finally an 8–0 defeat to Chelsea on the final day of the season, a match which saw their opponents crowned Premier League champions.

In the 2010–11 season, Wigan fell to the bottom of the league by the end of February, following a 4–0 defeat to Manchester United. However, despite remaining in the bottom three for the majority of the season, they managed to retain their Premier League status on the last day of the season, defeating Stoke City at the Britannia Stadium after a goal from Hugo Rodallega. On 7 May 2012, they simultaneously secured their Premier League status and relegated Blackburn Rovers with a 1–0 victory at Ewood Park.

In 2013, after beating Everton in the quarter-final and Millwall in the semi-final, Wigan reached the FA Cup final for the first time in their history. In the final, played at Wembley Stadium, Wigan beat Manchester City 1–0, with a goal by Ben Watson scored in injury time.
Wigan&#x27;s first ever major trophy also gave the club a place in the group stage of the Europa League. Following their 4–1 defeat to Arsenal three days later, Wigan Athletic ended their eight-year spell in the Premier League and became the first team to be relegated and win the FA Cup in the same season. On 5 June it was announced that Martínez had left Wigan and had signed for Everton on a four-year deal.

===End of the Whelan era: 2013–2018===
Owen Coyle became the new manager of Wigan Athletic when Martínez left for Everton. The team lost to Manchester United in the Community Shield. Coyle left by mutual agreement on 2 December 2013 after a poor start to the season, and was replaced by Uwe Rösler. On 12 December in his first match, Wigan were eliminated from the Europa League group stage after defeat to Maribor. On 9 March 2014 Wigan beat Manchester City to reach the semi-final of the FA Cup at Wembley for the second successive year, where they played Arsenal, and lost 4–2 on penalties after normal time and extra time resulted in a 1–1 draw. After finishing 5th in the Championship, Wigan lost their play-off semi-final to Queens Park Rangers.

Rösler was sacked in November 2014 with the club in the relegation places, and was replaced by Malky Mackay. Whelan resigned as chairman on 3 March 2015, remaining as owner but handing over the chairmanship to his grandson David Sharpe. The following month, with Wigan in danger of relegation to League One, Mackay was sacked and replaced by former Wigan captain Gary Caldwell, yet the team ended the season with relegation. The squad changed drastically, including the signings of Will Grigg from Brentford and Reece James from Manchester United. The side lost only once in 23 matches in the second half of the season and won the division, with Grigg the league&#x27;s top scorer with 25 goals.

In October 2016, following a poor start to the season, Caldwell was sacked as manager and replaced by Manchester United coach Warren Joyce. Results did not improve under Joyce, who was sacked in March 2017. Wigan were subsequently relegated back to League One in April and interim manager Graham Barrow left, ending a 15-year association with the club. Paul Cook, who had just won League Two with Portsmouth, was appointed Wigan manager in June 2017.

In the 2017–18 League One season, Wigan finished top winning promotion back to the Championship. Their promotion was sealed by a 4–0 win against Fleetwood Town. In the 2017–18 FA Cup, Wigan beat Manchester City in the fifth round at home, winning 1–0 after Will Grigg scored in the 79th minute. In the quarter-finals, they were knocked out by Southampton in a 2–0 loss. At the end of the season it was announced that the Whelan family had agreed a deal to sell the club, stadium and training facilities to the Hong Kong–based International Entertainment Corporation (IEC) in a £22m deal. On 2 November 2018, IEC received shareholder approval to complete the acquisition of the football club, ending 23 years of Whelan family ownership.

In the 2018–19 season, Wigan finished 18th in the Championship with 52 points, well clear of the relegation zone.

===Administration, financial instability, and new ownership: Since 2020===
On 4 June 2020, IEC sold the majority of Wigan Athletic shareholdings to Hong Kong–based Next Leader Fund; the sale was formally ratified and approved by the shareholders of IEC, the Hong Kong Stock Exchange and the EFL. On 1 July 2020, the club – standing 14th in the Championship, eight points clear of relegation, in a season delayed due to the COVID-19 pandemic – announced it had gone into administration as Next Leader Fund had refused to invest promised money. The insolvency left Wigan facing a 12-point deduction; the sanction would be applied at the end of the 2019–20 season if the club finished outside the bottom three after 46 games. Wigan MP Lisa Nandy and Greater Manchester mayor Andy Burnham wrote a joint letter to Parry calling for an investigation into the club&#x27;s takeover. Players had not been paid and there was talk of club staff being made redundant and of players being offered for sale, they said. Wigan&#x27;s supporters club also called for an investigation and for financial support from the EFL; supporters, backed by Nandy, later launched an online petition to try to trigger a parliamentary debate around the EFL&#x27;s owners&#x27; and directors&#x27; test.

On 7 July, 75 (approximately half) of the club&#x27;s non-playing staff were made redundant by the administrators.

Meanwhile, on 7 July 2020 the club had appealed against the 12-point deduction imposed by the EFL for entering administration. On 14 July, Wigan recorded their biggest League victory, beating Hull City 8–0. This, combined with other results, meant Wigan would not finish in the relegation places, so the 12-point deduction would be applied at the end of the current season with the relegation confirmed on 4 August.

On 17 August 2020, it was reported that Au Yeung Wai Kay, the club&#x27;s owner, had, on 23 June, asked Begbies Traynor about putting it into administration before completing his takeover. Wigan supporters began a fund-raising effort, initially raising £500,000 to help secure the club&#x27;s future, and then raising £200,000 more.

Administrators had been confident a sale would be agreed by their deadline, but later revised their opinion.

By early March 2021, the administrators were in advanced talks with a consortium, Phoenix 2021 Ltd, led by Bahrain businessmen Abdulrahman Al-Jasmi and Talal Mubarak al-Hammad, which was confirmed officially on 30 March. In May, the former administrators repaid £171,000 raised by supporters to keep the club going when it first went into administration.

The club finished the 2020–21 season in 20th position, one point above the relegation places. Wigan Athletic won the League One title under Leam Richardson in the following season, earning promotion back to the Championship after a final day 3–0 victory at Shrewsbury Town.

On 7 March 2023, Wigan reported a £7.7m loss for the financial year to June 2022. Four days later, Wigan released a statement saying there would be a temporary delay in meeting wage obligations due to liquidity issues; the EFL was aware of the situation and on 20 March 2023, bottom-of-the-table Wigan were docked three points for failing to pay players, having had a previous EFL sanction for non-payment suspended. At the end of the 2022–23 season, they were relegated from the Championship.

In late May 2023, Wigan were hit with two further points deductions and would therefore start its next season with minus eight points. On 12 June, HMRC lodged a winding-up petition over unpaid tax. On 14 June 2023, Wigan-born billionaire and Wigan Warriors RLFC co-owner Mike Danson bought the club and immediately paid all creditors, including staff.

==Stadium==
Wigan Athletic&#x27;s stadium is the 25,138 capacity The Brick Community Stadium, part of the Robin Park complex in Wigan. It has been the club&#x27;s home since the 1999–2000 season. Wigan Athletic owns the stadium, but leases the ground to rugby league team Wigan Warriors. The stadium cost £30 million to construct. Previously, home games were played at Springfield Park, the former home of Wigan Borough, which was demolished in June 1999; it is now the site of a housing development. The record attendance at The Brick Community Stadium (then known as the JJB Stadium) for Wigan Athletic is 25,133 for a game against Manchester United on 11 May 2008 – the final match of the 2007–08 season.

The stadium, initially known as the JJB Stadium for sponsorship reasons, was the fourth attempt at re-development/re-location for Wigan Athletic, the first coming in 1986 when then-chairman Bill Kenyon revealed plans for a 15,000 all-seater development at Springfield Park including a hotel and shopping facilities. The club was to play at the nearby Woodhouse Stadium (formerly Wigan Municipal Stadium – now demolished) while the building work took place. In 1990, Kenyon submitted his second scheme which would cost £3m, hold 12–15,000 fans and involved moving the pitch nearer to the car park. Neither efforts got past the planning stage. The next chairman, Stephen Gage, spent most of 1993 and 1994 trying to relocate the Latics to the then Robin Park Stadium (now demolished) until his plans were scuppered by Wigan Council when the local council announced plans for their own ground involving Wigan Warriors. Gage finally admitted defeat when he sold the Latics to Dave Whelan on 27 February 1995 for around £1m.

Plans for the JJB Stadium were first published in 1997. Contracts for the new stadium were signed in late 1997 and work began immediately. Originally the ground was to be built for both Wigan Athletic and Orrell R.U.F.C., as grants were only available for multi-use stadia at that time. Wigan Warriors did not figure in the equation until Whelan bought the rugby league club some 12 months later after protracted negotiations with the directors of the rugby league club. The modern all-seater stadium was officially opened on 4 August 1999. Its inauguration was marked with a friendly between Wigan and neighbours Manchester United, who were then reigning European Champions, with Alex Ferguson officially opening the stadium. However, Wigan Athletic hosted Morecambe three days earlier on 1 August as a dress rehearsal for the official opening against Manchester United. The game was played during a violent electrical storm and torrential rain, even so, 4,020 supporters attended and the game ended in a goalless draw. The first competitive football match took place on 7 August 1999, with Wigan Athletic facing Scunthorpe United in a Division 2 match. Simon Haworth scored twice, including the first competitive goal at the new stadium, as Athletic won 3–0.

On 7 March 2005 Greater Manchester Police announced that it would stop policing Wigan Athletic matches at the stadium from 2 April. This move left Wigan Athletic facing the prospect of playing their home games in the Premier League in an empty stadium, so they paid the money they owed to the police. The club appealed against the payments in court and won, with the claims expected to earn the club around £37,000.

On 25 March 2009 it was announced that Wigan Athletic would change the name of their stadium to The DW Stadium, after chairman Dave Whelan&#x27;s commercial venture, DW Sports Fitness. For 2013–14 Europa League fixtures held at the stadium, the ground was known as The Wigan Athletic Stadium. From 13 May 2024, the stadium was renamed The Brick Community Stadium, in partnership with a local Wigan charity, The Brick, which works to address poverty and homelessness. The name will remain in place until the end of 2025 while Wigan Athletic and Wigan Warriors secure a long-term commercial stadium partner for 2026 and beyond.

==Supporters==

Wigan Athletic Official Supporters Club (formerly known as Wigan Athletic Supporters Travel Club) is the official supporters&#x27; association of Wigan Athletic Football Club. The supporters club are a non-profit organisation run by volunteers and meet before home matches in the South Stand Bar.

The Latics&#x27; most vocal supporters can be found in the East Stand of The Brick Community Stadium which houses up to 8,206 fans The South Stand of the ground is the family stand.

A long-standing song sung by fans of the club is &quot;You Are My Sunshine&quot;. In more recent times, &quot;I&#x27;m a Believer&quot;, the Hokey cokey, &quot;We Built This City&quot; and &quot;Gold&quot; are among some of the songs that have been adapted by Wigan supporters.

The club has one unofficial fanzine, The Mudhutter, which is released between 5 and 6 times during the season.

Resulting from a number of incidents at Latics matches where smoke bombs were used by fans (resulting in 17 banning orders as a result of one fixture), several club statements were issued and police presence was increased at some matches. Data from the UK Football Policing Unit found that Wigan Athletic along with Everton and Manchester United had the highest number of incidents involving pyrotechnics.

Wigan&#x27;s return to the Championship saw an average away following of over 1,200. This figure did not include Europa League, Community Shield, League Cup and FA Cup fixtures, where on average supporters turned up in greater numbers.

In 2013, the club sold out their 25,000 allocation for the FA Cup final and sold 20,000 tickets for the FA Cup semi-final. A total of 5,500 was also sold for the FA Community Shield in the same year.

In 2014, hundreds of fans took part in a charity walk from Wigan to Bolton in aid of local charity Joseph&#x27;s Goal. Joseph was Wigan&#x27;s mascot in the 2013 FA Cup final, led out by captain Emmerson Boyce.

On Boxing Day, over the years many fans have chosen to attend Wigan Athletic&#x27;s match in fancy dress. This is particularly prominent with away fixtures on that day where the fans are known as the &#x27;Banana Army&#x27;. However, on Boxing Day in 2014 a boycott of the club&#x27;s fixture against Leeds United was ordered by some supporters due to the ticket prices for the match at Elland Road. Around 750 away fans attended the match.

During the 2014–15 season, a Fan Advisory Board (FAB) was set up by the club to allow supporters of Wigan Athletic to have a greater say on any issues they may have. The board meets every month to six weeks with the first meeting having taken place in November 2014.

=== Mascot ===
In August 2019, the club announced that a giant pie, called Crusty, would serve as the team&#x27;s new mascot for the 2019–20 season. Crusty The Pie was chosen following a competition in which more than 90 primary schools were invited to submit ideas, with over half of the entries opting for a pie.

==Rivalries==
Since Wigan Athletic&#x27;s admission to the Football League in 1978, the club has built up several rivalries, mainly with Bolton Wanderers, the club&#x27;s primary derby match.

One rivalry that has arisen in recent years has been that with Manchester City, since the first time they met in the Second Division in 1998, the season in which City gained passage to the 1999 Division Two play-off final through the &quot;Hand of Goat&quot;. Wigan met City in the 2013 FA Cup final and beat them 1–0. Since then, City have failed to beat Wigan in the competition; losing 2–1 at the Etihad in the 2013–14 FA Cup quarter-final and, in February 2018, losing 1–0 with third tier Wigan beating eventual Premier League champions City with a Will Grigg goal.

Wigan also have other local rivalries with Preston North End, Blackburn Rovers, Stockport Town, Oldham Athletic, Blackpool and Rochdale.

Despite St Helens Town being perhaps more local and comparable, one of the club&#x27;s longest and recently forgotten rivalries was with nearby Lancashire based club Chorley, although the two clubs have not played a league game since 1971 when they were in the Northern Premier League. The last time Wigan played Chorley was in the first round of the FA Cup in 2020, with non-League Chorley beating an administration-stricken Wigan 3–2 after extra-time.

==European record==
Wigan&#x27;s victory in the 2013 FA Cup final qualified them for European football for the first and only time, earning them an automatic place in the group stage of the 2013–14 UEFA Europa League.

<doc id="367037" wikidata="Q503815" url="?curid=367037" title="Bill McKibben">
<text>William Ernest McKibben (born December 8, 1960) is an American environmentalist, author, and journalist who has written extensively on the impact of global warming. He is the Schumann Distinguished Scholar at Middlebury College and leader of the climate campaign group 350.org. He has authored a dozen books about the environment, including his first, &quot;The End of Nature&quot; (1989), about climate change, and &quot;&quot; (2019), about the state of the environmental challenges facing humanity and future prospects.

In 2009, he led 350.org&#x27;s organization of 5,200 simultaneous demonstrations in 181 countries. In 2010, McKibben and 350.org conceived the 10/10/10 Global Work Party, which convened more than 7,000 events in 188 countries, as he had told a large gathering at Warren Wilson College shortly before the event. In December 2010, 350.org coordinated a planet-scale art project, with many of the 20 works visible from satellites. In 2011 and 2012 he led the environmental campaign against the proposed Keystone XL pipeline project and spent three days in jail in Washington, D.C. Two weeks later he was inducted into the literature section of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences.

He was awarded the Gandhi Peace Award in 2013. &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine named him to its inaugural list of the 100 most important global thinkers in 2009 and MSN named him one of the dozen most influential men of 2009. In 2010, &quot;The Boston Globe&quot; called him &quot;probably the nation&#x27;s leading environmentalist&quot; and &quot;Time&quot; magazine book reviewer Bryan Walsh described him as &quot;the world&#x27;s best green journalist&quot;. In 2014, he was awarded the Right Livelihood Award for &quot;mobilizing growing popular support in the USA and around the world for strong action to counter the threat of global climate change.&quot; He has been mentioned as a possible future Secretary of the Interior or Secretary of Energy should a progressive be elected President.

==Early life==
Bill McKibben was born in Palo Alto, California. His family later moved to the Boston suburb of Lexington, Massachusetts, where he attended high school. His father, who once, in 1971, had been arrested during a protest in support of Vietnam veterans against the war, wrote for &quot;Business Week&quot;, before becoming business editor at &quot;The Boston Globe&quot;, in 1980. As a high school student, McKibben wrote for the local paper and participated in statewide debate competitions. Entering Harvard College in 1978, he became an editor of &quot;The Harvard Crimson&quot; and was chosen president of the paper for the calendar year 1981.

In 1980, following the election of Ronald Reagan, he determined to dedicate his life to the environmental cause.

Graduating in 1982, he worked for five years for &quot;The New Yorker&quot; as a staff writer, writing much of the &quot;Talk of the Town&quot; column from 1982 to early 1987. Inspired by the Gospel of Matthew, he became an advocate of nonviolent resistance. While doing a story on the homeless, he lived on the streets; there, he met his wife, Sue Halpern, who was working as a homeless advocate. In 1987, McKibben quit &quot;The New Yorker&quot; after longtime editor William Shawn was forced out of his job. He and his family shortly after moved to a remote spot in the Southeastern Adirondacks of upstate New York, where he began to work as a freelance writer.

==Writing==
McKibben began his freelance writing career at about the same time that climate change appeared on the public agenda following the hot summer and fires of 1988 and testimony by James Hansen before the United States Senate Committee on Energy and Natural Resources in June of that year. His first contribution to the debate was a brief list of literature on the subject and commentary published December 1988 in &quot;The New York Review of Books &quot;and a question, &quot;Is the World Getting Hotter?&quot;

He became and remains a frequent contributor to various publications, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Atlantic&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, &quot;Orion&quot;, &quot;Mother Jones&quot;, &quot;The American Prospect&quot;, &quot;The New York Review of Books&quot;, &quot;Granta&quot;, &quot;National Geographic&quot;, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, &quot;Adbusters,&quot; and &quot;Outside&quot;. He is also a board member at and contributor to &quot;Grist&quot;.

His first book, &quot;The End of Nature&quot;, was published in 1989 by Random House after being serialized in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;. Described by Ray Murphy of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; as a &quot;righteous jeremiad,&quot; the book excited much critical comment, pro and con; was for many people their first introduction to the question of climate change; and the inspiration for a great deal of writing and publishing by others. It has been printed in more than 20 languages. Several editions have come out in the United States, including an updated version published in 2006.

In 1992, &quot;The Age of Missing Information&quot; was published. It is an account of an experiment in which McKibben collected everything that came across the 100 channels of cable TV on the Fairfax, Virginia, system (at the time among the nation&#x27;s largest) for a single day. He spent a year watching the 2,400 hours of programming, and then compared it to a day spent on the mountaintop near his home. This book has been widely used in colleges and high schools and was reissued in a new edition in 2006.
Subsequent books include &quot;Hope, Human and Wild&quot;, about Curitiba, Brazil, and Kerala, India, which he cites as examples of people living more lightly on the earth; &quot;The Comforting Whirlwind: God, Job, and the Scale of Creation&quot;, which is about the Book of Job and the environment; &quot;Maybe One&quot;, about human population; &quot;Long Distance: A Year of Living Strenuously&quot;, about a year spent training for endurance events at an elite level; and &quot;Enough&quot;, about what he sees as the existential dangers of genetic engineering and nanotechnology. Speaking about &quot;Long Distance&quot; at the Cambridge Forum, McKibben cited the work of Mihaly Csikszentmihalyi and Csikszentmihalyi&#x27;s idea of &quot;flow&quot; relative to feelings McKibben had had—&quot;taking a break from saving the world&quot;, he joked—as he immersed himself in cross-country skiing competitions.

&quot;Wandering Home&quot; is about a long solo hiking trip from his home in the mountains east of Lake Champlain in Ripton, Vermont, back to his longtime neighborhood of the Adirondacks. His book &quot;Deep Economy: the Wealth of Communities and the Durable Future&quot;, published in March 2007, was a national bestseller. It addresses what he sees as shortcomings of the growth economy and envisions a transition to more local-scale enterprise.

In fall 2007, he published, with the other members of his Step It Up team, &quot;Fight Global Warming Now&quot;, a handbook for activists trying to organize their local communities. In 2008, came &quot;The Bill McKibben Reader: Pieces from an Active Life&quot;, a collection of essays spanning his career. Also in 2008, the Library of America published &quot;American Earth,&quot; an anthology of American environmental writing since Thoreau edited by McKibben.
In 2010, he published another national bestseller, &quot;Eaarth: Making a Life on a Tough New Planet&quot;, an account of the rapid onset of climate change. It was excerpted in &quot;Scientific American&quot;.

In 2019, McKibben published &quot;&quot;, which details the growing concerns over climate change, how the Koch Brothers are contributing to an increase in carbon emissions by funding oil companies, and his concern with libertarianism, which he argues was sparked by the politics of the Reagan Revolution. He frequently argues that the Nordic model is preferable to a deregulated capitalist system, and that rapid innovation may come to hurt humanity.

In 2022, he published two books. &quot;We Are Better Together&quot; is a picture book for children celebrating the power of human cooperation and the beauty of life on Earth, illustrated by artist Stevie Lewis. &quot;The Flag, the Cross, and the Station Wagon: A Graying American Looks Back at His Suburban Boyhood and Wonders What the Hell Happened&quot; is a personal memoir that also digs into America&#x27;s history to reflect on what has brought us to the present environmental crisis.

Some of McKibben&#x27;s work has been extremely popular; an article in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; in July 2012 received over 125,000 likes on Facebook, 14,000 tweets, and 5,000 comments.

McKibben was the guest editor of the 2024 edition of The Best American Science and Nature Writing anthology.

==Environmental campaigns==
===Step It Up===
Step It Up 2007 was a nationwide environmental campaign started by McKibben to demand action on global warming by the U.S. Congress.

In late summer 2006 he helped lead a five-day walk across Vermont to call for action on global warming. Beginning in January 2007, he founded Step It Up 2007, which organized rallies in hundreds of American cities and towns on April 14, 2007, to demand that Congress enact curbs on carbon emissions by 80 percent by 2050. The campaign quickly won widespread support from a wide variety of environmental, student, and religious groups.

In August 2007 McKibben announced Step It Up 2, to take place November 3, 2007. In addition to the 80% by 2050 slogan from the first campaign, the second adds &quot;10% [reduction of emissions] in three years (&quot;Hit the Ground Running&quot;), a moratorium on new coal-fired power plants, and a Green Jobs Corps to help fix homes and businesses so those targets can be met&quot; (called &quot;Green Jobs Now, and No New Coal&quot;).

===350.org===

In the wake of Step It Up&#x27;s achievements, the same team announced a new campaign in March 2008 called 350.org. The organizing effort, aimed at the entire globe, drew its name from climate scientist James E. Hansen&#x27;s contention earlier that winter that any atmospheric concentration of carbon dioxide (CO2) above 350 parts per million was unsafe. &quot;If humanity wishes to preserve a planet similar to that on which civilization developed and to which life on Earth is adapted, paleoclimate evidence and ongoing climate change suggest that CO2 will need to be reduced from its current 385 ppm to at most 350 ppm, but likely less than that.&quot; Hansen et al. stated in the Abstract to their paper.

350.org, which has offices and organizers in North America, Europe, Asia, Africa and South America, attempted to spread that 350 number in advance of international climate meetings in December 2009 in Copenhagen. It was widely covered in the media. On October 24, 2009, it coordinated more than 5,200 demonstrations in 181 countries, and was widely lauded for its creative use of internet tools, with the website Critical Mass declaring that it was &quot;one of the strongest examples of social media optimization the world has ever seen.&quot; &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine called it &quot;the largest ever global coordinated rally of any kind.&quot;

Subsequently, the organization continued its work, with the Global Work Party on 10/10/10 (10 October 2010). As of 2022, McKibben is a senior advisor to 350.0rg and May Boeve is the executive director.

===Keystone XL===
McKibben is one of the environmentalists against the proposed Canadian-U.S. Keystone XL pipeline project.

===People&#x27;s Climate March===
On May 21, 2014, McKibben published an article on the website of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine (later appearing in the magazine&#x27;s print issue of June 5), titled &quot;A Call to Arms&quot;, which invited readers to a major climate march (later dubbed the People&#x27;s Climate March) in New York City on the weekend of September 20–21, as part of the People&#x27;s Climate Movement. In the article, McKibben calls climate change &quot;the biggest crisis our civilization has ever faced&quot;, and predicts that the march will be &quot;the largest demonstration yet of human resolve in the face of climate change&quot;.

On Sunday, July 5, 2015, McKibben led a similar climate march in Toronto, Ontario, with the support of various celebrities.

=== Third Act ===
In September 2021, McKibben launched Third Act, a group and campaign for climate change activists aged 60 or older, hoping to leverage the demographic&#x27;s free time and accumulated assets for political pressure on government. Supporters like Bernie Sanders and Jane Fonda promoted the project.

===Electoral politics===
During the 2016 Democratic presidential primary campaigns, McKibben served as a political surrogate for Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders. Sanders appointed him to the committee charged with writing the Democratic Party&#x27;s platform for 2016. After Sanders&#x27; defeat by Hillary Clinton, McKibben endorsed her and spoke at their first joint event in Portsmouth, New Hampshire. He has been mentioned as a potential future Cabinet member should Sanders win the presidency.

=== Keynotes ===
In 2020, McKibben delivered a keynote at &quot;2020 Vision: Finding Hope in Climate Action.&quot;

==Views==
In 2016, McKibben wrote in &quot;The New York Times&quot; that he is &quot;under surveillance&quot; by &quot;right-wing stalkers&quot; who photograph, pursue, and inquire about him and members of his family in search of ostensible instances of environmental hypocrisy. &quot;I&#x27;m being watched&quot;, he reported. Two years later, he wrote in the &quot;Times&quot; that he had been receiving death threats since the 1990s.

In December 2019, along with 42 other leading cultural figures, McKibben signed a letter endorsing the British Labour Party under Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership in the 2019 general election. The letter stated that &quot;Labour&#x27;s election manifesto under Jeremy Corbyn&#x27;s leadership offers a transformative plan that prioritizes the needs of people and the planet over private profit and the vested interests of a few.&quot;

==Personal life==
McKibben resides in Ripton, Vermont, with his wife, writer Sue Halpern. Their only child, Sophie, was born in 1993 in Glens Falls, New York. He is a Schumann Distinguished Scholar at Middlebury College, where he also directs the Middlebury Fellowships in Environmental Journalism. McKibben is also a fellow at the Post Carbon Institute. He is a longtime Methodist.

Since 2013, McKibben has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.

<text>Gnassingbé Eyadéma (; born Étienne Eyadéma Gnassingbé, 26 December 1935 – 5 February 2005) was a Togolese military officer and politician who was the president of Togo from 1967 until his death in 2005, after which he was immediately succeeded by his son, Faure Gnassingbé.

Eyadéma participated in two successful military coups, in January 1963 and January 1967, and became president on 14 April 1967. As president, he created a political party, the Rally of the Togolese People (), and headed an anti-communist single-party regime until the early 1990s, when reforms leading to multiparty elections began. Although his rule was seriously challenged by the events of the early 1990s, he ultimately consolidated power again and won multiparty presidential elections in 1993, 1998 and 2003; the opposition boycotted the 1993 election and denounced the 1998 and 2003 election results as fraudulent. At the time of his death, Eyadéma was the longest-serving ruler in Africa.

According to a 2018 study, his rule &quot;rested on repression, patronage, and a bizarre leadership cult.&quot;

== Early life and military career==
Usually Eyadéma is said to have been born on 26 December 1935 in the northern quartiers of Pya, a village in the prefecture of Kozah in the Kara Region, to a peasant family of the Kabye ethnic group. But this date has been disputed. According to Comi M. Toulabor, Eyadéma&#x27;s official date of birth is &quot;based on a fertile imagination&quot; and it would be more accurate to say that he was born around 1930. His mother was later known as Maman N&#x27;Danida, or Maman N&#x27;Danidaha.

In 1953, Eyadéma joined the French Army after completing primary school. He participated in the French Indochina War and the Algerian War.

Following nearly 10 years in the French army, Eyadéma returned to Togo in 1962. He was a leader in the 1963 Togolese coup d&#x27;état against President Sylvanus Olympio, who was assassinated during the attack. It has often been stated that Eyadéma himself committed the murder; shortly after the coup, Eyadéma himself told media including &quot;Time&quot; and &quot;Paris Match&quot; that he personally shot Olympio, although he denied responsibility decades later. On this occasion he helped establish Nicolas Grunitzky as the nation&#x27;s new president.

Four years on, Eyadéma, having fallen out with Grunitzky, led a second military coup against the latter. This time there was no bloodshed (the deposed Grunitzky managed to escape to exile in Paris) and Eyadéma installed himself as president on 14 April 1967, in addition to awarding himself the post of Defence Minister. He held both offices for almost 38 years.

== Politics ==
According to Comi M Toulabor (researcher at the Centre d&#x27;études d&#x27;Afrique noire), Eyadéma &quot;had been a personal friend of the French president, Jacques Chirac. He had remained in power for 38 years thanks to a couple of coups, systematic electoral fraud, the faithful allegiance of an army packed with supporters and members of his Kabye ethnic group, solid foreign support (especially from France), and adroit management of access to Togo&#x27;s meagre economic resources.&quot; Three years after taking power, Eyadéma created the Rally of the Togolese People as the country&#x27;s sole legal party. He won an uncontested election in 1972. In 1979, the country adopted a new constitution that returned the country (at least nominally) to civilian rule. The RPT was entrenched as the only party; the president of the party was automatically nominated for a seven-year term as president upon election to the party presidency and confirmed in office via an unopposed referendum. Under these provisions, Eyadéma was re-elected unopposed in 1979 and 1986. During his rule he escaped several assassination attempts; in 1974 he survived a plane crash in the northern part of the country near Sarakawa. After another unsuccessful assassination attempt by a bodyguard, he carried the bullet removed by the surgeon as an amulet.

A national conference was held in August 1991, electing Joseph Kokou Koffigoh as Prime Minister and leaving Eyadéma as merely a ceremonial president. Although Eyadéma attempted to suspend the conference, surrounding the venue with soldiers, he subsequently accepted the outcome. Despite this, Eyadéma managed to remain in power with the backing of the army; Koffigoh had asked France for military support, but the French government (traditionally an ally of Eyadéma and maintaining close ties to the latter through Jean-Christophe Mitterrand) declined to intervene. Koffigoh was then captured by Togolese soldiers. A period of heavy political repression followed, with troops loyal to Eyadéma carrying out systematic extrajudicial executions, arbitrary arrests and torture, as well as opening fire on a peaceful demonstration in January 1993. Commenting on this increased repression, Amnesty International spoke of &quot;feelings of impunity&quot; which had been &quot;enforced by support from foreign governments, notably the authorities in France&quot;.

In March 1993, an unsuccessful attack was made on the Tokoin military camp, where Eyadéma was living; several people were killed in the attack, including Eyadéma&#x27;s personal chief of staff, General Mawulikplimi Ameji.
He attempted to legitimize his rule with a multiparty presidential election in August 1993, which was boycotted by the opposition; facing only two minor challengers, he won 96.42% of the vote, although turnout was reportedly low outside of his native Kara Region. Eyadéma officially won re-election in the June 1998 presidential election, defeating Gilchrist Olympio of the Union of the Forces of Change (UFC) with 52.13% of the vote according to official results, amid allegations of fraud and accusations of the massacre of hundreds of government opponents. The European Union suspended aid in 1993 in protest of alleged voting irregularities and human rights violations.

In late December 2002, the Constitution was changed to remove term limits on the office of president. Previously, presidents had been limited to two five-year terms, and Eyadéma would have therefore been forced to step down after the 2003 election. With the removal of these limitations, however, Eyadéma was free to stand again and did so, winning the election on 1 June with 57.78% of the vote. He was sworn in for another term on 20 June. Another constitutional change was to reduce the minimum age of the president to 35 years, rather than 45.
Eyadéma constructed a large palace near his family home in Pya a few kilometers north of Lama-Kara. He was the chairman of the Organisation of African Unity from 2000 to 2001, and he attempted, unsuccessfully, to mediate between the government and rebels of Ivory Coast in the First Ivorian Civil War, that began in that country in 2002.

The European Union sent a mission on 1 June 2004, to evaluate the state of democracy in Togo and to start a procedure of democratization of Togo. The expedition intended to open a dialogue between the state and the opposition. The team was supposed to meet with many politicians from other parties than Eyadéma&#x27;s party, Rally of the Togolese People. But because of the criteria imposed by the government, politicians such as Gilchrist Olympio, Yawovi Agboyibo, and Professor Leopold Gnininvi boycotted the meeting. The European Union team cancelled the meeting since discussions with the government were almost impossible. The opposition party UFC wanted the release of 11 men held by the government. Finally, the European Union experts met each political figure individually and in private. The respect of human rights and of the press in Togo were to be investigated by the European Union experts.

According to BBC News, Eyadéma claimed that democracy in Africa &quot;moves along at its own pace and in its own way.&quot;

== Personality cult ==

Eyadéma had an extensive personality cult, including an entourage of 1,000 dancing women who sang and danced in praise of him; portraits which adorned most stores; a bronze statue in the capital city, Lomé; wristwatches with his portrait, which disappeared and re-appeared every fifteen seconds; and a comic book that depicted him as a superhero with powers of invulnerability and super strength. In addition, the date of a failed attempt on President Eyadéma&#x27;s life was annually commemorated as &quot;the Feast of Victory Over Forces of Evil.&quot;

Eyadéma even changed his first name from Étienne to Gnassingbé to note the date of the 24 January 1974 plane crash of which he was claimed to be the only survivor. In reality, he was not the sole survivor of the crash. There were other survivors, but he deliberately misrepresented the details of the accident to make himself look like a hero with superhuman strength who miraculously survived the disaster when everyone else was killed. Eyadéma claimed that the crash was not an accident and was in fact a conspiracy to kill him, plotted by imperialists who did not like his plan (announced two weeks before the crash) to nationalize the important phosphate mining company, the (CTMB or Cotomib). His C-47 was replaced by a new presidential jet, Gulfstream II, which was again damaged beyond repair in a fatal accident in the same year. Eyadéma was not on board at the time.

== Death ==
On 5 February 2005, Eyadéma died on board a plane south of Tunis, Tunisia. He died &quot;as he was being evacuated for emergency treatment abroad&quot;, according to a government statement. Officials have stated that the cause of death was a heart attack. At the time of his death he was the longest-serving head of state in Africa.

Zakari Nandja, chief of the Togolese army, pronounced Eyadéma&#x27;s son Faure Gnassingbé as the new president of Togo. Alpha Oumar Konaré, president of the Commission of the African Union, immediately declared this act to be a military coup d&#x27;état and against the constitution. ECOWAS also did not approve the designation of Faure Gnassingbé as president. Under heavy pressure from ECOWAS and the international community, Faure Gnassingbé stepped down on 25 February and was replaced by Bonfoh Abass, the first deputy parliament speaker, until after the presidential elections on 24 April 2005, when Faure Gnassingbé was elected president with 60% of the vote.

Eyadéma&#x27;s funeral was held on 13 March 2005, in the presence of a number of presidents and other international dignitaries; Presidents Mathieu Kérékou of Benin, John Kufuor of Ghana, Laurent Gbagbo of Ivory Coast, Mamadou Tandja of Niger and Olusegun Obasanjo of Nigeria attended the ceremony. On 15 March, Eyadéma&#x27;s family and the RPT party paid him a final homage in his hometown of Pya.

<text>Sergei Rachmaninoff&#x27;s Piano Concerto No. 3 in D minor, Op. 30, was composed in the summer of 1909. The piece was premiered on November 28 of that year in New York City with the composer as soloist, accompanied by the New York Symphony Society under Walter Damrosch. The work has the reputation of being one of the most technically challenging piano concertos in the standard classical piano repertoire.

==History==

=== Background and premiere ===
Rachmaninoff composed the concerto in Dresden completing it on September 23, 1909. Contemporary with this work are his First Piano Sonata and his tone poem &quot;The Isle of the Dead&quot;.

Owing to its difficulty, the concerto is respected, even feared, by many pianists. Josef Hofmann, the pianist to whom the work is dedicated, never publicly performed it, saying that it &quot;wasn&#x27;t for&quot; him. Gary Graffman lamented he had not learned this concerto as a student, when he was &quot;still too young to know fear&quot;.

Due to time constraints, Rachmaninoff could not practice the piece while in Russia. Instead, he practiced it on a silent keyboard that he brought with him while en route to the United States. The concerto was first performed on Sunday, November 28, 1909, at the New Theatre in New York City. Rachmaninoff was the soloist, with the New York Symphony Society with Walter Damrosch conducting. The work received a second performance under Gustav Mahler on January 16, 1910, an &quot;experience Rachmaninoff treasured&quot;. Rachmaninoff later described the rehearsal to Riesemann:
The score was first published in 1910 by Gutheil. Rachmaninoff called the Third the favorite of his own piano concertos, stating that &quot;I much prefer the Third, because my Second is so uncomfortable to play.&quot;

=== Changing public opinion and future performances ===
Public opinion regarding the Third Concerto was mixed following the premiere in New York. On November 30, 1909, two days after the premiere, a critic for the New York Sun wrote &quot;Sound, reasonable music this, though not a great nor memorable proclamation.&quot; The New York Times, a few months later, included a review of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s work: &quot;On this occasion the favorable impression it had made when it was played before was deepened. It is more mature, more finished, more interesting in its structure, and more effective than Rachmaninoff&#x27;s other compositions in this form…but it was felt by many yesterday…that many another pianist could play it better than the composer.&quot;

However, by 1919, public perception of the concerto (as well as Rachmaninoff&#x27;s pianistic capabilities) turned more positive. He was increasingly praised for his commitment to resonance and musicality rather than a display of technique and virtuosity. The concerto was &quot;affected by this new appreciation for his convictions&quot;, according to Ruby Cheng. In a 1930 letter, Rachmaninoff&#x27;s brother-in-law Vladimir Satin expressed a feeling of nostalgia for a &quot;lost Russia&quot;, thanking him for allowing listeners to live in the &quot;good past&quot; and forget the &quot;bad future&quot;. Rachmaninoff became a symbol of an old, nationalistic identity of Russia; many believed he was among the last. The Third Concerto served the same purpose as the Second in this way: he &quot;spoke directly to the Russian soul.&quot; The concerto soon became more popular in the United States than the Second Concerto, partially due to the fact that Rachmaninoff wrote the Third specifically for his American tour.

Vladimir Horowitz&#x27;s 1930 studio recording of the concerto brought immense popularity to the piece around the world. In 1927, Horowitz met with Rachmaninoff in New York, where he performed the piece for him. By receiving feedback from the composer, Horowitz&#x27;s interpretation of the concerto &quot;most closely resembled Rachmaninoff&#x27;s performance in its finely chiseled, almost steely delivery.&quot; Ruby Cheng writes, &quot;With these expansions of musical expression and pianism, Horowitz brought the Third Concerto into a prominence that broke through any listener resistance.&quot; Horowitz later said &quot;Without false modesty, I brought this concerto to light. I brought it to life, and everywhere!&quot;

=== Comparison to Second Piano Concerto and legacy ===
Russian critic Grigory Prokofiev wrote &quot;The new concerto mirrored the best sides of [Rachmaninoff&#x27;s] creative power - sincerity, simplicity and clarity of musical thought.&quot; According to Varazdat Khachatryan, the Third Concerto was more piano-centric than Rachmaninoff&#x27;s previous concertos, presenting the solo pianist as the main attraction, rather than the ensemble as a whole. Much of the structure of the Third Concerto echoes that of the Second, and further develops Rachmaninoff&#x27;s writing style. The piece is far more structurally complex, however; advanced polyrhythms and texture feature throughout. Boris Asafiev writes that the Third Concerto departs from the &quot;naive romantic features&quot; seen in his earlier compositions, namely the Second Concerto. In addition, the three movements of the Third Concerto, in terms of motives and theme, resemble the cyclic form of the classical symphony, unlike his Second.

It is generally agreed that the melodic density and complexity found in the concerto, namely the &quot;ossia cadenza&quot; of the first movement, is among the most challenging in all of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s works. The composition is seen by many as the pinnacle of Rachmaninoff&#x27;s career as a composer.

==Instrumentation==
The concerto is scored for piano and orchestra.
* Woodwinds:
** 2 flutes
** 2 oboes
** 2 clarinets
** 2 bassoons

==Structure==

The work follows the form of a standard piano concerto, constructed into three movements. The end of the second movement leads directly into the third without interruption. 
=== I. Allegro ma non tanto ===
The first movement is in sonata-allegro form. The piece revolves around a diatonic melody which Rachmaninoff claimed &quot;wrote itself&quot;. The theme soon develops into complex and busy pianistic figuration.

The second theme opens with quiet exchanges between the orchestra and the piano before fully diving into the second theme in B major. The first part of the first theme is restated before the movement is pulled into a loud development section in C minor which opens with toccata-like quavers in the piano and reaches a loud chordal section. The whole development exhibits features similar to a canon, such as an eighth note passage in the piano in which the left hand and the right hand play overlapping figures. The movement reaches a number of ferocious climaxes, especially in the cadenza.

 }
}&lt;/score&gt;}}

Rachmaninoff wrote two versions of this cadenza: the chordal original, which is commonly notated as the &quot;ossia&quot;, and a second one with a lighter, toccata-like style. Both cadenzas lead into a quiet solo section where the flute, oboe, clarinet and horn individually restate the first theme of the exposition, accompanied by delicate arpeggios in the piano. The cadenza then ends quietly, but the piano alone continues to play a quiet development of the exposition&#x27;s second theme in E major before leading to the recapitulation, where the first theme is restated by the piano, with the orchestra accompanying, soon closing with a quiet, rippling coda reminiscent of the second theme.

=== II: Intermezzo ===
The second movement is constructed around a theme and variations, in an ABACA form, while shifting around various home keys. The theme and first two variations are played by the orchestra alone. The piano then plays several variations with and without the orchestra.
After the first theme development and recapitulation of the second theme, the main melody from the first movement reappears, before the movement is closed by the orchestra in a manner similar to the introduction. The piano ends the movement with a short, violent &quot;cadenza-esque&quot; passage which moves into the last movement . Many melodic thoughts of this movement allude to Rachmaninoff&#x27;s second piano concerto, third movement, noticeably the Russian-like E major melody.

The movement ends with tutti chords leading into the 3rd movement &quot;attacca&quot;.

=== III: Finale ===
The third movement is in a modified sonata-allegro form, and is quick and vigorous.

The movement contains variations on many of the themes that are used in the first movement, which unites the concerto cyclically. However, after the first and second themes it diverges from the regular sonata-allegro form. There is no conventional development; that segment is replaced by a lengthy digression in E major, which leads to the two themes from the first movement. After the digression, the movement recapitulation returns to the original themes, building up to a toccata climax somewhat similar but lighter than the first movement&#x27;s &quot;ossia&quot; cadenza and accompanied by the orchestra. The movement concludes with a triumphant and passionate second theme melody in D major. The piece ends with the same four-note rhythm – claimed by some to be the composer&#x27;s musical signature – as it is used in both the composer&#x27;s second concerto and second symphony.

Rachmaninoff, under pressure, and hoping to make his work more popular, authorized several cuts in the score, to be made at the performer&#x27;s discretion. These cuts, particularly in the second and third movements, were commonly taken in performance and recordings during the initial decades following the concerto&#x27;s publication. More recently, it has become commonplace to perform the concerto without cuts. A typical performance of the complete concerto has a duration of about forty minutes.

==In popular culture==
The concerto plays the role of a leitmotif in the 1996 film &quot;Shine&quot;, based on the life of pianist David Helfgott.

<text>The Crowsnest Highway is an east-west highway in British Columbia and Alberta, Canada. It stretches across the southern portions of both provinces, from Hope, British Columbia to Medicine Hat, Alberta, providing the shortest highway connection between the Lower Mainland and southeast Alberta through the Canadian Rockies. Mostly two-lane, the highway was officially designated in 1932, mainly following a mid-19th-century gold rush trail originally traced out by an engineer named Edgar Dewdney. It takes its name from the Crowsnest Pass, the location at which the highway crosses the Continental Divide between British Columbia and Alberta.

In British Columbia, the highway is entirely in mountainous regions and is also known as the Southern Trans-Provincial Highway. The western-most segment between the Trans-Canada Highway and Highway 5A is locally known as the Hope-Princeton Highway, and passes by the site of the Hope Slide. In Alberta, the terrain is initially mountainous, before smoothing to foothills and eventually generally flat prairie in the vicinity of Pincher Creek. The highway forms part of the Red Coat Trail and the CANAMEX Corridor from Highway 2 near Fort Macleod to Highway 4 in Lethbridge.
Many sections of the highway were built by Japanese labour while they were interned during the Second World War, including sections like the Hope-Princeton. This history has been preserved at a heritage marker at Sunshine Valley, which was the largest internment camp in Canada.

== Route description ==
Crowsnest Highway is designated a core route in Canada&#x27;s National Highway System, and is designated as Highway 3 for its entire length.

=== British Columbia ===
The Crowsnest Highway&#x27;s western terminus is at Hope, where it branches off from the Trans-Canada Highway (Highway 1). The highway goes east for to its junction with the Coquihalla Highway (Highway 5), where it exits the freeway and continues for on a segment known as the &quot;Hope-Princeton Highway&quot;, passing the Hope Slide en route to Allison Pass, Manning Provincial Park, and Sunday Summit; at Princeton, the Crowsnest Highway meets Highway 5A. East of Princeton, the Crowsnest Highway goes southeast for to Keremeos, where it meets Highway 3A, leading towards Penticton and Highway 97. Another southeast, and the Crowsnest Highway reaches Osoyoos and a junction with Highway 97.


Approximately east of Osoyoos, the Crowsnest Highway reaches its junction with Highway 33 at Rock Creek, then the highway heads east for to its junction with Highway 41, just before passing through Grand Forks. Another east, the Crowsnest Highway meets Highway 395 at the southern end of Christina Lake. The Crowsnest Highway travels for through Bonanza Pass to its junction with Highway 3B at Nancy Greene Lake, which is the cutoff to Rossland and Trail. It is another east to Castlegar, where the Crowsnest Highway intersects Highway 22 and Highway 3A, leading towards Nelson. Approximately east of Castlegar, the Crowsnest Highway reaches its eastern junction with Highway 3B; another to the east it converges with Highway 6 at Salmo and the two highways share a concurrency for to Burnt Flat.

The Crowsnest Highway continues through the Kootenay Pass on the Salmo-Creston Highway, a stretch known colloquially as the &quot;Kootenay Skyway&quot;, or &quot;Salmo-Creston Skyway&quot;. east of Burnt Flat, the Crowsnest Highway reaches Creston, just past junctions with Highway 21 and Highway 3A. later, south of Yahk, Highway 95 merges onto the Crowsnest Highway. The two highways share a common alignment for northeast to Cranbrook and the junction with Highway 95A. Another east, Highway 95 diverges north while Highway 93 merges onto the Crowsnest Highway from a shared alignment. Highway 93 and the Crowsnest share a common alignment for the next southeast to Elko, where Highway 93 diverges south. northeast of Elko, the Crowsnest Highway reaches Fernie, then it goes north another to its junction with Highway 43 at Sparwood, and another east, the highway reaches the boundary with Alberta at Crowsnest Pass.

The Alberta portion of the Crowsnest Highway is also designated as Highway 3, running for approximately from the British Columbia border to Medicine Hat. It begins in Crowsnest Pass paralleling the Canadian Pacific Railway, first meeting Highway 40 at Coleman, then running east to the southern terminus of Highway 22. Highway 6 splits south near Pincher Creek. Approximately east of Pincher Creek, the highway becomes divided and interchanges with Highway 2 with which it is briefly concurrent, assuming the designation of the Red Coat Trail and CANAMEX Corridor. It proceeds for into the town of Fort Macleod, after which Highway 2 splits south to Cardston and the United States border. Highway 3 then crosses the Oldman River east of Fort Macleod near Monarch, prior to a partial interchange with Highway 23.

After Coalhurst, the highway reaches Westview Drive W, which provides access to West Lethbridge. It then becomes a freeway named Crowsnest Trail as it reaches Highway 25 which branches north to Picture Butte while University Drive runs south to the University of Lethbridge as the main thoroughfare through West Lethbridge. Highway 3 again crosses the Oldman River in central Lethbridge and the freeway segment ends at Mayor Magrath Drive, marking the northern terminus of Highway 5. The highway meets the northern end of Highway 4 at the eastern limit of Lethbridge before continuing east to Coaldale and Taber. Within Taber, Highway 36 runs concurrently with Highway 3 for . The highway reduces to a two-lane undivided road and the Crowsnest Highway ends later at the Trans-Canada Highway in Medicine Hat.

==Future==
Alberta Transportation has long-term plans to upgrade the entire Highway 3 corridor to a freeway from the British Columbia border to Medicine Hat. The plans include the construction of a Lethbridge bypass to render the CANAMEX Corridor free-flowing through southern Alberta, in combination with proposed bypasses of Fort Macleod, Claresholm and Nanton. The route would split from Highway 3 west of Coalhurst and run east, bypassing Lethbridge and Coaldale to the north before rejoining the existing highway.

During the 2021 British Columbia floods, the Crowsnest Highway was closed by landslides, as were the other routes connecting the Lower Mainland with the rest of Canada. It was the first of these routes to reopen. During the period when it was the only road route between Metro Vancouver and the rest of Canada, it experienced a high rate of crashes among heavy trucks driving faster than the route&#x27;s windy curves would allow for.

<text>The Bruderhof (; German for &#x27;place of brothers&#x27;) is a communal Anabaptist Christian movement that was founded in Germany in 1920 by Eberhard Arnold. The movement has communities in the United States, the United Kingdom, Germany, Austria, Paraguay, and Australia. The Bruderhof practises believer&#x27;s baptism, non-violence and peacemaking, common ownership, the proclamation of the gospel, and lifelong faithfulness in marriage. The Bruderhof is an intentional community as defined by the Fellowship for Intentional Community.

The communities are best known by the name &quot;Bruderhof&quot; or sometimes &quot;Bruderhof Communities&quot;, although &quot;Bruderhof&quot; is the name used on their website. The communities are legally incorporated in the US as Church Communities International. Their corporation used to be called The Society of Brothers (1939 to 1978). Bruderhof maintained connections with the traditional Hutterite Brethren, from which they broke in 1995. The word &quot;Bruderhof&quot; was first used by the early Anabaptists in Moravia. , there are 24 Bruderhof communities.

== Name ==
The word Bruderhof was first used by the Hutterites to refer to their communities in Moravia and then in other areas as the movement expanded. In the 1920s, Eberhard Arnold developed a growing interest in the Hutterites, and his first written reference to the community at Sannerz as a Bruderhof appears in letter from 1926, indicating an initial identification with the Hutterite movement.

== History ==

=== Beginnings in Germany (1920–1937) ===
The Bruderhof was founded in Germany in 1920 by Eberhard Arnold, a philosophy student and intellectual inspired by the German Youth Movement and his wife Emmy, &quot;née&quot; von Hollander. In 1920, the young family with five children rented a house in Sannerz, Hesse, and founded a Christian community.

When the group outgrew the house at Sannerz, they moved to the nearby Rhön Mountains. While there, Arnold discovered that the Hutterites (an Anabaptist movement he had studied with great interest) were still in existence in North America. In 1930, he traveled to meet the Hutterites and was ordained as a Hutterian minister.

With the rise of Adolf Hitler and Nazism, the Rhön community moved its draft-age men and children to Liechtenstein around 1934 because of their conscientious refusal to serve in the armed forces and to accept Nazi teachings. This community became known as the &quot;Alm Bruderhof&quot;. Continuing pressure from the Nazi government caused others to move to England and found the Cotswold Bruderhof in 1936. On 14 April 1937 secret police surrounded the Rhön Bruderhof, confiscated the property, and gave the remaining community members forty-eight hours to flee the country. By 1938, all the Bruderhof members had reassembled in England.

=== England (1937–1960) ===
In 1936 the Bruderhof had purchased a farm in England called Ashton Fields, near the village of Ashton Keynes in the Cotswolds area. Originally intended to be a mission post, it provided sanctuary when they were forced to escape Nazi Germany. While based in England, the Bruderhof membership grew to over 350 members, largely through the addition of young English members who were conscientious objectors seeking an alternative to the now seemingly inevitable war with Germany. However, even before the outbreak of World War II in 1939, the presence of the community&#x27;s German members and its pacifist stance attracted deep suspicion locally, resulting in economic boycotts against the farm. In 1940, confronted with the option of either having all of its German members interned for the duration and its English members conscripted, or leaving England as a group, the Bruderhof chose the latter and some began to look for refuge abroad.

Not all members wished to leave England. By Christmas 1941 the remaining group of 19 found a remote farm for sale, Lower Bromdon Farm in the Clee Hills, near Ludlow in Shropshire, and in March 1942 the group moved in to their new home. By the end of the year the group named itself the Wheathill Bruderhof. In April 1944 they took over the neighboring Upper Bromdon farm of , and in 1945 the community extended to Cleeton Court Farm at the foot of Titterstone Clee Hill, bringing the three Wheathill farms to a total size of . In 1959 Pathé Newsreel produced a short film on the community, just as Bruderhof as a whole was in turmoil, and the Wheathill community closed within the next two years.

=== Paraguay (1941–1961; 2010–present) ===

In 1941, the Bruderhof emigrated from England to Paraguay — at the time the only country that would accept a pacifist community of mixed nationalities. This move was assisted and facilitated by the Mennonite Central Committee.

Starting in the hostile Chaco region, the Bruderhof then relocated to eastern Paraguay where three settlements were founded on a large tract of land called Primavera. Bruderhof members founded a hospital for community members and local Paraguayans. The only clinic in the area, it served tens of thousands for the next two decades. By the early 1960s, the community in Paraguay had grown significantly and was attracting visitors from North America.

In 1942, several leaders of the community came in conflict with a group of members over the community&#x27;s trajectory. This group, which included the founder&#x27;s wife Emmy Arnold, argued that the founder&#x27;s vision was rooted in a pietistic faith in Jesus Christ, not primarily in communitarian ideals. Eventually the church leadership, headed by the founder&#x27;s son-in-law Hans Zumpe, banished the dissidents from the Bruderhof. Those who supported them were silenced, often with harsh discipline.

Eventually allowed back to join their families, the dissidents re-joined the community. One of them, Johann Heinrich Arnold, a son of Eberhard and Emmy Arnold, was sent with his family to the United States to raise funds and eventually started a new community called Woodcrest, in Rifton, New York, in 1954. Over the following years, conflicts between Zumpe and Arnold continued, culminating in a crisis resulting in Zumpe being relieved of his leadership role by the community. Zumpe left the community in 1960 after revelations of personal issues.

Many members who supported Zumpe, and some who were confused by the turmoil, left or were asked to leave the community. Eventually, the communities in Paraguay were dissolved and the members who remained relocated to the United States. Many of those who left the community during the 1960s later returned, but some remained outside of the community and formed a group of critics of the Bruderhof. Their stories formed the basis for the 2000 book written by Julius Rubin, &quot;The Other Side of Joy: Religious Melancholy among the Bruderhof.&quot; Rubin himself never visited the Bruderhof.

In 2010, the Bruderhof opened the Villa Primavera Community in Asunción, Paraguay.

=== United States (1954–present) ===
In 1954, the Bruderhof started a settlement known as the Woodcrest Bruderhof in the United States near Rifton, New York, in response to a dramatic increase in the number of American guests. Woodcrest absorbed the Macedonia Cooperative Community in Georgia and many members of the Kingwood Community in New Jersey. Through the Macedonia Cooperative Community, Woodcrest inherited the business Community Playthings. Additional new communities were founded in Pennsylvania (1957) and Connecticut (1958).

In 1990, the Spring Valley Bruderhof was founded adjacent to the New Meadow Run Bruderhof in Farmington, Pennsylvania. As of April 2021, there are a total of 18 Bruderhof communities in the United States.

===Europe (1971–present)===
As of April 2024, there are three Bruderhof Communities in the United Kingdom, two in Germany and two in Austria.

====England====
In 1971, the Bruderhof purchased a property in Robertsbridge, East Sussex, United Kingdom called Darvell. The property had previously been a tuberculosis hospital. In 1995, a former sports college in Kent was purchased. In 2005, the Bruderhof started a small community in East London. This urban Bruderhof has now been moved to Peckham in south east London.

====Germany====
In 2002, the Bruderhof purchased a house in Sannerz, Germany.

==== Austria ====
The Bruderhof operate two communities in Austria, those being the Gutshof and the Am Stein locations.

=== Australia (1999–present) ===
The Bruderhof opened a community in Elsmore, a village in the northeast of the Australian state of New South Wales, in 1999. In 2005, the Bruderhof opened a community in the adjacent town of Inverell, where they operate a sign-writing business. Also in 2005, the Bruderhof opened a community in Armidale, the nearest city to Inverell and Elsmore.

=== South Korea (2022–present) ===
The Bruderhof opened a community in Yeongwol, Gangwon Province in South Korea in 2022.

==Beliefs and practice==
The Bruderhof is an evangelical Anabaptist community that seeks to emulate the practices of early Christianity. Eberhard Arnold drew inspiration from a number of historical streams, including early Christianity, the Anabaptists, German Pietism and the German Youth Movement. Johann Blumhardt (1805–1880) and his son Christoph Blumhardt (1842–1919), both German Lutheran theologians, are important sources of Bruderhof piety.

The Bruderhof practice Christian pacifism and therefore reject the practice of military conscription, reflecting the early Anabaptist beliefs formulated in the Schleitheim Confession.

Bruderhof members do not hold private property, but rather share everything. Members work inside the Bruderhof, and nobody receives a salary or has a bank account. Income from all businesses is pooled and used for the care of all members and for various communal outreach efforts. Every member of the organization must take a vow that he or she is willing &quot;to put yourself completely at the disposal of the church community to the end of your life – all your faculties, the entire strength of your body and soul, and all your property, both that which you now possess and that which you may later inherit or earn.&quot;

The Bruderhof practices believers&#x27; baptism, which does not equate to membership. Membership is lifetime and by vows after the age of 21. The Bruderhof also practices what they would call &quot;The law of love&quot; based on the house rule of the first Bruderhof in 1925:

The Bruderhof believes marriage to be &quot;the lifelong union between one man and one woman&quot; and believes that sexual love should only be shared in such a marriage relationship. They believe divorce and remarriage to be wrong. It has supported and run marriage events to promote marriage between one man and one woman both in the United States and the United Kingdom. The Bruderhof also participated in Humanum, a conference held in the Vatican from 17 to 19 November 2014 and attended by Pope Francis, to discuss the complementarity of man and woman.

In accordance with the Anabaptist doctrine of nonconformity to the world, the Bruderhof wear plain dress, with women donning a headcovering (typically a hanging veil) in accordance with 1 Corinthians 11 in the Christian Bible.

==Present day life==

Most communities have a nursery, kindergarten, school, communal kitchen, laundry, various workshops, and offices. Bruderhof life is built around the family, though there are also many single members. Children are an important part of each community and participate in most communal gatherings. Disabled and elderly members are cared for within the community and participate in daily life and work as much as they are able.

The Bruderhof eats one meal together each day as a community. Other meals are eaten in families. Singing is a very common form of worship in the community, and members often sing before meals. The Bruderhof do not prohibit the consumption of alcohol.

Numerous guests visit the Bruderhof and all communities are open to guests. The Bruderhof is estimated to have around 2,900 members worldwide.

=== Technology ===
The Bruderhof has a reserved attitude to the use of technology. Bruderhof families do not watch television or use the Internet within the home but do so outside of it, with many using smartphones. Unlike the Amish, they own and drive cars and run modern businesses and factories. They now run two main websites (bruderhof.com and plough.com) and several social media channels. Some of their members run video blogs that document their life on the Bruderhof that are published online.

=== Education ===
The Bruderhof runs schools for the children on each community, up to the age of 18, when they are allowed to leave the community. In 2019 the Beech Grove School added two boarding houses to their school.

== Locations ==
==Businesses==
The Bruderhof run a variety of businesses that provide income to run their communities and provide common work for the members who almost all work onsite.

Community Playthings was developed during the 1950s and soon became the Bruderhof&#x27;s main source of income. Community Playthings designs and manufactures quality wooden classroom and play environments and toys for schools and daycare centers. The business is run by the communities in the United States and United Kingdom.

Rifton Equipment, run by some of the American communities, sells mobility and rehabilitation equipment for disabled adults and children. It was founded in 1977.

Danthonia Designs is the business that supports the Australian Bruderhofs. It specializes in hand-carved three-dimensional signage and was founded in 2001.

== Involvement in the wider community ==
The Bruderhof is actively involved in the neighborhoods that surround its communities and in the world at large. The Bruderhof sees justice and the works of mercy as a gospel command. They foster many ecumenical relationships with other churches and denominations. For instance, in 2019 the Bruderhof collaborated with the Coptic church to commemorate the Coptic martyrs killed by ISIS. Members met the Pope in Rome in 2004.

Bruderhof members serve on school boards, volunteer at soup kitchens, prisons and hospitals, and work with local social service agencies such as the police to provide food and shelter for those in need of help. They are active supporters of various international aid organizations, such as Oxfam, Save the Children, Tearfund, and World Vision.

The Bruderhof&#x27;s Plough Publishing House publishes books and a magazine called &quot;Plough Quarterly&quot;. &quot;Plough&quot; publishes spiritual classics, inspirational books, and children&#x27;s books, some of which are available as free downloads. Some of the books are written by Bruderhof members, but others are not.

In response to the Columbine High School massacre in 1999, the Bruderhof and Detective Steven McDonald created a program of school assemblies that have now reached tens of thousands of youths in the United States and United Kingdom. Operating under the name &quot;Breaking the Cycle&quot;, speakers with forgiveness stories speak to children at school assemblies.

The Bruderhof community has at various times campaigned on social issues, such as the death penalty and the Iraq War. They were involved in the campaign in opposition to the death sentence for the activist Mumia Abu-Jamal, who was convicted in 1982 of murdering a Philadelphia police officer.

== The Bruderhof in the media ==
The Bruderhof rarely appear in the mainstream media, but sometimes allow photographers or journalists to observe their life.

=== Inside the Bruderhof – BBC One ===
The Darvell Bruderhof in East Sussex allowed CTVC to produce a 40-minute documentary about them, &quot;Inside the Bruderhof&quot;, which was scheduled to air on 25 July 2019 on BBC1 but was pulled as a result of &quot;BBC News at Ten&quot; over-running. It was eventually broadcast on 13 August 2020 on BBC1. The film shows life inside the community, and follows a young person who has reached the age when the Bruderhof encourage them to explore life outside the community.

=== BBC Inside Out ===
In March 2020, the BBC&#x27;s &quot;Inside Out South East&quot; published a series of allegations from former members of the community that variously described attempted exorcism of a woman with mental health problems, public punishment of teenagers who had relationships and hostile attitudes to those who left the community. The Bruderhof objected to the programme, pointing out that the journalist who made the programme had never visited the community. They also said that the most serious allegations had been reported to statutory authorities who had chosen to take no further action.

The Bruderhof issued a statement saying the testimony of former members in this story presented a &quot;misleading account&quot; of the community. &quot;We are an open and welcoming Christian community who, while not perfect, are doing our best to make the world a better place,&quot; it said. &quot;Ofsted has for decades been inspecting the provision we make for our children and has never found any cause for concern. The Bruderhof is 100 years old this year. In that time we haven&#x27;t got everything right, for which we are sorry. We are committed to listening to anyone who feels hurt by their experiences with the Bruderhof.&quot;

== Relationship with the Hutterites ==
The Bruderhof Communities and the Hutterites were in fellowship between 1930 and 1955 and between 1974 and 1995. In 1990, the Lehrerleut and the Dariusleut withdrew, while the Schmiedeleut maintained their bond to the Bruderhof. After the split among the Schmiedeleut in 1992, the more traditional group also withdrew, while the more progressive branch (led by Jacob Kleinsasser) kept the bond until 1995. Since then, the traditional Hutterites and the Bruderhof have been separate groups.

The reason for the withdrawal of the Hutterites in 1955 was a conflict about the Forest River Hutterite Colony, which joined the Bruderhof by a majority vote. In 1974 there was reconciliation between the two groups. In 1990 two of the three branches of the traditional Hutterites withdrew over concerns in regard to education, worship services and relations with outsiders, such as political activism.

According to Rod Janzen, there are differences between the traditional Hutterites and the Bruderhof Communities on many fields. Besides cultural differences, there are differences in regard to education, leadership, decision making, church discipline, ecumenism, what constitutes the &quot;Word of God&quot; etc. All these differences led to the final break in 1995.

<doc id="367059" wikidata="Q27075864" url="?curid=367059" title="Eurasian siskin">
<text>The Eurasian siskin (Spinus spinus) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. It is also called the European siskin, common siskin or just siskin. Other (archaic) names include &quot;black-headed goldfinch&quot;, &quot;barley bird&quot; and &quot;aberdevine&quot;. It is very common throughout Europe and Eurosiberia. It is found in forested areas, both coniferous and mixed woodland where it feeds on seeds of all kinds, especially of alder and conifers.

It can be distinguished from other similar finches by the colour of the plumage. The upper parts are greyish green and the under parts grey-streaked white. Its wings are black with a conspicuous yellow wing bar, and the tail is black with yellow sides. The male has a mainly yellow face and breast, with a neat black cap. Female and young birds have a greyish green head and no cap. It is a trusting, sociable and active bird. The song of this bird is a pleasant mix of twitters and trills.

These birds have an unusual migration pattern as every few years in winter they migrate southwards in large numbers. The reasons for this behaviour are not known but may be related to climatic factors and above all the availability of food. In this way overwintering populations can thrive where food is abundant. This small finch is an acrobatic feeder, often hanging upside-down like a tit. It will visit garden bird feeding stations.

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The siskin was first described by Carl Linnaeus in his landmark 1758 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; as &quot;Fringilla spinus&quot;, in the 10th edition of &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. In 1760, Brisson described the genus &quot;Carduelis&quot;, where this species was then placed. Recent taxonomic studies suggest placing it in the genus &quot;Spinus&quot;.

The scientific name &quot;Spinus&quot; is from the Ancient Greek &quot;spinos&quot;, a name for a now-unidentifiable bird.

Despite being found across a wide area it is a monotypic species, that is, there are no distinct subspecies. This could be explained by a number of factors, such as spatial variability of individuals in breeding areas between years, the large overwintering area which supports a constant genetic interchange, and females having a number of clutches of eggs in one breeding season, each in a different place.

==Etymology==

The name siskin is derived from an adaptation of the German dialect words , , which are diminutive forms of Middle High German (&quot;zîsec&quot;) and Middle Low German (&quot;ziseke&quot;, &quot;sisek&quot;) words, with cognates in Slavic languages, such as Czech ; these names are all of onomatopoeic origin, derived from the bird&#x27;s calls. The name is first recorded in written English in 1544 in William Turner&#x27;s &quot;Avium praecipuarum, quarum apud Plinium et Aristotelem mentio est, brevis et succincta historia&quot;.

==Description==
The siskin is a small, short-tailed bird, in length with a wingspan that ranges from . It weighs between .

The bird shows sexual dimorphism. The male has a greyish green back; yellow rump; the sides of the tail are yellow and the end is black; the wings are black with a distinctive yellow wing stripe; its breast is yellowish becoming whiter and striped towards the cloaca; it has a black bib (or chin patch) and on its head it has two yellow auriculas and a black cap. The amount of black on the bib is very variable between males and the size of the bib has been related to dominance within a flock. The plumage of the female is more olive-coloured than the male. The cap and the auriculas are greenish with a white bib and a rump that is a slightly striped whitish yellow. The young have a similar colouration to the females, with drab colours and a more subdued plumage.

The shape of the siskin&#x27;s beak is determined by its feeding habits. It is strong although it is also slender like tweezers, in order to reach between the scales of spruce cones and alder fruit for the seeds on which they feed. The legs and feet are dark brown and the eyes are black. 

It has a rapid and bounding flight pattern that is similar to other finches.

The siskin is easy to recognise, but in some instances it can be confused with other finches such as the citril finch, the European greenfinch or the European serin. The Eurasian siskin, in many plumages, is a bright bird. Adult male Eurasian siskins are bright green and yellow with a black cap, and an unstreaked throat and breast. Adult females also usually have green and yellow plumage tones: for example, yellow in the supercilium and on the sides of the breast, green tones in the mantle and yellow in the rump. The ground colour of the underparts of the Eurasian siskin is normally pure white. In females and juveniles, the centre of the belly and lower breast are often largely or entirely unstreaked. The wingbars of the Eurasian siskin are broad and yellow (with the tips white) and the bill is short with a decurved culmen.

==Distribution and habitat==

This species can be found across the greater part of Eurosiberia and the north of Africa. Its breeding area is separated into two zones, both on each side of the Palearctic realm: the eastern coast of Asia and the central and northern part of Europe.

These birds can be found throughout the year in Central Europe and some mountain ranges in the south of the continent. They are present in the north of Scandinavia and in Russia and they over-winter in the Mediterranean basin and the area around the Black Sea. In China they breed in the Khingan Mountains of Inner Mongolia and in Jiangsu province; they spend winter in Tibet, Taiwan, the valleys of the lower Yangtse River and the south east coast.

The Eurasian siskin is occasionally seen in North America. There is also a similar and closely related North America counterpart, the pine siskin (&quot;Spinus pinus&quot;).

Their seasonal distribution is also marked by the fact that they follow an anomalous migration pattern. Every few years they migrate southwards in larger numbers and the overwintering populations in the Iberian Peninsula are greatly augmented. This event has been the object of diverse theories, one theory suggests that it occurs in the years when Norway spruce produces abundant seeds in the centre and north of Europe, causing populations to increase. An alternative theory is that greater migration occurs when the preferred food of alder or birch seed fails. This species will form large flocks outside the breeding season, often mixed with redpolls.

It is a bird that does not remain for long in one area but which varies the areas it uses for breeding and feeding, over-wintering from one year to the next.

Its habitat is forested areas at a particular altitude on a mountain side and they have a certain predilection for humid areas. Coniferous woodland, especially spruce, is favoured for breeding. It builds its nest in a tree, laying 2–6 eggs. The British range of this once local breeder has expanded greatly due to an increase in commercial conifer plantations. The siskin also breeds in mixed woodland; while in winter they prefer stubble and crops and areas containing trees with seeds.

==Behaviour and ecology==
They are very active and restless birds. They are also very social, forming small cohesive flocks especially in autumn and winter. They are fairly trusting of humans, it being possible to observe them from a short distance. During the breeding season, however, they are much more timid, solitary and difficult to observe. For this reason there is a German legend which says that siskins guard a magic stone in their nests that makes them invisible. It is one of the few species which has been described as exhibiting &quot;allofeeding&quot;&#x27; behaviour, this is where subordinates (of the same sex) regurgitate food for the dominant members of the group, which creates a strong cohesion in the flocks and implies a hierarchical structure within the group.

===Feeding===

The siskin is mainly a granivore, although it varies its diet depending on the season. It primarily feeds in trees, avoiding eating on the ground.

The diet is based primarily on the seeds of both coniferous (especially spruce and larch, but also including species planted in gardens like Lawson&#x27;s cypress) and broadleaf trees such as birch and, above all, alder, concentrating on species with seeds 2-3 mm long. They also visit cultivated areas and pasture, where they join with other finches in eating the seeds of various Asteraceae such as thistles, dandelions, &quot;Artemisia&quot;, knapweeds and other herbaceous plants, such as St. John&#x27;s wort, meadowsweet and sorrel.

In spring, during the breeding season, they are found primarily in spruce forests. At this time their feeding is based on the seeds of these trees. They also feed on elm and poplar seeds. When feeding the young they eat more insects, mainly beetles, as the proteins they contain help the chicks to grow. In summer their feeding is more varied, adding other herbaceous plants to their diet of conifer seeds, including goosefoots and other Asteraceae.

===Reproduction===

Pairs are generally formed during the winter period before migration. The males compete aggressively for the females. As part of the courtship the male plumps up the feathers of the pileus and rump, making itself bigger, extending the tail and singing repeatedly. They also make mating flights from tree to tree, although they are not as eye-catching as the flights of the other finches. They construct a nest that is generally located at the end of a relatively high branch in a conifer (most often a spruce, but also fir, pine, and others) such that the nest is reasonably hidden and difficult to see. They form small colonies of up to six pairs with the nests located near to each other. The nest is small and bowl-shaped. It is made from small twigs, dried grasses, moss and lichen and lined with down.

The first brood is born in mid-April. The female lays between 2 and 6 eggs. The eggs are white or light grey or light blue, with small brown spots and they are approximately 16.5 mm by 12 mm in size. Incubation takes between 10 and 14 days and is carried out entirely by the female. The chicks are altricial and nidicolous. They leave the nest after 15 days in a semi-feathered condition. They then remain close to the nest area for up to a month when, with their plumage now complete, they disperse. The siskin usually has a second brood, from the middle of June up to the middle of July.

===Song and calls===
This bird has two calls, both powerful but conflicting, one is descending and the other is ascending, their onomatopoeic sounds can be represented as &quot;tilu&quot; and &quot;tluih&quot;. On occasions they also issue a harsh rattling chirrup.

The song is similar to the other finches, a smooth and rapid twitter and trill with a long duration and which is occasionally interrupted by a stronger or shorter syllable. Siskins sing throughout the year and often in groups.

==Status and conservation==
The worldwide population of the siskin is estimated as between 20 and 36 million. The European population is estimated as between 2.7 and 15 million pairs. There does not seem to be a major decline in population numbers and for this reason the IUCN has listed their conservation status as least concern. The siskin appears in Annex II of the Berne Convention as a protected bird species.

==Relationship with humans==

Like many of the finches, the siskin is valued by aviculturalists as a domestic bird for its song and appearance. They do not require specific care and adapt well to captivity, although they do not breed well in captivity. There are no specific diseases that affect the species, although they can show certain intestinal pathologies associated with a poor diet. They live for between 11 and 14 years, in sharp contrast to the 2 or 3 years it is estimated they live in the wild.

In captivity, they can produce hybrids with some other finches (for example, canaries) giving rise to intermediate birds. Hybridisation also occurs in nature without human intervention. In some areas, individuals that are found are the result of escapes or releases of captive birds.

===Cultural depictions===
Poland, Gibraltar, Benin and Belgium have all issued postage stamps bearing the image of the siskin.

In Saint Petersburg there is a statue of a siskin, as its colours are the same as the uniform worn by the students at an elite school in the city. These students have come to be known by the sobriquet &quot;siskin&quot;, . This term was popularised in the Russian song &quot;Chizhik-Pyzhik&quot;. There has been a statue of a siskin on the embankment by the First Engineer Bridge since 1994, though it has been stolen and replaced multiple times.

There is a Czech folk song/dance/game &quot;Čížečku, čížečku&quot;, in which the siskin is the source of the lore on what happens with the poppy.

Elif Shafak, in the novel &quot;Three Daughters of Eve&quot;, mentioned a siskin in a pivotal scene in which the heroine, Peri, meets the charismatic and controversial Professor Azur. When Peri entered Professor Azur&#x27;s office, she found a siskin with yellow-green feathers and a forked tail trapped amid the shelves and stacks of books.

<text>The Lebanese National Anthem (, ), officially known by its opening words &quot;&quot; (English: All for the country, for glory, and the flag), was written by Rashid Nakhle and composed by Wadih Sabra. It was adopted on 12 July 1927, seven years after the proclamation of the state of Greater Lebanon during the French mandate.

==History==

=== Origins === 

At the beginning of the 20th century, some poets composed hymns that praised the glories of Lebanon, its nature, and its cedars. These hymns were performed by the band of the Mutasarrifate of Mount Lebanon in locations such as the square of the Serail of Baabda, Manshieh, Deir el Qamar, and the garden of Rüstem Pasha in Beirut. Their purpose was to revive national sentiment in a country stifled by 400 years of occupation. These hymns were mainly intended to inspire troops, schoolchildren, policemen, and scouts, with themes centered on the Cedar of Lebanon, homeland, and Phoenicia.

The historian Joseph Nemaa mentions in the third volume of his book &quot;Pages du Liban&quot; that he heard Lebanese and Syrian volunteers in the Allied armies, who had entered Mount Lebanon, chanting a rallying hymn.

==== The First National Anthem ==== 

On the day of the proclamation of the State of Greater Lebanon by Henri Gouraud (general) in September 1920, Father Maroun Ghosn composed a hymn that was performed at the beginning and end of the celebration. The music was initially composed by Bechara Farzan, then Paul Ashqar gave it another melody.

Titled &quot;Lebanon, Fear Not Adversity&quot; (in Arabic: لبنان لا تخشَ العدا). It has since become part of the musical repertoire of the Lebanese Army under the title: &quot;Hymn of Salutation to the Cedars&quot;.

Among the anthems of this period, there was also one composed by the &quot;poet of the cedars,&quot; Chebli Mallat, or Youssef al-Sawda. In this atmosphere, the deputy Sheikh Ibrahim al-Moundhir urged the Parliament to draft an official national anthem, following the example of independent nations.&quot;The influence of national songs on the soul is undeniable. There is no advanced nation in the world, nor any nation aspiring to be one, that does not have a national anthem—one that its children, young and old, know by heart and sing during national events and in every literary gathering.&quot;

=== The Modern National Anthem === 

A first attempt was made in 1925 by the French governor of Greater Lebanon at the time, Léon Cayla, to launch a competition under the supervision of a jury that included, among others, Georges Corm, Henri Pharaon, Wadih Sabra, and Ahmad Fleifel. However, inspiration did not strike the poets, or at least no melody or lyrics managed to convince the jury.

The following year, in May 1926, the Lebanese Republic was proclaimed, and Charles Debbas was elected president. The first government under the new president sought to create a Lebanese national anthem and formed a committee to arbitrate between competing poets in Lebanon and the Lebanese diaspora to select the anthem.

On July 19, 1926, a decree titled &quot;Competition for the Selection of the Lebanese National Anthem&quot; was published in the official gazette. Article 1 of this decree stated that the competition was divided into two sections: &quot;A competition to choose an Arabic poem whose lyrics are suitable for the Lebanese anthem&quot; and another competition among composers to select the melody for the chosen poem. Article 2 stipulated that the arbitration committee, chaired by the eminent linguist Sheikh Abdallah Boustany and the Minister of Public Education and Fine Arts, Najib Amouni, along with members including Ibrahim el Mounzer, Jamil Bey al-Azm, Abdel-Rahim Kleilat, Wadih Akl, Ibrahim al-Moundhir, Chibli Bey Malat, Andel Basset Fathallah, and Élias Fayad, was given the significant task of selecting a national anthem for the newly proclaimed Republic.

By the end of October 1926, the competition results were announced, and the winning anthem was the one composed by poet Rachid Nakhle. Driven by a deep desire to best serve his country and to silence those who believed that uniting all Lebanese factions under one refrain was impossible, he wrote a poem in one sitting in his hometown of Barouk. However, to avoid leveraging his fame, he signed the text with a pseudonym, Maabad.

It is said that Béchara el-Khoury, then Minister of the Interior, asked him to remove a stanza referencing the unity of the cross and the crescent, and that the 1,000 livres he won were donated to charity. After the lyrics of the national anthem were chosen, the final version was published in Lebanese newspapers so that composers could compete to set it to music.

On July 12, 1927, Decree 1855 was issued, stipulating in its first article that &quot;the melody composed by Professor Wadih Sabra, director of the Lebanese National Higher Conservatory of Music, is considered the official melody of the Lebanese national anthem.&quot; The anthem was officially adopted by decree on July 12, 1927. The anthem was retained upon independence in 1943.

Among the texts not selected by the jury was one by Abdel-Halim Hajjar, which was noted by the jury but later withdrawn by the author, and another by Chebli Mallat. The latter had a feminist touch, as it began with the lines: &quot;Daughters of the Cedars / Sing for us / The symbols of our proud cedars...&quot; This line was recently reintroduced in Carole Sakr&#x27;s rendition: &quot;Lebanon, land of women and men.&quot;

The anthem was first performed on May 30, 1927, at the club of the Maronite Sagesse School during a play, in the presence of the president of the Republic, several deputies, ministers, and notable figures.

In 2018, on the occasion of the 91st anniversary of the Lebanese anthem, a proposal was made to designate a national holiday in its honor.

=== Controversy Over the Rif Anthem === 

Rasha Al Karam of Al Jadeed TV released a controversial mini-documentary in 2011 about the Lebanese national anthem, claiming that the tune and lyrics were actually plagiarized from the &quot;Anthem of the Rif,&quot; a song written for Abdelkrim el-Khattabi and composed by Lebanese composer Mohammed Fleifel in 1924. This anthem was allegedly adopted as an official hymn one year before the Lebanese national anthem appeared.

Despite the efforts of artist Ghassan Rahbani, who claimed to have discovered the plagiarism to highlight the seriousness of the matter and called for changing the anthem, the attempt to turn the anthem scandal into a public issue ultimately failed.

According to Al Jadeed, in the winter of 1924, while Arab newspapers were in a frenzy over the Arab victories against the Spanish and French armies, Ibrahim Touqan, Abdelrahim Qleilat, and Mohammed Fleifel gathered at Café du Carillon (now Café du Théâtre Farouk), where Touqan came up with the idea of composing an anthem for the revolt and the liberation of Arab peoples. The song was composed by Fleifel. However, Fleifel never acknowledged any collaboration with Touqan before 1936.

According to Lebanese historian Charles Hayek, the Republic of the Rif never had an official anthem. He argues that the confusion stems from a Moroccan documentary published in 1959, which used the melody of the Lebanese anthem.

The only evidence of plagiarism is a segment from a documentary about Moroccan politician Mahdi Ben Barka, in which the melody of the Lebanese national anthem is played over footage of King Mohammed V, but with different lyrics. Additionally, the book *Deux poètes contemporains* by Omar Farroukh concludes that Mohammed Fleifel sold the melody of the &quot;Anthem of the Hero of the Rif&quot; to Wadia Sabra. However, while the &quot;Anthem of the Rif&quot; was indeed composed by the Fleifel brothers, its melody differed from that of the national anthem composed by Sabra.

According to Professor Joumana Mrad, the &quot;Anthem of the Rif&quot; was highly popular at the time, making it difficult to steal or plagiarize for resale. This suggests that the claim that the Rif melody was sold is a false accusation.

In an interview with Kadimokom, music arranger Nemer Habib revealed that, based on his research, when the Lebanese government decided to organize a competition for the national anthem, the jury committee asked the Fleifel brothers to select the appropriate poetic meter. They chose the meter of &quot;The Hero of the Rif&quot; so that poets could compose the Lebanese national anthem using its structure and poetic form.

=== Composition === 

The music of the national anthem was influenced by Beirut&#x27;s exposure to Western culture at the end of the 19thth century century. It was composed in 1925 by Wadia Sabra, an artist trained in France.

<text>A dragon curve is any member of a family of self-similar fractal curves, which can be approximated by recursive methods such as Lindenmayer systems. The dragon curve is probably most commonly thought of as the shape that is generated from repeatedly folding a strip of paper in half, although there are other curves that are called dragon curves that are generated differently.

== Heighway dragon ==
The Heighway dragon (also known as the Harter–Heighway dragon or the Jurassic Park dragon) was first investigated by NASA physicists John Heighway, Bruce Banks, and William Harter. It was described by Martin Gardner in his Scientific American column &quot;Mathematical Games&quot; in 1967. Many of its properties were first published by Chandler Davis and Donald Knuth. It appeared on the section title pages of the Michael Crichton novel &quot;Jurassic Park&quot;.

=== Construction ===
The Heighway dragon can be constructed from a base line segment by repeatedly replacing each segment by two segments with a right angle and with a rotation of 45° alternatively to the right and to the left:
The Heighway dragon is also the limit set of the following iterated function system in the complex plane:

:formula_1
:formula_2

with the initial set of points formula_3.

Using pairs of real numbers instead, this is the same as the two functions consisting of

:formula_4

:formula_5

=== Folding the dragon ===
The Heighway dragon curve can be constructed by folding a strip of paper, which is how it was originally discovered. Take a strip of paper and fold it in half to the right. Fold it in half again to the right. If the strip was opened out now, unbending each fold to become a 90-degree turn, the turn sequence would be RRL, i.e. the second iteration of the Heighway dragon. Fold the strip in half again to the right, and the turn sequence of the unfolded strip is now RRLRRLL – the third iteration of the Heighway dragon. Continuing folding the strip in half to the right to create further iterations of the Heighway dragon (in practice, the strip becomes too thick to fold sharply after four or five iterations).

The folding patterns of this sequence of paper strips, as sequences of right (R) and left (L) folds, are:
* 1st iteration: R
* 2nd iteration: R R L
* 3rd iteration: R R L R R L L
* 4th iteration: R R L R R L L R R R L L R L L.
Each iteration can be found by copying the previous iteration, then an R, then a second copy of the previous iteration in reverse order with the L and R letters swapped.

=== Properties ===
* Many self-similarities can be seen in the Heighway dragon curve. The most obvious is the repetition of the same pattern tilted by 45° and with a reduction ratio of formula_6. Based on these self-similarities, many of its lengths are simple rational numbers.
* The dragon curve can tile the plane. One possible tiling replaces each edge of a square tiling with a dragon curve, using the recursive definition of the dragon starting from a line segment. The initial direction to expand each segment can be determined from a checkerboard coloring of a square tiling, expanding vertical segments into black tiles and out of white tiles, and expanding horizontal segments into white tiles and out of black ones.
* As a space-filling curve, the dragon curve has fractal dimension exactly 2. For a dragon curve with initial segment length 1, its area is 1/2, as can be seen from its tilings of the plane.
* The boundary of the set covered by the dragon curve has infinite length, with fractal dimension formula_7 where formula_8 is the real solution of the equation formula_9

== Twindragon ==

The twindragon (also known as the Davis–Knuth dragon) can be constructed by placing two Heighway dragon curves back to back (after flipping the original dragon curve vertically and horizontally). It is also the limit set of the following iterated function system:

:formula_1
:formula_11

where the initial shape is defined by the following set formula_12.

It can be also written as a Lindenmayer system – it only needs adding another section in the initial string:
* angle 90°
* initial string &quot;FX+FX+&quot;
* string rewriting rules
** &quot;X&quot; &quot;X&quot;+&quot;YF&quot;
** &quot;Y&quot; &quot;FX&quot;−&quot;Y&quot;.
It is also the locus of points in the complex plane with the same integer part when written in base formula_13.

== Terdragon ==
The terdragon can be written as a Lindenmayer system:
* angle 120°
* initial string &quot;F&quot;
* string rewriting rules
** &quot;F&quot; &quot;F+F−F&quot;.

It is the limit set of the following iterated function system:

:formula_14
:formula_15
:formula_16
:formula_17

== Lévy dragon ==
The Lévy C curve is sometimes known as the Lévy dragon.

== Occurrences of the dragon curve in solution sets ==
Having obtained the set of solutions to a linear differential equation, any linear combination of the solutions will, because of the superposition principle, also obey the original equation. In other words, new solutions are obtained by applying a function to the set of existing solutions. This is similar to how an iterated function system produces new points in a set, though not all IFS are linear functions.
In a conceptually similar vein, a set of Littlewood polynomials can be arrived at by such iterated applications of a set of functions.

A Littlewood polynomial is a polynomial: formula_18 where all formula_19.

For some formula_20 we define the following functions:
:formula_21
:formula_22

Starting at z=0 we can generate all Littlewood polynomials of degree d using these functions iteratively d+1 times. For instance: formula_23

It can be seen that for formula_24, the above pair of functions is equivalent to the IFS formulation of the Heighway dragon. That is, the Heighway dragon, iterated to a certain iteration, describe the set of all Littlewood polynomials up to a certain degree, evaluated at the point formula_24.
Indeed, when plotting a sufficiently high number of roots of the Littlewood polynomials, structures similar to the dragon curve appear at points close to these coordinates.

<doc id="367071" wikidata="Q1143180" url="?curid=367071" title="Scottish crossbill">
<text>The Scottish crossbill (Loxia scotica) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. It is endemic to the Caledonian Forests of Scotland, and is the only terrestrial vertebrate species endemic to the United Kingdom. The Scottish crossbill was confirmed as a unique species in August 2006, on the basis of having a distinctive bird song.

The genus name &quot;Loxia&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;loxos&quot;, &#x27;crosswise&#x27;, and &quot;scotica&quot; is Latin for &#x27;Scottish&#x27;. The Scottish Gaelic name for a crossbill is &quot;Cam-ghob&quot;, which means &#x27;crooked beak&#x27;.&quot;&quot;

==History and current status==
The British Ornithologists Union first classed the Scottish crossbill as a separate and distinct species in 1980, but some ornithologists believed there was insufficient scientific research for its status. It was considered to be possibly a race of either the red crossbill or the parrot crossbill, both of which also occur in the Caledonian Forest.

RSPB research showed that Scottish crossbills have quite distinct flight and excitement calls from other crossbills – some even stated they have &quot;Scottish accents&quot;.

Research in Scotland has shown that red, parrot and Scottish crossbills are reproductively isolated, and the diagnostic calls and bill dimensions have not been lost. They are therefore good species.

The population is thought to be approximately 20,000 birds. It nests in pines or other conifers, laying 2-5 eggs.

The Scottish crossbill breeds in the native Scots pine (&quot;Pinus sylvestris&quot;), Caledonian forests of the Scottish Highlands, but often also in forestry plantations of exotic conifers, notably Larch (&quot;Larix decidua&quot; and &quot;L. kaempferi&quot;) and Lodgepole pine (&quot;Pinus contorta&quot;).

This species of crossbill is resident, and is not known to migrate. It will form flocks outside the breeding season, often mixed with other crossbills.

The crossbills are characterised by the mandibles crossing at their tips, which gives the group its English name. They are specialist feeders on conifer cones, and the unusual bill shape is an adaptation to assist the extraction of the seeds from the cone. The Scottish crossbill appears to be a specialist feeder on the cones of pines (Scots pine and Lodgepole pine) and larch.

Adult males tend to be red or orange in colour, and females green or yellow, but there is much variation.

The Scottish crossbill is extremely difficult to separate from the red and parrot, and plumage distinctions are negligible. The head and bill size is intermediate between and overlapping extensively with the other two, and extreme care is needed to identify this species. The metallic &quot;jip&quot; call is probably the best indicator, but even this needs to be recorded and analysed on a sonogram to confirm the identity.

===Bill structure===

According to a lengthy scientific study by the RSPB, &#x27;Celtic&#x27; crossbills differ in bill size from other crossbill species found in Great Britain, and they have also been found to have a distinct Scottish accent or call, thought to be the method used by the birds to make sure that, especially given the physical similarities with other crossbills, they only attract and pair with potential mates of the same species.

The most important evidence to come from the RSPB&#x27;s long term study in the Highlands focused on discovering if the birds mate with those with a similar bill size and call, and whether young Scottish crossbills inherit their bill sizes from their parents.

Results showed that, of over 40 pairs of different types of crossbills caught, almost all matched closely for bill size and calls, so the different types of crossbills were behaving as distinct species.

===Calls===

The calls can be distinguished by sonograms. This provides the basis for a method to survey crossbills and, for the first time, gain a clear picture of their numbers and distribution in Scotland and help in any conservation programmes for the race.

===Conservation===
The first survey of Scottish crossbills was in 2008.

Despite lacking data for population trends, British Birds places the crossbill on their Amber list for conservation concern on the basis of it being an endemic species and therefore of &#x27;international importance&#x27;. A 2017 report by the British Trust for Ornithology identified the crossbill as being at high risk of extinction.

Breeding populations exist at Corrimony Nature Reserve, and Loch Garten Nature Reserve, one of the United Kingdom&#x27;s most protected nature sites.

One of the main threats to the crossbill&#x27;s habitat is wood and pulp plantations, plus underplanting conifers and grazing pressure.

The main active conservation initiative is the implementation of the EU Biodiversity Action Plan, which seeks to protect the numerous species of birds throughout the EU. Further studies are needed to establish the species of trees Scottish crossbills are best adapted to, as well as population trends. It has also been suggested to prevent any further loss of habitat, and further restrict red deer grazing.

<doc id="367074" wikidata="Q948920" url="?curid=367074" title="Patrick J. Kennedy">
<text>Patrick Joseph Kennedy II (born July 14, 1967) is an American retired politician and mental health advocate. From 1995 to 2011, he served as a Democratic member of the United States House of Representatives from Rhode Island&#x27;s 1st congressional district, and was the first Generation X member of congress when he took office in 1995. He is a former member of the Opioid and Drug Abuse Commission and a co-founder of One Mind, a mental health nonprofit.

Born and raised in Boston, he is the youngest child and second son of the long-time Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy, and is a nephew of former U.S. President John F. Kennedy and former U.S. Senator Robert F. Kennedy. Kennedy graduated from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts, and graduated with a Bachelor of Science degree from Providence College. He was elected to the Rhode Island House of Representatives in 1989, becoming the youngest member of the Kennedy family to hold elected office. He was then elected to represent Rhode Island&#x27;s 1st congressional district. He was re-elected, serving from January 3, 1995, to January 3, 2011 (the 104th to 111th Congresses). In the House, Kennedy served on the Armed Services and Natural Resources Committees before being appointed to the Appropriations Committee.

At the time of his father&#x27;s death in late August 2009, Patrick was the last remaining member of the Kennedy family to serve in an elective office in Washington. After he chose not to seek re-election in 2010 and left office the following year, it was the first time that no member of the Kennedy family held elected office since 1947. The Kennedys&#x27; absence in politics was temporary, however, and following the next mid-term election, Joe Kennedy III would be elected to Congress and Caroline Kennedy would be appointed to an ambassadorship.

==Early life and education==

Kennedy was born in the Brighton section of Boston, Massachusetts. He is the youngest of three children born to Senator Edward Moore &quot;Ted&quot; Kennedy (1932–2009) (brother of John F. Kennedy) and musician/socialite/former model Virginia Joan Kennedy, &quot;née&quot; Bennett (born 1936). His sister Kara (1960–2011) was a television and film producer, while his brother, Ted, Jr. (born 1961), is a lawyer and former member of the Connecticut State Senate. Patrick was named after his paternal great-grandfather, businessman and politician Patrick Joseph Kennedy (1858–1929).

Kennedy graduated in 1986 from Phillips Academy in Andover, Massachusetts. He received a Bachelor of Science degree from Providence College in 1991.

==Rhode Island House of Representatives==

While a junior at Providence College, Kennedy defeated five-term incumbent John F. Skeffington, Jr., for the Democratic nomination in District 9. In 1988, Kennedy became the youngest member of the Kennedy family to hold elected office, when he won election to the Rhode Island House of Representatives at age 21. He served two terms in the House representing District 9 in Providence. He chose not to run for a third term and was succeeded by Anastasia P. Williams.

==U.S. House of Representatives==

In 1994, Kennedy was elected as a Democrat to represent Rhode Island&#x27;s 1st congressional district in the U.S. House of Representatives. He was re-elected seven times, serving from January 3, 1995, to January 3, 2011 (the 104th to 111th Congresses).

Kennedy was lead sponsor of the Mental Health Parity and Addiction Equity Act, which passed on October 3, 2008.

Kennedy authored and co-sponsored the Positive Aging Act, the Foundations for Learning Act, which established a grant program to improve mental and emotional health for school children through screening and early intervention, the National Neurotechnology Initiative Act, Genomics and Personalized Medicine Act; the COMBAT PTSD Act; the Nurse-Family Partnership Act, the Alzheimer&#x27;s Treatment and Caregiver Support Act, and the Ready, Willing, and Able Act.

Kennedy was among the founders of the Congressional Down Syndrome Caucus and the 21st Century Healthcare Caucus and served as vice chairman of the Native American Caucus. He also joined the Congressional Boating Caucus; the Caucus on Armenian Issues; the Caucus on Hellenic Issues; the Fire Services Caucus; the Human Rights Caucus; the Travel and Tourism Caucus; the National Guard and Reserve Components Caucus; the Portuguese American Caucus (co-chair); and the Older American Caucus. He was a founder of the Rhode Island Chapter of the National Committee for Prevention of Child Abuse and chaired the Democratic Congressional Campaign Committee for two years (1999-2001). During his tenure as DCCC chairman, Kennedy became a headliner at Democratic political events and fundraisers around the country.

===Committee assignments===
*U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies
*U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies
*U.S. House Appropriations Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies
*U.S. House of Representatives Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies

==Political campaigns==
Kennedy campaigned for the seat being vacated by U.S. Representative Ronald Machtley (who was retiring) in the 1994 Rhode Island 1st congressional district election. He won the election, defeating Republican candidate Kevin Vigilante. Kennedy was one of four Democrats in the 1994 congressional elections to win a congressional seat that had previously been held by a Republican, while Republicans gained dozens of seats to take over the U.S. House. He was re-elected every two years from 1996 until 2008 and did not run for re-election in 2010.

In 2000, Kennedy considered running against Republican Lincoln Chafee in the U.S. Senate election in Rhode Island, but instead chose to run for re-election. Kennedy had recently won appointment to the House Appropriations Committee, a high-profile assignment that caused him to pass up the Senate race. He again considered running against Chafee in 2006, but instead chose to run for re-election.

Kennedy did not run for re-election in 2010 and completed his final term in January 2011. He finished his 8th term at the completion of the 111th United States Congress.

==Post-congress advocacy==
Since leaving Congress, Kennedy has written and spoken publicly about his long struggle with bipolar disorder and drug addiction and become a leading advocate for a stronger mental health care system in the United States.

Partnering with Shari and Garen Staglin in 2011, Kennedy launched One Mind (formerly One Mind for Research) with the intention of promoting the study of brain diseases. One Mind supports better diagnostics and new therapies to advance neuroscience discovery and fills the gaps in research funding by disseminating donor-supported funds.

Kennedy founded The Kennedy Forum in 2013, a behavioral health nonprofit, of which he is CEO, with the mission of leading the national dialogue on transforming mental health and addiction care delivery by uniting mental health advocates, business leaders, and government agencies around a common set of principles, including full implementation of the Federal Parity Law. In 2018, &quot;Politico&quot; termed Kennedy &quot;the unlikely go-to player for companies seeking to benefit from the Trump administration’s multibillion-dollar response to the opioid crisis&quot;. Kennedy sits on the boards of eight corporations involved with the government&#x27;s response to the drug crisis. He &quot;holds an equity stake in the firms&quot; and &quot;collects director fees&quot; from the latter organizations, many of which &quot;stand to benefit from fresh efforts in Congress and the Trump administration to combat the opioid crisis&quot;. As such, Kennedy lobbied &quot;former congressional colleagues to advocate for higher levels of spending&quot;.

In 2015, he co-authored &quot;A Common Struggle: A Personal Journey Through the Past and Future of Mental Illness and Addiction&quot; detailing his journey through mental illness, addiction, and his ongoing political advocacy for federal legislation in support of mental health and addiction health care.

In 2016, Kennedy founded Advocates for Opioid Recovery together with former House Speaker Newt Gingrich and Van Jones, a former domestic policy adviser to President Barack Obama.

He is also co-founder of Smart Approaches to Marijuana, established in 2013 with Kevin Sabet and David Frum, an anti-legalization group. Speaking in the context of California&#x27;s Proposition 64, Kennedy argued the legalization movement was &quot;putting our children at risk&quot; and &quot;exposed children from communities of color to more racial discrimination than before.&quot;

==Political positions==

===Healthcare===
Kennedy is a vocal advocate for health care reform. During his tenure in Congress, he joined with U.S. Senator Pete Domenici (R–NM) in introducing legislation that places mental illness under the umbrella of health insurance.

He was a chief sponsor of one of the major pieces of legislation of 2008, the Mental Health Parity Act, a bill requiring most group health plans to provide coverage for the treatment of mental illnesses which is no less restrictive than coverage provided for physical illnesses.

He was a strong proponent of adding a comprehensive prescription-drug benefit to the U.S. Medicare and consistently opposed attempts to privatize the Medicare program. Kennedy also made numerous speeches advocating the re-orientation of the U.S. health-care system to preventive care. He has received numerous awards for his health care advocacy, including the Lymphoma Research Foundation&#x27;s Paul E. Tsongas Memorial Award as well as the Leukemia &amp; Lymphoma Society Congressional Honors Award. He also received the Society for Neuroscience — Public Service Award (2002), Eli Lilly and Company 2003 Helping Move Lives Forward Reintegration Award, American Psychoanalytic Association 2003 President&#x27;s Award, American Psychiatric Association Alliance award (2003), and the Depression and Bipolar Support Alliance — Paul Wellstone Mental Health Award (2003).

He has also been awarded the National Recovery Champion Award, the American Foundation for Suicide Prevention Humanitarian Award, the American Psychiatric Association Patient Advocacy Award, the New York Academy of Science Breaking the Chains of Stigma Award, the Society for Neuroscience Public Service Award, the American College of Neuropsychopharmacology Distinguished Service Award, the Clifford Beers Foundation Centennial Award, the Autism Society of America Congressional Leadership Award, the Epilepsy Foundation Public Service Award, and the NAMI Humanitarian of the Year Award.

In a March 7, 2008, speech to the Cleveland City Club, Kennedy acknowledged having bipolar disorder and being a recovering alcoholic. He and his siblings have legal custody of their mother, who has long struggled with alcoholism.

Kennedy served on the Office of National Drug Control Policy&#x27;s President&#x27;s Commission on Combating Drug Addiction and the Opioid Crisis in 2017.

===Iraq War===
Kennedy was on the opposite side of the Iraq war debate as his father. He joined with 80 House Democrats in voting for the Authorization for Use of Military Force Against Iraq Resolution of 2002 (the minority view among House Democrats), whereas his father in the Senate joined anti-war Democrats in voting against the bill, which was a minority position among Senate Democrats.

===2008 presidential election===
On January 28, 2008, Kennedy joined his father in endorsing Barack Obama in the 2008 U.S. presidential election, stating that Obama was the &quot;perfect antidote to George Bush&quot;. Prior to that, Kennedy had joined his first cousin Timothy Shriver in endorsing U.S. Senator Christopher Dodd from Connecticut.

==Personal issues and incidents==

===Use of alcohol and other drugs===
Kennedy acknowledged having a drug habit as a teenager and was treated at a rehabilitation center in 1986 and received counseling. He sought treatment for an OxyContin addiction in 2006. Due to his experience with addiction, Kennedy advocates against the legalization of recreational marijuana, but supports it for medical use.

===Capitol Hill intoxicated-driving accident===
On May 4, 2006, Kennedy crashed his automobile into a barricade on Capitol Hill in Washington, D.C., at 2:45 a.m. A United States Capitol Police official said the congressman had appeared intoxicated when he crashed his car. According to Kennedy, he was disoriented from the prescription medications Ambien and Phenergan. Anonymous sources are alleged to have seen Kennedy drinking at the nearby Hawk &amp; Dove bar prior to the accident. Kennedy also stated to officers that he was &quot;late for a vote&quot;. However, the last vote of the night had occurred almost six hours earlier. The standard field sobriety test was not administered, and Kennedy was driven home by an officer.

The next day, Kennedy admitted publicly that he had an addiction to prescription medication and announced he would be readmitting himself to a drug-rehabilitation facility at the Mayo Clinic in Minnesota where he had sought treatment for prior addictions. He has stated that he has no recollection of the car crash. A few days later, Kennedy received a show of support when he was endorsed by the Rhode Island Democratic Party. A month after the incident, Kennedy was released from drug rehabilitation.

On June 13, 2006, Kennedy made a deal with prosecutors and pleaded guilty to a charge of driving under the influence of prescription drugs. He was sentenced to one-year probation and a fine of $350. Two of the three charges (reckless driving and failure to exhibit a driving permit) were dismissed. He was also ordered to attend a rehabilitation program that includes weekly urine tests, twice-weekly meetings with a probation officer, near-daily Alcoholics Anonymous meetings and a weekly meeting of recovering addicts.

On June 12, 2009, Kennedy announced that he had again entered rehab, for an indefinite time at an undisclosed facility. In a statement to the press, Kennedy said that his recovery is a &quot;life-long process&quot; and that he would do whatever it takes to preserve his health: &quot;I have decided to temporarily step away from my normal routine to ensure that I am being as vigilant as possible in my recovery&quot;, Kennedy said.

As of 2018, Kennedy says that he has been sober for more than six years.

==Personal life and family==
His father, Massachusetts Senator Ted Kennedy, died on August 25, 2009. Patrick made a tearful eulogy at the funeral, saying that, &quot;He [Ted] would be very proud to see you all out here today paying a final respect and tribute to his memory&quot;. He further elaborated on his experiences with his father as a child, saying his father would stay at his bedside during his frequent bouts of ill health.

Kennedy decided not to run for re-election in 2010, saying his life &quot;has taken a new direction&quot;. Mark Weiner, a major Democratic party fund-raiser in Rhode Island and one of Kennedy&#x27;s top financial backers, said: &quot;It&#x27;s tough to get up and go to work every day when your partner is not there. I think he just had a broken heart after his father passed away.&quot;

As of 2014, Kennedy resides in Brigantine, New Jersey. In March 2011, he announced his engagement to eighth-grade history teacher Amy Savell. The couple married on July 15, 2011, in Hyannis Port, Massachusetts. They have two sons and two daughters.

In January 2020, Amy Kennedy announced her candidacy for the Democratic nomination for United States Congress, to represent New Jersey&#x27;s 2nd congressional district. Amy Kennedy defeated Brigid Callahan Harrison in the Democratic primary in July, and faced Democrat-turned-Republican incumbent Jeff Van Drew in the November general election. She was ultimately defeated by Van Drew.

<doc id="367077" wikidata="Q412199" url="?curid=367077" title="Alu element">
<text>An Alu element is a short stretch of DNA originally characterized by the action of the &quot;Arthrobacter luteus (Alu)&quot; restriction endonuclease. &quot;Alu&quot; elements are the most abundant transposable elements in the human genome, present in excess of one million copies. &quot;Alu&quot; elements were thought to be selfish or parasitic DNA, because their sole known function is self reproduction. However, they are likely to play a role in evolution and have been used as genetic markers. They are derived from the small cytoplasmic 7SL RNA, a component of the signal recognition particle. &quot;Alu&quot; elements are highly conserved within primate genomes and originated in the genome of an ancestor of Supraprimates.

&quot;Alu&quot; insertions have been implicated in several inherited human diseases and in various forms of cancer.

The study of Alu elements has also been important in elucidating human population genetics and the evolution of primates, including the evolution of humans.

== Alu family ==
The Alu family is a family of repetitive elements in primate genomes, including the human genome. Modern &quot;Alu&quot; elements are about 300 base pairs long and are therefore classified as short interspersed nuclear elements (SINEs) among the class of repetitive RNA elements. The typical structure is 5&#x27; - Part A - A5TACA6 - Part B - PolyA Tail - 3&#x27;, where Part A and Part B (also known as &quot;left arm&quot; and &quot;right arm&quot;) are similar nucleotide sequences. Expressed another way, it is believed modern &quot;Alu&quot; elements emerged from a head to tail fusion of two distinct FAMs (fossil antique monomers) over 100 million years ago, hence its dimeric structure of two similar, but distinct monomers (left and right arms) joined by an A-rich linker. Both monomers are thought to have evolved from 7SL, also known as SRP RNA. The length of the polyA tail varies between &quot;Alu&quot; families.

There are over one million &quot;Alu&quot; elements interspersed throughout the human genome, and it is estimated that about 10.7% of the human genome consists of &quot;Alu&quot; sequences. However, less than 0.5% are polymorphic (i.e., occurring in more than one form or morph). In 1988, Jerzy Jurka and Temple Smith discovered that &quot;Alu&quot; elements were split in two major subfamilies known as AluJ (named after Jurka) and AluS (named after Smith), and other Alu subfamilies were also independently discovered by several groups. Later on, a sub-subfamily of AluS which included active Alu elements was given the separate name AluY. Dating back 65 million years, the AluJ lineage is the oldest and least active in the human genome. The younger AluS lineage is about 30 million years old and still contains some active elements. Finally, the AluY elements are the youngest of the three and have the greatest disposition to move along the human genome. The discovery of &quot;Alu&quot; subfamilies led to the hypothesis of master/source genes, and provided the definitive link between transposable elements (active elements) and interspersed repetitive DNA (mutated copies of active elements).

=== Related elements ===
B1 elements in rats and mice are similar to Alus in that they also evolved from 7SL RNA, but they only have one left monomer arm. 95% percent of human Alus are also found in chimpanzees, and 50% of B elements in mice are also found in rats. These elements are mostly found in introns and upstream regulatory elements of genes.

The ancestral form of Alu and B1 is the fossil Alu monomer (FAM). Free-floating forms of the left and right arms exist, termed free left Alu monomers (FLAMs) and free right Alu monomers (FRAMs) respectively. A notable FLAM in primates is the BC200 lncRNA.

==Sequence features==
Two main promoter &quot;boxes&quot; are found in Alu: a 5&#x27; A box with the consensus , and a 3&#x27; B box with the consensus (IUPAC nucleic acid notation). tRNAs, which are transcribed by RNA polymerase III, have a similar but stronger promoter structure. Both boxes are located in the left arm.

Alu elements contain four or fewer Retinoic Acid response element hexamer sites in its internal promoter, with the last one overlapping with the &quot;B box&quot;. In this 7SL (SRP) RNA example below, functional hexamers are underlined using a solid line, with the non-functional third hexamer denoted using a dotted line:

The recognition sequence of the &quot;Alu I&quot; endonuclease is 5&#x27; ag/ct 3&#x27;; that is, the enzyme cuts the DNA segment between the guanine and cytosine residues (in lowercase above).

==Alu elements==

&quot;Alu&quot; elements are responsible for regulation of tissue-specific genes. They are also involved in the transcription of nearby genes and can sometimes change the way a gene is expressed.

&quot;Alu&quot; elements are retrotransposons and look like DNA copies made from RNA polymerase III-encoded RNAs. &quot;Alu&quot; elements do not encode for protein products. They are replicated as any other DNA sequence, but depend on LINE retrotransposons for generation of new elements.

&quot;Alu&quot; element replication and mobilization begins by interactions with signal recognition particles (SRPs), which aid newly translated proteins to reach their final destinations. &quot;Alu&quot; RNA forms a specific RNA:protein complex with a protein heterodimer consisting of SRP9 and SRP14. SRP9/14 facilitates &quot;Alu&quot;&#x27;s attachment to ribosomes that capture nascent L1 proteins. Thus, an &quot;Alu&quot; element can take control of the L1 protein&#x27;s reverse transcriptase, ensuring that the &quot;Alu&quot;&#x27;s RNA sequence gets copied into the genome rather than the L1&#x27;s mRNA.

&quot;Alu&quot; elements in primates form a fossil record that is relatively easy to decipher because &quot;Alu&quot; element insertion events have a characteristic signature that is both easy to read and faithfully recorded in the genome from generation to generation. The study of &quot;Alu Y&quot; elements (the more recently evolved) thus reveals details of ancestry because individuals will most likely only share a particular &quot;Alu&quot; element insertion if they have a common ancestor. This is because insertion of an Alu element occurs only 100 - 200 times per million years, and no known mechanism of deletion of one has been found. Therefore, individuals with an element likely descended from an ancestor with one—and vice versa, for those without. In genetics, the presence or lack thereof of a recently inserted &quot;Alu&quot; element may be a good property to consider when studying human evolution. Most human &quot;Alu&quot; element insertions can be found in the corresponding positions in the genomes of other primates, but about 7,000 &quot;Alu&quot; insertions are unique to humans.

== Impact in humans ==

&quot;Alu&quot; elements have been proposed to affect gene expression and been found to contain functional promoter regions for steroid hormone receptors. Due to the abundant content of CpG dinucleotides found in &quot;Alu&quot; elements, these regions serve as a site of methylation, contributing to up to 30% of the methylation sites in the human genome. &quot;Alu&quot; elements are also a common source of mutations in humans; however, such mutations are often confined to non-coding regions of pre-mRNA (introns), where they have little discernible impact on the bearer. Mutations in the introns (or non-coding regions of RNA) have little or no effect on phenotype of an individual if the coding portion of individual&#x27;s genome does not contain mutations. The Alu insertions that can be detrimental to the human body are inserted into coding regions (exons) or into mRNA after the process of splicing.

However, the variation generated can be used in studies of the movement and ancestry of human populations, and the mutagenic effect of &quot;Alu&quot; and retrotransposons in general has played a major role in the evolution of the human genome. There are also a number of cases where &quot;Alu&quot; insertions or deletions are associated with specific effects in humans:

=== Associations with human disease ===
&quot;Alu&quot; insertions are sometimes disruptive and can result in inherited disorders. However, most &quot;Alu&quot; variation acts as markers that segregate with the disease so the presence of a particular &quot;Alu&quot; allele does not mean that the carrier will definitely get the disease. The first report of &quot;Alu&quot;-mediated recombination causing a prevalent inherited predisposition to cancer was a 1995 report about &quot;hereditary nonpolyposis colorectal cancer&quot;. In the human genome, the most recently active have been the 22 AluY and 6 AluS Transposon Element subfamilies due to their inherited activity to cause various cancers. Thus due to their major heritable damage it is important to understand the causes that affect their transpositional activity.

The following human diseases have been linked with &quot;Alu&quot; insertions:
* Alport syndrome
* Breast cancer
* chorioretinal degeneration
* Diabetes mellitus type II
* Ewing&#x27;s sarcoma
* Familial hypercholesterolemia
* Hemophilia
* Leigh syndrome
* mucopolysaccharidosis VII
* Neurofibromatosis
* Macular degeneration

And the following diseases have been associated with single-nucleotide DNA variations in Alu elements affecting transcription levels:
* Alzheimer&#x27;s disease
* Lung cancer
* Gastric cancer

The following disease have been associated with repeat expansion of AAGGG pentamere in Alu element :
* RFC1 mutation responsible of CANVAS (Cerebellar Ataxia, Neuropathy &amp; Vestibular Areflexia Syndrome) 

=== Associated human mutations ===
* The &quot;ACE&quot; gene, encoding angiotensin-converting enzyme, has 2 common variants, one with an &quot;Alu&quot; insertion (&quot;ACE&quot;-I) and one with the &quot;Alu&quot; deleted (&quot;ACE&quot;-D). This variation has been linked to changes in sporting ability: the presence of the &quot;Alu&quot; element is associated with better performance in endurance-oriented events (e.g. triathlons), whereas its absence is associated with strength- and power-oriented performance.
* The opsin gene duplication which resulted in the re-gaining of trichromacy in Old World primates (including humans) is flanked by an &quot;Alu&quot; element, implicating the role of &quot;Alu&quot; in the evolution of three colour vision.

<text>The parrot crossbill (Loxia pytyopsittacus) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. It breeds in pine forests in northern and northeastern Europe.

==Taxonomy==
The parrot crossbill was formerly described in 1793 by the German naturalist Moritz Balthasar Borkhausen under the binomial name &quot;Loxia pytyopsittacus&quot;. The type locality was designated as Sweden by Ernst Hartert.

 The species is monotypic: no subspecies are recognised. The genus name &quot;Loxia&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;loxos&quot; meaning &quot;crosswise&quot;; the specific epithet &quot;pytyopsittacus&quot; combines &quot;pitus, pituos&quot; meaning &quot;pine&quot; with &quot;psittakos&quot; meaning &quot;parrot&quot;.&quot; The crossbills are characterised by the mandibles crossing at their tips, which gives the group its English name.

Some pine-feeding populations currently assigned to red crossbill in southern Europe may possibly be better referred to either this species or alternatively to new species in their own right, but as yet, research into them is still at a very early stage.

== Description ==
Adult males tend to be red or orange in colour, and females green or yellow, but there is much variation. This species is difficult to separate from red and Scottish crossbills, and plumage distinctions are negligible. It is slightly larger than other crossbills, measuring long and spanning across the wings. It is quite bulky and heavy weighing from , with an average of . The head and bill are larger than in either of the other species. The bill is thicker than those of its relatives, and the crossed tips are often not readily apparent. Extreme care is needed to identify this species. The deeper, harder &quot;choop&quot; or &quot;tyuup&quot; call is probably the best indicator.

== Distribution and habitat ==
This bird breeds in the pine forests of northwest Europe and into western Russia. There is also a small population in Scotland, adding to the difficulty of distinguishing it from the sympatric red crossbill and the endemic Scottish crossbill. This crossbill is mainly resident, but will migrate south and west if its food source fails.

== Behaviour ==
Parrot crossbills will form flocks outside the breeding season, often mixed with other crossbills.

=== Food and feeding ===
They are specialist feeders on conifer cones, and the unusual bill shape is an adaptation to assist the extraction of the seeds from the cone. The parrot crossbill is a specialist feeder on the cones of Scots pine.

<text>The red crossbill or common crossbill (Loxia curvirostra) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. Crossbills have distinctive mandibles, crossed at the tips, which enable them to extract seeds from conifer cones and other fruits.

Adults are often brightly coloured, with red or orange males and green or yellow females, but there is wide variation in beak size and shape, and call types, leading to different classifications of variants, some of which have been named as subspecies. The species is known as &quot;red crossbill&quot; in North America and &quot;common crossbill&quot; in Europe.

==Description==
Crossbills are characterized by the mandibles crossing at their tips, which gives the group its English name. Using their crossed mandibles for leverage, crossbills are able to efficiently separate the scales of conifer cones and extract the seeds on which they feed. Adult males tend to be red or orange in colour, and females green or yellow, but there is much variation.

=== Identification ===
The distinctive crossed mandibles eliminate most other species, but this feature is shared by the similar two-barred crossbill, with which it overlaps considerably in range. The two-barred crossbill has two bright white wing bars, while the wings of the red crossbill are entirely brownish-black.

The red crossbill is the only dark-winged crossbill throughout most of its range, but it overlaps at least seasonally with the small ranges of the very similar parrot, Scottish, and Cassia crossbills. These species were formerly considered subspecies of the red crossbill, and though they show very slight differences in bill size and shape, they are very difficult to visually distinguish from the red crossbill and are generally best identified by call. The plumage differences between these four crossbills are negligible, there being more variation between individual birds than between species.

Measurements:

* Length: 20 cm
* Weight: 40–53 g
* Wingspan: 27–29 cm

==Breeding and irruption==
Red crossbills breed in a variety of coniferous forests across North America and Eurasia. Its movements and occurrence are linked very closely to the availability of conifer seeds, its primary food source. They typically nest in late summer (June–September) when the seeds of most conifer species mature, but may nest at any time of year if they locate an area with a suitable cone crop.

This species is considered nomadic and highly irruptive, as conifer seed production may vary considerably year to year and birds disperse widely to breed and forage when the cone crop in their particular vicinity fails. In many areas of their range they are considered irregular because they may be present in certain years and not in others. The various types of red crossbill (see Taxonomy and Systematics) prefer different types of conifers, and therefore may differ in the regularity, timing, and direction of their irruptions. A few populations, such as the Newfoundland crossbill (North American type 8), are resident and do not undertake significant movements. When they are not breeding, the various types of red crossbill may flock together, and may also flock with other species of crossbill.
Red crossbill irruptions in the British Isles occur very infrequently, and were remarked upon by writers dating back to the 13th century. These irruptions led in the twentieth century to the establishment of permanent breeding colonies in England, and more recently in Ireland. The first known irruption, recorded in England by the chronicler Matthew Paris, was in 1254; the next, also in England, appears to have been in 1593 (by which time the earlier irruption had apparently been entirely forgotten, since the crossbills were described as &quot;unknown&quot; in England). The engraver Thomas Bewick wrote that &quot;It sometimes is met with in great numbers in this country, but its visits are not regular&quot;, adding that many hundreds arrived in 1821. Bewick then cites Matthew Paris as writing &quot;In 1254, in the fruit season, certain wonderful birds, which had never before been seen in England, appeared, chiefly in the orchards. They were a little bigger than Larks, and eat the pippins of the apples &quot;[pomorum grana]&quot; but no other part of them... They had the parts of the beak crossed &quot;[cancellatas]&quot; by which they divided the apples as with a forceps or knife. The parts of the apples which they left were as if they had been infected with poison.&quot; Bewick further records an account by Sir Roger Twysden for the &quot;Additions to the Additamenta of Matt. Paris&quot; &quot;that in the apple season of 1593, an immense multitude of unknown birds came into England... swallowing nothing but the pippins, &quot;[granella ipsa sive acinos]&quot; and for the purpose of dividing the apple, their beaks were admirably adapted by nature, for they turn back, and strike one point upon the other, so as to show... the transverse sickles, one turned past the other.&quot;

==Taxonomy and systematics==
The red crossbill was formally described by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in 1758 in the tenth edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Loxia curvirostra&quot;. Linnaeus specified the locality as Europe but this was restricted to Sweden by Ernst Hartert in 1904. The genus name &quot;Loxia&quot; is from Ancient Greek , &quot;crosswise&quot;; and &quot;curvirostra&quot; is Latin for &quot;curved bill&quot;.

The red crossbill is in the midst of an adaptive radiation into the niches presented by the various species of conifer. There are about 10 North American and 18 Eurasian types so far identified, with many known to affiliate with a particular conifer species or a suite of similar conifer species. While each type may be seen to feed on many different conifer species when not breeding, each has optimal breeding success only in a particular type of conifer forest. This isolates the populations against interbreeding, which over time has resulted in their diverging genetically, phenotypically, and even speciating. Birds of all types are essentially identical in appearance but have slight differences in their vocalizations. Typically they are identified by their single note &quot;chip&quot; calls, which they give frequently and which differ considerably between types. Often computer analysis is used to distinguish the call types, but experienced observers can learn to separate the more distinctive ones by ear in the field.

The different populations of red crossbill are referred to as &quot;types&quot; because they are differentiated by a phenotypic feature (call note) and not all of them have yet been proven to be genetically distinct. Those populations which have been found to be genetically distinct are considered subspecies. Three populations formerly considered to be subspecies of red crossbill are now recognized by most authorities as full species:

* Scottish Crossbill (&quot;Loxia scotica&quot;) -- Formerly Eurasian type 3C
* Parrot Crossbill (&quot;Loxia ptyopsittacus&quot;) -- Formerly Eurasian type 2D
* Cassia Crossbill (&quot;Loxia sinesciuris&quot;) -- Formerly North American type 9

As research into the species has progressed, types are increasingly being found to be genetically distinct and elevated to the subspecies level. It is expected that this trend will continue, and it is also likely that more of these subspecies will eventually be recognized as full species.

Some large-billed, pine-feeding populations currently assigned to this species in the Mediterranean area may possibly be better referred to either the parrot crossbill or to new species in their own right, but more research is needed. These include the Balearic crossbill (&quot;L. c. balearica&quot;) and the North African crossbill (&quot;L. c. poliogyna&quot;), feeding primarily on Aleppo pine (&quot;Pinus halepensis&quot;); the Cyprus crossbill (&quot;L. c. guillemardi&quot;), feeding primarily on European black pine (&quot;Pinus nigra&quot;); and an as-yet unidentified crossbill with a parrot crossbill-sized bill feeding primarily on Bosnian pine (&quot;Pinus heldreichii&quot;) in the Balkans. These populations also differ on plumage, with the Balearic, North African and Cyprus subspecies having yellower males, and the Balkan type having deep purple-pink males; this, however, merely reflects the differing anthocyanin content of the cones they feed on, as these pigments are transferred to the feathers.

<text>Te Keepa Te Rangihiwinui (died 15 April 1898) was a Māori military commander and noted ally of the government forces during the New Zealand Wars. First known as Te Rangihiwinui, he was later known as Te Keepa, Meiha Keepa, Major Keepa or Major Kemp.

==Early life==
Te Rangihiwinui&#x27;s father was Mahuera Paki Tanguru-o-te-rangi, a leader of the Muaūpoko &quot;iwi&quot; (tribe). His mother was Rere-ō-maki, sister of Te Anaua, a leader of Ngāti Ruaka, a subtribe of Te Āti Haunui-a-Pāpārangi. Te Rangihiwinui was probably born in the early 1820s near Opiki in the Horowhenua. His early years were spent under the threat of tribal warfare resulting from the invasion of their tribal land by the Ngāti Toa, led by Te Rauparaha, and the allied Ngāti Raukawa and Te Āti Awa. Keepa&#x27;s father was an early supporter of New Zealand Company settlement established at Whanganui and served as a constable in the Armed Police Force.

In 1848, Te Keepa was a constable in the Armed Police Force, and was likely serving at Waikane under the command of Major but a few years later was based at Whanganui. Along with other constables, he carried mail between Wellington and the Taranaki region, work that was in addition to their policing role. 

==Second Taranaki War==
In 1864, the Māori tribes on the Upper Whanganui River converted to the Pai Mārire religion and threatened to invade Whanganui town. Te Keepa led the tribes of the lower river to defend the town. The result was the Battle of Moutoa Island and a substantial defeat for the Pai Mārire force on 14 May 1864.

This was the start of six years of warfare for Te Keepa, always fighting on the side of the Pākehā government, usually working closely with Captain Thomas McDonnell. In February 1865, Te Keepa and his force of Whanganui Māori warriors took part in the attack on Ohoutahi Pa, a major Pai Mārire stronghold. Following the murder of the missionary Volkner, they were shipped to the other side of the country, to Ōpōtiki. However they soon returned to Taranaki and were involved in the capture of Wereroa Pa and then the relief of Pipiriki.

Te Keepa gradually built up a personal contingent of between one and two hundred warriors, men who were paid by the government but whose loyalty was to him and his mana as a fighting chieftain. In 1868, he and his men were involved with the insurgency of Titokowaru. Te Keepa commanded the rearguard during the retreat from Te Ngutu o Te Manu after the government forces had been defeated and again in similar circumstances after the Battle of Moturoa. Te Keepa commanded the force pursuing Tītokowaru after he abandoned his pa at Tauranga Ika. It was the first time that British soldiers, officers and men, had served under a Māori commander. By this time Te Keepa had been promoted to the rank of major.

==Pursuit of Te Kooti==
As soon as Titokowaru ceased to be a threat, Te Keepa and his men were transported to the East Coast to join in the pursuit of Te Kooti. Such was his reputation that the Battle of Te Pōrere near Tongariro was delayed until Te Keepa and his men arrived; they were marching up the Whanganui River in the face of snowstorms and volcanic eruptions.

The final pursuit of Te Kooti through the Ureweras was largely handed over to Te Keepa and another Māori war leader, Ropata Wahawaha. He and his men returned to Whanganui in 1871. Over the following years he was honoured with the Queen&#x27;s Sword of Honour in 1870, the New Zealand Cross in 1874 and the New Zealand War Medal in 1876.

==Later life==
In 1871 Te Keepa was appointed as a land purchase officer in Whanganui. He saw this as an opportunity to correct some of the wrongs done to his people during his childhood, a chance to regain some of the land they had lost to the Ngati Raukawa by conquest. This almost brought the tribes to war, Te Keepa threatened to call upon his personal following of warriors if the government did not back up his decisions. There were some violent clashes before the issue went in his favour.

The same year he contested the Western Maori electorate in the , the second time that elections in Māori electorates were held. Of three candidates, he came second, with Wiremu Parata winning the election and the incumbent, Mete Kīngi Paetahi, coming last. He was one of three candidates in the Western Maori electorate in the 1876 election, when he came second. He was beaten by Hoani Nahe and was ahead of the incumbent, Wiremu Parata. 

In 1880, Te Keepa set up a Māori trust to protect Māori land from European buyers. A large area of inland Wanganui was declared off limits to all Europeans. This provoked the government, but Te Keepa&#x27;s large personal following of warriors meant they were very cautious in dealing with him. In addition, he had the support of some members of the government, including the Native Minister, John Ballance. He unsuccessfully contested the Western Maori electorate in the . Of eight candidates, he came second with 20.1% of the vote.

Land dealings in his later years added stresses and caused debts. He sought to unify the Maori tribes in the Te Kotahitanga (unity of purpose) movement, and force government adherence to the principles of the Treaty of Waitangi. In a speech he made in March 1889 at Ōrākei he urged the government to work with Te Kotahitanga but this was rejected. Te Keepa Te Rangihiwinui died at Putiki, near Whanganui, on 15 April 1898.

<text>Patrick Joseph Leahy ( ; born March 31, 1940) is an American politician and attorney who represented Vermont in the United States Senate from 1975 to 2023. A member of the Democratic Party, he also was the president pro tempore of the United States Senate from 2012 to 2015 and from 2021 to 2023.

Leahy was the third-longest-serving U.S. senator in history at 48 years, and was the longest-serving member of the United States Congress to serve solely as a senator. During his tenure he chaired the Senate Appropriations Committee, the Senate Judiciary Committee and the Senate Agriculture Committee. In March 2022, he became the most senior member of Congress. At the time of his retirement, Leahy was the dean of Vermont&#x27;s congressional delegation, Vermont&#x27;s longest-serving U.S. senator, and the first Democrat ever elected to the U.S. Senate from Vermont. Leahy was succeeded by Peter Welch, who became the second Democrat to represent Vermont in the Senate.

Leahy&#x27;s signature legislation is the Leahy Law forbidding the United States from funding foreign military units which violate human rights. Leahy was the presiding officer at Donald Trump&#x27;s second impeachment trial, becoming the first senator to preside over a former president&#x27;s impeachment trial. In 2023, Patrick Leahy Burlington International Airport was renamed after him.

==Early life and education==
Leahy was born in Montpelier, Vermont, the son of Alba (née Zambon) and Howard Francis Leahy. He has been legally blind in his left eye since birth. Leahy&#x27;s maternal grandparents were Italian, and his father was of Irish ancestry; some of his ancestors came to Vermont in the 19th century to work at the granite quarries and manufacturing plants in Barre Town and Barre City. The Leahys ran a printing business across from the Vermont State House, and were also the publishers of the &quot;Waterbury Record&quot; newspaper. Leahy attended the parochial schools of Montpelier, and graduated from Montpelier&#x27;s St. Michael&#x27;s High School in 1957.

In 1961, Leahy graduated from Saint Michael&#x27;s College with a Bachelor of Arts degree in government. While attending college, Leahy was a member of the National Federation of Catholic College Students. He was also involved with the Knights of Columbus, the Saint Michael&#x27;s College Glee Club, and the school&#x27;s pre-law society and politics club. He was active with the Reserve Officers&#x27; Training Corps rifle team, and was a member of the varsity rifle team. He was also on the staff of &quot;The Shield&quot;, the Saint Michael&#x27;s College yearbook and WSSE, the school&#x27;s AM radio station. In 1964, Leahy received his Juris Doctor from the Georgetown University Law Center. While in law school, Leahy was active in the Phi Delta Phi legal honor society. In addition, Leahy participated in Georgetown Law&#x27;s Legal Aid Society and Legal Argument Program. He was also a representative to the school&#x27;s Student Bar Association.

At graduation, Leahy was offered an E. Barrett Prettyman Fellowship, which would have enabled him to earn a Master of Laws degree from Georgetown while receiving training in courtroom advocacy. Leahy was also interviewed by the United States Attorney General, Robert F. Kennedy as one of several Georgetown Law students being considered for recruitment into the United States Department of Justice. He declined the fellowship and did not pursue a position at the Department of Justice because he intended to return to Vermont, and because he did not plan to practice criminal law.

== Early career ==
Leahy was admitted to the bar soon after his law school graduation and became an associate at the Burlington firm headed by Philip H. Hoff, who then was governor of Vermont. In January 1965, Leahy was appointed as an assistant to Lewis E. Springer Jr., the legislative draftsman for the Vermont General Assembly. While working for Hoff&#x27;s firm, Leahy was also appointed as Burlington&#x27;s assistant city attorney.

In May 1966, Hoff appointed Leahy State&#x27;s Attorney of Chittenden County after the incumbent resigned. Leahy was elected to a full term in 1966 and reelected in 1970. His service as state&#x27;s attorney was notable for his participation in the sting operation that caught Paul Lawrence, an undercover police officer for numerous departments in Vermont. Lawrence falsely claimed to have purchased illegal drugs from several people, resulting in numerous convictions based on his perjury.

From 1971 to 1974, Leahy served as vice president of the National Association of District Attorneys, and in 1974 the organization named him one of the country&#x27;s three outstanding prosecutors. Beginning in 1971, he was also involved in the extensive effort to solve the murder of Rita Curran, who had been killed in her Burlington apartment. The murder, which Leahy later called among the most violent he saw while working as a prosecutor, went unsolved until 2023, when DNA testing of evidence left at the crime scene led to the identification of the perpetrator.

==U.S. Senate==
===Early career (1975–1987)===
Leahy originally aspired to the governorship, but in 1974, ran for the United States Senate. He ran in the wake of the Watergate scandal that had resulted in President Richard Nixon&#x27;s resignation in August of that year, won a close race against Republican Congressman Richard W. Mallary, and succeeded the retiring George Aiken. At age 34, Leahy was the youngest U.S. senator in Vermont history, the first non-Republican senator from Vermont since 1856, and the first Democrat to represent Vermont in the chamber. In 1980, Leahy defeated Republican Stewart Ledbetter by only 2,700 votes amid Ronald Reagan&#x27;s landslide victory in the presidential election. In 1986, he faced what was on paper an even stronger challenger in former Governor Richard Snelling, but Leahy turned it back, taking 63 percent of the vote. In 1992, Vermont Secretary of State Jim Douglas held him to 54 percent of the vote. After that, Leahy did not face a strong Republican challenger.

In May 1981, Leahy and Senator Ted Kennedy requested that the Senate reject John Crowell Jr.&#x27;s nomination as Assistant Agriculture Secretary. Leahy said his opposition was &quot;because documents have been uncovered since his approval by the Agriculture Committee which suggest that he was aware of and involved in the anti-competitive and monopolistic practices of his former employer.&quot; Leahy and Kennedy contended that Crowell concealed his involvement with Louisiana-Pacific, Panhandle Logging Company, and Ketchikan Spruce Mills during the confirmation process. Crowell was confirmed by the Senate.

In October 1981, Leahy introduced an amendment that would have increased the Energy Department&#x27;s enforcement budget by $13 million. He called the Reagan administration&#x27;s cuts to the enforcement budget &quot;de facto amnesty&quot; for violations made by alleged increases in prices for oil companies. The amendment was defeated in the Senate on October 28 by a vote of 48 to 43. On December 2, 1981, Leahy voted for an amendment to Reagan&#x27;s MX missiles proposal that would divert the silo system by $334 million, as well as earmark further research for other methods that would allow giant missiles to be based. The vote was seen as a rebuff of the Reagan administration. In March 1982, Leahy was named to the Senate Select Committee to Study Law Enforcement Undercover Activities of the Department of Justice, an eight-member select committee formed to investigate undercover operations. The resolution introducing the committee was the result of Harrison A. Williams&#x27;s resignation for his involvement in the Abscam sting operation. On December 23, 1982, Leahy voted for a five-cent per gallon increase on gasoline taxes across the U.S. to finance highway repairs and mass transit. The bill passed on the last day of the 97th United States Congress. On October 19, 1983, Leahy voted for a bill establishing Martin Luther King Jr. Day. Reagan signed the legislation the next month. In March 1984, Leahy voted against a proposed constitutional amendment authorizing periods in public school for silent prayer, and against Reagan&#x27;s unsuccessful proposal for a constitutional amendment permitting organized school prayer in public schools.

=== Senate Agriculture Committee and other activities (1987–1999) ===

Leahy was appointed chair of the Senate Agriculture Committee on January 3, 1987. During his tenure as vice-chair of the United States Senate Select Committee on Intelligence in 1987, Leahy showed a news reporter an unclassified draft report on the Iran–Contra affair. At a press conference afterward, Leahy said, &quot;Even though it was declassified, I was way too careless about it&quot; and accepted blame. Disclosure of that information was against Intelligence Committee rules; Leahy said he hastened his already planned departure from the committee because he was so angry at himself. Later that year, as a member of the Senate Judiciary Committee, Leahy said that if Reagan could not produce an acceptable Supreme Court nominee to replace Lewis F. Powell Jr., after Robert Bork was rejected and Douglas Ginsburg withdrew, Senate Democrats would refuse hearings for any nominee until after the 1988 presidential election. In May 1989, Leahy urged the Agriculture Department to withdraw the proposals regarding the reduction of federal inspections. In May 1990, he and Representative Dan Glickman introduced the Consumer Seafood Safety Act, a bill that would have strengthened fish inspections. Leahy has been active in the international effort to ban the production, export, and use of anti-personnel land mines. In 1992, he penned a bill to prohibit the export of land mines, the first law of its kind.

In February 1992, the George H. W. Bush administration and Israeli officials struggled to strike a deal that would entice both sides to proceed with a loan guarantee package. After a meeting between Secretary of State James Baker and Zalman Shoval failed to generate a compromise, Baker informed Leahy of the meeting&#x27;s contents and Leahy announced that he would introduce his own plan if the U.S. and Israel could not come to an agreement in the following weeks. Later that month, the Bush administration announced the U.S. would present Israel with loan guarantees only if the Israeli government halted settlement building. Leahy supported the measure and introduced his own proposal that retained the $10 billion in loan guarantees, but &quot;disbursed at a pace up to $2 billion a year for five years&quot;. On November 20, 1993, Leahy voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement. The agreement linked the U.S., Canada, and Mexico into a single free trade zone, and was signed into law on December 8 by President Bill Clinton. Clinton publicly weighed reducing funding for The Emergency Food Assistance Program (TEFAP) by half. In March 1994, during a news conference, Leahy pledged that he would preserve funding for TEFAP, noting his 1987 lawsuit against Agriculture Secretary Richard Edmund Lyng and declaring that TEFAP maintained the same level of significance as it did then. In August 1994, Leahy attended a news conference with the health advocacy group Public Voice, as it urged the federal government to take more ambitious steps to increase the healthiness of school lunches. He praised the 41 schools involved with Public Voice for setting a good example for the rest of the country and cited the importance of school lunches to education. The 1994 midterm elections resulted in a Republican majority in the House for the first time since the 1950s, and conversation arose of limiting feeding programs. Leahy remarked, &quot;Not since the Great Depression has the possibility of millions of children lining up at soup kitchens been so real.&quot; He cosponsored legislation with Indiana Republican Richard Lugar that led to the downsizing of the Agriculture Department. In December 1994, the department announced it was closing 1,274 field offices around the US, a scaling back that was estimated to save over $3 billion over the next five years. Leahy said the Agriculture Department was the only federal agency to succeed in its downsizing efforts and called on other agencies to follow its example. In 1994, Leahy introduced legislation to encourage schools to ban soft drinks and other food items of &quot;minimal nutritional value&quot;, saying, &quot;These vending profits go for good causes. But when it comes to vending machine junk food, it would be better to put pupils ahead of vending profits.&quot; The bill overcame opposition from The Coca-Cola Company and other representatives of the beverage industry, as well as some education organizations, and was enacted. In October 1999, Leahy voted for the Comprehensive Test Ban Treaty. The treaty was designed to ban underground nuclear testing and was the first major international security pact to be defeated in the Senate since the Treaty of Versailles.

===1999 to 2009===
The 1998 United States Senate election in Vermont was noteworthy, in that Republican candidate Fred Tuttle endorsed Leahy. Tuttle was a retired farmer and the lead actor in the mock documentary film &quot;Man with a Plan&quot;, shot in Vermont, in which a farmer decides to run for Congress. After winning the Republican nomination in a campaign designed both to promote the movie and to mock ostensible GOP frontrunner Jack McMullen, who had only recently moved to Vermont from Massachusetts, Tuttle recommended that voters support Leahy. Leahy was touched by this gesture; he and Tuttle made several joint appearances during the campaign, and Leahy said of Tuttle that he was the &quot;distilled essence of Vermonthood&quot;.

The September 11 attacks on the World Trade Center shifted American foreign policy focus to terrorism. In December 2006, during an appearance at the law school of Georgetown University, Leahy said that after the September 11 attacks, &quot;the White House accelerated its power plays at the expense of the other branches of government, all in the name of fighting terrorism.&quot; He added that the administration had declined to answer &quot;the legitimate oversight questions of the public&#x27;s duly elected representatives&quot;, as well as broken the law by wiretapping Americans without warrants. On September 13, 2002, Leahy said in a radio interview that an investigation should be launched into whether the West Nile virus was a biological terrorism effort. During a July 1, 2007, interview, Leahy said he was not against lawful eavesdropping and recommended a revision to the Federal Intelligence Surveillance Act, so potential terrorists could be investigated without question. Leahy added that the White House had been subpoenaed, so George W. Bush administration officials could explain &quot;the legal justification they tried to follow when, for years, they wiretapped ordinary Americans and everyone else put out a warrant.&quot; Leahy was one of two senators targeted in the 2001 anthrax attacks. The anthrax letter meant for him was intercepted before it reached his office. In 2004, Leahy was awarded the Electronic Privacy Information Center&#x27;s Champion of Freedom Award, for efforts in information privacy and open government. He is regarded as one of the leading privacy advocates in Congress. In 2000, Leahy cosigned a letter sent to Appropriations Committee conference members, requesting a delay in implementing Section 304 in H.R. 4392, the Intelligence Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2001, until it could be fully considered by the Senate Committee on the Judiciary. The amendment would introduce new felony crime laws, concerning the unauthorized disclosure of information. Leahy and his colleagues indicated this would be in conflict with existing First Amendment rights and Whistleblower Protection Acts. On June 22, 2004, Leahy and Vice President Dick Cheney participated in the U.S. Senate class photo. After the vote, Cheney was talking to only Republicans. When Leahy asked him to come over and talk to the Democrats, Cheney upbraided Leahy for the Senator&#x27;s recent excoriations of Halliburton&#x27;s activities in Iraq. At the end of the exchange, Cheney told Leahy, &quot;Go fuck yourself.&quot; Leahy joked about the incident in 2007, when he escorted Bernie Sanders, Vermont&#x27;s newly elected senator, to the well of the Senate where he was sworn in by Cheney: &quot;When it comes to the vice president, it&#x27;s always better to be sworn in than to be sworn at.&quot;

Leahy opposed the invasion of Iraq in 2003, and writes in his 2022 memoir that he found files with information that contradicted Dick Cheney&#x27;s public statements about Iraq after mysterious joggers whose identities he did not know told him to request specific files.

In March 2004, Leahy and Senator Orrin Hatch introduced the Pirate Act, backed by the Recording Industry Association of America. In July 2004, Leahy and Hatch introduced the INDUCE Act. Both were aimed at combating copyright infringement. On November 2, 2004, Leahy easily defeated his opponent, businessman Jack McMullen, with 70.6 percent of the vote. On September 21, 2005, Leahy announced his support for John Roberts to be Chief Justice of the United States Supreme Court. On January 19, 2006, Leahy announced that he would vote against Judge Samuel Alito, to be a justice of the Supreme Court. He has a mixed record on gun control, being one of the few Senate Democrats to vote against the Brady Bill. He voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and is in favor of phasing out farm subsidies. He voted against the Dominican Republic-Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA). Leahy voted for the Defense of Marriage Act and was one of the few in his party to support the ban on intact dilation and extraction procedures. In 2005, Project on Government Oversight, a government watchdog group, presented Leahy and Senator John Cornyn with its first ever Bi-Partisan Leadership Award, in honor of their cooperation on issues of government oversight and transparency, including their co-sponsorship of the OPEN Government Act of 2005, which prevented burying exemptions to the Freedom of Information Act in legislation. On March 2, 2006, Leahy was one of ten senators to vote against the USA PATRIOT Improvement and Reauthorization Act, a bill to extend the USA PATRIOT Act. The Reauthorization Act changed the appointment process for interim United States attorneys, allowing the Attorney General of the United States to make interim appointments without term limit or Senatorial confirmation. This was an aspect of hearings in the dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy. In March 2007, both houses voted to overturn the interim appointment provision. On January 18, 2007, Leahy received widespread coverage for his cross-examination of Attorney General Alberto Gonzales, about the Maher Arar affair and the extraordinary rendition of Arar to Syria.

===Later career (2009–2023)===
Leahy endorsed Barack Obama, the Democratic junior senator from Illinois, in the 2008 presidential election, and recorded a radio advertisement for the Obama campaign to be aired in Vermont.

In May 2009, President Obama nominated Sonia Sotomayor to the Supreme Court. Sotomayor received criticism for having said &quot;I would hope that a wise Latina woman with the richness of her experiences would more often than not reach a better conclusion than a white male who hasn&#x27;t lived that life.&quot; In June, Leahy discussed the remark with Sotomayor and secured her consent to publicly recount their conversation. According to Leahy, the comment meant she believed one&#x27;s life experiences influence who they are, but that judges of all ethnic backgrounds are still required to follow the law, which is the same for every American. In August, on the day of Sotomayor&#x27;s confirmation, Leahy defended her record against Republican critics: &quot;Judge Sotomayor&#x27;s career and judicial record demonstrates that she has always followed the rule of law. Attempts at distorting that record by suggesting that her ethnicity or heritage will be the driving force in her decisions as a justice of the Supreme Court are demeaning to women and all communities of color.&quot;

On September 20, 2010, Leahy introduced the Combating Online Infringement and Counterfeits Act, Senate Bill S. 3804, which would allow the court to issue a restraining order or injunction against Internet domain names which infringe upon copyright.

In May 2011, Leahy introduced the Protect IP Act (PIPA) to the Senate. The bill was drafted to give the U.S. government and copyright holders additional tools to fight copyright piracy and counterfeit goods trafficking by foreign rogue websites. Critics of the bill said it would be ineffective, impede free expression on the internet, and interfere with its infrastructure. Leahy subsequently indicated that he would favor further research into provisions that raised objections.

Leahy chaired the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee from 1987 until 1995 the Judiciary Committee from 2001 to 2003 and from 2007 to 2015. He is one of the key Democratic leaders on Senate issues on rules for filling federal judgeships, via advise and consent. Leahy serves as second-highest Democrat on the Appropriations Committee and as Chairman of the Appropriations Subcommittee on State, Foreign Operations and Related Programs. In his position as the second-highest Democrat on the Agriculture, Nutrition and Forestry Committee, Leahy chairs the Agriculture Subcommittee on Research, Nutrition and General Legislation.

Upon the death of Senate President pro tempore Daniel Inouye, a Hawaii Democrat, on December 17, 2012, Leahy became the most senior senator in the majority party, and was elected president pro tempore by unanimous consent. He was succeeded in this post by Orrin Hatch on January 3, 2015, and became president pro tempore emeritus.

In February 2013, Leahy was one of 24 senators to sign a letter asserting that Sikh, Hindu and Arab Americans were often targets of violence because they were mistaken for radical Muslims and citing a need for the federal government to &quot;begin tracking information about anti-Sikh, anti-Hindu and anti-Arab hate crimes as soon as possible so that law enforcement can more effectively respond to this threat&quot;.

In June 2013, Leahy filed three amendments to an immigration reform package, including one that proposed recognizing same-sex marriages when one spouse is an American. He said implementation of the amendment would end discrimination in the American immigration system and that seeking &quot;equal protection under our laws for the LGBT community is the right thing to do.&quot;

According to GovTrack, in 2013, Leahy was the senator who has sponsored the most bipartisan bills. Sixty-one percent of bills he sponsored had both Democratic and Republican co-sponsors.

In January 2015, Leahy headed a congressional delegation to Cuba, meant to &quot;impress upon Cuban leaders the importance of concrete results and positive momentum&quot;. It was American officials&#x27; first visit to Cuba, since President Obama announced normalized relations between the US and Cuba the previous month.

In July 2015, after the Joint Comprehensive Plan of Action was unveiled, an international agreement on the nuclear program of Iran, Leahy issued a statement saying it was preferable to war and calling it &quot;unfortunate&quot; that some members of Congress opposed the deal as the lack of deal would allow Iran to further develop nuclear weapons.

In January 2017, during a hearing, Leahy asked Jeff Sessions, President-elect Donald Trump&#x27;s nominee for attorney general, whether he believed grabbing a woman by her genitals without consent was sexual assault, in reference to comments made by Trump on the &quot;Access Hollywood&quot; tape that had surfaced during the election cycle. Leahy also asked Sessions if he would be able to &quot;prosecute and investigate&quot; a president or elected official who had been accused of committing the aforementioned act.

In April 2017, Leahy was one of 11 senators to cosponsor a bill that would have restored a FCC rule requiring internet service providers to obtain permission from customers before selling data about them to advertisers that had been repealed earlier in the week.

On June 1, 2017, weeks after the firing of FBI Director James Comey, Leahy and Senator Al Franken of Minnesota released a joint statement disclosing their prior request of Comey to investigate all contacts and communications Attorney General Sessions or his aides had with Russian government officials and raised the question of whether Sessions had committed perjury in his Senate testimony.

In September 2017, Leahy was one of eight senators to vote against the National Defense Authorization Act (NDAA), a defense policy bill that included $640 billion in base defense spending and $60 billion in war funds.

In November 2017, Leahy was one of ten Democratic senators to sign a letter urging Prime Minister of Israel Benjamin Netanyahu to halt the planned demolitions of Palestinian villages Khan al-Ahmar and Sussiya, on the grounds that such action would further impede efforts to seek a two-state solution and &quot;endanger Israel&#x27;s future as a Jewish democracy&quot;.

On January 18, 2018, Leahy announced he would not support the stopgap measure for the fiscal year to avert a government shutdown, saying the House bill left &quot;too much undone, and it is woefully inadequate&quot;. Leahy added that bipartisan support for the bill would only come from collaborating with Democrats and charged Republicans with &quot;appealing for our support only after they&#x27;ve written a mishmash bill crafted behind closed doors&quot;. After the United States federal government shutdown of January 2018 commenced, Leahy was one of 18 senators to vote against temporary funding.

In February 2018, Leahy was one of four senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Defense James Mattis requesting that the Pentagon estimate the cost of and time needed to assemble President Trump&#x27;s requested military parade, calling the parade seemingly &quot;inappropriate and wasteful&quot; at a time of war.

In March 2018, Leahy wrote a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Chuck Grassley in which he expressed his fear that &quot;the damage being done to the FBI, and to our nation&#x27;s institutions more broadly, will far outlast any current crises unless we take decisive, bipartisan action&quot; and requested an oversight hearing on the Trump administration&#x27;s criticisms of the FBI and Justice Department.

In September 2018, as the Senate weighed the first spending package for the 2019 fiscal year, Leahy advocated for increasing the spending cap for a veterans&#x27; care program. When this proposal was not implemented in the final version of the package, which consisted of military construction and veterans&#x27; affairs, legislative branch, and energy and water, Leahy warned the decision would leave the VA choice program unfunded.

In October 2018, Leahy, along with Senate Foreign Relations Committee Chairman Bob Corker, ranking Democrat on the Foreign Relations Committee Bob Menendez, and Lindsey Graham, sent President Trump a letter requesting that he begin an investigation of the disappearance of Saudi journalist Jamal Khashoggi, under the Global Magnitsky Human Rights Accountability Act. The letter asked Trump to report the findings within 120 days, along with a decision on whether to impose sanctions on those found responsible. Later that month, Leahy was one of eight senators to sign a letter to Director of National Intelligence Dan Coats requesting a classified briefing on what the American intelligence community knew about threats to Khashoggi, so that the senators may fulfill their &quot;oversight obligation&quot; as members of Congress. In March 2019, Leahy was one of nine Democratic senators to sign a letter to Salman of Saudi Arabia requesting the release of human rights lawyer Waleed Abu al-Khair and writer Raif Badawi, women&#x27;s rights activists Loujain al-Hathloul and Samar Badawi, and Dr. Walid Fitaih. The senators wrote, &quot;Not only have reputable international organizations detailed the arbitrary detention of peaceful activists and dissidents without trial for long periods, but the systematic discrimination against women, religious minorities and mistreatment of migrant workers and others has also been well-documented.&quot;

In December 2018, after United States Secretary of State Mike Pompeo announced the Trump administration would suspend its obligations in the Intermediate-Range Nuclear Forces Treaty in 60 days, if Russia continued to violate the treaty, Leahy was one of 26 senators to sign a letter expressing concern over the administration&#x27;s &quot;now abandoning generations of bipartisan U.S. leadership around the paired goals of reducing the global role and number of nuclear weapons and ensuring strategic stability with America&#x27;s nuclear-armed adversaries&quot; and calling on President Trump to continue arms negotiations.

After Minnesota Representative Rick Nolan retired from Congress in 2019, Leahy became the only remaining Watergate baby in Congress.

Leahy endorsed fellow Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders&#x27;s 2020 presidential campaign.

In May 2021, POLITICO reported that Leahy was &quot;leaning toward [running for a ninth term]&quot; and asking his Senate colleagues for support. On November 15, 2021, Leahy announced that he was not running for a ninth term. Upon the death of Representative Don Young on March 18, 2022, Leahy became the longest-serving current member of Congress. Leahy&#x27;s last term ended in January 2023, and he was succeeded by Peter Welch; he was the last United States senator to have served in the 1970s.

===Nomination for UN General Assembly===
In September 2022, Leahy was nominated as a representative of the United States to the Seventy-seventh session of the United Nations General Assembly.

==Political positions==

Leahy has held progressive political positions that are generally in line with those of the state.

===Abortion===
Leahy has supported abortion rights, rejecting proposals to limit minors or those stationed on military bases from having the procedure performed. He voted against the Partial-Birth Abortion Ban Act in 1995 and for it between 1997 and 2003.

On March 11, 1982, Leahy voted against a measure sponsored by Orrin Hatch that sought to reverse &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot; and allow Congress and individual states to adopt laws banning abortions. Its passing was the first time a congressional committee supported an anti-abortion amendment.

===Agriculture===
In 2019, Leahy worked with Senators Sherrod Brown, Susan Collins, and David Perdue on a bipartisan effort to ensure students have access to local foods. The proposal would bolster the Farm to School Grant Program, administered by the Agriculture Department, and raise the program&#x27;s authorized level from $5 million to $15 million, in addition to furthering the maximum grant award to $250,000.

In March 2019, Leahy was one of 38 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Agriculture Sonny Perdue warning that dairy farmers &quot;have continued to face market instability and are struggling to survive the fourth year of sustained low prices&quot;, and urging his department to &quot;strongly encourage these farmers to consider the Dairy Margin Coverage program&quot;.

In May 2019, Leahy and eight other Democratic senators sent Perdue a letter that criticized the USDA for using farm bailout money to purchase pork from the Brazilian-owned JBS USA, writing that it was &quot;counterproductive and contradictory&quot; for foreign companies to receive &quot;U.S. taxpayer dollars intended to help American farmers struggling with this administration&#x27;s trade policy&quot;. The senators requested that the department &quot;ensure these commodity purchases are carried out in a manner that most benefits the American farmer&#x27;s bottom line—not the business interests of foreign corporations.&quot;

In June 2019, Leahy and 18 other Democratic senators sent USDA Inspector General (IG), Phyllis K. Fong, a letter requesting that she investigate USDA instances of retaliation and political decision-making, and arguing that to not conduct an investigation would mean these &quot;actions could be perceived as a part of this administration&#x27;s broader pattern of not only discounting the value of federal employees, but suppressing, undermining, discounting, and wholesale ignoring scientific data produced by their own qualified scientists.&quot;

===Antitrust, competition, and corporate regulation===
In June 2019, Leahy was one of six Democrats, led by Amy Klobuchar, who signed letters to the Federal Trade Commission (FTC) and the Department of Justice recounting that many of them had &quot;called on both the FTC and the Justice Department to investigate potential anticompetitive activity in these markets, particularly following the significant enforcement actions taken by foreign competition enforcers against these same companies&quot;, and requesting that each agency confirm whether it had opened antitrust investigations into each of the companies and that each agency pledge to publicly release any such investigation&#x27;s findings.

===Cannabis===
Leahy supports states&#x27; rights to make their own cannabis laws. He proposed a companion to the Rohrabacher-Farr Amendment, which would extend protections to states that have legalized cannabis in some form. It became known as the Leahy Amendment, and prevents the federal government from spending federal tax dollars to prosecute people who are following their state&#x27;s cannabis laws.

===Child care===
In 2019, Leahy and 34 other senators introduced the Child Care for Working Families Act, a bill that created 770,000 new child care jobs and ensured that families making less than 75 percent of the state median income did not pay for child care, with higher earning families having to pay &quot;their fair share for care on a sliding scale, regardless of the number of children they have&quot;. The legislation also supported universal access to high-quality preschool programs for all three- and four-year-olds, changed compensation for the child care workforce, and provided training to aid both teachers and caregivers.

===China===
In a September 12, 2019, press release, Leahy condemned the persecution of Falun Gong practitioners in China and contended that Falun Gong is a threat to the survival of the Chinese Communist Party. He also argued that the Chinese government should commit to ending the use of torture, organ harvesting of prisoners, and propaganda against minorities.

===Civil justice===
In February 2016, Leahy introduced the &quot;Restoring Statutory Rights Act&quot;, to &quot;prevent companies from imposing forced arbitration in cases covered by consumer protection laws, as well as employment discrimination and other civil rights matters&quot;.

===Civil rights and privacy===
Leahy has been supported by the NAACP and is outspoken in his support for affirmative action. He has supported the legalization of gay marriage and reducing discrimination against gays and lesbians. Leahy has called for the domestic partners of federal employees to receive the same benefits as heterosexual couples.

Leahy is a lead sponsor of the Senate version of the Email Privacy Act, which would reform the Electronic Communications Privacy Act of 1986 and enhance privacy protections for email. He sponsored this bipartisan bill with Republican Mike Lee of Utah.

===Criminal justice===
Leahy has called for a moratorium on the death penalty and for more DNA testing for death row inmates. He supports rehabilitation as the goal of prisons and providing treatment, instead of punishment, for first-time offenders.

In February 2015, Leahy and Republican Rand Paul revived the Justice Safety Valve Act, legislation granting federal judges authority to bestow sentences lower than the mandatory punishment in certain cases, where the sentence violates standards for fair punishment as defined elsewhere in American law.

In October 2017, Leahy cosponsored a bill aimed at easing sentences for some nonviolent offenders, such as for drug crimes, while beefing up other tough-on-crime laws. The bill would have abolished the three-strike mandatory life sentence for some repeat drug offenders and authorized enhanced penalties for some individuals with previous convictions for serious violent and drug felonies.

On July 31, 2019, after Attorney General William Barr announced that the federal government would resume carrying out the death penalty, for the first time in over 20 years, Leahy, Cory Booker, and Dick Durbin introduced a bill that would ban the death penalty. Leahy said capital punishment fails &quot;by any objective measure&quot;, citing its finality and juries&#x27; propensity to mistakenly convict.

===Defense===
Leahy was a longtime critic of the Iraq War, and spoke in favor of timetables for troop withdrawal, saying the country needs well-trained employees in both foreign service and private industry to help repair damage to its civilian structure. He has been critical of the PATRIOT Act, even though he has voted to reauthorize altered versions of it. In June 2013, following the disclosure of PRISM and other covert surveillance activities by the National Security Agency, Leahy introduced a bill that would tighten guidelines related to the acquisition of FISA warrants for domestic surveillance and shorten the current FISA authorization by two years.

Leahy has always opposed the opening and operation of the Guantanamo Bay detention camp, and supported punishment of war profiteering.

===Economy===
On taxation, Leahy has consistently supported progressive rates. He has rejected proposals to remove the Estate Tax and Alternative Minimum Tax, and he has spoken out strongly against cutting taxes for the wealthy. Leahy has strongly supported the rights of employees, and has voted to increase the minimum wage and allow for more union organization. He has voted against a free trade proposal, CAFTA, but supported normalizing trade relations with China.

===Environment===
Leahy has been a strong supporter of environmental policy. He has supported bills that would increase hydrogen car production, uphold Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, set a goal of reducing oil consumption by 40 percent in 2025, and increase solar and wind power funding.

===Climate change===
In 2011, Leahy voted against limiting EPA&#x27;s ability to regulate greenhouse gas emissions. In 2013, he voted against a concurrent resolution creating a point of order which would make it harder for Congress to put a price on carbon. In 2015, he voted in support of Obama&#x27;s Clean Power Plan. On his Climate Change page, he states that &quot;human activity, since the Industrial Revolution, has contributed, in large part, to the changes in climate.&quot; He has supported the establishment of greenhouse gas tradeable allowances and has spoken out against the use of ethanol as a solution to rising gasoline prices.

In June 2017, after President Trump announced the US would withdraw from the Paris Agreement, Leahy called the move a &quot;great leap backward&quot;, adding that pandering &quot;to a handful of billionaires and special interests would impose huge harm upon our generation, upon future generations, and upon our fragile planet.&quot; He said he intended &quot;to ensure that this stroke of the president&#x27;s pen does not derail Vermonters&#x27; hard work and leadership to protect our communities from climate risk, and that it does not deter the entrepreneurs and innovators in Vermont and other states who are expanding the world markets for the clean green energy and conservation technologies that will shape our future.&quot;

In February 2019, in response to reports that the EPA intended to decide against setting limits for perfluorooctane sulfonic acid (PFOS) and perfluorooctanoic acid (PFOA) in drinking water, as part of an upcoming national strategy to manage the chemicals, Leahy was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Acting EPA Administrator, Andrew R. Wheeler, calling on the agency &quot;to develop enforceable federal drinking water standards for PFOA and PFOS, as well as institute immediate actions to protect the public from contamination from additional per- and polyfluoroalkyl substances (PFAS)&quot;.

===Pipelines===
In October 2016, Leahy was one of five senators to sign a letter to President Obama requesting that the administration halt work on the Dakota Access Pipeline, until the permitting process of the Army Corps could &quot;be transparent and include public notice and participation, formal and meaningful tribal consultation, and adequate environmental review&quot;, and stating their support for the &quot;tribes along the pipeline route in their fight against the Dakota Access pipeline project&quot;.

===First Amendment===
Leahy spoke strongly against a proposed constitutional ban on flag burning and on its implications for freedom of speech and expression. He rejects school prayer initiatives.

===Gun control===
Leahy has supported gun control, including requiring background checks at gun shows and allowing for lawsuits against firearms manufacturers. He voted in favor of prohibiting foreign and UN aid that inhibits gun ownership.

In January 2019, Leahy was one of 40 senators to introduce the Background Check Expansion Act, a bill that would require background checks for either the sale or transfer of all firearms, including unlicensed sellers. Exceptions to the bill&#x27;s background check requirement included transfers between members of law enforcement, loaning firearms for either hunting or sporting events on a temporary basis, giving firearms to members of one&#x27;s immediate family, firearms being transferred as part of an inheritance, or giving a firearm to another person temporarily for immediate self-defense.

In February 2019, Leahy was one of 38 senators to sign a letter to Senate Judiciary Committee Chairman Lindsey Graham calling on him to &quot;hold a hearing&quot; on universal background checks and noting Graham&#x27;s statement in the press that he &quot;intended to have the Committee work on &#x27;red flag&#x27; legislation and potentially also background checks, both actions&quot; the senators indicated their support for.

===Health care===
Leahy has stated the importance of increasing the prevalence of public health care, during times of economic downturn. He voted to increase Medicare benefits and to allow this organization to negotiate lower-priced, bulk prescriptions from pharmaceutical manufacturers. Leahy has broken with Democratic leadership in supporting allowing states to make bulk drug purchases on their own, an idea he has characterized as an important short-term solution until Congress can agree on a similar proposal.

In a May 2012 speech on the Senate floor, Leahy advocated that Chief Justice John Roberts uphold the constitutionality of the Affordable Care Act: &quot;The conservative activism of recent years has not been good for the court. Given the ideological challenge to the Affordable Care Act and the extensive, supportive precedent, it would be extraordinary for the Supreme Court not to defer to Congress in this matter that so clearly affects interstate commerce.&quot;

In March 2017, after House Republicans withdrew the American Health Care Act, Leahy released a statement touting the accomplishments of the Affordable Care Act and charging Republicans with trying to undo the record with a bill that was really &quot;a massive tax cut for the wealthiest Americans&quot;.

In September 2017, Leahy was one of 16 senators to co-sponsor the Medicare for All Act, introduced by his fellow Vermont Senator Bernie Sanders, which would establish a single-payer healthcare system in the United States.

In December 2018, Leahy was one of 42 senators to sign a letter to Trump administration officials Alex Azar, Seema Verma, and Steve Mnuchin arguing that the administration was improperly using Section 1332 of the Affordable Care Act to authorize states to &quot;increase health care costs for millions of consumers while weakening protections for individuals with pre-existing conditions&quot;. The senators requested the administration withdraw the policy and &quot;re-engage with stakeholders, states, and Congress&quot;.

In February 2019, Leahy and 22 other Democratic senators introduced the State Public Option Act, a bill that would authorize states to form a Medicaid buy-in program for all residents and thereby grant them the ability to buy into a state-driven Medicaid health insurance plan if they wished. Brian Schatz, a bill cosponsor, said the legislation would &quot;unlock each state&#x27;s Medicaid program to anyone who wants it, giving people a high-quality, low-cost public health insurance option&quot; and that its goal was &quot;to make sure that every single American has comprehensive health care coverage&quot;.

===Immigration===
In February 2018, after the Supreme Court declined to immediately consider the Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals program, Leahy said that Congress should have acted on immigration reform the previous year, and urged Congress to act, while admitting the Supreme Court decision had reduced pressure to pass legislation quickly.

In June 2018, Leahy, Kirsten Gillibrand, and Joni Ernst wrote a letter to United States Defense Secretary James Mattis saying they were &quot;deeply troubled by the department&#x27;s decision to send 21 active and reserve JAGs to the border on temporary orders to prosecute immigration cases&quot;, expressing the view that dispatching &quot;twenty-one trial counsel from military courtrooms to prosecute immigration cases is an inappropriate misapplication of military personnel&quot;, and urging Mattis to maintain the military lawyers within the military justice system.

In August 2018, Leahy was one of 17 senators to sign a letter to United States Secretary of Homeland Security Kirstjen Nielsen demanding that the Trump administration take immediate action in attempting to reunite 539 migrant children with their families, citing each passing day of inaction as intensifying &quot;trauma that this administration has needlessly caused for children and their families seeking humanitarian protection&quot;.

In September 2018, after nearly $10 million of the Federal Emergency Management Agency budget was transferred to US Immigration and Customs Enforcement, Leahy said in a statement, &quot;I am hopeful that the administration will see the consequences of its actions and begin to work with Republicans AND Democrats to actually address the problems in our immigration system. Fomenting fears against immigrants is not governing—it&#x27;s demagoguery on the taxpayer&#x27;s dime. It needs to stop now.&quot;

In January 2019, Leahy was one of 20 senators to sponsor the Dreamer Confidentiality Act, a bill banning the Department of Homeland Security (DHS) from passing information collected on DACA recipients to Immigration and Customs Enforcement (ICE), Customs and Border Protection (CBP), the Department of Justice, or any other law enforcement agency with exceptions in the case of fraudulent claims, national security issues, or non-immigration related felonies.

In July 2019, following reports that the Trump administration intended to cease protecting spouses, parents and children of active-duty service members from deportation, Leahy was one of 22 senators, led by Tammy Duckworth, to sign a letter arguing that the protection gave service members the ability &quot;to fight for the United States overseas and not worry that their spouse, children, or parents will be deported while they are away&quot; and that its termination would both cause service members personal hardship and negatively affect their combat performance.

===Internet privacy===
In April 2017, after President Trump signed a law undoing a Federal Communications Commission rule requiring internet service providers to obtain their customers&#x27; permission to sell their data to advertisers, Leahy was one of 11 senators to sponsor legislation undoing the repeal and reinstating the regulations.

===Iran===
In May 2018, Leahy was one of 12 senators to sign a letter to Trump urging him not to withdraw from the Iran nuclear deal, on the grounds that &quot;Iran could either remain in the agreement and seek to isolate the United States from our closest partners, or resume its nuclear activities&quot; if the U.S. pulled out and that both possibilities &quot;would be detrimental to our national security interests&quot;.

===Israel===
Leahy has signed resolutions in support of Israel&#x27;s right to self-defense, but has also been critical of alleged human rights violations in the region, especially after the 2008 Operation Cast Lead.

In 2011, Leahy initially promoted a bill to cut the military aid to three elite IDF units after reports of human rights violations during the Gaza flotilla raid and in the West Bank and Gaza Strip.

In February 2016, Leahy joined ten House of Representatives members asking the State Department to investigate suspected human rights violations by Egyptian and Israeli security forces, in particular citing claims of extrajudicial killings that could trigger the Leahy Law, which can cause the suspension of American military aid to countries guilty of such abuses.

In April 2019, after the Trump administration refused to distribute money to West Bank and Gaza &quot;because of perceived intransigence on peace talks by the Palestinians and payments to the families of those who have attacked Israelis&quot;, Leahy was one of six Democratic senators to introduce a resolution restoring U.S. humanitarian aid to the West Bank and Gaza.

In May 2020, Leahy voiced his opposition to Israel&#x27;s plan to annex parts of the occupied Palestinian territories.

===Opioids===
In March 2017, Leahy was one of 21 senators, led by Ed Markey, to sign a letter to Senate Majority Leader Mitch McConnell that said that 12% of adult Medicaid beneficiaries had some form of a substance abuse disorder, that one-third of treatment for opioid and other substance use disorders in the U.S. is financed by Medicaid, and that the American Health Care Act could &quot;very literally translate into a death spiral for those with opioid use disorders&quot; due to inadequate funding, often resulting in individuals abandoning substance use disorder treatment.

===LGBTQIA+ issues===
In October 2018, Leahy was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to reverse the rolling back of a policy that granted visas to same-sex partners of LGBTQIA+ diplomats who had unions that were not recognized by their home countries, writing that too many places around the world have seen LGBTQIA+ individuals &quot;subjected to discrimination and unspeakable violence, and receive little or no protection from the law or local authorities&quot;, and that refusing to let LGBTQIA+ diplomats bring their partners to the US would be equivalent of upholding &quot;the discriminatory policies of many countries around the world&quot;. Leahy supported the Student Non-Discrimination Act and supported an LGBTQIA+-supportive amendment in the Runaway and Homeless Youth and Trafficking Prevention Act; the former addresses bullying based on gender identity and sexual orientation, while the latter prevents shelters from discriminating based on the same. Leahy claims that both of these issues disproportionately impact the LGBTQIA+ community.

===North Korea===
In June 2018, Leahy was one of seven Democrats to sign a letter cautioning Trump that they would not support lifting sanctions against North Korea unless a nuclear agreement between it and the US met five standards outlined in the letter. In a statement after the North Korea–United States summit, Leahy commended Trump &quot;for beginning direct negotiations&quot; but added that it was troubling that Trump &quot;agreed to unilaterally halt military exercises with South Korea without verifiable commitments from North Korea to denuclearize, while giving Kim the recognition he has long craved.&quot;

===Russia===
In December 2010, Leahy voted for the ratification of New START, a nuclear arms reduction treaty between the United States and the Russian Federation obliging both countries to have no more than 1,550 strategic warheads and 700 launchers deployed during the next seven years, and providing for a continuation of on-site inspections that halted when START I expired the previous year. It was the first arms treaty with Russia in eight years.

In February 2017, Leahy was one of 11 senators to sign a letter to United States Attorney General Jeff Sessions expressing their concern &quot;about credible allegations that the Trump campaign, transition team, and Administration has colluded with the Russian government, including most recently the events leading to the resignation of Lieutenant General Michael Flynn as National Security Adviser&quot;. The senators requested the creation of &quot;an independent Special Counsel to investigate collusion with the Russian government by General Flynn and other Trump campaign, transition and Administrative officials&quot;, in order to maintain &quot;the confidence, credibility and impartiality of the Department of Justice&quot;.

===Other issues===
Leahy has consistently voted to uphold Social Security and has opposed school vouchers.

Leahy supported Joe Biden&#x27;s plan to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan.

==Honors and awards==
In 2013, Leahy received the annual U.S. Senator John Heinz Award for Greatest Public Service by an Elected or Appointed Official from the Jefferson Awards for Public Service. In 2014, the Congressional Management Foundation awarded Leahy a &quot;Silver Mouse Award&quot; for his website, and a &quot;Gold Mouse Award&quot; for his engagement on social media.

Leahy is the recipient of several honorary degrees, including:

*Saint Michael&#x27;s College, LL.D., 1976
*Middlebury College, LL.D., 2011
*Albany College of Pharmacy, D.Sc., 2013
*Green Mountain College, LL.D., 2014
*University of Portland, D.P.S., 2023
After Leahy retired from the Senate in 2023, Mayor Miro Weinberger announced that Burlington International Airport would be renamed for Leahy. Leahy expressed gratitude following the announcement, saying, &quot;I am gratified that the airport where I took my first flight as a teenager is now well-positioned for Vermont&#x27;s future.&quot;

In 2023 he was awarded an Honorary OBE from the British Government for services to UK/USA relations.

==Personal life==
===Family===
Leahy married Marcelle Pomerleau in 1962. Her parents, Louis Philippe Pomerleau and Cecile Bouchard Pomerleau, emigrated to the United States from Quebec, and she is bilingual (English and French). The extended Pomerleau family established several successful Vermont businesses, and includes her uncle Antonio Pomerleau (d. 2018), a prominent real estate developer and philanthropist. Marcelle Leahy graduated from the nursing school at Burlington&#x27;s former DeGoesbriand Hospital. She is a registered nurse and has worked at hospitals in Burlington, Washington, D.C., and Arlington, Virginia. The Leahys have resided in a farmhouse in Middlesex, Vermont, since moving from Burlington, and have three children. Their daughter Alicia is married to White House photographer Lawrence Jackson. In 2012, they celebrated their 50th wedding anniversary, with Leahy saying, &quot;We hate it when we&#x27;re apart from one another.&quot; They celebrated their 60th anniversary in August 2022, which was acknowledged by Chuck Grassley when he offered a tribute to Leahy on the Senate floor in December.

===Health===
On January 26, 2021, Leahy was hospitalized &quot;out of an abundance of caution&quot; after feeling ill. His hospitalization occurred hours after he had been sworn in as the presiding officer for Trump&#x27;s second impeachment trial. He returned home later the same day.

On June 29, 2022, Leahy fractured his hip after falling at his home in McLean, Virginia. He underwent hip replacement surgery the next day, and had a second operation related to his hip injury on July 19, 2022.

Leahy was hospitalized again on October 13, 2022, after feeling unwell. He was kept overnight for &quot;tests and observation&quot; and discharged the following day.

===Other===
Leahy is a published photographer and author. He is a Roman Catholic and attends Saint Andrew&#x27;s Church in Waterbury, Vermont. He also attends Holy Trinity Catholic Church in Washington, D.C.

===Comic book fan===
Leahy is a fan of comic books, and in particular the character Batman. He wrote the foreword to &quot;The Dark Knight Archives, Volume 1&quot; (a 1992 collection of the first four &quot;Batman&quot; comic books), the preface essay for &quot;&quot; (a 1996 graphic novel about the horrors of landmines), and the introduction to &quot;Green Arrow: The Archer&#x27;s Quest&quot; (a single-volume collection of a six-issue story arc).

Leahy has also made several cameo appearances in Batman television episodes and films, beginning with an uncredited cameo in &quot;Batman Forever&quot; (1995). He voiced a territorial governor in the &quot;&quot; episode &quot;Showdown&quot; (1995), appeared as himself in the film &quot;Batman &amp; Robin&quot; (1997), and appeared twice in Christopher Nolan&#x27;s &quot;Dark Knight&quot; Trilogy as a Wayne Enterprises board member. In &quot;The Dark Knight&quot; (2008) he appeared as a fundraiser guest who confronts the Joker. In &quot;The Dark Knight Rises&quot; (2012), he defended the legacy of the Wayne family against attempts to usurp the company by industrialist John Daggett. Leahy also appeared in &quot;Batman v Superman: Dawn of Justice&quot;, playing Senator Purrington, in a scene set during Superman&#x27;s Senate hearing which is subsequently destroyed by an explosion.

All royalties and fees from Leahy&#x27;s roles are donated to charities, primarily the Kellogg-Hubbard Library in Vermont, where he learned to read as a child.

===UVM distinguished fellow===
In March 2023, the University of Vermont (UVM) announced that Leahy had joined the university as a president&#x27;s distinguished fellow. In this position, he participates in research and academic and engagement projects he initiated while in the Senate. He has also been assigned roles as an advisor and mentor to students and faculty members, a classroom guest lecturer, and a university representative at public events. In addition, he serves as liaison between UVM and organizations and communities throughout Vermont.

In May 2023, UVM announced that it had named its Honors College for Leahy. The Honors College was founded in 2004, and is intended to host original research, innovative teaching, and student-faculty collaborations. It stresses the importance of experiential learning as a way to aid students in developing into original thinkers and compassionate leaders.

In August 2023, UVM announced that Leahy had donated his personal Senate papers. The collection of about 1,000 boxes and approximately 20 terabytes of data, will be part of UVM&#x27;s Jack and Shirley Silver Special Collections Library. After sorting and cataloguing, the Leahy Papers will be available to students, faculty, and the public.

<doc id="367105" wikidata="Q22360" url="?curid=367105" title="Lisa Murkowski">
<text>Lisa Ann Murkowski ( ; born May 22, 1957) is an American attorney and politician serving as the senior United States senator from Alaska, having held the seat since 2002. She is the first woman to represent Alaska in the Senate and is the Senate&#x27;s second-most senior Republican woman. Murkowski became dean of Alaska&#x27;s congressional delegation upon Representative Don Young&#x27;s death.

Murkowski is the daughter of former U.S. senator and governor of Alaska Frank Murkowski. She was appointed to the Senate by her father, who resigned his seat in December 2002 to become Alaska&#x27;s governor. Murkowski became the first Alaskan-born member of Congress and completed her father&#x27;s unexpired Senate term, which ended in January 2005. Before her appointment to the Senate, she had been a member of the Alaska House of Representatives since 1999. Murkowski ran for and won a full term in 2004 with 48% of the vote. After losing the 2010 Republican primary to Tea Party candidate Joe Miller, she ran as a write-in candidate and defeated both Miller and Democrat Scott McAdams in the general election. Murkowski was reelected in 2016 and again in 2022. She was vice chair of the Senate Republican Conference from 2009 to 2010 and chair of the Senate Energy and Natural Resources Committee from 2015 to 2021. She has served as vice chair of the Senate Indian Affairs Committee since 2021.

Murkowski is often described as one of the Senate&#x27;s most moderate Republicans and a swing vote. According to &quot;CQ Roll Call&quot;, she voted with President Barack Obama&#x27;s position 72.3% of the time in 2013; she was one of only two Republicans to vote with Obama over 70% of the time. She opposed Brett Kavanaugh&#x27;s Supreme Court nomination in 2018 and supported Ketanji Brown Jackson&#x27;s Supreme Court nomination in 2022. In 2021, she was one of seven Republican senators to vote to convict Donald Trump of incitement of insurrection in his second impeachment trial; the Alaska Republican Party censured her for that vote.

==Early life, education, and early career==

Murkowski was born in Ketchikan in the Territory of Alaska, the daughter of Nancy Rena (née Gore) and Frank Murkowski. Her paternal great-grandfather was of Polish descent, and her mother&#x27;s ancestry is Irish and French Canadian. As a child, she and her family moved around the state with her father&#x27;s job as a banker. She earned a B.A. degree in economics from Georgetown University in 1980, the same year her father was elected to the U.S. Senate. She is a member of Pi Beta Phi sorority and represented Alaska as the 1980 Cherry Blossom Princess. She received her J.D. degree in 1985 from Willamette University College of Law. Murkowski subsequently failed the bar exam four times in a row, passing on her fifth attempt.

Murkowski worked as an attorney in the Anchorage District Court Clerk&#x27;s office from 1987 to 1989. From 1989 to 1998, she was an attorney in private practice in Anchorage. She served on the Mayor&#x27;s Task Force for the Homeless from 1990 to 1991.

==Alaska House of Representatives==
In 1998, Murkowski was elected to the Alaska House of Representatives. Her District 18 included northeast Anchorage, Fort Richardson and Elmendorf Air Force Base (now Joint Base Elmendorf-Richardson, or JBER), and suburban parts of Eagle River-Chugiak. In 1999, she introduced legislation establishing a Joint Armed Services Committee. She was reelected in 2000 and, after her district boundaries changed, in 2002. That year she had a conservative primary opponent, Nancy Dahlstrom, who challenged her because Murkowski supported abortion rights and rejected conservative economics. Murkowski won by 56 votes. She was named as House Majority Leader for the 2003–04 legislative session. She resigned her House seat before taking office, due to her appointment by her father to the seat he had vacated in the U.S. Senate, upon his stepping down to assume the Alaska governorship. Murkowski sat on the Alaska Commission on Post Secondary Education and chaired both the Labor and Commerce and the Military and Veterans Affairs Committees. After she resigned to join the U.S. Senate, her father appointed Dahlstrom, the District Republican committee&#x27;s choice, as her replacement.

== U.S. Senate ==
=== Appointment ===
In December 2002, Murkowski—while a member of the state House—was appointed by her father, Governor Frank Murkowski, to fill his own U.S. Senate seat made vacant when he resigned from the Senate after being elected governor. The appointment caused controversy in Alaska. Many voters disapproved of the nepotism. Her appointment eventually resulted in a referendum that stripped the governor of the power to directly appoint replacement senators. Along with others eligible to be considered, future Alaska governor Sarah Palin interviewed for the seat. Murkowski was sworn in on January 7, 2003.

=== Elections ===

Murkowski has had several close challenges but has never lost a general election. She has won four full terms to the Senate; she won 48.6% of the vote in 2004, 39.5% in 2010, 44.4% in 2016 and 53.7% in 2022.

====2004====

Murkowski ran for a full Senate term against former Governor Tony Knowles in the 2004 election after winning a primary challenge by a large margin. She was considered vulnerable due to the controversy over her appointment, and polling showed the race was very close. The centrist Republican Main Street Partnership, which wanted to run TV ads for Murkowski, was told no airtime was left to buy. Near the end of the campaign, senior U.S. Senator Ted Stevens shot ads for Murkowski and claimed that if a Democrat replaced Murkowski, Alaska would likely receive fewer federal dollars. Murkowski defeated Knowles by a narrow margin.

====2010====

Murkowski faced a challenge from Joe Miller, a former U.S. magistrate judge supported by former Governor Sarah Palin, in the August 24, 2010, Republican Party primary election. The initial results showed Murkowski trailing Miller, 51–49%, with absentee ballots yet to be tallied. After the first round of absentee ballots was counted on August 31, Murkowski conceded, saying that she did not believe that Miller&#x27;s lead could be overcome in the next round of absentee vote counting. Miller received 55,878 votes to Murkowski&#x27;s 53,872.

After the primary, the Murkowski campaign floated the idea of her running as a Libertarian in the general election. On August 29, 2010, the state Libertarian Party executive board voted not to consider Murkowski as its Senate nominee.

On September 17, 2010, Murkowski said she would mount a write-in campaign for the Senate seat. Her campaign was aided in large part by substantial funding from state teachers&#x27; and firefighters&#x27; unions and Native corporations and PACs.

On November 17, 2010, the Associated Press reported that Murkowski had become only the second Senate candidate (after Strom Thurmond in 1954) to win a write-in campaign. She emerged victorious after a two-week count of write-in ballots showed she had overtaken Miller. Miller did not concede. U.S. Federal District Judge Ralph Beistline granted an injunction to stop the certification of the election due to &quot;serious&quot; legal issues and irregularities Miller raised about the hand count of absentee ballots. On December 10, 2010, an Alaskan judge dismissed Miller&#x27;s case, clearing the way for Murkowski, but on December 13, Miller appealed the decision to the Alaska Supreme Court. The state Supreme Court rejected Miller&#x27;s appeal on December 22. On December 28, Beistline dismissed Miller&#x27;s lawsuit. Governor Sean Parnell certified Murkowski as the winner on December 30.

====2016====

After securing the Republican Party nomination by a wide margin, Murkowski was again reelected to the Senate in 2016. Joe Miller, this time the Libertarian Party nominee, was again the runner-up. The election was unusual in featuring a Libertarian Party nominee who endorsed the Republican presidential nominee, Donald Trump, running against a Republican incumbent who did not. The Libertarian vice-presidential nominee, former Governor of Massachusetts Bill Weld, endorsed Murkowski, citing Miller&#x27;s support for Trump and &quot;devoted social conservative&quot; views as incompatible with libertarianism.

====2022====

In 2017, Murkowski filed to run for a fourth term in 2022. Due to her opposition to some of his initiatives, former President Donald Trump pledged in June 2020 to support a Republican challenger to Murkowski, saying: &quot;Get any candidate ready, good or bad, I don&#x27;t care. I&#x27;m endorsing. If you have a pulse, I&#x27;m with you!&quot; She was one of seven Republican senators who voted to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial in February 2021, and was the only one up for reelection in 2022. After her vote, Alaska&#x27;s GOP censured Murkowski and demanded her resignation. Despite Trump&#x27;s pledge, Senate Minority Leader Mitch McConnell signaled Republican senators&#x27; commitment to back Murkowski&#x27;s 2022 campaign. During her 2022 campaign, Murkowski was supported by Democratic colleagues, including Jeanne Shaheen, and Independent Senator Angus King.

On June 18, 2021, Trump endorsed former Alaska Department of Administration commissioner Kelly Tshibaka for the Senate in 2022, calling her &quot;MAGA all the way&quot;. Murkowski later called Tshibaka &quot;apparently... someone with a pulse&quot;, referencing Trump&#x27;s previous statement. On July 10, 2021, the Alaska Republican Party endorsed Tshibaka. Murkowski won reelection by beating Tshibaka in both the first and final round of ranked-choice voting. She received 53.7% of the vote after the ranked-choice tabulation.

=== Tenure and political positions ===
Murkowski is considered a moderate Republican. Since she was reelected in 2010, some have deemed her voting record &quot;more moderate&quot; than that of her previous years in the Senate. In 2013, the &quot;National Journal&quot; gave Murkowski a composite score of 56% conservative and 45% liberal, and ranked her the 56th most liberal and 44th most conservative member of the Senate. According to &quot;CQ Roll Call&quot;, Murkowski voted with President Barack Obama&#x27;s position 72.3% of the time in 2013; she was one of only two Senate Republicans to support Obama&#x27;s position over 70% of the time. In 2017, &quot;The New York Times&quot; arranged Republican senators by ideology and ranked Murkowski the second-most liberal Republican. According to GovTrack, , Murkowski was the second-most liberal Republican senator, to the left of all Senate Republicans except Susan Collins, and to the left of Democratic Senator Joe Manchin. According to FiveThirtyEight, Murkowski had voted in accordance with President Donald Trump&#x27;s position approximately 72.6% of the time . According to FiveThirtyEight, as of January 2023, Murkowski had voted with President Joe Biden&#x27;s position about 67% of the time. In 2023, the Lugar Center ranked Murkowski seventh among senators for bipartisanship.

In 2018, Murkowski stated her opposition to the confirmation of Justice Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court of the United States. Nevertheless, she voted &quot;present&quot; on the nomination as a favor to Senator Steve Daines, who supported the nomination but was unavailable to attend the vote because of his daughter&#x27;s wedding. In 2020, she voted against procedural motions to accelerate Amy Coney Barrett&#x27;s confirmation to that court, though she later voted to confirm Barrett. On April 7, 2022, she voted to confirm Ketanji Brown Jackson to the Supreme Court, with only two other Republicans, Collins and Mitt Romney, joining her.

In a March 2019 op-ed for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, Murkowski and Joe Manchin wrote that climate change debate in Congress was depicted as &quot;an issue with just two sides—those who support drastic, unattainable measures to reduce greenhouse-gas emissions, and those who want to do nothing&quot;, and affirmed their support for &quot;adopting reasonable policies that...build on and accelerate current efforts [and] ensure a robust innovation ecosystem.&quot;

During the first impeachment trial of Donald Trump, Murkowski called Trump&#x27;s actions &quot;shameful and wrong, but said &quot;she cannot vote to convict&quot; Trump and that his personal interests did not take precedence over those of the nation. She joined almost all Senate Republicans in voting to acquit Trump on both articles.

In December 2020, during his lame-duck period, Trump vetoed the National Defense Authorization Act for Fiscal Year 2021. The veto left new Coast Guard cutters that were scheduled to be homeported in Alaska without port facilities to maintain them. Murkowski issued a press release that said, in part, &quot;It’s incredible that the President chose to veto the annual National Defense Authorization Act, particularly because his reason for doing so is an issue not related to national defense.&quot;

After Trump supporters attacked the United States Capitol on January 6, 2021, Murkowski said Trump should resign for inciting the insurrection. With this, she became the first Senate Republican to say that Trump should leave office before Joe Biden was inaugurated. On February 13, she was one of seven Republican senators to vote to convict Trump in his second impeachment trial. That vote failed for lack of a two-thirds majority. On May 27, along with five other Republicans and all present Democrats, Murkowski voted to establish a bipartisan commission to investigate the Capitol attack. The vote failed for lack of 60 required &quot;yes&quot; votes.

Along with all other Senate and House Republicans, Murkowski voted against the American Rescue Plan Act of 2021. On September 30, 2021, she was among the 15 Senate Republicans to vote with all Democrats and both Independents for a temporary spending bill to avoid a government shutdown. On October 7, Murkowski voted with 10 other Republicans and all members of the Democratic caucus to break the filibuster of raising the debt ceiling, but also voted with all Republicans against the bill to raise the debt ceiling.

On February 5, 2022, Murkowski joined Arkansas Governor Asa Hutchinson in condemning the Republican National Committee&#x27;s censure of Representatives Adam Kinzinger and Liz Cheney for supporting and participating in the Select Committee of the U.S. House that was tasked with investigating the January 6 United States Capitol attack.

Murkowski supports the Equal Rights Amendment. In 2022, she and 11 other Senate Republicans voted for the Respect for Marriage Act. As of 2023, Murkowski supports ConocoPhillips&#x27;s controversial Willow oil drilling project on North Slope Borough, Alaska.

In 2021, when asked whether she would remain a Republican, Murkowski replied, &quot;if the Republican Party has become nothing more than the party of Trump, I sincerely question whether this is the party for me&quot;, but added, &quot;I have absolutely no desire to move over to the Democratic side of the aisle. I can&#x27;t be somebody that I&#x27;m not.&quot; In 2024, when asked if she intended to remain a Republican, Murkowski replied that she was &quot;independently minded&quot;. Asked whether that meant she might drop her party affiliation, she responded: &quot;I am navigating my way through some very interesting political times. Let&#x27;s just leave it at that.&quot; She later added that she was &quot;not attached to a label&quot; and was &quot;more comfortable with that identity [...] than with an identity […] as a Republican, as a party person&quot;, but that she would remain a registered Republican.

==Electoral history==































==Personal life==
Murkowski is married to Verne Martell. They have two sons, Nicolas and Matthew. Murkowski is Roman Catholic. As of 2018, according to OpenSecrets.org, Murkowski&#x27;s net worth was more than $1.4 million. Her sister, Carol, is married to the son of State Senator Arliss Sturgulewski, a former gubernatorial nominee.

===Property sale controversy===
In July 2007, Murkowski said she would sell back land she bought from Anchorage businessman Bob Penney, a day after a Washington watchdog group filed a Senate ethics complaint against her alleging that Penney sold the property well below market value. The &quot;Anchorage Daily News&quot; wrote, &quot;The transaction amounted to an illegal gift worth between $70,000 and $170,000, depending on how the property was valued, according to the complaint by the National Legal and Policy Center.&quot; According to the Associated Press, Murkowski bought the land from two developers tied to the Ted Stevens probe.

In 2008, Murkowski amended her Senate financial disclosures for 2004 through 2006, adding income of $60,000 per year from the sale of a property in 2003, and more than $40,000 a year from the sale of her &quot;Alaska Pasta Company&quot; in 2005.

<doc id="367106" wikidata="Q193108" url="?curid=367106" title="Tony Parker">
<text>William Anthony Parker Jr. (born 17 May 1982) is a French-American former professional basketball player and majority owner of LDLC ASVEL of the LNB Élite and the EuroLeague. The son of a basketball pro, Parker started his career at Paris Basket Racing in the French basketball league before joining the San Antonio Spurs of the National Basketball Association (NBA). He was selected by the Spurs with the 28th overall pick in the 2001 NBA draft, and quickly became their starting point guard. Parker won four NBA championships (2003, 2005, 2007, and 2014), all of which were with the Spurs. He also played for LDLC ASVEL in France during the 2011 NBA lockout, and finished his playing career after one season with the Charlotte Hornets. He retired as the ninth leading scorer and fifth leading passer in NBA playoffs history.

Parker was named to six NBA All-Star games, three All-NBA Second Teams, an All-NBA Third Team and was named MVP of the 2007 NBA Finals. He was also a member of the All-Rookie First Team and had his No. 9 retired by the Spurs. He is regarded as one of the greatest European players of all time. He is also regarded as a key figure in the Spurs success throughout the 2000s and most of the 2010s. On 13 August 2023, Parker was inducted into the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame.

While playing with the France national team, Parker was named the MVP of EuroBasket 2013, following his team&#x27;s victory over Lithuania in the final. He finished as the tournament&#x27;s top scorer, with an average of 19 points per game. In 2015, he became the all-time leading scorer in the EuroBasket competition, a record that was broken by Pau Gasol two years later.

== Early life ==

Parker was born in Bruges, Belgium, and raised in France. His father, Tony Parker Sr., an African American, played basketball at Loyola University Chicago as well as professionally in the Netherlands, in Belgium and in France. His mother, Pamela Firestone, is a Dutch model. His maternal grandmother, Jetty Baars-Wienese, is a Dutch national tennis champion (1956), whose brother and Tony&#x27;s great-uncle Jan Wienese is an Olympic gold medalist in rowing. Parker enjoyed close relationships with his brothers, and they would often attend their father&#x27;s basketball games together. At first, Parker was more interested in soccer, but after watching the evolution of Michael Jordan into a global basketball superstar during summer trips to his father&#x27;s native city of Chicago, he changed his mind. Parker&#x27;s two younger brothers were also heavily involved in basketball; T. J. and Pierre would go on to play basketball at college and professional levels. As Parker built his skill, he played the point guard position, recognizing that his speed and agility made this position ideal for him. At age 15, he became a naturalized French citizen while retaining his American nationality. He was eventually asked to attend the INSEP in Paris.

== Professional career ==

=== Paris Basket Racing (1999–2001) ===

After playing in the French amateur leagues for two seasons, Parker turned professional and signed with Paris Basket Racing in 1999 at age 17. In the summer of 2000, Parker was invited to the Nike Hoop Summit in Indianapolis. In a contest between the American and European All-Stars, Parker recorded 20 points, seven assists, four rebounds and two steals. His performance prompted a recruiting war among several colleges, including UCLA and Georgia Tech. Parker decided to forgo the NCAA and to remain in France; he spent the next year with Paris Basket Racing in the French League before entering the 2001 NBA draft.

=== San Antonio Spurs (2001–2011) ===

==== First championship (2002–2003) ====

Before the 2001 NBA draft, Parker was invited to the San Antonio Spurs&#x27; summer camp. Coach Gregg Popovich had him play against Spurs scout and ex-NBA player Lance Blanks. Parker was overwhelmed by Blanks&#x27;s tough and physical defense, and Popovich was ready to send him away after just 10 minutes. But after seeing a &quot;best of&quot; mix tape of Parker&#x27;s best plays, Popovich decided to invite Parker a second time. This time, Parker made a better impression against Blanks; the Frenchman later described Blanks as a &quot;one-man wrecking crew&quot;. But while Popovich decided that Parker was worth the gamble, the Spurs still had to hope that other teams would not pick Parker during the draft. Parker&#x27;s name was barely mentioned in the pre-draft predictions, and the point guard was drafted 28th overall by the Spurs on draft day.

After initially playing backup to Antonio Daniels, Parker became a starter and made 77 regular-season appearances in his rookie season, averaging 9.2 points, 4.3 assists and 2.6 rebounds in 29.4 minutes per game. When he played against the Los Angeles Clippers on 30 October 2001, he became the third French player to play in an NBA game, after Tariq Abdul-Wahad and Jérôme Moïso. By the end of the season, the rookie led San Antonio in assists and steals, and was named to the All-Rookie First Team for 2001–02, becoming the first foreign-born guard to earn the honor.

In 2002–03, Parker played in all 82 regular-season games as San Antonio&#x27;s starting point guard on a team that was largely revamped from previous years. He improved his regular season statistics, averaging 15.5 points per game (ppg), 5.3 assists per game (apg) and 2.6 rebounds per game (rpg). Parker&#x27;s role as the team&#x27;s playmaker was reflected in his leading the team in assists on 49 occasions. During the 2003 NBA All-Star Weekend, Parker represented the Sophomores in the Rookie Challenge, and also participated in the inaugural Skills Challenge. In the post season, the Spurs, led by Tim Duncan, defeated the New Jersey Nets 4–2 in the finals, and Parker earned his first NBA championship ring. Despite the victory, Parker struggled with inconsistent play throughout the playoffs, and was often benched in favor of more experienced guards Steve Kerr and Speedy Claxton late in the games.

==== Second championship (2003–2005) ====

Despite winning a championship with the Spurs, doubts lingered over Parker&#x27;s future. The Spurs had attempted and failed to acquire New Jersey Nets&#x27; Jason Kidd, but Parker told coach Popovich that he wanted to be San Antonio&#x27;s starting point guard. Parker played well during the regular season, recording 14.7 ppg, 5.5 apg and 3.2 rpg. However, the Spurs were defeated by the Los Angeles Lakers in the Western Conference semi-finals in the 2004 NBA Playoffs, and were denied back-to-back titles.

During the 2004–05 season, Parker recorded improved regular season statistics, tallying 16.6 ppg, 6.1 apg and a career-high 3.7 rpg. He was also ranked 13th in the league in total assists, and was third among point guards in field goal percentage. The Spurs were strong in the playoffs, and Parker was instrumental in the victories over the Denver Nuggets, Seattle SuperSonics and Phoenix Suns. However, Parker struggled in the Finals series against the Detroit Pistons. Spurs colleagues Manu Ginóbili and Brent Barry often took over playmaking duties as Parker was unable to perform as well as he did in the regular season. Nevertheless, the Spurs won their third-ever NBA championship by defeating the defending champions 4–3 in the 2005 NBA Finals.

==== Third championship (2005–2007) ====
Parker was selected for the first time in his career an NBA All-Star for the 2005–06 season as he managed 18.9 ppg and an impressive .548 in field goal percentage. Parker&#x27;s scoring average was even higher than Duncan&#x27;s, and his form propelled the Spurs to a 63–19 win–loss record and qualification for the 2006 NBA Playoffs. However, the top-seeded Spurs were again unable to win back-to-back titles as they were eliminated in the second round by the Dallas Mavericks.

On 14 February 2007, after delivering consistent numbers in the first half of the 2006–07 season, Parker was selected to play in the 2007 NBA All-Star Game as a reserve guard. With Parker operating as the starting point guard in the 2006–07 season, the Spurs qualified for the 2007 NBA Playoffs and finished second in the Southwest Division. In the Western Conference Semifinals, the Spurs met the Phoenix Suns led by two-time and reigning NBA MVP Steve Nash. After eliminating the Suns, the Spurs defeated the Utah Jazz 4–1 to win the Western Conference Finals. Parker and the Spurs went on to face the Cleveland Cavaliers and swept them 4–0 to win the 2007 NBA Finals. In this series, Parker consistently outplayed his Cavaliers counterparts Daniel Gibson and All-Defensive Team member Larry Hughes and scored a series-high 24.5 points, accompanied by a high field goal percentage of 56.8% and of 57.1% from three-point range. For his performances, he was named the 2007 NBA Finals MVP, becoming the first European-born player to receive the award.

==== Falling short and injury (2007–2011) ====
In the 2007–08 regular season, Parker recorded similar averages as the previous two seasons for points and rebounds, and slightly increased his assists per game average. The Spurs finished third in the Western Conference and faced the Phoenix Suns in the first round of the 2008 NBA Playoffs. For the third time in four years, San Antonio prevailed over Phoenix; Parker had an outstanding first-round series, averaging nearly 30 points and 7 assists a game. In the next round against Chris Paul&#x27;s New Orleans Hornets, the Spurs dropped the first two road games before responding with a strong win in the third game. In that game, Parker recorded a double-double with 31 points and 11 assists. The experienced Spurs took seven games to defeat the Hornets, but were unable to get past the Los Angeles Lakers in the Conference Finals, and the Spurs once again failed to win back-to-back NBA championships.

San Antonio got off to a rocky start in their 2008–09 NBA season, losing the first three contests. In their fourth game against the Minnesota Timberwolves, however, Parker scored a career-high 55 points to lead the Spurs to their first victory of the campaign. The Spurs recovered soon enough, and approached the All-Star break ranked second in the Conference. With Parker averaging a career-high in points per game, he was named as a reserve for the 2009 All-Star game. The Spurs were without influential shooting guard Ginóbili for much for the season, and greater responsibility fell on Parker&#x27;s shoulders. He helped lead the team to a 54–28 record and the third seed for the playoffs, In Game 4 of the first round against Dallas, Parker matched George Gervin&#x27;s franchise playoff record for points in a half with 31. However, the Spurs eventually lost 4–1, bowing out of the playoffs in the first round for the first time since 2000. Parker&#x27;s 28.6 points and 4.2 rebounds per game broke his previous playoffs career-best averages of 22.4 points and 3.7 rebounds. On 13 May 2009, he was named to the All-NBA Third Team.

With the Spurs looking to provide a more solid supporting cast in the 2009–10 season, they acquired Richard Jefferson, Theo Ratliff, Antonio McDyess, DeJuan Blair, and Keith Bogans.
Parker injured his hand during the season and missed 26 games. The Spurs qualified for the playoffs as the seventh seed, and defeated Dallas 4–2 in the first round, only to lose 4–0 to Phoenix in the next round.

In the 2010–11 season, the Spurs compiled a 12-game winning streak to go 13–2 after 15 games. The Spurs were 29–4 after 33 games—one of the ten best starts in NBA history–and led the league at 35–6 halfway through the season. Parker and the Spurs ended the regular season as the first seed in the West for the 2011 NBA playoffs, and were second in the league (to Chicago). Despite finishing with a 61–21 record, however, the Spurs could not avoid being upset in the first round, 4–2, by the eighth-seeded Memphis Grizzlies.

=== LDLC ASVEL (2011) ===

During the 2011 NBA lockout, Parker signed with LDLC ASVEL, the French basketball team in which he owns a stake. Parker&#x27;s salary was about $2,000 a month. He was quoted as saying, &quot;I&#x27;ll be playing nearly for free.&quot; He also paid his own insurance, which reportedly cost $250,000 for three months.

=== Return to San Antonio (2011–2018) ===

==== Best record in the NBA and finals upsets (2011–2013) ====
During the 2011–12 NBA season, Parker helped the Spurs reach the best record in the West for the second straight season; the team tied the Chicago Bulls for the best overall record in the league. On 4 February 2012, Parker became the all-time assist leader of the franchise with 4,477, surpassing Avery Johnson, adding 42 points in a victory against Oklahoma City Thunder. The Spurs secured their 13th straight 50 win season despite the lockout (a new NBA record), and Parker received his fourth All-Star nod. He finished fifth in MVP award voting, receiving four first-place votes. Late in the season, the Spurs signed Parker&#x27;s longtime friend Boris Diaw, who was claimed off waivers from the Charlotte Bobcats. In the 2012 NBA Playoffs, Parker averaged 20.1 points and 6.8 assists as the Spurs swept through the first two rounds, defeating the Utah Jazz and the Los Angeles Clippers. In the Western Conference Finals the Spurs faced the young Oklahoma City Thunder. After winning Game 1 and Game 2, 101–98 and 120–111 respectively, and taking a 2–0 series lead, the Spurs lost four consecutive games, thus losing the series 4–2.

In their second game of the 2012–13 season, the Spurs faced the Thunder in a rematch of the previous Western Conference Finals, and Parker hit a game-winner to secure a win for the Spurs. On 10 December 2012, Parker got his first career triple-double after 825 regular-season games against the Houston Rockets in overtime with 27 points, 12 rebounds, and 12 assists. He was the 4th player in NBA history to have gone 800 games or more into their career before their first triple-double, joining Karl Malone (860), Patrick Ewing (834), and Cedric Maxwell (824). Parker was named Western Conference Player of the Month for the month of January 2013 for leading the Spurs to a 12–3 record, and the best record in the NBA. He averaged 21.9 points per game and 7.9 assists per game that month while shooting 56.3% from the field. He became the first Spurs player to receive the honor since Tim Duncan in April 2002. On 21 May 2013, Parker recorded a career-high 18 assists to go with 15 points in the Spurs&#x27; Western Conference finals game 2 victory over the Memphis Grizzlies.

In Game 1 of the 2013 NBA Finals against the defending champion Miami Heat, Parker hit a clutch jump shot off the glass with 5.2 seconds remaining in the game, securing a 92–88 victory for San Antonio. The Spurs eventually lost the series in seven games.

==== Fourth championship (2013–2014) ====

In May 2014, Parker, alongside Manu Ginóbili and Tim Duncan, tied the record for most wins in playoffs history by a trio of players playing together; the record was previously held by the LA Lakers trio of Magic Johnson, Kareem Abdul-Jabbar and Michael Cooper at 110 wins. The Spurs went on to beat the Thunder in six games and advance to the NBA Finals for the second straight year. San Antonio would once again face the Miami Heat and would win the 2014 NBA Finals in five games. This victory gave Parker his fourth championship and the fifth championship to the Spurs.

==== Final years with Spurs (2014–2018) ====

On 1 August 2014, Parker signed a three-year, $43.3 million contract extension with the Spurs. The Spurs finished the 2014–15 season with a 55–27 record, but lost in the first round of the playoffs to the Los Angeles Clippers in seven games. Parker struggled in the playoffs due to injury and averaged 10.9 points a game on 36% shooting.

In the 2015–16 season, Parker helped the Spurs win a franchise-best 67 games while averaging 11.9 points per game. In the 2016 playoffs, the Spurs swept the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round, but were eliminated in the second round by the Oklahoma City Thunder in six games.

Heading into the 2016–17 season, Parker lost longtime teammate Tim Duncan to retirement. The Spurs finished the season with a 61–21 record, as they registered back-to-back 60-win seasons for the first time in franchise history. Parker played 63 games and averaged 10.1 points per game. In the 2017 playoffs, the Spurs were once again matched with the Memphis Grizzlies in the first round. San Antonio again defeated Memphis 4–2, with Parker averaging 16.3 points per game in the series. After scoring 18 points in Game 2 of the second round, a win against the Houston Rockets, Parker left the game with a rupture of his left quadriceps tendon that ended his season. Game 3 of the series marked San Antonio&#x27;s first postseason game without Parker since 2001, which ended an NBA record of 221 straight playoff appearances for Parker. The injury required surgery and led some to speculate Parker could miss significant time, if he came back at all.

On 27 November 2017, in a 115–108 win over the Dallas Mavericks, Parker had six points and four assists in 14 minutes in his first appearance since tearing his quadriceps tendon. On 29 November, Parker had 10 points and five assists while playing 18 minutes in his second game back. In his last season with the Spurs, Parker played 55 games and averaged a career-low 7.7 points a game. The Spurs made it to the playoffs and lost to the Golden State Warriors in 5 games in the first round.

On 11 November 2019, the Spurs retired Parker&#x27;s No. 9 jersey.

=== Charlotte Hornets (2018–2019) ===

On 23 July 2018, Parker signed a two-year contract with the Charlotte Hornets. He made his debut as a Hornets player on 17 October 2018, recording 8 points on 4/8 shooting, 7 assists, and 3 rebounds while coming off of the bench in 19 minutes of action in a 113–112 loss to the Milwaukee Bucks.

On 10 June 2019, Parker announced his retirement from the NBA. He ended his career ranked fifth in career playoff assists (1,143) and ninth in career playoff scoring (4,045).

== National team career ==
Parker played for France&#x27;s Junior National Teams at the 1997 FIBA Europe Under-16 Championship, both the 1998 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship and the 2000 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship, and the 2002 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship. He was elected the Most Valuable Player of the 2000 FIBA Europe Under-18 Championship, when France captured the gold medal, as he averaged 14.4 points and 2.5 assists per game. Parker averaged 25.8 points, 6.8 assists, and 6.8 steals per game at the 2002 FIBA Europe Under-20 Championship. With the French senior national team, Parker has played in the 2001, 2003, 2005, 2007, 2009, 2011 2013 and 2015 FIBA EuroBaskets.

France won the bronze medal in the 2005 FIBA EuroBasket, by defeating the Spanish national team 98–68 in the bronze medal game. As the captain of the French national team since 2003, Parker was slated to lead France at the 2006 FIBA World Championship, but he was unable to play after breaking a finger when he caught his hand in the jersey of a Brazilian national team player in France&#x27;s final warm-up for the tournament. During the EuroBasket 2007, Parker averaged 20.1 points per game and 2.8 assists per game in nine tournament games, but France was defeated in the quarter-finals by the Russian national team. He passed the 2010 FIBA World Championship to recover fully from some injuries he had during the 2009–10 NBA season. Parker returned to the team in 2011, and France reached the finals of the 2011 EuroBasket, losing to Spain. Parker also joined the team for the 2012 Summer Olympics in London. In 2013, Parker and the French national team won the 2013 FIBA EuroBasket tournament.

While playing for France in EuroBasket 2015, in a group game against Poland, Parker scored his 1,032nd career point in the tournament, and in doing so, he overtook Nikos Galis as the all-time leading scorer in the history of the EuroBasket competition. That record was later broken by Pau Gasol.

During the Olympic Qualifying Tournament in Manila, Philippines, in July 2016, Parker announced his intention to retire from international competition, but not the NBA, after the 2016 Summer Olympics. He reiterated that intent after France lost in the quarter-finals in Rio de Janeiro.

On 12 July 2024, the French Federation of Basketball officially retired Parker&#x27;s national team jersey number 9, ahead of a friendly game against Serbia at the LDLC Arena in Lyon. Retiring a number for a player is not a French tradition, thus, his number retirement was the first of such kind in any French sport.

== Player profile ==

Standing at 6 feet 2 inches tall (1.88 m) and weighing 185 pounds (84 kg), Parker played at the point guard position and established himself as a potent offensive player. He was voted by his peers in a 2007 poll, as one of the quickest players in the NBA, and he often slashed to the basket for a layup or teardrop shot. Despite his relatively small size for a basketball player, he led the league in &quot;points in the paint&quot; for a large portion of the 2005–06 season.

In the initial part of his NBA career, Parker was still considered an erratic shooter off the ball and during the 2005 off-season, Coach Popovich decided to work on that aspect of his play. Spurs shooting coach Chip Engelland forbade Parker to shoot any three-point shots, and among others, corrected his shooting motion and his thumb position. As a result, by the 2006–07 season, Parker had reduced his three-point shot attempts by 117, while shooting 147 more normal field goal attempts compared to 2005, and his accuracy rose by 4% (field goals and three-point shots). He was also able to connect on 78% of his free throws that season. Parker developed tendinitis in his knees early in his career.

== Off the court ==

=== LDLC ASVEL ===

In 2009, Parker bought a 20 percent stake in the French basketball club LDLC ASVEL, located in Lyon, and held the ceremonial title of Vice President of Basketball Operations. During the 2011 NBA lockout, Parker signed to play for ASVEL, for the French League&#x27;s minimum wage, until the lockout ended. In 2014, Parker became the majority shareholder of the club, and is now the president of the team.

In September 2015, Parker announced the launch of his own basketball academy in the city of Lyon. On 12 July 2016, he and his business partners published the plans for the construction of a new arena in Villeurbanne, which will become LDLC ASVEL&#x27;s new home court.

=== LDLC ASVEL Féminin ===

In March 2017, it was announced that Parker had become the majority shareholder of Lyon Basket Féminine, a member of the French women&#x27;s basketball league now known as LDLC ASVEL Féminin, and that he would also take over as chairman of the club at the conclusion of the fiscal year 2016–17.

=== Family life ===
Parker met actress Eva Longoria in November 2004. In August 2005, Longoria confirmed she and Parker were dating, and on 30 November 2006, the couple became engaged. Longoria, a Texas native from nearby Corpus Christi, was a courtside regular at Spurs home games. Parker was quoted during the 2007 NBA All-Star Game saying that, &quot;Eva is doing everything, I&#x27;m just going to show up and say yes.&quot; They were married in a civil service on 6 July 2007, at a Paris city hall. That was followed by a full Catholic wedding ceremony at the Saint-Germain l&#x27;Auxerrois Church in Paris, France, on 7 July 2007. Fellow Frenchman, NBA player and future teammate, Boris Diaw was Parker&#x27;s best man for the wedding.
On 17 November 2010, Longoria filed for divorce in Los Angeles, citing &quot;irreconcilable differences&quot; after Parker reportedly engaged in an emotional affair with the wife of his Spurs teammate Brent Barry.

Longoria sought spousal support from Parker. The couple had a prenuptial agreement that was signed in June 2007, the month before their wedding, and amended two years later in June 2009. Unlike Longoria&#x27;s divorce petition, Parker&#x27;s did not mention a prenuptial agreement and claimed that the parties &quot;will enter into an agreement for the division of their estate&quot;. The divorce was finalized in Texas on 28 January 2011, the same day Longoria&#x27;s lawyer filed papers to dismiss her Los Angeles petition.

Parker began dating French journalist Axelle Francine in 2011. In June 2013, it was reported that the couple was engaged. Parker and Axelle Francine married on 2 August 2014. They have two sons born in April 2014 and July 2016. The couple announced their separation in August 2020.

=== Philanthropy ===

During his playing career, Parker donated a block of 20 tickets for each home game to underprivileged youth. Parker is also the first ambassador for Make-A-Wish France. The Foundation is a non-profit organization that grants wishes to children with life-threatening medical conditions. On his personal website, Parker states: &quot;I already knew Make-A-Wish as it is very famous around the world and I have previously taken part in the granting of wishes by meeting children and their families. I decided to commit to working with Make-A-Wish France when I understood the true dedication there and I realized that I could help to grant as many wishes as possible.&quot;

Tony Parker has also been known for participating to other former NBA point guard Steve Nash&#x27;s foundation, and his ex-wife Eva Longoria&#x27;s NGO Eva&#x27;s Heroes.

=== Music ===

Parker is an avid enthusiast of hip-hop and rap music. He has released a French hip-hop album titled &quot;TP&quot; with producer Polygrafic (Sound Scientists). The album features collaborations with various artists including Booba, Don Choa, Eloquence, Eddie B, Jamie Foxx, K-Reen, Rickwel and Soprano. The singles taken from the album include:

* &quot;Bienvenue dans le Texas&quot;, featuring French rapper Booba and released on 17 March 2007 and made available via iTunes. This initial release did not chart in France.
* &quot;Balance-toi&quot;, which features Eva Longoria. It reached the number one position in the SNEP official French chart, staying there for one week. It also charted in the Belgian French (Wallonia) bubbling under Ultratip charts, reaching number 4.
* &quot;Premier Love&quot; (with Parker doing the French part and singer Rickwel the English part). The single made it to #11 in SNEP, the official French Singles Chart.

Other singles releases include:

* &quot;Top of the Game&quot;, featuring American rapper Fabolous and French rapper Booba. It was released in March 2007. The accompanying video features Spurs teammate Tim Duncan, as well as former teammates Robert Horry, Brent Barry, and Nazr Mohammed.

=== Other interests ===

Parker was also involved in the Paris bid for the 2012 Summer Olympics. His reaction to London&#x27;s successful bid was: &quot;I don&#x27;t know what else we could have done. If we don&#x27;t have it now, I guess we will never get it. The IOC seems to be very pro-Anglo-Saxon. I feel extremely gutted.&quot;

Parker has a well-known friendship with compatriot footballer Thierry Henry. The two were often seen together at some of Parker&#x27;s NBA games. Parker was seen with his wife at Euro 2008 during one of France&#x27;s match

In 2012, Parker and his brothers opened a nightclub, Nueve Lounge, in San Antonio. However, the business closed down within a year.

In December 2019, Parker bought a 3% stake in the Tacoma, Washington-based National Women&#x27;s Soccer League team then known as Reign FC and now as OL Reign. He acquired this interest as part of a larger transaction in which OL Groupe, the parent company of prominent French football club Olympique Lyonnais, bought an 89.5% stake in the NWSL team.

Parker was involved in the iconic Olympics torch pass during the Summer Olympics 2024 in Paris.

=== Nightclub injury ===

Parker was injured on 14 June 2012 at the W.I.P nightclub in the SoHo district of New York City when a brawl broke out between entertainers Chris Brown and Drake. Parker filed a $20 million suit against the night club. Parker risked missing the 2012 Summer Olympics after a piece of glass thrown in the fight deeply penetrated his eye, requiring surgery to remove. However, on 6 July 2012, he was cleared to participate.
=== Movies and television ===

In 2008, Tony Parker co-directed with Jean-Marie Antonini a 1-hour film, &quot;9 – Un chiffre, un homme&quot; (English: &quot;9 – a number, a man&quot;). The biographical documentary film narrated by Benoît Allemane was produced by Parker. Celebrities featured included basketball players Kobe Bryant, Tim Duncan, Sean Elliott, Magic Johnson, Michael Jordan, Steve Nash, and David Robinson, as well as footballers Thierry Henry and Zinedine Zidane, judoka David Douillet, and musician and DJ Cut Killer, as well as Parker and Eva Longoria.

<doc id="367107" wikidata="Q247900" url="?curid=367107" title="List of CAx companies">
<text>This is a list of computer-aided technologies (CAx) companies and their software products. Software using computer-aided technologies (CAx) has been produced since the 1970s for a variety of computer platforms. This software may include applications for computer-aided design (CAD), computer-aided engineering (CAE), computer-aided manufacturing (CAM) and product data management (PDM).

The list is far from complete or representative as the CAD business landscape is very dynamic: almost every month new companies appear, old companies go out of business, and companies split and merge. Sometimes some names disappear and reappear again.

<text>Euclid is a CAD software which has been developed since 1970. Initially written by Jean Marc Brun and Michel Théron at Laboratoire d&#x27;informatique pour la mécanique et les sciences de l&#x27;ingénieur (LIMSI) for modelling fluid flow, they founded their own company, Datavision in 1979, and then sold a controlling interest in 1980 to the French company Matra Datavision.

Matra then developed EUCLID QUANTUM, a new generation in 1996, on the CAS.CADE (Computer Aided Software for Computer Aided Design and Engineering) platform. As in 1998 Matra Datavision specialized in software service provider, Dassault Systèmes acquired QUANTUM products : Euclid Styler and Euclid Machinist.

In 1999 Matra Datavision published CAS.CADE in open source on the Internet as Open CASCADE later renamed to Open CASCADE Technology.

The BRL-CAD CAD software imports and exports to the EUCLID file format.

<text>John Francis Reed (born November 12, 1949) is an American lawyer and politician serving as the senior United States senator from Rhode Island, a seat he was first elected to in 1996. A member of the Democratic Party, he was the U.S. representative for from 1991 to 1997. Reed graduated from the United States Military Academy and Harvard University, serving in the U.S. Army as an active officer from 1971 to 1979. He is the dean of Rhode Island&#x27;s congressional delegation.
==Early life, education and career==
Reed was born in Cranston, Rhode Island, the son of Mary Louise ( Monahan) and Joseph Anthony Reed. Reed graduated from La Salle Academy and the United States Military Academy at West Point, where he received a Bachelor of Science degree in 1971. After graduating, he spent several years in active duty military service. Reed earned the Ranger Tab and was a paratrooper. He served as a paratrooper in the 2nd Battalion, 504th Parachute Infantry Regiment, 82nd Airborne Division where he was a platoon leader, company commander and battalion staff officer.

Reed attended the John F. Kennedy School of Government at Harvard University, where he received a Master of Public Policy. He returned to West Point in 1978 as an associate professor in the Department of Social Sciences. He left active duty in 1979 after earning the rank of captain. He served in the United States Army Reserve until 1991, and retired as a major. After leaving active duty, Reed enrolled in Harvard Law School, where he became a member of the Board of Student Advisers. In 1982, he graduated with his Juris Doctor and worked as an associate at the Washington, D.C. office of law firm of Sutherland Asbill &amp; Brennan. Afterward, he returned to Rhode Island and worked for the Providence law firm Edwards and Angell until 1990.

Reed was elected as a state senator in 1984 and served three terms.

Reed is a Roman Catholic. He married professional Senate staffer Julia Hart in a Roman Catholic ceremony in the Catholic chapel on the United States Military Academy campus on April 16, 2005. On January 5, 2007, their daughter, Emily, was born.

==U.S. House of Representatives==
In 1990, Reed was elected to the United States House of Representatives, receiving 59% of the vote in the general election. For the next six years, he focused on education and health care.

==U.S. Senate==
===Elections===

==== 1996 ====

When Senator Claiborne Pell, the longest-serving senator in Rhode Island&#x27;s history and the 13th longest-serving senator in US history, announced his retirement in 1996, Reed declared his candidacy. Reed won the Democratic primary with 86% of the vote and beat the Republican nominee, Rhode Island General Treasurer Nancy Mayer, 63% to 35%.

==== 2002 ====

Reed ran for a second term. He was unopposed in the Democratic primary and his Republican opponent was Robert Tingle, a casino pit manager and the unsuccessful Republican nominee for the state&#x27;s 2nd congressional district in 2000. Reed won by 78% to 22%.

==== 2008 ====

Reed ran for a third term. He won the Democratic primary with 87% of the vote. In the general election, he faced a rematch with Tingle, again winning in a landslide, 73% to 27%.

==== 2014 ====

Reed ran for a fourth term. Polling showed him leading prospective Republican opponents by margins of between 29% and 65%. Unopposed in the Democratic primary, Reed faced former congressional nominee and former Rhode Island Republican Party Chairman Mark Zaccaria in the general election. Reed won in another landslide, 71% to 29%.

==== 2020 ====

Reed ran for a fifth term. He won the Democratic primary unopposed. In the general election, he faced investment consultant Allen R. Waters and won in yet another landslide, 67% to 33%.

===Executive branch rumors===
In 2008, Reed was mentioned as a potential vice presidential running mate for Barack Obama. On July 14, 2008, Reed announced that he was &quot;not interested&quot; in becoming Obama&#x27;s running mate.

Reed has consistently been mentioned as a possible Secretary of Defense. In late 2010, he turned down Obama&#x27;s offer to succeed Robert Gates as Secretary of Defense. The position was ultimately filled by Leon Panetta. After Obama was reelected in 2012 and Panetta announced his decision to retire, Reed was again mentioned as a possible nominee for the position, as well as for Director of the Central Intelligence Agency. Once again, he denied interest in either position.

When Panetta&#x27;s successor Chuck Hagel announced his resignation in December 2014, Reed was again said to be on Obama&#x27;s shortlist. Despite the Republican takeover of the Senate in the 2014 elections, it was said that Reed&#x27;s confirmation would be a &quot;foregone conclusion&quot;. He again denied interest, with a spokesman saying, &quot;Senator Reed loves his job and wants to continue serving the people of Rhode Island in the United States Senate. He has made it very clear that he does not wish to be considered for Secretary of Defense or any other cabinet position. He just asked the people of Rhode Island to hire him for another six-year term and plans on honoring that commitment.&quot;

On November 24, 2014, Ted Nesi of WPRI-TV gave some reasons that Reed might be uninterested in cabinet positions, citing his &quot;safe seat&quot;, his status as one of the most popular politicians in the state, his fondness for working in the Senate and his passion for housing policy. He concluded that &quot;no matter how many times Reed&#x27;s aides privately groan about another flareup of defense secretary speculation, they surely appreciate that each recurrence is a sign of the senator&#x27;s positive reputation in Washington and Obama&#x27;s esteem for him.&quot;

===Committee assignments===
Reed&#x27;s committee assignments for the 118th Congress are as follows:
*Committee on Appropriations
**Subcommittee on Commerce, Justice, Science, and Related Agencies
**Subcommittee on Defense
**Subcommittee on Interior, Environment, and Related Agencies 
**Subcommittee on Labor, Health and Human Services, Education, and Related Agencies
**Subcommittee on the Legislative Branch (Chair)
**Subcommittee on Military Construction, Veterans Affairs, and Related Agencies
**Subcommittee on Transportation, Housing and Urban Development, and Related Agencies
*Committee on Armed Services (Chair)
**As Chair, Reed is an &quot;ex officio&quot; member of all subcommittees.
*Committee on Banking, Housing, and Urban Affairs
**Subcommittee on Financial Institutions and Consumer Protection
**Subcommittee on Housing, Transportation, and Community Development
**Subcommittee on Securities, Insurance, and Investment
*Select Committee on Intelligence (ex officio)

* Affordable College Textbook Act (S. 1864; 115th Congress)

==Political positions==
Since his election to Congress, Reed has consistently voted in a similar manner to other New England Democrats, holding generally liberal positions on social and economic issues. He has voted with his party 94.7% of the time. Reed was rated among the top ten most popular senators in a Morning Consult poll from April 2024.

===Abortion===
Reed strongly supports abortion rights, and has rejected proposals to limit late-term abortion, ban such procedures from occurring on military installations, and deny minors the right to cross state lines to obtain abortions.

===Civil rights===
Reed supports affirmative action. He has voted to expand such policies and to set aside money for women and minorities from the highway fund. He also supported LGBTQ rights, voting against a proposed constitutional amendment to ban gay marriage and in favor of measures that prevent job discrimination and hate crimes against LGBTQ people.

===Economy and jobs===
Reed has generally supported fair trade policies over similar ones advocating free trade. He voted against renewing presidential authority to &quot;fast-track&quot; normalized trade relations. Reed opposed CAFTA and similar free trade proposals for Chile, Singapore, Peru, and Oman, but voted in favor of normalizing trade relations with China. He has also been a strong supporter of unionizing workers, and has criticized government and business interference with these groups. Reed supports increasing the minimum wage and unemployment compensation.

Reed serves on the Senate Banking Committee, which has held hearings into JP Morgan Chase bank&#x27;s activities. He has accepted campaign contributions from its CEO Jamie Dimon.

=== Election security ===
In July 2019, Reed and Minnesota Senator Amy Klobuchar sent a letter to Acting Homeland Security (DHS) Secretary Kevin McAleenan requesting an explanation of the actions the DHS took in response to &quot;unexpected behavior&quot; of voting equipment in Durham County, North Carolina during the 2016 presidential election and writing that it was &quot;critical that we learn as much as we can about the extent of the attacks we faced in 2016, and that these lessons be shared as widely as possible so that our nation is fully prepared for the 2020 elections.&quot;

===Energy===
Reed supports limiting American oil use and expanding alternative energy. He opposes Arctic National Wildlife Refuge drilling and federal subsidies for oil exploration, while favoring a 40% reduction in oil use by 2025 and funding for hydrogen automobiles. Reed has voted to end discussions on Corporate Average Fuel Economy standards, and has been an outspoken proponent of stronger restrictions of mercury use, as well as an end to commercial whaling.

===Gun control===
Reed supports gun control. He supports a national assault weapon ban. Reed has voted against limiting lawsuits on gun manufacturers and has favored expanding gun control. He voted against loosening background checks at gun shows.

===Healthcare===
Reed has been an advocate of preventive healthcare. Like many other Democrats, he supports increasing Medicare funding, enrolling more Americans into programs that help the uninsured, allowing prescription drugs to be imported from Canada, and negotiating bulk medication purchases for Medicare in order to lower costs. Reed does not support Medicare for All. Instead, in 2019 he proposed the Choose Medicare Act, which he claims increases &quot;access, competition, and choice.&quot;

===Immigration===
Although he voted for the 1996 Immigration Reform Bill, Reed has generally supported allowing undocumented immigrants and foreign workers to enter the path to citizenship. He supports Guest Worker programs and giving immigrants access to Social Security. He opposed establishing English as the nation&#x27;s official language and has been critical of the effort to fence the US-Mexican border. He is the author of the Reed Amendment, which permits former U.S. citizens to be denied entry to the country if they are believed to have renounced their citizenship for tax reasons. On February 23, 2010, Reed co-sponsored the DREAM Act, a piece of legislation that would allow undocumented students living in the United States from a very young age to gain legal status.

=== LGBTQIA+ rights ===
In October 2018, Reed was one of 20 senators to sign a letter to then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo urging him to reverse the rollback of a policy that granted visas to same-sex partners of LGBTQ diplomats who had unions that were not recognized by their home countries, writing that too many places around the world have seen LGBTQIA+ individuals &quot;subjected to discrimination and unspeakable violence, and receive little or no protection from the law or local authorities&quot;, and that the US refusing to let LGBTQIA+ diplomats bring their partners to the US would be tantamount to upholding &quot;the discriminatory policies of many countries around the world.&quot;

Reed supports transgender rights. He opposes a ban in the military that prevents military recruits and transgender troops from transitioning to another gender.

===Veteran affairs===
Reed helps veterans enter the Department of Veteran Affairs, ensuring that former servicemen and servicewomen can receive medical care.

===War in Iraq===
Reed was one of 23 US senators to vote against H.J. Resolution 114, which authorized President George W. Bush to use force against Iraq in 2002. In 2007, he elaborated on his sentiments, saying, &quot;It was a flawed strategy that diverted attention and resources away from hunting down Osama bin Laden&#x27;s terrorist network.&quot; Like David Petraeus, Reed said he believed the real problems in Iraq were political and unrelated to the military.
===War in Yemen===
In 2018, Reed was one a few Democrats to support U.S. backing of the Saudi-led coalition fighting in Yemen. By 2019 he reversed his position, saying that he wanted to end U.S. support for the coalition. A network of progressive groups, including Demand Progress, Working Families Party, and Chapo Trap House, urged Reed to ensure that the 2020 National Defense Authorization Act withdrew support for the war.

===Nagorno–Karabakh conflict===
On October 1, 2020, Reed co-signed a letter to then Secretary of State Mike Pompeo that condemned Azerbaijan’s offensive operations against the Republic of Artsakh, denounced Turkey’s role in the Nagorno-Karabakh conflict and called for an immediate ceasefire. Reed said, &quot;Armenians have a right to defend themselves when attacked.&quot;

===War in Afghanistan===
Reed supported President Joe Biden&#x27;s decision to withdraw all U.S. troops from Afghanistan by September 2021. He said that &quot;the president made a difficult, but the best of many poor choices.&quot;

=== Artificial intelligence ===
In June 2024, Reed joined Senators Mitt Romney, Jerry Moran, and Angus King in proposing a framework to mitigate the existential risk from artificial general intelligence. They said the framework &quot;would apply to only the very largest and most advanced models&quot; and would guard against threats to humans posed by AI.

<text>The Austrian Federal Railways ( , formally &#x27; or &#x27; () and formerly the or BBÖ ), now commonly known as ÖBB (), is the national railway company of Austria, and the administrator of Liechtenstein&#x27;s railways. The ÖBB group is owned entirely by the Republic of Austria, and is divided into several separate businesses that manage the infrastructure and operate passenger and freight services.

The Austrian Federal Railways has had two discrete periods of existence. It was first formed in 1923, using the &quot;Bundesbahn Österreich&quot; name, as a successor to the Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways (kkStB), but was incorporated into the &quot;Deutsche Reichsbahn&quot; during the 1938–1945 Anschluss. It was reformed in 1947, under the slightly different name &quot;Österreichische Bundesbahnen&quot;, and remains in existence in this form.

Major changes currently being made to the Austrian railway network are the construction of the Koralm Railway, the Semmering Base Tunnel and the Brenner Base Tunnel connection with Italy.

Eurobarometer surveys conducted in 2018 showed that satisfaction levels of Austrian rail passengers are among the highest in the European Union when it comes to punctuality, reliability and frequency of trains. Furthermore, with their &quot;Nightjet&quot; brand, ÖBB operates Europe&#x27;s largest night train fleet.

Unlike other major railway companies in Europe that offer more flexible cancellation policies, ÖBB only offers two types of tickets: full-price tickets, and cheaper but non-exchangeable and non-refundable tickets.

==History==
*1882 – Gradual nationalisation of the railway network of the Austro-Hungarian Empire into the Imperial Royal Austrian State Railways (&quot;Kaiserlich-königliche österreichische Staatsbahnen&quot;, kkStB). By the outbreak of the World War I, the only major railway in Austria to remain in private hands was the Austrian Southern Railway (&quot;Südbahn&quot;).
* 1918 – After the break-up of the Austro-Hungarian Empire following the World War I, the Austrian rump of kkStB remained in state control under the name &quot;Deutschösterreichische Staatsbahnen&quot; (DÖStB), which was renamed the &quot;Österreichische Staatsbahnen&quot; (ÖStB) in 1919.
* 1923 – Foundation of the independent, commercial enterprise, the &quot;Bundesbahn Österreich&quot; (which used the abbreviation BBÖ, because ÖBB was already taken by the Swiss &quot;&quot;). This company took over the assets of the ÖStB and the &quot;Südbahn&quot;, together with other minor railways. 
* 1938 – The Anschluss of Austria into the Third Reich. The BBÖ was taken over by the Deutsche Reichsbahn. During World War II about 41% of the Austrian railway network was destroyed.
* 1947 – The company was reformed using the slightly different name of &quot;Österreichische Bundesbahnen&quot; and the abbreviation ÖBB (by that time the Swiss private railway used the abbreviation SP for its goods wagons in international traffic, so its abbreviation ÖBB could now be appropriated) as a state-owned company. Their infrastructure was rebuilt and electrification was accelerated.
* 1969 – A new federal railway law was enacted. The ÖBB became a non-independent, economic entity, that was run as a branch of the government&#x27;s industrial programme and remained entirely within the Federal budget.
* 1992 – The ÖBB were broken out of the federal budget and turned into company with its own legal status (a cross between a &quot;GmbH&quot; and an &quot;AG&quot; in Austrian commercial terms). The company is 100% owned by the Republic of Austria. This change had two primary aims: 1. It had to conform to EU rules on the admission of Austria into the European Union. 2. The financial demand on the public purse was to be reduced as a result of improvements in efficiency and the pressure of competition.
* 2004 – The ÖBB were reorganised into ÖBB Holding AG and a number of operating subsidiaries. The holding company was to oversee the operations of the companies assigned to it, coordinate a coherent strategic approach and allocate tasks for the whole enterprise.
* 1 January 2005 – The subsidiaries of ÖBB-Holding AG became autonomous and independent operationally. 
* In 2012, ÖBB celebrated the 175th anniversary of the &quot;Nordbahn&quot;, the earliest predecessor company marking the start of rail transport in Austria. ÖBB CEO Christian Kern inaugurated an exhibition on the company&#x27;s collaboration with Nazi Germany, named &quot;The Suppressed Years – Railway and National Socialism in Austria 1938–1945&quot;. He referred to that period as &quot;the darkest chapter of our company history,&quot; adding that the company must accept this period as part of its legacy. The exhibition later went on tour and was presented at the European Parliament&#x27;s parliamentary building in Brussels.

The Austrian rail system is largely electrified. Electrification of the system began in 1912 but did not reach an advanced state until the 1950s. The last steam locomotive in regular service on the standard gauge network was retired in 1978.

The post-war laws related to the Austrian railways were the:
* &quot;Eisenbahngesetz&quot; (EisbG 1957),
* &quot;Schieneninfrastrukturfinanzierungsgesetz&quot; (SCHIG 1999),
* &quot;Eisenbahnhochleistungsstreckengesetz&quot; (HIG 1999) and
* &quot;Bundesbahngesetz&quot; (1992).

== Logo history ==
== Current structure ==

By a law of August 2009, the organisational structure dating from 2005 was further modified; the railways are under the control of &quot;ÖBB-Holding AG&quot;, a holding company wholly owned by the Austrian state, under the Ministry of Transport.

<text>Robert Emile DeLeo (born February 2, 1966) is an American musician, best known as the bassist for rock band Stone Temple Pilots. He is part of Delta Deep and he has also played in Talk Show and Army of Anyone. He is the younger brother of Stone Temple Pilots guitarist Dean DeLeo. He is also the former bass player for the supergroup Hollywood Vampires.

==Early life==
DeLeo and his older brother Dean were both born in Montclair, New Jersey, and raised in the Jersey Shore community of Point Pleasant Beach. He graduated from Point Pleasant Borough High School in 1984.

Their older half-brother is actor Scott Marlowe.

==Career==
===Stone Temple Pilots (1985–2003, 2008–present)===
In 1985, Scott Weiland and his friends in their band Soi Disant – guitarist Corey Hicock and drummer David Allin – first encountered Deleo playing live at various gigs, deciding to track him down after witnessing his shows. Their newly formed band, who would eventually be joined by Eric Kretz and Robert&#x27;s young brother Dean played many gigs in Los Angeles bars, and were eventually signed onto Atlantic Records in 1992. However, the name &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; had already been taken, so the band was forced to change their name and tossed around ideas like &quot;Shirley Temple&#x27;s Pussy&quot; and &quot;Sticky Toilet Paper&quot; before changing it to &quot;Stone Temple Pilots&quot;, which, according to Weiland, has no specific meaning, other than that it retained the STP initials.

During their years of greatest success in the 1990s, Stone Temple Pilots came to be one of the most successful bands of the decade. DeLeo is credited with much of the band&#x27;s music, including the famous intros for the songs &quot;Plush&quot; and &quot;Interstate Love Song&quot;. Although sales of their records exceeded over 30 million, the band disbanded due to Weiland&#x27;s ongoing problems with drug abuse.

Stone Temple Pilots reunited in early 2008 and released their eponymous sixth studio album on May 25, 2010. On October 8, 2013, they released an EP entitled &quot;High Rise&quot; with new lead singer Chester Bennington of Linkin Park fame.

===Later collaborations, 1997–present===
During Stone Temple Pilots&#x27; hiatus in 1997 due to Weiland&#x27;s run-ins with the law, DeLeo, his brother Dean, and Kretz joined with singer Dave Coutts of Ten Inch Men and formed Talk Show. Released in 1997 on Atlantic Records, their eponymous debut album peaked at #131 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and was considered a commercial flop. Coutts was eventually fired and the band disbanded. Weiland went into rehab and released a solo album during this time.

After Stone Temple Pilots&#x27; break-up in 2003, DeLeo and his brother Dean joined Filter frontman Richard Patrick and drummer Ray Luzier to form the band Army of Anyone. The group met after Patrick contacted the DeLeos about writing material for Filter&#x27;s fourth album. The band eventually called in Luzier in for an audition, found the formula worked, and the band was formed. The band&#x27;s self-titled debut album was released in November 2006. The album became a critical success; some went as far to label the album as one of the best of the year. DeLeo summed up his sound on the album as follows;

However, Army of Anyone ended up going on &quot;indefinite hiatus&quot; in 2007 after low album sales and Patrick&#x27;s return to Filter.

In 2007, DeLeo played bass on songs for Japanese rock band B&#x27;z, including two on their album &quot;Action&quot;. He also contributes bass to five songs on their 2019 album &quot;New Love&quot;, including &quot;Rain &amp; Dream&quot; which also features Joe Perry.

In 2016, DeLeo appeared with Kings of Chaos.

===Solo career (2022–present)===
On September 29, 2022, DeLeo announced his debut solo album &quot;Lessons Learned&quot; and released its lead single &quot;Love is Not Made of Gold&quot;, featuring Jimmy Gnecco, the same day.

=== Equipment and style ===

DeLeo is known for his smooth style of playing, with infusions of jazz, &#x27;60s rhythm and blues, and hard rock creating a distinctive tone. His primary influence is Motown bassist James Jamerson. Other influences include John Entwistle of the Who, Rocco Prestia of Tower of Power, Chris Squire of Yes, and John Paul Jones of Led Zeppelin. 

Although he primarily uses the Schecter bass live, for recording purposes he has used a wide variety of basses, and has a fondness for oddball off-brand basses from the 1960s, particularly short-scale hollowbody basses which he strung with flat wound strings.

Stone Temple Pilots&#x27; debut album &quot;Core&quot; was recorded with a Jazz-type bass prototype version of his Schecter Model-T bass, a G&amp;L L2000, and an Ampeg SVT amplifier with an 8x10 cabinet. &quot;Purple&quot;, their second album, was recorded with his live rig. DeLeo&#x27;s usual studio rig for most of &quot;Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop&quot;, all of &quot;No. 4&quot;, and all of &quot;Shangri-La Dee Da&quot;, all by Stone Temple Pilots, was more complicated; he split his signal, bi-amping it to a &#x27;67 50-watt Marshall Plexi guitar head with &#x27;69 Marshall keyboard 8x10 cabinet, and a &#x27;59 Fender Bassman amplifier with a custom 1x15 cabinet. This configuration, which DeLeo noted in a &quot;Bass Player Magazine&quot; article as being an idea he lifted from Chris Squire of Yes, allowed him to use distorted and clean sounds simultaneously and produce more workable sounds on tape by blending the signals to taste.

== Personal life ==
DeLeo is married to Kristen and has two sons. He lives in Palos Verdes, California.

<doc id="367121" wikidata="Q317618" url="?curid=367121" title="Sam Brownback">
<text>Samuel Dale Brownback (born September 12, 1956) is an American attorney, politician, and diplomat who served as a United States senator from Kansas from 1996 to 2011 and as the 46th governor of Kansas from 2011 to 2018. A member of the Republican Party, Brownback also served as the United States Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom during the administration of President Donald Trump and was a candidate for the Republican nomination for President in 2008.

Born in Garnett, Kansas, Brownback grew up on a family farm in Parker, Kansas. He graduated from Kansas State University with a degree in agricultural economics in 1978 and received a J.D. from the University of Kansas in 1982. He worked as an attorney in Manhattan, Kansas, before being appointed Secretary of Agriculture of Kansas in 1986 by Democratic governor John W. Carlin. Brownback ran for Congress in 1994 and defeated Carlin in the general election in a landslide. He represented Kansas&#x27;s 2nd congressional district for a single term before running in a 1996 special election for the U.S. Senate seat previously held by Bob Dole. He won the election and was reelected by large margins in 1998 and 2004. Brownback ran for president in 2008, but withdrew before the primaries began and endorsed eventual Republican nominee John McCain.

Brownback declined to run for reelection in 2010, instead running for governor. He was elected governor of Kansas in 2010 and took office in January 2011. As governor, Brownback signed into law one of the largest income tax cuts in Kansas history, known as the Kansas experiment. The tax cuts caused state revenues to fall by hundreds of millions of dollars and created large budget shortfalls. A major budget deficit led to cuts in areas including education and transportation. In a repudiation of the Patient Protection and Affordable Care Act, in 2013 Brownback turned down a $31.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to set up a public health insurance exchange for Kansas. Also in 2013, he signed a bill that blocked tax breaks for abortion providers, banned sex-selection abortions, and declared that life begins at fertilization. In the run-up to the 2014 gubernatorial election, over 100 former and current Kansas Republican officials criticized Brownback&#x27;s leadership and endorsed his Democratic opponent, Paul Davis. Despite this, Brownback was narrowly reelected. In June 2017, the Kansas Legislature repealed Brownback&#x27;s tax cuts, overrode Brownback&#x27;s veto of the repeal, and enacted tax increases. Brownback left office as one of the least popular governors in the country.

On July 26, 2017, the Trump administration announced that Brownback would be nominated as the new U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom. Brownback was confirmed in January 2018 in a party-line vote; Vice President Mike Pence cast the necessary tie-breaking votes to end a filibuster and to confirm his nomination. Brownback resigned as governor of Kansas effective January 31, 2018, and was sworn in as U.S. Ambassador at Large for International Religious Freedom on February 1, 2018. His ambassadorial tenure ended in January 2021.

==Early life and education==
Sam Brownback was born on September 12, 1956, in Garnett, Kansas, to Nancy (Cowden) and Glen Robert Brownback. He was raised in a farming family in Parker, Kansas. Some of Brownback&#x27;s German-American ancestors settled in Kansas after leaving Pennsylvania following the Civil War. Throughout his youth, Brownback was involved with the FFA (formerly the Future Farmers of America), serving as president of his local and state FFA chapters, and as national FFA vice president from 1976 to 1977.

After graduating from Prairie View High School, Brownback attended Kansas State University, where was elected student body president and became a member of the Alpha Gamma Rho agricultural fraternity. After graduating from college in 1978 with a degree in Agricultural Economics in 1978, he spent about a year working as a radio broadcaster for the now-defunct KSAC farm department, hosting a weekly half-hour show. Brownback received his J.D. from the University of Kansas in 1982.

==Early career==
Brownback was an attorney in Manhattan, Kansas, before being appointed as Kansas Secretary of Agriculture by Governor John W. Carlin on September 18, 1986. In 1990, he was accepted into the White House Fellow program and detailed to the Office of the U.S. Trade Representative from 1990 to 1991. Brownback returned to Kansas to resume his position as Secretary of Agriculture. He left his post on July 30, 1993. He was elected to the U.S. House of Representatives in 1994 and ran in the 1996 special election for the U.S. Senate seat recently vacated by Bob Dole.

==U.S. Senator (1996–2011)==

===Elections===
Sheila Frahm was appointed to fill the seat of U.S. senator Bob Dole when Dole resigned in 1996 to campaign for president. Brownback defeated Frahm in the 1996 Republican primary and went on to win the general election against Democrat Jill Docking by 112,677 votes. In 2001, the Federal Election Commission assessed fines and penalties against Brownback&#x27;s campaign committee and against his in-laws for improper 1996 campaign contributions. As a result of these improper contributions, the campaign was ordered to pay the government $19,000 and Brownback&#x27;s in-laws, John and Ruth Stauffer, were ordered to pay a $9,000 civil penalty for improperly funneling contributions through Triad Management Services.

In 1998, Brownback was elected to a full six-year term, defeating Democrat Paul Feleciano by 244,921 votes. He won reelection in the 2004 Senate election defeating Democratic former lobbyist Lee Jones by 470,526 votes.

Throughout his U.S. Senate career, his principal campaign donors were the Koch brothers of Wichita-based Koch Industries, who donated more to Brownback than to any other political candidate during this period.

===Tenure===

Brownback was a member of the Judiciary Committee, the Appropriations Committee (where he chaired the Subcommittee on District of Columbia when the Republicans were in the majority), the Joint Economic Committee, and the Commission on Security and Cooperation in Europe, also known as the Helsinki Commission, which he at one time chaired. The Helsinki Commission monitors compliance with international agreements reached in cooperation with Organization for Security and Co-operation in Europe.

In 2000, Brownback and Congressman Chris Smith led the effort to enact the Trafficking Victims Protection Act. President Clinton signed the legislation in October 2000. According to &quot;Christianity Today&quot;, the stronger enforcement increased the number of U.S. federal trafficking cases eightfold in the five years after enactment.

By August 12, 2007, in the 110th Session of Congress, Brownback had missed 123 votes due to campaigning (39.7 percent)–surpassed only by Tim Johnson (D) of South Dakota who due to a critical illness had missed 100% of the votes of the 110th Session, and John McCain (R) of Arizona with 149 votes missed due to campaigning (48.1 percent).

In 2006, Brownback blocked a confirmation vote on a George W. Bush federal appeals court nominee from Michigan, judge Janet T. Neff. He objected to her joining the bench solely because she attended a same-sex commitment ceremony in Massachusetts in 2002 that involved a next-door neighbor who was a close childhood friend of Neff&#x27;s daughters. Brownback&#x27;s action blocked confirmation votes on an entire slate of appointments that had been approved by a bipartisan group of senators. In July 2007, Brownback lifted the block that had prevented the vote, and the Senate confirmed Neff by an 83–4 vote. Brownback was joined in opposition by just three other conservatives, then-Senators Jim Bunning, Jon Kyl, and Mel Martinez.

In the mid-1990s, Brownback hired Paul Ryan as his chief legislative director. Ryan later became a member of Congress, vice-presidential candidate, and Speaker of the U.S. House of Representatives.

===CREW complaints===

In 2009, Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) filed an ethics complaint over a fundraising letter signed by Brownback for a conservative Catholic group which they alleged violated Senate rules by mimicking official Senate letterhead. The letter had targeted five senators for being both Catholic and pro-choice: Maria Cantwell, John Kerry, Robert Menendez, Barbara Mikulski, and Patty Murray. A spokesman said Brownback had asked the group to stop sending the letter even before the complaint was filed.

In 2010, CREW lodged an ethics complaint claiming a possible violation of the Senate&#x27;s gifts rule by four senators and four congressmembers. The congressmembers lived in a $1.8 million Washington, D.C. townhouse owned by C Street Center, Inc., which was in turn owned by Christian-advocacy group The Fellowship. CREW alleged that the property was being leased exclusively to congressional members, including Brownback, and that the tenants were paying rent that was below market value. Senator Tom Coburn&#x27;s spokesman asserted that the rents charged were fair.

==2008 presidential campaign==
On December 4, 2006, Brownback formed an exploratory committee, the first step toward a presidential candidacy. In reporting on his potential candidacy, &quot;CNN&quot; and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called Brownback a &quot;favorite&quot; of the religious right; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; called him &quot;God&#x27;s senator&quot; in 2006. His views placed him in the socially conservative wing of the Republican Party, and he stressed his fiscal conservatism as well. &quot;I am an economic, a fiscal, a social and a compassionate conservative&quot;, he said in December 2006.

On January 20, 2007, in Topeka, Brownback announced that he was running for president in 2008. On February 22, 2007, a poll conducted by Rasmussen Reports held that three percent of likely primary voters would support Brownback.

On August 11, 2007, Brownback finished third in the Ames Straw Poll with 15.3% of all votes cast. Fundraising and visits to his website declined dramatically after this event, as many supporters had predicted Brownback would do much better, and speculation began that the candidate was considering withdrawing from the campaign. This sentiment increased after his lackluster performance in the GOP presidential debate of September 5, broadcast from New Hampshire by Fox News Channel. He dropped out of the race on October 18, 2007, citing a lack of funds. Brownback formally announced his decision on October 19. He later endorsed John McCain for president.

==Governor of Kansas (2011–2018)==
===Elections===
====2010 gubernatorial election====

In 2008, Brownback acknowledged he was considering running for governor in 2010. In January 2009, Brownback officially filed the paperwork to run for governor.

His principal Senate-career campaign donors, the Koch brothers (and their Koch Industries), again backed Brownback&#x27;s campaign.

Polling agency Rasmussen Reports found that Brownback led his then-likely Democratic opponent, Tom Holland, by 31 points in May 2010.

On June 1, 2010, Brownback named Kansas state senator Jeff Colyer as his running mate.

On November 2, 2010, Brownback defeated Holland, by 260,594 votes. He succeeded Governor Mark Parkinson, who was sworn in after former governor Kathleen Sebelius resigned from her position and became U.S. Secretary of Health and Human Services in 2009.

====2014 gubernatorial election====
In October 2013, Kansas state representative Paul Davis, the Democratic minority leader of the Kansas House of Representatives, announced he would challenge Brownback in the 2014 Kansas gubernatorial election.

In July 2014, more than 100 current and former Kansas Republican officials (including former state party chairmen, Kansas Senate presidents, Kansas House speakers, and majority leaders) endorsed Democrat Davis over Republican Brownback, citing concern over Brownback&#x27;s deep cuts in education and other government services, as well as the tax cuts that had left the state with a major deficit.

Tim Keck, chief of staff of Brownback&#x27;s running mate, Lt. Governor Jeff Colyer, unearthed and publicized a 1998 police report showing that Davis, 26 and unmarried at the time, had been briefly detained during the raid of a strip club. Davis was found to have no involvement in the cause for the raid, and was quickly allowed to leave. Responding to criticism of Keck&#x27;s involvement in the campaign, Brownback spokesman John Milburn commented that it was legal to use taxpayer-paid staff to campaign. Media law experts expressed amazement when they learned that the Montgomery County&#x27;s sheriff released non-public investigative files from 1998 in response to a mere request. Brownback&#x27;s campaign capitalized on the 16-year-old incident.

Brownback was reelected with a plurality, defeating Davis by 32,096 votes.

===Tenure===
Brownback took office in January 2011, in the early years of national recovery from the Great Recession. Also in 2011, Republicans resumed control of the Kansas House of Representatives with their largest majority in half a century. Most Republicans in the Kansas Legislature were members of the Tea Party movement who shared Brownback&#x27;s conservative views.

Two of Brownback&#x27;s major stated goals were to reduce taxes and to increase spending on education.

By April 2012, Brownback had an approval rating of 34 percent according to a Survey USA Poll. A Republican polling company found his approval rating to be 51 percent in May 2012. In November 2015, Brownback had an approval rating of 26 percent according to a Morning Consult poll, the lowest among all governors in the United States. Three separate polls between November 2015 and September 2016 ranked Brownback as the nation&#x27;s least-popular governor—a September 2016 poll showing an approval rating of 23%. In the state elections of 2016—seen largely as a referendum on Brownback&#x27;s policies and administration—Brownback&#x27;s supporters in the legislature suffered major defeats. In 2017 after a protracted battle, the new Kansas Legislature overrode Brownback&#x27;s vetoes, voting to repeal his tax cuts and enact tax increases.

Brownback, who had a 66% disapproval rating after the repeal of his signature law, left office in 2018 as one of the least popular governors in the country.

&quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; was named a finalist in the Public Service category for a 2018 Pulitzer Prize due to its series entitled &quot;Why, so secret, Kansas?&quot; The &quot;Star&quot; reported that Kansas&#x27;s already-secretive state government had only grown worse under Brownback.

====Legislative agenda====
Brownback proposed fundamental tax reform to encourage investment and generate wealth while creating new jobs. Consistent with those objectives, he also proposed structural reforms to the state&#x27;s largest budget items, school finance, Medicaid, and Kansas Public Employees Retirement System (KPERS), which have unfunded liabilities of $8.3 billion. Brownback sought to follow a &quot;red state model&quot;, passing conservative social and economic policies.

====Taxes====

As governor, Brownback initiated what he called a &quot;red-state experiment&quot;—dramatic cuts in income tax rates intended to bring economic growth. In May 2012, Brownback signed into law one of the largest income tax cuts in Kansas&#x27; history—the nation&#x27;s largest state income tax cut (in percentage) since the 1990s. Brownback described the tax cuts as a live experiment: 

The legislation was crafted with help from his Budget Director (former Koch brothers political consultant Steven Anderson); the Koch-sponsored American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC); and Arthur Laffer, a popular supply-side economist and former economic adviser for President Ronald Reagan.

The law eliminated non-wage income taxes for the owners of 191,000 businesses, and cut individuals&#x27; income tax rates. The first phase of his cuts reduced the top Kansas income-tax rate from 6.45 percent down to 4.9 percent, and immediately eliminated income tax on business profits from partnerships and limited liability corporations passed through to individuals. The income tax cuts would provide 231 million in tax reductions in its first year, growing to 934 million after six years. A forecast from the Legislature&#x27;s research staff indicated that a budget shortfall will emerge by 2014 and will grow to nearly 2.5 billion by July 2018. The cuts were based on model legislation published by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).

In a May 2014 &quot;Wall Street Journal&quot; op-ed entitled &quot;A Midwest Renaissance Rooted in the Reagan Formula&quot;, Brownback compared his tax policies with those of Ronald Reagan. Brownback anticipated a &quot;prosperous future&quot; for Kansas, Oklahoma and Missouri because they had enacted policies based on economic principles that Reagan laid out in 1964.

The act was criticized by law professor Martin B. Dickinson of Kansas University for shifting the tax burden from wealthy Kansans to low- and moderate-income workers, with the top income tax rate dropping by 25%. Under Brownback, Kansas also lowered the sales tax and eliminated a tax on small businesses. The tax cuts helped contribute to Moody&#x27;s downgrading of the state&#x27;s bond rating in 2014. They also contributed to the S&amp;P Ratings&#x27; credit downgrade from AA+ to AA in August 2014 due to a budget that analysts described as structurally unbalanced. As of June 2014, the state had fallen far short of projected tax collections, receiving $369 million instead of the planned-for $651 million.

The tax cuts and their effect on the economy of Kansas received considerable criticism in the media. Critics of the tax cuts included Michael Hiltzik of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the editorial board of &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, &quot;The New Republic&quot;, and Bloomberg &quot;Businessweek&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Brownback&#x27;s policies as &quot;too far to the right&quot;. Grover Norquist of Americans for Tax Reform defended the tax cuts as a model for the nation.

In February 2017, a bi-partisan coalition presented a bill that would repeal most of Brownback&#x27;s tax overhaul to make up for the budget shortfall. The Senate passed SB 30 (38–0, with 2 not voting) on February 2, 2017. The House passed SB 30 as amended (123–2) on February 22, 2017. The Conference Committee Report was adopted by both the House (69–52) and Senate (26–14) on June 5, 2017. On June 6, 2017, the bill was sent to Brownback for signature, but he vetoed the bill. Later in the day both the House and Senate voted to override the veto. Senate Bill 30 repealed most of the tax cuts which had taken effect in January 2013.

Brownback&#x27;s tax overhaul was described in a June 2017 article in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; as the United States&#x27; &quot;most aggressive experiment in conservative economic policy&quot;. The drastic tax cuts had &quot;threatened the viability of schools and infrastructure&quot; in Kansas.

====Education====
In April 2014, Brownback signed a controversial school finance bill that eliminated mandatory due process hearings, which were previously required to fire experienced teachers. According to the &quot;Kansas City Star&quot;: The resulting cuts in funding caused districts to shut down the school year early.

====Economy====
According to the Bureau of Economic Analysis, during the period from 2008 to 2018 (Brownback was governor from 2011 to 2018), Kansas averaged an annual GDP growth rate of 0.9% -- exactly half the national average. During that same period — when national employment increased and wages rose — job growth in Wichita (Kansas&#x27; largest city, and hometown of Brownback&#x27;s principal funders, the Koch family) dropped 3.2%, and the city&#x27;s average annual wages stagnated.

In 2015, the job growth rate in Kansas was 0.8 percent, among the lowest rate in America with only &quot;10,900 total nonfarm jobs&quot; added that year. Kansas had a $350 million budget shortfall in February 2017. In February 2017, S&amp;P downgraded Kansas&#x27; credit rating to AA−.

Despite Kansas&#x27; major role in the aerospace, telecommunications and GPS technology industries, a 2019 report from the KC Tech Council reported that Kansas growth in tech jobs ranked next-to-last in the nation — losing 220 tech jobs between 2017 and 2018 (Brownback&#x27;s final year as governor), according to the Computing Technology Industry Association — while over 40 other states grew tech employment. Despite slowing the rates of decline following the Great Recession, 59% of telecommunications jobs in the Kansas City telecommunications industry — and 600 jobs in Wichita&#x27;s (aerospace-dominated) manufacturing industry — were lost during the Brownback administration.

By the last year of the Brownback administration, 2018, Kansas had the second-highest farm-bankruptcy rate increase in the nation (after New York) — a decade-high rate for the state.

====Health care====
In August 2011, over the objections of Republican Kansas Insurance Commissioner Sandy Praeger, Brownback announced he was declining a $31.5 million grant from the U.S. Department of Health and Human Services to set up an insurance exchange as part of the federal health care reform law. In May 2011, Brownback had directed the state&#x27;s insurance commissioner to slow the implementation timeline for the exchange development. Upon announcing the refusal of the budgeted grant money for the state, his office stated: The move was unanimously supported by the delegates of the state party central committee at its August 2011 meeting, but a &quot;New York Times&quot; editorial criticized Brownback for turning down the grant which could have helped ease the state&#x27;s own budget: 

Brownback also signed into law the Health Care Freedom Act, based on model legislation published by the American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC).

====Abortion====

Brownback signed three anti-abortion bills in 2011. In April 2011, he signed a bill banning abortion after 21 weeks, and a bill requiring that a doctor get a parent&#x27;s notarized signature before providing an abortion to a minor. In May 2011, Brownback approved a bill prohibiting insurance companies from offering abortion coverage as part of general health plans unless the procedure is necessary to save a woman&#x27;s life. The law also prohibits any health-insurance exchange in Kansas established under the federal Affordable Care Act from offering coverage for abortions other than to save a woman&#x27;s life.

A Kansas budget passed with Brownback&#x27;s approval in 2011 blocked Planned Parenthood of Kansas and Mid-Missouri from receiving family planning funds from the state. The funding amounted to about $330,000 a year. A judge has blocked the budget provision, ordered Kansas to begin funding the organization again, and agreed with Planned Parenthood that it was being unfairly targeted. In response, the state filed an appeal seeking to overturn the judge&#x27;s decision. Brownback has defended anti-abortion laws in Kansas, including the Planned Parenthood defunding. &quot;You can&#x27;t know for sure what all comes out of that afterwards, but it was the will of the Legislature and the people of the state of Kansas&quot;, Brownback said.

In May 2012, Brownback signed the Health Care Rights of Conscience Act, which &quot;will allow pharmacists to refuse to provide drugs they believe might cause an abortion&quot;.

In April 2013, Brownback signed a bill that blocked tax breaks for abortion providers, banned sex-selection abortions and declared that life begins at fertilization. The law notes that any rights conferred by it are subject to limits set forth in applicable U.S. Supreme Court decisions.

On April 7, 2015, Brownback signed The Unborn Child Protection From Dismemberment Abortion Act, which bans the most common technique used for second-trimester abortions. Kansas became the first state to ban the procedure.

====Prayer rally====
Brownback attended Texas governor Rick Perry&#x27;s prayer event in August 2011. Aside from Gov. Perry himself, Brownback was the only U.S. governor who attended. About 22,000 people attended the rally, and Brownback and Perry were the only elected officials to speak. Brownback&#x27;s participation in the rally resulted in some controversy, and editorials published in &quot;The Winfield Daily Courier&quot; and &quot;The Kansas City Star&quot; expressed disappointment.

==U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom==

===Nomination and confirmation===
In March 2017, it was reported that Brownback was being considered by President Donald Trump to be appointed either as his U.S. Ambassador to the U.N. for Food and Agriculture in Rome, or as the U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom in Washington, DC. On July 26, 2017, the White House issued a statement that Brownback would be nominated as the new U.S. Ambassador-at-Large for International Religious Freedom. As a senator in 1998, Brownback sponsored the legislation that first created the United States Commission on International Religious Freedom (USCIRF).

Due to his positions and actions on Islam and LGBT issues, Brownback&#x27;s nomination was criticized by figures such as Rabbi Moti Rieber, the executive director of Kansas Interfaith Action, Robert McCaw, director of government affairs for the Council on American-Islamic Relations (CAIR), as well as the American Civil Liberties Union.

As of the end of the 2017 session, Brownback&#x27;s Ambassadorial nomination had not come up for a confirmation vote. As it failed to receive unanimous support for it to carry over to 2018 for approval, it required renomination to come to a vote. He was renominated on January 8, 2018.

On January 24, 2018, the Senate voted along party lines, 49–49, with two Republicans absent, to advance his nomination to the floor, with Vice President Mike Pence casting the tie-breaking vote to end the Democrats&#x27; filibuster. With the Senate again locked at 49–49 later that day, Pence again cast the tie-breaking vote, confirming the nomination. On January 25, Brownback submitted his resignation as governor. Brownback&#x27;s resignation was effective January 31, 2018, on which date Lieutenant Governor Jeff Colyer was sworn in as governor.

===Tenure===
Brownback was sworn in on February 1, 2018. He became the first Catholic to serve in the role.
In July 2018, Brownback reportedly lobbied the UK government over the treatment of far-right British activist Tommy Robinson. Arizona Republican representative Paul Gosar and five other congressmen invited Robinson to speak to United States Congress on November 14, 2018, on a trip sponsored by the U.S.-based, Middle East Forum. He was expected to get visa approval by the State Department despite his criminal convictions and use of fraudulent passports to enter and depart the U.S.

Brownback&#x27;s tenure as ambassador ended on January 20, 2021.

=== Issues ===
Brownback promoted religious freedom as a means of promoting individual and economic flourishing and reducing terrorism and other types of religion-related violence.

Brownback repeatedly condemned China&#x27;s record on religious freedom, saying, &quot;China is at war with faith. It is a war they will not win&quot;. He highlighted China&#x27;s persecution of Uyghurs, Tibetan Buddhists, Falun Gong practitioners, and Chinese Christians. In remarks made at the United Nations, Brownback strongly condemned the Xinjiang internment camps where more than one million Uyghurs are reported to have been detained. On July 13, 2020, Brownback, along with three other U.S. politicians, was sanctioned by the Chinese government for &quot;interfering in China’s internal affairs&quot; through their condemnation of human rights abuses in Xinjiang.

In his first trip as Ambassador, Brownback traveled to Bangladesh to meet with Rohingya refugees from Myanmar at the Kutupalong refugee camp near Cox&#x27;s Bazar, Bangladesh. Brownback stated that the accounts of violence he heard were as bad as anything he had ever seen, including in his visits to Darfur, Sudan in 2004. Following the trip, the State Department highlighted Myanmar&#x27;s intensification of violence against its ethnic minorities. In the 2017 International Religious Freedom Report, the State Department described the violence against the Rohingya that forced an estimated 688,000 people to flee Myanmar as &quot;ethnic cleansing.&quot;

At the 2020 Ministerial to Advance Freedom of Religion or Belief in Poland, Brownback spoke about COVID-19&#x27;s effect on freedom of religion.

==Positions==

===Abortion===
Brownback opposes abortion. He was personally anti-abortion though politically pro-choice during his early career. In 2007, Brownback said that he saw abortion &quot;as the lead moral issue of our day, just like slavery was the lead moral issue 150 years ago.&quot; On May 3, 2007, when asked his opinion of repealing &quot;Roe v. Wade&quot;, Brownback said, &quot;It would be a glorious day of human liberty and freedom.&quot;

In 2007, Brownback said he &quot;could support a pro-choice nominee&quot; to the presidency because &quot;this is a big coalition party.&quot;

===Arts===
In May 2011, Brownback eliminated by executive order and then vetoed government funding for the Kansas Arts Commission in response to state defiance of his executive order, making Kansas the first state to de-fund its arts commission. The National Endowment for the Arts informed Kansas that without a viable state arts agency, it would not receive a planned $700,000 federal grant. Brownback has said he believes private donations should fund arts and culture in the state. He created the Kansas Arts Foundation, an organization dedicated to private fundraising to make up the gap created by state budget cuts.

===Capital punishment===
Brownback said in an interview: &quot;I am not a supporter of a death penalty, other than in cases where we cannot protect the society and have other lives at stake.&quot; In a speech on the Senate Judiciary Committee, he questioned the current use of the death penalty as potentially incongruent with the notion of a &quot;culture of life&quot;, and suggested it be employed in a more limited fashion.

===Darfur===
Brownback visited refugee camps in Sudan in 2004 and returned to write a resolution labeling the Darfur conflict as genocide, and has been active on attempting to increase U.S. efforts to resolve the situation short of military intervention. He is an endorser of the Genocide Intervention Network, which called him a &quot;champion of Darfur&quot; in its Darfur scorecard, primarily for his early advocacy of the Darfur Peace and Accountability Act.

===Economic issues===

As governor he urged a flattening of the income tax to spur economic growth in Kansas. In December 2005, Brownback advocated using Washington, DC, as a laboratory for a flat tax.

===Evolution===
Brownback has stated that he is a devout believer in a higher power and rejects macroevolution as an exclusive explanation for the development over time of new species from older ones. Brownback favors giving teachers the freedom to use intelligent design to critique evolutionary theory as part of the Teach the Controversy approach:

Brownback spoke out against the denial of tenure at Iowa State University to astronomer Guillermo Gonzalez, a proponent of intelligent design, saying &quot;such an assault on academic freedom does not bode well for the advancement of true science.&quot;

===Health care===
Brownback opposes government-funded elective abortions in accordance with the Hyde Amendment. He has been a strong supporter of legislation to establish a national childhood cancer database and an increase in funding for autism research. Brownback supports negotiating bulk discounts on Medicare drug benefits to reduce prices. In 2007, Senators Brownback and Sherrod Brown (D-OH) sponsored an amendment to the Food and Drug Administration Amendments Act of 2007. The amendment created a prize as an incentive for companies to invest in new drugs and vaccines for neglected tropical diseases. It awards a transferable &quot;Priority Review Voucher&quot; to any company that obtains approval for a treatment for a neglected tropical disease. The prize was initially proposed by Duke University faculty Henry Grabowski, Jeffrey Moe, and David Ridley in their 2006 &quot;Health Affairs&quot; paper: &quot;Developing Drugs for Developing Countries.&quot;

Brownback has supported a bill that would introduce price transparency to the U.S. health care industry, as well as a bill which would require the disclosure of Medicare payment rate information.

On December 16, 2006, Brownback gave an interview to the &quot;Christian Post&quot;, stating: &quot;We can get to this goal of eliminating deaths by cancer in ten years.&quot;

===Immigration===

==== Senate record ====
Brownback had a Senate voting record that has tended to support higher legal immigration levels and strong refugee protection. Brownback was cosponsor of a 2005 bill of Ted Kennedy and John McCain&#x27;s which would have created a legal path to citizenship for millions of illegal immigrants already present. On June 26, 2007, Brownback voted in favor of S. 1639, the Comprehensive Immigration Reform Act. Brownback supports increasing numbers of legal immigrants, building a fence on Mexican border, and the reform bill &quot;if enforced.&quot;
While he initially supported giving guest workers a path to citizenship, Brownback eventually voted &quot;Nay&quot; on June 28, 2007. Brownback has said that he supports immigration reform because the Bible says to welcome the stranger.

==== Record as governor ====
On April 25, 2016, Brownback issued executive orders barring state agencies from facilitating refugee resettlement from Syria and other majority-Muslim countries, in concert with the federal Office of Refugee Resettlement (ORR). He maintained they presented security risks, and his decision entirely removed Kansas from the program. The ORR served notice that it would instead work directly with local refugee resettlement organizations. Kansas was the first state to withdraw from the federal refugee resettlement program.

As a result of Brownback&#x27;s action, Kansas lost about $2.2 million annually that had been provided to support resettlement agencies. The state had been working with three such agencies, among them Catholic Charities of Northeast Kansas, in making appropriate placements. In the seven months preceding his order, 354 refugees were resettled in Kansas, with 13 Syrians placed in the Wichita or Kansas City areas in the previous 16 months. Representative Jim Ward from Wichita called Brownback&#x27;s announcement &quot;a distraction&quot;, intended solely for political purposes, as Kansas faced a $290 million budget deficit.

===Iraq===

Brownback supported a political surge coupled with the military surge of 2007 in Iraq and opposed the Democratic Party&#x27;s strategy of timed withdrawal:

In May 2007, Brownback stated: &quot;We have not lost war; we can win by pulling together&quot;. He voted Yes on authorizing use of military force against Iraq, voted No on requiring on-budget funding for Iraq, not emergency funding and voted No on redeploying troops out of Iraq by July 2007. He has also condemned anti-Muslim bigotry in name of anti-terrorism.

On June 7, 2007, Brownback voted against the Habeas Corpus Restoration Act of 2007 when that bill came up for a vote in the Senate Judiciary Committee, on which Brownback sits. (The bill was passed out of the committee by a vote of 11 to 8.) The bill aims to restore habeas corpus rights revoked by the Military Commissions Act of 2006.

===Israel and the Palestinian Territories===

In October 2007, Brownback announced his support for a plan designed by Benny Elon, then-chairman of Israel&#x27;s far-right-wing National Union/National Religious Party (NU/NRP) alliance. Elon&#x27;s positions included dismantling the Palestinian National Authority and Hamas and rejecting a two-state solution. The plan calls for the complete annexation of the West Bank by Israel, and the deportation of its massive majority Arab population to a new Palestinian state to be created within present-day Jordan, against that latter country&#x27;s historic opposition.

===LGBT issues===
In 1996, as a member of the House of Representatives, Brownback voted for the Defense of Marriage Act, which defined marriage for purposes of federal law as the union between a man and a woman. Brownback has stated that he believes homosexuality to be immoral as a violation of both Catholic doctrine and natural law. He has voted against gay rights, receiving zeros in four of the last five scorecards as a U.S. senator from the Human Rights Campaign. He opposes both same-sex marriage and same-sex civil unions. He opposes adding sexual orientation and gender identity to federal hate crime laws. He has declined to state a position on homosexual adoption, although a candidate for chair of the Kansas Republican Party claims he was blackballed by political operatives affiliated with Brownback for not opposing homosexual adoption. Brownback supported &quot;don&#x27;t ask, don&#x27;t tell,&quot; the U.S. government&#x27;s ban on openly homosexual people in the military. Brownback has associated with organizations such as the Family Research Council and American Family Association.

In 2003, Brownback worked with Alliance for Marriage and Traditional Values Coalition to introduce a Senate bill containing the Federal Marriage Amendment, a proposed amendment to the United States Constitution that would federally prohibit same-sex marriage in the United States. The bill was a response to &quot;Goodridge v. Department of Public Health&quot;, the Massachusetts state court decision finding that same-sex couples had the right to marry in Massachusetts. In reaction to the &quot;Goodridge&quot; decision, Brownback stated that same-sex marriage threatened the health of American families and culture.

In 2006, Brownback blocked the confirmation of federal judicial nominee Janet T. Neff because she had attended a same-sex commitment ceremony. At first, he agreed to lift the block only if Neff would recuse herself from all cases involving same-sex unions. Brownback later dropped his opposition. Neff was nominated to the United States District Court for the Western District of Michigan by President George W. Bush on March 19, 2007, to a seat vacated David McKeague and was confirmed by a vote of 83-4 by the Senate on July 9, 2007. She received her commission on August 6, 2007.

In April 2011, Brownback began work on a Kansas government program to promote marriage, in part through grants to faith-based and secular social service organizations. In June 2011, the administration revised contract expectations for social work organizations to promote married mother-father families. It explained the change as benefiting children.

In January 2012, Brownback did not include Kansas&#x27;s sodomy law in a list of unenforced and outdated laws that the legislature should repeal. Gay rights advocates had asked his administration to recommend its repeal because the law has been unenforceable since the Supreme Court&#x27;s &quot;Lawrence v. Texas&quot; decision in 2003.

In February 2012, the Brownback administration supported a religious freedom bill that would have stopped cities, school districts, universities, and executive agencies from having nondiscrimination laws or policies that covered sexual orientation or gender identity.

In 2013, after oral arguments in &quot;United States v. Windsor&quot;, the U.S. Supreme Court case striking down part of the Defense of Marriage Act, Brownback publicly reaffirmed his opposition to same-sex marriage.

In 2014, the U.S. Supreme Court denied petitions to review several federal appellate decisions overturning state bans on same-sex marriage. The court&#x27;s actions favored repeal of Kansas&#x27;s ban on same-sex marriage because two of the appeals (&quot;Kitchen v. Herbert&quot; and &quot;Bishop v. Oklahoma&quot;) originated in the United States Court of Appeals for the Tenth Circuit, which includes Kansas. In response, Brownback defended Kansas&#x27;s same-sex marriage ban as being supported by a majority of Kansas voters and criticized &quot;activist judges&quot; for &quot;overruling&quot; the people of Kansas.

On February 10, 2015, Brownback issued an executive order rescinding protections for lesbian, gay, bisexual, and transgender state workers that was put into place by then-Gov. Kathleen Sebelius eight years previously. The ACLU generally characterized his actions as being &quot;religious freedom to discriminate.&quot;

===Stem cell research===
Brownback supports adult stem cell research and cord blood stem cells. Brownback appeared with three children adopted from in vitro fertilization clinics to coincide with a Senate debate over the Cord Blood Stem Cell Act of 2005 to show his support for the bill and adult stem cell research.

===Other issues===
On June 15, 2006, President George W. Bush signed into law the Broadcast Decency Enforcement Act of 2005 sponsored by Brownback, a former broadcaster himself. The new law stiffened the penalties for each violation of the Act. The Federal Communications Commission will be able to impose fines in the amount of $325,000 for each violation by each station that violates decency standards. The legislation raised the fine by tenfold.

On September 3, 1997, Meredith O&#x27;Rourke, an employee of Kansas firm Triad Management Services, was deposed by the Senate Committee on Governmental Affairs regarding her activities and observations while providing services for the company relative to fund raising and advertising for Brownback. The deposition claims that Triad circumvented existing campaign finance laws by channeling donations through Triad, and also bypassed the campaign law with Triad running &#x27;issue ads&#x27; during Brownback&#x27;s first campaign for the Senate.

Brownback has said he does not believe there is an inherent right to privacy in the U.S. Constitution. He has, however, expressed disapproval of George W. Bush&#x27;s assertions on the legality of the NSA wiretapping program.

Brownback introduced into the Senate a resolution (Senate Joint Resolution 4) calling for the United States to apologize for past mistreatment of Native Americans.
Brownback was responsible for introducing the Senate&#x27;s version of a bill that would successfully establish the National Museum of African American History and Culture.

Brownback has advocated for closer relations between the United States and Armenia, citing the need to defend the country from aggression by Azerbaijan. In a 2023 &quot;Washington Times&quot; opinion piece, the former ambassador called for Israel to also support Armenia due to the two nations&#x27; shared backgrounds as Judeo-Christian nations populated by ethnic groups that have been the victims of genocides despite geopolitical tensions. On April 24, 2024, Brownback called for sanctions against Azerbaijan and that the United States &quot;can’t let a repeat of 1915 happen again on our watch&quot; at an Armenian Genocide Remembrance Day rally in front of the White House.

==Relationship with Koch family==
Throughout his Senate career, Brownback&#x27;s principal campaign donors were the politically influential libertarian Koch brothers of Kansas, and their enterprises, including Kansas-based Koch Industries—and Brownback was one of the candidates most-heavily funded by the Kochs&#x27; campaign donations. Over the course of his political career, they donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to his campaigns.

Brownback&#x27;s signature tax and regulatory policies coincide tightly with the Kochs&#x27; position on those issues. It was crafted with the assistance of the Koch-backed American Legislative Exchange Council (ALEC) and Brownback&#x27;s first Budget Director, Steve Anderson. Anderson was a former Koch employee who previously worked at the Kochs&#x27; principal political organization, the libertarian think-tank Americans for Prosperity (AFP), developing a &quot;model budget&quot; for Kansas, until his appointment as Brownback&#x27;s first budget director. Anderson remained Brownback&#x27;s budget director for three years, before returning to a Koch-linked think tank, the Kansas Policy Institute.

Brownback also hired the wife of a Koch-enterprise executive as his spokesperson.

Brownback, however, has denied that the Kochs have an undue influence in Kansas government, and analysts have noted key differences between Brownback and the Kochs in two of Brownback&#x27;s main gubernatorial policy areas: 
* social issues: (on abortion, Brownback is pro-life, the Kochs pro-choice; Brownback opposes various LGBT rights, the libertarian Kochs accept them); and
* renewable energy standards for Kansas, which promote renewable energy (supported by Brownback; opposed by the Kochs, whose chief business is the fossil-fuel industry).

==Personal life==

Brownback is married to the former Mary Stauffer, whose family owned and operated Stauffer Communications until its sale in 1995. They have five children: Abby, Andy, Elizabeth, Mark, and Jenna. Two of their children are adopted. A former evangelical Christian, Brownback converted to Catholicism in 2002 and is associated with the conservative denominational organization, Opus Dei. In 2017, Brownback stated that he sometimes attends an evangelical church with his family.

<text>Dean DeLeo (born August 23, 1961) is an American guitarist known for his work with rock band Stone Temple Pilots. DeLeo is also known for his role in the short-lived bands Talk Show and Army of Anyone. He is the older brother of Robert DeLeo, who plays bass for Stone Temple Pilots.

== Early life ==
DeLeo and his younger brother Robert were both born in Montclair, New Jersey, and raised in the Jersey Shore community of Point Pleasant Beach. They are the younger half-brothers of late actor Scott Marlowe.

== Career ==
=== Stone Temple Pilots (1985–2003, 2008–present) ===
Dean&#x27;s younger brother Robert met future vocalist Scott Weiland after the latter witnessed him perform at various gigs. Robert soon after introduced Dean to Scott and an idea of forming a band was brought up. Dean was a guitarist and Robert managed to convince him to join. They eventually hooked up with drummer Eric Kretz, and the band was formed. They took the name Mighty Joe Young, inspired by the movie of the same name. They played gigs in many bars around San Diego and the Hollywood area, and eventually landed a record deal with Atlantic Records in 1992. However, they were forced to change their name, as the name &quot;Mighty Joe Young&quot; had already been taken by a blues musician. Weiland decided on the name &quot;Stone Temple Pilots&quot;; although he stated that it has no real meaning, he just liked the initials &quot;STP&quot;.

The band quickly rose to fame with the release of their debut album &quot;Core&quot;, which sold over 8 million copies. The record sales were propelled by the release of the singles &quot;Sex Type Thing&quot; and &quot;Plush&quot;, and helped establish Stone Temple Pilots as one of the many popular grunge bands in the early 1990s. However, they were ripped by critics for jumping on the bandwagon and profiting from the grunge mania. With their second album &quot;Purple&quot;, they challenged critics and became a genuine commercial rock act. Stone Temple Pilots released a total of five studio albums and managed to sell over 30 million records worldwide. In 2008, after over five years apart, the band reunited. On May 25, 2010, the band released their sixth album, &quot;Stone Temple Pilots&quot;, the first album released after the band reunited.

=== Talk Show, Army of Anyone and other work (1997–present) ===
The DeLeos and Eric Kretz formed a new band, Talk Show, which released one album. DeLeo worked with Laughter Train in the late 1990s. Stone Temple Pilots soon released two more albums, and disbanded once again in 2002. Weiland became the lead singer of Velvet Revolver, Kretz opened a studio in California, and the DeLeo brothers began to work with Richard Patrick, lead singer of the band Filter to compose songs for Filter&#x27;s fourth album. The end result was a song that the three liked, so they contacted Ray Luzier, a famed session drummer, and Army of Anyone was formed. The band&#x27;s debut was released on November 14, 2006, and they broke up in May 2007.

In 2021, he teamed up with Tom Bukovac for a new project, Trip The Witch. Debut single &quot;Saturn We Miss You&quot; features Jon Anderson on vocals.

=== Production work ===
DeLeo and his younger brother Robert produced Stone Temple Pilots&#x27; 2010 album, &quot;Stone Temple Pilots&quot;. The DeLeo brothers also produced the album &quot;TruANT&quot; by Alien Ant Farm.

<text>Peter Sydney Ernest Lawford (né Aylen; 7 September 1923 – 24 December 1984) was an English-American actor.

He was a member of the &quot;Rat Pack&quot; and the brother-in-law of US president John F. Kennedy and senators Robert F. Kennedy and Edward Kennedy. From the 1940s to the 1960s, he was a well-known celebrity and starred in a number of highly acclaimed films. In later years, he was noted more for his off-screen activities as a celebrity than for his acting; it was said that he was &quot;famous for being famous&quot;.

==Early life==
Born in London in 1923, Lawford was the only child of Lieutenant General Sir Sydney Turing Barlow Lawford, KBE (1865–1953) and May Sommerville Bunny (1883–1972). At the time of his birth, his mother was married to Lieutenant Colonel Dr. Ernest Vaughn Aylen DSO, one of Sir Sydney&#x27;s officers, while his father was married to Muriel Williams. At the time, May and Ernest Aylen were living apart. May confessed to Aylen that the child was not his, a revelation that resulted in a double divorce. Sydney and May wed in September 1924 after their divorces were finalised and when their son was one year old.

Lawford&#x27;s family was connected to the British aristocracy through his uncle Ernest Lawford&#x27;s wife (a daughter of the Scottish 14th Earl of Eglinton) as well as his aunt Ethel Turner Lawford (who married a son of the 1st Baron Avebury). His aunt, Jessie Bruce Lawford, another of his father&#x27;s sisters, was the second wife of the Hon Hartley Williams, senior puisne judge of the Supreme Court of the colony of Victoria, Australia. A relative, through his mother, was Australian artist Rupert Bunny.

===Early childhood===
He spent his early childhood in France and, owing to his family&#x27;s travels, was never formally educated. Instead, he was schooled by governesses and tutors, and his education included tennis and ballet lessons.

&quot;In the beginning,&quot; his mother observed, &quot;he had no homework. When he was older he had Spanish, German and music added to his studies. He read only selected books: English fairy stories, English and French classics; no crime stories. Having studied Peter for so long, I decided he was quite unfitted for any career except art, so I cut Latin, Algebra, high mathematics and substituted dramatics instead.&quot;

Because of the widely varying national and religious backgrounds of his tutors, Lawford &quot;attended various services in churches, cathedrals, synagogues and for some time was an usher in a Christian Science Sunday School...&quot;

Around 1930, aged seven, he made his acting debut in the English film &quot;Poor Old Bill&quot;. He also had an uncredited bit in &quot;A Gentleman of Paris&quot; (1931).

===Accident===
At the age of 14, Lawford severely injured his right arm in an accident when it went through a glass door. Irreversible nerve damage severely compromised the use of his forearm and hand, which he later learned to conceal. The injury resulted in his being unable to follow a military career as his parents had hoped. Instead, Lawford pursued a career as an actor, a decision that resulted in one of his aunts refusing to leave him her considerable fortune, as she had originally planned.

==Career==
===Early career===

In 1938, Lawford was travelling through Hollywood when he was spotted by a talent scout. He was screen tested and made his Hollywood debut in a minor part in the film &quot;Lord Jeff&quot; starring Freddie Bartholomew.

Lawford and his family were living in Florida at the start of World War II, resulting in their assets, which were in Britain at the time, being frozen. He took a job parking cars and saved enough money to return to Hollywood, where he worked as a theatre usher until he began to get film work.

===Extra work and bit parts===
The advent of World War II saw an increase in British war stories and Lawford found himself in demand playing military personnel, albeit usually in uncredited parts. He is briefly seen in &quot;Mrs. Miniver&quot; (1942) and , both times as pilots.

His first decent role in a major film production was in &quot;A Yank at Eton&quot; (1942), starring Mickey Rooney, in which Lawford played a snobbish bully. It was very popular at the box office.

Lawford was a cadet in &quot;Thunder Birds: Soldiers of the Air&quot; (1942) and &quot;Junior Army&quot; (1942) (starring Bartholomew), a soldier in , , and &quot;London Blackout Murders&quot; (1943) (directed by George Sherman), and a navigator in &quot;Assignment in Brittany&quot; (1943). He had a billed part in &quot;The Purple V&quot; (1943).

At MGM he was a student in , a soldier in &quot;Pilot #5&quot; (1943), a naval commander in (with Fred Astaire), and an Australian in &quot;The Man from Down Under&quot; (1943). He had a minor role at Republic&#x27;s &quot;Someone to Remember&quot; (1943) and &quot;The West Side Kid&quot; (1943), the latter directed by Sherman.

Lawford played a soldier in &quot;Sahara&quot; (1943) and sailors in &quot;Sherlock Holmes Faces Death&quot; (1943) and &quot;Corvette K-225&quot; (1943). He was a Frenchman in &quot;Paris After Dark&quot; (1943) and &quot;Flesh and Fantasy&quot; (1943), and was a student in MGM&#x27;s and .

===MGM===
Lawford&#x27;s career stepped up a notch when he was signed to a long-term contract to MGM in June 1943. The studio signed him with a specific role in mind: , in which he played a young soldier during the Second World War.

Lawford had a small role in and &quot;Mrs. Parkington&quot; (1944), playing a suitor of Greer Garson.

MGM gave him another important role in .

===Leading man===

Lawford&#x27;s first leading role came in &quot;Son of Lassie&quot; (1945), a big hit.

Lawford was put in a Kathryn Grayson-June Allyson musical, &quot;Two Sisters from Boston&quot; (1946) which was very popular. Ernst Lubitsch used him at Fox in &quot;Cluny Brown&quot; (1946) where he was billed after Charles Boyer and Jennifer Jones.

He won a &quot;Modern Screen&quot; magazine readers&#x27; poll as the most popular actor in Hollywood of 1946. His fan mail jumped to thousands of letters a week. With actors such as Clark Gable and James Stewart away at war, Lawford was recognised as a new romantic lead on the MGM lot.

Lawford made &quot;My Brother Talks to Horses&quot; (1947) with Jackie Butch Jenkins, an early work of Fred Zinnemann which was a big flop. He was reunited with Grayson in &quot;It Happened in Brooklyn&quot; (1947), which also starred Frank Sinatra. Lawford received rave reviews for his work in the film, while Sinatra&#x27;s were lukewarm.

Lawford later admitted that the most terrifying experience of his career was the first musical number he performed in the musical , the film he starred in alongside Allyson. He was lauded for the role in which he used an American accent.

He was Esther Williams&#x27; leading man in &quot;On an Island with You&quot; (1948) and supported Fred Astaire and Judy Garland in , a huge hit, and Greer Garson and Walter Pidgeon in &quot;Julia Misbehaves&quot; (1948), also popular.

He played Laurie in MGM&#x27;s version of alongside Allyson and Elizabeth Taylor. He was billed beneath Pidgeon and Ethel Barrymore in the anti-Communist &quot;The Red Danube&quot; (1949) and was one of Deborah Kerr&#x27;s leading men in &quot;Please Believe Me&quot; (1950).

He was Jane Powell&#x27;s love interest in with Fred Astaire and co-starred with Janet Leigh in , both popular.

20th Century Fox borrowed him for , a melodrama shot in Australia with Maureen O&#x27;Hara. Reviewing this film &quot;Filmink&quot; argued &quot;Lawford is a wet fish actor who could never really hold the screen in a heroic part (he was generally better as a leading man for a female star, or a second lead to a more charismatic male star). But in Lawford’s defence, his character is totally emasculated in &quot;Kangaroo&quot;&quot; from what it was in the original script.

Back at MGM he was top billed in some lower budgeted films: &quot;You for Me&quot; (1953), a comedy, &quot;The Hour of 13&quot; (1953), a thriller, and , a war film. The studio then let him go.

Lawford&#x27;s first film after Metro released him and several other players from their contracts was the comedy &quot;It Should Happen to You&quot; (1954), wherein he starred alongside Judy Holliday and Jack Lemmon.

===Television===
He focused on television, guest starring on shows like &quot;General Electric Theater&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot;, and &quot;The Ford Television Theatre&quot;.

In 1954, Lawford married Patricia Kennedy, sister of Senator John F. Kennedy. Lawford would become an enthusiastic fundraiser for the Senator.

Lawford had a regular role on a TV sitcom, &quot;Dear Phoebe&quot; (1954–55) but the show only ran 32 episodes.

When it ended he resumed guest starring on shows like &quot;Alfred Hitchcock Presents&quot;, &quot;Jane Wyman Presents The Fireside Theatre&quot;, &quot;Screen Directors Playhouse&quot;, &quot;Schlitz Playhouse&quot; again, &quot;Playhouse 90&quot;, &quot;Producers&#x27; Showcase&quot; (a version of &quot;Ruggles of Red Gap&quot;), several episodes of &quot;Studio 57&quot;, &quot;Climax!&quot; and &quot;Goodyear Theatre&quot;.

Lawford had another starring role on a TV series, &quot;The Thin Man&quot; (1957–59) with Phyllis Kirk, an NBC series from MGM based on the novel by Dashiell Hammett. It was more successful, running for 72 episodes.

===Frank Sinatra and the Rat Pack===

In 1959, Sinatra invited Lawford to join the &quot;Rat Pack&quot; and also got him a role in &quot;Never So Few&quot; (1959).

Peter Lawford and Sinatra appeared in &quot;Oceans 11&quot; (1960). Lawford had been first told of the basic story of the film by director Gilbert Kay, who heard the idea from a gas station attendant. Lawford eventually bought the rights in 1958, imagining William Holden in the lead. Sinatra became interested in the idea, and a variety of writers worked on the project.

Lawford played a British soldier in the acclaimed Israeli-set drama for Otto Preminger and had a cameo in . In 1960, he became a U.S. citizen and assisted on his brother-in-law&#x27;s successful presidential election.

He did a TV remake of &quot;The Farmer&#x27;s Daughter&quot; (1962) with Lee Remick and was reunited with the Rat Pack in &quot;Sergeants 3&quot; (1962).

Lawford played a Senator in &quot;Advise &amp; Consent&quot; (1962) for Preminger and was Lord Lovat in , a war film with a star-studded cast.

===Producer===
In 1961, Lawford and his manager Milt Ebbins formed &quot;Chrislaw Productions&quot;, which was named after Peter&#x27;s son Christopher. It signed a three-year deal with United Artists to make three features and two TV series for $10 million. William Asher was to be executive producer. Their first project was to be a remake of the old silent film &quot;&quot;. Half a million dollars instead went toward the 1963 action film &quot;Johnny Cool&quot; starring Henry Silva and Elizabeth Montgomery.

Lawford was Bette Davis&#x27;s leading man in and guest starred on &quot;The Alfred Hitchcock Hour&quot;, &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot; (as General Alexander William Doniphan), &quot;Bob Hope Presents the Chrysler Theatre&quot; and &quot;Run for Your Life&quot;.

He went on to produce the Patty Duke film and had supporting roles in two Carroll Baker movies, playing her fiancé both times: and &quot;Harlow&quot; (1965).

By this time, Lawford had fallen out with Sinatra — who replaced him in &quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot; (1964) with Bing Crosby — but Sammy Davis Jr. remained loyal and got Lawford a supporting role in . He played a washed-up film star in . He and Patricia Kennedy divorced in 1966.

He guest-starred on shows like &quot;The Wild Wild West&quot; and &quot;I Spy&quot; and was in .

Lawford went to Europe to star in and &quot;The Fourth Wall&quot; (1968). He was a popular guest star on TV comedy and game shows.

He produced a film starring himself and Davis, , and had support roles in for Preminger, &quot;Buona Sera, Mrs. Campbell&quot; (1968), with Jerry Lewis, and &quot;The April Fools&quot; (1969).

&quot;Salt and Pepper&quot; was popular enough for Lawford to raise money for a sequel, directed by Lewis. He supported George Hamilton in and guest-starred several times on &quot;Rowan &amp; Martin&#x27;s Laugh-In&quot;. In 1971, he married Rowan&#x27;s daughter Mary.

===Later career===
Lawford&#x27;s later films included &quot;A Step Out of Line&quot; (1971), &quot;Clay Pigeon&quot; (1971), and &quot;The Deadly Hunt&quot; (1971). He had the lead role in &quot;Ellery Queen: Don&#x27;t Look Behind You&quot; and guest starred on &quot;Bewitched.&quot; In 1971 he appeared as Ben Hunter on &quot;The Men From Shiloh&quot; (rebranded name for &quot;The Virginian&quot;) in the episode titled &quot;The Town Killer.&quot; He had a semi recurring role in &quot;The Doris Day Show&quot; (1971–72) and even directed an episode.

He returned to MGM for &quot;They Only Kill Their Masters&quot; (1972), which reunited him with former MGM contract players June Allyson and Ann Rutherford.

Lawford was in &quot;The Phantom of Hollywood&quot; (1974), the pilot for &quot;Born Free&quot;, &quot;Rosebud&quot; (1975) for Preminger, &quot;Won Ton Ton: The Dog Who Saved Hollywood&quot; (1976), &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot;, &quot;Fantasy Island&quot;, &quot;The Love Boat&quot;, &quot;Angels&#x27; Brigade&quot; (1979), &quot;Highcliffe Manor&quot;, &quot;Supertrain&quot;, &quot;Mysterious Island of Beautiful Women&quot; (1979), &quot;Gypsy Angels&quot; (1980), &quot;Body and Soul&quot; (1981), and episodes of &quot;The Jeffersons&quot;.

His last role was as Montague Chippendale in &quot;Where Is Parsifal?&quot; (1983).

==Personal life==

His first marriage, in 1954, was to socialite Patricia Kennedy, a younger sister of John F. Kennedy, then a Democratic U.S. senator from Massachusetts. They had four children: a son, actor and author Christopher Lawford (1955−2018), and daughters Sydney Maleia Lawford (b. 1956), Victoria Francis Lawford (b. 1958), and Robin Elizabeth Lawford (b. 1961).

Lawford became a U.S. citizen on 23 April 1960, in time to vote for his brother-in-law in the upcoming presidential election. Lawford, along with other members of the &quot;Rat Pack&quot;, helped campaign for Kennedy and the Democratic Party. Sinatra famously dubbed him &quot;Brother-in-Lawford&quot; at this time. Lawford and Patricia Kennedy divorced in February 1966.

Lawford was originally cast as Alan-a-Dale in the film &quot;Robin and the 7 Hoods&quot; but was replaced by Bing Crosby following a break in Frank Sinatra&#x27;s relationship with Lawford. The break stemmed from a scheduled visit to Sinatra&#x27;s home by Lawford&#x27;s brother-in-law, President Kennedy, during a 1962 West Coast trip. Attorney General Robert F. Kennedy, who had long been concerned about Sinatra&#x27;s rumoured ties with underworld figures, encouraged the president to change his plans and stay at Crosby&#x27;s home, which (it was maintained) could provide better security for the president. The change came at the last minute, after Sinatra had made extensive arrangements for the promised and eagerly awaited presidential visit, including the construction of a helipad, which he later destroyed in a fit of rage. Sinatra was furious, believing that Lawford had failed to intercede with the Kennedys on his behalf, and banished him from the Rat Pack.

Sinatra and Lawford&#x27;s friendship was over. They only spoke when Sinatra called after his son Frank Sinatra Jr. was kidnapped on 8 December 1963 and needed the help of Lawford&#x27;s brother-in-law Robert F. Kennedy, then attorney general. With the exception of Pat Brown in his unsuccessful re-election as governor of California in 1966 and Vice President Hubert H. Humphrey&#x27;s run for the presidency in the 1968 United States presidential election, Sinatra never endorsed another Democratic candidate. Crosby, a staunch Republican, was cast in Lawford&#x27;s role.

Lawford married his second wife, Mary Rowan, daughter of comedian Dan Rowan, in October 1971. Rowan and Lawford separated two years later and divorced in January 1975.

Between marriages, Lawford dated Jill St. John and Priscilla Presley.

In June 1976 he married aspiring actress Deborah Gould, whom he had known for three weeks. Lawford and Gould separated two months after marrying and divorced in 1977. Following the divorce, Lawford moved into the Sierra Towers where he lived for the next few years on the 30th floor. During his separation from Gould, Lawford met Patricia Seaton who became his fourth and final wife in July 1984, just months before his death.

==Death==
Lawford died at Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles on Christmas Eve 1984, aged 61, from cardiac arrest. He suffered from kidney failure and liver failure after years of substance abuse. His body was cremated, and his ashes were interred at Westwood Village Memorial Park Cemetery. Owing to a dispute between his widow and the cemetery, Lawford&#x27;s ashes were removed from the cemetery in 1988 and scattered into the Pacific Ocean off the coast of California by his widow Patricia Seaton Lawford, who invited the &quot;National Enquirer&quot; tabloid to photograph the event.

For his contribution to the television industry, Peter Lawford has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame located at 6920 Hollywood Boulevard.

A plaque bearing Lawford&#x27;s name was erected at Westwood Village Memorial Park.

<doc id="367129" wikidata="Q232427" url="?curid=367129" title="Saint Apollonia">
<text>Saint Apollonia (; , ) was one of a group of virgin martyrs who suffered in Alexandria during a local uprising against the Christians prior to the persecution of Decius. According to church tradition, her torture included having all of her teeth violently pulled out or shattered. For this reason, she is popularly regarded as the patroness of dentistry and those suffering from toothache or other dental problems. French court painter Jehan Fouquet painted the scene of St. Apollonia&#x27;s torture in &quot;The Martyrdom of St. Apollonia&quot;.

==Martyrdom==
Ecclesiastical historians have claimed that in the last years of Emperor Philip the Arab (reigned 244–249), during otherwise undocumented festivities to commemorate the millennium of the founding of Rome (traditionally in 753 BC, putting the date about 248), the fury of the Alexandrian mob rose to a great height, and when one of their poets prophesied a calamity, they committed bloody outrages on the Christians, whom the authorities made no effort to protect.

Dionysius, Bishop of Alexandria (247–265), relates the sufferings of his people in a letter addressed to Fabius, Bishop of Antioch, of which long extracts have been preserved in Eusebius&#x27; &quot;Historia Ecclesiae&quot;. After describing how a Christian man and woman, Metras and Quinta, were seized and killed by the mob, and how the houses of several other Christians were pillaged, Dionysius continues:

At that time Apollonia, &quot;parthénos presbytis&quot; (mostly likely meaning a deaconess) was held in high esteem. These men seized her also and by repeated blows broke all her teeth. They then erected outside the city gates a pile of wood and threatened to burn her alive if she refused to repeat after them impious words (either a blasphemy against Christ, or an invocation of the heathen gods). Given, at her own request, a little freedom, she sprang quickly into the fire and was burned to death.

This brief tale was extended and moralized in Jacobus de Voragine&#x27;s &quot;Golden Legend&quot; (c. 1260).

Apollonia and a whole group of early martyrs did not await the death they were threatened with, but either to preserve their chastity or because they were confronted with the alternative of renouncing their faith or suffering death, voluntarily embraced the death prepared for them, an action that runs perilously close to suicide, some thought. Augustine of Hippo touches on this question in the first book of &quot;The City of God&quot;, apropos suicide:

But, they say, during the time of persecution certain holy women plunged into the water with the intention of being swept away by the waves and drowned, and thus preserve their threatened chastity. Although they quitted life in this wise, nevertheless they receive high honour as martyrs in the Catholic Church and their feasts are observed with great ceremony. This is a matter on which I dare not pass judgment lightly. For I know not but that the Church was divinely authorized through trustworthy revelations to honour thus the memory of these Christians. It may be that such is the case. May it not be, too, that these acted in such a manner, not through human caprice but on the command of God, not erroneously but through obedience, as we must believe in the case of Samson? When, however, God gives a command and makes it clearly known, who would account obedience there to a crime or condemn such pious devotion and ready service?&quot;

The narrative of Dionysius does not suggest the slightest reproach as to this act of St. Apollonia; in his eyes she was as much a martyr as the others, and as such she was revered in the Alexandrian Church. In time, her feast was also popular in the West. A later narrative mistakenly duplicated Apollonia, making her a Christian virgin of Rome in the reign of Julian the Apostate, suffering the same dental fate.

==Veneration==
The Roman Catholic and Eastern Orthodox (OCA) Churches celebrate the feast day of St. Apollonia on 9 February, and she is popularly invoked against the toothache because of the torments she had to endure. She is represented in art with pincers in which a tooth is held. Saint Apollonia is one of the two patron saints of Catania.

William S. Walsh noted that, though the major part of her relics were preserved in the former church of St. Apollonia at Rome, her head at the Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere, her arms at the Basilica di San Lorenzo fuori le Mura, parts of her jaw in St. Basil&#x27;s, and other relics are in the Jesuit church at Antwerp, in St. Augustine&#x27;s at Brussels, in the Jesuit church at Mechlin, in St. Cross at Liège, in the treasury of the cathedral of Porto, and in several churches at Cologne. These relics consist in some cases of a solitary tooth or a splinter of bone. In the Middle Ages, objects claimed to be her teeth were sold as toothache cures.

There was a church dedicated to her in Rome, near the Basilica di Santa Maria in Trastevere, but it no longer exists. Only its little square, the &quot;Piazza Sant&#x27;Apollonia&quot; remains. One of the principal train stations of Lisbon is also named for this saint. There is a statue of Saint Apollonia in the church at Locronan, France. The island of Mauritius was originally named &quot;Santa Apolónia&quot; in her honor in 1507 by Portuguese navigators. A parish church in Eilendorf, a suburb of Aachen, Germany, is named in honor of Saint Apollonia.

In some areas of Italy, Saint Apollonia is cast in the role of the tooth fairy, collecting children&#x27;s fallen baby teeth while they sleep and leaving a gift in exchange. 

The Madonna Della Strada Chapel at Loyola University Chicago contains a stained glass window on the north wall depicting St. Apollonia. The windows along this wall correspond with the colleges of the university at the time the chapel was built. The Loyola University School of Dentistry closed in 1993, but the window in the chapel remains.

==Presence in England==

There are 52 known images of her in various English churches that survived the ravages of the 16th-century Commissioners. These are concentrated in Devon and East Anglia. Most of these images are on the panels of rood screens or featured in stained glass with only one being a stone capital (Stokeinteignhead, Devon). She is also depicted in a tapestry of circa 1499 at St. Mary&#x27;s Guildhall, Coventry.

By county, some of the locations are:
*Cheshire: Bunbury
*Cornwall: Poundstock
*Devon: Alphington (now gone), Ashton, Combe Martin, Exeter Cathedral (tapestry in St. Gabriel&#x27;s chapel), Holne, Kenn, Kenton, Kingskerswell (see photo), Manaton, Payhembury, South Milton, Stoke-in-Teignhead, Torbryan, Ugborough, Whimple (now gone), Widecombe-in-the-Moor, Wolborough (Newton Abbot)
*Guernsey: Chapel of St. Apolline.
*Lincolnshire: Long Sutton
*Norfolk: Barton Turf, Docking, Horsham St Faith, Ludham, Norwich (St. Stephen&#x27;s), Norwich Over the Water (church disused), Sandringham
*Suffolk: Norton, Somerleyton, Westhall, Chilton

Her image is the side support of the arms of the British Dental Association.

<text>Paweł Włodkowic (Latin: &quot;Paulus Vladimiri&quot;; ca. 1370 – 9 October 1435) was a Polish scholar, jurist, statesman and rector of the Kraków Academy. He advocated a form of religious tolerance and defended Poland and non-Christian Baltic tribes against the Teutonic Knights and the crusading movement in general.

==Early life and education==
Though it is commonly assumed that &quot;Włodkowic&quot; was a surname, it was in fact a patronymic denoting that he was the son of a certain &quot;Włodko&quot; or &quot;Włodzimierz&quot; of the Dołęga family. He was born in Brudzeń Duży near Dobrzyń nad Wisłą between 1370–1373. His family owned land in the Dobrzyń Province and was related to the Lasota family from Mazovia whose notable members include Mikołaj Lasota, the treasurer of Konrad of Mazovia. He was a graduate of the Collegiate Church of St. Michael School in Płock (currently the Marshal Stanisław Małachowski High School) where probably he was ordained as a priest. He studied at Prague University, where he took degrees in 1393. In 1400, he became the Canon of Płock. He continued studying law at Padova, Italy, in 1404–1408. It was probably in this period that he visited the Roman Curia in place of Piotr of Kobylin, fulfilling his duties as the Polish King&#x27;s prosecutor.

In 1411 or 1412 he was made a doctor of canon law at the Academy in Kraków, where he also began to lecture. He was influenced by the philosophies of William of Ockham, Matthew of Cracow and Stanisław of Skarbimierz. In 1413 he served as King Jagiełło&#x27;s emissary at Buda, Hungary, during disputes with the Teutonic Order. In 1414–1415 he became rector and in 1418 prorector of Cracow Academy.

==The Council of Constance Address==
Paweł Włodkowic represented Poland at the 1414 Council of Constance, where he delivered a thesis about the power of the Pope and the Emperor, the &quot;Tractatus de potestate papae et imperatoris respectu infidelium&quot; (Treatise on the Power of the Pope and the Emperor Respecting Infidels). In it he drew the thesis that pagan and Christian peoples could coexist in peace and criticized the Teutonic Order for its wars of conquest of native non-Christian peoples in Prussia and Lithuania. 

Due to his religious and political influence, in 1421 Pope Martin V sent Antonio Zeno to investigate the Teutonic Order and its activities, though this investigation was later suspended on the grounds that it infringed upon the privileges of the new Holy Roman Emperor Sigismund, who wished to conduct his own negotiations between the two parties. 

Włodkowic’s address at the council is considered to have been &quot;not only one of the greatest achievements of Poland in their political fight against the Teutonic Order but also a huge contribution to the Christian theory of just war.&quot;

At the Council of Constance, Paweł Włodkowic and all the Polish delegation defended Jan Hus.

==Later life and death==
In 1420 Paweł Włodkowic represented Poland at a conference between Poland and the Teutonic Order held in Wrocław under the aegis of Sigismund of Luxemburg.

As early as the beginning of the 15th century, along with Stanisław of Skarbimierz, Włodkowic strongly supported the idea of conciliarism and pioneered the notion of peaceful coexistence among nations – a forerunner of modern theories of human rights. Throughout his political, diplomatic and university career, Paweł Włodkowic expressed the view that a world guided by the principles of peace and mutual respect among nations was possible and that pagan nations had a right to peace and to possession of their own lands. For this, he, the king of Poland, and the entire Polish nation were virulently attacked by the Dominican John of Falkenberg (himself later condemned and imprisoned for his intemperance), and his thesis somewhat more judiciously rejected by Domenico da San Gimignano, , and André Dias de Escobar, Bishop of Ciudad Rodrigo.

After 1424 he retired from public life to Kłodawa, where he died in 1435.

<text>Scott Richard Weiland (, ; né Kline; October 27, 1967 – December 3, 2015) was an American singer and songwriter. He was best known as the lead vocalist of the rock band Stone Temple Pilots from 1989 to 2003 and again from 2008 to 2013, recording six albums with them. Weiland is also known for being the lead vocalist of the rock supergroup Velvet Revolver from 2003 to 2008. He also released one album with rock supergroup Art of Anarchy in 2015, as well as four solo studio albums and several collaborations with other musicians throughout his career.

Weiland was noted for his flamboyant and chaotic onstage persona, his consistently changing appearance, and his versatile vocal style. He also became known for his use of a megaphone for a unique vocal effect during concerts. He sold over 50 million albums with his various projects and collaborations. 

Weiland&#x27;s career was plagued by substance abuse issues, leading to various high-profile arrests and his eventual firings from Velvet Revolver and Stone Temple Pilots. On December 3, 2015, at the age of 48, he was found dead of an accidental drug overdose on his tour bus in Bloomington, Minnesota.

== Early life ==
Weiland was born Scott Richard Kline at Kaiser Hospital in San Jose, California, on October 27, 1967, the son of Sharon (née Williams) and Kent Kline. His father had German ancestry. He was raised Catholic. At the age of five, he was legally adopted by his stepfather David Weiland and subsequently took his surname. Around the same time, he moved to Bainbridge Township, Ohio, where he attended Kenston High School. 
According to Robert DeLeo, when he was younger, Scott was in choir. At the age of 12, while living in Ohio, he was raped by an older male who invited him to his house; he wrote in his autobiography &quot;Not Dead &amp; Not For Sale&quot; that he repressed the memory until it returned to him in therapy decades later. 

Weiland moved back to California as a teenager and attended Edison High School
in Huntington Beach and Orange Coast College in Costa Mesa. Before fully devoting himself to a music career, he worked as a paste up artist for the &quot;Los Angeles Daily Journal&quot; legal newspaper.

== Career ==
=== Stone Temple Pilots ===

In 1985, Scott Weiland and his friends in their band Soi Disant – guitarist Corey Hicock and drummer David Allin – first encountered Robert Deleo playing live at various gigs, deciding to track him down after witnessing his shows. Hicock and Allin would soon be replaced by Eric Kretz and DeLeo&#x27;s brother Dean. They took the name Stone Temple Pilots because of their fondness for the initials &quot;STP&quot;. Robert DeLeo said that, while he was working at Mesa Boogie, in Sunset Boulevard, Scott was working &quot;across catty-corner&quot; from him and would come to show musical ideas. In one of the band&#x27;s first opening performances under the name Mighty Joe Young, they opened for Electric Love Hogs, whose guitarist Dave Kushner would one day co-found Weiland&#x27;s later band Velvet Revolver. In 1992, they released their first album, &quot;Core&quot;, spawning four hits (&quot;Sex Type Thing&quot;, &quot;Wicked Garden&quot;, &quot;Creep&quot;, and &quot;Plush&quot;.)

In 1994, STP released their second record, &quot;Purple&quot;, which saw the development of a more distinctive identity for the band. Like &quot;Core&quot;, &quot;Purple&quot; was a big success for the band, spawning three hit singles (&quot;Big Empty&quot;, &quot;Vasoline&quot;, and &quot;Interstate Love Song&quot;) and selling more than six million copies. The critical response to &quot;Purple&quot; was more favorable, with &quot;Spin&quot; calling it a &quot;quantum leap&quot; from the band&#x27;s previous album.

In 1995, Weiland formed the alternative rock band the Magnificent Bastards with session drummer Victor Indrizzo in San Diego. The band included Zander Schloss and Jeff Nolan on guitars and Bob Thompson on bass. Only two songs were recorded by the Magnificent Bastards, &quot;Mockingbird Girl&quot;, composed by Nolan, Schloss, and Weiland, appeared in the film &quot;Tank Girl&quot; and on its soundtrack, and a cover of John Lennon&#x27;s &quot;How Do You Sleep?&quot; was recorded for the tribute album, &quot;Working Class Hero: A Tribute to John Lennon&quot;. Weiland rejoined Stone Temple Pilots in the fall of 1995, but STP was forced to cancel most of their 1996–1997 tour in support of their third release, &quot;Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop&quot;, which sold about two million albums. Weiland encountered problems with drug addiction at this time as well, which inspired some of his songs in the late-1990s and resulted in prison time.

In 1999, STP regrouped once again and released &quot;No. 4.&quot; The album contained the hit single &quot;Sour Girl&quot;, promoted by a surreal music video with Sarah Michelle Gellar. That same year, Weiland also recorded two songs with the short-lived supergroup the Wondergirls. During this time period Weiland spent five months in jail for drug possession.

In November 2000, Weiland was invited to perform on the show VH1 &quot;Storytellers&quot; with the surviving members of the Doors. Weiland performed vocals on two Doors songs, &quot;Break On Through (To the Other Side)&quot; and &quot;Five to One&quot;. That same month Stone Temple Pilots appeared on the Doors tribute CD, &quot;Stoned Immaculate&quot; with their own rendition of &quot;Break on Through&quot; as the lead track. On June 19, 2001, STP released its fifth album, &quot;Shangri-La Dee Da.&quot; That same year the band headlined the Family Values Tour along with Linkin Park, Staind and Static-X. In late 2002, significant backstage altercations between the DeLeo brothers and Weiland precipitated the band&#x27;s break-up.

In 2008, Stone Temple Pilots announced a 73-date U.S. tour on April 7 and performed together for the first time since 2002. The reunion tour kicked off at the Rock on the Range festival on May 17, 2008. According to Dean DeLeo, steps toward a Stone Temple Pilots reunion started with a simple phone call from Weiland&#x27;s wife. She invited the DeLeo brothers to play at a private beach party, which led to the reconciliation of Weiland and the DeLeo brothers.

STP&#x27;s reunion tour was a success, and the band continued to tour throughout 2009 and began recording its sixth studio album. STP&#x27;s first album since 2001, &quot;Stone Temple Pilots&quot;, was released on May 25, 2010.

STP toured Southeast Asia for the first time in 2011, playing in Philippines (Manila), Singapore and Indonesia (Jakarta). Following this, the band played successful shows in Australia, including sell-out performances in Sydney and Melbourne.

The band expressed interest in a 20th anniversary tour to celebrate the release of &quot;Core&quot; with Scott commenting on January 2, 2012, &quot;Well, we&#x27;re doing a lot of special things. [There&#x27;s] a lot of archival footage that we&#x27;re putting together, a coffee table book, hopefully a brand new album – so many ideas. A box set and then a tour, of course.&quot;STP began to experience problems in 2012 that were said to have been caused by tensions between Weiland and the rest of the band. Despite the band&#x27;s claims that their fall tour would be celebrating the 20th anniversary of &quot;Core&quot;, this did not happen. On February 27, 2013, shortly before his solo tour was set to commence, Stone Temple Pilots announced Weiland&#x27;s termination from the band on their website.

Weiland criticized the band after they hired Linkin Park singer Chester Bennington as his replacement, claiming he was still a member and they shouldn&#x27;t be calling themselves Stone Temple Pilots without him.

=== Velvet Revolver ===
In 2002, former Guns N&#x27; Roses members – guitarist Slash, bassist Duff McKagan and drummer Matt Sorum – as well as former Wasted Youth guitarist Dave Kushner were looking for a singer to help form a new band. Throughout his career, Weiland had become acquainted with the four musicians; he became friends with McKagan after attending the same gym, was in rehab at the same time as Sorum and once played on the same bill as Kushner. Weiland was sent two discs of material to work with but felt that the first disc &quot;sounded like Bad Company gone wrong&quot;. Weiland was more positive when he was sent the second disc, comparing it to &quot;Core&quot;-era Stone Temple Pilots, though he turned them down because Stone Temple Pilots had not yet separated.

When Stone Temple Pilots disbanded in 2003, the band sent Weiland new music, which he took into his studio and added vocals. This music eventually became the song &quot;Set Me Free&quot;. Although he delivered the music to the band himself, Weiland was still unsure whether or not he wanted to join them, despite performing at an industry showcase at Mates. They recorded two songs with producer Nick Raskulinecz, a recorded version of &quot;Set Me Free&quot; and a cover of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;Money&quot;, for the soundtracks to the movies &quot;The Hulk&quot; and &quot;The Italian Job&quot;, respectively. Weiland joined the band soon after, and &quot;Set Me Free&quot; managed to peak at number 17 on the Mainstream Rock chart without any radio promotion or a record label. It was prior to a screening of &quot;The Hulk&quot; at Universal Studios that the band chose a name. After seeing a movie by Revolution Studios, Slash liked the beginning of the word, eventually thinking of Revolver because of its multiple meanings: the name of a gun, subtext of a revolving door, which suited the band, as well as the name of a Beatles album. When he suggested Revolver to the band, Weiland suggested &#x27;Black Velvet&#x27; Revolver, liking the idea of &quot;something intimate like velvet juxtaposed with something deadly like a gun.&quot; They eventually arrived at Velvet Revolver, announcing it at a press conference and performance showcase at the El Rey Theatre while also performing the songs &quot;Set Me Free&quot; and &quot;Slither&quot; as well as covers of Nirvana&#x27;s &quot;Negative Creep&quot;, Sex Pistols&#x27; &quot;Bodies&quot;, and Guns N&#x27; Roses&#x27; &quot;It&#x27;s So Easy&quot;.

Velvet Revolver&#x27;s debut album &quot;Contraband&quot; was released in June 2004 to much success. It debuted at number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and has sold over three million copies worldwide to date. Two of the album&#x27;s songs, &quot;Slither&quot; and &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot;, reached number one on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart. The song &quot;Slither&quot; also won a Grammy Award for Best Hard Rock Performance with Vocal in 2005, an award Weiland had won previously with STP for the song &quot;Plush&quot; in 1994. At the 2005 Grammy Awards, Weiland (along with the rest of Velvet Revolver) performed the Beatles song &quot;Across the Universe&quot;, along with Bono, Brian Wilson, Norah Jones, Stevie Wonder, Steven Tyler, Billie Joe Armstrong, Alison Krauss, and Alicia Keys. On July 2, 2005, Weiland and Velvet Revolver performed at Live 8 in London, in which Weiland was condemned for using strong language before the UK watershed during the performance.
Velvet Revolver released their second album, &quot;Libertad&quot;, on July 3, 2007, peaking at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. The album&#x27;s first single &quot;She Builds Quick Machines&quot; peaked at 74 on the Hot Canadian Digital Singles. The second and third singles, &quot;The Last Fight&quot; and &quot;Get Out the Door&quot;, both peaked at number 16 and 34 on the Mainstream Rock Chart, respectively. Critical reception to the album was mixed. Though some critics praised the album and felt that &quot;Libertad&quot; gave the band an identity of their own, outside of the Guns N&#x27; Roses and Stone Temple Pilots comparisons, others described the album as &quot;bland&quot; and noted that the band seem to be &quot;play[ing] to their strengths instead of finding a collective sound.&quot;

After several flares on their personal blogs and in interviews, it was announced on April 1, 2008 that Weiland would no longer be a member of Velvet Revolver.

Velvet Revolver reunited for a one-off performance with Weiland at a benefit concert for the late John O&#x27;Brien, on January 12, 2012.

=== Art of Anarchy ===

The project started in 2011, with guitarist Bumblefoot recording parts for the debut album in between touring with Guns N&#x27; Roses. Weiland wrote and recorded the vocals after sharing the song files back and forth with Bumblefoot from 2012 to 2013. Weiland also took part in promotional photo shoots and music videos in October 2014.

Their self-titled debut album was released in June 2015. On January 21, 2015, they released a 2:06 teaser of the new album. Bumblefoot is the producer and engineer on the album. The first single to be released from the album was &quot;&#x27;Til the Dust Is Gone&quot;. The album contains 11 tracks. However, Weiland distanced himself from the project, stating &quot;It was a project I did where I was just supposed to have written the lyrics and melodies, and I was paid to do it. I did some production work on it, and the next thing I knew there were press releases that I was in the band. ... I&#x27;m not in the band.&quot; In a January 2015 &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; interview, both Weiland and the Votta brothers from Anarchy stated it was a studio project that Weiland was never meant to tour with and that Anarchy would have to find a lead singer outside of the tracks Weiland had already contributed. Following Weiland&#x27;s death, the lead vocalist position in Art of Anarchy was filled by former Creed vocalist Scott Stapp.
=== Solo career and the Wildabouts ===
While STP went on hiatus after the release of &quot;Tiny Music ...&quot;, Weiland released a solo album called &quot;12 Bar Blues&quot; (1998). Weiland wrote most of the songs on the album and collaborated with several artists, notably Daniel Lanois, Sheryl Crow, Brad Mehldau, and Jeff Nolan.

On November 25, 2008, Weiland released his second solo album, &quot;&quot;Happy&quot; in Galoshes&quot;, produced by Weiland and songwriting-producing partner Doug Grean. Weiland went on tour in early 2009 to promote the album.
On August 30, 2011, Weiland released a covers album, &quot;A Compilation of Scott Weiland Cover Songs&quot;, exclusively through his website. The album was originally to be released along with Weiland&#x27;s autobiography until he decided to release it separately, stating, &quot;[It] actually turned out so well that we&#x27;re going to release a single and put it out on its own, &#x27;cause I think it&#x27;s ... it&#x27;s sort of my &quot;Pin Ups&quot;, I guess you&#x27;d say.&quot;

On October 4, 2011, Weiland released &quot;The Most Wonderful Time of the Year&quot;, an album consisting entirely of Christmas music. Weiland supported the album with a US club tour. Two promotional recordings were taken from the album, cover versions of &quot;Winter Wonderland&quot; and &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Home for Christmas&quot; with their respective music videos.

Scott Weiland and the Wildabouts&#x27; Purple at the Core tour commenced in March 2013 with pop/rock band MIGGS as the opening act.

In an interview with San Diego radio station KBZT in June 2014, Weiland stated that his debut album with the Wildabouts, titled &quot;Blaster&quot;, would be released in November that year. However, it was pushed back and eventually released on March 31, 2015. Guitarist Jeremy Brown died the day before the album&#x27;s release. The cause of death was determined to be multiple drug intoxication, with coronary atherosclerosis and cardiomegaly being significant contributing factors. Nick Maybury replaced Brown in April 2015.

== Business ventures ==
In 2006, Weiland launched his own record label, Softdrive Records, with his songwriting partner Doug Grean. Later, Weiland announced that his label signed the up-and-coming rock band Something to Burn.

On December 19, 2008, Weiland signed a publishing deal with Bug Music, allowing Weiland to &quot;receive funding to pursue the development of creative projects and writers for Bug Music through his co-founded label, Softdrive Records.&quot; The deal included Weiland&#x27;s share of the Stone Temple Pilots catalog and any solo work produced thereafter.

On January 21, 2009, Weiland announced the launch of his clothing line, Weiland for English Laundry, in partnership with designer Christopher Wicks.

== Artistry ==
Weiland&#x27;s vocal and musical style proved to be versatile, evolving constantly throughout his career. At the peak of Stone Temple Pilots&#x27; success in the early to mid-1990s, Weiland displayed a deep, baritone vocal style that was compared to that of Pearl Jam singer Eddie Vedder. However, as STP continued to branch out throughout its career, so did Weiland&#x27;s vocal style. The band&#x27;s third album, &quot;Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop&quot;, had Weiland singing in a much higher, raspier tone to complement the band&#x27;s more 60&#x27;s rock-influenced sound. Later albums showcased Weiland&#x27;s influences ranging from bossa nova on &quot;Shangri-La Dee Da&quot; to blues rock and classic rock on the band&#x27;s 2010 self-titled album.

Weiland&#x27;s first solo record, &quot;12 Bar Blues&quot; (1998), represented a huge shift in Weiland&#x27;s style, as the album featured a sound &quot;rooted in glam rock, filtered through psychedelia and trip-hop&quot;. With Velvet Revolver, Weiland&#x27;s vocals ranged from his classic baritone to a rawer style to complement the band&#x27;s hard rock sound. A &quot;New York Post&quot; review of Velvet Revolver&#x27;s 2007 album &quot;Libertad&quot; commented that &quot;Weiland&#x27;s vocals are crisp and controlled, yet passionate.&quot;

Weiland&#x27;s second solo album, 2008&#x27;s &quot;&quot;Happy&quot; in Galoshes&quot;, featured a wide variety of musical genres, such as bossa nova, country, neo-psychedelia and indie rock. Weiland&#x27;s 2011 solo effort, the Christmas album &quot;The Most Wonderful Time of the Year&quot; consisted entirely of Christmas music in a crooning style similar to that of David Bowie and Frank Sinatra, as well as some reggae and bossa nova.

== Personal life ==
=== Relationships and family ===
Weiland married Janina Castaneda on September 17, 1994, and they divorced in 2000. He married Mary Forsberg on May 20, 2000, and they had a son named Noah (born 2000) and a daughter named Lucy (born 2002) before divorcing in 2007.

In 2005, Weiland and his son Noah were featured on comedian David Spade&#x27;s &quot;The Showbiz Show with David Spade&quot; during a comedy sketch about discouraging music file sharing. Noah has a line during the sketch in which he tells a little girl, &quot;Please buy my daddy&#x27;s album so I can have food to eat.&quot;

Mary Forsberg&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Fall to Pieces&quot; was co-written with Larkin Warren and released in 2009. Weiland&#x27;s autobiography &quot;Not Dead &amp; Not for Sale&quot; was co-written with David Ritz and released May 17, 2011.

In a November 2012 interview with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, Weiland revealed that he was engaged to Jamie Wachtel, whom he met during the 2011 filming of his music video for &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Home for Christmas&quot;. They married at their Los Angeles home on June 22, 2013.

In late 2020, Weiland&#x27;s son Noah Weiland debuted his new band Suspect208, which also featured Slash&#x27;s son London on drums and Robert Trujillo&#x27;s son Tye on bass. Their debut song &quot;Long Awaited&quot; was described by &quot;Wall of Sound&quot; as being reminiscent of &quot;Purple-&quot;era Stone Temple Pilots. In early 2021, Noah was fired from the band for drug use, and the rest of the band dissolved by May of the same year.

=== Substance use and health problems ===
In 1995, Weiland was convicted of buying crack cocaine and sentenced to one year of probation. His drug use did not end after his sentence but rather increased, and he moved into a hotel room for two months; in the room next door was Courtney Love, who later said that the pair &quot;shot drugs the whole time&quot; together.

Weiland revealed in 2001 that he was diagnosed with bipolar disorder.

In a 2005 interview with &quot;Esquire&quot;, Weiland said that while performing in his first bands as a teenager, his drinking &quot;escalated&quot; and he began using cocaine for the first time, which he referred to as a &quot;sexual&quot; experience. In December 2007, he was arrested and charged with driving under the influence, his first arrest in over four years. On February 7, 2008, he checked into rehab and left in early March.

Weiland&#x27;s younger brother Michael died of cardiomyopathy in early 2007. The Velvet Revolver songs &quot;For a Brother&quot; and &quot;Pills, Demons, &amp; Etc&quot; from the album &quot;Libertad&quot; are about him. Weiland said in an interview with MTV News in November 2008 that several songs on &quot;&quot;Happy&quot; in Galoshes&quot; were inspired by the death of his brother and his separation from Mary Forsberg. In the same article, MTV News reported that Weiland had not done heroin since December 5, 2002. Weiland admitted that he went through a &quot;very short&quot; cocaine binge in late 2007.

In April 2015, online footage from a concert raised questions about Weiland&#x27;s health, as he appeared unsteady and was singing markedly out of tune and in a slurred voice. A representative for Weiland asserted that lack of sleep, several drinks and a faulty earpiece were to blame, not drugs. In June 2015, Weiland claimed that he had been off drugs for 13 years. His response was directed towards comments made by Filter&#x27;s frontman Richard Patrick, who claimed Weiland was using drugs and that his fans were pushing him closer to death by &quot;sticking up for&quot; him.

After Weiland&#x27;s death, the Wildabouts&#x27; tour manager Aaron Mohler said, &quot;A lot of times I&#x27;ve seen Scott do coke so he could drink more.&quot;

Shortly after his death, Weiland&#x27;s widow Jamie acknowledged that her husband was drinking heavily before he left on his band&#x27;s last tour, but that he promised her that he would &quot;get it together&quot;. She accompanied him on the tour for a week in November and said that he was &quot;just killing it&quot; onstage and &quot;taking it up a notch&quot; every night.

Weiland had hepatitis C, which he may have acquired from intravenous drug use.

== Death ==
Weiland was found dead on his tour bus in Bloomington, Minnesota, on December 3, 2015. He was 48 years old and had been on tour with the Wildabouts. The band&#x27;s scheduled gig that evening in nearby Medina had been cancelled several days earlier, though they were still planning to play the next night in Rochester. Police searched the tour bus and confirmed there were small amounts of cocaine in the bedroom where Weiland was discovered dead. 

Police also found prescription drugs, including Xanax, Buprenorphine, Ziprasidone, Viagra, and hypnotics on the tour bus. Additionally, two bags of cocaine and a bag of marijuana were found. Tommy Black, bassist for the Wildabouts, was arrested on suspicion of possession of cocaine, although the charges against him were later dropped.

Despite the discovery of drugs, no underlying cause of death was immediately given. The medical examiner later determined Weiland&#x27;s death was the result of an accidental overdose of cocaine, alcohol, and methylenedioxyamphetamine (MDA). In its report, the examiner&#x27;s office also noted Weiland&#x27;s atherosclerotic cardiovascular disease, history of asthma, and prolonged substance abuse.

News of Weiland&#x27;s death quickly spread throughout the Internet, with many of his musical peers, including his former band members, along with fans and music critics throughout the world, sharing their condolences, tributes, and memories. A day following his death, his former bandmates in Stone Temple Pilots issued a statement saying that he was &quot;gifted beyond words&quot; but acknowledging his struggle with substance abuse, calling it &quot;part of [his] curse.&quot;

He was remembered by media outlets as &quot;the American musician whose mercurial vocal style was a signature of the rock band he helped start, Stone Temple Pilots, and later Velvet Revolver&quot; and &quot;a powerful voice.&quot; 

A private funeral for Weiland was held at Hollywood Forever Cemetery on December 11, 2015, in Los Angeles. Members of both Stone Temple Pilots and Velvet Revolver attended. Mary Forsberg and the two children were not in attendance, later having a private ceremony in honor of Weiland.

== Legacy ==
In the wake of Weiland&#x27;s death, many critics and peers offered re-evaluations of Weiland&#x27;s life and career, including David Fricke of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. Several other artists paid tribute to the singer by covering Stone Temple Pilots tunes in concert, including Life of Agony, Saint Asonia, Umphrey&#x27;s McGee, Candlebox, Halestorm, and Pop Evil, among others, while Chris Cornell dedicated a performance of &quot;Say Hello 2 Heaven&quot; by Temple of the Dog to the singer.

On the Smashing Pumpkins&#x27; website, Billy Corgan praised Weiland, saying: &quot;It was STP&#x27;s third album (&quot;Tiny Music... Songs from the Vatican Gift Shop),&quot; that had got me hooked, a wizardly mix of glam and post-punk, and I confessed to Scott, as well as the band many times, how wrong I&#x27;d been in assessing their native brilliance. And like Bowie can and does, it was Scott&#x27;s phrasing that pushed his music into a unique, and hard to pin down, aesthetic sonicsphere. Lastly, I&#x27;d like to share a thought which, though clumsy, I hope would please Scott In Hominum. And that is if you asked me who I truly believed were the great voices of our generation, I&#x27;d say it were he, Layne, and Kurt.&quot;

In 2018, Guns N&#x27; Roses with Slash and Duff, honored Weiland during the Not in This Lifetime... Tour by covering the Velvet Revolver hit song &quot;Slither&quot;.

<text>The history of coins stretches back to the first millennium BC/BCE. Notable early examples of coins include the Lydian Lion coins, Persian daric and siglos, Tong Bei, the dirham and gold dinar.

Coins are a major archaeological source of history. Coins convey information about language, administration, religion, economic conditions, and the ruler who minted those coins.

Coins were first made of scraps of metal by hitting a hammer positioned over an anvil. The Chinese produced primarily cast coinage, and this spread to South-East Asia and Japan. Although few non-Chinese cast coins were produced by governments, it was a common practice amongst counterfeiters. 
== Early coins ==

Ephesus&#x27; great temple of Artemis has provided evidence for the earliest coins yet known from the ancient world. The first structures in the sanctuary, buried deep under the later temples, date back to the eighth century BCE, and from that time on precious objects were used in the cult or dedicated to the goddess by her worshippers.

The Lydian Lion coins were made of electrum, a naturally occurring alloy of gold and silver but of variable precious metal value. The royal lion symbol stamped on the coin, similar to a seal, was a declaration of the value of the contents. These directly preceded ancient Greek coinage, through which Rome begot all Western coinage, and through which the Seleucids, Parthians, and Sassanians begot all Islamic coinage. Indian coinage has largely been a product of Greek, Roman, and Islamic influences. Chinese coinage, though it probably developed independently, was succeeded by Western-style coinage in the late nineteenth century. Other countries in Asia, in Africa, and elsewhere have adopted the Western approach to coinage as well.

The Lydian Lion was minted by Alyettes of Lydia, 610–560 BC. However, it took some time before ancient coins were used for commerce and trade. Even the smallest-denomination electrum coins, perhaps worth about a day&#x27;s subsistence, would have been too valuable for buying a loaf of bread. The Trojan Horse had become synonymous with the name of Agamemnon and the symbolism of the horse was stamped on the coins from Cyme in Aeolia, presumably in reference to the power of their lineage. Indeed, the daughter of Agamemnon of Cyme, Hermodike II, is credited with inventing coined money by Julius Pollux after she married King Midas - famed for turning everything he touched into gold.
The most rational explanation of this fable seems to be, that he encouraged his subjects to convert the produce of their agriculture, and other branches of industry, into money, by commerce, whence considerable wealth flowed into his own treasury... though it is more likely, that what the Greeks called invention, was rather the introduction of the knowledge of them [coins] from countries more advanced in civilization.

However, as with all fables, there is a problem with the dates. A real King Mita of Phrygia lived in the 8th century BC but coins were not invented until well after the Phrygian kingdom collapsed. Aylettes’ association with the Midas mythology came about because Lydian electrum came from the river Pactolus in which King Midas supposedly washed away his ability to turn all he touched into gold. Aylettes’ tax revenue may be the real ‘Midas touch’ financing his and his son&#x27;s, Croesus, conquests. There were some pre-coin types, with no recognisable image, used in the Ionian city of Miletus and the island of Samos but it is noteworthy that the coins from Cyme, when first circulated around 600-550 BC, utilised the symbol of the horse - tying them to the house of Agamemnon and the glory of the Greek victory over Troy. Cyme, being geographically and politically close to Lydia, took their invention of &#x27;nobleman&#x27;s tax-token&#x27; to the citizens - thus making Cyme&#x27;s rough incuse horse head silver fractions, Hemiobols, a candidate for the title of the Second Oldest coins - and the first used for retailing on a large-scale basis by the Ionian Greeks, quickly spreading Market Economics through the rest of the world. For a timeline graphic showing the progression from pre-coin, to lion, to horsehead imagery on the earliest coins, see Basic Electrum Types.
Since that time, coins have been the most universal embodiment of money. These first coins were made of electrum, a naturally occurring pale yellow mixture of gold and silver that was further alloyed with silver and copper.

However, the Persian daric was the first gold coin which, along with a similar silver coin, the siglos, (From Ancient Greek σίγλος, Hebrew שֶׁקֶל (shékel)) represented the bimetallic monetary standard of the Achaemenid Persian Empire which has continued until today. Also, the Persian coins were very well known in the Persian and Sassanids era. Most notably, in Susa and in Ctesiphon.

Some of the most famous and widely collected coins of antiquity are Roman coins and Greek coins.

The Byzantine Empire minted many coins (&quot;see Byzantine currency&quot;), including very thin gold coins bearing the image of the Christian cross and various Byzantine emperors.

Coins of the 7th century Umayyad Caliphate included the silver dirham and gold dinar.

A tomb of the Chinese Shang dynasty dating back to the 11th century BCE shows what may be the first cast copper money Tong Bei. Coinage was in widespread use by the Warring States period and the Han dynasty. Also a lot of coins in China had a hole through the center so they could be tied on to a string.

Silver and gold coins are the most common and universally recognized throughout history, even today. Mints around the world still make millions of gold and silver coins, including the Canadian Silver Maple Leaf, the American Gold Eagle, and the Australian Nugget. Copper, nickel, and other metals are also common, but in lower denominations.

Celtic coinage was minted by the Celts from the late 4th century BC to the mid 1st century AD.

==Minting technologies==

Coins were first made of scraps of metal. Ancient coins were produced through a process of hitting a hammer positioned over an anvil. The rich iconography of the obverse of the early electrum coins contrasts with the dull appearance of their reverse which usually carries only punch marks. The shape and number of these punches varied according to their denomination and weight-standard. 
 The earliest coins have a “rough incuse” where the hammer was beaten directly onto the reverse. Later technology used a “punch”, often a “square incuse”, to improve the aim of the hammer - sometimes resulting in a swastika pattern. Punches developed to bear the mark of the minter and finally to have their own design - leading to double sided coins. For a timeline graphic showing the progression from rough incuse to patterned reverses, see Basic Electrum Types. Some lion coins are completely covered by countermarks, in some cases more than ten. These marks were probably applied by moneychangers and bankers to coins that they considered of correct weight and alloy (counterfeits were not uncommon). If these coins came into their hands again, they would recognise their marks and have no need to test the coins again.

The Chinese produced primarily cast coinage, and this spread to South-East Asia and Japan. Relatively few non-Chinese cast coins were produced by governments, however it was a common practice amongst counterfeiters. Since the early 18th century and before, presses (normally referred to as mills in coin collecting circles) have been used in the west, beginning with screw presses and progressing in the 19th century towards steam driven presses. The first of these presses were developed in France and Germany, and quickly spread to Britain. Modern minting techniques use electric and hydraulic presses.

The type of mintage method (being hammered, milled or cast) does limit the materials which can be used for the coin. For example, antimony coins, (which are very rare) are nearly always cast examples, because of the brittle nature of the metal, and thus it would break if deformed, which is a key part of the milling and hammering process.

<doc id="367140" wikidata="Q1126725" url="?curid=367140" title="Conrad Burns">
<text>Conrad Ray Burns (January 25, 1935 – April 28, 2016) was an American politician and lobbyist who served as a United States Senator from Montana from 1989 to 2007. He was only the second Republican popularly elected to represent Montana in the Senate and was the longest-serving Republican senator in Montana history.

While in the Senate, Burns sat on the Senate Appropriations Committee and was the chairman of its Subcommittee on the Interior. He was also chairman of the Commerce, Science, and Transportation Committee&#x27;s Communications subcommittee.

==Early life==
Burns was born on a farm near Gallatin, Missouri, to Russell and Mary Frances (Knight) Burns. He graduated from Gallatin High School in 1952 and then enrolled in the College of Agriculture at the University of Missouri. He was also a member of the Alpha Gamma Rho fraternity. Two years later Burns left without graduating and enlisted in the Marine Corps in 1955. He served in Japan and Korea as a small-arms instructor.

After his military service in 1957, Burns began working for Trans World Airlines and Ozark Air Lines. In 1962, he traveled the state of Montana as a field representative for &quot;Polled Hereford World&quot; magazine in Billings, He married Phyllis Jean Kuhlmann in 1967; they had three children, Kate, Keely, and Garrett.

In 1968, he turned down a transfer to Iowa and became a cattle auctioneer for the Billings Livestock Commission. He became the first manager of the Northern International Livestock Exposition. He also began reporting on agricultural market news, started a radio show and later working as a farm reporter for KULR-TV.

In 1975, Burns founded the Northern Agricultural Network with four radio stations. The NAN had grown to serve thirty-one radio stations and six television stations by 1986, when he sold it to enter politics. Angry at a local politician, he won a seat on the Yellowstone County Commission, where he served for two years.

==U.S. Senate elections==

===1988===
Though a political novice, Burns had a great deal of name recognition from his previous jobs, and the Republican Party recruited him to run against incumbent Democratic Senator John Melcher, a popular veterinarian. Burns portrayed Melcher as &quot;a liberal who is soft on drugs, soft on defense and very high on social programs.&quot; At the time a strong supporter of term limits, Burns said Melcher had been in Washington, D.C., too long. Melcher was also hurt by public opposition to policies in Yellowstone National Park regarding naturally occurring fires and by President Ronald Reagan&#x27;s pocket veto of Melcher&#x27;s bill, which would have made 1.4 million acres (5,700 km2) of Montana forest off-limits to logging and mineral development. Burns defeated Melcher in a close race, 51–48 percent. He was helped by the success in Montana of Vice President George H. W. Bush, the Republican presidential nominee.

===1994===
Former Senator Melcher was among the candidates in the Democratic primary, but that race was won by Jack Mudd, former dean of the University of Montana law school in Missoula.

Burns was reelected in a landslide, 62–38 percent over Mudd, whose campaign observers described as &quot;underfunded and puzzling&quot;.

===2000===

Burns faced an unexpectedly difficult reelection campaign in 2000. In February 1999, he announced that he would break his 1988 promise to hold office for only two terms, saying, &quot;Circumstances have changed, and I have rethought my position.&quot; Later that same month, while giving a speech about American dependence on foreign oil to the Montana Equipment Dealers Association, he referred to Arabs as &quot;ragheads.&quot; Burns soon apologized, saying that he &quot;became too emotionally involved&quot; during the speech.

The Democratic nominee was Brian Schweitzer, a rancher from Whitefish, Montana. While Burns attempted to link Schweitzer with presidential candidate Al Gore, whom Schweitzer had never met, Schweitzer &quot;effectively portrayed himself as nonpolitical.&quot; Schweitzer challenged Burns primarily on the issue of prescription drugs, organizing busloads of senior citizens to take trips to Canada and Mexico for cheaper medicine. Burns charged that Schweitzer favored &quot;Canadian-style government controls&quot; and claimed that senior citizens went to doctors to have &quot;somebody to visit with. There&#x27;s nothing wrong with them.&quot; Burns also faced trouble regarding deaths from asbestos in Libby, Montana. While he initially supported a bill to limit compensation in such cases, he withdrew his support for the bill under public criticism and added $11.5 million for the town to an appropriations bill.

Burns spent twice as much money as Schweitzer on the election and defeated him by only a slim margin, 51-47 percent, while the state voted 58-33 percent for Republican presidential nominee George W. Bush. Schweitzer was elected Governor of Montana in 2004.

In December 2003, Burns and Senator Ron Wyden, an Oregon Democrat, were pleased that their legislation to combat spam, the CAN-SPAM Act, had been signed into law. Burns said, &quot;Senator Wyden and I have worked during this time to come up with common-sense legislation to deal with spam and I think we&#x27;ve been successful.&quot; But in April 2005 anti-spam organization Spamhaus indicated that they were far from satisfied that the problem of spam coming from the U.S. had been addressed. Spamhaus head Steve Linford said, &quot;Until America makes changes, everyone will still be plastered with spam.&quot;

In mid-2006, Burns told the &quot;Associated Press&quot;, which was doing an article on Congressional caucuses, that he had joined the Sweetener Caucus at the behest of sugar beet growers in his state. &quot;I don&#x27;t think I&#x27;ve ever attended,&quot; Burns said of caucus meetings. &quot;I do what my growers tell me. I know we grow a lot of sugar beets in Montana.&quot;

===2006===
Because of his narrow win in 2000, the Democratic turnover over of Montana&#x27;s state government in 2004, polls in 2006 putting his support in the state at around 40 percent, and high disapproval ratings from the Jack Abramoff scandal, Burns was considered one of the most vulnerable senators facing reelection in 2006.

On June 6, 2006, Burns easily won the Republican primary. In the November general election, his Democratic opponent was Montana State Senate President and organic farmer Jon Tester. In early August, &quot;CQPolitics&quot; changed its rating on the race from &quot;Leans Republican&quot; to &quot;No Clear Favorite.&quot;
According to some polls, Burns&#x27;s approval rating had fallen as low as 39 percent, lower than any other U.S. Senator&#x27;s.

Since at least August, the Montana Democratic Party had paid staffer Kevin O&#x27;Brien to follow Burns around the nation. O&#x27;Brien filmed the senator at all his public events, including Senate committee hearings and campaign appearances. These tapes&#x27; contents were used for a variety of press releases and even a YouTube music video. During the 2000 race against Schweitzer, cameraman Matt McKenna had been paid to trail Burns. McKenna worked as a spokesman for the Tester campaign.

In an October election debate with Tester, regarding the Iraq War, Burns said that Tester &quot;says our president doesn&#x27;t have a plan. I think he&#x27;s got one. He&#x27;s not going to tell everyone in the world&quot;, and later told Tester, &quot;We&#x27;re not going to tell you what our plan is, Jon, because you&#x27;re just going to go out and blow it.&quot;

On November 9, 2006, Burns conceded the election to Tester. On November 15, he angrily responded to questions about his remaining time as a lame-duck senator, saying, &quot;I&#x27;m not going to negotiate my problems with the goddamn press... Goodbye! Goodbye! Goodbye!&quot;

==Congressional record==

===Overall===
In April 2006, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Burns one of America&#x27;s Five Worst Senators. It dubbed him &quot;The Shock Jock&quot; and called him &quot;serially offensive&quot; for his many controversial statements, such as a 1999 remark in which he called Arabs &quot;ragheads.&quot; The magazine also criticized his &quot;meager&quot; legislative record and his legal problems involving Jack Abramoff. Burns&#x27;s ratings from interest groups indicate a conservative Republican voting record. According to Project Vote Smart, Burns&#x27;s rating by major think tanks and political action committees were as follows:
*NARAL Pro-Choice America: 0%
*National Right to Life Committee: 100%
*American Conservative Union: 91%
*American Civil Liberties Union: 0%
*U.S. Chamber of Commerce: 94%
*National Education Association: 0%
*League of Conservation Voters: 5%
*Christian Coalition of America: 100%
*Cato Institute: 70%
*NRA Political Victory Fund: A
*American Public Health Association: 10%
*American Land Rights Association: 100%
*AFL–CIO: 29%
*National Taxpayers Union: 67%

Burns was also well known for his ability to obtain appropriations for his home state.

===First term===
After the passage of the Civil Rights Act of 1991, Burns invited a group of racially mixed lobbyists to a &quot;slave auction.&quot; Following criticism, Burns responded that in such events &quot;you have an auction and you sell the kids and they perform a day&#x27;s work for whoever buys them&quot; and said they were &quot;rather common in Montana.&quot;

===Second term===
During a visit to the &quot;Bozeman Daily Chronicle&quot;, Burns told one of the editors an anecdote about an elderly Montana rancher who asked him about life in Washington. The rancher asked &quot;Conrad, how can you live back there with all those niggers?&quot; and Burns replied that it was &quot;a hell of a challenge.&quot; After his remarks were criticized, Burns issued an apology, saying, &quot;Such views are inappropriate and belong in the past and that was the context in which the story was told...they are views which I do not condone and do not share.&quot; But when asked why he did not condemn the term when he heard it, Burns replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t know, I never give it much thought.&quot;

===Third term===
One of Burns&#x27;s more notable political blunders was blaming Canada for lax immigration policies. He asserted that one or more of the hijackers in the September 11 attacks entered the U.S. from Canada, a statement later proved untrue by the Canadian ambassador.

==Post-Senate career==
After leaving office, Burns joined the lobbying firm of GAGE, founded by his former chief of staff, Leo Giacometto. He also founded Rural Solutions Corporation, a communications company that expands broadband communications in rural areas, and maintained his auction business. In February 2008, Burns registered as a lobbyist for the American Quarter Horse Association.

On December 9, 2009, Burns was hospitalized after suffering from a stroke, likely as a result of atrial fibrillation, at his Arlington, Virginia home. He was taken to Virginia Hospital Center before being transferred to the intensive-care unit of a Washington, D.C. hospital. He stayed at National Rehabilitation Hospital and then returned home to Montana.

In 2012, Burns endorsed Congressman Denny Rehberg in his Senate bid against Jon Tester. Rehberg&#x27;s bid failed, and Tester was reelected. Burns died in Billings, Montana on April 28, 2016, at the age of 81.

==Ethics and notable incidents==

In September 2006, the Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW) released its second annual report on the most corrupt members of Congress, titled &quot;Beyond DeLay: The 20 Most Corrupt Members of Congress (and five to watch).&quot; Burns was included as one of the 20 most corrupt members of Congress after having also been listed in the first annual report. The organization said, &quot;His ethics issues stem from campaign contributions he accepted in apparent exchange for exercising his authority as chairman of an appropriations subcommittee and on a trip some of his staff members took to the 2001 Super Bowl.&quot;

===Abramoff and tribal contributions===

Burns had accepted about $150,000 in contributions from Jack Abramoff and his clients and associates. He later gave that money away after Democrats criticized his connections to the lobbyist. Two of Burns&#x27;s staffers also later worked for Abramoff. In early 2008, the Justice Department notified Burns that he was no longer part of their investigation.

====Contributions and connections====
Between 2001 and 2004, while chair of the Interior Subcommittee on Appropriations, Burns received nearly $150,000 in campaign contributions from lobbyist Jack Abramoff, Abramoff&#x27;s clients and other donors connected to Abramoff. According to a 2006 report by PoliticalMoneyLine.com, published in &quot;Roll Call&quot;, Burns received $192,090 in campaign contributions from tribal entities between 2001 and 2005. In addition, a friend of Abramoff&#x27;s said in October 2006 that Burns&#x27;s staff ate so many free meals at Abramoff&#x27;s restaurant that people joked they would have &quot;starved to death&quot; without the lobbyist. Burns later returned the money.

In December 2005, a leader of a tribe that gave Burns $22,000 in campaign contributions in 2002 said the tribe had done so solely at Abramoff&#x27;s request and believed the senator was part of &quot;Abramoff&#x27;s group.&quot; In a 2006 &quot;Vanity Fair&quot; article, Abramoff was quoted as saying, &quot;Every appropriation we wanted from Senator Conrad Burns&#x27; committee we got.&quot; Burns denied that he was influenced by Abramoff.

Beginning in 2001, Mark Baker, a former Burns aide who was the chief lobbyist for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in 2003 and 2004 and the Burns 2006 campaign chairman donated $9,000 to Burns and his Friends of the Big Sky Leadership PAC. Baker is also affiliated with the DC lobbying firm Denny Miller Associates Inc., whose members donated at least $27,000 to Burns and his PAC during the same period.

====Tribal school====
In January 2003, an attempt by the two senators from Michigan to get money for a school of the Saginaw Chippewa Tribe of Michigan, an Abramoff client and one of the wealthiest tribes in the country (each member gets $70,000 per year from gambling profits), was unsuccessful. The Bureau of Indian Affairs said the tribe&#x27;s school wasn&#x27;t eligible, based on the authorizing statute for the program. The tribe, and Abramoff, its lobbyist, then began working with Burns. Abramoff&#x27;s lobbying team had strong connections with Burns&#x27;s staff. Among their ranks was Shawn Vasell, an Appropriations aide who shuttled back and forth between jobs on Burns&#x27;s staff and Abramoff&#x27;s shop. Ryan Thomas, another Burns appropriations staffer, and Burns&#x27;s chief of staff, Will M. Brooke, were treated to a trip to the 2001 Super Bowl in Florida on a corporate jet leased by Abramoff&#x27;s team.

In May 2003, Burns and his counterpart, Charles Taylor, the chairman of the House Interior Subcommittee, sent a letter to the Interior Department, arguing the Saginaw Chippewa&#x27;s case. But the department and the bureau remained firm in their refusal. In late October 2003, just before the final vote on the Interior appropriations bill, Burns inserted a paragraph at the request of the Michigan Senators – an earmark – in the bill&#x27;s conference report. It lifted previous restrictions and directed that the Saginaw Chippewa Indians be given $3 million for their tribal school.

The tribe donated $32,000 to Burns from 2001 to 2003.

====National Bison Range====
In the 1990s, Burns opposed the transfer of management of the National Bison Range (NBR) in Moiese, Montana, to the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes (CSKT), introduced a draft bill opposing tribal jurisdiction, and supported Senator Slade Gorton&#x27;s S. 1691, which called Tribal Sovereign Immunity into question. At the time, Burns said that tribal sovereign immunity interfered with citizens&#x27; Fifth Amendment rights.

In 2001 and 2002, Burns&#x27;s policies changed, and his DC staff told citizens of western Montana that he would not support any legislation concerning tribal government unless all 500+ tribes agree to it.

In 2003, the CSKT renewed negotiations over the NBR. Officials from the United States Fish and Wildlife Service in Denver stated at the time that Burns had the authority to stop the management transfer. On March 14, 2005, the day before a new NBR agreement went into effect with the tribes, CSKT chairman Fred Matt wrote in a &quot;Missoulian&quot; guest column, &quot;Sen. Burns has been a positive and aggressive advocate for Indian Country...&quot; and &quot;Burns fully understands and appreciates consultation with Indian country, our sovereignty, and our right to self-determination&quot;.

====Involvement of staffers and aides====
Less than two months after a key earmark by Burns in October 2003, Burns&#x27;s chief of staff, Will Brooke, went to work for Abramoff at the lobbying firm Greenberg Traurig.

In June 2005, former Burns staffer Shawn Vasell was called as a witness at a hearing before the Senate Committee on Indian Affairs. Vasell was registered as a lobbyist for the Choctaw and Coushatta tribes in 2001, joined Burns&#x27;s staff in 2002, then rejoined Abramoff&#x27;s team as a lobbyist for the tribes in 2003. He refused to testify, citing his Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination.

Mark Baker, a former legislative director for Burns, and Burns&#x27;s 2006 campaign chairman, was paid $60,000 to be the chief lobbyist for the Confederated Salish and Kootenai Tribes in 2003 and 2004. Working through his Helena firm, Anderson and Baker, Baker also made $120,000 lobbying for the CSKT business venture S&amp;K Technologies during those same years, and another $40,000 working for the CSKT through the Giacometto Group. Leo Giacometto was Burns&#x27;s chief of staff from 1995 to 1999.

====Returning of &quot;tainted&quot; campaign contributions====
Burns returned the entirety of Abramoff&#x27;s personal donations to charity. When possible, Burns returned contributions to the tribes where they originated.

His attempt to make a $111,000 donation to the Montana-Wyoming Tribal Leaders Council was rejected; the council said the money was tainted because it originally came from Abramoff and his clients. Julia Doney, president of the Fort Belknap Indian Community Council and a member of the tribal leaders council, said that the tribes are &quot;tired of being used&quot; and didn&#x27;t want to help Burns with his political troubles.

The Blackfeet Community College also refused to accept money from Burns because it came from Jack Abramoff. James St. Goddard, a Blackfeet council member, told the &quot;Great Falls Tribune&quot;
that taking the money &quot;would have made it look like the money is clean. We do not want Mr. Burns to use the tribes any more for his political gain.&quot;

===Inland Northwest Space Alliance===
In May 2006, a University of Montana spinoff that had federal funding of more than $4 million, through efforts by Burns, became part of an investigation by the NASA Office of Inspector General. In 2004 the Inland Northwest Space Alliance, a nonprofit company, paid $270,000 to a software company, Compressus, for &quot;project management,&quot; via a no-bid contract. In the same year, Compressus paid $220,000 in lobbying fees to the firm of Burns&#x27;s former chief of staff Leo Giacometto; INSA also paid Giacometto $20,000 in fees that year. Burns&#x27;s daughter, Keely Burns, was invited to join the INSA board, but said she had no involvement other than attending organizational meetings. She also served on Compressus&#x27;s board of advisers for a year. In 2005, Giacometto was the lobbyist for the University of Montana, for which he was paid $79,750.

In October 2006, the &quot;Missoulian&quot; reported further problems with IMSA and with the University of Montana&#x27;s Northern Rockies Center for Space Privatization, which has a history of sharing employees with INSA, some of whom are related.

Earlier in October 2006, the Washington D.C. newspaper &quot;Roll Call&quot; reported that Montana legislative auditors gave the FBI evidence not included in their June report indicating &quot;there was clear criminal activity&quot; involved in the alliance between INSA, Burns and Giacometto. State officials say &quot;Roll Call&#x27;s&quot; report was incorrect. &quot;I have talked with an FBI agent and an investigator with the NASA Office of Inspector General,&quot; Missoula County Attorney Fred Van Valkenburg said. &quot;They are doing some interviewing of witnesses and have not completed their work. Until they do, I won&#x27;t proceed any further.&quot;

===Comments about firefighters===
In July 2006, Burns serendipitously met up with a group of firefighters waiting for their flight home at the Billings airport. According to a state report, he told the firefighters that they had done a &quot;piss-poor job.&quot; They had been working to put out a fire near Billings. Burns had earlier been speaking with some local ranchers who were unhappy about the way the firefighters had done their job. According to a spokesperson, Burns had not yet spoken about this with anyone in authority in the fire service, or heard a firefighter&#x27;s point of view.

The &quot;Billings Gazette&quot; reported, &quot;U.S. Senator Conrad Burns pointed across the Billings airport Sunday and accused a member of an elite firefighting team of not doing &#x27;a God damned thing&#x27; and charged that crew members just &#x27;sit around&#x27; on the job, the original version of a state report said.&quot;

Burns was also surprised when told by an employee of the Montana Department of Natural Resources and Conservation that the firefighters in question made about $8–12/hour.

On August 14, 2006, a reporter from the &quot;Daily Press&quot; of Newport News, Virginia called Burns&#x27;s office for comment on the firefighter remark. A young staffer who answered, erroneously believing the reporter to be a friend, proceeded with a host of obscenity-laced comments not intended for public consumption. The aide at one point even allegedly said, &quot;...you can tell Senator George Allen of Virginia to [vulgarity deleted].&quot; The Democratic Party called on Burns to apologize.

===Immigration comments===
During a debate in 2006 against Democratic opponent Jon Tester, Burns commented that he was on the telephone with his contractor when he saw an interview with an illegal immigrant on television. The immigrant featured in the interview said he was a roofer and was headed north. Burns said that he told the contractor, &quot;You better go out and get your help or you won&#x27;t get my house roofed.&quot;

At a June meeting, Burns said &quot;The other day, the little fella who does our maintenance work around the house, he&#x27;s from Guatemala, and I said, &#x27;Could I see your green card?&#x27; And Hugo says, &#x27;No.&#x27; I said, &#x27;Oh gosh.&#x27;&quot; (Burns spokesman Jason Klindt said the worker was in the United States legally, owned a painting company, and that Burns &quot;never had any doubt&quot; that he was a legal resident.)

In August, at a campaign event, Burns interrupted his speech to take a cellphone call. After speaking a bit and hanging up, he told the audience, &quot;Hugo is a nice little Guatemalan man who is doing some painting for me ... in Virginia.&quot; After some laughter from the audience, Burns said &quot;No, he&#x27;s terrific, love him.&quot;

===Taxicab terrorists===
On August 25, 2006, at a campaign event in Miles City, Burns said of the military: &quot;We thank God for those young people that do it every day and every night to fight this enemy that&#x27;s a taxicab driver in the daytime but a killer at night.&quot;

Burns went on to repeat his &quot;taxicab driver&quot; analogy several times over the next few days. On August 27, 2006, in Butte, Burns said, &quot;This campaign is about the next generation; it is if we have a safe world and a secure world where our kids can go to bed at night and not worry about a guy that drives a taxicab in the daytime and kills at night.&quot;

Again, at a campaign event on August 30, 2006, Burns, while discussing the War on Terrorism, spoke of a &quot;faceless enemy&quot; of terrorists who &quot;drive taxicabs in the daytime and kill at night.&quot;

A spokesman for Burns&#x27;s campaign said, &quot;The point is there are terrorists that live amongst us. Not only here, but in Britain and the entire world. Whether they are taxi drivers or investment bankers, the fact remains that this is a new type of enemy.&quot;

===Untoward editing of Wikipedia===
In February 2006, it was reported that an unidentified member of Burns&#x27;s staff had sought to remove from his Wikipedia biography pejorative comments Burns had made and replace them &quot;glowing&quot; praise as &quot;the voice of the farmer&quot;. The edits were detected by Wikinews editors and later reported in the press.

==Death==
Burns died on April 28, 2016, of complications from a stroke. He was interred in Arlington National Cemetery on July 17, 2017.

<doc id="367146" wikidata="Q1816505" url="?curid=367146" title="Philippine Airlines Flight 434">
<text>Philippine Airlines Flight 434, sometimes referred to as PAL434 or PR434, was a scheduled flight on December 11, 1994, from Manila to Tokyo with a quick stopover in Cebu on a Boeing 747-283B that was seriously damaged by a bomb, killing one passenger and damaging vital control systems, although the plane was in a repairable state. The bombing was a test run of the unsuccessful Bojinka terrorist attacks. The Boeing 747 was flying the second leg of a route from Mactan–Cebu International Airport in Cebu, Philippines to Narita International Airport, in Tokyo, Japan. After the bomb detonated, 58-year-old veteran pilot Captain Eduardo &quot;Ed&quot; Reyes was able to land the aircraft, saving it and the remaining passengers and crew.

Authorities later discovered that Ramzi Yousef, a passenger on the aircraft&#x27;s prior flight leg from Manila&#x27;s Ninoy Aquino International Airport, had placed the explosive. Yousef boarded the flight under the fake Italian name &quot;Armaldo Forlani&quot;, an incorrect spelling of the name of the Italian legislator and Prime Minister of Italy from 1980 to 1981 Arnaldo Forlani, in order not to get caught. Yousef was later convicted of the 1993 World Trade Center bombing.

== Background ==

=== Aircraft ===
The aircraft operating Flight 434 was a 15-year-old Boeing 747-283BM Combi owned by Guinness Peat Aviation (GPA), registered as EI-BWF, serial number 21575. It first flew on February 17, 1979, and was delivered to Scandinavian Airlines (SAS) on March 2, 1979, as SE-DFZ, operating the plane as &quot;Knut Viking&quot;. After occasional lease periods with Nigeria Airways and Malaysia Airlines between 1983 and 1988, the aircraft was sold to Guinness Peat Aviation and leased to Philippine Airlines on September 7, 1988.

=== Crew ===
The flight crew consisted of the following:

* Captain Eduardo &quot;Ed&quot; Reyes (1936 – 14 February 2007), a 58-year old veteran pilot who served in the Philippine Air Force from 1958 to 1964, and had flown with Philippine Airlines since 1964. 
* First Officer Jaime Herrera (1948 – 27 March 2021), also a veteran pilot who had flown with Philippine Airlines since 1970. Herrera was 46 years old and was serving as co-pilot at the time of the bombing.
* Flight Engineer Dexter Comendador (born 6 November 1960), who, like Reyes, was also a Philippine Air Force pilot, serving from 1983 to 1992. He had flown with Philippine Airlines since 1992. Comendador was 34 years old at that time.

== Bombing ==
=== Setting the bomb ===

Ramzi Yousef boarded the aircraft for the Manila to Cebu leg of the flight. The plane departed from Manila at 5:35 a.m. (UTC+08:00) After the plane was airborne, he went into the lavatory with his toiletry bag in hand and took off his shoes to get out the batteries, wiring, and spark source hidden in the heel below a level where metal detectors in use at the time could not detect. Yousef removed a modified Casio digital watch from his wrist to use as a timer, unpacked the remaining materials from his toiletry bag, and assembled his bomb. He set the timer for four hours later, when he would be long disembarked and the plane would be far out over the ocean and en route to Tokyo during the next leg of its journey, put the entire bomb back into the bag, and returned to his assigned seat.

After moving to seat 26K following permission granted by a flight attendant due to his claim that he could get a better view from that seat, Yousef tucked the assembled bomb into the life vest pocket underneath. He had chosen this location based on a misunderstanding of where the fuel tanks were located on that specific 747 configuration. In some 747 configurations, the fuel tank is located underneath the center of the plane – where placement of the bomb would likely have resulted in considerable damage and could have even brought the plane down (similar to the Lockerbie bombing which occurred 6 years earlier). However, the 747 performing the flight had the fuel tank further back due to its cabin configuration, making seat 26K two rows forward of the center fuel tank. After he had finished planting the bomb, Yousef exited the aircraft in Cebu. Philippine domestic Flight Attendant Maria De La Cruz noticed that Yousef had switched seats during the Manila to Cebu flight and had exited the plane in Cebu alongside the domestic cabin crew, but did not pass this information along to the international flight crew which boarded at Cebu for the trip to Tokyo. In addition to Yousef, 25 other passengers also exited the plane at Cebu, where 256 more passengers and a new cabin crew boarded the plane for the final leg of the flight to Tokyo.

=== Explosion ===
Flight 434 landed in Cebu at 6:50 a.m., after a flight time of 1 hour 15 minutes. At 8:38 a.m., after a 38-minute delay due to airport congestion, the plane took off with a total of 273 passengers on board/ Among them was 24-year-old , a Japanese industrial sewing machine maker returning from a business trip to Cebu, occupying seat 26K. At 11:43 a.m. Eastern Indonesian Time, 4 hours after Yousef planted his bomb, the device exploded Ikegami&#x27;s seat injuring an additional ten passengers in the adjacent seats in front of and behind seat 26K. The blast also blew off a two-square-foot (0.2 m2) portion of the cabin floor leaving a gaping hole leading to the cargo hold location, and the cabin&#x27;s rapid expansion from the explosion severed a number of control cables in the ceiling that controlled the plane&#x27;s right aileron, as well as cables that connected to the steering controls of both the Captain and First Officer. Assistant purser Fernando Bayot tried to pull Ikegami out of the hole created by the explosion, but soon Bayot realized that part of Ikegami&#x27;s body was missing, and that Ikegami had died. In order to prevent additional panic, Bayot called another flight attendant over to give the appearance that they were tending to Ikegami&#x27;s needs with a blanket and oxygen mask, then reported the extent of the passenger injuries to the cockpit. 

Masaharu Mochizuki, a passenger on the flight, recalled that passengers, both injured and uninjured, tried to move away from the blast site, but cabin crew told passengers to remain in place until an assessment of the situation could be made. Of the ten passengers who were injured, one needed urgent medical care.

The severity of the disaster was reduced by several mitigating factors. With the 747 utilized on the sector having a modified seating arrangement instead of the standard layout, the hole in the floor beneath the seat punched through to the cargo hold instead of the fuel tank, sparing the plane from exploding. The bomb&#x27;s orientation, positioned front-to-back and upward angled from horizontal, caused the blast to expand vertically and lengthwise. This spared the plane&#x27;s outer structure, as Ikegami&#x27;s body absorbed most of the blast force; the lower half of his body fell into the cargo hold. Additionally, due to the 38-minute delay in takeoff from Cebu the plane was not as far out to sea as anticipated, which contributed to the captain&#x27;s available options for an emergency landing.

=== Landing ===
Immediately after the bombing, the aircraft banked hard to the right, but the autopilot quickly fixed the bank. After the blast, Captain Reyes asked Systems Engineer Dexter Comendador to survey the blast area to check for damage. Reyes placed the Mayday call, requesting landing at Naha Airport, Okinawa Island, Okinawa Prefecture. The Japanese air traffic controller experienced difficulty in trying to understand Reyes&#x27; request, so American air traffic controllers from a U.S. military base on Okinawa took over and processed Reyes&#x27; landing. They directed a USAF Learjet towards PAL 434 to visually check for damage of the outer fuselage and to verify that the landing gear was in place. The autopilot had stopped responding to Reyes&#x27; commands and the aircraft flew past Okinawa.

Reyes said in an interview for the Canadian television series &quot;Mayday&quot; that when he disengaged the autopilot, he feared that the aircraft would bank right again and the crew would lose control of the aircraft; because of the pressing need to land quickly to attend to the injured and inspect the plane for additional damage, however, Reyes instructed First Officer Jaime Herrera to take hold of his own controls and then Reyes deactivated the autopilot. The aircraft did not bank after the disengagement of the autopilot, but neither would it respond to steering inputs from either controller due to the control cable damage caused by the bomb. The crew struggled to use the ailerons, which could allow the aircraft to roll but were still unable to change the plane&#x27;s direction. After thinking through the different hypothetical methods of control, the crew settled on using asymmetric thrust to control the jet, in a very similar fashion to United Airlines Flight 232&#x27;s crew five years earlier, because other methods of control were either deemed too risky to attempt, or would not have as much effect as other ways.

By using the throttles to steer the plane, reducing air speed to both control the radius of turns and to allow the plane to descend, and dumping fuel to lessen the strain on the landing gear, the Captain landed the damaged 747 at Naha Airport at 12:45 p.m., one hour after the bomb exploded. The aircraft&#x27;s other 272 passengers and 20 crew members survived.

== The bomb ==

U.S. prosecutors said the device was a &quot;Mark II&quot; PETN &quot;microbomb&quot; constructed using Casio digital watches as described in Phase I of the Bojinka plot, for which this was a test. On Flight 434, Yousef used one tenth of the explosive power he planned to use on eleven U.S. airliners in January 1995. The bomb was, or at least all of its components were, designed to slip through airport security checks undetected. The explosive used was liquid nitroglycerin, which was disguised as a bottle of contact lens fluid.

== Aftermath ==

Manila police were able to track the batteries used in the bomb and many of its contents from Okinawa back to Manila. Police uncovered Yousef&#x27;s plan on the night of January 6 and the early morning of January 7, 1995, and Yousef was arrested a month later in Pakistan. He was extradited back to the United States to face trial wherein the New York Supreme Court gave him a life sentence with an additional 240 years. Yousef concurrently serves his terms at the ADX Florence prison. Ramzi Yousef&#x27;s accomplices also received 240 years in prison.

The flight deck and cabin crew members were commended by President Fidel Ramos for their &quot;professional handling of a potentially disastrous situation&quot; and went their separate ways following the incident. Ed Reyes transferred to Cebu Pacific to work as an Administrative Check Pilot, flight instructor, and DC-9 captain until his retirement in 2002. He served as Board Secretary and Director of Airlink International Aviation School, also working as an aviation course professor in the same institution until his death on February 14, 2007, from prostate cancer. First Officer Jaime Herrera was later promoted to Captain and continued to fly for Philippine Airlines until his retirement in 2008. He died on March 27, 2021, at the age of 73. Systems Engineer Dexter Comendador also moved to Cebu Pacific in 1998 and served as a management pilot in that company, then moved to Philippines AirAsia in 2011 where he served as COO and was later appointed as interim CEO in July 2016 and CEO in January 2017. Comendador retired in July 2019.

The aircraft, then registered as EI-BWF, was later converted to a cargo configuration as Boeing 747-283B(SF). It subsequently changed hands several times, always to air cargo companies, and was finally placed in storage in 2007 at Châteauroux-Centre &quot;Marcel Dassault&quot; Airport.

Philippine Airlines still uses the flight number 434, which currently operates as a Cebu–Narita sector that utilizes an Airbus A321 or A330. The airline retired its last 747 aircraft in September 2014. PAL still operates a Manila-Tokyo (Narita and Haneda) sector separately.

== In popular culture ==
The events of Flight 434 were featured in &quot;Bomb on Board&quot;, a Season 3 (2005) episode of the Canadian TV series &quot;Mayday&quot; (called &quot;Air Emergency&quot; and &quot;Air Disasters&quot; in the United States and &quot;Air Crash Investigation&quot; in the UK and elsewhere around the world). Filipino Canadian actor Von Flores portrayed Captain Reyes while Canadian actor and comedian Sam Kalilieh played Ramzi Yousef.

<doc id="367152" wikidata="Q1248054" url="?curid=367152" title="Lin Carter">
<text>Linwood Vrooman Carter (June 9, 1930 – February 7, 1988) was an American author of science fiction and fantasy, as well as an editor, poet and critic. He usually wrote as Lin Carter; known pseudonyms include H. P. Lowcraft (for an H. P. Lovecraft parody) and Grail Undwin. He is best known for his work in the 1970s as editor of the Ballantine Adult Fantasy series, which introduced readers to many overlooked classics of the fantasy genre.

==Life==
Carter was born in St. Petersburg, Florida. He was an avid reader of science fiction and fantasy in his youth, and became broadly knowledgeable in both fields. He was also active in fandom.

Carter served in the United States Army (infantry, Korea, 1951–53), and then attended Columbia University and took part in Leonie Adams&#x27;s Poetry Workshop (1953–54). He was an advertising and publishers&#x27; copywriter from 1957 until 1969, when he took up writing full-time. He was also an editorial consultant. During much of his writing career he lived in Hollis, New York.

Carter was married twice, first to Judith Ellen Hershkovitz (married 1959, divorced 1960) and second to Noel Vreeland (married 1963, when they were both working for the publisher Prentice-Hall; divorced 1975).

Carter was a member of the Trap Door Spiders, an all-male literary banqueting club which served as the basis of Isaac Asimov&#x27;s fictional group of mystery-solvers, the Black Widowers. Carter was the model for Asimov&#x27;s character Mario Gonzalo. Carter was also a member of the Swordsmen and Sorcerers&#x27; Guild of America (SAGA), a loose-knit group of Heroic fantasy authors founded in the 1960s, some of whose work he anthologized in the &quot;Flashing Swords!&quot; series.

In the 1970s Carter published one issue of his own fantasy fanzine &quot;Kadath&quot;, named after H. P. Lovecraft&#x27;s fictional setting (see &quot;The Dream-Quest of Unknown Kadath&quot;). About 3,000 copies were printed; however the printer was in a dispute with the binder, who held the copies. While Carter paid the printer, the printer decamped into California. When Carter went to see the binder, he was told that the copies had been kept for a while, but then most had been thrown out. Carter believed that only about 30 copies of the issue survived, thus the magazine was scarcely circulated. It contained Carter&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos story &quot;The City of Pillars&quot; (pp. 22–25).

Carter resided in East Orange, New Jersey, in his later years, and drank and smoked heavily. It was probably smoking that gave him oral cancer in 1985. Only his status as a Korean War veteran enabled him to receive extensive surgery. However, it failed to cure the cancer and left him disfigured. Carter held gatherings of writers under the aegis of &#x27;the New Kalem Club&#x27; (in tribute to the original Kalem Club) - meetings which were attended by Frank Belknap Long, Robert M. Price and others.

In the last year before his death, he had begun to reappear in print with a new book in his Terra Magica series, a long-promised Prince Zarkon pulp hero pastiche, &quot;Horror Wears Blue&quot;, and a regular column for the magazine &quot;Crypt of Cthulhu&quot;. Despite these successes, Carter increased his alcohol intake, becoming an alcoholic. His cancer resurfaced, spreading to his throat and leading to his death in Montclair, New Jersey, in 1988.

Robert M. Price, the editor of &quot;Crypt of Cthulhu&quot;, who had published a Lin Carter special issue (Vol. 5, No 2, whole number 36, Yuletide 1985), was preparing a second all-Carter issue when Carter died. It was turned into a memorial issue (Vol. 7, No 4, whole number 54, Eastertide 1988). Two further issues of the magazine were devoted to Carter alone (see References below). Price was also appointed Carter&#x27;s literary executor.

==Writing career==

A longtime science-fiction and fantasy fan, Carter first appeared in print with entertaining letters to &quot;Startling Stories&quot; and other pulp magazines in 1943 and again in the late 1940s. He issued two volumes of fantasy verse, &quot;Sandalwood and Jade&quot; (1951), technically his first book, and &quot;Galleon of Dream&quot; (1955) (see Poetry in Bibliography below) His first professional publication was the short story &quot;Masters of the Metropolis&quot;, co-written with Randall Garrett, and published by Anthony Boucher in &quot;The Magazine of Fantasy and Science Fiction&quot;, April 1957. Another early collaborative story, &quot;The Slitherer from the Slime&quot; (&quot;Inside SF&quot;, September 1958), by Carter, as &quot;H. P. Lowcraft&quot;, with Dave Foley, is a parody of H. P. Lovecraft. The story &quot;Uncollected Works&quot; (&quot;Fantasy and SF&quot;, March 1965) was a finalist for the annual Nebula Award for Best Short Story, from the SF and fantasy writers, the only time Carter was a runner-up for a major award.

Early in his efforts to establish himself as a writer, Carter gained a mentor in L. Sprague de Camp, who critiqued his novel &quot;The Wizard of Lemuria&quot; in manuscript. The seventh novel Carter wrote, it was the first to find a publisher, appearing from Ace Books in March 1965. Due in large part to their later collaborations, mutual promotion of each other in print, joint membership in both the Trap Door Spiders and SAGA, and complementary scholarly efforts to document the history of fantasy, de Camp is the person with whom Carter is most closely associated as a writer. A falling-out in the last decade of Carter&#x27;s life did not become generally known until after his death.

Carter was a prolific writer, producing an average of six books a year from 1965 to 1969. He also wrote a nearly monthly column, &quot;Our Man in Fandom&quot;, in &quot;If&quot;, edited by Frederik Pohl, and was a major writer on ABC&#x27;s original &quot;Spider-Man&quot; animated TV show during its fantasy-oriented second season in 1968–69.

Carter frequently cited his own writings in his non-fiction and almost always included at least one of his own pieces in each of the anthologies he edited. The most extreme instance of his penchant for self-promotion is in the sixth novel in his Callisto sequence, &quot;Lankar of Callisto&quot;, which features Carter himself as the protagonist.

Carter was not reluctant to attack organized religion in his books, notably in his unfinished epic &quot;World&#x27;s End&quot;, in &quot;Amalric the Man-God&quot; (also unfinished), and in &quot;The Wizard of Zao&quot;. He portrayed religions as cruel and repressive, and had his heroes escape from their inquisitions.

In most of his fiction, Carter was consciously imitative of the themes, subjects and styles of authors he admired. He usually identified his models in the introductions or afterwords of his novels, as well as in the introductory notes to self-anthologized or collected short stories. His best-known works are his sword and planet and sword and sorcery novels in the tradition of Edgar Rice Burroughs, Robert E. Howard, and James Branch Cabell. His first published book, &quot;The Wizard of Lemuria&quot; (1965), first of the &quot;Thongor the Barbarian&quot; series, combines both influences. Although he wrote only six Thongor novels, the character appeared in Marvel Comics&#x27;s &quot;Creatures on the Loose&quot; for an eight-issue run in 1973–74 and was often optioned for films, although none has been produced. His other major series, the &quot;Callisto&quot; and &quot;Zanthodon&quot; books, are direct tributes to Burroughs&#x27; Barsoom series and Pellucidar novels, respectively.

In other works Carter paid homage to the styles of contemporary pulp magazine authors or their precursors. Some of these, together with Carter&#x27;s models, include his &quot;Simrana&quot; stories (influenced by Lord Dunsany), his horror stories (set in the &quot;Cthulhu Mythos&quot; of H. P. Lovecraft), his &quot;Green Star&quot; novels (uniting influences from Clark Ashton Smith and Edgar Rice Burroughs), his &quot;Mysteries of Mars&quot; series (patterned on the works of Leigh Brackett), and his &quot;Prince Zarkon&quot; books (based on the &quot;Doc Savage&quot; series of Kenneth Robeson). Later in his career Carter assimilated influences from mythology and fairy tales, and even branched out briefly into pornographic fantasy.

==Posthumous collaborations with Howard and Smith==

Some of Carter&#x27;s most prominent works were what he referred to as &quot;posthumous collaborations&quot; with deceased authors, notably Robert E. Howard and Clark Ashton Smith. He completed a number of Howard&#x27;s unfinished tales of Kull (see Kull (collection) and Conan the Barbarian, the latter often in collaboration with L. Sprague de Camp. He also collaborated with de Camp on a number of pastiche novels and short stories featuring Conan.

The &quot;posthumous collaborations&quot; with Smith were of a different order, usually completely new stories built around title ideas or short fragments found among Smith&#x27;s notes and jottings. A number of these tales feature Smith&#x27;s invented book of forbidden lore, the Book of Eibon (Cthulhu Mythos arcane literature). Some of them also overlap as pastiches of H.P. Lovecraft&#x27;s work by utilising elements of Lovecraft&#x27;s Cthulhu Mythos. These stories are uncollected. For further information see Steve Behrends, &quot;The Carter-Smith Collaborations&quot; in Robert M. Price (ed). &quot;The Horror of it All: Encrusted Gems from the Crypt of Cthulhu&quot;. See also Lin Carter deities.

==Pastiches of H. P. Lovecraft and Lord Dunsany==

Carter wrote numerous stories in the Cthulhu Mythos of H. P. Lovecraft. Many have been collected in &quot;The Xothic Legend Cycle: The Complete Mythos Fiction of Lin Carter&quot;, edited by Robert M. Price. Despite the title, there are many uncollected Mythos stories by Carter. See also Xothic legend cycle. For further info see Robert M. Price &quot;The Statement of Lin Carter&quot;, &quot;Crypt of Cthulhu&quot; 1, No 2 (Yuletide 1981), 11–19.

Carter wrote two cycles of stories set in &quot;dreamlands&quot;, paying tribute to the fantasy of Lord Dunsany, Ikranos, from his fan days, and Simrana, after he became a professional writer.

Carter also wrote the introduction to the book, Over the Hills and Far Away.

==Unfinished projects==

Carter left a number of projects unfinished. He regularly announced plans for future works that never came to fruition, even including some among lists of other works printed in the fronts of his books. His 1976 anthologies &quot;Kingdoms of Sorcery&quot; and &quot;Realms of Wizardry&quot; both included such phantom books among his other listed works, titled &quot;Robert E. Howard and the Rise of Sword &amp; Sorcery&quot;, &quot;The Stones of Mnar&quot; and &quot;Jungle Maid of Callisto&quot;. The first of these, presumably a non-fiction study along the lines of his &quot;&quot; (1969), never saw print; the second seems to be related to &quot;The Terror Out of Time&quot;, a collection of Cthulhu Mythos tales he had pitched unsuccessfully to Arkham House (the existing material for which was eventually gathered into his &quot;The Xothic Legend Cycle&quot; (1997)); the third was apparently a working title for &quot;Ylana of Callisto&quot; (1977), published the year after the anthologies.

Several of his series were abandoned due to lack of publisher or reader interest or to his deteriorating health. Among these are his &quot;Thongor&quot; series, to which he intended to add two books dealing with the hero&#x27;s youth; only a scattering of short stories intended for the volumes appeared. His &quot;Gondwane&quot; epic, which he began with the final book and afterwards added several more covering the beginning of the saga, lacks its middle volumes, his publisher having canceled the series before he managed to fill the gap between. Similarly, his projected Atlantis trilogy was canceled after the first book (&quot;The Black Star&quot;), and his five-volume &quot;Chronicles of Kylix&quot; ended with three volumes published and parts of another (&quot;Amalric&quot;).

Another unfinished project was Carter&#x27;s self-proclaimed &quot;magnum opus&quot;, an epic literary fantasy entitled &quot;Khymyrium&quot;, or, to give it its full title, &quot;Khymyrium: The City of the Hundred Kings, from the Coming of Aviathar the Lion to the Passing of Spheridion the Doomed&quot;. It was intended to take the genre in a new direction by resurrecting the fantastic medieval chronicle history of the sort exemplified by Geoffrey of Monmouth&#x27;s &quot;Historia Regum Britanniae&quot; and Saxo Grammaticus&#x27;s &quot;Gesta Danorum&quot;. It was also to present a new invented system of magic called &quot;Enstarrment&quot;, which from Carter&#x27;s description somewhat resembles the system of magical luck investment later devised by Emma Bull and Will Shetterly for their &quot;Liavek&quot; series of shared world anthologies. Carter claimed to have begun the work about 1959, and published three excerpts from it as separate short stories during his lifetime – &quot;Azlon&quot; in &quot;The Young Magicians&quot; (1969), &quot;The Mantichore&quot; in &quot;Beyond the Gates of Dream&quot; (also 1969) and &quot;The Sword of Power&quot; in &quot;New Worlds for Old&quot; (1971). A fourth episode was published posthumously in &quot;Fungi&quot; #17, a 1998 fanzine. His most comprehensive account of the project appeared in &quot;Imaginary Worlds: the Art of Fantasy&quot; in 1973. While he continued to make claims for its excellence throughout his lifetime, the complete novel never appeared. Part of the problem was that Carter was forcing himself to write the novel in a formal style more like that of William Morris and quite unlike his own.

Carter also spoke about publishing a magazine titled &quot;Yoh-Vombis,&quot; which he intended to consist of stories he would have published in his paperback &quot;Weird Tales&quot; series had he been permitted to continue editing it. As well as new fantastic stories, he intended to publish stories and verse by Robert E. Howard and Clark Ashton Smith; unpublished letters from Smith, H. P. Lovecraft; and art by Smith, Roy Krenkel, Mahlon Blaine, etc. However, this mooted magazine never eventuated.

==Career as editor and critic==
Carter was influential as a critic of contemporary fantasy and a pioneering historian of the genre. His book reviews and surveys of the year&#x27;s best fantasy fiction appeared regularly in &quot;Castle of Frankenstein&quot;, continuing after that magazine&#x27;s 1975 demise in &quot;The Year&#x27;s Best Fantasy Stories&quot;. His early studies of the works of J. R. R. Tolkien (&quot;&quot;) and H. P. Lovecraft (&quot;&quot;) were followed up by the wide-ranging &quot;Imaginary Worlds: the Art of Fantasy&quot;, a study tracing the emergence and development of modern fantasy from the late nineteenth century novels of William Morris through the 1970s. 
Peter Beagle faulted Carter&#x27;s scholarship, saying &quot;He gets so many facts embarrassingly wrong, so many attributions misquoted, that the entire commentary is essentially worthless.&quot;

His greatest influence in the field may have been as an editor for Ballantine Books from 1969 to 1974, when Carter brought several then obscure yet important books of fantasy back into print under the &quot;Adult Fantasy&quot; line. Authors whose works he revived included Dunsany, Morris, Smith, James Branch Cabell, Hope Mirrlees, and Evangeline Walton. David G. Hartwell praised the series, saying it brought &quot;into mass editions nearly all the adult fantasy stories and novels worth reading.&quot; He also helped new authors break into the field, such as Katherine Kurtz, Joy Chant, and Sanders Anne Laubenthal.

Carter was a fantasy anthologist of note, editing a number of new anthologies of classic and contemporary fantasy for Ballantine and other publishers. He also edited several anthology series, including the &quot;Flashing Swords!&quot; series from 1973 to 1981, the first six volumes of &quot;The Year&#x27;s Best Fantasy Stories&quot; for DAW Books from 1975 to 1980, and an anthology format revival of the classic fantasy magazine &quot;Weird Tales&quot; from 1981 to 1983.

Together with SAGA he sponsored the Gandalf Award, an early fantasy equivalent to science fiction&#x27;s Hugo Award, for the recognition of outstanding merit in authors and works of fantasy. It was given annually by the World Science Fiction Society from 1974 to 1981, but went into abeyance with the collapse of Carter&#x27;s health in the 1980s. Its primary purpose continues to be fulfilled by the initially rival World Fantasy Awards, first presented in 1975.

==Posthumous revival==
Wildside Press began an extensive program returning much of Carter&#x27;s fiction to print in 1999. All remain in print, and one original book was issued in 2012, collecting the short stories about Thongor. See the bibliography for Wildside reissues.
