<text>[[Jerusalem]] is one of the world&#x27;s oldest cities, with a history spanning over 5,000 years. Its origins trace back to around 3000 BCE, with the first settlement near the Gihon Spring. The city is first mentioned in Egyptian execration texts around 2000 BCE as &quot;Rusalimum.&quot; By the 17th century BCE, Jerusalem had developed into a fortified city under Canaanite rule, with massive walls protecting its water system. During the Late Bronze Age, Jerusalem became a vassal of Ancient Egypt, as documented in the Amarna letters.

The city&#x27;s importance grew during the Israelite period, which began around 1000 BCE when King David captured Jerusalem and made it the capital of the united Kingdom of Israel. David&#x27;s son, Solomon, built the First Temple, establishing the city as a major religious center. Following the kingdom&#x27;s split, Jerusalem became the capital of the Kingdom of Judah until it was captured by the Neo-Babylonian Empire in 586 BCE. The Babylonians destroyed the First Temple, leading to the Babylonian exile of the Jewish population. After the Persian conquest of Babylon in 539 BCE, Cyrus the Great allowed the Jews to return and rebuild the city and its temple, marking the start of the Second Temple period. Jerusalem fell under Hellenistic rule after the conquests of Alexander the Great in 332 BCE, leading to increasing cultural and political influence from Greece. The Hasmonean revolt in 1the 2nd century BCE briefly restored Jewish autonomy, with Jerusalem as the capital of an independent state.

In 63 BCE, Jerusalem was conquered by Pompey and became part of the Roman Empire. The city remained under Roman control until the Jewish–Roman wars, which culminated in the destruction of the Second Temple in 70 CE. The city was renamed &quot;Aelia Capitolina&quot; and rebuilt as a Roman colony after the Bar Kokhba revolt (132–136 CE), with Jews banned from entering the city. Jerusalem gained significance during the Byzantine Empire as a center of Christianity, particularly after Constantine the Great endorsed the construction of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. In 638 CE, Jerusalem was conquered by the Rashidun Caliphate, and under early Islamic rule, the Dome of the Rock and Al-Aqsa Mosque were built, solidifying its religious importance in Islam. During the Crusades, Jerusalem changed hands multiple times, being captured by the Crusaders in 1099 and recaptured by Saladin in 1187. It remained under Islamic control through the Ayyubid and Mamluk periods, until it became part of the Ottoman Empire in 1517.

In the modern period, Jerusalem was divided between Israel and Jordan after the 1948 Arab–Israeli War. Israel captured East Jerusalem during the Six-Day War in 1967, uniting the city under Israeli control. The status of Jerusalem remains a highly contentious issue, with both Israelis and Palestinians claiming it as their capital. Historiographically, the city&#x27;s history is often interpreted through the lens of competing national narratives. Israeli scholars emphasize the ancient Jewish connection to the city, while Palestinian narratives highlight the city&#x27;s broader historical and multicultural significance. Both perspectives influence contemporary discussions of Jerusalem&#x27;s status and future.

==Bronze Age==
===Early Bronze===
Archaeological evidence suggests that the first settlement was established near Gihon Spring between 3000 and 2800 BCE.

===Middle Bronze===
The first known mention of the city was in c. 2000 BCE in the Middle Kingdom Egyptian execration texts in which the city was recorded as &quot;Rusalimum&quot;. The root S-L-M in the name is thought to refer to either &quot;peace&quot; (compare with modern Salam or Shalom in modern Arabic and Hebrew) or Shalim, the god of dusk in the Canaanite religion.

Archaeological evidence suggests that by the 17th century BCE, the Canaanites had built massive walls (4 and 5 ton boulders, 26 feet high) on the eastern side of Jerusalem to protect their ancient water system.

===Late Bronze===
====Egyptian period====
18th Dynasty. By c. 1550–1400 BCE, Jerusalem had become a vassal to Egypt after the Egyptian New Kingdom under Ahmose I and Thutmose I had reunited Egypt and expanded into the Levant. 
In the Amarna Period (c. 1350 BC), &quot;Urusalim&quot; was one of several small city-states competing and being vassals of the King of Egypt. It was an important stop for caravans with its fresh water spring. Several Amarna letters mentions the city and its rulers, competing with neighboring rulers for more domain. Among the people in the region causing problems are the Habiru (Hebrews), which would become one of several groups of people making up the &quot;Israelites&quot;.

*Abdi-Heba. This ruler is mentioned in Amarna Letters EA 280, EA 366, EA 285, EA 286, EA 287, EA 288, EA 289, EA 290.
*Amarna Letters from Gath concerning Jerusalem and its ruler: EA 280, EA 335, EA 366.
*Amarna Letters from Jerusalem and its ruler: EA 285, EA 286, EA 287, EA 288, EA 289, EA 290.

19th Dynasty. In the Late Bronze IIB, the 19th dynasty of Egypt came to power with border conflict against the Hittites who occupied Syria. In Year 4 of Ramesses II he occupied Amurru while in Year 5 of Ramesses II was the famous Battle of Kadesh. This event significantly weakned both the Hittites and Egyptians militarily, in addition to gradually drier climate conditions.

20th Dynasty. With the end of the 19th dynasty, a transitional phase started. The 20th dynasty came to power after a period of political turmoil and rebellion. Ramesses III fought the Sea Peoples and is regarded the last great king. The Battle of Djahy (Djahy being the Egyptian name for Canaan) in 1178 BCE. The power of the Egyptians in the region began to decline in the 12th century BCE, during the Late Bronze Age collapse. According to the Bible, Jerusalem at this time was known as Jebus, and its independent Canaanite inhabitants at this time were known as Jebusites.

==Iron Age==
===Kingdom of Judah===

According to the Bible, the Israelite history of the city began in c. 1000 BCE, with King David&#x27;s sack of Jerusalem, following which Jerusalem became the City of David and capital of the united Kingdom of Israel. According to the Books of Samuel, the Jebusites managed to resist attempts by the Israelites to capture the city and by the time of King David were mocking such attempts, claiming that even the blind and lame could defeat the Israelite army. Nevertheless, the masoretic text for the Books of Samuel states that David managed to capture the city by stealth, sending his forces through a &quot;water shaft&quot; and attacking the city from the inside. Archaeologists now view this as implausible as the Gihon spring – the only known location from which water shafts lead into the city – is now known to have been heavily defended (and hence an attack via this route would have been obvious rather than secretive). The older Septuagint text, however, suggests that rather than by a water shaft, David&#x27;s forces defeated the Jebusites by using daggers. There was another king in Jerusalem, Araunah, during and possibly before David&#x27;s control of the city, who was probably the Jebusite king of Jerusalem. The city, which at that point stood upon the Ophel, was expanded to the south and declared by David to be the capital city of the Kingdom of Israel. David also constructed an altar at the location of a threshing floor he had purchased from Araunah; a portion of biblical scholars view this as an attempt by the narrative&#x27;s author to give an Israelite foundation to a pre-existing sanctuary.

Later, King Solomon built a more substantive temple, the Temple of Solomon, at a location which the Books of Chronicles equates with David&#x27;s altar. The temple became a major cultural centre in the region; eventually, particularly after religious reforms such as those of Hezekiah and of Josiah, the temple became the main place of worship, at the expense of other, formerly powerful, ritual centres such as Shiloh and Bethel. Solomon is also described as having created several other important building works at Jerusalem, including the construction of his palace, and the construction of the Millo (the identity of which is somewhat controversial). Archaeologists are divided over whether the biblical narrative is supported by the evidence from excavations. Eilat Mazar contends that her digging uncovered remains of large stone buildings from the correct time period, while Israel Finkelstein disputes both the interpretation and the dating of the finds.

When the Kingdom of Judah split from the larger Kingdom of Israel (which the Bible places near the end of the reign of Solomon, c. 930 BCE, though Finkelstein and others dispute the very existence of a unified monarchy to begin with), Jerusalem became the capital of the Kingdom of Judah, while the Kingdom of Israel located its capital at Shechem in Samaria. Thomas L. Thompson argues that it only became a city and capable of acting as a state capital in the middle of the 7th century BCE. However, Omer Sergi argues that recent archaeological discoveries at the City of David and the Ophel seem to indicate that Jerusalem was already a significant city by the Iron Age IIA.

Precise absolute dates recently obtained from organic material show that Jerusalem was relatively densely inhabited during the 12th to 10th centuries BCE, and date the start of a major westward expansion of the city already to the 9th century BCE.

Both the Bible and regional archaeological evidence suggest the region was politically unstable during the period 925–732 BCE. In 925 BCE, the region was invaded by Egyptian Pharaoh Sheshonk I of the Third Intermediate Period, who is possibly the same as Shishak, the first Pharaoh mentioned in the Bible who captured and pillaged Jerusalem. Around 75 years later, Jerusalem&#x27;s forces were likely involved in an indecisive battle against the Neo-Assyrian King Shalmaneser III in the Battle of Qarqar. According to the Bible, Jehoshaphat of Judah was allied to Ahab of the Kingdom of Israel at this time. The Bible records that shortly after this battle, Jerusalem was sacked by Philistines, Arabs and Ethiopians, who looted King Jehoram&#x27;s house and carried off all of his family except for his youngest son Jehoahaz.

Two decades later, most of Canaan including Jerusalem was conquered by Hazael of Aram-Damascus. According to the Bible, Jehoash of Judah gave all of Jerusalem&#x27;s treasures as a tribute, but Hazael proceeded to destroy &quot;all the princes of the people&quot; in the city. And half a century later, the city was sacked by Jehoash of Israel, who destroyed the walls and took Amaziah of Judah prisoner.

By the end of the First Temple Period, Jerusalem was the sole acting religious shrine in the kingdom and a centre of regular pilgrimage; a fact which archaeologists generally view as being corroborated by the evidence, though there remained a more personal cult involving Asherah figures, which are found spread throughout the land right up to the end of this era.

===Assyrian period===

Jerusalem was the capital of the Kingdom of Judah for some 400 years. It had survived an Assyrian siege in 701 BCE by Sennacherib, unlike Samaria, which had fallen some 20 years previously. According to the Bible, this was a miraculous event in which an angel killed 185,000 men in Sennacherib&#x27;s army. According to Sennacherib&#x27;s own account preserved in the Taylor prism, an inscription contemporary with the event, the king of Judah, Hezekiah, was &quot;shut up in the city like a caged bird&quot; and eventually persuaded Sennacherib to leave by sending him &quot;30 talents of gold and 800 talents of silver, and diverse treasures, a rich and immense booty&quot;.

===Babylonian period===

The siege of Jerusalem in 597 BCE led to the city being overcome by the Babylonians, who then took the young King Jehoiachin into Babylonian captivity, together with most of the aristocracy. Zedekiah, who had been placed on the throne by Nebuchadnezzar (the Babylonian king), rebelled, and Nebuchadnezzar recaptured the city, killed Zedekiah&#x27;s descendants in front of him, and plucked out Zedekiah&#x27;s eyes so that that would be the last thing he ever saw. The Babylonians then took Zedekiah into captivity, along with prominent members of Judah. The Babylonians then burnt the temple, destroyed the city&#x27;s walls, and appointed Gedaliah son of Achikam as governor of Judah. After 52 days of rule, Yishmael, son of Netaniah, a surviving descendant of Zedekiah, assassinated Gedaliah after encouragement by Baalis, the king of Ammon. Some of the remaining population of Judah, fearing the vengeance of Nebuchadnezzar, fled to Egypt.

===Persian (Achaemenid) period===
According to the Bible and perhaps corroborated by the Cyrus Cylinder, after several decades of captivity in Babylon and the Achaemenid conquest of Babylonia, Cyrus II of Persia allowed the Jews to return to Judah and rebuild the temple. The books of Ezra–Nehemiah record that the construction of the Second Temple was finished in the sixth year of Darius the Great (516 BCE), following which Artaxerxes I sent Ezra and then Nehemiah to rebuild the city&#x27;s walls and to govern the Yehud province within the Eber-Nari satrapy. These events represent the final chapter in the historical narrative of the Hebrew Bible.

During this period, Aramaic-inscribed &quot;Yehud coinage&quot; were produced – these are believed to have been minted in or near Jerusalem, although none of the coins bear a mint mark.

==Classical antiquity==
===Hellenistic period===
====Ptolemaic and Seleucid province====
When Alexander the Great conquered the Persian Empire, Jerusalem and Judea fell under Greek control and Hellenistic influence. After the Wars of the Diadochoi following Alexander&#x27;s death, Jerusalem and Judea fell under Ptolemaic control under Ptolemy I and continued minting Yehud coinage. In 198 BCE, as a result of the Battle of Panium, Ptolemy V lost Jerusalem and Judea to the Seleucids under Antiochus the Great.

Under the Seleucids many Jews had become Hellenized and with their assistance tried to Hellenize Jerusalem, eventually culminating in the 160s BCE in a rebellion led by Mattathias and his five sons: Simon, Yochanan, Eleazar, Jonathan and Judas Maccabeus, also known as the Maccabees. After Mattathias died, Judas Maccabee took over as the revolt&#x27;s leader, and in 164 BCE, he captured Jerusalem and restored temple worship, an event celebrated to this day in the Jewish festival of Hanukkah.

====Hasmonean period====
As a result of the Maccabean Revolt, Jerusalem became the capital of the autonomous and eventually independent Hasmonean state which lasted for over a century. After Judas&#x27; death, his brothers Jonathan Apphus and Simon Thassi were successful in creating and consolidating the state. They were succeeded by John Hyrcanus, Simon&#x27;s son, who won independence, enlarged Judea&#x27;s borders, and began minting coins. Hasmonean Judea became a kingdom and continued to expand under his sons kings Aristobulus I and subsequently Alexander Jannaeus. When his widow Salome Alexandra died in 67 BCE her sons Hyrcanus II and Aristobulus II fought among themselves over who would succeed her. In order to resolve their dispute, the parties involved turned to Roman general Pompey, who paved the way for a Roman takeover of Judea.

Pompey supported Hyrcanus II over his brother Aristobulus II who then controlled Jerusalem, and the city was soon under siege. Upon his victory, Pompey desecrated the Temple by entering the Holy of Holies, which could only be done by the High Priest. Hyrcanus II was restored as High Priest, stripped of his royal title but recognized as an ethnarch in 47 BCE. Judea remained an autonomous province but still with a significant amount of independence. The last Hasmonean king was Aristobulus&#x27; son, Antigonus II Matityahu.

===Early Roman period===
In 37 BCE, Herod the Great captured Jerusalem after a forty-day siege, ending Hasmonean rule. Herod ruled the Province of Judea as a client-king of the Romans, rebuilt the Second Temple, more than doubled the size of the surrounding complex, and expanded the minting of coins to many denominations. The Temple Mount became the largest temenos (religious sanctuary) in the ancient world. Pliny the Elder, writing of Herod&#x27;s achievements, called Jerusalem &quot;the most famous by far of the Eastern cities and not only the cities of Judea.&quot; The Talmud comments that &quot;He who has not seen the Temple of Herod has never seen a beautiful building in his life.&quot; And Tacitus wrote that &quot;Jerusalem is the capital of the Jews. In it was a Temple possessing enormous riches.&quot;

Herod also built Caesarea Maritima which replaced Jerusalem as the capital of the Roman province. In 6 CE, following Herod&#x27;s death in 4 BCE, Judea and the city of Jerusalem came under direct Roman rule through Roman prefects, procurators, and legates (see List of Hasmonean and Herodian rulers). However, one of Herod&#x27;s descendants was the last one to return to power as nominal king of Iudaea Province: Agrippa I (r. 41–44).

In the 1st century CE, Jerusalem became the birthplace of Early Christianity. According to the New Testament, it is the location of the crucifixion, resurrection and Ascension of Jesus Christ (see also Jerusalem in Christianity). It was in Jerusalem that, according to the Acts of the Apostles, the Apostles of Christ received the Holy Spirit at Pentecost and first began preaching the Gospel and proclaiming his resurrection. Jerusalem eventually became an early center of Christianity and home to one of the five Patriarchates of the Christian Church. After the Great Schism, it remained a part of the Eastern Orthodox Church.

By the end of the Second Temple period, Jerusalem&#x27;s size and population had reached a peak that would not be broken until the 20th century. There were about 70,000 to 100,000 people living in the city at that time, according to modern estimations.

=== Jewish–Roman Wars ===
In 66 CE, the Jewish population in the Roman province of Judaea rebelled against the Roman Empire in what is now known as the First Jewish–Roman War or &quot;Great Revolt&quot;. Jerusalem was then the center of Jewish rebel resistance. Following a brutal five-month siege, Roman legions under future emperor Titus reconquered and subsequently destroyed much of Jerusalem in 70 CE. Also the Second Temple was burnt and all that remained was the great external (retaining) walls supporting the esplanade on which the Temple had stood, a portion of which has become known as the Western Wall. Titus&#x27; victory is commemorated by the Arch of Titus in Rome. This victory gave the Flavian dynasty legitimacy to claim control over the empire. A triumph was held in Rome to celebrate the fall of Jerusalem, and two triumphal arches, including the well known Arch of Titus, were built to commemorate it. The treasures looted from the Temple were put on display.

Jerusalem was later re-founded and rebuilt as the Roman colony of Aelia Capitolina. Foreign cults were introduced and Jews were forbidden entry. The construction of Aelia Capitolina is considered one of the proximate reasons for the eruption of the Bar Kokhba revolt in 132 CE. Early victories allowed the Jews under the leadership of Simon bar Kokhba to establish an independent state over much of Judea for three years, but it&#x27;s uncertain if they would also assert their control over Jerusalem. Archaeological research found no evidence for Bar Kokhba ever managing to hold the city. Hadrian responded with overwhelming force, putting down the rebellion, killing as many as a half million Jews, and resettling the city as a Roman &quot;colonia&quot;. Jews were expelled from the area of Jerusalem, and were forbidden to enter the city on the pain of death, except on the day of Tisha B&#x27;Av (the Ninth of Av), the fast day on which Jews mourn the destruction of both Temples.

== Late antiquity ==
===Late Roman period===
Aelia Capitolina of the Late Roman period was a Roman colony, with all the typical institutions and symbols - a forum, and temples to the Roman gods. Hadrian placed the city&#x27;s main forum at the junction of the main Cardo and Decumanus, now the location of the (smaller) Muristan. He also built a large temple to Jupiter Capitolinus, which later became the site of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. The city had no walls, was protected by a light garrison of the Tenth Legion. For the next two centuries, the city remained a relatively unimportant pagan Roman town.

A Roman legionary tomb at Manahat, the remains of Roman villas at Ein Yael and Ramat Rachel, and the Tenth Legion&#x27;s kilns found close to Giv&#x27;at Ram, all within the borders of modern-day Jerusalem, are all signs that the rural area surrounding Aelia Capitolina underwent a romanization process, with Roman citizens and Roman veterans settling in the area during the Late Roman period. Jews were still banned from the city throughout the remainder of its time as a Roman province.

===Byzantine period===

Following the Christianization of the Roman Empire, Jerusalem prospered as a hub of Christian worship. After allegedly seeing a vision of a cross in the sky in 312, Constantine the Great began to favor Christianity, signed the Edict of Milan legalizing the religion, and sent his mother, Helena, to Jerusalem to search for the tomb of Jesus. Helena traveled to Jerusalem on a pilgrimage, where she recognized the site where Jesus was crucified, buried, and raised from the dead. On the spot, the Church of the Holy Sepulchre was constructed and dedicated in 335 CE. Helena also claimed to have found the True Cross. Burial remains from the Byzantine period are exclusively Christian, suggesting that the population of Jerusalem in Byzantine times probably consisted only of Christians.In the 5th century, the eastern continuation of the Roman Empire, ruled from the recently renamed Constantinople, maintained control of the city. Within the span of a few decades, Jerusalem shifted from Byzantine to Persian rule, then back to Roman-Byzantine dominion. Following Sassanid Khosrau II&#x27;s early 7th century push through Syria, his generals Shahrbaraz and Shahin attacked Jerusalem aided by the Jews of Palaestina Prima, who had risen up against the Byzantines.
In the Siege of Jerusalem of 614, after 21 days of relentless siege warfare, Jerusalem was captured. Byzantine chronicles relate that the Sassanids and Jews slaughtered tens of thousands of Christians in the city, many at the Mamilla Pool, and destroyed their monuments and churches, including the Church of the Holy Sepulchre. This episode has been the subject of much debate between historians. The conquered city would remain in Sassanid hands for some fifteen years until the Byzantine emperor Heraclius reconquered it in 629.

==Medieval period==
===Early Muslim period===
====Rashidun, Umayyad and Abbasid Caliphates====

Jerusalem was one of the Arab Caliphate&#x27;s first conquests in 638 CE; according to Arab historians of the time, the Rashidun Caliph Umar ibn al-Khattab personally went to the city to receive its submission, cleaning out and praying at the Temple Mount in the process. Umar ibn al-Khattab allowed the Jews back into the city and freedom to live and worship after almost three centuries of banishment by the Romans and Byzantines.

Under the early centuries of Muslim rule, especially during the Umayyad (650–750) dynasty, the city prospered. Around 691–692 CE, the Dome of the Rock was built on the Temple Mount. Rather than a mosque, it is a shrine that enshrines the Foundation Stone. The Al-Aqsa Mosque was also built under Umayyad rule during the late 7th or early 8th century on the southern end of the compound, and was associated with a place of the same name mentioned in the Quran as a place visited by Muhammad during his Night Journey. Jerusalem is not mentioned by any of its names in the Quran, and the Qur&#x27;an does not mention the exact location of Al-Aqsa Mosque. Some scholars contend that the connection between the Al-Aqsa Mosque referenced in the Quran and the Temple Mount in Jerusalem is the result of an Umayyad political agenda that aimed to rival the prestige of the Mecca sanctuary, which was then ruled by their enemy, Abd Allah ibn al-Zubayr.

The Abbasid period (750–969) is the least documented of the early Muslim period in general. The Temple Mount area was the center of known building activity, with structures damaged in earthquakes being repaired.

Geographers Ibn Hawqal and al-Istakhri (10th century) describe Jerusalem as &quot;the most fertile province of Palestine&quot;, while its native son, the geographer al-Muqaddasi (born 946) devoted many pages to its praises in his most famous work, &quot;The Best Divisions in the Knowledge of the Climes&quot;. Under Muslim rule Jerusalem did not achieve the political or cultural status enjoyed by the capitals Damascus, Baghdad, Cairo etc. Al-Muqaddasi derives his name from the Arabic name for Jerusalem, &quot;Bayt al-Muqaddas&quot;, which is linguistically equivalent to the Hebrew &quot;Beit Ha-Mikdash&quot;, the Holy House.

====Fatimid period====
The early Arab period was also one of religious tolerance. However, in the early 11th century, the Egyptian Fatimid Caliph Al-Hakim bi-Amr Allah ordered the destruction of all churches. In 1033, there was another earthquake, severely damaging the Al-Aqsa Mosque. The Fatimid caliph Ali az-Zahir rebuilt and completely renovated the mosque between 1034 and 1036. The number of naves was drastically reduced from fifteen to seven. Az-Zahir built the four arcades of the central hall and aisle, which presently serve as the foundation of the mosque. The central aisle was double the width of the other aisles and had a large gable roof upon which the dome—made of wood—was constructed. Persian geographer, Nasir Khusraw describes the Aqsa Mosque during a visit in 1047:

The Haram Area (Noble Sanctuary) lies in the eastern part of the city; and through the bazaar of this (quarter) you enter the Area by a great and beautiful gateway (Dargah). ... After passing this gateway, you have on the right two great colonnades (Riwaq), each of which has nine-and-twenty marble pillars, whose capitals and bases are of colored marbles, and the joints are set in lead. Above the pillars rise arches, that are constructed, of masonry, without mortar or cement, and each arch is constructed of no more than five or six blocks of stone. These colonnades lead down to near the Maqsurah.

====Seljuk period====
Under Az-Zahir&#x27;s successor al-Mustansir Billah, the Fatimid Caliphate entered a period of instability and decline, as factions fought for power in Cairo. In 1071, Jerusalem was captured by the Turkish warlord Atsiz ibn Uvaq, who seized most of Syria and Palestine as part of the expansion of the Seljuk Turks throughout the Middle East. As the Turks were staunch Sunnis, they were opposed not only to the Fatimids, but also to the numerous Shia Muslims, who saw themselves removed from dominance after a century of Fatimid rule. In 1176, riots between Sunnis and Shiites in Jerusalem led to a massacre of the latter. Although the Christians of the city were left unmolested, and allowed access to the Christian holy sites, the wars with Byzantium and the general instability in Syria impeded the arrival pilgrims from Europe. The Seljuks also forbade the repair of any church, despite the damages suffered in the recent turmoils. There does not appear to have been a significant Jewish community in the city at this time.

In 1086, the Seljuk emir of Damascus, Tutush I, appointed Artuk Bey governor of Jerusalem. Artuk died in 1091, and his sons Sökmen and Ilghazi succeeded him. In August 1098, while the Seljuks were distracted by the arrival of the First Crusade in Syria, the Fatimids under vizier al-Afdal Shahanshah appeared before the city and laid siege to it. After six weeks, the Seljuk garrison capitulated and was allowed to leave for Damascus and Diyar Bakr. The Fatimid takeover was followed by the expulsion of most of the Sunnis, in which many of them were also killed.

===Crusader/Ayyubid period===

The time span consisting of the 12th and 13th centuries is sometimes referred to as the medieval period, or the Middle Ages, in the history of Jerusalem.

====First Crusader kingdom (1099–1187)====

Fatimid control of Jerusalem ended when it was captured by Crusaders in July 1099. The capture was accompanied by a massacre of almost all of the Muslim and Jewish inhabitants. Jerusalem became the capital of the Kingdom of Jerusalem. Godfrey of Bouillon, was elected Lord of Jerusalem on 22 July 1099, but did not assume the royal crown and died a year later. Barons offered the lordship of Jerusalem to Godfrey&#x27;s brother Baldwin, Count of Edessa, who had himself crowned by the Patriarch Daimbert on Christmas Day 1100 in the basilica of Bethlehem.

Christian settlers from the West set about rebuilding the principal shrines associated with the life of Christ. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was ambitiously rebuilt as a great Romanesque church, and Muslim shrines on the Temple Mount (the Dome of the Rock and the Jami Al-Aqsa) were converted for Christian purposes. It is during this period of Frankish occupation that the Military Orders of the Knights Hospitaller and the Knights Templar have their beginnings. Both grew out of the need to protect and care for the great influx of pilgrims travelling to Jerusalem in the 12th century.

====Ayyubid control====
The Kingdom of Jerusalem lasted until 1291; however, Jerusalem itself was recaptured by Saladin in 1187 (see Siege of Jerusalem (1187)), who permitted worship of all religions. According to Rabbi Elijah of Chelm, German Jews lived in Jerusalem during the 11th century. The story is told that a German-speaking Jew saved the life of a young German man surnamed Dolberger. Thus when the knights of the First Crusade came to besiege Jerusalem, one of Dolberger&#x27;s family members rescued Jews in Palestine and carried them back to the German city of Worms to repay the favor. Further evidence of German communities in the holy city comes in the form of halakic questions sent from Germany to Jerusalem during the second half of the 11th century.

In 1173 Benjamin of Tudela visited Jerusalem. He described it as a small city full of Jacobites, Armenians, Greeks, and Georgians. Two hundred Jews dwelt in a corner of the city under the Tower of David. In 1219 the walls of the city were razed by order of al-Mu&#x27;azzam, the Ayyubid sultan of Damascus. This rendered Jerusalem defenseless and dealt a heavy blow to the city&#x27;s status. The Ayyubids destroyed the walls in expectation of ceding the city to the Crusaders as part of a peace treaty. In 1229, by treaty with Egypt&#x27;s ruler al-Kamil, Jerusalem came into the hands of Frederick II of Germany. In 1239, after a ten-year truce expired, he began to rebuild the walls; these were again demolished by an-Nasir Da&#x27;ud, the emir of Kerak, in the same year.

In 1243 Jerusalem came again into the power of the Christians, and the walls were repaired. The Khwarezmian Empire took the city in 1244 and were in turn driven out by the Ayyubids in 1247. In 1260 the Mongols under Hulagu Khan engaged in raids into Palestine. It is unclear if the Mongols were ever in Jerusalem, as it was not seen as a settlement of strategic importance at the time. However, there are reports that some of the Jews that were in Jerusalem temporarily fled to neighboring villages.

===Mamluk period===
In 1250 a crisis within the Ayyubid state led to the rise of the Mamluks to power and a transition to the Mamluk Sultanate, which is divided between the Bahri and Burji periods. The Ayyubids tried to hold on to power in Syria, but the Mongol invasion of 1260 put an end to this. A Mamluk army defeated the Mongol incursion and in the aftermath Baybars, the true founder of the Mamluk state, emerged as ruler of Egypt, the Levant, and the Hijaz. The Mamluks ruled over Palestine including Jerusalem from 1260 until 1516. In the decades after 1260 they also worked to eliminate the remaining Crusader states in the region. The last of these was defeated with the capture of Acre in 1291.

Jerusalem was a significant site of Mamluk architectural patronage. The frequent building activity in the city during this period is evidenced by the 90 remaining structures that date from the 13th to 15th centuries. The types of structures built included madrasas, libraries, hospitals, caravanserais, fountains (or sabils), and public baths. Much of the building activity was concentrated around the edges of the Temple Mount or Haram al-Sharif. Old gates to the site lost importance and new gates were built, while significant parts of the northern and western porticos along the edge of the Temple Mount plaza were built or rebuilt in this period. Tankiz, the Mamluk amir in charge of Syria during the reign of al-Nasir Muhammad, built a new market called &quot;Suq al-Qattatin&quot; (Cotton Market) in 1336–7, along with the gate known as &quot;Bab al-Qattanin&quot; (Cotton Gate), which gave access to the Temple Mount from this market. The late Mamluk sultan al-Ashraf Qaytbay also took interest in the city. He commissioned the building of the Madrasa al-Ashrafiyya, completed in 1482, and the nearby Sabil of Qaytbay, built shortly after in 1482; both were located on the Temple Mount. Qaytbay&#x27;s monuments were the last major Mamluk constructions in the city.

====Jewish presence====
Rabbinical Jewish tradition, based on a source of doubtful authenticity, holds that in 1267, the Jewish Catalan sage Nahmanides travelled to Jerusalem, where he established the synagogue much later named after him, today the second oldest active synagogue in Jerusalem, after that of the Karaite Jews built about 300 years earlier. Scholars date the Ramban Synagogue to the 13th century or later.

====Latin presence====

The first provincial or superior of the Franciscan religious order, founded by Francis of Assisi, was Brother Elia from Assisi. In the year 1219 the founder himself visited the region in order to preach the Gospel to the Muslims, seen as brothers and not enemies. The mission resulted in a meeting with the sultan of Egypt, Malik al-Kamil, who was surprised by his unusual behaviour. The Franciscan Province of the East extended to Cyprus, Syria, Lebanon, and the Holy Land. Before the taking over of Acre (on 18 May 1291), Franciscan friaries were present at Acre, Sidon, Antioch, Tripoli, Jaffa, and Jerusalem.

From Cyprus, where they took refuge at the end of the Latin Kingdom, the Franciscans started planning a return to Jerusalem, given the good political relations between the Christian governments and the Mamluk Sultanate of Egypt. Around the year 1333 the French friar Roger Guerin succeeded in buying the Cenacle (the room where the Last Supper took place) on Mount Zion and some land to build a monastery nearby for the friars, using funds provided by the king and queen of Naples. With two papal bullae, Gratias Agimus and Nuper Carissimae, dated in Avignon, 21 November 1342, Pope Clement VI approved and created the new entity which would be known as the Franciscan Custody of the Holy Land (Custodia Terrae Sanctae).

The friars, coming from any of the Order&#x27;s provinces, under the jurisdiction of the father guardian (superior) of the monastery on Mount Zion, were present in Jerusalem, in the Cenacle, in the church of the Holy Sepulcher, and in the Basilica of the Nativity at Bethlehem. Their principal activity was to ensure liturgical life in these Christian sanctuaries and to give spiritual assistance to the pilgrims coming from the West, to European merchants resident or passing through the main cities of Egypt, Syria, and Lebanon, and to have a direct and authorized relation with the Eastern Christianity Oriental communities.

The monastery on Mount Zion was used by Brother Alberto da Sarteano for his papal mission for the union of the Oriental Christians (Greeks, Copts, and Ethiopians) with Rome during the Council of Florence (1440). For the same reason the party guided by Brother Giovanni di Calabria halted in Jerusalem on his way to meet the Christian Negus of Ethiopia (1482).

In 1482, the visiting Dominican priest Felix Fabri described Jerusalem as &quot;a dwelling place of diverse nations of the world, and is, as it were, a collection of all manner of abominations&quot;. As &quot;abominations&quot; he listed Saracens, Greeks, Syrians, Jacobites, Abyssinians, Nestorians, Armenians, Gregorians, Maronites, Turcomans, Bedouins, Assassins, a possible Druze sect, Mamluks, and the Jews, whom he referred to &quot;as the most cursed of all&quot;. However, a Christian pilgrim from Bohemia who had visited Jerusalem in 1491–1492 wrote in his book &quot;Journey to Jerusalem&quot;: &quot;Christians and Jews alike in Jerusalem lived in great poverty and in conditions of great deprivation, there are not many Christians but there are many Jews, and these the Muslims persecute in various ways. Christians and Jews go about in Jerusalem in clothes considered fit only for wandering beggars. The Muslims know that the Jews think and even say that this is the Holy Land which has been promised to them and that those Jews who dwell there are regarded as holy by Jews elsewhere, because, in spite of all the troubles and sorrows inflicted on them by the Muslims, they refuse to leave the Land.&quot; Only the Latin Christians &quot;long with all their hearts for Christian princes to come and subject all the country to the authority of the Church of Rome&quot;.

==Early modern period==

===Early Ottoman period===
In 1516, Jerusalem was taken over by the Ottoman Empire along with all of Greater Syria and enjoyed a period of renewal and peace under Suleiman the Magnificent, including the construction of the walls, which define until today what is now known as the Old City of Jerusalem. The outline of the walls largely follows that of different older fortifications. The rule of Suleiman and subsequent Ottoman Sultans brought an age of &quot;religious peace&quot;; Jew, Christian and Muslim enjoyed freedom of religion and it was possible to find a synagogue, a church and a mosque on the same street. The city remained open to all religions, although the empire&#x27;s faulty management after Suleiman the Magnificent meant economical stagnation.

====Latin presence====
In 1551 the Friars were expelled by the Turks from the Cenacle and from their adjoining monastery. However, they were granted permission to purchase a Georgian monastery of nuns in the northwest quarter of the city, which became the new center of the Custody in Jerusalem and developed into the Latin Convent of Saint Saviour (known as Dayr al Ātīn دير الاتين
دير اللاتين Arabic)).

====Jewish presence====
In 1700, Judah HeHasid led the largest organized group of Jewish immigrants to the Land of Israel in centuries. His disciples built the Hurva Synagogue, which served as the main synagogue in Jerusalem from the 18th century until 1948, when it was destroyed by the Arab Legion. The synagogue was rebuilt in 2010.

====Local vs. central power====
In response to the onerous taxation policies and military campaigns against the city&#x27;s hinterland by the governor Mehmed Pasha Kurd Bayram, the notables of Jerusalem, allied with the local peasantry and Bedouin, rebelled against the Ottomans in what became known as the Naqib al-Ashraf revolt and took control of the city in 1703–1705 before an imperial army reestablished Ottoman authority there. The consequent loss of power of Jerusalem&#x27;s al-Wafa&#x27;iya al-Husayni family, which led the rebellion, paved the way for the al-Husayni family becoming one of the city&#x27;s leading families. Thousands of Ottoman troops were garrisoned in Jerusalem in the aftermath of the revolt, which caused a decline in the local economy.

==Late modern period==
===Late Ottoman period===
In the mid-19th century, with the decline of the Ottoman Empire, the city was a backwater, with a population that did not exceed 8,000. Nevertheless, it was, even then, an extremely heterogeneous city because of its significance to Judaism, Christianity, and Islam. The population was divided into four major communities – Jewish, Christian, Muslim, and Armenian – and the first three of these could be further divided into countless subgroups, based on precise religious affiliation or country of origin. The Church of the Holy Sepulchre was meticulously partitioned between the Greek Orthodox, Catholic, Armenian, Coptic, and Ethiopian churches. Tensions between the groups ran so deep that the keys to the shrine and its doors were safeguarded by a pair of &#x27;neutral&#x27; Muslim families.

In his 1854 article for the New York Daily Tribune, Karl Marx provided a detailed and somber account of the demographics and living conditions in Jerusalem during the mid-19th century. He observed the harsh realities faced by the city&#x27;s diverse communities, particularly focusing on the plight of the Jewish population. Marx wrote:
At the time, the communities were located mainly around their primary shrines. The Muslim community surrounded the Haram ash-Sharif or Temple Mount (northeast), the Christians lived mainly in the vicinity of the Church of the Holy Sepulchre (northwest), the Jews lived mostly on the slope above the Western Wall (southeast), and the Armenians lived near the Zion Gate (southwest). In no way was this division exclusive, though it did form the basis of the four quarters during the British Mandate (1917–1948).

Several changes with long-lasting effects on the city occurred in the mid-19th century: their implications can be felt today and lie at the root of the Israeli–Palestinian conflict over Jerusalem. The first of these was a trickle of Jewish immigrants from the Middle East and Eastern Europe. The first such immigrants were Orthodox Jews: some were elderly individuals, who came to die in Jerusalem and be buried on the Mount of Olives; others were students, who came with their families to await the coming of the Messiah, adding new life to the local population. At the same time, European colonial powers began seeking toeholds in the city, hoping to expand their influence pending the imminent collapse of the Ottoman Empire. This was also an age of Christian religious revival, and many churches sent missionaries to proselytize among the Muslim and especially the Jewish populations, believing that this would speed the Second Coming of Christ. Finally, the combination of European colonialism and religious zeal was expressed in a new scientific interest in the biblical lands in general and Jerusalem in particular. Archeological and other expeditions made some spectacular finds, which increased interest in Jerusalem even more.

By the 1860s, the city, with an area of only one square kilometer, was already overcrowded. Thus began the construction of the New City, the part of Jerusalem outside of the city walls. Seeking new areas to stake their claims, the Russian Orthodox Church began constructing a complex, now known as the Russian Compound, a few hundred meters from Jaffa Gate. The first attempt at residential settlement outside the walls of Jerusalem was undertaken by Jews, who built a small complex on the hill overlooking Zion Gate, across the Valley of Hinnom. This settlement, known as Mishkenot Sha&#x27;ananim, eventually flourished and set the precedent for other new communities to spring up to the west and north of the Old City. In time, as the communities grew and connected geographically, this became known as the New City.

In 1882, around 150 Jewish families arrived in Jerusalem from Yemen. Initially they were not accepted by the Jews of Jerusalem and lived in destitute conditions supported by the Christians of the Swedish-American colony, who called them Gadites. In 1884, the Yemenites moved into Silwan.

===British Mandate period===

The British were victorious over the Ottomans in the Middle East during World War I and victory in Palestine was a step towards dismemberment of that empire. General Sir Edmund Allenby, commander-in-chief of the Egyptian Expeditionary Force, entered Jerusalem on foot out of respect for the Holy City, on 11 December 1917.

By the time General Allenby took Jerusalem from the Ottomans in 1917, the new city was a patchwork of neighborhoods and communities, each with a distinct ethnic character. This continued under British rule, as the New City of Jerusalem grew outside the old city walls, and the Old City of Jerusalem gradually emerged as little more than an impoverished older neighborhood. Sir Ronald Storrs, the first British military governor of the city, issued a town planning order requiring new buildings in the city to be faced with sandstone and thus preserving some of the overall look of the city even as it grew. The Pro-Jerusalem Council played an important role in the outlook of the British-ruled city.

The British had to deal with a conflicting demand that was rooted in Ottoman rule. Agreements for the supply of water, electricity, and the construction of a tramway system—all under concessions granted by the Ottoman authorities—had been signed by the city of Jerusalem and a Greek citizen, Euripides Mavromatis, on 27 January 1914. Work under these concessions had not begun and, by the end of the war the British occupying forces refused to recognize their validity. Mavromatis claimed that his concessions overlapped with the Auja Concession that the government had awarded to Rutenberg in 1921 and that he had been deprived of his legal rights. The Mavromatis concession, in effect despite earlier British attempts to abolish it, covered Jerusalem and other localities (e.g., Bethlehem) within a radius of around the Church of the Holy Sepulchre.

In 1922, the League of Nations at the Conference of Lausanne entrusted the United Kingdom to administer Palestine, neighbouring Transjordan, and Iraq beyond it. From 1922 to 1948 the total population of the city rose from 52,000 to 165,000, comprising two-thirds Jews and one-third Arabs (Muslims and Christians). Relations between Arab Christians and Muslims and the growing Jewish population in Jerusalem deteriorated, resulting in recurring unrest. Jerusalem, in particular, was affected by the 1920 Nebi Musa riots and 1929 Palestine riots. Under the British, new garden suburbs were built in the western and northern parts of the city and institutions of higher learning such as the Hebrew University were founded. Two important new institutions, the Hadassah Medical Center and Hebrew University, were founded on Jerusalem&#x27;s Mount Scopus. The level of violence continued to escalate throughout the 1930s and 1940s. In July 1946 members of the underground Zionist group Irgun blew up a part of the King David Hotel, where the British forces were temporarily located, an act which led to the death of 91 civilians.

On 29 November 1947, the United Nations General Assembly approved a plan which would partition Mandatory Palestine into two states: one Jewish and one Arab. Each state would be composed of three major sections, linked by extraterritorial crossroads, plus an Arab enclave at Jaffa. Expanded Jerusalem would fall under international control as a Corpus Separatum.

===War and partition between Israel and Jordan (1948–1967)===
====1948 war====
After partition, the fight for Jerusalem escalated, with heavy casualties among both fighters and civilians on the British, Jewish, and Arab sides. By the end of March 1948, just before the British withdrawal, and with the British increasingly reluctant to intervene, the roads to Jerusalem were cut off by Arab irregulars, placing the Jewish population of the city under siege. The siege was eventually broken, though massacres of civilians occurred on both sides, before the 1948 Arab–Israeli War began with the end of the British Mandate in May 1948.

The 1948 Arab–Israeli War led to massive displacement of Arab and Jewish populations. According to Benny Morris, due to mob and militia violence on both sides, 1,500 of the 3,500 (mostly ultra-Orthodox) Jews in the Old City evacuated to west Jerusalem as a unit. See also Jewish Quarter. The comparatively populous Arab village of Lifta (today within the bounds of Jerusalem) was captured by Israeli troops in 1948, and its residents were loaded on trucks and taken to East Jerusalem. The villages of Deir Yassin, Ein Karem and Malcha, as well as neighborhoods to the west of Jerusalem&#x27;s Old City such as Talbiya, Katamon, Baka, Mamilla and Abu Tor, also came under Israeli control, and their residents were forcibly displaced; in some cases, as documented by Israeli historian Benny Morris and Palestinian historian Walid Khalidi, among others, expulsions and massacres occurred.

In May 1948 the US Consul, Thomas C. Wasson, was assassinated outside the YMCA building. Four months later the UN mediator, Count Bernadotte, was also shot dead in the Katamon district of Jerusalem by the Jewish Stern Group.

===Division between Jordan and Israel (1948–1967)===
The United Nations proposed, in its 1947 plan for the partition of Palestine, for Jerusalem to be a city under international administration. The city was to be completely surrounded by the Arab state, with only a highway to connect international Jerusalem to the Jewish state.

Following the 1948 Arab-Israeli War, Jerusalem was divided. The Western half of the New City became part of the newly formed state of Israel, while the eastern half, along with the Old City, was occupied by Jordan.
According to David Guinn,
Concerning Jewish holy sites, Jordan breached its commitment to appoint a committee to discuss, among other topics, free access of Jews to the holy sites under its jurisdiction, mainly in the Western Wall and the important Jewish cemetery on the Mount of Olives, as provided in the Article 8.2 of the Cease Fire Agreement between it and Israel dated April 3, 1949. Jordan permitted the paving of new roads in the cemetery, and tombstones were used for paving in Jordanian army camps. The Cave of Shimon the Just became a stable.

According to Gerald M. Steinberg, Jordan ransacked 57 ancient synagogues, libraries and centers of religious study in the Old City Of Jerusalem, 12 were totally and deliberately destroyed. Those that remained standing were defaced, used for housing of both people and animals. Appeals were made to the United Nations and in the international community to declare the Old City to be an &#x27;open city&#x27; and stop this destruction, but there was no response. &quot;(See also Hurva Synagogue)&quot;

On 23 January 1950, the Knesset passed a resolution that stated Jerusalem was the capital of Israel.

===State of Israel===

East Jerusalem was captured by the Israel Defense Forces on June 7, 1967 during Six-Day War. On June 11, Israel demolished the seven centuries old Moroccan Quarter; along with it, it destroyed 14 religious buildings, including 2 mosques, 135 homes inhabited by 650 people. Thereafter a public plaza was built in its place adjoining the Western Wall. However, the Waqf (Islamic trust) was granted administration of the Temple Mount and thereafter Jewish prayer on the site was prohibited by both Israeli and Waqf authorities.

Most Jews celebrated the event as a liberation of the city; a new Israeli holiday was created, Jerusalem Day (&quot;Yom Yerushalayim&quot;), and the most popular secular Hebrew song, &quot;Jerusalem of Gold&quot; (&quot;Yerushalayim shel zahav&quot;), became popular in celebration. Many large state gatherings of the State of Israel take place at the Western Wall today, including the swearing-in of various Israel army officers units, national ceremonies such as memorial services for fallen Israeli soldiers on &quot;Yom Hazikaron&quot;, huge celebrations on &quot;Yom Ha&#x27;atzmaut&quot; (Israel Independence Day), huge gatherings of tens of thousands on Jewish religious holidays, and ongoing daily prayers by regular attendees. The Western Wall has become a major tourist destination spot.

Under Israeli control, members of all religions are largely granted access to their holy sites. The major exceptions being security limitations placed on some Arabs from the West Bank and Gaza Strip from accessing holy sites due to their inadmissibility to Jerusalem, as well as limitations on Jews from visiting the Temple Mount due to both politically motivated restrictions (where they are allowed to walk on the Mount in small groups, but are forbidden to pray or study while there) and religious edicts that forbid Jews from trespassing on what may be the site of the Holy of the Holies. Concerns have been raised about possible attacks on the al-Aqsa Mosque after a serious arson attack on the mosque in 1969 (started by Denis Michael Rohan, an Australian fundamentalist Christian found by the court to be insane). Riots broke out following the opening of an exit in the Arab Quarter for the Western Wall Tunnel on the instructions of the Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, which prior Prime Minister Shimon Peres had instructed to be put on hold for the sake of peace (stating &quot;it has waited for over 1000 years, it could wait a few more&quot;).

Conversely, Israeli and other Jews have showed concerns over excavations being done by the Waqf on the Temple Mount that could harm Temple relics, particularly excavations to the north of Solomon&#x27;s Stables that were designed to create an emergency exit for them (having been pressured to do so by Israeli authorities). Some Jewish sources allege that the Waqf&#x27;s excavations in Solomon&#x27;s Stables also seriously harmed the Southern Wall; however an earthquake in 2004 that damaged the eastern wall could also be to blame.

The status of East Jerusalem remains a highly controversial issue. The international community does not recognize the annexation of the eastern part of the city, and most countries maintain their embassies in Tel Aviv. In May 2018 The United States and Guatemala moved the embassies to Jerusalem. The United Nations Security Council Resolution 478 declared that the Knesset&#x27;s 1980 &quot;Jerusalem Law&quot; declaring Jerusalem as Israel&#x27;s &quot;eternal and indivisible&quot; capital was &quot;null and void and must be rescinded forthwith&quot;. This resolution advised member states to withdraw their diplomatic representation from the city as a punitive measure. The council has also condemned Israeli settlement in territories captured in 1967, including East Jerusalem (see UNSCR 452, 465 and 741).

Since Israel gained control over East Jerusalem in 1967, Jewish settler organizations have sought to establish a Jewish presence in neighborhoods such as Silwan. In the 1980s, &quot;Haaretz&quot; reports, the Housing Ministry &quot;then under Ariel Sharon, worked hard to seize control of property in the Old City and in the adjacent neighborhood of Silwan by declaring them absentee property. The suspicion arose that some of the transactions were not legal; an examination committee ... found numerous flaws.&quot; In particular, affidavits claiming that Arab homes in the area were absentee properties, filed by Jewish organizations, were accepted by the Custodian without any site visits or other follow-up on the claims. ElAd, a settlement organization which &quot;Haaretz&quot; says promotes the &quot;Judaization&quot; of East Jerusalem, and the Ateret Cohanim organization, are working to increase Jewish settlement in Silwan in cooperation with the Committee for the Renewal of the Yemenite Village in Shiloah.

See Jewish Quarter (Jerusalem).

==Historiography==

Given the city&#x27;s central position in Israeli nationalism and Palestinian nationalism, the selectivity required to summarize 5,000 years of inhabited history is often influenced by ideological bias or background. For example, the Jewish periods of the city&#x27;s history are important to Israeli nationalists, whose discourse states that modern Jews originate and descend from the Israelites, while the Islamic periods of the city&#x27;s history are important to Palestinian nationalists, whose discourse suggests that modern Palestinians descend from all the different peoples who have lived in the region. As a result, both sides claim the history of the city has been politicized by the other in order to strengthen their relative claims to the city, and that this is borne out by the different focuses the different writers place on the various events and eras in the city&#x27;s history.

<doc id="360507" wikidata="Q3511204" url="?curid=360507" title="Gimel function">
<text>In axiomatic set theory, the gimel function is the following function mapping cardinal numbers to cardinal numbers:

:formula_1

where cf denotes the cofinality function; the gimel function is used for studying the continuum function and the cardinal exponentiation function. The symbol formula_2 is a serif form of the Hebrew letter gimel.

==Values of the gimel function==

The gimel function has the property formula_3 for all infinite cardinals formula_4 by König&#x27;s theorem.

For regular cardinals 
formula_4, 
formula_6, and Easton&#x27;s theorem says we don&#x27;t know much about the values of this function. For singular 
formula_4, upper bounds for formula_8 can be found from Shelah&#x27;s PCF theory.

==The gimel hypothesis==

The gimel hypothesis states that formula_9. In essence, this means that formula_8 for singular formula_4 is the smallest value allowed by the axioms of Zermelo–Fraenkel set theory (assuming consistency).

Under this hypothesis cardinal exponentiation is simplified, though not to the extent of the continuum hypothesis (which implies the gimel hypothesis).

==Reducing the exponentiation function to the gimel function==

 showed that all cardinal exponentiation is determined (recursively) by the gimel function as follows. 

*If formula_4 is an infinite regular cardinal (in particular any infinite successor) then formula_13
*If formula_4 is infinite and singular and the continuum function is eventually constant below formula_4 then formula_16
*If formula_4 is a limit and the continuum function is not eventually constant below formula_4 then formula_19

The remaining rules hold whenever formula_4 and formula_21 are both infinite:

*If then 
*If for some then 
*If and for all and then 
*If and for all and then

<text>Joshua Mqabuko Nyongolo Nkomo (19 June 1917 – 1 July 1999) was a Zimbabwean revolutionary and politician who served as Vice-President of Zimbabwe from 1990 until his death in 1999. He founded and led the Zimbabwe African People&#x27;s Union (ZAPU) from 1961 until it merged in 1987 with Robert Mugabe&#x27;s Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU) to form ZANU–PF after an internal military crackdown called Gukurahundi in western Zimbabwe, mostly on ethnic Ndebele ZAPU supporters.

He was a leading trade union leader, who progressed on to become president of the banned National Democratic Party, and was jailed for ten years by Rhodesia&#x27;s white minority government. After his release in 1974, ZAPU contributed to the fall of that government, along with the splinter rival ZANU, created in 1963.

In 1983, fearing for his life in the early stages of the Gukurahundi, Nkomo fled the country. Later in 1987, he controversially signed the Unity Accord allowing ZAPU to merge with ZANU to stop the genocide.

Nkomo earned many nicknames like &quot;Umafukufuku&quot; in Ndebele, &quot;Father Zimbabwe&quot; in English, and &quot;Chibwechitedza&quot; (&quot;the slippery rock&quot;) in Shona.

==Early life==

Nkomo was born on 19 June 1917 in Matopos, Matabeleland, Southern Rhodesia (now Matobo, Zimbabwe) to a poor Ndebele family. He was one of eight children. His father (Thomas Nyongolo Letswansto Nkomo) worked as a preacher and a cattle rancher and worked for the London Missionary Society. His mother was Mlingo Hadebe.

After completing his primary education in Southern Rhodesia, Nkomo took a carpentry course at the Tsholotsho Government Industrial School and studied there for a year before becoming a driver. He later tried animal husbandry, then became a schoolteacher specialising in carpentry at Manyame School in Kezi. In 1942, at the age of 25, during his career as a teacher, he decided that he should go to South Africa to further his education, do carpentry and qualify to a higher level. He attended Adams College and the Jan H. Hofmeyr School of Social Work in South Africa, where he met Nelson Mandela and other future nationalist leaders at the University of Fort Hare, although he did not attend that university. It was at the Jan Hofmeyr School of Social Work that he was awarded a diploma in social work in 1952. Nkomo married his wife Johanna Fuyana on 1 October 1949.

==Politics 1947–1964==
After returning to Bulawayo in 1947, he became a trade unionist for black railway workers and rose to the leadership of the Railway Workers Union and then to leadership of the Southern Rhodesian chapter of the African National Congress. In 1953 he ran for Parliament in the first federal election, although he lost. The Southern Rhodesian ANC branch became the Southern Rhodesia African National Congress (SRANC), and in 1957 Nkomo was elected chairman. Nkomo was out of the country in 1959 when SRANC was banned, its property confiscated, and many of its leaders arrested.

On 1 January 1960, the National Democratic Party (NDP) was founded by Nkomo and others from the SRANC leadership to succeed the banned SRANC, and adopted their goals and organizational structure, as well as subsuming their membership. That year he became president of the NDP with the support of Robert Mugabe. The NDP was banned in December 1961 by the Rhodesian government.

Nkomo immediately formed the Zimbabwe African Peoples Union (ZAPU) together with Samuel Parirenyatwa, Ndabaningi Sithole, Robert Mugabe, and others. That party was also banned by the Rhodesian white minority government nine months later in September 1962.

ZAPU split in 1963 with Sithole and Mugabe taking their supporters and forming the Zimbabwe African National Union (ZANU). While some have claimed this split was due to ethnic tensions, more accurately the split was motivated by the failure of Sithole, Mugabe, Takawira and Malianga to wrest control of ZAPU from Nkomo. ZAPU would remain a multi-ethnic party right up until independence.

== Armed struggle ==

Nkomo was detained at Gonakudzingwa Restriction Camp by Ian Smith&#x27;s government in 1964, with fellow outlaw rebels Ndabaningi Sithole, Edgar Tekere, Enos Nkala, Maurice Nyagumbo, and Mugabe, until 1974. Paul Tangi Mhova Mkondo a student youth leader was also detained with them for some time. A large number of them were released due to pressure from South African Prime Minister John Vorster. Following Nkomo&#x27;s release, he went to Zambia to continue opposing the Rhodesian government through the dual processes of armed resistance and negotiation.

Unlike ZANU&#x27;s armed wing – the Zimbabwe African National Liberation Army, ZAPU&#x27;s armed wing – the Zimbabwe People&#x27;s Revolutionary Army – was dedicated to both guerrilla warfare and conventional warfare. At the time of independence ZIPRA had a modern military, stationed in Zambia and Angola, consisting of Soviet-made Mikoyan fighters, tanks and armoured personnel carriers, as well as well trained artillery units.

Nkomo was the target of two attempted assassinations. The first one, in Zambia, by the Selous Scouts, was a false flag operation. The mission was ultimately aborted and attempted later, unsuccessfully, by the Rhodesian Special Air Service (SAS). In August 2011 it was reported by the BBC that Nkomo had been tipped off by the British government.

ZAPU forces strategically weakened the Rhodesian government during the Bush War. The most widely reported and possibly the most effective of these attacks were the downing of two Air Rhodesia Vickers Viscount civilian passenger planes with surface-to-air missiles, resulting in the deaths of 107 people in total. The first, on 3 September 1978, killed 38 out of 56 in the crash with a further ten survivors (including women and children) shot dead by ZIPRA cadres sent to inspect the burnt wreckage.

Nkomo later dismissed the massacre as false allegations perpetrated by the Rhodesian media and expressed his regret at the downing of a civilian plane, but defended the act by stating the Rhodesian government was known to transport military personnel aboard civilian liners. The eight remaining survivors eluded the guerrillas by hiding overnight in the bush; some walked towards Karoi to seek help. Some of the passengers had serious injuries and they were picked up by local police and debriefed by the Rhodesian army.

The second shooting down, on 12 February 1979, killed all 59 on board. The target of the second attack was reportedly General Peter Walls, head of the COMOPS (Commander, Combined Operations), in charge of the Special Forces, including the SAS and the Selous Scouts. Due to the large number of tourists returning to Salisbury a second flight had been dispatched. General Walls received a boarding card for the second flight, which departed Kariba 15 minutes after the doomed aircraft.

No one was ever brought to trial or charged with shooting down the aircraft due to amnesty laws passed by both Smith and Mugabe. In a television interview not long after the attack on the first aircraft, Nkomo joked about the incident while admitting ZAPU had indeed been responsible. In his memoir, &quot;Story of My Life&quot;, published in 1984, Nkomo later said, &quot;during that interview, the interviewee had asked about what we used to down the planes and I said stones, jokingly in an attempt to avoid answering the question due to military intelligence which demanded secrecy regarding what type of weapons we had acquired from the Soviet Union. They remembered the laugh and not the regret for the shooting down of both aircraft.&quot; 

==Politics 1980–1999==
Following the first majority-rule election in Zimbabwe-Rhodesia in which around 60% of the population voted, a government led by Abel Muzorewa, was formed in 1979 between Ian Smith and Ndabaningi Sithole&#x27;s ZANU Mwenje, which by now had also split from Mugabe&#x27;s more militant ZANU faction. The civil war waged by Nkomo and Mugabe continued unabated and Britain and the USA did not lift sanctions on the country. Britain persuaded all parties to come to Lancaster House in September 1979 to work out a constitution and the basis for fresh elections. Mugabe and Nkomo shared a delegation, called the Patriotic Front (PF), at the negotiations chaired by Lord Carrington.

Nkomo proposed to address Zimbabwe-Rhodesia&#x27;s land question with Georgist principles of collecting ground rent but leaving improvements to those who built them.

Elections were held in 1980 and to the surprise of Nkomo but few others, the Common Roll vote split on predictable tribal lines, with the 20 seats in Matabeleland going to ZAPU (listed as &quot;PF–ZAPU&quot;) and all but three of the sixty in predominantly Shona areas falling to Mugabe&#x27;s ZANU–PF. Nkomo was offered the ceremonial post of President, but declined, instead being appointed Minister of Home Affairs.

===Conflict with Mugabe===
Despite reaching their ultimate goal, ousting Smith&#x27;s minority regime, Nkomo could not reconcile his differences with Mugabe.

Ideological differences kept the two men apart as Mugabe&#x27;s Marxism clashed with Nkomo&#x27;s Georgist reformism. Nkomo&#x27;s ethnic background was also grounds for distrust by Mugabe who constantly feared an uprising by the historically turbulent Ndebele population. Nkomo would make concessions and attempts to improve relationships but met with varying results, the most successful being the ones where Sally Hayfron would intervene, as she was the only person within Mugabe&#x27;s party who was supportive of Nkomo. 

Initially, Mugabe refused to give Nkomo the position of Minister of Defence which Nkomo had been hoping for. After the intervention of Sally Hayfron, Nkomo was appointed to the cabinet (as minister without portfolio), but in 1982 was accused of plotting a coup d&#x27;état after South African double agents in Zimbabwe&#x27;s Central Intelligence Organization, attempting to cause distrust between ZAPU and ZANU, planted arms on ZAPU owned farms and then tipped Mugabe off to their existence.

In a public statement Mugabe said, &quot;ZAPU and its leader, Dr. Joshua Nkomo, are like a cobra in a house. The only way to deal effectively with a snake is to strike and destroy its head.&quot; He unleashed the Fifth Brigade upon Nkomo&#x27;s Matabeleland homeland in Operation Gukurahundi, killing up to 20,000 Ndebele civilians in an attempt to destroy ZAPU and create a one-party state. Nkomo fled the country. Mugabe&#x27;s government claimed that he had &quot;illegally&quot; left dressed as a woman:
Nkomo ridiculed the suggestion that he escaped dressed as a woman. &quot;I expected they would invent stupid stories about my flight... People will believe anything if they believe that&quot;. He added that &quot;nothing in my life had prepared me for persecution at the hands of a government led by black Africans.&quot;

After the Gukurahundi massacres, in 1987 Nkomo consented to the absorption of ZAPU into ZANU, resulting in a unified party called ZANU-PF, leaving Zimbabwe as effectively a one-party state and leading some Ndebeles to accuse Nkomo of selling out. These Ndebele individuals were in such a minority that they did not constitute a meaningful power base within ZAPU. As part of the deal, Nkomo became vice-president when the constitution was amended to create a second vice-president in 1990. He was sworn in as vice-president on 6 August 1990. In practice, the post was almost powerless. With his health failing, his influence declined.

When asked late in his life why he allowed this to happen, he told historian Eliakim Sibanda that he did it to stop the murder of the Ndebele (who supported his party) and of the ZAPU politicians and organizers who had been targeted by Zimbabwe&#x27;s security forces since 1982. &quot;Mugabe and his Shona henchmen have always sought the extermination of the Ndebele,&quot; he said.

== Personal life ==

=== Family ===
Nkomo married his wife Johanna in 1949. They had four children: Thandiwe Nkomo, Ernest Thutani, Michael
Sibangilizwe, and Louise Sehlule

===Religion===
Nkomo had a Presbyterian Church of Southern Africa chaplain in his militia days, and was ordained a Methodist lay preacher. Described as &quot;not an ardent churchgoer&quot; in 1962, he returned to preaching in retirement. He proclaimed respect for traditional African religions and made use of their ceremonies and symbolism in his political campaigning. In his last years he converted to Roman Catholicism.

===Death===
Nkomo died of prostate cancer on 1 July 1999 at the age of 82 in Parirenyatwa Hospital in Harare.

==Legacy and honours==
Letters to the prime minister, Robert Mugabe, allegedly written by Nkomo while in exile in the United Kingdom, began to resurface following Nkomo&#x27;s death in 1999. In the letters he argues against his persecution and accused the government of cracking down on opposition.

In 1999, Nkomo was declared a National Hero and is buried in the National Heroes&#x27; Acre in Harare.

On 27 June 2000, a set of four postage stamps were issued by the Post and Telecommunications Corporation of Zimbabwe featuring Joshua Nkomo. They had denominations of ZW$2.00, $9.10, $12.00 and $16.00.

<doc id="360519" wikidata="Q1766944" url="?curid=360519" title="Sailing to Philadelphia">
<text>Sailing to Philadelphia is the second solo studio album by British singer-songwriter and guitarist Mark Knopfler, released on 25 September 2000 by Vertigo Records internationally, and by Warner Bros. Records in the United States. The album contains featured vocal performances by James Taylor, Van Morrison, and Chris Difford and Glenn Tilbrook of Squeeze.

The title track is drawn from &quot;Mason &amp; Dixon&quot; by Thomas Pynchon, a novel about Charles Mason and Jeremiah Dixon, the two English surveyors who established the border separating Pennsylvania and Delaware from Maryland and Virginia in the 1760s. This border later became known as the Mason–Dixon line and has been used since the 1820s to denote the border between the Southern United States and the Northern United States.

==Critical reception==

In his review for AllMusic, William Ruhlmann gave the album three out of five stars, writing that &quot;in one song after another on this album, you get the feeling that he started out playing some familiar song in a specific genre and eventually extrapolated upon it enough to call it an original.&quot; In his review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, David Wild gave the album three and a half out of five stars, writing that the album is &quot;a welcome flashback&quot; to Knopfler&#x27;s earlier work with Dire Straits. Wild continued
By 2002, the album had sold more than 3.5 million copies worldwide. In some territories—Western Europe for example—the album was released as an HDCD and a 5.1 Surround Sound DVD-A.

==Touring==

In 2001, Knopfler supported the release of the album with his Sailing to Philadelphia Tour, which started on 27 March 2001 in Mexico City, Mexico, included 80 concerts in 68 cities, and ended on 31 July 2001 in Moscow, Russia. The tour consisted of three legs: Mexico and South America, North America, and Europe and Russia. The tour lineup included Mark Knopfler (guitar, vocals), Guy Fletcher (keyboards), Richard Bennett (guitar), Glenn Worf (bass), Chad Cromwell (drums), Geraint Watkins (piano, accordion), and Mike Henderson (guitar, mandolin, violin, harmonica).

The Madrid concert on 2 July 2001 was filmed but never released. The Toronto concert at Massey Hall on 3 May 2001 was also recorded, but only four tracks were officially released: &quot;Speedway At Nazareth&quot; (the B-side of &quot;Why Aye Man&quot;), &quot;Who&#x27;s Your Baby Now&quot; (the B-side of &quot;Boom, Like That&quot;), &quot;Sailing to Philadelphia&quot; and &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; (both available on a limited edition version of the album &quot;The Ragpicker&#x27;s Dream&quot;).

<text>Ralph Joseph Gleason (March 1, 1917 – June 3, 1975) was an American music critic and columnist. He contributed for many years to the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;, was a founding editor of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine, and cofounder of the Monterey Jazz Festival. A pioneering jazz and rock critic, he helped the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; transition into the rock era.

==Life and career==
Ralph Joseph Gleason was born in New York City on March 1, 1917. Gleason discovered jazz when, during a siege of measles while a student at Horace Greeley High School in Chappaqua, New York, he heard Louis Armstrong, Earl Hines and Fletcher Henderson on the radio. He graduated from Columbia University (where he was news editor of the &quot;Columbia Daily Spectator&quot;) in 1938. In 1939, Gleason co-founded &quot;Jazz Information&quot; with Eugene Williams, Ralph de Toledano, and Jean Rayburn, who Gleason would marry in 1940 and have three children.

During World War II, he worked for the Office of War Information. After the war, Gleason settled in San Francisco, which he considered a better town for hearing jazz than New York, and began writing for the &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot;. Gleason wrote a syndicated column on jazz, hosted radio programs, and co-founded the Monterey Jazz Festival with James L. Lyons. He also wrote liner notes for Lenny Bruce&#x27;s comedy albums and testified for the defense at Bruce&#x27;s San Francisco 1962 obscenity trial.

Gleason wrote liner notes for a broad variety of releases, including the 1959 Frank Sinatra album &quot;No One Cares&quot; and the 1970 Miles Davis album &quot;Bitches Brew&quot;. From 1948 to 1960, he doubled as an associate editor and critic for &quot;DownBeat&quot;. He also taught music appreciation courses at University of California Extension (1960-1963) and Sonoma State University (1965-1967).

Gleason was a widely respected commentator when he began to support several Bay Area rock bands, including Jefferson Airplane and the Grateful Dead, in the late 1960s. Although Gleason was sometimes criticized for minimizing the importance of or simply ignoring acts from Los Angeles, others judged that he was making a valid distinction between works of creative vitality and music business product.

Gleason was a contributing editor to &quot;Ramparts&quot;, a prominent leftist magazine based in San Francisco, but quit after editor Warren Hinckle criticized the city&#x27;s growing hippie population. With Jann Wenner, another &quot;Ramparts&quot; staffer, Gleason founded the bi-weekly music magazine &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, to which he contributed as a consulting editor until his death in 1975. He was in the midst of an acrimonious split with Wenner and the magazine when he died. For ten years he also wrote a syndicated weekly column on jazz and pop music that ran in the &quot;New York Post&quot; and many other papers throughout the United States and Europe.

Gleason&#x27;s articles also appeared other publications, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;New Statesman&quot;, &quot;Evergreen Review&quot;, &quot;The American Scholar&quot;, &quot;Saturday Review&quot;, the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, the &quot;Sydney Morning Herald&quot;, &quot;Playboy&quot;, &quot;Esquire&quot;, &quot;Variety&quot;, &quot;The Milwaukee Journal&quot;1 and &quot;Hi-Fi/Stereo Review&quot;.

For National Educational Television (now known as PBS), Gleason produced a series of twenty-eight programs on jazz and blues, &quot;Jazz Casual&quot;, featuring Dizzy Gillespie, B.B. King, John Coltrane, Dave Brubeck, the Modern Jazz Quartet, Vince Guaraldi with Bola Sete, Jimmy Witherspoon, and Sonny Rollins, among others. The series ran from 1961 to 1968. He also produced a two-hour documentary on Duke Ellington, which was twice nominated for an Emmy.

Other films for television included a four-part series on the Monterey Jazz Festival, the first documentary for television on pop music, &quot;Anatomy of a Hit&quot;, and the hour-long programs on San Francisco rock, &quot;Go Ride the Music&quot;, for the series &quot;Fanfare&quot;, episode 9, for National Educational Television, &quot;A Night at the Family Dog&quot;, episode 10, for National Educational Television, and &quot;West Pole&quot;.

Gleason&#x27;s name shows up in tribute on Red Garland&#x27;s &quot;Ralph J. Gleason Blues&quot; from the 1958 recording &quot;Rojo&quot; (Prestige PRLP 7193), re-released on &quot;Red&#x27;s Blues&quot; in 1998.

Gleason&#x27;s lasting legacy, however, is his work with &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. His name, alongside that of Hunter S. Thompson, still remains on the magazine&#x27;s masthead today, more than four decades after his death.

On June 3, 1975, Gleason died of a heart attack at the age of 58 in Berkeley, California.

<text>The Parts of Kesteven ( or ) are a traditional division of Lincolnshire, England. This division had long had a separate county administration (quarter sessions), along with the two other Parts of Lincolnshire, Lindsey and Holland.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Kesteven&quot; is first attested in the late tenth century Latin translation of the Anglo-Saxon Chronicle by Æthelweard, in the form (agreed by scholars to be a scribal error for ). The name appears in the Domesday Book of 1086 as &quot;Chetsteven&quot; and from 1185 as . The first part of the name comes from the Common Brittonic word &#x27; (&quot;woodland&quot;), still found in Modern Welsh as &#x27;. The second element is the Old Norse word (&quot;meeting place&quot;). Thus the name a place named by Brittonic-speakers as &quot;Woodland&quot; came to be included by Old Norse speakers coining a name that meant &quot;meeting place at [the place called] Coed&quot;.

==Administrative areas==
===Wapentakes and Sokes===
Historically, Lincolnshire was divided into wapentakes, hundreds and sokes. The following made up Kesteven:

* Aswardburn Wapentake
* Aveland Wapentake
* Beltisloe Wapentake
* Boothby Graffo Wapentake
* Flaxwell Wapentake
* Langoe Wapentake
* Lovedon Wapentake
* Ness Wapentake
* Winnibriggs and Threo Wapentake
* Borough and Soke of Grantham
* Stamford Borough

=== Local Government Act 1888 ===
The three parts were given separate elected county councils in 1889 by the Local Government Act 1888, and recognised as administrative counties. Kesteven lies in the south-west of Lincolnshire. It includes the towns of:

* Bourne
* Bracebridge
* Grantham
* Market Deeping
* Sleaford
* Stamford

===Local Government Act 1894===
Under the Local Government Act 1894 Kesteven was divided into a number of rural district and urban districts based on earlier sanitary districts:

*Bourne Rural District
*Branston Rural District
*Grantham Rural District
*Claypole Rural District
*Sleaford Rural District
*Uffington Rural District

The urban districts and boroughs were:
*Bourne
*Bracebridge
*Grantham (borough)
*Ruskington
*Sleaford
*Stamford (borough)

Bourne Urban District was abolished in 1920, with Bourne becoming a parish in Bourne Rural District. Bracebridge became part of the county borough of Lincoln that same year, becoming associated with the Parts of Lindsey.

===Local Government Act 1929===
The rural districts were re-organised by a County Review Order in 1929, to create four new districts named after points of the compass:

*East Kesteven Rural District
*North Kesteven Rural District
*South Kesteven Rural District
*West Kesteven Rural District

===Local Government Act 1972===
These separate county councils were abolished in 1974 and Lincolnshire (minus the northern part of Lindsey) had a single county council for the first time, although the names of the Parts survive in some of the names of district councils. Under the Local Government Act 1972, the four rural districts in Kesteven, along with the boroughs and urban district, merged into two district councils:

*North Kesteven District Council - A merger of North and East Rural Districts and Sleaford Urban District
*South Kesteven District Council - A merger of South and West Rural Districts and the boroughs of Grantham and Stamford

==Titles of nobility associated with Kesteven==
* The title of &quot;Baron Kesteven&quot; existed from 1868 until 1915.
* The title of &quot;Duke of Ancaster and Kesteven&quot; existed from 1715 to 1809.
* Margaret Thatcher, former Prime Minister of the United Kingdom and Kesteven native, chose &#x27;of Kesteven&#x27; as the territorial designation for her life peerage in 1992, becoming &quot;Baroness Thatcher, of Kesteven in the County of Lincolnshire&quot;.

==Track listing==
The Sire Records (US) version of &quot;On&quot; contains only &quot;On&quot;, &quot;73-Yips&quot;, and &quot;Xepha&quot; with early fade-outs, followed by the Reload Mix of &quot;On&quot;, and it is housed in an Ecopak case instead of the standard slimline jewel case in which the Warp (UK) release was packaged.

The &quot;D-Scape Mix&quot;, in actuality a remix of &quot;D-Scape&quot; from &quot;On&quot;, features mostly harsh sucking noises.

==Production==
In the 2015 Soundcloud dump, James states that he produced some of the sounds in &quot;Xepha&quot; by modifying a DAT player to play back tapes that he purposefully damaged. He claims that he created distorted sounds by stretching tapes, spraying them with hair spray, as well as changing the playback speed of the motor.

==Music video==
The music video for the title track was directed by Jarvis Cocker and Martin Wallace, and features a stop-motion sequence filmed on a beach involving numerous props (including an old fashioned diving suit and a cardboard cutout of James), and images of the tide. Drips of water are synchronized with the piano. The film was shot on location in Hilbre Island, West Kirby, Wirral, UK. James was hands-off from the video&#x27;s making, apart from insisting that it did not feature any computer graphics. He was however satisfied with the end result, stating that it &quot;does the job&quot;. It is available on the &quot;Come to Viddy&quot; (VHS, 1997) and &quot;WarpVision: The Videos 1989–2004&quot; (DVD, 2004) compilations.

<doc id="360568" wikidata="Q6509153" url="?curid=360568" title="Death of Leah Betts">
<text>Leah Sarah Betts (1 November 1977 – 16 November 1995) was an Englishwoman from Latchingdon, Essex, who died shortly after her 18th birthday after taking an ecstasy (MDMA) tablet, and then drinking approximately of water in a 90-minute period. Four hours later, she collapsed into a coma, from which she did not recover. The inquest determined that the death had resulted from water intoxication and hyponatremia, which in turn led to serious swelling of the brain, though the ecstasy may have inhibited her ability to urinate.

Her death received extensive media coverage, and her family have since campaigned against drug abuse. 

==Initial press and public reaction==
When Leah Betts was first admitted to hospital in a coma, her family released her image to the national media as an example of the dangers of illegal drugs, specifically ecstasy, in an attempt to deter other young people from using drugs. This campaigning continued for years following her death. 

Leah&#x27;s mother, Dorothy May Betts, had died of a heart attack three years prior, in 1992, at age 45. Following this, Leah lived with her father Paul Betts (a former police officer), her stepmother (a nurse), and her brother William, who was seven years younger. 

The fact that Betts&#x27;s life was typical of middle-class families in Britain was a likely factor in the widespread coverage of her death. For many years prior, the media had portrayed typical drug users as being from broken homes in inner city areas and the &quot;sink&quot; council estates. It was suggested that the pill she had taken was from a &quot;contaminated batch&quot;. Not long afterward, a 1,500-site poster campaign used a photograph of a smiling Leah Betts (not a picture of her on her deathbed, as some sources erroneously claim) with the caption &quot;Sorted: Just one ecstasy tablet took Leah Betts&quot;.

Alternative rock band Chumbawamba responded with their own &#x27;anti-poster&#x27; reading &quot;Distorted: you are just as likely to die from eating a bay leaf as from an ecstasy tablet&quot;.

==Death and inquest==
Betts died on the morning of 16 November 1995, five days after being admitted to hospital, when her life support machine was switched off. Her funeral took place on 1 December 1995 at Christ Church, Latchingdon. She was buried alongside her mother at St. Mary Magdalen church in Great Burstead, Essex.

A subsequent inquest determined that her death was not directly caused by the consumption of ecstasy, but rather the result of the large quantity of water she had consumed. She apparently had been in observation of an advisory warning commonly given to ravers which stated drinking water would help her avoid dehydration as a result of continuous dancing. Leah had been at home with friends and had not been dancing, yet consumed about of water in less than 90 minutes. This resulted in water intoxication and hyponatremia, which in turn led to serious swelling of the brain, irreparably damaging it. 

However, the ecstasy tablet may have reduced her ability to urinate, exacerbating her hyponatremia; a symptom known as SIADH. At the inquest, it was stated by toxicologist John Henry, who had previously warned the public of the danger of MDMA causing death by dehydration, &quot;If Leah had taken the drug alone, she might well have survived. If she had drunk the amount of water alone, she would have survived.&quot;

==Police response==
Essex Police assigned 35 officers and major resources to identifying the suppliers of the tablet Betts had taken. However, after an investigation that cost £300,000, the only people charged were four of her friends who had been present at the house, two of whom accepted police cautions with the other two prosecuted. Of these, one received a conditional discharge, while the other was acquitted after a retrial.

==Subsequent events==
After Betts&#x27;s death, the media focused on the claim that it was the first time she had taken the drug. It was later determined that she had taken the drug at least three times previously. Her father, Paul, subsequently became a vocal public campaigner against drug abuse. He and his wife were present at the press conference at which Barry Legg MP launched his Public Entertainments Licences (Drug Misuse) Bill, which allowed councils to close down licensed venues if the police believed controlled drugs were being used at or near the premises.

It was reported that the £1 million &quot;Sorted&quot; posters campaign was the &quot;pro bono&quot; work of three advertising companies: Booth Lockett and Makin (media buyers), Knight Leech and Delaney (advertising agency), and FFI (youth marketing consultants). Booth Lockett and Makin counted brewers Löwenbräu as one of its major clients, at a time when the alcohol industry saw increasing MDMA use as a threat to profits. The other two companies represented energy drink Red Bull, a professional relationship that had earned Knight Leech and Delaney £5 million and was described by one of FFI&#x27;s executives as such: &quot;We do PR for Red Bull, for example, and we do a lot of clubs. It&#x27;s very popular at the moment because it&#x27;s a substitute for taking ecstasy.&quot;

The December 1995 murder of three alleged drug dealers in Rettendon, an event dubbed the &quot;Range Rover murders&quot;, has been suggested by the media as a potential act of revenge for Betts&#x27;s death.

Furthermore, Bett&#x27;s story served as inspiration for the novel Campos de Fresas by Jordi Sierra i Fabra. Which describes the tale of a Spanish girl, Luciana, age 18, who undergoes a similar story to that of Betts.

<text>Highway 19 is the main north–south thoroughfare on Vancouver Island from Nanaimo to Port Hardy. It forms part of the Island Highway along with Highway 1 and Highway 19A. A highway has existed on the Island since about 1912. Originally gravel and rough, the highway was an essential link together with the Esquimalt &amp; Nanaimo Railway. The paved highway first opened in 1953, replacing a stretch of Highway 1 between Nanaimo and Campbell River, finally being extended to the northern tip of the island in the late 1970s. The total length of the highway is .

==Route description==

=== North Island ===
Highway 19&#x27;s northern end is located at the Bear Cove ferry terminal, across the bay from Port Hardy. The highway proceeds southwest from the ferry dock for to a junction with the main road to the centre of Port Hardy, then turns southeast, travelling for to Highway 30, and then further east for to the main road to Port McNeill. The highway then follows the eastern shore of Nimpkish Lake and the Nimpkish River through a long stretch of dense forest terrain for southeast, until reaching a junction with the community of Woss, then travelling another 65 km east (40 mi), through the boundary between the Regional Districts of Mount Waddington and Strathcona, to a junction with Sayward, and finally entering the city of Campbell River another southeast, at a junction with Highways 28 and 19A, just past the river that the city is named for.

The entire stretch of Highway 19 north of Campbell River is an undivided two-lane configuration. Once at the junction with Highways 28 and 19A, Highway 19 separates into an expressway configuration, built between 1996 and 2001. In Campbell River, the highway shares its northbound lanes with Tamarac Street, and its southbound lanes with Willow Street. 

=== Inland Island Highway ===
The stretch of Highway 19 between Campbell River and the city of Parksville is known as the Inland Island Highway. The highway completely avoids any residential or urban areas and alternates between a divided four-lane expressway and freeway, with a nominal speed limit of and a speed limit near signal lights.

South from Campbell River, Highway 19 is divided primarily by a concrete wall, and goes through a series of six spaced out at-grade signalized intersections, five of them possessing exit numbers. south of Campbell River, Highway 19 reaches its first interchange, with a four-lane arterial highway that goes west to the village of Cumberland and east to the communities of Courtenay and Comox. Past the Courtenay Interchange, Highway 19 is divided by a grass median. later, Highway 19 reaches another interchange, this time with a two-lane road that goes a short distance east to the B.C. Ferry terminal at Buckley Bay. There are two small at-grade signalized intersections on Highway 19 in the between the Buckley Bay Interchange and the interchange with Highway 4, which goes north into Qualicum Beach. later, Highway 19 goes through another interchange, this time with Highway 4A, which goes east into Parksville. The next interchange, at Craig&#x27;s Crossing, is another 5 km south (3 mi) where Highway 19A (Island Highway) rejoins Highway 19 marking the end of the Freeway and the Inland Island Highway.

=== Island Highway ===
Past the Craig&#x27;s Crossing Interchange, Highway 19 resumes its 1953 Island Highway alignment, which today is a 4-lane, divided arterial highway with a concrete median barrier mostly constructed during the 1970s. It heads mostly southeast through the communities of Nanoose Bay and Lantzville passing 5 signal lights and many at grade intersections along the way before finally entering the north part of Nanaimo. The lower highway standards and signal lights require a lower speed limit of on this section of highway. In Nanoose Bay the presence of a particularly busy signal light, multiple residential properties on the highway, a dense cluster of several intersecting side roads, and the lack of a centre divider results in a speed limit.

=== Nanaimo Parkway ===
At the Exit 29 signal lights Highway 19A (Island Highway) once again diverges to follow the 1953 alignment. Highway 19 then veers south onto a long four-lane expressway known as the &quot;Nanaimo Parkway&quot; which opened in 1997. The alignment has five signalized intersections along its length along with 2 overpasses and 4 underpasses for local roads that do not connect to the highway. The only interchange on the Nanaimo Parkway is at its south terminus where a set of ramps bring Highway 19 onto the Highway 1 alignment where both roads continue south. The parkway&#x27;s speed limit is .

During the planning for the Nanaimo Parkway the Ministry of Transportation opted to construct signal lights instead of interchanges at 5 location as a cost saving measure intending on constructing the interchanges later when needed . At the time of its opening the parkway was a major improvement by allowing long distance traffic to bypass Nanaimo, greatly reducing driving times and eliminating congestion in the city. However by 2021 the parkway itself was beginning to have serious congestion issues at the signal lights as a result of the highway being flooded with commuter traffic from a growing Nanaimo. With further growth in traffic expected over the next 30 years the Ministry of Transportation has begun to study the implementation of interchanges on the parkway in the near future.
=== Highway 1 Concurrency ===
After the interchange with Highway 1 and Cedar Road, Highway 19 runs in a short concurrency with Highway 1 (the Trans-Canada Highway) for 2 km (1¼ mi) before exiting at a trumpet interchange on to the Duke Point Highway. With 4 southbound lanes and 3 northbound lanes this short section of freeway is the widest road on Vancouver Island.

=== Duke Point Highway ===
Opened in 1997 the long Duke Point Highway begins as a 4 lane undivided freeway. Highway 19 crosses over the Nanaimo River 2 km (1¼ mi) from Highway 1 and shortly afterwards passes through an interchange at Maughan Rd. The highway then turns northward and narrows to a undivided 3 lane highway (2 lanes westbound and 1 land eastbound) for the last passing two at grade intersections, before finally terminating at the Duke Point Ferry Terminal. There is heavy traffic on the highway for short intervals when ferries are unloading but the rest of the time the Nanaimo bound lanes are virtually empty.

==History==

Highway 19 was first paved and designated in 1953 as an early part of the W.A.C. Bennett administration&#x27;s massive province-wide highway improvement program. The original highway was built mostly built along the same route that Highway 19A follows today and was mostly only 2 lanes wide. It originally only ran from Nanaimo to Campbell River, but has since seen two major extensions. The highway was initially extended north to Kelsey Bay to meet B.C. Ferries&#x27; service to Prince Rupert in 1965 with its official opening being on the 14 September. A sod turning ceremony had been held three years earlier in April 1962 and was officiated by Phil Gaglardi, the Highways Minister. The cost of the extension was $50 million (equivalent to 437.65 million in 2022)

By 1979, the highway was further extended north to Port Hardy, where it now terminates at the Bear Cove ferry terminal. It was officially opened on 21 September 1979 by highways minister Alex Fraser and premier Bill Bennett. With the extension completed, B.C. Ferries moved its southern terminus for the Prince Rupert run north to Port Hardy. Surveying for the extension had started 1970. with the project being fully complete by the summer of 1980. The project cost $65 million (equivalent to $247.89 million in 2022)

=== Vancouver Island Highway Project ===

In the late 1990s and early 2000s, a highway building program called the Vancouver Island Highway Project was initiated to improve the Highway 1 and 19 corridors between Victoria and Campbell River. This project included the construction of the Inland Island Highway, the Nanaimo Parkway and the Duke Point Highway. By early 1996 work was well underway on all sections. 

On October 5, 1996, the first segment of the Inland Island Highway from Mud Bay to Parksville was opened. The Highway 19 designation was soon applied to the new route with the original 1953 highway becoming Highway 19A.On May 31, 1997, the Nanaimo Parkway opened, cutting travel times for drivers going though Nanaimo from 40 minutes to 20 minutes and resulting in Highway 19 being realigned away from Nanaimo&#x27;s downtown, the former route being replaced by another section of Highway 19A. 

Opened in June 1997, the Duke Point Highway connected to BC Ferries&#x27; newest terminal as part of a scheme to remove congestion from the Departure Bay ferry terminal and the surrounding surface streets in Nanaimo&#x27;s core. As a result of this project, Highway 19 was extended another 9 km to its present terminus, making it the only highway in British Columbia to have ferry terminals at both ends.

The remainder of the Inland Island Highway was built in phases over the next 4 years with the Campbell River Bypass opening on September 24, 1997; the Courtenay-Mud Bay link opening on September 25 1999; and the Courtenay-Campbell River expressway, opening on September 8, 2001, completing the project. No significant upgrades or extensions to Highway 19 have occurred since.

== Future ==
Due to the rapid growth of Nanaimo the southern sections of Highway 19 are expected to handle an increasing amount of traffic. The Nanaimo Parkway already experiences heavy congestion during peak hours and congestion is predicted to soon affect sections of Highway 19 north of Nanaimo as well due to dense development planned in Lantzville and the Nanoose Bay area. Congestion largely forms at signal lights as these sections of Highway 19 were not built as a freeway. To address these issues the BC Ministry of Transportation initiated the Nanaimo Parkway and Nanoose Bay Corridor Study. The study was completed in August 2021 and recommended interchanges be constructed to replace signal lights at Jingle Pot Road, Northfield Road and Mostar Road immediately while interchanges at Aulds Road, Highway 19A, Ware Road and Superior Road were recommended to be built within 20 years. A long term bypass and interchange in the Nanoose Bay Area was also proposed by the study.

<text>Collis Potter Huntington (October 22, 1821 – August 13, 1900) was an American industrialist and railway magnate. He was one of the Big Four of western railroading (along with Leland Stanford, Mark Hopkins, and Charles Crocker) who invested in Theodore Judah&#x27;s idea to build the Central Pacific Railroad as part of the first U.S. transcontinental railroad. Huntington helped lead and develop other major interstate lines, such as the Southern Pacific Railroad and the Chesapeake &amp; Ohio Railway (C&amp;O), which he was recruited to help complete. The C&amp;O, completed in 1873, fulfilled a long-held dream of Virginians of a rail link from the James River at Richmond to the Ohio River Valley. The new railroad facilities adjacent to the river there resulted in expansion of the former small town of Guyandotte, West Virginia into part of a new city which was named Huntington in his honor.

Turning attention to the eastern end of the line at Richmond, Huntington directed the C&amp;O&#x27;s Peninsula Extension in 1881–82, which opened a pathway for West Virginia bituminous coal to reach new coal piers on the harbor of Hampton Roads for export shipping. He also is credited with the development of Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company, as well as the incorporation of Newport News, Virginia as a new independent city. After his death, both his nephew Henry E. Huntington and his stepson Archer M. Huntington continued his work at Newport News. All three are considered founding fathers in the community, with local features named in honor of each.

Much of the railroad and industrial development which Collis P. Huntington envisioned and led are still important activities in the early 21st century. The Southern Pacific is now part of the Union Pacific Railroad, and the C&amp;O became part of CSX Transportation, each major U.S. railroad systems. West Virginia coal is still transported by rail to be loaded onto colliers at Hampton Roads. Nearby, Huntington Ingalls Industries operates the massive shipyard at Newport News.

From his base in Washington, Huntington was a lobbyist for the Central Pacific and the Southern Pacific in the 1870s and 1880s. The Big Four had built a powerful political machine, which he had a large role in running. He was generous in providing bribes to politicians and congressmen. Revelation of his misdeeds in 1883 made him one of the most hated railroad men in the country.

Huntington defended himself: 
In 1968, Huntington was inducted into the Hall of Great Westerners of the National Cowboy &amp; Western Heritage Museum.

==Biography==

===Education and early career===
Collis Potter Huntington was born in Harwinton, Connecticut, on October 22, 1821. His family farmed and he grew up helping. In his early teens, he did farm chores and odd jobs for neighbors, saving his earnings. At age 16, he began traveling as a peddler. About this time, he visited rural Newport News in Warwick County, Virginia in his travels as a salesman. He never forgot what he thought was the untapped potential of the area, where the James River emptied into the large harbor of Hampton Roads. In 1842 he and his brother Solon Huntington, of Oneonta, New York, established a successful business in Oneonta, selling general merchandise there until about 1848.

When Huntington saw opportunity in America&#x27;s West, he set out for California. He set up as a merchant in Sacramento at the start of the California Gold Rush. Huntington succeeded in his California business. He teamed up with Mark Hopkins selling miners&#x27; supplies and other hardware.

===Building the first U.S. transcontinental railroad===
In the late 1850s, Huntington and Hopkins joined forces with two other successful businessmen, Leland Stanford and Charles Crocker, to pursue the idea of creating a rail line that would connect America&#x27;s east and west. In 1861, these four businessmen (sometimes referred to as The Big Four) pooled their resources and business acumen, and formed the Central Pacific Railroad company to create the western link of America&#x27;s First transcontinental railroad. Of the four, Huntington had a reputation for being the most ruthless in pursuing the railroad&#x27;s business; he ousted his partner, Stanford.

Huntington negotiated in Washington, D.C., with Grenville Dodge, who was supervising railroad construction from the East, over where the railroads should meet. They completed their agreement in April 1869, deciding to meet at Promontory Summit, Utah. On May 10, 1869, at Promontory, the tracks of the Central Pacific Railroad joined with the tracks of the Union Pacific Railroad, and America had a transcontinental railroad. The joining was celebrated by the driving of the golden spike, provided for the occasion as a gift to the CPRR by San Francisco banker and merchant David Hewes.

===Southern Pacific Railroad===
Beginning in 1865, Huntington was also involved in the establishment of the Southern Pacific Railroad with the Big Four principals of the Central Pacific Railroad. The railroad&#x27;s first locomotive &quot;C. P. Huntington&quot;, (transferred from the CPR), was named in his honor. With rail lines from New Orleans to the Southwest and into California, Southern Pacific expanded to more than 9,000 miles of track. It also controlled 5,000 miles of connecting steamship lines. Using the Southern Pacific Railroad, Huntington endeavored to prevent the port at San Pedro from becoming the main Port of Los Angeles in the Free Harbor Fight.

===Chesapeake and Ohio Railway, new cities and a shipyard===

Following the American Civil War, efforts were renewed in Virginia to complete a canal or railroad link between Richmond and the Ohio River Valley. Before the war, the Virginia Board of Public Works and the Virginia Central Railroad had provided financial assistance to construct a state-owned link through the Blue Ridge Mountains. It had been completed along this route as far as the upper reaches of the Shenandoah Valley when the War broke out.

Officials of the Virginia Central, led by company president Williams Carter Wickham, realized that they would have to get capital from outside the economically devastated South in order to rebuild. They tried to attract British interests, without success. Finally, Major Wickham succeeded in getting Collis Huntington interested helping to complete the line.

Beginning in 1871, Huntington oversaw completion of the newly formed Chesapeake and Ohio Railway (C&amp;O) from Richmond across Virginia and West Virginia to reach the Ohio River. There, with his brother-in-law Delos W. Emmons, he established the planned city of Huntington, West Virginia. He became active in developing the emerging southern West Virginia bituminous coal business for the C&amp;O.

Beginning in 1865, Huntington had been acquiring land in Virginia&#x27;s eastern Tidewater region, an area not served by extant railroads. In 1880, he formed the Old Dominion Land Company and turned these holdings over to it.
Beginning in December 1880, he led the building of the C&amp;O&#x27;s Peninsula Subdivision, which extended from the Church Hill Tunnel in Richmond east down the Virginia Peninsula through Williamsburg to the southeastern end of the Peninsula on the harbor of Hampton Roads in Warwick County, Virginia. Through the new railroad and his land company, coal piers were established at Newport News Point.

It may have taken more than 50 years after Virginia&#x27;s first railroad operated for the lower Peninsula to get a railroad, but once work started, it progressed quickly. In a manner he had previously deployed, notably with the transcontinental railroad, and the line to the Ohio River, work began at both Newport News and Richmond. The crews at each end worked toward each other. The crews met and completed the line 1.25 miles west of Williamsburg on October 16, 1881, although temporary tracks had been installed in some areas to speed completion.

Huntington and his associates had promised they would provide rail service to Yorktown where the United States was celebrating the centennial of the surrender of the British troops under Lord Cornwallis at Yorktown in 1781, an event considered most symbolic of the end of American Revolutionary War. Three days after the last spike ceremony, on October 19, the first passenger train from Newport News took local residents and national officials to the Cornwallis Surrender Centennial Celebration at Yorktown on temporary tracks that were laid from the main line at the new Lee Hall Depot to Yorktown.

No sooner had the tracks to the new coal pier at Newport News been completed in late 1881 than the same construction crews were put to work on what would later be called the Peninsula Subdivision&#x27;s Hampton Branch. It ran easterly about 10 miles into Elizabeth City County toward Hampton and Old Point Comfort, where the U.S. Army base at Fort Monroe guarded the entrance to the harbor of Hampton Roads from the Chesapeake Bay (and the Atlantic Ocean). The tracks were completed about 9 miles to the town which became Phoebus in December 1882, named in honor of its leading citizen, Harrison Phoebus. The new branch line served both the older Hygeia Hotel and the new Hotel Chamberlain, popular destinations for civilians. During the first half of the 20th century, excursion trains were operated to reach nearby Buckroe Beach, where an amusement park was among the attractions for both church groups and vacationers.

At the formerly sleepy little farming community of Newport News Point, Huntington began other, building the landmark Hotel Warwick and founding the Newport News Shipbuilding and Drydock Company. This became the largest privately owned shipyard in the United States.

Huntington is largely credited with vision and the combination of developments which created and built a vibrant and progressive community. The 15 years of rapid growth and development led to the incorporation of Newport News, Virginia as a new independent city in 1896. It is one of only two independent cities in Virginia that were so formed without developing first as an incorporated town.

Near the tracks of the C&amp;O&#x27;s Hampton Branch was a normal school, dedicated in its earliest years to training teachers to educate the South&#x27;s many African-American freedmen after the Civil War and abolition of slavery. Both adults and children were eager to learn. Most southern blacks had been denied opportunities for education literacy before the Civil War. The school which developed to become modern-day Hampton University was first led by former Union General Samuel Chapman Armstrong. Perhaps the best known of General Armstrong&#x27;s students was a youth named Booker T. Washington. He later was hired as principal of Tuskegee Institute in Alabama, another historically black college, and developed it into Tuskegee University. When Sam Armstrong suffered a debilitating paralysis in 1892 while in New York, he returned to Hampton in a private railroad car provided by Huntington, with whom he had collaborated on black education projects.

In the lower Peninsula, Collis and other Huntington family members and their Old Dominion Land Company were involved in many aspects of life and business. They founded schools, museums, libraries and parks among their many contributions. In Williamsburg, Collis&#x27; Old Dominion Land Company owned the historic site of the 18th-century capital buildings. This was transferred to the women who were the earliest promoters of what became Preservation Virginia (formerly known as the Association for the Preservation of Virginia Antiquities). This site was later a key piece of the Abby and John D. Rockefeller Jr.&#x27;s massive restoration of the former colonial capital city. They developed Colonial Williamsburg, one of the world&#x27;s major tourist attractions.
Huntington did not neglect his namesake city at the other end of the C&amp;O. In order to supply freight cars to the C&amp;O, and by extension to the Southern Pacific and Central Pacific Railroads as well, Huntington was a major financier behind Ensign Manufacturing Company. He based the company in Huntington, West Virginia, directly connecting to the C&amp;O; Ensign was incorporated on November 1, 1872.

After Huntington&#x27;s death in 1900, his nephew, Henry E. Huntington, assumed leadership of many of his industrial endeavors. The younger man quickly sold off all of the Southern Pacific holdings. He and other family members also continued and expanded many of the senior Huntington&#x27;s cultural and philanthropic projects, in addition to developing their own.

Historian Howard Jay Graham has summarized Huntington&#x27;s business acumen:Huntington&#x27;s career affords unique opportunity for study of the promoter&#x27;s function—for observing &quot;the entrepreneur as innovator&quot;—hedging into the Central through a cautiously conceived wagon road to the booming Comstock; gaining state and county aid, cost data, experience in construction and finance; thus discovering the immense liberality of the federal subsidy; mobilizing every resource and building through to Ogden on a revolving fund basis; netting perhaps a million by these means; then, half-reluctantly, beginning over, making the C.P. build
the S.P., and when it had, reversing the favorable leases, fattening up the Southern, reaping a second harvest from its bonds and stocks, also taken originally on construction contracts. 

===Death===
Huntington died at his &quot;camp,&quot; Pine Knot, in the Adirondack Mountains on August 13, 1900. He is interred in a Classical-style mausoleum at the Woodlawn Cemetery, Bronx, New York.

==Politics==
In addition to his railroad building, Huntington is best known for his political activity in Washington, D.C., and California. At this stage he was based mostly in New York, and visited California about once a year. Stanford remained president, first of the Central Pacific and then of the Southern Pacific Company, until 1890. Huntington was agent and attorney for the Southern Pacific Railroad, vice-president and general agent for the Central Pacific Railroad, first vice-president of the Southern Pacific Company, and a director of the two lines. His main duties were selling company stocks and bonds and acting as the chief lobbyist in Washington, where his two main challenges were to block federal support for a proposed rival transcontinental route, the Texas and Pacific Railway (in which he succeeded) and to postpone payment of the $28 million in cash loans the government had made to the Central Pacific (in which he did not). He first asked to delay payments for fifty years, then for a hundred years. His proposal to cancel the loans created a firestorm of opposition in California, covered colorfully in the newspapers by Ambrose Bierce; when it was defeated in Congress in 1897, the governor of California celebrated by declaring a public holiday. Huntington lost the battle in Congress in 1899 and the Southern Pacific finally paid off the loans in 1909.

Huntington described his activities in a series of private letters to David D. Colton, a senior financial official of his railroads. After Colton&#x27;s death, litigation opened his files in 1883 and Huntington&#x27;s letters proved a huge embarrassment, with their detailed descriptions of lobbying, payoffs, and bribes to government officials. They showed Huntington to be an active, profane, and cynical promoter of his companies and display his eagerness to use money to bribe congressmen. The letters did not demonstrate that any cash actually changed hands with any official, but they revealed the tenor of Huntington&#x27;s morals.

His biographer says,
According to historian Richard J. Orsi, [Huntington] was an ardent opponent of racial prejudice and discrimination...Huntington had been an abolitionist before the Civil War, and he later donated hundreds of thousands of dollars to support African American churches in California, and schools and colleges in the southern states...Though it was politically unwise, Huntington ordered his companies to give equal employment and pay to black workers, and he publicly opposed the exclusions of black and other non-white children from public schools, as well as other “Jim Crow” restrictions then being enacted in the South and elsewhere. In newspaper columns and public speeches in the West, Huntington praised the Chinese for their culture and industry, and condemned state and federal discrimination against American Indians and Chinese, Filipino, and Japanese immigrants. “If we deny to the individual, no matter what his creed, his color or his nationality, the right to justice which every man possesses,” he told a gathering of California civic and railway leaders in 1900, “there will be no enduring prosperity and [the nation’s] decline will surely follow.

==Family relationships==

Collis Huntington was the son of William and Elizabeth (Vincent) Huntington; born October 22, 1821, in Harwinton, Connecticut. His siblings were:

# Phebe (September 17, 1817 – February 4, 1900); married Henry Pardee of Oneonta, New York.
# Elizabeth (December 19, 1819 – 1903); married Hiram Yaker of Kortright, New York.
# Collis Potter (October 22, 1821 – August 13, 1900)
# Joseph (March 23, 1823 – February 23, 1849); never married
# Susan Lovinia (August 28, 1826 – 1902); married William Porter, M.D., of New Haven, Connecticut
# Ellen Maria (August 12, 1835 – October 22, 1920); married Isaac E. Gates of Orange, New Jersey. She was known as a poet and hymn writer.

Collis Huntington married Elizabeth Stillman Stoddard (1823–1883), of Cornwall, Connecticut, on September 16, 1844. She lived until 1883. They adopted her niece, Clara Elizabeth Prentice, born in Sacramento in 1860. Clara Elizabeth Prentice-Huntington (1860–1928), as she was called, married Prince Franz Edmund Joseph Gabriel Vitus von Hatzfeldt-Wildenburg, a.k.a., Francis Hatzfeldt of the House of Hatzfeld, Germany, on October 28, 1889. They made their home at Draycot House, Draycot Cerne, Wiltshire, England.

Huntington remarried on July 12, 1884, to Arabella D. Worsham (1851–1924). She brought to the marriage her son Archer Milton Worsham, from her first marriage, whom Huntington adopted that year. At fourteen, he became known as Archer Milton Huntington. There were rumors that Huntington had a longer relationship with Arabella and that he was the biological father of her son. Huntington died at his Camp Pine Knot, in the Adirondacks, August 13, 1900.

Archer M. Huntington became a well-known Hispanist and founded The Hispanic Society of America, a museum and rare-books library dedicated to Spanish and Portuguese history, art, and culture, based in upper Manhattan, in New York City. Archer and his second wife, sculptor Anna Hyatt Huntington, founded Brookgreen Gardens sculpture and botanical gardens near Murrells Inlet, South Carolina. He also founded the Mariners&#x27; Museum in Newport News, one of the largest of its kind in the world.

Huntington&#x27;s nephew, Henry E. Huntington (1850–1927), was also a railway magnate and founder of the Huntington Library, Art Collections and Botanical Gardens in San Marino, California. He was active in Los Angeles, California, where he was the main force behind development of the Pacific Electric system.

He was also related to Clarence Huntington, a president of the Virginian Railway who succeeded Urban H. Broughton. He was the son-in-law of the VGN&#x27;s founder, industrialist Henry Huttleston Rogers.

==Charity==
He acquired a substantial collection of art, and was generally recognized as one of the country&#x27;s foremost art collectors. He left most of his collection, valued at $3 million, to the Metropolitan Museum of Art in New York, to pass into the museum&#x27;s hands after the death of his stepson, Archer. His last will directed that if his stepson should die childless (which he did), Huntington&#x27;s Fifth Avenue mansion or the proceeds from the sale of the property would go to Yale University. He also made specific bequests totaling $125,000 to Hampton University (then Hampton Institute) and to the Chapin Home for the Aged.

<doc id="360580" wikidata="Q469638" url="?curid=360580" title="Arnulf I, Count of Flanders">
<text>Arnulf I (/899 – 27 March 964), called &quot;the Great&quot;, was the first Count of Flanders.

==Life==
Arnulf was the son of margrave Baldwin II of Flanders and Ælfthryth of Wessex, daughter of Alfred the Great. Through his mother he was a descendant of the Anglo-Saxon kings of England, and through his father, a descendant of Charlemagne. Presumably Arnulf was named either after Saint Arnulf of Metz, a progenitor of the Carolingian dynasty, or King Arnulf of Carinthia, whom his father supported.

At the death of their father in 918, Arnulf became Count of Flanders while his brother Adeloft or Adelolf succeeded to the County of Boulogne. However, in 933 Adeloft died, and Arnulf took the countship of Boulogne for himself, but later conveyed it to his nephew, Arnulf II. Arnulf titled himself count by the Grace of God.

Arnulf I greatly expanded Flemish rule to the south, taking all or part of Artois, Ponthieu, Amiens, and Ostrevent. He exploited the conflicts between Charles the Simple and Robert I of France, and later those between Louis IV and his barons. Arnulf also made Bruges the center of his administration, contributing to the rise of the town as a major trading hub.

In his southern expansion Arnulf inevitably had conflict with the Normans, who were trying to secure their northern frontier. This led to the 942 murder of the Duke of Normandy, William Longsword, at the hands of Arnulf&#x27;s men. The Viking threat was receding during the later years of Arnulf&#x27;s life, and he turned his attentions to the reform of the Flemish government. When Dunstan, abbot of Glastonbury, fled into exile, Arnulf received him with honour and lodged him in the Abbey of Mont Blandin, near Ghent. 

Count Arnulf died on 27 March 964, allegedly murdered by Heluin in revenge for the murder of William Longsword.

He was buried in the Saint-Peter&#x27;s Abbey in Ghent.

==Family==
The name of Arnulf&#x27;s first wife is unknown but he had at least one daughter by her:

* Name unknown; married Isaac of Cambrai. Their son Arnulf succeeded his father as Count of Cambrai.

In 934 he married Adele of Vermandois, daughter of Herbert II of Vermandois. Their children were:

* Hildegard, born 934, died 990; she married Dirk II, Count of Holland. It is uncertain whether she is his daughter by his first or second wife.
* Liutgard, born in 935, died in 962; married Wichmann IV, Count of Hamaland.
* Egbert, died 953.
* Baldwin III of Flanders ( – 962), married Matilda of Saxony († 1008), daughter of Hermann Billung.
* Elftrude; married Siegfried, Count of Guînes.

==Succession==
Arnulf made his eldest son and heir Baldwin III of Flanders co-ruler in 958, but Baldwin died untimely in 962, so Arnulf was succeeded by Baldwin&#x27;s infant son, Arnulf II of Flanders.

<doc id="360581" wikidata="Q720459" url="?curid=360581" title="Turán graph">
<text>The Turán graph, denoted by formula_1, is a complete multipartite graph; it is formed by partitioning a set of formula_2 vertices into formula_3 subsets, with sizes as equal as possible, and then connecting two vertices by an edge if and only if they belong to different subsets. Where formula_4 and formula_5 are the quotient and remainder of dividing formula_2 by formula_3 (so formula_8), the graph is of the form formula_9, and the number of edges is
:formula_10.

For formula_11, this edge count can be more succinctly stated as formula_12. The graph has formula_5 subsets of size formula_14, and formula_15 subsets of size formula_4; each vertex has degree formula_17 or formula_18. It is a regular graph if formula_2 is divisible by formula_3 (i.e. when formula_21).

==Turán&#x27;s theorem==

Turán graphs are named after Pál Turán, who used them to prove Turán&#x27;s theorem, an important result in extremal graph theory.

By the pigeonhole principle, every set of &quot;r&quot; + 1 vertices in the Turán graph includes two vertices in the same partition subset; therefore, the Turán graph does not contain a clique of size &quot;r&quot; + 1. According to Turán&#x27;s theorem, the Turán graph has the maximum possible number of edges among all (&quot;r&quot; + 1)-clique-free graphs with &quot;n&quot; vertices. show that the Turán graph is also the only (&quot;r&quot; + 1)-clique-free graph of order &quot;n&quot; in which every subset of α&quot;n&quot; vertices spans at least formula_22 edges, if α is sufficiently close to 1. The Erdős–Stone theorem extends Turán&#x27;s theorem by bounding the number of edges in a graph that does not have a fixed Turán graph as a subgraph. Via this theorem, similar bounds in extremal graph theory can be proven for any excluded subgraph, depending on the chromatic number of the subgraph.

==Special cases==

Several choices of the parameter &quot;r&quot; in a Turán graph lead to notable graphs that have been independently studied.

The Turán graph &quot;T&quot;(2&quot;n&quot;,&quot;n&quot;) can be formed by removing a perfect matching from a complete graph &quot;K&quot;2&quot;n&quot;. As showed, this graph has boxicity exactly &quot;n&quot;; it is sometimes known as the &quot;Roberts graph&quot;. This graph is also the 1-skeleton of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional cross-polytope; for instance, the graph &quot;T&quot;(6,3) = &quot;K&quot;2,2,2 is the octahedral graph, the graph of the regular octahedron. If &quot;n&quot; couples go to a party, and each person shakes hands with every person except his or her partner, then this graph describes the set of handshakes that take place; for this reason, it is also called the cocktail party graph.

The Turán graph &quot;T&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,2) is a complete bipartite graph and, when &quot;n&quot; is even, a Moore graph. When &quot;r&quot; is a divisor of &quot;n&quot;, the Turán graph is symmetric and strongly regular, although some authors consider Turán graphs to be a trivial case of strong regularity and therefore exclude them from the definition of a strongly regular graph.

The class of Turán graphs can have exponentially many maximal cliques, meaning this class does not have few cliques. For example, the Turán graph formula_23 has 3&quot;a&quot;2&quot;b&quot; maximal cliques, where
3&quot;a&quot; + 2&quot;b&quot; = &quot;n&quot; and &quot;b&quot; ≤ 2; each maximal clique is formed by choosing one vertex from each partition subset. This is the largest number of maximal cliques possible among all &quot;n&quot;-vertex graphs regardless of the number of edges in the graph; these graphs are sometimes called Moon–Moser graphs.

==Other properties==
Every Turán graph is a cograph; that is, it can be formed from individual vertices by a sequence of disjoint union and complement operations. Specifically, such a sequence can begin by forming each of the independent sets of the Turán graph as a disjoint union of isolated vertices. Then, the overall graph is the complement of the disjoint union of the complements of these independent sets.

 show that the Turán graphs are &quot;chromatically unique&quot;: no other graphs have the same chromatic polynomials. Nikiforov (2005) uses Turán graphs to supply a lower bound for the sum of the &quot;k&quot;th eigenvalues of a graph and its complement.

 develop an efficient algorithm for finding clusters of orthologous groups of genes in genome data, by representing the data as a graph and searching for large Turán subgraphs.

Turán graphs also have some interesting properties related to geometric graph theory. give a lower bound of Ω((&quot;rn&quot;)3/4) on the volume of any three-dimensional grid embedding of the Turán graph. conjectures that the maximum sum of squared distances, among &quot;n&quot; points with unit diameter in R&quot;d&quot;, is attained for a configuration formed by embedding a Turán graph onto the vertices of a regular simplex.

An &quot;n&quot;-vertex graph &quot;G&quot; is a subgraph of a Turán graph &quot;T&quot;(&quot;n&quot;,&quot;r&quot;) if and only if &quot;G&quot; admits an equitable coloring with &quot;r&quot; colors. The partition of the Turán graph into independent sets corresponds to the partition of &quot;G&quot; into color classes. In particular, the Turán graph is the unique maximal &quot;n&quot;-vertex graph with an &quot;r&quot;-color equitable coloring.

Later in his career, Wenner co-founded the Rock and Roll Hall of Fame and founded other publications. As a publisher and media figure, he has faced controversy regarding Hall of Fame eligibility favoritism, the breakdown of his relationship with gonzo journalist Hunter S. Thompson, and criticism that his magazine&#x27;s reviews were biased.

==Early life and education==
Wenner was raised in the San Francisco Bay Area, the son of Sim and Edward Wenner. He grew up in a secular Jewish family.

His parents divorced in 1958, and he and his sisters, Kate and Merlyn, were sent to boarding schools. He completed his secondary education at the Chadwick School in 1963, and went on to attend the University of California, Berkeley. Before dropping out of Berkeley in 1966, Wenner was active in the Free Speech Movement and produced the column &quot;Something&#x27;s Happening&quot; in the student-run newspaper, &quot;The Daily Californian&quot;. Wenner avoided the military draft by providing a letter to the draft board from a Berkeley doctor that diagnosed him with &quot;serious personality disorder...with its concomitant history of psychiatric treatment, suicide ideation, homosexual and excessive heterosexual promiscuity, and heavy use of illegal drugs&quot;.

==Career==
With the help of his mentor, &quot;San Francisco Chronicle&quot; jazz critic Ralph J. Gleason, Wenner landed a job at &quot;Ramparts&quot;, a high-circulation muckraker, where Gleason was a contributing editor and Wenner worked on the magazine&#x27;s spinoff newspaper.

===&quot;Rolling Stone&quot;===
In 1967, Wenner founded &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine in San Francisco. To get the magazine started, Wenner borrowed US$7,500 () from family members and from the family of his soon-to-be wife, Jane Schindelheim.

Throughout the 1970s and 1980s, Wenner played an integral role in popularizing writers such as Hunter S. Thompson, Ben Fong-Torres, Paul Nelson, Greil Marcus, Dave Marsh, Grover Lewis, Timothy Crouse, Timothy Ferris, Joe Klein, Cameron Crowe, Joe Eszterhas, and P.J. O&#x27;Rourke. He also discovered photographer Annie Leibovitz when she was a 21-year-old San Francisco Art Institute student. Many of Wenner&#x27;s proteges, such as Crowe, credit him with giving them their biggest breaks. Tom Wolfe recognized Wenner&#x27;s influence in ensuring that his first novel, &quot;The Bonfire of the Vanities&quot;, was completed: &quot;I was absolutely frozen with fright about getting it done and I decided to serialize it and the only editor crazy enough to do that was Jann.&quot;

In 1977, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; shifted its base of operations from San Francisco to New York City.
The magazine&#x27;s circulation dipped briefly in the late 1970s and early 1980s as &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; responded slowly in covering the emergence of punk rock and again in the 1990s, when it lost ground to &quot;Spin&quot; and &quot;Blender&quot; in coverage of hip hop. Wenner hired former &quot;FHM&quot; editor Ed Needham, who was then replaced by Will Dana, to turn his flagship magazine around, and by 2006, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s circulation was at an all-time high of 1.5 million copies sold every two weeks. In May 2006, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; published its 1,000th edition with a holographic, 3-D cover modeled on The Beatles&#x27; &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot; album cover.

Wenner has been involved in the conducting and writing of many of the magazine&#x27;s &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; Interviews. His interview subjects have included Bill Clinton, Al Gore, John Kerry, and Barack Obama for the magazine during their election campaigns and in November 2005 had an interview with U2 rock star Bono, which focused on music and politics. Wenner&#x27;s interview with Bono received a National Magazine Award nomination.

&quot;Rolling Stone&quot; and Wenner are chronicled in three books, &quot;Gone Crazy and Back Again&quot; by Robert Sam Anson, &quot;Rolling Stone: The Uncensored History&quot; by Robert Draper, and &quot;Sticky Fingers:The Life and Times of Jann Wenner and Rolling Stone Magazine&quot; by Joe Hagan. Robin Green&#x27;s memoir &quot;The Only Girl&quot; covers the time she worked at &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;.

Wenner founded the magazine &quot;Outside&quot; in 1977; where William Randolph Hearst III and Jack Ford both worked before Wenner sold it a year later. He also briefly managed the magazine &quot;Look&quot; and, in 1993, started the magazine &quot;Family Life&quot;. In 1985, he bought a share in &quot;Us Weekly&quot;, followed by a joint purchase of the magazine with The Walt Disney Company the following year. The magazine made the transition from a monthly to a weekly in 2000. In August 2006, Wenner bought out Disney&#x27;s share to consolidate 100% ownership.

From 2004 to 2006, Wenner contributed approximately US$63,000 () to Democratic candidates and liberal organizations.

In September 2016, &quot;Advertising Age&quot; reported that Wenner was in the process of selling a 49% stake in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; to Singaporean company BandLab Technologies. The new investor would have no direct involvement in the editorial content of the magazine. In October 2016, Wenner started publishing Glixel, a video games-based website.

In September 2017, Wenner Media announced that the remaining 51% of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was up for sale. That share was bought by Penske Media Corporation, who later acquired the remaining stake from BandLab.

In 2022, Little, Brown and Company published Wenner&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Like a Rolling Stone&quot;.

==Controversies==
===Hunter S. Thompson===
Hunter S. Thompson was to provide &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; coverage for the 1976 presidential campaign that would appear in a book published by the magazine. Reportedly, as Thompson was waiting for a $75,000 advance check to arrive, he learned that Wenner had canceled the assignment without telling him.

Wenner then asked Thompson to travel to Vietnam to report on what turned out to be the final moments of the Vietnam War. Thompson accepted and arrived with the country in chaos, just as the United States was preparing to evacuate and other journalists were scrambling to find transportation out of the region. Thompson&#x27;s story about the fall of Saigon would not be published in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; until ten years later. Thompson contributed far less frequently to the publication in later years.

===Hootie and the Blowfish review===
In 1996, Wenner fired rock critic Jim DeRogatis after DeRogatis delivered a negative review for an album by the then-popular band Hootie and the Blowfish. Wenner pulled DeRogatis&#x27; review from the magazine. Asked by the &quot;New York Observer&quot; if Wenner was a fan of Hootie and the Blowfish, DeRogatis responded that Wenner &quot;is a fan of any band that sells eight million records.&quot; Wenner fired DeRogatis the next day.

===&quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;===
In June 2017, Wenner cut ties with Joe Hagan, the biographer he commissioned to write his biography, &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot;, calling the book Hagan produced &quot;deeply flawed and tawdry, rather than substantial&quot;. Hagan had been working closely with Wenner on the book since 2013, and &quot;Sticky Fingers&quot; was released in October 2017.

===&quot;New York Times&quot; interview===
In September 2023, Wenner was interviewed by David Marchese of &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; about his book &quot;The Masters: Conversations with Dylan, Lennon, Jagger, Townshend, Garcia, Bono, and Springsteen&quot; and its basis of &quot;seven white guys.&quot; Wenner was asked about the book&#x27;s introduction in which he claimed that black and female artists were &quot;not in his zeitgeist.&quot; In response, Wenner said of female artists that &#x27;none of them were as articulate enough on this intellectual level,&quot; to be included in his list of masterful musicians. Of black artists Marvin Gaye and Curtis Mayfield, he said &quot;they just didn’t articulate at that level&quot;. In response, he was removed from the board of the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame Foundation the day after the interview was published. His comments were widely criticized. He issued an apology statement through his publisher, Little, Brown and Company, on September 18, 2023.

==Personal life==
In the summer of 1967, after &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; was founded, Wenner and Jane Schindelheim were married in a small Jewish ceremony. Wenner and his wife separated in 1995, though Jane Wenner still remains a vice president of Wenner Media. She and Wenner have three sons. One of them, Edward Augustus (Gus), was made head of Wenner Media&#x27;s digital operations in 2014.

Since 1995, Wenner&#x27;s domestic partner has been Matt Nye, a fashion designer. Wenner and Nye have three children born via surrogate mothers.

<text>In graph theory, Turán&#x27;s theorem bounds the number of edges that can be included in an undirected graph that does not have a complete subgraph of a given size. It is one of the central results of extremal graph theory, an area studying the largest or smallest graphs with given properties, and is a special case of the forbidden subgraph problem on the maximum number of edges in a graph that does not have a given subgraph.

An example of an formula_1-vertex graph that does not contain any formula_2-vertex clique formula_3 may be formed by partitioning the set of formula_1 vertices into formula_5 parts of equal or nearly equal size, and connecting two vertices by an edge whenever they belong to two different parts. The resulting graph is the Turán graph formula_6. Turán&#x27;s theorem states that the Turán graph has the largest number of edges among all -free -vertex graphs.

Turán&#x27;s theorem, and the Turán graphs giving its extreme case, were first described and studied by Hungarian mathematician Pál Turán in 1941. The special case of the theorem for triangle-free graphs is known as Mantel&#x27;s theorem; it was stated in 1907 by Willem Mantel, a Dutch mathematician.

==Statement==
Turán&#x27;s theorem states that every graph formula_7 with formula_1 vertices that does not contain formula_3 as a subgraph has at most as many edges as the Turán graph formula_6. For a fixed value of formula_5, this graph hasformula_12edges, using little-o notation. Intuitively, this means that as formula_1 gets larger, the fraction of edges included in formula_6 gets closer and closer to formula_15. Many of the following proofs only give the upper bound of formula_16.

==Proofs==
 list five different proofs of Turán&#x27;s theorem.
Many of the proofs involve reducing to the case where the graph is a complete multipartite graph, and showing that the number of edges is maximized when there are formula_5 parts of size as close as possible to equal.

=== Induction ===
This was Turán&#x27;s original proof. Take a formula_3-free graph on formula_1 vertices with the maximal number of edges. Find a formula_20 (which exists by maximality), and partition the vertices into the set formula_21 of the formula_5 vertices in the formula_20 and the set formula_24 of the formula_25 other vertices.

Now, one can bound edges above as follows:

* There are exactly formula_26 edges within formula_21.
* There are at most formula_28 edges between formula_21 and formula_24, since no vertex in formula_24 can connect to all of formula_21.
* The number of edges within formula_24 is at most the number of edges of formula_34 by the inductive hypothesis.

Adding these bounds gives the result.

=== Maximal Degree Vertex ===
This proof is due to Paul Erdős. Take the vertex formula_35 of largest degree. Consider the set formula_21 of vertices not adjacent to formula_35 and the set formula_24 of vertices adjacent to formula_35.

Now, delete all edges within formula_21 and draw all edges between formula_21 and formula_24. This increases the number of edges by our maximality assumption and keeps the graph formula_3-free. Now, formula_24 is formula_20-free, so the same argument can be repeated on formula_24.

Repeating this argument eventually produces a graph in the same form as a Turán graph, which is a collection of independent sets, with edges between each two vertices from different independent sets. A simple calculation shows that the number of edges of this graph is maximized when all independent set sizes are as close to equal as possible.

=== Complete Multipartite Optimization ===
This proof, as well as the Zykov Symmetrization proof, involve reducing to the case where the graph is a complete multipartite graph, and showing that the number of edges is maximized when there are formula_5 independent sets of size as close as possible to equal. This step can be done as follows:

Let formula_48 be the independent sets of the multipartite graph. Since two vertices have an edge between them if and only if they are not in the same independent set, the number of edges is

formula_49

where the left hand side follows from direct counting, and the right hand side follows from complementary counting. To show the formula_16 bound, applying the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality to the formula_51 term on the right hand side suffices, since formula_52.

To prove the Turán Graph is optimal, one can argue that no two formula_53 differ by more than one in size. In particular, supposing that we have formula_54 for some formula_55, moving one vertex from formula_56 to formula_53 (and adjusting edges accordingly) would increase the value of the sum. This can be seen by examining the changes to either side of the above expression for the number of edges, or by noting that the degree of the moved vertex increases.

=== Lagrangian ===
This proof is due to . They begin by considering a formula_3 free graph with vertices labelled formula_59, and considering maximizing the functionformula_60over all nonnegative formula_61 with sum formula_62. This function is known as the Lagrangian of the graph and its edges.

The idea behind their proof is that if formula_63 are both nonzero while formula_64 are not adjacent in the graph, the functionformula_65is linear in formula_66. Hence, one can either replace formula_67 with either formula_68 or formula_69 without decreasing the value of the function. Hence, there is a point with at most formula_5 nonzero variables where the function is maximized.
Now, the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality gives that the maximal value is at most formula_71. Plugging in formula_72 for all formula_73 gives that the maximal value is at least formula_74, giving the desired bound.

=== Probabilistic Method ===
The key claim in this proof was independently found by Caro and Wei. This proof is due to Noga Alon and Joel Spencer, from their book &quot;The Probabilistic Method&quot;. The proof shows that every graph with degrees formula_75 has an independent set of size at leastformula_76The proof attempts to find such an independent set as follows:
* Consider a random permutation of the vertices of a formula_3-free graph
* Select every vertex that is adjacent to none of the vertices before it.

A vertex of degree formula_78 is included in this with probability formula_79, so this process gives an average of formula_80 vertices in the chosen set.

Applying this fact to the complement graph and bounding the size of the chosen set using the Cauchy–Schwarz inequality proves Turán&#x27;s theorem. See for more.
=== Zykov Symmetrization ===
Aigner and Ziegler call the final one of their five proofs &quot;the most beautiful of them all&quot;. Its origins are unclear, but the approach is often referred to as Zykov Symmetrization as it was used in Zykov&#x27;s proof of a generalization of Turán&#x27;s Theorem . This proof goes by taking a formula_3-free graph, and applying steps to make it more similar to the Turán Graph while increasing edge count.

In particular, given a formula_3-free graph, the following steps are applied:

* If formula_83 are non-adjacent vertices and formula_84 has a higher degree than formula_35, replace formula_35 with a copy of formula_84. Repeat this until all non-adjacent vertices have the same degree.
* If formula_88 are vertices with formula_83 and formula_90 non-adjacent but formula_91 adjacent, then replace both formula_84 and formula_93 with copies of formula_94.

All of these steps keep the graph formula_3 free while increasing the number of edges.

Now, non-adjacency forms an equivalence relation. The equivalence classes give that any maximal graph the same form as a Turán graph. As in the maximal degree vertex proof, a simple calculation shows that the number of edges is maximized when all independent set sizes are as close to equal as possible.

==Mantel&#x27;s theorem==
The special case of Turán&#x27;s theorem for formula_96 is Mantel&#x27;s theorem: The maximum number of edges in an formula_1-vertex triangle-free graph is formula_98 In other words, one must delete nearly half of the edges in formula_99 to obtain a triangle-free graph.

A strengthened form of Mantel&#x27;s theorem states that any Hamiltonian graph with at least formula_100 edges must either be the complete bipartite graph formula_101 or it must be pancyclic: not only does it contain a triangle, it must also contain cycles of all other possible lengths up to the number of vertices in the graph.

Another strengthening of Mantel&#x27;s theorem states that the edges of every formula_1-vertex graph may be covered by at most formula_103 cliques which are either edges or triangles. As a corollary, the graph&#x27;s intersection number (the minimum number of cliques needed to cover all its edges) is at most formula_103.

== Generalizations ==

=== Other Forbidden Subgraphs ===
Turán&#x27;s theorem shows that the largest number of edges in a formula_3-free graph is formula_106. The Erdős–Stone theorem finds the number of edges up to a formula_107 error in all other graphs:(Erdős–Stone) Suppose formula_108 is a graph with chromatic number formula_109. The largest possible number of edges in a graph where formula_108 does not appear as a subgraph isformula_111where the formula_112 constant only depends on formula_108. One can see that the Turán graph formula_114 cannot contain any copies of formula_108, so the Turán graph establishes the lower bound. As a formula_3 has chromatic number formula_117, Turán&#x27;s theorem is the special case in which formula_108 is a formula_3.

The general question of how many edges can be included in a graph without a copy of some formula_108 is the forbidden subgraph problem.

=== Maximizing Other Quantities ===
Another natural extension of Turán&#x27;s theorem is the following question: if a graph has no formula_3s, how many copies of formula_122 can it have? Turán&#x27;s theorem is the case where formula_123. Zykov&#x27;s Theorem answers this question:(Zykov&#x27;s Theorem) The graph on formula_1 vertices with no formula_3s and the largest possible number of formula_122s is the Turán graph formula_6This was first shown by Zykov (1949) using Zykov Symmetrization. Since the Turán Graph contains formula_5 parts with size around formula_129, the number of formula_122s in formula_6 is around formula_132.

A paper by Alon and Shikhelman in 2016 gives the following generalization, which is similar to the Erdos-Stone generalization of Turán&#x27;s theorem:(Alon-Shikhelman, 2016) Let formula_108 be a graph with chromatic number formula_134. The largest possible number of formula_122s in a graph with no copy of formula_108 is

formula_137As in Erdős–Stone, the Turán graph formula_114 attains the desired number of copies of formula_122.

=== Edge-Clique region ===
Turan&#x27;s theorem states that if a graph has edge homomorphism density strictly above formula_140, it has a nonzero number of formula_20s. One could ask the far more general question: if you are given the edge density of a graph, what can you say about the density of formula_20s?

An issue with answering this question is that for a given density, there may be some bound not attained by any graph, but approached by some infinite sequence of graphs. To deal with this, weighted graphs or graphons are often considered. In particular, graphons contain the limit of any infinite sequence of graphs.

For a given edge density formula_78, the construction for the largest formula_20 density is as follows:Take a number of vertices formula_145 approaching infinity. Pick a set of formula_146 of the vertices, and connect two vertices if and only if they are in the chosen set.This gives a formula_20 density of formula_148 The construction for the smallest formula_20 density is as follows:Take a number of vertices approaching infinity. Let formula_66 be the integer such that formula_151. Take a formula_66-partite graph where all parts but the unique smallest part have the same size, and sizes of the parts are chosen such that the total edge density is formula_78.For formula_154, this gives a graph that is formula_155-partite and hence gives no formula_20s.

The lower bound was proven by Razborov (2008) for the case of triangles, and was later generalized to all cliques by Reiher (2016). The upper bound is a consequence of the Kruskal–Katona theorem .

<text>The Livernois–Fenkell riot was a racially motivated riot that occurred in the summer of 1975 on Livernois Avenue at Chalfonte Avenue, just south of Fenkell Avenue, in Detroit, Michigan.

The trouble began on the evening of July 28, when Andrew Chinarian, the 39-year-old white owner of Bolton&#x27;s Bar, observed three black youths tampering with his car in the parking lot. He fired a pistol or rifle, fatally wounding 18-year-old Obie Wynn. According to some accounts, Wynn was fleeing; according to others, he was approaching Chinarian with what the latter thought was a weapon, it later emerged that Wynn was holding a screwdriver. He died from a gunshot wound to the back of the head. Crowds gathered and random acts of vandalism, assault, looting and racial fighting along Livernois and Fenkell avenues ensued. Bottles and rocks were thrown at passing cars. 

The second man killed was Marian Pyszko, a 54-year-old dishwasher and a Nazi concentration camp survivor who had emigrated from Poland in 1958. As he drove home from the bakery/candy factory where he worked, he was pulled from his car by a group of black youths and beaten to death with a piece of concrete. Ronald Bell Jordan, Raymond Peoples, and Dennis Lindsay were all charged with first-degree murder. 

Police were ordered to not use deadly force, so no shots were fired. A crowd of 700 was dispersed by morning. Angry crowds reappeared and violence resumed the following night – a car became a battering ram and a mob ransacked Bolton&#x27;s Bar. 

Detroit mayor Coleman Young defused the disturbance by appearing in person (along with several clergymen) and ordering every black policeman in the city to police the riot.

The damage to property in the Livernois-Fenkell area amounted to tens of thousands of dollars. Fifty-three people were arrested, and ten injuries were recorded (including one firefighter and one police officer). 

CBS News reported an unverified claim that the bar served white patrons only, and noted the 25% unemployment rate as an aggravating factor.

<doc id="360629" wikidata="Q18988" url="?curid=360629" title="Arnulf II, Count of Flanders">
<text>Arnulf II (960/1 – 30 March 987) was Count of Flanders from 965 until his death.

==Life==
He was the son of Baldwin III of Flanders and Matilda of Saxony, countess of Flanders, daughter of Herman, Duke of Saxony. His father Baldwin III died in 962, when Arnulf was just an infant, whilst Arnulf&#x27;s grandfather, Arnulf I, was still alive. When Arnulf I died three years later (965), the regency was held by his kinsman Baldwin Balso, who died in 973.

By the time Arnulf II attained his majority in 976, Flanders had lost some of the southern territory acquired by Arnulf I. The latter had given some parts of Picardy to King Lothar of France to help assure his grandson&#x27;s succession, and gave Boulogne as a fief to another relative. Then early in Arnulf&#x27;s minority Lothar had taken Ponthieu and given it to Hugh Capet, and the first counts of Guînes had established themselves. Arnulf died on 30 March 987 at age 26. Shortly after Arnulf&#x27;s death his widow married King Robert II of France.

==Family==
In 976, he married Rozala of Italy, daughter of Berengar II of Italy, and had two children:
*Baldwin IV (980–1035), who succeeded his father. He married twice and fathered Baldwin V.
* Mathilde, who died before 995.

<text>Noumena is a Finnish melodic death metal band. The band&#x27;s name comes from the word &quot;noumenon&quot;, a philosophical term used by Immanuel Kant. The band consists of five members: vocalist Antti Haapanen, guitarists Tuukka Tuomela and Ville Lamminaho, bass guitarist Hannu Savolainen and drummer Ilkka Unnbom, a lineup they have maintained since their formation. Session member is female vocalist Suvi Uura. Hanna Leinonen and Tuomas Tuominen appear as guest vocalists on Absence and Anatomy of Life.

==History==
Noumena was founded in Ähtäri, Finland in the spring of 1998. In 1999, after two demo tapes and several concerts, the band was given a record deal with a Singaporean record label. Their debut album was recorded later that year at Astia Studio; however, the record label went bankrupt before the album was released. It was not until late 2001 that an Australian label, Catharsis Records, agreed to release the album, given the title &quot;Pride/Fall&quot;.

The following years were unproductive, until, in January 2004, Noumena released a four-track promo. This was moderately successful and led to a deal with Spinefarm Records. The band spent the next October and November making their second album, &quot;Absence&quot;, which was released April 13, 2005. On November 1, 2006 they released &quot;Anatomy of Life&quot; through Spikefarm Records. The album received praise from Metal Maniacs for being, &quot;...another confident step in turning Noumena into Finland’s biggest new export.” Earlier the same year they released the EP &quot;Triumph and Loss&quot; which was only made available online. Currently they have created their own label (Haunted Zoo Production) under which they have launched their last three albums, &quot;Death Walks With Me&quot;, &quot;Myrrys&quot; and &quot;Anima&quot;.

==Music==
The roots of Noumena&#x27;s music are found in the Scandinavian death metal tradition and 1980s heavy metal. Their lyrics often deal with loss, sadness, and darkness. The band has stated on their official page that they try to keep their music &quot;Fresh, Experimental, and Versatile&quot; (&quot;sic&quot;).&quot;

<doc id="360663" wikidata="Q931700" url="?curid=360663" title="Rabbula">
<text>Rabbula () was a bishop of Edessa from 411 to August 435 AD, noteworthy for his opposition to the views of Theodore of Mopsuestia and Nestorius. However, his successor Ibas, who was in charge of the school of Edessa, reversed the official stance of that bishopric. Rabbula is not to be confused with the otherwise unknown scribe of the 6th century Rabbula Gospels. Venerated as a Saint by Eastern Orthodox Church (feast December 20) and Syriac Orthodox Church (feast December 17/19, August 8, and Third Wednesday after The Easter.

== Sources ==
The &quot;Life of Rabbula&quot; is a biographical Syriac text of Rabbula&#x27;s life from the beginning of his birth to his life achievements and ends with his death. The text was first translated from Syriac into English and published by J. J. Overbeck in his &quot;S. Ephraemi Syri Rabulae Episcopi Edesseni Balaei Aliorumque opera selecta&quot; (1865). The Syriac parchment was found stored in the British Museum and is dated to the sixth century AD.

== Early life ==
He was a native of Qinnasrin, ancient Chalcis ad Bellum, a town some few miles south of Aleppo and the seat of a bishopric. His father was a pagan priest, and though his mother was a devoted Christian he remained a pagan until some time after his marriage. During a journey to his country estates he was converted to Christianity partly through coming in contact with a case of miraculous healing and partly through the teaching and influence of Eusebius, bishop of Kenneschrin, and Acacius, bishop of Aleppo.

== Christian asceticism ==
With all the energy of his fiery nature he threw himself into the practice of Christian asceticism, sold all his possessions, and separated from his wife and kinspeople. He resided for some time in a monastery, and then passed to a life of greater hardship as a solitary hermit. On the death of Diogenes, bishop of Edessa, in the year 411-412 Rabbula was chosen his successor, and at once accepted the position offered him, without any of the customary show of reluctance.

As a bishop Rabbula was marked by extraordinary energy, by the continued asceticism of his personal life, by his magnificent provision for all the poor and suffering in his diocese, by his care for discipline among the clergy and monks who were under his authority, and by the fierce determination with which he combated all heresies and especially the growing school of the followers of Nestorius. On one occasion he visited Constantinople and there preached before Theodosius II (who was then favorable to Nestorius) and a great congregation a sermon in denunciation of Nestorian doctrine, of which a portion survives in the Syriac version. Rabbula became a friend of Cyril of Alexandria, with whom he corresponded, and whose treatise &quot;De recta fide&quot; he translated into Syriac. After a 24-year career as bishop, he died in August 435, and was succeeded by Ibas.

It has been argued by some scholars that this positive picture of Rabbula is not altogether accurate. According to the Life of Rabbula, immediately before becoming bishop of Edessa, Rabbula, in consort with another monk, Eusebius, the future bishop of Tella, went to Baalbek (Heliopolis) in Lebanon (&quot;Phoenicia Libanensis&quot;), one of the last areas with pagans in order to seek martyrdom by provoking the pagans. Rather than being killed, he was severely beaten. The Life of Rabbula claims that Rabbula was preserved from death on account of his destiny to hold the episcopate.

== Writings ==
The literary legacy of Rabbula is small in bulk. Perhaps his primary importance to the historian of Syriac literature lies in the zeal with which he strove to replace the &quot;Diatessaron&quot; or &quot;Gospel Harmony of Tatian&quot; with the four canonical Gospels, ordering that a copy of the latter should be placed in every church. The version survives in a British Museum manuscript. According to Overbeck he himself produced a version (or revision) of the New Testament in Syriac, known as the Peshitta. Rabbula&#x27;s involvement may have been, a first step in the direction of the Philoxenian version. FC Burkitt went further and advanced the hypothesis that Rabbula, at least as regards the Gospels, actively helped in the translation of the current Peshitta text, using the Greek text as read in Antioch about 400. However, since then Arthur Vööbus has furnished evidence that the Peshitta predated Rabbula.

Recent research has revealed that the text of the &quot;Evangelion Da-Mepharreshe&quot;, the Gospel text prepared by Rabulla, is indeed the text of the Old Syriac Curetonian Palimpset rather than the Peshitta. Burkitt and Lewis suggested as much by calling the Curetonian Version the &quot;Evangelion Da-Mepharreshe&quot;. As the Peshitta predated Rabbula, this suggests Rabbula had no knowledge of the Gospel text of the Peshitta and prepared his own translation into Syriac from the Greek.

== Veneration ==
Although one can&#x27;t see the Rabbula&#x27;s name in the actual liturgic calendars of Catholic or Orthodox Churches, there is a feast of &quot;Saint Rabbula of Edessa (†436)&quot; under December 20 in the Greek Mineas from IX-XII centuries at the Saint Catherine&#x27;s Monastery of the Mount Sinai. Syriac Orthodox Church celebrates his memory at December 17/19, August 8, and Third Wednesday after The Easter.

<text>Fresnes Prison (&quot;French Centre pénitentiaire de Fresnes&quot;) is the second largest prison in France, located in the town of Fresnes, Val-de-Marne, south of Paris. It comprises a large men&#x27;s prison (&quot;maison d&#x27;arrêt&quot;) of about 1,200 cells, a smaller one for women and a penitentiary hospital.

Fresnes is one of the three main prisons of the Paris area, Fleury-Mérogis (Europe&#x27;s largest prison) and La Santé (located in Paris) being the other two.

==History==
The prison was constructed between 1895 and 1898 according to a design devised by architect Henri Poussin. An example of the so-called &quot;telephone-pole design,&quot; the facility was radically different from previous prisons. At Fresnes prison, for the first time, cell houses extended crosswise from a central corridor. The design was used extensively in 
North America for much of the next century.

During World War II, Fresnes prison was used by the Germans to house captured British SOE agents and members of the French Resistance. Held in horrific conditions, many of these prisoners were tortured, and some died there. As soon as the Allied forces broke through at Normandy and fought their way to liberate Paris, the Gestapo peremptorily killed prisoners at Fresnes. Fresnes Prison was liberated on 24 August 1944 by the French 2nd Armoured Division under General Philippe Leclerc, after a day of heavy fighting with many casualties on both sides.

<doc id="360676" wikidata="Q741372" url="?curid=360676" title="Kobe Airport">
<text>is a primarily domestic airport on an artificial island just off the coast of Kobe, south of Sannomiya Station Japan. Opened on February 16, 2006, it primarily handles domestic flights but will eventually serve international flights to destinations within Taiwan and South Korea, starting in 2025. The airport can also accommodate international charter flights. In the first year of operation (2006), the airport handled 2,697,000 passengers with an average load factor of 61.1%. In 2017, it handled 3,071,974 passengers with an average load factor of 79.4%. In the fiscal year covering April 2022 - March 2023, UKB had a passenger throughput of 3,109,151. The island airport covers just 156 hectares (385 acres) of land.

==History==
The city government of Kobe first proposed an airport adjacent to Port Island in 1971. At the time, government planners were seeking alternatives to the heavily congested Itami Airport: the original Kobe Airport plan called for six runways more than in length on a facility. The mayor of Kobe, Tatsuo Miyazaki, declared his opposition to building such a large airport so close to the city, and was re-elected shortly afterward in 1973, defeating a competitor who supported the airport.

Kobe businesses were still interested in the plan, however, and pressed the city government to propose a smaller facility with one runway. This plan was submitted to the Transport Ministry in 1982 as a competitor for the Kansai International Airport plan which was then being supported by the Osaka and Wakayama prefectural governments. After the national government voiced its displeasure with the Kobe proposal, Kobe officially switched its support to the Kansai Airport proposal in 1984, but in 1985 decided to independently fund the construction of another airport.
The construction of the airport was stalled for lack of funding until 1995, when it won national government support as a means for recovering the Kobe economy in the wake of the Great Hanshin earthquake. Despite ongoing controversy, locals continued to support the plan: in the 1997 mayoral election, the pro-airport coalition won a narrow victory over the anti-airport coalition. Construction began in September 1999 but political controversy continued: 87,000 signatures were collected in a petition to recall the mayor in 2000, and a citizen lawsuit to cancel the project was dismissed in 2004.

The airport finally opened on February 16, 2006, with Japan Airlines operating the first flight and All Nippon Airways operating the first scheduled flight. Both ANA and JAL announced plans to replace portions of their widebody fleet with a larger number of mid-size aircraft, in part because of a need to fill the excess number of flight slots created by Kobe Airport&#x27;s construction. The airport handled its first international business jet flight in September 2006.

As part of its bankruptcy restructuring, JAL terminated all services out of Kobe and closed its office on June 1, 2010, in response to which Skymark Airlines announced a major expansion at the airport. ANA also cut back services following the airport&#x27;s opening. Skymark is currently the dominant carrier at Kobe carrying approximately two-thirds of its passengers.

In 2013, Kobe mayor Tatsuo Yada endorsed a proposal to consolidate the management of the three Kansai region airports by adding Kobe Airport to the planned sale in 2014 of operating concessions at Itami and Kansai.

Kobe was already the most indebted municipality in Japan with debts of over ¥3 trillion after the Great Hanshin earthquake, and this project&#x27;s cost (estimated at over ¥300 billion, or US$3 billion) has made it very controversial. Supporters argue that the third airport can mean increased competition and lower airfares. People in the surrounding regions (Shikoku, Awaji Island etc.) can now have a closer airport while access to Kansai may be limited. Since the ferry from Tokushima to Kansai International Airport was discontinued, travellers have had to rely on alternate means of transportation including a bus to Kansai Airport, which takes an hour longer, or to use the local Tokushima Airport, which is limited in schedules.

On April 1, 2018, Kansai Airports Kobe founded by Orix, Vinci Airports, and Kansai Airports took over the operation of Kobe Airport.

==Airlines and destinations==

Kobe has a single passenger terminal with four gates capable of accommodating widebody aircraft


Some international charter flights also use Kobe Airport. Although the airport&#x27;s runway is not long enough to handle long-range flights to Europe and the Americas, it occasionally handles charters to China and other nearby countries.

The Transport Ministry has capped scheduled domestic operations at 30 daily flights, and has banned international flights with the exception of private aircraft and &quot;own use&quot; charters, in order to prevent overcrowding in the area&#x27;s airspace and to protect the growth of Kansai Airport. The flight caps have been a point of controversy with Kobe Airport supporters, who point out that the cap was calculated based on Kansai Airport operating twice as many frequencies as are currently offered: given the current traffic levels at Kansai, Kobe should be able to handle six or seven flights per hour. The restriction on international charters will be loosened in April 2025 when the international terminal opens. Korean Air, VietJet Air and Starlux Airlines have expressed interest to operate international flights to Kobe when the restriction is loosened.

== Statistics ==

==Ground and water transportation==

On February 2, 2006, Kobe Airport Station was connected to Sannomiya Station in central Kobe by an extension of the existing Port Liner automated guideway transit system, using 2000 series trains as well as some older 8000 series trains (older trains being gradually replaced by newer &quot;2000&quot; ones). Travel time to Sannomiya is 18 minutes. From Sannomiya, it is 21 minutes to Ōsaka Station and 51 minutes to Kyoto Station by JR special rapid express.

Kobe Airport is connected to Kansai Airport by the , a high speed ferry which completes the airport-to-airport journey in 31 minutes for ¥500 for visitors to Japan.

There are bus services to Shin-Kobe Station (on the San&#x27;yō Shinkansen), Sannomiya Station, and Kōbe Station in 25–38 minutes. A single trip to Shin-Kobe Station costs ¥330.

==Accidents and incidents==
* At 14:30 on 31 May 2024, a light aircraft belonging to Hirata Gakuen aviation school landed on the airport runway without its wheels being extended during a touch-and-go landing, forcing the affected runway&#x27;s closure and the cancellation of 34 flights. None of the three people aboard the plane were injured.

<doc id="360677" wikidata="Q7261685" url="?curid=360677" title="Purée Mongole">
<text>Purée Mongole, also called Cream Mongole, is a creamed split pea-tomato soup of unknown origin; a recipe for it was printed in 1889. Popular during the period between the 1920s–1940s, it is similar to Boula which is made with turtle soup.

Purée Mongole is usually made with carrots, onions, white turnips, leeks, a stock (either beef or chicken) and milk. Depending on the recipe, it can have julienne carrots and be seasoned with curry powder, ground cloves, turmeric, nutmeg, cumin, and basil, in addition to salt and pepper. Simplified recipes printed in many vintage cookbooks, including the 1946 edition of the &quot;Joy of Cooking&quot;, used canned, condensed pea and tomato soups as a base with additional vegetables and seasonings.

<doc id="360682" wikidata="Q514198" url="?curid=360682" title="Smooth breathing">
<text>The smooth breathing (; &quot;psilí&quot;; ) is a diacritical mark used in polytonic orthography. In Ancient Greek, it marks the absence of the voiceless glottal fricative from the beginning of a word.

Some authorities have interpreted it as representing a glottal stop, but a final vowel at the end of a word is regularly elided (removed) when the following word starts with a vowel and elision would not happen if the second word began with a glottal stop (or any other form of stop consonant). In his &quot;Vox Graeca&quot;, W. Sidney Allen accordingly regards the glottal stop interpretation as &quot;highly improbable&quot;.

The smooth breathing mark ( ) is written as on top of one initial vowel, on top of the second vowel of a diphthong or to the left of a capital and also, in certain editions, on the first of a pair of rhos. It did not occur on an initial upsilon, which always has rough breathing (thus the early name &quot;hy&quot;, rather than &quot;y&quot;) except in certain pre-Koine dialects which had lost aspiration much earlier. 

The smooth breathing was kept in the traditional polytonic orthography even after the sound had disappeared from the language in Hellenistic times. It has been dropped in the modern monotonic orthography.

==History==
The origin of the sign is thought to be the right-hand half ( ┤ ) of the letter H, which was used in some archaic Greek alphabets as while in others it was used for the vowel eta. It was developed by Aristophanes of Byzantium to help readers discern between similar words. For example, ὅρος &quot;horos&quot; &#x27;boundary&#x27; (rough breathing) and ὄρος &quot;oros&quot; &#x27;mountain&#x27; (smooth breathing). In medieval and modern script, it takes the form of a closing half moon (reverse C) or a closing single quotation mark:
* 
&lt;/DIV &gt;

Smooth breathings were also used in the early Cyrillic and Glagolitic alphabets when writing the Old Church Slavonic language. Today it is used in Church Slavonic according to a simple rule: if a word starts with a vowel, the vowel has a psili over it. From the Russian writing system, it was eliminated by Peter the Great during his alphabet and font-style reform (1707). All other Cyrillic-based modern writing systems are based on the Petrine script, so they have never had the smooth breathing.

==Coronis==
The coronis (, &quot;korōnís&quot;, &quot;crow&#x27;s beak&quot; or &quot;bent mark&quot;), the symbol written over a vowel contracted by crasis, was originally an apostrophe after the letter: . In present use, its appearances in Ancient Greek are written over the medial vowel with the smooth breathing mark——and appearances of crasis in modern Greek are not marked.

== Letters with smooth breathing mark==

==Unicode==
In Unicode, the code points assigned to the smooth breathing are for Greek and for Cyrillic. The pair of space + spiritus lenis is . The coronis is assigned two distinct code points, and .

<text>The A47 is a major trunk road in England linking Birmingham to Lowestoft, Suffolk, maintained and operated by National Highways. Most of the section between Birmingham and Nuneaton is now classified as the B4114. From Peterborough eastwards, it is a trunk road (sections west of the A1 road have been downgraded as alternative roads have been built).

==History==

The original (1923) route of the A47 was Birmingham to Great Yarmouth, but there were some changes made to its route in the early years.
At its eastern end, the A47 originally ran through Filby and Caister-on-Sea, with the Acle Straight bearing the number B1140.

A change took place in 1925. The original route of the A47 between Guyhirn and Wisbech in the Isle of Ely was via Wisbech St Mary, with the direct route being part of the A141. This is because there was no road bridge over the River Nene at Guyhirn, and hence no junction between the A47 and the A141. In April 1925 a steel road bridge was opened, and the A47 and the A141 swapped routes between Guyhirn and Wisbech.

The A47 was rerouted along the Acle Straight in 1935, with the old route being renumbered as the A1064 (Acle to Caister-on-Sea) and part of the A149 (Caister to Great Yarmouth). Another change also dates from 1935. The A47 originally ran via Downham Market, not King&#x27;s Lynn. In 1935, it was rerouted via King&#x27;s Lynn, replacing part of the A141 (Wisbech to King&#x27;s Lynn) and part of the A17 (King&#x27;s Lynn to Swaffham). The old route via Downham Market was renumbered as the A1122 (Outwell to Swaffham) and part of the A1101 (Wisbech to Outwell).

Major improvements were made from the late 1970s until early in the 1990s. The 7 mile (11.3 km) £5 million part-dual-carriageway East Dereham Bypass built on part of the disused railway line was opened in spring 1978 followed by a five-mile (8 km) part-dual-carriageway Swaffham Bypass, costing £5 million which was opened in June 1981. Bypasses for Uppingham (£1.4 million) and Blofield (£4 million) were opened in 1982 and 1983 respectively. The southern section of the Great Yarmouth Western Bypass was opened in May 1985 and the northern section in March 1986 at a cost of £19 million followed by improvements to the one mile (1.6 km) Postwick-Blofield section (£1.2 million) which was opened in November 1987. In 1989 Acle Bypass was completed as a cost of £7.1 million and the £1.2 million East Norton Bypass was opened in December 1990. The three mile (4.8 km) £9 million East Dereham-North Tuddenham Improvement opened in August 1992 and the £62 million Norwich southern Bypass in September 1992.

Escalating road protests starting with Twyford Down in 1992 and culminating with the Newbury bypass in 1996 (at which over 1,000 people were arrested) led to over 300 road schemes being cancelled in November 1995 and to the cancellation of further schemes including the Thorney bypass by the new Labour government in 1997.

In 2002 the government announced a new road building programme which included the three mile (4.8 km) dual-carriageway Thorney bypass which opened on 14 December 2005.

In February 2017 Highways England (now National Highways) re-designated the stretch of the A12 road between Great Yarmouth and Lowestoft as the A47.

==Proposed improvements==
===Acle Straight (New Road)===
A study on the A47 which concluded in 2001 looked at improving New Road, i.e. the section of the A47 between Acle and Great Yarmouth known as the Acle Straight. The improvement of the Acle Straight has become a point of contention between interested parties due to its passage through the Norfolk Broads, an area of important ecological and conservation significance that limits development. The study which recommended widening rather than dualling of the Acle Straight was opposed by the Broadland District Council, Great Yarmouth Borough Council, Norfolk Police Authority and the majority of local respondents who believed that dualling of the road is necessary to improve road safety, decrease journey time and support the economic development of Great Yarmouth. Dualling was however strongly opposed by the Environment Agency, the Council for National Parks (CNP) and the Broads Authority due to its impact on biodiversity and internationally important wildlife sites. These parties did cautiously support further investigation into the option for widening following further investigation of its environmental impact.

===Acle Straight safety improvement scheme===
In 2006 a programme of safety improvement for the Acle Straight were announced. This would include road resurfacing, better road markings, improved visibility and the installation of safety cameras at an estimated total cost of £1.6 million. The result would then be monitored while long-term improvements, such as widening, are considered. 

===Norwich Northern Distributor Road===

A £117 million road scheme to the north of Norwich, linking the A1067 and Norwich International Airport to the A47, sponsored and managed by Norfolk County Council. It was priority scheme for Norfolk County Council and it attracted strong opposition both locally and from environmental groups. On 2 June 2015 the scheme was given the go ahead, in 2017 parts of the road were opened with the complete road opened in early 2018.

===Norwich Western Link===
A scheme to connect the A47 at Easton with the A1067 at Attlebridge at the end of the Norwich Northern Distributor Road.

===North Tuddenham-Easton and Blofield-North Burlingham dualling===
The two stretches of dual carriageway west and east of Norwich respectively are planned to be dualled by 2027. Although a Development Consent Order (DCO) was granted in 2022, both schemes were subject to legal challenge which have since been dismissed. This caused the overall scheme to be delayed by 20 months. Work began on the North Tuddenham to Easton leg in 19 August 2024 and is due to be finished in 2027.

===Other proposed improvements===
In 2012 Norfolk County Council launched the strategic route prospectus which detailed improvement schemes along the A47 between Peterborough and King&#x27;s Lynn. The list of improvements, costing a total £526 million, included dualling sections of the road and other junction improvements. The sections of the road to be dualled were the Acle straight, Blofield to Burlingham, North Tuddenham to Easton and the East Winch/Middleton bypass. Other improvements detailed were four schemes at Great Yarmouth, including a £112 million third river crossing, four junction improvements along the Norwich Southern Bypass and improvements to the three junctions at King&#x27;s Lynn.

On 8 October 2012 it was the announced that improvements to the A1/A47 junction at Wansford and the roundabout at Honingham would be approved for pinch point funding. On 1 December 2014 it was announced that a package of improvements to the A47 worth a total of £300 million would be funded during the 2015-20 parliament. 
==Route==
===Birmingham===
The Birmingham end of the A47 starts one mile from the centre of Birmingham at the junction with the A4540 Middleway. The traffic light controlled junction was laid out in 2018–19 following the infilling of the Ashted Circus roundabout. The road runs north-east through Vauxhall as Nechells Parkway and then Saltley Road. (Historically it started in the City Centre on High Street.) The road continues north east following the Cross Country Route and River Rea as first Heartlands Parkway and then Fort Parkway. The Birmingham section of the road terminates at Spitfire Island, a roundabout on the A452 halfway between the M6 Junction 5 and A38 Tyburn Island.

The route between Birmingham and Nuneaton was known as the A47 until 1986, when it was renumbered, mainly as the B4114, following the completion of the M42.

===Nuneaton – Leicester===

At Nuneaton the road re-emerges as Hinckley Road from a junction with the A444, near the railway station. Leaving Nuneaton, it passes the North Warwickshire and South Leicestershire College, meets the A4254 at a roundabout and the A5 Watling Street near the Longshoot Hotel. It follows the A5 for a half-mile entering Leicestershire and the district of Hinckley and Bosworth, then leaves at a roundabout to bypass Hinckley to the north as Dodwells Road then Normandy Way which was completed in the summer of 1994. This section passes through a large industrial estate and close to a Tesco distribution centre, crossing the Ashby-de-la-Zouch Canal. It meets a roundabout near the Triumph motorbike factory. It bypasses Earl Shilton on its southern side as a single carriageway road. It then runs through Leicester Forest on a line parallel with the M69. It enters Leicester Forest East crossing the M1 near the service station and continues on into the City of Leicester at the B5380 junction. The road continues into the city centre crossing the A563 outer ring-road before becoming part of the inner ring road.

===Leicester – A1===

Leaving Leicester the road becomes &quot;Humberstone Road&quot;, then &quot;Uppingham Road&quot;. It passes under the Midland Main Line and meets the B6146 &quot;St Barnabas Road&quot; to the south, then passes over the former Leicester Belgrave Road to Peterborough North section of the Great Northern Railway which follows the road as far as Houghton on the Hill. At the A6030 crossroads, it becomes part of the Leicester outer ring road in North Evington. At Humberstone, beyond the A563 (outer ring road) and &quot;Goodwood Road&quot; (projected extension of the outer ring road) crossroads, the road meets the B667 &quot;Spencefield Lane&quot; to the south, for Evington. Between the &quot;Downing Drive&quot; junction and Thurnby Hill it enters Leicestershire and the district of Harborough. At Thurnby it meets &quot;Station Road&quot; to the north, for Scraptoft. Leaving Bushby it climbs Winkadale Hill into the countryside.
The road travels through Houghton on the Hill, with crossroads for Leicester Airport (to the south) and Old Ingarsby (to the north) next to the &quot;Rose and Crown&quot; and JET &quot;Houghton Garage&quot;, and heads down Palace Hill with a right turn for Gaulby, a left turn for Tilton on the Hill, then crosses the River Sence. The two-mile £2.5 million three-lane Billesdon Bypass opened in October 1986, passing north of the village, with staggered crossroads. It meets the B6047 north-south Market Harborough to Melton Mowbray road (for Tilton on the Hill) at staggered crossroads at the highest point of the A47, at around 670 feet. It passes through Skeffington with a right turn for Rolleston then heads through Tugby, which is traversed by the Midshires Way and National Cycle Route 63. It winds its way towards the one-kilometre £1.2 million East Norton Bypass, which opened in December 1990, passing south of the village, with a left turn for Loddington and right turn for Hallaton. Leaving the village, after rejoining the former route, it passes the former railway station. It heads down a hill as three lanes and crosses the Eye Brook and from here the next ten miles are in Rutland, and three lanes become two.
There is a left turn for Belton-in-Rutland and a right turn for Allexton (in Leicestershire) where the road is crossed by the Leicestershire Round and Macmillan Way. The two-mile £1.9 million Wardley Hill Improvement opened in October 1987, and there is a right turn (only) for Wardley, where the road is crossed by the Rutland Round. The road improvement took a less-crooked route closer to the village, with a less steep incline avoiding the top of Wardley Hill. The one-and-a-half-mile £1.4 million Uppingham Bypass opened in June 1982, taking a shorter route north of the town, which is the home of Uppingham School. It meets the A6003 (for Oakham) at a roundabout, and meets the former &quot;Glaston Road&quot; route and crossroads for Bisbrooke, to the south. It passes through Glaston, with crossroads for Wing (to the north) and Seaton (to the south) near the &quot;Old Pheasant&quot;. It passes over the tunnel of the Oakham to Kettering Line. Entering Morcott it passes Redwings Lodge, a former Travelodge, and a new cafe restaurant, the Country Lounge originally a Little Chef, on the left and there is a left turn for Morcott, where the road is crossed by the Rutland Round. It meets the A6121 (for Stamford) and B672 (for Caldecott) where it crosses a tunnel of a former railway. At a right turn for Barrowden there is Morcott Windmill, and the road is again crossed by the Rutland Round. There is a crossroads for South Luffenham and Barrowden.
From Shire Oaks (Coppice Leys) through Tixover, the road has been straightened, and to the right is the Welland Valley (Rutland – Northamptonshire boundary). At Tixover there is a crossroads, where the Rutland Round follows the road to the east. The road crosses the River Welland, where the Jurassic Way crosses the road. The Duddington Bypass, where the road enters the district of North Northamptonshire, opened in 1975. This section has a busy roundabout where it meets the south-west/north-east corridor A43. On the northern edge of Collyweston Great Wood, it meets &quot;Kingscliffe Road&quot; for Collyweston, at the west gate of RAF Wittering. It follows the perimeter fence of the airfield to &quot;Collyweston Cross Roads&quot; (now no longer crossroads due to the airfield), where there is a right turn for Kings Cliffe. The woodland here is the northern edge of the historic Rockingham Forest. The road towards Wittering Lodge has been straightened, and crosses the City of Peterborough boundary (former Northamptonshire, then Cambridgeshire). At Toll Bar Cottage, there is a left turn for Wittering, opposite Bedford Purlieus National Nature Reserve. The road meets the A1.

===A1 – Kings Lynn===
The road formerly went through Wansford, further to the south. The £250,000 dual-carriageway Wansford North Bypass opened in January 1965. There is a right-turn for Sutton. It is crossed by the Roman road Ermine Street. The dual-carriageway £9 million Ailsworth-Castor Bypass opened in September 1991. Around Peterborough, the Peterborough Longthorpe Grade separated junction (GSJ) opened in December 1987 where it meets the A1260. There is a GSJ for Bretton and a Sainsbury&#x27;s, and it passes the Peterborough City Hospital. The £1.2 million Peterborough Westwood GSJ opened in January 1987 near Ravensthorpe. This section of road is called the &quot;Soke Parkway&quot; (named after the Soke of Peterborough). When this was first built, in the mid-1970s, the A47 followed what is now the A15 &quot;Paston Parkway&quot;.

It crosses the East Coast Main Line and meets the A15 at New England near to a Morrisons (former Safeway), and Boulevard and Brotherhood retail parks at Walton to the north and New England to the south. There is another GSJ near Paston to the north and it meets the other strand of the A15 at a GSJ near Gunthorpe. It meets the southern terminus of the new A16 alignment before meeting the A1139 at a roundabout and crossing the Car Dyke. The £7.2 million Eye Bypass opened as &quot;Eye Road&quot; in October 1991, diverting traffic from the &quot;Paston Parkway&quot;, and partly built on the former Peterborough to Wisbech railway. There is a local access roundabout at Eye Green near the Esso &quot;Eye Green Service Station&quot;, a Travelodge and the Peterborough Eye former Little Chef on the right, where it becomes &quot;Thorney Road&quot;, &quot;The Causeway&quot;. The landscape becomes very flat known as The Fens. A dual-carriageway bypass of Thorney opened on 14 December 2005. The road meets the B1040 and B1167 at roundabouts. Near Thorney Toll, the road enters Cambridgeshire and the district of Fenland near the &quot;New Toll Service Station&quot;. The straight road finishes at Guyhirn, meeting the B1187 and crossing on the Tiddy Mun bridge and following the River Nene and the Nene Way. The £3.7 million Guyhirn Diversion opened in October 1990. The road heads north-east, following the east bank of the River Nene. The £6 million Wisbech/West Walton Bypass opened in autumn 1984. The former route leaves as the B198 at a roundabout. It meets a level crossing, and it enters Norfolk and the district of King&#x27;s Lynn and West Norfolk just before a roundabout with the A1101 for Elm and Emneth at the Elme Hall Hotel. It passes the Total &quot;Wisbech Services&quot; and then meets the old route (B198) at a roundabout and becomes the £23 million dual-carriageway Walpole Highway/Tilney High End Bypass which opened in summer 1996. There is an exit for Walpole Highway, and another for Terrington St John. It passes near Tilney High End. Near Tilney All Saints, it meets the old route at a roundabout, becoming the single carriageway &quot;Main Road&quot;, then &quot;Pullover Road&quot;. It meets the end of the A17 at the &quot;Pullover Roundabout&quot; where the West Lynn Little Chef is located.

===King&#x27;s Lynn – Great Yarmouth===

Nearing King&#x27;s Lynn, the dual carriageway crosses over the River Great Ouse and Fen Rivers Way footpath. Construction of the King&#x27;s Lynn southern bypass, built by W. &amp; C. French at a cost of £3,733,000, began on 5 April 1972 and was completed in 1975. It meets the A148 road at a grade-separated junction known as the Saddlebow interchange. The A10 and the A149 terminate at the Hardwick Flyover (opened on 30 October 2003) near the Hardwick Industrial Estate (formerly home of Campbell&#x27;s Soup). After this junction it becomes Constitution Hill until the turn off for North Runcton; then Lynn Road, where in Middleton it passes the Grade II listed former lodge to Middleton Hall, &#x27;The Old Lodge&#x27;, the former Crown public house and St Mary&#x27;s church.

Next is East Winch, where it passes All Saints&#x27;s church, then West Bilney where it passes St Cecilia&#x27;s church. Soon after, the former Lynn and Dereham Railway line is crossed, followed by a right-turn for Pentney, and the B1153 for East Walton. The half-mile Narborough Bypass, opened in November 1992, where the road crosses the River Nar and enters the district of Breckland. There is a straight section to where it meets the A1122 (for RAF Marham) at a roundabout at the start of the five-mile part-dual-carriageway Swaffham Bypass, which opened in June 1981. There is an exit for Swaffham, and a grade-separated junction with the A1065 (for Fakenham).

It passes some wind turbines and there is a roundabout where it joins the former route just before it is crossed by the Peddars Way. There is a left turn for Sporle and it passes Necton then heads north-west through Little Fransham, passing the &quot;Canary and Linnet&quot;, with a left turn for Crane&#x27;s Corner. The seven-mile £5 million part-dual-carriageway East Dereham Bypass opened in spring 1978, which was built on part of the disused railway line. It passes near Wendling and St Peter and St Paul church then meets the B1146 (for Dereham) and A1075 (for Shipdham) near a Tesco supermarket and B1135. The B1147 leaves for Swanton Morley. The three-mile £9 million East Dereham-North Tuddenham Improvement opened in August 1992, which passes North Tuddenham. It bypasses Hockering. It enters the district of Broadland at the start of the bypass of Honingham, where it crosses the River Tud. Just before the roundabout at Easton, it enters the district of South Norfolk.

==== Norwich Southern Bypass ====
The dual-carriageway £62 million Norwich Bypass opened in September 1992. At the &quot;Longwater&quot; Intersection, the A1074 follows the former route through Norwich near the Longwater Retail Park and Sainsbury&#x27;s. Near Bawburgh, it crosses the River Yare. There is a GSJ with the B1108, for Little Melton and Colney. At Cringleford, it meets the A11 at the Thickthorn Interchange and &quot;Thickthorn Services&quot; and crosses the Breckland Line. Near Keswick Hall, it meets the A140 at a GSJ at Harford Bridge, south of Norwich, near a Tesco, then crosses the Great Eastern Main Line. It is crossed by Boudica&#x27;s Way, then meets the A146 at a GSJ. It crosses the River Yare again at the &quot;Postwick Viaduct&quot; and enters the district of Broadland. 

==== Postwick Viaduct to Great Yarmouth ====
It crosses the Wherry Line and meets the A1042 at a GSJ. The section from the end of this bypass to Blofield, the one-mile £1.2 million Postwick-Blofield Dualling, was opened in November 1987. There is a left turn to Great Plumstead. The one-mile £4 million dual-carriageway Blofield Bypass opened in February 1983, which starts at a roundabout for Brundall. It becomes single carriageway and passes North Burlingham near the staggered &quot;White House&quot; crossroads with the B1140. The three-mile £7.1 million dual-carriageway Acle Bypass opened in March 1989, which ends at a roundabout with the A1048 near a Travelodge, becoming the single carriageway &quot;New Road&quot;. From Acle, the road enters the Acle Straight which is nearly seven miles of straight and level single carriageway to Great Yarmouth, with just one curve at Road House Diner. The road is notorious for congestion, especially during the holiday season, and also for the number of accidents, which due to the drainage ditches on either side of the road are often fatal, and demands for dualling have been heard for many years, although there are no current plans to go ahead with this. It enters the district of Great Yarmouth, then passes close to Breydon Water. The northern section of the two-mile £19 million Great Yarmouth Western Bypass (A47) opened in March 1986, and the southern section opened in May 1995.

===Great Yarmouth - Lowestoft===
From the Acle Straight, the A47 meets the Vauxhall Roundabout in Great Yarmouth where it intersects with the A149. The A47 follows a route south across Breydon Bridge which spans the estuary where the Rivers Yare and Bure meet Breydon Water. It meets at the Gapton Hall Roundabout, which intersects with the A1243. The route continues South, meeting with the Harfrey&#x27;s Roundabout, which connects the A47 to Great Yarmouth&#x27;s Herring Bridge. From there the A47 is formed of the Gorleston Bypass, a 2.6KM stretch of dual carriageway with a single slip-road connecting it to Gorleston via the A143. After this, a small section of the A47 runs south past the regions main A&amp;E, the James Paget University Hospital. Approx 5.5 KM of dual carriageway then takes the A47 to North Lowestoft, which connects the A47 to the coastal villages of Hopton and Corton via 3 roundabouts. The A47 enters Suffolk as its route heads south into Lowestoft, along restricted 30MPH roads. As the A47 intersects with the A1144 in the centre of Lowestoft, it branches off into two routes. The main A47 branches past the towns docks, where it enters a section of 3 lanes controlled by lane tidal flow lights, which predetermine which of the three lanes is open for north or southbound travel over the bascule bridge. The secondary A47 branches through the centre of the town, passing Lowestoft Railway Station and meeting the main A47 by the docks just before the bridge. The A47 then terminates at the Bascule Bridge, where the A12 begins.

==Transit service==
* Between Leicester and Uppingham, the A47 is serviced by bus route 747 Uppingham–Leicester.
* First Eastern Counties &#x27;Coastlink&#x27; services X1 &amp; X11 follows much of the A47 between Norwich and Great Yarmouth, with the X1 continuing to Lowestoft for most of its journeys, and the X11 terminating at Belton.

First Eastern Counties run an &#x27;Excel&#x27; service, with 4 branded routes - A, B, C and D, which primarily serve population centres along the A47, with some routes going as far as Peterborough.

<doc id="360694" wikidata="Q3837616" url="?curid=360694" title="Louis Rossetto">
<text>Louis Rossetto is an American writer, editor, and entrepreneur. He is best known as the founder and former editor-in-chief / publisher of &quot;Wired&quot; magazine&quot;.&quot; He was also the first investor and the former CEO of TCHO chocolate company.

==Personal life==
Louis Rossetto was born and grew up on Long Island, New York in an Italian-American family.
He went to Columbia University as an undergraduate, graduating in 1971, and later returned for an MBA, graduating in 1973. 
Rossetto is life-partners with Jane Metcalfe and they have two children.

==Professional life==
===1970s &amp; 1980s===
In 1971, while a senior in college, he appeared on the cover of the &quot;New York Times Sunday Magazine&quot; as co-author with Stan Lehr of &quot;Libertarianism, The New Right Credo,&quot; one of the first articles about the emerging Libertarian movement. In 1974, he wrote a novel called &quot;Take-Over&quot;, released by controversial publisher Lyle Stuart. &quot;Take-Over&quot; posited a counterfactual history: instead of resigning during the Watergate crisis, Richard Nixon launched a coup d&#x27;état. In 1976, Rossetto ghost edited a new journalism book called &quot;Ultimate Porno&quot; about the making of &quot;Penthouse&quot; publisher Bob Guccione&#x27;s film Caligula.

In 1985, he joined CBC reporter Richard Evans to report on the Afghanistan war for ABC News. Rossetto&#x27;s subsequent articles for the &quot;Christian Science Monitor&quot; and newsweeklies &quot;Elseviers&quot; in the Netherlands and &quot;Panorama&quot; in Italy were among the first to pinpoint the war&#x27;s turning point, when the mujahideen first put the Russians on the defensive that was ultimately to push them out of Afghanistan.

In 1986, Rossetto joined the staff of Amsterdam-based INK Taalservice, a high-tech translation company serving the new PC industry. INK launched an English-language magazine with Rossetto as editor called &quot;Language Technology&quot;, which covered the burgeoning the technologies used to process language — from PCs to machine translation to networks. The first issue of &quot;Language Technology&quot; was designed by leading edge Dutch graphic designer Max Kisman, and was the first issue of any magazine to be created with desktop publishing software, in this case ReadySetGo, which Rossetto had carried back from its introduction at that year&#x27;s San Francisco MacWorld exhibition. During his time at &quot;Language Technology&quot;, Rossetto was a consultant to the European Community on language industry issues.

In 1986, Rossetto&#x27;s life partner Jane Metcalfe joined as the magazine&#x27;s ad sales director. INK later sold the magazine to a small Dutch media company Media Nederland, who renamed it &quot;Electric Word&quot;. &quot;Electric Word&quot; &#x27;s circulation grew to include leading research labs at universities, governments, and high tech companies around the world. Cover subjects were as diverse as computer visionary Alan Kay, AI pioneer Marvin Minsky, Timothy Leary, and MIT Media Lab founder Nicholas Negroponte. The magazine was later sold to a small Dutch media company and renamed &quot;Electric Word&quot;. &quot;Whole Earth Review editor Kevin Kelley proclaimed Electric Word &quot;the least boring computer magazine in the world,&quot; which became its tagline.

At Media Nederland, Rossetto also became launch editor of its glossy, general interest monthly magazine O. When Electric Word was terminated in 1990 due to Media Nederland&#x27;s change of focus, Rossetto left with Jane Metcalfe to write the business plan for &quot;Wired&quot;. The last issue of &quot;Electric Word&quot; featured the world&#x27;s first Photoshopped magazine cover — of TED founder Richard Saul Wurman.

===1990s===
In 1991, Rossetto and his partner Jane Metcalfe resettled in the US to raise capital for &quot;Wired&quot;. They launched the magazine on a shoestring budget in January 1993, with art director John Plunkett, executive editor Kevin Kelly, and managing editor John Battelle.

&quot;Wired&quot; was greatly admired for its bold design and its coverage of &quot;digital culture&quot;. The magazine exuded a counterculture ethos—and was even compared to &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as a barometer of the zeitgeist of the era. Its often deliberately provocative editorial reflected Rossetto&#x27;s beliefs in a far-reaching &quot;digital revolution&quot; based on global consciousness and networked markets. Under Rossetto&#x27;s five years as editor, the magazine won two National Magazine Awards for General Excellence and one National Magazine Award for Design.

In October 1994, Wired Ventures became an Internet pioneer when it launched the first Web site with original content and Fortune 500 advertising called HotWired. HotWired then proceeded to launch dozens of other Web sites, including Webmonkey and the search engine Hotbot. Hotwired employees Joey Anuff and Carl Steadman launched the first weblog Suck.com.

After HotWired, Wired expanded into books with HardWired and television with Wired TV. By 1996, it had Japanese and British editions, and was actively planning a German edition, as well as new business and design magazines.

Wired Venture&#x27;s rapid expansion forced it in 1996 to turn to an IPO for financing. But after failing to take the company public as scheduled during what turned out to be a severe stock market downturn that summer, Rossetto and Metcalfe were forced to accept Providence Equity as financial partners in early 1997. By the summer of 1997, four years after launch, &quot;Wired&quot; magazine was solidly profitable. Its three-year-old online business, now renamed Wired Digital, was not. It was Wired Digital&#x27;s cash needs which Providence used to wrest control of the company from Rossetto and Metcalfe in April 1997.

Despite Wired Ventures becoming cash-flow positive in May 1998, Providence sold off its assets. The company that Rossetto and Metcalfe began in 1991 with $30,000 was sold in pieces for $380 million. Condé Nast bought the now 500,000-circulation &quot;Wired&quot; magazine, and Lycos bought Wired Digital.

===2000s &amp; 2010s===
Since Wired, Rossetto has mostly avoided the public eye. He assisted with a 2001 redesign of &quot;Reason Magazine&quot; and defended the invasion of Iraq in its pages. He pursued disparate individual projects through his and Metcalfe&#x27;s family holding company, Força da Imaginaçao. One was a large residential real estate project in Walnut Creek, California. Another was a 2006 investment in innovative, ultra-premium chocolate company, TCHO.

Rossetto was TCHO&#x27;s CEO and CCO from 2007 to 2014. TCHO was known for its award-winning, flavor-focused chocolate and for pioneering TCHOSource program which transferred technology and expertise to partner growers in Peru, Ecuador, and Ghana.

In 2013, Rossetto and Metcalfe were honored by the Reason Foundation, a libertarian think tank, with the Lanny Friedlander Prize for having &quot;created a publication, medium, or distribution platform that vastly expands human freedom by increasing our ability to express ourselves, engage in debate, and generate new ways of understanding.&quot;

In 2015, Rossetto and Metcalfe were honored with a Webby Lifetime Achievement Award. Their five word acceptance speech: &quot;Remember, it&#x27;s all just prelude.&quot;

In 2017, Rossetto published &quot;Change is Good&quot;, an original novel about &quot;the creation myth of the Digital Generation — a week in the lives of five Gen Xers and one millennial at ground zero of the Internet Revolution in South of Market, San Francisco, as it mutates into the dotcom bubble.&quot; The book is designed by Erik Spiekermann, and published by Spiekermann&#x27;s p98a in Berlin. It will be the first book published with Spiekerman&#x27;s new letterpress printing process.

<doc id="360700" wikidata="Q194316" url="?curid=360700" title="Suvarnabhumi Airport">
<text>Suvarnabhumi International Airport is the main international airport serving Bangkok, the capital of Thailand. Located mostly in Racha Thewa subdistrict, Bang Phli district, Samut Prakan province, it covers an area of , making it one of the biggest international airports in Southeast Asia and a regional hub for aviation. The airport is also a major Cargo Air Freight Hub (20th busiest in 2019), which has a designated Airport Free Zone, as well as road links to the Eastern Economic Corridor (EEC) on Motorway 7.

==Etymology==
The name &quot;Suvarnabhumi&quot; is Sanskrit for &quot;land of gold&quot; (Devanagari:सुवर्णभूमि : &quot;Suvarṇabhūmi&quot;; &quot;Suvarṇa&quot; is &quot;gold&quot;, &quot;Bhūmi&quot; is &#x27;land&#x27;; literally &quot;golden land&quot;). The name was chosen by the late King Bhumibol Adulyadej whose name includes &quot;Bhūmi&quot;, referring to the Buddhist golden kingdom, thought to have been to the east of the Ganges, possibly somewhere in Southeast Asia. In Thailand, government proclamations and national museums insist that Suvarnabhumi was somewhere on the coast of the central plains, near the ancient city of U Thong, which might be the origin of the Indianised Dvaravati culture. Although the claims have not been substantiated, the Thai government named the new Bangkok airport Suvarnabhumi Airport, in celebration of this tradition.

==History==
The airport is currently the main hub for Thai Airways International and Bangkok Airways, as well as the operating base for Thai VietJet Air and Thai AirAsia. It also serves as a regional gateway and connecting point for various foreign carriers connecting to Asia, Oceania, Europe, and Africa.

Suvarnabhumi was officially opened for limited domestic flight service on 15 September 2006, and opened for most domestic and all international commercial flights on 28 September 2006.

The airport is on what had formerly been known as Nong Nguhao () in Racha Thewa in Bang Phli, Samut Prakan province, as well as the districts of Bang Kapi, Lat Krabang, Bang Na, and Prawet in the eastern side of Bangkok, about from downtown. The terminal building was designed by Helmut Jahn of Murphy/Jahn Architects. It was constructed primarily by ITO JV. The airport had the world&#x27;s tallest free-standing control tower () from 2006 to 2014 and the world&#x27;s fourth largest single-building airport terminal ().

Suvarnabhumi is the 17th busiest airport in the world, eleventh busiest airport in Asia, and the busiest in the country, having handled 60 million passengers in 2017, and is also a major air cargo hub, with a total of 95 airlines. On social networks, Suvarnabhumi was the world&#x27;s most popular site for taking Instagram photographs in 2012.

Suvarnabhumi reassigned the IATA airport code, BKK, from Don Mueang after that airport ceased international commercial flights. Motorway 7 connects the airport, Bangkok, and the heavily industrial eastern seaboard of Thailand, where most export manufacturing takes place.
During the COVID-19 pandemic, the airport was temporarily converted to a hospital and vaccination center.

===Land purchase, initial early phase of construction===
The need for the new airport was recognized in 1973 when of land was purchased east of Bangkok. The site, known as Cobra Swamp, was drained and named Suvarnabhumi, meaning &quot;realm of gold&quot;. On 14 October 1973, student-led protests led to the overthrow of the military government of Prime Minister Thanom Kittikachorn and the project was shelved.

 &quot;The Japanese government would end up assisting the new airport project as ODA, and in 1996, the project took a step forward with the signing of a loan agreement between the Government of Thailand and the Japanese government. Then, in 1996, Second Bangkok International Airport Company Ltd. (SBIA) was established as the project implementation organization, and the project got underway.&quot;

It was scheduled to finish by 2000.

===Airport tests and official opening===
The airport was due to open in late 2004. Still, a series of budget overruns, construction flaws, and allegations of corruption plagued the project.

A further delay was caused by the discovery that the airport had been built over an old graveyard. Superstitious construction workers claimed to have seen ghosts there. On 23 September 2005, the Thai airport authority held a ceremony where 99 Buddhist monks chanted to appease the spirits.

Full tests of the airport took place on 3 and 29 July 2006. Six local airlines — Thai Airways International, Nok Air, Thai AirAsia, Bangkok Airways, PBair, and One-Two-Go Airlines — used the airport as a base for twenty domestic flights. The first international test flights were conducted on 1 September 2006. Two Thai Airways aircraft, a Boeing 747-400 and an Airbus A300-600, simultaneously departed the airport at 09:19 to Singapore and Hong Kong respectively. At 15:50 the same aircraft flew back and made simultaneous touchdowns on runways 19L and 19R. These test flights demonstrated the readiness of the airport to handle traffic.

On 15 September 2006, the airport started limited daily operations with Jetstar Asia operating three Singapore to Bangkok flights. Bangkok Airways moved to the airport on 21 September. AirAsia and Thai AirAsia followed on 25 September and on 26 September Nok Air moved to Suvarnabhumi Airport. During this initial phase, as well as in the previous tests, the airport used the temporary IATA code NBK.

Suvarnabhumi officially opened at 03:00 on 28 September 2006, taking over all flights from Don Mueang. The first flight to arrive was a Lufthansa Cargo flight LH8442 from Mumbai at 03:05. The first commercial arrival was Japan Airlines at 03:30. The first passenger arrival was Aerosvit flight VV171 from Kyiv at 04:30, and the first cargo departure was Saudi Arabian Airlines flight SV-984 to Riyadh at 05:00. Aerosvit also had the first passenger departure (VV172 to Kyiv) around 05:30.

===Initial difficulties===
Difficulties were reported in the first few days of the airport&#x27;s operation. On the first day alone, sluggish luggage handling was common—the first passenger arrival by Aerosvit took an hour for the luggage to start coming out, and some flights did not have their luggage coming out even after four hours. Flights were delayed (Thai Airways claimed that 17 of 19 flights were delayed that day), and there were failures with the check-in system. Subsequent problems included the failure of the cargo computer system, and the departure boards displaying the wrong information, resulting in confused passengers (especially as unlike Don Mueang, there were no &quot;final calls&quot; issued).

Months after its opening, issues of congestion, construction quality, signage, provision of facilities, and soil subsidence continued to plague the project, prompting calls to reopen Don Mueang to allow for repairs to be made. Expert opinions varied widely on the extent of Suvarnabhumi&#x27;s problems as well as their root cause. Most airlines stated that damage to the airport was minimal. Then Prime Minister Surayud Chulanont reopened Don Mueang for domestic flights voluntarily on 16 February 2007, with 71 weekly flights moved back initially, but no international flights.

===Capacity and safety issues===

====Tarmac problems====
In January 2007, ruts were discovered in the runways at Suvarnabhumi. The east runway was scheduled to close for repairs. Expert opinions varied as to the cause of the ruts. Airport authorities and airline representatives maintained that the airport was still safe and resisted suggestions that the airport should be completely closed and all flights moved back to Don Mueang.

On 27 January 2007, the Department of Civil Aviation declined to renew the airport&#x27;s safety certificate, which had expired the previous day. The ICAO requires that international airports hold aerodrome safety certificates, but Suvarnabhumi continued to operate because the ICAO requirement had yet to be adopted as part of Thai law.

As of early 2016, tarmac problems persisted at Suvarnabhumi. Soft spots on the tarmac, taxiways, and apron area had not been permanently fixed. Aircraft were getting stuck on the soft surfaces that are the result of sub-standard materials. &quot;The constant resurfacing of the tarmac, taxiways and apron area with asphalt is an unacceptable patchwork solution. We literally need a &quot;concrete&quot; solution&quot;, said Tony Tyler, IATA&#x27;s director general and CEO.

====Plans to re-open Don Mueang for domestic flights====

In January 2007, Thai Airways announced a plan to move some of its domestic operations back to Don Mueang International Airport due to overcrowding. Three days later, the Ministry of Transport recommended temporarily reopening Don Mueang while repair work on the runways at Suvarnabhumi proceeded. At that time, Thai Airways said it would shift most of its domestic flights back to Don Mueang while keeping flights with high international passenger connections such as Chiang Mai and Phuket at Suvarnabhumi. On 28 March 2009, Thai Airways discontinued all domestic flights from Don Mueang. Bangkok Airways and One-Two-GO Airlines had similar plans, but Bangkok Airways remained at Suvarnabhumi. Thai AirAsia said it would not move unless it could shift both its international and domestic operations, prompting them to stay at Suvarnabhumi for the time being. Nok Air and PBair were undecided, but Nok Air later relocated all flights to Don Mueang, where they operate today. As of January 2010, only Nok Air and One-Two-GO operated domestic flights from Don Mueang Airport. PBair have ceased operations altogether. One-Two-GO was integrated into Orient Thai Airlines in July 2010, but continued to operate from Don Mueang Airport until liquidation in 2018.
As of 1 October 2012, Air Asia has moved all of its Bangkok operations to Don Mueang International Airport (DMK) from Suvarnabhumi Airport (BKK).

====Repair and upgrades====
Airports of Thailand found that the cost of fixing 60 identified problems at the airport would be less than one percent of the total airline cost and the problems could be fixed in up to four to five years. Dr Narupol Chaiyut, a member of a committee overseeing service problems at the new airport, estimated that 70 percent of the problems would be fixed in 2007. Twenty of the 60 problems were successfully fixed by February 2007.

==Architectural design==
Suvarnabhumi Airport&#x27;s main terminal roof is designed with structural elements and bays placed in a cantilevered, wavelike form to appear to &quot;float&quot; over the concourse beneath. This overall design principle was to express the former essence of the site, from which water had to be drained before construction could begin. The eight composite 2,710-ton trusses supporting the canopy of the main terminal are essentially diagrams of the bending moments acting on them, with the greatest depth at mid-span and over the supports.

The result of Helmut Jahn&#x27;s vision is a structure with performance materials serve in their total composition and in use more than in their conventional roles. This maximizes daylight use in comfort with substantial energy life-cycle cost savings. The installed cooling system reduced up to 50 percent compared to a conventional system. A translucent membrane with three layers was developed to mediate between the interior and exterior climate, dealing with noise and temperature transmission, while still allowing natural flow of daylight into building along with views of greenery outside.

==Airport ranking==

The airport was ranked number 48 among the world&#x27;s top 100 airports in 2020. Other ASEAN airports in 2020 were ranked: Changi Airport, 1; Kuala Lumpur International Airport, 63; Jakarta–Soekarno-Hatta, 35; Hanoi, 87. Suvarnabhumi was ranked 46 in 2019, 38 in 2017 and 36 in 2016. According to the Thailand Development Research Institute (TDRI) in 2018, the airport&#x27;s ranking had not improved over the past six years. Customer complaints included lengthy immigration waiting times, transit day room issues, insufficient numbers of chairs and phone charging points, insufficient English-speaking staff, and poor information displays.

As of 18 April 2024, the airport was ranked 58th by the Skytrax World Airport Awards 2024.

==Events==
*On 25 January 2007, due to work upgrading the taxiways which suffered from small cracks, a few incoming flights were delayed and several flights were safely diverted to U-Tapao International Airport in Rayong Province.

*On 26 November 2008, an illegal occupation of the airport took place by People&#x27;s Alliance for Democracy, closing the departure lounge and blocking exits and leaving almost 3,000 passengers stranded in the main terminal and another 350,000 stranded inside the country, as all flights were grounded. The People&#x27;s Alliance for Democracy seized the control tower at 12:00. On 2 December 2008, protesters agreed to leave the airport as they had been illegally protesting and permitted the resumption of flights. Security checks, clean-ups, and re-certification once the illegal occupation ended delayed the airport from being fully functional until 5 December 2008.

*On 5 January 2019, the airport gained international attention when a Saudi Arabian ex-Muslim, Rahaf Mohammed, fleeing an abusive family that punished children who did not follow their religion, was accosted by Thai authorities at the behest of Saudi Arabia and sent to one of the airport&#x27;s hotels to await repatriation back to her family and country. Fearing that she could be killed for being a disgrace to her family and religion, she barricaded herself in the hotel room, opened a Twitter account to plead for her freedom, and requested assistance from United Nations agents to get her to the Western world, away from her family, as a resettled refugee. As her pleas for help went viral, Thai agents agreed to let her go to Canada to start a new life without Islam.

*In January 2021, a motorist drove his car through security gates and onto the tarmac at the airport while it was in use. It was later revealed that the driver had been under the influence of methamphetamine, which was also discovered in the trunk of the car. The driver claimed that he had taken a wrong turn.

==Predatory irregularities==
Petty thieves and confidence men, the majority of them illegal taxi drivers or tour guides, are known to prey on tourists in the arrival hall. They belong to politically well connected criminal groups: Kamnan Samruay, Boonruang Srisang, Sak Pakphanang, the Pattaya Mafia and Phuyai Daeng. Evicting them has proved difficult as they allegedly are well connected. (The head of the Pirap gang is supposedly related to an Airports of Thailand executive, while the Phuyai Daeng has ties to influential civil servants in Samut Prakan.)

On 1 October 2010, two hundred armed men occupied the airport&#x27;s parking area for an hour, blocking the building&#x27;s entrances and seizing ticket booths to collect fares from motorists. Airport security personnel failed to respond, reportedly because of an internal dispute within the parking management company, the firm contracted to run the parking facilities.

==Airport terminal and future expansion==

===Airport terminal===
Costing an estimated 155 billion baht (US$5 billion), the airport has three parallel runways (60 m wide, 4,000 m and 3,700 m long) and two parallel taxiways to accommodate simultaneous departures and arrivals. It has a total of 120 parking bays (51 with contact gates and 69 remote gates), with five of these capable of accommodating the Airbus A380. Suvarnabhumi Airport has 72 jet bridges and 69 non-jet bridges. Additionally, flights are able to park at remote locations on the ramp, from which airport buses transport passengers to and from the terminal. Suvarnabhumi Airport has 18 jet bridges and 6 non-jet bridges for Airbus A380.

The airport&#x27;s first two runways can accommodate 64 flights per hour. At peak times the runways average 63 flights per hour. In April 2019 the Thai cabinet approved a sum of 21.8 billion baht for the construction of a third runway. Construction was originally planned to start in 2019 and was completed in 2024 due to delays. The third runway (in phased trials) will accommodate a maximum of 30 flights per hour.

The main passenger terminal building, with a capacity of handling 76 flight operations per hour, co-locates the international and domestic terminals, though assigning them to different parts of the concourse. In the initial phase of construction, it was capable of handling 45 million passengers and three million tonnes of cargo per year. Above the underground rail link station and in front of the passenger terminal building is a 600-room hotel operated by Accor under the Novotel brand.
The airport&#x27;s main passenger terminal was, at the time of construction, the world&#x27;s largest passenger terminal ever constructed in one phase at . The airport air-traffic control tower was the tallest in the world at from 2006 to 2014.

From the opening of Suvarnabhumi in 2006 to early 2017, eight people had fallen to their deaths from upper-floor walkways, prompting the airport to spend 33 million baht in 2013 building glass barriers to prevent people from falling and/or taking their lives.


===Expansion plans===
By mid-2015, the airport was handling more than 800 flights per day, higher than its 600-flight capacity. It has exceeded its capacity of 45 million passengers per year.

Airports of Thailand (AOT) approved an investment budget for the expansion of Suvarnabhumi Airport and construction was expected to be completed by April 2023. The plan was to strengthen Suvarnabhumi Airport&#x27;s position as a regional aviation hub. Phase Two would raise the airport&#x27;s capacity to 65 million passengers a year and would be undertaken in parallel with the construction of a new domestic terminal. The new domestic terminal will be intended to accommodate more than 30 million passengers annually.

The two expansion projects are part of the overall airport enlargement that would see Suvarnabhumi raise its annual passenger handling capacity to 125 million passengers, 90 million international and 35 million domestic passengers by 2024 at an estimated cost of 163 billion baht (US$5.25 billion/€3.62 billion). The expansion includes the construction of one additional runway of , subsequent enlargement of domestic and international terminals, and improvements to parking bays, car parks, and other airport infrastructure.

In March 2024 Prime Minister Srettha Thavisin said the third runway would open in October 2024, with a long-term target capacity of 150 million passengers. The runway was opened for full aircraft operations on 1 November 2024, increasing the operational capacity from 68 to 94 flights/hour.

==== Midfield Satellite Concourse 1 (SAT-1) ====

A new midfield concourse called SAT-1 partially opened in September 2023 and is expected to fully open from early 2024. It is linked to the current main terminal via an underground automated people mover (APM) system. The new people mover was provided by Siemens using the NeoVAL technology. The new satellite terminal has a total of 28 gates, with eight for the Airbus A380 and Boeing B747-800 super jumbo jet. Spanning around 251,400 square meters, it will increase the airport&#x27;s annual passenger handling capacity from 45 million to 60 million. The SAT-1 terminal was nominated as one of six airport terminals for the Prix Versailles World&#x27;s Most Beautiful Airports Architectural Award for 2024, which was announced at UNESCO.

===Traffic by calendar year===
Suvarnabhumi accounted for the largest share of air traffic at Thailand&#x27;s airports in 2023, handling 51.7 million passengers in 2023, up by 80 percent from the previous year despite its passenger capacity of only 45 million a year.


==Incidents and accidents==
*8 September 2013: Thai Airways International Flight 679, an Airbus A330-300, (HS-TEF, &quot;Song Dao&quot;), arriving from Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport (CAN) had a runway excursion from runway 19L while landing in heavy rain with extensive damage to the airplane and the runway. The aircraft was evacuated using the emergency slides with only minor injuries among the 288 passengers and 14 crew members. Preliminary investigation determined the cause of the accident to be the right landing gear collapsing as a result of a damaged bogie. In the aftermath of the accident, Thai Airways had the logos of the aircraft painted over in black, prompting widespread criticism of attempted cover-up. An airline official initially said that the practice was part of the &quot;crisis communication rule&quot; recommended by Star Alliance. This was denied by the group, and Thai Airways later clarified that the &quot;de-identifying&quot; of aircraft was its own practice and not Star Alliance policy. The controversy prompted discussion over the appropriateness and effectiveness of the practice as a brand-protection policy. The aircraft was damaged beyond repair and written off as a hull loss. The airframe has since been converted to a roadside attraction called Airways Land, featuring a cafe and event space, on Mittraphap Road in Sida District, Nakhon Ratchasima Province.
*1 August 2016: Thai Regional Airline Flight 106, a Piper PA-31 Navajo (HS-FGB) arriving from Nakhon Ratchasima Airport with two passengers, crashed at Lam Phak Chi, Nong Chok district, Bangkok. In the incident, there was one fatality (the captain in command) and four injuries.
*8 October 2018: Thai Airways International Flight 679, a Boeing 747-400 (HS-TGF, &quot;Sri Ubon&quot;) arriving from Guangzhou Baiyun International Airport (CAN), China, had a runway excursion from runway 19R while landing, causing damage to the airplane. No injuries were reported. As of January 2020, the aircraft is being repaired at U-Tapao International Airport.
*1 July 2020: A Boeing 767-200 (Z-WPF) flight UM462 with two passengers and 17 crew from Air Zimbabwe made an emergency landing because the left engine had shut down.
*21 May 2024: Singapore Airlines Flight 321, a Boeing 777-300ER (9V-SWM), was en route from London Heathrow to Singapore Changi where the flight encountered severe turbulence over Myaungmya District, Myanmar, resulting in one death and over 100 injuries. The aircraft was diverted.

==Ground transportation==

===Airport Rail Link (ARL)===


The 30 billion baht Suvarnabhumi Airport Link was opened on 23 August 2010, after multiple delays. The Airport Rail Link (ARL) is operated by SRTET, a subsidiary company of the State Railway of Thailand. The standard gauge line is long and is elevated for most of its length, running mostly above existing regional railway lines and parallel to Motorway 7 and Si Rat Expressway. There is a short at-grade/underground segment as the line approaches the passenger terminal building of Suvarnabhumi Airport.

The ARL Station is located on the underground floor of Suvarnabhumi Airport, which also links to the Airports&#x27; Novotel Hotel adjacent to the main terminal.

The ARL hours of service are 06:00 to 00:00. The ARL has two interchange stations, namely Phaya Thai (changing for BTS Green Line services) and Makkasan (linking Phetchaburi station of the MRT Blue Line). In the future, the ARL will complement the SRT Red Line commuter service, which comprises two-meter gauge, dual-track lines. The ARL may also be extended from Phaya Thai to Don Mueang via Bang Sue Grand Station, given that the old Don Mueang International Airport has now been reopened for civil aviation under a dual-airport policy.

===Regional train===

Meanwhile, SRT provides a suburban commuter train service between Lad Krabang (the nearest station to Suvarnabhumi on the East line, one station from the airport by Airport Rail Link) and the northern suburban city of Rangsit via downtown Bangkok and the old Don Mueang Airport. The train also connects with BTS and MRT at Phaya Thai and Phetchaburi stations respectively. A shuttle bus service linking the airport with Hua Takhe railway station is provided by BMTA. The train service is currently not as popular as the bus service because it requires a shuttle bus connection. The service will be stopped when the Airport Express Link is completed.

===Bus===

Northeast of the airport is Suvarnabhumi Public Transport Center, which is the airport&#x27;s main bus terminal.

A free bus service connecting Suvarnabhumi Airport and Don Mueang Airport operates from 05.00 until midnight. Three air-conditioned city bus routes operated by Bangkok Mass Transit Authority (BMTA) serve the airport&#x27;s dedicated bus terminal. There are also direct buses between the airports operated by an airport shuttle bus.

===Taxi===
Level 1 (ground level) is where the public taxis are located. A ticket printed from the ticket queue machine (located on the same floor) is required before queuing up for a taxi.

===Car===
The airport has five main access routes. Among these the most convenient route is via the Bangkok Chon Buri Motorway (Motorway 7). Another main airport entrance is in Samut Prakan Province via the expressway from Bang Na to Bang Pakong.

The airport has seven different car park zones, with zones 2 and 3 having direct access to the departure/arrival terminal. Located northeast of the airport is the Longterm Car Park Zone, next to the Bus Terminal.

The airport has five entrance routes. The main route is via the motorway in the north of Bangkok, directly connecting Bangkok&#x27;s downtown and Chonburi Province, the industrial and harbor city in eastern Thailand. However, another main airport entrance is in Samut Prakan Province, connecting an elevated highway in the south of Bangkok from Bang Na to Bang Pakong.

== Sky Lane Cycle Track ==
In December 2015, Airports of Thailand introduced the Sky Lane (), a cycling track around the Suvarnabhumi airport perimeter. The entrance to the Sky Lane is located in the northeastern corner of the airport area. Cyclists can bring their bicycles and bike here for free. The Sky Lane is a controlled-access, one-direction, two-lane track built only for cycling, so the riders can be ensured that they will not be bothered by any vehicle. The Sky Lane&#x27;s length is 23.5 km, making it the longest in Asia. Sky Lane&#x27;s facilities, which are specially designed for cyclists, include medical facilities, shops, food &amp; beverage, track, parking lot and a rest area. The entrance gate is open from 06:00 to 18:00.
On 23 November 2018, King Rama X presided over the official opening of cycling lane at Suvarnabhumi airport and denominated the track as Happy and Healthy Bike Lane ().

<text>Baldwin IV (980 – 30 May 1035), called the Bearded, was the count of Flanders from 987 until his death.

Baldwin IV was the son of Count Arnulf II of Flanders (c. 961 — 987) and Rozala of Italy (950/60 – 1003), of the House of Ivrea. He succeeded his father as Count of Flanders in 987, but with his mother Rozala as the regent until his majority.

In contrast to his predecessors Baldwin turned his attention eastward, leaving the southern part of his territory in the hands of his vassals the counts of Guînes, Hesdin, and St. Pol. To the north of the county Baldwin was given Zeeland as a fief by the Holy Roman Emperor Henry II, while on the right bank of the Scheldt river he received Valenciennes (1013) and parts of the Cambresis as well as Saint-Omer and the northern Ternois (1020). In his French territories, the supremacy of Baldwin remained unchallenged. A great deal of colonization of marshland was organized along the coastline of Flanders and the harbour and city of Brugge were enlarged.

Baldwin first married Ogive, daughter of Frederick of Luxembourg, by whom he had a son and heir, Baldwin V (1012 – 1067). He later married Eleanor, daughter of Richard II of Normandy, by whom he had a daughter, Judith (1033 – 1094). Baldwin IV died on 30 May 1035.

<doc id="360715" wikidata="Q2028824" url="?curid=360715" title="Sackville, New Brunswick">
<text>Sackville is a former town in southeastern New Brunswick, Canada. It held town status prior to 2023 and is now part of the town of Tantramar.

Sackville is home to Mount Allison University, a primarily undergraduate liberal arts university. The university welcomes roughly 2200 students per academic year. Historically based on agriculture, shipbuilding, and manufacturing, the economy is now driven by the university and tourism. Initially part of the French colony of Acadia, the settlement became part of the British colony of Nova Scotia in 1755 following the Expulsion of the Acadians.

==History==
===Pre-European===
Present-day Sackville is in the Mi’kmaq district of Siknikt (to which the place name Chignecto may be traced), which roughly comprised Cumberland, Westmorland and part of Albert counties. The Mi’kmaq settlement, Goesomaligeg, was on Fort Beausejour Ridge and Tatamalg or Tantama, on the Sackville Ridge. Many regional toponyms are Mi’kmaq including Tidnish, Minudie, Missaguash River, Aboushagan Road, Midgic, Memramcook and Shemogue. A portage connected Beaubassin by way of Westcock and the valley now known as Frosty Hollow with the Memramcook and Petitcodiac rivers and was an important link in the communications system between Acadia and Quebec.

===French colony (1670s-1755)===
The first Acadians arrived in the early 1670s, as the French colony expanded from its base at Port Royal. Many of the Acadians came from the west of France and were experienced in reclaiming from the sea lowlands that might be made arable. The Tantramar Marshes were well suited to this, and the Acadians built a system of dykes and sluices that allowed them to cultivate the marshes. Surveyor Charles Morris visited in 1748, and reported Acadian settlements at Westcock; Pré des Bourgs, (Sackville); Pré des Richards, (Middle Sackville); Tintamare, (Upper Sackville); La Butte, Le Coup, Le Lac (Aulac); Portage, at the head of the Missaguash River; Beaubassin (adjacent to Beausejour); Jolicoeur, (Jolicure) and Pont à Buot, (Point de Bute). Farther afield, there were settlements at La Planche (Amherst) and Baie Verte for a total population of about 3,000. Settlements were connected by trails and separated by marsh. A seaport at Westcock provided a link to Port Royal.

===British conquest and resettlement===
The Treaty of Utrecht in 1713 had ceded Acadia to England, but without specifying where the boundary was between Acadia and what remained of New France. This led to ongoing skirmishes until June 1755 when, as part of a wider struggle of the British and French of North American colonies, the French were defeated at the Battle of Beausejour. This led to the removal of most of the French military from Acadia. Six weeks later, Governor Charles Lawrence, without distinguishing between neutral Acadians and those who had resisted the British, wrote that the Acadians &quot;shall be removed out of the country as soon as possible, and as to those about the isthmus who were in arms and therefore entitled to no favour from the government it is determined to begin with them first&quot;. This marked the beginning of the expulsion of the Acadians. They were only allowed to take with them their ready money and household furniture, and their buildings were burned to the ground.

Following the expulsion of the Acadians the British needed to repopulate the colony. The first wave of immigration was the New England Planters who were invited and encouraged with land grants. The Sackville area was abandoned for six years after the expulsion of the Acadians until 1761 when 25 families from Rhode Island settled on the vacated Acadian farms, followed in 1763 by a group of 13 from Swansea, Massachusetts, who formed the first Baptist church in Canada, but subsequently returned to New England. In 1763 the population was 20 families on 200 acres of cleared (probably by the Acadians) upland, and also marshlands. A 1767 census gives the population as 349, of which 343 were Americans. The Sackville Township, named after Viscount Sackville, was formally created in 1765 and by 1772 was sufficiently populated to send a representative to the Nova Scotia House of Assembly.

The Yorkshire Emigration started in 1772 and lasted about three years. They arrived too late to occupy the vacated Acadian farms which had already been granted to the New Englanders. However many New Englanders did not stay, and sold the land on to the British immigrants.

When the American War of Independence broke out in 1775, many of the American settlers in the area were sympathetic with the Americans, and rebels led by Jonathan Eddy laid siege to Fort Cumberland. However the rebels were repelled by soldiers, with help from the Yorkshire settlers who remained loyal to the crown. When the war was over, United Empire Loyalists, emigrated north, some to the Sackville area. By 1786 there were 60 families in the township.

===Industrialization and shipbuilding===
By the 1830s tanneries, leather goods factories, carriage factories and blacksmith shops were active around Morice Mill Pond (renamed recently to Silver Lake) a few kilometres north of the current town centre. The centre of activity started to shift to the present downtown area when in 1836 William Crane moved his business to the site of the former town hall, and built his house across the street. He also donated land for a small Methodist chapel that was built in 1838 and later evolved into the much larger Sackville Methodist/United Church. In 1839, Charles Frederick Allison donated money and land to establish the Mount Allison Wesleyan Academy, which became Mount Allison University. This was followed by the development of shipyards on the Tantramar River. Official records for shipbuilding in New Brunswick began in 1824, but by that time shipbuilding was already well under way with several ships of over 100 tons having been built.

In 1862 there was a shipyard at the site of the current railway station, and another to the east at Dixon&#x27;s Landing at the end of Landing Road. A public wharf was built there by local merchants in 1840–41. The shopkeepers were looking to import products and export staples such as lumber, grindstones and building stones. In the 1870s, a spur line connecting the Intercolonial Railway to the wharf was built.

Shipbuilding and coastal trading thrived between 1824 and 1872. The last was built in 1896. The largest was the Sarah Dixon, built by Charles Dixon in 1856 at 1465 tons. That same year, Christopher Boultenhouse launched the 192 ton steamship The Westmorland, which carried passengers, mail and freight between Shediac, Summerside, Charlottetown, and Pictou from 1857 to 1863 for the governments of New Brunswick, Nova Scotia and Prince Edward Island.

By the 1870s the wharf was inadequate since vessels over 200 tons had only the end berth. A new wharf was added in 1911, but much shipping business had already been lost because of the lack of proper wharf. Local folklore reports that a ship never tied up at the new wharf. The wharf and the end of Landing Road was on a meander of the Tantramar River, but in the 1920s the meander was cut off due to erosion and silting, leaving the site without access to the sea.

===The railway era===
In 1872 the Intercolonial Railway project changed the Sackville area forever. This line was to follow the shortest route between Truro and Moncton, but political interference by Edward Barron Chandler and other politicians in nearby Dorchester saw the route for the railway altered to run through their community. It had been intended that the original route for the line would run north across the Tantramar Marshes from Fort Beauséjour to what is currently Middle Sackville and then on through the lowlands to Scoudouc and Moncton. The Dorchester diversion had the railway skirt the western edge of the marsh to the area near the public wharf and shipyards on the lower Tantramar River before continuing on to Frosty Hollow, Dorchester and the Memramcook Valley.

The new location of the Intercolonial Railway resulted in the commercial and business centre of Sackville being relocated from the mill district at Silver Lake to the current town centre, closer to the railway line. The New Brunswick and Prince Edward Island Railway was constructed a decade later to connect Cape Tormentine, the closest point of mainland North America to Prince Edward Island, with the Intercolonial&#x27;s main line. Sackville had been vying with nearby Amherst to be the junction point for the line to Cape Tormentine; local shipbuilder and industrialist entrepreneur Josiah Wood ensured that Sackville was chosen as the junction.

The National Policy of Prime Minister Sir John A. Macdonald&#x27;s administration in the 1870s-1880s saw various industries cluster along the Intercolonial Railway in Amherst and Sackville. Sackville became home to two independent foundries; the Enterprise Foundry, and the Fawcett Foundry. Both produced stoves and related products with both businesses operating for more than a century. These competitors eventually merged and the Fawcett Foundry was closed and the foundry demolished in the 1980s; this brownfield site at the corner of Main and King streets was purchased by Mount Allison University for campus expansion. The remaining Enterprise-Fawcett Foundry was still operational and employed roughly 60 people near the railway station. It was one of the few remaining stove foundries in the world until it suffered a fire in January 2012. As of 2018 the foundry still had not been rebuilt.

Sackville grew in importance as a railway junction after Canadian National Railways established a dedicated railcar ferry service at Cape Tormentine in 1917. The Sackville railway yard and station were constantly busy until the opening of publicly funded highways following World War II started a slow decline. The abandonment of the Prince Edward Island Railway in 1989 saw the line to Cape Tormentine removed at the same time as the Trans-Canada Highway was being expanded to a 4-lane freeway. As the railway consolidated to a single mainline running through town, businesses left, including offices of Atlantic Wholesalers.

===Recent history===
On 1 January 2023, Sackville amalgamated with the village of Dorchester and parts of three local service districts to form the new town of Tantramar. The community&#x27;s name remains in official use.

In November 2022, Sackville received the accreditation of being named an international wetland city under the Ramsar Convention, the first in North America.

==Geography==
Sackville is on the Isthmus of Chignecto, which connects the Nova Scotia peninsula with North America. It is on the Tantramar River, which empties into Chignecto Bay, a sub-basin of the Bay of Fundy. Sackville is at a low elevation above sea level. Prominent ridges rise above the marshes, namely the Fort Lawrence Ridge, the Aulac Ridge, the Sackville Ridge, and the Memramcook Ridge. Sackville is surrounded by the Tantramar Marshes, once a tidal saltmarsh. The marshes are an important stopover for migrating birds. The marsh soil consists of silts deposited by centuries of tidal flooding. Drainage is poor and there are slow-moving meandering rivers, shallow lakes, bogs, and intertidal zones.

==Infrastructure==
The earliest post road followed the route of the present day High Marsh Road. The Trans-Canada Highway (as it is now known) ran straight through the town until a bypass was built in 1962. The provincial border at the Missaguash River bridge is the dividing line between Nova Scotia Highway 104-Nova Scotia Trunk 2 and New Brunswick Highway 2. This highway forms one of the two main surface transportation links between the two provinces. The Mount Whatley Road runs between Mt. Whatley, New Brunswick and Fort Lawrence, Nova Scotia. CN Rail&#x27;s mainline between Halifax and Montreal runs through Sackville, parallel to the Trans-Canada Highway. The Sackville railway station, still in active use with Via Rail, is designated a national historic place.

The Sackville Memorial Hospital serves the region, as well as the Community Health Centre which houses several physicians, an optometrist, a dentist, and a pharmacy. It is one of the few that are not government-run.

The Tantramar Veterans Memorial Civic Centre, a recreational facility and arena, opened in 2003. The arena can seat over 750 spectators and is the home rink for the Mount Allison University women&#x27;s hockey team.

<doc id="360716" wikidata="Q333384" url="?curid=360716" title="Baldwin V, Count of Flanders">
<text>Baldwin V ( 1012 – 1 September 1067) was Count of Flanders from 1035 until his death. He secured the personal union between the counties of Flanders and Hainaut and maintained close links to the Anglo-Saxon monarchy, which was overthrown by his son-in-law, William the Conqueror, near the end of his life.

==Family==

Baldwin was born into the House of Flanders, the son of Baldwin IV of Flanders and Ogive of Luxembourg. Baldwin married Adela, daughter of King Robert II of France, in 1028 in Amiens; at her instigation he rebelled against his father but in 1030 peace was sworn and the old count continued to rule until his death.
The couple had three children: Baldwin VI (1030–1070), Matilda ( 1031–1083), who was married to William the Conqueror, and Robert I ( 1033–1093).

==Career==
During a long war (1046–1056) as an ally of Duke Godfrey III of Lower Lorraine against Emperor Henry III, Baldwin initially lost Valenciennes to Count Herman of Mons. However, when the latter died in 1049, Baldwin had his son, Baldwin VI, marry Herman&#x27;s widow Richilde, and arranged that the children of her first marriage were disinherited, thus &quot;de facto&quot; uniting the County of Hainaut with Flanders. Upon the death of Henry III this marriage was acknowledged by treaty by Agnes of Poitou, mother and regent of Henry IV.

Baldwin V played host to a grateful Emma of Normandy, the exiled queen dowager of England, at Bruges. He supplied armed security guards, entertainment, comprising a band of minstrels. Bruges was a bustling commercial centre, and Emma fittingly grateful to the citizens. She dispensed generously to the poor, making contact with the monastery of Saint Bertin at St Omer, and received her son King Harthacnut of England at Bruges in 1039.

From 1060 to 1067 Baldwin was the co-regent with Anne of Kiev for his nephew Philip I of France, indicating the importance he had acquired in international politics. As count of Flanders, Baldwin supported the king of France in most affairs, but he was also father-in-law to Duke William II of Normandy, who had married his daughter Matilda. Flanders played a pivotal role in Edward the Confessor&#x27;s foreign policy when the king of England was struggling to find an heir. Historians have argued that he may have sent Harold Godwinson to negotiate the return of Edward the Exile from Hungary, and passed through Flanders, on his way to Germany. Baldwin&#x27;s half-sister had married Earl Godwin&#x27;s third son, Tostig. The half-Danish Godwinsons had spent their exile in Dublin, at a time William II of Normandy was fiercely defending his duchy. It is unlikely, however, that Baldwin intervened to prevent the duke&#x27;s invasion plans of England, after the count had lost the conquered province of Ponthieu. Baldwin died 1 September 1067.

<text>The Port Huron Statement is a 1962 political manifesto of the American student activist movement Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). It was written by SDS members, and completed on June 15, 1962, at a United Auto Workers (UAW) retreat outside of Port Huron, Michigan (now part of Lakeport State Park), for the group&#x27;s first national convention. Under Walter Reuther&#x27;s leadership, the UAW paid for a range of expenses for the 1962 convention, including use of the UAW summer retreat in Port Huron. A state historical marker will be erected on the site in 2025.

== Origins and impact ==

SDS developed from the Student League for Industrial Democracy (SLID), the youth branch of a socialist educational organization known as the League for Industrial Democracy (LID). LID descended from the Intercollegiate Socialist Society, started in 1905. Early in 1960, the SLID changed its name into Students for a Democratic Society (SDS). The Port Huron Statement was adopted at the organization&#x27;s first convention in 1962, and was based on an earlier draft by staff member Tom Hayden.

The Port Huron Statement was a broad critique of the political and social system of the United States for failing to achieve international peace and economic justice. In foreign policy, the statement took issue with the American government&#x27;s handling of the Cold War, both the existential threat of nuclear war, and the actual arms race. In domestic matters, it criticized racial discrimination, economic inequality, big businesses, trade unions, and political parties. In addition to its critique and analysis of the American system, the statement also suggested a series of reforms: it proclaimed a need to reshape into two genuine political parties to attain greater democracy, for stronger power for individuals through citizen&#x27;s lobbies, for more substantial involvement by workers in business management, and for an enlarged public sector with increased government welfare, including a &quot;program against poverty.&quot; The document provided ideas of what and how to work for and to improve, and also advocated nonviolent civil disobedience as the means by which student youth could bring forth the concept of &quot;participatory democracy.&quot; 

The statement also presented SDS&#x27;s break from the mainstream liberal policies of the postwar years. It was written to reflect their view that all problems in every area were linked to each other. The statement expressed SDS&#x27;s willingness to work with groups whatever their political inclination. In doing so, they sought the rejection of the extant anti-communism of the time. In the concurrent Cold War environment, such a statement of inclusion for the heretofore &quot;evil&quot; Communist ideology, and by extension, socialist concepts, was definitely seen as a new, radical view contrasting with the position of much of the traditional American Left. The latter had developed a largely anti-communist orthodoxy in the wake of the HUAC and Army-McCarthy hearings. Without being Marxist or pro-communism, the Port Huron conference denounced anti-communism as being a social problem and an obstruction to democracy. They also criticized the United States for its exaggerated paranoia and exclusive condemnation of the Soviet Union, and blamed this for being the reason for failing to achieve disarmament and to assure peace.

The Port Huron Statement, ultimately, was a document of idealism, a philosophical template for a more egalitarian society, a call to participatory democracy where everyone was engaged in issues that affected all people - in civil rights, in political accountability, in labor rights, and in nuclear disarmament. It closed with the following: &quot;If we appear to seek the unattainable, as it has been said, then let it be known that we do so to avoid the unimaginable.&quot; The ideals that led those gathered outside Port Huron, Michigan in 1962 to issue this call to action not only added to the discussion of what became the Great Society of the mid-60s, but helped frame the issues that fueled the rising anti-war movement, college campus activism, and the broader social movement known then as the counterculture that carried into the early 1970s in the United States.

==Argument==
The 25,700-word statement issued a non-ideological call for participatory democracy, based on non-violent civil disobedience and the idea that individual citizens could help make the social decisions which determined their quality of life. Also known as the &quot;Agenda for a Generation&quot;, it popularized the term &quot;participatory democracy&quot;.

It has been described as &quot;a seminal moment in the development of the New Left&quot; and a &quot;classic statement of [its] principles&quot;, but it also revealed the 1960s&#x27; tension between communitarianism and individualism. In particular, the statement viewed race (&quot;symbolized by the Southern struggle against racial bigotry&quot;) and Cold War–induced alienation (&quot;symbolized by the presence of the Bomb&quot;) as the two main problems of modern society.

== Issues and recommendations ==
===Reform of the Democratic Party===
&quot;An imperative task for these publicly disinherited groups, then, is to demand a Democratic Party responsible to their interests. They must support Southern voter registration and Negro political candidates and demand that Democratic Party liberals do the same (in the last Congress, Dixiecrats split with Northern Democrats on 119 of 300 roll-calls, mostly on civil rights, area redevelopment and foreign aid bills; and the breach was much larger than in the previous several sessions). Labor should begin a major drive in the South. In the North, reform clubs (either independent or Democratic) should be formed to run against big city regimes on such issues as peace, civil rights, and urban needs. Demonstrations should be held at every Congressional or convention seating of Dixiecrats. A massive research and publicity campaign should be initiated, showing to every housewife, doctor, professor, and worker the damage done to their interests every day a racist occupies a place in the Democratic Party. Where possible, the peace movement should challenge the &quot;peace credentials&quot; of the otherwise-liberals by threatening or actually running candidates against them.&quot;

===University reform===
The Port Huron Statement argued that because &quot;the civil rights and peace and student movements are too poor and socially slighted, and the labor movement too quiescent&quot;, it should rally support and strengthen itself by looking to universities, which benefit from their &quot;permanent position of social influence&quot; and being &quot;the only mainstream institution that is open to participation by individuals of nearly any viewpoint&quot;. However, it stated that this &quot;will involve national efforts at university reform by an alliance of students and faculty&quot; who &quot;must wrest control of the educational process from the administrative bureaucracy&quot;, ally with groups outside the university, integrate &quot;major public issues into the curriculum&quot;, &quot;make debate and controversy&quot;. In short, &quot;They must consciously build a base for their assault upon the loci of power.&quot;

<text>Jerzy Popiełuszko ( born Alfons Popiełuszko; 14 September 1947 – 19 October 1984) was a Polish Catholic priest who became associated with the opposition Solidarity trade union in communist Poland. He was murdered in 1984 by three agents of , who were shortly thereafter tried and convicted of the murder.

Popiełuszko has been recognized as a martyr by the Catholic Church and was beatified on 6 June 2010 by Cardinal Angelo Amato on behalf of Pope Benedict XVI. An alleged miracle attributed to his intercession, which could lead to his canonization, is now under investigation.

==Biography==

===Early life and priesthood===

Popiełuszko was born on 14 September 1947 in Okopy, near Suchowola. After finishing school, he attended the priests&#x27; seminary at Warsaw. In 1966–1968, he served his army duties in a special force in Bartoszyce, aimed at keeping young men from becoming priests. This treatment had no effect on Popiełuszko&#x27;s beliefs, as, after finishing his army service, he continued his studies; however, the repeated punishments for his resistance affected his health for the rest of his life.

Popiełuszko was ordained a priest by Cardinal Stefan Wyszyński in May 1972. As a young priest he first served in Ząbki near Warsaw in 1972–1975. Afterwards, he served in parishes in Warsaw, which consisted of the common people as well as students. In 1981, Jerzy Popiełuszko joined the workers, taking part with strikers in the Warsaw Steelworks. Thereafter he was associated with workers and trade unionists from the Solidarity movement who opposed the communist regime in Poland.

He was a staunch opponent of the communist regime and, in his sermons, interwove spiritual exhortations with political messages, criticizing the government, expressing solidarity with the interned and motivating people to protest. During the period of martial law, the Catholic Church was the only force that could voice protest comparatively openly, with the regular celebration of Mass presenting opportunities for public gatherings in churches.
Popiełuszko&#x27;s sermons were routinely broadcast by Radio Free Europe, and thus became known throughout Poland for their uncompromising stance against the regime.

===Assassination===
Invited by the Pastoral Care of the Working People (), Popiełuszko arrived in Bydgoszcz on 19 October 1984. At 18:00, he celebrated Holy Mass at the Church of the Holy Polish Brothers Martyrs.
A car accident had been set up to kill Popiełuszko on 13 October 1984 but he evaded it. The alternative plan was to kidnap him; it was carried out on 19 October 1984. The priest was beaten to death by three Security Police officers: Captain Grzegorz Piotrowski, Leszek Pękala, and Waldemar Chmielewski. They pretended to have problems with their car and flagged down Popiełuszko&#x27;s car for help. Popiełuszko was severely beaten, tied up and put in the trunk of the car.&lt;ref name=&quot;http://ststanskostka.org&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; The officers bound a stone to his feet and dropped him into the Vistula Water Reservoir near Włocławek from where his body was recovered on 30 October 1984.
News of the political murder caused an uproar throughout Poland, and the murderers and one of their superiors, Colonel Adam Pietruszka, were convicted of the crime. A huge crowd estimated to be between 600,000 to 1million, including Lech Wałęsa, attended his funeral on 3 November 1984. The murder was widely used in political propaganda of the Polish opposition in the late 1980s. Popiełuszko&#x27;s murderers – Captain Grzegorz Piotrowski, Leszek Pękala, Waldemar Chmielewski and Colonel Adam Pietruszka, responsible for giving the order to kill – received prison sentences.

Popiełuszko was posthumously awarded the Order of the White Eagle, Poland&#x27;s highest decoration, in 2009. He was buried in St. Stanislaus Kostka Church, Warsaw, where millions of visitors paid tribute, including famous politicians like U.S. Vice President George Bush in September 1987.

==Legacy==

===Media===
Noted Polish composer Andrzej Panufnik composed his Bassoon Concerto (1985) in memory of Popiełuszko. The work is inspired by Popiełuszko&#x27;s work and death.

&quot;To Kill a Priest&quot; (1988) is a movie directed by Agnieszka Holland and starring Christopher Lambert as a character based on Jerzy Popiełuszko.

A track entitled &quot;Homily to Popiełuszko&quot; is featured on the B-side to the album &quot;Flajelata&quot; (1986) by Muslimgauze. The entire B-side of that album is dedicated to all dissidents from the Soviet Union.

A transcript of the trial of Popiełuszko&#x27;s murderers was used in producing a play, Ronald Harwood&#x27;s documentary drama &quot;The Deliberate Death of a Polish Priest.&quot; It was premiered at the Almeida Theatre in October 1985.

A movie, &quot;&quot; documenting the life and death of Popiełuszko, was released in Poland in February 2009. Another film, &quot;Jerzy Popieluszko: Messenger of the Truth&quot;, was produced by Paul G. Hensler in 2013.

In the television show &quot;The Americans&quot;, the episode &quot;Duty and Honor&quot; in season one featured a fictional Polish resistance leader loosely based on Popiełuszko.

In their work &quot;Manufacturing Consent&quot;, Edward S. Herman and Noam Chomsky used Popiełuszko&#x27;s murder and subsequent media coverage in the United States as a case study of their &quot;propaganda model&quot;, in which it is compared and contrasted with the coverage of murders of Óscar Romero and other Latin American clergy by US-backed forces.

===Monuments===

There are numerous monuments to Fr. Popiełuszko in Poland, including the towns of Suchowola, where he attended and graduated high school, Bartoszyce, where he served his army duties, and Ząbki, where he first served as a priest. The places of his kidnapping in Górsk and death in Włocławek are commemorated with monuments in the form of crosses. There is also a museum dedicated to him in Suchowola.

The first monument of Jerzy Popiełuszko was created by Polish sculptor and dissident Marek Sobociński, and was unveiled in 1986 in Mariaholm near Askim, Norway.

A monument to Fr. Popiełuszko in the form of a symbolic gravestone in the shape of a cross was erected by Chicago&#x27;s Polish community in the garden of memory next to St. Hyacinth Basilica.

A monument to Fr. Popiełuszko in the form of a bust bearing his likeness with a chain wrapped about his neck was erected on the property of Saint Hedwig Catholic Church in Trenton, New Jersey.

A pocket park across from McCarren Park on the Williamsburg-Greenpoint border in Brooklyn, New York, a historically Polish neighborhood, is named for Fr. Popiełuszko and features a stone bust bearing his likeness.

Popieluszko Court in Hartford, Connecticut, was named in his memory. The SS. Cyril &amp; Methodius Church is located on this street, serving as an important cornerstone for the area&#x27;s Catholic Polish-American community. The street intersects with Charter Oak Boulevard, with the main entrance to the parking lot of the Polish National Home of Hartford across the street at the end of Popieluszko Court.

A two-part monument has been installed in New Britain&#x27;s Walnut Hill Park consisting of an inscribed stone plaque near an abstract sculpture of an eternal flame.

The stone is inscribed with the Polish Title &quot;Zło Dobrem Zwyciężaj&quot;: &quot;This human rights monument of common fieldstone
and steel is built in memory of Father Jerzy
Popieluszko who gave his life to God and to the
goals of &quot;Solidarność&quot; – human rights, justice,
peace and freedom for Poland and for all mankind.
May this eternal flame of liberty and the
memory of his courage and sacrifice burn forever
in the hearts of all freedom-loving people.
1947 Good shall vanquish evil 1984&quot;

The abstract sculpture of the eternal flame was created by Henry Chotkowski and dedicated on June 16, 1989. An aluminum plaque on the stone wall surrounding the sculpture explains the significance of the sculpture.
The rock that was used to kill Popiełuszko was placed in the San Bartolomeo all&#x27;Isola in Rome as a relic of a 20th-century martyr, part of the memorial to 20th– and 21st–century martyrs.

There are two monuments commemorating Father Popiełuszko in Budapest, Hungary. In 2017, a monument containing Father Popiełuszko&#x27;s motto &quot;Overcome evil with good&quot; written in Polish and in Hungarian was unveiled in the Csepel district of the Hungarian capital. In Csepel, there is also a street named after Father Popiełuszko and a belfry in his honor. Meanwhile, in 2016 in the Óbuda-Békásmegyer district of Budapest there is a square named after Father Popiełuszko and a monument consisting of stones that make up a rosary featuring quotes by Popiełuszko.

There is also a monument in the French city of Béziers.

==Beatification and canonization==
The Roman Catholic Church started the process of his beatification with the declaration of &quot;nihil obstat&quot; (nothing against) on 15 March 1996 and held a diocesan process from 8 February 1997 to 8 February 2001. This conferred upon him the title of Servant of God. In 2008 the &quot;positio&quot; was submitted to the Congregation for the Causes of Saints and on 19 December 2009 it was announced that Pope Benedict XVI had approved the decree for the beatification of Father Popiełuszko.

He was beatified by Archbishop Angelo Amato on 6 June 2010 in Warsaw&#x27;s Piłsudski Square. His mother, Marianna Popiełuszko, was present at the event. More than 100,000 people attended the open-air Mass in the Polish capital Warsaw to beatify Father Jerzy Popieluszko. Poland Post issued a set of stamps on that same day to mark the beatification.

In October 2013, Cardinal Kazimierz Nycz – the Archbishop of Warsaw, the diocese where Popiełuszko was killed – announced that a miracle attributed to the intercession of the Polish priest has been identified and confirmed in France. Thus Cardinal Nycz predicts that Popiełuszko will likely be canonized soon, based on the credibility of the case presented. A miracle was investigated in a diocesan process in France from 20 September 2014 until 14 September 2015 and the results of that investigation turned over to the Vatican for assessment.

<doc id="360721" wikidata="Q1290600" url="?curid=360721" title="Visayans">
<text>Visayans (Cebuano: &quot;mga Bisayà&quot; ) are a Philippine ethnolinguistic family group or metaethnicity native to the Visayas, to the southernmost islands south of Luzon, and to a significant portion of Mindanao. They are composed of numerous distinct ethnic groups, many unrelated to each other. When taken as a single group, they number around 33.5 million. The Visayans, like the Luzon Lowlanders (Tagalogs, Bicolanos, Ilocanos, etc.) were originally predominantly animist-polytheists and broadly share a maritime culture until the 16th 
century when the Spanish Empire enforced Catholicism as the state religion. In more inland or otherwise secluded areas, ancient animistic-polytheistic beliefs and traditions either were reinterpreted within a Roman Catholic framework or syncretized with the new religion. Visayans are generally speakers of one or more of the distinct Bisayan languages, the most widely spoken being Cebuano, followed by Hiligaynon (Ilonggo) and Waray-Waray.

==Terminology==

&quot;Visayan&quot; is the anglicization of the hispanized term &quot;Bisayas&quot; (archaic &quot;Biçayas&quot;), in turn derived from Visayan &quot;Bisaya&quot;. &quot;Kabisay-an&quot; refers both to the Visayan people collectively and the islands they have inhabited since prehistory, the Visayas. The exact meaning and origin of the name &quot;Bisaya&quot; is unknown. The first documented use of the name is possibly by Song-era Chinese maritime official Zhao Rugua who wrote about the &quot;Pi-sho-ye&quot;, who raided the coasts of Fujian and Penghu during the late 12th century using iron javelins attached to ropes as their weapons.

Visayans were first referred to by the general term &quot;Pintados&quot; (&quot;the painted ones&quot;) by the Spanish, in reference to the prominent practice of full-body tattooing (&quot;batok&quot;). The word &quot;Bisaya&quot;, on the other hand, was first documented in Spanish sources in reference to the non-Ati inhabitants of the island of Panay. However, it is likely that the name was already used as a general endonym by Visayans long before Spanish colonization, as evidenced by at least one instance of a place named &quot;Bisaya&quot; in coastal eastern Mindanao as reported by the Loaisa (c.1526), Saavedra (c.1528), and the Villalobos (c.1543) expeditions. It is likely that the reason the Spanish did not use the term generally until the later decades of the 1500s is due to the fact that people were more likely to identify themselves with more specific ethnic names like &quot;Sugbuanon&quot;.

In &quot;Sucesos de las Islas Filipinas&quot; (1609) by Antonio de Morga, he specifies that the name &quot;Biçaya&quot; is synonymous with &quot;Pintados&quot;.
The first Spanish-Visayan dictionary written was for the Waray language in the &quot;Bocabulario de la lengua Bisaya&quot; by Mateo Sánchez, which was completed in 1617 in Leyte. This was followed by the &quot;Bocabulario de la lengua Bisaya-Hiligueyna y Haraía de las islas de Panay y Sugbu, y para las demás islas&quot; (1637) by Alonso de Méntrida which in turn was for the Hiligaynon language, with notes on the Aklanon and Kinaray-a languages. Both these works demonstrate that the term &quot;Bisaya&quot; was used as a general term for Visayans by the Spanish.

Another general term for Visayans in early Spanish records is &quot;Hiligueinos&quot; (also spelled &quot;Yliguenes&quot;, &quot;Yligueynes&quot;, or &quot;Hiligueynos&quot;; from Visayan &quot;Iligan&quot; or &quot;Iliganon&quot;, meaning &quot;people of the coast&quot;). It was used by the Spanish conquistador Miguel de Loarca in &quot;Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas&quot; (1582) as a general name for coastal-dwelling Visayans not only in Panay, but also Cebu, Bohol, and Western Negros. Today, the demonym is only used specifically for the Hiligaynon people, a major Visayan subgroup.

In Northern Mindanao, Visayans (both Mindanao natives and modern migrants) are also referred to by the Lumad as the &quot;dumagat&quot; (&quot;sea people&quot;, from the root word &quot;dagat&quot; - &quot;sea&quot;; not to be confused with the Dumagat Aeta in Luzon). This was to distinguish the coast-dwelling Visayans from the Lumad of the interior highlands and marshlands.

==Regions with significant populations==

The following regions and provinces in the Philippines have a sizeable or predominant Visayan population:

==History==

===Classical period===
The Visayans first encountered Western Civilization when Portuguese explorer Ferdinand Magellan reached the island of Homonhon, Eastern Samar in 1521. The Visayas became part of the Spanish colony of the Philippines and the history of the Visayans became intertwined with the history of the Philippines. With the three centuries of contact with the Spanish Empire via Mexico and the United States, the islands today share a culture tied to the sea later developed from an admixture of indigenous lowland Visayans, Han Chinese, Indian, and American influences.

===Spanish colonial period===
The first Filipino people encountered by the Magellan expedition (c. 1521) were Visayans from the island of Suluan; followed by two rulers of the Surigaonon and Butuanon people on a hunting expedition in Limasawa, Rajah Colambu and Rahah Siaui; and finally Rajah Humabon of Cebu. Magellan describes the Suluanon people he encountered as &quot;painted&quot; (tattooed), with gold earrings and armlets, and kerchiefs around their heads. They described Rajah Colambu as having dark hair that hung down to his shoulders, tawny skin, and tattoos all throughout his body. They also noted the large amount of gold ornaments he wore, from large gold earrings to gold tooth fillings. Rajah Colambu wore embroidered patadyong that covered him from the waist to the knees, as well as a kerchief around his head. They also described the &quot;boloto&quot; (bangka) and the large &quot;balanghai&quot; (balangay) warships, and the custom of drinking palm wine (&quot;uraka&quot;) and chewing areca nut. They also described the queen of Cebu as being young and beautiful and covered in white and black cloth. She painted her lips and nails red, and wore a large disc-shaped hat (&quot;sadok&quot;) made from elaborately-woven leaves.

The 16th century marks the beginning of the Christianization of the Visayan people, with the baptism of Rajah Humabon and about 800 native Cebuanos. The Christianization of the Visayans and Filipinos in general, is commemorated by the Ati-Atihan Festival of Aklan, the Dinagyang Festival of Iloilo, and the Sinulog festival the feast of the Santo Niño de Cebu (Holy Child of Cebu), the brown-skinned depiction of the Child Jesus given by Magellan to Rajah Humabon&#x27;s wife, Hara Amihan (baptized as Queen Juana). By the 17th century, Visayans already took part in religious missions. In 1672, Pedro Calungsod, a teenage indigenous Visayan catechist and Diego Luis de San Vitores, a Spanish friar, were both martyred in Guam during their mission to preach Christianity to the Chamorro people.

By the end of the 19th century, the Spanish Empire weakened after a series of wars with its American territories. The surge of newer ideas from the outside world thanks to the liberalization of trade by the Bourbon Spain fostered a relatively larger middle class population called the &quot;Ilustrados&quot; or &quot;the Enlightened Ones.&quot; This then became an incentive for the new generation of educated political visionaries to fulfill their dreams of independence from three centuries of colonial rule. Some prominent leaders of the Philippine Revolution in the late 19th century were Visayans. Among leaders of the Propaganda movement was Graciano López Jaena, the Ilonggo who established the propagandist publication &quot;La Solidaridad&quot; (The Solidarity). In the Visayan theater of the Revolution, Pantaleón Villegas (better known as León Kilat) led the Cebuano revolution in the Battle of &quot;Tres de Abril&quot; (April 3). One of his successors, Arcadio Maxilom, is a prominent general in the liberalization of Cebu. Earlier in 1897, Aklan fought against the Spaniards with Francisco Castillo and Candido Iban at the helm. Both were executed after a failed offensive. Martin Delgado led the rebellion in neighboring Iloilo. Led by Juan Araneta with the assistance of Aniceto Lacson, Negros Occidental was freed while Negros Oriental was liberated by Diego de la Viña. The former would be called the Negros Revolution or the &quot;Cinco de Noviembre&quot;. Movements in Capiz were led by Esteban Contreras with the aid of Alejandro Balgos, Santiago Bellosillo and other Ilustrados. Meanwhile, Leandro Locsin Fullon spearheaded the liberalization of Antique. Most of these revolutionaries would continue their fight for independence until the Philippine–American War. There was also a less heard and short-lived uprising called the Igbaong Revolt which occurred in Igbaong, Antique steered by Maximo and Gregorio Palmero. This revolt, however, was secularly-motivated as they clamored for a more syncretic form of religion based on Visayan animist traditions and Christianity.

===Federal State of the Visayas===
At the peak of the Philippine Revolution, anti-colonial insurgencies sprung from Luzon up to the Visayas. Despite military support from the Tagalog Republic led by Emilio Aguinaldo, Visayan revolutionary leaders were skeptical toward the real motives of the Tagalogs. Such ethnic animosity was notable to the point that local Visayan leaders demanded forces sent from the north to surrender their armaments and were prohibited to leave revolutionary bases. Moreover, this apprehension led to the full declaration of the Federal State of Visayas on December 12, 1898. This short-lived federal government, based in Iloilo, was an accumulation of revolutionary movements across Panay and Negros. The following were the elected officials four days prior to the declaration:
The federation was immediately formed upon the merger of the Cantonal Government of Negros, the Cantonal Government of Bohol and the Provisional Government of the District of Visayas (based in Panay) which included Romblon. It was said to be based on American federalism and Swiss confederacy. Despite their skepticism towards Malolos, the Visayan government proclaimed its loyalty to the Luzon-based republic while maintaining their own governance, tax collection and army. Apolinario Mabini, then the prime minister of the Malolos republic convinced the Visayan leaders that the Malolos Constitution was only provisional and that the governments in Visayas and Mindanao were promised the power to co-ratify it.

===American colonization===

After the 1898 Treaty of Paris, the American colonial government saw the integral part of indigenous elites particularly in Negros in local affairs. This was a different move compared to the previous Spanish imperialists who created a racial distinction between mestizos and native Austronesians (&quot;indios&quot;). As such, this paved the way for a homogenous concept of a Filipino albeit initially based on financial and political power. These said elites were the &quot;hacienderos&quot; or the landed, bourgeois-capitalist class concentrated within the sugar cane industry of Negros. The Americans&#x27; belief that these hacienderos would be strategic elements in their political hold within the newly acquired colony bolstered the drafting of a separate colonial constitution by and for the sugar industry elites. This constitution likewise established the Negros Cantonal Government. This ensured that the island of Negros would be governed by an indigenous civilian government in contrast to the rest of colonist-controlled areas governed by the American-dominated Philippine Commission.

During this period, the eastern islands of Samar, Leyte and Biliran (including Marinduque) were directly governed by the Malolos Republic through Vicente Lukban and later by Ambrosio Mojica. Meanwhile, prior to the full abolition of the federal government on November 12, 1899, Emilio Aguinaldo appointed Martin Delgado as the civil and military governor of Iloilo on April 28, 1899, upon American invasion of Antique. The federal government, much to its rejection of the Cebuano leaders who supported the Katipunan cause, was dissolved upon the Iloilo leaders&#x27; voluntary union with the newly formed First Philippine Republic. Other factors which led to Aguinaldo forcing the Visayans to dissolve their government was due to the federation&#x27;s resistance from reorganizing its army and forwarding taxes to Malolos.

===Contemporary===

Since Philippine independence from the United States, there have been four Philippine Presidents from the Visayan regions: the Cebuano Sergio Osmeña, the Capiznon Manuel Roxas, the Boholano Carlos P. García (who is actually of Ilocano descent through his parents from Bangued, Abra), and the Davaoeño Rodrigo Duterte.
In addition, the Visayas has produced three Vice-Presidents, four Senate Presidents, nine Speakers of the House, six Chief Justices, and six Presidential Spouses including Imelda Marcos, a Waray. The then-president Gloria Macapagal Arroyo is also half Cebuano. Former president Rodrigo Duterte, who is of Visayan ethnicity, also has Leyteño roots. Incumbent president Bongbong Marcos, is of Visayan descent through his Waray mother Imelda Marcos. In international diplomacy the Visayas has produced a United Nations Undersecretary general, the Negros Occidental native Rafael M. Salas who served as the Head of the UNFPA. In the lines of religion, there have been three Visayan Cardinals, namely Julio Rosales from Samar, Jaime Sin from Aklan and Jose Advincula from Capiz. The first Visayan and second Filipino that was canonized is Pedro Calungsod.

Throughout centuries, non-Visayan groups, most notably migrants from Luzon and foreigners such as the Chinese, have settled in predominantly-Visayan cities in Visayas like Iloilo, Bacolod, Dumaguete and Cebu and Mindanao such as Cagayan de Oro, Iligan, Davao and General Santos. These Filipino-Chinese have been assimilated to mainstream society. One factor would be the limited number of Chinese schools in the Visayas which help maintain the Chinese identity and a stronger sense of a distinct community. Many of them, particularly the younger generation, have been de-cultured from Chinese traditions, share values about family and friends with other Filipinos, and do not write or speak Chinese well.
Mexicans, Spaniards and Frenchmen were also settlers in the Visayas and can be found in the Visayan provinces of Negros, Cebu, Leyte and Iloilo.

Meanwhile, Negritos, locally called &quot;Ati&quot;, have also been assimilated into mainstream Visayan society.

In Mindanao, migrant ethnic individuals from Luzon as well as Lumad assimilated into a society of Cebuano-speaking majority (Hiligaynon-speaking majority in the case of Soccsksargen) over many years, identifying themselves as Visayans upon learning Cebuano (or Hiligaynon) despite many of them still know and retain their non-Visayan roots and some speak their ancestor&#x27;s language fluently at least as their second or third languages, since Mindanao is melting pot of different cultures as a result of southward migration from Luzon and Visayas to the island since 20th century. Descendants of these migrant Luzon ethnic groups especially newer generations (as Mindanao-born natives) and Lumad individuals now speak Cebuano or Hiligaynon fluently as their main language with little or no knowledge of their ancestors&#x27; native tongues at the time of leaving their respective homelands in Luzon heading south, as for the Lumad, due to the contact with Cebuano- and Hiligaynon-speaking neighbors.

Visayans have likewise migrated to other parts of the Philippines, especially Metro Manila and Mindanao. The Visayans have also followed the pattern of migration of Filipinos abroad and some have migrated to other parts of the world starting from the Spanish and American period and after World War II. Most are migrants or working as overseas contract workers.

==Language==


Ethnic Visayans predominantly speak at least one of the Bisayan languages, most of which are commonly referred as &quot;Binisaya&quot; or &quot;Bisaya&quot;. The table below lists the Philippine languages classified as Bisayan languages by the Summer Institute of Linguistics. Although all of the languages indicated below are classified as &quot;Bisayan&quot; by linguistic terminology, not all speakers identify themselves as ethnically or culturally Visayan. The Tausūg, a Moro ethnic group, only use &quot;Bisaya&quot; to refer to the predominantly Christian lowland natives which Visayans are popularly recognized as. This is a similar case to the Ati, who delineate Visayans from fellow Negritos. Conversely, the Visayans of Capul in Northern Samar speak Abaknon, a Sama–Bajaw language, as their native tongue.


==Culture==
===Tattoo===
Like most other pre-colonial ethnic groups in the Philippines and other Austronesian groups, tattooing was widespread among Visayans. The original Spanish name for the Visayans, Los Pintados (&quot;The Painted Ones&quot;) was a reference to the tattoos of the Visayans. Antonio Pigafetta of the Magellan expedition (c. 1521) repeatedly describes the Visayans they encountered as &quot;painted all over&quot;.
Tattooing traditions were lost over time among almost all Visayans during Christianization in the Spanish colonial period. It is unclear whether the related Tausug people, who are a subset of southern Visayans who Islamized from the 13th century, practiced tattooing before they took up Islam. Today, traditional tattooing among Visayans only survives among some of the older members of the Sulodnon people of the interior highlands of Panay, the descendants of ancient Visayans who escaped Spanish conversion.

Tattoos were known as &quot;batuk&quot; (or &quot;batok&quot;) or &quot;patik&quot; among Visayans. These terms were also applied to identical designs used in woven textiles, pottery, and other decorations. Tattooed people were known generally as &quot;binatakan&quot; or &quot;batokan&quot; (also known to the Tagalog people as &quot;batikan&quot;, which also means &quot;renowned&quot; or &quot;skilled&quot;). Both sexes had tattoos. They were symbols of tribal identity and kinship, as well as bravery, beauty, and social status. It was expected of adults to have them, with the exception of the &quot;asog&quot; (feminized men) for whom it was socially acceptable to be &quot;mapuraw&quot; or &quot;puraw&quot; (unmarked). Tattoos were so highly regarded that men will often just wear a loincloth (&quot;bahag&quot;) to show them off.

The Visayan language itself had various terminologies relating to tattoos like &quot;kulmat&quot; (&quot;to show off new tattoos) and &quot;hundawas&quot; (&quot;to bare the chest and show off tattoos for bravado&quot;). Men who were tattooed but have not participated in battles were scorned as &quot;halo&quot; (monitor lizard), in the sense of being tattooed but undeserving. &quot;Baug&quot; or &quot;binogok&quot; referred to the healing period after being tattooed. &quot;Lusak&quot; (&quot;mud&quot;) refers to tattoos that had damaged designs due to infection. Famous heroes covered in tattoos were known as &quot;lipong&quot;.

Tattoos are acquired gradually over the years, and patterns can take months to complete and heal. They were made by skilled artists using the distinctively Austronesian hafted tattooing technique. This involves using a small hammer to tap the tattooing needle (one or several) set perpendicularly on a wooden handle in an L-shape (hence &quot;hafted&quot;). The ink was made from soot or ashes and water or plant extracts (like those from &quot;Cayratia trifolia&quot;) and was known as &quot;biro&quot;. The tattooing process were sacred events that required chicken or pig sacrifices to the ancestor spirits (&quot;diwata&quot;). Artists were usually paid with livestock, heirloom beads, or precious metals.

The first tattoos were acquired during the initiation into adulthood. They are initially made on the ankles, gradually moving up to the legs and finally the waist. These tattoos were known as &quot;hinawak&quot; (&quot;of the waist&quot;). These were done on all men, and did not indicate special status. Tattoos on the upper body, however, were only done after notable feats (including in love) and after participation in battles. Once the chest and throat are covered, tattoos are further applied to the back. Tattoos on the chin and face (reaching up to the eyelids) are restricted to the most elite warriors. These face tattoos are called &quot;bangut&quot; (&quot;muzzle&quot;) or &quot;langi&quot; (&quot;gaping [jaws/beaks]&quot;) and are often designed to resemble frightening masks. They may also be further augmented with scarification (&quot;labong&quot;) burned into the arms. Women were tattooed only on the hands in very fine and intricate designs resembling damask embroidery.

Tattoo designs varied by region. They can be repeating geometric designs, stylized representations of animals (like snakes and lizards), and floral or sun-like patterns. The most basic design was the &quot;labid&quot;, which was an inch-wide continuous tattoo that covered the legs to the waist in straight or zigzagging lines. Shoulder tattoos were known as &quot;ablay&quot;; chest tattoos up to the throat were known as &quot;dubdub&quot;; and arm tattoos were known as &quot;daya-daya&quot; (also &quot;tagur&quot; in Panay).

====Other body modifications====
In addition to tattoos, Visayans also had other body modifications. These include artificial cranial deformation, in which the forehead of infants was pressed against a comb-like device called &quot;tangad&quot;. The ideal skull shape for adults was for the forehead to slope backwards with a more elongated back part of the skull. Adults with skulls shaped this way were known as &quot;tinangad&quot;, in contrast with those of unshaped skulls called &quot;ondo&quot;. Men were also circumcised (more accurately supercised), practiced pearling, or wore pin-shaped genital piercings called &quot;tugbuk&quot; which was anchored by decorative rivets called &quot;sakra&quot;. Both men and women also had ear piercings (1 to 2 on each ear for men, and 3 to 4 for women) and wore huge ring-shaped earrings, earplugs around wide, or pendant earrings. Gold teeth fillings were also common for renowned warriors. Teeth filing and teeth blackening were also practiced.

===Precolonial Religion===
====Pre-Christianity====

Prior to the arrival of Catholicism, precolonial Visayans adhered to a complex animist and Hindu-Buddhist system where spirits in nature were believed to govern all existing life. Similar to other ethnic groups in the Philippines such as the Tagalogs who believed in a pantheon of gods, the Visayans also adhered to deities led by a supreme being. Such belief, on the other hand, was misinterpreted by arriving Spaniards such as Jesuit historian Pedro Chirino to be a form of monotheism. There are Kaptan and Magwayan, supreme god of the sky and goddess of the sea and death, respectively. They in turn bore two children, Lihangin, god of wind, and Lidagat, goddess of the sea. Both aforementioned gods had four children, namely Likabutan, the god of the world, Liadlaw, the god of the sun, Libulan, the god of the moon, and Lisuga, the goddess of the stars. People believed that life transpires amidst the will of and reverence towards gods and spirits. These deities who dwell within nature were collectively called the &quot;diwata&quot; (a local adaptation of the Hindu or Buddhist Devata). The Visayans adored (either for fear or veneration) various Diwatas . Early Spanish colonizers observed that some of these deities of the Visayas, have sinister characters, and so, the colonizers called them evil gods. These &quot;Diwatas&quot; live in rivers, forests, mountains, and the natives fear even to cut the grass in these places believed to be where the lesser gods abound. These places are described, even now (after more than four hundred years of Christianization in the region), as &quot;mariit&quot; (enchanted and dangerous). The natives would make &quot;panabi-tabi&quot; (courteous and reverent request for permission) when inevitably constrained to pass or come near these sites. Miguel de Loarca in his &quot;Relacion de las Yslas Filipinas&quot; (Arevalo: June 1582) described them. Some are the following:

# Barangao, Ynaguinid, and Malandok: a trinity of deities invoked before going to war, or before plundering expeditions
# Makaptan: the god who dwells in the highest sky, in the world that has no end. He is a bad god, because he sends disease and death if has not eaten anything of this world or has not drunk any pitarillas. He does not love humans, and so he kills them.
# Lalahon: the goddess who dwells in Mt. Canlaon, from where she hurls fire. She is invoked for harvests. When she does not grant the people good harvest, she sends them locusts to destroy and consume the crops.
# Magwayen: the god of the oceans; and the father (in some stories the mother) of water goddess Lidagat, who after her death decided to ferry souls in the afterworld.
# Sidapa: another god in the sky, who measures and determines the lifespan of all the new-born by placing marks on a very tall tree on Mt. Madja-as, which correspond to each person who come into this world. The souls of the dead inhabitants go to the same Mt. Madja-as.

Some Spanish colonial historians, including Isabelo de los Reyes y Florentino, would classify some heroes and demigods of the Panay epic Hinilawod, like Labaw Donggon, among these Diwatas.

==== Creation of the first man and woman ====
In the above-mentioned report of Miguel de Loarca, the Visayans&#x27; belief regarding the origin of the world and the creation of the first man and woman was recorded. The narrative says:

The people of the coast, who are called Yligueynes, believed that the heaven and earth had no beginning and that there were two gods, one called Captan and the other Maguayen. They believed that the breeze and the sea were married; and that the land breeze brought forth a reed, which was planted by the god Captan. When the reed grew, it broke into two sections, from which came a man and a woman. To the man they gave the name Silalac, and that is the reason why men from that time on have been called lalac; the woman they named Sicavay, and henceforth women have been called &quot;babaye&quot;...&#x27;

One day the man asked the woman to marry him for there were no other people in the world; but she refused, saying they were brother and sister, born of the same reed, with only one know between them. Finally, they agreed to ask the advice from the tunnies of the sea and from the doves of the earth. They also went to the earthquake, which said that it was necessary for them to marry, so that the world might be peopled.

==== Death ====
The Visayans believed that when the time comes for a person to die, the diwata Pandaki visits him to bring about death. Magwayen, the soul ferry god, carries the souls of the Yligueynes to the abode of the dead called Solad. But when a bad person dies, Pandaki brings him to the place of punishment in the abode of the dead, where his soul will wait to move on to the Ologan or heaven. While the dead is undergoing punishment, his family could help him by asking the priests or priestesses to offer ceremonies and prayers so that he might go to the place of rest in heaven.

==== Shamans ====
The spiritual leaders were called the Babaylan. Most of the &quot;Babaylan&quot; were women who, for some reasons, the colonizers described as &quot;lascivious&quot; and astute. On certain ceremonial occasions, they put on elaborate apparel, which appear bizarre to Spaniards. They would wear yellow false hair, over which some kind of diadem adorn and, in their hands, they wielded straw fans. They were assisted by young apprentices who would carry some thin cane as for a wand.

Notable among the rituals performed by &quot;Babaylan&quot; was the pig sacrifice. Sometimes chicken were also offered. The sacrificial victims were placed on well adorned altars, together with other commodities and with the most exquisite local wine called &quot;Pangasi&quot;. The &quot;Babaylan&quot; would break into dance hovering around these offerings to the sound of drums and brass bells called &quot;Agongs&quot;, with palm leaves and trumpets made of cane. The ritual is called by the Visayans &quot;Pag-aanito&quot;.

Spirits were referred to as &quot;umalagad&quot; (called &quot;anito&quot; in Luzon). These refer to ancestors, past leaders or heroes also transfigured within nature. Beside idols symbolizing the umalagad were food, drinks, clothing, precious valuables or even a sacrificial animal offered for protection of life or property. Such practice was a form of ancestor worship. Furthermore, these rituals surrounding the diwata and umalagad were mediated by the babaylan who were highly revered in society as spiritual leaders. These intercessors were equivalent to shamans, and were predominantly women or were required to have strong female attributes such as hermaphrodites and homosexuals. Old men were also allowed to become one. One notable example is Dios Buhawi who ruled a politico-religious revolt in Negros Oriental at the beginning of the Philippine Revolution.

=== Modern-day Religion ===
According to 2000 survey, 86.53% of the population of Western Visayas professed Roman Catholicism. Aglipayan (4.01%) and Evangelicals (1.48%) were the next largest groups, while 7.71% identified with other religious affiliations.

The same survey showed that 92% of household populations in Central Visayas were Catholics, followed by Aglipayans (2%) and Evangelicals (1%). The remaining 5% belonged to the United Church of Christ in the Philippines, Iglesia ni Cristo, various Protestant denominations or other religions.

For Eastern Visayas, 93% of the total household population were Catholics, while 12% identified as &quot;Aglipayan&quot;, and 1% as &quot;Evangelical&quot;. The remaining 5% belonged to other Protestant denominations (including the Iglesia ni Cristo, the Seventh-day Adventist Church, and various Baptist churches) or identified with Islam and other religions.

The Tausūg people are excluded in these statistics because they do not self-identify as Visayans. The Tausug are overwhelmingy Muslim and are grouped together with other Muslim ethnic groups of the Philippines as the Moro people.

===Festivals===
Visayans are known in the Philippines for their festivities such as the Ati-Atihan, Dinagyang, Pintados-Kasadyaan, Sangyaw, Sinulog festivals. Most Visayan festivals have a strong association with Roman Catholicism despite apparent integration of ancient Hindu-Buddhist-Animist folklore particularly the tradition of dances and the idols in the image of the Child Jesus commonly named as the Santo Niño. The oldest Catholic religious image in the islands still existing today is the Santo Niño de Cebú.

The Sandugo Festival of Tagbilaran, Bohol is a celebration of one of the most significant parts of pre-Philippine history. This festival revolves around the theme of the reenactment of the blood compact between the island&#x27;s monarch, Datu Sikatuna, and the Spanish explorer, Miguel López de Legazpi, which is known among Filipinos as the Sandugo (lit. unified/one blood). The arrival of the ten Bornean datus as mentioned in the legend of Maragtas is celebrated in Binirayan Festival in Antique.

The MassKara Festival of Bacolod, Negros Occidental explores more on the distinct cultural identity of the city. Since Bacolod is tagged as the &quot;City of Smiles&quot; due to its fun-loving and enduring people, the city government inaugurated the festival in 1980 after tragedy struck the region.

===Literature===

Some of the earliest known works were documented by a Spanish Jesuit named Ignacio Francisco Alzina during the Spanish colonial Philippines. Among these literary pieces from ancient Eastern Visayas were &quot;kandu&quot;, &quot;haya&quot;, &quot;ambahan&quot;, &quot;kanogon&quot;, &quot;bikal&quot;, &quot;balak&quot;, &quot;siday&quot; and &quot;awit&quot; which are predominantly in Waray. There were also narratives called &quot;susmaton&quot; and &quot;posong&quot;. It was also described that theater played a central role in performing poetry, rituals and dances. The Western Visayans also shared nearly the same literary forms with the rest of the islands. Among their pre-Hispanic works were called the &quot;bangianay&quot;, &quot;hurobaton&quot;, &quot;paktakun&quot;, &quot;sugidanun&quot; and &quot;amba&quot;. These were all found to be in Old Kinaray-a. Some of the widely known and the only existing literature describing ancient Visayan society are as the Hinilawod and the Maragtas which was in a combination of Kinaray-a and Hiligaynon. The &quot;Aginid: Bayok sa Atong Tawarik&quot; is an epic retelling a portion of ancient Cebu history where the Chola dynasty minor prince Sri Lumay of Sumatra founded and ruled the Rajahnate of Cebu. It also has accounts of Rajah Humabon and Lapu-Lapu.

It was found by Filipino polymath José Rizal in Antonio de Morga&#x27;s &quot;Sucesos delas islas Filipinas&quot; that one of the first documented poets in much of pre-Philippines known to Europeans was a Visayan named &quot;Karyapa&quot;. During the golden age of Philippine languages at the onset of Japanese occupation, numerous Visayan names rose to literary prominence. Acclaimed modern Visayan writers in their respective native languages are Marcel Navarra, the father of modern Cebuano literature, Magdalena Jalandoni, Ramon Muzones, Iluminado Lucente, Francisco Alvardo, Eduardo Makabenta, Norberto Romuáldez, Antonio Abad, Augurio Abeto, Diosdado Alesna, Maragtas S. V. Amante, Epifanio Alfafara, Jose Yap, Leoncio P. Deriada, Conrado Norada, Alex Delos Santos, John Iremil Teodoro and Peter Solis Nery.

Don Ramon Roces of Roces Publishing, Inc. is credited for the promulgation of Visayan languages in publications through &quot;Hiligaynon&quot; and &quot;Bisaya&quot;.

===Cinema, television and theatre===

Visayan films, particularly Cebuano-language ones, experienced a boom between the 1940s and the 1970s. In the mid 1940s alone, a total of 50 Visayan productions were completed, while nearly 80 movies were filmed in the following decade. This wave of success has been bolstered by Gloria Sevilla, billed as the &quot;Queen of Visayan Movies&quot;, who won the prestigious Best Actress award from the 1969 FAMAS for the film &quot;Badlis sa Kinabuhi&quot; and the 1974 &quot;Gimingaw Ako&quot;. Caridad Sanchez, Lorna Mirasol, Chanda Romero, Pilar Pilapil and Suzette Ranillo are some of the industry&#x27;s veterans who gained recognition from working on Visayan films.

The national film and television industries are also supported by actors who have strong Visayan roots such as Joel Torre, Jackie Lou Blanco, Edu Manzano, Manilyn Reynes, Dwight Gaston, Vina Morales, Sheryl Reyes, and Cesar Montano, who starred in the 1999 biographical film &quot;Rizal&quot; and multi-awarded 2004 movie &quot;Panaghoy sa Suba&quot;. Younger actors and actress of Visayan origin or ancestry include Isabel Oli, Kim Chiu, Enrique Gil, Shaina Magdayao, Carla Abellana, Erich Gonzales and Matteo Guidicelli.

Award-winning director Peque Gallaga of Bacolod has garnered acclaim from his most successful movie &quot;Oro, Plata, Mata&quot; which depicted Negros Island and its people during World War II. Among his other works and contributions are classic &quot;Shake, Rattle &amp; Roll&quot; horror film series, &quot;Scorpio Nights&quot; and &quot;Batang X&quot;.

GMA Network&#x27;s 2011 period drama teleserye &quot;Amaya&quot; as well as its 2013 series &quot;Indio&quot;, featured the politics and culture of ancient and colonial Visayan societies, respectively.

===Music===
Traditional Visayan folk music were known to many such as &quot;Dandansoy&quot; originally in Hiligaynon and is now commonly sang in other Bisayan languages. Another, although originally written in Tagalog, is &quot;Waray-Waray&quot;, which speaks of the common stereotypes and positive characteristics of the Waray people. American jazz singer Eartha Kitt also had a rendition of the song in her live performances. A very popular Filipino Christmas carol &quot;Ang Pasko ay Sumapit&quot; translated by Levi Celerio to Tagalog was originally a Cebuano song entitled &quot;Kasadya Ning Taknaa&quot; popularized by Ruben Tagalog.

Contemporary Philippine music was highly influenced and molded through the contributions of many Visayan artists. Many of them are platinum recorder Jose Mari Chan, Pilita Corrales, Dulce, Verni Varga, Susan Fuentes, Jaya and Kuh Ledesma who enjoyed acclaim around the 1960s to the early 1990s. Newer singers are Jed Madela, Sheryn Regis and Sitti Navarro.

Yoyoy Villame, a Boholano, is dubbed as the Father of Filipino novelty songs with his &quot;Butsekik&quot; as the most popular. Villame often collaborated with fellow singer, Max Surban. Joey Ayala, Grace Nono and Bayang Barrios are some of the front-runners of a branching musical subgenre called Neotraditional which involved traditional Filipino instruments with modern rhythm and melody.

Rock emerged into dominance within the Philippine music scene in the 1980s. Among the bands from Visayas are Urbandub and Junior Kilat. Another subgenre also sprung a few years later called BisRock which is a portmanteau of &quot;Bisaya&quot; and &quot;rock&quot;.

===Dance===
Ethnic dances from the region are common in any traditional Filipino setting. Curacha or kuratsa (not to be confused with the Zamboangueño dish) is a popular Waray dance. Its Cebuano counterparts are kuradang and la berde. There is the liki from Negros Occidental and the well-known tinikling of Leyte. Other Hiligaynon dances are the &quot;harito&quot;, &quot;balitaw&quot;, &quot;liay&quot;, &quot;lalong kalong&quot;, &quot;imbong&quot;, &quot;inay-inay&quot; and &quot;binanog&quot;.

===Visual arts===

The only Boholano and the youngest to receive the National Artist of the Philippines award for visual arts is Napoleon Abueva. He is also tagged as the Father of Modern Philippine Sculpture. Among his works are &quot;Kaganapan&quot; (1953), the Transfiguration (1979) and the 14 Stations of the Cross around the EDSA Shrine. He is also responsible for the sculpture of the &quot;Sandugo&quot; monument at Tagbilaran City to give homage to his roots.

A renowned figure in architecture is Leandro Locsin of Silay, Negros Occidental. He was proclaimed as National Artist of the Philippines for architecture in 1990. Locsin worked on many of the buildings in many campuses of the University of the Philippines System. He also designed the main building or the &quot;Tanghalang Pambansa&quot; of the Cultural Center of the Philippines and the Ayala Tower One &amp; Exchange Plaza housing the Philippine Stock Exchange at Makati.

<text>Erich Salomon (28 April 1886 – 7 July 1944) was a German Jewish news photographer known for his pictures in the diplomatic and legal professions and the innovative methods he used to acquire them.
==Life and work==
He was born in Berlin as the son of the wealthy Jewish banker and Royal Councillor of Commerce Emil Salomon (1844–1909) and Therese Salomon née Schüler (1857–1915). The upper-class Berlin family lived at Jägerstraße 29 and later at Tiergartenstraße 15 (today the State Representation of Baden-Württemberg is located here). Salomon studied law, engineering, and zoology up to World War I. He served on the Western Front and was captured by the French in 1914. After the war, he worked in the promotion department of the Ullstein publishing empire designing their billboard advertisements. He first picked up a camera in 1927, when he was 41, to document some legal disputes and soon after hid an Ermanox camera usable in dim light in his bowler hat. By cutting a hole in the hat for the lens, Salomon snapped a photo of a police killer on trial in a Berlin criminal court.

Beginning in 1928, Salomon worked for Ullstein&#x27;s &quot;Berliner Illustrirte Zeitung&quot; as a photographer. With his multilingual ability and clever concealment, his reputation soared among the people of Europe. When the Kellogg-Briand Pact was signed in 1928, Salomon walked into the signing room and took the vacant seat of the Polish delegate, and took several photos.

Salomon photographed the passage to Ellis Island, the route that was frequently traveled by migrants to the United States as Ellis Island at the time was a detention and immigration centre. Salomon is one of only two known persons to have photographed a session of the U.S. Supreme Court.

After Adolf Hitler came to power in Nazi Germany, Salomon fled to the Netherlands with his wife and continued his photographic career in The Hague. Salomon declined an invitation from &quot;Life&quot; magazine to move to the United States. He and his family were trapped in the Low Countries after Germany invaded in 1940. Salomon and his family were held in the Westerbork transit camp, then for almost five months in Theresienstadt concentration camp and were deported from there to the Theresienstadt family camp in May 1944. He and his wife were murdered in Auschwitz on 7 July 1944.

The Dr. Erich Salomon Award is a lifetime achievement award for photojournalists given by the German society for photography.

In 1978 Salomon was inducted into the International Photography Hall of Fame and Museum.

<doc id="360725" wikidata="Q375613" url="?curid=360725" title="Acetylcysteine">
<text>&quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine, also known as Acetylcysteine and NAC, is a medication that is used to treat paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose and to loosen thick mucus in individuals with chronic bronchopulmonary disorders, such as pneumonia and bronchitis. It has been used to treat lactobezoar in infants. It can be taken intravenously, orally (swallowed by mouth), or inhaled as a mist by use of a nebulizer. It is also sometimes used as a dietary supplement.
Common side effects include nausea and vomiting when taken orally. The skin may occasionally become red and itchy with any route of administration. A non-immune type of anaphylaxis may also occur. It appears to be safe in pregnancy. For paracetamol overdose, it works by increasing the level of glutathione, an antioxidant that can neutralize the toxic breakdown products of paracetamol. When inhaled, it acts as a mucolytic by decreasing the thickness of mucus.
Acetylcysteine was initially patented in 1960 and came into medical use in 1968. It is on the World Health Organization&#x27;s List of Essential Medicines. It is available as a generic medication.
The sulfur-containing amino acids cysteine and methionine are more easily oxidized than the other amino acids.

== Uses ==
=== Medical uses ===

====Paracetamol overdose antidote====

Intravenous and oral formulations of acetylcysteine are available for the treatment of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose. When paracetamol is taken in large quantities, a minor metabolite called &quot;N&quot;-acetyl-&quot;p&quot;-benzoquinone imine (NAPQI) accumulates within the body. It is normally conjugated by glutathione, but when taken in excess, the body&#x27;s glutathione reserves are not sufficient to deactivate the toxic NAPQI. This metabolite is then free to react with key hepatic enzymes, thereby damaging liver cells. This may lead to severe liver damage and even death by acute liver failure.

In the treatment of paracetamol (acetaminophen) overdose, acetylcysteine acts to maintain or replenish depleted glutathione reserves in the liver and enhance non-toxic metabolism of acetaminophen. These actions serve to protect liver cells from NAPQI toxicity. It is most effective in preventing or lessening hepatic injury when administered within 8–10 hours after overdose. Research suggests that the rate of liver toxicity is approximately 3% when acetylcysteine is administered within 10 hours of overdose.

Although IV and oral acetylcysteine are equally effective for this indication, oral administration is generally poorly tolerated due to the higher dosing required to overcome its low oral bioavailability, its foul taste and odor, and a higher incidence of adverse effects when taken orally, particularly nausea and vomiting. Prior pharmacokinetic studies of acetylcysteine did not consider acetylation as a reason for the low bioavailability of acetylcysteine. Oral acetylcysteine is identical in bioavailability to cysteine precursors. However, 3% to 6% of people given intravenous acetylcysteine show a severe, anaphylaxis-like allergic reaction, which may include extreme breathing difficulty (due to bronchospasm), a decrease in blood pressure, rash, angioedema, and sometimes also nausea and vomiting. Repeated doses of intravenous acetylcysteine will cause these allergic reactions to progressively worsen in these people.

Several studies have found this anaphylaxis-like reaction to occur more often in people given intravenous acetylcysteine despite serum levels of paracetamol not high enough to be considered toxic.

====Mucolytic agent====
Acetylcysteine exhibits mucolytic properties, meaning it reduces the viscosity and adhesiveness of mucus. This therapeutic effect is achieved through the cleavage of disulfide bonds within mucoproteins (strongly cross-linked mucins), thereby decreasing the mucus viscosity and facilitating its clearance from the respiratory tract. This mechanism is particularly beneficial in conditions characterized by excessive or thickened mucus, such as chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), cystic fibrosis, rhinitis or sinusitis. Acetylcysteine can be administered as a part of a complex molecule, Thiamphenicol glycinate acetylcysteine, which also contains thiamphenicol, an antibiotic.

=====Lungs=====
Inhaled acetylcysteine has been used for mucolytic therapy in addition to other therapies in respiratory conditions with excessive and/or thick mucus production. It is also used post-operatively, as a diagnostic aid, and in tracheotomy care. It may be considered ineffective in cystic fibrosis. A 2013 Cochrane review in cystic fibrosis found no evidence of benefit.

Acetylcysteine is used in the treatment of obstructive lung disease as an adjuvant treatment.

===Other uses===
Acetylcysteine has been used to complex palladium, to help it dissolve in water. This helps to remove palladium from drugs or precursors synthesized by palladium-catalyzed coupling reactions. &quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine can be used to protect the liver.

====Microbiological use====
Acetylcysteine can be used in Petroff&#x27;s method of liquefaction and decontamination of sputum, in preparation for recovery of mycobacterium. It also displays significant antiviral activity against influenza A viruses.

Acetylcysteine has bactericidal properties and breaks down bacterial biofilms of clinically relevant pathogens including &quot;Pseudomonas aeruginosa&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus aureus&quot;, &quot;Enterococcus faecalis&quot;, &quot;Enterobacter cloacae&quot;, &quot;Staphylococcus epidermidis&quot;, and &quot;Klebsiella pneumoniae&quot;.

==Side effects==
The most commonly reported adverse effects for IV formulations of acetylcysteine are rash, urticaria, and itchiness.

Adverse effects for inhalational formulations of acetylcysteine include nausea, vomiting, stomatitis, fever, rhinorrhea, drowsiness, clamminess, chest tightness, and bronchoconstriction. Although infrequent, bronchospasm has been reported to occur unpredictably in some patients.

Adverse effects for oral formulations of acetylcysteine have been reported to include nausea, vomiting, rash, and fever.

Large doses in a mouse model showed that acetylcysteine could potentially cause damage to the heart and lungs. They found that acetylcysteine was metabolized to &quot;S&quot;-nitroso-&quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine (), which increased blood pressure in the lungs and right ventricle of the heart (pulmonary artery hypertension) in mice treated with acetylcysteine. The effect was similar to that observed following a 3-week exposure to an oxygen-deprived environment (chronic hypoxia). The authors also found that SNOAC induced a hypoxia-like response in the expression of several important genes both &quot;in vitro&quot; and &quot;in vivo&quot;. The implications of these findings for long-term treatment with acetylcysteine have not yet been investigated. The dose used by Palmer and colleagues was dramatically higher than that used in humans, the equivalent of about 20 grams per day. In humans, much lower dosages (600 mg per day) have been observed to counteract some age-related decline in the hypoxic ventilatory response as tested by inducing prolonged hypoxia.

Although &quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine prevented liver damage in mice when taken before alcohol, when taken four hours after alcohol it made liver damage worse in a dose-dependent fashion.

==Pharmacology==

===Pharmacodynamics===
Acetylcysteine serves as a prodrug to -cysteine, a precursor to the biologic antioxidant glutathione. Hence administration of acetylcysteine replenishes glutathione stores.
* Glutathione, along with oxidized glutathione (GSSG) and &quot;S&quot;-nitrosoglutathione (GSNO), have been found to bind to the glutamate recognition site of the NMDA and AMPA receptors (via their γ-glutamyl moieties), and may be endogenous neuromodulators. At millimolar concentrations, they may also modulate the redox state of the NMDA receptor complex. In addition, glutathione has been found to bind to and activate ionotropic receptors that are different from any other excitatory amino acid receptor, and which may constitute &quot;glutathione receptors&quot;, potentially making it a neurotransmitter. As such, since &quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine is a prodrug of glutathione, it may modulate all of the aforementioned receptors as well.
* Glutathione also modulates the NMDA receptor by acting at the redox site.

L-cysteine also serves as a precursor to cystine, which in turn serves as a substrate for the cystine-glutamate antiporter on astrocytes; hence there is increasing glutamate release into the extracellular space. This glutamate in turn acts on mGluR2/3 receptors, and at higher doses of acetylcysteine, mGluR5. Acetylcysteine may have other biological functions in the brain, such as the modulation of dopamine release and the reduction in inflammatory cytokine formation possibly via inhibiting NF-κB and modulating cytokine synthesis. These properties, along with the reduction of oxidative stress and the re-establishment of glutamatergic balance, would lead to an increase in growth factors, such as brain-derived neurotrophic factor (BDNF), and the regulation of neuronal cell death through B-cell lymphoma 2 expression (BLC-2).

===Pharmacokinetics===
The oral bioavailability of acetylcysteine is relatively low due to extensive first-pass metabolism in the gut wall and liver. It ranges between 6% and 10%.

Intravenous administration of acetylcysteine bypasses the first-pass metabolism, resulting in higher bioavailability compared to oral administration. Intravenous administration of acetylcysteine ensures nearly 100% bioavailability as it directly enters the bloodstream.

Acetylcysteine is extensively liver metabolized, CYP450 minimal, urine excretion is 22–30% with a half-life of 5.6 hours in adults and 11 hours in newborns.

Acetylcysteine is the &quot;N&quot;-acetyl derivative of the amino acid -cysteine, and is a precursor in the formation of the antioxidant glutathione in the body. The thiol (sulfhydryl) group confers antioxidant effects and is able to reduce free radicals.

==Chemistry==
Pure acetylcysteine is in a solid state at room temperature, appearing as a white crystalline powder or granules. The solid form of acetylcysteine is stable under normal conditions, but it can undergo oxidation if exposed to air or moisture over time, leading to the formation of its dimeric form, diacetylcysteine, which can have different properties. Acetylcysteine is highly hygroscopic, i.e., it absorbs moisture if exposed to open air.

Acetylcysteine can sometimes appear as a light yellow cast powder instead of pure white due to oxidation. The sulfur-containing amino acids, like cysteine, are more easily oxidized than other amino acids. When exposed to air or moisture, acetylcysteine can oxidize, leading to a slight yellowish tint.

Acetylcysteine in a form of a white or white with light yellow cast powder has a p&quot;K&quot;a of 9.5 at 30 °C.

&quot;N&quot;-acetyl--cysteine is soluble in water and alcohol, and practically insoluble in chloroform and ether.

Acetylcysteine is highly soluble in water: it dissolves readily in water, forming a clear solution. The pH of a maximum-saturated acetylcysteine solution typically ranges between 6.0 and 7.5, depending on temperature, purity of the compound, presence of other ions (that can affect the pH by interacting with acetylcysteine or altering the overall ionic strength of the solution), thus on the concentration of acetylcysteine itself: higher concentrations of acetylcysteine can lead to a lower pH due to the increased presence of the acetylcysteine molecule itself. This range of pH between 6.0 and 7.5 ensures that the solution is neither too acidic nor too alkaline, making it suitable for various medical applications. Aqueous solutions of acetylcysteine are compatible with 0.9% sodium chloride solution; compatibility with 5% and 10% glucose solutions is also good.

As for the sunlight stability, acetylcysteine in dry powder form is relatively stable and does not degrade quickly when exposed to sunlight, but when dissolved in aqueous solution, acetylcysteine can degrade when exposed to sunlight, especially if the solution is not stored in a dark, cool place. Besides that, acetylcysteine in aqueous solution can undergo hydrolysis, leading to the breakdown of the amide bond in the molecule. Still, aqueous solutions of acetylcysteine are generally stable when stored properly: the solutions should be kept in tightly sealed containers and stored at controlled room temperature to prolong the stability.

==Society and culture==
Acetylcysteine was first studied as a drug in 1963. Amazon removed acetylcysteine for sale in the US in 2021, due to claims by the FDA of it being classified as a drug rather than a supplement. In April 2022, the FDA released draft guidance on FDA&#x27;s policy regarding products labeled as dietary supplements that contain &quot;N&quot;-acetyl--cysteine. Amazon subsequently re-listed NAC products as of August 2022.

==Research==
While many antioxidants have been researched to treat a large number of diseases by reducing the negative effect of oxidative stress, acetylcysteine is one of the few that has yielded promising results, and is currently already approved for the treatment of paracetamol overdose.
* In mouse mdx models of Duchenne&#x27;s muscular dystrophy, treatment with 1–2% acetylcysteine in drinking water significantly reduces muscle damage and improves strength.
* It is being studied in conditions such as autism, where cysteine and related sulfur amino acids may be depleted due to multifactorial dysfunction of methylation pathways involved in methionine catabolism.
* Animal studies have also demonstrated its efficacy in reducing the damage associated with moderate traumatic brain or spinal injury, and also ischaemia-induced brain injury. In particular, it has been demonstrated to reduce neuronal losses and to improve cognitive and neurological outcomes associated with these traumatic events.
* Research on acetylcysteine usage seems to show a positive efficiency in treating androgenetic alopecia (male baldness), with or without adjacent treatments such as the use of topical minoxidil solution.
* Research on mouse models also shows that acetylcysteine could be &quot;used as an efficient and safe therapeutic option for hair loss induced by chemotherapy&quot;.
* It has been suggested that acetylcysteine may help people with aspirin-exacerbated respiratory disease by increasing levels of glutathione allowing faster breakdown of salicylates, although there is no evidence that it is of benefit.
* Small studies have shown acetylcysteine to be of benefit to people with blepharitis. It has been shown to reduce ocular soreness caused by Sjögren&#x27;s syndrome.
* Research has found that acetylcysteine may have otoprotective properties and could potentially be useful for preventing hearing loss and tinnitus in some cases. A 2011 study showed that &quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine may protect the human cochlea from subclinical hearing loss caused by loud noises such as impulse noise. In animal models, it reduced age-related hearing loss.
* It has been shown effective in the treatment of Unverricht-Lundborg disease in an open trial in four patients. A marked decrease in myoclonus and some normalization of somatosensory evoked potentials with acetylcysteine treatment has been documented.
* Addiction to certain addictive drugs (including cocaine, heroin, alcohol, and nicotine) is correlated with a persistent reduction in the expression of excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2) in the nucleus accumbens (NAcc); the reduced expression of EAAT2 in this region is implicated in addictive drug-seeking behavior. In particular, the long-term dysregulation of glutamate neurotransmission in the NAcc of long-term, drug-dependent users is associated with an increase in vulnerability to relapse after re-exposure to the addictive drug or its associated drug cues. Drugs that help to normalize the expression of EAAT2 in this region, such as &quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine, have been proposed as an adjunct therapy for the treatment of addiction to cocaine, nicotine, alcohol, and other drugs.
* It has been tested for the reduction of hangover symptoms, though the overall results indicate very limited efficacy.
* A double-blind placebo controlled trial of 262 patients has shown NAC treatment was well-tolerated and resulted in a significant decrease in the frequency of influenza-like episodes, severity, and length of time confined to bed.

===Kidney and bladder===
&quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine has been widely believed to prevent adverse effects of long term Ketamine use on the bladder and kidneys, and there is growing body of evidence to support this.

Evidence for the benefit of acetylcysteine to prevent radiocontrast induced kidney disease is mixed.

Acetylcysteine has been used for cyclophosphamide-induced haemorrhagic cystitis, although mesna is generally preferred due to the ability of acetylcysteine to diminish the effectiveness of cyclophosphamide.

===Psychiatry===
Acetylcysteine has been studied for major psychiatric disorders, including bipolar disorder, major depressive disorder, and schizophrenia.

Tentative evidence exists for &quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine also in the treatment of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease, autism, obsessive-compulsive disorder, specific drug addictions (cocaine), drug-induced neuropathy, trichotillomania, excoriation disorder, and a certain form of epilepsy (progressive myoclonic). Preliminary evidence showed efficacy in anxiety disorder, attention deficit hyperactivity disorder and mild traumatic brain injury although confirmatory studies are required. Tentative evidence also supports use in cannabis use disorder.

It is also being studied for use as a treatment of body-focused repetitive behavior.

====Addiction====
Evidence to date does not support the efficacy for &quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine in treating addictions to gambling, methamphetamine, or nicotine. Based upon limited evidence, NAC appears to normalize glutamate neurotransmission in the nucleus accumbens and other brain structures, in part by upregulating the expression of excitatory amino acid transporter 2 (EAAT2), glutamate transporter 1 (GLT1), in individuals with addiction. While NAC has been demonstrated to modulate glutamate neurotransmission in adult humans who are addicted to cocaine, NAC does not appear to modulate glutamate neurotransmission in healthy adult humans. NAC has been hypothesized to exert beneficial effects through its modulation of glutamate and dopamine neurotransmission as well as its antioxidant properties.

====Bipolar disorder====
In bipolar disorder, &quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine has been repurposed as an augmentation strategy for depressive episodes in light of the possible role of inflammation in the pathogenesis of mood disorders. Nonetheless, meta-analytic evidence shows that add-on &quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine was more effective than placebo only in reducing depression scales scores (low quality evidence), without positive effects on response and remission outcomes, limiting its possible role in clinical practice to date.

=== COVID-19 ===
Acetylcysteine has been studied as a possible treatment for COVID-19, but has not improved patient outcomes by common measures.

A combination of guanfacine and &quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine has been found to lift the &quot;brain fog&quot; of eight patients with long COVID, according to researchers, but the results are inconclusive and have not been confirmed by other studies.

A combination of glycine and &quot;N&quot;-acetylcysteine is suspected to have potential to safely replenish depleted glutathione levels in COVID-19 patients.

It can be adjusted to display the visible stars for any time and date. It is an instrument to assist in learning how to recognize stars and constellations. The astrolabe, an instrument that has its origins in Hellenistic astronomy, is a predecessor of the modern planisphere.
The term &quot;planisphere&quot; contrasts with &quot;armillary sphere&quot;, where the celestial sphere is represented by a three-dimensional framework of rings.

==Description==
A planisphere consists of a circular star chart attached at its center to an opaque circular overlay that has a clear window or hole so that only a portion of the sky map will be visible in the window or hole area at any given time. The chart and overlay are mounted so that they are free to rotate about a common axis. The star chart contains the brightest stars, constellations and (possibly) deep-sky objects visible from a particular latitude on Earth. The night sky that one sees from the Earth depends on whether the observer is in the northern or southern hemispheres and the latitude. A planisphere window is designed for a particular latitude and will be accurate enough for a certain band either side of that. Planisphere makers will usually offer them in a number of versions for different latitudes. Planispheres only show the stars visible from the observer&#x27;s latitude; stars below the horizon are not included.

A complete twenty-four-hour time cycle is marked on the rim of the overlay. A full twelve months of calendar dates are marked on the rim of the starchart. The window is marked to show the direction of the eastern and western horizons. The disk and overlay are adjusted so that the observer&#x27;s local time of day on the overlay corresponds to that day&#x27;s date on the star chart disc. The portion of the star chart visible in the window then represents (with a distortion because it is a flat surface representing a spherical volume) the distribution of stars in the sky at that moment for the planisphere&#x27;s designed location. Users hold the planisphere above their head with the eastern and western horizons correctly aligned to match the chart to actual star positions.

==History==

The word planisphere (Latin &quot;planisphaerium&quot;) was originally used in the second century by Claudius Ptolemy to describe the representation of a spherical Earth by a map drawn in the plane.
This usage continued into the Renaissance: for example Gerardus Mercator described his 1569 world map as a planisphere.

In this article the word describes the representation of the star-filled celestial sphere on a flat disc.
The first star chart to have the name &quot;planisphere&quot; was made in 1624 by Jacob Bartsch.
Bartsch was the son-in-law of Johannes Kepler, discoverer of Kepler&#x27;s laws of planetary motion.

==The star chart==
Since the planisphere shows the celestial sphere in a printed flat, there is always considerable distortion. Planispheres, like all charts, are made using a certain projection method. For planispheres there are two major methods in use, leaving the choice with the designer. One such method is the polar azimuthal equidistant projection. Using this projection the sky is charted centered on one of the celestial poles (polar), while circles of equal declination (for instance 60°, 30°, 0° (the celestial equator), −30°, and −60°) lie equidistant from each other and from the poles (equidistant). The shapes of the constellations are proportionally correct in a straight line from the centre outwards, but at right angles to this direction (parallel to the declination circles) there is considerable distortion. That distortion will be worse as the distance to the pole gets greater. If we study the famous constellation of Orion in this projection and compare this to the real Orion, we can clearly see this distortion. One notable planisphere using azimuthal equidistant projection addresses this issue by printing a northern view on one side and the southern view on the other, thus reducing the distance charted from the center outward.

The stereographic projection solves this problem while introducing another. Using this projection the distances between the declination circles are enlarged in such a way that the shapes of the constellations remain correct. Naturally in this projection the constellations on the edge become too large in comparison to constellations near the celestial pole: Orion will be twice as high as it should be. (This is the same effect that makes Greenland so huge in Mercator maps.) Another disadvantage is that, with more space for constellations near the edge of the planisphere, the space for the constellations around the celestial pole in question will be less than they deserve. For observers at moderate latitudes, who can see the sky near the celestial pole of their hemisphere better than that nearer the horizon, this may be a good reason to prefer a planisphere made with the polar azimuthal equidistant projection method.

==The upper disc==
The upper disc contains a &quot;horizon&quot;, that defines the visible part of the sky at any given moment, which is naturally half of the total starry sky. That horizon line is most of the time also distorted, for the same reason the constellations are distorted.
The horizon line on a stereographic projection is a perfect circle.
The horizon line on other projections is a kind of &quot;collapsed&quot; oval.
The horizon is designed for a particular latitude and thus determines the area for which a planisphere is meant. Some more expensive planispheres have several upper discs that can be exchanged, or have an upper disc with more horizon-lines, for different latitudes.

When a planisphere is used in a latitude zone other than the zone for which it was designed, the user will either see stars that are not in the planisphere, or the planisphere will show stars that are not visible in that latitude zone&#x27;s sky. To study the starry sky thoroughly it may be necessary to buy a planisphere particularly for the area in question.

However, most of the time the part of the sky near the horizon will not show many stars, due to hills, woods, buildings or just because of the thickness of the atmosphere we look through. The lower 5° above the horizon in particular hardly shows any stars (let alone objects) except under the very best conditions. Therefore, a planisphere can fairly accurately be used from +5° to −5° of the design latitude. For example, a planisphere for 40° north can be used between 35° and 45° north.

==Coordinates==
Accurate planispheres represent the celestial coordinates: right ascension and declination. The changing positions of planets, asteroids or comets in terms of these coordinates can be looked up in annual astronomical guides, and these enable planisphere users to find them in the sky.

Some planispheres use a separate pointer for the declination, using the same pivot point as the upper disc. Some planispheres have a declination feature printed on the upper disc, along the line connecting north and south on the horizon. Right ascension is represented on the edge, where the dates with which to set the planisphere are also found.

<text>(, rendered as &quot;Commissioner of the Empire&quot;, &quot;Reich Commissioner&quot; or &quot;Imperial Commissioner&quot;), in German history, was an official governatorial title used for various public offices during the period of the German Empire and Nazi Germany.

==German Empire==
===Domestic===
In the unified German Empire (after 1871), Reichskommissars were appointed to oversee special tasks. For instance, there was a Reichskommissar for emigration (&quot;Reichskommissar für das Auswanderungswesen&quot;) in Hamburg.

Presumably the same title is rendered as &quot;German Imperial Commissioner&quot; in the case of Heligoland, a strategically located once-Danish island in the North Sea, formally handed over to Germany by the UK on 9 August 1890 (under the Heligoland–Zanzibar Treaty) and on 15 December 1890 formally annexed to Germany (after 18 February 1891 part of the Prussian province of Schleswig-Holstein): 9 August 1890 – 1891 Adolf Wermuth (b. 1855 – d. 1927)

===Colonial===
The title of &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; was used during the German Empire for the governors of most of the &quot;Schutzgebiete&quot; (a German term literally meaning protectorate, but also applied to ordinary colonies).

====In West Africa====
* in &quot;Kamerun&quot; (modern-day Cameroon) * Reichskommissare (Commissioners)
**14 July 1884 – 19 July 1884 Gustav Nachtigal (b. 1834 – d. 1885)
**19 July 1884 – 1 April 1885 Maximilian Buchner (acting) (b. 1846 – d. 1921)
**1 April 1885 – 4 July 1885 Eduard von Knorr (acting) (b. 1840 – d. 1920); next came a list of governors until 4 March 1916 when *
*in Togo the Reich Reichskommissare since 5 July 1884 proclamation of the Togoland protectorate:
** 5 July 1884 – 6 July 1884 Gustav Nachtigal (b. 1834 – d. 1885), the Reichskommissar for West Africa *
**6 July 1884 – 26 June 1885 Heinrich Randad, the provisional Consul
**26 June 1885 – May 1887 Ernst Falkenthal (b. 1858 – d. 1911)
**July 1887 – 17 October 1888 Jesko von Puttkamer (acting) (1st time) (b. 1855 – d. 1917)
**17 October 1888 – 14 April 1891 Eugen von Zimmerer (b. 1843 – d. 1918)
**14 April 1891 – 4 June 1892 Vacant
**4 June 1892 – November 1893 Jesko von Puttkamer (2nd time); the same stayed on as the first of two &quot;Landeshauptleute&quot; (&#x27;Land captains&#x27;), until 13 August 1895; the second (18 November 1895 – 18 April 1898 August Köhler, b. 1858 – d. 1902) was also the first of the Governors (since 1 January 1905 as German colony of Togoland, until the British conquered it August 1914)

==== German South-West Africa ====
*from 24 April 1884 as German South West Africa protectorate, only incumbent (7 October 1884 – May 1885) Gustav Nachtigal (b. 1834 – d. 1885; &quot;see above&quot;), staying on shortly for the status transition
*from 30 April 1885 – 1889 under the rule of the private German South West Africa Colonial Company (&quot;Deutsche Kolonialgesellschaft für Südwest-Afrika&quot;), only incumbent (May 1885 – August 1890): Heinrich Ernst Göring (acting) (b. 1839 – d. 1913)
* again as imperial protectorate (?)
**first the abovementioned Heinrich Ernst Göring, de facto staying on
**August 1890 – March 1891 Louis Nels (acting) (b. 1855 – d. 1910)
**March 1891 – November 1893 Curt von François (b. 1852 – d. 1931), who stayed on when the country was declared on 14 September 1892 the German crown colony of South West Africa, and later again as the first of two Landeshauptleute (&quot;captains of the territory&quot;)

====In East Africa====
* in Tanganyika, the area acquired on 17 February 1885 by Carl Peters for the &quot;Deutsch-Ostafrikanische Gesellschaft&quot; (DOAG, &#x27;German East Africa Company&#x27;, that was initially under an Administrator: 27 May 1885 – 8 February 1888 Karl Peters), since the proclamation of the German East African protectorate (7 May 1885 – 1 July 1890) over Witu in Kenya; contested by Britain; on 28 April 1888 Germany obtains a lease of the coastal strip from the Sultan of Zanzibar), a single &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; is appointed (8 February 1888 – 21 February 1891: Hermann von Wissmann (b. 1853 – d. 1905), after him Governors of 1 January 1891 when proclaimed German East Africa colony (&quot;Deutsch Ostafrika&quot;), ending the &#x27;private&#x27; DOAG rule.

====In Oceania====
*Nauru, since 21 October 1887 a German protectorate, was under the following &quot;Reichskommissare&quot;:
**1886 – 1887 Wilhelm Knappe (b. 1855 – d. 1910)
**1888 – 1889 Franz Leopold Sonnenschein (b. 1857 – d. 1897); next, as it was since 14 April 1888 administratively part of the (German) Marshall Islands, it had mere Bezirksamtleute (District officers; 2 October 1888 – 1906), then, being since 1 April 1906 administratively part of German New Guinea, Stationsleiter (&#x27;Station Chiefs&#x27;; from 1911, subordinated to the administrators of Ponape district) until 6 November 1914, finally the island was lost (Australian administration, first by a military Commander, then under League of Nations mandate)

==Nazi Germany==
The title of &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; was given by Adolf Hitler to a number of Nazi governors, mainly in several occupied countries during World War II, but also before the war to reintegrate former Prussian territory regained from France, as well as various other regions inhabited by ethnic Germans. Depending on circumstances they could be severely dictatorial and repressive, most notably Erich Koch in Ukraine.

===Domestic &amp; annexed (ethnically German)===

====Saar Territory====
A plebiscite was held in the Territory of the Saar Basin (presently Saarland) on 13 January 1935: 90.3% of those voting wished to join Germany rather than join France. Josef Bürckel (b. 1895 – d. 1944) was appointed on 1 March 1935 as &quot;Reichskommissar für die Rückgliederung des Saarlandes&quot;, then changed his style from 17 June 1936 to &quot;Reichskommissar für das Saarland&quot;, and from 8 April 1940 to &quot;Reichskommissar für die Saarpfalz&quot;; finally from 11 March 1941, he was made &quot;Reichsstatthalter in der &quot;Westmark&quot;&quot; (the region&#x27;s new name, meaning &quot;Western March or Border&quot;), until his death on 28 September 1944 when he was succeeded by Willi Stöhr (b. 1903 also NSDAP), who remained in office until 21 March 1945.

====Sudetenland====
After the Sudetenland region of Czechoslovakia was annexed by Germany on 1 October 1938, it was under a Military governor (Wilhelm Keitel; 1 October 1938 – 20 October 1938), until Konrad Henlein was appointed Reichskommissar of the territories on 21 October 1938. On 1 May 1939 a regular &#x27;domestic&#x27; &quot;Reichsgau&quot;, &quot;Reichsgau Sudetenland&quot; was created; Henlein stayed on as Reichsstatthalter until the region was re-incorporated into Czechoslovakia on 4 May 1945.

====Vienna====
1 May 1939 – 1 April 1940 Josef Bürckel (b. 1895 – d. 1944) NSDAP, in fact the maintained last Austrian Premier of 15 October 1938 constituted metropolitan capital city-entity Gross-Wien (Greater Vienna), is in transitional office, then the same is made the first of two &quot;Reichsstatthalter&quot; (he until 10 August 1940), equivalent to a Gauleiter in Germany proper.

===Northern and Western Europe===

====Norway====

After the Norwegian king and his government fled during the German invasion of the country and the failure of a coup d&#x27;état by the fascist politician Vidkun Quisling, Hitler appointed a (Reich Commissioner for the occupied Norwegian territories) on 24 April 1940. The office had two consecutive Reichskommissars with extensive authority:
*24 April 1940 – 7 May 1945 – Josef Terboven, NSDAP. He took up residence in the Crown Prince&#x27;s manor at Skaugum. Answerable only to Hitler, Terboven initially tried to negotiate with the Norwegian Storting to establish a civilian administration which would be willing to sign a peace treaty with Germany. After the collapse of these negotiations, Terboven on 25 September 1940 proclaimed the deposition of King Haakon VII and his cabinet-in-exile and outlawed all political parties except the Norwegian fascist party Nasjonal Samling. Terboven committed suicide during the night of 7 May 1945, just before the surrender of the German forces in Norway became effective.
*7 May 1945 – 8 May 1945 – Franz Böhme, commander-in-chief of German military forces in Norway, assumed Terboven&#x27;s responsibilities as acting Reichskommissar until Allied forces took control and had him arrested.

====Netherlands====

After the German invasion of the country and the Dutch government and crown&#x27;s evacuation and exile, the Netherlands was placed under the command of two successive military governors:
*10 May 1940 – 20 May 1940 – Fedor von Bock
*20 May 1940 – 29 May 1940 – Alexander von Falkenhausen 
The governorship was succeeded by a more permanent civil administration led by (Reich Commissioner for the occupied Dutch territories):
*29 May 1940 – 5 May 1945 – Arthur Seyss-Inquart, NSDAP

====Belgium and Northern France====
Belgium was initially placed under a &quot;Militärverwaltung&quot;, headed by military governors. The country was joined administratively to &quot;North France&quot;, i.e. the adjacent French départements &quot;Nord&quot; and &quot;Pas-de-Calais&quot;. This was done both for security reasons and geopolitical ideology of expansionism: the area was to be used as a staging ground in an expected invasion of Britain, but also in order to prepare a future &quot;re-claim&quot; of French Flanders in Northern France as a historic part of Germanic Flanders. The Military Administration in Belgium and Northern France had two successive governors:
*10 May 1940 – 1 June 1940 – Gerd von Rundstedt and Fedor von Bock 
*1 June 1940 – 18 July 1944 – Alexander Freiherr von Falkenhausen

This situation continued until July 1944, when a was appointed: 
*18 July 1944 – January 1945 – Joseph Grohé NSDAP

In December 1944, when the Allies had already liberated virtually all of Belgium, its territory was split up into three &quot;Gau&quot;-type entities as integral (&quot;Germanic&quot;) parts of the Reich: the bi-cultural Belgian capital Brussels remained directly under the German as the District of Brussels, but the bulk of the country was divided ethno-linguistically and placed under collaborating Belgian fascist party leaders (on paper) as Gauleiters and with Führer-imitating titles in their national languages:

Gauleiter of &quot;Reichsgau Flandern&quot; (Flanders) supposedly including French Flanders in Allied-liberated North France, and National leader of the Flemish People () as well as &quot;Head of the Flemish Liberation Committee&quot; ():
*15 December 1944 – 1945 – Jef Van de Wiele (in Germany in exile; head of the Devlag party)

Gauleiter of &quot;Reichsgau Wallonien&quot; (Wallonia, and Leader of the Walloon People ():
*8 December 1944 – 1945 – Léon Degrelle (also remained in Germany in exile, even though German troops reconquered part of Wallonia in December 1944 – January 1945); head of the Rexist Party)

===Soviet territories===
Before the beginning of Operation Barbarossa (the eastern front campaign against the Soviet Union) on 22 June 1941, the Nazi ideologist Alfred Rosenberg suggested the administrative division of conquered Soviet territory in the following &quot;Reichskommissariats&quot;, only the first two of which would become reality through military success: 
*&quot;Ostland&quot; (the Baltic countries, Belarus, and adjacent parts of Western Russia);
*&quot;Ukraine&quot; (Ukraine and the northern parts of Southern Russia);
*&quot;Kaukasien&quot; (the Caucasus and the southern parts of Southern Russia);
*&quot;Moskowien&quot; (Moscow metropolitan area and the rest of nearest Russian European areas);
*&quot;Turkestan&quot; (the Central Asian Soviet republics, ethnically mainly Turkic).

This suggested an intention to destroy Russia as a political entity, as the Nazis organised the areas adjacent to Greater Germany&#x27;s eastern provinces in accordance with the geopolitical &quot;Lebensraum&quot; idea (&quot;Drang nach Osten&quot;), to benefit future &quot;Aryan&quot; generations. When German forces entered Soviet territory, they immediately implemented this administrative plan instating the Reichskommissariat of &quot;Ostland&quot; in the Baltic lands and &quot;Ukraine&quot; in Ukraine, headed by Hinrich Lohse and Erich Koch respectively. These administrators put in practice the intended measures during the whole of their administrative period, until 1943–44, when the Germans after the Battle of Kursk were gradually driven out by force.

====Ostland====

On 17 July 1941, the Reichskommissariat Ostland (&quot;Eastland&quot;) was established, soon uniting German-occupied Lithuania, Latvia (from 1 September 1941) and Estonia (from 5 December 1941) and Belarus. Ostland was organized into four General Districts (&quot;Generalbezirke&quot;); only the (Latvian) capital city of Riga (&quot;Gebiet Riga Stadt&quot;) was directly administered by the &quot;Reichskommissar für das Ostland&quot;. The incumbents were: 
*17 July 1941 – 26 September 1944 – Hinrich Lohse (b. 1896 – d. 1964), NSDAP
*26 September 1944 – 2 February 1945 – Erich Koch (b. 1896 – d. 1986), NSDAP (de facto ousted on 13 October 1944 when the Soviet Red Army took Riga, although Ostland wasn&#x27;t officially dissolved until 2 February 1945)

====Ukraine====

The territory in Ukraine occupied by Germany since 25 June 1941 initially fell under a military governor: 
*25 June 1941 – 31 August 1941 – Gerd von Rundstedt (b. 1875 – d. 1953)

The Reichskommissariat Ukraine was established on 20 August 1941, under a &quot;Reichskommissar für die Ukraine&quot;. The incumbents were:
*20 August 1941 – 6 October 1943 – Erich Koch (b. 1896 – d. 1986), NSDAP
*1942 – 30 September 1943 – Paul Dargel (acting for Koch) (b. 1903 – d. 19..), NSDAP
*October 1943 – 1944 – Curt von Gottberg (b. 1896 – d. 1945), NSDAP

====Moskowien====

Central Russia was never brought under sufficient German control to permit its transfer to civilian administration, but a designated &quot;Reichskommissar für Moskowien&quot; was appointed on 17 July 1941:
* Siegfried Kasche (b. 1903 – d. 1947), NSDAP

====Kaukasien====

The Caucasus was never brought under sufficient German control to permit its transfer to civilian administration, but a designated &quot;Reichskommissar für die Kaukasien&quot; was appointed on 17 July 1941:
* Arno Schickedanz (b. 1892 – d. 1945), NSDAP

<text>Baldwin VI ( 1030 – 17 July 1070), also known as Baldwin the Good, was the count of Hainaut from 1051 to 1070 (as Baldwin I) and count of Flanders from 1067 to 1070.

Baldwin was the eldest son of Baldwin V of Flanders and Adela, a daughter of King Robert II of France and Constance of Arles. His father arranged his marriage, under threat of arms, to Richilde, the widow of Herman of Mons and heir of Hainaut. As Hainaut was a part of the Holy Roman Empire this enraged Emperor Henry III, who had not been consulted, causing him to wage war on the two Baldwins without success. Between 1050 and 1054 Count Lambert II of Lens fought alongside the Baldwins against Henry III finding that this alliance best protected his interests.

Baldwin VI died on 17 July 1070. Baldwin had constructed the church of St. Peter&#x27;s of Hasnon, placed monks there and designated it as his burial place. His early death left Flanders and Hainaut in the hands of his young son, Arnulf III, with Richilde as regent. Arnulf III was killed at the Battle of Cassel in 1071. Baldwin VI&#x27;s younger son, Count Baldwin II of Hainaut, could not claim Flanders from Baldwin VI&#x27;s brother, Robert I.

<text>William Henry &quot;Papa Charlie&quot; Jackson (November 10, 1887 – May 7, 1938) was an early American bluesman and songster who accompanied himself with a banjo guitar, a guitar, or a ukulele. His recording career began in 1924. Much of his life remains a mystery, but his draft card lists his birthplace as New Orleans, Louisiana, and his death certificate states that he died in Chicago, Illinois, on May 7, 1938.

==Career==
Jackson began his career playing in minstrel shows and medicine shows. From the early 1920s into the 1930s, he played frequent club dates in Chicago and was noted for busking at Chicago&#x27;s Maxwell Street Market. In August 1924, he recorded the commercially successful &quot;Airy Man Blues&quot; and &quot;Papa&#x27;s Lawdy Lawdy Blues&quot; for Paramount Records. In April 1925, Jackson released his version of &quot;Shave &#x27;Em Dry&quot;. One of his subsequent tracks, &quot;Salty Dog Blues&quot;, became his most famous song. Among his recordings are several in which he accompanied classic female blues singers, such as Ida Cox, Hattie McDaniel, and Ma Rainey.

According to the blues writer Bruce Eder, Jackson achieved &quot;a musical peak of sorts in September of 1929 when he got to record with his longtime idol, Blind Arthur Blake, often known as the king of ragtime guitar during this period. &#x27;Papa Charlie and Blind Blake Talk About It&#x27; parts one and two are among the most unusual sides of the late &#x27;20s, containing elements of blues jam session, hokum recording, and ragtime.&quot; A few more recordings for the Paramount label followed in 1929 and 1930. In 1934, Jackson recorded for Okeh Records, and the following year he recorded with Big Bill Broonzy. Altogether, Jackson recorded 66 sides during his career.

==Legacy==
Jackson was an influential figure in blues music. He was the first self-accompanied blues musician to make records. He was one of the first musicians of the hokum genre, which uses comic, often sexually suggestive lyrics and lively, danceable rhythms. He wrote or was the first to record several songs that became blues standards, including &quot;All I Want Is a Spoonful&quot; and &quot;Salty Dog&quot;. Nonetheless, he has received little attention from blues historians.

Jackson&#x27;s &quot;Shake That Thing&quot; was covered by Mother McCree&#x27;s Uptown Jug Champions in 1964. &quot;Loan Me Your Heart&quot; appeared on the Wildpary Sheiks&#x27; eponymous album in 2002. The Carolina Chocolate Drops recorded &quot;Your Baby Ain&#x27;t Sweet Like Mine&quot; on their Grammy Award–winning 2010 album, &quot;Genuine Negro Jig&quot;, and often played the song in interviews after its release.

A brief selection from &quot;Shake That Thing&quot; was used in the television series &quot;Sanford and Son&quot;, in the 1973 episode entitled &quot;The Blind Mellow Jelly Collection&quot;, in which Fred Sanford, played by Redd Foxx, danced and sang along with it.

<doc id="360734" wikidata="Q1351424" url="?curid=360734" title="KMFDM">
<text>KMFDM (originally Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid, loosely translated by the band as &quot;no pity for the majority&quot;) is a multinational industrial rock band from Hamburg led by Sascha Konietzko, who founded the band in 1984 as a performance art project.

The band&#x27;s earliest incarnation included German drummer En Esch and British vocalist Raymond Watts, the latter of whom left and rejoined the group several times over its history. The trio recorded the band&#x27;s earliest albums in Germany before Konietzko and Esch moved to the United States, where they found much greater success with seminal industrial record label Wax Trax! German guitarist Günter Schulz joined in 1990; both he and Esch continued with the band until KMFDM broke up in 1999. Konietzko resurrected KMFDM in 2002 (Esch and Schulz declined to rejoin) on Metropolis Records, and by 2005 he had assembled a consistent line-up that included American singer Lucia Cifarelli (whom he married), British guitarists Jules Hodgson and Steve White, and British drummer Andy Selway. Konietzko and Cifarelli moved back to Germany in 2007, while the rest of the band stayed in the U.S. Hodgson and White moved on to other pursuits between 2015 and 2017, leaving the band a working trio unofficially. In addition to these core members, dozens of other musicians have worked with the group across its twenty-two studio albums and over two dozen singles, with sales totaling in excess of two million records worldwide.

Critics consider KMFDM one of the first bands to bring industrial music to mainstream audiences, though Konietzko refers to the band&#x27;s music as &quot;The Ultra-Heavy Beat&quot;. The band incorporates heavy metal guitar riffs, electronic music, samples, and both male and female vocals in its music, which encompasses a variety of styles including industrial rock and electronic body music. The band is fiercely political, with many of its lyrics taking stands against violence, war, and oppression. KMFDM normally tours at least once after every major release, and band members are known for their accessibility to and interaction with fans, both online and at concerts. Members, independently or working together and with other musicians, have recorded under many other names, primarily Watts&#x27; Pig, Konietzko&#x27;s Excessive Force, and Esch and Schulz&#x27;s Slick Idiot.

==History==

===Origin (1984)===
KMFDM was officially founded in Paris, France, on February 29, 1984, as a performance art project between Sascha Konietzko and German painter and multimedia artist Udo Sturm at the opening of an exhibition of young European artists at the Grand Palais. The first show consisted of Sturm playing an ARP 2600 synthesizer, Konietzko playing bass guitars with their amplifiers spread throughout the building, and four Polish coal miners (whom Konietzko had met at a bordello) pounding on the foundations of the Grand Palais.

====Name====


KMFDM is an initialism for the nonsensical and grammatically incorrect German phrase &quot;Kein Mehrheit Für Die Mitleid&quot;, which, keeping the same word order, literally translates as &quot;no majority for the pity&quot;, but is typically given the loose translation of &quot;no pity for the majority&quot;. In the original phrase, the articles preceding the nouns &quot;Mehrheit&quot; and &quot;Mitleid&quot; are inflected for the wrong gender, as the proper declension would be &quot;Keine Mehrheit für das Mitleid.&quot; Swapping the two nouns yields the grammatically correct &quot;Kein Mitleid für die Mehrheit&quot;, which translates directly as &quot;no pity for the majority&quot;.

The initialism has jokingly been said to stand for &quot;Kill Mother-Fucking Depeche Mode&quot;, coined by the band on their first U.S. tour and used as recently as &quot;Kunst&quot;.

===Early years in Germany (1984–1989)===

Sturm left early on, but Konietzko continued performing, at one point having twenty people in his troupe, which by then was engaged in antics such as fire eating and throwing entrails at audiences. Konietzko then returned to Hamburg, where he joined up with Peter Missing in his new band Missing Foundation. Drummer Nicklaus Schandelmaier, who had recently moved to Hamburg from Frankfurt, joined the group, and took the stage name En Esch. Although the group did some live performances, Konietzko and Esch dropped out of Missing Foundation before any recordings were made and went back to work as KMFDM, collaborating with Hamburg-based studio owner Raymond Watts.

Cassette copies of the band&#x27;s demo album, &quot;Opium&quot;, began circulating through the underground clubs and bars of Hamburg in 1984. KMFDM released its debut album, &quot;What Do You Know, Deutschland?&quot;, in December 1986. It was recorded from 1983 to 1986, with some of the songs recorded by Konietzko and Watts before Esch was a member of the band, and indeed, before the band officially existed. Skysaw Records gave the album a second UK release in 1987 and introduced the band to visual artist Aidan Hughes, usually credited as &quot;Brute!&quot; Hughes redesigned the album&#x27;s cover, and went on to design almost every KMFDM album cover.

Watts left the group after working on just three songs on 1988&#x27;s &quot;Don&#x27;t Blow Your Top&quot; to start his own project, Pig. After working the Hamburg underground music scene and releasing albums on European labels, the band began its long-standing relationship with Wax Trax! Records when &quot;Don&#x27;t Blow Your Top&quot; was licensed to the label for US distribution. The album was produced by Adrian Sherwood, and was described by AllMusic critic Dave Thompson as &quot;[highlighting] the producer as much as the band&quot;.

===Success in the US (1990–1994)===
KMFDM recorded and released its third album, &quot;UAIOE&quot;, in early 1989 for distribution in both the U.S. and Europe, arrived in America for the first time on December 16, and commenced touring the U.S. with Ministry. During KMFDM&#x27;s first US tour, band members started using the phrase &quot;Kill Motherfucking Depeche Mode&quot; for the initialism to tease journalists who did not understand German. The band signed directly to Wax Trax! to distribute its fourth album, &quot;Naïve&quot;, which was recorded in Europe and featured the debut of guitarist Günter Schulz, known at the time as Svetlana Ambrosius. A remix of the album&#x27;s title track was the group&#x27;s first hit, reaching No. 21 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance/Club Play Songs Chart in March 1991.

Konietzko moved to Chicago in 1991, and Esch followed a year later. KMFDM quickly became a part of the Chicago industrial music scene that included Ministry, My Life with the Thrill Kill Kult, and Revolting Cocks. Konietzko later remarked, &quot;We came from Germany and we all had to have day jobs and work our asses off to afford to be KMFDM and all of a sudden we&#x27;re in the states and we&#x27;re selling thousands of thousands of fucking records!&quot;

The band&#x27;s next club hit was &quot;Split&quot;, which was released in June 1991 and reached No. 46 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance/Club Play Songs Chart in July. During 1991, Konietzko collaborated with Buzz McCoy of My Life With the Thrill Kill Kult to record an album under the name Excessive Force titled &quot;Conquer Your World&quot;. Konietzko and Esch then began work on their halves of the intended fifth album, &quot;Apart&quot;, which was eventually released as two separate albums. Esch&#x27;s half became his solo album, &quot;Cheesy&quot;, while the official KMFDM album used Konietzko&#x27;s material and was renamed &quot;Money&quot;. This album spawned two more club hits in 1992: &quot;Vogue&quot;, which reached No. 19 on the Billboard Dance/Club Play Songs Chart in April, and the title track, which reached No. 36 on that same chart in July.

After touring in 1992 with drummer Chris Vrenna, the then-core of KMFDM (Konietzko, Esch, Schulz, and second guitarist Mark Durante) returned to Chicago and found that Wax Trax! had filed Chapter 11 bankruptcy to begin corporate reorganization in November 1992. The band went into the studio in 1993 as a group to record its sixth album, &quot;Angst&quot;, which sold more than 100,000 copies over the next two years. Esch said after the album&#x27;s release, &quot;I like this album way more. &quot;Money&quot; was done in a hurry, and I was doing a major Pigface tour, so I didn&#x27;t have much influence on the album. I really like &quot;Angst&quot;. I&#x27;m totally down with it. We&#x27;ve tried to involve guitar players, we tried to be like a real band, especially in the creative kind of aspect.&quot; After the release of &quot;Angst&quot;, Wax Trax!/TVT Records launched a promotion in which fans were encouraged to devise as many alternate meanings for KMFDM as possible, with more than a thousand submissions resulting.

Konietzko released a second album under the Excessive Force moniker in 1993 titled &quot;Gentle Death&quot;. KMFDM received its first exposure to the mainstream with its single &quot;A Drug Against War&quot;. Despite the band&#x27;s anti-MTV stance, the video of &quot;A Drug Against War&quot; received airplay on MTV and was shown on the MTV cartoon &quot;Beavis and Butt-head&quot;. The track &quot;Light&quot; reached No. 31 on the Billboard Dance/Club Play Songs Chart in May 1994.

The song &quot;Liebeslied&quot; from &quot;Naïve&quot; originally contained an unlicensed sample of &quot;O Fortuna&quot; from Carl Orff&#x27;s &quot;Carmina Burana&quot;. Orff&#x27;s publisher threatened the band with legal action, and the album was withdrawn from production in 1993. A new version of the album, titled &quot;Naïve/Hell to Go&quot;, was released the following year. It contained new mixes of several songs, including a version of &quot;Liebeslied&quot; with the offending sample removed.

Wax Trax! was saved from bankruptcy by an infusion of funds from TVT Records, and in March 1994 announced plans to release the compilation set &quot;Black Box – Wax Trax! Records: The First 13 Years&quot;, which includes the KMFDM songs &quot;Virus&quot; and &quot;Godlike&quot;, two songs which Thompson called &quot;defining&quot;.

===Peak popularity (1994–1999)===

The mid-to-late 1990s were KMFDM&#x27;s most successful years in terms of album sales and mainstream awareness. Konietzko moved to Seattle in 1994, while Esch moved to New Orleans. Watts rejoined the band to work on its seventh album, &quot;Nihil&quot;, which peaked at No. 16 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Heatseekers chart and sold 209,000 copies, making it the band&#x27;s best-selling album. It marked the first contributions by drummer Bill Rieflin, who worked with the band on its next five albums. &quot;Nihil&quot; featured KMFDM&#x27;s most widely known song, &quot;Juke Joint Jezebel&quot;, versions of which appeared on both the &quot;Bad Boys&quot; and &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot; soundtracks, the latter of which peaked at No. 10 on the Billboard 200 and sold over 1.8 million copies. Their song &quot;Ultra&quot; was used in the English version of &quot;Street Fighter II: The Animated Movie&quot;.

Commenting on the rotating cast of musicians shortly after &quot;Nihil&quot;&#x27;s release, Konietzko said, &quot;It&#x27;s as if En and I are the suns and the other musicians at the time come and revolve around us.&quot; Regarding the duo&#x27;s dynamic, Konietzko said, &quot;En Esch and myself have always been the cornerstone of KMFDM&#x27;s existence. And we are diametrically opposed as writers. The angsty stuff generally comes from him. The poppy, hard stuff comes from me.&quot; Esch commented in 1994, &quot;Sascha and myself are different, of course. But that&#x27;s why we can still make things happen. Our best and worst qualities are contrary. To put it simply, he&#x27;s more organized and stable, I&#x27;m more complicated and abstract.&quot;
In late 1995, close friend and president of Chicago&#x27;s Wax Trax! Jim Nash died of an illness complicated by AIDS, and Seattle became the official headquarters of KMFDM. Watts toured with KMFDM throughout 1995 in support of &quot;Nihil&quot;, but then left the group to return to recording under the Pig moniker. Esch separated from the group, and &quot;Xtort&quot; was created in 1996 almost entirely without his input. Konietzko instead brought in a number of other industrial artists such as Chris Connelly to assist with the album. &quot;Xtort&quot; was the first KMFDM album to chart on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and the highest-charting album in the band&#x27;s history, reaching No. 92 and selling more than 200,000 copies. &quot;Power&quot;, the album&#x27;s first single, was the most heavily promoted song in the band&#x27;s history, with almost 100,000 copies included in a free Wax Trax! sampler album in mid-1996. Konietzko later said &quot;Xtort&quot; was his favorite album of the 1990s.

Esch returned for the &quot;Symbols&quot; album, which was released in 1997 and featured Abby Travis and Skinny Puppy&#x27;s Nivek Ogre. &quot;Symbols&quot; reached No. 137 on the Billboard 200. Its first track, &quot;Megalomaniac&quot;, was featured in the film &quot;Mortal Kombat Annihilation&quot;, and was the first song from its soundtrack to receive radio airplay. Tim Skold, formerly of the band Shotgun Messiah, made his first appearance as a band member, writing lyrics and performing vocals on &quot;Anarchy&quot;. Looking back on &quot;Symbols&quot; in 2002, Konietzko said, &quot;I listened to the &quot;Symbols&quot; album and heard exactly why KMFDM broke up in the first place. It told me the story of what went wrong. There were maybe two (good) songs on that album and the others were just a bunch of compromising tug-of-wars. That was something I was not going to do again.&quot;

The band released a pair of compilation albums in 1998. The first, &quot;Retro&quot;, was a greatest hits compilation which included most of the singles released up until &quot;Xtort&quot;. The second, &quot;Agogo&quot;, was a collection of rarities and previously unreleased tracks, including a cover of U2&#x27;s &quot;Mysterious Ways&quot;.

===&quot;Adios&quot; (1999) and the Columbine High School massacre===
The album &quot;Adios&quot; was written and performed almost exclusively by Konietzko and Skold. Ogre again provided vocals, as did German musician Nina Hagen. Originally the fulfillment of the band&#x27;s ten record contract with Wax Trax!/TVT, &quot;Adios&quot; later signaled the breakup of the band itself, which Esch&#x27;s and Schulz&#x27;s limited participation foreshadowed.

KMFDM disbanded, albeit temporarily, on January 22, 1999, with only Konietzko and Skold remaining together. Konietzko said the split was due to &quot;lots of stress and pressure, as well as differences in vision and drive&quot;. Esch said &quot;There was a lot of negative energy between Sascha and Günter Schulz and myself and we all decided on the phone to call the band quits.&quot; &quot;Adios&quot; was released three months later, and reached No. 189 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200. Its title track was called &quot;a bitter goodbye&quot;.

In the wake of the Columbine High School massacre, it was revealed that lyrics to KMFDM songs (&quot;Son of a Gun&quot;, &quot;Stray Bullet&quot;, &quot;Waste&quot;) were posted on the website of shooter Eric Harris, and that the date of the massacre, April 20, coincided with both the release date of the album &quot;Adios&quot; and the birthday of Adolf Hitler. Some journalists were quick to jump on the possibility that the actions of Harris and the other shooter, Dylan Klebold, were inspired by the violent entertainment and Nazism, though one wrote, &quot;Lyrically, the band has written some songs that could easily be misconstrued by anyone lacking an ear for irony and looking for an excuse to commit violence.&quot; In response, Konietzko issued a statement:

:&quot;First and foremost, KMFDM would like to express their deep and heartfelt sympathy for the parents, families and friends of the murdered and injured children in Littleton. We are sick and appalled, as is the rest of the nation, by what took place in Colorado yesterday.&quot;

:&quot;KMFDM are an art form—not a political party. From the beginning, our music has been a statement against war, oppression, fascism and violence against others. While some of the former band members are German as reported in the media, none of us condone any Nazi beliefs whatsoever.&quot;

===MDFMK, Slick Idiot, and reformation (2000–2002)===

After the group disbanded, Schulz and Esch formed the band Slick Idiot, while Konietzko and Skold regrouped as MDFMK, adding singer Lucia Cifarelli to form a trio. MDFMK released one self-titled album with Republic/Universal Records, and toured North America. After being released from his contract with Universal due to a disagreement over who would produce the next album, Konietzko said he called Metropolis Records and asked if they&#x27;d be interested in signing KMFDM. The label agreed, although at the time only Konietzko himself was certain to participate.

Konietzko announced the return of KMFDM in early 2001, due to &quot;public demand&quot;, with Skold, Cifarelli, and former collaborators Watts and Rieflin joining him in the studio; he said at the time, &quot;I talked with the usual KMFDM suspects to see if they were interested, and what we came up with was something better than what we had before.&quot; Recalled Esch in 2009, &quot;I was happy about my new creative freedom at that time and so I refused the concept of a fast reunion of the original KMFDM.&quot; Konietzko said of the reformed band, &quot;Not only is it fun again, but it&#x27;s devoid of all the personal confrontations due to egos and fractions that were once a part of the band,&quot; but said, &quot;I really miss En Esch,&quot; in 2003. KMFDM released its first album in three years, &quot;Attak&quot;, in March 2002. The album was on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Independent Albums Chart for four weeks, peaking at No. 11.

===New line-up (2003–2007)===
Skold left after &quot;Attak&quot; to join Marilyn Manson. Over the next few years, Watts&#x27; bandmates from Pig joined KMFDM one by one. Jules Hodgson had already done guitar work for 2002&#x27;s &quot;Attak&quot;. Andy Selway first played drums for KMFDM on &quot;WWIII&quot; in 2003, and Steve White contributed to 2005&#x27;s &quot;Hau Ruck&quot; after touring with the band. All three, along with Watts and Cifarelli, were mentioned as band members on &quot;Intro&quot;, the final track on &quot;WWIII&quot;, although that was to be the last album on which Watts performed. &quot;WWIII&quot; was on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance/Electronic Albums Chart for seven weeks, and peaked at No. 3.

&quot;Opium&quot; was re-released in 2002 as KMFDM001 on the band&#x27;s new label, KMFDM Records, and a collection of songs recorded between 1984 and 1986 was released in 2004. Shortly after the release of &quot;WWIII&quot;, Konietzko began work on the soundtrack for 2004&#x27;s &quot;Spider-Man 2&quot; video game. &quot;Hau Ruck&quot; performed about as well as &quot;WWIII&quot;, appearing on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance/Electronic Albums Chart for eight weeks but only hitting No. 5. Unlike &quot;WWIII&quot;, &quot;Hau Ruck&quot; showed up on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Independent Albums chart for a single week at No. 48. A companion EP, &quot;Ruck Zuck&quot;, was released in 2006.

Konietzko took a new approach for &quot;Tohuvabohu&quot;, released in 2007. &quot;Principally in the past, there used to be 2 people that would start songs: me and Jules. On this record I said to the other 2 guys, Andy (Selway) and Steve (White), &#x27;Why don&#x27;t you guys come up with something?&#x27;&quot; &quot;Tohuvabohu&quot; was on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance/Electronic Albums Chart for just three weeks and peaked at No. 4. It appeared on the Independent Albums Chart for one week at No. 29. &quot;Tohuvabohu&quot; had a companion, &quot;Brimborium&quot;, a full length remix album released in 2008 that barely made it onto &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance/Electronic Albums Chart, hitting No. 20 for a single week.

Metropolis Records announced in mid-2006 it would reissue KMFDM&#x27;s entire Wax Trax!-era studio album back catalog, which had been out of print since the early 2000s. The albums were released in chronological order in groups of two or three from September 2006 to May 2007. Konietzko said the remastering was done over concerns about losing the rights to the back catalog after TVT defaulted on a loan, explaining, &quot;The original agreement was that the catalog would have reverted back to me in 2008, anyway, but TVT and Rykodisc were thinking of just making a KMFDM compilation, which would have eliminated my catalog, and I didn&#x27;t want that.&quot; Konietzko commented in 2006 that the current line-up was the best he had worked with, and said in a separate interview that his former bandmates were &quot;looking at me for handouts&quot;. Konietzko announced in October 2007 that he was packing up and moving back to Germany in the next three months.

===Return to Germany (2007–2016)===

Following the Finnish school shootings of 2007 and 2008, media reports again attempted to draw a connection between the shooters and KMFDM, and noted that both listed the band among their favorites. In an interview with Norwegian broadcaster NRK shortly after the 2008 incident, Konietzko responded to these claims by saying the recent shootings were a by-product of the copycat mentality and the Finnish shooters&#x27; desire to emulate the lifestyles and actions of the Columbine shooters. &quot;One of my biggest concerns immediately following this incident [the Columbine shooting] was that there would be copycats repeating such things in the future, as there often are when people commit heinous crimes and acts of violence. I was, unfortunately, right.&quot;

KMFDM re-released all of its old singles and hard-to-find tracks from before the 1999 breakup in a series of three double albums called &quot;Extra&quot;—&quot;Vol. 1&quot;, &quot;Vol. 2&quot;, and &quot;Vol. 3&quot;—in mid-2008. KMFDM Records released &quot;Skold vs. KMFDM&quot; in early 2009, which was a collaboration that Skold and Konietzko conducted over the Internet while on separate continents from June to October 2008. A follow-up is planned, but is not a high priority.

KMFDM&#x27;s sixteenth studio album, &quot;Blitz&quot;, released in March 2009, showcased further collaboration with Skold, but less input from the band members not living in Germany. It reached No. 4 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance/Electronic Albums Chart, and was on the chart for four weeks. Its companion remix album, &quot;Krieg&quot;, was released in early 2010. Two compilation albums, &quot;Würst&quot; and &quot;Greatest Shit&quot;, were released in September that same year.

On December 14, 2010, the official KMFDM website was changed to include a single image with the text &quot;All Systems Have Been Ripped. The Internet Has Been Shut Down.&quot; A new song titled &quot;Rebels in Control&quot; became available for listening and download on the site, posted in support of Julian Assange with regards to the controversy over WikiLeaks.

Former band members Durante, Esch, Schulz, and Watts appeared with Mona Mur at the April 2011 Wax Trax! Retrospectacle in Chicago, a charity event celebrating the industrial music label. The group performed KMFDM songs from the Wax Trax! era, including &quot;Juke Joint Jezebel&quot;, &quot;Godlike, &quot;Brute&quot;, and &quot;Don&#x27;t Blow Your Top&quot;. Konietzko expressed a desire to perform with the current band line-up, but was turned down by event organizers.

KMFDM released &quot;WTF?!&quot; in April 2011, featuring what Konietzko called &quot;a slew of guest musicians&quot; including Rieflin, Koichi Fukuda, Free Dominguez, and William Wilson. The album&#x27;s first single, &quot;Krank&quot;, charted in both Germany and the United States. &quot;WTF?!&quot; was on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Dance/Electronic Albums Chart for one week at No. 8.

Work on KMFDM&#x27;s eighteenth album began in February 2012. Titled &quot;Kunst&quot;, it was released on February 26, 2013. The band toured the United States in March and Europe in April 2013, as well as a second leg across the SW, CA and PNW parts of the US in the fall of 2013 entitled &quot;We Are KMFDM&quot; (subsequently filmed for a commemorative release), with direct support from Texas&#x27;s own primal 2-drummer band CHANT, performing a 30 year career-spanning set. KMFDM reissued &quot;Opium&quot; and &quot;WWIII&quot; in October 2013.

On May 24, 2014, Konietzko announced on the band&#x27;s Facebook page that a new album, titled &quot;Our Time Will Come&quot;, would be released on October 14, 2014. A new live album titled &quot;We Are KMFDM&quot; and a single called &quot;Genau (The German in You)&quot; were also announced. &quot;Our Time Will Come&quot; was released on October 14, 2014, on both CD and vinyl. The &quot;Genau&quot; single was not released, with a single for &quot;Salvation&quot; from the same album coming out instead in 2015. Another run of the US on the &#x27;Salvation Tour&#x27; commenced in the summer of 2015.

===Another line-up shift (2017–present)===

In April 2017, KMFDM revealed a new EP titled &quot;Yeah!&quot;; an album called &quot;Hell Yeah&quot; was released in August, with a U.S. tour planned in support of the releases for October. On June 23, &quot;Yeah!&quot; was released, followed by the release of &quot;Hell Yeah&quot; on August 18. Guitarists White and Hodgson were unavailable, so Konietzko recruited Chris Harms from Lord of the Lost to record the guitar parts. Harms, along with Lord of the Lost bandmates Pi (guitar) and Gared Dirge (keyboards), had been slated to perform as the live band for KMFDM&#x27;s late 2017 tour. Lord of the Lost were unable to secure work visas to enter the U.S., so Andee Blacksugar was tapped to handle guitar tasks instead. Various highlights of the tour were captured live and can be heard on their fourth live album &#x27;Live in the USSA&#x27;, released the following year in 2018. The album sonically presents the band in a more stripped-down, drum laden heavy metal style containing their obligatory cutting guitar riffs, melded with the traditional keys, samples, programming and additional percussion courtesy of band mainstay Sascha Konietzko.
The new quartet of Konietzko, Cifarelli, Selway, and Blacksugar announced the album, &quot;Paradise&quot;, for release on September 27, 2019. The band features a variety of guest appearances, including KMFDM co-founder Raymond Watts for the first time since 2003. In July 2022, the band announced a brand new album, &quot;Hyëna&quot; was released on September 9. The title track was revealed as a promotional single at the end of August.

A new album commemorating KMFDM&#x27;s 40 year anniversary (having formed on February 29, 1984) was released on February 2, 2024, entitled &quot;Let Go&quot;.

==Musical style, influences, and lyrical content==
KMFDM&#x27;s earliest output was performance art, as Konietzko incorporated not only visuals such as burning beds and exploding televisions, but also non-musical devices used as instruments, e.g. vacuum cleaners. The 1980s albums featured heavy use of sampling and studio manipulations, and the primary instruments used were synthesizers and drum machines. Konietzko has cited T. Rex, David Bowie, and Frank Zappa as inspiration in the early stages of KMFDM. Before forming the band, he listened to punk music like GBH and &quot;true industrial&quot; bands such as Throbbing Gristle.

The band&#x27;s music has been described as industrial, industrial rock, electro-industrial, industrial metal, and techno-industrial.
While recognized along with Ministry, Nine Inch Nails, and Skinny Puppy as pioneers in introducing industrial music to mainstream audiences, KMFDM describes its sound as &quot;The Ultra-Heavy Beat&quot;. Konietzko once stated, &quot;If I was to give myself a label it would be industrial-alternative-electronic-crossover-rock and danceabilly.&quot;

The band has made heavy use of guitars since its inception, and pioneered their use during the band&#x27;s early days in Germany. Although not a metal fan, Konietzko said his &quot;infatuation with ripping off metal licks&quot; stemmed from his experiments with E-mu&#x27;s Emax sampler in late 1986, adding, &quot;What I always hated most about heavy metal was that the best riffs came only once and were never repeated. So the fascination, actually, was to sample a great riff, loop it, and play it over and over again.&quot; While the album &quot;Don&#x27;t Blow Your Top&quot; was more sparse in content, due to the influence of producer Sherwood, it was the exception rather than the rule. Ministry founder and frontman Al Jourgensen, on tour with the band in 1989, described KMFDM as &quot;a battalion of guitars marching through Europe.&quot;

KMFDM&#x27;s music has since been a fusion of electronic and heavy metal, with occasional elements of dub, as well as orchestral samples and live horns. Many songs feature prominent backing vocals by female singers such as Dorona Alberti, Travis, and Cifarelli. Many of the musicians who have played in the band are multi-instrumentalists, so there is a degree of versatility and freedom in the music.

Many albums feature one or more songs in which the band lampoons itself, notably in the lyrics to &quot;Sucks&quot; and &quot;Inane&quot;. The band&#x27;s &quot;cynical detachment&quot; has been compared to Steely Dan. Lyrics often express political concerns and call for the rejection of and resistance to terrorism, violence, oppression, censorship, and war. In the 1995 song &quot;Terror&quot;, Konietzko specifically warns, &quot;Fundamentalist forces are undermining the integrity of liberal and democratic political structures&quot;. Samples of news broadcasts and speeches by political leaders are sometimes featured in songs. Konietzko has said that while the 2003 album &quot;WWIII&quot; is critical of then-president George W. Bush, who was sampled extensively for the album, &quot;It&#x27;s not an anti-Bush record per se, it&#x27;s an anti-stupidity record&quot;, and, &quot;If we had a message, it would be: Think for Yourself and Don&#x27;t Believe the Bullshit.&quot;

==Reception==
As of July 2007, KMFDM had sold approximately two million records worldwide. Critics have been widely positive of KMFDM, though less enthusiastic about the band&#x27;s earliest work. &quot;What Do You Know, Deutschland?&quot; was called &quot;less energetic&quot; and &quot;Don&#x27;t Blow Your Top&quot; was called &quot;a little flimsy&quot; in comparison to later albums by AllMusic critics Andy Hinds and Vincent Jeffries, respectively. &quot;UAIOE&quot;, when the band&#x27;s sound began to develop, was called &quot;more assured&quot; by Hinds and &quot;more representative of KMFDM&#x27;s true motives&quot; by Thompson, who added that KMFDM&#x27;s guitar-heavy sound inspired Ministry&#x27;s own embrace of the instrument after the bands toured together in 1990.

The first major breakthrough in the band&#x27;s critical reception was 1990&#x27;s &quot;Naïve&quot;, called &quot;one of their strongest releases&quot; by Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic, &quot;brilliant&quot; by fellow AllMusic critic Ned Raggett, &quot;superb&quot; by Hinds, and &quot;the most fun &#x27;industrial dance&#x27; album ever&quot; by &quot;Spin&quot; critic Chuck Eddy. The subsequent albums released in the 1990s were described as some of the band&#x27;s strongest by AllMusic critic Greg Prato, with their metal guitars, industrial beats, and dance floor sensibilities praised by Ira Robbins and &quot;CMJ New Music Monthly&quot; critic Heidi MacDonald. Michael Saunders of the &quot;Boston Globe&quot; said of the band: &quot;It&#x27;s a small field, but KMFDM is tops in it: makers of dense, danceable, post-industrial torrents of noise. The German band specializes in fabricating aural assaults that can be intimidating to the uninitiated.&quot; MacDonald said in 1996, &quot;With Ministry gone grindcore, Skinny Puppy just gone, and Nine Inch Nails a brand name, KMFDM is now the standard bearer of industrial&quot;, though Erlewine and Hinds felt the band was losing some steam towards the end of the decade.

Greg Rule declared in 1999, after its temporary disbandment, that KMFDM had &quot;produced nine high-impact records that have earned them a large, loyal fanbase strewn across the planet.&quot; Erlewine called the band &quot;one of Wax Trax&#x27;s first industrial superstars&quot;, &quot;an underground sensation&quot;, and &quot;one of the major industrial bands of the &#x27;90s.&quot; Most of the band&#x27;s albums released in the 21st century have been well-received, although Prato has commented on the sameness from one album to the next. Recent albums &quot;Blitz&quot; and &quot;WTF?!&quot; have been described as moving in an electronic, less guitar-focused direction by Trey Spencer of &quot;Sputnikmusic&quot; and AllMusic&#x27;s David Jeffries.

==Touring and fanbase==

KMFDM has released on average an album every year and a half, and usually tours at least once in support of each album. At most concert venues, KMFDM mingles with the fans before and after the show to sign autographs, pose for photos, and answer questions. Konietzko, who keeps in contact with fans via e-mail and the band&#x27;s website, and band representatives have experimented with ways for fans to interact more directly. KMFDM launched &quot;Horde&quot; in 2002, an exclusive fan club which gave members the opportunity to attend a private meet-and-greet with the band before every show, and allowed access to members-only music and footage online. A featurette on the Horde fan club appears on the &quot;WWIII Live 2003&quot; DVD.

In the 2004 &quot;Fankam&quot; project, an audience member was selected at each concert to record that night&#x27;s show, as well as some back-stage antics, with a hand-held digital video camera. The resulting footage was incorporated into the following year&#x27;s &quot;20th Anniversary World Tour&quot; DVD, which included fan photos submitted to the KMFDM official website. KMFDM encouraged fans to call a special &quot;FanPhone&quot; and leave a voice message in March 2007. The song &quot;Superpower&quot; from 2007&#x27;s &quot;Tohuvabohu&quot; includes sound-clips from these messages. The band used the Fankam project again for its 2011 &quot;Kein Mitleid&quot; tour in the United States.

===List of tours===

All tours featured KMFDM headlining, except where noted.
==Album artwork==
KMFDM has a long-standing relationship with commercial artist Aidan &quot;Brute!&quot; Hughes, who creates the artwork adorning almost all of the band&#x27;s albums and singles, which has been called &quot;one of rock music&#x27;s most memorable cover art collections&quot;. Hughes&#x27; artwork is featured in KMFDM&#x27;s music videos for &quot;A Drug Against War&quot; and &quot;Son of a Gun&quot;, and on the band&#x27;s promotional T shirts. Art critic Brian Sherwin said Hughes is probably best known for the collection of KMFDM artwork he has created.

All of his work, which has been called &quot;striking&quot;, shares a distinct visual style inspired by Golden Age comic artists, Russian Constructivists, Italian Futurists, and woodcut artists. In an interview with Sherwin, Hughes stated, &quot;KMFDM have cornered the market in industrial post-modern angst and so my work reflects that.&quot; Hughes said that initially he based his work on the music, which caused &quot;artistic block&quot;. Konietzko gave him more freedom to use whatever themes he wished, resulting in the cover to &quot;Money&quot;, which Hughes said &quot;was based upon my disillusionment with the street lifestyle I was experiencing at the time, and the art carries with it the implication that no matter what temptation lies in your path, you still gotta pay!&quot;

The only studio album covers not designed by Hughes are &quot;Opium&quot;, which consists of a black-and-white photo, and &quot;Nihil&quot;, which was designed by Francesca Sundsten, wife of drummer Rieflin.

<text>Lady Mary Victoria Douglas-Hamilton, also known as Mary Victoria Hamilton (11 December 185014 May 1922), was a Scottish noblewoman who was the Hereditary Princess of Monaco by marriage to Albert, Hereditary Prince of Monaco.

==Life==
Lady Mary was born as the youngest child and the only daughter of William Hamilton, 11th Duke of Hamilton and of his wife, Princess Marie Amelie of Baden.

===Hereditary Princess of Monaco===
Lady Mary&#x27;s first marriage, on 21 September 1869 at Château de Marchais, was to Prince Albert, only child and heir apparent of Charles III, Prince of Monaco. The marriage was arranged upon the wish of the Monegasque princely house, as it had long been an ambition of his mother and grandmother to marry him to a member of the British royal house. While Queen Victoria refused a match between Albert and one of her closer family members, Lady Mary was suggested as a suitable replacement. However, Lady Mary and Albert&#x27;s marriage was annulled on 3 January 1880 and civilly dissolved on 28 July 1880 by order of Charles III. Lady Mary supposedly hated the heat of the Mediterranean area.

Lady Mary and Albert had a single son, Louis, who would take the throne of Monaco with the regnal name &quot;Louis II&quot; upon his father&#x27;s death. Via Louis II, Lady Mary is the great-great-grandmother of the current Sovereign Prince of Monaco, Albert II.

===Life in Hungary===

Lady Mary’s second marriage, on 2 June 1880, was to Count Tassilo Festetics de Tolna. The couple had four children, Countess Mária Matild Georgina (1881–1953), who married Prince Karl Emil von Fürstenberg;
Prince György (1882–1941); Countess Alexandra Olga Eugénia (1884–1963), who married Prince Karl von Windisch-Graetz; and Countess Karola Friderika Mária (1888—1951), who married Oskar Gautsch Freiherr von Frankenthurn.

During her 40-year marriage to Count, later Prince, Tassilo Festetics de Tolna, Lady Mary oversaw the enlargement and improvement of the main family seat, Festetics Palace, and its gardens, in Keszthely, western Hungary.

On numerous occasions, she and her husband entertained her brother the Duke of Hamilton and his great friend the Prince of Wales. There are still portraits hanging in the Palace of numerous members of her family, including one of her father in full Highland dress. Outside the palace, on either side of the main entrance, there are the armorial bearings of both Lady Mary and her husband.

The Helikon Library at the Palace contains many works that were brought to Keszthely by Lady Mary from her father’s and brother&#x27;s collections at Hamilton Palace.

The Palace grounds, on the shores of Lake Balaton, contains a Festetics family Mausoleum which is the final resting place of Lady Mary and her husband.

<doc id="360739" wikidata="Q333346" url="?curid=360739" title="Robert I, Count of Flanders">
<text>Robert I ( – 13 October 1093), known as Robert the Frisian, was count of Flanders from 1071 until his death in 1093. He was a son of Baldwin V, Count of Flanders, and the younger brother of Baldwin VI, Count of Flanders. He usurped the countship after defeating his nephew Arnulf III and his allies, which included King Philip I of France, Count Eustace of Boulogne and the counts of Saint-Pol and Ardres at the Battle of Cassel. He subsequently made peace with Philip, who became his stepson-in-law, but remained hostile to his sister Matilda and her husband William the Conqueror, who was king of England and duke of Normandy.

==Early life==
Robert was the younger son of Baldwin V of Flanders and Adela, a daughter of King Robert II of France. His elder brother, Baldwin VI, succeeded their father as count of Flanders in 1067, and his sister Matilda had married William the Conqueror, then duke of Normandy and later king of England in 1051/2.

==Regent of Holland==
Robert&#x27;s marriage to Gertrude of Saxony, dowager countess of Holland, in 1063 was not arranged by his father but nonetheless agreed to. His nickname &#x27;the Frisian&#x27; was obtained, apparently, when he acted as regent for his stepson, Count Dirk V of Holland Robert and Gertrude had six children: Robert, who became count of Flanders, Adela († 1115), who became queen of Denmark, Gertrude, who became duchess of Lorraine, Philip, Ogiva, who became abbess of Messines, and Baldwin († bef. 1080).

Robert twice swore a renunciation to his claims to Flanders. The first was at Audenarde (between 1063 and 1067), in presence of his father Baldwin V. He received a significant monetary compensation. The second was made at Bruges (1069/70) in presence of his brother Baldwin VI.

On his deathbed in 1070, Baldwin VI left Flanders and Hainaut to his elder son, Arnulf III, while Richilde, Arnulf&#x27;s mother, was to be regent until Arnulf came of age.

==Count of Flanders==
Despite the oath, Robert disputed the succession of his nephew Arnulf III upon Baldwin VI&#x27;s death. He recruited supporters in the Maritime Flanders and Ghent, and finally entered the latter with the intent of taking Flanders for himself. Richilde appealed to King Philip I of France who summoned Robert to appear before him. Robert refused and continued his war with Richilde at which point Philip I amassed an army which he brought to Flanders. Among his allies were the counts of Boulogne, Saint-Pol and Ardres. His army was also accompanied by Norman troops, probably sent by Robert&#x27;s sister, Queen Matilda, and led by William FitzOsborn.

Both forces did battle on Cassel on 22 February 1071. King Philip fled together with Godfrey, bishop of Paris; both Robert and Richilde were captured but Robert was ultimately victorious. Among the dead were Arnulf III (according to some sources killed by Gerbod the Fleming, 1st Earl of Chester) and William FitzOsborn. As a result of the battle Robert claimed the countship of Flanders, and Richilde&#x27;s son Baldwin became count of Hainaut, where he continued to instigate hostilities against Robert.

King Philip gathered some forces at Montreuil-sur-Mer, invaded Flanders and burned the town of Saint-Omer. However, Count Robert eventually negotiated a peace agreement, later consolidated by the marriage of his stepdaughter Bertha of Holland to the king. As a part of their negotiations Corbie, an important trade center, which had been ceded by Arnulf III in order to secure the king&#x27;s help, was returned to royal control. From then on, and until the repudiation of Bertha in 1092 (in order for King Philip I to marry Bertrade of Montfort), Flanders and France remained in very friendly terms, both of them having the new Anglo-Norman realm as a main enemy. 

After the battle of Cassel, Richilde and Baldwin continued the war against Robert. To obtain funds, they enfeoffed Hainaut to the bishopric of Liege and counted with the support of Godfrey IV, Duke of Lower Lorraine. Close to forest of Broqueroye, Robert inflicted heavy losses on the forces of Hainaut. Later, Baldwin obtained a victory at Wavrechain. After this, the war with Hainaut ended, with Robert as the unchallenged ruler of Flanders.

Flanders became a refuge for William the Conqueror&#x27;s enemies, including Edgar Ætheling in 1075 and his rebellious son Robert Curthose in 1078/79. In 1075, Robert let the Danish fleet of king Sweyn II of Denmark use Flanders harbors in their intended expedition against England. In 1080, Robert married his daughter Adela to Canute IV of Denmark on his accession to the throne. In 1085 Robert and Canute planned a massive naval attack on England. The threat was big enough for William to hire mercenaries and lay waste to some coastal districts in order to difficult the supplying of an invading army. However, the rebellion of Canute&#x27;s brother Olaf delayed the expedition, and finally Canute&#x27;s assassination put a definitive end to the plan.

Even before becoming count of Flanders, Robert was engaged in continued hostilities in Holland, defending the rights of his stepson Dirk V against Godfrey IV and William I, bishop of Utrecht. In 1076, the deaths of Godfrey at Vlaardingen and later of William, allowed Robert and Dirk to go on the offensive. They won an important battle at Yselmond, even capturing the new bishop, Conrad. The victory changed the course of the hostilities, allowing Dirk and future counts to reconquer the territories of the county of Holland they had lost in the past.

==Relationship with the Church==

The relationship between Robert and Pope Gregory VII was marked by the conflict between the latter and the bishops of Therouanne. Since Robert did not take action against bishop Drogo, he was excommunicated (around 1077) by bishop Raynard of Langres and papal legate Hubert. Gregory was not pleased with the excommunication, since he could not afford another enemy in his conflict with Henry IV. He instructed his legate Hugh of Die to investigate the matter and lift the excommunication if it had been not canonical. The excommunication was probably lifted at some point after September 1079. Trouble continued under Drogo&#x27;s successors, Hubert and Lambert, as Robert refused to intervene against them. Gregory threatened Robert with a new excommunication, but the threat was not carried out.

During the papacy of Urban II the Flemish clergy complained about the exactions imposed by Robert at a provincial council in Rheims (around 1092). A delegation composed of Arnulf (provost of Saint Omer), Jean (abbot of Saint Bertin), Gerard (abbot of Ham) and Bernard (provost of Watten) threatened Robert with an interdict in case the exactions did not end. Robert complied and returned the goods he had confiscated.

==Later years and pilgrimage to Jerusalem==

Taking a considerable armed escort Robert the Frisian made a pilgrimage to Jerusalem in 1086 and on the return trip home spent time assisting the Byzantine Emperor (Alexios I Komnenos) against the Seljuq Turks. In one battle Robert and three of his companions rode ahead of the main army charging the forces under the command of Kerbogha, whose forces the Christians scattered completely. Robert died 13 October 1093.

<doc id="360740" wikidata="Q1769854" url="?curid=360740" title="Ragnar Skancke">
<text>Ragnar Sigvald Skancke (9 November 1890 – 28 August 1948) was the Norwegian Minister for Church and Educational Affairs in Vidkun Quisling&#x27;s Nasjonal Samling government during World War II. Shot for treason in the legal purges following the war, he remains the last person executed in Norway. 

Before the war, Skancke was a highly respected professor of electrical engineering at the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim and a member of the Royal Norwegian Society of Sciences and Letters.

==Pre-war life==
Skancke was born in Ås, Norway, the son of bank director Johan Skancke and Kari Busvold. In 1908 he became a student, and in 1913 gained a Bachelor of Engineering in Karlsruhe, Germany.

Skancke worked as a docent at the Norwegian Institute of Technology in Trondheim from 1913 to 1918, and then spent the next five years as an supervising engineer at the telecommunication company Elektrisk Bureau. From 1923 onwards, Skancke was a professor at the Norwegian Institute of Technology. He married Ingrid Aas (born 1888) in 1927.

==World War II collaboration==

===Political positions===
====April 1940 &quot;coup&quot; government====
The first political position given to Professor Skancke was that of Minister of Labour in Vidkun Quisling&#x27;s April 1940 &quot;coup&quot; government, the latter&#x27;s attempt at seizing power in Norway following the German invasion of 9 April. Skancke was in Trondheim at the time, and only heard of his appointment when it was announced on the radio. He reacted with opposition to Quisling&#x27;s attempt to form a government, refusing to assume the ministry allotted to him.

====Terboven council and NS government====
Reichskommissar Josef Terboven, the leading civilian German leader in occupied Norway, on 25 September 1940 appointed a council of Norwegian ministers to assist him in governing Norway. Skancke was appointed as Councillor of State for Church and Educational Affairs, and was given the title Minister for Church and Educational Affairs exactly a year later.

===Acts during war===
During his collaborationist work in occupied Norway Skancke mostly acted in passive ways, but did not hesitate to enact countermeasures if he met opposition to his work. Although not taking a leading part in the attempted nazification of the Norwegian Church and school system, he did take full responsibility for the sacking of bishops, priests and teachers opposed to National socialist teachings. He also ordered Norwegian teachers and school children to attend a Hitler Youth exhibition in Oslo in February 1941, which led to the first school strike of the occupation, and ordered the confiscation of books by authors opposed to Quisling. Skancke, however, was completely opposed to the deportation to Finnmark of teachers who would not institute the new teaching programmes. In one instance of refusal to cooperate fully with the German authorities, Skancke delayed acting on an order from Reichskommissar Terboven issued on 5 July 1941 that all Norwegian church bells were to be sent to Germany for smelting and use in the war industry. The case dragged out until it was handed over to minister of trade Eivind Blehr in 1942. Blehr refused to release the bells, leading to several confrontations with Terboven until the Germans were later persuaded to drop the demands, saving all the bells.

==Post-war conviction and execution==

===Trials===
Following the May 1945 German capitulation in Norway and the rest of Europe, Skancke was put on trial for treason. He was convicted and sentenced to death in 1946. In March 1947, the Norwegian Supreme Court rejected Skancke&#x27;s appeals and confirmed the sentence. In response to the confirmation of his sentence, Skancke attempted to get a retrial, presenting new evidence and witness testimonies. During this process, the mood in Norway largely changed with many calls for clemency for the former collaborationist minister.

===Execution===
As all calls for clemency were rejected Skancke was executed by firing squad at Akershus Fortress on 28 August 1948, the last person to be executed in Norway, which has since abolished capital punishment for all crimes, including war crimes and treason. Before his execution, the Norwegian High Court had received letters from 668 priests who asked for mercy on Skancke&#x27;s behalf. Ragnar Skancke was one of only three Norwegian Nazi leaders to be executed for political crimes in the post-war legal purge, the others being Quisling and Internal affairs minister Albert Viljam Hagelin, all the 34 other Norwegians and Germans executed in the post war process having been convicted of murder, torture or systematic informing.

==Published works==
In addition to professional works on electrical engineering in the 1930s, Skancke also wrote a book on Vidkun Quisling.

<text>Robert II, Count of Flanders ( 1065 – 5 October 1111) was Count of Flanders from 1093 to 1111. He became known as Robert of Jerusalem (&quot;Robertus Hierosolimitanus&quot;) or Robert the Crusader after his exploits in the First Crusade.

==Early life==
Robert was the eldest son of Robert I of Flanders (also known as Robert the Frisian) and Gertrude of Saxony. His father, hoping to place the cadet branch (or &quot;Baldwinite&quot; branch) of Flanders over the county, began to associate him with his rule around 1086. From 1085 to 1091 he was regent of the county while his father was away on pilgrimage to the Holy Land. Robert II became count in 1093 and supported the restoration of the diocese of Arras in order to limit the influence of the Holy Roman Empire in his dominion. With the approval of Pope Urban II, the diocese 
was split off from the diocese of Cambrai in 1093/94 and Lambert of Guines elected as its first bishop. 

==First Crusade==
In 1095, Robert joined the First Crusade, launched by Pope Urban II. He made his wife, Clementia of Burgundy, regent in Flanders, and formed the army of Robert the Crusader that followed the retinue of his kinsman Godfrey of Bouillon, Duke of Lower Lorraine. After reaching Constantinople, the crusaders were obliged to swear an oath of fealty to Byzantine emperor Alexius I Komnenus and promise to return to the Byzantine Empire any land they might capture. Robert, whose father had already served Alexius during his pilgrimage in the 1080s, had no problem swearing this oath, but some of the other leaders did and there was some delay in leaving the city.
Robert then participated in the Siege of Nicaea, after which the army was split into two groups. Robert marched with Stephen of Blois, Bohemond of Taranto, Robert Curthose, and the Byzantine guides, one day ahead of the rest of the crusaders. This army was surrounded by the Seljuk sultan Kilij Arslan at the Battle of Dorylaeum on 30 June 1097. The next day, the second army, led by Raymond IV of Toulouse, Godfrey of Bouillon, and Hugh of Vermandois, arrived and broke the encirclement; the two armies joined, with Robert and Raymond forming the centre. The Turks were defeated, and the crusaders continued their march.

At the end of 1097 the crusaders arrived at Antioch. The Siege of Antioch lasted many months; in December, Robert and Bohemund briefly left the army to raid the surrounding territory for food, and on 30 December they defeated an army sent to relieve Antioch, led by Duqaq, ruler of Damascus. Antioch was eventually betrayed to Bohemund by an Armenian guard, and Robert was among the first to enter the city, but only a few days later they were themselves besieged by Kerbogha. atabeg of Mosul. On 28 June 1098, the crusaders marched out to meet him in battle. Robert and Hugh of Vermandois led the first of six divisions. Kerbogha was defeated and the Muslim-held citadel finally surrendered to the crusaders. Robert, along with Bohemond, Raymond, and Godfrey, occupied the citadel, but Bohemund soon claimed the city for himself. Raymond also claimed it, but Robert supported Bohemund in this dispute.

The dispute delayed the crusade even further. Raymond left Antioch to attack Ma&#x27;arrat al-Numan, which was captured. Robert took part in this siege as well. Raymond then tried to bribe Robert and the other leaders to follow him instead of Bohemund; Robert was offered six thousand &quot;sous&quot;, but each attempted bribe was ignored. Raymond continued south to Jerusalem in January 1099, but Robert and Godfrey remained behind in Antioch until February. They rejoined Raymond&#x27;s army at the Siege of Arqa. In June, Robert and Gaston IV of Bearn led the vanguard which arrived at Ramla, and with Tancred, he led an expedition into Samaria to find wood in order to construct siege engines for the Siege of Jerusalem. When Jerusalem was captured on 15 July, Robert supported Godfrey&#x27;s claim over that of Raymond, and on August 9 marched out with him to meet the Fatimid army under al-Afdal Shahanshah which was coming to relieve Jerusalem. Robert formed part of the centre wing in the ensuing Battle of Ascalon, which resulted in a crusader victory. However, Godfrey and Raymond quarrelled over possession of Ascalon, and even Robert could not support Godfrey in this dispute; the city remained uncaptured, although the victory allowed for the establishment of the Kingdom of Jerusalem.

At the end of August, Robert returned home with Robert Curthose and Raymond. On the way back they captured Latakia, which was returned to the Byzantine emperor, as promised years before. Raymond remained there but both Roberts continued home by way of Constantinople, after declining Alexius&#x27; request to stay there in his service. Robert brought back with him a precious relic, the arm of Saint George, a gift from Alexius. The relic was placed in the church of Anchin Abbey in Flanders. After he returned, Robert built the monastery of St. Andrew in Sevenkerke (now Zevenkerke, near Bruges. Because of his crusade and the spoils he brought home, he was nicknamed Robert of Jerusalem.

==Later life==

During his absence, Holy Roman Emperor Henry IV had tried to seize imperial Flanders. Robert responded by supporting the revolt of the Commune of Cambrai against the emperor and his supporter, Bishop Gaulcher, and seized a number of castles. Peace was restored in 1102 and homage paid to the emperor for imperial Flanders, but after 1105, the new emperor, Henry V, marched on Flanders, with the aid of Count Baldwin III of Hainaut and an army from Holland. Robert stopped them outside of Douai and a new peace was signed, in which the emperor recognized Robert&#x27;s claim to Douai and Cambrai.

Like his wife Clementia, Robert was a promoter of the Cluniac reform movement, supporting the reformers of the Abbey of Saint Bertin and assisting progressive ecclesiastic actors in general.

In 1103 he made an alliance with Henry I of England, offering 1000 cavalry in exchange for an annual tribute. When Henry refused to pay, Robert allied with his nominal overlord, Louis VI of France, and attacked Normandy. With the king diverted, Theobald IV of Blois led a revolt of the French barons. Robert led an army against Meaux. During the battle he fell off his horse and was trampled to death on 5 October 1111.

==Family==
He married Clementia of Burgundy, sister of Pope Callistus II and daughter of William I, Count of Burgundy. They had three children, but only the oldest survived to adulthood. He succeeded Robert as Baldwin VII of Flanders.

<doc id="360743" wikidata="Q574312" url="?curid=360743" title="Albert Viljam Hagelin">
<text>Albert Viljam Hagelin (24 April 1881 – 25 May 1946) was a Norwegian businessman and opera singer who became the Minister of Domestic Affairs in the Quisling regime, the puppet government headed by Vidkun Quisling during Germany&#x27;s World War II occupation of Norway.

== Early life ==
Albert Viljam Hagelin&#x27;s father, Harald Joachim Hagelin (1852–1889), was a goldsmith who died when his son was nine years old. He was part of a Swedish family that immigrated to Norway in the early 18th century. Hagelin&#x27;s mother, Gerd Anna Hedvig Eleonore Meyer (1857–1926), was of Danish-Jewish descent, and her father was also a goldsmith; as a widow, she ran a private hotel in Bergen after the family&#x27;s jewelry business was closed down. Albert Hagelin was the brother-in-law of Kjeld Stub Irgens and the brother of the Conservative politician and factory owner, Robert Hagelin.

== Career in Germany ==
Hagelin left Norway around 1900 to study as an architect at the Technische Hochschule in Dresden. Later, Nina Grieg encouraged him to study music. According to family tradition, he sang operatic roles in both Berlin and Dresden. In total, Hagelin lived abroad for over 40 years until the end of the 1930s, mostly in Dresden. Hagelin married the owner of an import company in Bremen and increased his fortune through successful stock market speculation, coffee business, art trade and hotel business. In the 1930s, the couple lived in Loschwitz outside Dresden. After his wife&#x27;s death in January 1935, Hagelin also became very ill, to the extent that he had to be hospitalized the day after his wife&#x27;s funeral. Hagelin went on a longer tour of Norway. While visiting Oslo, he sought out Vidkun Quisling. Details from the two conversations are not known, but Hagelin shortly afterwards joined Nasjonal Samling (NS).

In the spring of 1939, Hagelin tried to obtain German money for the NS newspaper Fritt Folk. Through his tennis club in Dresden, he knew Hermann Göring&#x27;s nephew Herbert Göring and thus came into contact with the country&#x27;s top management. The funding attempts failed. However, Hagelin managed to establish ties with other German leaders and came into contact with Grand Admiral Erich Raeder and the NSDAP&#x27;s chief ideologist Alfred Rosenberg. Quisling visited Hagelin in Germany in the summer of 1939, and the two became well acquainted.

== World War II ==

When World War II broke out, Hagelin blamed the war on a &quot;Judeo-Masonic Clique&quot;. With Quisling&#x27;s coup on 9 April 1940, Hagelin was appointed Minister of Trade and Supply, and thus gained a place in the innermost NS circles. Later that year, he became county leader for Oslo and Akershus, and the party&#x27;s deputy leader. He thus became Quisling&#x27;s deputy and in practice party leader in the summer of 1940 when Quisling stayed in Germany for a longer period of time.

In the autumn of 1940, Hagelin was appointed head of the newly established Ministry of the Interior, as part of Josef Terboven&#x27;s commissary cabinet. He was thus responsible for the nazification of the municipalities through the Municipal Ordinance and for the NS takeover of organizational life and public administration in general. He had the jurist Thorleif Dahl with him as a ministerial adviser. Among other things, they had to defend &quot;Norwegian&quot; interests vis-à-vis Terboven, and among other things were coached on a German initiative on a tax reform that would finance the occupation. Hagelin also pressured Quisling to reach a final peace agreement with Germany.

His cooperation with the Germans worsened throughout the war. Among other things, he was against the arrest and deportation of the Norwegian Jews and was in favor of the administration of Jewish affairs being placed under the Ministry of the Interior. Terboven eventually made it clear that Norway&#x27;s position would be stronger if Hagelin disappeared.

Rumors gradually circulated within NS that Hagelin was of Jewish blood, and that he was corrupt. The rumors became so strong that Quisling had to launch an investigation. While this was going on, Hagelin was stripped of his post as county manager in Greater Oslo. The investigation cleared Hagelin. Nevertheless, he was later forced to resign in the autumn of 1944, when he refused to go to Finnmark to lead the forced evacuation. For the rest of the occupation, he lived in seclusion on Bygdøy.

== Death ==
Hagelin was sentenced to death during the Norwegian post-war trials. He was executed by firing squad at Oslo&#x27;s Akershus Fortress, where many of the 37 individuals condemned for treason and war crimes were executed.

<text>Highway 19A, known locally as the &quot;Oceanside Route&quot; or the Old Island Highway, is a provincial highway in British Columbia, Canada. It runs along two former sections of Highway 19 on Vancouver Island, within Nanaimo and between Craig&#x27;s Crossing and Campbell River. The section of Highway 19A between Craig&#x27;s Crossing and Campbell River is long, and the Nanaimo alignment covers . The highway was established after Highway 19 was realigned to a new road between 1996 and 2001.

==Route description==

===Nanaimo===
Highway 19A&#x27;s Nanaimo alignment begins at Stewart Avenue (Trans-Canada Highway / Highway 1) at the entrance to the Departure Bay ferry terminal and proceeds up Brechin Road to Terminal Avenue. The highway then turns north and proceeds through the northern business district of the city to northern end of the Nanaimo Parkway (Highway 19).

Terminal Avenue between Stewart Avenue and Brechin Road is signed as an alternate connection between Highways 1 and 19A and a bypass of the Departure Bay ferry terminal.

===Oceanside section===
Highway 19A&#x27;s northern alignment begins at the junction of Highway 19 at Craig&#x27;s Crossing and hugs the coastline for through Parksville and the town of Qualicum Beach. The highway continues northwest for through the settlements Bowser, Deep Bay, and Fanny Bay before it meets a junction with Highway 19 at the Buckley Bay B.C. Ferry terminal.

From Buckley Bay, Highway 19A once again hugs the coastline as it proceeds northwest through the hamlets of Union Bay and Royston for before entering the city of Courtenay. Highway 19A proceeds through the southern part of the city of Courtenay on Cliffe Avenue, then crosses the Courtenay River on one of only two road drawbridges on Vancouver Island (also known as the 17th street bridge), intersects with the main road into Comox, and travels along a bypass around the city centre. Highway 19A then intersects Ryan Road, which provides access to the Comox ferry terminal in Little River and CFB Comox, and leaves Courtenay at the intersection with Headquarters Road. This stretch of highway 19A through the main city of Courtenay is heavily congested. The highway continues inland for , through the communities of Grantham, Merville, Black Creek, and Oyster River before rejoining the coastline at the intersection with Oyster Garden Road. From there, the highway hugs the coastline for , entering the city of Campbell River, passing by the B.C. Ferry terminal at Discovery Pier, and going north and west around the City Centre before terminating at the junction of Highways 19 and 28.

<text>Baldwin VII (1093 – 17 July 1119) was Count of Flanders from 1111 to 1119.

Baldwin was the son of Count Robert II of Flanders and Clementia of Burgundy. He succeeded his father as count when he died on 5 October 1111.

==Reign==
Baldwin succeeded his father as count when he died on 5 October 1111. He was under the influence of his powerful mother Clementia of Burgundy. He tried to assert independence from her, but she still remained influential behind the scenes. Baldwin was an impetuous and impulsive young man, extremely hostile towards Henry I of England. The inexperienced new count solicited the advice of his cousin, Charles the Good, who was several years older. It was Baldwin who arranged the marriage of Charles to the heiress of the County of Amiens, Margaret of Clermont, in 1118. Baldwin invaded Normandy in 1118 and raided many towns.

In 1105, Baldwin married Hawise of Brittany (also called Havide), daughter of Duke Alan IV of Brittany. The groom was twelve and the bride nine. The union, in all probability, was never consummated. They were divorced in 1110. Baldwin did not remarry. Baldwin and Hawise had no known issue. 

==Death==
He died after being wounded in 1118, hit on the head by a lance at the Battle of Bures-en-Bray, where he was fighting Henry I of England, on behalf of Louis VI of France. When he was dying in 1119 at Eu, Baldwin declared his cousin Charles his heir. he died on 17 June 1119. Charles became the new count of Flanders after his death.

<doc id="360750" wikidata="Q33567" url="?curid=360750" title="Frederick Catherwood">
<text>Frederick Catherwood (27 February 1799 – 27 September 1854) was an English artist, architect and explorer, best remembered for his meticulously detailed drawings of the ruins of the Maya civilization. He explored Mesoamerica in the mid 19th century with writer John Lloyd Stephens. Their books, &quot;Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatán&quot; and &quot;Incidents of Travel in Yucatán&quot;, were best sellers and introduced to the Western world the civilization of the ancient Maya. In 1837, Catherwood was elected into the National Academy of Design as an Honorary member.

== Mediterranean travels ==
Catherwood, having made many trips to the Mediterranean between 1824 and 1832 to draw the monuments made by the Egyptians, Carthaginians, and Phoenicians, stated that the monuments in the Americas bear no architectural similarity to those in the Old World. Thus, they must have been made by the native people of the area.
Catherwood made visits to Greece, Turkey, Egypt, and Palestine and with Joseph Bonomi the Younger made drawings and watercolors of the ancient remains there. During a six-week period in 1833, Catherwood was probably the first Westerner to make a detailed survey of the Dome of the Rock in Jerusalem.

Catherwood developed a reputation as a topographical artist. He perfected a drawing technique which used the &quot;camera lucida&quot; and supplied the drawings for the panoramas of Jerusalem and Thebes shown by Robert Burford in Leicester Square.

== Central America ==

In 1836 he met travel writer John Lloyd Stephens in London. They read the account of the ruins of Copán published by Juan Galindo, and decided to try to visit Central America for themselves and produce a more detailed and better illustrated account. The expedition came together in 1839 and continued through the following year, visiting dozens of ruins and resulting in the detailed description of 44 sites, many for the first time. Stephens and Catherwood are credited for the rediscovery of the Maya civilization, and through their publications brought the Maya back into the minds of the Western World.

The expedition resulted in the book &quot;Incidents of Travel in Central America, Chiapas, and Yucatan&quot;, published in 1841, with text by Stephens and engravings based on the drawings of Catherwood.

Stephens and Catherwood returned to Yucatan to make further explorations, resulting in &quot;Incidents of Travel in Yucatan&quot; in 1843.

The following year Catherwood published &quot;Views of Ancient Monuments in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatan&quot;, with 25 colour lithographs from watercolours he made at various ruins. This folio was published in May 1844 simultaneously in London and New York in an edition of 300. Some 282 copies are known to survive, mostly held in private collections or libraries.

A large number of his original drawings and paintings were destroyed when the building where he was exhibiting them in New York City caught fire, but a number survive in museums and private collections, often showing more detail than the published engravings.

== Last years ==

With the California Gold Rush Catherwood moved to San Francisco, California to open up a store to supply miners and prospectors, which he considered a more likely way to make money than chasing after the gold himself.

In 1854, Frederick Catherwood was a passenger aboard the steamship &quot;Arctic&quot;, making a crossing of the Atlantic Ocean from Liverpool to New York. On 27 September in conditions of poor visibility, the &quot;Arctic&quot; collided with the French steamer &quot;Vesta&quot;, and sank with much loss of life, including Catherwood. Mysteriously Catherwood&#x27;s name was left off the official casualty lists for weeks until a concerted effort by his friends and colleagues resulted in a belated inclusion of a single line in the &quot;New York Herald Tribune&quot;, under the listing of &quot;The Saved and the Lost: &quot;Mr Catherwood Also is Missing&quot;&quot;. He was 55 years old.

== The question of his portrait ==
Traditionally, it is thought that the only portrait of Catherwood is in the famous Table XXIV of Views of Ancient Monuments in Central America, Chiapas and Yucatan, with a view of the temple of Tulum. The scholar Fabio Bourbon, after studies and a long reflection, has formulated a different hypothesis. It is well known that during the second expedition in Central America, Stephens and Catherwood were accompanied by a young surgeon (and ornithologist) from Boston, Samuel Cabot III, born in Boston on 20 September 1815. The Cabot family was part of the upper class in Boston. At the time of the trip, he was almost 27 years old. Years later he would become an eminent surgeon and a well known personality in Boston. Samuel III was described as a person rather slender, tall, with light hair and light eyes. There is an image taken by Oliver Wendell Holmes (1809-1894) with members of the Boston Society for Medical Improvement, around 1853. Samuel is seated, third from left. Eleven years had passed since the adventure in Yucatan, but he could very well be the person depicted by Catherwood in the table, holding a measuring tape. Catherwood, in fact, was a pragmatic man, used to documenting the reality with his pencil. Frederick presumably had no interest in representing himself, indeed he never painted his self-portrait.

<text>Charles the Good (10842 March 1127) was Count of Flanders from 1119 to 1127. His murder and its aftermath were chronicled by Galbert of Bruges. He was beatified by Pope Leo XIII in 1882 through &quot;cultus&quot; &quot;confirmation&quot;.

==Early life==
Charles was born in Denmark, only son of the three children of King Canute IV (Saint Canute) and Adela of Flanders. His father was assassinated in Odense Cathedral in 1086, and Adela fled back to Flanders, taking the very young Charles with her but leaving her twin daughters Ingeborg and Cecilia in Denmark. Charles grew up at the comital court of his grandfather Robert I of Flanders and uncle Robert II of Flanders. In 1092 Adela went to southern Italy to marry Roger Borsa, duke of Apulia, leaving Charles in Flanders.

Charles travelled to the Holy Land in 1107 or 1108 with a fleet of English, Danish and Flemish crusaders. In 1124 he was offered the crown of the Kingdom of Jerusalem by a faction of the nobility opposed to King Baldwin II but refused, according to Galbert of Bruges, at the urging of his advisors, who feared that his departure would leave Flanders completely at the mercy of the Erembald clan.

==Countship of Flanders==
In 1111 Robert II died, and Charles&#x27;s cousin Baldwin VII of Flanders became count. Charles was a close adviser to the new count (who was several years younger), who around 1118 arranged Charles&#x27;s marriage to the heiress of the count of Amiens, Margaret of Clermont, daughter of Renaud II, Count of Clermont. The childless count Baldwin VII was wounded fighting at the Battle of Bures-en-Brai in September 1118, and he designated Charles as his successor before he died on 17 July 1119.

In 1125, he was also considered a candidate for the election of King of the Romans after the death of Henry V, but rejected the offer. During the famine that struck Flanders in that same year, Charles ordered legumes to be planted on his own estates and given away to the starving. He often stated, according to Galbert of Bruges, that it was better for the rich of Flanders to drink only water than for a single poor person to die of starvation. He distributed bread to the poor en masse and also launched a draconian crackdown against the very common business practice of buying up and hoarding grain and other food supplies during famine to drastically drive up the price and only much later selling it off at an enormous profit. For example, Charles expelled all the Jews from Flanders, attributing allegedly similar activities by Jewish merchants as a cause of additional suffering. Meanwhile, at the urging of his advisers, the count launched legal proceedings to reduce the extremely wealthy, politically connected, and demonstrably &quot;non&quot;-Jewish Erembald family, who were heavily engaged in these same disreputable business activities and many others like them, to the status of serfs. As a result, Bertulf, the head of the Erembald family, a Roman Catholic priest and provost of the Church of St. Donatian, masterminded a regime change conspiracy to assassinate Charles, replace him with his more pliable kinsman William of Ypres, and execute all of the Erembald family&#x27;s opponents among the Count&#x27;s advisors.

==Death==
On the morning of 2 March 1127 Charles was kneeling in prayer with his outstretched hand filled with coins in order to give alms to passing poor people inside the church of St. Donatian. During Mass and in violation of the Catholic teaching about the Real Presence, a group of knights answering to the Erembald family entered the church and hacked Charles to death with broadswords. The brutal and sacrilegious murder of the popular count provoked widespread public outrage, and he was almost immediately regarded popularly as a martyr and saint, although not formally beatified until 1882. The Erembalds, who had planned and carried out the murder of Charles, were besieged inside the comital castle of Bruges by the enraged nobles and commoners of Bruges and Ghent. All the conspirators were defeated, captured, and tortured to death. King Louis VI of France, who had supported the uprising against the Erembalds, then used his influence to select William Clito of the House of Normandy as the next count of Flanders.

German planning documents initially referred to an equivalent . The political organization for this territory – after an initial period of military administration before its establishment – involved a German civilian administration, nominally under the authority of the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories led by Nazi ideologist Alfred Rosenberg, but actually controlled by the Nazi official Hinrich Lohse, its appointed .

The main political objective of the Nazis for the , as created by Adolf Hitler and laid out by the Reich Ministry was , which included the genocide of the local Jewish population, as well as the settlement of Germanic peoples along with the expulsion and murder of some of the native population and the Germanization of the rest. These policies applied not only to the but also to other German-occupied Soviet territories.

In the course of 1943 and 1944, the Soviet Red Army gradually recaptured most of the Ostland territory in their advance westwards, but forces held out in the Courland Pocket until May 1945. With the end of World War II in Europe and the defeat of Germany in 1945, the ceased to exist.

==History==
===Planning before the attack on the Soviet Union===

Originally the &quot;Reichsminister&quot; for the Occupied Eastern Territories (), Alfred Rosenberg envisioned usage of the term &quot;Baltenland&quot; (&quot;Baltic Land&quot;) before the summer of 1941 for the area that would eventually be known as &quot;Ostland&quot;. Otto Bräutigam, a major colleague of Rosenberg at the time, opposed this idea. In a later declaration he alleged that Rosenberg (himself a Baltic German), was influenced by his &quot;Baltic friends&quot; in forwarding this initiative, in which a &quot;Baltic &quot;Reichskommissariat&quot;&quot; with the addition of Belarus would be formed, &quot;and with this the White Ruthenians would also be regarded as Balts&quot;. A more important additional colleague of Rosenberg, Georg Leibbrandt, spoke out against this. He argued that the sympathy of the Baltic peoples, who would naturally want the use of their own terminology, could be lost entirely. They would therefore not be won over either as supporters of the German war effort, nor as racially valuable settlers for the region.

===After Operation Barbarossa===
After the German invasion of the Soviet Union, vast areas were conquered to Germany&#x27;s east. At first these areas would remain under military occupation by &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; authorities (Army Group Rear Areas), but as soon as the military situation allowed it, a more permanent form of administration under German rule for these territories would be instituted.
&quot;Führer&quot; Decree of 17 July 1941 provided for this move. It established &quot;Reichskommissariats&quot; in the east, as administrative units of the Greater German Reich. The structure of each &quot;Reichskommissariat&quot; was defined by the same decree. Each of these territories would be led by a German civil governor known as a Reichskommissar appointed by Hitler and answerable only to him. The official appointed for Ostland was Hinrich Lohse, the &quot;Oberpräsident&quot; and &quot;Gauleiter&quot; of Schleswig-Holstein. Local government in the &quot;Reichskommissariat&quot; was to be organized under a &quot;National Director&quot; (&quot;Reichskomissar&quot;) in Estonia, a &quot;General Director&quot; in Latvia, and a &quot;General Adviser&quot; in Lithuania.

Rosenberg&#x27;s ministerial authority was, in practice, severely limited. The first reason was that many of the practicalities were determined elsewhere: the &quot;Wehrmacht&quot; and the &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; managed the military and security aspects, Fritz Sauckel as Reich Director of Labour had control over manpower and working areas, Hermann Göring and Albert Speer had total management of economic aspects in the territories and the Reich Postal Service administered the Eastern territories&#x27; postal services. These German central government interventions in the affairs of Ostland overriding the appropriate ministries were known as &quot;special administrations&quot; (&quot;Sonderverwaltungen&quot;). Later, from September 1941, the civil administration that had been decreed in the previous July was actually set up. Lohse and Erich Koch objected to these breaches of their supposed responsibilities, seeking to administer their territories with the independence and authority of Gauleiters. On 1 April 1942, an &quot;arbeitsbereich&quot; (lit. &quot;working sphere&quot;, a name for the party cadre organisation outside the Reich proper) was established in the civilian-administered parts of the occupied Soviet territories, whereupon Koch and Lohse gradually ceased communication with Rosenberg, preferring to deal directly with Adolf Hitler through Martin Bormann and the Party Chancellery. In the process they also displaced all other actors including notably the SS, except in Central Belarus where HSSPF Erich von dem Bach-Zelewski had a special command encompassing both military and civil administration territories and engaged in Nazi security warfare.

In July 1941, the civil administration was declared in much of the occupied Soviet territories before one had materialised in the field. A power vacuum emerged which the SS filled with its SS and Police Leadership Structure, exercising unlimited power over security and policing which it gave up only grudgingly in the autumn when civil administration came into being; indeed Heinrich Himmler would use various tactics until as late as 1943 in unsuccessful efforts to regain this power. This partly explains the strained relations between the SS and the civil administration. In Ostland, matters were further complicated by the personality of the local superior SS officer Friedrich Jeckeln, attacked by the SS&#x27;s opponents for his alleged corruption, brutality and mindless foolhardiness.

== German plans ==

The short-term political objectives for Ostland differed from those for the Ukraine, the Caucasus or the Moscow regions. The Baltic lands, which were to be joined together with Belarus (to serve as a spacious hinterland of the coastal areas), would be organised as one Germanized protectorate prior to union with Germany itself in the near future. Rosenberg said that these lands had a fundamentally &quot;European&quot; character, resulting from 700 years of history under Swedish, Danish, and German rule, and should therefore provide Germany with &quot;Lebensraum&quot;, an opinion shared by Hitler and other leading Nazis. The Belarusians, however, were considered by the scholars of the Reich Ministry for the Occupied Eastern Territories as &quot;little and weak peasant people&quot; dwelling in &quot;folkish indifference&quot;, but also &quot;the most harmless and because of this the least dangerous for us of all the peoples in the Eastern Space&quot; and an ideal object of exploitation. Rosenberg suggested that Belarus would be in the future an appropriate reception area of various undesirable population elements from the Baltic part of Ostland and German-occupied Poland. He also toyed with the idea of turning the country into a huge nature reserve.

The regime planned to encourage the post-war settlement of Germans to the region, seeing it as a region traditionally inhabited by Germans (see the Teutonic Order and the Northern Crusades) that had been overrun by Slavs. This was tried in practice in the province of Pskov during World War II, when ethnically German and Dutch people were resettled from Romania. This settlement of Dutch settlers was encouraged by the &quot;Nederlandsche Oost-Compagnie&quot;, a Dutch-German organisation.

Historical German and Germanic-sounding placenames were also retained (or introduced) for many Baltic cities, such as &quot;Reval&quot; (Tallinn), &quot;Kauen&quot; (Kaunas), and &quot;Dünaburg&quot; (Daugavpils), among many others. To underscore the region&#x27;s planned incorporation into Germany some Nazi ideologists further suggested the future use of the names &quot;Peipusland&quot; for Estonia and &quot;Dünaland&quot; for Latvia once they had become part of Germany. The ancient Russian city of Novgorod, the easternmost foreign trading post of the Hanseatic League, was to be renamed &quot;Holmgard&quot;. During the occupation, the Germans also published a &quot;local&quot; German-language newspaper, the &quot;Deutsche Zeitung im Ostland&quot;.

== Administrative and territorial organization ==

The &quot;Reichskommissariat Ostland&quot; was sub-divided into four &quot;General Regions&quot; (&quot;Generalbezirke&quot;), namely Estonia, Latvia, Lithuania, and White Ruthenia (Belarus), headed by a &quot;Generalkommissar&quot;. The regions were further divided into &quot;Districts&quot; (&quot;Kreisgebiete&quot;). In the three Baltic states their previous counties (Es:Maakonnad, Lv:Aprinka, Lt:Apskritys) were also retained as a further sub-division (&quot;Kreise&quot;). The conquered territories further to the east were under military control for the entirety of the war. The intention was to include these territories in the anticipated future extension of Ostland. This would have incorporated Ingria (&quot;Ingermannland&quot;), as well as the Smolensk, Pskov, and Novgorod areas into the &quot;Reichskommissariat&quot;. Estonia&#x27;s new eastern border was planned to be extent to the Leningrad-Novgorod line, with Lake Ilmen and Volkhov River forming the new eastern border of the Baltic country, while Latvia was to reach the Velikiye Luki region. Belarus was to extend east to include the Smolensk region.
The local administration of the &quot;Reichskommissariat Ostland &quot;was headed by &quot;Reichskommissar&quot; Hinrich Lohse. Below him there was an administrative hierarchy: a &quot;Generalkomissar&quot; led each &quot;Generalbezirk&quot;, while &quot;Gebietskommissars&quot; administered &quot;Kreisgebieten&quot;, respectively. The German administrative center for the entire region, as well as the seat of the &quot;Reichskommissar&quot;, was in Riga, Latvia.

=== Other authorities ===

In March 1943, Wilhelm Kube succeeded in installing the Belarusian Central Council (a collaborationist puppet regime), which existed concurrently with the German civil administration. 

The military command was controlled by the &quot;Wehrmachtbefehlshaber Ostland&quot; (&quot;Military Commander Ostland&quot;). He was responsible for security within the occupied territories, to protect traffic connections and to record the harvest. These commanders were :
* Generalleutnant Walter Braemer (24 June 1941 – 18 April 1944)
* General der Panzertruppe Werner Kempf (1 May 1944 – 10 August 1944)

==Policies==
Upon taking control, Hinrich Lohse proclaimed the official decree (&quot;Verkündungsblatt für das Ostland&quot;) on November 15, 1941, whereby all Soviet state and party properties in the Baltic area and Belarus were confiscated and transferred to the German administration.

In Ostland, the administration returned lands nationalised by the Soviets to the former peasant owners. In towns and cities, small workshops, industries and businesses were returned to their former owners, subject to promises to pay taxes and quotas to the authorities. Jewish properties were confiscated. In Belarus, a state enterprise was established to manage all former Soviet government properties. One of the German administrators was General commissar Wilhelm Kube.

&quot;Ostgesellschaften&quot; (state monopolies) and so-called &quot;Patenfirmen&quot;, private industrial companies representing the German government, were quickly appointed to manage confiscated enterprises. The Hermann Göring Workshops, Mannesmann, IG Farben and Siemens assumed control of all former Soviet state enterprises in Ostland and Ukraine. An example of this was the takeover, by Daimler-Benz and Vomag, of heavy repair workshops, in Riga and Kiev, for the maintenance of all captured Russian T-34 and KV-1 tanks, linked with their repair workshops in Germany.

In Belarus, the German authorities lamented the &quot;Jewish-Bolshevik&quot; policies that had allegedly denied the people knowledge of the basic concepts of property, ownership, or personal initiative. Unlike the Baltic area, where the authorities saw that &quot;during the war and the occupation&#x27;s first stages, the population gave examples of sincere collaboration, a way for possibly giving some liberty to autonomous administration&quot;.

===Economic exploitation===
The Nazis viewed Slavs as a pool of slave labor for use by the German Reich; if necessary they could be worked to death.

===Extermination of the Jews in Ostland===

At the time of the German invasion in June 1941 there were significant Jewish minorities in Ostland – nearly 480,000 people. To these were added deportees from Austria, Germany, and elsewhere.

Jews were confined to Nazi ghettos in Riga and Kauen, which rapidly became overcrowded and squalid. From these they were taken to execution sites.

The Soviet Red Army reported the discovery of Vilna and Kauen extermination centres as apparently part of the Nazi &quot;Final Solution&quot;. The extermination of the resident Jews began almost immediately after the invasion and was later extended to the deportees.

In autumn 1943, the ghettos were &quot;liquidated&quot;, and the remaining occupants were moved to camps at Kaiserwald and Stutthof near Danzig or, if not capable of work, killed.

==Government figures==
Aside from the German political leaders mentioned above, including Reich Minister Alfred Rosenberg, General Commissar Karl-Siegmund Litzmann and General Commissar Wilhelm Kube, the regional collaborationist structures across &quot;Reichskommissariat Ostland&quot; included Estonian political leaders such as Hjalmar Mäe, Oskar Angelus, Alfred Wendt (or Vendt), Otto Leesment, Hans Saar, Oskar Öpik, Arnold Radik, Johannes Soodla; Latvian political leaders with Oskars Dankers, and Rūdolfs Bangerskis; Lithuanian political leaders: Juozas Ambrazevičius, and Petras Kubiliūnas; as well as the Belarusian nationalist leaders from the Belarusian Central Council.

==Partisan movement==
German and local security authorities were kept busy by Soviet partisan activities in Belarus. They noted that &quot;infected zones&quot; of partisan action included an area of 500 or 600 km2, around Minsk, Pinsk, Gomel, Bryansk, Smolensk and Vitebsk, including the principal roads and railways in these areas.

<doc id="360756" wikidata="Q2010" url="?curid=360756" title="Eiichiro Oda">
<text>is a Japanese manga artist and the creator of the series &quot;One Piece&quot;. With more than 520 million &quot;tankōbon&quot; copies in circulation worldwide, &quot;One Piece&quot; is both the best-selling manga in history and the best-selling comic series printed in volume, in turn making Oda one of the best-selling fiction authors. The series&#x27; popularity resulted in Oda being named one of the manga artists that changed the history of manga.

== Early life ==
Eiichiro Oda was born on January 1, 1975, in Kumamoto, Japan. At the age of four he resolved to become a manga artist in order to avoid having to get a &quot;real job&quot;. His biggest influence was Akira Toriyama and his series &quot;Dragon Ball&quot;. He recalls that his interest in pirates was probably sparked by the popular TV animation series titled &quot;Vicky the Viking&quot;.

== Career ==
At the age of 17, Oda submitted his work &quot;Wanted!&quot; and won several awards, including second place in the coveted Tezuka Award. That got him into a job at the &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; magazine, where he originally worked as assistant manga artist/assistant to Shinobu Kaitani&#x27;s series &quot;Suizan Police Gang&quot; before moving to Masaya Tokuhiro on &quot;Jungle King Tar-chan&quot; and &quot;Mizu no Tomodachi Kappaman&quot;, which gave him an unexpected influence on his artistic style. At the age of 19, he began working as an assistant to Nobuhiro Watsuki on &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;, before winning the Hop Step Award for new manga artists. Watsuki credits Oda for helping create the character Honjō Kamatari who appears in &quot;Rurouni Kenshin&quot;.

During this time, Oda drew two pirate-themed one-shot stories called &quot;Romance Dawn&quot;, which were published in &quot;Akamaru Jump&quot; and &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; respectively in late 1996. &quot;Romance Dawn&quot; featured Monkey D. Luffy as the protagonist, who then became the protagonist of &quot;One Piece&quot;.

In 1997, &quot;One Piece&quot; began serialization in &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; and has become not only one of the most popular manga in Japan, but the best-selling manga series of all time. It sold 100 million collected &quot;tankōbon&quot; volumes by February 2005, over 200 million by February 2011, had 320,866,000 copies printed worldwide by December 2014, 430 million volumes in circulation worldwide as of October 2017, 440million copies sold as of May 2018 and 450million in print as of March 2019.

Additionally, individual volumes of &quot;One Piece&quot; have broken publishing records in Japan. Volume 56 received the highest initial print run of any manga, 2.85 million copies, in 2009. Volume 57&#x27;s print of 3 million in 2010 was the highest first print for any book in Japan, not just manga. A record that was broken several times by subsequent volumes and currently held by 67&#x27;s 4.05 million initial printing in 2012. In 2013, the series won the 41st Japan Cartoonists Association Award Grand Prize, alongside Kimuchi Yokoyama&#x27;s &quot;Nekodarake Nice&quot;.

In a 2008 poll, conducted by marketing research firm Oricon, Oda was elected fifth most favorite manga artists of Japan. He shared the place with Yoshihiro Togashi, creator of &quot;YuYu Hakusho&quot; and &quot;Hunter × Hunter&quot;. In their 2010 poll on the Mangaka that Changed the History of Manga, Oda came in fourth.

For the tenth &quot;One Piece&quot; animated theatrical film, &quot;Strong World&quot;, Oda created the film&#x27;s story, drew over 120 drawings for guidance and insisted Mr. Children provide the theme song. Additionally, a special chapter of the manga was created and included in &quot;tankōbon&quot; volume 0, which was given free to attendees of the film and also contained his drawings for the film. Following the particular success of this film, Oda also provided the character design for and executive produced the subsequent movies &quot;Z&quot; (2012), &quot;Gold&quot; (2016), &quot;Stampede&quot; (2019), and &quot;Red&quot; (2022).

Oda and Akira Toriyama created a 2007 crossover one-shot called &quot;Cross Epoch&quot;, that contains characters from Toriyama&#x27;s &quot;Dragon Ball&quot; and Oda&#x27;s &quot;One Piece&quot;. In 2013, they each designed a Gaist character for the video game &quot;Gaist Crusher&quot;. In 2011, Oda and Mitsutoshi Shimabukuro created the &quot;One Piece&quot; and &quot;Toriko&quot; crossover one-shot &quot;Taste of the Devil Fruit&quot;. Shimabukuro stated that he came up with the bulk of the story while Oda gave suggestions.

== Personal life ==
Since November 7, 2004, Eiichiro Oda has been married to Chiaki Inaba (稲葉ちあき, Inaba Chiaki), a former model, actress and tarento. Oda met her in late 2003 during Jump Festa festival 2004 where Chiaki Inaba played Nami during &quot;ONE PIECE Spectacle Stage&quot;, a official One Piece stage show. 
Oda and Inaba have had two daughters, the eldest born in 2006 and the youngest in 2009.

Eiichiro Oda owns a manor alongside his workplace in Jiyugaoka (自由が丘, Jiyūgaoka), a wealthy neighborhood located in southern Meguro, in Tokyo Metropolitan area. Oda acquired this home shortly after his marriage. His wife and daughters live here.

Oda regarded many mangaka both as his friends and rivals. Among these were his fellow assistants under Nobuhiro Watsuki; Hiroyuki Takei, and Mikio Itō. Still many years later, they remained good friends. For the title page illustration of &quot;One Piece&quot; chapter 766, which ran in 2014&#x27;s 50th issue of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump &quot;alongside the final two chapters of Kishimoto&#x27;s &quot;Naruto&quot;, Oda included a hidden message and other tributes in the art. Kishimoto himself also gave tribute in the ending of &quot;Naruto&quot; where the character Boruto Uzumaki makes a drawing of the Straw Hat Jolly Roger on a mountain. Upon the release of Chapter 1,000 of &quot;One Piece&quot;, several of Oda&#x27;s fellow mangaka rivals paid tribute in the author&#x27;s comment section of &quot;Weekly Shōnen Jump&quot; by congratulating Oda for achieving this milestone.

According to Oda himself and his manga editors, he is an ardent worker and perfectionist, sleeping only three hours per day during a typical work week.

He was hospitalized for a peritonsillar abscess in 2013 and later discharged from the hospital after two weeks. After a year, he underwent a tonsillectomy to completely cure his condition.

Oda gifted Kumamoto Prefecture ¥800 million (US$8M/£4.9M) in 2018 after it suffered a damaging earthquake in 2016 that had affected its iconic Kumamoto Castle. Oda&#x27;s ¥800M donation was offered in two separate gifts, one for ¥500M under Luffy&#x27;s name (Luffy&#x27;s current bounty at the time) and a second donation of ¥300M. Eiichiro Oda has long been a supporter of earthquake-stricken areas, writing supportive messages, contributing art for local products, and participating in the ONE PIECE Kumamoto Revival Project.
