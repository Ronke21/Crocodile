<text>A European Championship is the top level international sports competition between European athletes or sports teams representing their respective countries or professional sports clubs. 

In the plural, the European Championships also refers to a specific combined quadrennial multi-sport event featuring the continental championships for athletics, aquatics, artistic gymnastics, triathlon, rowing, cycling and team golf.

Since European championships are usually open for teams or individual athletes from countries which are members of European sports organisations and some member countries are only partly or not at all situated in the European continent, some non-Europeans also usually take part in these championships. Traditionally, sports teams from Armenia, Georgia, and Israel – all geographically outside Europe – are included in European competitions for cultural and political reasons, while trans-continental countries Azerbaijan, Russia, and Turkey (which straddle Europe and Asia), and technically Iceland (which sits on a continental fault line in the Atlantic ocean) and Malta (between Europe and Africa in the Mediterranean) also compete in Europe. 

A number of countries maintain departments outside the European continent, but which are considered an integral part of their mother country, including France (e.g. Guadeloupe and New Caledonia), Denmark (Greenland), Spain (e.g. the Canaries) and the Netherlands (the former Netherlands Antilles). Athletes and club teams from these regions are typically eligible for European championships. The overseas territories of the United Kingdom, however, are usually not included unless an individual athlete has transferred allegiance completely to the UK. 

In addition, in football, under UEFA, but not in other sports, the Asian country of Kazakhstan also competes in European competition for historical reasons, while South African clubs participate in the top-level club championship in European rugby union, The European Rugby Champions Cup.

<doc id="363400" wikidata="Q3532114" url="?curid=363400" title="Combinatorial topology">
<text>In mathematics, combinatorial topology was an older name for algebraic topology, dating from the time when topological invariants of spaces (for example the Betti numbers) were regarded as derived from combinatorial decompositions of spaces, such as decomposition into simplicial complexes. After the proof of the simplicial approximation theorem this approach provided rigour.

The change of name reflected the move to organise topological classes such as cycles-modulo-boundaries explicitly into abelian groups. This point of view is often attributed to Emmy Noether, and so the change of title may reflect her influence. The transition is also attributed to the work of Heinz Hopf, who was influenced by Noether, and to Leopold Vietoris and Walther Mayer, who independently defined homology.

A fairly precise date can be supplied in the internal notes of the Bourbaki group. While this kind of topology was still &quot;combinatorial&quot; in 1942, it had become &quot;algebraic&quot; by 1944. This corresponds also to the period where homological algebra and category theory were introduced for the study of topological spaces, and largely supplanted combinatorial methods.

More recently the term combinatorial topology has been revived for investigations carried out by treating topological objects as composed of pieces as in the older combinatorial topology, which is again found useful.

Azriel Rosenfeld (1973) proposed digital topology for a type of image processing that can be considered as a new development of combinatorial topology. The digital forms of the Euler characteristic theorem and the Gauss–Bonnet theorem were obtained by Li Chen and Yongwu Rong. A 2D grid cell topology already appeared in the Alexandrov–Hopf book Topologie I (1935).

Gottfried Wilhelm Leibniz had envisioned a form of combinatorial topology as early as 1679 in his work &quot;Characteristica Geometrica&quot;.

Yanai is a graduate of and the , where he took courses in psychological warfare. 

== Writing career ==

=== Scandal and exit from SDF ===
In 1992, while still employed by the SDF as an instructor of military history, he published an article in Japanese magazine &quot;Shūkan Bunshun&quot; in which he suggested that a coup was necessary to clean up corruption in the Japanese political establishment. The incident was described as &quot;an extreme source of embarrassment&quot; for the SDF; the public were more amused than outraged by the article, and even some of Yanai&#x27;s colleagues anonymously referred to him as a &quot;crackpot&quot;. In response, the SDF dismissed Yanai from his post. He was the first officer in any branch of the Self Defense Forces to be dismissed in response to his authorship of a newspaper article.

== Books ==
As well as political writing, Yanai has authored a number of books about shocking torture and execution methods throughout the ages.

<text>Yusuf Hazziez (born Joseph Arrington Jr.; August 8, 1935 – August 13, 1982), known professionally as Joe Tex, was an American singer and musician who gained success in the 1960s and 1970s with his brand of Southern soul, which mixed the styles of funk, country, gospel, and rhythm and blues.

His career started after he was signed to King Records in 1955 following four wins at the Apollo Theater. Between 1955 and 1964, he struggled to find hits, and by the time he finally recorded his first hit, &quot;Hold What You&#x27;ve Got&quot; in 1964, he had recorded 30 previous singles that were deemed failures on the charts. He went on to have four million-selling hits: &quot;Hold What You&#x27;ve Got&quot; (1965), &quot;Skinny Legs and All&quot; (1967), &quot;I Gotcha&quot; (1972), and &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gonna Bump No More (With No Big Fat Woman)&quot; (1977).

Tex was nominated for the Rock &amp; Roll Hall of Fame six times, most recently in 2017.

==Early life==
Joe Tex was born Joseph Arrington, Jr. in Rogers, Texas, in Bell County to Joseph Arrington and Cherie Sue (Jackson) Arrington. He and his sister Mary Sue were initially raised by their grandmother, Mary Richardson. After their parents divorced, Cheri Arrington moved to Baytown. Tex played baritone saxophone in the high-school band and sang in a local Pentecostal church choir. He entered several talent shows, and after an important win in Houston, he won $300 and a trip to New York City. Joe Tex took part in the amateur portion of the Apollo Theater, winning first place four times, which led to his discovery by Henry Glover, who offered him a contract with King Records. His mother&#x27;s wish was that he graduate from high school first, and Glover agreed to wait a year before signing him at age 19.

==Music career==
===Early recordings===
Tex recorded for King Records between 1955 and 1957 with little success. He later claimed he sold musical rights to the composition &quot;Fever&quot; to King Records staff to get money to pay his rent. The song&#x27;s credited songwriters, Otis Blackwell (who used the pseudonym John Davenport) and Joe Cooley, disputed Tex&#x27;s claims. Labelmate Little Willie John had a hit with &quot;Fever&quot;, which inspired Tex to write the first of his answer songs, &quot;Pneumonia&quot;.

In 1958, he signed with Ace and continued to have relative failures, but he was starting to build a unique stage reputation, opening for artists such as Jackie Wilson, James Brown, and Little Richard. He perfected the microphone tricks and dance moves that defined the rest of his career. Many, including Little Richard, claim that Tex&#x27;s future nemesis James Brown stole Tex&#x27;s dance moves and microphone tricks. In 1960, he left Ace and briefly recorded for Detroit&#x27;s Anna Records label, scoring a Bubbling Under &quot;Billboard&quot; hit with his cover version of Etta James&#x27; &quot;All I Could Do Was Cry&quot;. By then, Tex&#x27;s use of rapping over his music was starting to become commonplace.

In 1961, he recorded his composition &quot;Baby You&#x27;re Right&quot; for Anna. Later that year, James Brown recorded a cover version, though with different lyrics and a different musical composition, gaining songwriting credit, making it a hit in 1962, and reaching number two on the R&amp;B chart. During this time, Tex first began working with Buddy Killen, who formed the Dial Records label behind Tex. After a number of songs failed to chart, Killen decided to have Atlantic Records distribute his recordings with Dial in 1964. By the time he signed with Atlantic, Tex had recorded 30 songs, all of which had failed to make an impact on the charts.

===Success===
Tex recorded and finally scored his first hit, &quot;Hold What You&#x27;ve Got&quot;, in November 1964 at FAME Studios in Muscle Shoals, Alabama. He was unconvinced the song would be a hit and advised Killen not to release it. However, Killen felt otherwise and released the song in early 1965. By the time Tex got wind of its release, the song had already sold 200,000 copies. The song eventually peaked at number five on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 and became Tex&#x27;s first number-one hit on the R&amp;B charts, staying on the charts for 11 weeks and selling more than a million copies by 1966.

Tex placed six top-40 charted singles on the R&amp;B charts in 1965 alone, including two more number-one hits, &quot;I Want To (Do Everything For You)&quot; and &quot;A Sweet Woman Like You&quot;. He followed that with two successive albums, &quot;Hold On To What You&#x27;ve Got&quot; and &quot;The New Boss&quot;. He placed more R&amp;B hits than any artist, including his rival James Brown. In 1966, five more singles entered the top 40 on the R&amp;B charts, including &quot;The Love You Save&quot; and &quot;S.Y.S.L.J.F.M.&quot; or &quot;The Letter Song&quot;, which was an answer song to Wilson Pickett&#x27;s &quot;634-5789 (Soulsville, U.S.A.)&quot;.

His 1967 hits included &quot;Show Me&quot;, which became an often-covered tune for British rock artists and later some country and pop artists, and his second million-selling hit, &quot;Skinny Legs and All&quot;. The latter song, released off Tex&#x27;s pseudo-live album, &quot;Live and Lively&quot;, stayed on the charts for 15 weeks and was awarded a gold disc by the Recording Industry Association of America (RIAA) in January 1968. After leaving Atlantic for Mercury, Tex had several more R&amp;B hits including &quot;Buying a Book&quot; in 1970 and &quot;Give the Baby Anything the Baby Wants&quot; in 1971. The intro saxophone riffs in his 1969 song, &quot;You&#x27;re Right, Ray Charles&quot; later influenced Funkadelic&#x27;s &quot;Standing on the Verge of Gettin&#x27; It On&quot;.

Tex recorded his next big hit, &quot;I Gotcha&quot;, in December 1971. The song was released in January 1972 and stayed on the charts for 20 weeks, staying at number two on the Hot 100 for two weeks and sold more than 2 million copies, becoming his biggest-selling hit to date. Tex was offered a gold disc of the song on March 22, 1972. The parent album reached number 17 on the pop albums chart. The song would later be included in director Quentin Tarantino&#x27;s 1992 film debut &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;. Following this and another album, Tex announced his retirement from show business in September 1972 to pursue life as a minister for Islam. Tex returned to his music career following the death of Elijah Muhammad in 1975, releasing the top-40 R&amp;B hit, &quot;Under Your Powerful Love&quot;. His last hit, &quot;Ain&#x27;t Gonna Bump No More (With No Big Fat Woman)&quot;, was released in 1977 and peaked at number 12 on the Hot 100 and number 2 in the UK.

His last public appearances were as part of a revised 1980s version of the Soul Clan in 1981. After that, Tex withdrew from public life, settling at his ranch in Navasota, Texas, and watching football games by his favorite team, the Houston Oilers.

===Rivalry with James Brown===
The feud between Tex and fellow label mate James Brown allegedly originated sometime in the mid-1950s, when both artists were signed to associated imprints of King Records, when Brown reportedly called out on Tex for a &quot;battle&quot; during a dance at a local juke joint. In 1960, Tex left King and recorded a few songs for Detroit-based Anna Records; one of the songs he recorded was the ballad &quot;Baby, You&#x27;re Right&quot;. A year later, Brown recorded the song and released it in 1961, changing the lyrics and the musical composition, earning Brown co-songwriting credits along with Tex. By then, Brown had recruited singer Bea Ford, who had been married to Tex but had divorced him in 1959. In 1960, Brown and Ford recorded the song, &quot;You&#x27;ve Got the Power&quot;. Shortly afterward, Tex got a personal letter from Brown telling him that he was through with Ford and if Tex wanted her back, he could have her. Tex responded by recording the diss record &quot;You Keep Her&quot; in 1962.

In 1963, their feud escalated when Tex and Brown performed a concert in Macon, Georgia. Tex, who opened the show, imitated Brown by appearing in a torn, tattered cape and rolling around on the floor screaming, &quot;Please—somebody help get me out of this cape!&quot; Brown, already angry with Tex over the song &quot;You Keep Her&quot;, left the club and returned with guns. Tex had left the club before the shooting commenced. The incident led to multiple people being shot and stabbed. Since Brown was still on parole at the time, he relied on his agent Clint Brantley &quot;and a few thousand dollars to make the situation disappear&quot;. According to fellow performer Johnny Jenkins, &quot;seven people got shot&quot;, and after the shootout ended, a man appeared and gave &quot;each one of the injured a hundred dollars apiece not to carry it no further and not to talk to the press&quot;. Brown was never charged for the incident. Tex later claimed that Brown stole his dance moves and his microphone stand tricks.

In a few interviews he gave in the 1960s, Tex dismissed the notion of Brown being called &quot;Soul Brother No. 1&quot;, insisting that Little Willie John was the original &quot;Soul Brother No. 1&quot;. Tex even claimed Brown stopped some radio disc jockeys from playing his hit &quot;Skinny Legs and All&quot;, which Tex claimed prevented Tex from taking down one of Brown&#x27;s number-one songs at the time. During a 1968 tour, Tex had the words &quot;The New Soul Brother No. 1&quot; on his tour bus, but eventually took the name off the bus and had it repainted. Tex challenged Brown to contest who &quot;the real soul brother&quot; was. Brown reportedly refused the challenge, telling the &quot;Afro-American&quot;, &quot;I will not fight a black man. You need too much help.&quot; While Tex moved on from his initial feud with Brown, Brown reportedly joked, &quot;Who?&quot; in his Bobby Byrd and Hank Ballard duet &quot;Funky Side of Town&quot; from his &quot;Get on the Good Foot&quot; album when Ballard mentioned Tex&#x27;s name as one of the stars of soul music.

==Personal life and death==
A convert to Islam in 1966, he changed his name to Yusuf Hazziez, and toured as a spiritual lecturer. He had two daughters, Eartha Doucet and Leslie Arrington, and four sons, Joseph Arrington III, Ramadan Hazziez, Jwaade Hazziez, and Joseph Hazziez.

Though he lived most of his life free of drugs and alcohol, according to his longtime producer Buddy Killen, Tex suffered from addiction during the last four years of his life. In his final performances as part of the Soul Clan, he appeared gaunt and unwell, and Killen claimed that Tex had &quot;lost his will to live&quot;.

In early August 1982, Tex was found at the bottom of a swimming pool at his home in Navasota, after which he was revived in hospital and sent home. Just a few days later, on August 13, five days after his 47th birthday, he died at Grimes Memorial Hospital in Navasota, following a heart attack.

==Cover versions==
Several other artists have covered Tex&#x27;s work. The Foundations covered &quot;Show Me&quot;. US R&amp;B group The Raelettes and UK hard rock band Nazareth covered &quot;I Want To (Do Everything for You)&quot;, and Phish performed &quot;You Better Believe It Baby&quot;.

<doc id="363405" wikidata="Q659265" url="?curid=363405" title="Richard Lewontin">
<text>Richard Charles Lewontin (March 29, 1929 – July 4, 2021) was an American evolutionary biologist, mathematician, geneticist, and social commentator. A leader in developing the mathematical basis of population genetics and evolutionary theory, he applied techniques from molecular biology, such as gel electrophoresis, to questions of genetic variation and evolution.

In a pair of seminal 1966 papers co-authored with J. L. Hubby in the journal &quot;Genetics&quot;, Lewontin helped set the stage for the modern field of molecular evolution. In 1979, he and Stephen Jay Gould introduced the term &quot;spandrel&quot; into evolutionary theory. From 1973 to 1998, he held an endowed chair in zoology and biology at Harvard University, and from 2003 until his death in 2021 he was a research professor there.

From a sociological perspective, Lewontin strongly opposed genetic determinism and neodarwinism as expressed in the fields of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology.

Previously, as a member of &quot;Science for the People&quot;, he denounced the involvement of prominent scientists in Pentagon programs aimed at developing weapons for the Vietnam War. From the 1990s, he condemned the lobbying of GMOs by the &quot;genetic-industrial complex&quot;.

==Early life and education==
Lewontin was born in New York City to parents descended from late 19th-century Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants. His father was a broker of textiles, and his mother a homemaker. He attended Forest Hills High School and the École Libre des Hautes Études in New York. In 1951 he graduated from Harvard College with a BS degree in biology. In 1952, Lewontin received an MS degree in mathematical statistics, followed by a PhD degree in zoology in 1954, both from Columbia University, where he was a student of Theodosius Dobzhansky.

He held faculty positions at North Carolina State University, the University of Rochester, and the University of Chicago. In 1973 Lewontin was appointed as Alexander Agassiz Professor of Zoology and Professor of Biology at Harvard University, holding the position until 1998.

==Career==

===Work in population genetics===
Lewontin worked in both theoretical and experimental population genetics. A hallmark of his work was an interest in new technology. In 1960, he and Ken-Ichi Kojima gave the equations for change of haplotype frequencies with interacting natural selection at two loci. Their paper gave a theoretical derivation of the equilibria expected, and also investigated the dynamics of the model by computer iteration. Lewontin later introduced the D&#x27; measure of linkage disequilibrium.

In 1966, he and J. L. Hubby published a paper that studied the amount of heterozygosity in a population. They used protein gel electrophoresis to survey dozens of loci in the fruit fly &quot;Drosophila pseudoobscura&quot;, and reported that a large fraction of the loci were polymorphic, and that at the average locus there was about a 15% chance that the individual was heterozygous. (Harry Harris reported similar results for humans at about the same time.) Previous work with gel electrophoresis had been reports of variation in single loci and did not give any sense of how common variation was.

Lewontin and Hubby&#x27;s paper also discussed the possible explanation of the high levels of variability by either balancing selection or neutral mutation. Martin Kreitman was later to do a pioneering survey of population-level variability in DNA sequences while a Ph.D. student in Lewontin&#x27;s lab.

===Work on human genetic diversity===
In a landmark paper published in 1972, Lewontin identified that most of the variation (80–85%) within human populations is found within local geographic groups, and differences attributable to the &quot;race&quot; groups defined in his study are a minor part of human genetic variability (1–15%). In a 2003 paper, A. W. F. Edwards criticized Lewontin&#x27;s conclusion that race is an invalid taxonomic construct, terming it Lewontin&#x27;s fallacy. He showed that the probability of racial misclassification of an individual based on variation in a single genetic locus is approximately 30%, but the misclassification probability becomes close to zero if enough loci are studied. That is, it appears that a majority of genetic variation is found within groups only if a single locus is used, but the reverse is true if analyzing a multiplicity of loci. Edwards&#x27; paper was commented on by Jonathan Marks, who argued that &quot;the point of the theory of race was to discover large clusters of people that are principally homogeneous within and heterogeneous between, contrasting groups. Lewontin&#x27;s analysis shows that such groups do not exist in the human species, and Edwards&#x27; critique does not contradict that interpretation.&quot;

===Affiliations===
As of 2003, Lewontin was the Alexander Agassiz Research Professor at Harvard. He has worked with and had great influence on many philosophers of biology, including William C. Wimsatt, Elliott Sober, Philip Kitcher, Elisabeth Lloyd, Peter Godfrey-Smith, Sahotra Sarkar, and Robert Brandon, often inviting them to work in his lab.

Since 2013, Lewontin has been listed on the Advisory Council of the National Center for Science Education.

==Debates within mainstream evolutionary biology==
In 1975, when E. O. Wilson&#x27;s book &quot;&quot; proposed evolutionary explanations for human social behaviors, biologists including Lewontin, his Harvard colleagues Stephen Jay Gould and Ruth Hubbard responded negatively. Robert Trivers called these accusations &quot;coming from eminent biologists&quot; &quot;intellectually weak and lazy&quot;.

Lewontin and Gould introduced the term spandrel to evolutionary biology, inspired by the architectural term &quot;spandrel&quot;, in an influential 1979 paper, &quot;The Spandrels of San Marco and the Panglossian Paradigm: A Critique of the Adaptationist Programme.&quot; &quot;Spandrels&quot; were described as features of an organism that exist as a necessary consequence of other (perhaps adaptive) features, but do not directly improve fitness (and thus are not necessarily adaptive). 

Lewontin was an early proponent of a hierarchy of levels of selection in his article, &quot;The Units of Selection&quot;. He has been a major influence on philosophers of biology, notably William C. Wimsatt (who taught with Lewontin and Richard Levins at the University of Chicago), Robert Brandon and Elisabeth Lloyd (who studied with Lewontin as graduate students), Philip Kitcher, Elliott Sober, and Sahotra Sarkar. Lewontin briefly argued for the historical nature of biological causality in &quot;Is Nature Probable or Capricious?&quot;.

In &quot;Organism and Environment&quot; in &quot;Scientia&quot;, and in more popular form in the last chapter of &quot;Biology as Ideology&quot;, Lewontin argued that while traditional Darwinism has portrayed the organism as a passive recipient of environmental influences, a correct understanding should emphasize the organism as an active constructor of its own environment. Niches are not pre-formed, empty receptacles into which organisms are inserted, but are defined and created by organisms. The organism-environment relationship is reciprocal and dialectical. M. W. Feldman and others have developed Lewontin&#x27;s conception in more detailed models under the term niche construction.

In the adaptationist view of evolution, the organism is a function of both the organism and environment, while the environment is only a function of itself. The environment is seen as autonomous and unshaped by the organism. Lewontin instead believed in a constructivist view, in which the organism is a function of the organism and environment, with the environment being a function of the organism and environment as well. This means that the organism shapes the environment as the environment shapes the organism. The organism shapes the environment for future generations.

Lewontin criticized traditional neo-Darwinian approaches to adaptation. In his article &quot;Adaptation&quot; in the Italian &quot;Enciclopedia Einaudi&quot;, and in a modified version for &quot;Scientific American,&quot; he emphasized the need to give an engineering characterization of adaptation separate from measurement of number of offspring, rather than simply assuming organs or organisms are at adaptive optima. Lewontin said that his more general, technical criticism of adaptationism grew out of his recognition that the fallacies of sociobiology reflect fundamentally flawed assumptions of adaptiveness of all traits in much of the modern evolutionary synthesis.

Lewontin accused neo-Darwinists of telling &quot;Just-So Stories&quot; when they try to show how natural selection explains such novelties as long-necked giraffes.

===Sociobiology and evolutionary psychology===
Along with others, such as Gould, Lewontin was a persistent critic of some themes in neo-Darwinism. Specifically, he criticized proponents of sociobiology and evolutionary psychology, such as Edward O. Wilson and Richard Dawkins, who attempt to explain animal behaviour and social structures in terms of evolutionary advantage or strategy. He and others criticize this approach when applied to humans, as he sees it as genetic determinism. In his writing, Lewontin suggests a more nuanced view of evolution is needed, which requires a more careful understanding of the context of the whole organism as well as the environment.

Such concerns about what he viewed as the oversimplification of genetics led Lewontin to be a frequent participant in debates, and an active life as a public intellectual. He lectured widely to promote his views on evolutionary biology and science. In the book &quot;Not in Our Genes&quot; (co-authored with Steven Rose and Leon J. Kamin) and numerous articles, Lewontin questioned much of the claimed heritability of human behavioral traits, such as intelligence as measured by IQ tests.

Some academics have criticized him for rejecting sociobiology for non-scientific reasons. Edward Wilson (1995) suggested that Lewontin&#x27;s political beliefs affected his scientific view. Others, such as Kitcher (1985), countered that Lewontin&#x27;s criticisms of sociobiology are genuine scientific concerns about the discipline. He wrote that attacking Lewontin&#x27;s motives amounts to an &quot;ad hominem&quot; argument. Lewontin at times identified himself as Marxist, and asserted that his philosophical views have bolstered his scientific work (Levins and Lewontin 1985).

===Agribusiness===
Lewontin has written on the economics of agribusiness. He has contended that hybrid corn was developed and propagated not because of its superior quality, but because it allowed agribusiness corporations to force farmers to buy new seed each year rather than plant seed produced by their previous crop of corn (Lewontin 1982). Lewontin testified in an unsuccessful suit in California challenging the state&#x27;s financing of research to develop automatic tomato pickers. This favored the profits of agribusiness over the employment of farm workers (Lewontin 2000).

==Personal life==
As of mid-2015, Lewontin and his wife Mary Jane (Christianson) lived in a log cabin he built with his family in the 1970&#x27;s in Marlboro, Vermont. Lewontin served many years as a volunteer fireman in Marlboro and also served as a trustee for the Marlboro Music Festival. Dick and Mary Jane had four sons. He was an atheist.

Lewontin died at his home in Cambridge, Massachusetts on July 4, 2021, at the age of 92.

<text>The is a series of automobiles manufactured by Honda since 1972. , the Civic is positioned between the Honda Fit/City and Honda Accord in Honda&#x27;s global passenger car line-up.

The first-generation Civic was introduced in July 1972 as a two-door fastback sedan, followed by a three-door hatchback that September. With a 1,169 cc transverse engine and front-wheel drive, the car provided good interior space despite overall small dimensions. Initially gaining a reputation for being fuel-efficient, reliable and environmentally friendly, later iterations have become known for performance and sportiness, especially the Civic Si, SiR, and Type R versions.

The Civic has been repeatedly rebadged for international markets, and served as the basis for the Honda CR-X, the Honda CR-X del Sol, the Concerto, the first generation Prelude, the Civic Shuttle (later to become the Orthia) and the CR-V (which, by extension, was used as the basis for the Honda FR-V).

The Civic is one of the all-time best-selling automobiles in the world, with over 28 million units sold since 1972 as of 2024.

== Background ==

Honda, after establishing itself as a leading manufacturer of motorcycles during the 1950s, began production of automobiles in 1963.&lt;ref name=&quot;S360/T360&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; Honda introduced its N360 minicar, compliant with Kei car specifications for the Japanese market, for the 1967 model year. The car had a transverse-mounted front-engine, front-wheel-drive (FF) layout, which would be adopted for the later Honda 1300 (1970) and Civic (1972) models. The Civic gave Honda their first market success competing with manufacturers of standard compact cars, which was a growth segment as sales of kei cars plateaued and waned in the early 1970s.

It was Honda&#x27;s first model to have an impact in the export market. It became one of the most influential automotive designs of the 1970s, with the Volkswagen Golf (1974), Ford Fiesta (1976), and Fiat Ritmo (1978) showing similarities as transverse-FF, truncated-trapezoidal hatchbacks occupying a size niche between minicars and compact sedans. The Renault 5 was introduced six months before the Honda Civic which appeared later in July. Honda would later expand the Civic&#x27;s FF-compact design to produce the larger and more upmarket Accord (1976) and Prelude (1978) models. In Japan, the Civic was the first fully modern compact car in the European style, offering a level of prestige never before seen in this class in the market. The Civic quickly inspired Japanese domestic manufacturers to respond in kind, with models like the Mazda Familia AP, Daihatsu Charade, and Mitsubishi Mirage.

Previously a subcompact, since 2000 the Civic has been categorized as a compact car. US EPA guidelines for vehicle size class stipulate a car having combined passenger and cargo room of is considered a mid-size car, and as such the tenth generation Civic sedan is technically a small-end mid-size car, although it still competes in the compact class. In Insurance Bureau of Canada&#x27;s report on top 10 most stolen vehicles in 2005, 2000 Honda Civic Si 2-door, 1999 Honda Civic Si coupe, 1994 Honda Civic Si 2-door Hatchback, 1995 Honda Civic Si 2-door Hatchback were listed as ranks #1, #2, #5, #8 respectively. The Honda Civic has also consistently been the most popular passenger vehicle in Canada.

In Japan, as customers increasingly shifted to minivans and compact cars like the Fit, production of the non-hybrid Civic ended in August 2010. However, the Civic was reintroduced into the Japanese market with the launch of the tenth-generation model in 2017.

== First generation (1972) ==

The first-generation Civic was introduced on 11 July 1972, but sold as a 1973 model in Japan. It was equipped with a four-cylinder water-cooled engine and featured front power disc brakes, reclining vinyl bucket seats, simulated wood trim on the dashboard, as well as optional air conditioning and an AM/FM radio. The Civic was available as a two- or four-door fastback sedan, three- and a five-door hatchback, as well as a five-door station wagon. Because of the 1973 oil crisis, consumer demand for fuel efficient vehicles was high, and because of the engine being able to run on either leaded or unleaded fuel, it gave drivers fuel choice flexibility over other vehicles. The Compound Vortex Controlled Combustion (CVCC) engine debuted in December 1973, with a head design that allowed for more efficient combustion, and as a benefit the CVCC system did not require a catalytic converter or unleaded fuel to meet 1975 Environmental Protection Agency emissions standards for hydrocarbons and carbon monoxide. The Civic was joined by a platform expansion of the three-door hatchback, called the Honda Accord in 1976.
== Second generation (1979) ==

The second-generation Civic was introduced in June 1979 as a 1980 model. It was larger, had a more angular shape, and came with increased engine power. All Civic engines now used the CVCC design, which added a third valve per cylinder; this introduced lean-burn swirl technology. This generation was available with a 1,335 cc (&quot;1300&quot;) engine and with an optional 1,488 cc (&quot;1500&quot;) version; power outputs varied considerably between Japan, Europe, North America, and other markets. Three transmissions were offered: a four-speed manual (on base models), a five-speed manual, and a two-speed semi-automatic Honda had previously called the &quot;Hondamatic&quot;. The second generation Civic was offered as a three-door hatchback, a four-door sedan, a five-door hatchback and a five-door wagon.
== Third generation (1983) ==

The third-generation Civic was released in September 1983 for the 1984 model year. The separate five-door hatchback and wagon models were merged into a five-door &quot;shuttle wagon&quot; or &quot;wagovan&quot; sometimes referred to colloquially as a &quot;breadbox&quot; because of its appearance, called the Honda Civic Shuttle. An additional two-seat coupe style—labeled CRX—was introduced, noted for its compact dimensions and light weight. The third generation Civic saw the introduction of the long running four-cylinder D series engine including a new CVCC engine producing 76 HP. 1984 also saw the release of a high-performance Si model for the Japanese market, featuring upgraded suspension and the double overhead camshaft (DOHC) ZC engine which was rated at 130 PS (128 HP). Si models were offered in the U.S. as a 3-door Civic Si hatchback and the CRX Si variant with a single overhead camshaft (SOHC) 12-valve engine with programmed fuel injection. A 4WD configuration with different transmission mounts was introduced for the first time in 1984, and later upgraded in 1987. It delivered a fuel economy of around 28 mpg highway. The 4WD system was push-button operated until improved in 1987 when the rear wheels would engage automatically once the front wheels lost traction. This new system was called &quot;Realtime&quot; which used a &quot;viscous coupler&quot; connecting two propeller shafts between the front and rear axles. The manual transmission featured a synchronized 6th gear, called &quot;SL&quot;, or &quot;Super-Low&quot;, which was used for high torque at very low speeds. The &quot;Realtime&quot; idea is still utilized to this day but includes technological improvements since the first system. Starting with 1985, Japanese Civics were now exclusive to &quot;Honda Primo&quot;, with variants sold at &quot;Honda Verno&quot; and &quot;Honda Clio&quot;. A four-door version called the Ballade was built, under agreement, by Mercedes-Benz South Africa, models were 1300, 1500, 1500i and 1600i DOHC 1.6 injection.
== Fourth generation (1987) ==

In September 1987, a redesigned Civic was introduced with increased dimensions and a lower hood line. A wide range of models and trim levels were offered for various markets around the world. The most notable of which was the Japanese market SiR (featuring the B16A 1.6-liter DOHC VTEC 4-cylinder engine). All U.S. models featured electronic fuel injection, but carbureted models were still available elsewhere. The fourth-generation saw the introduction of a fully independent rear suspension across the entire model range. In addition, the Honda CRX continued to be part of the Civic family which included the base model, HF and Si model in the U.S.A / four door version called the Ballade was built, under agreement, by Mercedes-Benz South Africa / models were 1500 16V, 1600i 16V and 1600i 16V DOHC. The first 800 cars produced at the then brand new Honda plant in Alliston, Ontario, Canada were SE model cars. These Special Edition models included all white side molding that matched the white body and color matched dual mirrors. In the body molding was a wrap around blue stripe. Each car had interior upgrades as well as a chrome-tipped exhaust.
== Fifth generation (1991) ==

Introduced in September 1991 for the 1992 model year, the redesigned Civic featured increased dimensions, as well as more aerodynamic styling. The wagon variant was now only available in the Japanese market where the previous generation wagon was carried over until 1995. The efficiency of the previous HF model was replaced by the VX hatchback which, with an EPA rating of , was Honda&#x27;s most fuel efficient model sold at the time. In North America, the Si featured a 1.6-liter SOHC VTEC valve train, whereas the VX featured the VTEC-E. The Japanese Si featured a 1.6-liter DOHC non-VTEC valve train D16A9. Continuing in the sporty tradition of the original Civic SiR, Honda sold several similarly equipped variants of the fifth generation car, still referred to as the Civic SiR, in Japan, Asia and Europe. In South Africa, MBSA (Mercedes Benz of SA) built the Civic as the Ballade only in 4-door sedan. A special model was the 180i with the B18B4, that was fitted to Ballade models. A new body style was introduced with this generation called the Civic Coupé, based from the Civic Ferio sedan, and was sold in North America, Europe and Japan. The fifth-generation remains popular among tuners and racers alike.
== Sixth generation (1995) ==


Introduced in September 1995 for the 1996 model year, the sixth-generation featured updated styling although less radical than previous redesigns. Suspension and engine options were available along with their first Natural Gas Powered Civic, the GX. In the United States, model year 1996 to 2000 the Civic was sold under the CX, DX, EX, EXR, HX, LX, and for Canada, SE, and Si trims; all base models were made with 1.6-liter 4-cylinder engines. The EX-CX are all SOHC (Honda D engine). The CX, DX and LX all have SOHC (D16Y7) 4-cylinder engines; whereas the EX has a 1.6L 16-valve SOHC VTEC (D16Y8) engine producing , and the HX has a D16Y5 VTEC-E engine producing . The USDM Si and Canadian SiR came with a 1.6L 16-valve DOHC VTEC (B16A2) engine producing . The first Civic Si coupe EM1 was introduced in 1999 and was produced until 2000. Europe saw a DOHC 1.6 VTi hatchback and sedan and a DOHC 1.8L engine was available for the Domani related 5-door liftback and estate. In Canada, the Acura EL is based on the Civic, and was replaced by the CSX in 2006.

== Seventh generation (2000) ==


The seventh-generation Civic was released in September 2000, for the 2001 model year. While the redesign retained the previous generation&#x27;s exterior dimensions, interior space was improved in part by using a flat rear floor thus bumping up Civic to a compact car size segment. The front suspension was changed from that of a double wishbone to a MacPherson strut, in order to lower costs, as well as allow more engine bay room for the newly introduced Honda K-series engine. Power was also increased on some trim levels. The four main trim levels were DX, LX, EX and HX. The Civic Coupe was no longer sold in Japan starting with this generation.

In North America, coupe and sedan body styles were available, except for the Si (SiR in Canada) which was offered only as a three-door hatchback. The rest of the world received three- and five-door hatchbacks. The Type R was redesigned as well this time using a more powerful i-VTEC engine and using the three-door hatchback body style. This generation saw Honda introduce their first Civic Hybrid, powered by a 1.3-liter engine.

== Eighth generation (2005) ==


The eighth-generation Civic was released in September 2005 in the North American market, for the 2006 model year. For the eighth-generation, Honda split the model into two different platforms, one for sedan and coupe, and one for a hatchback designed primarily for the European market using a simpler rear suspension from the Honda Fit and more aggressive styling.

Although the North American and the Asia-Pacific model slightly differ in front and rear styling, they are mechanically identical. The hatchback is available as a three and five-door. Both Si and Type R trim levels continued although the Japanese and European Type R, while sharing the same engine size, are mechanically different. In the United States, an improved, sportier version of the Civic Si 4-door tuned by tuner Mugen was offered, featuring cosmetic alterations and changes to the suspension, wheels, slight exterior differences, and exhaust system. A Canadian-only Acura model received a new nameplate, changing from the Acura EL to the Acura CSX.

As of 2006, a total of 16.5 million Civics had been sold worldwide, with 7.3 million of them in the United States.

== Ninth generation (2011) ==


The ninth-generation Civic consists of four body styles, which are sedan, coupe, hatchback and station wagon marketed as the Civic Tourer. The latter two makes up for the European-market Civic range built in the UK. The hatchback version forms a basis for a Civic Type R (FK2) model, which was released later in 2015.

The production version of the ninth-generation Civic sedan and coupe first went on sale in the U.S. on April 20, 2011, for the 2012 model year. The model was developed during the height of the global financial crisis, which led Honda to believe that consumers specifically in North America would be willing to forego upscale content and quality in new vehicles as long as they were fuel efficient and affordable. Following criticisms regarding quality and refinement, Honda updated the Civic with new exterior and interior improvements in late 2012 for the 2013 model year. The ninth-generation Civic was never introduced in Japan, except the 750-unit limited run Civic Type R sold in 2015.

A hybrid version was also available for the sedan model, equipped with a larger 1.5-liter i-VTEC engine that produces 90 hp and 97 lb ft of torque and a lithium-ion battery, is rated at in combined city and highway EPA test cycle, an improvement of over the previous generation hybrid.

== Tenth generation (2015) ==


Based on an all-new Honda compact global platform, the tenth-generation Civic marked the unification of the Civic range globally. Honda targeted the Civic range at the key U.S. market, resurrecting its once-discarded &quot;lead-country&quot; system which calls for developing a model specifically for its main targeted market but selling it in other regions as well. As the result, Honda ceased making a smaller, dedicated version for the European market. Instead, the Swindon plant in UK produced a five-door hatchback version of the globally-marketed Civic for international markets.

The sedan model was first unveiled in the U.S. in September 2015, for the 2016 model year. The tenth-generation Civic features a new fastback exterior design, with the rear C-pillar flowing into the tailgate. The front of the car features a new chrome wing design that flows across the top of the headlamps. Civic body styles include sedan, coupe, five-door hatchback, while performance models include Si trims and Type R models. The hatchback version saw its re-introduction in the North American market for the first time since 2000, along with the first Type R model ever sold in the region, both imported from the UK.

The interior of the new Civic likewise features major design changes. Unlike the split bi-level speedometer and tachometer of its predecessor, tenth-generation Civic consolidates these instruments into an optional &quot;Driver Information Interface&quot; incorporating a customizable 7-inch LCD screen positioned directly behind the steering wheel and in the driver&#x27;s line of sight. Several model received an instrumentation that consists of a large analog tachometer that surrounds a digital speedometer and other digital displays.

== Eleventh generation (2021) ==
The eleventh-generation Civic sedan was revealed as a prototype in November 2020. The production version was revealed in June 2021, in both sedan and liftback (marketed as the Civic Hatchback) body styles. North American sales began the same month, followed by Southeast Asia in August, Japan and China in September, and Australia and New Zealand in December. Sales in Pakistan began in March 2022, while European sales began in late 2022. The liftback body style (marketed as the &quot;Civic Hatchback&quot;) was unveiled on June 23, 2021. This generation is also the first Civic since the second-generation not to offer a coupe version due to its declining sales. The sedan is not offered in Japan, Europe or Australia following low sales of its predecessor.

== International marketing and platform derivatives ==
While the Civic is sold in largely the same form worldwide, differences in the name of the models exist between markets. In Japan, the hatchback Civic is just called &quot;Civic&quot; while the sedan model was called the Civic Ferio () during the fifth to seventh generations. The sixth-generation sedan was also sold as the Integra SJ. In Europe and the United States, &quot;Civic&quot; generically refers to any model, though in Europe the coupe is branded the &quot;Civic Coupe&quot;. A four-door station wagon model called the Civic Shuttle (also Civic Pro in Japan) was available from 1984 until 1991 (this brand name would later be revived for the mid-1990s Honda Shuttle people carrier, known in some markets as the Honda Odyssey). In South Africa, the sedan (the only model sold there until the 1996 launch of the sixth generation sedan and hatch) was known as the Ballade.
Other models have been built on the Civic platform, including Prelude, Ballade, CR-X, Quint, Concerto, Domani, CR-X Del Sol, Integra, and CR-V.

Also, at various times, the Civic or Civic-derived models have been sold by marques other than Honda – for example, Rover sold the 200, 400 and 45, each of which were Civic-based at some point (first 200s were the second generation Ballade; from 1990 the 200 and 400 were based on the Concerto; the 400 was the 1995 Domani), as was their predecessor, the Triumph Acclaim, based on the first Honda Ballade. The Honda Domani, an upscale model based on the Civic, was sold as the Isuzu Gemini in Japan (1992–2000), and confusingly the 5-door Domani was sold as the Honda Civic (along with the &quot;real&quot; hatchback and sedan Civics) in Europe from 1995 to 2000. In Thailand, the sixth generation Civic was available as the four-door Isuzu Vertex. The sixth-generation station wagon was sold as the Honda Orthia, with the Partner as the downmarket commercial variant. The seventh generation minivan model is called the Honda Stream. In Canada, the sixth and seventh generation Civics were mildly redesigned to create the Acura EL until the advent of the eight generation Civic, which was used to create the Acura CSX, which was designed in Canada. Honda Japan adopted the CSX styling for the Civic in its home country.

The three-door hatchback body style has been somewhat unpopular in the United States, but has achieved wide acceptance in Canada, as well as popularity in Japan and European markets, helping cement Honda&#x27;s reputation as a maker of sporty compact models. Starting in 2002, the Civic three-door hatchback has been built exclusively at Honda&#x27;s manufacturing plant in Swindon, England – previously the five-door Civic/Domani and the Civic Aerodeck (based on the Japanese Orthia) were built in this plant for sale in Europe along with the Japanese Civics. Accordingly, all instances of the current model (left or right hand drive, anywhere in the world) are British-made cars designed with Japanese engineering, except for the US-built two-door coupe and the sedan version built in Brazil for the Latin American market.

In North America, the Civic hatchback was dropped for 2006. The 2006 model year standard Civics for North America are manufactured in Alliston, Ontario, Canada (sedans, coupes and Si Coupes) and East Liberty, Ohio (sedans), while the Hybrid version is manufactured in Japan.

In Brazil, although being considered for local manufacturing since the early 1980s (it was illegal to import cars in Brazil from 1973 until 1990), the Civic wasn&#x27;t available until 1992, via official importing. In 1997, production of the sixth generation Civic sedan started in the Sumaré (a city near Campinas, in the state of São Paulo) factory. The only differences between the Japanese model and the Brazilian model were a slightly higher ground clearance because of the country&#x27;s road conditions and adaptations to make the engine suitable to Brazilian commercial gasoline, which contains about 25% ethanol (E25), and the absence of sunroof in the Brazilian sixth generation Civic EX. The seventh generation production started in 2001, displacing the Chevrolet Vectra from the top sales record for the mid-size sedan segment, however it lost that position to the Toyota Corolla the following year. In 2006, the eighth generation was released and regained the sales leadership. Identical to the North American version, it lacks options such as a moonroof, and standard security equipment like VSA, and side and curtain airbags which were removed because of a lack of car safety laws in the Mercosur. Furthermore, the Brazilian subsidiary began producing flex-fuel versions for the Civic and the Fit models, capable of running on any blend of gasoline ( in Brazil) and ethanol up to E100.

== Safety ==

=== United States ===
The National Highway Traffic Safety Administration (NHTSA) in the United States has determined frontal crash test ratings of Honda Civics of different model years.

The eighth-generation Civic sedan&#x27;s crash test performance has been rated highly by both the U.S. government&#x27;s NHTSA and the Insurance Institute for Highway Safety. The IIHS awarded the Civic sedan with a rating of &quot;good&quot; on both frontal and side impact crash tests and lists the Civic as the second-best 2007 small car in overall crashworthiness. The Civic coupe is rated &quot;acceptable&quot; in the side impact test.

== Modifications and enthusiast community ==
Despite being a modest car, the Civic is popular as a platform for modification and customization by the enthusiast community. Readily available parts and interchangeability allows for easy engine swaps and many other upgrades.

== Awards ==
Honda Civic EX was International Car of the Year in 2005. From 1972 to 1974, the Civic was awarded Car of the Year Japan. In 1973, the Civic ranked third in the European Car of the Year awards, the highest ranking for a Japanese vehicle at that time. It also was awarded the U.S. &quot;Road Test&quot; magazine&#x27;s &quot;1974 Car of the Year.&quot; The Civic was the &quot;Motor Trend&quot; Import Car of the Year for 1980
as well as its 2006 Car of the Year. In 2006, the Civic earned the 2007 &quot;Semperit Irish Car of the Year&quot; title. In 1996, Automobile Magazine honored the Civic as its Automobile of the Year. The Civic has been on &quot;Car and Driver&quot; magazine&#x27;s yearly Ten Best list six times, in 1985, 1988–91, and 1996. The Civic Si was named &quot;Best New Sport Car&quot; and the sedan was named &quot;Best New Economy Car&quot; in the 2006 Canadian Car of the Year awards. The Civic also won the &quot;North American Car of the Year&quot; and the North American International Auto Show (NAIAS) Car of the Year awards for 2006. In November 2006, the Civic received the prestigious &quot;Car of The Year&quot; award from Brazilian magazine Auto Esporte.
The four-door Civic VXi sedan won the South African Car of the Year award for 2007. Kelley Blue Book named the 2020 Honda Civic the Compact Car Best Buy for the sixth year in a row. In 2022, Honda Civic was chosen as the Scottish Car of the Year.

== Racing ==
=== Touring car racing ===
Civics have been used for racing ever since their introduction.

Civics contested the Up to 1300cc class in the Bathurst 1000 touring car race at Bathurst in Australia each year from 1973 to 1976, with a best placing of second in class in both 1974 and 1976.

In recent years the Civic has been used in a wide variety of racing series, particularly in Japan. It is also used in touring car races in Europe and the United States. The Civic has been used in the UK in endurance series by teams such as Barwell Motorsport and Cartek Motorsport.

In 2002, JAS Motorsport entered the European Touring Car Championship (ETCC) with a Super 2000 spec Civic and was used until restart season of the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) in 2005.

In December 2005, on the date of the new 2006 Civic Si&#x27;s launch in the United States, Honda&#x27;s R&amp;D Engineering Team completed 645 laps in an eighth generation Civic Si coupe (FG2) to place first in the E1 class of the famous &#x27;25 Hours of Thunderhill&#x27; marathon race. The drivers on Honda&#x27;s team were Road &amp; Track journalist Kim Wolfkill, Lee Niffenegger, Chad Gilsinger, Sage Marie, John Sherk, Rich Hays, Andrew Frame, Matt Staal and &quot;Car and Driver&quot; journalist Tony Swan.

==== BTCC ====
In the UK, the Civic has been used in the British Touring Car Championship (BTCC) for several years and is still highly competitive. The Civic Type R made its debut in the 2002 season with the &#x27;Works&#x27; team run by Arena Motorsport. Built to BTC-T specifications, it gained the team third in the manufacturers championship. In the same year Synchro Motorsport won the BTCC Production Teams Championship with a pair of Civic Type Rs.

The 2003 season saw the &#x27;works&#x27; team Civics secure an impressive second in the manufacturers championship. The 2003 BTCC Production Teams Championship also went to the Civic again, this time in the hands of Barwell Motorsport.

Such was the competitiveness of the Civic in its first two-season, 2004 saw five teams enter Civics, allowing the model to secure second in the manufacturers championship.

Although manufacturer support from Honda for the BTCC ended in 2005, several teams still found success running the Civic in 2005 and 2006.
For the 2007 BTCC season, Team Halfords ran the new eighth-generation Honda Civics, built to the latest S2000 regulations, for Matt Neal and Gordon Shedden with limited success and continued to use the Civic into the 2008 and 2009 season. In both 2007 and 2008, the Civic allowed the team to finish 3rd in the Teams championship, behind the two manufacturer backed teams.

In 2010, Honda returned to the BTCC as a &#x27;works&#x27; team with Team Dynamics using Civics to win the 2010 manufacturers championship.

In 2011, the team returns with its Civic to defend its Team and Manufacturers championship again with the Neal and Shedden pairing.

Honda Racing Team swapped to the brand new ninth generation Honda Civic, built fully to NGTC rules, for the 2012 BTCC season. They are the first manufacturer backed team to announce their intention to run fully to the NGTC specification. The drivers continue to be Matt Neal and Gordon Shedden, who are the 2011 and 2012 BTCC driver champions respectively. Andrew Jordan, driving for his family-run Eurotech Racing team, won the BTCC title in 2013 in their NGTC Civic, whilst Honda retained the manufacturer&#x27;s championship. However, in 2014, Honda were unable to retain their title, which was won instead by MG.

==== WTCC ====

In 2012, Honda announced plans to enter the World Touring Car Championship (WTCC) with a racer built on the ninth-generation Euro Civic five-door hatchback. The car was powered by a 1.6-liter turbocharged HR412E engine, developed by Honda R&amp;D, with the chassis developed by JAS Motorsport. The car raced in the last three rounds of the 2012 season in Japan, China and Macau before its first full season in 2013. In their first full season in the series, Honda won the 2013 Manufacturers&#x27; World Championship six races before the end of the season, claiming four wins and 20 podium finishes during the year.

After the introduction of the new TC1 regulations in 2014, the Civics took numerous race victories and podiums, but were not championship contenders again until 2017. The 2017 season saw the Civic achieve the most pole positions and main race victories, but the team missed out on title success partly because their championship-leading driver Tiago Monteiro was forced to miss the final rounds due to a testing crash caused by a brake failure, while other incidents also hampered their results that season.

==== Others ====
The car has also been used in the Japanese Touring Car Championship and won the 2011 Asian Touring Car Series. It also competed in both the Touring and Super-production classes of the Russian Touring Car Championship.
== Sales ==
As of February 2015, 18.5 million Civics had been sold worldwide. With 7.3 million bought in the United States, it has been one of the top sellers in the country and in the neighboring Canada, where it had placed number one for 14 years through 2012. In 2019, the Civic was the second-best-selling car in the United States after the Toyota Camry.

<text>A maggot is the larva of a fly (order Diptera); it is applied in particular to the larvae of Brachycera flies, such as houseflies, cheese flies, and blowflies, rather than larvae of the Nematocera, such as mosquitoes and crane flies.

==Etymology==
&quot;Maggot&quot; is not a technical term and should not be taken as such; in many standard textbooks of entomology, it does not appear in the index at all. In many non-technical texts, the term is used for insect larvae in general. Other sources have coined their own definitions; for example: &quot;The term applies to a grub when all trace of limbs has disappeared&quot; and &quot;Applied to the footless larvae of Diptera&quot;. Additionally, in &quot;Flies: The Natural History and Diversity of Diptera&quot;, the author claims maggots &quot;are larvae of higher Brachycera (Cyclorrhapha).&quot;

Maggot-like fly larvae are of significance in ecology and medicine; among other roles, various species are prominent in recycling carrion and garbage, attacking crops and foodstuffs, spreading microbial infections, and causing myiasis. Maggots are also particularly important in forensic entomology because their development can help determine the time of death, particularly maggots in the Calliphoridae family.

==Uses==

===Fishing===
Anglers use maggots usually commercially supplied to catch non-predatory fish.
Maggots are the most popular bait for anglers in Europe. Anglers throw handfuls into the &quot;swim&quot; they are targeting, attracting the fish to the area. The anglers then use the largest or most attractive maggots on the hook, hoping to be irresistible to the fish. Commercial maggot breeders from the UK sell their maggots to tackle dealers throughout the E.U. and North America.

Artificial maggots for fishing, either in natural or fluorescent colors, have been developed and are used for trout, panfish, or salmon species.

===Medical treatment===
Live maggots of certain species of flies have been used since antiquity for wound debridement. Larvae of calliphorid flies of the species &quot;Lucilia sericata&quot; are widely used. Not all species are safe and effective; use of the wrong species would invite pathological myiasis.

In controlled and sterile settings overseen by medical practitioners, maggot therapy introduces live, disinfected maggots into non-healing skin or soft wounds of a human or animal. They feed on the dead or necrotic tissue, leaving sound tissue largely unharmed. Studies have also shown that maggots kill bacteria. Three midgut lysozymes of &quot;L. sericata&quot; have antibacterial effects in maggot debridement therapy. The study demonstrated that the majority of gram-positive bacteria were destroyed in vivo within the particular section of the &quot;L. sericata&quot; midgut where lysozymes are produced. During the passage through the intestine of the maggots, the ability of bacteria to survive drastically decreased, implying the antibacterial action of the three midgut lysozymes. In 2005 maggot therapy was being used in about 1,300 medical centers.

Acceptance by healthcare workers has inhibited acceptance, but a supplier of maggots said in 2022 that she had noticed significantly more acceptance over the four years she had worked in the field. Acceptance among patients is high.

===Forensic science===
The presence and development of maggots on a corpse are useful in the estimation of time elapsed since death. Depending on the species and the conditions, maggots may be observed on a body within 24 hours. The eggs are laid directly on the food source, and when the eggs hatch, the maggots move towards their preferred conditions and begin to feed. By studying the insects present at a crime scene, forensic entomologists can determine the approximate time of death. Insects are usually useful after a post-mortem interval (PMI) of approximately 25–80 hours, depending on ambient conditions. After this interval, this method becomes less reliable. Blow flies are often used in forensic entomology to determine PMI because of their oviposition on carrion and corpses. The black blowfly, &quot;Phormia regina (P. regina),&quot; is extremely widespread across the US and often the earliest species to oviposit on a corpse, making it especially important to forensic science.

Maggots are useful as well in entomotoxicology, in determining the presence of drugs in a corpse&#x27;s system. Maggots bioaccumulate xenobiotics (substances, drugs, metals, etc.) from tissue and bone, therefore allowing entomologists to determine if xenobiotics, most commonly drugs, were present in the body before death. This is useful in concluding a cause of death in many different cases including overdoses and poisonings. It also helps in determining manner of death including suicide or homicides. Maggots are able to bioaccumulate substances from fresh corpses, as well as fully decomposed skeletonized bodies. Data and resources on entomotoxicology are sparse as it is a relatively new field of study. The knowledge of how the drug or substance effects the development of maggots is necessary as some drugs such as cocaine and methamphetamine are proven to accelerate the development of larvae, whereas opiates are shown to decelerate said rate.

==Behaviours==

As with fleas and ticks, maggots can be a threat to household pets and livestock, especially sheep. Flies reproduce rapidly in the summer months, and maggots can come in large numbers, creating a maggot infestation and a high risk of myiasis (a maggot infestation of living tissue) in sheep and other animals. Humans are not immune to the feeding habits of maggots and can also contract myiasis. Interaction between humans and maggots usually occurs near garbage cans, dead animals, rotten food and other suitable egg-laying substrates for flies with detritivorous larvae.

Many of the families of flies with &quot;maggot&quot; larvae can reach very high population densities through grow exponentially, but in natural conditions without human interference, predators, parasites, and food availability keep the population under control. Sealing garbage and using a garbage disposal or freezing rotting leftovers until waste collection day helps prevent infestation. Introducing an environmental control, such as Hister beetles, can also help reduce maggot populations.

<text>In graph theory, an interval graph is an undirected graph formed from a set of intervals on the real line,
with a vertex for each interval and an edge between vertices whose intervals intersect. It is the intersection graph of the intervals.

Interval graphs are chordal graphs and perfect graphs. They can be recognized in linear time, and an optimal graph coloring or maximum clique in these graphs can be found in linear time. The interval graphs include all proper interval graphs, graphs defined in the same way from a set of unit intervals.

These graphs have been used to model food webs, and to study scheduling problems in which one must select a subset of tasks to be performed at non-overlapping times. Other applications include assembling contiguous subsequences in DNA mapping, and temporal reasoning.

==Definition==
An interval graph is an undirected graph formed from a family of intervals
:formula_1
by creating one vertex for each interval , and connecting two vertices and by an edge whenever the corresponding two sets have a nonempty intersection. That is, the edge set of is
:formula_2
It is the intersection graph of the intervals.

== Characterizations ==

Three independent vertices form an &quot;asteroidal triple (AT)&quot; in a graph if, for each two, there exists a path containing those two but no neighbor of the third. A graph is AT-free if it has no asteroidal triple. The earliest characterization of interval graphs seems to be the following:

* A graph is an interval graph if and only if it is chordal and AT-free.

Other characterizations:

* A graph is an interval graph if and only if its maximal cliques can be ordered formula_3 such that each vertex that belongs to two of these cliques also belongs to all cliques between them in the ordering. That is, for every formula_4 with formula_5, it is also the case that formula_6 whenever formula_7.
* A graph is an interval graph if and only if it does not contain the cycle graph formula_8 as an induced subgraph and is the complement of a comparability graph.

Various other characterizations of interval graphs and variants have been described.

== Efficient recognition algorithm ==

Determining whether a given graph formula_9 is an interval graph can be done in formula_10 time by seeking an ordering of the maximal cliques of formula_11 that is consecutive with respect to vertex inclusion. Many of the known algorithms for this problem work in this way, although it is also possible to recognize interval graphs in linear time without using their cliques.

The original linear time recognition algorithm of is based on their complex PQ tree data structure, but showed how to solve the problem more simply using lexicographic breadth-first search, based on the fact that a graph is an interval graph if and only if it is chordal and its complement is a comparability graph.
A similar approach using a 6-sweep LexBFS algorithm is described in .

==Related families of graphs==

By the characterization of interval graphs as AT-free chordal graphs, interval graphs are strongly chordal graphs and hence perfect graphs. Their complements belong to the class of comparability graphs, and the comparability relations are precisely the interval orders.

From the fact that a graph is an interval graph if and only if it is chordal and its complement is a comparability graph, it follows that graph and its complement are both interval graphs if and only if the graph is both a split graph and a permutation graph.

The interval graphs that have an interval representation in which every two intervals are either disjoint or nested are the trivially perfect graphs.

A graph has boxicity at most one if and only if it is an interval graph; the boxicity of an arbitrary graph formula_11 is the minimum number of interval graphs on the same set of vertices such that the intersection of the edges sets of the interval graphs is formula_11.

The intersection graphs of arcs of a circle form circular-arc graphs, a class of graphs that contains the interval graphs. The trapezoid graphs, intersections of trapezoids whose parallel sides all lie on the same two parallel lines, are also a generalization of the interval graphs.

The connected triangle-free interval graphs are exactly the caterpillar trees.

=== Proper interval graphs ===

Proper interval graphs are interval graphs that have an interval representation in which no interval properly contains any other interval; unit interval graphs are the interval graphs that have an interval representation in which each interval has unit length. A unit interval representation without repeated intervals is necessarily a proper interval representation. Not every proper interval representation is a unit interval representation, but every proper interval graph is a unit interval graph, and vice versa. Every proper interval graph is a claw-free graph; conversely, the proper interval graphs are exactly the claw-free interval graphs. However, there exist claw-free graphs that are not interval graphs.

An interval graph is called formula_14-proper if there is a representation in which no interval is contained by more than formula_14 others. This notion extends the idea of proper interval graphs such that a 0-proper interval graph is a proper interval graph.
An interval graph is called formula_16-improper if there is a representation in which no interval contains more than formula_16 others. This notion extends the idea of proper interval graphs such that a 0-improper interval graph is a proper interval graph.
An interval graph is formula_18-nested if there is no chain of length formula_19 of intervals nested in each other. This is a generalization of proper interval graphs as 1-nested interval graphs are exactly proper interval graphs.

==Applications==
The mathematical theory of interval graphs was developed with a view towards applications by researchers at the RAND Corporation&#x27;s mathematics department, which included young researchers—such as Peter C. Fishburn and students like Alan C. Tucker and Joel E. Cohen—besides leaders—such as Delbert Fulkerson and (recurring visitor) Victor Klee. Cohen applied interval graphs to mathematical models of population biology, specifically food webs.

Interval graphs are used to represent resource allocation problems in operations research and scheduling theory. In these applications, each interval represents a request for a resource (such as a processing unit of a distributed computing system or a room for a class) for a specific period of time. The maximum weight independent set problem for the graph represents the problem of finding the best subset of requests that can be satisfied without conflicts. See interval scheduling for more information.

An optimal graph coloring of the interval graph represents an assignment of resources that covers all of the requests with as few resources as possible; it can be found in polynomial time by a greedy coloring algorithm that colors the intervals in sorted order by their left endpoints.

Other applications include genetics, bioinformatics, and computer science. Finding a set of intervals that represent an interval graph can also be used as a way of assembling contiguous subsequences in DNA mapping. Interval graphs also play an important role in temporal reasoning.

==Interval completions and pathwidth==
If formula_11 is an arbitrary graph, an interval completion of formula_11 is an interval graph on the same vertex set that contains formula_11 as a subgraph. The parameterized version of interval completion (find an interval supergraph with additional edges) is fixed parameter tractable, and moreover, is solvable in parameterized subexponential time.

The pathwidth of an interval graph is one less than the size of its maximum clique (or equivalently, one less than its chromatic number), and the pathwidth of any graph formula_11 is the same as the smallest pathwidth of an interval graph that contains formula_11 as a subgraph.

==Combinatorial enumeration==
The number of connected interval graphs on formula_25 unlabeled vertices, for formula_26, is:
:1, 1, 2, 5, 15, 56, 250, 1328, 8069, 54962, 410330, 3317302, ... 
Without the assumption of connectivity, the numbers are larger. The number of interval graphs on formula_25 unlabeled vertices, not necessarily connected, is:
:1, 2, 4, 10, 27, 92, 369, 1807, 10344, 67659, 491347, 3894446, ... 

These numbers exhibit faster than exponential growth: the number of interval graphs on formula_28 unlabeled vertices is at least formula_29. Because of this fast growth rate, the interval graphs do not have bounded twin-width.

<text>Photochemistry is the branch of chemistry concerned with the chemical effects of light. Generally, this term is used to describe a chemical reaction caused by absorption of ultraviolet (wavelength from 100 to 400 nm), visible (400–750 nm), or infrared radiation (750–2500 nm).

In nature, photochemistry is of immense importance as it is the basis of photosynthesis, vision, and the formation of vitamin D with sunlight. It is also responsible for the appearance of DNA mutations leading to skin cancers.

Photochemical reactions proceed differently than temperature-driven reactions. Photochemical paths access high-energy intermediates that cannot be generated thermally, thereby overcoming large activation barriers in a short period of time, and allowing reactions otherwise inaccessible by thermal processes. Photochemistry can also be destructive, as illustrated by the photodegradation of plastics.

==Concept==

===Grotthuss–Draper law and Stark–Einstein law===
Photoexcitation is the first step in a photochemical process where the reactant is elevated to a state of higher energy, an excited state. The first law of photochemistry, known as the Grotthuss–Draper law (for chemists Theodor Grotthuss and John W. Draper), states that light must be absorbed by a chemical substance in order for a photochemical reaction to take place. According to the second law of photochemistry, known as the Stark–Einstein law (for physicists Johannes Stark and Albert Einstein), for each photon of light absorbed by a chemical system, no more than one molecule is activated for a photochemical reaction, as defined by the quantum yield.

===Fluorescence and phosphorescence===
When a molecule or atom in the ground state (S0) absorbs light, one electron is excited to a higher orbital level. This electron maintains its spin according to the spin selection rule; other transitions would violate the law of conservation of angular momentum. The excitation to a higher singlet state can be from HOMO to LUMO or to a higher orbital, so that singlet excitation states S1, S2, S3... at different energies are possible.

Kasha&#x27;s rule stipulates that higher singlet states would quickly relax by radiationless decay or internal conversion (IC) to S1. Thus, S1 is usually, but not always, the only relevant singlet excited state. This excited state S1 can further relax to S0 by IC, but also by an allowed radiative transition from S1 to S0 that emits a photon; this process is called fluorescence.

Alternatively, it is possible for the excited state S1 to undergo spin inversion and to generate a triplet excited state T1 having two unpaired electrons with the same spin. This violation of the spin selection rule is possible by intersystem crossing (ISC) of the vibrational and electronic levels of S1 and T1. According to Hund&#x27;s rule of maximum multiplicity, this T1 state would be somewhat more stable than S1.

This triplet state can relax to the ground state S0 by radiationless ISC or by a radiation pathway called phosphorescence. This process implies a change of electronic spin, which is forbidden by spin selection rules, making phosphorescence (from T1 to S0) much slower than fluorescence (from S1 to S0). Thus, triplet states generally have longer lifetimes than singlet states. These transitions are usually summarized in a state energy diagram or Jablonski diagram, the paradigm of molecular photochemistry.

These excited species, either S1 or T1, have a half-empty low-energy orbital, and are consequently more oxidizing than the ground state. But at the same time, they have an electron in a high-energy orbital, and are thus more reducing. In general, excited species are prone to participate in electron transfer processes.

===Experimental setup===

Photochemical reactions require a light source that emits wavelengths corresponding to an electronic transition in the reactant. In the early experiments (and in everyday life), sunlight was the light source, although it is polychromatic. Mercury-vapor lamps are more common in the laboratory. Low-pressure mercury-vapor lamps mainly emit at 254 nm. For polychromatic sources, wavelength ranges can be selected using filters. Alternatively, laser beams are usually monochromatic (although two or more wavelengths can be obtained using nonlinear optics), and LEDs have a relatively narrow band that can be efficiently used, as well as Rayonet lamps, to get approximately monochromatic beams.
The emitted light must reach the targeted functional group without being blocked by the reactor, medium, or other functional groups present. For many applications, quartz is used for the reactors as well as to contain the lamp. Pyrex absorbs at wavelengths shorter than 275 nm. The solvent is an important experimental parameter. Solvents are potential reactants, and for this reason, chlorinated solvents are avoided because the C–Cl bond can lead to chlorination of the substrate. Strongly-absorbing solvents prevent photons from reaching the substrate. Hydrocarbon solvents absorb only at short wavelengths and are thus preferred for photochemical experiments requiring high-energy photons. Solvents containing unsaturation absorb at longer wavelengths and can usefully filter out short wavelengths. For example, cyclohexane and acetone &quot;cut off&quot; (absorb strongly) at wavelengths shorter than 215 and 330 nm, respectively.

Typically, the wavelength employed to induce a photochemical process is selected based on the absorption spectrum of the reactive species, most often the absorption maximum. Over the last years, however, it has been demonstrated that, in the majority of bond-forming reactions, the absorption spectrum does not allow selecting the optimum wavelength to achieve the highest reaction yield based on absorptivity. This fundamental mismatch between absorptivity and reactivity has been elucidated with so-called photochemical action plots.

===Photochemistry in combination with flow chemistry===
Continuous-flow photochemistry offers multiple advantages over batch photochemistry. Photochemical reactions are driven by the number of photons that are able to activate molecules causing the desired reaction. The large surface-area-to-volume ratio of a microreactor maximizes the illumination, and at the same time allows for efficient cooling, which decreases the thermal side products.

===Principles===

In the case of photochemical reactions, light provides the activation energy. Simplistically, light is one mechanism for providing the activation energy required for many reactions. If laser light is employed, it is possible to selectively excite a molecule so as to produce a desired electronic and vibrational state. Equally, the emission from a particular state may be selectively monitored, providing a measure of the population of that state. If the chemical system is at low pressure, this enables scientists to observe the energy distribution of the products of a chemical reaction before the differences in energy have been smeared out and averaged by repeated collisions.

The absorption of a photon by a reactant molecule may also permit a reaction to occur not just by bringing the molecule to the necessary activation energy, but also by changing the symmetry of the molecule&#x27;s electronic configuration, enabling an otherwise-inaccessible reaction path, as described by the Woodward–Hoffmann selection rules. A [2+2] cycloaddition reaction is one example of a pericyclic reaction that can be analyzed using these rules or by the related frontier molecular orbital theory.

Some photochemical reactions are several orders of magnitude faster than thermal reactions; reactions as fast as 10−9 seconds and associated processes as fast as 10−15 seconds are often observed.

The photon can be absorbed directly by the reactant or by a photosensitizer, which absorbs the photon and transfers the energy to the reactant. The opposite process, when a photoexcited state is deactivated by a chemical reagent, is called quenching.

Most photochemical transformations occur through a series of simple steps known as primary photochemical processes. One common example of these processes is the excited state proton transfer.

==Photochemical reactions==

===Examples of photochemical reactions===
*Photosynthesis: Plants use solar energy to convert carbon dioxide and water into glucose and oxygen.
*Human formation of vitamin D by exposure to sunlight.
*Bioluminescence: &quot;e.g.&quot; In fireflies, an enzyme in the abdomen catalyzes a reaction that produces light.
*Polymerizations started by photoinitiators, which decompose upon absorbing light to produce the free radicals for radical polymerization.
*Photodegradation of many substances, e.g. polyvinyl chloride and Fp. Medicine bottles are often made from darkened glass to protect the drugs from photodegradation.
*Photochemical rearrangements, &quot;e.g.&quot; photoisomerization, hydrogen atom transfer, and photochemical electrocyclic reactions. 
*Photodynamic therapy: Light is used to destroy tumors by the action of singlet oxygen generated by photosensitized reactions of triplet oxygen. Typical photosensitizers include tetraphenylporphyrin and methylene blue. The resulting singlet oxygen is an aggressive oxidant, capable of converting C–H bonds into C–OH groups. 
*Diazo printing process
*Photoresist technology, used in the production of microelectronic components. 
*Vision is initiated by a photochemical reaction of rhodopsin.
*Toray photochemical production of ε-caprolactame.
*Photochemical production of artemisinin, an anti-malaria drug.
*Photoalkylation, used for the light-induced addition of alkyl groups to molecules.
*DNA: photodimerization leading to cyclobutane pyrimidine dimers.

===Organic photochemistry===

Examples of photochemical organic reactions are electrocyclic reactions, radical reactions, photoisomerization, and Norrish reactions.
Alkenes undergo many important reactions that proceed via a photon-induced π to π* transition. The first electronic excited state of an alkene lacks the π-bond, so that rotation about the C–C bond is rapid and the molecule engages in reactions not observed thermally. These reactions include cis-trans isomerization and cycloaddition to other (ground state) alkene to give cyclobutane derivatives. The cis-trans isomerization of a (poly)alkene is involved in retinal, a component of the machinery of vision. The dimerization of alkenes is relevant to the photodamage of DNA, where thymine dimers are observed upon illuminating DNA with UV radiation. Such dimers interfere with transcription. The beneficial effects of sunlight are associated with the photochemically-induced retro-cyclization (decyclization) reaction of ergosterol to give vitamin D. In the DeMayo reaction, an alkene reacts with a 1,3-diketone reacts via its enol to yield a 1,5-diketone. Still another common photochemical reaction is Howard Zimmerman&#x27;s di-π-methane rearrangement.

In an industrial application, about 100,000 tonnes of benzyl chloride are prepared annually by the gas-phase photochemical reaction of toluene with chlorine. The light is absorbed by chlorine molecules, the low energy of this transition being indicated by the yellowish color of the gas. The photon induces homolysis of the Cl-Cl bond, and the resulting chlorine radical converts toluene to the benzyl radical:
:Cl2 + hν → 2 Cl·
:C6H5CH3 + Cl· → C6H5CH2· + HCl
:C6H5CH2· + Cl· → C6H5CH2Cl

Mercaptans can be produced by photochemical addition of hydrogen sulfide (H2S) to alpha olefins.

===Inorganic and organometallic photochemistry===
Coordination complexes and organometallic compounds are also photoreactive. These reactions can entail cis-trans isomerization. More commonly, photoreactions result in dissociation of ligands, since the photon excites an electron on the metal to an orbital that is antibonding with respect to the ligands. Thus, metal carbonyls that resist thermal substitution undergo decarbonylation upon irradiation with UV light. UV-irradiation of a THF solution of molybdenum hexacarbonyl gives the THF complex, which is synthetically useful:
:Mo(CO)6 + THF → Mo(CO)5(THF) + CO
In a related reaction, photolysis of iron pentacarbonyl affords diiron nonacarbonyl (see figure):
:2 Fe(CO)5 → Fe2(CO)9 + CO
Select photoreactive coordination complexes can undergo oxidation-reduction processes via single electron transfer. This electron transfer can occur within the inner or outer coordination sphere of the metal.

=== Types of photochemical reactions ===
Here are some different types of photochemical reactions-

* Photo-dissociation: AB + h&quot;ν&quot; → A* + B*
* Photo induced rearrangements, isomerization: A + h&quot;ν&quot; → B
* Photo-addition: A + B + h&quot;ν&quot; → AB + C
* Photo-substitution: A + BC + h&quot;ν&quot; → AB + C
* Photo-redox reaction: A + B + h&quot;ν&quot; → A− + B+

===Historical===
Although bleaching has long been practiced, the first photochemical reaction was described by Trommsdorff in 1834. He observed that crystals of the compound α-santonin when exposed to sunlight turned yellow and burst. In a 2007 study the reaction was described as a succession of three steps taking place within a single crystal.
The first step is a rearrangement reaction to a cyclopentadienone intermediate (2), the second one a dimerization in a Diels–Alder reaction (3), and the third one an intramolecular [2+2]cycloaddition (4). The bursting effect is attributed to a large change in crystal volume on dimerization.

<text>The Battle of Falkirk (; ), on 22 July 1298, was one of the major battles in the First War of Scottish Independence. Led by King Edward I of England, the English army defeated the Scots, led by William Wallace. Shortly after the battle Wallace resigned as Guardian of Scotland.

==Background==
After the Battle of Stirling Bridge, from November 1297 until January 1298 Wallace led a Scottish army south. From Newcastle upon Tyne to Carlisle, the Scots raided the countryside, bringing back the spoils.

King Edward learned of the defeat of his northern army at the Battle of Stirling Bridge. After concluding a truce with the French king, Philip the Fair, in October 1297, he returned to England on 14 March 1298 to continue the ongoing organising of an army for his second invasion of Scotland which had been in preparation since late 1297. As a preliminary step, he moved the centre of government to York, where it was to remain for the next six years. A council-of-war was held in the city in April to finalise the details of the invasion. The Scottish magnates were all summoned to attend; when none appeared, they were all declared to be traitors. Edward then ordered his army to assemble at Roxburgh on 25 June. The force counted 2,000 armoured cavalry and about 12,000 infantry receiving wages, though, after the manner of medieval armies there would have been many more serving without pay either as a statement of personal independence, forgiveness of debts to the crown, criminal pardons or just for adventure. Stuart Reid estimates Edward&#x27;s force at 214 knights with 900 troopers, 1000 cavalry supplied by the Earls, 500 mercenary crossbowmen, 2000 archers with billmen from the Lancashire and Cheshire feudal levies, though the infantry may only have totalled 8,000.

Edward left Roxburgh on 3 July and reached Kirkliston in two weeks, where he awaited supplies expected to arrive along the coastal ports, delayed due to weather. In the interim, he dealt with a Welsh mutiny. Finally, on 20 July, he advanced, reaching Linlithgow on 21 July. Edward was on the point of falling back on Edinburgh, when he received intelligence the Scots were at Torwood, near Falkirk, ready to harass his retreat. Edward reportedly said that he &quot;would not trouble them to seek me&quot;, and placed his army south of Falkirk on the morning of 22 July. Edward wanted to make camp and feed his men while waiting for his infantry to catch up with his cavalry. His cavalry commanders though, favoured an immediate attack.

Reid calculates the Scots could have manned four schiltrons with about 1000 men each, in addition to the cavalry and archers. These men would have come from the sheriffdoms of Fife, Kinross, Midlothian, Haddington, Stirling, Linlithgow, Lanark, Merse and Teviotdale. With that, Wallace supposedly said, &quot;I have browghte yowe to the ryng. Hoppe yef ye canne!&quot; Absent were forces under the Comyns and Robert Bruce. Also absent was Andrew Moray, co-victor with Wallace at the Battle of Stirling Bridge, having been mortally wounded in that battle. It was Moray who used the schiltrons offensively.

==Battle==


The Scots army, again made up chiefly of spearmen as at Stirling Bridge, was arranged in four great &quot;hedgehogs&quot; known as schiltrons. The long spears (pikes) pointing outwards at various heights gave these formations a formidable and impenetrable appearance. The gaps between the schiltrons were filled with archers, with 500 mounted knights at the rear.

On Tuesday 22 July, the English cavalry, divided into four battles, advanced in echelon. The vanguard, led by the Earl of Lincoln, moved to the left to avoid a marshy area, followed by the battle of John de Warenne, 6th Earl of Surrey. The battle of Anthony Bek, Bishop of Durham, followed by the King&#x27;s battle, moved around the marshy area to the right, toward the Scottish left flank. Lincoln&#x27;s and Bek&#x27;s battles charged the Scots and Lincoln quickly routed the Scottish cavalry.

The Scots bowmen commanded by Sir John Stewart, the younger brother of the High Steward of Scotland, stood their ground but were overrun by the English cavalry. However, the schiltrons held firm, with the knights making little impression on the dense forest of long spears, and 111 horses were killed in the vain attempts. Edward&#x27;s cavalry fell back as his infantry and archers arrived.
Edward&#x27;s archers, crossbowmen and slingers began raining projectiles on the inexperienced and poorly-armoured Scottish spearmen. The schiltrons were an easy target: they had no defence and nowhere to hide. Pinned in place by the English cavalry and infantry, unable to retreat or attack, the battle was lost for the Scots almost as soon as the first arrows began to fall. The English waited, this time observing the King&#x27;s command, until the Scottish ranks were thinned out and disordered enough to allow them to break up the schiltrons. The English cavalry and infantry then attacked the wavering Scottish spearmen, and the schiltrons broke and scattered.

== Aftermath ==
Edward occupied Stirling and raided Perth, St. Andrews and Ayrshire. Yet, he retreated to Carlisle by 9 September. Edward invaded again in the summer of 1300.

Casualties among the Scottish leaders were not particularly heavy, but did include Wallace&#x27;s second-in-command, Sir John de Graham, as well as Sir John Stewart, and Macduff of Fife.

In the words of Reid, &quot;while unquestionably a good partisan leader, William Wallace&#x27;s military abilities were simply not up to the job of organizing, training and leading a conventional military force.&quot; At Falkirk, Wallace &quot;simply drew up his army in an open field and froze.&quot;

In the words of Evan Macleod Barron, it was Moray who &quot;possessed military genius and military training&quot;, while Wallace possessed qualities that &quot;make a great guerilla leader.&quot; Barron goes on to say, &quot;Falkirk should never have been fought at all ... it hardly looks as if the brain which conceived the plan of battle at Falkirk was the same as that which conceived the plan at Stirling Bridge.&quot; Though Wallace resigned his leadership and guardianship, he still &quot;represented the mass of the people.&quot; Hence Edward&#x27;s determination to &quot;capture at all costs the man who was in himself the embodiment of that popular hostility, and who was in addition, a warrior of skill and daring and a leader who had won the heart and the imagination of the people.&quot;

== Falkirk Roll of Arms ==
The Falkirk Roll is a collection of the arms of the English bannerets and noblemen present at the battle of Falkirk. It is the oldest known English occasional roll of arms, and contains 111 names and blazoned shields.

Following are a collection of modern illustrations of the Falkirk Roll based on the blazons published in Henry Gough&#x27;s book, &quot;Scotland in 1298. Documents Relating to the Campaign of King Edward the First.&quot;
==Possible battle sites==

The site of the battle is uncertain. There have been three proposed sites: at Campfield, around the modern Central Retail Park; south of Callendar Woods (as depicted in the diagrams above), and; at Mumrills, the site of the Antonine Fort.

Walter of Guisborough stated that the Scots were positioned &quot;on hard ground ... on one side of a hillock&quot;. The &quot;Scalacronica&quot; reported that the site was &quot;on this side of Falkirk.&quot; Stuart Reid has suggested the burgh muir of Falkirk (i.e. &quot;the plain which is called Falkirk&quot;), while also acknowledging a consensus among historians, that located the Scots&#x27; position below Callendar Wood, with Glen Burn in front.

<text>In mathematics, a principal homogeneous space, or torsor, for a group &quot;G&quot; is a homogeneous space &quot;X&quot; for &quot;G&quot; in which the stabilizer subgroup of every point is trivial. Equivalently, a principal homogeneous space for a group &quot;G&quot; is a non-empty set &quot;X&quot; on which &quot;G&quot; acts freely and transitively (meaning that, for any &quot;x&quot;, &quot;y&quot; in &quot;X&quot;, there exists a unique &quot;g&quot; in &quot;G&quot; such that , where · denotes the (right) action of &quot;G&quot; on &quot;X&quot;).
An analogous definition holds in other categories, where, for example,
*&quot;G&quot; is a topological group, &quot;X&quot; is a topological space and the action is continuous,
*&quot;G&quot; is a Lie group, &quot;X&quot; is a smooth manifold and the action is smooth,
*&quot;G&quot; is an algebraic group, &quot;X&quot; is an algebraic variety and the action is regular.

==Definition==
If &quot;G&quot; is nonabelian then one must distinguish between left and right torsors according to whether the action is on the left or right. In this article, we will use right actions. 

To state the definition more explicitly, &quot;X&quot; is a &quot;G&quot;-torsor or &quot;G&quot;-principal homogeneous space if &quot;X&quot; is nonempty and is equipped with a map (in the appropriate category) such that
:&quot;x&quot;·1 = &quot;x&quot;
:&quot;x&quot;·(&quot;gh&quot;) = (&quot;x&quot;·&quot;g&quot;)·&quot;h&quot;
for all and all , and such that the map given by
:formula_1
is an isomorphism (of sets, or topological spaces or ..., as appropriate, i.e. in the category in question). 

Note that this means that &quot;X&quot; and &quot;G&quot; are isomorphic (in the category in question; not as groups: see the following). However—and this is the essential point—there is no preferred &#x27;identity&#x27; point in &quot;X&quot;. That is, &quot;X&quot; looks exactly like &quot;G&quot; except that which point is the identity has been forgotten. (This concept is often used in mathematics as a way of passing to a more intrinsic point of view, under the heading &#x27;throw away the origin&#x27;.)

Since &quot;X&quot; is not a group, we cannot multiply elements; we can, however, take their &quot;quotient&quot;. That is, there is a map that sends to the unique element such that .

The composition of the latter operation with the right group action, however, yields a ternary operation , which serves as an affine generalization of group multiplication and which is sufficient to both characterize a principal homogeneous space algebraically and intrinsically characterize the group it is associated with. If we denote formula_2 the result of this ternary operation, then the following identities
:formula_3
:formula_4
will suffice to define a principal homogeneous space, while the additional property
:formula_5
identifies those spaces that are associated with abelian groups. The group may be defined as formal quotients formula_6 subject to the equivalence relation
:formula_7,
with the group product, identity and inverse defined, respectively, by
:formula_8,
:formula_9,
:formula_10
and the group action by
:formula_11

==Examples==

Every group &quot;G&quot; can itself be thought of as a left or right &quot;G&quot;-torsor under the natural action of left or right multiplication.

Another example is the affine space concept: the idea of the affine space &quot;A&quot; underlying a vector space &quot;V&quot; can be said succinctly by saying that &quot;A&quot; is a principal homogeneous space for &quot;V&quot; acting as the additive group of translations.

The flags of any regular polytope form a torsor for its symmetry group.

Given a vector space &quot;V&quot; we can take &quot;G&quot; to be the general linear group GL(&quot;V&quot;), and &quot;X&quot; to be the set of all (ordered) bases of &quot;V&quot;. Then &quot;G&quot; acts on &quot;X&quot; in the way that it acts on vectors of &quot;V&quot;; and it acts transitively since any basis can be transformed via &quot;G&quot; to any other. What is more, a linear transformation fixing each vector of a basis will fix all &quot;v&quot; in &quot;V&quot;, and hence be the neutral element of the general linear group GL(&quot;V&quot;) : so that &quot;X&quot; is indeed a &quot;principal&quot; homogeneous space. One way to follow basis-dependence in a linear algebra argument is to track variables &quot;x&quot; in &quot;X&quot;. Similarly, the space of orthonormal bases (the Stiefel manifold formula_12 of &quot;n&quot;-frames) is a principal homogeneous space for the orthogonal group.

In category theory, if two objects &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot; are isomorphic, then the isomorphisms between them, Iso(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;Y&quot;), form a torsor for the automorphism group of &quot;X&quot;, Aut(&quot;X&quot;), and likewise for Aut(&quot;Y&quot;); a choice of isomorphism between the objects gives rise to an isomorphism between these groups and identifies the torsor with these two groups, giving the torsor a group structure (as it has now a base point).

==Applications==

The principal homogeneous space concept is a special case of that of principal bundle: it means a principal bundle with base a single point. In other words the local theory of principal bundles is that of a family of principal homogeneous spaces depending on some parameters in the base. The &#x27;origin&#x27; can be supplied by a section of the bundle—such sections are usually assumed to exist &quot;locally on the base&quot;—the bundle being &quot;locally trivial&quot;, so that the local structure is that of a cartesian product. But sections will often not exist globally. For example a differential manifold &quot;M&quot; has a principal bundle of frames associated to its tangent bundle. A global section will exist (by definition) only when &quot;M&quot; is parallelizable, which implies strong topological restrictions.

In number theory there is a (superficially different) reason to consider principal homogeneous spaces, for elliptic curves &quot;E&quot; defined over a field &quot;K&quot; (and more general abelian varieties). Once this was understood, various other examples were collected under the heading, for other algebraic groups: quadratic forms for orthogonal groups, and Severi–Brauer varieties for projective linear groups being two.

The reason of the interest for Diophantine equations, in the elliptic curve case, is that &quot;K&quot; may not be algebraically closed. There can exist curves &quot;C&quot; that have no point defined over &quot;K&quot;, and which become isomorphic over a larger field to &quot;E&quot;, which by definition has a point over &quot;K&quot; to serve as identity element for its addition law. That is, for this case we should distinguish &quot;C&quot; that have genus 1, from elliptic curves &quot;E&quot; that have a &quot;K&quot;-point (or, in other words, provide a Diophantine equation that has a solution in &quot;K&quot;). The curves &quot;C&quot; turn out to be torsors over &quot;E&quot;, and form a set carrying a rich structure in the case that &quot;K&quot; is a number field (the theory of the Selmer group). In fact a typical plane cubic curve &quot;C&quot; over Q has no particular reason to have a rational point; the standard Weierstrass model always does, namely the point at infinity, but you need a point over &quot;K&quot; to put &quot;C&quot; into that form &quot;over&quot; &quot;K&quot;.

This theory has been developed with great attention to local analysis, leading to the definition of the Tate–Shafarevich group. In general the approach of taking the torsor theory, easy over an algebraically closed field, and trying to get back &#x27;down&#x27; to a smaller field is an aspect of descent. It leads at once to questions of Galois cohomology, since the torsors represent classes in group cohomology &quot;H&quot;1.

==Other usage==
The concept of a principal homogeneous space can also be globalized as follows. Let &quot;X&quot; be a &quot;space&quot; (a scheme/manifold/topological space etc.), and let &quot;G&quot; be a group over &quot;X&quot;, i.e., a group object in the category of spaces over &quot;X&quot;. In this case, a (right, say) &quot;G&quot;-torsor &quot;E&quot; on &quot;X&quot; is a space &quot;E&quot; (of the same type) over &quot;X&quot; with a (right) &quot;G&quot; action such that the morphism 

:formula_13 

given by 

:formula_14 

is an isomorphism in the appropriate category, and such that &quot;E&quot; is locally trivial on &quot;X&quot;, in that acquires a section locally on &quot;X&quot;. Isomorphism classes of torsors in this sense correspond to classes in the cohomology group &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;X&quot;,&quot;G&quot;).

When we are in the smooth manifold category, then a &quot;G&quot;-torsor (for &quot;G&quot; a Lie group) is then precisely a principal &quot;G&quot;-bundle as defined above.

Example: if &quot;G&quot; is a compact Lie group (say), then formula_15 is a &quot;G&quot;-torsor over the classifying space formula_16.

<text>An inorganic compound is typically a chemical compound that lacks carbon–hydrogen bonds⁠that is, a compound that is not an organic compound. The study of inorganic compounds is a subfield of chemistry known as &quot;inorganic chemistry&quot;.

Inorganic compounds comprise most of the Earth&#x27;s crust, although the compositions of the deep mantle remain active areas of investigation.

All allotropes (structurally different pure forms of an element) and some simple carbon compounds are often considered inorganic. Examples include the allotropes of carbon (graphite, diamond, buckminsterfullerene, graphene, etc.), carbon monoxide , carbon dioxide , carbides, and salts of inorganic anions such as carbonates, cyanides, cyanates, thiocyanates, isothiocyanates, etc. Many of these are normal parts of mostly organic systems, including organisms; describing a chemical as inorganic does not necessarily mean that it cannot occur within living things.

== History ==
Friedrich Wöhler&#x27;s conversion of ammonium cyanate into urea in 1828 is often cited as the starting point of modern organic chemistry. In Wöhler&#x27;s era, there was widespread belief that organic compounds were characterized by a vital spirit. In the absence of vitalism, the distinction between inorganic and organic chemistry is merely semantic.

=== Modern usage ===
* The Inorganic Crystal Structure Database (ICSD) in its definition of &quot;inorganic&quot; carbon compounds, states that such compounds may contain &quot;either&quot; C-H or C-C bonds, but not both.
* The book series &quot;Inorganic Syntheses&quot; does not define inorganic compounds. The majority of its content deals with metal complexes of organic ligands.
* IUPAC does not offer a definition of &quot;inorganic&quot; or &quot;inorganic compound&quot; but does define inorganic polymer as &quot;...skeletal structure that does not include carbon atoms.&quot;

<text>Dry cask storage is a method of storing high-level radioactive waste, such as spent nuclear fuel that has already been cooled in a spent fuel pool for at least one year and often as much as ten years. Casks are typically steel cylinders that are either welded or bolted closed. The fuel rods inside are surrounded by inert gas. Ideally, the steel cylinder provides leak-tight containment of the spent fuel. Each cylinder is surrounded by additional steel, concrete, or other material to provide radiation shielding to workers and members of the public.

There are various dry storage cask system designs. With some designs, the steel cylinders containing the fuel are placed vertically in a concrete vault; other designs orient the cylinders horizontally. The concrete vaults provide the radiation shielding. Other cask designs orient the steel cylinder vertically on a concrete pad at a dry cask storage site and use both metal and concrete outer cylinders for radiation shielding. Until 2024/25, there was no long term permanent storage facility anywhere in the world, and most countries still don&#x27;t have a facility; dry cask storage is designed as an interim safer solution than spent fuel pool storage.

 Some of the cask designs can be used for both storage and transportation. Three companies – Holtec International, NAC International and Areva-Transnuclear NUHOMS – are marketing Independent Spent Fuel Storage Installations (ISFSI) based upon an unshielded multi-purpose canister which is transported and stored in on-site vertical or horizontal shielded storage modules constructed of steel and concrete.

==Usage==
During the 2000s, dry cask storage was used in the United States, Canada, Germany, Switzerland, Spain, Belgium, the United Kingdom, Japan, Armenia, Argentina, Bulgaria, Czech Republic, Hungary, South Korea, Romania, Slovakia, Ukraine and Lithuania.

A similar system is also being implemented in Russia. However, it is based on &#x27;storage compartments&#x27; in a single structure, rather than individual casks.

In 2017, France&#x27;s Areva introduced the NUHOMS Matrix advanced used nuclear fuel storage overpack, a high-density system for storing multiple spent fuel rods in canisters.

===United States===
In the late 1970s and early 1980s, the need for alternative storage in the United States began to grow when cooling pools at many nuclear reactors began to fill with stored spent fuel. As there was not a national nuclear storage facility in operation at the time, utilities began looking at options for storing spent fuel. Dry cask storage was determined to be a practical option for storage of spent fuel and preferable to leaving large concentrations of spent fuel in cooling tanks. The first dry storage installation in the US was licensed by the Nuclear Regulatory Commission (NRC) in 1986 at the Surry Nuclear Power Plant in Virginia. Spent fuel is currently stored in dry cask systems at a growing number of power plant sites, and at an interim facility located at the Idaho National Laboratory near Idaho Falls, Idaho. The NRC estimated that many of the nuclear power plants in the United States will be out of room in their spent fuel pools by 2015, most likely requiring the use of temporary storage of some kind. Yucca Mountain, in Nevada, was expected to open in 2017. However, on March 5, 2009, Energy Secretary Steven Chu reiterated in a Senate hearing that the Yucca Mountain site was no longer considered an option for storing reactor waste.

The 2008, NRC guidelines call for fuels to have spent at least five years in a storage pool before being moved to dry casks. The industry norm is about 10 years. The NRC describes the dry casks used in the US as &quot;designed to resist floods, tornadoes, projectiles, temperature extremes, and other unusual scenarios.&quot;

As of the end of 2009, 13,856 metric tons of commercial spent fuel – or about 22% – were stored in dry casks.

In the 1990s, the NRC had to “take repeated actions to address defective welds on dry casks that led to cracks and quality assurance problems; helium had leaked into some casks, increasing temperatures and causing accelerated fuel corrosion”.

With the zeroing of the federal budget for the Yucca Mountain nuclear waste repository in Nevada, more nuclear waste is being loaded into sealed metal casks filled with inert gas. Many of these casks will be stored in coastal or lakeside regions where a salt air environment exists, and the Massachusetts Institute of Technology is studying how such dry casks perform in salt environments. Cracking related to corrosion could occur in 30 years or less, and the NRC is studying whether the casks can be used for 100 years as some hope.

According to the NRC&#x27;s website in 2023, spent fuel placed in dry cask storage from the Diablo Canyon power plant in California shows no sign of corrosion after more than a decade of storage and appears to be capable of lasting for 1800 years before succumbing to corrosion. Company videos, covering the processes and remote handling, from the initial fuel loading to the removal and eventual dry-cask storage, are viewable on various video hosting domains.

===Canada===
In Canada, above-ground dry storage has been used. Ontario Power Generation is in the process of constructing a Dry Storage Cask storage facility on its Darlington site, which will be similar in many respects to existing facilities at Pickering Nuclear Generating Station and Bruce Nuclear Generating Station. NB Power&#x27;s Point Lepreau Nuclear Generating Station and Hydro-Québec&#x27;s Gentilly Nuclear Generating Station also both operate dry storage facilities.

=== Germany ===
A centralized storage facility using dry casks is located at Ahaus. As of 2011, it housed 311 casks: 305 from the Thorium High Temperature Reactor, 3 from the Neckarwestheim Nuclear Power Plant, and 3 from the Gundremmingen Nuclear Power Plant. The transport from Gundremmingen to the Ahaus site met with considerable public protest and the power plant operators and the government later agreed to locate such casks at the powerplants.

&quot;CASTOR&quot; () is a trademarked brand of dry casks used to store spent nuclear fuel (a type of nuclear waste). CASTORs are manufactured by Gesellschaft für Nuklear-Service (GNS), a German provider of nuclear services.

&quot;CONSTOR&quot; is a cask used for transport and long-term storage of spent fuel and high-level waste also manufactured by GNS. Its inner and outer layers are steel, enclosing a layer of concrete. A 9-meter drop test of the V/TC model was conducted in 2004; the results conformed to expectations.

===Bulgaria===
In 2008, officials at the Kozloduy Nuclear Power Plant announced their intention to use 34 CONSTOR casks at the Kozloduy NPP site before the end of 2010.

===Lithuania===
Spent fuel from the now-closed Ignalina Nuclear Power Plant was placed in CASTOR and CONSTOR storage casks during the 2000s.

===Russia===
The Russian dry storage facility for spent nuclear fuel, the HOT-2 at Mining Chemical Combine in Zheleznogorsk, Krasnoyarsk Krai in Siberia, is not a &#x27;cask&#x27; facility per se, as it is designed to accommodate the spent nuclear fuel (both VVER and RBMK) in a series of compartments. The structure of the facility is made up of monolithic reinforced concrete walls and top and bottom slabs, with the actual storage compartments formed by reinforced concrete partitions. The fuel is to be cooled by natural convection of air. The design capacity of the facility is 37,785 tonnes of uranium. It is now under construction and in the process of commissioning.

===Ukraine===
In Ukraine, a dry storage facility has been accepting spent fuel from the six-unit Zaporizhzhia Nuclear Power Plant (VVER-1000 reactors) since 2001, making it the longest-serving such facility in the former Soviet Union. The system was designed by the now-defunct Duke Engineering of the United States, with the storage casks being manufactured locally.

Another project is underway with Holtec International (of the USA) to build a dry spent fuel storage facility at the 1986 accident Chernobyl Nuclear Power Plant (RBMK-1000 reactors). The project was initially started with Framatome (currently AREVA) of France, later suspended and terminated due to technical difficulties. Holtec was originally hired as a subcontractor to dehydrate the spent fuel, eventually taking over the entire project.

<doc id="363450" wikidata="Q292986" url="?curid=363450" title="Blink-182 (album)">
<text>Blink-182 (also referred to as the untitled album) is the fifth studio album by American rock band Blink-182, released on November 18, 2003, by Geffen Records. Following their ascent to stardom and success of their prior two releases, the trio was compelled to take a break and participated in various side projects (Box Car Racer and Transplants). When they regrouped, they felt inspired to approach song structure and arrangements differently on their next effort together.

Recorded from December 2002 to September 2003 with producer Jerry Finn, the album has been described as darker and more mature than the band&#x27;s earlier work. It also marked a musical departure from their previous efforts, infusing experimental elements, inspired by lifestyle changes (the band members all became fathers before the album was released) and side projects, into their usual pop-punk sound. Its songs are sonically expansive and downcast, leading critics to view it as a more elaborate, mature side of the band. The songwriting is more personal in nature and explores darker territory, touching upon the realities of adulthood and unexpected hardships. In addition, its recording process was long and often unconventional.

Fans were generally split regarding the band&#x27;s &quot;new&quot; direction, but the album proved successful, selling 2.2 million copies in the United States. It received positive reviews, with critics welcoming its change in tone. Lead singles &quot;Feeling This&quot; and &quot;I Miss You&quot; received the most radio airplay out of the four singles released, and peaked high on &quot;Billboard&quot; charts. The worldwide touring schedule, which saw the band travel to Japan and Australia, also found the three performing for U.S. military troops stationed in the Middle East. The album was the band&#x27;s last recording with longtime producer Jerry Finn and their final original material before a four-year-long hiatus. It is also their longest studio album to date, clocking in at 49 minutes.

==Background==

After a decade of touring and making music, Blink-182 had reached a breaking point. The trio—guitarist Tom Delonge, bassist Mark Hoppus, and drummer Travis Barker—had seen their lives change dramatically as their band reached superstar levels of fame. Their fourth album, &quot;Take Off Your Pants and Jacket&quot; (2001), had gone multi-platinum just as its predecessor, and throughout 2002 they co-headlined with genre forebears Green Day in arenas and amphitheaters across North America. Beneath the surface, however, relations were becoming strained. They became conflicted on their goofy, nudist public image, and Hoppus and DeLonge began to clash creatively, with DeLonge striving for a heavier sound. Barker felt the dynamics of the band change with Hoppus and DeLonge&#x27;s marriages: &quot;Blink-182 were no longer just three inseparable guys who were touring together.&quot; Later, he began dating model Shanna Moakler, inviting tabloid attention, adding to the &quot;awkwardness&quot; present in the band. The September 11 attacks put an end to any immediate touring plans, leading to a brief gap in their frenetic schedule.

Over the break, DeLonge began to suffer from significant back pain due to a herniated disc, and had privately become discontented by the constraints placed by the record label and the band&#x27;s signature sound, which was becoming popularized elsewhere. He felt a desire to broaden his musical palette, and channeled these frustrations into an album, inspired by post-hardcore bands like Fugazi and Refused. Blink producer Jerry Finn naturally returned to engineer, and DeLonge, ostensibly trying to avoid paying a session player, invited Barker to record drums—making Hoppus the odd man out. It marked a major rift in their friendship: while DeLonge claimed he was not intentionally omitted, Hoppus nonetheless felt betrayed. &quot;At the end of 2001, it felt like Blink-182 had broken up. It wasn&#x27;t spoken about, but it felt over&quot;, said Hoppus later. With A&amp;R representatives from MCA Records eager to market a new band by the guitarist, this new band, called Box Car Racer, quickly evolved into a full-fledged side project, launching two national tours throughout 2002. It was an &quot;uncomfortable&quot; time in the band according to Hoppus, but the three had &quot;hundreds of discussions about it&quot; and seemingly moved on, as he relayed to an interviewer in 2003. Later, the group admitted that the tension continued to follow them over the years.

The heavier sound of &quot;Box Car Racer&quot; inspired the change in tone and experimental nature the band approached &quot;Blink-182&quot; with. Hoppus described his desire for the album to experiment with different arrangements in a 2002 interview: &quot;Before, we got one guitar sound that we changed a little bit through the record. This time we want to try a whole different setup for each song.&quot; Hoppus recalled that Barker entered the production process by urging the band to &quot;[not think of the album] as the next Blink-182 record — think of it as the &quot;first&quot; Blink-182 record.&quot; &quot;Once the door was opened by Tom and Travis with &quot;Box Car Racer&quot;, Mark started to be more on board with that concept. He was also more flexible and the next Blink album was able to be a pretty big departure from the previous two&quot;, said assistant engineer Sam Boukas. &quot;&quot;Box Car Racer&quot; opened the door in that sense and I think the three of them wanted to be more creative and have more creative liberty on that next album.&quot; Meanwhile, Barker also extended his love of hip-hop into the rap rock outfit Transplants, a collaboration with Rancid&#x27;s Tim Armstrong.

==Recording and production==

In January 2003, the band rented a home in the San Diego luxury community of Rancho Santa Fe, planning to record the entire album there. In addition to the home being converted into a studio, pay-per-view pornography was on continuous play, and it included a space to &quot;smoke hella weed&quot; in the garage. The trio ditched their typical previous recording process (writing and demoing several songs and recording them in a studio one instrument at a time) and instead approached each song together. The band &quot;attacked&quot; each song and worked on three to four songs per day, simply moving on to the next one when feeling &quot;burned out&quot; on a track. The band also had fun at the home studio; DeLonge commented, &quot;If I wasn&#x27;t smoking half of Colombia I probably ran up $3 million in adult film charges.&quot; The in-studio antics and behind the scenes moments were recorded and posted on the official Blink-182 website throughout 2003, as well as on a MTV album release segment. The band recorded at the home until April 2003, when the owners of the house &quot;kicked them out.&quot; Barker, unwilling to leave Moakler, would drive from Los Angeles to San Diego each day. He subsequently left that spring to tour with Transplants, leaving the band with a variety of drum tracks to listen to while he was gone. Barker estimated that seven songs were in working stages when he left for the tour, with an additional seven completed upon return. The trio recorded the rest of the album at several facilities, including Signature Sound and Rolling Thunder in San Diego, and Conway Recording Studios in Los Angeles. Jerry Finn, who had produced the previous two Blink-182 albums and the Box Car Racer album, returned to produce &quot;Blink-182&quot;, which would be his final collaboration with the band.

Altogether, the recording period of the album, as well its mixing and mastering, lasted from January to October 2003. Previous Blink-182 sessions were recorded in three months. The band stated that taking their time in the studio gave them the luxury of experimenting with different methods of writing, playing, and recording. The band built each song with a minute attention to detail. Barker brought in a copy of Pink Floyd&#x27;s &quot;The Wall&quot;, which he mentioned as an inspiration in the album&#x27;s liner notes. To that end, the group also enlisted the help of James Guthrie, an engineer behind &quot;The Wall&quot;. The band also collaborated with The Cure frontman Robert Smith on &quot;All of This&quot;. The team sent Smith the bed track of the tune in hopes he would contribute; Smith obliged and recorded his parts in England. The three initially believed their legitimacy would be in question due to the goofy nature of their earlier work, to which Smith responded, &quot;Nobody knows what kind of songs you are going to write in the future and nobody knows the full potential of any band. I really like the music you sent me.&quot; The band also collaborated with DJ Shadow and Dan the Automator, and Barker had desired to work with the Neptunes.

Though the band had their share of arguments in the past, making the album was a positive experience. Hoppus, who reportedly was conflicted on the new direction, felt the goal of illustrating more depth to the band was achieved: &quot;We needed to prove that there was something deeper than [...] the dudes that ran naked in the video,&quot; he said. For Barker, he later considered it his favorite time in the band&#x27;s history, commenting, &quot;That was a good time in my life,&quot; he reminisced some time later: &quot;That&#x27;s by far my favorite album we did.&quot; The leisurely pace came at a caveat: the release date kept getting missed and pushed back to the point where Jordan Schur, then-president of then-main label Geffen, made calls asking, &quot;What is the absolute last possible second that we can turn this thing in and still make our release date?&quot; DeLonge described the final days of mixing the album as &quot;crazy stressful&quot;, with &quot;literally hours to turn [the album] to have it come it out on time.&quot; The album was in production so late that final mixes were still being judged by Hoppus, DeLonge, and Barker the night before the album was sent to the pressing plant.
===Technical===
On the technical side, Hoppus described the studio as a &quot;musical laboratory&quot;: over 70 guitars, 30 amps, &quot;30 or 40&quot; different snare drums, up to six drum kits, and various keyboards and pianos were used in the album&#x27;s production, many of which came from Finn&#x27;s personal collection. More unusual instrumentation was also present: the band toyed with turntables, harmonium organs, Polynesian Gamelan bells, and a polyphonic tape replay keyboard. Many songs utilized unusual mic techniques. One example is the song &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot;, which was recorded using a microphone dating to the 1950s, and the reverb on the vocals was achieved by playing the recordings into a shower. The drum fills for the song were recorded separately than the rest of the tracks, with the tape machines &quot;sped up and super compressed&quot;, then played back at normal speed, to sound really &quot;deep and gigantic&quot;. Similarly, on &quot;Asthenia&quot;, the intro was achieved by recording the guitar through a failing Leslie speaker with a blown-out tube for excessive noise and scratchiness.

As opposed to recording all drum tracks using the same setup and mic technique, each song uses a different setup. Barker would often turn on a click track and simply play, and many songs originated from his drum beats, in a reverse of a typical songwriting process. Barker would often record a 4/4 base track and a half-time version, in order to have two working versions of each song, leading to interesting segues, like the transition between &quot;Easy Target&quot; and &quot;All of This&quot;. The drums for &quot;Easy Target&quot; were recorded entirely separately — snare, hi-hat, toms, crash cymbals, and so on — for a uniquely disorienting effect: &quot;to purposely confuse people.&quot; Barker pulled from his experience on the aforementioned Transplants tour, where he recorded each drum separately in his bus due to a lack of studio space. Several songs sound like they were made on an electronic kit but were simply Barker&#x27;s bass drum and a Ribbon Crasher, recorded in unusual ways.

==Composition==
===Music and style===

While still rooted in pop-punk, &quot;Untitled&quot; finds the band expanding their sonic template with darker, restless songs and off-kilter hooks. All three members felt encumbered by the standard 4/4 punk pattern and had a desire to expand. The compositions on the record have been described as musically diverse and &quot;borderline experimental.&quot; Overall, the album&#x27;s general sound has been described as pop-punk, alternative rock, emo, new wave, and post-hardcore. It additionally pulls from concepts like New Romanticism, gothic pop, jangle pop, post-punk and power pop. Ben Wener, of the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot;, described the composition of the album as &quot;expansive, downcast, and sometimes spectral.&quot; Kelefa Sanneh, writing for &quot;The New York Times&quot;, considered that the album may have been influenced by the growing presence of emo pop. &quot;Much of the punk has been dissolved, the buzzsaw guitars faded into the corners, allowing room for staggering dynamics, cathartic guitar bursts and a weightier, more experimental and ambitious sound&quot;, wrote Tom Bryant of &quot;Kerrang!&quot;. In an interview with &quot;MTV Album Launch&quot;, Hoppus said that the desired effect of the album was for people to listen to it and say, &quot;Wait a minute...that&#x27;s Blink-182?&quot;

One of the primary musical influences on the album was Failure&#x27;s 1996 album &quot;Fantastic Planet&quot;. Near the end of the recording process, the band asked Ken Andrews, frontman of Failure, to contribute to its songs at his choosing. Andrews ended up adding guitars and keyboards to &quot;Obvious&quot; and &quot;Violence&quot;, as well as uncredited mixing. Another influence on the trio was the expansive sound of Bad Astronaut&#x27;s &quot;&quot; (2002).

===Lyrics===

The goal for &quot;Untitled&quot; was continuity: each song develops lyrically like chapters in a book, and songs segue into one another to present a cohesive feel instead of a regular collection of tracks. Barker envisioned the album like a &quot;mini-movie&quot;. The album abandons the band&#x27;s sunnier disposition and humor for weightier, dramatic prose. Themes include growing up and dealing with the realities of adulthood, including relationship woes, daily pressures, and unexpected hardships. The album is lyrically consumed with sorrow and uncertainty about the world. &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; interpreted it as a concept album based on a dying relationship, a &quot;self-meditation on romantic decay.&quot; Frequently, publications remarked with incredulity at the band&#x27;s &quot;newfound&quot; maturity. &quot;We wanted to be different,&quot; remarked DeLonge. &quot;Some of our fans were probably like, &#x27;Fuck, maybe they should stop joking so people could hear why I like this band.&#x27; And I think this record is going to help those kids out.&quot;

Lyrics continue to be autobiographical, but the band took more time than usual on their writing. DeLonge would routinely rewrite his sections upwards of four times. &quot;I think at this point in our career, we&#x27;ve evolved our way of thinking as far as songwriting&quot;, DeLonge told &quot;Billboard&quot; in reference to the more refined lyricism. Hoppus, in his interview with the &quot;Milwaukee Journal Sentinel&quot;, described the lyrics as the most personal he had written to that point. While past recordings tended to meditate on feelings from high school, the band felt it was akin to a safety net and desired to write about &quot;what&#x27;s going on [...] right now.&quot; Barker occasionally gave input on lyrical decisions as well for the first time. Some of the subject matter was inspired by lifestyle changes—the band members all became fathers before the album was released. The glum mood of the album was partially inspired by the September 11 attacks and the onset of the Iraq War. The mood was unsettling for DeLonge, whose brother is a Navy officer: &quot;It was so weird because we&#x27;d all be glued to the TV, watching these bombs explode over another country. So I&#x27;d see all this and wonder where he was at, and then we&#x27;d have to go into the next room and sing or finish writing lyrics. I think it affected our moods throughout the day.&quot; Barker felt that anger and aggression — oftentimes due to his divorce from his first wife, Melissa Kennedy — sank into his recorded parts. In addition, some of the lyrics were inspired by the band simply socializing together: &quot;We would just hang out for hours talking. It was really cool,&quot; said DeLonge.

==Songs==

The record opens with &quot;Feeling This&quot;, which features flanged drums and an unconventional &quot;syncopated Latin-flavored backbeat and a harmony-rich chorus&quot; following a series of &quot;half-barked&quot; vocals. It was the first song written for the album and illustrates a scenario of lust, ambivalence, and regret, with the protagonist of the song reflecting over his romance&#x27;s dimming flame in the chorus: &quot;Fate fell short this time / Your smile fades in the summer.&quot; Hoppus and DeLonge wrote the song in two different rooms and upon meeting to discuss the song, the two realized they had both written about sex—the passionate, lustful side (reflected in the verses) and the romantic side (the choruses). &quot;Obvious&quot; opens with a brooding, discordant guitar riff, and explores the Wall of Sound technique. &quot;I Miss You&quot; is an all-acoustic affair, featuring a melancholy piano, cello, upright acoustic bass, and a &quot;brushstroked hip-hop groove.&quot; The song features references to Tim Burton&#x27;s 1993 animated film &quot;The Nightmare Before Christmas&quot; with &quot;We can live like Jack and Sally&quot; and &quot;We&#x27;ll have Halloween on Christmas&quot;. In interviews and the liner notes for &quot;Blink-182&quot;, Barker reveals that the line was directed towards his then girlfriend, Shanna Moakler. 

&quot;Violence&quot; equates broken hearts with global warfare. It explores a jazzy spoken-word style and was envisioned as an account of a fictional femme fatale being lusted after by strangers at a late-night bar. &quot;Stockholm Syndrome&quot;, named for the psychological condition, focuses thematically on paranoia: “[It&#x27;s about] being afraid of the outside world [and] convinced that people can hear your thoughts,&quot; Hoppus said. It contains an interlude preceding it, in which actress Joanne Whalley reads letters Hoppus&#x27;s grandfather wrote to his grandmother during World War II. DeLonge called the valentines &quot;real sincere, genuine [correspondence] from the worst war in history.&quot; &quot;Down&quot; continues the theme of longing; DeLonge developed the song imagining a couple in a car, overcome by desire during a cascading rainfall. The original version of &quot;Down&quot; ran over six minutes long, and contained a drum and bass breakdown from Barker. &quot;The Fallen Interlude&quot;, which functions as an near-instrumental outro to &quot;Down&quot;, finds Barker showcasing different percussive techniques over a funk-tinged jazz sound. It was recorded with Sick Jacken of hip-hop band Psycho Realm. &quot;Go&quot; is an urgent, broken family diegesis from Hoppus filtered through vivid snapshots of his childhood: “Locked outside the door back in &#x27;83 / I heard the angry voice of the man inside / And saw the look of fear in my mother&#x27;s eyes.” Hoppus confirmed the song was about domestic violence in the album&#x27;s booklet, but stopped short of much else in an interview: &quot;It&#x27;s not specifically about my mother... I feel weird talking about it.&quot;

&quot;Asthenia&quot; is named after the breakdown of life in space, and centers on a lonely, stranded astronaut viewing Earth from a capsule, indifferent about returning. DeLonge said the song was &quot;about the loss of hope&quot;; it was spawned by his personal torment regarding the future, and how war and famine might affect the world. The intro uses real NASA transmissions from the Apollo 9 space flight. &quot;Always&quot; is a love letter to new wave music, with an uptempo backbeat, dry production and dreamy keyboard riffs. The band often called the track the &quot;&#x27;80s song&quot; while making it. &quot;Easy Target&quot; and &quot;All of This&quot; stem from a story from producer Jerry Finn. While in middle school, Finn had a crush with a female classmate, Holly, who invited him over to her house. When he rode there on his bicycle, she and a friend drenched him with a hose, and he rode home humiliated. &quot;All of This&quot; is a gothic-tinged pop song that uses strings and guitar effects to create a moody atmosphere. Hoppus described &quot;Here&#x27;s Your Letter&quot; as about &quot;people&#x27;s inability to communicate with one another and how words and explanations only confuse the issues.&quot; &quot;I&#x27;m Lost Without You&quot; mixes an industrial loop with piano. The latter track took many months to create, and took &quot;over 50&quot; different tracks, including two drum sets combined during the last minute of the song. Barker described the idea for the percussion combination as &quot;something we always wanted to do, but never got around to&quot; and believed the song sounded like Pink Floyd or Failure.

&quot;Not Now&quot;, a B-side recorded during the sessions, is occasionally appended to the album. It features a church organ in its verses and guitar riffs reminiscent of the Descendents. Its subject matter continues the theme of complicated miscommunication and fading love.

==Packaging and title==

Due to some contradicting sources, the title of the album (or lack thereof) is debated. Travis Barker, in his memoir &quot;Can I Say&quot;, writes that &quot;Some people think it&#x27;s an untitled album, called &quot;Blink-182&quot;, but Mark [Hoppus] has always insisted it was actually untitled.&quot; A 2003 interview and article from MTV News discussing the naming of the pending album repeatedly refers to the release as the &quot;untitled album,&quot; while a press release from that time period confirms the same. Despite this, several critics have used the terms &quot;eponymous&quot;, &quot;untitled&quot;, and &quot;self-titled&quot; in describing the album. In a 2009 MTV News article, James Montgomery refers to the album as self-titled, joking, &quot;Or untitled … It&#x27;s never really been clear.&quot; The title for the album was originally rumored to be &quot;Use Your Erection I &amp; II&quot;, a parody of the Guns N&#x27; Roses albums &quot;Use Your Illusion I&quot; and &quot;II&quot;, but was revealed to be a joke Barker made to &quot;get a rise out of people.&quot; DeLonge, in reference to previous joke album titles (such as &quot;Enema of the State&quot;), stated, &quot;We didn&#x27;t want to label it with a joke title that people might expect.&quot; As such, a &quot;Billboard&quot; article from the week of the album&#x27;s release lists three rejected joke titles: &quot;Diarrhea de Janeiro&quot;, &quot;Vasectomy, Vasect-a-you&quot; and &quot;Our &quot;Pet Sounds&quot;&quot;.

To support the new album, Blink-182 created an entirely new logo, a &quot;smiley face&quot; with Xs for each eye and five arrows on the left side of its face. According to Barker, the Blink-182 logo originated at his clothing line, Famous Stars and Straps. Barker wanted to brand an icon for the band: &quot;It just had to be a cool kind of happy face but I wanted arrows. You know, like the Jam were my favorite band, they always had arrows in their logos and stuff. It was just kind of inspired by pop-art.&quot; Hoppus seconded this sentiment: &quot;He spearheaded all the artwork for the record. There were smiley-face stickers and posters all over Los Angeles, and that was his idea.&quot; Barker invited his tattoo artist, Mister Cartoon, to create artwork for the record, and his friend Estevan Oriol to handle photography. &quot;His style, incorporated into Blink&#x27;s, didn&#x27;t make us too gangster: it just gave us a bit of an edge. It was cool to feel like Blink had a dangerous side&quot;, Barker later remembered.

The album&#x27;s booklet is ornate, and each song includes small notes detailing the lyrical inspiration for each song, what it means to each band member, and the recording techniques used. musicOMH described the album booklet as &quot;...meticulously put together and resembling a Warholian pastiche.&quot; The band originally wanted each CD booklet to be made from canvas material. Geffen gave the band a choice between the custom artwork or keeping the sale price down to US$12, and the band chose the latter, as they felt it was more important that young listeners obtain the record for less money. Mark Hoppus stated that the album was so &quot;personal to all three of us that we really wanted to be involved in every aspect of it.&quot; The enhanced CD contains small, home-made videos for several songs, as well as the official music video for &quot;Feeling This&quot;.

==Promotion and singles==

&quot;Untitled&quot; was the band&#x27;s first release on Geffen Records, which absorbed sister label MCA in 2003. Prior to it dissolving, MCA had attempted to penalize the band for breaking stipulations in their contract that they would have an album out by a specific quarter. MCA had previously rushed the band into recording &quot;Take Off Your Pants and Jacket&quot;, but the band had much more freedom with Geffen. &quot;Geffen came down and heard three songs and &quot;they&quot; said, &#x27;This is the best record you&#x27;ve ever done, this is the record of your career, take as much time as you want, call us when it&#x27;s done,&#x27;&quot; DeLonge stated. &quot;It just completely outlined the perspective of putting accounting before creative, and when you&#x27;re in the entertainment business, you&#x27;ve &quot;got&quot; to put creative first. It&#x27;s an art, you&#x27;ve got to look at it like an art, treat it like an art, and then you&#x27;ll get the best product in the long run.&quot;

Promotion for the record included a &quot;golden ticket&quot; contest – the prize being a private Blink-182 show for the winner. MTV&#x27;s website streamed the full album a week before its release, beginning on November 10. As promotion for the album and single release[s], the band performed &quot;Feeling This&quot; on &quot;Jimmy Kimmel Live!&quot; a week after the release of the album on November 26, 2003, and &quot;Down&quot; on &quot;Late Show with David Letterman&quot; on May 27, 2004. Performances of &quot;I Miss You&quot; and &quot;The Rock Show&quot; on The WB&#x27;s &quot;Pepsi Smash&quot; concert series from June 10, 2004, were released on the Australian Tour edition of the album, as well as the &quot;Always&quot; single.

The band picked &quot;Feeling This&quot; as the first single because it was representative of the transition the band had undergone since &quot;Take Off Your Pants and Jacket&quot;. A slightly different version of the song had been released previously as part of the soundtrack for the video game &quot;Madden NFL 2004&quot; under the erroneous title &quot;Action&quot;. Barker explained in an interview that &quot;&#x27;Action&#x27; just sounded kind of dorky to us. Like we would always call it &#x27;Feeling This&#x27; and then someone at our label, I think, like wrote it as &#x27;Action&#x27; one time and sent out singles to people. And it was always supposed to be &#x27;Feeling This&#x27;.&quot; The video for &quot;Feeling This&quot; was recorded shortly before the release of the album in October 2003. The track peaked high at number 2 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart, hovering at that position for three weeks. &quot;I Miss You&quot; was commissioned as the record&#x27;s second single in December 2003 when the band recorded a music video for it. &quot;I Miss You&quot; became arguably the most successful single from the album, becoming Blink-182&#x27;s second number one hit on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart during the week of April 3, 2004, until dethroned by Hoobastank&#x27;s &quot;The Reason&quot; two weeks later.

Despite briefly considering &quot;Easy Target&quot; to be released as the album&#x27;s third single, &quot;Down&quot; was released instead. The video for &quot;Down&quot;, which features real-life ex-gang members, made its television premiere in June 2004. The single was a mixed success, peaking at number 10 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Modern Rock Tracks chart during the week of July 31, 2004, but quickly falling off afterward. &quot;Always&quot; was announced as the fourth and final single from &quot;Blink-182&quot; in August 2004. &quot;It&#x27;s gonna change people&#x27;s lives and might actually change the world forever&quot;, DeLonge jokingly predicted. After deciding on the video concept, the clip was recorded and released in November 2004 and continued success all the way into January 2005. A fifth single from the album (&quot;All of This&quot;) was discussed; however, plans were dropped following the band&#x27;s declaration of an &#x27;indefinite hiatus&#x27; in February 2005. In response to the idea of &quot;All of This&quot; becoming a possible single, DeLonge joked &quot;We would love it because it&#x27;s a bad-ass song, and The Cure&#x27;s Robert Smith sings on it, and that makes us cooler than everybody else.&quot;

==Critical reception==

The album received generally favorable reviews by music critics. At Metacritic, which assigns a normalized rating out of 100 to reviews from mainstream critics, the album received an average score of 71, based on 12 reviews. Jenny Eliscu of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, while giving the album four stars, wrote that &quot;...their lyrics are still unsophisticated and lovelorn, but even the poppiest tunes prove artful&quot;. Her review regards &quot;Blink-182&quot; as &quot;more experimental and harder-hitting than anything else [the band] has done&quot;. It was subsequently included in the Top 50 Best of 2003 end of the year list by &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;. The album was given four stars by AllMusic&#x27;s Stephen Thomas Erlewine, who called &quot;Blink-182&quot; &quot;an unexpected and welcome maturation from a band that just an album ago seemed permanently stuck in juvenilia.&quot; &quot;Blender&#x27;s&quot; Jonah Weiner praised DeLonge&#x27;s vocals, describing them as a &quot;lean, thrilling ride through adolescent hopelessness.&quot; Many critics expressed surprise at the newfound maturity of the band, and lauded the surprise appearance of The Cure vocalist Robert Smith on the track &quot;All of This&quot;.

The band&#x27;s decision in favor of more mature material was received positively by many critics; Tim Newbound of &quot;Soul Shine Magazine&quot; wrote that &quot;Blink show that they can retain their infectious and endearing qualities while recording music of a more thoughtful calibre.&quot; &quot;Spin&quot; described the record as emotionally intense and best experienced through headphones. &quot;USA Today&quot; Edna Gundersen felt that &quot;Blink-182 bravely adheres to a single sober theme — a disintegrating romance — through 14 songs that adhere to its pop punk principles without recycling cartoonish accessories. Blink-182 is growing up, not growing stale.&quot; Nick Catucci of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; called the album &quot;brilliant&quot; and compared &quot;Blink-182&quot; to fellow pop punk band Green Day&#x27;s 2000 effort, &quot;Warning&quot;, writing, &quot;Let it be noted, however, that &quot;Warning&quot; searches for subject matter where &quot;Blink-182&quot; searches for meaning.&quot; Greg Kot of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; wrote that &quot;Despite their newfound earnestness, [the band] seem incapable of pretension. And in a career littered with songs about awkward moments, their latest is a dork classic.&quot; Scott Shelter of &quot;Slant&quot; gave the album four stars, stating &quot;Giving up the fart jokes is risky business for Blink—but &quot;Blink-182&quot; might just be the band&#x27;s best album to date.&quot; Among the more negative reviews, Jason Arnopp of &quot;Q&quot; felt the majority of material forgettable but commended it as &quot;some of their most imaginatively constructed work.&quot; &quot;The A.V. Club&quot; Stephen Thompson believed &quot;The disc [does] meander in spots, and its most achingly sincere love songs become cloying.&quot;

==Commercial performance==
The album debuted at number three on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, with first-week sales of 313,000 copies. In comparison, &quot;Take Off Your Pants and Jacket&quot; debuted at number one and sold more than 350,000 copies in its first week. The album charted at number three, below fellow new album &quot;In the Zone&quot; by Britney Spears (number one) and above remix album &quot;Let It Be... Naked&quot; by The Beatles (number five). The untitled album charted highest in Canada, where it debuted at number one. The album was also successful in other countries, debuting in the top ten in Australia and New Zealand. According to the IFPI, &quot;Blink-182&quot; was the forty-ninth highest-selling album worldwide in 2003.

The album was certified by the RIAA as platinum for shipments of over one million copies in 2004, although it has since sold over 2.2 million copies in the US and 7 million copies worldwide. It was certified by both the Music Canada and the Australian Recording Industry Association (ARIA) as double platinum. The album has also reached platinum certifications in the United Kingdom.

==Touring==
Blink-182 announced their first tour in support of &quot;Untitled&quot; on October 17, 2003, named the DollaBill Tour. The all-ages club tour featured support acts Bubba Sparxxx and The Kinison, and, as the name suggests, tickets were sold for $1. DeLonge explained the first return to small venues in several years in the initial press release for the tour: &quot;For years we played in small clubs and that&#x27;s where you can really connect with your fans.&quot; The tour ended shortly after the release of &quot;Untitled&quot; on November 21, 2003, at local San Diego venue SOMA. An additional concert at the Phoenix Concert Theatre on December 2, 2003, was held in Toronto, Ontario, Canada with My Chemical Romance as the opener.

A performance at KWOD&#x27;s Twisted X-Mas show shortly before Christmas 2003 became the final show of the year, and a European tour followed in mid-February 2004. During an Australian tour in March 2004, Barker injured his foot and the band was forced to cancel tour dates in Japan for the rest of the month. A U.S. tour took place from late April to May 2004, and a highly publicized tour featuring Blink-182 and No Doubt was performed during June 2004 in support of &quot;Untitled&quot; and No Doubt&#x27;s &quot;The Singles 1992–2003&quot;. The cancelled Australian tour dates were rescheduled and performed in August and September 2004. The band appeared on September 17, 2004, at the &quot;MTV Icon&quot; tribute to The Cure, performing a cover of &quot;A Letter to Elise&quot; and &quot;All of This&quot;, which was recorded and later broadcast on October 31, 2004. The band headed to Europe for a two-week tour near the end of the year, which culminated at their final show on December 16, 2004, at the Point Theatre in Dublin, Ireland.

Although the band had planned for a U.S. tour in support of &quot;Always&quot;, tensions within the band had risen on the final European tour and the band announced an &#x27;indefinite hiatus&#x27; on February 22, 2005, as breakup rumors swirled. After touring through 2004, the three essentially stopped communicating with one another. Hoppus initially had difficulty accepting the group&#x27;s new direction. After some tragic events involving the band and its entourage, Blink-182 reunited in February 2009.

==Legacy==

&quot;Blink-182&quot; was released at a cultural moment when the pop-punk and emo scenes were coalescing to a mainstream peak, and as a new wave of artists indebted to the band, like Fall Out Boy, Paramore, or Panic! at the Disco, came to fill their place. It also fell at the tail-end of an &quot;imperial phase&quot; for the band: fifteen months after its release, the band had broken up, ending what many fans regard as their classic period. In the ensuing years, &quot;Blink-182&quot; developed a legacy due to the relative silence that followed it. &quot;I Miss You&quot; became a cross-generational aughts classic, due in part to DeLonge&#x27;s endlessly meme-able singing style. Shirts emblazoned with the album&#x27;s &quot;smiley&quot; artwork became common fixtures in Hot Topic over the decades. And while the band would reconcile and continue to tour and make albums, &quot;Blink-182&quot; remains a singular touchstone in its catalog—to both fans and the band themselves.

All three members of the band viewed it as a &quot;huge turning point&quot; in their career, marking a change in the way they write and record music, as well as view themselves. In his memoir &quot;Can I Say&quot;, Barker writes: &quot;It had a little bit of everything: we ventured far enough outside our genre to make ourselves happy, but not so far that we offended our fan base. It was a perfect happy medium, and it&#x27;s the Blink album that Mark, Tom, and I are most proud of.&quot; Critics agreed: Chris Lee at the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; referred to &quot;Untitled&quot; as the band&#x27;s &quot;underrated masterwork,&quot; writing that the record is generally considered by &quot;fans, critics and band members alike as its best work, Blink&#x27;s answer to &quot;Pet Sounds&quot; or &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;.&quot; Jon Blistein of Radio.com called the album &quot;an unquestionable masterpiece&quot; in the site&#x27;s &quot;Not Fade Away&quot; series, which examines &quot;some of the greatest albums of the past few decades.&quot; The band celebrated the tenth anniversary of the album by performing it in full in November 2013. After a pair of Hollywood Palladium shows sold out in a record 32 seconds, the band added three additional dates at The Wiltern in Los Angeles, which also sold out.

Two decades after its heyday, it continues to influence younger generations of bands. Hardcore group One Step Closer have professed a love for the album, and Eric Hamm from Citizen called himself a &quot;big fan&quot; of the album. Parker Cannon of the Story So Far described the album as a blueprint to remaining authentic in his career: &quot;[Blink] were just like, “Yeah, it is a crazy time, and we&#x27;re going to write the most progressive body of work that we&#x27;ve ever done, and we don&#x27;t necessarily care if you like it or not. This is who we are.&#x27; So seeing them doing that—and seeing other peers I&#x27;ve had in music &quot;not&quot; do that—has showed me how to stay the course and how to stay true.&quot;

<text>Benjamin Lundy (January 4, 1789August 22, 1839) was an American Quaker abolitionist from New Jersey of the United States who established several anti-slavery newspapers and traveled widely. He lectured and published seeking to limit slavery&#x27;s expansion and tried to find a place outside the United States to establish a colony in which freed slaves might relocate.

As William Lloyd Garrison pointed out in a eulogy, Lundy was not the first American abolitionist, but &quot;he was the first of our countrymen who devoted his life and all his power exclusively to the cause of the slaves.&quot;

==Early and family life==
Lundy was born to Joseph and Elizabeth Shotwell Lundy, both Quakers, at Greensville, Hardwick Township, Sussex County, New Jersey. His mother died when he was four, but he became close to his stepmother, Mary Titus Lundy. As a boy, he worked on his father&#x27;s farm, attending school for only brief periods. In 1804, New Jersey passed a law allowing gradual emancipation of slaves, although the 1810 census in Sussex County showed that more than half of the 758 black people were still enslaved.

However, by that time, young Lundy had moved to Wheeling, Virginia (now in West Virginia). In 1808 he was apprenticed to a saddler. On the Ohio River, Wheeling was on important transit point of the interstate slave trade, with coffles of slaves often marched through town. Many would be shipped down the Ohio River toward Kentucky (a slave state) and additional slave states down the Mississippi River. In Wheeling, Lundy saw firsthand many iniquities inherent in the institution of slavery, including the use of horsewhips and bludgeons to force barefoot human beings to walk through mud and snow. He determined to devote his life to the cause of abolition.

Lundy also became acquainted with a local Quaker family, the Stantons, who lived a dozen miles west from Wheeling, in Mt. Pleasant, Ohio. Ohio did not permit slavery, and Benjamin Stanton would become a U.S. Congressman from that district, and two decades after Lundy&#x27;s death, his brother Edwin Stanton would become Secretary of War under President Abraham Lincoln.

In December 1814 Lundy and Esther Lewis declared their intent to marry in the local Quaker meeting, and did so on February 13, 1815. Her brother William married Lydia Stanton, sister of David Stanton (Edwin Stanton&#x27;s father). On November 18, 1815 they had their first child, Susan Maria Lundy Wierman (d. 1899). In the following decades, Esther bore two more sons, Charles Tallmadge Lundy (1821-1870) and Benjamin Clarkson Lundy (1826-1861), and two additional daughters, Elizabeth (1818-1879) and Esther (1826-1917).

==Career==
The young family settled in Saint Clairsville, Ohio, where Lundy soon built up a profitable saddlery business along the highway west (that later became Interstate 70). In 1815, he and five others also organized an anti-slavery association, known as the Union Humane Society, which within a few months had a membership of more than 500. Prominent members included lawyer journalist Charles Hammond, James Wilson (grandfather of President Woodrow Wilson) and Joseph Howells (father of William Dean Howells). Fellow Quaker Charles Osborne, who editing the &quot;Philanthropist&quot; (later moved to Cincinnati), also showed him journalism and printing basics.

On his birthday, January 4, 1816, Lundy published a circular indicating his intent to found a national anti-slavery society to focus antislavery sentiment and activity. That became his life&#x27;s work. He named his first son to honor James Tallmadge, whose antislavery speech in the U.S. House on February 16, 1819, Lundy printed in full.

===Missouri, Ohio, and Tennessee===
Lundy decided to liquidate his saddlery business in favor of a publishing business. He and three apprentices moved their stock to St. Louis, Missouri, then the center of a national slavery controversy. However, that area too was gripped by a national depression since the Panic of 1819. His side lost—Missouri was admitted as a slave state as a result of the Missouri Compromise of 1820.

The intrepid activist lost goods he valued at over $1000, then trudged 700 miles back to St. Clairville, only to find that Osborne had sold his printing business to Elisha Bates, who did not need additional help. Lundy then established his own anti-slavery paper, the &quot;Genius of Universal Emancipation&quot;, at Mount Pleasant, Ohio, with the first issue published in January 1821. This periodical, first a monthly and later a weekly, was published successively in Ohio, Greenville, Tennessee, Baltimore, Maryland, the District of Columbia and Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. It appeared irregularly, and at times, when Lundy was away on lecturing tours, was issued from any office that he could access. Newspapers including the &quot;Niles Weekly Register&quot;, the &quot;New York Spectator&quot; and papers from Connecticut and Edwardsville, Illinois reprinted Lundy&#x27;s exposés.

However, anti-slavery activism did not pay well, and slaveholders did not believe Lundy&#x27;s arguments that slavery stifled progress, despite his comparisons of the relative prosperity of New York and Pennsylvania with Virginia. Lundy had been recruited to Greenville, Tennessee to work against slavery in a slave state after the death of Elihu Embree, but he found the hostility formidable. Lundy used the equipment purchased from Embree&#x27;s estate to begin publishing the &quot;American Economist and Weekly Political Reporter&quot; with more standard farm prices, business and political news in 1822. He also continued to lecture against slavery, and in 1824 attended the American Convention for the Abolition of Slavery, in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, where he connected with other activists, including Robert Purvis. He also traveled to New York to meet with Quaker activist Elias Hicks and to lecture against slavery in North Carolina.

===Baltimore and the District of Columbia===
After selecting Baltimore to re-establish his business after deciding to move from Tennessee, Lundy moved his family to Maryland in October, 1825. This enabled Lundy to print his newspaper weekly instead of monthly or even less frequently. Lundy also published a biography of Harford County, Maryland, philanthropist and abolitionist Elisha Tyson, as well as a proposal for the gradual emancipation of slaves. In 1826, a slaveowner offered to free twelve slaves if Lundy would accompany them to Haiti. He did so, but found on his return that his wife Esther had died giving birth to twins, and his children were scattered among friends.

On January 9, 1827 Baltimore&#x27;s most notorious slave-trader, Austin Woolfolk, whom Lundy had been investigating in public records since his move to Baltimore and severely criticizing, assaulted Lundy as he walked along a downtown street. Head-kicks and other injuries until bystanders pulled the strapping Woolfolk off his slightly-built victim confined Lundy to his bed for several days. Woolfolk pleaded guilty to assault, but Judge Nicholas Brice agreed with Woolfolk&#x27;s lawyers that Lundy had provoked it by criticizing Woolfolk&#x27;s lawful occupation, and therefore sentenced the slave trader to a one-dollar fine and court costs. He also urged Woolfolk to bring criminal libel charges against Lundy, but a grand jury refused to indict him.

From September 1829 until March 1830, Wm. Lloyd Garrison assisted Lundy in editing the &quot;Genius&quot;. At this time, the paper was located in Baltimore. Both deplored slavery, but Garrison advocated immediate emancipation on American soil, while Lundy was committed to schemes of colonization abroad. Within a few months, while Lundy traveled in Mexico, Garrison published an exposé of an October slaving voyage of a ship owned by his former neighbor, Francis Todd of Newburyport, Massachusetts, in a deal brokered by Woolfolk. Garrison also published radical articles demanding immediate emancipation, and asserting that the domestic slave trade was as piratical as the foreign. His column the &quot;Black List&quot; detailing atrocities brought trouble, since Garrison was not as careful as Lundy had been at avoiding libels. In February 1830 Maryland charged Garrison with criminal libel, and Woolfolk&#x27;s ally Judge Brice sentenced Garrison to a fifty dollar fine plus court costs, and a six-month jail term if he did not pay. This so reduced the &quot;Genius&#x27;s&quot; circulation that a friendly dissolution of the partnership between Lundy and Garrison took place after Garrison finished his jail term (where he was treated as a political prisoner and dined with the warden and his wife, as well as wrote extensively). However, Garrison returned to Boston (where he suffered a mob attack in 1835), although Woolfolk&#x27;s trade also diminished, supplanted by Franklin &amp; Armfield of Alexandria (at the time in the District of Columbia). Lundy followed the trade, shortly afterwards moving his newspaper paper to Washington, D.C., where, after some years under different ownership, it failed.

===Haiti, Canada, Texas and Mexico—and Philadelphia===

Besides traveling through many states of the United States to deliver anti-slavery lectures (reportedly the first to do so), Lundy visited Haiti twice (in 1825 and 1829); the Wilberforce Colony of freedmen and refugee slaves in Canada in 1830-1831 (perhaps in part avoiding controversy after publishing about Nat Turner&#x27;s Rebellion); and Texas, in 1832 and again in 1833. Lundy also sought to find a suitable place outside the United States where emancipated slaves might be sent. Between 1820 and 1830, he traveled “more than 5000 miles on foot and 20,000 in other ways, visited 19 states of the Union, and held more than 200 public meetings.” Slaveholders bitterly denounced him, and many non-slaveholders disapproved his anti-slavery agitation.

In 1836-1838 Lundy edited a new anti-slavery weekly, &quot;The National Enquirer&quot;, which the Pennsylvania Anti-Slavery Society had founded in Philadelphia, as well as wrote extensively about the troubles in Texas and Mexico, especially as they related to slavery. Lundy became a leading voice in denouncing the Texas Revolution as a method to perpetuate slavery in Texas in defiance of Mexico&#x27;s ban on it. When former president John Quincy Adams came to Philadelphia on his birthday, July 11, 1836, Lundy escorted him to meet other Quakers, including James Mott and his wife Lucretia Mott. Under the editorship of John G. Whittier, Lundy&#x27;s successor, that paper became &quot;The Pennsylvania Freeman&quot;.

Lundy purchased a farm near the Clear Creek Meeting House (the westernmost establishment of the Hicksite Friends), as well as the new village of Lowell, Illinois. He printed several issues of the re-established &quot;Genius of Universal Emancipation&quot; on a borrowed press in nearly Hennepin, Illinois.

==Death and legacy==

Lundy died after an August fever and brief illness at his farm in Lowell, aged fifty. Shortly after his death, his family and friends in Philadelphia published his autobiographical &quot;Life Travels and Opinions of Benjamin Lundy.&quot; Lucretia Mott remembered him in her 1848 speech to the American Anti-Slavery Society in New York.

One hundred years later, a bronze plaque was dedicated to the pioneer abolitionist and placed at his gravesite. The tribute reads, &quot;It was his lot to struggle, for years almost alone, a solitary voice crying in the wilderness, and, amidst all, faithful to his one great purpose, the emancipation of the slaves.&quot;

His house in Mount Pleasant is a National Historic Landmark.

<text>Johan Edvard Lundström (1815–1888) was a Swedish industrialist and inventor who pioneered the commercial production of safety matches.

== Biography ==
Lundström was born in 1815 in the town of Jönköping, Sweden. 

In 1845 Lundström started to experiment with safety matches in a small workshop he had rented. The safety match had been invented by Gustaf Erik Pasch (1788–1862) in 1844, but was difficult to produce commercially. In 1846 his younger brother Carl Frans Lundström (1823–1917) joined his small workshop. In 1847 they were ready to set up a production plant and bought an estate on the coast of Lake Vättern where they built a large match factory. Today, their original factory is a museum.

The Lundström safety match got an award at the “World Exhibition” in Paris 1855. Alexander Lagerman (1836–1904), a Swedish engineer who was employed by the Lundström brothers, invented the first fully automatic match machine. The safety match combined with the advanced machines that the company developed themselves, soon made the company in Jönköping the largest match company in Scandinavia and one of the world&#x27;s largest match production companies.

Lundström left the match business in 1863. It was later renamed Jönköping, then in 1903 merged with other match companies to become Jönköpings Tändsticksfabriks AB, finally sold to Ivar Kreuger in 1917. Kreuger incorporated the business into the company Svenska Tändsticks AB, today known as Swedish Match.

Lundström worked at his cellulose factory, Munksjö Cellulose, in Jönköping that he had founded in 1862 together with Lars Johan Hierta. In 1869 he left the Munksjö factory and founded Katrinefors cellulose industry in Mariestad, but left that business in 1875. He then worked as a government inspector in the match industry between 1875–77 in Sweden and was to a great extent involved in the work to prevent and forbid the use of the dangerous white phosphorus. 

He died in 1888 at the age of 73, having never married.

<doc id="363469" wikidata="Q29896" url="?curid=363469" title="Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah I">
<text>Mir Qamar-ud-din Khan Siddiqi (11 August 16711 June 1748) also known as Chin Qilich Qamaruddin Khan, Nizam-ul-Mulk, Asaf Jah and Nizam I, was the first Nizam of Hyderabad.

He began his career during the reign of the Mughal emperor Aurangzeb, who made him a general. Following the death of Aurangzeb in 1707, Asaf Jah preferred to remain neutral, refusing to favour any one of Aurangzeb&#x27;s warring sons. When Aurangzeb&#x27;s third son Bahadur Shah ultimately emerged victorious, Asaf Jah was rotated as governor of multiple Mughal provinces until 1714, when he was appointed as Viceroy of the Deccan with authority over six Mughal provinces in southern India from 1714 to 1719. From 1719 onwards, he was involved in combating the intrigues of the Sayyid Brothers. From 1720 to 1722, he helped the new Mughal emperor Muhammad Shah in eliminating the Sayyid brothers and was elevated, as a reward, to the grand viziership from 1722 to 1724. 

Political intrigues compelled Asaf Jah to rebel against the emperor and in 1724 Muhammad Shah was forced to recognize Asaf Jah as the permanent Viceroy of the Deccan. Later that year Asaf Jah proclaimed himself Nizam and began the Asaf Jahi dynasty, with himself as its first ruler.

==Background==
Mir Qamar-ud-din Khan (also known as Nizam) was the son of Ghazi ud-Din Khan and Safiya Khanum, the daughter of Sa&#x27;dullah Khan. Sa&#x27;dullah Khan was the Grand Vizier (1645–1656) of Mughal Emperor Shah Jahan and during his tenure construction of Taj Mahal was completed. His paternal grandfather Kilich Khan hailed from Samarkand in present-day Uzbekistan. In 1654, Kilich Khan came to India for the first time while on his way to the &quot;Hajj&quot; (Islamic pilgrimage) during the reign of Mughal emperor Shah Jahan. After completing the pilgrimage, he migrated to India and joined erstwhile Mughal prince Aurangzeb&#x27;s army in Deccan in 1657. Khan fought in the Battle of Samugarh which ended with the defeat of Aurangzeb&#x27;s brother Dara Shikoh. Besides being a commander in Aurangzeb&#x27;s army, he also served as governor of Zafarabad (present-day Bidar). Khan&#x27;s eldest son and Nizam-ul-Mulk&#x27;s father Ghazi ud-Din Khan migrated to India in 1669, and got employed in Aurangzeb&#x27;s army, raised a General and later as governor of Gujarat. 

==Early life==
He was born on 11 August 1671 as Mir Qamaruddin Khan to Ghazi ud-Din Khan and his first wife Safia Khanum (Wazir-un-Nisa Begum) at Agra, the name was given to him by the Mughal Emperor Aurangazeb.

Mir Qamaruddin was educated privately. Due to his long residence in the Deccan, he adopted the flowing robes of the Marathas, tight in the waist, and made obeisance in the Deccan fashion. He wrote poetry in Urdu in the typical Deccani style of the age. In 1677 aged six, Mir Qumaruddin accompanied his father to the Mughal court. Aurangzeb awarded him a Mansab. Mir Qamaruddin displayed considerable skill as a warrior and in his teens he began accompanying his father into battles, for which Mir Qamaruddin Khan received a rank of 400 zaat and 100 Sowar in 1684. In 1688 aged 17 he joined his father in the successful assault on the fort of Adoni and was promoted to the rank of 2000 zaat and 500 Sowar and presented with the finest Arab steed with gold trappings and a pastille perfumed with ambergris from the Mughal court. In 1690 aged 19 he was bestowed with the title &quot;Chin Qilich Khan&quot; (boy swordsman) and was gifted with a female elephant by Aurangazeb. In 1693, the Marathas sieged the Panhala Fort. In response, Mir Qamaruddin fought and defeated the Marathas at Karad. 30 Marathas were taken as prisoners. In 1698, Aurangzeb sent Mir Qamaruddin to put down a revolt at Nagori, near Bijapur. The emperor was satisfied with his expedition and subsequently sent him to Kotha to restore order. Following his success, he was raised to a rank of 3,000 zaat and 500 Sowar. In 1699 Aurangzeb promoted him to 3,500 &quot;zaat&quot; and 3,000 Sowar. Mir Qamaruddin successfully sieged the Panhala Fort which was occupied by the Marathas. He closed all the roads as a result of which no supply could reach the inhabitants. The fort fell to his forces on 9 June 1700. Satisfied with his services, Aurangzeb made him the &quot;faujdar&quot; (garrison commander) of Bijapur and increased his rank by 400 &quot;Sowar&quot;.

==Career==

===Life After Aurangzeb===
The disintegration of the Mughal empire which Aurangzeb had well established, began upon Aurangzeb&#x27;s death in 1707. The Sayyid brothers-(Syed Hussain Ali Khan and Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha) became highly influential in the Mughal Court after Aurangzeb&#x27;s death and became king makers during the anarchy following the death of emperor Aurangzeb in 1707. They created conflict in the Mughal court by eliminating and appointing new emperor one after other. When Bahadur Shah I (1707-1712) died, his successor Jahandar Shah (1712-1713) was assassinated and his nephew Farrukhsiyar (1713–1719) became the emperor with the support of Sayyid brothers, Farrukhsiyar was later blinded, deposed and murdered and his first cousin Rafi ud-Darajat (February–June 1719) became Emperor and died of lung disease, when his elder brother Rafi ud-Daulah (June–September 1719) became Emperor who also died of lung disease, thus Muhammad Shah (1719–1748) the grandson of Bahadur Shah I from his fourth son Jahan Shah ascended the throne at the age of 17 years with Sayyid Brothers as his regents.

===Later Mughals and Asaf Jah===
After Aurangzeb died in 1707, Asaf Jah was appointed Governor of Oudh. After Bahadur Shah I&#x27;s death in 1712 Asaf Jah opted for a private life in Delhi. His sabbatical was cut short when in 1714 Farrukhsiyar appointed Asaf Jah I as Viceroy of the Deccan—(administrator of six Mughal governorates) with the title &quot;Nizam-ul-Mulk&quot; (Administrator of the Realm) and &quot;Fateh Jung&quot;. In 1719, Asaf Jah was then called upon by Farrukhsiyar to help fight off the Sayyid Brothers, Farrukhsiyar lost his strife against the Sayyid Brothers and was killed in 1719. In due course from 1719 to 1722, Asaf Jah I was on a mission to eradicate the Sayyid brothers from the Mughal court and to make this happen he organized and promoted Central Asian nobles in the Mughal court against the Sayyid brothers, in 1720 he captured the forts of Asirgarh and Burhanpur in Deccan and killed Mir Alam Ali Khan, the adopted son of Sayyid Hussain Ali Khan, who was the Deputy Subahdar of the Deccan. Muhammad Shah with the help of Asaf Jah, got Syed Hussain Ali Khan murdered in 1720 and Syed Hassan Ali Khan Barha poisoned in 1722, Muhammad Shah assumed an independent Mughal Emperor and as a reward in 1722, Asaf Jah was appointed as Grand Vazir (Prime Minister) of the Mughal Empire. As a Grand Vazir Asaf Jah&#x27;s attempts to reform the court corruption created for him many enemies. In 1723, Asaf Jah&#x27;s differences with the court noble increased and alarmed by his growing power, Muhammad Shah transferred him from the court of Delhi to Awadh. Nizam rebelled against the order, resigned as the Grand vizier left all imperial responsibilities and marched towards the Deccan by the end of the year 1723. Under the influence of Asaf Jah&#x27;s opponents, Muhammad Shah issued a decree to Mubariz Khan-the Governor of Hyderabad, to stop Asaf Jah which resulted in the Battle of Shakar Kheda. In 1724, Asaf Jah I defeated Mubariz Khan and in response the Mughal emperor recognized him as the viceroy of the Deccan.

===Governor of Bijapur===

Mir Qamar-ud-din became the &quot;subahdar&quot; (governor) of Bijapur in 1702 and was awarded a steed by Emperor Aurangzeb. In the same year, he was also given the &quot;faujdari&quot; of Azamnagar and Belgaum. In 1704, he became the &quot;faujdar&quot; of Nusratabad and Mudgal. In 1705 Mir Qamar-ud-din survived the attacks during the Siege of Wagingera Fort, and led an assault in the hillock of Lal Tikri. He attacked the Marathas who were attempting to provide supplies to the besieged inhabitants at Vardhangad Fort. The Marathas were ultimately defeated. Mir Qamar-ud-din was raised to a rank of 5,000 zaat and 5,000 &quot;Sowar&quot; for his performance in the siege. He was also awarded with a jewelled sabre and an elephant.

===Viceroy of the Deccan===

On 10 January 1713, Mughal prince Farrukhsiyar defeated Mughal Emperor Jahandar Shah in the Battle of Agra and later killed him, One of Mughal general Zulfiqar Khan Nusrat Jung aided and intrigues Jahandar Shah after the death of his father Bahadur Shah I in 1712 to overcame all his brothers-(including the battle in which Azim-ush-Shan the father of Farrukhsiyar was drowned in the Ravi River) and ascended the throne of Mughal Emperor, in return, Zulfiqar Khan was made Grand vizier, &quot;Amir-ul-Umara&quot; and Viceroy of the Deccan all at once. Zulfiqar Khan was captured and strangled to death in 1713 AD with the orders of Farrukhsiyar.

In 1713 Farrukhsiyar appointed Mir Qamaruddin as Viceroy of the Deccan—(administrator of six Mughal governorates) and Faujdar of Carnatic region with the title &quot;Nizam-ul-Mulk&quot; (Administrator of the Realm) and &quot;Fateh Jung&quot; (Conqueror of battles). He was a competent diplomatic person and accomplished his responsibilities very well, he eventually organized the administration, augmented finances and obtained full control over the Deccan including Carnatic region, the Nizam abrogated Maratha&#x27;s from collecting Chauth in the region under his control which was granted by his predecessors. Nizam had been with Aurangzeb throughout his Deccan campaign. He was aware of the territory as well as the native communities for which he avoided confrontation with the Marathas and locals, rather he reduced the growing influence of Marathas in Deccan by bringing Sambhaji II of Kolhapur to his side and appointing the rival Maratha generals (Maratha generals, Candrasen Jadhav, Sultanji Nimbalkar and Raja Ramabha Rao Bahadur) under his services. In 1715 AD, Farrukhsiyar under the influence of Sayyed brothers, call back Nizam to Delhi, and replaced Syed Hussain Ali Khan (one among the Sayyed brothers) as the viceroy of Deccan.

===Governor of Malwa-challenges-restoring Emperor===

The Sayyid brothers, known as the &quot;badshahgar&quot;(king-makers), became the sole authority of Mughal court reducing the status of the Turkic and the Irani noblemen. As a result, they formed a force of counter-revolution against the Sayyid brothers. The head of the Counter-Revolution was Nizam. To subdue the counter-revolution, the Sayyid brothers shifted Nizam-ul-mulk from Delhi. In 1715 AD, the Nizam was appointed as the Governor of Malwa-(central India), a lesser position than the previous post. in 1716 AD Nizam unwillingly accepted the new post so that he could reinforce his forces against the Sayyid brothers and check and halt the increasing influence of Marathas in the central India region.

In 1719, Nizam became suspicious of the machination of the Sayyed brothers and understood their intentions to take over the Mughal Empire. When two of the Mughal Emperors died simultaneously within a year due to the same ailment and Muhammad Shah the 18-year-old Mughal prince was appointed Mughal Emperor and Sayyid Brothers as regent to the Mughal Emperor, the Nizam commence full-fledged preparation to launch an armed action against them. When the Sayyid Brothers learned about the Nizam&#x27;s situation, they got furious and issued an imperial order asking the Nizam to report to Delhi. Alternately they planned an attack on Nizam in case he did not report. Meanwhile, Nizam received a secret communication from the Mughal empress&#x27;s mother &quot;Resist the Sayyids, and you will find yourself a place of Honor in the history of Mughals, May Allah help you in a war of righteousness against suppression&quot;, and later a secret communication was sent by Emperor Muhammad Shah to get him relief from the atrocities of Sayyid Brothers. Nizam was convinced of the Sayyid Brothers&#x27; planning and refused to report to Delhi and decided to eliminate the Sayyid brothers.

In Delhi, the Sayyid brothers released an imperial order to attack Nizam&#x27;s forces from two fronts, thus dispatched a 20,000 imperial army of Delhi led by Dilawar Khan to attack from the North and the Army of Governor of Aurangabad led by Alim Ali-(the adopted son of Syed Hussain Ali Khan) to attack from South. Nizam being a military strategist rather than marching towards Delhi decided to move southwards to the Deccan where he had many sympathizers to support. The Nizam utilizing his diplomatic manipulation occupied Asirgarh Fort from Mughals and left Ujjain towards Burhanpur. His army clashed with Dilawar Khan aided by Maratha reinforcement near Burhanpur (Khandwa) in June 1720, Dilawar Khan and Marathas were defeated and Nizam took over Burhanpur. Sayyed brothers hopeless with the battle result issued an imperial order appointing Nizam as Viceroy of Deccan.

Mughal empress&#x27;s mother alarmed Nizam that &quot;Plans are already being made to mount a strong invasion of the south, be on your guard&quot; Meanwhile Sayyed brothers ordered Alim Ali-(Uninformed by Sayyed brothers about Nizam&#x27;s appointment as Viceroy of Deccan) to march towards Nizam and stop him from reaching Aurangabad. Nizam wanted to avoid any war against a 20-year-old Alim Ali and sent his envoy, but all his efforts to avoid war went in vain when in July 1720 AD Alim Ali approached with his army, though Alim Ali fought with bravery he lost against Nizam well-equipped army. Frustrated with the defeat of Alim Ali, the Sayyed brothers now decided to attack with a much larger imperial army of 50,000 led by Emperor Muhammad Shah, they decided to move towards the south by collecting reinforcement from Rajputana. While the Mughal army was encamped in the outskirts of Delhi, a plot was devised against the Sayyid brothers and a section of Nizam&#x27;s sympathizers a Turcic soldier assassinated the commander and chief of the Mughal Army Sayyid Hussain (one of Sayyed Brothers) on 9 October 1720. When Abdullah Khan was informed about the death of his brother, he became furious and marched towards Delhi from Agra to avenge his brother&#x27;s murder, he led an army against the Emperor Muhammad Shah with his own puppet Emperor, Ibrahim. Muhammad Shah assigned Nizam&#x27;s uncle and sympathizer Muhammad Amin Khan Turani to march towards Agara to deal with Abdullah Khan, the battle was fought near Hasanpur, and most of Abdullah Khan army deserted him, Abdullah Khan personally fought on foot following the Barha tradition and was captured in November 1720, and eventually being poisoned while in captivity. Muhammad Shah was crowned Emperor without any regent and Muhammad Amin Khan Turani was appointed as first Grand vizier. Nizam choose to continued his stay in Deccan and when Muhammad Amin Khan Turani died in 1721, he was offered to be Grand vizier of Mughal Empire.

===Grand Vizier of Mughal Empire===

In 1721 AD, Nizam ul-Mulk was rewarded for eliminating the Sayyid Brothers with the post of &quot;Wakil E Mutlaq&quot; Grand vizier in the court of Muhammad Shah, the 18-year-old successor. From Muhammad Shah&#x27;s point of view, he expected Asaf Jah I to act as an elderly statesman and faithful servant of the emperor, but the cunning Asaf Jah proved to be more self-willed and attempted to use his influence with the emperor to increase his territorial ambitions in the Deccan. With the pretext of restoring law and order in Gujarat, he sent there an expedition and appointed his maternal uncle, the relative of Saadullah Khan (سعد الله خان) named Hamid Khan, to administer Gujarat. Hamid Khan engaged Shujaat Khan Gujarati in battle and shot him with an arrow in the chest while on top of his elephant, and finally entered Ahmedabad as a conqueror. Shujaat Khan Gujarati&#x27;s brother, Rustam Ali Khan, who had advanced towards Ahmedabad was also defeated with the aid of two Maratha commanders. Muhammad Shah sent Sarbuland Khan to punish Hamid Khan. As Sarbuland Khan opposed this mission, with his request Muhammad Shah released Sayyid Najmuddin Ali Khan Barha from prison to join his imperial army, with the reward of the governorship of Ajmer. Although a large number of Sarbuland Khan&#x27;s men fell, in the heat of battle Shaikh Allahyar Khan delivered the victory to the imperialists. Both Hamid Khan and the Marathas suffered heavy losses. As a result, Hamid Khan departed to Aurangabad in the Deccan. Thus the Nizam failed to win the confidence of the Emperor and lost in the estimation of the nobles. For the Nizam, his desire to restore the decorum of Mughals lapsed when some courtiers, cliques of corrupt concubines and eunuchs along with harlots and jesters who were the Emperor&#x27;s constant companions became Nizam&#x27;s enemy and coercively built distrust in the mind of Emperor about Nizam&#x27;s growing power, thou Muhammad Shah had been dependent entirely upon the policies and courage of the Nizam, he transferred him from the court of Delhi to Awadh in 1723 AD. Muhammad Shah was young and foolish and allowed his confidants to make remarks about him when he had made his obeisance in the Deccan fashion, which created a grudge between them. His efforts were misrepresented and thwarted by the nobles close to the Emperor. Nizam rebelled against the imperial order, abdicated as the Grand Vizier and marched towards the Deccan against the will of Mughal Emperor Muhammad Shah. Under the influence of Nizam&#x27;s opponents, Muhammad Shah issued a decree to Mubariz Khan-the Governor of Hyderabad, and a former ally of the Barha Sayyids, to stop and kill the Nizam which resulted in the Battle of Shakar Kheda. In 1724, with the help of the Marathas, Asaf Jah I defeated Mubariz Khan and in response, the Mughal emperor was forced to recognize him as the viceroy of the Deccan with the title of Asaf Jah.

===Nizam of Hyderabad===

On 11 October 1724, the Nizam established autonomous rule over the &quot;Deccan region&quot; and started what came to be known as the Asaf Jahi dynasty. Subsequent rulers retained the title &quot;Nizam ul-Mulk&quot; and were referred to as Asaf Jahi Nizams, or Nizams of Hyderabad. Nizam remained loyal to the Mughal Emperor, did not assume any imperial title, and continued to acknowledge Mughal suzerainty. He acquired &quot;de facto&quot; control over Deccan and thus all six Mughal viceregal governorates of Deccan became his feudatory.

In 1725 AD, as a sovereign ruler, the Nizam wanted to strengthening the Deccan by controlling the growing influence of the Marathas, he confronted and defeated Maratha forces and prevented them from collecting levies in Carnatic region—(it was granted to Marathas by his predecessor Mughal Viceroy of Deccan in 1719 AD). In 1726 AD Sambhaji II of Kolhapur sought the Nizam&#x27;s arbitration to settle issues with Shahu I of Satara which Shahu declined, thus in 1727 AD the Nizam armies captured Pune and appointed Sambhaji II as Chhatrapati. These valorous acts of the Nizam started an extended series of conflicts with Shahu who used a Guerrilla warfare technique led by his Peshwa Baji Rao I, which resulted in the Battle of Palkhed in 1728 AD, Sambhaji II repudiate at the last moment and the Shahu forces surrounded the Nizam, he sign the treaty with Shahu which restored him as a Chhatrapati of Marathas and the right to collect levies in the Carnatic region.

1733 AD the Nizam and Baji Rao had made a compact to support each other in times of external attacks, in 1734 The Marathas attacked and captured Bundelkhand and Malwa from the Mughal control, and in exchange for these territories the Mughal emperor gave them the right to collect levies from Deccan, to which the nizam refused and the secret compact among both was broken. in 1737 AD when Maratha forces gathered in Delhi, Nizam marched against Maraths from Deccan to stop the invasion thus Marathas withdraw from Delhi and with the help of Nawab of Bhopal, they make a counterattack on Nizam&#x27;s armies which resulted in the Battle of Bhopal, later in January 1738, a peace treaty was signed between both the parties and withdraw to their regions.

The Nizam divided his newly acquired kingdom into three parts. One-third became his private estate known as the Sarf-i-Khas, one-third was allotted for the expenses of the government and was known as Diwan&#x27;s territory, and the remainder was distributed to nobles (Jagirdar, Zamindars, Deshmukh), who in return paid Mazars (gifts) to the Nizam for the privilege of collecting revenue from the villages under their suzerainty. The most important of these were the Paigah estates. The House of Paigah doubled up as generals, Nawab Abu&#x27;l Fateh Khan who served as general of the nizams, the paigah&#x27;s making it easy to raise an army should the Nizams Dominions come under attack. They were the equivalent to the Barmakids for the Abbasid Caliphate. Only second to the Nizam&#x27;s family.

====War against the Marathas====

The Nizam wrote some advice for his successors in the Ma&#x27;asir-i Nizami: 

&quot;It is necessary for the ruler of the Deccan who desires his safety, peace from war, and the prosperity of his country to have peace with the Marathas who are the landholders[zamindaran] of this region.&quot;

In 1725, the Marathas clashed with the Nizam, who refused to pay Chauth and Sardeshmukhi to the Marathas. The war began in August 1727 and ended in March 1728. Nizam signed a treaty named Treaty of Mungi-Shevgaon at Shevgaon near Nashik by Bajirao I, the son of Peshwa Balaji Vishwanath Bhatt.

====Maratha Treaty====

Anxious to divert Marathas away from his Deccan strongholds, and to save himself from the Mughal emperor of North India&#x27;s hostile attempts to suppress his independence, The Nizam encouraged the Marathas to invade Malwa and the northern Indian territories of the Mughal empire. The Nizam says that he could use the Marathas to his advantage in the Maasir-i Nizami: 

&quot;I consider all this army (Marathas) as my own and I will get my work done through them. It is necessary to take our hands off Malwa. God willing, I will enter into an understanding with them and entrust the Mulukgiri(raiding) on that side of the Narmada to them.&quot;
==Nader Shah==

In 1739, from beyond the Hindu Kush, Nader Shah started advancing towards Delhi through Afghanistan and the Punjab.

Nizam ul-Mulk sent his troops to Karnal, where Mughal Emperor Muhammed Shah&#x27;s forces had gathered to turn back the Persian army. Influenced by suspicions of the Hindustani party, Muhammad Shah refused to give command of the army to the Nizam, which was given instead to the commander-in-chief, Khan-i Dauran. The combined forces of Muhammad Shah and the Nizam were cannon fodder for the Persian cavalry and was defeated by Nader Shah&#x27;s superior weaponry and tactics. The Nizam remained inert with a third of the army during the battle, likely hoping to take the places of his rivals at court. He watched the battle passively without participation, as he believed it was futile to wage war against such a formidable foe rather than save himself and his men. He told the messenger sent by Muhammad Shah:
&quot;Whatever the king likes, he is free to speak and make orders, but he does not understand the art of warfare. The stupid fellows went to launch a campaign without order and discipline, and by their folly destroyed a force of 40,000...The king is angry with me for not carrying out his commands. The reality is they did not listen to my advice.&quot;
Nader Shah entered Delhi and stationed his troops there. Some locals of Delhi quarrelled and attacked his soldiers. After nine hundred of his soldiers were killed in a bazaar brawl, Nader Shah flew into a rage, drew out his sword from the scabbard and ordered a massacre. Muhammad Shah was unable to prevent Delhi from being destroyed. When Nader Shah ordered the massacre in Delhi, neither the helpless Mughal Emperor Muhammed Shah nor any of his Ministers dared to speak to Nader Shah and negotiate a truce. Asaf Jah came forward and risked his life by going to Nader Shah and asking him to end the bloodbath of the city. Legend has it that Asaf Jah said to Nader Shah &quot;You have taken the lives of thousands of people of the city, if you still wish to continue the bloodshed, then bring those dead back to life and then kill them again, for there are none left to be killed.&quot; These words had a tremendous impact on Nader Shah – he ended the massacre on condition and returned to Persia.

==Later life==

The Nizam was well suited to rule his territory. The administration was under control.

In March 1742, the British who were based in Fort St George in Madras sent a modest hamper to Nizam ul-mulk in recognition of his leadership of the most important of the Mughal successor states. Its contents included a gold throne, gold and silver threaded silk from Europe, two pairs of large painted-looking glasses, equipage for coffee cups, 163.75 yards of green and 73.5 yards of crimson velvet, brocades, Persian carpets, a gold ceremonial cloth, two Arab horses, half a dozen ornate rose-water bottles and 39.75 chests of rose water – enough to keep the Nizam and his entire Darbar fragrant for the rest of his reign. In return, the Nizam sent one horse, a piece of jewellery and a note warning the British that they had no right to mint their currency, to which they complied.

It was after Nizam ul-mulk&#x27;s death that his son and grandson sought help from the British and French to win the throne. Just days before he died in 1748, Asaf Jah dictated his last will.
The 17-clause document was a blueprint for governance and personal conduct that ranged from advice on how to keep the troops happy and well-fed to an apology for neglecting his wife.
He then reminded his successors to remain subservient to the Mughal Emperor who had granted them their office and rank. He warned against declaring war unnecessarily, but if forced to do so to seek the help of elders and saints and follow the sayings and practices of the Prophet. Finally, he insisted to his sons that &quot;you must not lend your ears to tittle-tattle of the backbiters and slanderers, nor suffer the riffraff to approach your presence.&quot;

==Legacy==

Nizam-ul-Mulk is remembered as laying the foundation for what would become one of the most important Muslim states outside the Middle East by the first half of the twentieth century. Hyderabad State survived right through the period of British rule up to the time of Indian independence in 1947, and was indeed the largest – the state covered an extensive 95,337 sq. miles, an area larger than Mysore or Gwalior and the size of Nepal and Kashmir put together (although it was the size of France when the first Nizam held reign) – and one of the most prosperous, among the princely states of the British Raj.
The titles of &quot;Nizam Ul Mulk&quot; and &quot;Asaf Jah&quot; that were bestowed on him by the Mughal Emperors, carried his legacy as his descendants ruled under the title of &quot; Nizam of Hyderabad&quot; and the dynasty itself came to be known as the Asaf Jahi Dynasty.

In early 1710, while being as Subedar of Awadh, he was very much disturbed by the Mughal Emperor court politics and crafty cliques present inside the court, that he resigned from Subedar of Awadh and left to live a life of Fakir.

==Personal life==
Asaf Jah was married to Said-un-Nisa Begum, who belonged to a Sayed family from Gulbargah. From this marriage he had four children, two daughters; one of them being Khair-un-Nisa Begum and two sons; Ghazi-ud-din Feroz Jung and Nasir Jung (later nizam). From other wives he had four more sons; Salabat Jung (later Nizam), Nizam Ali Khan (later Nizam), Basalat Jung, and Mogal Ali Khan. He had two more daughters, Mukarrama Banu Begum also known as Kali Begum, who was married to Qiyam-ul-Mulk, the Qiladar of Bidar and Kalyani, and with whom she had a daughter, who married the son of Najm-ud-Daulah in 1766; and Khan Bahadur Begum, who died on 20 November 1788, and was buried in Makkah Masjid, Hyderabad.

As per the 1749 British records of Fort St. George, Nizam-ul-Mulk even thought about installing his favourite daughter Khair-un-Nisa Begum&#x27;s son (i.e. Muzaffar Jung) when he was dissatisfied with the conduct of Nasir Jung. He gave up that idea due to possible serious repercussions and reconciled with Nasir Jung. He recommended bestowing the Circars of Adoni and Raichur to Muzaffar Jung with acceptance of the Padishah.

Nasir Jung being Nizam-ul-Mulk&#x27;s son (i.e. have some claim to the &quot;Deccan Subah&quot;) and Muzaffar Jung being his favourite grandson lead the succession of one of the most important Subahs of Mughal empire into a severe crisis with was well exploited first by the French and then by British.

After defeating Nasir Jung with the help of the French, Muzaffar Jung indeed became Nizam later, but for a very short period. Interestingly, Muzaffar Jung being favourite grandson of Asaf Jah I, was the only thing that hesitated Nasir Jung about executing him, when he was imprisoned during the Second Carnatic War. Unexpected sudden death of Muzaffar Jung lead his uncle Salabat Jung (i.e. younger brother of Nazir Jung) to be installed as the new Nizam who was deposed by his younger brother Nizam Ali Khan with the help of British and Marathas.

The succession feud between Nasir Jung and Muzaffar Jung was one of the most pivotal events in Indian history that led to the interference of European powers. This led to the emergence of Robert Clive and the ultimate domination of the British in the Indian peninsula in the later years. Irony was that Both Nasir Jung and Muzaffar Jung died due to the betrayal of Pathan Nawabs (i.e. Faujdars) of the circars of Kurnool, Kadapa and Savanur.

==Death==

Due to continuous engagement in restoring internal conflicts and resolving increasing threats of neighbouring Marathas, he was engaged in an extensive tour of his domain. During this tour, in May 1748, he arrived in Burhanpur, he caught a cold and flu that deteriorated his health. Realizing death upon him, the Nizam dictated his last testament (wasiyyatnama), spanning 17 clauses in the presence of his available family members and close confidants. He died on 1 June 1748 aged 77 at Burhanpur and was buried at &quot;mazaar&quot; of Shaikh Burhan ud-din Gharib Chisti, Khuldabad, near Aurangabad, the place where Nizam&#x27;s mentor Aurangazeb is also buried.

The death of Asaf Jah I in 1748 resulted in a period of political unrest as his sons and grandson—Nasir Jung (1748–1750), Muzaffar Jang (1750-1751) and Salabat Jung (1751-1762)—contended for the throne backed by opportunistic neighbouring states and colonial foreign forces. The accession of Asaf Jah II, who reigned from 1762 to 1803, ended the instability. In 1768 he signed the Treaty of Masulipatam, surrendering the coastal region to the East India Company in return for a fixed annual rent.

<text>Max Havelaar; or, The Coffee Auctions of the Dutch Trading Company () is an 1860 novel by Multatuli (the pen name of Eduard Douwes Dekker), which played a key role in shaping and modifying Dutch colonial policy in the Dutch East Indies in the nineteenth and early twentieth century. In the novel, the protagonist, Max Havelaar, tries to battle against a corrupt government system in Java, which was then a Dutch colony. The novel&#x27;s opening line is famous: &quot;Ik ben makelaar in koffie, en woon op de Lauriergracht, Nº 37.&quot; (&quot;I am a coffee broker, and live on the Lauriergracht, Nº 37.&quot;). 

== Background ==

By the mid-nineteenth century, the colonial control of the Dutch East Indies (present-day Indonesia) had passed from the Dutch East India Company (VOC) to the Dutch government due to the economic failure of the VOC. In order to increase revenue, the Dutch colonial government implemented a series of policies termed the Cultivation System (Dutch: &quot;cultuurstelsel&quot;), which mandated Indonesian farmers to grow a quota of commercial crops such as sugar and coffee, instead of growing staple foods such as rice. At the same time, the colonial government also implemented a tax collection system in which the collecting agents were paid by commission. The combination of these two strategies caused widespread abuse of colonial power, especially on the islands of Java and Sumatra, resulting in abject poverty and widespread starvation of the farmers. The colony was governed with a minimum of soldiers and government officials. The former rulers maintained their absolute power and control over the natives: a quite common strategy used by many colonising countries.
In addition, the Dutch state earned a fortune with the sale of opium to the natives, a practice begun centuries earlier under VOC rule. At that time, opium was the only known effective pain killer, and a considerable percentage of the natives were addicted to it, being kept poor in this way. This was called the &quot;opium-regime&quot;. To distinguish between smuggled and legal opium, a simple reagent was added. After discovery the smuggler could count on a severe punishment.

Multatuli wrote &quot;Max Havelaar&quot; in protest against these colonial policies, but another goal was to seek rehabilitation for his resignation from governmental service. Despite its terse writing style, it raised the awareness of Europeans living in Europe at the time that the wealth that they enjoyed was the result of suffering in other parts of the world. This awareness eventually formed the motivation for the new Ethical Policy by which the Dutch colonial government attempted to &quot;repay&quot; their debt to their colonial subjects by providing education to some classes of natives, generally members of the elite loyal to the colonial government.

Indonesian novelist Pramoedya Ananta Toer argued that by triggering these educational reforms, &quot;Max Havelaar&quot; was in turn responsible for the nationalist movement that ended Dutch colonialism in Indonesia after 1945, and which was instrumental in the call for decolonization in Africa and elsewhere in the world. Thus, according to Pramoedya, &quot;Max Havelaar&quot; is &quot;the book that killed colonialism&quot;.

In the last chapter the author announces that he will translate the book &quot;into the few languages I know, and into the many languages I can learn.&quot; In fact, &quot;Max Havelaar&quot; has been translated into thirty-four languages. It was first translated into English in 1868. In Indonesia, the novel was cited as an inspiration by Sukarno and other early nationalist leaders, such as the author&#x27;s Indo (Eurasian) descendant Ernest Douwes Dekker, who had read it in its original Dutch. It was not translated into Indonesian until 1972.

In the novel, the story of Max Havelaar, a Dutch colonial administrator, is told by two diametrically opposed characters: the hypocritical coffee merchant Batavus Droogstoppel, who intends to use Havelaar&#x27;s manuscripts to write about the coffee trade, and the romantic German apprentice Stern, who takes over when Droogstoppel loses interest in the story. The opening chapter of the book nicely sets the tone of the satirical nature of what is to follow, with Droogstoppel articulating his pompous and mercenary world-view at length. At the very end of the novel Multatuli himself takes the pen and the book culminates in a denunciation of Dutch colonial policies and a plea to king William III of the Netherlands to intervene on behalf of his Indonesian subjects.

== Plot ==
(This summary seems to be based on the film adaptation, not the book as originally published)
By the 1860, lived a small boy from a farmer&#x27;s family in Parang Koedjang, Lebak Regency in the Dutch East Indies (present day Indonesia) named Säidjah. He is playing with his &quot;kerbau&quot; (farming buffalo) in &quot;sawah&quot; when his father and elder brother is farming with a small group of farmers. Suddenly, a Javan tiger attacks his &quot;kerbau&quot;, yet his &quot;kerbau&quot; managed to survive, and even kills the Javan tiger. The farmers names his &quot;kerbau&quot; as &quot;Pantang&quot; (Malay word for &quot;tough&quot;). Not long after that, the group of the &quot;Demang&quot; (chief district) of Parang Koedjang, Raden Wira Koesoema, came to them on horseback. He warns them to pay tribute to the Regent (&quot;Boepati&quot;) because the Regent is displeased. But the farmers do not have money to be collected as tribute, so &quot;Demang&quot; then seized &quot;Pantang&quot; from them. Säidjah&#x27;s elder brother tries to fight against the &quot;Demang&quot;, but he is shot dead by a KNIL soldier. His lifeless body is left lying down with nobody caring for the deceased brother. Contrary with Amsterdam in the same year, a Christmas night service is held at the church and the Priest preaches about the wealth and prosperity in Java, the Dutch colony, without knowing there is abuses and oppressions in that colony. That sermon is attended by Max Havelaar, an ex-Assistant Resident of Manado and Lebak who resigned from this official charges and becomes unemployed in Amsterdam. Havelaar then meets Batavus Droogstoppel, his childhood friend who becomes coffee broker and also owning coffee trading company, Last &amp; Co. Havelaar offers Droogstoppel some help, with him writing a book about coffee trading from Havelaar&#x27;s essays which was collected when he was in service as Assistant Resident. Droogstoppel helps him forcefully and tries to read it. Then, Droogstoppel accidentally reads one of Havelaar&#x27;s essay called &quot;On the Coffee Auctions of the Dutch Trading Company&quot; (Dutch title: &quot;Op de Koffi-veilingen der Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappij&quot;). And the Havelaar&#x27;s story of colonialism injustice and corruption is just began in Lebak by the 1855.

In 1855, Christiaan Ernst Pierre (C.E.P.) Carolus a.k.a. Slotering, the Assistant Resident of Lebak, is poisoned to death by the Regent of Lebak, Raden Adipati Karta Nata Negara, after attending at the night house banquet invitation by the Regent. The reason is unclear, probably because Slotering has secret papers about the Regent&#x27;s crimes and abuses in Lebak. But the doctor reports his death cause due to lever acute, so that Slotering&#x27;s death seems to be already known and kept secret by the Resident of Bantam, C.P. Brest van Kempen a.k.a. Slijmering, which has involved in a conspiracy to Slotering&#x27;s murder with the Regent. But nobody knows about this scandal, including the Gouverneur-Generaal of the Dutch East Indies. The Gouverneur-Generaal is recommended by his aide to install Max Havelaar, the Assistant-Resident of Manado, as the successor of Slotering. His aide is Havelaar&#x27;s brother-in-law. The Gouverneur-Generaal agrees with his aide&#x27;s recommendation. Havelaar is inaugurated in Gouverneur-Generaal&#x27;s palace in Buitenzorg and departs to Lebak in the next day with his controller names Verbrugge. As formally usual, Havelaar is greeted warmly by the Regent and his &quot;Demangs&quot;. In the next day, he is ceremonially taken oath by Slijmering in the Regency royal house. Everything goes well in the few days after that ceremony, until &quot;Djaksa&quot; (local police chief) tells him about Slotering&#x27;s secret papers which has been saved by &quot;Djaksa&quot;. At first, Havelaar tries to ignore what is happened in the past, yet he keeps to maintain his feudal relationship with the Regent, Raden Adipati, as the highest local ruler in Lebak. Havelaar visits the Regency to make a speech which essentially states that he wants everything goes fine and no violation under during his term of office. The Regent requests an advance of remaining tax extra payments from Assistant Residents. Havelaar grants his request even though there is no budget to that payment. Havelaar&#x27;s wife names Tine a.k.a. &quot;Pussy&quot; (Dutch: &quot;Poesje&quot;) feels objected to Havelaar&#x27;s decision, but Havelaar convinces &quot;Poesje&quot; that he will pay the Regent from his personal savings. Havelaar believes, if the Regent has no lack of money, the Regent will stop robbing his people. But Havelaar&#x27;s hope is in vain. He caught the Regent was doing abuse, from a simple thing to the serious violation. He finds some &quot;sawahs&quot; abandoned because all men in some villages are forcedly working to pull the grass and clean the Regent&#x27;s houseyard. In another day, he also finds some men is working to build &quot;aloen-aloen&quot; without paid in preparation for welcoming the Regent&#x27;s royal guests, the Regent of Bandoeng and Tjändjoer.

One day, Havelaar meets Säidjah and his father walking nearby the &quot;sawahs&quot;. Havelaar asks him where he was going and why he was not ploughing in &quot;sawah&quot;. Säidjah&#x27;s father answered that he is going to barter his heirloom kris dagger with a new &quot;kerbau&quot;. Havelaar then asks when his &quot;kerbau&quot; death, before or after his speech to the chiefs of Lebak. Säidjah&#x27;s father answered dishonestly that his &quot;kerbau&quot; is just dead. Havelaar thinks it is just normal. But in the few weeks when he makes a visit to Säidjah&#x27;s village, he finds the &quot;Demang&quot; of Parang Koedjang with his group was collecting &quot;kerbaus&quot;. Havelaar suspects the &quot;Demang&quot; is plundering the &quot;kerbaus&quot; to be served as the banquet for the Regent&#x27;s royal guests visit, the Regent of Bandoeng and Tjändjoer. The &quot;Demang&quot; tries to convince Havelaar that he buys &quot;kerbaus&quot; from the villagers, not to plunder. Havelaar then interrogates Säidjah&#x27;s father to confront it with the &quot;Demang&quot;, and wonders why he sold his &quot;kerbau&quot; while he were barter his heirloom kris to get a new &quot;kerbau&quot;. Säidjah&#x27;s father keeps silent because he is afraid of the &quot;Demang&quot;. Havelaar becomes upset to realize that the people were more afraid of the &quot;Demang&quot; than himself as Assistant Resident. He immediately left the village back home to write a report about this situation to the Resident of Bantam. Otherwise, the &quot;Demang&quot; is angry with the villagers and takes away all the &quot;kerbaus&quot;. The &quot;Demang&quot; also burns the only Säidjah and his father&#x27;s clothes so that they are cold at night. Säidjah&#x27;s father falls in fever at night and dies. Säidjah with an angry feeling comes before the &quot;Djaksa&quot;. They visit Havelaar&#x27;s house together to report what really happens. Säidjah brings his &quot;kerbau&quot;&#x27;s head as the evidence of &quot;kerbau&quot; looting by the Regent. Havelaar prepares to collect witnesses about the allegations of the Regent&#x27;s criminal act. Havelaar attempts to bring this allegations to the court. But Säidjah refuses it because he doubts the court and feels that every colonial high-rank officials are the same as the Regent. Although Havelaar tries to convince Säidjah, Säidjah insists to run away to Lampong joining with the rebels there.

At the aftermath, Säidjah is dead in Lampong killed by KNIL army in a rebellion battle. Havelaar&#x27;s indictment to the criminal court is blocked by the Resident, Slijmering. Slijmering warns Havelaar that if Havelaar keeps to blow up this incident, Slijmering threatened to revoke Havelaar from his position as Assistant Resident. When Havelaar finds out that he is not supported by the Resident, Havelaar decides to propose the indictment against the Regent by himself. But the court finally wins the Regent, the judge sentenced the Regent to be innocent and there was not enough evidence that he was guilty. The court even decided that Havelaar is &quot;promoted&quot; to serve as the Assistant Resident of Ngawi. Havelaar sees the justice in colonial is corrupted, and he finally resigns from his position as Assistant Resident. He also tries to discuss this case personally to the Gouverneur-Generaal. He brings &quot;Poesje&quot; and his son to Buitenzorg, and come to visit the Gouverneur-Generaal&#x27;s palace. When he arrived there, his brother-in-law, who served as the Gouverneur-Generaal&#x27;s aide, locks Havelaar in a room and told him to be silent and go home to the Netherlands. At last, Havelaar is full angry with the corruption of the Dutch colonial system, and shouting a wall-picture of the King William III that the King must take responsibility of this immoral corruption in his colonial system.

==Film version==
A film adaptation of the novel was released in 1976, directed by Fons Rademakers as part of a Dutch-Indonesian partnership. The film &quot;Max Havelaar&quot; was not allowed to be shown in Indonesia until 1987.

==Editions==

The edition history of the book &quot;Max Havelaar&quot; began in the 1860s with a publication titled &quot;Max Havelaar, of De koffi-veilingen der Nederlandsche Handel-Maatschappy&quot;. During his life Dekker published six press-editions of Max Havelaar in the Netherlands, with three different publishers. In addition, Dekker made a significant contribution to the first translation of the book into English. After Dekker&#x27;s death, the book was reprinted many times. The text and reprints that are found in bookstores today is sometimes based on the 4th edition from 1875, sometimes on the handwritten manuscript (also called the 0th edition), and increasingly on the fifth edition of 1881, the last to be revised by the author.
* 17 May 1860: the first edition: publishing house J. de Ruyter in Amsterdam. Three days earlier, on 14 May, the book had already been made available. This edition of 1300 copies was on large octavo printed by Munster and sons. There were two parts, of 212 and 185 pages. The books were sold for four guilders, a large amount for the time.

* 1860: second edition: J. de Ruyter, Amsterdam. The appearance of the book and typography did not differ from the first edition. The page layout and all lines were identical, so it seemed that it was printed from the same type used for the first edition. The book appeared again in two parts: the first part on 8 November 1860, the second part on 22 November. The exact size of the edition is unknown, but was probably between 700 and 1200 copies. The price for both parts was again four guilders.

* Double edition of the second edition: J. de Ruyter, Amsterdam The printing history of this book is complicated: In 1985 Annemarie Kets-Vree discovered a secret edition of this book. Appearance and typography of the book are identical and the title page still mentions &#x27;Second Edition&#x27;. The book, however, was completely set anew by hand, and printed for the third time. The double printing could be identified with a printer&#x27;s error in line 5 of the first chapter: &quot;lieve lezers&quot; (dear readers) instead of &quot;lieve lezer&quot; (Dear reader):

The reason for this covert edition is unknown, but it is speculated it was done by De Ruyter to avoid having to pay royalties to Dekker. The number of copies is unknown.

* February 1868: English translation: &quot;Max Havelaar or the Coffee auctions of the Dutch Trading Company&quot; by Multatuli. Translated from the original manuscript by Baron Alphonse Nahuÿs, Edinburgh, Edmonston &amp; Douglas, Price: 12 shillings. From 12 March 1868 the book was on sale in Netherlands. This was the first edition made in cooperation with the author. Nahuys mentioned he used the original manuscript, but this manuscript was still with the editor of the first edition, De Ruyter.

* December 1871 - 20 January 1872: Third edition, Karel Hermanus Schadd, 296 pages, 5000 copies (small octavo 18,5 × 13 cm) price ƒ 2.90 + 100 copies of the luxe edition. price: ƒ 7.50 (large octavo 24 × 17 cm) In 1870 De Ruyter had sold his copyright for 2000 guilders. The text-source for this edition was the double-edition of the second-edition: The mistake in that edition remains: &quot;lieve lezers &quot; Both editions were printed in the same type, only the page size differed. There was a cheaper edition of the book available, but Douwes Dekker had no part in its sales and did not receive any income from it. He also could not correct or modify any of the text. In early 1873, Schadd sold his rights in the book for ƒ 2500 to the firm v/d Heuvell &amp; Van Santen in Leiden.

* 4th edition: G.L.Funke, Amsterdam, 19 October 1875, 388 pages, small octavo, 5000 copies. This is the first edition done in cooperation with the author. In it many mistakes and alterations from the first edition could be corrected. Dekker added also numerous comments to the text to explain his intentions.

* 5th edition: Uitgevers Maatschappij Elsevier, Amsterdam, 1 November 1881, small octavo, ƒ 1,90 bound in paper ƒ 2,40 for copies in a hard cover. Second (and last) edition in cooperation with the author. Of this edition there have been four variants found, in the type at the press some changes were made, on both sides of the leaf. The papers that had already been printed earlier were not discarded, but were still used. Combining two different leaves makes four combinations possible. Copies of all four combinations have been identified.

* &quot;Multatuli, Max Havelaar of De koffiveilingen der Nederlandsche Handelmaatschappy&quot;. Critical edition, edited by Annemarie Kets-Vree. Monumenta Literaria Neerlandica VI, 1 and VI, 2. Assen/Maastricht, 1992.

* The manuscript remained untraceable for a long time. During the preparations for the celebration of 50 years Max Havelaar in 1910, a general appeal was made to make available, lend or donate documents, letters and other multatuliana to the association &quot;Het Multatuli Museum&quot; under construction. A descendant of J. de Ruyter, mr. C.H.E. Reelfs, found the original in his closet, among his stepfather&#x27;s papers, and donated it to the Multatuli Museum. A copy thereof was published in 2007. The manuscript from 1860 is a newly transcribed version of an earlier draft, with all the corrections by Jacob van Lennep. Van Lennep first reduces the number of chapters in the manuscript to seventeen. The final number of chapters in print is slightly larger, namely twenty. Van Lennep also changed a large number of things during the correction of the type.

<doc id="363477" wikidata="Q1395653" url="?curid=363477" title="Introsort">
<text>Introsort or introspective sort is a hybrid sorting algorithm that provides both fast average performance and (asymptotically) optimal worst-case performance. It begins with quicksort, it switches to heapsort when the recursion depth exceeds a level based on (the logarithm of) the number of elements being sorted and it switches to insertion sort when the number of elements is below some threshold. This combines the good parts of the three algorithms, with practical performance comparable to quicksort on typical data sets and worst-case O(&quot;n&quot; log &quot;n&quot;) runtime due to the heap sort. Since the three algorithms it uses are comparison sorts, it is also a comparison sort.

Introsort was invented by David Musser in , in which he also introduced introselect, a hybrid selection algorithm based on quickselect (a variant of quicksort), which falls back to median of medians and thus provides worst-case linear complexity, which is optimal. Both algorithms were introduced with the purpose of providing generic algorithms for the C++ Standard Library which had both fast average performance and optimal worst-case performance, thus allowing the performance requirements to be tightened. Introsort is in-place and a non-stable algorithm.

==Pseudocode==
If a heapsort implementation and partitioning functions of the type discussed in the quicksort article are available, the introsort can be described succinctly as

 procedure sort(A : array):
 maxdepth ← ⌊log2(length(A))⌋ × 2
 introsort(A, maxdepth)
 procedure introsort(A, maxdepth):
 n ← length(A)
 if n &lt; 16:
 insertionsort(A)
 else if maxdepth = 0:
 heapsort(A)
 else:
 p ← partition(A) &quot;// assume this function does pivot selection, p is the final position of the pivot&quot;
 introsort(A[1:p-1], maxdepth - 1)
 introsort(A[p+1:n], maxdepth - 1)

The factor 2 in the maximum depth is arbitrary; it can be tuned for practical performance. denotes the array slice of items to including both and . The indices are assumed to start with 1 (the first element of the array is ).

==Analysis==
In quicksort, one of the critical operations is choosing the pivot: the element around which the list is partitioned. The simplest pivot selection algorithm is to take the first or the last element of the list as the pivot, causing poor behavior for the case of sorted or nearly sorted input. Niklaus Wirth&#x27;s variant uses the middle element to prevent these occurrences, degenerating to O(&quot;n&quot;2) for contrived sequences. The median-of-3 pivot selection algorithm takes the median of the first, middle, and last elements of the list; however, even though this performs well on many real-world inputs, it is still possible to contrive a &quot;median-of-3 killer&quot; list that will cause dramatic slowdown of a quicksort based on this pivot selection technique.

Musser reported that on a median-of-3 killer sequence of 100,000 elements, introsort&#x27;s running time was 1/200 that of median-of-3 quicksort. Musser also considered the effect on caches of Sedgewick&#x27;s delayed small sorting, where small ranges are sorted at the end in a single pass of insertion sort. He reported that it could double the number of cache misses, but that its performance with double-ended queues was significantly better and should be retained for template libraries, in part because the gain in other cases from doing the sorts immediately was not great.

==Implementations==
Introsort or some variant is used in a number of standard library sort functions, including some C++ sort implementations.

The June 2000 SGI C++ Standard Template Library stl_algo.h implementation of unstable sort uses the Musser introsort approach with the recursion depth to switch to heapsort passed as a parameter, median-of-3 pivot selection and the Knuth final insertion sort pass for partitions smaller than 16.

The GNU Standard C++ library is similar: uses introsort with a maximum depth of 2×log2 &quot;n&quot;, followed by an insertion sort on partitions smaller than 16.

LLVM libc++ also uses introsort with a maximum depth of 2×log2 &quot;n&quot;, however the size limit for insertion sort is different for different data types (30 if swaps are trivial, 6 otherwise). Also, arrays with sizes up to 5 are handled separately. Kutenin (2022) provides an overview for some changes made by LLVM, with a focus on the 2022 fix for quadraticness.

The Microsoft .NET Framework Class Library, starting from version 4.5 (2012), uses introsort instead of simple quicksort.

Go uses a modification of introsort: for slices of 12 or less elements it uses insertion sort, and for larger slices it uses pattern-defeating quicksort and more advanced median of three medians for pivot selection. Prior to version 1.19 it used shell sort for small slices.

Java, starting from version 14 (2020), uses a hybrid sorting algorithm that uses merge sort for highly structured arrays (arrays that are composed of a small number of sorted subarrays) and introsort otherwise to sort arrays of ints, longs, floats and doubles.

== Variants ==

=== pdqsort ===
Pattern-defeating quicksort (pdqsort) is a variant of introsort developed by Orson Peters, incorporating the following improvements:
* Median-of-three pivoting,
* &quot;BlockQuicksort&quot; partitioning technique to mitigate branch misprediction penalities,
* Linear time performance for certain input patterns (adaptive sort),
* Use element shuffling on bad cases before trying the slower heapsort.
* Improved adaptivity for low-cardinality inputs

Pdqsort is used by Rust, GAP, and the C++ library Boost.

=== fluxsort ===
fluxsort is a stable variant of introsort incorporating the following improvements:
* branchless sqrt(n) pivoting
* Flux partitioning technique for stable partially-in-place partitioning
* Significantly improved smallsort by utilizing branchless bi-directional parity merges
* A fallback to quadsort, a branchless bi-directional mergesort, significantly increasing adaptivity for ordered inputs

Improvements introduced by fluxsort and its unstable variant, crumsort, were adopted by crumsort-rs, glidesort, ipnsort, and driftsort. The overall performance increase on random inputs compared to pdqsort is around 50%.

<doc id="363483" wikidata="Q192141" url="?curid=363483" title="Augite">
<text>Augite, also known as Augurite, is a common rock-forming pyroxene mineral with formula . The crystals are monoclinic and prismatic. Augite has two prominent cleavages, meeting at angles near 90 degrees.

==Characteristics==

Augite is a solid solution in the pyroxene group. Diopside and hedenbergite are important endmembers in augite, but augite can also contain significant aluminium, titanium, and sodium and other elements. The calcium content of augite is limited by a miscibility gap between it and pigeonite and orthopyroxene: when occurring with either of these other pyroxenes, the calcium content of augite is a function of temperature and pressure, but mostly of temperature, and so can be useful in reconstructing temperature histories of rocks. With declining temperature, augite may exsolve lamellae of pigeonite and/or orthopyroxene. There is also a miscibility gap between augite and omphacite, but this gap occurs at higher temperatures. There are no industrial or economic uses for this mineral.

==Locations==
Augite is an essential mineral in mafic igneous rocks; for example, gabbro and basalt and common in ultramafic rocks. It also occurs in relatively high-temperature metamorphic rocks such as mafic granulite and metamorphosed iron formations. It commonly occurs in association with orthoclase, sanidine, labradorite, olivine, leucite, amphiboles and other pyroxenes.

Occasional specimens have a shiny appearance that give rise to the mineral&#x27;s name, which is from the Greek &quot;augites&quot;, meaning &quot;brightness&quot;, although ordinary specimens have a dull (dark green, brown or black) luster. It was named by Abraham Gottlob Werner in 1792.

<text>George Smith (26 March 1840 – 19 August 1876) was a pioneering English Assyriologist who first discovered and translated the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, one of the oldest-known written works of literature.

==Early life and early career==
As the son of a working-class family in Victorian England, Smith was limited in his ability to acquire a formal education. At age fourteen, he was apprenticed to the London-based publishing house of Bradbury and Evans to learn banknote engraving, at which he excelled. From his youth, he was fascinated with Assyrian culture and history. In his spare time, he read everything that was available to him on the subject. His interest was so keen that while working at the printing firm, he spent his lunch hours at the British Museum, studying publications on the cuneiform tablets that had been unearthed near Mosul in present-day Iraq by Austen Henry Layard, Henry Rawlinson, and Hormuzd Rassam, during the archaeological expeditions of 1840–1855. In 1863 Smith married Mary Clifton (18351883), and they had six children.

== British Museum ==
Smith&#x27;s natural talent for cuneiform studies was first noticed by Samuel Birch, Egyptologist and Director of the Department of Antiquities, who brought the young man to the attention of the renowned Assyriologist Sir Henry Rawlinson. As early as 1861, he was working evenings sorting and cleaning the mass of friable fragments of clay cylinders and tablets in the museum&#x27;s storage rooms. In 1866 Smith made his first important discovery, the date of the payment of the tribute by Jehu, king of Israel, to Shalmaneser III. Sir Henry suggested to the trustees of the museum that Smith should join him in the preparation of the third and fourth volumes of &quot;The Cuneiform Inscriptions of Western Asia&quot;. Following the death of William H. Coxe in 1869 and with letters of reference from Rawlinson, Layard, William Henry Fox Talbot, and Edwin Norris, Smith was appointed Senior Assistant in the Assyriology Department early in 1870.

== Discovery of inscriptions ==
Smith&#x27;s earliest successes were the discoveries of two unique inscriptions early in 1867. The first, a total eclipse of the sun in the month of Sivan inscribed on Tablet K51, he linked to the spectacular eclipse that occurred on 15 June 763 BC, a description of which had been published 80 years earlier by French historian François Clément (17141793) in &quot;L&#x27;art de vérifier les dates des faits historiques&quot;. This discovery is the cornerstone of ancient Near Eastern chronology. The other was the date of an invasion of Babylonia by the Elamites in 2280 BC.

In 1871, Smith published &quot;Annals of Assur-bani-pal&quot;, transliterated and translated, and communicated to the newly founded Society of Biblical Archaeology a paper on &quot;The Early History of Babylonia&quot;, and an account of his decipherment of the Cypriote inscriptions.

==&quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot; and expedition to Nineveh==
In 1872, Smith achieved worldwide fame by his translation of the Chaldaean account of the Great Flood, which he read before the Society of Biblical Archaeology on 3 December. The audience included the sitting prime minister, William Ewart Gladstone. According to the accounts of his coworkers in the reading room, on the day of the discovery, when Smith realized what he was reading he &quot;began to remove articles of his clothing&quot; and run around the room shouting in delight.

This work is better known today as the eleventh tablet of the &quot;Epic of Gilgamesh&quot;, one of the oldest known works of literature, discovered by Hormuzd Rassam in 1853 on an archaeological mission for the British Museum on behalf of his colleague and mentor Austen Henry Layard. The following January, Edwin Arnold, the editor of &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot;, arranged for Smith to go to Nineveh at the expense of that newspaper and carry out excavations with a view to finding the missing fragments of the Flood story. This journey resulted not only in the discovery of some missing tablets, but also of fragments that recorded the succession and duration of the Babylonian dynasties.

In November 1873 Smith again left England for Nineveh for a second expedition, this time at the expense of the museum, and continued his excavations at the tell of Kouyunjik (Nineveh). An account of his work is given in &quot;Assyrian Discoveries&quot;, published early in 1875. The rest of the year was spent in fixing together and translating the fragments relating to the creation, the results of which were published in &quot;The Chaldaean Account of Genesis&quot; (1880, co-written with Archibald Sayce).

== Final expedition and death ==
In March 1876, the trustees of the British Museum sent Smith once more to excavate the rest of the Library of Ashurbanipal. At İkizce, a small village about sixty miles northeast of Aleppo, he fell ill with dysentery. He died in Aleppo on 19 August. He left a wife and several children to whom an annuity of 150 pounds was granted by the Queen.

<doc id="363516" wikidata="Q281541" url="?curid=363516" title="Animation in the United States during the silent era">
<text>The silent age of American animation dates back to at least 1906 when Vitagraph released &quot;Humorous Phases of Funny Faces&quot;. Although early animations were rudimentary, they rapidly became more sophisticated with such classics as &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot; in 1914, Felix the Cat, Oswald the Lucky Rabbit, and Koko the Clown.

Originally a novelty, some early animated silents depicted magic acts or were strongly influenced by the comic strip. Later, they were distributed along with newsreels. Early animation films, like their live-action silent cousins, would come with a musical score to be played by an organist or even an orchestra in larger theatres. Silent cartoons became almost entirely obsolete after 1928, when sound synchronized cartoons were introduced with the debut of Walt Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse in &quot;Steamboat Willie&quot;, thus ushering in the golden age of American animation.

==History==

British-American filmmaker J. Stuart Blackton was possibly the first to use animation techniques in the US for film versions of his &quot;lightning artist&quot; routine. &quot;The Enchanted Drawing&quot; (1900) utilized the stop trick to make drawings appear to change magically. In &quot;Humorous Phases of Funny Faces&quot; (1906) he had blackboard drawings go through series of changes and used animated cutout drawings in the same style for more fluent motion. It is regarded as the oldest known theatrically released animation on standard film (lithographed film loops for home use and Charles-Émile Reynaud&#x27;s Théâtre Optique films had already been popular in Europe for years).

Following the successes of Blackton and of French animator Émile Cohl (whose &quot;Fantasmagorie&quot; (1908) is regarded as the first traditional animation on standard film), many other artists began experimenting with animation. One such artist was Winsor McCay, who created detailed animation with painstaking attention to detail. Each frame was drawn on paper; which invariably required backgrounds and characters to be redrawn and animated. Among McCay&#x27;s most noted films are &quot;Little Nemo&quot; (1911), &quot;Gertie the Dinosaur&quot; (1914) and &quot;The Sinking of the Lusitania&quot; (1918).

During the 1910s larger scale animation studios were becoming the industrial norm and artists such as McCay faded from the public eye. The production of animated short films, typically referred to as &quot;cartoons&quot;, became an industry of its own during the 1910s, and cartoon shorts were produced to be shown in movie theaters.

Around 1913 Raoul Barré developed the peg system that made it easier to align drawings by perforating two holes below each drawing and placing them on two fixed pins. He also used a &quot;slash and tear&quot; technique to not have to draw the complete background or other motionless parts for every frame. The parts where something needed to be changed for the next frame were carefully cut away from the drawing and filled in with the required change on the sheet below. After Barré had started his career in animation at Edison Studios, he founded one of the first film studios dedicated to animation in 1914 (initially together with Bill Nolan). Barré Studio had success with the production of the adaptation of the comic strip &quot;Mutt and Jeff&quot; (1916–1926). The studio employed several animators who would have notable careers in animation, including Frank Moser, Gregory La Cava, Vernon Stallings, and Pat Sullivan.

In 1914, John Bray opened John Bray Studios, which revolutionized the way animation was created. Earl Hurd, one of Bray&#x27;s employees patented the cel technique. This involved animating moving objects on transparent celluloid sheets. Animators photographed the sheets over a stationary background image to generate the sequence of images. This, as well as Bray&#x27;s innovative use of the assembly line method, allowed John Bray Studios to create Colonel Heeza Liar, the first animated series. Many aspiring cartoonists started their careers at Bray, including Walt Disney (later of Mickey Mouse fame), Paul Terry (later of Heckle and Jeckle fame), Max Fleischer (later of Betty Boop and Popeye fame), and Walter Lantz (later of Woody Woodpecker fame). The cartoon studio operated from circa 1914 until 1928. Some of the first cartoon stars from the Bray studios were Farmer Alfalfa (by Paul Terry) and Bobby Bumps (by Earl Hurd).

In 1915, Max Fleischer applied for a patent for a technique that would become known as rotoscoping: the process of using live-action film recordings as a reference point to more easily create realistic animated movements. The technique was often used in the &quot;Out of the Inkwell&quot; series (1918-1929) for John Bray Productions (and others). The series resulted from experimental rotoscoped images of Dave Fleischer performing as a clown, evolving into a character that would become known as Ko-Ko the Clown.

Newspaper tycoon William Randolph Hearst founded International Film Service in 1916. Hearst lured away most of Barré Studio&#x27;s animators, with Gregory La Cava becoming the head of the studio. They produced adaptations of many comic strips from Heart&#x27;s newspapers in a rather limited fashion, giving just a little motion to the characters while mainly using the dialog balloons to deliver the story. The most notable series was &quot;Krazy Kat&quot;, with an early anthropomorphic cartoon cat character. Before the studio stopped in 1918 it had employed some new talents, including Vernon Stallings, Ben Sharpsteen, Jack King, John Foster, Grim Natwick, Burt Gillett and Isadore Klein.
The most popular cartoon series during the silent era was Australian-American film producer Pat Sullivan&#x27;s Felix the Cat. &quot;Felix the Cat&quot; (Originally named &quot;Master Tom&quot;) first appeared in &quot;Feline Follies&quot; (1919) and became hugely successful throughout the 1920s. The studio later came into trouble during the advent of sound cartoons in the early 1930s when the popularity of Walt Disney&#x27;s Mickey Mouse was rising above Sullivan&#x27;s Felix. Sullivan tried to adapt Felix by creating Felix sound cartoons, but they failed to please audiences and Sullivan closed the studio in 1930. He died three years later due to health problems related to alcoholism.

Charles Bowers was a comedian and animator who made many bizarre films in the 1920s combining stop-motion animation and comedy. Many of them have been lost, but some have been released on DVD.

<doc id="363517" wikidata="Q807454" url="?curid=363517" title="Barbara Hall (politician)">
<text>Barbara Hall (born 1946) is a Canadian lawyer and former politician who served as the 61st mayor of Toronto from 1994 to 1997, the last mayor of Toronto prior to amalgamation. Hall served as the chief commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission from 2005 to 2015.

In 2014, Cawthra Square Park in Toronto&#x27;s Church and Wellesley neighbourhood was renamed Barbara Hall Park in her honour. She was inducted as a Member of the Order of Canada in 2015.

==Background==
Hall attended the University of Victoria in British Columbia but left without a bachelor&#x27;s degree. She then became a community activist, moving to Nova Scotia to work with black families in rural areas. Hall worked as one of the first members of the Company of Young Canadians in the small community of Three Mile Plains, Nova Scotia.

In 1967, at the age of 20, she worked for Toronto youth programs and co-founded an alternative school. She served for a time as a probation officer in Cleveland, Ohio. She returned to Canada and studied law at Osgoode Hall Law School of York University and in 1980 was admitted to the Law Society of Upper Canada.

To earn money during her studies, Hall waited table at the Second City.

==Political career==

===Provincial===
Hall campaigned for the Legislative Assembly of Ontario in the 1985 provincial election as a candidate of the New Democratic Party in St. David. She finished third against Liberal Attorney-General Ian Scott.

===Municipal===
She was elected to Toronto City Council in the 1985 municipal election. That election marked a change in the structure of city council; prior to 1985, each ward elected two representatives to city council, and the one who had garnered more votes would also serve on Metro Toronto Council, but in the 1985 election each ward now directly elected a single representative to each body. Hall succeeded David Reville, who had departed municipal politics after winning a seat in the provincial election, and Joanne Campbell, who had run for and won election to the Metro Council.

===Mayor of Toronto===
Hall was elected Mayor of Toronto in 1994, defeating incumbent June Rowlands. Although she ran as an independent and was backed by supporters from different parties, she was widely regarded as an unofficial candidate of the New Democratic Party (NDP). Hall&#x27;s victory was considered an upset, given the low popularity of Bob Rae&#x27;s provincial NDP government at the time. She was the first mayor of Toronto to be a member of the NDP since William Dennison. As mayor, she presided over a period of economic growth for the city, represented by large construction projects like The Air Canada Centre and improvements to downtown residential neighbourhoods such as Cabbagetown and Church-Wellesley. She was the first Toronto Mayor to march in the city&#x27;s Pride Parade, supported affordable housing initiatives, and helped introduce violence against women as a national political issue in Canada.

In 1997, a new provincial government under Mike Harris amalgamated the City of Toronto with Scarborough, York, East York, North York, and Etobicoke. The new &quot;megacity&quot; was also called Toronto. Hall opposed the amalgamation, but nonetheless ran for mayor of the new municipality. Although she won the majority of the vote in old Toronto, York and East York, she lost to outgoing North York mayor Mel Lastman, who had a very strong base of support in North York as well as in Etobicoke and Scarborough. Hall started the campaign well behind Lastman in public opinion polls, but she improved her support enough to place a close second.

===2003 mayoral candidacy and subsequent work===
Hall ran for mayor again in 2003 and on this occasion was strongly backed by supporters of the Ontario Liberal Party. She was widely considered an unofficial Liberal candidate while David Miller, an NDP city councillor, was considered an unofficial NDP candidate and John Tory was an unofficial Progressive Conservative candidate. Despite being the front-runner at the campaign&#x27;s start and garnering strong support from the city&#x27;s ethnic press, Hall wound up a distant third behind the winner, Miller, and runner-up John Tory.

==Provincial appointee==
Hall subsequently served on the Ontario government&#x27;s &quot;Health Results Team&quot; as lead of community relations. Hall was appointed to this position by Health Minister George Smitherman, who had worked in Hall&#x27;s office while she was mayor.

==Chief Commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission==
In November 2005, Hall was appointed the Chief Commissioner of the Ontario Human Rights Commission (OHRC).

In December 2007, the OHRC released a preliminary report looking into bullying of Canadian-Asians fishing illegally on Lake Simcoe. Hall wrote that violence and harassment of Canadian-Asian anglers &quot;remind us that racism and racial discrimination exist in Ontario.&quot; Hall added that &quot;We&#x27;re looking for communities across Ontario to have an open dialogue and take action on racism. Although this is often hard to do, it is necessary to make communities welcoming and safe for all.&quot;

===Complaint against &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;===
In April 2008, the OHRC dismissed a complaint by the Canadian Islamic Congress against &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, but issued a statement denouncing the magazine. In an interview, Hall stated that &quot;When the media writes, it should exercise great caution that it&#x27;s not promoting stereotypes that will adversely impact on identifiable groups. I think one needs to be very careful when one speaks in generalities, that in fact one is speaking factually about all the people in a particular group.&quot;

The editors of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; denounced Hall and her staff for what they called the &quot;zealous condemnation of their journalism&quot; and stated that &quot;[Hall] cited no evidence, considered no counter-arguments, and appointed herself prosecutor, judge and jury in one fell swoop.&quot; &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; also accused every human rights commission in the country of &quot;morphing out of their conciliatory roles to become crusaders working to reshape journalistic discourse in Canada.&quot; &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; wrote that Ms. Hall&#x27;s press release was &quot;a drive-by smear,&quot; and &quot;perhaps the greatest disappointment in this whole saga.&quot; Mark Steyn, who wrote the excerpt in &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; that the complaint was based on, also sharply criticized Hall and the OHRC, commenting that &quot;Even though they (the OHRC) don&#x27;t have the guts to hear the case, they might as well find us guilty.&quot;

At a meeting of the Canadian Arab Federation on the day after the British Columbia Human Rights Tribunal heard the complaint, Hall served on a panel along with Khurrum Awan, one of the student lawyers who helped file the complaint who testified at the BC Human Rights Tribunal against &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, and Haroon Siddiqui, editor emeritus of the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. Hall joked to the audience that she could finally speak freely with her co-panellist Awan about his complaint. Awan praised Hall&#x27;s condemnation of &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot;, stating that he had difficulty developing support until Hall called &quot;Maclean&#x27;s&quot; Islamophobic, and then &quot;everyone wanted to be our uncle.&quot;

===Proposal for a National Press Council===
In February 2009, in a report to the Canadian Human Rights Commission, Hall in her capacity as OHRC Commissioner, recommended the creation of a National Press Council that would serve as a national media watchdog. Unlike current press councils in Canada, membership to this new council would be required by all publishers, webmasters and radio and television producers. Hall stated that such a council was necessary to protect human rights but insisted that such a body would not result in censorship of the media. Hall explained that the national press council would have the power to accept complaints of discrimination, in particular from &quot;vulnerable groups&quot; and although the council would have no power to censor media outlets, it could force them to carry the council&#x27;s decisions, including counterarguments made by complainants.

Mary Agnes Welch, president of the Canadian Association of Journalists, stated that the current provincial press councils are &quot;the only real place that readers can go to complain about stories short of the courts&quot; but that they &quot;are largely toothless and ineffective.&quot; However, she argued against a mandatory national press council, stating that:
&quot;The provincial ones don&#x27;t even work, so how could we have a national one? And I know a lot of journalists who would take umbrage at essentially being in a federally regulated profession... If on the crazy off-chance that there is some momentum behind this idea of a national press council, it won&#x27;t be coming from journalists.&quot;
The &quot;National Post&quot; strongly opposed Hall&#x27;s proposal, arguing that a mandatory national press council &quot;is merely the first step toward letting the Barbara Halls of the world decide what you get to hear, see and read.&quot; The &quot;Post&quot; also stated that Hall is a &quot;pompous purveyor of social concern&quot; who believes she &quot;has the ability to judge which speech should be free and which not.&quot; Barbara Kay also strongly opposed Hall&#x27;s suggestion, stating that her experience with the Quebec Press Council (QPC) was evidence that press councils are abused by those wishing to suppress the discussion of sensitive or controversial issues.

==Toronto District School Board review==
On March 16, 2015, Hall was appointed by the provincial government to chair a seven-member panel that will conduct public consultations to review the governance of the Toronto District School Board in an effort to &quot;restore public confidence&quot; in the institution after a series of controversies.

==#TorontoStrong Fund administrator==
After the Toronto van attack in April 2018, Hall was appointed as administrator by the volunteer steering committee of the #TorontoStrong Fund on June 13, 2018. She is tasked with distributing the approximately $3.4 million to the 26 victims and survivors of the attack by September 28, 2018.

==Advocate against Cabbagetown DayCare==
The former Ontario Human Rights Commission Head has been an outspoken opponent of a local daycare for young children in her home area of Cabbagetown in Toronto. &quot;It just seems like a massive change for the neighborhood&quot; Hall was quoted in a Dec. 12, 2018 National Post article by Chris Selley.

<doc id="363520" wikidata="Q2077565" url="?curid=363520" title="J. B. Jeyaretnam">
<text>Joshua Benjamin Jeyaretnam (; 5 January 1926 – 30 September 2008), better known as J. B. Jeyaretnam or by his initials JBJ, was a Singaporean politician, lawyer and secretary-general of WP between 1971 and 2001 and the Leader of the Opposition between 1981 and 1986. A former member of the opposition Workers&#x27; Party, He was a Member of Parliament for Anson SMC between 1981 and 1986.

He was a Non-constituency Member of Parliament between 1997 and 2001.

Born in Jaffna in 1926, Jeyaretnam grew up in Malaya and Singapore before he read law in London and qualified as a barrister in 1951. Upon returning to Singapore, he worked in the legal service from 1952 to 1963 before setting up his own law firm in 1968. He entered politics in 1971 and became the secretary-general of the opposition Workers&#x27; Party. Thereafter, he contested in the 1972, 1976, 1980 general election, 1977 and 1979 by-elections, but lost to the governing People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) in all of them.

Jeyaretnam had his first electoral victory in the 1981 by-election in Anson SMC when he won 51.93% of the vote against the PAP&#x27;s Pang Kim Hin and United People&#x27;s Front&#x27;s Harbans Singh, becoming the first opposition politician to be elected into Parliament since Singapore gained independence in 1965. He contested in the 1984 general election in Anson SMC again and won with 56.81% of the vote against the PAP&#x27;s Ng Pock Too.

In 1986, following convictions for making false statements about the Workers&#x27; Party&#x27;s accounts, Jeyaretnam was not only fined and imprisoned for a month, but also lost his parliamentary seat. After he was disqualified from practising law in 1987, he appealed to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council, which reversed his disbarment in 1988 and called his conviction &quot;a grievous injustice&quot;. Jeyaretnam appealed to Wee Kim Wee, the President of Singapore, for his convictions to be removed so that he could return to Parliament, but was denied.

During the 1997 general election, Jeyaretnam joined a five-member Workers&#x27; Party team to contest in Cheng San GRC, but they lost 45.18% of the vote against the PAP team. Since the Workers&#x27; Party team in Cheng San GRC were the &quot;best losers&quot; in an election in which there were fewer than six elected opposition Members of Parliament, they were offered one parliamentary seat as a Non-Constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP), which Jeyaretnam took up. However, Jeyaretnam lost his NCMP seat and left the Workers&#x27; Party in 2001 when he was declared bankrupt after failing to keep up with damages from a series of defamation suits against him.

After his discharge from bankruptcy in 2007, Jeyaretnam founded the Reform Party in June 2008. He died of heart failure on 30 September that year.

== Early life and education ==
An Anglican Christian of Sri Lankan Tamil descent, Jeyaretnam was born in Chankanai, Jaffna while his parents were on leave from Malaya. His father, Victor Lord Joshua, moved to Malaya and took up a position with the Public Works Department.

Jeyaretnam grew up in Johor and started his formal education in Muar in a French convent where his eldest sister was a student. When his education at English College Johore Bahru was disrupted by the Japanese occupation of Malaya, Jeyaretnam learned Japanese to make himself more employable, and began working in the census department, then as an interpreter in the Japanese Transport Department. In Jeyaretnam&#x27;s oral interviews, he said it was a means to avoid being pressed into building the Burma Railway, which was called the &quot;Death Railway&quot; due to the high fatality rate during its construction.

After the war, Jeyaretnam moved to Singapore, where he continued his education at St. Andrew&#x27;s School. In 1948, he left for England to read law at University College London and graduated with a Bachelor of Laws (Honours) in 1951.

== Legal career ==
After being called to the bar as a barrister at Gray&#x27;s Inn on 27 November 1951, Jeyaretnam joined the Singapore Legal Service in 1952. In the following 11 years, Jeyaretnam held various positions, including magistrate, district judge, crown counsel, deputy public prosecutor and registrar of the Supreme Court. He was also Singapore&#x27;s first criminal district judge. In his memoir, Jeyaretnam revealed that he had crossed swords with Lee Kuan Yew when the latter was still a practising lawyer, at times when Jeyaretnam was the deputy public prosecutor and later the presiding court judge. He left the legal service in 1963 for private practice and eventually set up his own law firm in 1968.

In February 1970, a month after the abolition of jury trials in Singapore, Jeyaretnam represented Teo Cheng Leong, who had been found guilty of shooting at a police officer with intent to cause harm and was the first person to be sentenced to death in Singapore by a non-jury trial court with two judges. Before the trial, Jeyaretnam sought to have Teo tried by a jury since his case took place in March 1969, ten months before the abolition of jury trials, so the case should be conferred for a jury trial. Jeyaretnam&#x27;s request was overruled and Teo was eventually hanged in May 1971.

In 1983, Jeyaretnam defended Tan Mui Choo, one of the three perpetrators of the 1981 Toa Payoh ritual murders.

== Political career ==
=== Elections between 1971 and 1980 ===
In June 1971, Jeyaretnam joined the opposition Workers&#x27; Party and became the party&#x27;s secretary-general. He made his electoral debut in the 1972 general election when he contested in Farrer Park SMC against Lee Chiaw Meng of the governing People&#x27;s Action Party (PAP) and S. A. Latiff of the opposition United People&#x27;s Front (UPF). He lost with 23.11% of the vote against Lee&#x27;s 73.82%, but did better than Latiff&#x27;s 3.07%.

During the 1976 general election, Jeyaretnam contested in Kampong Chai Chee SMC against PAP candidate Andrew Fong, but lost after garnering 40.08% of the vote against Fong&#x27;s 59.92%. The following year, he contested in the by-election in Radin Mas SMC against the PAP&#x27;s Bernard Chen, but lost with 29.41% of the vote against Chen&#x27;s 70.59%. In 1979, he contested in a by-election in Telok Blangah SMC against Rohan Kamis of the PAP, but lost with 38.78% of the vote against Rohan&#x27;s 61.22%. During the 1980 general election, he contested in Telok Blangah SMC against Rohan and lost again after garnering 46.98% of the vote against his opponent&#x27;s 53.02%.

=== First opposition Member of Parliament since 1965 ===
Jeyaretnam contested in a three-cornered fight during the 1981 by-election in Anson SMC against Pang Kim Hin of the PAP and Harbans Singh of the United People&#x27;s Front. He won with 51.93% of the vote against Pang&#x27;s 47.1% and Singh&#x27;s 0.97%, becoming the first opposition politician to be elected to Parliament since Singapore gained independence in 1965. In the same year, Jeyaretnam represented Chiam See Tong, founder of the opposition Singapore Democratic Party, in filing a writ in the High Court seeking damages from Defence Minister Howe Yoon Chong and Foreign Affairs Minister S. Dhanabalan for slandering him during the speeches they made in 1980. Chiam eventually dropped the lawsuits against Howe and Dhanabalan after they publicly apologised to him.

In 1982, a complaint against Jeyaretnam was referred to the Singapore Parliament&#x27;s Committee of Privileges, which looks into allegations of breaches of parliamentary privilege. He received a reprimand for not declaring a conflict of interest in an issue he brought up in Parliament which involved a person whom he was representing as a lawyer.

Jeyaretnam contested in Anson SMC again during the 1984 general election and won with 56.81% of the vote against the PAP candidate Ng Pock Too&#x27;s 43.19%. The 1984 general election also saw Chiam winning the election in Potong Pasir SMC with 60.28% against the PAP candidate Mah Bow Tan. Jeyaretnam and Chiam were the only two elected opposition Members of Parliament in the Sixth Parliament.

=== Parliamentary fines and loss of parliamentary seat ===
In March 1986, Jeyaretnam was referred to the Committee of Privileges again for making an unsubstantiated allegation in Parliament about the wrongful arrest of a citizen and failing to declare a conflict of interest in an issue he brought up in Parliament. He received two fines amounting to S$2,000.

Jeyaretnam was also fined S$1,000 by the committee for alleging that the Cabinet had interfered with the Subordinate Courts. After he sent letters to Anson SMC residents about the committee&#x27;s conduct during his hearing, he was fined a total of S$25,000 for making a distorted report of the hearing in his letters.

On 10 November 1986, Jeyaretnam lost his parliamentary seat following his convictions for making false statements.

Jeyaretnam was fined S$10,000 in 1987 on a complaint that he, as the editor of the Workers&#x27; Party&#x27;s newsletter &quot;The Hammer&quot;, had allowed the publication of a distorted report on the committee in December 1986. The Workers&#x27; Party&#x27;s executive council was also fined S$5,000.

===Presidential elections===
In 1993, Jeyaretnam submitted an application for a certificate of eligibility to contest the presidential election but his application was rejected.

=== 1997 general election ===
During the 1997 general election, Jeyaretnam joined a five-member Workers&#x27; Party team to contest in Cheng San GRC against a PAP team led by Education Minister Lee Yock Suan. However, the Workers&#x27; Party team lost after garnering 45.18% of the vote against the PAP team&#x27;s 54.82%. Since the Workers&#x27; Party team in Cheng San GRC were the &quot;best losers&quot; in an election in which there were fewer than six elected opposition Members of Parliament, they were offered one parliamentary seat as a Non-constituency Member of Parliament (NCMP). The Workers&#x27; Party selected Jeyaretnam to be the NCMP, which he accepted. He lost his NCMP seat after being declared bankrupt in July 2001 because undischarged bankrupts are barred from serving in Parliament and running for parliamentary elections.

=== Leaving the Workers&#x27; Party ===
In October 2001, Jeyaretnam left the Workers&#x27; Party after he felt ostracised by his fellow party members and after he accused the party&#x27;s leaders of not offering to help him with his debt payments.

=== Founding the Reform Party ===
Following his discharge from bankruptcy in May 2007, Jeyaretnam announced his intention in April 2008 to challenge the PAP government again by forming a new political party, the Reform Party. On 17 June 2008, the Registry of Societies approved the Reform Party&#x27;s application, making it an officially registered society in Singapore. Jeyaretnam served as the interim secretary-general of the party, which had only the legal minimum of ten members at the time of its creation.

== Legal troubles ==
=== 1977–1979: Defamation suit from Lee Kuan Yew ===
After the 1976 general election, Lee Kuan Yew demanded an unconditional apology from Jeyaretnam for making the following remarks in a speech during the lead-up to the election: 

Lee filed a defamation suit against Jeyaretnam in court when the latter refused to apologise. Lee and Jeyaretnam were represented in court by Queen&#x27;s Counsels Robert Alexander and John Mortimer respectively, with the latter defending Jeyaretnam pro bono. A five-day trial took place in November 1978 and made headlines in &quot;The Straits Times&quot;. During the trial, Michael Wong Pakshong, the managing director of the Monetary Authority of Singapore (MAS), claimed that the law firm Lee &amp; Lee (run by Lee&#x27;s wife Kwa Geok Choo) and Lee&#x27;s brother Lee Kim Yew (a director of Tat Lee Bank) had no influence on the MAS&#x27;s decision to grant a banking licence to Tat Lee Bank. Mortimer, while defending Jeyaretnam, said that Jeyaretnam held no responsibility for all the insinuations inferred from his words.

In January 1979, Jeyaretnam lost the case and was ordered by High Court judge Frederick Arthur Chua to pay Lee S$130,000 in damages and costs. He appealed to the Court Appeal and Judicial Committee of the Privy Council but lost both appeals and incurred up to S$500,000 in damages and costs. As a result, he had to sell his bungalow to pay the damages and costs, and move into a rental apartment.

=== 1983–1986: Convictions for making false statements ===
In December 1983, Jeyaretnam and Workers&#x27; Party chairman Wong Hong Toy were charged with falsely declaring the party&#x27;s accounts. They were also accused of defrauding Tay Boon Too, a PAP Member of Parliament whom the Workers&#x27; Party had unsuccessfully sued for defamation in 1972. The suit had been dismissed by High Court judge Frederick Arthur Chua, who had also ordered the Workers&#x27; Party to pay Tay&#x27;s legal costs amounting to S$14,000.

In early 1984, senior district judge Michael Khoo found Jeyaretnam and Wong guilty of one of the four charges they faced but acquitted them of the other three. After both the defendants and the prosecution appealed against the judgement, the case was heard in May 1984 by Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin. In April 1985, Wee found Jeyaretnam and Wong guilty of two of the three charges they had been acquitted of earlier, and fined them S$2,000 each. He also ordered a retrial for the offence of making a false declaration.

On 25 September 1985, Jeyaretnam and Wong were found guilty by a district court and each sentenced to three months&#x27; imprisonment, but they appealed against the judgement. In November 1986, High Court judge Lai Kew Chai dismissed their appeals but reduced their sentences to one month&#x27;s imprisonment and fined them S$5,000 each. Under the Singapore Constitution, a Member of Parliament has to vacate his/her seat if he/she is fined S$2,000 or more, or sentenced to a jail term of 12 months or more, so on 10 December 1986, Jeyaretnam lost his parliamentary seat.

=== 1987–1988: Disbarment and reversal ===
After Jeyaretnam completed serving his one-month jail term on 10 December 1986, the Law Society of Singapore, acting on a complaint by Attorney-General Tan Boon Teik, commenced proceedings against him under the Legal Profession Act on the grounds that he was no longer fit to practise law because of his convictions. In October 1987, a panel of three judges, including Chief Justice Wee Chong Jin, struck Jeyaretnam off the roll of advocates and solicitors of the Supreme Court, barring him from practising law in Singapore.

In October 1988, following an appeal from Jeyaretnam, the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC) reversed his disbarment, noting in their judgement: 

After the JCPC&#x27;s judgement, Jeyaretnam requested President Wee Kim Wee to remove his convictions. However, the President, constitutionally bound to act in accordance with the Cabinet&#x27;s advice, denied the request, so Jeyaretnam remained disqualified from participating in parliamentary elections until 1991.

=== 1988–1990: Defamation suit from Lee Kuan Yew ===
Although Jeyaretnam was barred from contesting in the 1988 general election due to his convictions in 1986, he still participated in the Workers&#x27; Party&#x27;s rallies during the campaigning period. In one rally speech, he questioned if the PAP government had carried out an inquiry into the death of former National Development Minister Teh Cheang Wan, who had committed suicide in December 1986 by overdosing while he was being investigated for corruption. Jeyaretnam asked how Teh had obtained the tablets he used to commit suicide, and if Prime Minister Lee Kuan Yew had responded to a letter from Teh written before his suicide.

After the election, Lee sued Jeyaretnam for slander, alleging that Jeyaretnam implied that he had abetted Teh&#x27;s suicide and covered up corruption. In August 1990, High Court judge Lai Kew Chai ruled against Jeyaretnam and ordered him to pay Lee damages of S$260,000 with interest on the amount and costs. After Jeyaretnam lost his appeal to the Court of Appeal, he attempted to appeal to the Judicial Committee of the Privy Council (JCPC) again. However, the law had been amended since the 1988 JCPC ruling in Jeyaretnam&#x27;s favour. Under the new rules, for civil cases, an appeal to the JCPC would be allowed only if all parties involved consented to it. Lee did not give his consent so Jeyaretnam could not appeal to the JCPC. All remaining appeals to the JCPC were eventually abolished from 8 April 1994 onwards.

=== 1995–2001: Defamation suits from Tamil PAP MPs and others ===
In November 1995, Jeyaretnam and the Workers&#x27; Party&#x27;s central executive committee faced two defamation suits. The first was from five PAP Members of Parliament of Tamil origin, including Foreign Affairs Minister S. Jayakumar. The second was from Indra Krishnan and members of the organising committee of the Tamil Language Week. The lawsuits came after an article published in the Workers&#x27; Party&#x27;s newsletter &quot;The Hammer&quot; implied that the plaintiffs&#x27; efforts to promote the Tamil language in Singapore had not been sincere enough.

In September 1997, Jeyaretnam and the Workers&#x27; Party agreed to pay S$200,000 in damages and costs to the five PAP Members of Parliament by six instalments. Three instalments amounting to S$100,000 were paid by February 1998.

On 30 November 1998, the High Court ordered Jeyaretnam and the Workers&#x27; Party to pay S$265,000 in damages and costs to ten plaintiffs in the second lawsuit. The Workers&#x27; Party appealed against the judgement but lost the appeal on 21 April 1999. At the time, the total sum had increased to almost S$500,000, including legal costs. Eight of the plaintiffs initiated bankruptcy proceedings against him and he was declared bankrupt in January 2001. In July 2001, Jeyaretnam appealed against his bankruptcy order and his case was heard in the Court of Appeal on 23 July 2001.

=== 1997–2001: Defamation suits from Goh Chok Tong and others ===
Following the 1997 general election, Jeyaretnam faced nine defamation suits from 11 Cabinet ministers and Members of Parliament from the PAP for speaking up in support of Workers&#x27; Party candidate Tang Liang Hong, who himself also faced 13 defamation suits. The plaintiffs included Senior Minister Lee Kuan Yew, Prime Minister Goh Chok Tong, and Deputy Prime Ministers Lee Hsien Loong and Tony Tan. The lawsuits came after Tang had accused the plaintiffs of lying when they labelled him as &quot;anti-Christian&quot; and &quot;Chinese chauvinist&quot; during the campaigning period. Jeyaretnam had also said during a rally speech, 

During the trial, which started on 18 August 1997, Jeyaretnam and Goh were represented by Queen&#x27;s Counsels George Carman and Thomas Shields respectively. On 20 August 1997, Carman accused Goh of lying and challenged his assertions that Singapore was a democracy. During cross-examination by Carman, Goh likened Jeyaretnam&#x27;s statement to throwing a Molotov cocktail. However, on further questioning, Goh also stated that &quot;it has been a good year&quot; for him and his standing as a leader had not been injured. The trial generated much public interest, with representatives from the International Commission of Jurists and Amnesty International in attendance as observers.

High Court judge S. Rajendran, who heard the case, delivered his judgement on 29 September 1997. He found Jeyaretnam&#x27;s words were non-intentional yet defamatory, but not to the extent which Goh claimed, and ordered Jeyaretnam to pay Goh damages of S$20,000 (10% of what Goh claimed) and 60% of Goh&#x27;s legal costs. The judge also said Goh should pay 40% as the case was &quot;overstated&quot; and criticised the other plaintiffs&#x27; lawyers for not consolidating their lawsuits to reduce legal costs. Goh appealed against the judgement and the damages were subsequently increased to S$100,000 plus legal costs.

The Amnesty International representatives who observed the trials said that the lawsuits were politically motivated. Goh commenced bankruptcy proceedings against Jeyaretnam after he failed to pay an instalment, but discontinued them later with S$31,000 still outstanding.

In December 2000, Lee Kuan Yew and the other plaintiffs resumed the 1997 defamation suits against Jeyaretnam which had not been heard in court yet. Jeyaretnam attempted to have those lawsuits dismissed, but his application was turned down so he appealed to the Court of Appeal, which heard the case on 25 July 2001.

==== Leaking of the police reports to the press ====
On 25 April 2019, former SPH journalist Bertha Henson revealed in a blog post that the police reports which Tang Liang Hong made in 1997 had been unofficially forwarded by the Singapore Police Force to &quot;The New Paper&quot;, which published them. After Tang and Jeyaretnam were sued for defamation, Henson and &quot;The New Paper&quot; editor P. N. Balji realised that they had inadvertently spread the allegedly defamatory words to more people, meaning that the plaintiffs could have sought more damages if they had won the lawsuits.

The following day, Kenneth Jeyaretnam called Henson&#x27;s confession &quot;brave&quot; and said that it &quot;provided &quot;prima facie&quot; evidence of corruption&quot; in the 1997 lawsuits against his father. He also said that the unauthorised leaks had allowed the plaintiffs to claim aggravated damages, and that his father&#x27;s lawyer George Carman could have used the unauthorised leaks in his defence.

=== 2001–2007: Bankruptcy ===
On 23 and 25 July 2001, the Court of Appeal dismissed two bankruptcy appeals from Jeyaretnam after he failed to pay instalments on time for the damages arising from the earlier defamation lawsuits. As undischarged bankrupts are barred from serving in Parliament, Jeyaretnam lost his seat as a Non-constituency Member of Parliament on 25 July 2001. He was also disbarred.

To pay off his debts, Jeyaretnam went onto the streets to sell copies of two books he wrote: &quot;Make It Right for Singapore&quot; and &quot;The Hatchet Man of Singapore&quot;. The first book contains the texts of some of his parliamentary speeches from 1997 to 1999, while the second describes his trials. In 2003, he told the Associated Press that he had managed to sell as many as 10 copies of &quot;The Hatchet Man of Singapore&quot; each time he went out, and that the first 2,000 copies had been almost sold out.

In May 2007, Jeyaretnam was discharged from bankruptcy after he paid the remaining sum of S$233,255.78 owed to his creditors.

== J B Jeyaretnam Foundation ==
On 5 January 2021, a charity tentatively named &quot;J B Jeyaretnam Foundation&quot; was set up to focus on poverty relief among marginalised groups.

== Personal life ==
Jeyaretnam met his wife, Margaret Cynthia Walker, while they were both studying law in London. Walker joined Jeyaretnam in Singapore in 1956 and they married in February 1957. She died of cancer in 1980. They had two sons, Kenneth Jeyaretnam and Philip Jeyaretnam. Kenneth Jeyaretnam, a former hedge fund manager, has been the secretary-general of the Reform Party since 2009. Philip Jeyaretnam, a Senior Counsel, has been a judge of the Supreme Court since 2021 and was the president of the Law Society from 2004 to 2007.

== Death ==
Jeyaretnam was rushed to Tan Tock Seng Hospital in the early morning of 30 September 2008 after he complained that he had difficulties breathing. The doctors were unable to revive him and he died of heart failure at the age of 82.

== In media ==
In 2001, three lecturers from Ngee Ann Polytechnic made a 15-minute documentary about Jeyaretnam after they met him while he was selling books on the streets. At the time, they did not know that he was a prominent opposition politician, and had not obtained official approval from Ngee Ann Polytechnic to make the documentary. The film was going to be screened at the Singapore International Film Festival in April 2002. However, the documentary was in violation of the Films Act, which bans the making, distribution and showing of films containing &quot;wholly or partly either partisan or biased references to or comments on any political matter.&quot; As a result, it was withdrawn from the film festival and the three lecturers apologised.

<text>Turhan Pasha Përmeti (19 December 1846 – 18 February 1927) was an Albanian politician and statesman who served as the second prime minister of Albania, serving from March 1914 to September 1914 and from December 1918 to January 1920. He was also in service of the Ottoman state and held the title of Pasha of the Ottoman Empire.

Among the Ottoman posts he occupied were Governor of Crete 1895 and 1896, and ambassador in Saint Petersburg. He was a fluent Greek speaker and considered a capable though rather indecisive administrator. His governorship of Crete ended with the insurrection of May 24, 1896 that eventually led to the loss of the island by the Ottoman Empire. Përmeti represented the Ottoman Empire as its delegate at the Second Hague Peace Conference of 1907.

On 17 March 1914, he was appointed as Prime Minister and Minister of Foreign Affairs by Prince Wied, in the so-called Definitive Government. He became Albania&#x27;s second prime minister succeeding Ismail Qemali. Përmeti remained foreign minister until May 28, 1914, then replaced by Prenk Bib Doda, who himself was succeeded by Mehmed Konica in July. Përmeti&#x27;s contemporaries argued that, because he had lacked affiliation with the Albanian national cause, he was not familiar with the needs of Albanians. His premiership was interrupted by Albanian discontent twice. He was overthrown by Essad Toptani in 1914, and then by the Congress of Lushnjë in 1920.

== Political career ==
Përmeti served as the second prime minister of Albania from 14 March 1914 to 3 September 1914 and on a second term from 25 December 1918 to 29 January 1920.

The composition of government was proposed since the first session of the meetings. Përmeti&#x27;s government of the Principality of Albania (25 December 1918 – 29 January 1920) included Prenk Bib Doda, Mufid Libohova, Luigj Bumçi, Mustafa Merlika-Kruja, Mihal Turtulli, Mehmed Konica, Sami Vrioni, Mid&#x27;hat Frashëri, Luigj Gurakuqi, Lef Nosi, Fejzi Alizoti and also Petro Poga.

<text>St Mary&#x27;s Isle (also known as Conister Rock or the Tower of Refuge, Manx: &quot;Kione y Sker&quot; or &quot;Creg Voirrey&quot;) is a partially submerged reef in Douglas Bay on the Isle of Man. Prior to 1832 the rock was the property of the Quane family until John Quane, Attorney General of the Isle of Man, presented the rock to Sir William Hillary, in his capacity as President of the Isle of Man District of the Royal National Lifeboat Institution to build the Tower of Refuge. Since then the custody of St Mary&#x27;s Isle has been held by each president of the local lifeboat association.

The reef is not far from the ferry terminal. Its eastern part, the Conister Shoals, had to be blasted away when a new harbour breakwater was built in the early 1980s. The rocks are only fully submerged at spring high tides; they can be accessed very briefly on foot at low spring tides.

==Etymology==
Conister is a corruption of the Manx meaning the &#x27;head of the reef&#x27;.

==&quot;St George&quot; rescue==
On Friday 19 November 1830, under the command of Lieutenant John Tudor R.N., the packet steamer &quot;St George&quot; arrived in Douglas from Liverpool with mail and passengers.

The &quot;St George&quot; belonged to the Saint George Steam Packet Company of Liverpool and at that time was engaged in competition with the newly established Isle of Man Steam Packet Company.

Once her passengers and mail were unloaded, the &quot;St George&quot; proceeded to take her anchorage in the vicinity of Conister Rock using the fixed chain cable which had been secured for the task. The night was stormy, with strong gusts of wind from the southwest which increased in ferocity as the wind backed to the southeast on the morning of November 20. At 05:00hrs the chain cable holding the &quot;St George&quot; began to give way and she began to drive in between the Pollock and Conister rocks.

Steam had been kept up during the night, with the crew at their stations, but the force of the sea together with the ship&#x27;s proximity to the Conister Rock meant she struck the rock before any attempt to back her out could prove successful. The &quot;St George&quot; struck the rock violently, immediately filled and settled down forward, with her head to the land and lying almost broadside to the most rugged part of the rock.

Lieutenant Tudor immediately ordered distress signals to be made as well as the foremast to be cut away with a view to forming a raft so as that when the dawn came they might be rescued by boats from the lee side of the vessel, but this was found to be impractical. From his home at the Fort Anne, Sir William Hillary observed the disaster taking place and immediately made for the pier in order to initiate a rescue. Together with Lt Robinson (RN), William Corlett (agent for the St George Steamship Company), Issac Vondy his coxswain, and a volunteer crew of 14 Sir William set out to render assistance.

On approaching the &quot;St George&quot; the lifeboat&#x27;s anchor was let go to the windward, and by veering down upon the wreck an attempt was made to take off the people from the weather quarter, but the surf would not enable this to be carried out. The lifeboat was then backed between the &quot;St George&quot; and the rocks, and despite warnings from Lt Tudor of the dangers this would present to the lifeboat, the crew of the lifeboat persevered and were initially successful. The lifeboat had now got into a situation where the rolling sea was causing it to become swamped and began to sustain damage with the rudder being disabled and six out of the ten oars either broken or lost. Coupled to this, Sir William, Corlett and two boatmen had been washed overboard.

Corlett and the two boatmen were swiftly got back into the boat, but Sir William, unable to swim, seized a rope which was hung from the vessel&#x27;s side by which he was able to support himself until Lt Tudor assisted by Lt Robinson managed to get a badly injured Sir William aboard. 
From the disabled state of the boat and the loss of the oars it became impossible to take off the people and proceed windward by hauling up her anchor, as was originally intended. Any route to the leeward was blocked by the rigging of the mast which had been cut away and this left the lifeboat hemmed in between the wreck, the Conister Rock and by a point of rock which ran out beyond it.

The situation of the crews of the &quot;St George&quot; and the lifeboat remained perilous for two hours, a critical situation, but after time the rigging of the fallen mast was cut away with knives and an axe which were fortunately in the boat.
The size of the swell increased as the tide rose and now swept the decks of the &quot;St George&quot; nearly burying the lifeboat, and one last effort was made to extricate themselves from a situation which at any time could have proved fatal.

The crew of the &quot;St George&quot; consisted of 22 and the lifeboat 18. They finally all managed to get into the lifeboat, by now taking a large quantity of water which had to be constantly bailed out by the use of buckets which had been taken from the &quot;St George&quot;. With the use of the remaining oars the lifeboat was cast off and the cable cast away, but she struck violently on the low ridge of the rock, filled, and striking again was washed over, leaving her occupants holding on by ropes. 
The cable was then cut, and the sea coming round the bow of the &quot;St George&quot; drove the lifeboat broadside on, upon the sheltered side of the Conister Rock thus avoiding the potential catastrophe, and they were then able to proceed towards the shore a quarter of a mile away.

They were met by two boats which had put out from the pier and proceeded through the sound to approach them under the shelter of the lee of the rock. Some of the &quot;St George&#x27;s&quot; crew were transferred into the first boat, and the other boat, commanded by Lt Sleigh R.N. was able to get a line to the lifeboat and thus take it successfully in tow to the beach. None of the forty men involved were lost.

A memorial depicting the rescue can now be seen in the sunken garden on Loch Promenade, Douglas.

A subsequent financial gift of £50 was given to Sir William by the owners of the &quot;St George&quot; in 1833 to be distributed amongst the lifeboat&#x27;s crew.

==The Tower of Refuge==
The structure was built upon the reef on the orders of Sir William Hillary (who helped to found the Royal National Lifeboat Institution) in 1832. After several shipwrecks upon the semi-submerged rock, he wanted a refuge for survivors until help could arrive. Sir William, who personally contributed a high proportion of the costs, secured a substantial number of public contributions for funding the building. The owner of the private islet was persuaded to give their permission for the refuge. After its construction, the building was stocked with provisions such as bread and fresh water for any shipwrecked persons. The tower originally housed a bell for summoning of help.

The refuge, which was built to look like a castle, was designed by local architect John Welch who was also responsible for the design of other landmark buildings in the Isle of Man.

The tower was the subject of a poem by Wordsworth:
COMPOSED OR SUGGESTED DURING A TOUR IN THE SUMMER OF 1833
XV
ON ENTERING DOUGLAS BAY, ISLE OF MAN
:&quot;Dignum laude virum Musa vetat mori.&quot;

:THE feudal Keep, the bastions of Cohorn,
:Even when they rose to check or to repel
:Tides of aggressive war, oft served as well
:Greedy ambition, armed to treat with scorn
:Just limits; but yon Tower, whose smiles adorn
:This perilous bay, stands clear of all offence;
:Blest work it is of love and innocence,
:A Tower of refuge built for the else forlorn.
:Spare it, ye waves, and lift the mariner,
:Struggling for life, into its saving arms!
:Spare, too, the human helpers! Do they stir
:&#x27;Mid your fierce shock like men afraid to die?
:No; their dread service nerves the heart it warms,
:And they are led by noble HILLARY.

NOTE

14 &#x27;And they are led by noble Hillary.&#x27;

The TOWER OF REFUGE, an ornament to Douglas Bay, was erected chiefly through the humanity and zeal of Sir William Hillary; and he also was the founder of the lifeboat establishment at that place; by which, under his superintendence, and often by his exertions at the imminent hazard of his own life, many seamen and passengers have been saved.

<text>In mathematics, a Colombeau algebra is an algebra of a certain kind containing the space of Schwartz distributions. While in classical distribution theory a general multiplication of distributions is not possible, Colombeau algebras provide a rigorous framework for this.

Such a multiplication of distributions has long been believed to be impossible because of L. Schwartz&#x27; impossibility result, which basically states that there cannot be a differential algebra containing the space of distributions and preserving the product of continuous functions. However, if one only wants to preserve the product of smooth functions instead such a construction becomes possible, as demonstrated first by Colombeau.

As a mathematical tool, Colombeau algebras can be said to combine a treatment of singularities, differentiation and nonlinear operations in one framework, lifting the limitations of distribution theory. These algebras have found numerous applications in the fields of partial differential equations, geophysics, microlocal analysis and general relativity so far .

Colombeau algebras are named after French mathematician Jean François Colombeau.

== Schwartz&#x27; impossibility result ==

Attempting to embed the space formula_1 of distributions on formula_2 into an associative algebra formula_3, the following requirements seem to be natural:

# formula_1 is linearly embedded into formula_5 such that the constant function formula_6 becomes the unity in formula_5,
# There is a partial derivative operator formula_8 on formula_5 which is linear and satisfies the Leibniz rule,
# the restriction of formula_8 to formula_1 coincides with the usual partial derivative,
# the restriction of formula_12 to formula_13 coincides with the pointwise product.

However, L. Schwartz&#x27; result implies that these requirements cannot hold simultaneously. The same is true even if, in 4., one replaces formula_14 by formula_15, the space of formula_16 times continuously differentiable functions. While this result has often been interpreted as saying that a general multiplication of distributions is not possible, in fact it only states that one cannot unrestrictedly combine differentiation, multiplication of continuous functions and the presence of singular objects like the Dirac delta.

Colombeau algebras are constructed to satisfy conditions 1.–3. and a condition like 4., but with formula_13 replaced by formula_18, i.e., they preserve the product of smooth (infinitely differentiable) functions only.

== Basic idea ==

The Colombeau Algebra is defined as the quotient algebra

:formula_19

Here the algebra of &quot;moderate functions&quot; formula_20 on formula_21 is the algebra of families of smooth &quot;regularisations&quot; (&quot;fε&quot;)

:formula_22
of smooth functions on formula_21
(where R+ = (0,∞) is the &quot;regularization&quot; parameter ε), such that for all compact subsets &quot;K&quot; of formula_21 and all multiindices α, there is an &quot;N&quot; &gt; 0 such that

:formula_25

The ideal formula_26 of &quot;negligible functions&quot; is defined in the same way but with the partial derivatives instead bounded by O(&quot;ε+N&quot;) for all &quot;N&quot; &gt; 0.

== Embedding of distributions ==
The space(s) of Schwartz distributions can be embedded into the &quot;simplified&quot; algebra by (component-wise) convolution with any element of the algebra having as representative a &quot;δ-net&quot;, i.e. a family of smooth functions formula_27 such that formula_28 in &quot; D&#x27; &quot; as &quot;ε&quot; → 0.

This embedding is non-canonical, because it depends on the choice of the δ-net. However, there are versions of Colombeau algebras (so called &quot;full&quot; algebras) which allow for canonical embeddings of distributions. A well known &quot;full&quot; version is obtained by adding the mollifiers as second indexing set.

<text>Louis Zukofsky (January 23, 1904 – May 12, 1978) was an American poet. He was the primary instigator and theorist of the so-called &quot;Objectivist&quot; poets, a short lived collective of poets who after several decades of obscurity would reemerge around 1960 and become a significant influence on subsequent generations of poets in America and abroad.

==Life==
Louis Zukofsky was born in New York City&#x27;s Lower East Side to Yiddish speaking immigrants from Lithuania, then part of the Russian Empire. His father Pinchos (ca. 1860–1950) immigrated to the United States in 1898, and was followed in 1903 by his wife, Chana (1862–1927), and their three children. Pinchos worked as a pants-presser and night watchman for many decades in New York&#x27;s garment district. 

The only one of his siblings born in the United States, Louis Zukofsky was a precocious student in the local public school system. As a boy he frequented the nearby Yiddish theatres on the Bowery, where he saw classic works by Shakespeare, Ibsen, Strindberg, and Tolstoy performed in Yiddish. Zukofsky began writing poetry at an early age, and his earliest known publications were in the student literary journal of Stuyvesant High School, from which he graduated at age 15. While when young he translated from the modern Yiddish poetry of Yehoash (Solomon Blumgarten), there is no indication he ever considered writing in Yiddish himself. 

Beginning shortly before his 16th birthday in January 1920, Zukofsky attended Columbia University&#x27;s undergraduate men&#x27;s college and Graduate School of Arts and Sciences, where he studied English. Some of his teachers and classmates subsequently emerged as important lodestars of midcentury literature and culture, namely Mark Van Doren (who maintained a lifelong acquaintance with Zukofsky despite lambasting him as a &quot;painfully inarticulate soul&quot; in a 1927 article), John Dewey, John Erskine, Lionel Trilling and Mortimer Adler (who may have enjoined Zukofsky to study the humanities instead of engineering). He joined the Boar&#x27;s Head Society and published in the &quot;Morningside&quot;, a student literary journal. Although he was elected to Phi Beta Kappa upon completing nearly all of the undergraduate curriculum in three and a half years, much like Adler, Zukofsky did not receive a Columbia College degree after dropping out of the required physical education course. Nevertheless, he was admitted to the Graduate School, receiving an M.A. in 1924 with a thesis on Henry Adams. He would publish a revised version of this thesis as &quot;Henry Adams: A Criticism in Autobiography&quot; in the journal &quot;Pagany&quot;, and Adams would remain a significant intellectual influence on Zukofsky&#x27;s work. One of Zukofsky&#x27;s closest friends during the 1920s was his Columbia classmate, Whittaker Chambers, and throughout the 1930s he aligned himself with Marxism, although he never joined the Communist Party. Despite his academic success, Zukofsky was not offered an instructorship that may have facilitated the completion of a Ph.D. or an eventual tenure-track academic appointment; according to a retrospective 2002 analysis by Mark Scroggins, &quot;Then as now, writing one&#x27;s thesis on a recently dead and as yet uncanonized figure (Adams had died only six years before) was not the path to academic preferment [...] [Zukofsky&#x27;s inability to secure an instructorship] might have been a matter of personality: quiet and withdrawn, Zukofsky no doubt seemed less than promising teaching material. And the unwritten code of anti-Semitism that reigned in the English department--and that would not be broken until Lionel Trilling was hired in 1939--almost certainly told against him. At any rate, Zukofsky&#x27;s formal schooling ended in 1924, and he would make no attempt to continue to the doctorate.&quot;

During the 1930-31 academic year, Zukofsky taught English at the University of Wisconsin–Madison, the only time he lived outside the New York City metropolitan area. In 1934, Zukofsky began work as a researcher with the Works Projects Administration (WPA), and over the course of the rest of the decade he worked on various WPA projects, most notably the Index of American Design, a history of American material culture. In the same year, he met Celia Thaew (1913–1980) and they married in 1939; their only child, Paul Zukofsky (1943–2017), was a child prodigy violinist and went on to become a prominent avant-garde violinist and conductor. During World War II, Zukofsky edited technical manuals at a number of electronics companies working in support of the war effort. In 1947, he took a job as an instructor in the English Department of the Polytechnic Institute of Brooklyn, where he would remain until his retirement at the rank of associate professor in 1965. He subsequently was a visiting professor at the University of Connecticut.

Throughout most of the 1940s and 1950s, the Zukofskys lived in Brooklyn Heights, then from 1964 to 1973 in Manhattan, and finally they retired to the Suffolk County outer suburb of Port Jefferson, New York, where he completed his magnum opus &quot;A&quot; and his last major work, the highly compressed poetic sequence &quot;80 Flowers&quot;. Just a few months after completing the latter work and proof-reading the complete &quot;A&quot;, Zukofsky died on May 12, 1978. He had been awarded National Endowment for the Arts Grants in 1967 and 1968, the National Institute of Arts and Letters &quot;award for creative work in literature&quot; in 1976, and an honorary doctorate from Bard College in 1977.

==Early career==

As a student Zukofsky wrote prolifically in imitation of many styles, both traditional and free verse. However, his first distinctive work was the long poem, &quot;Poem beginning &#x27;The,&#x27;&quot; composed in 1926 and published by Ezra Pound in his journal &quot;The Exile&quot; in 1928. Demonstrating a precocious assimilation of modernist styles, this is an autobiographical portrait of the young poet. The poem satirizes the older modernists for their pessimism, particularly T.S. Eliot&#x27;s &quot;The Waste Land&quot;, examines his cultural identity and the question of assimilation as the son of immigrant Jews, and concludes by asserting his poetic independence from the claims of family and his Jewish heritage, opting instead for a more cosmopolitan poetic identity. Pound remained an important supporter of Zukofsky in the following years, famously dedicating &quot;Guide to Kulchur&quot; (1938) &quot;To Louis Zukofsky and Basil Bunting strugglers in the desert.&quot; Their relationship over the course of the 1930s became severely strained because of Pound&#x27;s increasingly strident fascism and anti-semitism, yet Zukofsky always maintained the highest regard for Pound&#x27;s poetic abilities.

===&quot;Objectivist&quot; Poets===

Pound put Zukofsky in contact with William Carlos Williams, who would remain a major supporter of and influence on the younger poet. Williams found Zukofsky to be a valuable critic and editor of his own work, which he acknowledge by dedicating &quot;The Wedge&quot; (1944) to &quot;L.Z.&quot;. Pound persuaded the editor of &quot;Poetry&quot; magazine, Harriet Monroe, to allow Zukofsky to edit an issue showcasing younger poets, resulting in the famous &quot;Objectivists&quot; issue (Feb. 1931), which included Zukofsky&#x27;s statement &quot;Sincerity and Objectification.&quot; Although all the poets, including Zukofsky, denied any intention of forming a distinct poetic movement, a core group became identified as the Objectivist poets, which included besides Zukofsky, his friends Charles Reznikoff, George Oppen and Carl Rakosi, and Lorine Niedecker as well as Pound&#x27;s friend and protégé Basil Bunting. Zukofsky edited &quot;An &quot;Objectivists&quot; Anthology&quot; (1932), published by George Oppen&#x27;s To, Publishers, and for a brief spell there was the collective The Objectivist Press, but the group attracted only limited attention at the time.

===&quot;A&quot;===

Zukofsky&#x27;s major work was the very long poem &quot;A&quot;—he never referred to it without the quotation marks—which he began in 1928 and would work on intermittently for most of the rest of his life, finally completing the poem in 1974. He predetermined that the work would have 24 sections, which he called movements, but both formally and thematically he allowed the poem to develop as the occasion dictated. &quot;A&quot;-1 opens at a performance of Bach&#x27;s St. Matthew Passion, whose fugal intricacies became one of the formal models for the poem. The first six movements are predominately autobiographical but all directly or indirectly considering the question of the proper form for the poem at hand—&quot;A&quot;-6 ends by posing the question: &quot;With all this material / To what distinction—.&quot; The preliminary answer is &quot;A&quot;-7, often taken to be Zukofsky&#x27;s first distinctly individual poem that looks forward to much that will follow. This movement is a set of seven sonnets which focus on sawhorses marking off an area of a street under repair, which are imaginatively animated, a dynamic image of the poem itself as a construction site simultaneously constructed and deconstructed. In a number of later movements, Zukofsky would similarly adopt strict traditional forms combined with unconventional materials to create highly compacted poems: &quot;A&quot;-9 takes the intricate form of Guido Cavalcanti&#x27;s canzone, &quot;Donna me prega,&quot; using content mostly adapted from Karl Marx&#x27;s &quot;Capital&quot;. A related major poem, although outside of &quot;A&quot;, is &quot;&#x27;Mantis&#x27;&quot; which adopts the form of a sestina by Dante to create a political lyric, to which Zukofsky added &quot;An Interpretation&quot; reflecting on the question of poetic form relevant to contemporary concerns. In counterpoint to these highly formal and compacted movements, there are sprawling free-verse movements, notably &quot;A&quot;-8, whose depiction of contemporary world interviews vignettes of the Great Depression with the writings of Marx, Lenin and Henry Adams on American history. Much of Zukofsky&#x27;s work of the 1930s attempted to bring together modernist formalism with a Leftist political perspective. &quot;A&quot;-10 is a cry of despair in response to the fall of France in June 1940 structured on Bach&#x27;s &quot;Mass in B minor&quot;, after which Zukofsky paused work on &quot;A&quot; for some years.

===Other early writings===

In tandem with &quot;A&quot;, Zukofsky continued writing shorter poems throughout his life, although he had difficulties publishing outside of journals during the Depression era. His first collection of shorter poems, &quot;55 Poems&quot;, did not appear until 1941, although it represented work completed by the mid-1930, including &quot;Poem beginning &#x27;The&#x27;&quot; and &quot;&#x27;Mantis.&#x27;&quot; Another collection, &quot;Anew&quot;, came out in 1946. In the mid-1930s he also wrote his only play, &quot;Arise, Arise&quot;, a political dream play, which however remained unperformed and unpublished until the 1960s. During the same period he wrote a work of experimental prose, &quot;Thanks to the Dictionary&quot;, improvising with the vocabulary and definitions found in the dictionary. In the early 1940s he attempted more conventional short stories, of which the novella length &quot;Ferdinand&quot; is the most significant. One of Zukofsky&#x27;s most eccentric works was &quot;Le Style Apollinaire/The Writing of Guillaume Apollinaire&quot; (1934), which was ghost written for his friend René Taupin, presenting three approaches to the body of Apollinaire&#x27;s work in large part through the presentation and arrangement of quotations. Throughout much of the 1930s Zukofsky worked on a poetry textbook, &quot;A Test of Poetry&quot;, after the manner of Pound&#x27;s &quot;ABC of Reading&quot;, primarily juxtaposing sample poems or excerpts with little commentary and asking to student to draw their own conclusions. Although initially this text only saw the light of day when self-published in 1948, it has since been reprinted three times. 

==Later career==

In 1948, Zukofsky returned to &quot;A&quot; after a hiatus of eight years with the second half of &quot;A&quot;-9, which again copies the complex form of Cavalcanti&#x27;s canzone, but now using content primarily derived from Spinoza&#x27;s &quot;Ethics&quot;. The distinct concerns of the two-halves of &quot;A&quot;-9 mark a decisive shift of emphasis from the political and social to the more personal and philosophical, but without repudiating the earlier focus. Avoiding pre-determined narratives or themes, Zukofsky always intended that &quot;A&quot;&#x27;s development would be determined by historical and personal changes over the time of the poem&#x27;s composition. This was affirmed with &quot;A&quot;-11, which mimics the form of a ballata by Cavalcanti but directly addresses his wife and son on the topic of mortality. From this point the poet&#x27;s immediate family will usually play a major role while the poem becomes more expansive in its concerns. This movement was shortly followed up with &quot;A&quot;-12, a sprawling 135-page collage interweaving the personal, current events and philosophy, primarily represented by Aristotle, Paracelsus and Spinoza. However, at the time there was little chance that he could publish a work on this scale, and &quot;A&quot;-12 did not appear complete until the first book publication of &quot;&quot;A&quot; 1–12&quot; in 1959. Much of the 1950s was preoccupied with another very large-scale work, &quot;Bottom: on Shakespeare&quot;, which began as an essay growing out of a summer course on Renaissance literature he taught at Hamilton College in 1947 but grew into a massive critical meditation on Shakespeare, arguing for the priority of the sensuous eye over the abstract mind. This work was as much a statement on poetics as a exegesis of Shakespeare presented in the unorthodox critical manner Zukofsky preferred, marshalling and collaging large numbers of quotations from numerous texts. When finally published in 1964, &quot;Bottom&quot; was accompanied by a companion volume consisting of Celia Zukofsky&#x27;s musical setting of Shakespeare&#x27;s play &quot;Pericles, Prince of Tyre&quot;.

Since the 1930s, Zukofsky worked in obscurity and found it difficult to publish, but gradually from the mid-1950s younger poets, most notably Robert Duncan and Robert Creeley, began to seek him out because of their desire to reconnect with the more innovative strands of poetic modernism developing from Pound and Williams. The poets and editors Cid Corman and Jonathan Williams published major works in the late 1950s, especially the first book publication of &quot;A&quot; by Corman&#x27;s Origin Press. Along with the other &quot;Objectivists&quot;, from around 1960 Zukofsky was in considerable demand among these younger poets, and consequently was able to publish numerous volumes over the last decade and half of his life, a period when he wrote prolifically and inventively. 

With the completion of &quot;Bottom&quot;, Zukofsky returned to &quot;A&quot; with &quot;A&quot;-13, a &quot;partita&quot; in five sub-sections using a range of different forms. The late, mostly long, movements of &quot;A&quot; are characterized by the adoption of a diversity of flexible forms capable of absorbing great variation of materials, from the conversational, to newspapers and media, to book reading, and the treatment of these materials ranges from quotation to radical reduction to creative transmutation, including homophonic transcription. A sense of the everyday is interwoven with contemporary events, with &quot;A&quot;-15 responding to the assassination of President Kennedy and &quot;A&quot;-18 darkened by the trauma of the Vietnam War. In contrast to the usually long movements, &quot;A&quot;-16 is just four words scattered across a single page, while &quot;A&quot;-17 is a homage to William Carlos Williams on his death in 1963 in the form of a catalogue of quotations recording the two poets&#x27; friendship. &quot;A&quot;-21 is a complete and quirky translation of Plautus&#x27; play &quot;Rudens&quot; (The Rope) interspersed with additional &quot;Voice offs&quot; of Zukofsky&#x27;s invention. In 1968, Celia Zukofsky presented her husband with an elaborate musical assemblage: against the musical score of Handel&#x27;s &quot;Hapsichord Pieces&quot; she arranged four voices consisting entirely of quotations from across Zukofsky&#x27;s writings, suggesting one possible version of a single total work. Zukofsky promptly decided this would be the final movement of &quot;A&quot;, although he still had two further movement to write. &quot;A&quot;-22 &amp; -23 were conceived on an epic scale: each 1000 lines, with an 800-line main body framed by 100-line segments, the main bodies each compressed radically reworked materials from history and literature respectively spanning 6000 years in chronological order. In this late work the soundscape tends to predominate over thematic or narrative orders, or as he once put it, &quot;not to fathom time but literally to sound it as on an instrument.&quot;

Another major work that preoccupied Zukofsky for much of the 1960s was the controversial &quot;Catullus&quot;, a homophonic translation from Latin done in collaboration with his wife of the entire existent works of Catullus. Although it outraged many when first published, this has been one of the most discussed and debated of Zukofsky&#x27;s works. He also finished a novel begun in the early 1950s, &quot;Little&quot;, an autobiographical account centered on a child violin prodigy, based on his son Paul. Aside from &quot;A&quot;, several collections of mostly short poems were published in the late 1950s and early 1960s, and particularly notable is the long poem &quot;4 Other Countries&quot; included in &quot;Barely and widely&quot; (1958), a travelogue of the Zukofskys&#x27; 1957 trip to Europe, written in a more relaxed and accessible manner than is typical of his poetry. As his reputation rose, Zukofsky collected short poetry in two volumes (1965, 1966) was published by Norton, his first books with a commercial publisher. Soon after his collected critical essay were gathered into &quot;Prepositions&quot; (1968). On finally completing &quot;A&quot; in 1974, Zukofsky promptly started on his last major work, &quot;80 Flowers&quot;, a sequence of eighty-one short poems (8 lines of five words each), highly compressed reworkings of botanical and literary materials. Although planned for completion for his 80th birthday, he as usual worked ahead of schedule and finished the sequence in January 1978, already planning a follow-up sequence on trees to be entitled &quot;Gamut: 90 trees&quot;. However, he only composed the epigraph to this latter work when he died in May 1978.

==Legacy==

Although Zukofsky and the &quot;Objectivists&quot; would have little impact in the 1930s, their later rediscovery around 1960 would have a major influence on a broad range of younger poets known as the New American Poets. This was particularly the case because most of the &quot;Objectivists&quot; produced their most mature and innovative work during the 1960s and 1970s, which in many respects represented a salutatory formal emphasis that contrasted with the looseness of most Beat and projectivist verse. Aside from Duncan and Creeley, among the many American poets who have acknowledged the influence of Zukofsky in their work include Theodore Enslin, Ronald Johnson, John Taggart and Michael Palmer. In the 1970s, Zukofsky&#x27;s formalism was a major model for many of the Language poets, and the prominent Language writer, Charles Bernstein, edited a volume of selected poems for the Library of America (2006). 

During his lifetime, Zukofsky had some contact and interaction with Augusto de Campos and the Brazilian Concrete poetry movement. French poets in particular have been attracted to Zukofsky&#x27;s example. Anne-Marie Albiach composed an intricate and much admired translation of &quot;A&quot;-9 in 1970, which helped bring Zukofsky to French attention. Other French poets engaged in translating Zukofsky include Jacques Roubaud and Pierre Alféri. A complete French translation of &quot;A&quot; (except for &quot;A&quot;-24) by François Dominique and Serge Gavronsky came out to considerable acclaim in 2020.

<doc id="363527" wikidata="Q1062210" url="?curid=363527" title="Lamaze technique">
<text>The Lamaze technique, also known as the psychoprophylactic method or simply Lamaze, began as a prepared childbirth technique. As an alternative to medical intervention during childbirth, it was popularized in the 1950s by French obstetrician Fernand Lamaze and based on his observations in the Soviet Union. The goal of Lamaze is to build a mother&#x27;s confidence in her ability to give birth, through classes that help pregnant women understand how to cope with pain in ways that both facilitate labor and promote comfort, including relaxation techniques, movement, and massage.

There is a training and certification program available to practitioners, leading to the Lamaze Certified Childbirth Educator (LCCE) designation.

==History==
Fernand Lamaze visited the Soviet Union in the 1950s, and was influenced by birthing techniques which involved breathing and relaxation methods. The Lamaze method gained popularity in the United States after Marjorie Karmel wrote about her experiences in her 1959 book &quot;Thank You, Dr. Lamaze&quot;, as well as Elisabeth Bing&#x27;s book &quot;Six Practical Lessons for an Easier Childbirth&quot; (1960). Both Karmel and Bing would later found the American Society for Psychoprophylaxis in Obstetrics in 1960, later renamed to Lamaze International.

==Criticism==
Lamaze himself has been criticized for being over-disciplinary and anti-feminist. Natural childbirth activist Sheila Kitzinger&#x27;s description of the methods he deployed while working in a Paris clinic during the 1950s expresses concern regarding &quot;the disciplinary nature&quot; of Lamaze&#x27;s approach to childbirth. According to Kitzinger, Lamaze consistently ranked the women&#x27;s performance in childbirth from &quot;excellent&quot; to &quot;complete failure&quot; on the basis of their &quot;restlessness and screams&quot;. Those who &quot;failed&quot; were, he thought, &quot;themselves responsible because they harbored doubts or had not practiced sufficiently&quot;, and &quot;intellectual&quot; women who &quot;asked too many questions&quot; were considered by Lamaze to be the most &quot;certain to fail&quot;.

The Lamaze technique has also been criticized for being ineffective.

<doc id="363529" wikidata="Q5569" url="?curid=363529" title="Kierspe">
<text>Kierspe () is a town in the district Märkischer Kreis, in North Rhine-Westphalia, Germany. It is located at the western edge of the Sauerland on Volme River.

==History==
The first mention of Kierspe was in 1003, when the castle &#x27;Haus Rhade&#x27; was first mentioned in a manuscript. On this basis Kierspe celebrated its 1000th anniversary in 2003. Around 1490 Kierspe became the seat of the &quot;Heilige Feme&quot;, an independent jury of commoners with the right to mete out the death penalty. Such &quot;Feme&quot; juries were common in Westphalia at the time.

In 1968, as part of the reorganization of the former district Altena, the city of Kierspe was formed by merging the &quot;Amt&quot; of Kierspe with the municipality of Rönsahl. On 1 January 1969 Kierspe officially obtained city rights.

==Coat of arms==
The city&#x27;s coat of arms was derived from the former coat of arms of the &quot;Amt&quot;. It combines symbols for both of the member municipalities - Kierspe and Rönsahl - separated by the red-white checkered bar of the counts of the Mark. On the bottom of the coat of arms is a red lion with blue claws and tongue, the symbol of the counts of Berg and taken from the coat of arms of Rönsahl. On the top is a &quot;Rauk&quot;, a raven. It refers to the nickname given to young recruits, who imitated the sound of the raven when first wearing their blue uniform during mustering. The coat of arms was granted to the &quot;Amt&quot; on 20 August 1936, and to the city on 29 July 1969. It was designed by Otto Hupp.

The coat of arms of the municipality Kierspe was similar to the one of the Amt, except the bottom was a blank yellow field. It was granted on 17 October 1935. The coat of arms of the municipality Rönsahl had Saint Servatius in the top, the patron saint of the church in Rönsahl.

==Population development==


==International relations==
Kierspe has been twinned with the French town Montigny-le-Bretonneux since 1988. The partnership developed from a long-lasting student exchange of the &quot;Gesamtschule Kierspe&quot; with a high school in Montigny-le-Bretonneux.

The town is twinned with Denton, Greater Manchester, which is also twinned with Montigny-le-Bretonneux. A delegation from Denton arrived in April 2012 to discuss the twinning, which eventually took place in a ceremony in Denton on 22 September 2012. There was a large town festival including the planting of a German Linden tree in the town&#x27;s park.

==Connections with Britain==
For a number of years the Gesamtschule Kierspe had an English Partnerschule in the form of St. Aidan&#x27;s C of E High School in Harrogate, and exchanges would take place between British Year 10 pupils studying German and pupils at the Gesamtschule of a similar age. This came to an end in the last few years as St. Aidan&#x27;s changed its system for teaching modern languages and eschewed the exchange link for a trip to the Rhineland for the Year 9 pupils. However, Year 12s from the school still go to Kierspe for two-week-long work experiences.

* Roger Schmidt (born 1967), football coach

<text>In mathematics, a characteristic class is a way of associating to each principal bundle of &quot;X&quot; a cohomology class of &quot;X&quot;. The cohomology class measures the extent to which the bundle is &quot;twisted&quot; and whether it possesses sections. Characteristic classes are global invariants that measure the deviation of a local product structure from a global product structure. They are one of the unifying geometric concepts in algebraic topology, differential geometry, and algebraic geometry.

The notion of characteristic class arose in 1935 in the work of Eduard Stiefel and Hassler Whitney about vector fields on manifolds.

==Definition==

Let &quot;G&quot; be a topological group, and for a topological space formula_1, write formula_2 for the set of isomorphism classes of principal &quot;G&quot;-bundles over formula_1. This formula_4 is a contravariant functor from Top (the category of topological spaces and continuous functions) to Set (the category of sets and functions), sending a map formula_5 to the pullback operation formula_6.

A characteristic class &quot;c&quot; of principal &quot;G&quot;-bundles is then a natural transformation from formula_4 to a cohomology functor formula_8, regarded also as a functor to Set.

In other words, a characteristic class associates to each principal &quot;G&quot;-bundle formula_9 in formula_2 an element &quot;c&quot;(&quot;P&quot;) in &quot;H&quot;*(&quot;X&quot;) such that, if &quot;f&quot; : &quot;Y&quot; → &quot;X&quot; is a continuous map, then &quot;c&quot;(&quot;f&quot;*&quot;P&quot;) = &quot;f&quot;*&quot;c&quot;(&quot;P&quot;). On the left is the class of the pullback of &quot;P&quot; to &quot;Y&quot;; on the right is the image of the class of &quot;P&quot; under the induced map in cohomology.

==Characteristic numbers==
Characteristic classes are elements of cohomology groups; one can obtain integers from characteristic classes, called characteristic numbers. Some important examples of characteristic numbers are Stiefel–Whitney numbers, Chern numbers, Pontryagin numbers, and the Euler characteristic.

Given an oriented manifold &quot;M&quot; of dimension &quot;n&quot; with fundamental class formula_11, and a &quot;G&quot;-bundle with characteristic classes formula_12, one can pair a product of characteristic classes of total degree &quot;n&quot; with the fundamental class. The number of distinct characteristic numbers is the number of monomials of degree &quot;n&quot; in the characteristic classes, or equivalently the partitions of &quot;n&quot; into formula_13.

Formally, given formula_14 such that formula_15, the corresponding characteristic number is:
:formula_16

where formula_17 denotes the cup product of cohomology classes.
These are notated variously as either the product of characteristic classes, such as formula_18, or by some alternative notation, such as formula_19 for the Pontryagin number corresponding to formula_20, or formula_21 for the Euler characteristic.

From the point of view of de Rham cohomology, one can take differential forms representing the characteristic classes, take a wedge product so that one obtains a top dimensional form, then integrate over the manifold; this is analogous to taking the product in cohomology and pairing with the fundamental class.

This also works for non-orientable manifolds, which have a formula_22-orientation, in which case one obtains formula_22-valued characteristic numbers, such as the Stiefel-Whitney numbers.

Characteristic numbers solve the oriented and unoriented bordism questions: two manifolds are (respectively oriented or unoriented) cobordant if and only if their characteristic numbers are equal.

==Motivation==

Characteristic classes are phenomena of cohomology theory in an essential way — they are contravariant constructions, in the way that a section is a kind of function &quot;on&quot; a space, and to lead to a contradiction from the existence of a section one does need that variance. In fact cohomology theory grew up after homology and homotopy theory, which are both covariant theories based on mapping &quot;into&quot; a space; and characteristic class theory in its infancy in the 1930s (as part of obstruction theory) was one major reason why a &#x27;dual&#x27; theory to homology was sought. The characteristic class approach to curvature invariants was a particular reason to make a theory, to prove a general Gauss–Bonnet theorem.

When the theory was put on an organised basis around 1950 (with the definitions reduced to homotopy theory) it became clear that the most fundamental characteristic classes known at that time (the Stiefel–Whitney class, the Chern class, and the Pontryagin classes) were reflections of the classical linear groups and their maximal torus structure. What is more, the Chern class itself was not so new, having been reflected in the Schubert calculus on Grassmannians, and the work of the Italian school of algebraic geometry. On the other hand there was now a framework which produced families of classes, whenever there was a vector bundle involved.

The prime mechanism then appeared to be this: Given a space &quot;X&quot; carrying a vector bundle, that implied in the homotopy category a mapping from &quot;X&quot; to a classifying space &quot;BG&quot;, for the relevant linear group &quot;G&quot;. For the homotopy theory the relevant information is carried by compact subgroups such as the orthogonal groups and unitary groups of &quot;G&quot;. Once the cohomology formula_24 was calculated, once and for all, the contravariance property of cohomology meant that characteristic classes for the bundle would be defined in formula_25 in the same dimensions. For example the Chern class is really one class with graded components in each even dimension.

This is still the classic explanation, though in a given geometric theory it is profitable to take extra structure into account. When cohomology became &#x27;extraordinary&#x27; with the arrival of K-theory and cobordism theory from 1955 onwards, it was really only necessary to change the letter &quot;H&quot; everywhere to say what the characteristic classes were.

Characteristic classes were later found for foliations of manifolds; they have (in a modified sense, for foliations with some allowed singularities) a classifying space theory in homotopy theory.

In later work after the &quot;rapprochement&quot; of mathematics and physics, new characteristic classes were found by Simon Donaldson and Dieter Kotschick in the instanton theory. The work and point of view of Chern have also proved important: see Chern–Simons theory.

==Stability==
In the language of stable homotopy theory, the Chern class, Stiefel–Whitney class, and Pontryagin class are &quot;stable&quot;, while the Euler class is &quot;unstable&quot;.

Concretely, a stable class is one that does not change when one adds a trivial bundle: formula_26. More abstractly, it means that the cohomology class in the classifying space for formula_27 pulls back from the cohomology class in formula_28 under the inclusion formula_29 (which corresponds to the inclusion formula_30 and similar). Equivalently, all finite characteristic classes pull back from a stable class in formula_31.

This is not the case for the Euler class, as detailed there, not least because the Euler class of a &quot;k&quot;-dimensional bundle lives in formula_32 (hence pulls back from formula_33, so it can&#x27;t pull back from a class in formula_34, as the dimensions differ.

<doc id="363531" wikidata="Q66568" url="?curid=363531" title="Kanpur">
<text>Kanpur ( ), formerly anglicized as Cawnpore, is the largest city of the Indian state of Uttar Pradesh. It was the primary financial and commercial centre of northern India. Founded in the year 1207 by Rajput ruler Raja Kanh Deo, Kanpur became one of the most important commercial and military stations of British Raj. Kanpur had been the major financial and industrial centre of northern India and also the ninth-largest urban economy in India. Today it is famous for its colonial architecture, gardens, sweets, dialect, and high-quality leather, plastic and textile products which are exported mainly to the West. Kanpur is also the financial capital of Uttar Pradesh (formerly North-Western Provinces).

The city is home to historical monuments such as the Jajmau Ghat which dates back to the 17th century AD. Kanpur is also home to several historical sites such as the Kanpur Museum, Bhitargaon Temple, European Cemetery and Nanarao Park.

It is the 12th most populous city and the 11th most populous urban agglomeration in India (&quot;Census of India, 2011&quot;). Kanpur was an important British garrison town until 1947, when India gained independence. The urban district of Kanpur &quot;Nagar&quot; serves as the headquarters of the Kanpur Division, Kanpur Range and Kanpur Zone.

Some of the more popular places in Kanpur include J.K. Temple, Z Square Mall, Blue World Amusement Park, Atal Ghat, Green Park Stadium and Ganga Barrage.

It was the most populous urban city in the 2011 Indian census and the largest urban agglomeration in Uttar Pradesh while the population of city and its suburbs were around 5 million, making it the eighth-most populous metropolitan area in India.

== History ==
In 1207, Raja Kanha-deo of the Kanhpuriya clan of Rajputs established the city of Kanhpur and made it his capital, which later came to be known as Kanpur.

The area was ruled by several rulers of Kannauj, such as Harsha Vardhan, Jai Chand and Mihir Bhoja. It was also ruled by Muslim rulers of the Sur dynasty. In May 1765, Shuja-ud-daula, the Nawab of Awadh, was defeated by the British near Jajmau. From 1773 to 1801, Kanpur was part of the Oudh Kingdom, followed by the treaty of 1801 between Nawab Saadat Ali Khan of Awadh and the British, who realized the strategic importance. Several European businessmen established themselves in Kanpur, during this time.

With the first woollen mill of India, commonly known as the Lal Imli (, for a brand produced by the mill) by the British India Corporation established here in 1876 by Alexander MacRobert. The eastern and northern façades of the mill are reminiscent of the Palace of Westminster, due to their architecture, proximity to the Ganges river and with the north-east corner of the mill being topped by a clock tower similar to Big Ben in London. This similarity underscores the city&#x27;s importance and prestige during the British times, which extends till date; making the Lal Imli — a great highlight of the city. The city is also widely regarded as the &quot;Leather City of the World&quot; and is predominantly nicknamed as the &quot;Manchester of the East&quot;, for its chemical, textile and leather industries. Alexander MacRobert has an area named after him in the city, McRobertganj.

=== 1857 Uprising ===
In the 19th century, Cawnpore was an important British garrison with barracks for 7,000 soldiers. During the Indian Rebellion of 1857, 900 British men, women and children were besieged in the fortifications for 22 days by rebels under Nana Sahib. They surrendered on the agreement that they would get safe passage to the nearby Sati Chaura Ghat whereupon they would board barges and be allowed to go by river to Allahabad.

Though controversy surrounds what exactly happened at the Sati Chaura Ghat, and who fired the first shot, it is known that, soon afterwards, the departing British were shot at by the sepoys and were either killed or captured. Some of the British officers later claimed that the sepoys had, on purpose, placed the boats as high in the mud as possible, to cause delay. They also claimed that Nana Sahib&#x27;s camp had previously arranged for the sepoys to fire upon and to kill all of the English. Although the East India Company later accused Nana Sahib of betrayal and murder of innocent people, no evidence has ever been found to prove that Nana Sahib had planned or ordered the massacre. Some historians believe that the Sati Chaura Ghat massacre was the result of confusion and not of any plan implemented by Nana Sahib or of his associates. Lieutenant Mowbray Thomson, one of the four male survivors of the massacre, believed that the rank-and-file sepoys who spoke to him did not know of the killing to come.

Many were killed and the remaining 200 British women and children were brought back to shore and sent to a building called the Bibighar (&quot;House of the Ladies&quot;). After some time, the commanders of the rebels decided to kill their hostages. The rebel soldiers refused to carry out orders and butchers from the nearby town were brought in to kill the hostages three days before the British entered the city on 18 July. The dismembered bodies were thrown into a deep well nearby. The British, under General Neill, retook the city and committed a series of retaliations against the rebel sepoys and those civilians caught in the area, including women, children and old men. The Cawnpore massacre, as well as similar events elsewhere, were seen by the British as justification for unrestrained vengeance. &quot;Remember Cawnpore&quot; became a British war cry for the rest of the war.

== Geography ==

Kanpur is located at in the central-western part of the state of Uttar Pradesh. The city lies at a distance of approx 475 km from national-capital New Delhi and approx 90 km from the state-capital Lucknow. It is a part of the historical region of Awadh.

Situated in the flat Indo-Gangetic Plains, Kanpur has an average elevation of 318 m above sea level. The Ganges flows by the city and several ghats are located on its banks, notably the Sati Chaura Ghat and Sarsaiya Ghat. The Brahmavart Ghat located at Bithoor (25 km northwards) is another ghat of religious importance.

Several parks and recreational areas are located in Kanpur. Nana Rao Park and Phool Bagh are among the prominent parks in city that exist from the time of British Raj. The Moti Jheel, a rectangular lake, was originally developed as a drinking water reservoir. The lake has now been developed as a recreational area with a landscaped garden and a children&#x27;s park. Nawabganj Bird Sanctuary is also located near Kanpur.

=== Climate ===

Like most of lowland northern India, Kanpur has a monsoon-influenced humid subtropical climate (&quot;Cwa&quot;) bordering on a hot semi-arid climate (&quot;BSh&quot;) under the Köppen climate classification.

 Kanpur has been ranked 5th best “National Clean Air City” (under Category 1 &gt;10L Population cities) in India.

== Demographics ==

As per the provisional results of 2011 census, Kanpur Nagar district has a population of 4,581,000. The literacy rate was 79.65 per cent and sex ratio was 862. There are 35 Parsis in Kanpur with their Fire temple at The Mall. Hinduism is a majority in Kanpur with a sizeable minority of Muslims. Sikhs, Christians and Buddhists are below 2 percent.

Although final data of census 2023 is yet to be declared, population of Kanpur Nagar District is projected as 63,67,963 in year 2023 (estimation as per aadhar ‘UIDAI’ data).

As per 2011 Census, population of Kanpur City and its suburbs was 30,15,645 making it the largest urban agglomeration of Uttar Pradesh. Thereafter, urban area of Kanpur City has expanded to a large extent. However, limits of its urban area are still pending for approval by the Government. Tentatively population of Kanpur City and Kanpur metropolitan area in 2024 is projected as 39,26,000 and 51,00,000 respectively as per the data available so far.

<doc id="363533" wikidata="Q183074" url="?curid=363533" title="Juana Inés de la Cruz">
<text>Juana Inés de Asbaje y Ramírez de Santillana, better known as Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz (12 November 1651 – 17 April 1695), was a New Spain (considered Mexican by many authors) writer, philosopher, composer and poet of the Baroque period, as well as a Hieronymite nun, nicknamed &quot;&quot;The Tenth Muse&quot; and &quot;The Phoenix of America&quot;&quot; by her contemporary critics. As a Spanish-criolla from New Spain, she was among the main American-born contributors to the Spanish Golden Age, alongside Juan Ruiz de Alarcón and Garcilaso de la Vega &quot;el Inca&quot;, and is considered one of the most important female authors in Spanish language literature and the literature of Mexico.

Sor Juana&#x27;s significance to different communities has varied greatly across time, having been presented as a candidate for Catholic sainthood; a symbol of Mexican nationalism; and a paragon of freedom of speech, women&#x27;s rights, and sexual diversity, making her a figure of great controversy and debate to this day.

==Life==

===Early life===
Juana was born in San Miguel Nepantla (presently &quot;Nepantla de Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz&quot;) near Mexico City as the illegitimate daughter of Don Pedro Manuel de Asuaje y Vargas-Machuca (1602-1680), a Spanish navy captain from the Canary Islands involved in colonial transatlantic shipping and trade, and Doña Isabel Ramírez de Santillana y Rendón (1626-1690), a distinguished criolla, whose father leased the &quot;Hacienda de Panoayan&quot;, near Mexico City.There are two different baptism registrations that have been attributed to her, one under the name of &quot;Juana&quot; in 1648, and another one under the name of &quot;Inés&quot; in 1651, still a matter of academic research and debate. There is, nevertheless, agreement that she was one of the three children that Doña Isabel Ramírez de Santillana had out of wedlock with Don Pedro de Asuaje. Since Sor Juana’s father left her life at an early age and remained largely unknown to her, Sor Juana&#x27;s infancy occurred entirely around her mother&#x27;s family in the &quot;hacienda&quot; of Panaoyan, in Amecameca, leased by her maternal grandfather, and home to the ample Ramírez de Santillana family. Among her relatives, several women with the name &quot;Inés&quot; have been noted, including her grandmother Inés de Brenes, her maternal-aunt Inés Ramírez de Santillana, and her first-cousin Inés de Brenes y Mendoza, married to a grandson of Antonio de Saavedra Guzmán, the first ever published American-born poet.

Later described as a child prodigy, Sor Juana was educated at home at the &quot;Hacienda de Papaya&quot;, being exposed to Latin and Nahuatl, and learning philosophy, and mathematics. She was given free access to her grandfather&#x27;s private library.

During her childhood, Inés often hid in the &quot;hacienda&quot; chapel to read her grandfather&#x27;s books from the adjoining library, something forbidden to girls. By the age of three, she had learned how to read and write Latin. By the age of five, she reportedly could do accounts. At age eight, she composed a poem on the Eucharist. By adolescence, Inés had mastered Greek logic, and at age thirteen she was teaching Latin to young children. For long it was thought that she also learned Nahuatl, an Aztec language, and wrote short poems in that language as a child, but this has been challenged by more recent scholarship.

In 1664, at the age of 16, Inés was sent to live in Mexico City. She asked her mother&#x27;s permission to disguise herself as a male student so that she could enter the university there, without success. Without the ability to obtain a formal education, Juana continued her studies privately. Her family&#x27;s influential position had gained her the position of lady-in-waiting at the colonial viceroy&#x27;s court, where she came under the tutelage of the Vicereine &quot;Donna&quot; Eleonora del Carretto, a member of one of Italy&#x27;s most prominent families, and wife of the Viceroy of New Spain Don Antonio Sebastián de Toledo, Marquis of Mancera. The viceroy Marquis de Mancera, wishing to test the learning and intelligence of the 17-year-old, invited several theologians, jurists, philosophers, and poets to a meeting, during which she had to answer many questions unprepared and explain several difficult points on various scientific and literary subjects. The manner in which she acquitted herself astonished all present and greatly increased her reputation. Her literary accomplishments garnered her fame throughout New Spain. She was much admired in the viceregal court, and she received several proposals of marriage, which she declined.

After joining a nunnery in 1667, Sor Juana began writing poetry and prose dealing with such topics as love, women&#x27;s rights, and religion. She turned her nun&#x27;s quarters into a salon, visited by New Spain&#x27;s female intellectual elite, including &quot;Doña&quot; Eleonora del Carreto, Marchioness of Mancera, and &quot;Doña&quot; Maria Luisa Gonzaga, Countess of Paredes de Nava, both &quot;Vicereines&quot; of the New Spain, among others. Her criticism of misogyny and the hypocrisy of men led to her condemnation by the Bishop of Puebla, and in 1694 she was forced to sell her collection of books and focus on charity towards the poor. She died the next year, having caught the plague while treating her sisters.

== Religious life and name change ==
In 1667, she entered the Monastery of St. Joseph, a community of the Discalced Carmelite nuns, as a postulant, where she remained but a few months. Later, in 1669, she entered the monastery of the Hieronymite nuns, which had more relaxed rules, where she changed her name to Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz, probably in reference to Sor Juana de la Cruz Vázquez Gutiérrez who was a Spanish nun whose intellectual accomplishments earned her one of the few dispensations for women to preach the gospel. Another potential namesake was Saint Juan de la Cruz, one of the most accomplished authors of the Spanish Baroque. She chose to become a nun so that she could study as she wished since she wanted &quot;to have no fixed occupation which might curtail my freedom to study.&quot;

In the convent and perhaps earlier, Sor Juana became intimate friends with Don Carlos de Sigüenza y Góngora, who visited her in the convent&#x27;s locutorio. She stayed cloistered in the Convent of Santa Paula of the Hieronymite in Mexico City from 1669 until her death in 1695, and there she studied, wrote, and collected a large library of books. The Viceroy and Vicereine of New Spain became her patrons; they supported her and had her writings published in Spain. She addressed some of her poems to paintings of her friend and patron María Luisa Manrique de Lara y Gonzaga, daughter of Vespasiano Gonzaga, Duca di Guastala, Luzara e Rechiolo and Inés María Manrique, 9th Countess de Paredes, which she also addressed as Lísida.
In November 1690, the bishop of Puebla, Manuel Fernández de Santa Cruz published, under the pseudonym of Sor Filotea, and without her permission, Sor Juana&#x27;s critique of a 40-year-old sermon by Father António Vieira, a Portuguese Jesuit preacher. Although Sor Juana&#x27;s intentions for the work, called &quot;Carta Atenagórica&quot; are left to interpretation, many scholars have opted to interpret the work as a challenge to the hierarchical structure of the Catholic Church. Along with &quot;Carta Atenagórica,&quot; the bishop also published his own letter in which he said she should focus on religious instead of secular studies. He published his criticisms to use them to his advantage against the priest, and while he agreed with her criticisms, he believed that as a woman, she should devote herself to prayer and give up her writings.

In response to her critics, Sor Juana wrote a letter, &quot;Respuesta a Sor Filotea de la Cruz&quot; (&quot;Reply to Sister Philotea&quot;), in which she defended women&#x27;s right to formal education. She also advocated for women&#x27;s right to serve as intellectual authorities, not only through the act of writing, but also through the publication of their writing. By putting women, specifically older women, in positions of authority, Sor Juana argued, women could educate other women. Resultingly, Sor Juana argued, this practice could also avoid potentially dangerous situations involving male teachers in intimate settings with young female students. In 1691, she was reprimanded and ordered to stop writing after the exposure of a private letter in which she wrote of the right of women to education.

In addition to her status as a woman in a self-prescribed position of authority, Sor Juana&#x27;s radical position made her an increasingly controversial figure. She famously remarked by quoting an Aragonese poet and echoing St. Teresa of Ávila: &quot;One can perfectly well philosophize while cooking supper.&quot; In response, Francisco de Aguiar y Seijas, Archbishop of Mexico joined other high-ranking officials in condemning Sor Juana&#x27;s &quot;waywardness.&quot; In addition to opposition she received for challenging the patriarchal structure of the Catholic Church, Sor Juana was repeatedly criticized for believing that her writing could achieve the same philanthropic goals as community work.

By 1693, she seemingly ceased writing to avoid risking official censure. Although there is no undisputed evidence of her renouncing her writing, there are documents showing her agreeing to undergo penance. Her name is affixed to such a document in 1694, but the tone of the supposed handwritten penitentials is in rhetorical and autocratic, in contrast to her normally lyrical style. One is signed &quot;Yo, la Peor de Todas&quot; (&quot;I, the worst of all women&quot;). She is said to have sold all her books, then an extensive library of more than 4,000 volumes, as well as her musical and scientific instruments. Other sources report that her defiance toward the Church led to the confiscation of all of her books and instruments, although the bishop himself agreed with the contents of her letters.

Of more than one hundred unpublished works, only a few of her writings have survived, which are known as the &quot;Complete Works&quot;. According to Octavio Paz, her writings were saved by the vicereine.

She died after ministering to other nuns stricken during a plague, on 17 April 1695. Sigüenza y Góngora delivered the eulogy at her funeral.&lt;section end=&quot;Modern&quot; criticism=&quot; of=&quot; the=&quot; catholic=&quot; church=&quot; transclusion=&quot; /&gt;

==Works==
=== Poetry ===

====&quot;First Dream&quot;====
&quot;First Dream&quot;, a long philosophical and descriptive &quot;silva&quot; (a poetic form combining verses of 7 and 11 syllables), deals with the shadow of night beneath which a person falls asleep in the midst of quietness and silence. There night and day animals participate, either dozing or sleeping, all urged to silence and rest by Harpocrates. The person&#x27;s body ceases its ordinary operations, which are described in physiological and symbolical terms, ending with the activity of the imagination as an image-reflecting apparatus: the Pharos. From this moment, her soul, in a dream, sees itself free at the summit of her own intellect; in other words, at the apex of a pyramid-like mount, which aims at God and is luminous.

There, perched like an eagle, she contemplates the whole creation, but fails to comprehend such a sight in a single concept. Dazzled, the soul&#x27;s intellect faces its own shipwreck, caused mainly by trying to understand the overwhelming abundance of the universe, until reason undertakes that enterprise, beginning with each individual creation, and processing them one by one, helped by the ten categories of Aristotle.

The soul cannot get beyond questioning herself about the traits and causes of a fountain and a flower, intimating perhaps that his method constitutes a useless effort, since it must take into account all the details, accidents, and mysteries of each being. By that time, the body has consumed all its nourishment, and it starts to move and wake up, soul and body are reunited. The poem ends with the Sun overcoming Night in battle between luminous and dark armies, and with the poet&#x27;s awakening.

==== Love poetry ====
Sor Juana&#x27;s first volume of poetry, {{lang|es|Inundación castálida}}, was published in Spain by the Vicereine Maria Luisa Manrique de Lara y
Gonzága, Countess of Paredes, Marquise de la Laguna. Many of her poems dealt with the subject of love and sensuality. Colombian-American translator Jaime Manrique described her poetry thus: &quot;her love poems are expressions of a complex and ambivalent modern psyche, and because they are so passionate and ferocious that when we read them we feel consumed by the naked intensity she achieves.&quot; One of Sor Juana&#x27;s sonnets:

=== Hombres Necios (Sátira Filosófica) or You foolish men (Philosophical satire) ===
Sor Juana&#x27;s &quot;Hombres Necios (Foolish men)&quot;, written in the 1680s, is among the first proto-feminist literary works in the Americas that explores the double standards of men while also accusing men of trying to diminish a woman&#x27;s honor. During seventeenth-century Mexico the society was heavily patriarchal, but Sor Juana managed to publish this work, which added to the backlash she would eventually face from the Church. Yet Sor Juana was driven by a conviction for women&#x27;s education and was determined to apply her writing to challenge those who believed a woman&#x27;s intellectual abilities were irrelevant.

Erin Elizabeth details how Sor Juana structured the poem to be centered on accusations onto men that elevate the meaning behind the poem. Sor Juana emphasizes the male irrationality with a man&#x27;s ability and behavior to harm a woman by deeming her as &quot;impure&quot; by ruining her honor and reputation. Sor Juana does this by casting the blame on men arguing that they are the root cause of their mistakes and create problems for women to avoid their own mistakes. Elizabeth argues that by utilizing impurity and the concept of &quot;fall from grace&quot;, &quot;Hombres Necios&quot; implores the double standards men use on women that creates a path for women leaving them in situations they cannot win. While also including the names of Thais and Lucretia along with the concept of prostitution to add on how men use women and leave them helpless with nothing but the blame and hatred.

Hombres necios explored the idea of why women were frequently held guilty for the sins that men incited onto them. Sor Juana expresses her voice through the use of the Baroque literary style, which was prevalent at her time, in a manner that can be understood. Today it is often seen as a pro-feminist love letter, and even in a &quot;machista&quot; Latin American society it has been popular among the population.

==== Dramas ====
In addition to the two comedies outlined here (&quot;House of Desires&quot; Los empeños de una casa]) and &quot;Love is but a Labyrinth&quot; ([Amor es mas laberinto]), Sor Juana is attributed as the author of a possible ending to the comedy by Agustin de Salazar: &quot;The Second Celestina&quot; (La Segunda Celestina). In the 1990s, Guillermo Schmidhuber found a release of the comedy that contained a different ending than the otherwise known ending. He proposed that those one thousand words were written by Sor Juana. Some literary critics, such as Octavio Paz, Georgina Sabat-Rivers, and Luis Leal) have accepted Sor Juana as the co-author, but others, such as Antonio Alatorre and José Pascual Buxó, have refuted it.

=== Comedies ===
Scholars have debated the meaning of Juana&#x27;s comedies. Julie Greer Johnson describes how Juana protested against the rigorously defined relationship between genders through her full-length comedies and humor. She argues that Juana recognized the negative view of women in comedy which was designed to uphold male superiority at the expense of women. By recognizing the power of laughter, Juana appropriated the purpose of humor, and used it as a socially acceptable medium with which to question notions of men and women.

Pawns of a House

The work was first performed on October 4, 1683, during the celebration of the Viceroy Count of Paredes’ first son&#x27;s birth. Some critics maintain that it could have been set up for the Archbishop Francisco de Aguiar y Seijas’ entrance to the capital, but this theory is not considered reliable.

The story revolves around two couples who are in love but, by chance of fate, cannot yet be together. This comedy of errors is considered one of the most prominent works of late baroque Spanish-American literature. One of its most peculiar characteristics is that the driving force in the story is a woman with a strong, decided personality who expresses her desires to a nun. The protagonist of the story, Dona Leonor, fits the archetype perfectly.

It is often considered the peak of Sor Juana&#x27;s work and even the peak of all New-Hispanic literature. &quot;Pawns of a House&quot; is considered a rare work in colonial Spanish-American theater due to the management of intrigue, representation of the complicated system of marital relationships, and the changes in urban life.

Love is but a Labyrinth

The work premiered on February 11, 1689, during the celebration of the inauguration of the viceroyalty Gaspar de la Cerda y Mendoza. However, in his Essay on Psychology, Ezequiel A. Chavez mentions Fernandez del Castillo as a coauthor of this comedy.

The plot takes on the well-known theme in Greek mythology of Theseus: a hero from Crete Island. He fights against the Minotaur and awakens the love of Ariadne and Phaedra. Sor Juana conceived Theseus as the archetype of the baroque hero, a model also used by her fellow countryman Juan Ruiz de Alarcón. Theseus&#x27;s triumph over the Minotaur does not make Theseus proud, but instead allows him to be humble.

=== Music ===
Besides poetry and philosophy, Sor Juana was interested in science, mathematics and music. The latter represents an important aspect, not only because musicality was an intrinsic part of the poetry of the time but also for the fact that she devoted a significant portion of her studies to the theory of instrumental tuning that, especially in the Baroque period, had reached a point of critical importance. So involved was Sor Juana in the study of music, that she wrote a treatise called &quot;El Caracol&quot; (which is lost now) that sought to simplify musical notation and solve the problems that Pythagorean tuning suffered.

In the writings of Juana Inés, it is possible to detect the importance of sound. We can observe this in two ways. First of all, the analysis of music and the study of musical temperament appears in several of her poems. For instance, in the following poem, Sor Juana delves into the natural notes and the accidentals of musical notation:

&lt;poem&gt;
Propiedad es de natura
que entre Dios y el hombre media,
y del cielo el be cuadrado
junto al be bemol de la tierra.
(Villancico 220)
&lt;/poem&gt;

Professor Sarah Finley argues that the visual is related with patriarchal themes, while the sonorous offers an alternative to the feminine space in the work of Sor Juana. As an example of this, Finley points out that Narciso falls in love with a voice, and not with a reflection.

===Other notable works===

One musical work attributed to Sor Juana survives from the archive of Guatemala Cathedral. This is a 4-part villancico, &quot;Madre, la de los primores&quot;.

Other works include &quot;Hombres Necios&quot; (Foolish Men), and &quot;The Divine Narcissus&quot;.

Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz wrote a letter to her Confessor, Antonio Núñez de Miranda, titled &quot;Autodefensa Espiritual (Spiritual Self-Defense)&quot; in 1690&quot;,&quot; ten years before she severs ties after sending the &quot;Respuesta a Sor Filotea.&quot; However, unlike the Respuesta, the &quot;Autodefensa&quot; has much more biting and frank language used. In the &quot;Autodefensa&quot;, Sor Juana defends her intellectual pursuits and criticizes the restrictions placed on women&#x27;s education and opportunities to pursue knowledge. She argues that women have the same rational souls as men and should be able to study and engage in intellectual pursuits. In the &quot;Autodefensa&quot; letter, Sor Juana uses this more forceful and confrontational language to reprimand and dismiss her Confessor. This has led scholars to suggest that the Autodefensa was a rehearsal for the arguments she would later make in the Respuesta. In both letters, Sor Juana defends her right to pursue knowledge and critiques the restrictions placed on women&#x27;s intellectual development&quot;.&quot; Many of these themes were feminist in nature with one of the most notable being the right of women to be able to study intellectual pursuits. This theme is prevalent in the lines,

“But who has prohibited women private and individual studies? Do they not have a rational soul like men? Why should it then not enjoy within them the privilege of enlightenment in an education? Is it not as capable of earning God’s glory and grace as yours? Why should it not be capable of such news and science, a trifle? What divine revelation, what determination of the Church, what dictate of reason made for us such a severe law?” (translated from Tapia Mendez 1993).

Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz&#x27;s Autodefensa Espiritual and Respuesta a Sor Filotea are considered some of the most significant feminist writings of the 17th century. Her advocacy for women&#x27;s intellectual rights was particularly groundbreaking, as women in her time were often restricted from pursuing academic and intellectual pursuits. Sor Juana&#x27;s writings challenged patriarchal structures and called for greater gender equality and opportunities for women to pursue their passions. Sor Juana&#x27;s writings were not only feminist but also expressed her thoughts on politics and religion. She was known for her strong defense of her beliefs and refusal to be silenced, which resulted in her being criticized by the Church and other powerful figures of her time. Despite facing backlash and opposition, Sor Juana continued to write and publish her works. Her work continues to inspire feminists and scholars today, and she is celebrated as a feminist icon and a leading voice in Latin American literature and intellectual thought. Sor Juana&#x27;s writing also had a significant impact on the development of Mexican literature and culture, and she is considered a national treasure in Mexico.

== Translations and interpretations ==
Octavio Paz is credited with re-establishing the importance of the historic Sor Juana in modern times, and other scholars have been instrumental in translating Sor Juana&#x27;s work to other languages. The only translations of &quot;Carta Atenagorica&quot; are found in &quot;Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz: Selected Writings&quot; by Pamela Kirk Rappaport and &quot;The Tenth Muse: Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz&quot; by Fanchon Royer. Translations of Sor Juana&#x27;s &quot;La Respuesta&quot; are credited to Electa Arenal and Amanda Powell, Edith Grossman, Margaret Seyers Peden, and Alan S. Trubeblood. These translations are respectively found in &quot;The Answer/La Respuesta, Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz: Selected Works&quot;, &quot;A Woman of Genius: The Intellectual Biography of Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz&quot; and &quot;Poems, Protest, and a Dream&quot;, and &quot;A Sor Juana Anthology&quot;.

Since Sor Juana&#x27;s works were rediscovered after her death, scholarly interpretations and translations are both abundant and contrasting.

=== Octavio Paz ===
Octavio Paz was a Mexican Nobel Prize laureate and scholar. In his 1982 book, &quot;Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz o las trampas de la fe&quot; (translated to English by Margaret Sayers Peden as &quot;Sor Juana: Or, The Traps of Faith&quot;), Paz examines and contemplates Sor Juana&#x27;s poetry and life in the context of the history of New Spain, particularly focusing on the difficulties women then faced while trying to thrive in academic and artistic fields. Primarily, Paz aims to explain why Sor Juana chose to become a nun. In Juana Ramírez, Octavio Paz and Diane Marting find that Sor Juana&#x27;s decision to become a nun stemmed from her refusal to marry; joining the convent, according to Paz and Marting, was a way for Juana to obtain authority and freedom without marrying.

In his analyses of Sor Juana&#x27;s poetry, Octavio Paz traces some of her influences to the Spanish writers of the Golden Age and the Hermetic tradition, mainly derived from the works of a noted Jesuit scholar of her era, Athanasius Kircher. Paz interprets Sor Juana&#x27;s most ambitious and extensive poem, &quot;First Dream&quot; (&quot;Primero Sueño&quot;), as a representation of the desire of knowledge through a number of hermetic symbols, albeit transformed in her own language and skilled image-making abilities. In conclusion, Paz makes the case that Sor Juana&#x27;s works were the most important body of poetic work produced in the Americas until the arrival of 19th-century figures such as Emily Dickinson and Walt Whitman.

=== Tarsicio Herrera Zapién ===
Tarsicio Herrera Zapién, a classical scholar, has also devoted much of his career to the study of Sor Juana&#x27;s works. Some of his publications (in Spanish) include &quot;Buena fe y humanismo en Sor Juana: diálogos y ensayos: las obras {{Not a typo|latinas}}: los sorjuanistas recientes&quot; (1984); &quot;López Velarde y sor Juana, feministas opuestos: y cuatro ensayos sobre Horacio y Virgilio en México&quot; (1984); &quot;Poemas mexicanos universales: de Sor Juana a López Velarde&quot; (1989) and &quot;Tres siglos y cien vidas de Sor Juana&quot; (1995).

=== Feminist analyses and translations ===

Scholars such as Scout Frewer argue that because Juana&#x27;s advocacy for religious and intellectual authority would now be associated with feminism, she was a protofeminist. In the twenty-first century, Latin American philosophers and scholars generally interpret Sor Juana as a feminist before the time of feminism.

For instance, scholars like Rachel O’Donnell argue that Sor Juana occupied a special place in between socially acceptable and socially unacceptable roles in seventeenth century Mexico. By examining Sor Juana intersectionally, they prioritize the context of New Spain, specifically the influence of religion, race, and social norms, in understanding Sor Juana as a female theologian and poet.

According to O’Donnell, in colonial Mexico, education was an undertaking reserved for men, especially activities like writing and reading. Consequently, scholars like Octavio Paz argue, religion became a way for women to avoid marriage. Since Sor Juana was opposed to marriage, Paz argues, entering the convent was a socially acceptable way to be a single woman in seventeenth century Mexico. Entering the convent also meant that Sor Juana could read and write about religion despite the barriers to formal education for women. O’Donnell argues that Sor Juana was called a rare bird because although theology was only an acceptable pursuit for men in the Catholic Church, she actively studied religion. Sor Juana likely perceived wisdom and religion as inseparable, so she probably also believed that to follow God was to pursue wisdom. A third perspective suggests that considering the colonial context of New Spain and Sor Juana&#x27;s background as a &quot;criolla&quot;, she represented colonial knowledge in a way that defied colonial religious structures.

Luis Felipe Fabre criticized &#x27;Sorjuanista&#x27; scholarship as a whole, arguing that the discourse is binary rather than complex and multilayered.

==== Luis Felipe Fabre ====
{{ill|Luis Felipe Fabre|es}}, a Mexican writer and scholar, ridicules other scholars, whom he collectively calls Sorjuanistas, who idolize Sor Juana. In his book, &quot;Sor Juana and Other Monsters&quot;, Fabre argues that the appropriation and recontextualization immanent in scholars&#x27; interpretations of Sor Juana construct Sor Juana as either a heretic or a lesbian. Fabre suggests that such representations constitute Sor Juana as a monstrosity or abnormality rather than as a complex woman. He suggests that rather than locating Sor Juana in a fixed identity, scholarship on Sor Juana should be a fluctuating and multilayered conversation.

==== Margaret Sayers Peden ====
Margaret Sayers Peden&#x27;s 1982 &quot;A Woman of Genius: The Intellectual Autobiography of Sor Juana Ines de la Cruz&quot;, was the first English translation of Sor Juana&#x27;s work. As well, Peden is credited for her 1989 translation of &quot;Sor Juana: Or, the Traps of Faith&quot;. Unlike other translations, Peden chose to translate the title of Sor Juana&#x27;s best known work, &quot;First Dream&quot;, as &quot;First I Dream&quot; instead. Peden&#x27;s use of first person instills authority in Sor Juana as an author, as a person with knowledge, in a male-dominated society. Peden also published her English translations of Sor Juana&#x27;s work in an anthology called &quot;Poems, Protest, and a Dream&quot;. This work includes her response to authorities censuring her, &quot;La Respuesta&quot;, and &quot;First Dream&quot;.

==== Electa Arenal and Amanda Powell ====
An equally valuable feminist analysis and interpretation of Sor Juana&#x27;s life and work is found in &quot;The Answer/La Respuesta by Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz&quot; by Electa Arenal, a Sor Juana scholar who is recognized among feminists who changed America, and Amanda Powell, a poet and translator. The original publication, released in 1994 by The Feminist Press, was re-released in an updated second edition in 2009, also by The Feminist Press. The bilingual publication includes poems, an annotated publication of Sor Juana&#x27;s response to Church officials and her impassioned plea for education of women, analysis and a bibliography. &quot;The Answer&quot; applies a valuable gender lens to Sor Juana&#x27;s writings and life. In their feminist analysis, Powell and Arenal translate the viewpoint of Sor Juana&#x27;s writing as gender-ambiguous. Released in an updated second edition in 2009, also by The Feminist Press, the bilingual publication includes poems, an annotated publication of Sor Juana&#x27;s response to Church officials and her impassioned plea for education of women, analysis and a bibliography.

==== Theresa A. Yugar ====
Theresa A. Yugar, a feminist theologian scholar in her own right, wrote her Master&#x27;s and Doctoral theses on Sor Juana. Her book, &quot;Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz: Feminist Reconstruction of Biography and Text,&quot; discusses the life of Sor Juana through a feminist lens and analysis of her texts, &quot;La Respuesta&quot; (The Answer) and &quot;El Primero Sueño&quot; (First Dream).

Yugar aims to understand why individuals in Mexico in the twenty-first century have more knowledge of Frida Kahlo than Sor Juana. She celebrates poet Octavio Paz for crossing national borders with his internationally acclaimed work on &quot;Sor Juana: Or, The Traps of Faith&quot;. However, while Paz establishes Sor Juana&#x27;s historical relevance, Yugar expands on his work to establish Sor Juana&#x27;s importance in the twenty-first century.

Yugar argues that Sor Juana is the first female bibliophile in the New World. She also argues that Sor Juana&#x27;s historic focus on gender and class equality in education (the public sphere) and the household (the private sphere), in addition to her advocacy for language rights, and the connection between indigenous religious traditions and ecological protection were paramount in the seventeenth century. Today&#x27;s similar advocacy ignores her primal position in that work which is currently exclusively associated with ecofeminism and feminist theology.

== Historical influence ==
=== Philanthropy ===
The Sor Juana Inés Services for Abused Women was established in 1993 to pay Sor Juana&#x27;s dedication to helping women survivors of domestic violence forward. Renamed the Community Overcoming Relationship Abuse (CORA), the organization offers community, legal, and family support services in Spanish to Latin American women and children who have faced or are facing domestic violence.

=== Education ===
The San Jerónimo Convent, where Juana lived the last 27 years of her life and where she wrote most of her work is today the University of the Cloister of Sor Juana in the historic center of Mexico City. The Mexican government founded in the university in 1979.

=== Political controversy ===
While Sor Juana was a famous and controversial figure in the seventeenth century, she is also an important figure in modern times.

During renovations at the cloister in the 1970s, bones believed to be those of Sor Juana were discovered. A medallion similar to the one depicted in portraits of Juana was also found, with Margarita López Portillo, the sister of President José López Portillo (1976–1982), taking possession of the relic. During the tercentennial of Sor Juana&#x27;s death in 1995, a member of the Mexican congress called on Margarita López Portillo to return the medallion. Portillo returned the medallion to Congress on November 14, 1995, with the event and description of the controversy reported in &quot;The New York Times&quot; a month later. Whether or not the medallion actually belonged to Juana, the incident sparked discussions about Juana and the abuse of official power in Mexico.

=== Contribution to feminism ===

==== Historic feminist movements ====
Amanda Powell locates Sor Juana as a contributor to the Querelles des Femmes, a three-century long literary debate about women. Central to this early feminist debate were ideas about gender and sex, and, consequently, misogyny.

Powell argues that the formal and informal networks and pro-feminist ideas of the Querelles des Femmes were important influences on Sor Juana&#x27;s work, &quot;La Respuesta&quot;. For women, Powell argues, engaging in conversation with other women was as significant as communicating through writing. However, while Teresa of Ávila appears in Sor Juana&#x27;s &quot;La Respuesta&quot;, Sor Juana makes no mention of the person who launched the debate, Christine de Pizan. Rather than focusing on Sor Juana&#x27;s engagement with other literary works, Powell prioritizes Sor Juana&#x27;s position of authority in her own literary discourse. This authoritative stance not only demonstrates a direct counter to misogyny, but was also typically reserved for men. As well, Sor Juana&#x27;s argument that ideas about women in religious hierarchies are culturally constructed, not divine, echoes ideas about the construction of gender and sex.

==== Modern feminist movements ====
Yugar connects Sor Juana to feminist advocacy movements in the twenty-first century, such as religious feminism, ecofeminism, and the feminist movement in general.

Although the current religious feminist movement grew out of the Liberation Theology movement of the 1970s, Yugar uses Sor Juana&#x27;s criticism of religious law that permits only men to occupy leadership positions within the Church as early evidence of her religious feminism. Based on Sor Juana&#x27;s critique of the oppressive and patriarchal structures of the Church of her day, Yugar argues that Sor Juana predated current movements, like Latina Feminist Theology, that privilege Latina women&#x27;s views on religion. She also cites modern movements such as the Roman Catholic Women Priest Movement, the Women&#x27;s Ordination Conference, and the Women&#x27;s Alliance for Theology, Ethics and Ritual, all of which also speak out against the patriarchal limitations on women in religious institutions.

Yugar emphasizes that Sor Juana interpreted the Bible as expressing concern with people of all backgrounds as well as with the earth. Most significantly, Yugar argues, Sor Juana expressed concern about the consequences of capitalistic Spanish domination over the earth. These ideas, Yugar points out, are commonly associated with modern feminist movements concerned with decolonization and the protection of the planet.

=== A symbol ===

==== Colonial and indigenous identities ====
As a woman in religion, Sor Juana has become associated with the Virgin of Guadalupe, a religious symbol of Mexican identity, but was also connected to Aztec goddesses. For example, parts of Sor Juana&#x27;s &quot;Villancico 224&quot; are written in Nahuatl, while others are written in Spanish. The Virgin of Guadalupe is the subject of the &quot;Villancico&quot;, but depending on the language, the poem refers to both the Virgin of Guadalupe and Cihuacoatl, an indigenous goddess. It is ambiguous whether Sor Juana prioritizes the Mexican or indigenous religious figure, or whether her focus is on harmonizing the two.

Sor Juana&#x27;s connection to indigenous religious figures is also prominent in her &quot;Loa to Divine Narcissus&quot;, (Spanish &quot;El Divino Narciso&quot;) (see Jauregui 2003, 2009). The play centers on the interaction between two Indigenous people, named Occident and America, and two Spanish people, named Religion and Zeal. The characters exchange their religious perspectives, and conclude that there are more similarities between their religious traditions than there are differences. The loa references Aztec rituals and gods, including Huitzilopochtli, who symbolized the land of Mexico.

Scholars like Nicole Gomez argue that Sor Juana&#x27;s fusion of Spanish and Aztec religious traditions in her &quot;Loa&quot; &quot;to Divine Narcissus&quot; aims to raise the status of indigenous religious traditions to that of Catholicism in New Spain. Gomez argues that Sor Juana also emphasizes the violence with which Spanish religious traditions dominated indigenous ones. Ultimately, Gomez argues that Sor Juana&#x27;s use of both colonial and indigenous languages, symbols, and religious traditions not only gives voice to indigenous peoples, who were marginalized, but also affirms her own indigenous identity.

Through their scholarly interpretations of Sor Juana&#x27;s work, Octavio Paz and Alicia Gaspar de Alba have also incorporated Sor Juana into discourses about Mexican identity. Paz&#x27;s accredited scholarship on Sor Juana elevated her to a national symbol as a Mexican woman, writer, and religious authority. On the contrary, Gaspar de Alba emphasized Sor Juana&#x27;s indigenous identity by inserting her into Chicana discourses.

==== Connection to Frida Kahlo ====
Paul Allatson emphasizes that women like Sor Juana and Frida Kahlo masculinized their appearances to symbolically complicate the space marked for women in society. Sor Juana&#x27;s decision to cut her hair as punishment for mistakes she made during learning signified her own autonomy, but was also a way to engage in the masculinity expected of male-dominated spaces, like universities. According to Paul Allatson, nuns were also required to cut their hair after entering the convent. These ideas, Allatson suggests, are echoed in Frida Kahlo&#x27;s 1940 self-portrait titled &quot;Self-Portrait with Cropped Hair&quot;, or &quot;Autorretrato con cabellos corto&quot;.

As well, the University of the Cloister of Sor Juana honored both Frida Kahlo and Sor Juana on October 31, 2018, with a symbolic altar. The altar, called &quot;Las Dos Juanas&quot;, was specially made for the Day of the Dead.

====Official recognition by the Mexican government====
In present times, Sor Juana is still an important figure in Mexico.

In 1995, Sor Juana&#x27;s name was inscribed in gold on the wall of honor in the Mexican Congress in April 1995. Sor Juana also appears on the Mexican currency obverse. She was first included on the 1000 pesos AA family bill in 1978, which was in circulation until 1992. Between 1994 and 2020, she appeared on the 200 pesos C, D, D1, and F family bills. She currently appears on the 100 pesos G bill, which has been in circulation since 2020. The town where Sor Juana grew up, San Miguel Nepantla in the municipality of Tepetlixpa, State of Mexico, was renamed in her honor as Nepantla de Sor Juana Inés de la Cruz.

<text>Notre-Dame de la Garde (; : Our Lady of the Guard), known to local citizens as &quot;la Bonne Mère&quot; (French for &#x27;the Good Mother&#x27;), is a Catholic basilica in Marseille and the city&#x27;s best-known symbol. The site of a popular Assumption Day pilgrimage, it is the most visited site in Marseille. It was built on the foundations of an ancient fort at the highest natural point in Marseille, a limestone outcropping on the south side of the Old Port of Marseille. 
Construction of the basilica began in 1853 and lasted for over 40 years. It was originally an enlargement of a medieval chapel but was transformed into a new structure at the request of Father Bernard, the chaplain. The plans were made and developed by the architect Henri-Jacques Espérandieu. It was consecrated while still unfinished on 5 June 1864. The basilica consists of a lower church or crypt in the Romanesque style, carved from the rock, and an upper church of Neo-Byzantine style decorated with mosaics. A square bell tower topped by a belfry supports a monumental statue of the Madonna and Child, made of copper gilded with gold leaf.

An extensive restoration from 2001 to 2008 included work on mosaics damaged by candle smoke, green limestone from Gonfolina which had been corroded by pollution, and stonework that had been hit by bullets during the Liberation of France. The restoration of the mosaics was entrusted to Marseille artist Michel Patrizio, whose workmen were trained in Friuli, north of Venice, Italy. The tiles were supplied by the workshop in Venice that had made the originals.

== History ==

The rocky outcrop upon which the basilica would be built is an Urgonian limestone, peak dating from the Barremian and rising to a height of 162 metres (531 ft) above sea level. Its height and proximity to the coast caused the hill to become an important stronghold and lookout point and a landmark for sailing. In 1302, Charles II of Anjou ordered one of his ministers to set beacons along the Mediterranean coast of Provence. One of the beacon sites was the hill of Notre-Dame de la Garde.

=== First chapel ===

In 1214, maître (master) Pierre, a priest of Marseille, was inspired to build a chapel dedicated to the Virgin Mary on the hill known as La Garde, which belonged to the abbey of Saint-Victor. The abbot granted him permission to plant vines, cultivate a garden and build a chapel. The chapel, completed four years later, appears in a June 18, 1218 papal bull by Pope Honorius III listing the possessions of the abbey. After maître Pierre died in 1256, Notre-Dame de la Garde became a priory. The prior of the sanctuary was also one of four claustral priors of Saint-Victor.

From the time that the chapel was founded, surviving wills showed bequests in its favour. Also, sailors who survived shipwrecks gave thanks and deposited ex-votos at Notre-Dame of the Sea in the church of Notre-Dame-du-Mont. Towards the end of the 16th century, they began going to Notre-Dame de la Garde instead.

The first chapel was replaced at the beginning of the 15th century by a larger building with a richly equipped chapel dedicated to Saint Gabriel.

== Fort and place of worship from 16th to 18th centuries ==
Charles II d&#x27;Anjou mentioned a guardpost in the 15th century, but the present basilica was built on the foundations of a 16th-century fort erected by Francis I of France to resist the 1536 siege of Marseille by the Emperor Charles V during the Italian War of 1536–38.

=== Visit of Francis I ===

On January 3, 1516, Louise of Savoy, the mother of Francis I of France, and his wife, Queen Claude of France, daughter of Louis XII, went to the south of France to meet the young king, right after from his victory at Marignan. On January 7, 1516, they visited the sanctuary. On January 22, 1516, Francis accompanied them to the chapel as well.

The king noted during his visit that Marseille was poorly defended. The need to reinforce its defenses became even more obvious in 1524 after the Constable of Bourbon and emperor Charles V lay siege to the city and almost took it. François I built two forts: one on the island of If, which became the famous Chateau d&#x27;If, the other at the top of La Garde, which included the chapel. This is the only known example of a military fort sharing space with a sanctuary open to the public.
The Chateau d&#x27;If was finished in 1531, while Notre-Dame de la Garde was not completed until 1536, when it was used to help repel the troops of Charles Quint. It was built using stone from Cap Couronne, as well as materials from buildings outside the ramparts of the demolished city to keep them from providing shelter to enemy troops. Among these was the monastery of the Mineurs brothers where Louis of Toulouse was buried near the and Cours Saint-Louis.

The fort was a triangle with two sides of approximately 75 metres and a third of 35 metres. This rather modest fort remains visible on a spur west of the basilica, which was restored in 1993 to its original state when a 1930 watch tower was removed.

Above the door can be seen a very damaged escutcheon of François I, the arms of France, three fleurs-de-lys with a salamander below. Nearby, to the right, is a rounded stone weathered by time which once represented the lamb of John the Apostle with its banner.

=== Wars of religion ===

In 1585 Hubert de Garde de Vins, chief of the Catholic League of Provence, sought to seize Marseille and combine forces with , the second consul of Marseille, and Claude Boniface, captain of the Blanquerie neighborhood. On the night of April 9, 1585, Dariès occupied La Garde, from which his guns could fire on the city. But the attack on Marseille failed, leading to the execution of Dariès and his accomplice, Boniface.

In 1591 Charles Emmanuel, Duke of Savoy, tried to seize the Abbey of Saint Victor, a stronghouse near the port. He charged Pierre Bon, baron de Méolhon, governor of Notre-Dame de la Garde, with seizing the abbey. On November 16, 1591, Méolhon did so but it was quickly retaken by , first consul of Marseille. in 1594. He sent two priests, Trabuc and Cabot, to celebrate mass in the chapel. Trabuc wore armour under his cassock and after the ceremony killed the captain of the fort. Charles de Casaulx took possession of it and named his son Fabio its governor. After the assassination of Charles de Casaulx on February 17, 1596, by , Fabio was driven out of the fort by his own soldiers.

=== Last royal visit ===
While in Marseille on November 9, 1622, Louis XIII rode in spite of the rain to Notre-Dame de la Garde. He was received by the governor of the fort, Antoine de Boyer, lord of Bandol. When the latter died on June 29, 1642, Georges de Scudéry, mainly known as a novelist, was named governor, but he did not take up his post until December 1644.

He was accompanied there by his sister, Madeleine de Scudéry, a woman of letters who gave in her letters many descriptions of the area as well as of various festivals and ceremonies. &quot;Last Friday... you could see the citadel covered from head to foot with ten or more flags, the bells of our tower swinging, and an admirable procession returning to the castle. The statue of Notre-Dame de la Garde holding in her left arm the naked child and in her right hand, a bouquet of flowers, was carried by eight shoeless penitents veiled like ghosts.&quot;

Georges de Scudéry scorned the fort and preferred to live at , the aristocratic quarter of the time. The stewardship of the fort was entrusted to a mere sergeant, named Nicolas.

In the 1650 Caze affair, the governor of Provence, the Count of Alais, opposed the Parliament of Provence in the Fronde and wanted to put down the revolt in Marseilles. Since La Garde was a desirable strategic position, he bribed Nicolas and on August 1, 1650, installed there one of his men, David Caze. He hoped to support an attack by galleys from Toulon, a city faithful to him. The consuls of Marseille reacted to this threat by forcing David Caze to leave the fort.

=== 18th century ===
In 1701, the Dukes of Burgundy and of Berry, grandsons of Louis XIV, visited the sanctuary. Sébastien Vauban, who succeeded Louis Nicolas de Clerville, the builder of , studied ways to improve Marseilles&#x27; defences. On April 11, 1701, he presented an imposing proposal for a vast enclosure connecting Fort Saint Nicolas to Notre-Dame de la Garde and continuing to the plaine Saint-Michel, currently Place Jean-Jaurès, and the quay d&#x27;. This project was not followed through.

During the Great Plague of Marseille, which killed 100,000 people in Marseille in 1720, the bishop Henri de Belsunce went three times on foot to the chapel at the Notre-Dame de la Garde on September 28 December 8, 1720; and August 13, 1721, to bless the inhabitants of the city.

== Revolutionary period ==

=== Closing of the chapel ===
On April 30, 1790, the fort was invaded by anti-clerical revolutionaries who crossed the drawbridge on the pretext of attending mass in the chapel, a ruse previously adopted by the &quot;ligueurs&quot; in 1594. On June 7, 1792, Trinity Sunday, the day&#x27;s traditionally large procession was disturbed by demonstrations. During the statue&#x27;s return to the sanctuary, the Virgin was wrapped in a scarf in the revolutionary tricolour and a Phrygian cap, icon of the French Revolution, was placed on the head of the baby Jesus.

On November 23, 1793, the church buildings were closed down and worship ceased. On March 13, 1794, the statue of the Virgin, made in 1661 from silver, was melted down at the mint of Marseille, located at 22 Rue du Tapis-Vert at the former convent of Order of the Blessed Virgin Mary of Mercy.

=== A prison for princes ===
In April 1793, the King&#x27;s cousin Louis Phillipe, Duke of Orléans was imprisoned in Notre-Dame de la Garde for several weeks, along with two of his sons, the Duke of Montpensier and the Count of Beaujolais, his sister Louise, Duchess of Bourbon, and the Prince of Conti. Despite the lack of amenities in the old apartments of the governor, the prisoners enjoyed the panorama. Each day the Duchess of Bourbon attended mass then went to the fort&#x27;s terrace and often remained as much as two hours in contemplation. The princess Louise, who painted well, left behind a pencil drawing of Marseille as seen from the Virgin of Notre-Dame de la Garde. The prisoners were then transferred to Fort Saint-Jean.

=== A providential man: Escaramagne ===

The last of the objects from the sanctuary were auctioned off on April 10, 1795. The chapel was nationalized and rented to Joseph Escaramagne. A former ship&#x27;s captain who lived in what is now the current place du Colonel-Edon, Escaramagne had a deep devotion to the Virgin. After worship resumed in some parishes, he wrote in September 1800 to the Minister of War, Lazare Carnot, asking to reopen the sanctuary. But prefect Charles-François Delacroix voiced opposition when the minister consulted him. The chapel finally re-opened for worship on April 4, 1807.

Escaramagne bought at auction an 18th-century statue of the Virgin and child from a monastery of the Picpus Fathers that had been demolished during the Revolution. He offered the statue to the La Garde church. The scepter that the virgin had held was replaced by a bouquet of flowers, hence the statue became known as the &quot;Virgin of the bouquet&quot;. To make way for a new silver statue created in 1837, this statue was given to the , then returned in 1979 to the sanctuary. The statue of the Virgin of the bouquet is currently displayed on the altar in the crypt.

== Renaissance of the sanctuary ==
On the day the chapel of Notre-Dame de la Garde was reopened for worship, a procession started from Marseille Cathedral, bringing to the sanctuary the statue that Escaramagne had bought. The traditional procession of the Fête-Dieu (Corpus Christi Day) resumed in 1814. Julie Pellizzone mentions this event in her diary: &quot;On Sunday June 12, 1814, Fête-Dieu, the gunners of the city guard went in the morning with barefoot penitents to get Our Lady of the Guard and to bring her into town, according to the ancient custom. She was greeted by several cannon blasts. Mass was said, then she was brought here, carried by penitents with their hoods covering their faces, a procession such as had not taken place since the Revolution.

=== Chapel expansions ===
During this period the fort itself went almost unused while the number of people visiting the chapel increased significantly. This increase was so great that the 150 square meter chapel was extended in 1833 with the addition of a second nave, which increased its area to approximately 250 square meters. The bishop of Marseilles, , consecrated this chapel in 1834.

=== Distinguished visitors ===
After escaping a shipwreck while returning from Naples, the Duchess of Berry climbed to the chapel on June 14, 1816, and left a silver statuette as an ex voto – although the statue was melted down a few years later.

Marie Therese of France, daughter of Louis XVI and Duchess of d&#x27;Angoulême, climbed to Notre-Dame de la Garde on May 15, 1823, which was a day of strong mistral winds. Despite the wind, the duchess remained on the terrace, struck by the beauty of the view.

In 1838 the Virgin of the Guard had another distinguished visitor: François-René de Chateaubriand.

In 1947, Pope John Paul II, then still Father Karol Wojtyla, visited the basilica.
Pope Francis visited the Notre-Dame de la Garde basilica on September 22, 2023.

=== Black Madonna and Child ===

Thanks to various offerings, notably a gift of 3000 francs that the Duchess of Orleans made while travelling through Marseille in May 1823, a new statue of the Virgin was commissioned to replace the one melted down during the French Revolution. In 1829, Marseilles goldsmith Jean-Baptiste Chanuel, an artisan with a workshop in the , began work on this statue based on a model by the sculptor Jean-Pierre Cortot. This very delicate work of hammered gold was finished five years later, in 1834. On July 2, 1837, blessed the statue on the , which was then brought to the top of the hill. It replaced the Virgin of the Bouquet, which was given to the . The Virgin of the Bouquet was later returned to the crypt in 1979. The two statues, the Virgin of the Bouquet and the silver Virgin, thus pre-date the basilica where they are displayed.

=== New church bell ===
The rebuilding of the bell tower in 1843 was accompanied by the purchase of not just a new bell but a bourdon commissioned from the Lyons foundery of Gédéon Morel thanks to a special collection among the faithful. It was cast on February 11, 1845 and arrived in Marseille on September 19, 1845. It was placed in Jean-Jaurès square and blessed on Sunday October 5, 1845, by Eugène de Mazenod and baptized &quot;Marie Joséphine&quot;. The bell&#x27;s godfather was , then mayor of Marseille, and the godmother of the wife of shipping magnate (born Canaple). Their names are engraved on the bell. On October 7, the bell which weighed , was placed on a harnessed carriage of sixteen horses. It descended by Thiers Street, Leon Gambetta Alley, the Rue du Tapis-Vert, the , Canebière, the , and the . Ten horses were added there to the convoy, bringing their number to twenty-six. On October 8, 1845, the ascent of the bell up the hill began with the help of capstans and continued until Friday October 10, when the bell arrived at the summit. The bell was set up on Wednesday October 15. It rang out its first notes on December 8, the day of Immaculate Conception.

On this occasion the poet Joseph Autran composed a poem:

:::&quot;Sing, vast bell! sing, blessed bell
:::Spread, spread afloat your powerful harmony;
:::Pour over the sea, the fields, the mounts;
:::And especially from this hour when your hymn begins
:::Ring out into the skies a song of immense joy
:::For the city that we love!&quot;

Like the statues of the Virgin displayed in the interior of the basilica, the bell came before the construction of the current building.

== Construction of the current basilica ==

=== Negotiations with the army ===
On June 22, 1850, Father Jean-Antoine Bernard, who took responsibility for the chapel, asked the Ministry of War to authorise an expansion of the existing building. This request was denied on October 22, 1850, the day he resigned, by Minister of War Alphonse Henri d&#x27;Hautpoul, for being too vague. He agreed to the expansion in theory but invited a more precise proposal. On April 8, 1851, a more precise request was submitted, calling for the construction of a new and larger church, essentially doubling the area of the existing building. This design would mean that there would no longer be room for military buildings inside the fort. Thanks to the support of General Adolphe Niel, the fortifications committee advocated the proposal on January 7, 1852. Authorization to build a new chapel was given by the Minister of War on February 5, 1852.

=== Project set-up ===
On November 1, 1852, Monseigneur Eugene de Mazenod requested offerings from the members of the parish. Studies were requested from various architects. The administration council of the chapel met with Mazenod almost two months later, on December 30. The proposal presented by Leon Vaudoyer, who worked at the Marseille Cathedral, was the only one of Romano-Byzantine style; the others were Neo-Gothic. Each project received five votes, but the vicar&#x27;s tie-breaking vote went to Vaudoyer, whose project was commissioned. The plans were in fact drawn up by Henri-Jacques Espérandieu, his former pupil who was only twenty-three years old.

On June 23, 1853, Espérandieu was named as architect and developed the project. While he was Protestant, it does not seem that his religion was a major cause of the difficulties he encountered with the committee in charge of the work. The committee decided, without consulting him, not to open up labour for competitive bidding, but to award it directly to Pierre Bérenger (on August 9, 1853), contractor and architect of the Saint-Michel church. He himself had proposed one of the Neo-Gothic plans and was a close relative of Monseigneur Mazenod. The commission also imposed their choice of artists, such as sculptor Joseph-Marius Ramus and the painter Karl Müller of Düsseldorf, without concern for whether their works would fit within the structure. Karl Müller&#x27;s commission was later rejected, which allowed the architect to direct mosaics as the decor.

=== Construction ===
The first stone was laid by the bishop of Marseille, Monseigneur de Mazenod, on September 11, 1853. Work began but financial problems quickly developed because the foundations had to be laid in very hard rock. In 1855, the government authorized a lottery, but this produced less revenue than anticipated. The financial shortfall grew larger when the sanctuary commission decided to enlarge the crypt to run not only under the choir, but to extend under the entire higher vault. In spite of a loan secured by the personal assets of the bishop, building stopped from 1859 to 1861, the year of Mazenod&#x27;s death. The new bishop, , arrived at the end of August in 1861, and resumed work. The generosity of citizens of all religions and all social positions allowed completion of the work, from the Emperor Napoleon III and the Empress Eugénie, who visited Notre Dame de la Garde on September 9, 1860, to the poorest of Marseillais. The sanctuary was dedicated on Saturday June 4, 1864, by the Cardinal of Villecourt, a member of the Roman curia, in the presence of forty-three other bishops. In 1866, mosaic flooring was laid in the upper church and the square bell tower was finished; the bell was installed in October of the same year.
In 1867, a cylindrical pedestal or belfry was built on the square bell tower to receive the monumental statue of the virgin. The statue was financed by the town of Marseille. Sketches for the statue made by three Parisian artists, Eugène-Louis Lequesne, Aimé Millet and Charles Gumery were examined by a jury of Espérandieu the architect, , mayor of Marseilles, and Philippe-Auguste Jeanron, director of the School of Fine Arts, , sculptor and professor of sculpture and Luce, president of the Civil Court and administrator of the sanctuary. The committee selected the proposal of Lequesne.

For reasons of cost and weight, copper was chosen as the medium for the statue. A very new method for the time was adopted to realize of the statue: galvanoplasty, a type of electroplating, or &quot;the art of moulding without the help of fire&quot; was chosen over hammered copper. A scientific report of November 19, 1866, said that electrotype copper allowed an &quot;irreproachable reproduction&quot; and a solidity that left nothing to be desired. Only Eugène Viollet-le-Duc thought that the galvanoplasty technique would not long resist the atmospheric pollution in Marseilles.

Espérandieu had the statue made in four sections because of the difficulty of getting it up the hill and to the top of the bell tower. He inserted into the center of the sculpture an iron arrow, the core of a spiral staircase to the Virgin&#x27;s head, to be used for maintenance and sight-seeing. This metal structure, used to support the statue, made it possible to assemble the whole by connecting it to the body of the tower. The execution of the statue, entrusted to the workshops of , was finished in August 1869.

The first elements were assembled on May 17, 1870, and the statue was dedicated on September 24, 1870, but without fanfare, since defeat by the Prussian army dampened all spirits. The statue was gilded, which required gold, and regilding in 1897, 1936, 1963 and 1989.

In March 1871 Gaston Crémieux formed the revolutionary Commune of Marseille. Helped by followers of Giuseppe Garibaldi, the rebels seized the Prefecture of the Rhone delta and took the prefect captive. On March 26, 1871, General retreated to Aubagne, but undertook to retake the city beginning on April 3. The rebels who took refuge in the prefecture took fire from the batteries installed in and in Notre-Dame de la Garde. They capitulated on April 4 and said that the Virgin had changed her name and should from then on be called &quot;Notre-Dame of bombardment&quot;

Following the death of Espérandieu on September 11, 1874, Henri Révoil was charged with finishing the interior of the basilica, in particular the mosaics. The construction of the major crypt and installation of the mosaics in the choir was carried out in 1882. Unfortunately a fire on June 5, 1884, destroyed the altar and the mosaic in the choir; moreover the statue of the Virgin was damaged. The statue and the mosaics were restored and the altar was rebuilt according to the drawings of Révoil. On April 26, 1886, cardinal Charles Lavigerie consecrated the new crypt. In 1886, walnut stalls were built in the choir; the last mosaics in the side vaults were finished between 1887 and 1892. In 1897, the two bronze doors of the upper church and the mosaic above them were installed and the statue of the Virgin was regilded for the first time. Final completion of the basilica thus took place more than forty years after the first stone was laid.

== Funicular ==
In 1892, the was built to reduce the effort of scaling the hill; this funicular became known as the &quot;ascenseur&quot; or elevator. The base was at the lower end of . The upper station led directly onto a footpath to the terrace beneath the basilica, leaving only a short climb to the level of the crypt at . Construction took two years.

The funicular consisted of two cabins each weighing 13 tons when empty, circulating on parallel cogged tracks. The movement was powered by a &quot;hydraulic balance&quot; system: each cabin, in addition to its two floors capable of holding fifty passengers total, was equipped with a 12 cubic meter tank of water. The cabins were linked by a cable; the tank of the descending cabin was filled with water and that of the ascending cabin emptied. This ballasting started the system moving. The vertical distance between the two stations was .

The water collected at the foot of the apparatus at the end of each trip was brought back to the top with a 25-horsepower pump—true horsepower, because the pump was powered by steam. Travel time was two minutes, but filling the upper tank took more than ten minutes, forcing waits between departures, in spite of often considerable crowds. The last adventure after the ascent was crossing the 100-meter footbridge up the steep slope. Built by Gustave Eiffel, the footbridge was only wide and very exposed to the mistral winds.

On August 15, 1892, the number of visitors exceeded , but the advent of the automobile killed the funicular. On September 11, 1967, at 18:30, the funicular was shut down as unprofitable. It was demolished after having transported 20 million passengers over 75 years.

== Liberation of France ==
On August 24, 1944, General Joseph de Monsabert ordered General Aimé Sudre to take Notre-Dame de la Garde, which was covered in German Army blockhouses. But his orders stipulated &quot;no air raid, no large-scale use of artillery. This legendary rock will have to be attacked by infantrymen supported by armoured tanks&quot;. The primary attack was entrusted to Lieutenant Pichavant, who commanded the 1st company of the On August 25, 1944, at 6 am, troops began moving towards the hill, very slowly, because sniping from German riflemen impeded their advance.
One French soldier, Pierre Chaix-Bryan, was familiar with the neighborhood, and knew that at No. 26 Cherchel street, (now ) a hallway ran through the building to a staircase unknown to the Germans. A commemorative plaque marks this spot today. The Algerian riflemen used this staircase and arrived under the command of Roger Audibert at the Cherchel plateau. Other soldiers took the staircases up the Notre-Dame slope from the boulevard of the same name. The attackers on the northern face came under fire from the blockhouses then were also attacked from the rear by the guns of . The support of the tanks was essential.

In the early afternoon the tanks of the 2nd regiment of cuirassiers of the 1 D.B also attacked from Boulevard Gazzino, now , and from the church slope. The tank &quot;Jeanne d&#x27; Arc&quot; was hit full force and stopped at the place du Colonel Edon, its three occupants killed. The tank can still be seen today. A second tank, the &quot;Jourdan&quot;, hit a mine but was protected by a rocky overhang, and so could continue shooting. This had a decisive effect not known until later: the German non-commissioned specialist in charge of the flame throwers was killed by the &quot;Jourdan&quot;&#x27;s fire. Because of this a young, inexperienced German soldier prematurely ignited the flame throwers, which allowed the French to spot the site of the guns.

Around 3:30pm a section of the 1st company of the 7th Algerian riflemen under Roger Audibert, joined by Ripoll, took the hill by storm. They were greeted by Monseigneur Borel, who had taken refuge in the crypt. The French flag was hoisted atop the bell tower, although the position was still shelled from the Angelus and from Fort Saint Nicolas, until they too were retaken. In the evening the German officer who had commanded the German troops at Notre-Dame de la Garde returned. He was wounded and died two days later. The liberation of Marseille took place on the morning of August 28, 1944.

== Architecture ==

The exterior of the building features layered stonework in contrasting colours: white Calissane limestone alternates with green sandstone from Golfolina near Florence. Marble and pictorial mosaics in various colours decorate the upper church. A double staircase leads to a drawbridge, granting access to the crypt and, via another set of stairs, to the church&#x27;s main entrance.

=== Crypt ===

The entrance hall under the bell tower features marble statues of Bishop Eugène de Mazenod and Pope Pius IX, both carved by Joseph-Marius Ramus. Staircases on both sides of the entrance lead to the church above.

The Romanesque crypt is composed of a nave with low barrel vaults, bordered by six side chapels corresponding exactly to those of the upper church. Unlike the upper church, the crypt is dim and somber. The side chapels contain plaques with the names of various donors. The side altars are devoted to saints Philomena, Andrew, Rose, Henry, Louis and Benedict Labre.

The main altar was built of Golfolina stone with columns of Spanish marble. Behind the altar is a statue of the Madonna holding a bouquet, the Vierge au Bouquet. Joseph-Elie Escaramagne obtained this statue for the original chapel in 1804. At first the Madonna held a sceptre, but due to the sceptre&#x27;s poor condition, it was replaced by flowers. Two staircases flanking the main altar lead to the sacristy buildings and the choir above, but they are off-limits to the public.

=== Bell tower ===

At a height of , the square bell tower above the entrance porch has two identical storeys of five blind arches, of which the central arch has a window and a small balcony. This is surmounted by a belfry, with each face composed of a three-light window divided by red granite mullions, behind which are abat-sons. The belfry is covered by a square terrace, which is enclosed by a stone balustrade bearing the arms of the city on each side and an angel with a trumpet at each corner. These four statues were carved by Eugène-Louis Lequesne.

From the square terrace a cylindrical bell tower rises to a height of . It is made of sixteen red granite columns, supporting a tall statue of the Virgin Mary. A staircase within the bell tower leads to the terrace and to the statue, but is off-limits to the general public.

At the base of the tower, bronze doors by Henri Révoil grant access to the church. The central door panels bear the monogram of the Virgin placed within a circle of pearls resembling the rosary. The tympanum above the main entrance is decorated with a mosaic of the Assumption of the Virgin, patterned after a painting by .

=== Upper church ===

The nave&#x27;s interior is 32.7 m long and 14 m wide. Each side chapel measures 3.8 m by 5.4 m. The interior is decorated with of mosaics as well as alternating red and white marble columns and pilasters. Espérandieu wanted a subtle red that would harmonise with the mosaics and not clash too much with the whiteness of the Carrara marble. Jules Cantini, the marble worker, discovered such a red marble with yellow and white veins in the commune of La Celle near Brignoles, Var. For parts higher up, plaster—i.e. reconstituted marble—was used.

The mosaics were created between 1886 and 1892 by the Mora company from Nimes. The tesserae came from Venice and were manufactured by craftsmen at the height of their art. Each panel comprises nearly ten thousand tesserae per square metre, which means that the basilica contains approximately 12 million small squares of 1 to . The floors are covered with approximately of Roman mosaics with geometric patterns.

==== Nave ====
The aisles of the nave are divided into three equal parts, each with a central window that illuminates a side chapel. The external pilasters and arches are composed of alternating green and white stones and voussoirs. Basement windows at ground level allow some daylight into the crypt&#x27;s underground chapels. Since the nave is higher than the side chapels, a clerestory with two-light windows illuminates the domes of the nave, although these windows are not visible form the terrace.

The nave is topped by three cupolas decorated on the inside with similar mosaics: on a field of flowers, doves form a circle around a central floret. The colours of the flowers differ for each cupola: white for the southeastern one, blue for the middle and red for the northwestern cupola. Medallions on the pendentives depict scenes from the Old Testament as prefigurations of the Virgin Mary. :

The mosaics of the northwestern cupola depict a grapevine, a lily among thorns, an olive branch with silver leaves and a date palm.

==== Transept ====
The transept is oriented east to west and lit by two paired windows, each with a rose window above. Above the crossing of the transept is an octagonal tholobate supporting a dome of nine meters in diameter, composed of thirty-two ribs and crowned by a cross. Each outward face of the octagon contains a window flanked by two red granite columns and topped by a triangular pediment. The semicircular apse is adorned with five blind arches on the outside, each flanked by two red granite columns. The sacristy buildings that were added later hide part of the apse.

The inside of the dome is decorated with a mosaic of four angels on a field of gold. The angels hold up a wreath of roses which they offer to the Virgin Mary, represented by her monogram in the middle of the composition. The pendentives at the base of the dome contain representations of the Four Evangelists: Mark symbolized by a lion, Luke by a bull, John by an eagle and Matthew by a man.

The tympanum above the apse depicts the Annunciation of Mary: the archangel Gabriel on the right announces the birth of Jesus to Mary on the left.

====Choir====

The white marble altar was designed by Henri Révoil and constructed by Jules Cantini between 1882 and 1886. The base of the altar is formed by five gilded bronze arches resting on colonettes of lapis lazuli. The silver-gilt tabernacle is framed by two columns and two mosaics of doves drinking from a chalice.

Behind the altar, a red marble column topped by a gilded capital supports a statue of Mary, made of hammered silver by the goldsmith Chanuel of Marseille.

The mosaic of the apse&#x27;s semi-dome depicts a ship in its central medallion. The ship&#x27;s sail features the monogram of Mary, while a star in the sky shows an intertwined A and M, which stands for &quot;Ave Maria&quot;. This medallion is surrounded by rinceaux and thirty two birds, including peacocks, parrots, hoopoes, bluethroats, herons, and goldfinches.

The band beneath the semi-dome is decorated with nine medallions, which represent several titles of Mary from the Litany of Loreto: &quot;Foederis Arca, Speculum Iustitiae, Sedes Sapientiae, Turris Davidica, Rosa Mystica, Turris Eburnea, Domus Aurea, Vas Spirituale, Ianua Coeli&quot;.

==== Side chapels ====
The aisles on either side of the nave house a total of six side chapels. Henri Révoil designed and Jules Cantini constructed the altars; Cantini also created the statue of Peter and made it a gift to the sanctuary. Each altar tomb features the coat of arms of its respective saint. The ceiling of each chapel is decorated with a mosaic, depicting the name and arms of the financer on one side and a symbol of the saint on the other.

== Long and meticulous restoration: 2001–2008 ==
By 2001 the interior facades had severely aged. Also, the cathedral&#x27;s mosaics had been badly restored after the war. After four years of preparatory studies, a major restoration project was launched in 2001 under the direction of the architect Xavier David. The work lasted until 2008, financed by local government agencies and by donations from private individuals and businesses.

=== External restoration ===
Although the majority of the stones used proved very resistant over time, this did not hold true for the green stone, a beautiful hard stone which degrades very quickly when exposed to industrial and domestic pollution, especially coal smoke, and was found to be corroded to a depth of 3 to 5 cm. As the original quarry near Florence had been closed for a long time, a new source was sought. A quarry in a vineyard close to Chianti supplied 150 cubic metres of Golfolina. The defective stone was replaced by stone treated to resist pollution. Moreover, rusting metal reinforcements had split some of the stone. Two sets of reinforcements posed a serious problem: those that girdle the top of the bell tower to reinforce against the swinging of the bell, and those around the upper part of the bell tower that supports the monumental statue. Some of the reinforcements were treated with cathodic protection, and others replaced with stainless steel.

=== Interior restoration ===
Interior work was even more important. Some water-damaged stuccos in higher areas had to be redone. Mosaic panels damaged by bullets or shells had earlier been repaired with a poor and rushed technique: missing tiles had been replaced by plaster covered with paint. Moreover, all the mosaics were blackened by candle smoke. Mosaics which threatened to fall apart needed to be consolidated with resin injections. The most damaged part was in the central cupola of the nave, where all the gold mosaics needed to be replaced.

The restoration of the mosaics was entrusted to Marseille artist Michel Patrizio, whose workmen were trained in traditional mosaic skills at the school of Spilimbergo in Friuli, north of Venice. The mosaic tiles were supplied by the Orsoni Venezia 1888 workshop in Venice which had made the originals.

== In the arts ==

=== Writers ===
Many writers have described the famous basilica, for example:

* Valery Larbaud: &quot;She who governs the roads of the sea, Who shines above the waves and the sun, The giantess standing behind the blue hours, high gold inhabitant of a long white country, Christian Pallas of the Gauls.
* Paul Arene: &quot;Here the true good mother, the only one, who rules in a gold coat stiff with pearls and rubies, under the dome of Notre-Dame de la Garde, a cupola of hard lapis lazuli encrusted with diamonds for stars, condescended to be angry with me.
* Chateaubriand: &quot;I hastened to go up to Notre-Dame de la Garde, to admire the sea bordered with the ruins the laughing coasts of all the famous countries of Antiquity.
* Marie Mauron: &quot;It is she whom one sees from the sea, first and last on her summit of light hemmed of blue, dominating its Greek Provence which knows or does not know any more that it is it, but the remainder. Who would miss, believer or not, climbing up to the Good mother?
* Michel Mohrt: &quot;And there high on the mountain, the good Virgin, the good mother, looked out this crowd, presided over the traffic in the false identity cards, at the open-air black market behind the Stock Exchange, with all the attacks, all the denunciations, all the rapes, the Good mother of the Garde who takes care on the sailors who are ashore, – as for those who are at sea, let them sort themselves out! &quot;
* André Suarès: &quot;Notre Dame of the Guard is a mast: it oscillates on its skittle. It will take its flight, the basilica, with the virgin who serves as its crest. Thus the basilica perched on the hill of the guard, and the gilded copper statue which they hoisted on the basilica. There, once more, this style which wants to be Roman and Byzantine, without ever succeeding in being a style: neither the force of the Roman, nor the science of the Byzantine.&quot;

=== Painters of the Basilica ===

Many painters have depicted Marseille&#x27;s port with Notre-Dame&#x27;s basilica in the background. Paul Signac, who helped to develop pointillism, produced a painting in 1905 that is now shown in the Metropolitan Museum of Art, New York. Albert Marquet produced three works. The first was a drawing executed in ink in 1916, shown at Musee National d&#x27;Art Moderne in Paris. The second is an oil on canvas painted in 1916 entitled &quot;The horse at Marseille&quot;. This painting, now at the Museum of Fine Arts in Bordeaux, shows a horse on the port quay with the hill of Notre-Dame de la Garde in the background. The third, shown at the Annonciade museum at Saint-Tropez, is called &quot;The Port of Marseille in fog&quot;; the basilica emerges from a misty landscape where the purification of form indicates distance.This painting shows this painter did not always represent the port of Marseilles from the front, moving his easel to the riverbank side, sometimes close to the town hall, to represent the hill of Notre-Dame de la Garde.

Charles Camoin painted two canvases in 1904 featuring Notre-Dame de la Garde: &quot;The Old Port with Barrels&quot;, at the Gelsenkirchen museum, and &quot;The Old Port and Notre-Dame de la Garde&quot; shown at the Fine Art museum of Le Havre. This museum also possesses a painting by Raoul Dufy done in 1908, entitled &quot;The Port of Marseille&quot;. In 1920, made a pastel drawing &quot;Notre-Dame de la Garde Seen from the Town Hall&quot;; this work is in the Petit Palais museum in Geneva. Louis-Mathieu Verdilhan, about 1920 &quot;The Canal from Fort St. John&quot;; the silhouette of Notre-Dame de la Garde is at the rear of the painting with a boat in the foreground. This painting is at the Musée National d&#x27;Art Moderne in Paris.

M.C. Escher produced a wood engraving of the city, entitled Marseille, in 1936.

== &quot;Bonne Mère&quot; ==
The people of Marseille regard the Notre-Dame basilica as the guardian and protectoress of the city, hence its nickname &quot;Bonne Mère&quot; (&quot;Good Mother&quot;), which is also a nickname of Mary, mother of Jesus.

=== Ex-votos ===

A Mediterranean-style religiosity is expressed here with numerous votive candles and ex-votos offered to the Virgin to thank her for spiritual or temporal favours and to proclaim and recall the grace received.

One of the oldest documents about this practice is a deed of August 11, 1425, in which a certain Jean Aymar paid five guilders for wax images offered in gratitude to the Virgin. During his travels in the south of France at the beginning of the 19th century, Aubin-Louis Millin de Grandmaison was struck by the number of ex-voto at Notre-Dame de la Garde: &quot;The path that leads to the oratory is stiff and difficult. The chapel is small and narrow, but decorated everywhere with tributes from pious mariners: on the ceiling small vessels are suspended with their rigs and have their name registered on the stern; they represent those that the mother of Christ has saved from cruel shipwreck or from the fury of pirates and corsairs&quot;. The ceiling of the upper church still features many scale models of recently restored boats and planes.

The walls of the side vaults of the two sanctuaries, the crypt and upper church, are covered with a first level of marble slabs. The upper walls of these side vaults are occupied by painted ex-votos hung in several rows above; the most recent are on the walls of the terraces of the basilica. Most of these ex-votos date only from the second half of the 19th century; earlier ones disappeared during the Revolution. Most depict shipwrecks and storms, but there are also very different scenes: fire, car and railway accidents, bedridden patients, and political and social events. The events of May 68 were the inspiration for one drawing; an Olympique de Marseille flag recalls that the players of the club mounted a pilgrimage to the basilica after a victory.

=== Symbol of Marseille ===
Visible from the motorways of Marseille and from the train station, the gare Saint-Charles, Notre Dame de la Garde is the city&#x27;s most well-known symbol. It is the most-visited site in Marseille, and receives hundreds of visitors every day, a number of pilgrims remarkable for a site that with no association with a saint, vision or miracle, nor for that matter with a famous person. For Cardinal Etchegaray, former bishop of Marseille, the Virgin of the Garde &quot;does not merely form part of the landscape like the Chateau d&#x27;If or the Old Port, it is the living heart of Marseille, its central artery more than the Canebière. It is not the exclusive property of Catholics; it belongs to the human family that teems in Marseille.&quot; Notre-Dame de la Garde remains the heart of the diocese of Marseille, even more so than the cathedral. It was here that Bishop Jean Delay on August 30, 1944, hoped that deep reforms would bring to the poorest more humane and more just living and working conditions. It was also here that Etchegaray compared, in May 1978, the ravages of unemployment to those of the plague of Marseille of 1720.

A museum opened on the site on June 18, 2013, retracing the building&#x27;s eight-century history. It was officially inaugurated July 11, 2013, with civil and military authorities participating. As with prior renovations, a fundraising appeal received generous support from the public, in addition to gifts from public agencies.

The logo of the popular French soap opera &quot;Plus belle la vie&quot;, set in Marseille, depicts Notre-Dame de la Garde.
The Marseille-based company Compagnie Maritime d&#x27;Expertises used a model of the church for a maritime test launch in 2017 where the symbol was sent to near-space in 20 km altitude.

=== Tourism ===
Notre-Dame de la Garde receives around a million and half visitors each year, many just for the view. Pilgrims come for various reasons, some writing them down in a guestbook. One in particular sums up these reasons: &quot;I came here first for the peace and comfort one finds at the feet of the Blessed Virgin, then for the feast for the eyes that the basilica offers, for the panorama, the pure air and the space, for the feeling of freedom.&quot;

<text>The Waterford Institute of Technology (WIT; ) was an institute of technology, located in Waterford, Ireland. The institute had six constituent schools and offered programmes in business, engineering, science, health sciences, as well as education &amp; humanities.

The institute opened in 1970 as a Regional Technical College and adopted its name on 7 May 1997. Along with the Institute of Technology, Carlow, the institute was dissolved on 1 May 2022 and was succeeded by the South East Technological University.

==History==
At the time of the founding of the RTC, there were two other third-level institutions in the city, St John&#x27;s Seminary Waterford News and Star which notes the closing of the St John&#x27;s Seminary in 1999 and De La Salle Brothers teacher training college, but both had been closed.

Waterford politicians made strenuous but unsuccessful efforts to locate a university in Waterford at the time of the formation of the Queen&#x27;s University of Ireland in the 1840s. The cause was led by Thomas Wyse, Member of Parliament for Waterford City, who was not influential in the House of Commons, having strong Napoleonic links (he married a niece of Napoleon I of France), being a Catholic and leaning towards an independent Ireland. Galway, a much smaller city at the time, won out over Waterford, perhaps because of the necessity for geographical dispersion or to bolster the Irish language. Wyse wrote in the round on the matter in his text &quot;Education reform or the necessity of a national system of education&quot; (London, 1836).

The institute was founded in 1970 as the Regional Technical College, Waterford. Once founded, the regional technical college grew very quickly as a result of the obviously strong regional need for tertiary education. In 1997 the college adopted its present name by order of the Minister for Education Niamh Bhreathnach, with Dublin Institute of Technology being the only other institution with the &quot;institute of technology&quot; title at the time in Ireland. Following a change of government and enormous political pressure on behalf of other regional technical colleges, especially Cork Regional Technical College, all other regional technical colleges were renamed similarly by Minister for Education Micheál Martin.

Since 2001, the institute had conferred its own awards at all levels from Higher Certificate to PhD, subject to standards set and monitored by the Higher Education and Training Awards Council (HETAC) which was established by the Government in June 2001, under the Qualifications (Education and Training) Act, 1999.
In October 2005 the institute was selected by &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; newspaper as the &quot;Institute of Technology of the Year&quot; in Ireland.

The institute now has a student population of approximately 6,000 full-time students and 1,000 part-time students. The Staff currently consists of approximately 470 Full-time academic, 300 part-time and 300 support staff.

The institute formally applied in 2006 for university status in accordance with the Universities Act, 1997, and the process of examining the case for redesignation has commenced. In January 2007 Dr Jim Port was engaged by the government to carry out a &quot;preliminary assessment&quot; of the institute&#x27;s case.

WIT and Nemeton TV (which is based in the Waterford Gaeltacht) run a Higher Diploma in Arts in Television Production supported by Údarás na Gaeltachta.

==Ranking==
In 2018, Webometrics placed WIT as the 7th best higher education body in Ireland (out of 32). The institute is also ranked at 10th place by Unirank, and the leading Irish institute of technology (with the exception of DIT, which is now classified as a Technology University).

==Campuses==

The institute has 5 campuses: Cork Road, College Street, Carriganore, the Applied Technology Building and the Granary.

==Organisation==
The institute is divided into 6 schools and their various departments.

==Research at WIT==
===Research Centres===
* Walton Institute for Information and Communications Systems Science
* Pharmaceutical and Molecular Biotechnology Research Centre (PMBRC)
* Eco-Innovation Research Centre
* Nutrition Research Centre Ireland (formerly MPRG)
* South Eastern Applied Material Research (SEAM)

===Research Groups===
==Technological University for the South East==

The institute has been planning a joint application with IT Carlow for the formation of a technological university for the south east region since the mid-2010&#x27;s. A vision document, &quot;Technological University for the South East&quot; (TUSE) was published in 2015, and a memorandum of understanding was signed in 2017. At the launch of TU Dublin in July 2018, the Taoiseach expressed regret that this TUSE bid had not progressed sufficiently following the Technological Universities Act 2018.

Approval was announced in November 2021, and the TU will be formally established in .

<doc id="363540" wikidata="Q7455422" url="?curid=363540" title="Serre–Swan theorem">
<text>In the mathematical fields of topology and K-theory, the Serre–Swan theorem, also called Swan&#x27;s theorem, relates the geometric notion of vector bundles to the algebraic concept of projective modules and gives rise to a common intuition throughout mathematics: &quot;projective modules over commutative rings are like vector bundles on compact spaces&quot;.

The two precise formulations of the theorems differ somewhat. The original theorem, as stated by Jean-Pierre Serre in 1955, is more algebraic in nature, and concerns vector bundles on an algebraic variety over an algebraically closed field (of any characteristic). The complementary variant stated by Richard Swan in 1962 is more analytic, and concerns (real, complex, or quaternionic) vector bundles on a smooth manifold or Hausdorff space.

== Differential geometry ==
Suppose &quot;M&quot; is a smooth manifold (not necessarily compact), and &quot;E&quot; is a smooth vector bundle over &quot;M&quot;. Then &quot;Γ(E)&quot;, the space of smooth sections of &quot;E&quot;, is a module over C∞(&quot;M&quot;) (the commutative algebra of smooth real-valued functions on &quot;M&quot;). Swan&#x27;s theorem states that this module is finitely generated and projective over C∞(&quot;M&quot;). In other words, every vector bundle is a direct summand of some trivial bundle: formula_1 for some &quot;k&quot;. The theorem can be proved by constructing a bundle epimorphism from a trivial bundle formula_2 This can be done by, for instance, exhibiting sections &quot;s&quot;1...&quot;s&quot;&quot;k&quot; with the property that for each point &quot;p&quot;, {&quot;s&quot;&quot;i&quot;(&quot;p&quot;)} span the fiber over &quot;p&quot;. 

When &quot;M&quot; is connected, the converse is also true: every finitely generated projective module over C∞(&quot;M&quot;) arises in this way from some smooth vector bundle on &quot;M&quot;. Such a module can be viewed as a smooth function &quot;f&quot; on &quot;M&quot; with values in the &quot;n&quot; × &quot;n&quot; idempotent matrices for some &quot;n&quot;. The fiber of the corresponding vector bundle over &quot;x&quot; is then the range of &quot;f&quot;(&quot;x&quot;). If &quot;M&quot; is not connected, the converse does not hold unless one allows for vector bundles of non-constant rank (which means admitting manifolds of non-constant dimension). For example, if &quot;M&quot; is a zero-dimensional 2-point manifold, the module formula_3 is finitely-generated and projective over formula_4 but is not free, and so cannot correspond to the sections of any (constant-rank) vector bundle over &quot;M&quot; (all of which are trivial).

Another way of stating the above is that for any connected smooth manifold &quot;M&quot;, the section functor &quot;Γ&quot; from the category of smooth vector bundles over &quot;M&quot; to the category of finitely generated, projective C∞(&quot;M&quot;)-modules is full, faithful, and essentially surjective. Therefore the category of smooth vector bundles on &quot;M&quot; is equivalent to the category of finitely generated, projective C∞(&quot;M&quot;)-modules. Details may be found in .

== Topology ==
Suppose &quot;X&quot; is a compact Hausdorff space, and C(&quot;X&quot;) is the ring of continuous real-valued functions on &quot;X&quot;. Analogous to the result above, the category of real vector bundles on &quot;X&quot; is equivalent to the category of finitely generated projective modules over C(&quot;X&quot;). The same result holds if one replaces &quot;real-valued&quot; by &quot;complex-valued&quot; and &quot;real vector bundle&quot; by &quot;complex vector bundle&quot;, but it does not hold if one replace the field by a totally disconnected field like the rational numbers.

In detail, let Vec(&quot;X&quot;) be the category of complex vector bundles over &quot;X&quot;, and let ProjMod(C(&quot;X&quot;)) be the category of finitely generated projective modules over the C*-algebra C(&quot;X&quot;). There is a functor Γ : Vec(&quot;X&quot;) → ProjMod(C(&quot;X&quot;)) which sends each complex vector bundle &quot;E&quot; over &quot;X&quot; to the C(&quot;X&quot;)-module Γ(&quot;X&quot;, &quot;E&quot;) of sections. If formula_5 is a morphism of vector bundles over &quot;X&quot; then formula_6 and it follows that

:formula_7

giving the map 

:formula_8

which respects the module structure . Swan&#x27;s theorem asserts that the functor Γ is an equivalence of categories.

==Algebraic geometry==
The analogous result in algebraic geometry, due to applies to vector bundles in the category of affine varieties. Let &quot;X&quot; be an affine variety with structure sheaf formula_9 and formula_10 a coherent sheaf of formula_11 -modules on &quot;X&quot;. Then formula_10 is the sheaf of germs of a finite-dimensional vector bundle if and only if formula_13 the space of sections of formula_14 is a projective module over the commutative ring formula_15

<text>The Stockholm Metro () is a rapid transit system in Stockholm, the capital city of Sweden. Its first line opened in 1950 as the first metro line in the Nordic countries. Today, the system consists of three lines and 100 stations, of which 47 are underground and 53 above ground. The system is owned by Region Stockholm via SL, the public transport authority for Stockholm County. It is the only metro system in Sweden.

The metro&#x27;s three coloured lines, Green, Red, and Blue, together form seven routes with different termini. All of these routes pass through the city centre, creating a highly centralised network. The main interchange for all three lines is T-Centralen station, where they intersect. In addition to T-Centralen, the system has three other interchange stations: Fridhemsplan, Slussen, and Gamla stan. Various extensions to the system are currently under construction, An extension to the north-west of Blue Line is expected to open in 2027, while extensions to its south are expected to open in 2030. Construction of a new Yellow Line to the west of the city centre is scheduled to start in 2025.

In 2019, the Stockholm metro transported 462 million passengers, equivalent to approximately 1.27 million on a typical weekday. The metro system has been operated by MTR since 2 November 2009, whose contract expires at the end of 2024. The system is equipped with ticket barriers. SL operates the metro&#x27;s ticketing system, with ticketing available via the SL app and rechargeable travel cards. Contactless payment is also accepted at the gates. Ticketing can also be purchased at station booths and select local retailers. SL phased out ticket machines on its network in 2022.

The Stockholm metro has been referred to as &#x27;the world’s longest art gallery,&#x27; featuring decorations at more than 90 of its 100 stations, including sculptures, rock formations, mosaics, paintings, light installations, engravings, and reliefs created by over 150 artists.

==History==

===Before the Metro===
In the late 19th century, Stockholm’s suburbs expanded thanks to the development of local railways such as Djursholmsbanan and Saltsjöbanan. By 1900, electrified trams extended into the city centre, and by 1915 Stockholms Spårvägar (SS) was managing a growing tram network, including new suburban lines as the city incorporated areas such as Bromma and Brännkyrka. With further suburbs planned, it became evident that trams would not meet the city&#x27;s future transport needs, prompting underground railway proposals. Stockholm&#x27;s politicians were also inspired by large cities such as London, Paris and New York where metros had already been built. Through the 1920s, various investigations were carried out by the city. In 1930 a traffic committee was appointed by Stockholm&#x27;s city council at the initiative of city councilor Yngve Larsson with the task of solving the capital&#x27;s major traffic problems.

===The First Tunnel===

The first step towards an underground transit system was the construction of the Södertunneln tram tunnel under Södermalm. Approved by the city council on 30 March 1931, following recommendations from the 1930 Traffic Committee. Construction commenced in autumn 1931, and the project, costing 4.5 million kronor, was inaugurated on 30 September 1933. Södertunneln included three stations: Slussen, Södra Bantorget (now Medborgarplatsen), and Ringvägen (now Skanstull). The stations were designed by architect Holger Blom and inspired by Berlin’s U-Bahn. The tunnel operated as a premetro service with existing tramlines connecting to it. This project marked the first use of the term &quot;Tunnelbanan,&quot; and the first use of station entrances distinguished by a &quot;T&quot; in a circle.

===Plans for a Full-Scale Metro System===
The 1930s also brought significant changes to the political and economic landscape of housing construction in Stockholm, with a new municipal plan for multi-family dwellings in the suburbs. A considerable debate unfolded across political parties, but a metro system came to be viewed as the optimal solution to the city’s housing crisis and increasing congestion in the city centre. 

In 1941, Stockholm City Council voted to develop a large-scale metro system, based on plans from the 1930 Traffic Committee and a further 1940 report. This decision called for the Södertunneln and southern suburban tram lines to be extended to Norrmalm, connecting with the western suburban tram lines through a tunnel under Sveavägen. 

===Initial Construction===
The Stockholm Metro&#x27;s formal construction began in 1944, following the 1941 city council decision. The first focus was extending the Södertunneln southward, beyond Gullmarsplan. During this period, several other lines were built to premetro standards, including routes from Kristineberg to Islandstorget, using the new Tranebergsbron bridge; Skanstull to Blåsut, including construction of the Skanstullsbron bridge; and Telefonplan to Hägerstensåsen. 

In late 1944, a population study revealed that Stockholm’s rapid population growth would demand greater capacity for the planned metro. As a result, two significant decisions were made: the line between T-Centralen and Slussen would be constructed with four tracks instead of two, and platform lengths were increased from six-car (100 meters) to eight-car (145 meters) to accommodate more passengers.

===Full Metro===
The first part of the metro was opened on 1 October 1950, from Slussen to Hökarängen, having been converted from tram to metro operation. In 1951, a second branch from Slussen to Stureby was opened (which was also tram operated until then). In 1952, a second line, from Hötorget to the western suburbs was opened. In 1957, the two parts were connected with a line between Hötorget and Slussen, with two new intermediate stations: T-Centralen, adjacent to Stockholm Central station, Gamla stan in Stockholm&#x27;s old town, forming the Green Line. Through the 1950s, the Green Line was extended piece by piece.

The Red Line was opened in 1964, from T-Centralen over Liljeholmen ending in Fruängen and Örnsberg, both in the Southwest. It was extended piece by piece until 1978, when it reached Mörby centrum via a bridge over Stocksundet sea strait.

The third and final system, the Blue Line, was opened in 1975, with two lines running northwest from the city center. As the construction requirements have become more strict over the years, newer segments have more tunnels than older ones, and the Blue Line is almost entirely tunnelled. The latest addition to the whole network, Skarpnäck station, was opened in 1994.

==Network==

===Stations===
There are 100 stations in use in the Stockholm metro (of which 47 are underground). One station, Kymlinge, was built but never put into use. One station has been taken out of use and demolished. The old surface station at Bagarmossen was demolished and replaced with a new underground station, this being prior to the metro extension to the Skarpnäck metro station.

The Stockholm metro is well known for the decoration of its stations. Several of the stations (especially on the Blue Line) are left with the bedrock exposed, crude and unfinished, or as part of the decorations.. 

===Lines===
The following details relate to the present network. The designations &quot;Blue line&quot;, etc., have only been used since the late 1970s, and officially only since the 1990s. They originated from the fact that the &quot;blue line&quot; tended to operate newer train stock painted blue, while the &quot;Green line&quot; had older stock in the original green livery. There was never any red painted stock, though, but red (or originally orange) was chosen to differentiate this line from the other two networks on route maps.

====Green Line====
The Green line (officially Tunnelbana 1, or &quot;Metro 1&quot;) has three routes and 49 stations: 12 underground (nine concrete, three rock) and 37 above ground stations. It is long. It was opened on 1 October 1950 (between Slussen and Hökarängen stations) and is used by 451,000 passengers per workday or 146 million per year (2005)

====Red Line====
The Red line (Tunnelbana 2) has two routes and 36 stations: 20 underground (four concrete, 16 rock) and 15 above ground stations. It is long (only shorter than the Green line), and was opened on 5 April 1964. It is used by 394,000 passengers per workday or 128 million per year (2005).

====Blue Line====
Blue line (Tunnelbana 3) has two routes and 20 stations: 19 underground (all rock) and one elevated station. It is long. It was opened on 31 August 1975 and is used by 171,000 passengers per workday or 55 million per year (2005).Trains operate from 05:00 to 01:00, with extended all night service on Fridays and Saturdays. All lines have trains every 10 minutes during the day, reduced to every 15 minutes in early mornings and late evenings, and every 30 minutes at night. Additional trains during peak hours gives a train every 5–6 minutes on most stations, with 2–3 minutes between trains on the central parts of the network.

The metro contains four interchanges (&quot;T-Centralen&quot;, &quot;Slussen&quot;, &quot;Gamla Stan&quot; and &quot;Fridhemsplan&quot;) and lacks any kind of circular or partly circular line (although Stockholm has a semi-circular light rail line, Tvärbanan). A wide majority of the metro stations are located in suburbs, but the network is centred on T-Centralen where all trains in the entire network pass.

In the past, there have been additional route numbers in use for trains operated on part of a line, or during peak hours only. For example, route 23 was used for a peak relief train for route 13, which in the 1970s was operated between Sätra and Östermalmstorg and during the 1990s between Norsborg and Mörby Centrum.
There is a connection to the main rail network, which is used for deliveries of new trains and some other purposes. In this case trains are pulled by locomotives since the electrical and other standards are different. This connection consists of a track to Tvärbanan at the Globen station and a rail track from the Liljeholmen Tvärbanan station to the Älvsjö railway station.

===Network Map===
==Rolling stock==
The Stockholm metro operates two main types of rolling stock: the SL C20 and SL C30. Previously, the system used the older C1–C15 trains, collectively known as the Cx stock. These trains were gradually retired, and fully discontinued by 2024 after more than 40 years of service.

Currently, the Stockholm metro operates 271 trainsets of the C20 stock and 116 trainsets of the C30 stock. The Green Line exclusively uses the C20 stock, while the Blue Line also primarily relies on C20 trains. The Red Line uses a mix of C20 and C30 trainsets. Stockholm metro&#x27;s trains are based at several depots, including Hammarby, Högdalen, and depots for the Green Line; Norsborg depot and Nyboda depot for the Red Line; and for the Blue Line.

Train configuration varies depending on the stock type, however a full-length train measures approximately and accommodates around 1,250 passengers, with seating available for 290 to 380 people. C20 trains are typically composed of two or three trainsets connected in double or triple configurations, resulting in trains with six or nine cars. C30 trains consist of two trainsets connected in a double configuration, forming an eight-car train. The now-retired Cx stock operated in six or eight-car configurations. 

The Blue Line, along with the Red Line between Stadion and Mörby Centrum, were built with longer platforms to accommodate ten-car Cx stock trains. However, when the C20 trains were introduced, it became apparent that configurations of four C20 trainsets—equivalent in length to ten Cx stock cars—were too long for the platforms. As a result, ten-car trains only operated on the Blue Line, where most platforms (except at Husby) were designed to accommodate their length. On the Red Line, most platforms were only long enough to accommodate eight-car Cx stock trains. As a result, ten-car trains were never used in service on the Red Line, except at the six stations between Stadion and Mörby Centrum, which could accommodate them.

The naming convention for rolling stock reflects the system&#x27;s history: the prefix A denotes motorised trams, B indicates unmotorised tram trailers, and C is used for metro cars. The Stockholm metro traces its origins to a tramway system, and the older sections of the metro operated as tramways for several years before conversion.

===Current rolling stock===

====C20====

The C20 stock (also branded C25 or C20U during refurbishment) is double-articulated, in length, in width, in height, and weighs . It uses only four bogies, two under the middle part, and one under each end part of car. The car takes 126 seated passengers, and 288 standing passengers. Three such units normally form a train. The C20 stock cars were built between 1997 and 2004 and first entered service in 1998.

A single prototype car designated C20F stock is in use. Built on Bombardier Transportation&#x27;s FICAS technology, it has a lighter body, much thinner side walls, and more space compared to the regular C20, by using a sandwich-like composite construction of the body. It also has air-conditioning for passenger area, whereas standard C20 has air-conditioning only for the driver&#x27;s cab. However only the last 70 C20 units produced (2200-2270) are equipped with air conditioning in the drivers cab. All other C20 units completely lack air conditioning. Therefore units lacking air conditioning are usually placed in the middle of trains and moved to the blue line during the summer, where the air conditioning is the least needed, as it is almost exclusively underground. The C20F weighs , other exterior measurements are the same as for the C20. The C20F has the same number of seats as the C20, but has space for 323 standing passengers.

After about 20 years in service (22 years for the oldest cars and 16 years for the youngest cars), the C20 had reached about half its lifetime, and a refurbishment was necessary. The first refurbished train set (three cars) was officially put into service on November 20, 2020. The refurbishment of all cars was completed in 2024. These refurbished cars, also known as C25, feature an upgraded interior similar to the C30 among other improvements. All original C20 units had been refurbished by February 2024.

====C30====

The C30 is a new articulated train type manufactured by Bombardier Transportation which is delivered since 2018 for use on the red line. The first C30 train entered service on the red line on 11 August 2020. They are formed in semi-permanent four car units with open gangways between cars, and with two bogies under each car. Two such units form a train. Compared to previous stock, the cars have fewer seats arranged in mixed longitudinal/transverse layout for increased capacity, similar to the C1 and refurbished C20 trains. The C30 is the first full Stockholm metro train type to feature air-conditioning in both the passenger compartments and driver&#x27;s cabs and are expected to cost 5 billion kronor.

===Former rolling stock===

====Cx (C1 - C15)====
The name Cx collectively refers to all the older types C1–C15. The last ride with a Cx car in the Stockholm Metro took place on 10 February 2024 on a C14 car. C14 were to in length, in width, to in height, and weigh 29 metric tons. The cars took 48 seated passengers, and 108 to 110 standing passengers. The C14 and C15 trains were built in the mid-1980s. As of 12 January 2024, the C6, C14 and C15 have been taken out of service permanently.

==Infrastructure and Operation==
===Safety and Technology===
The Stockholm metro runs electrically using a third rail with a nominal operating voltage of 650 V DC on line 13, 14, 17, 18 and 19; and 750 V DC on lines 10 and 11. Traffic on the metro operates on left-hand side, similarly to mainline trains in Sweden. When the metro system opened in 1950, cars and trams still drove on the left in Sweden.

The maximum speed is on the Red and Blue Lines and on the Green Line ( at the platforms). Maximum acceleration and deceleration is 0.8 m/s2. The reason for the lower speed limit on the Green Line is due to tighter curves than on the other lines, because the Green Line was built by cut and cover under streets in the inner city, while the other lines are bored at greater depth. Two safety systems exist on the metro: the older system manufactured by Union Switch &amp; Signal in use on the Red and Blue Lines and a modern automatic train operation (ATO) system in use on the Green Line manufactured by Siemens Mobility.

To allow close-running trains with a high level of safety, the metro uses a continuous signal safety system that sends information continually to the train&#x27;s safety system. The signal is picked up from the rail tracks through two antennas placed in front of the first wheel axle and compared with data about the train&#x27;s speed. Automatic braking is triggered if the train exceeds the maximum permitted speed at any time. The driver is given information about the speed limit through a display in the driver&#x27;s cabin; in C20 stock, and in Cx stock outfitted for operation with the new signal system installed on the Green Line, this is a speedometer with a red maximum speed indicator (needle), while the traditional display in the Cx stock is a set of three lights indicating one of three permitted speeds (high, medium, low). The system allows two trains to come close to each other but prevents collisions occurring at speeds greater than . More modern systems also ensure that stop signals are not passed.

Another possibility is automatic train operation, which helps the driver by driving the train automatically. However, the driver still operates the door controls and allows the train to start. As of 2025, ATO is only available on the Green line, where a new signal system was installed in the late-1990s. This signal system, together with the C20 rolling stock, permits the use of ATO. The signalling system on the Red Line was supposed to be replaced with a Communications-based train control (CBTC) system manufactured by Ansaldo STS under a contract awarded by SL in 2010, however SL cancelled said contract in 2017, reportedly after repeated delays in project implementation.

===Graffiti===
Since the mid-1980s, graffiti has been a recurring issue in the Stockholm metro. Previously, graffiti on trains and stations often remained visible for weeks or months. In recent years, stricter zero-tolerance policies have been implemented, with graffiti-covered trains immediately removed from service and station graffiti cleaned within 24 hours.

In 2018, graffiti damage was reported over an area of 166,475 square meters, equivalent to 30 football fields. Costs for addressing graffiti and vandalism reached 192 million SEK in 2020 (approx. €18 million), driven in part by large-scale repairs like replacing damaged windows.

In December 2019, several prolific graffiti offenders, referred to as &quot;storklottrare,&quot; were arrested. In 2022, they were convicted for extensive vandalism committed in 2018 and 2019. Two received prison sentences of 1 and 1.5 years, while a third was given a conditional sentence and fines. They were collectively ordered to pay nearly 2 million SEK (approx. €190,000) in damages. These legal actions were credited with deterring further graffiti activity.

SL also introduced new measures, including fencing, radar-equipped surveillance cameras, and rapid cleaning protocols. By 2022, reported graffiti damage had decreased by 57% compared to 2018, totalling 72,904 square meters (13.5 football fields). Costs dropped to 119 million SEK in 2022 (approx. €11 million), with the metro seeing the largest improvement.

==Art and popular culture==

===Art===
The Stockholm metro is often described as the &quot;world’s longest art gallery,&quot; and is famous for the public art integrated into 94 of its 100 stations, including sculptures, rock formations, mosaics, paintings, light installations, engravings, and reliefs created by over 150 artists. Beyond aesthetics, Region Stockholm believes that art at the stations contributes to a calm and safe environment and reduces vandalism and graffiti, and that travellers find it easier to orient themselves when each station has its own identity.

Advocacy for art on the metro was driven by artists Vera Nilsson and Siri Derkert, who faced resistance from officials and politicians who questioned its relevance and cost. However by 1957, Stockholm City Council had approved the integration of art into the metro, and established a program to commission works for new stations, starting with T-Centralen.

The first major art installations in the Stockholm metro appeared in the 1960s, with Siri Derkert&#x27;s 1965 work at Östermalmstorg Station, featuring sandblasted engravings focused on feminism, world peace, and environmentalism. These early installations often reflected modernist aesthetics and social commentary. In the 1970s, as the metro expanded, including with the opening of the Blue Line, large-scale, immersive artworks became common. Artists collaborated closely with architects, as seen at Solna Centrum (1975), where Anders Åberg and Karl-Olov Björk created a red and green cave-like design addressing urbanisation and environmental issues. In the 1980s and 1990s, the art program diversified, with stations like Kungsträdgården (designed by Ulrik Samuelson) incorporating historical motifs and archaeological elements. At Rissne, a fresco about the history of Earth&#x27;s civilisations runs along both sides of the platform.

Some installations have sparked debate. In 2017, Liv Strömquist’s temporary exhibition &quot;The Night Garden&quot; at Slussen station featured sketches depicting subjects such as menstruation. While some praised the work for addressing taboos, others criticised it as inappropriate for a public setting. SL defended the work as part of its commitment to diverse artistic expressions.

Art projects continue to be an integral part all new station designs. Since 2015, public competitions have been held to select artists for new stations on the Blue and Green lines. These new works are developed in close collaboration with architects and engineers, and often respond to the specific context of each station, reflecting local history, culture, or natural surroundings. For example at Barkarbystaden station, Helena Byström’s work incorporates dynamic video art that references the area’s military aviation history.

===Urban legends===
The modern railway network, which was inaugurated in 1950, has racked up several mythical urban legends over the years, notably involving ghost phenomena, especially of the horror genre. The most famous of these is the legend of the Silver Train (), a silver colored ghost train that traffics the Stockholm Metro and carries dead people to the afterlife. The legend is said to originate from the C5-cars, an aluminium prototype metro train which never received paint and usually ran at night. The C5 carries the nickname of &quot;the Silver Arrow&quot; (&quot;Silverpilen&quot;), which has since carried over to the ghost train.

Another notable urban legend, especially in connection with the Silver Train, surrounds the unfinished Kymlinge metro station, which was built but never taken into service. The legend says no living get off at Kymlinge, only the dead. This is usually combined with the legend of the Silver Train, which is said to only stop at Kymlinge.

==Future==
In 2013, it was announced that agreement had been reached on the future of several extensions. Preliminary planning started in 2016 and revenue service on the first sections is projected to begin in the mid 2020s. In 2017, another agreement was reached regarding several public transportation projects in Stockholm, including a fourth metro line. The extensions, which are the first in 40 years, will add 18 new metro stations making the total number of stations 113.It is the policy of the Stockholm Metro that all new extensions and lines are built underground. Altogether, this amounts to the following new constructions:

===Blue Line to Nacka and the southern suburbs===

From Kungsträdgården, there will be a new station at Sofia on Södermalm, after which the line splits with one branch continuing to Nacka (with three new intermediate stations), and the other to new underground platforms at Gullmarsplan after which it will take over the current Green line branch to Hagsätra. The surface-level stations Globen and Enskede gård on the Hagsätra branch will be closed and replaced by a new underground station at Slakthusområdet. This allows higher frequencies on the Green Line branches to Farsta strand and Skarpnäck which are currently limited by the fact that three branches pass the bottleneck at T-Centralen.

===Blue Line to Barkarby Station===

An extension of the Blue Line north-west from Akalla to Barkarby railway station via Barkarbystaden, a new development on the former site of Barkarby Airport.

===Green Line to Arenastaden===
From Odenplan via the new development at , Södra Hagalund and ending in (roughly around the vicinity of the Strawberry Arena and Westfield Mall of Scandinavia), with construction of this segment expected to finish in 2028. Was originally referred to as the Yellow Line after a competition was held by Stockholm City Council in 2014, but was redesignated as a new branch of the Green Line in May 2023 and the Yellow Line designation was subsequently only used to refer to the below-mentioned Fridhemsplan–Älvsjö subway line

===Yellow Line===
A new, automated line between Fridhemsplan and Älvsjö via Liljeholmen, Årstaberg, Årstafältet and Östbergahöjden (has been renamed since a station at Roslagsbanan is already called Östberga), since May 2023 referred to as the Yellow Line.

===New Depot===
To support the expansion of the Stockholm Metro, the Högdalen depot is being extended with new underground staging areas to service trains on both the Blue and Green lines. A new underground connection will link the depot to the Green line’s Farsta branch.

<text>Dupont Circle is a historic roundabout park and neighborhood of Washington, D.C., located in Northwest D.C. The Dupont Circle neighborhood is bounded approximately by 16th Street NW to the east, 22nd Street NW to the west, M Street NW to the south, and Florida Avenue NW to the north. Much of the neighborhood is listed on the National Register of Historic Places. However, the local government Advisory Neighborhood Commission (ANC 2B) and the Dupont Circle Historic District have slightly different boundaries.

The traffic circle is located at the intersection of Massachusetts Avenue NW, Connecticut Avenue NW, New Hampshire Avenue NW, P Street NW, and 19th Street NW. The circle is named for Rear Admiral Samuel Francis Du Pont. The traffic circle contains the Dupont Circle Fountain in its center.

The neighborhood is known for its high concentration of embassies, many located on Embassy Row, and think tanks, many located on Think Tank Row.

==History==

Dupont Circle is located in the &quot;Old City&quot; of Washington, D.C., the area planned by architect Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant that remained largely undeveloped until after the American Civil War, when there was a large influx of new residents. Based on the original L&#x27;Enfant plan, the area occupied by the circle was intended to be rectangular in shape, similar to Farragut Square. Dupont Circle was once home to a brickyard and slaughterhouse. There also was a creek, Slash Run, that began near 15th Street NW and Columbia Road NW, ran from 16th Street near Adams Morgan, through Kalorama and within a block of Dupont Circle, but the creek has since been enclosed in a sewer line. Improvements made in the 1870s by a board of public works headed by Alexander &quot;Boss&quot; Shepherd transformed the area into a fashionable residential neighborhood.

In 1871, the U.S. Army Corps of Engineers began construction of the traffic circle, then called Pacific Circle, as specified in L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s plan. On February 25, 1882, Congress renamed it &quot;Dupont Circle&quot;, and authorized a memorial statue of Samuel Francis Du Pont, in recognition of his service as a rear admiral during the Civil War. Unveiled on December 20, 1884, the statue was sculpted by Launt Thompson, and the circle was landscaped with exotic flowers and ornamental trees. Several prominent duPont family members deemed it too insignificant to honor their ancestor, so they secured permission to move the statue to Rockford Park in Wilmington in 1917, and commissioned Henry Bacon and Daniel Chester French to design the fountain that sits in Dupont Circle today. In 1920, the current double-tiered white marble fountain replaced the statue. Daniel Chester French and Henry Bacon, the co-creators of the Lincoln Memorial, designed the fountain, which features carvings of three classical figures symbolizing the sea, the stars and the wind on the fountain&#x27;s shaft.


In 1876, the second house located directly in Dupont Circle was built by a wealthy merchant by the name of William M. Galt.

During the 1870s and 1880s, mansions were built along Massachusetts Avenue, one of Washington&#x27;s grand avenues, and townhouses were built throughout the neighborhood. In 1872, the British built a new embassy on Connecticut Avenue, at N Street NW. Stewart&#x27;s Castle was built in 1873 on the north side of the circle, the James G. Blaine Mansion was built on the west side in 1882, and the Leiter House was built on the north side in 1893. By the 1920s, Connecticut Avenue was more commercial in character, with numerous shops. Some residences, including Senator Philetus Sawyer&#x27;s mansion at Connecticut and R Street, were demolished to make way for office buildings and shops. The Patterson House, at 15 Dupont Circle, served as a temporary residence for President Calvin Coolidge while the actual White House was being repaired in 1927. In 1933, the National Park Service took over administering the circle, and added sandboxes for children, though these were removed a few years later.

Connecticut Avenue was widened in the late 1920s, and increased traffic in the neighborhood caused a great deal of congestion in the circle, making it difficult for pedestrians to get around. Medians were installed in 1948, in the circle, to separate the through traffic on Massachusetts Avenue from the local traffic, and traffic signals were added. In 1949, traffic tunnels and an underground streetcar station were built under the circle by Capital Transit, the company produced by the consolidation of D.C.&#x27;s streetcar lines. The tunnels enabled trams and vehicles traveling along Connecticut Avenue to pass more quickly past the circle. When streetcar service ended in 1962, the entrances to the underground station were closed. The space has since been transformed and reopened as the Dupont Underground art space.
The neighborhood declined after World War II and particularly after the 1968 riots, but began to enjoy a resurgence in the 1970s, fueled by urban pioneers seeking an alternative lifestyle. The neighborhood took on a bohemian feel and became popular among the gay and lesbian community. Along with The Castro in San Francisco, Hillcrest in San Diego, Greenwich Village in New York City, Boystown in Chicago, Oak Lawn in Dallas, Montrose in Houston, and West Hollywood in Los Angeles, Dupont Circle is considered a historic locale in the development of American gay identity. D.C.&#x27;s first gay bookstore, Lambda Rising, opened in 1974 and gained notoriety nationwide. In 1975, the store ran the world&#x27;s first gay-oriented television commercial.

Gentrification accelerated in the 1980s and 1990s, and the area is now a more mainstream and trendy location with coffeehouses, restaurants, bars, fast casual food, and upscale retail stores. Since 1997, a weekly farmers market has operated on 20th Street NW.

== Architecture ==

The area&#x27;s rowhouses, primarily built before 1900, feature variations on the Queen Anne and Richardsonian Romanesque revival styles. Rarer are the palatial mansions and large freestanding houses that line the broad, tree-lined diagonal avenues that intersect the circle. Many of these larger dwellings were built in the styles popular between 1895 and 1910.

One such grand residence is the marble and limestone Patterson Mansion at 15 Dupont Circle. This Italianate mansion, the only survivor of the many mansions that once ringed the circle, was built in 1901 by New York architect Stanford White for Robert Patterson, editor of the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, and his wife Nellie, heiress to the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; fortune. Upon Mrs. Patterson&#x27;s incapacitation in the early 1920s, the house passed into the hands of her daughter, Cissy Patterson, who made it a hub of Washington social life. The house served as temporary quarters for President and Mrs. Calvin Coolidge in 1927 while the White House underwent renovation. The Coolidges welcomed Charles Lindbergh as a houseguest after his historic transatlantic flight. Lindbergh made several public appearances at the house, waving to roaring crowds from the second-story balcony, and befriended the Patterson Family, with whom he increasingly came to share isolationist and pro-German views. Cissy Patterson later acquired the &quot;Washington Times-Herald&quot; (sold to &quot;The Washington Post&quot; in 1954) and declared journalistic warfare on Franklin D. Roosevelt from 15 Dupont Circle, continuing throughout World War II to push her policies, which were echoed in the &quot;New York Daily News&quot;, run by her brother Joseph Medill Patterson, and the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, run by their first cousin, Colonel Robert R. McCormick.
===Strivers&#x27; Section===
Today&#x27;s Dupont Circle includes the Strivers&#x27; Section, a small residential area west of 16th Street roughly between Swann Street and Florida Avenue. The Strivers&#x27; Section was an enclave of upper-middle-class African Americans—often community leaders—in the late 19th and early 20th centuries. The area includes a row of houses on 17th Street owned by Frederick Douglass and occupied by his son. It takes its name from a turn-of-the-century writer who described the district as &quot;the Striver&#x27;s section, a community of Negro aristocracy&quot;.

The area, which was once considered an overlap of the Dupont Circle and Shaw neighborhoods, is today a historic district. Many of its buildings are the original Edwardian-era residences, along with several apartment and condominium buildings and a few small businesses.

==Landmarks==

===Traffic circle===
The neighborhood is centered around the traffic circle, which is divided between two counterclockwise roads. The outer road serves all the intersecting streets, while access to the inner road is limited to through traffic on Massachusetts Avenue. Connecticut Avenue passes under the circle via a tunnel; vehicles on Connecticut Avenue can access the circle via service roads that branch from Connecticut near N Street and R Street.

The park within the circle is maintained by the National Park Service. The central fountain designed by Daniel Chester French provides seating, and long, curved benches around the central area were installed in 1964. The park within the circle is a gathering place for those wishing to play chess on the permanent stone chessboards. Tom Murphy, a homeless championship chess player, was a resident. The park has also been the location of political rallies, such as those supporting gay rights and those protesting the 2003 invasion of Iraq, the World Bank, and the International Monetary Fund.

In 1999, Thelma Billy was arrested handing out Thanksgiving dinner to the homeless.
In 2009, a tug of war was sponsored by the Washington Project for the Arts.

In 2014, the city proposed to turn an concrete sidewalk on the south side of the traffic circle into a &quot;kinetic park&quot;. Previously occupied by bike lockers, the parklet was repaved with 100 PaveGen pavers, which generate electricity when people walk on them. Designers ZGF Architects said the project would rebuild the sidewalk and curbs and add seven granite benches, six bollard bicycle racks, and two flower beds. The pavers were expected to &quot;generate 456.25 kilowatts of energy annually&quot;, according to Washington Business Journal, and power lights under each bench. The $300,000 project opened in November 2016.

===Embassies===
The Dupont Circle neighborhood is home to numerous embassies, many of which are located in historic residences. The Thomas T. Gaff House serves as the Colombian ambassador&#x27;s residence, and the Walsh-McLean House is home to the Indonesian embassy. Located east of Dupont Circle on Massachusetts Avenue is the Clarence Moore House, now serving as the Embassy of Uzbekistan, and the Emily J. Wilkins House, which formerly housed the Australian embassy and now is occupied by the Peruvian Chancery. Iraq operates a consular services office in the William J. Boardman House on P Street.

===Other landmarks===
Other landmarks, many of which are listed on the National Register of Historic Places, include the International Temple, Embassy Gulf Service Station, Christian Heurich Mansion (also known as Brewmaster&#x27;s Castle), Whittemore House (headquarters to the Woman&#x27;s National Democratic Club), the Brigadier General George P. Scriven House (headquarters to the National Society Colonial Dames XVII Century), and the Phillips Collection, the country&#x27;s first museum of modern art. The Richard H. Townsend House located on Massachusetts Avenue now houses the Cosmos Club. Across Massachusetts Avenue, the historic Anderson House, owned by the Society of the Cincinnati, is open daily for tours. The Dumbarton Bridge, also known as the Buffalo Bridge, carries Q Street over Rock Creek Park and into Georgetown and was constructed in 1883. The Nuns of the Battlefield sculpture, which serves as a tribute to over 600 nuns who nursed soldiers of both armies during the Civil War, was erected in 1924. The Mansion on O Street a luxury boutique hotel, private club, events venue and museum has been a fixture in Dupont Circle for over 30 years and includes over 100 rooms and 32 secret doors. Also overlooking the square is The Dupont Circle Hotel. Two disused semicircular trolley tunnels follow the outline of the circle; the one on the east is currently Dupont Underground, an art and performance space.

===Institutions===

In addition to its residential components, consisting primarily of high-priced apartments and condominiums, Dupont Circle is home to some of the nation&#x27;s most prestigious think tanks and research institutions, including the American Enterprise Institute, the Brookings Institution, the Carnegie Endowment for International Peace, the Institute for Policy Studies, the Aspen Institute, the German Marshall Fund, the Center for Global Development, the Stimson Center, the Eurasia Center, and the Peterson Institute. The renowned Paul H. Nitze School of Advanced International Studies (SAIS) of Johns Hopkins is located less than two blocks from the circle. Dupont Circle is also home to the Founding Church of Scientology museum and Scientology&#x27;s National Affairs Office. The Phillips Collection, the nation&#x27;s first museum of modern art, is located near the circle; its most famous and popular work on display is Renoir&#x27;s giant festive canvas &quot;Luncheon of the Boating Party&quot;. Additionally, the national headquarters of the Jewish War Veterans of the United States of America, the nation&#x27;s oldest veterans organization, the National Museum of American Jewish Military History, and the Washington, D.C. Jewish Community Center are also located in Dupont Circle.

==Demographics==
Dupont Circle roughly coincides with the following five Census tracts, which had a total population of 15,099 in 2020. The area is roughly 70% non-Hispanic (NH) White, 10% Hispanic, 9% NH Asian, 7% NH Black and 4% NH Multiracial.

==Transportation==

Dupont Circle is served by the Dupont Circle station on the Red Line of the Washington Metro. There are two entrances: north of the circle at Q Street NW and south of the circle at 19th Street NW. The northern entrance is framed by a quote from Walt Whitman&#x27;s 1865 poem, &quot;The Wound-Dresser&quot;, that was carved into the entrance in 2007 and echoes the AIDS crisis of the 1980s and 1990s.

==Annual neighborhood events==

===Capital Pride===

Capital Pride is an annual LGBT pride festival held each June in Washington. , the festival is the fourth-largest LGBT pride event in the United States, with over 200,000 people in attendance. The Capital Pride parade takes place annually on Saturday during the festival and travels through the streets of the neighborhood. Dupont Circle is host to the parade, and the street festival is held in Penn Quarter.

===High Heel Race===

<doc id="363548" wikidata="Q158145" url="?curid=363548" title="Langness Peninsula">
<text>Langness () is a peninsula which protrudes two kilometres at the southern extremity of the Isle of Man. Signifying a cape or extended promontory, &quot;Langness&quot; literally means &quot;long promontory&quot; in Old Norse. Formerly an island, Langness was eventually joined to the mainland by the movement and deposition of material along Castletown Bay to form a tombolo. The small community of Derbyhaven is situated on the east coast of this isthmus, which lies close to Castletown, Isle of Man.

==History==
The old Manx name for Langness was &quot;Oaie Ny Baatyn Marroo&quot;, which translates as the &quot;Grave yard of the Lost Ships&quot;. Before Langness Lighthouse was built on Dreswick Point in 1880, wrecks on the peninsula were common. During periods of low visibility the only foghorn was a cow&#x27;s horn which would be blown by a party of men on the shore – the sound of which carried for half a mile at best.

===The Potato Grave===
Near the lighthouse is a turf-covered mound, known as the potato grave. In 1832 a ship carrying Irish workers to the Isle of Man to dig potatoes was lost with all hands, and 32 bodies were washed ashore. It was customary on the island to bury a body washed ashore behind a hedge in the place it had been found, and so a communal grave was dug and all 32 bodies placed within it. No stone marks the grave; the only memorial of the victims is a turf-covered mound.

==Geography==
The peninsula is close to Ronaldsway Airport, and a good view of the peninsula can be obtained from the port side of aircraft landing on the westerly facing runway. It is also within easy walking distance from Castletown, and the peninsula itself features an interesting nature trail. Coastal erosion has carved parts of the coast into sea arches, which are also of geological interest as they contain an unconformity: parts of the rocks are nearly 500 million years old, other parts are some 150 million years younger.

At the southern tip of the peninsula is Dreswick Point, the southernmost point of the Manx mainland, whilst St Michael&#x27;s Isle (popularly known as Fort Island) is connected at the northern end of the peninsula by a narrow causeway.

A feature of the peninsula is the Herring Tower, a daymark built in 1811. Other structures to be found on the peninsula include the remains of a World War II-era gun training range, close to the lighthouse, and a memorial to local naturalist Henry Madoc, who was also the island&#x27;s Chief Constable.

==Natural history==
The peninsula is a popular haunt of birdwatchers, and has bird life ranging from golden plovers and curlews to merlins and kestrels. St. Michael&#x27;s Island is a bird sanctuary.

Dolphins and porpoises can also occasionally seen in the waters off the peninsula.

==Leisure==
The Castletown Golf &amp; Country Club (formerly also a hotel, closed since 2007) is set on the peninsula and the isthmus connecting it with Derbyhaven and has been the scene of many international championships. In 2005, the Duke of York Young Champions Trophy golf championships were held at the club.

<doc id="363551" wikidata="Q1673406" url="?curid=363551" title="Universal enveloping algebra">
<text>In mathematics, the universal enveloping algebra of a Lie algebra is the unital associative algebra whose representations correspond precisely to the representations of that Lie algebra.

Universal enveloping algebras are used in the representation theory of Lie groups and Lie algebras. For example, Verma modules can be constructed as quotients of the universal enveloping algebra. In addition, the enveloping algebra gives a precise definition for the Casimir operators. Because Casimir operators commute with all elements of a Lie algebra, they can be used to classify representations. The precise definition also allows the importation of Casimir operators into other areas of mathematics, specifically, those that have a differential algebra. They also play a central role in some recent developments in mathematics. In particular, their dual provides a commutative example of the objects studied in non-commutative geometry, the quantum groups. This dual can be shown, by the Gelfand–Naimark theorem, to contain the C* algebra of the corresponding Lie group. This relationship generalizes to the idea of Tannaka–Krein duality between compact topological groups and their representations.

From an analytic viewpoint, the universal enveloping algebra of the Lie algebra of a Lie group may be identified with the algebra of left-invariant differential operators on the group.

==Informal construction==
The idea of the universal enveloping algebra is to embed a Lie algebra formula_1 into an associative algebra formula_2 with identity in such a way that the abstract bracket operation in formula_1 corresponds to the commutator formula_4 in formula_2 and the algebra formula_2 is generated by the elements of formula_1. There may be many ways to make such an embedding, but there is a unique &quot;largest&quot; such formula_2, called the universal enveloping algebra of formula_1.

===Generators and relations===
Let formula_1 be a Lie algebra, assumed finite-dimensional for simplicity, with basis formula_11. Let formula_12 be the structure constants for this basis, so that
:formula_13
Then the universal enveloping algebra is the associative algebra (with identity) generated by elements formula_14 subject to the relations
:formula_15
and &quot;no other relations&quot;. Below we will make this &quot;generators and relations&quot; construction more precise by constructing the universal enveloping algebra as a quotient of the tensor algebra over formula_16.

Consider, for example, the Lie algebra sl(2,C), spanned by the matrices
:formula_17
which satisfy the commutation relations formula_18, formula_19, and formula_20. The universal enveloping algebra of sl(2,C) is then the algebra generated by three elements formula_21 subject to the relations
:formula_22
and no other relations. We emphasize that the universal enveloping algebra &quot;is not&quot; the same as (or contained in) the algebra of formula_23 matrices. For example, the formula_23 matrix formula_25 satisfies formula_26, as is easily verified. But in the universal enveloping algebra, the element formula_27 does not satisfy formula_28 because we do not impose this relation in the construction of the enveloping algebra. Indeed, it follows from the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem (discussed § below) that the elements formula_29 are all linearly independent in the universal enveloping algebra.

===Finding a basis===
In general, elements of the universal enveloping algebra are linear combinations of products of the generators in all possible orders. Using the defining relations of the universal enveloping algebra, we can always re-order those products in a particular order, say with all the factors of formula_30 first, then factors of formula_31, etc. For example, whenever we have a term that contains formula_32 (in the &quot;wrong&quot; order), we can use the relations to rewrite this as formula_33 plus a linear combination of the formula_34&#x27;s. Doing this sort of thing repeatedly eventually converts any element into a linear combination of terms in ascending order. Thus, elements of the form
:formula_35
with the formula_36&#x27;s being non-negative integers, span the enveloping algebra. (We allow formula_37, meaning that we allow terms in which no factors of formula_34 occur.) The Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem, discussed below, asserts that these elements are linearly independent and thus form a basis for the universal enveloping algebra. In particular, the universal enveloping algebra is always infinite dimensional.

The Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem implies, in particular, that the elements formula_39 themselves are linearly independent. It is therefore common—if potentially confusing—to identify the formula_34&#x27;s with the generators formula_41 of the original Lie algebra. That is to say, we identify the original Lie algebra as the subspace of its universal enveloping algebra spanned by the generators. Although formula_1 may be an algebra of formula_43 matrices, the universal enveloping of formula_1 does not consist of (finite-dimensional) matrices. In particular, there is no finite-dimensional algebra that contains the universal enveloping of formula_1; the universal enveloping algebra is always infinite dimensional. Thus, in the case of sl(2,C), if we identify our Lie algebra as a subspace of its universal enveloping algebra, we must not interpret formula_25, formula_47 and formula_48 as formula_23 matrices, but rather as symbols with no further properties (other than the commutation relations).

===Formalities===
The formal construction of the universal enveloping algebra takes the above ideas, and wraps them in notation and terminology that makes it more convenient to work with. The most important difference is that the free associative algebra used in the above is narrowed to the tensor algebra, so that the product of symbols is understood to be the tensor product. The commutation relations are imposed by constructing a quotient space of the tensor algebra quotiented by the &quot;smallest&quot; two-sided ideal containing elements of the form formula_50. The universal enveloping algebra is the &quot;largest&quot; unital associative algebra generated by elements of formula_16 with a Lie bracket compatible with the original Lie algebra.

==Formal definition==
Recall that every Lie algebra formula_1 is in particular a vector space. Thus, one is free to construct the tensor algebra formula_53 from it. The tensor algebra is a free algebra: it simply contains all possible tensor products of all possible vectors in formula_1, without any restrictions whatsoever on those products.

That is, one constructs the space
:formula_55

where formula_56 is the tensor product, and formula_57 is the direct sum of vector spaces. Here, is the field over which the Lie algebra is defined. From here, through to the remainder of this article, the tensor product is always explicitly shown. Many authors omit it, since, with practice, its location can usually be inferred from context. Here, a very explicit approach is adopted, to minimize any possible confusion about the meanings of expressions.

The first step in the construction is to &quot;lift&quot; the Lie bracket from the Lie algebra formula_1 (where it is defined) to the tensor algebra formula_53 (where it is not), so that one can coherently work with the Lie bracket of two tensors. The lifting is done recursively. Let us define

:formula_60

and

:formula_61

It is straightforward to verify that the above definition is bilinear and skew-symmetric; one can also show that it obeys the Jacobi identity. The final result is that one has a Lie bracket that is consistently defined on all of formula_62 one says that it has been &quot;lifted&quot; to all of formula_53 in the conventional sense of a &quot;lift&quot; from a base space (here, the Lie algebra) to a covering space (here, the tensor algebra).

The result of this lifting is that formula_53 becomes a Poisson algebra: a unital associative algebra with a Lie bracket that is compatible with the original Lie algebra bracket (by construction). It is not the &quot;smallest&quot; such algebra, however; it contains far more elements than needed. One can get something smaller by projecting back down. The universal enveloping algebra formula_65 of formula_1 is defined as the quotient space

:formula_67

where the equivalence relation formula_68 is given by

:formula_69

for all formula_70. That is, the Lie bracket defines the equivalence relation used to perform the quotienting. The result is still a unital associative algebra, and one can still take the Lie bracket of any two members. Computing the result is straight-forward, if one keeps in mind that each element of formula_65 can be understood as a coset: one just takes the bracket as usual, and searches for the coset that contains the result. It is the &quot;smallest&quot; such algebra; one cannot find anything smaller that still obeys the axioms of an associative algebra.

The universal enveloping algebra is what remains of the tensor algebra after modding out the Poisson algebra structure. (This is a non-trivial statement; the tensor algebra has a rather complicated structure: it is, among other things, a Hopf algebra; the Poisson algebra is likewise rather complicated, with many peculiar properties. It is compatible with the tensor algebra, and so the modding can be performed. The Hopf algebra structure is conserved; this is what leads to its many novel applications, e.g. in string theory. However, for the purposes of the formal definition, none of this particularly matters.)

The construction can be performed in a slightly different (but equivalent) way. Consider the two-sided ideal generated by elements of the form

:formula_72

for formula_73. (Note that these generators are elements of formula_74.) A general member of the ideal will be linear combinations of elements of the form

:formula_75

where all lower-case letters are elements of formula_1. Since is an ideal, we can quotient by it. The universal enveloping algebra can then be defined as

:formula_77

===Superalgebras and other generalizations===
The above construction focuses on Lie algebras and on the Lie bracket, and its skewness and antisymmetry. To some degree, these properties are incidental to the construction. Consider instead some (arbitrary) algebra (not a Lie algebra) over a vector space, that is, a vector space formula_78 endowed with multiplication formula_79 that takes elements formula_80 &quot;If&quot; the multiplication is bilinear, then the same construction and definitions can go through. One starts by lifting formula_81 up to formula_82 so that the lifted formula_81 obeys all of the same properties that the base formula_81 does – symmetry or antisymmetry or whatever. The lifting is done &quot;exactly&quot; as before, starting with
:formula_85

This is consistent precisely because the tensor product is bilinear, and the multiplication is bilinear. The rest of the lift is performed so as to preserve multiplication as a homomorphism. &quot;By definition&quot;, one writes

:formula_86
and also that
:formula_87
This extension is consistent by appeal to a lemma on free objects: since the tensor algebra is a free algebra, any homomorphism on its generating set can be extended to the entire algebra. Everything else proceeds as described above: upon completion, one has a unital associative algebra; one can take a quotient in either of the two ways described above.

The above is exactly how the universal enveloping algebra for Lie superalgebras is constructed. One need only to carefully keep track of the sign, when permuting elements. In this case, the (anti-)commutator of the superalgebra lifts to an (anti-)commuting Poisson bracket.

Another possibility is to use something other than the tensor algebra as the covering algebra. One such possibility is to use the exterior algebra; that is, to replace every occurrence of the tensor product by the exterior product. If the base algebra is a Lie algebra, then the result is the Gerstenhaber algebra; it is the exterior algebra of the corresponding Lie group. As before, it has a grading naturally coming from the grading on the exterior algebra. (The Gerstenhaber algebra should not be confused with the Poisson superalgebra; both invoke anticommutation, but in different ways.)

The construction has also been generalized for Malcev algebras, Bol algebras and left alternative algebras.

==Universal property==
The universal enveloping algebra, or rather the universal enveloping algebra together with the canonical map formula_88, possesses a universal property. Suppose we have any Lie algebra map
:formula_89
to a unital associative algebra (with Lie bracket in given by the commutator). More explicitly, this means that we assume
:formula_90
for all formula_91. Then there exists a &quot;unique&quot; unital algebra homomorphism

:formula_92
such that
:formula_93

where formula_94 is the canonical map. (The map formula_95 is obtained by embedding formula_1 into its tensor algebra and then composing with the quotient map to the universal enveloping algebra. This map is an embedding, by the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem.)

To put it differently, if formula_97 is a linear map into a unital algebra formula_98 satisfying formula_90, then formula_100 extends to an algebra homomorphism of formula_101. Since formula_102 is generated by elements of formula_1, the map formula_104 must be uniquely determined by the requirement that
:formula_105.
The point is that because there are no other relations in the universal enveloping algebra besides those coming from the commutation relations of formula_1, the map formula_104 is well defined, independent of how one writes a given element formula_108 as a linear combination of products of Lie algebra elements.

The universal property of the enveloping algebra immediately implies that every representation of formula_1 acting on a vector space formula_78 extends uniquely to a representation of formula_65. (Take formula_112.) This observation is important because it allows (as discussed below) the Casimir elements to act on formula_78. These operators (from the center of formula_65) act as scalars and provide important information about the representations. The quadratic Casimir element is of particular importance in this regard.

===Other algebras===
Although the canonical construction, given above, can be applied to other algebras, the result, in general, does not have the universal property. Thus, for example, when the construction is applied to Jordan algebras, the resulting enveloping algebra contains the special Jordan algebras, but not the exceptional ones: that is, it does not envelope the Albert algebras. Likewise, the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem, below, constructs a basis for an enveloping algebra; it just won&#x27;t be universal. Similar remarks hold for the Lie superalgebras.

==Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem ==

The Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem gives a precise description of formula_65. This can be done in either one of two different ways: either by reference to an explicit vector basis on the Lie algebra, or in a coordinate-free fashion.

===Using basis elements===
One way is to suppose that the Lie algebra can be given a totally ordered basis, that is, it is the free vector space of a totally ordered set. Recall that a free vector space is defined as the space of all finitely supported functions from a set to the field (finitely supported means that only finitely many values are non-zero); it can be given a basis formula_116 such that formula_117 is the indicator function for formula_118. Let formula_119 be the injection into the tensor algebra; this is used to give the tensor algebra a basis as well. This is done by lifting: given some arbitrary sequence of formula_120, one defines the extension of formula_95 to be

:formula_122

The Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem then states that one can obtain a basis for formula_65 from the above, by enforcing the total order of onto the algebra. That is, formula_65 has a basis

:formula_125

where formula_126, the ordering being that of total order on the set . The proof of the theorem involves noting that, if one starts with out-of-order basis elements, these can always be swapped by using the commutator (together with the structure constants). The hard part of the proof is establishing that the final result is unique and independent of the order in which the swaps were performed.

This basis should be easily recognized as the basis of a symmetric algebra. That is, the underlying vector spaces of formula_65 and the symmetric algebra are isomorphic, and it is the PBW theorem that shows that this is so. See, however, the section on the algebra of symbols, below, for a more precise statement of the nature of the isomorphism.

It is useful, perhaps, to split the process into two steps. In the first step, one constructs the free Lie algebra: this is what one gets, if one mods out by all commutators, without specifying what the values of the commutators are. The second step is to apply the specific commutation relations from formula_128 The first step is universal, and does not depend on the specific formula_128 It can also be precisely defined: the basis elements are given by Hall words, a special case of which are the Lyndon words; these are explicitly constructed to behave appropriately as commutators.

===Coordinate-free===
One can also state the theorem in a coordinate-free fashion, avoiding the use of total orders and basis elements. This is convenient when there are difficulties in defining the basis vectors, as there can be for infinite-dimensional Lie algebras. It also gives a more natural form that is more easily extended to other kinds of algebras. This is accomplished by constructing a filtration formula_130 whose limit is the universal enveloping algebra formula_131

First, a notation is needed for an ascending sequence of subspaces of the tensor algebra. Let
:formula_132
where
:formula_133

is the -times tensor product of formula_128 The formula_135 form a filtration:
:formula_136

More precisely, this is a filtered algebra, since the filtration preserves the algebraic properties of the subspaces. Note that the limit of this filtration is the tensor algebra formula_137

It was already established, above, that quotienting by the ideal is a natural transformation that takes one from formula_53 to formula_131 This also works naturally on the subspaces, and so one obtains a filtration formula_130 whose limit is the universal enveloping algebra formula_131

Next, define the space
:formula_142
This is the space formula_130 modulo all of the subspaces formula_144 of strictly smaller filtration degree. Note that formula_145 is &quot;not at all&quot; the same as the leading term formula_146 of the filtration, as one might naively surmise. It is not constructed through a set subtraction mechanism associated with the filtration.

Quotienting formula_130 by formula_148 has the effect of setting all Lie commutators defined in formula_130 to zero. One can see this by observing that the commutator of a pair of elements whose products lie in formula_150 actually gives an element in formula_148. This is perhaps not immediately obvious: to get this result, one must repeatedly apply the commutation relations, and turn the crank. The essence of the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem is that it is always possible to do this, and that the result is unique.

Since commutators of elements whose products are defined in formula_150 lie in formula_148, the quotienting that defines formula_145 has the effect of setting all commutators to zero. What PBW states is that the commutator of elements in formula_145 is necessarily zero. What is left are the elements that are not expressible as commutators.

In this way, one is lead immediately to the symmetric algebra. This is the algebra where all commutators vanish. It can be defined as a filtration formula_156 of symmetric tensor products formula_157. Its limit is the symmetric algebra formula_158. It is constructed by appeal to the same notion of naturality as before. One starts with the same tensor algebra, and just uses a different ideal, the ideal that makes all elements commute:

:formula_159

Thus, one can view the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem as stating that formula_160 is isomorphic to the symmetric algebra formula_158, both as a vector space &quot;and&quot; as a commutative algebra.

The formula_145 also form a filtered algebra; its limit is formula_163 This is the associated graded algebra of the filtration.

The construction above, due to its use of quotienting, implies that the limit of formula_160 is isomorphic to formula_131 In more general settings, with loosened conditions, one finds that formula_166 is a projection, and one then gets PBW-type theorems for the associated graded algebra of a filtered algebra. To emphasize this, the notation formula_167 is sometimes used for formula_168 serving to remind that it is the filtered algebra.

===Other algebras===
The theorem, applied to Jordan algebras, yields the exterior algebra, rather than the symmetric algebra. In essence, the construction zeros out the anti-commutators. The resulting algebra is &quot;an&quot; enveloping algebra, but is not universal. As mentioned above, it fails to envelop the exceptional Jordan algebras.

==Left-invariant differential operators==
Suppose formula_169 is a real Lie group with Lie algebra formula_1. Following the modern approach, we may identify formula_1 with the space of left-invariant vector fields (i.e., first-order left-invariant differential operators). Specifically, if we initially think of formula_1 as the tangent space to formula_169 at the identity, then each vector in formula_1 has a unique left-invariant extension. We then identify the vector in the tangent space with the associated left-invariant vector field. Now, the commutator (as differential operators) of two left-invariant vector fields is again a vector field and again left-invariant. We can then define the bracket operation on formula_1 as the commutator on the associated left-invariant vector fields. This definition agrees with any other standard definition of the bracket structure on the Lie algebra of a Lie group.

We may then consider left-invariant differential operators of arbitrary order. Every such operator formula_98 can be expressed (non-uniquely) as a linear combination of products of left-invariant vector fields. The collection of all left-invariant differential operators on formula_169 forms an algebra, denoted formula_178. It can be shown that formula_178 is isomorphic to the universal enveloping algebra formula_65.

In the case that formula_1 arises as the Lie algebra of a real Lie group, one can use left-invariant differential operators to give an analytic proof of the Poincaré–Birkhoff–Witt theorem. Specifically, the algebra formula_178 of left-invariant differential operators is generated by elements (the left-invariant vector fields) that satisfy the commutation relations of formula_1. Thus, by the universal property of the enveloping algebra, formula_178 is a quotient of formula_65. Thus, if the PBW basis elements are linearly independent in formula_178—which one can establish analytically—they must certainly be linearly independent in formula_65. (And, at this point, the isomorphism of formula_178 with formula_65 is apparent.)

==Algebra of symbols==
The underlying vector space of formula_158 may be given a new algebra structure so that formula_65 and formula_158 are isomorphic &quot;as associative algebras&quot;. This leads to the concept of the algebra of symbols formula_193: the space of symmetric polynomials, endowed with a product, the formula_194, that places the algebraic structure of the Lie algebra onto what is otherwise a standard associative algebra. That is, what the PBW theorem obscures (the commutation relations) the algebra of symbols restores into the spotlight.

The algebra is obtained by taking elements of formula_158 and replacing each generator formula_196 by an indeterminate, commuting variable formula_197 to obtain the space of symmetric polynomials formula_198 over the field formula_199. Indeed, the correspondence is trivial: one simply substitutes the symbol formula_197 for formula_196. The resulting polynomial is called the symbol of the corresponding element of formula_158. The inverse map is
:formula_203
that replaces each symbol formula_197 by formula_196. The algebraic structure is obtained by requiring that the product formula_194 act as an isomorphism, that is, so that
:formula_207
for polynomials formula_208

The primary issue with this construction is that formula_209 is not trivially, inherently a member of formula_65, as written, and that one must first perform a tedious reshuffling of the basis elements (applying the structure constants as needed) to obtain an element of formula_65 in the properly ordered basis. An explicit expression for this product can be given: this is the Berezin formula. It follows essentially from the Baker–Campbell–Hausdorff formula for the product of two elements of a Lie group.

A closed form expression is given by

:formula_212

where
:formula_213
and formula_214 is just formula_81 in the chosen basis.

The universal enveloping algebra of the Heisenberg algebra is the Weyl algebra (modulo the relation that the center be the unit); here, the formula_194 product is called the Moyal product.

==Representation theory==
The universal enveloping algebra preserves the representation theory: the representations of formula_1 correspond in a one-to-one manner to the modules over formula_65. In more abstract terms, the abelian category of all representations of formula_1 is isomorphic to the abelian category of all left modules over formula_65.

The representation theory of semisimple Lie algebras rests on the observation that there is an isomorphism, known as the Kronecker product:
:formula_221
for Lie algebras formula_222. The isomorphism follows from a lifting of the embedding
:formula_223
where
:formula_224
is just the canonical embedding (with subscripts, respectively for algebras one and two). It is straightforward to verify that this embedding lifts, given the prescription above. See, however, the discussion of the bialgebra structure in the article on tensor algebras for a review of some of the finer points of doing so: in particular, the shuffle product employed there corresponds to the Wigner-Racah coefficients, i.e. the 6j and 9j-symbols, etc.

Also important is that the universal enveloping algebra of a free Lie algebra is isomorphic to the free associative algebra.

Construction of representations typically proceeds by building the Verma modules of the highest weights.

In a typical context where formula_1 is acting by &quot;infinitesimal transformations&quot;, the elements of formula_65 act like differential operators, of all orders. (See, for example, the realization of the universal enveloping algebra as left-invariant differential operators on the associated group, as discussed above.)

==Casimir operators==

The center formula_227 of formula_65 can be identified with the centralizer of formula_1 in formula_131 Any element of formula_227 must commute with all of formula_232 and in particular with the canonical embedding of formula_1 into formula_234 Because of this, the center is directly useful for classifying representations of formula_1. For a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra, the Casimir operators form a distinguished basis from the center formula_227. These may be constructed as follows.

The center formula_227 corresponds to linear combinations of all elements formula_238 that commute with all elements formula_239 that is, for which formula_240 That is, they are in the kernel of formula_241 Thus, a technique is needed for computing that kernel. What we have is the action of the adjoint representation on formula_242 we need it on formula_131 The easiest route is to note that formula_244 is a derivation, and that the space of derivations can be lifted to formula_53 and thus to formula_131 This implies that both of these are differential algebras.

By definition, formula_247 is a derivation on formula_1 if it obeys Leibniz&#x27;s law:

:formula_249

(When formula_1 is the space of left invariant vector fields on a group formula_169, the Lie bracket is that of vector fields.) The lifting is performed by &quot;defining&quot;
:formula_252

Since formula_253 is a derivation for any formula_254 the above defines formula_253 acting on formula_53 and formula_131

From the PBW theorem, it is clear that all central elements are linear combinations of symmetric homogeneous polynomials in the basis elements formula_120 of the Lie algebra. The Casimir invariants are the irreducible homogeneous polynomials of a given, fixed degree. That is, given a basis formula_120, a Casimir operator of order formula_81 has the form

:formula_261

where there are formula_81 terms in the tensor product, and formula_263 is a completely symmetric tensor of order formula_81 belonging to the adjoint representation. That is, formula_263 can be (should be) thought of as an element of formula_266 Recall that the adjoint representation is given directly by the structure constants, and so an explicit indexed form of the above equations can be given, in terms of the Lie algebra basis; this is originally a theorem of Israel Gel&#x27;fand. That is, from formula_267, it follows that

:formula_268
where the structure constants are
:formula_269

As an example, the quadratic Casimir operator is
:formula_270
where formula_271 is the inverse matrix of the Killing form formula_272 That the Casimir operator formula_273 belongs to the center formula_227 follows from the fact that the Killing form is invariant under the adjoint action.

The center of the universal enveloping algebra of a simple Lie algebra is given in detail by the Harish-Chandra isomorphism.

===Rank===
The number of algebraically independent Casimir operators of a finite-dimensional semisimple Lie algebra is equal to the rank of that algebra, i.e. is equal to the rank of the Cartan–Weyl basis. This may be seen as follows. For a -dimensional vector space , recall that the determinant is the completely antisymmetric tensor on formula_275. Given a matrix , one may write the characteristic polynomial of as
:formula_276

For a -dimensional Lie algebra, that is, an algebra whose adjoint representation is -dimensional, the linear operator
:formula_277
implies that formula_278 is a -dimensional endomorphism, and so one has the characteristic equation
:formula_279
for elements formula_280 The non-zero roots of this characteristic polynomial (that are roots for all ) form the root system of the algebra. In general, there are only such roots; this is the rank of the algebra. This implies that the highest value of for which the formula_281 is non-vanishing is 

The formula_281 are homogeneous polynomials of degree This can be seen in several ways: Given a constant formula_283, ad is linear, so that formula_284 By plugging and chugging in the above, one obtains that

:formula_285

By linearity, if one expands in the basis,
:formula_286
then the polynomial has the form
:formula_287
that is, a formula_288 is a tensor of rank formula_289. By linearity and the commutativity of addition, i.e. that formula_290, one concludes that this tensor must be completely symmetric. This tensor is exactly the Casimir invariant of order 

The center formula_291 corresponded to those elements formula_292 for which formula_293 for all by the above, these clearly corresponds to the roots of the characteristic equation. One concludes that the roots form a space of rank and that the Casimir invariants span this space. That is, the Casimir invariants generate the center formula_294

===Example: Rotation group SO(3)===
The rotation group SO(3) is of rank one, and thus has one Casimir operator. It is three-dimensional, and thus the Casimir operator must have order (3 − 1) = 2 i.e. be quadratic. Of course, this is the Lie algebra of formula_295 As an elementary exercise, one can compute this directly. Changing notation to formula_296 with formula_297 belonging to the adjoint rep, a general algebra element is formula_298 and direct computation gives

:formula_299

The quadratic term can be read off as formula_300, and so the squared angular momentum operator for the rotation group is that Casimir operator. That is,
:formula_301
and explicit computation shows that
:formula_302
after making use of the structure constants
:formula_303

===Example: Pseudo-differential operators===
A key observation during the construction of formula_65 above was that it was a differential algebra, by dint of the fact that any derivation on the Lie algebra can be lifted to formula_65. Thus, one is led to a ring of pseudo-differential operators, from which one can construct Casimir invariants.

If the Lie algebra formula_1 acts on a space of linear operators, such as in Fredholm theory, then one can construct Casimir invariants on the corresponding space of operators. The quadratic Casimir operator corresponds to an elliptic operator.

If the Lie algebra acts on a differentiable manifold, then each Casimir operator corresponds to a higher-order differential on the cotangent manifold, the second-order differential being the most common and most important.

If the action of the algebra is isometric, as would be the case for Riemannian or pseudo-Riemannian manifolds endowed with a metric and the symmetry groups SO(N) and SO (P, Q), respectively, one can then contract upper and lower indices (with the metric tensor) to obtain more interesting structures. For the quadratic Casimir invariant, this is the Laplacian. Quartic Casimir operators allow one to square the stress–energy tensor, giving rise to the Yang-Mills action. The Coleman–Mandula theorem restricts the form that these can take, when one considers ordinary Lie algebras. However, the Lie superalgebras are able to evade the premises of the Coleman–Mandula theorem, and can be used to mix together space and internal symmetries.

==Examples in particular cases==
If formula_307, then it has a basis of matricesformula_308which satisfy the following identities under the standard bracket:formula_309, formula_310, and formula_311this shows us that the universal enveloping algebra has the presentationformula_312as a non-commutative ring.

If formula_1 is &quot;abelian&quot; (that is, the bracket is always ), then formula_65 is commutative; and if a basis of the vector space formula_1 has been chosen, then formula_65 can be identified with the polynomial algebra over , with one variable per basis element.

If formula_1 is the Lie algebra corresponding to the Lie group , then formula_65 can be identified with the algebra of left-invariant differential operators (of all orders) on ; with formula_1 lying inside it as the left-invariant vector fields as first-order differential operators.

To relate the above two cases: if formula_1 is a vector space as abelian Lie algebra, the left-invariant differential operators are the constant coefficient operators, which are indeed a polynomial algebra in the partial derivatives of first order.

The center formula_291 consists of the left- and right- invariant differential operators; this, in the case of not commutative, is often not generated by first-order operators (see for example Casimir operator of a semi-simple Lie algebra).

Another characterization in Lie group theory is of formula_65 as the convolution algebra of distributions supported only at the identity element of .

The algebra of differential operators in variables with polynomial coefficients may be obtained starting with the Lie algebra of the Heisenberg group. See Weyl algebra for this; one must take a quotient, so that the central elements of the Lie algebra act as prescribed scalars.

The universal enveloping algebra of a finite-dimensional Lie algebra is a filtered quadratic algebra.

== Hopf algebras and quantum groups ==
The construction of the group algebra for a given group is in many ways analogous to constructing the universal enveloping algebra for a given Lie algebra. Both constructions are universal and translate representation theory into module theory. Furthermore, both group algebras and universal enveloping algebras carry natural comultiplications that turn them into Hopf algebras. This is made precise in the article on the tensor algebra: the tensor algebra has a Hopf algebra structure on it, and because the Lie bracket is consistent with (obeys the consistency conditions for) that Hopf structure, it is inherited by the universal enveloping algebra.

Given a Lie group , one can construct the vector space of continuous complex-valued functions on , and turn it into a C*-algebra. This algebra has a natural Hopf algebra structure: given two functions
formula_323, one defines multiplication as
:formula_324
and comultiplication as
:formula_325
the counit as
:formula_326
and the antipode as
:formula_327
Now, the Gelfand–Naimark theorem essentially states that every commutative Hopf algebra is isomorphic to the Hopf algebra of continuous functions on some compact topological group —the theory of compact topological groups and the theory of commutative Hopf algebras are the same. For Lie groups, this implies that is isomorphically dual to formula_65; more precisely, it is isomorphic to a subspace of the dual space formula_329

These ideas can then be extended to the non-commutative case. One starts by defining the quasi-triangular Hopf algebras, and then performing what is called a quantum deformation to obtain the quantum universal enveloping algebra, or quantum group, for short.

<text>Louisiana State University Shreveport (LSU Shreveport or LSUS) is a public university in Shreveport, Louisiana. It is part of the Louisiana State University System. Initially, a two-year college, LSUS has expanded into a university with 25 undergraduate degree programs, 13 master&#x27;s degree programs, and a Doctorate of Education in Leadership Studies. LSUS offers more than 50 extracurricular organizations and operates Red River Radio, a public radio network based in Shreveport, as well as the Spring Street Museum in downtown Shreveport, the Pioneer Heritage Center on campus, the Red River Watershed Management Institute, Institute for Nonprofit Administration and Research and the Center for Business and Economic Research. 

==History==
In September 1967, Louisiana State University Shreveport opened its doors as a two-year commuter college with an enrollment of 807 students under the direction of Dean Donald Shipp. The campaign to establish a branch of Louisiana State University (LSU) in Shreveport began in 1936 when the Caddo Parish Police Jury passed a resolution for the school with the support of Frank Fulco and several civic organizations including the Queensborough Civic Club. However, when Louisiana State Senator Roscoe Cranor presented the formal request to Governor Richard Leche in 1937, he rejected the proposal.

Another nineteen years would pass before State Representative Frank Fulco introduce a bill to the Louisiana House in 1956 to, yet again, establish a branch of LSU in Shreveport. It failed in committee, forcing Representative Fulco to introduce a resolution calling for a feasibility study by the State Department of Education to determine the need for a state college in Shreveport. This time, the resolution passes; the study took two years to complete. It revealed that not only was a public college needed in Shreveport but that the citizens of the area desired it, invigorating debate among various Louisiana state legislators, governors, universities, civic clubs, and, of course, private citizens over its necessity and fiscality. Fortunately, the debate concluded in 1964 with the introduction of House Bill 87. By 1965, the LSU Board of Supervisors formally had established LSUS as an integral division of Louisiana State University and appointed Donald Shipp as the first Dean of LSUS.

Shipp quickly establishes a base of operations at the old Line Avenue School with A.J. Howell as the business manager and Mrs. Fabia Thomas as the Registrar and hires the original core faculty. The Line Avenue School remained the center location for the students, faculty, and staff until the completed construction of the three-story Science Building and a two-story Library on the new campus grounds located off Hwy 1 in Southeast Shreveport in 1967.

Soon after classes began that September in 1967, a push for a four-year status for LSUS ensued by the Student Government Association and Circle K Club of LSUS along with other prominent members of Shreveport. Louisiana State Senator Don Williamson of Caddo Parish heard their calls and became the lead author of Senate Bill No. 16 for a four-year degree granting status for LSUS supported by State Senators Jackson B. Davis and C. Kay Carter and many State Representatives. William &quot;Bill&quot; Bronson, publisher of the Shreveport &quot;Times&quot; and Vice Chairman of the Coordinating Council for Higher Education, used his powers of persuasion and both &quot;The Times&quot; and &quot;The Monroe Morning World&quot; to endorse the four-year bill for LSUS.

However, surrounding colleges, fearing the loss of student enrollment to a state four-year degree-granting university, staunchly opposed LSUS becoming a four-year school. In fact, the opposition sought to kill the bill by securing the opinion of the Attorney General, stating approval of the proposal would require a two-thirds vote rather than a simple majority. Additionally, an amendment attached to the bill prohibited the construction of dormitories on the Shreveport campus. However, the supporters of the bill agreed to the change, and Governor Edwin Edwards signed the bill into law June 22, 1972, under Act No. 66. Shortly afterward, the Louisiana Council for Higher Education authorized four major academic divisions and 39 degree programs for LSUS. By the fall of 1973, Dean Shipp was promoted to Chancellor, and LSUS instituted its third academic year and its senior year in the fall of 1974.

On May 15, 1975, LSUS held its first commencement at the Municipal Auditorium in Shreveport conferring degrees on 223 students almost 40 years after the initial effort of Frank Fulco to establish a branch of LSU in Shreveport.

On May 5, 1978, the Academic Affairs Committee of the Board of Regents for the State of Louisiana unanimously adopted the motion for LSUS to offer graduate studies for the Master of Education in Secondary Education catapulting LSUS and the Shreveport area into the graduate consortium. Just a year later, the same committee approved the graduate studies for the Master of Business Administration at LSUS, and by 2016, LSUS would have an additional ten graduate programs.

The institution received approval from the Board of Regents for the State of Louisiana on May 22, 2013, to begin offering the Doctor of Education (Ed.D.). The following year, the Southern Association of Colleges and Schools Commission on Colleges (SACSCOC) approved the institution to be accredited as a Level V institution.
