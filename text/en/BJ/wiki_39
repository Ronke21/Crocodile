<text>The Untouchables is an American crime drama produced by Desilu Productions that ran from 1959 to 1963 on the ABC television network. Based on the memoir of the same name by Eliot Ness and Oscar Fraley, it fictionalizes the experiences of Ness as a Prohibition agent fighting crime in Chicago in the 1930s with the help of a special team of agents handpicked for their courage, moral character and incorruptibility, nicknamed the Untouchables. The book was later made into a celebrated film in 1987 and a second, less-successful TV series in 1993.

A dynamic, hard-hitting action drama and a landmark television crime series, &quot;The Untouchables&quot; won series star Robert Stack the Emmy Award for Best Actor in a Dramatic Series in 1960.

==Series overview==

The series originally focused on the efforts of a real-life squad of Prohibition agents employed by the United States Department of Justice and led by Eliot Ness (Stack) who helped bring down the bootleg empire of &quot;Scarface&quot; Al Capone, as described in Ness&#x27;s bestselling 1957 memoir. This squad was nicknamed &quot;The Untouchables&quot; because of its courage and honesty; squad members could not be bribed or intimidated by the mob. Eliot Ness, though, died suddenly in May 1957, shortly before his memoir and the subsequent TV adaptation were to bring him fame beyond any he experienced in his lifetime.

The pilot for the series, a two-part episode entitled &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, originally aired on CBS&#x27;s &quot;Westinghouse Desilu Playhouse&quot; on April 20 and 27, 1959. Later retitled &quot;The Scarface Mob&quot;, these episodes, which featured Neville Brand as Al Capone, were the only episodes in the series to be more-or-less directly based on Ness&#x27;s memoir, and ended with the conviction and imprisonment of Capone. CBS, which had broadcast most of Desilu&#x27;s television output since 1951 beginning with &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, was offered the new series following the success of the pilot film. Chairman William S. Paley rejected it on the advice of network vice president Hubbell Robinson. ABC, however, agreed to air the series, and &quot;The Untouchables&quot; premiered on October 15, 1959. In the pilot movie, the mobsters generally spoke with unrealistic pseudo-Italian accents, but this idiosyncratic pronunciation was dropped when the series debuted.

The weekly series first dramatized a power struggle to establish a new boss in the absence of Capone himself (for the purpose of the TV series, the new mob boss was Frank Nitti, although this was, as usual for the series, contrary to fact). As the series continued, a highly fictionalized portrayal of Ness and his crew developed as all-purpose, multiagency crime fighters who went up against an array of 1930s-era gangsters and villains, including Ma Barker, Dutch Schultz, Bugs Moran, Vincent &quot;Mad Dog&quot; Coll, Legs Diamond, Lucky Luciano, and in one episode, Nazi agents. On many occasions during the series&#x27; run, Ness would blatantly violate suspects&#x27; Fourth Amendment rights with no legal ramifications or consequences.

The terse narration by gossip columnist Walter Winchell, in his distinctive New York accent, was a stylistic hallmark of the series, along with its ominous theme music by Nelson Riddle and its shadowy black-and-white photography, which was influenced by film noir.

===Controversy===

The show drew harsh criticism from some Italian Americans, including Frank Sinatra, who felt it promoted negative stereotypes of them as mobsters and gangsters. The Capone family unsuccessfully sued CBS, Desilu Productions, and Westinghouse Electric Corporation for their depiction of the Capone family. In the first episode of the first season, the character of &quot;Agent (Rico) Rossi&quot;, a person of Italian extraction who had witnessed a gangland murder, was added to Ness&#x27;s team.

On March 9, 1961, Anthony Anastasio, chief of the Brooklyn waterfront and its International Longshoremen&#x27;s Association, marched in line with a picket group who identified themselves as &quot;The Federation of Italian-American Democratic Organizations&quot;. In protest formation outside the ABC New York headquarters, they had come together to urge the public boycott of Liggett &amp; Myers Tobacco Company (L&amp;M) products, including Chesterfield cigarettes, the lead sponsor of &quot;The Untouchables&quot;. They expressed displeasure with the program, which to them vilified Italian Americans, stereotyping them as the singular criminal element. The boycott and the attendant firestorm of publicity had the effect Anastasio and his confederates wanted. Four days after the picket of ABC, L&amp;M, denying it had bowed to intimidation, announced it would drop its sponsorship of &quot;The Untouchables&quot;, maintaining the decision was based on network scheduling conflicts. The following week, the head of Desilu, Desi Arnaz (who had attended high school with Capone&#x27;s son Albert), in concert with ABC and the &quot;Italian-American League to Combat Defamation&quot;, issued a formal three-point manifesto:

* No more fictional hoodlums with Italian names will be in future productions.
* More stress will be given to the law-enforcement role of &quot;Rico Rossi&quot;, Ness&#x27;s right-hand man on the show.
* An emphasis will be given to the &quot;formidable influence&quot; of Italian-American officials in reducing crime with an emphasis on the &quot;great contributions&quot; made to American culture by Americans of Italian descent.

The series also incurred the displeasure of the powerful director of the Federal Bureau of Investigation, J. Edgar Hoover, when the fictionalized scripts depicted Ness and his Treasury agents involved in operations that were actually the province of the FBI. (The Untouchables belonged to the Federal Agency that later became known as the ATF). The second episode of the series, for example, depicted Ness and his crew involved in the capture of the Ma Barker gang, an incident in which the real-life Ness played no part. The producers agreed to insert a spoken disclaimer on future broadcasts of the episode stating that the FBI had primary responsibility for the Barker case.

&quot;The Untouchables&quot; was an unusually violent TV program for the era and its frequent and surprisingly explicit depictions of drug abuse and prostitution were described by the National Association for Better Radio and Television as &quot;not fit for the television screen&quot;. Several episodes included depictions of violence toward children.

In an article titled &quot;The New Enemies of &quot;The Untouchables&quot;&quot; Ayn Rand argued that the persistent, superficial attacks received by &quot;The Untouchables&quot; were due to its appeal and its virtues: Its moral conflict and moral purpose.

===Episodes and cast===


The series had 118 episodes which ran 50 minutes each. Though the book chronicled the experiences of Ness and his cohorts against Capone, and in reality the Untouchables disbanded soon after Capone&#x27;s conviction, the series continued after the pilot and book ended, depicting the fictitious further exploits of the Untouchables against many, often real-life, criminals over a span from 1929 to 1935. The television episodes were broadcast in no chronological timeline, but were set mostly in the early 1930s (for example, one episode, &quot;You Can&#x27;t Pick the Number&quot;, begins with Winchell&#x27;s words, &quot;October 1932: the depth of the Depression&quot;), and another episode &quot;Canada Run&quot; begins at Chicago Stadium at the NFL Playoff Game on December 18, 1932. A few episodes were set primarily in a locale other than Chicago (such as the one dealing with the shootout involving Ma Barker and her gang.) Characters and &quot;facts&quot; in the majority of the episodes were more often than not entirely fictitious or loosely based composites of true-life criminals of that era. The gripping theme music was by Nelson Riddle.

Quinn Martin produced the show&#x27;s first season, which contained elements that could be found in future TV series produced by Martin.

The most prominent Untouchables were portrayed by:
* Robert Stack as Agent Eliot Ness
* Nicholas Georgiade as Agent Enrico &quot;Rico&quot; Rossi
* Paul Picerni as Agent Lee Hobson, (second season on)

The show also had several recurrent gangsters, many of them loosely based on real-life gangsters of the time:

* Joe Kulak, portrayed by Oscar Beregi

* Little Charlie Sebastino, portrayed by Henry Silva
* Louis Latito, portrayed by Joe De Santis
* Archie Devlin, Capone&#x27;s attorney, portrayed by George N. Neise

* &quot;Fur&quot; Sammons, portrayed by Richard Benedict, and appearing only in the pilot and premiere
* Tony &quot;Mops&quot; Volpe, portrayed by Herman Rudin, and appearing only in the pilot and premiere

Finally, heard in every episode, but never shown onscreen:

* Announcer: Les Lampson
* Narrator: Walter Winchell

Paul Picerni and Nicholas Georgiade were cast as gangsters in Capone and Nitti&#x27;s mob in the 1959 pilot before being cast in the series.

==Broadcast history==
&quot;The Untouchables&quot; originally aired as a segment of the anthology series &quot;Desilu Playhouse&quot; in 1959. It was picked up as a regular series by ABC for the 1959 season and was aired on Thursdays from 9:30 to 10:30pm from 1959 to 1962, switching to Tuesday evenings from 9:30 to 10:30pm for its final season (1962–63).

Desilu Productions president Desi Arnaz had originally offered the role of Ness to Van Johnson. Johnson&#x27;s wife and manager rejected the deal and demanded double the salary offer. Arnaz refused and signed Stack instead. Arnaz had had a long business relationship with CBS, which had aired many Desilu programs, including &quot;I Love Lucy&quot; and &quot;The Lucy–Desi Comedy Hour&quot;. When CBS refused to buy the program, Arnaz sold it to ABC.

Neville Brand reprised his role as Al Capone in the 1961 film &quot;The George Raft Story&quot;.

Some segments were released to theaters as movies: &quot;The Scarface Mob&quot; (from the two-part pilot), &quot;The Alcatraz Express&quot; (from &quot;The Big Train&quot;), and &quot;The Gun of Zangara&quot; (from &quot;Unhired Assassin&quot;).

On November 10, 1991, NBC ran the two-hour film &quot;The Return of Eliot Ness&quot;, with Robert Stack as Ness. It was set in 1947, after Capone&#x27;s death, and depicted Ness investigating the death of an Untouchables agent named Labine.

==Legacy==
&quot;The Untouchables&quot; was a landmark television series that has spawned numerous imitators over the decades, such as &quot;S.W.A.T.&quot;, &quot;The F.B.I.&quot;, &quot;Crime Story&quot;, the original &quot;Hawaii Five-O&quot; (Five-O&#x27;s creator and executive producer, Leonard Freeman, served as executive producer on &quot;The Untouchables″&quot; final season), Robert Stack&#x27;s two later series, &quot;Strike Force&quot; and &quot;Most Wanted&quot;, &quot;The Hat Squad&quot;, and the 1993 &quot;The Untouchables&quot; syndicated TV series.

It also inspired films such as &quot;Al Capone&quot; starring Rod Steiger, &quot;The Untouchables&quot; (with Kevin Costner), &quot;Gangster Squad&quot;, &quot;Mulholland Falls&quot;, and others.
&quot;The Untouchables&quot; is one of two series from 1959, the other being &quot;The Detectives&quot;, together credited with the concept of depicting a &quot;group&quot; of crime fighters. Previously, most TV crime dramas had followed one of two formats: either a duo composed of a stalwart police officer or detective and his trusty sidekick/partner (&quot;Dragnet&quot;, &quot;The Lineup&quot;), or a lone-wolf private eye or police detective (&quot;Peter Gunn&quot;, &quot;Richard Diamond&quot;, &quot;M-Squad&quot;).

=== Assessments of cultural impact ===
In their 1988 book, &quot;The Critics&#x27; Choice—The Best of Crime and Detective TV&quot;, authors Max Allan Collins and John Javna chose &quot;The Untouchables&quot; as one of the &quot;Top 10 Best Police TV Series (Police Procedurals) of All Time&quot;.

The Lebanon (Pa.) &quot;Daily News&quot; said of &quot;The Untouchables&quot;: &quot;Between the hard-nosed approach, sharp dialogue, and a commendably crisp pace (something rare in dramatic TV at the time), this series is one of the few that remains fresh and vibrant. Only the monochrome presentation betrays its age. &quot;The Untouchables&quot; is one of the few Golden Age TV shows that deserves being called a classic.&quot;

In 2019, a 60th Anniversary Retrospective titled &quot;The Untouchables Retrospective&quot; was undertaken to celebrate the show&#x27;s cultural impact and legacy in television and film history through mixed media, including extensive episode reviews, a podcast, and a making-of documentary. To date, the retrospective has interviewed several surviving participants involved with the program, including Pat Crowley and Nehemiah Persoff.

=== In popular culture ===
In Billy Wilder&#x27;s Academy Award-winning 1960 movie &quot;The Apartment&quot;, a corporate telephone operator being romanced by an executive objects to the rescheduling of a tryst as it will conflict with the broadcasting of &quot;The Untouchables.&quot;

Warner Bros. Cartoons spoofed the Untouchables series in the 1963 &quot;Merrie Melodies&quot; cartoon short &quot;The Unmentionables&quot;, with Bugs Bunny playing the role of Elegant Mess, a crime fighter assigned to infiltrate a black market ring operated by Rocky and Mugsy.

The series was also spoofed on an episode of the 1961-62 ABC-TV/Hanna-Barbera cartoon series &quot;Top Cat&quot; entitled &quot;The Unscratchables&quot;.

In a 1963 on another ABC-TV/Hanna-Barbera cartoon, &quot;The Jetsons&quot;, in an episode where Elroy Jetson runs away from home, a group of mobsters was conning both Elroy and his dog &quot;Astro&quot; they are producing a TV show called &quot;The Unspaceables&quot; to cover up a robbery they committed in front of Elroy and Astro.

NBC&#x27;s &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; spoofed &quot;The Untouchables&quot; several times during the 1970s, with Dan Aykroyd playing Eliot Ness. Incidentally, Aykroyd would parody another popular TV police procedural from the era, &quot;Dragnet&quot;, in 1987, which co-starred Tom Hanks.

On a 1981 telecast of NBC-TV&#x27;s &quot;The Tonight Show&quot;, &quot;The Untouchables&quot; was spoofed with a skit entitled: &quot;The Video Untouchables&quot;, with host Johnny Carson portraying Agent &quot;Eliot Nielsen&quot;, whose squad apprehended citizens who unlawfully videotaped TV programs. The video survives today on YouTube.

<text>Operation Badr ( ), also known as Plan Badr ( ), was an Egyptian military offensive and operation across the Suez Canal that destroyed the Bar-Lev Line, a chain of Israeli fortifications along the frontline of the Israeli-occupied Sinai Peninsula, on 6 October 1973. It was launched in conjunction with a Syrian military offensive against the Israeli-occupied Golan Heights, triggering the Yom Kippur War. During the War of Attrition, which preceded Operation Badr, both Egypt and Syria (previously constituents of the United Arab Republic) had been seeking to recover the territories that Israel had captured from them during the 1967 Arab–Israeli War.

The Egyptians had begun preparing for the offensive with training exercises in 1968, followed by operational planning from 1971 onward, including a deceptive operation. In the opening stages of the attack, known as &quot;the crossing&quot; ( ), Egyptian combat engineers utilized water cannons to rapidly clear numerous passages through the sand wall lining the eastern bank of the Suez Canal, simultaneously laying bridges and operating ferries that allowed armoured vehicles to cross into Israeli-controlled territory.

Israel&#x27;s military was surprised by the scale of the attack, and by 7 October, the Egyptians had completed their crossing; the Israelis&#x27; eastern bank was captured and occupied by five Egyptian infantry divisions, which subsequently established defensive positions on bridgeheads spanning the frontline. Following a lull in the fighting on 7 October, Israeli armour reserves arrived at the Suez Canal and launched a counterattack against the Egyptians opposite to the city of Ismailia. However, Egypt&#x27;s military was successful in employing anti-tank weapons to repel the Israeli assault and advanced once more. By the end of 8 October, Egypt had occupied a strip of territory along the entire eastern bank of the Suez Canal to a depth of approximately .

In addition to the crossing, Egypt had successfully implemented a naval blockade against Israel in the Red Sea and the Mediterranean Sea. Though Israel ultimately was able to halt the Egyptian advance and begin a counterattack in the southern Suez Canal, the sweeping success of Egyptian troops in the initial stages of the conflict, including Operation Badr, is specially commemorated by the 6th of October Panorama in Egypt&#x27;s Cairo and by the October War Panorama in Syria&#x27;s Damascus. In Cairo, the 6th of October Bridge is named for the date on which Operation Badr commenced.
==Prelude: 1967–1970==

=== Israeli occupation of the Sinai Peninsula ===
At the end of the Six-Day War, Israel held the entire Sinai peninsula, with the exception of Port Fouad. Israel&#x27;s victory in the Six-Day War brought about a sense of security within Israel; the occupied territory added strategic depth to the country&#x27;s defense. Consequently, Israel and Egypt ignored United Nations Security Council Resolution (UNSCR) 242, which called for withdrawal from occupied territories in return for Arab recognition, and negotiations between the countries ceased. Israeli Prime Minister Golda Meir aimed to maintain the status quo and believed that her country&#x27;s military strength would secure peace with Arab nations on their terms. Egypt, following the &quot;three nos&quot; policy, refused to recognize Israel or even negotiate with directly, preferring talks via third parties.

=== Soviet aid for Egypt&#x27;s military ===
The 1967 war had severely depleted Egypt&#x27;s military strength, as most of their air force and a large quantity of equipment was destroyed. Soviet assistance helped the Egyptian military to start the rebuilding of their armed forces shortly after the war, and by September 1968 Egyptian ground forces had sufficiently recovered to challenge the Israeli presence east of the Suez canal. The War of Attrition began with Egyptian artillery barrages and commando raids into the Sinai, which were countered by deep-striking Israeli airstrikes and heli-borne raids into Egypt. Egypt&#x27;s inability to challenge Israeli air superiority led to the deployment of Soviet-operated air-defense assets to protect parts of Egypt&#x27;s interior, deterring the Israelis from launching their deep penetration raids and allowing the Egyptians to rebuild their air defenses. The defensive upgrades incurred increasing Israeli air losses, leading to an August 1970 ceasefire that lasted until 1973. Nasser died in September 1970 and was succeeded by Anwar Sadat.

==Egyptian strategy==

=== Exploiting the Cold War &quot;détente&quot; ===
President Sadat believed that Egypt&#x27;s economic, political, social and military problems were a result of the Six-Day War. He believed the solution to these problems lay with erasing the humiliation of the 1967 defeat, which required regaining the Sinai. In 1971 Sadat began the coordinated political and military groundwork to achieve this. In February, he proposed a phased Israel withdrawal from the Sinai, which would involve a reopening of the Suez Canal, and Israeli fulfillment of the UNSCR 242, including resolving the Palestinian refugee problem. In return, Egypt would sign a peace treaty with Israel and re-establish relations with the United States. However, Israeli insistence on retention of territory necessary for its security ended diplomatic efforts.

Simultaneously, Sadat sought to improve Egypt&#x27;s military capabilities, and in March began the first of four trips to the Soviet Union to obtain arms and munitions to cover those expended in the War of Attrition. He publicly stated his desire to go to war and marked 1971 the &quot;year of decision&quot;. However, the Soviets failed to deliver the promised supplies, and Sadat ruled out an offensive that year. As 1971 drew to a close, Sadat&#x27;s threats were dismissed as hollow Arab rhetoric. Added to their already weak political position, Arab leaders reached a consensus in 1972 that a diplomatic solution to the conflict was hopeless. American mediation steadily declined, ceasing entirely by mid-1973.

By 1972, the United States and the Soviet Union were focused on détente. The Arabs were worried, as it meant their military situation in regards to Israel would remain at a disadvantage. Believing diplomatic avenues had reached a dead end, Sadat focused on taking decisive military action. A renewed conflict with Israel would disrupt Soviet-American détente, force superpower intervention and make the solution of the Arab-Israeli conflict a center-stage issue to Israel, the US and the USSR.

A number of Egyptian commanders wanted to carry out a general war to regain at least a significant part of the Sinai. This view was notably held by the Minister of War, General Mohammed Ahmed Sadek. However, in January 1972 Sadek acknowledged that Egypt&#x27;s Armed Forces were not ready for a land reclamation war before some five to ten years. Sadek cited studies in opposition of a limited offensive; Egyptian analyses estimated 17,000 casualties in a canal crossing, while Soviet estimates placed casualty figures at 35,000 troops. Sadek stressed the immense losses that would be sustained would overshadow any military and political gains from a limited offensive, which required following up by liberating all or most of the Sinai.

For political reasons, Sadat dismissed Sadek&#x27;s arguments. The government&#x27;s political position was perilous as the Egyptian public, angered by the &quot;No War, No Peace&quot; situation with Israel, demanded action. The economy, already suffering from the loss of the Suez Canal revenues and the Sinai oil fields, could not cope with the country being on a war footing for an extended period. War was a desperate option, and a limited offensive under the current circumstances was the only solution.

=== Assistance from the Arab League ===
At a session of the Arab League&#x27;s Joint Defence Council on 27–30 January 1973, Egypt presented a report stressing that an attack against Israel would have to be carried out simultaneously from Egypt, Syria and Jordan because of the Israeli air superiority. According to the report, Egypt and Syria&#x27;s air forces, if reinforced with 16 air squadrons from other Arab countries would achieve numerical superiority. However, the Israelis offset this by superior training, avionics, aircraft payload and weaponry. A simultaneous Arab attack could dilute the effectiveness of the Israeli Air Force (IAF), and would force Israeli ground forces to fight a two-front war.

==== Egyptian–Syrian offensive ====
During that month, Syrian President Hafez al-Assad indicated his intentions of going to war against Israel. Egypt and Syria agreed to coordinate military action via negotiations, and the respective Ministers of War formulated a common military strategy. Egypt enlisted the political support of several more Arab countries, some producers of oil. Sadat discussed the possibility of using oil as an economic weapon to pressure Western governments into adopting more pro-Arab policies. During the war, oil-producing Arab nations, primarily Libya and Saudi Arabia, initiated an oil embargo, and several sent token forces to the front lines.

Sadat bred caution into his commanders, even warning his later Minister of War, Ahmed Ismail Ali, &quot;not to lose the army as had happened in 1967.&quot; On 3 June 1971 he outlined his vision of a limited war:

I want us to plan [the offensive] within our capabilities, nothing more. Cross the canal and hold even ten centimeters of the Sinai. I&#x27;m exaggerating, of course, but that will help me greatly and alter completely the political situation internationally and within Arab ranks.

Sadat&#x27;s strategy was designed to achieve political success without needing a comprehensive military victory, and hence, and in view of the Egyptian military&#x27;s marked inferiority to the Israeli Defense Forces, this required only a limited war.

A limited operation was supported by Egyptian armed forces Chief of Staff Saad El Shazly. He argued that Israel has two fatal weaknesses. The first of which is inability to sustain high human casualties due to limited available manpower. The second is inability to sustain a prolonged war for it mobilizes around 18% of the Jewish population. A prolonged limited defensive war can best capitalize both weaknesses.

==Background==
===Planning and preparations===
Major General Mohammed Fawzi, who was Sadek&#x27;s predecessor as defense minister, regularly held command simulations. These exercises had unrealistic objectives and operational aims that were considerably outside the capabilities of the Egyptian military. When Lieutenant General Saad El Shazly became Chief of Staff on 16 May 1971, no offensive plans yet existed. Rather, there was a defensive plan code named Operation 200, and a more aggressive alternative named Operation Granite. Although Granite incorporated raids and assaults into the Sinai, it was essentially defensive. In his assessment of the military&#x27;s capabilities, he concluded the air force was the weakest arm. It was outmatched by its Israeli counterpart in various aspects, and Israeli pilots were also more experienced. A pivotal equipment advantage for the IAF was the F-4 Phantom II, a third generation fighter/bomber. By the outbreak of the war in October 1973, the IDF had 122 F-4Es and 6 RF-4Es (R denotes the reconnaissance variant) in service.

To compensate for the weaknesses of Egyptian air power, the Egyptians developed their air defenses. They fielded immobile SA-2 and SA-3 SAMs, the backbone of the air defenses, as well as mobile SA-6 SAMs and ZSU-23-4 SPAAGs (Self Propelled Anti-Air Gun), portable infantry SA-7s, in addition to thousands of conventional anti-air artillery. These air defenses would provide a protective &quot;umbrella&quot; over Egyptian ground forces. However, the SA-2 and SA-3 systems, being immobile, could only be moved over a nine-hour period at best, exposing the air defenses to degradation in case of a redeployment to keep up with advancing forces. On the other hand, the SA-6 systems were available in limited numbers insufficient to provide adequate protection to advancing armored forces.

Due to these restrictions, Shazly supported a limited war to retake only the east bank of the canal, as opposed to Sadek. However, Sadek authorized the planning of two offensive plans, starting in July 1971. The first was Operation 41, which involved an offensive along the entire Suez Canal with the objective of seizing the key passes of the Sinai. The plan was developed in cooperation with Soviet advisers. As it was, the objectives of the operation were outside the capabilities of the Egyptian military and Shazly saw it only as a means of inducing the Soviets to supply more arms and equipment. The plan would also encourage the Syrians to join in an attack against Israel. Operation 41 was completed by September 1971, and the following month, Sadat and Sadek flew to Moscow to conclude Egypt&#x27;s largest arms deal yet, receiving 100 MiG-21 fighters, 10 Tu-16 bombers, SA-6 anti-aircraft (AA) missiles and heavy artillery. Operation 41 was renamed Operation Granite Two.

The second plan—codenamed the &quot;High Minarets&quot;—called for a crossing at five separate areas along the length of the canal. The Egyptians would advance , then establish defensive positions. By restricting their advance, Egyptian ground forces would remain within range of their own SAM defences, which would provide a protective &quot;umbrella&quot;, negating the Israeli advantage in the air. In this way the High Minarets was planned in accordance with the capabilities of the Egyptian Army. The plan&#x27;s outline was completed by September 1971 in absolute secrecy.

As Sadek continued to refuse the concept of a limited war, tensions rose between him and Sadat. Following a heated meeting of senior commanders, the Minister of War was sacked. His replacement, Major General Ahmed Ismail, was in favor of a limited offensive. The High Minarets continued to be developed as the only viable offensive plan, with the spring of 1973 being a possible launch date. Based on intelligence estimates, the main Israeli counterattacks would take place 6–8 hours after the assault began by three armored divisions, while armored support for the crossing would not be available before at least 12 hours. To deal with this, Egyptian infantry would be supplied with large numbers of anti-tank guided missiles (ATGM) and rocket propelled grenades (RPG). The portable anti-tank weapons were principally the RPG-7 and the less numerous wire-guided AT-3 Sagger, as well as hundreds of recoilless rifles and conventional weapons. The manually guided Sagger missile had a long range and a powerful warhead but suffered from low velocity in flight, allowing the target (such as a tank) time to take evasive maneuver or return fire. Its minimum range of created a significant area of dead ground, which was to be covered by the RPG, along with the B-10 and B-11 recoilless rifles. In addition, there were RPG-43 anti-tank grenades. Assault infantry were equipped with night vision devices, infrared scopes, and welder&#x27;s goggles to counter a tactic often used by the Israelis; mounting xenon floodlights on tanks and vehicles to blind enemy infantry at night. To allow the infantry to carry an assortment of heavy weaponry—ATGMs, RPGs, flamethrowers, machine guns, and mines—before the bridges were laid, was achieved by two steps. Firstly, five different field kits were created that were lighter, accommodated larger water bottles and could carry 24 hours&#x27; food supply. Each field kit was specifically designed to meet the needs of the various assault teams. The other solution was to use four-wheel wooden carts to transport equipment, weaponry and ammunition. Over 2,200 such carts would be used in the crossing, providing the capacity to transport nearly 330 tons (150,000 lb) of matériel. Rope ladders with wooden steps would be deployed to lift ammunition and heavy equipment, such as the B-11 recoilless rifle, to the top of the sand wall.
The High Minarets called for assault infantry to establish bridgeheads deep and wide. The relatively short perimeter would increase fire density, and initially the attack would receive supporting fire from sand ramparts on the western bank. Once reinforcements and armor crossed, the bridgeheads would be deepened to . This had to be accomplished within 18 hours of the start of the operation. Airborne and seaborne forces would conduct attacks and ambushes to delay Israeli reserves heading for the Bar Lev line.

The spring of 1973 passed with no offensive being launched. On 21 August of that year, in complete secrecy, six senior Syrian commanders, using false names and passports, arrived from Latakia at Alexandria harbor in a Soviet passenger liner carrying holiday makers. Among the Syrian commanders were, principally, the Minister of Defense General Mustafa Tlass and the Chief of Staff General Yusuf Shakkour. For the next two days, they convened with their Egyptian counterparts at Egyptian Naval Headquarters in Ras El Tin Palace. By 23 August, two documents were ratified by Shazly and Shakkour concluding that the Egyptian and Syrian armed forces were ready for war. All that remained was to choose a date; either 7–11 September or 5–10 October. The date was to be chosen jointly by Presidents Sadat and Hafez al-Assad, and they were required to communicate their decision to their commanders fifteen days before the date of attack.

When 27 August, fifteen days before 7 September, passed without a reply from either Sadat or Assad, it was clear no offensive would take place in September. During 28 and 29 August, Sadat met with Assad in Damascus, where they agreed to start the war in October. They specified 6 October as D-Day, and informed Ahmed Ismail and Tlass on 22 September, who in turn relayed the decision to the Chiefs of Staff. At the request of Ahmed Ismail, Sadat produced a presidential directive for war. Therefore, it was only in September, less than a month before the attack, that the date 6 October was finally selected as D-Day. The coordinated offensive would begin at 14:00 (Cairo Local Time). 6 October was chosen for several reasons. The speed of the water current and the tide were optimal for a crossing operation, and for most of the night there was a full moon, facilitating bridge construction. The date coincided with Yom Kippur, the Jewish Day of Atonement. This was an important factor in choosing 6 October for an attack; observant Jews fast on that day, abstain from the use of fire or electricity (which meant transportation would be at a standstill), and much of the Israeli army would be demobilised. October also coincided with the month of Ramadan in the Muslim Calendar, which meant that Muslim soldiers would be fasting. It was in Ramadan that the Muslims won their first victory at the Battle of Badr in the year 624. Opting for something more inspirational than the High Minarets as a name, Operation Badr was chosen by Egyptian commanders as the codename for the assault.

===Combat engineering===
In any crossing of the Suez Canal by Egyptian forces, success was highly dependent on the performance of the Egyptian Corps of Engineers, which had several daunting tasks to accomplish. Israeli engineers had constructed a massive artificial sand barrier spanning of the canal&#x27;s east bank (except for the Great Bitter Lake, where the width of the canal made a crossing unlikely). To prevent erosion, the sand barrier was supported by concrete, which was one metre (3⅓ ft) above the water at high tide, and three metres (10 ft) above water at low tide. The canal was wide and approximately deep. Engineers had to clear seventy passages through this sand wall, each wide. This meant the removal of of sand for each passage. Initially, conventional methods were tested for breaching the sand wall. It was found that, to clear a single passage required 60 men, 1 bulldozer, of explosives and five to six hours, uninterrupted by enemy fire. Since the crossing sites would likely be congested and under enemy fire, these methods proved to be impractical and too costly.

The solution to this dilemma was simple but nonetheless ingenious. Late in 1971, an Egyptian officer suggested the use of small, light, gasoline fueled pumps that could be ferried across the canal in inflatable rafts to blast through the sand barrier by hydraulic mining. The suggestion proved worthwhile, and the Egyptian Military ordered some 300 British-made pumps. Tests showed that five of these pumps could remove 1,500 cubic metres of sand in three hours. In 1972 another 150 more powerful German-made pumps were purchased. A combination of three British-made and two German-made pumps made it possible to clear a passage in two hours.

Once the passages were cleared, engineers had to construct ten heavy bridges (using MTU bridgelayers, TMM bridgelayers and pontoon bridges), five light bridges, ten pontoon bridges and 35 ferries. The passages had to be opened in five to seven hours, immediately followed by the ferries, then the bridges two hours later, all the while under enemy fire. Of the heavy bridges, the Egyptians had only two Soviet-made PMP heavy folding bridges, which could be erected in a shorter time than most other bridges in their inventory, saving a few critical hours. These bridges were also much easier to repair. The speed with which the engineers cleared the passages and laid the bridges and ferries would affect the course of the entire operation. Engineers also had to man the boats that would cross the assault infantry initially. Finally, they had to breach the minefields around Israeli defenses for the assault infantry.

===Israeli defensive measures===

The Israelis had constructed a series of fortifications along the canal called the Bar Lev Line, which was considered impregnable. The main obstacle of these defences was a massive artificial sand wall erected by Israeli engineers, high with a 45–60 degree incline, along the entire Suez Canal. The rampart were reinforced by concrete that also prevented any attempt by amphibious vehicles to climb the sand wall. To blast through the sand barrier the Israelis estimated would take at least twenty-four, probably forty-eight hours. Behind this rampart were a series of 22 fortifications comprising 35 strongpoints. On average, the fortifications were apart. A strongpoint was several stories deep into the sand and provided protection from a 1000-pound (~½ ton) bomb. Strongpoints incorporated trenches, barbed wire, minefields 200 meters deep, numerous bunkers and troop shelters, and firing positions for tanks. Each strongpoint had an underground reservoir filled with crude oil. The oil could be pumped into the Suez Canal via a pipe system, and ignited to create temperatures reaching . A second defensive line, behind the main line, was concentrated at likely crossing areas, and designed to be occupied by armored forces, incorporating tank firing positions. A third defensive line, behind the sand rampart, had its defences concentrated on the main roads and principal routes of advance for an attacker. Behind the main line on the canal were concentration areas for armor and infantry, supply depots, numerous artillery positions and so forth.

The Israeli command developed a basic defensive plan codenamed Dovecote (Shovach Yonim), the details of which were known to the Egyptians. The plan divided the Bar Lev Line into three sectors: the northern sector defended Arish on the coast to El-Qantarah el-Sharqiyya, the central sector defended Ismailia to Abu-Ageila, and the southern sector defended the area from the Great Bitter Lake to the end of the Suez Canal, and prevented a thrust to the Mitla and Gedy Passes. The 252nd Armored Division, led by Major General Albert Mandler, was charged with the defense of the Bar Lev Line, and incorporated three armored brigades. Positioned behind the series of fortifications was a brigade of 110–120 tanks, led by Colonel Reshef, split into three battalions of 36–40 tanks each, with one battalion to a sector. In case of an Egyptian attack, the brigade was to move forward to occupy tank platforms and firing positions along the Bar Lev Line. A further behind the canal were two additional armored brigades led by Colonels Gabi Amir and Dan Shomron, each with around 120 tanks. One brigade was to reinforce the forward armored brigade, while the other brigade counterattacked against the main Egyptian assault.

The Sinai garrison numbered 18,000 men. The overall commander was Shmuel Gonen, who served as head of the Israeli Southern Command. Of the garrison stationed in the Sinai, one infantry brigade occupied the strongpoints on the canal on 6 October, while a further 8,000 could be deployed to the line within 30 minutes to two hours along with the armor.

===Deception and final days to war===
Positioning the Second and Third Armies with their bridging equipment along the canal in preparation for Operation Badr would put the Israelis on high alert. Without the element of surprise Egyptian forces would suffer high losses in the attack (estimates for casualties already ran in the thousands). The Directorate of Military Intelligence (abbreviated Aman), which formulated Israel&#x27;s intelligence estimate and was known for its competency, was tasked with detecting troop movements and activity along Egyptian and Syrian forces; military activity which would be particularly intensive in the last days preceding the assault.

The deception plan mounted by the Egyptians, which included their intelligence services, relied on producing a series of events and incidents, militarily and politically, internationally and nationally, aimed at convincing Israeli intelligence analysts that the Arab world was not preparing for war. Among the plan&#x27;s requirements was that senior echelon commanders preserve superficial normality while working secretly on the final preparations for the offensive.

The core of the Egyptian deception plan was based on the prevalent Israeli mentality following their lightning-quick victory over Arab forces in the 1967 Six-Day War. This mentality is clearly illustrated in the following Israeli saying:

In his thesis of the Yom Kippur War, USMC Major Michael C. Jordan explains that this quote and the prevailing opinion it represented pre-October 1973:

... also reflects the contempt Israelis held for the military abilities of Arab neighbors Egypt and Syria. The 1967 preemptive victory was so complete and won so cheaply, Israelis viewed their military forces as invincible, their intelligence service as unmatched, and their Arab foes as inferior and incapable.

The Israelis expected a forty-eight-hour warning beforehand from their intelligence services. At any rate, they were confident that any Arab attack would be swiftly decimated by the IAF.

The Egyptians sought to exploit this Israeli belief to their advantage. Ever since assuming office, Sadat had continually threatened Israel with war, engaging in brinkmanship, until his threats became ignored by Israel and the world. In order to position their forces for the attack against Israel, the Egyptians announced an exercise by the canal. Exercises had been conducted numerous times before, and in May and August 1973 false alarms had caused the Israeli army to mobilise in response to these exercises, costing Israel some $10 million on each occasion. This time, when the Egyptians began exercises on 1 October to last until 7 October, Aman disregarded the heightened military activity as training maneuvers. Troop movements on the Syrian front were detected as well, but Aman concluded that the Syrians would not go to war without the Egyptians.

The pretext of exercises allowed the Egyptians to conceal their preparations. These were further facilitated by the fact that the Egyptian Second and Third Field Armies were normally stationed along the Suez Canal for defence. Troops, armor, and crucially, the bridging equipment, were moved to their concentration areas over a period of fifteen nights up to the night of 5/6 October, with a peak of activity during the final five nights.

Ever since it occupied the Sinai in 1967, Israel had openly declared it would remain in Sharm el-Sheikh to ensure the sea lanes to the port of Eilat through the Straits of Tiran remained opened (the closing of the Straits to Israeli shipping in 1967 was one of the causes of the Six-Day War). Egypt aimed to nullify Sharm el-Sheikh&#x27;s importance to Israel by imposing a naval blockade at the straits of Bab-el-Mandeb, almost from Israel. To this end, arrangements were made with Pakistan to receive Egyptian vessels for repair early in 1973. Approval was sought, and obtained, from Sudan and Yemen to receive the submarines on their way to Pakistan in Port Sudan and Aden as a friendly visit. Pakistan&#x27;s approval to receive Egyptian vessels for repairs were made public. On 1 October, a force containing several submarines, destroyers and missile boats set sail on a route planned to ensure their arrival at Bab-el-Mandeb on 6 October. The fleet was fully equipped for combat, and the force was ordered to maintain complete radio silence; which meant there was no way of recalling the submarines. The commanding officers, unaware of their real mission, were issued sealed envelopes detailing their orders and mission, and were instructed to open the envelopes on 6 October, only a few hours before the war was to begin, whereupon they would break their radio silence. Once the fleet had set sail that day, 1 October, &quot;the war had effectively begun&quot;.

The military sought to maintain an impression of normality. Just before Ramadan was to begin on 26 September, the Ministry of War publicly announced that military personnel could register to take leave to perform a Umrah (pilgrimage) in Mecca. Egyptian newspapers announced that sailboat races would be held, participants of which included several high-ranking officers of the Egyptian Navy. In addition, a visit planned for 8 October (two days after the scheduled attack) by the Romanian Minister of Defense to Egypt was also publicized by the Ministry of War, and a program for his visit was announced. This coincidental visit would be promptly canceled once war broke out on 6 October, but it proved useful as part of the deception plan.

On 27 September, a large batch of reservists were given orders for mobilization. To lull suspicion, the Cabinet Ministers of the Egyptian Government were invited to an open tour of General Headquarters, where all planning and coordination of the operation took place. Another batch of reservists were called up on 30 September. To quell suspicion once more, the Egyptians publicly announced on 4 October the demobilization of the reservists who had been called up on 27 September, but only demobilized 20,000 men.

From 1 October onwards, the order for war began to spread outside the circle of senior commanders in Egypt. Generals Saad Mamoun and Abdel Munim Wasel, commanders of the Second and Third Field Armies respectively, were informed of the decision to implement Operation Badr. On 3 October, they informed their divisional commanders. Brigade commanders were told on 4 October, battalion and company commanders on 5 October, while platoon commanders and troops were told on 6 October, six hours before the start of the attack.

Sadat also played his role the deception plan; in September he had attended the Non-Aligned conference in Algeria, and upon his return was rumored to be ill. Sadat remained, for several days leading up to 6 October, out of public sight. Egyptian intelligence planted false stories of his illness in the press and initiated a search for a home in Europe, where Sadat would receive treatment, adding to the rumor&#x27;s credibility.

Implementing the deception operation did not go through entirely without incident. Initially the Soviets were kept in the dark about Egyptian intentions to go to war. Instead, on 2 October, they were told that an Israeli raid was expected. Over the next two days the director of the Defense Intelligence Service, General Fouad Nassar, informed the Chief Soviet Liaison Officer, General Samakhodsky, that the raid was expected to be a large-scale attack, coupled with an air strike. Though Samakhodsky appeared at first to believe Nassar&#x27;s story, it became clear to the Egyptians that the Soviets were suspicious. In particular Soviet advisors serving with Egyptian and Syrian units were by 3 October reporting the unusually heightened activities of the Egyptian and Syrian forces. Both Sadat and Assad decided to inform the Soviets of their intention to go to war on 3 October. Promptly, the Soviets requested permission to evacuate their personnel in Egypt, and both leaders reluctantly agreed. Egyptian commanders were taken completely by surprise, when, beginning late evening on 4 October, Soviet experts serving with field units, embassy personnel and their families were hurriedly evacuated. By 5 October, the evacuation was complete. This incident would be an important factor in convincing the Israelis that war was likely.

4 October also provided another worrying incident to Egyptian commanders, who became aware that evening that EgyptAir, the country&#x27;s national airline, had canceled all its flights and was arranging the protection of its civil air fleet by dispersing its aircraft to refuges outside Egypt. The orders came from the Minister of Aviation, Ahmed Nuh. General Headquarters quickly intervened to reverse the dispersal orders, and by 5 October flights were back to their normal schedule. It was believed the incident was a breach of security and a leak on Egyptian plans for war. It was not clear to Egyptian commanders however, whether the Israelis were aware of the incident.

On 13 September 1973, an air battle took place between Syrian and Israeli fighters. It was an alarming skirmish in which twelve Syrian aircraft were shot down while the Israelis lost only one fighter. Tension ran high between both countries. The Egyptians in particular were very concerned; on 7 April 1967, an air battle between Syria and Israel had escalated the military situation and was one of the causes of the Six-Day War. Aware that war was to be launched only days later, the Syrians chose not to retaliate. The air battle aided the Syrians in concentrating their forces for the war, as the Israelis interpreted it to be a defensive reaction on the part of the Syrians. The Israelis closely monitored this buildup near the front, but their intelligence remained adamant that Syria would not go to war without Egypt, which the Israelis believed was currently occupied with internal issues.

Throughout September 1973, Aman had received eleven warnings, including a warning from Jordan&#x27;s King Hussein, that Egypt and Syria were bent on waging war, but they were all disregarded, as Aman maintained the belief that the Arabs would not launch an attack. Mossad director Zvi Zamir remained of the opinion that war was not an Arab option.

However, there remained too many signs for the Israelis to ignore, chief among which was the hasty Soviet evacuation from Cairo and Damascus, and the constant buildup of forces on the Syrian front when Egypt, it was assumed, would not enter war. Though the Chief of Staff, David Elazar, was assured that the probability of war remained low, he took precautionary steps on 5 October. Elazar placed the entire military on alert, canceled all leaves, and ordered the Air Force to assume a full-alert posture. He also ordered the 7th Armored Brigade to relocate from the Sinai to the Golan Heights. This raised Israeli numbers in the Golan Heights to 177 tanks and 44 artillery pieces on 6 October. To replace the 7th Armored Brigade, the Armor School, under the command of Colonel Gabi Amir, was ordered to activate its tank brigade for immediate airlift; it was in the Sinai by 6 October, before the war began. Ultimately though, no orders for mobilization were issued to reservists; Elazar and other senior commanders still expected a 24- to 48-hour warning from the intelligence services if the Arab nations were bent on war.

During the night of 5/6 October, Zvi Zamir went to Europe to meet personally with Ashraf Marwan, an Egyptian double agent working for Mossad. Marwan informed Zamir that a joint Egyptian-Syrian attack was imminent. Combined with other warnings and incidents, Marwan&#x27;s warning finally convinced Zvi Zamir of the imminence of war. Eli Zeira, the director of Aman, sent a definite warning of war to the Israeli leadership at 04:30 on 6 October. Aman erred when it concluded the Arabs were to attack at 18:00, an estimation in fact four hours late. Israel&#x27;s Prime Minister Golda Meir met with Defence Minister Moshe Dayan and General David Elazar at 08:05 for over an hour. Meir asked both men to present their views, which were conflicting: Dayan continued to believe war was not a certainty, while Elazar believed otherwise, arguing for a preemptive air strike against Syria. Dayan also proposed a partial mobilization of reserves, while Elazar favored a mobilization of the entire Air Force, and four armored divisions, totaling around 100,000–120,000 troops. Meir concluded the meeting by stating that no preemptive strike would be launched, in order to ensure the backing of the United States, but she sided with Elazar on the issue of mobilization, and orders were issued to reservists to mobilize.

Aman delivered its warning to Israeli commanders just nine and a half hours before the outbreak of hostilities, falling considerably short of the expected 24–48 hours warning period. The Arabs had won the intelligence war, achieving full surprise and gaining the initiative on the battlefield.

==Course of the operation==
===6 October===

&quot;Badr&quot; began at 14:00 on 6 October 1973. As the Israelis expected the attack to begin four hours later, only part of the troops and none of the armor assigned to man the Bar Lev Line were in position, except for a few platoons in the northernmost forts. Sixteen fortifications on the line were fully manned, and another two were partially manned.

The operation began with a major air strike involving more than 200 aircraft against three airbases, Hawk SAM batteries, three command centers, artillery positions and several radar stations, employing MiG-21s, MiG-17s, and Su-7s. This was in concert with artillery strikes starting at 14:05 from nearly 2,000 pieces against the Bar-Lev line, and against armor concentration areas and artillery positions, using field guns, howitzers, mortars, tank guns, B-10 and B-11 recoilless rifles. The self-propelled 152 mm howitzers and 130 mm field guns were assigned counter-battery fire missions against Israeli artillery. The 53-minute-long fire preparation, one of the largest in history, was divided into four barrages. The first, fifteen minutes long, was aimed at enemy targets on the eastern bank up to a depth of 1.5 kilometers. An estimated 10,500 shells were fired against Israeli targets in the first minute alone.

With the start of the fire preparation, tank hunting detachments—groups of ten equipped with RPG-7 rockets, RPG-43 grenades, and AT-3 Sagger missiles—crossed the canal to deploy one kilometer deep, quickly occupying the tank ramparts, and proceeded to set up ambushes and lay mines. When the first barrage ended, Egyptian artillery began a second, 22 minute-long barrage, against targets at a depth of 1.5–3 kilometers. At this time, 14:20, the first wave of assault infantry, 4,000 men, began crossing the canal. Around 2,500 dinghies and wooden boats were used to transport the troops. Smoke canisters were used at the crossing points to provide cover. During the night of 5 October, engineers had blocked the underwater pipes on the opposite bank, preventing the Israelis from releasing flammable oil into the canal and igniting it. The first wave was lightly equipped, armed with RPG-7s, Strela 2 AA missiles and rope ladders to deploy on the sand wall. Among the first wave were combat engineers and several units of Sa&#x27;iqa (&quot;lightning&quot;; these were commando forces), who were tasked with setting up ambushes on reinforcement routes. The Sa&#x27;iqa attacked command posts and artillery batteries in order to deny the Israelis control over their forces, while the engineers breached the minefields and barbed wire surrounding Israeli defenses. Immediately following them, military engineers transported the water pumps to the opposite bank and began setting them up. At this time Egyptian aircraft involved in the air strike began returning. Five aircraft were lost, although by the end of the day this rose to ten. The air strike put the Bir Gifgafa and Bir Thamada air bases out of operation for 48 hours, and damaged the Ras Nasrani and Bir Hasanah airbases. Around ten HAWK batteries, at least two 175mm artillery batteries, an electronic jamming center at Umm Khashib, and various radar stations were destroyed. This allowed the Egyptian Air Force to operate for the rest of the war without any ground-based communications interference, as the only other jamming center in the Sinai was located at el-Arish, considerably behind the front. Over a dozen AS-5 Kelt missiles were fired from Tu-16 bombers as well. Several were shot down, but at least five hit their targets, including two missiles fitted with anti-radiation seekers that knocked out Israeli radars. The success of the air strike caused the Egyptians to cancel a planned second air strike. Another account however states that 18 Egyptian aircraft were lost, and these losses prompted the canceling of a second wave of airstrikes.

At the Great Bitter Lake, the Egyptian 130th Amphibious Brigade performed its own crossing. Composed of the 602nd and 603rd Mechanized Infantry Battalions with 1,000 men, including a Sagger anti-tank battalion, an anti-air battalion, 20 PT-76 tanks and 100 amphibious armored personnel carriers, it was tasked with seeking and destroying enemy installations at the entrances of the Gedy and Mitla Passes. The sand rampart that lined the entire Suez Canal did not exist in the Bitter Lakes, and there were no Israeli defences or units to be encountered, and the brigade reached the opposite bank around 14:40 without any losses. The Egyptians discovered a minefield blocking their advance, and military engineers worked to clear a path.

Subsequently, at around 16:00, the 603rd was regrouping outside the minefield when it was attacked by a company of tanks from Kibrit East (codenamed Putzer by the Israelis), a fortification of the Bar Lev located on the Bitter Lake. The battalion had been reinforced with a tank hunting detachment from the 7th Division, and managed to destroy two tanks and three armored vehicles before the Israelis withdrew. Afterwards, its original assignment was canceled and it was ordered to capture the Kibrit East position (Fort Putzer). It occupied the abandoned position on 9 October which the battalion—despite being cut off and coming under numerous attacks—held for the remainder of the war. As for the 602nd battalion, it began to move eastwards some time after dusk, and stumbled upon an Israeli battalion of 35 tanks along Artillery Road, some from the Bitter Lake. The battalion&#x27;s ten PT-76s with 76 mm guns were outmatched and outnumbered by the heavier Israeli M48 Pattons with 105 mm guns. The manually guided Saggers were difficult to operate at night, and Israeli tanks were employing blinding xenon floodlights. Caught in the open Sinai desert, the 602nd was defeated and lost many of its tanks and armored vehicles, along with significant casualties. The remaining troops retreated to Third Army lines. Some units may have reached their objectives, although this is disputed.

Egyptian troops raised their national flag on the eastern bank of the canal at 14:35. By that time company and battalion-size units of Israeli tanks and infantry began reaching the Bar Lev Line, but were prevented from reaching their positions by Egyptian ambushes. Those tanks that broke through came under fire from the west bank ramparts. At 14:45, a second wave of infantry landed on the opposite bank. Subsequent waves of infantry arrived at fifteen-minute intervals. However, after the fourth wave, fatigue and technical problems with the boats gradually widened the time intervals. The Egyptians abandoned their schedules, giving priority to anti-tank teams and weaponry that could critically affect the battle. Amphibious vehicles were also used to cross equipment. The wooden carts were ferried to the east bank via boats, where they were initially lifted to the top of the sand wall with their loads. However, this method proved clumsy, and the carts were first emptied then lifted, after which they were re-loaded and dragged to troops on the front line. The carts greatly facilitated the supply and transportation of matériel on the east bank.

Meanwhile, Israeli Southern Command attempted to pinpoint the main Egyptian effort to launch a counterattack with Dan Shomron&#x27;s reserve armored brigade, when, in fact, there was no main effort. As a result, Southern Command wasted several critical hours without taking decisive action. Tactical errors also showcased themselves when Reshef moved his tank brigade forward; Israeli commanders neglected to conduct reconnaissance beforehand, causing their units to fall into Egyptian ambushes. In the confusion ensuing the surprise assault, no attempt was made at evacuating the Bar Lev garrison.

At 15:30, Egyptian forces captured Fort Lahtzanit, the first fortification of the Bar Lev Line to fall, and by then the infantry had been reinforced with 82mm B-10 and 107mm B-11 rifles. At the same time, engineers began operating their water pumps against the sand wall, opening the first passage in less than an hour, and the Egyptians moved up their bridging units to the canal. By 16:30 eight waves had brought across the canal ten infantry brigades in all five bridgeheads, totaling 23,500 men (around 4,700 at each bridgehead). Each bridgehead was on average six kilometers (3¾ mi) wide and around two kilometers deep. The Egyptians had high-velocity 85mm and 100mm rifled anti-tank guns in action on the east bank by that time.

At 17:30, three hours into the war, the twelfth and final infantry wave crossed, bringing the total in all five bridgeheads to 32,000 men (around 6,400 in each bridgehead). By then Israeli armored losses had reached around 100 tanks. The magnitude of Israeli losses stemmed from their insistence to reach their comrades in the Bar Lev Line, and they repeatedly ran into aggressive ambushes by Egyptian soldiers.

Taking advantage of dusk, at 17:50 four Sa&#x27;iqa battalions were airdropped deep into the Sinai by helicopters flying at low altitude. The Sa&#x27;iqa were assigned the objective of hampering reserves en route from Israel. The helicopters left the range of friendly SAMs and were not assigned air cover, resulting in a number of them being shot down.

At 18:00 Egyptian armor and anti-tank units on the west bank began moving to the crossing sites. Fifteen minutes later engineers completed the assembly of all 35 ferries and waited for the breaches to be opened. By 18:30 the bridgeheads were nearly five kilometers (3 mi) deep. With Israeli artillery on the Bar Lev Line eliminated, the immobile SA-2 and SA-3 units were moved forward. From 22:30 to 01:30 after midnight, all bridges—eight heavy and four light—were laid, and along with the ferries, began transporting reinforcements to the opposite bank. In the far south of the canal, at 19th Division&#x27;s sector, the sand turned into mud making it difficult to clear. Consequently, four ferries and three bridges assigned to that division were deployed seven hours behind schedule. Periodically the bridges were relocated to confuse Israeli air strikes targeting them—the Egyptians had opened 60 passages but were operating only 12 bridges, allowing each bridge to be moved to one of five passages. Throughout the night and up to the following morning, tanks and vehicles kept crossing the canal. Military police were responsible for directing this enormous traffic, utilizing color-coded signs.

====Port Said sector====
The Port Said Sector was an independent military command in the Egyptian military, unattached to the Second Army. It incorporated Port Said, Port Fouad and their vicinity. The sector contained two infantry brigades. Military operations in this area were directed against three fortifications: Budapest, Orkal and Lahtzanit. As with the rest of the front, the offensive here began with a fire preparation. However, high trajectory weapons were not employed because Egyptian aircraft were flying through the sector&#x27;s airspace, hence only direct fire guns were used to bombard Israeli positions.

Fort Lahtzanit, south of Port Fouad, was isolated by Egyptian infantry prior to the attack, preventing Israeli reinforcements from reaching it. At 15:00, the Egyptians breached the minefield and barbed wire surrounding the fort, at which point approximately a company-sized force of Egyptian troops assaulted the defenses. By 15:30, the fort was declared under Egyptian control. The Egyptians proceeded to clear a few bunkers still occupied by Israeli soldiers, some of whom surrendered when they began facing flamethrowers. By 18:00, the Egyptians had cleared the fort completely (see Battle of Fort Lahtzanit).

Fort Orkal, south of Port Fouad, was also isolated prior to an attack. The Egyptians approached by land from Port Fouad, and across the Suez Canal. The attack quickly ground to a halt as the force approaching from the north failed to breach the minefield, leaving the force attacking across the canal pinned down at the sand wall by enemy fire. Subsequently, an infantry company crossed and renewed the attack from the south, seizing several positions. Reinforcements soon allowed more positions to be captured. On 7 October, the remaining defenders made a break-out attempt to join friendly forces, but they were intercepted and either killed or captured.
Located on a narrow strip of land southeast of Port Fouad, Fort Budapest was surrounded by water on two sides. The fort came under air and artillery strikes at 14:00. A Sa&#x27;iqa company cut off the only route to the fort for reinforcements, while a battalion attacked from Port Fouad, advancing along a narrow strip of land bereft of natural cover. The battalion&#x27;s attack bogged down at the minefield, which was deep. It soon came under air attacks, as the fort was outside of the SAM &quot;umbrella&quot;, and faced stiff resistance from the fort&#x27;s garrison. The battalion eventually broke off its attack and retreated, while the Sa&#x27;iqa unit east of the fort prevented reinforcements from reaching the fort for four days before it too withdrew. Another attack on 15 October came close to succeeding but ultimately failed, and hence Fort Budapest became the only position of the Bar Lev Line to remain in Israeli hands (see Battles of Fort Budapest).

====Naval engagements====
By 6 October the Egyptian naval task force was at Bab-el-Mandeb where they broke radio silence. When Operation Badr began at 14:00, Rear Admiral Fuad Abu Zikry authorized the fleet to proceed with the blockade via a codeword. Egyptian submarines and destroyers intercepted ships traveling through Bab-el-Mandeb destined for Eilat, and all Israeli maritime navigation in the Red Sea ceased. The blockade was a strategic success for Egypt, while the Israeli Navy and Air Force were incapable of lifting the blockade due to the long distance between Israel and Bab-el-Mandeb. Mines were laid at the entrance to the Gulf of Suez to prevent Israel from transporting oil from the Sinai fields to Eilat. Historian Gammal Hammad claims that a blockade was also enforced in the Mediterranean, while other sources dispute this. News of the blockade was censored in Israel.

Aside from the blockade, the Egyptian Navy carried out several other missions. Coastal artillery at Port Said participated in the fire preparation by bombarding Fort Budapest and Fort Orkal, while coastal artillery at Suez hit targets opposite the Third Army. Missile boats bombarded Rumana and Ras Beyron on the Mediterranean, Ras Masala and Ras Sidr on the Gulf of Suez, and Sharm el Sheikh. Naval frogmen raided the oil installations at Bala&#x27;eem, disabling the massive driller.

Several naval engagements took place between Egyptian and Israeli missile boats off the coast between Port Said and Damietta, including one on 8 October, when a flotilla of ten Israeli missile boats attempted to shell coastal targets along the Nile delta. Four Egyptian Osa class missile boats confronted six of them, leading to the Battle of Baltim in which three of the Egyptian missile boats were sunk within forty minutes, with no Israeli casualties. Egypt claimed to have sunk four Israeli &quot;targets&quot;, three they believed to be motor torpedo boats and one missile boat.

According to Chaim Herzog, Israel responded with a naval blockade of Egypt which damaged the Egyptian economy. However, the sea routes to Egypt&#x27;s principal ports—Alexandria on the Mediterranean and Port Safaga on the Red Sea—remained secure and open to shipping for the duration of the war.

===7 October===

In the early hours of Sunday 7 October, just after midnight, Egyptian infantry, now with tank support, advanced to expand their bridgeheads. Israeli armored formations had experienced heavy losses in trying repeatedly to reach the Bar Lev Line and were disorganized and confused. Many Israeli units, however, stubbornly resisted the Egyptian advance. Twice during the night of 6 to 7 October, groups of tanks and infantry penetrated the bridgeheads to reach the canal line, where they managed to damage two bridges and destroy a number of ferries. Surrounded on all sides, however, these units were soon destroyed. Before sunrise the bridgeheads had reached a depth of , and the attacking Israeli units retreated. With sufficient numbers of armor finally on the east bank, reinforcements of infantry began to cross. Dawn on 7 October saw a total of 50,000 men (around 10,000 to each bridgehead) and 400 Egyptian tanks occupying five bridgeheads in the Sinai across the Suez Canal. Egyptian forces reorganised and entrenched themselves in anticipation of Israeli counterattacks.

David Elazar continued to instruct Gonen to evacuate soldiers from strongpoints which were not yet surrounded, even though by 7 October most Israeli defences were encircled. Egyptian losses up to the morning of 7 October were only 280 killed and 20 tanks destroyed. Israeli losses were far heavier; the brigade in the Bar Lev Line was completely surrounded and most of its men were casualties while 200 were captured. Armored losses were 200–300 tanks destroyed. One source puts the losses at roughly 200 by morning, but several battalion-sized attacks to regain the forts around El-Qantarah, and to reach some of the central and southern forts incurred further casualties with over 50 tanks being destroyed. In subsequent days some of the defenders in the Bar Lev Line managed to break through Egyptian forces and return to their lines, or were extracted by Israeli forces in counterattacks that came later on.

As the magnitude of Israeli losses became clear, Gonen made the decision at noon to form a defensive line on the Lateral Road, east of the canal, and ordered his divisional commanders to deploy accordingly. At noon, elements of Abraham Adan&#x27;s 162nd Division and Ariel Sharon&#x27;s 143rd Division began to reach the fronts. Consequently, Gonen divided the front into three divisional commands: Adan was deployed in the northern sector, Sharon in the central sector, and Mandler in the southern sector.

Air strikes continued throughout the day, and Southern Command received optimistic reports during the afternoon from the IAF, which claimed seven bridges knocked out of action, with the remaining ones to be destroyed by evening. In fact, several of the bridges that had been destroyed were decoys. The real bridges meanwhile, had their damaged sections quickly repaired and returned to service. Ten heavy bridges had been laid during the crossing (two bridges in the south were laid but not operational). Now, on 7 October, five of these bridges were removed and placed with the two already in reserve, leaving each division with one heavy bridge and one light bridge.

Egyptian forces widened their bridgeheads that day to narrow the gaps between them. Meanwhile, General Headquarters worked on organizing its forces on the east bank. Egyptian troops had crossed with 24-hours&#x27; worth of supplies. By Sunday it became necessary to resupply these forces, but administrative and supply units were in disarray, and to the south problems with laying the bridges further handicapped supply efforts there. 7 October offered a relative lull from the intense fighting that had taken place, allowing the Egyptians to organize battlefield administration. At 19th Division&#x27;s bridgehead to the south, all efforts to lay three bridges there were abandoned due to difficulties with the terrain. Instead, supplies and reinforcement destined for the division were transferred over 7th Division&#x27;s bridges to the north, where engineers were more successful in laying the bridges.

Fighting throughout the front did not cease entirely for the rest of the day, most of it taking part around the besieged Israeli defences and strongpoints that still resisted. Meanwhile, the Sa&#x27;iqa units airdropped into Sinai the previous day began engaging Israeli reserves heading for the front. The main areas of operation were the central mountain passes, the northern coastal routes, and near the Gulf of Suez. One battalion, transported in 18 helicopters, captured the Ras Sidr Pass south of Port Tawfiq, near the Gulf of Suez. En route four helicopters were shot down, but the survivors, including 9 crewmen, managed to regroup with the rest of the battalion. It held its position for the remainder of the war under extremely difficult conditions, preventing Israeli reserves from using the pass to reach the front. Two companies attempted to establish themselves in central Sinai, between Tasa and Bir Gifgafa. Israeli air interdiction resulted in six helicopter making a forced landing after being hit, while two helicopters turned and withdrew. The forced landings incurred many casualties, particularly due to burns, and the survivors trekked their way back to friendly lines. Only four helicopters reached the designated landing zone, and they could not be flown once more, indicating the suicidal nature of these operations. Albeit a third of their original force, the Sa&#x27;iqa managed to block Israeli reserves for over eight hours. Both companies were almost completely destroyed, suffering around 150 dead, including 15 officers. Israeli estimates claim to have downed between ten and twenty helicopters on the first day of the war.

In northern Sinai, a company established itself along the coastal road between Romani and Baluza on 6 October. The following day, it ambushed Colonel Natke Nir&#x27;s armored brigade, part of Adan&#x27;s division, destroying around 18 tanks along with other vehicles. The coastal road was blocked for over five hours. Airborne Israeli infantry was committed to support the armor, and in the ensuing battle, another 12 tanks and 6 half-tracks were destroyed. Some 30 soldiers of the brigade were killed, while the Sa&#x27;iqa company lost 75 dead. In addition to delaying Israeli reserves, commandos carried out sabotage operations.

The report cards for these operations are highly controversial. Some sources claim the commandos suffered immense casualties and were ineffectual. However, it is clear that these operations inflicted damage and caused confusion and anxiety among the Israelis, who diverted resources to counter these threats, while reservists were slowed down. One Israeli divisional commander also commended the Egyptian Sa&#x27;iqa.

El-Qantarah also saw heavy fighting as troops from the 18th Division engaged Israeli forces within and around the town. By early morning the division commander, Brigadier General Fuad &#x27;Aziz Ghali, was able to set up his command post there. Close quarter combat and even hand-to-hand fighting took place as the Egyptians cleared the ghost town building by building. Fighting was intense, and by the end of 7 October, the town and its outskirts as well as two nearby fortifications of the Bar Lev Line were under Egyptian control.

====Israeli conference at Umm Hashiba====
David Elazar, encouraged by reports of IAF successes, decided to visit Israeli Southern Command. He was accompanied by his aide, Colonel Avner Shalev and the former Israeli Chief of Staff, Yitzhak Rabin. Elazar arrived at Gonen&#x27;s advance command post at Gebel Umm Hashiba at 18:45; chief among those attending were Gonen, Adan and Mandler. Sharon only arrived after the meeting had been concluded.

At the conference, in light of the little information available on Egyptian dispositions and intentions, and due to a shortage of infantry and artillery, the commanders agreed they could not relieve the surrounded strongpoints on the canal in the near future. There was a general consensus to attack Egyptian forces throwing them off balance, but disagreed on how to do so. Southern Command expected to have 640 tanks on Monday 8 October, of which 530 tanks would be distributed among three divisions: 200 tanks under Adan, 180 under Sharon, and 150 under Mandler after part of his losses were replaced. Estimates put the number of Egyptian tanks at 400, when there were in fact 800 tanks across the canal by Sunday evening. In light of the apparent superiority, Gonen recommended a frontal attack at night with Adan&#x27;s 162nd Division crossing to the west bank at El-Qantarah and Sharon&#x27;s 143rd Division crossing into Suez City. Adan however, lacking infantry, urged a cautious approach until more reserves reached the front.

Elazar favored caution as well, and decided on a limited attack on the morning of 8 October. Adan would attack southward against Second Army, remaining away from the canal to avoid Egyptian anti-tank weaponry. Sharon would continue the southward probes towards Ismailia as his division moved into its sector, concentrating at Tasa to support Adan if needed. Kept open was the question of an Israeli counter-crossing should such the Egyptians collapse under Israeli counterattacks. Should Adan succeed, Sharon would attack Third Army&#x27;s bridgehead in a manner similar to Adan, and then cross to the west bank. Mandler would remain on the defensive, organizing his division which had been mauled by the fighting, and was down to a few dozen tanks. Elazar clearly emphasized that no canal crossing and no attempt to reach the strongpoints would occur without his approval. The meeting ended at 22:00.

Thereafter, Sharon arrived after missing the entire conference. Speaking with Gonen and the other commanders after Elazar had left, Sharon recommended an immediate assault to relieve the beleaguered strongpoints. Gonen pointed out that this had been the Israeli course of action for the past 14–16 hours, to no avail. However he did not reject Sharon outright, and indeed told him to prepare for such an attack, promising a final decision on the matter before 6:00 at dawn. Nevertheless, Sharon would conform to the original plan for a limited attack on the following day.

===8 October===
The five division-size bridgeheads consolidated themselves on Monday, 8 October into two army-size bridgeheads: the Second Army with its three divisions occupied El-Qantarah in the north to Deversoir in the south, while the Third Army with two divisions occupied the southern end of the Bitter Lakes to a point southeast of Port Tawfiq (at the far end of the canal). These two bridgeheads incorporated a total of 90,000 men and 980 tanks, dug in and entrenched. Each division deployed, in accordance with Operation Badr, two infantry brigades in its forward echelon, and one mechanized infantry brigade in the second echelon. In reserve was one armored brigade. The Egyptians had established anti-tank defences along their lines employing Sagger ATGMs, RPGs, B-10 and B-11 anti tank recoilless rifles.

At dawn a friendly fire incident occurred as the 2nd and 16th Divisions in Second Army were closing the gap between their bridgeheads. While cresting a ridge, two tank platoons from either division confronted each other at . The tank crews were so agitated that they opened fire immediately. Each platoon lost two of its three tanks to direct hits within minutes, and several men were killed.

Shazly visited the front in the early morning before the Israeli attack to form an assessment of the situation. He arrived at Second Army Headquarters where he was briefed on the situation, then went to 2nd Division&#x27;s advanced headquarters, where he met Brigadier General Hasan Abu Sa&#x27;ada and visited the frontline troops. Many of the soldiers had not slept for two nights, but the successful crossing was a morale booster, a &quot;tonic&quot; as he described it.

Shazly then went southward to 7th Division&#x27;s bridgehead in Third Army&#x27;s sector, where traffic was almost at a standstill. Shazly met with 7th division commander Brigadier General Badawy, who informed him of the bridge-laying problems experienced by 19th Division&#x27;s engineers further south, leading all Third Army supplies and reinforcements to be sent over 7th Division&#x27;s already congested bridges, creating a solid traffic jam. Despite Sunday&#x27;s lull, the situation had not yet improved. This created complications, as soldiers and tank crews lost contact with their units and consequently had no idea of their designated positions. Many troops were low on supplies, and some even returned to the west bank of the canal to replenish their food and water supply.

After conferring with the chief engineers of the Second and Third field armies, Shazly became aware that IAF, despite heavy losses, had destroyed so many bridge sections that the Egyptians had lost the equivalent of three heavy bridges, leaving four bridges in reserve along with the five already laid in the canal. This gave rise to concerns about supply in the coming days and weeks. Shazly then discussed the possibility of constructing three bridges in the canal using earth and sand. This would make causeways impregnable against air strikes and artillery. The chief engineer of the Third Army, with whom he discussed the idea, was confident that, given enough bulldozers, the causeways could be constructed in one week.

====Israeli counterattack====
Shortly after midnight on 8 October, optimistic field reports expecting an imminent Egyptian collapse caused Gonen to alter plans for the attack. Adan would now attack in the direction of the strongpoints at Firdan and Ismailia. The change was not formulated on precise tactical intelligence, and would come to cause some confusion among Israeli commanders for the rest of the day.

Adan&#x27;s 162nd Armoured Division was deployed along the Baluza–Tasa road to the north. His division was composed of Colonel Natke Nir&#x27;s armored brigade with 71 tanks, Gabi Amir&#x27;s brigade with 50 M60 tanks, and Aryeh Keren&#x27;s brigade with 62 tanks (still en route to the area) for a total of 183 tanks. Adan still planned to avoid Egyptian anti-tank weaponry by having Amir&#x27;s brigade move southward between Lexicon and Artillery roads (the former road ran immediately alongside the canal, and the latter was east of it), to reach a position that would link the brigade to the Hizayon strongpoint opposite Firdan and the Purkan strongpoint opposite Ismailia. Nir would move in a similar manner to link up with Purkan. Keren would move east of Artillery Road and position his brigade opposite the Matzmed strongpoint at the northern end of the Bitter Lakes. A mechanized infantry brigade with 44 Super Shermans was expected to join in the attack by late morning. Little or no air support would come for the attack; the IAF was concentrated on the Syrian front.

At 07:53, minutes before the Israeli attack was to commence, Israeli forces near El-Qantarah became heavily engaged with a brigade composing the 18th Division&#x27;s right flank, as Egyptian troops sought to secure the town and its vicinity. Fuad, the division commander supported the brigade with two companies of T-62 tanks. To prevent Israeli forces in the area from being outflanked, Gonen ordered Nir to remain near El-Qantarah to help contain the Egyptian attack. This left Adan with only 50 tanks under Amir&#x27;s command to carry out the attack.

Amir began the drive south at 08:06, and was ordered to prepare to reach the strongpoints on Adan&#x27;s signal. Keren was still en route to the area. Once his brigade arrived he would conduct an assault against 16th Division&#x27;s bridgehead in the direction of Matzmed. However, Amir made an error in navigation, and instead of moving from the canal, he moved along Artillery road, away. Consequently, Amir would be forced to conduct a frontal assault in an east-west direction instead of the north-south flanking maneuver which Adan had planned.

Amir&#x27;s brigade began to reach the plain between Artillery Road and the Firdan bridge at 09:00. So far no Egyptian resistance of any significance had been encountered. The brigade had the objective of attacking 2nd Division&#x27;s bridgehead. Abu Sa&#x27;ada, the division commander, had the 24th Armored Brigade as the divisional reserve, but he could only commit it in case of an Israeli penetration. Gonen wanted Adan to reach the Hizayon strongpoint, and contacted Elazar in Tel Aviv at 09:55 to request a crossing of the canal. Gonen either downplayed or ignored negative reports and only told Elazar of positive developments. Elazar, who was at a meeting, communicated with Gonen through his assistant and approved of a crossing, also giving permission for Sharon&#x27;s division to move south.

At 10:40, Gonen ordered Adan to cross to the west bank and Sharon to move towards Suez City. Short of forces, Adan requested that Sharon send a battalion to protect his southern flank. Gonen consented, but Sharon would not comply, and consequently several critical positions would be lost to the Egyptians later on.

Just before the assault commenced, one of Amir&#x27;s battalions disengaged to restock on ammunition and fuel. The other battalion proceeded with the assault at 11:00. Some 25 tanks carried out an assault planned to be performed by 121 tanks. The Israelis broke through the first Egyptian troops and advanced to within of the canal. At this point the Israelis came under heavy fire from anti-tank weaponry, artillery and tanks. The battalion lost 18 tanks within minutes, and most of its commanders were either killed or wounded.

By now Nir had disengaged at El-Qantarah, leaving a battalion behind, and arrived opposite the Firdan bridge at 12:30 with two tank battalions. While Amir and Nir discussed plans for an attack, Keren arrived and Adan ordered him to support Nir and Amir by attacking towards Purkan. Meanwhile, Sharon left Tasa and headed for Suez City, leaving a single reconnaissance company to hold vital ridges such as Hamadia and Kishuf, but not the hills to the north, such as Hamutal. Instead, Keren&#x27;s brigade gained responsibility for these areas, but Sharon&#x27;s action further endangered Adan&#x27;s position.

Amir&#x27;s brigade was now down to one battalion, which was to attack with Nir&#x27;s brigade of 50 tanks. To Amir&#x27;s surprise, a reserve armored battalion of 25 tanks commanded by Colonel Eliashiv Shemshi arrived in the area, en route to Keren&#x27;s brigade. Short of forces, Amir, with Adan&#x27;s approval, commandeered Shemshi&#x27;s battalion, and ordered him to provide covering fire for Nir&#x27;s assault on the Firdan bridge.

At around 13:00, a recon group from 2nd Division discovered around 75 tanks concentrating north east of the bridgehead. Ten minutes later the Egyptians intercepted a radio signal in Hebrew. Nir was informing his command that he was ready to attack within twenty minutes. With little time left, Abu Sa&#x27;ada decided to take a risky move. Estimating, correctly, that the attack would come be directed between his two forward brigades, the weakest point in his lines, Abu Sa&#x27;ada planned to draw Israeli forces into his bridgehead to within three kilometers of the canal before engaging them from all sides, committing all his anti-tank reserves. At 13:30, the attack was carried out by Amir and Nir&#x27;s brigades. A lack of coordination and communication difficulties between both brigades hampered the attack. Nir&#x27;s two battalions attacked at the same time in two echelons. The Egyptians allowed the Israelis to advance, then encircled them. When the attackers entered the prepared killing zone, Egyptian armor of the 24th Brigade opened fire on the advancing tanks, complemented by infantry anti-tank weapons on either flank of the Israeli forces, while tank hunting detachments attacked from the rear. Within just 13 minutes, most of the Israeli force was destroyed—the Egyptians destroyed over 50 tanks and captured eight intact. Among the captured were Lieutenant Colonel Asaf Yaguri, a battalion commander, whose unit lost 32 killed. By the end of the attack Nir had just four operational tanks remaining, including his own. Gabi Amir&#x27;s battalion, attacking to Nir&#x27;s right, was forced to halt his advance after encountering stiff resistance. Amir requested air support several times, but did not receive any.

====Egyptian advance====
Operation Badr called for an enlargement of the bridgeheads on 8 October. To accomplish this, each of the five infantry divisions had to reorganize its forces. Mechanized infantry brigades in the second echelon of divisional lines were to advance between the two forward infantry brigades. Thus the mechanized brigade would form the first line, the two infantry brigades would form the second line, and the reserve armored brigade would constitute a third echelon.

During the afternoon of the 8th, Egyptian artillery barrages and air strikes took place along the entire front against opposing Israeli forces. The Israelis, who believed they were on the counter-offensive, were surprised at the sight of advancing Egyptian troops. Not all advancing Egyptian units managed to reach the mark necessary to control Artillery Road, but each division held positions more than deep. In Second Army&#x27;s sector, the 16th Infantry Division was the most successful by occupying the strategic positions of Mashchir, Televiza, Missouri and Hamutal after fighting that lasted between 2:00 and 4:30 pm. Hamutal was from the canal and overlooked the juncture of Ismailia and Artillery Roads. Brigadier General &#x27;Adil Yusri lost his leg while commanding his brigade&#x27;s attack on these positions. The deepest penetration was in Third Army&#x27;s sector, where the bridgehead reached a depth of nearly . The Egyptians also captured several additional Bar Lev forts.

The Israelis now made an attempt to regain the lost ground. Keren&#x27;s brigade organized for an assault on Hamutal Hill. One battalion provided covering fire, while two battalions under Lieutenant Colonels Dan Spair and Amir (not to be confused with the brigade commander Gabi Amir) attacked with 27 tanks. Nearly from Egyptian positions, Dan Sapir was killed when his tank took a direct hit, disrupting his battalion&#x27;s attack. Amir&#x27;s battalion continued fighting until dusk after losing seven tanks.

Gonen, starting to realise the gravity of Adan&#x27;s position, ordered Sharon at 14:45 to pull back and return to his initial positions. The Erez Armored Brigade arrived to offer assistance to Keren, but poor coordination between the commanders led to the failure of further attempts to capture Hamutal Hill. By the end of the day Adan&#x27;s division alone had lost around 100 tanks.

==Aftermath==
Operation Badr was the opening battle of the Yom Kippur War in the Sinai, and the first major Arab victory against the Israelis in years.

By repelling a division-sized counterattack on 8 October, and establishing bridgeheads on the east bank to a depth of around 15 kilometers, the Egyptians had accomplished the objectives of Operation Badr. At the start of the war, U.S. Secretary of State Henry Kissinger believed that the better-equipped Israelis would secure victory within a few days, and thus tried to delay a ceasefire in the United Nations Security Council. The counterattack on 8 October however, came against American expectations. Kissinger was taken aback when told of the extent of Israel&#x27;s losses on the morning of 9 October by Israeli Ambassador Simcha Dinitz, and asked &quot;Explain to me, how could 400 tanks be lost to the Egyptians?&quot; Dinitz may have threatened Kissinger with the use of nuclear weapons against Egypt and Syria in order to underline the urgency of Israel&#x27;s situation and push the U.S. into initiating an airlift to replace Israel&#x27;s losses. Later that day Kissinger relayed U.S. President Richard Nixon&#x27;s decision to initiate Operation Nickel Grass—which aimed to replace all of Israel&#x27;s material losses—to Dinitz.

The prevailing view of Kissinger and many IDF officers on the Sinai Front was that the tide would quickly turn in their favor. The course of combat on 8 October thus came as a shock. At the end of the day Gonen, commented &quot;It&#x27;s not the Egyptian Army of 1967.&quot; In a press conference at night on 8 October, not knowing that the counteroffensive had been defeated, Elazar claimed that the destruction of the Egyptian Army was underway, and that the IDF would soon &quot;break their [the Arabs military personnel&#x27;s] bones.&quot; He would later regret these statements. Israeli commanders began to doubt Gonen&#x27;s ability. In a meeting with Israeli commanders after midnight on 9 October, Elazar decided to suspend offensive operations until the Syrians had been neutralized, especially since there were just 400 tanks left in the Sinai. Disregarding this new order, Sharon division mounted a major brigade-sized attack the following day. Despite initial successes, the Israelis had been repulsed by the end of the day with no gains, losing around 60 tanks in the process. Gonen was furious at Sharon, not only because of his violation of the decision to remain on the defensive, but also because he had repeatedly disobeyed direct orders from Gonen on a number of occasions. Elazar was equally livid, but rather than remove Sharon, an insubordinate but innovative commander with political connection to the opposition party, Elazar decided to replace Gonen, who had proven to be out of his depth, inept at being an operational commander. Former Chief of Staff Chaim Bar-Lev was brought out of retirement to replace Gonen. To avoid the appearance of firing him, Gonen was retained as deputy to Bar-Lev by Elazar. By 10 October, the front settled into a stalemate.

The success achieved by Operation Badr surprised Egyptian commanders, whose confidence soared. Sadat came under pressure to press the offensive towards the Sinai Passes, but remained unyielding, holding to the original goal of waging a limited war. Ahmed Ismail and Shazly were also on par with Sadat&#x27;s opinion. However, appeals from the Syrians, whose situation was desperate by 9 October, ultimately forced Sadat to change his mind for political reasons, against the protests of his commanders. Consequently, Egypt would lose the initiative to Israel when it launched its unsuccessful attack eastwards on 14 October.

===Political impact===
Soon after the war, many Israelis demanded an impartial inquiry to investigate what became known as the &quot;machdal&quot; (the blunder), with a focus on the shortcomings of the government and the army, particularly their lack of preparedness for the attack and its ramifications. Golda Meir finally agreed to the formation of the Agranat Commission towards the end of November 1973. War veterans and members of the public attacked Meir and Moshe Dayan, while Israeli generals criticised one another&#x27;s performance.

While Meir and the Israeli Labor Party won the elections held in late-December, the release of the Agranat Commission&#x27;s findings in April 1974 and its failure to accuse the nation&#x27;s political leadership of any shortcomings—while recommending the dismissal of several senior officers—led to widespread public outrage. Meir resigned in response to public criticism, but Dayan remained steadfast. Eventually, the 1977 elections saw the end of the Labor Party&#x27;s unchallenged reign over Israeli politics with the election of Menachem Begin and the Likud Party.

The 1973 war convinced the Israelis of the necessity of negotiations with the Arabs. This unprecedented willingness, coupled with Sadat&#x27;s diplomatic initiatives and intercession by the United States to break barriers of mistrust between Egypt and Israel, made possible the long series of discussions between both nations. The negotiations ultimately resulted in the 1978 Camp David Agreements, and the peace treaty between Egypt and Israel in 1979. Thus, without resorting to another major war, Sadat had been able to regain the Sinai through diplomatic means.

<doc id="362916" wikidata="Q1954096" url="?curid=362916" title="Pilgrim (Eric Clapton album)">
<text>Pilgrim is the thirteenth solo studio album by the British rock musician Eric Clapton, released on 10 March 1998 for Reprise Records. The album features all-new studio-recorded material, the first to do so since Clapton&#x27;s 1989 hit album &quot;Journeyman&quot; and was nominated for several music awards. Although most of the critics responded negatively to the 1998 studio effort, it was one of Clapton&#x27;s most commercially successful albums, reaching the Top 10 in twenty-two countries.

==Background==
The album was recorded during 1997 in both Ocean Way and the Olympic Studios. The release of &quot;Pilgrim&quot; marked Clapton&#x27;s first album of all-new original studio material since 1989&#x27;s &quot;Journeyman&quot; album. When being interviewed by Larry King in February 1998, Clapton explained how the album title came to be: &quot;Well, it&#x27;s kind of – I suppose – there&#x27;s a track on the album called &#x27;Pilgrim&#x27; which came first. And when I came to title the album I used that track as a key point to go from, because I thought it was a good way of actually following the thread from &quot;Journeyman&quot; which was the same kind of meaning, really. Just looking at my life as a musician and a lot of other respects. It is autobiographical. And I see myself as kind of being like a lone guy on a quest&quot;. The album cover and packaging for &quot;Pilgrim&quot; was originally conceived by Clapton himself. However, Clapton ultimately commissioned Japanese artist Yoshiyuki Sadamoto, best known for his work on &quot;&quot; and &quot;Neon Genesis Evangelion&quot;, to expand upon his concept and produce the final version of the album cover and packaging artwork. Clapton had become aware of Sadamoto not though his manga and anime work, but his 1993 art book &quot;Alpha&quot;.

In his 2007 autobiography, Clapton noted that he asked his drummer, Steve Gadd, how he would feel about making the saddest record of all time. Gadd said he could work on Clapton&#x27;s idea and the British recording artist chose to start working on the new project, although Clapton felt it could be a worrying time recording the saddest record that has ever been made. Because &quot;My Father&#x27;s Eyes&quot; and &quot;Circus&quot; were the only finished tunes Clapton had when going into the studio, he wrote several new songs stating he worked nearly a whole year every day and night to record good songs with perfect detail. Clapton calls &quot;Pilgrim&quot; one of his favourite albums because he put so much passion and hard work into making it. During that time, Clapton parted with his long-time manager Roger Forrester, mainly because Clapton took so long recording the album and paying too much money on the album, renting several studios for nearly a whole year.

==Composition==
According to the music website AllMusic, the 1998 studio release belongs to the musical genres of both pop and rock music, in styles of album rock, contemporary pop and rock as well as adult contemporary music. &quot;Pilgrim&quot; brings, so the music website says, a slick, smooth, detached, laid-back, mellow, refined, reflective, stylish, sentimental and reserved mood with it. The &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine, however, thinks, the album definitely belongs to the music genre of pop music. The album experiments with drum machines and certain sounds like synthesizers, guitars, strings reminiscent of R&amp;B music. The album features a lot of synth-keyboard sounds and a twenty-piece orchestra on some of the tunes. The music website &quot;CD Shakedown&quot; thinks the album is not rock and not blues, but full-on contemporary pop music. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; calls the album&#x27;s material a &quot;loosely themed soul-song cycle in the tradition of Marvin Gaye [with] effective modern contexts&quot;.

&quot;Pilgrim&quot; features 14 tracks of a total 75 minutes and 33 seconds duration. Twelve of the album&#x27;s tracks were either written completely alone by Clapton, or at least co-written by the British rock musician. The songs &quot;Circus&quot; and &quot;My Father&#x27;s Eyes&quot; were written originally for Clapton&#x27;s 1992 &quot;Unplugged&quot; live album. Although Clapton recorded both of the songs in the acoustic situation, he never officially released the recordings until the deluxe edition of the live album was released in 2013. In his autobiography, Clapton noted, the reason for the delayed release was because he felt the songs were not quite finished. The titles on &quot;Pilgrim&quot; are wide open musically, as the album includes acoustic-style tracks such as &quot;Fall Like Rain&quot;, ballads like &quot;Needs His Woman&quot; and rock tracks like &quot;She&#x27;s Gone&quot;. &quot;Broken Hearted&quot;, a song Clapton wrote with Greg Phillinganes, features synthesizers; it was performed as a live acoustic version during the Montserrat charity concert at the Royal Albert Hall in 1997. Clapton resurrected the song with John Mayer for the CNN Hurricane Relief on 3 September 2005. The album features only two cover versions of songs: &quot;Born in Time&quot;, which was written by Bob Dylan and sent to Clapton by Dylan, as well as &quot;Going Down Slow&quot;, a blues standard, written and recorded by St. Louis Jimmy Oden.

==Release and promotion==
The album was released on 10 March 1998 under Reprise Records, a sublabel of Warner Bros. Records for worldwide territories on compact disc, grammophone record and music cassette. Over the years, &quot;Pilgrim&quot; was re-released in order to meet the ordering quantity. For example, in 2011 and 2013, the record was re-released on 12&quot; vinyl with better quality pressings, and was in 2014 re-released by Audio Fidelity Records as a Super Audio CD. The album was also released alongside &quot;Change the World&quot; as a so-called extended play on 2 February 1999 for WEA International. On 4 August 2008, Welt &amp; Placket released the 1998 record along with 2001&#x27;s &quot;Reptile&quot; as a double album. To help both the album and single sales, Clapton toured the United States and Europe between March and December 1998 on his &quot;Pilgrim World Tour&quot;, followed by the Japan leg of the tour in November 1999. In Germany, the tour was promoted by Volkswagen.

===Singles===
The first single off the &quot;Pilgrim&quot; album was &quot;My Father&#x27;s Eyes&quot;, which was released along with the B-side of the instrumental of &quot;Inside of Me&quot; as both a compact disc single and maxi compact disc single on 9 February 1998. The second single to be released was the rock title &quot;She&#x27;s Gone&quot;. Although the track was not released on either compact disc, digital, cassette or grammophone record formats, it was made available in April 1998 for radio stations as an airplay single. Two months later and three months after the album&#x27;s official release, the third single, titled &quot;Circus&quot; was released as a compact disc release. The single was followed by &quot;Born in Time&quot;, released on 10 July 1998, also on compact disc format. The album&#x27;s last single, &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, was released in November 1998.

==Critical reception==
AllMusic critic Stephen Thomas Erlewine awards the release two out of five possible stars, noting the album &quot;tries to reach a middle ground between the two extremes &#x27;Tears in Heaven&#x27; and &#x27;Change the World&#x27;, balancing tortured lyrics with smooth sonic surfaces&quot;. Erlewine goes on in his review, criticising both Eric Clapton&#x27;s and Simon Climie&#x27;s production: &quot;The problem lies in the production, which relies entirely on stiff mechanical drumbeats, gauzy synthesizers, and meandering instrumental interludes. These ingredients could result in a good record, as &#x27;Change the World&#x27; demonstrated, but not here, due to [the album&#x27;s] monotonous production&quot;. The music critic also notes Clapton&#x27;s singing and playing is weird on &quot;Pilgrim&quot;, noting &quot;Clapton doesn&#x27;t want to shake things up – his singing is startlingly mannered, even on emotionally turbulent numbers like &#x27;My Father&#x27;s Eyes&#x27; or &#x27;Circus&#x27;. Even worse, he&#x27;s content to take a back seat instrumentally, playing slight solos and fills as colorless as the electronic backdrops&quot;. Comparing the album to the hit releases &quot;Journeyman&quot;, &quot;From the Cradle&quot; and &quot;Unplugged&quot;, Erlewine finishes his review for AllMusic, calling the 1998 studio effort full of &quot;blandness&quot; and &quot;disappointing&quot;. Critics from the music website &quot;CD Shakedown&quot; positively note, the album &quot;may put off some of Clapton&#x27;s fans. But the gems are here, including the leadoff single, &#x27;My Father&#x27;s Eyes&#x27; and &#x27;Circus&#x27; as [&quot;Pilgrim&quot;] delivers your money&#x27;s worth [and has] high points&quot;. However, the reviewers criticize the album&#x27;s plus 70 minutes length, finding it &quot;more manageable if Clapton had released it as a double-disc package&quot;. &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; journalist David Wild recalls: &quot;&quot;Pilgrim&quot; will not thrill those looking for From the Cradle II – most of this state-of-the-charts album sounds absolutely nothing like any record Muddy Waters ever made. But it&#x27;s still a blues album in the sense that it captures the sound of a man trying to tame hellhounds from within and without. In the end, &quot;Pilgrim&quot; is not purely anything, except purely moving&quot;. He awarded the release four out of five possible stars. Natalie Nichols from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; rates &quot;Pilgrim&quot; with two out of four possible stars, reviewing it with the predicate &quot;fair&quot; and thinks the majority of tracks on the release were not that thought through, however, two songs were: &quot;&#x27;My Father&#x27;s Eyes&#x27;, Clapton&#x27;s rumination on maturity, hold their own against the wall of sound. While his guitar playing is kept on its usual leash here, he lets loose occasional bursts of staccato blues licks, as on the funky &#x27;She&#x27;s Gone&#x27;, which musters up some sass to offset all the heartbreak&quot;. Nichols disliked the album&#x27;s &quot;schmaltzy ballads&quot; the most. Robert Christgau rated &quot;Pilgrim&quot; with a &quot;C+&quot;.

Critic Harry Sumrall from MTV thinks the album &quot;proclaimes&quot; Clapton&#x27;s &quot;Clapton is God&quot; reputation. &quot;Billboard&quot; magazine&#x27;s Paul Verna thinks, nearly all the material on &quot;Pilgrim&quot; falls short of what Clapton&#x27;s fans expect. He goes on in his review, stating &quot;Pilgrim&quot; sounds like a demo recording, however, Verna also likes some of the album&#x27;s tracks, but calls &quot;Pilgrim&quot; a release, which does not live up to Clapton&#x27;s giant legacy. Critics from the music website Sputnikmusic awarded the release with only two points, rating it &quot;poor&quot; by saying: &quot;&quot;Pilgrim&quot; is a massive chore to listen to. It&#x27;s half-hearted, boring, it doesn&#x27;t rock, the lyrics are bad, and both the music and vocals are so professional they&#x27;re bland&quot;. For their review, the critics explained the bad remarks of the album, starting with Clapton&#x27;s vocals, which are &quot;bad&quot;, because &quot;Clapton sings every song in a very smooth, flat manner&quot;. Going on in their review, Sputnikmusic notes the lyrics of every song are &quot;horrendous, torturously clichéd, that sound machine-generated&quot;. By finishing the review, the critics note the material on the album &quot;does not rock in any way whatsoever. In fact, it&#x27;s more adult contemporary/bad R&amp;B than anything approaching rock&quot;. Music journalists from the &quot;People&quot; magazine think the album occasionally offers &quot;moments of surpassing beauty&quot;, but note &quot;at 75 minutes, &quot;Pilgrim&quot; is one long, slow slog, interrupted by only two or three uptempo tunes. Listening is like sitting through a film you much admire but fervently wish would hurry up and end&quot;. Critics from &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; recall: &quot;It&#x27;s impossible to fault [Clapton] for any ongoing numbness from his loss. But the truly sad thing about &quot;Pilgrim&quot; – for Clapton and maybe all of us – is that not even music may have the power to heal certain types of pain&quot;. The website rated the release with a &quot;B−&quot;. &quot;The New York Times&quot;&#x27; critic Stephen Holden notes: &quot;The best songs on this bleakly eloquent album of orchestrated blues meditations express a choked-up grief and despair that slices to the bone. The year&#x27;s most underrated album. Killer cuts: &#x27;Pilgrim&#x27; and &#x27;Inside of Me&#x27;&quot;.

<doc id="362917" wikidata="Q636569" url="?curid=362917" title="Hatfield–McCoy feud">
<text>The Hatfield–McCoy Feud involved two American families of the West Virginia–Kentucky area along the Tug Fork of the Big Sandy River from 1863 to 1891. The Hatfields of West Virginia were led by William Anderson &quot;Devil Anse&quot; Hatfield, while the McCoys of Kentucky were under the leadership of Randolph &quot;Ole Ran&#x27;l&quot; McCoy. Those involved in the feud were descended from Joseph Hatfield and William McCoy (born ). The feud gained national attention through tabloid coverage, and has entered the American folklore lexicon as a metonym for any bitterly feuding rival parties.

The McCoy family lived primarily on the Kentucky side of the Tug Fork; the Hatfields lived mostly on the West Virginia side. The majority of the Hatfields, although living in Mingo County (then part of Logan County), fought for the Confederacy in the American Civil War; most McCoys also fought for the Confederates, with the exception of Asa Harmon McCoy, who fought for the Union. The first real violence in the feud was the death of Asa as he returned from the war, murdered by a group of Confederate Home Guards called the Logan Wildcats. Devil Anse Hatfield was a suspect at first, but was later confirmed to have been sick at home at the time of the murder. It was widely believed that his uncle, Jim Vance, a member of the Wildcats, committed the murder.

The Hatfields were more affluent and had many more political connections than the McCoys. Anse&#x27;s timbering operation was a source of wealth for his family, while the McCoys were more of a lower-middle-class family. Ole Ran&#x27;l owned a farm. Both families had also been involved in the manufacturing and selling of illegal moonshine, a popular commodity at the time.

==Feud==
===Civil War===

Asa Harmon McCoy joined the 45th Kentucky Infantry on October 20, 1863. According to his Compiled Service Records, he was &quot;captured by Rebels&quot; on December 5, 1863, and was released four months later to a Union hospital in Maryland. At the time of his capture, he was recovering from a gunshot wound to the chest. During the early months of the Civil War, Asa joined a company of the Pike County Home Guards, under the command of Uriah Runyon, and it is thought he sustained the wound while serving in this unit. William Francis also led a company of Pike County Guards during 1862, a group of which attacked and shot Mose Christian Cline, a friend of Devil Anse Hatfield. Although Cline survived his wounds, Anse vowed to retaliate against the responsible parties. Some time in 1863, a group of Confederate Home Guards ambushed and killed Francis as he was leaving his house, and Anse took credit for the deed. Runyon later joined the 39th Kentucky Infantry and was killed on May 7, 1864, in Pike County, Kentucky. His Compiled Service Records say &quot;Killed by Rebels&quot;.

On muster rolls beginning on May 6, 1864, Asa is reported in a Lexington hospital, suffering from a leg fracture. Beginning in December 1864, the 45th Kentucky Infantry began mustering its companies out of service. Asa&#x27;s Company E was mustered out on December 24, 1864, in Ashland. He was killed near his home on January 7, 1865, just thirteen days after leaving the Union Army. A group of Confederate guerrillas took credit for the killing, and his wife&#x27;s pension application states that he was &quot;killed by Rebels&quot;. There are no existing records pertaining to his death, and no warrants were issued in connection with the murder. McCoy family tradition points to James &quot;Jim&quot; Vance, an uncle of Anse and a member of a West Virginia militia group, as the culprit.

===Escalation===
The second recorded instance of violence in the feud occurred thirteen years later, in 1878, after a dispute about the ownership of a hog: Floyd Hatfield, a cousin of Anse, owned the hog, but Randolph McCoy claimed it was his, saying that the notches on the pig&#x27;s ears were McCoy, not Hatfield, marks. The matter was taken to the local Justice of the Peace, Anderson &quot;Preacher Anse&quot; Hatfield, who ruled in favor of the Hatfields by the testimony of Bill Staton, a relative of both families. In June 1880, Staton was killed by two McCoy brothers, Sam and Paris, who were later acquitted on the grounds of self-defense.

The feud escalated after Roseanna McCoy entered a relationship with Devil Anse&#x27;s son Johnson, known as &quot;Johnse&quot; (spelled &quot;Jonce&quot; in some sources), leaving her family to live with the Hatfields in West Virginia. Roseanna eventually returned to the McCoys, but when the couple tried to resume their relationship, Johnse was arrested by the McCoys on outstanding Kentucky bootlegging warrants. He was freed from McCoy custody only when Roseanna made a desperate midnight ride to alert Anse, who organized a rescue party. The Hatfield party surrounded the McCoys and took Johnse back to West Virginia before he could be transported the next day to the county seat in Pikeville, Kentucky. Despite what was seen as her betrayal of her own family on his behalf, Johnse thereafter abandoned the pregnant Roseanna for her cousin, Nancy McCoy, whom he wed in 1881.

The feud continued in 1882 when Ellison Hatfield, brother of Anse, was killed by three of Roseanna&#x27;s younger brothers: Tolbert, Phamer (Pharmer), and Bud. On an election day in Kentucky, the three McCoy brothers fought a drunken Ellison and another Hatfield brother; Ellison was stabbed 26 times and finished off with a gunshot. The McCoy brothers were initially arrested by Hatfield constables and were taken to Pikeville for trial. Secretly, Anse organized a large group of vigilantes and intercepted the constables and their McCoy prisoners before they reached Pikeville. The brothers were taken by force to West Virginia. When Ellison died from his injuries, all three McCoy brothers were killed by the Hatfields in turn: they were tied to pawpaw bushes and each was shot numerous times, with a total of fifty shots fired. Their bodies were described as &quot;bullet-riddled&quot;. Soon, another McCoy, the second son of the murdered Asa named Larkin &quot;Lark&quot; McCoy, was ambushed by an alleged West Virginia posse led by the Hatfields.

Even though the Hatfields and most inhabitants of the area believed their revenge was warranted, up to about twenty men, including Anse, were indicted. All of the Hatfields eluded arrest; this angered the McCoy family, who took their cause up with Perry Cline. Upon hearing of the meeting, Anse resolved to stop Randall and sent gunmen to ambush Randall and his son Calvin, but the gunmen killed Randall&#x27;s nephews John and Henderson Scott instead after mistaking them for their targets. Cline, who was Martha McCoy&#x27;s brother, is believed to have used his political connections to reinstate the charges and announced rewards for the Hatfields&#x27; arrests as an act of revenge. A few years prior, Cline had lost a lawsuit against Anse over the deed to thousands of acres of land, subsequently increasing the hatred between the two families.

Days after the killing of the Scotts, acting constable Cap Hatfield and family friend Tom Wallace broke into the house of Bill Daniels and flogged his wife Mary, sister of Jeff McCoy, who they suspected of warning her brother&#x27;s family of danger. Jeff McCoy heard of the whipping in 1886 while on the run for the murder of mail carrier Fred Wolford. Infuriated, he and his friend Josiah Hurley set out to capture Tom Wallace and take him to jail in Pikeville, but he escaped them. As Jeff tried to flee, he was shot dead by Cap and Wallace on the banks of the Tug Fork. Two other McCoys, Jake and Larkin, once again attempted to arrest Tom Wallace for the assault on Mary Daniels in August 1887, but he managed to escape from jail; he was found murdered the following year, likely by the McCoys. Larkin &quot;Lark&quot; McCoy was the second son of the murdered Asa McCoy. He too was ambushed and murdered by an alleged West Virginia posse led by the Hatfields.

===New Year Massacre===
The feud reached its peak during the 1888 New Year&#x27;s Night Massacre. Cap and Vance led several members of the Hatfield clan to surround the McCoy cabin and opened fire on the sleeping family. Awakened by the shooting, the McCoys managed to grab their weapons and fired back. The cabin was then set on fire in an effort to drive the McCoys into the open.

Panicking, the McCoys rushed to every exit they could find. Randolph managed to escape and hide inside the pig pen. Most of his children managed to escape into the woods. Two of Randolph&#x27;s children, Calvin and Alifair, were shot and killed near the family well as they exited their home. Randolph&#x27;s wife, Sarah, was caught, beaten, and almost killed by Vance and Johnse. With his house burning, Randolph and his remaining family members were able to escape farther into the wilderness; his children, unprepared for the elements, suffered frostbite. The remaining McCoys moved to Pikeville to escape the West Virginia raiding parties.

===Battle of the Grapevine Creek===

Between 1880 and 1891, the feud claimed more than a dozen members of the two families. On one occasion, the governors of West Virginia and Kentucky even threatened to have their militias invade each other&#x27;s states. In response, Kentucky Governor S. B. Buckner sent his Adjutant General Sam Hill to Pike County to investigate the situation.

A few days after the New Year&#x27;s Massacre, a posse led by Pike County Deputy Sheriff Frank Philipps rode out to track down Anse&#x27;s group across the state line into West Virginia. Two McCoys were members of Philipps&#x27; posse, Bud and one of Randolph&#x27;s sons, James &quot;Jim&quot; McCoy. The posse&#x27;s first victim was Vance, who was killed in the woods after he refused to be arrested. Philipps then made other successive raids on Hatfield homes and supporters, capturing many and killing another three Hatfield supporters, before cornering the rest in Grapevine Creek on January 19. Unfortunately for Philipps, Anse and other Hatfields were waiting for them with an armed group of their own. A battle ensued between the two parties, and the Hatfields were eventually apprehended. A deputy, Bill Dempsey, was wounded and executed by Frank Philipps after they surrendered. On August 24, 1888, eight of the Hatfields and their friends were indicted for the murder of Randolph&#x27;s young daughter Alifair McCoy (sometimes spelled Allaphare), who was killed during the New Year&#x27;s Massacre. They included Cap, Johnse, Robert and Elliot Hatfield, Ellison Mounts, French Ellis, Charles Gillespie, and Thomas Chambers.

===Trial===
Because of issues of due process and illegal extradition, the United States Supreme Court became involved (&quot;Mahon v. Justice&quot;, 127 U.S. 700 (1888)). The Supreme Court ruled 7–2 in favor of Kentucky, holding that, even if a fugitive is returned from the asylum state illegally instead of through lawful extradition procedure, no federal law prevents him from being tried. Eventually, the men were tried in Kentucky and all were found guilty. Seven received life imprisonment, while the eighth, Ellison &quot;Cottontop&quot; Mounts, was executed by hanging and buried in an unmarked grave within sight of the gallows.

Ellison had tried to retract his confession, stating that he was innocent and that he had only confessed because he expected leniency, but his retraction was denied. Thousands attended his hanging in Pikeville, but though the scaffold was in the open, its base was fenced in to comply with laws that had been passed which prohibited public executions. The hanging site is the current location of a classroom building of the present-day University of Pikeville. With his last words, Ellison claimed that: &quot;The Hatfields made me do it.&quot; No one had been sent to the gallows in Pike County for forty years, and after Ellison, no one ever was again.

Of those sent to prison:
* Valentine &quot;Uncle Wall&quot; Hatfield, elder brother of Anse, was overshadowed by Anse&#x27;s ambitions but was one of the eight convicted, dying in prison of unknown causes. He had petitioned his brothers to assist in his emancipation from jail, but none came for fear of being captured and brought to trial. He was buried in the prison cemetery, which has since been paved over.
* Doc D. Mahon, son-in-law of Valentine and brother of Pliant, one of the eight Hatfields convicted, served 14 years in prison before returning home to live with his son, Melvin.
* Pliant Mahon, son-in-law of Valentine, served fourteen years in prison before returning home to rejoin his ex-wife, who had remarried but left her second husband to live with Pliant again.

Fighting between the families eased following the hanging of Mounts. Trials continued for years until the 1901 trial of Johnse, who was sentenced to life imprisonment for his involvement in the New Year&#x27;s Massacre in the last of the feud trials.

==Genetic disease==
The feud may have been caused in part by Von Hippel–Lindau disease, a genetic disease in the McCoy family, which causes a predisposition to anger.

==In the modern era==
In 1979, the families united for a special week&#x27;s taping of the popular game show &quot;Family Feud&quot;, in which they played for a cash prize and a pig which was kept on stage during the games. The McCoy family won the week-long series three games to two. While the Hatfield family won more money – $11,272.32 to the McCoys&#x27; $8,459.53—the decision was made to augment the McCoy family&#x27;s winnings to $11,273.37.

Tourists travel to those parts of West Virginia and Kentucky each year to examine the relics that remain from the days of the feud. In 1999, a large project known as the &quot;Hatfield and McCoy Historic Site Restoration&quot; was completed, funded by a federal grant from the Small Business Administration. Many improvements to various feud sites were completed. A committee of local historians spent months researching reams of information to find out about the factual history of the events surrounding the feud. This research was compiled in an audio compact disc, the &quot;Hatfield–McCoy Feud Driving Tour&quot;, which is available only at the Pike County Tourism CVB Visitors Center in Pikeville. The CD is a self-guided driving tour of the restored feud sites and includes maps and pictures as well as the audio CD. The driving tour leads visitors to feud related points of interest including the gravesites of the feudists, the &quot;Hog Trial Cabin&quot;, also known as Valentine Hatfield&#x27;s cabin, Randolph McCoy&#x27;s homeplace and well in Hardy, Kentucky, Aunt Betty&#x27;s House and many more sites, some complete with historical markers.

Great-great-great-grandsons Bo McCoy and Ron McCoy of feud patriarch Randolph McCoy organized a joint family reunion of the Hatfield and McCoy families in 2000 that garnered national attention. More than 5,000 people attended.


In 2002, Bo and Ron McCoy brought a lawsuit to acquire access to the McCoy Cemetery which holds the graves of six family members, including five slain during the feud. The McCoys took on a private property owner, John Vance, who had restricted access to the cemetery.

In the 2000s, a all-terrain vehicle trail system, the Hatfield–McCoy Trails, was created around the theme of the feud.

On June 14, 2003, in Pikeville, Kentucky, the McCoy cousins partnered with Reo Hatfield of Waynesboro, Virginia, to declare an official truce between the families. Reo Hatfield said that he wanted to show that if the two families could reach an accord, others could also. He had said that he wanted to send a broader message to the world that when national security is at risk, Americans put their differences aside and stand united: &quot;We&#x27;re not saying you don&#x27;t have to fight because sometimes you do have to fight,&quot; he said. &quot;But you don&#x27;t have to fight forever.&quot; Signed by more than sixty descendants during the fourth Hatfield–McCoy Festival, the truce was touted as a proclamation of peace, saying &quot;We ask by God&#x27;s grace and love that we be forever remembered as those that bound together the hearts of two families to form a family of freedom in America.&quot; Governor Paul E. Patton of Kentucky and Governor Bob Wise of West Virginia signed proclamations declaring June 14 Hatfield and McCoy Reconciliation Day. Ron McCoy, one of the festival&#x27;s founders, said it is unknown where the three signed proclamations will be exhibited and that &quot;the Hatfields and McCoys symbolize violence and feuding and fighting, but by signing this, hopefully people will realize that&#x27;s not the final chapter.&quot;

The Hatfield and McCoy Reunion Festival and Marathon are held annually in June on a three-day weekend. The events take place in Pikeville, Kentucky, Matewan, West Virginia, and Williamson, West Virginia. The festival commemorates the famed feud and includes a marathon and half-marathon (the motto is &quot;no feudin&#x27;, just runnin&#x27;&quot;), in addition to an ATV ride in all three towns. There is also a tug-of-war across the Tug Fork tributary near which the feuding families lived, a live re-enactment of scenes from their most famous fight, a motorcycle ride, live entertainment, Hatfield–McCoy landmark tours, a cornbread contest, pancake breakfast, arts, crafts, and dancing. Launched in 2000, the festival typically attracts thousands with more than 300 runners taking part in the races.

In August 2015 members of both families helped archeologists dig for ruins at a site where they believe Randolph McCoy&#x27;s house was burned.

In September 2018, a wooden statue, standing over 8 feet tall, was erected in honor of Randolph McCoy at the McCoy homeplace in Hardy, Kentucky. Carved by chainsaw carver Travis Williams and donated to the property, this statue had been commissioned by McCoy property owner and Hatfield descendant Bob Scott. The statue was unveiled during Hatfield-McCoy Heritage Days in Pike County, Kentucky, an event that occurs every September that brings Hatfield and McCoy descendants back to Pike County to celebrate the long-standing peace between the families. The McCoy homeplace, like many others associated with the feud, is open to tourists year-round.

In September 2024, following a shooting on Interstate 75 in Kentucky, the body of the shooter, Joseph Couch was discovered by Fred and Sheila McCoy, who run a museum in Liberty about the feud, the couple found the body while streaming on YouTube. Fred is related to both the Hatfield and McCoy families.

==Media==
===Film===
The 1923 Buster Keaton comedy &quot;Our Hospitality&quot; centers on the &quot;Canfield–McKay feud,&quot; a fictionalized version of the Hatfield–McCoy feud.

The 1938 Merrie Melodies cartoon &quot;A Feud There Was&quot; depicts a feud between two backwoods families, called the Weavers and the McCoys. It features Elmer Fudd (an early version before he became a hunter) - trying to put an end to the feuding between the two hillbilly clans.

The 1939 Max Fleischer cartoon &quot;Musical Mountaineers&quot; has Betty Boop wander into the territory of the Peters family who are at war with the Hatfields.

The 1943 Walter Lantz Swing Symphony cartoon &quot;Pass the Biscuits Mirandy!&quot; depicts the feud between the Foys and Bartons, basing off from the lyrics of a song of the same title.

The 1946 Disney cartoon short &quot;The Martins and the Coys&quot; in &quot;Make Mine Music&quot; animated feature was another very thinly disguised caricature of the Hatfield–McCoy feud.

In 1949, the Samuel Goldwyn feature film &quot;Roseanna McCoy&quot; told a fictionalized version of the romance between the title character, played by Joan Evans, and Johnse Hatfield, played by Farley Granger.

The 1949 Screen Songs short &quot;Comin&#x27; Round the Mountain&quot; features another thinly disguised caricature of the Hatfield–McCoy feud, with cats (called &quot;Catfields&quot;) and dogs (&quot;McHounds&quot;) fighting each other, until a new school teacher arrives.

In 1950, Warner Bros. released a spoof of the Hatfield–McCoy feud titled &quot;Hillbilly Hare&quot;, featuring Bugs Bunny interacting with members of the &quot;Martin family&quot;, obviously a reference to a family in the other famous Kentucky feud, the Rowan County War who had been feuding with the &quot;Coy family&quot;. When Bugs Bunny is asked, &quot;Be y&#x27;all a Martin or be y&#x27;all a Coy rabbit?&quot;, Bugs answers, &quot;Well, my friends say I&#x27;m very coy!&quot; and laughs. The Martin brothers chase Bugs for the rest of the short and are outwitted by him at every turn.

The 1951 Abbott and Costello feature &quot;Comin&#x27; Round the Mountain&quot; features a feud between the Winfields and McCoys.

The 2007 movie &quot;&quot; portrays the feud between the Hatfields and McCoys, but the circumstances of the feud are different.

In 2012, Lionsgate Films released a direct-to-DVD film titled &quot;Hatfields &amp; McCoys: Bad Blood&quot;, starring Jeff Fahey, Perry King, and Christian Slater. This was another thinly-disguised fictional version of the conflict.

===Literature===
Members of the Hatfield clan appear in Manly Wade Wellman&#x27;s 1957 short story &quot;Old Devlins Was A-Waiting&quot; alongside fictional great-grandchildren of both the Hatfields and McCoys.

The Lucky Luke adventure &quot;Les Rivaux de Painful Gulch&quot; (The Rivals of Painful Gulch) from 1962 was inspired by the Hatfield–McCoy feud.

Ann Rinaldi authored a 2002 historical novel titled &quot;The Coffin Quilt&quot;, based on a fictionalized account of the feud.

In Kurt Vonnegut&#x27;s 1976 novel &quot;Slapstick&quot;, a frontiersman dressed like &quot;Davy Crockett&quot; kills a man charged with conveying a message to the former of the United States because he mistakes him for Newton McCoy. When the frontiersman is asked his name, he replies &quot;Byron Hatfield&quot;.

In Mark Twain&#x27;s 1884 novel &quot;Adventures of Huckleberry Finn&quot;, the Grangerfords, an aristocratic Kentuckian family headed by the sexagenarian Colonel Saul Grangerford, take Huck in after he is separated from Jim on the Mississippi. Huck becomes close friends with the youngest male of the family, Buck Grangerford, who is Huck&#x27;s age. By the time Huck meets them, the Grangerfords have been engaged in an age-old blood feud with another local family, the Shepherdsons. He also becomes the unwitting correspondent between two young lovers among the families, an elopement which leads to a battle between the two families and the loss of several lives on both sides.

===Television===
The 1960 episode of &quot;The Andy Griffith Show&quot; titled &quot;A Feud is a Feud&quot; has a Wakefield and a Carter trying to prevent Andy, in his role as Justice of the Peace, from marrying two young lovers on opposite sides of the feud. Andy calls the two feuding fathers to a duel when he finds out that &quot;not nary a shot had ever been fired during this feud&quot;. Both prove to be cowards in comparison with their courageous children, and the feuding fathers order Andy at gunpoint: &quot;Sheriff, get to marryin&#x27;!&quot;

In the &quot;Bonanza&quot; episode &quot;The Gunmen&quot; (season 1, episode 19; aired January 23, 1960) Joe and Hoss were mistaken for two gunmen called Sladeboys that were hired by Mcfadden (McCoy) to take out the Hatfields in the small Texas town of Kiowa Flats.

<text>Der Struwwelpeter (&quot;shock-headed Peter&quot;) is an 1845 German children&#x27;s book written and illustrated by Heinrich Hoffmann. It comprises ten illustrated and rhymed stories, mostly about children. Each cautionary tale has a clear moral lesson that demonstrates the disastrous consequences of misbehavior in an exaggerated way. The title of the first story provides the title of the whole book. &quot;Der Struwwelpeter&quot; is one of the earliest books for children that combines visual and verbal narratives in a book format, and is considered a precursor to comic books.

&quot;Der Struwwelpeter&quot; is known for introducing the villainous character of the Tailor (or Scissorman) to Western literature. Some researchers now see the stories in the book as illustrations of modern child mental disorders.

==Background==

Hoffmann wrote the book that would later be titled Struwwelpeter in reaction to what he perceived as a lack of good books for children. Intending to buy a picture book as a Christmas present for his three-year-old son, Hoffmann instead wrote and illustrated his own book. At the time of producing it, Hoffmann had no intentions of publishing his book.

===Publications===
The first appearance of Hoffmann&#x27;s book outside his immediate family circle was in a meeting organized by Frankfurt literary club Tutti Frutti Society (&quot;Gesellschaft der Tutti-Frutti&quot;) on 18 January 1845. On the evening of that day, Zacharias Löwenthal, a co-founder of publishing company Literarische Anstalt, bought Hoffmann&#x27;s book for 80 gulden. Hoffmann later wrote that &quot;[in] that night, at 11 o&#x27;clock, I had, almost without knowing what I had done, suddenly become an author of juvenile books.&quot;

The book first appeared in the Frankfurt marketplace in October of that year under the title &quot;Lustige Geschichten und drollige Bilder mit 15 schön kolorierten Tafeln für Kinder von 3–6 Jahren&quot; (&quot;funny stories and droll pictures with 15 beautifully coloured panels for children of 3–6 years&quot;). The first version had its illustrations printed with lithographic plates and colored by hand with stencils, the text was printed using typesetting. On 3 October, the book was advertised in the Börsenblatt for a retail price of 48 kreuzer.

In 1846, three other editions of the book were published. The second edition had 5,000 copies produced, each of which was priced at 57 kreuzer; Hoffmann&#x27;s royalty was of 6.25 percent per copy. Hoffmann&#x27;s name was only partially revealed in the second edition, where he used the pseudonym &quot;Hoffmann Kinderslieb&quot;. His authorship of the book was, however, fully revealed to the public in an advertisement featured on a Frankfurter Konversationsblatt publication on 11 December 1846. Hoffmann&#x27;s real name was only fully displayed in the fifth edition, which was published in 1847.

The third edition was the first to be officially titled &quot;Struwwelpeter&quot;, though the second edition had already been nicknamed as such by some book reviewers.

===English editions===
The titles &quot;Struwelpeter&quot; and &quot;Strewelpeter&quot; have been used in multiple English editions of &quot;Struwwelpeter&quot;. The name &quot;Slovenly Peter&quot; was first found in an 1849 American version of the book.

British twin illustrators Janet and Anne Grahame Johnstone provided new illustrations for an English translation published in 1950.

===Copyright issues===
In 1847, &quot;Struwwelpeter&quot; publishing house sued a Nuremberg publisher for printing the book on broadsheets.

In 1851, the same organization sued publisher Christian Scholz on grounds that he had plagiarized &quot;Struwwelpeter&quot; by publishing translations of the book in English, Dutch and Swedish. Scholz lost the case and was sentenced to pay a fine of 1,040 gulden, along with court costs of 127 gulden. He was also ordered to destroy all lithographic plates and unsold books in his inventory. This became one of the first copyright court cases in Germany.

In 1891 Mark Twain wrote his own translation of the book, but because of copyright issues Twain&#x27;s &quot;Slovenly Peter&quot; was not published until 1935, 25 years after his death.

==The stories==
#&quot;Struwwelpeter&quot; describes a lazy, dirty boy who does not groom himself properly and is consequently unpopular.
#&quot;Die Geschichte vom bösen Friederich&quot; (&quot;The Story of Wicked Frederick&quot;): A violent boy terrorizes animals and people. Eventually he is bitten by a dog, who goes on to eat the boy&#x27;s food while Frederick is bedridden.
#&quot;Die gar traurige Geschichte mit dem Feuerzeug&quot; (&quot;The Very Sad Tale with the Matches&quot;): A girl plays with matches, accidentally ignites herself and burns to death. Only her cats mourn her.
#&quot;Die Geschichte von den schwarzen Buben&quot; (&quot;The Story of the Inky Boys&quot;): Nikolas (or &quot;Agrippa&quot; in some translations) catches three boys teasing a dark-skinned boy. To teach them a lesson, he dips them in black ink.
#&quot;Die Geschichte von dem wilden Jäger&quot; (&quot;The Story of the Wild Huntsman&quot;) is the only story not primarily focused on children. In it, a hare steals a hunter&#x27;s musket and eyeglasses and begins to hunt the hunter. In the ensuing chaos, the hare&#x27;s child is burned by hot coffee and the hunter jumps into a well.
#&quot;Die Geschichte vom Daumenlutscher&quot; (&quot;The Story of the Thumb-Sucker&quot;): A mother warns her son Konrad not to suck his thumbs. However, when she goes out of the house he resumes his thumb-sucking, until a roving tailor appears and cuts off his thumbs with giant scissors.
#&quot;Die Geschichte vom Suppen-Kaspar&quot; (&quot;The Story of Soup-Kaspar&quot;) begins as Kaspar (or &quot;Augustus&quot; in some translations), a healthy, strong boy, proclaims that he will no longer eat his soup. Over the next five days, he becomes skinny, wastes away, and dies. The last illustration shown is of his grave, which has a soup tureen atop it.
#&quot;Die Geschichte vom Zappel-Philipp&quot; (&quot;The Story of Fidgety Philip&quot;): A boy who won&#x27;t sit still at dinner accidentally knocks all of the food onto the floor, to his parents&#x27; great displeasure.
#&quot;Die Geschichte von Hans Guck-in-die-Luft&quot; (&quot;The Story of Johnny Look-In-The-Air&quot;) concerns a boy who habitually fails to watch where he is walking. One day he walks into a river; he is soon rescued, but his briefcase drifts away.
#&quot;Die Geschichte vom fliegenden Robert&quot; (&quot;The Story of Flying Robert&quot;): A boy goes outside during a storm. The wind catches his umbrella and lifts him high into the air, with the boy sailing into the distance.

==Music, film, and stage adaptations==

A British stage production of &quot;Shockheaded Peter&quot;, by Philip Carr and Nigel Playfair, with music by Walter Rubens, premiered at the Garrick Theatre in London on 26 December 1900, and played 41 performances. The title role was played by George Grossmith Jr., with Kate Bishop as Mamma and Kitty Loftus as Harriet. The piece returned to the Garrick the following year, again playing 41 performances from 14 December, this time with Lawrence Grossmith as Peter, Nina Boucicault as Harriet and 11-year-old Marie Lohr as &quot;Child&quot;. In a revival at the Wimbledon Theatre in South London from 26 December 1929 Mamma was played in a limited run of matinees by Louie Pounds, with H. Scott Russell as Papa, Leslie Holland as Augustus and Rex London as Peter.

Geoffrey Shaw&#x27;s &quot;Struwelpeter&quot;, produced in 1914, featured the song &quot;Conrad Suck-a-Thumb&quot; by Martin Shaw.

A ballet of &quot;Der Struwwelpeter&quot; with music composed by Norbert Schultze was produced in Germany before World War II.

A live action film based on the book was released in Germany in 1955. Directed by Fritz Genschow, in this adaptation there is a &quot;happy&quot; ending where the characters&#x27; bad deeds are reversed.

&quot;Little Suck-a-Thumb&quot; (1992) is a psychoanalytical interpretation of the infamous cautionary tale. The short film by writer/director David Kaplan stars Cork Hubbert and Evelyn Solann, with Jim Hilbert as the Great Tall Scissorman.

&quot;The Misadventures of Struwwelpeter&quot; for tenor and piano (also orchestrated for chamber ensemble) was composed by Michael Schelle in 1991. Five of the stories are included in the original version with piano. &quot;Inky Boys&quot; is included only in the chamber version.

&quot;Struwwelpeterlieder&quot; (1996) is a setting of three of the stories for soprano, viola and piano by American composer Lowell Liebermann.

German composer Kurt Hessenberg (a descendant of Hoffmann) arranged &quot;Der Struwwelpeter&quot; for children&#x27;s choir (op. 49) later in his life.

&quot;Shockheaded Peter&quot; (1998) is a British musical by The Tiger Lillies. that combines elements of pantomime and puppetry with musical versions of the poems with the songs generally following the text. It won a number of British theatre awards in the years following its release.

Composer Kenneth Hesketh&#x27;s 2000–2001 work, &quot;Netsuke&quot; (from the Japanese miniature sculptures called &quot;netsuke&quot;) comprises five short movements inspired variously by Saint-Exupéry&#x27;s &quot;Le Petit Prince&quot;, &quot;Struwwelpeter&quot;, and a poem by Walter de la Mare.

==Comics adaptations==
German comics artist David Füleki has created a number of manga-style adaptions of &quot;Struwwelpeter&quot;:
* &quot;Struwwelpeter: Die Rückkehr&quot; (2009, Tokyopop)
* &quot;Struwwelpeter: Das große Buch der Störenfriede&quot; (2009, Tokyopop)
* &quot;Struwwelpeter in Japan&quot; (Free Comic Book Day comic; 2012, Delfinium Prints)

The Scissorman story is adapted into comics form by Sanya Glisic in &quot;The Graphic Canon&quot;, Volume 2, published in 2012.

==Media influences==
===Literature===
English author Edward Harold Begbie&#x27;s first published book, &quot;The Political Struwwelpeter&quot; (1898), is of British politics, with the British Lion is as Struwwelpeter, &quot;bedraggled, with long, uncut claws.&quot;

W. H. Auden refers to the Scissor-Man in his 1930 poem &quot;The Witnesses&quot; (also known as &quot;The Two&quot;):
Adolf Hitler was parodied as a &quot;Struwwelpeter&quot; caricature in 1941 in a book called &quot;Struwwelhitler&quot;, published in Britain under the pseudonym Dr. Schrecklichkeit (Dr. Horrors).

The &quot;Story of Soup-Kaspar&quot; is parodied in Astrid Lindgren&#x27;s &quot;Pippi Longstocking&quot; (1945), with a tall story about a Chinese boy named Peter who refuses to eat a swallow&#x27;s nest served to him by his father, and dies of starvation five months later.

English illustrator Charles Folkard&#x27;s imaginative study &quot;A Nonsense Miscellany,&quot; published in 1956 in Roger Lancelyn Green&#x27;s anthology &quot;The Book of Nonsense, by Many Authors&quot;, is a seaside scene that incorporated Baron Munchausen, &quot;Struwwelpeter&quot;, and a variety of characters from the works of Lewis Carroll and Edward Lear.

Jamie Rix said that the book inspired him to create &quot;Grizzly Tales for Gruesome Kids&quot; when his publisher asked him to write more short stories about rude children. His mother had given him the book as a child and the stories gave him nightmares. Rix wanted to create a similar series of books for his children&#x27;s generation.

&quot;Der Fall Struwwelpeter&quot; (&quot;The Struwwelpeter Case&quot;), 1989, by Jörg M. Günther is a satirical treatment in which the various misdeeds in the story - both by the protagonists and their surroundings - are analyzed via the regulations of the German Strafgesetzbuch.

The Jasper Fforde fantasy/mystery novel &quot;The Fourth Bear&quot; (Hodder &amp; Stoughton, 2006) opens with a police sting operation by the Nursery Crime Division to arrest the Scissorman.

===Comics===
German cartoonist F. K. Waechter&#x27;s &quot;Anti-Struwwwelpeter&quot; (1970) is a parody of &quot;Der Struwwelpeter&quot;.

Comic book writer Grant Morrison references &quot;Die Geschichte vom Daumenlutscher&quot; in the first story arc of their &quot;Doom Patrol&quot; run with the recurring line, &quot;The door flew open, in he ran / The great, long, red-legged scissorman.&quot; Doom Patrol member Dorothy Spinner, who has the ability to bring imaginary beings to life, considers among her imaginary friends the characters Flying Robert (a ghost baby balloon thing) and The Inky Boys.

The &quot;2000 AD&quot; strip &quot;London Falling&quot; (June–July 2006), by Simon Spurrier and Lee Garbett, explores bogeymen from English folklore and mythology wreaking havoc in a modern-day setting. Two of the characters, Peter Struwwel and The Tailor, are taken from &quot;Der Struwwelpeter&quot;.

In the Wildstorm Comics series &quot;Top 10&quot;, one of the officers in the precinct is called Shock-Headed Pete, ostensibly in reference to his electrical powers.

===Film and TV===
In a 1991 edition of the Thames Television detective series &quot;Van der Valk&quot;, entitled &quot;Doctor Hoffman&#x27;s Children,&quot; the detective, played by Barry Foster, solves a series of murders after finding the book in the bedroom of his house, when his wife relates the tale of the scissorman to their granddaughter. The murders were all done in the style of events in the book.

Brief references are made to the book in the film &quot;Woman in Gold&quot; (2015), when the central character reminisces about her youth in Vienna during the Anschluss.

&quot;The Office&quot; references the book in Season 2, Episode 18: &quot;Take Your Daughter to Work Day&quot; (2006). Dwight Schrute reads &quot;The story of Johnny head-in-the-air&quot; and &quot;The story of the thumb sucker&quot; to the children, but is interrupted by a horrified Michael Scott.

&quot;Family Guy&quot; references the &quot;Story of Little Suck-a-Thumb&quot; in a cutaway gag in &quot;Business Guy,&quot; the ninth episode in the eighth season, produced in 2009.

In &quot;Doctor Who&quot; Season 10 Episode 3 &quot;Thin Ice&quot; (2017), The Doctor reads part of &quot;The Story of the Thumb-Sucker&quot; to the children of 1814 London.

===Music===
German band Rammstein included the song &quot;Hilf Mir&quot; &quot;(Help Me)&quot; on their album &quot;Rosenrot&quot; (2005) 
It is about a child whose parents are not at home. She discovers matches and sets herself on fire and burns completely. 
In the story, the girl&#x27;s name is Pauline.

XTC were influenced by &quot;The Story of the Thumb-Sucker&quot; when they wrote &quot;Scissor Man&quot;. from 1979&#x27;s &quot;Drums and Wires&quot;.

The British post-punk band Shock Headed Peters, formed in 1982, took their name from the story.

American post-punk band Slovenly used the popular cover illustration of Struwwelpeter for the cover of their 1987 album, Riposte, on SST Records.

==References to health conditions==
The author, Heinrich Hoffmann, worked as a physician and later on as psychiatrist. Some of his stories describe habits of children, which can be in extreme forms signs of mental disorders. Attention deficit hyperactivity disorder is called Zappel-Philip-Syndrom (Fidgety-Philip syndrome) colloquially in Germany. The story of the Suppen-Kaspar (Soup-Kaspar) is a case example of anorexia nervosa. Uncombable hair syndrome is also called Struwwelpeter syndrome, after the book title.

<text>The Masoretes (, lit. &#x27;Masters of the Tradition&#x27;) were groups of Jewish scribe-scholars who worked from around the end of the 5th through 10th centuries CE, based primarily in the Jewish centers of the Levant (e.g., Tiberias and Jerusalem) and Mesopotamia (e.g., Sura and Nehardea). Each group compiled a system of pronunciation and grammatical guides in the form of diacritical notes (&quot;niqqud&quot;) on the external form of the biblical text in an attempt to standardize the pronunciation, paragraph and verse divisions, and cantillation of the Hebrew Bible (the Tanakh) for the worldwide Jewish community.

The ben Asher family of Masoretes was largely responsible for the preservation and production of the Masoretic Text, although there existed an alternative Masoretic text of the ben Naphtali Masoretes, which has around 875 differences from the ben Asher text. The halakhic authority Maimonides endorsed the ben Asher as superior, although the Egyptian Jewish scholar, the Saadya Gaon, had preferred the ben Naphtali system. It has been suggested that the ben Asher family and the majority of the Masoretes were Karaites. However, Geoffrey Khan believes that the ben Asher family was probably not Karaite, and Aron Dotan avers that there are &quot;decisive proofs that M. Ben-Asher was not a Karaite.&quot;

The Masoretes devised the vowel notation system for Hebrew that is still widely used, as well as the trope symbols used for cantillation.

The nakdanim were successors to the Masoretes in the transmission of the traditional Hebrew text of the Old Testament.

<doc id="362925" wikidata="Q1094989" url="?curid=362925" title="Clan Robertson">
<text>Clan Robertson, is correctly known as Clan Donnachaidh ( Duncan ) () () is a Scottish clan. The principal surnames of the clan are Robertson, Reid and Duncan but there are also many other septs.

==History==
===Origins===
There are two main theories as to the origins of the Clan:

#That the founder of the clan, Donn(a)chadh (Duncan) was the second son of Angus MacDonald, Lord of the Isles.
#That the Robertsons are lineal descendants of the Celtic Earls of Atholl, whose progenitor was King Duncan I (&quot;Donnchadh&quot; in Scottish Gaelic). The Collins &quot;Scottish Clan &amp; Family Encyclopedia&quot; supports this theory.

===Wars of Scottish Independence===

The clan&#x27;s first recognised chief, Donnchadh &quot;Reamhar&quot;, &quot;Stout Duncan&quot;, son of Andrew de Atholia (Latin &quot;Andrew of Atholl&quot;), was a minor land-owner and leader of a kin-group around Dunkeld, Highland Perthshire, and as legend has it, an enthusiastic and faithful supporter of Robert I (king 1306–29 aka Robert the Bruce) during the Wars of Scottish Independence; he is believed to have looked after King Robert after the Battle of Methven in 1306. The clan asserts that Stout Duncan&#x27;s relatives and followers (not yet known as Robertsons) supported Robert the Bruce at the Battle of Bannockburn in 1314. His descendants became known (in English or Scots) as the Duncansons, or Gaelic &quot;Clann Dhònnchaidh&quot;, &quot;Children of Duncan&quot;. Duncan is believed to have been killed at the Battle of Neville&#x27;s Cross and was succeeded by Robert, from whom the Clan Robertson takes its name. Robert&#x27;s brother, Patrick, was the ancestor of the Robertsons of Lude who were the principal cadet branch.

===14th- and 15th-century clan conflicts===

In 1394 a clan battle took place between Clann Dhònnchaidh, Clan Lindsay and involving Clan Ogilvy, who were the hereditary sheriffs of Angus, during a cattle raid on Angus. Sir Walter Ogilvy was slain at this battle. &quot;Clandonoquhy&quot; had rather a reputation as raiders and feuders in late medieval Scotland, though the chiefs seem always to have been loyal to the Bruce and Stewart royal dynasties.

Robert &quot;Riabhach&quot; (&quot;Grizzled&quot;) Duncanson, 4th Chief of Clann Dhònnchaidh, was a strong supporter of King James I (1406–1437) and was incensed by his murder at the Blackfriars Dominican Friary in Perth. He tracked down and captured two of the regicides, Sir Robert Graham and the King&#x27;s uncle Walter Stewart, Earl of Atholl, as they hid above Invervack in Atholl, and turned them over to the Crown. They were tortured to death in the Grassmarket in Edinburgh on the orders of the Regent, James I&#x27;s widow, Joan Beaufort (d. 1445). The Collins &quot;Scottish Clan &amp; Family Encyclopedia&quot; states that they were put to death with considerable savagery. The Robertson crest badge of a right hand upholding an imperial crown was awarded by James II (1437–60) to the 4th chief on 15 August 1451 as a reward for capturing his father&#x27;s assassins. The highly unusual third supporter (below the shield) on the Robertson coat of arms, of a &quot;savage man in chains&quot; is in reference to the capture of Graham. It is in honour of Robert &quot;Riabhach&quot; that his descendants took the name Robertson. James II also erected the clan lands into the Barony of Struan, which formerly took in extensive lands in Highland Perthshire, notably in Glen Errochty, the north and south banks of Loch Tay and the area surrounding Loch Rannoch. None of these lands are any longer in the possession of the clan.

Robert &quot;Riabhach&quot; or &quot;Riach&quot; died in 1460 from wounds received in battle. The chiefship then passed to his eldest son, Alexander. The Clan Robertson then feuded with the Clan Stewart of Atholl. William Robertson, the sixth chief was killed trying to recover lands that had been seized by the Stewarts of Atholl. The eighth chief of Clan Robertson was murdered and his brother inherited the estate.

Struan (Gaelic &quot;Sruthan&quot;, &quot;streams&quot;), is a parish church, of early Christian origin and dedicated to St. Fillan, at the confluence of the Errochty Water and Garry rivers. Many of the medieval chiefs were buried in this church (although individual monuments have unfortunately not survived). The present building was built in the early 19th century, but the foundations of its predecessor can be traced in the churchyard. Donnchadh &quot;Reamhar&quot; is, however, said to have been buried in the parish church of Dull, near Aberfeldy. Recent excavations by members of the Clan Donnachaidh Society within the now redundant church of Dull (Gaelic &quot;Dul&quot;, &quot;meadow&quot;, &quot;haugh&quot;) failed to find evidence of this specific burial, although others were uncovered, along with early medieval carved stones. Recent generations of chiefs have been buried in a family vault in the grounds of the estate of Dunalastair, near Kinloch Rannoch.

===17th century and Civil War===

Under Alexander Robertson, 12th chief, the clan is said to have supported Montrose in all of his battles during the Scottish Civil War. During this time, the main Robertson castle at Invervack, near the present Clan museum, was burned by Cromwell&#x27;s forces, and many family records were lost. The Clan Robertson played a major part in the fighting at the Battle of Inverlochy (1645) in support of the royalist, James Graham, 1st Marquis of Montrose, where they put the king&#x27;s enemies to flight. Alexander Robertson of Lude fought for Charles I of Scotland at the Battle of Tippermuir and as a result Lude was burned by Cromwell&#x27;s forces in retaliation.

Alexander Robertson, 13th chief (b. 1668) joined the Jacobite rising of 1689 and was taken prisoner a few weeks after the Jacobite defeat at the Battle of Dunkeld. After being released he went to live in France for thirteen years where he served for some time in the French army. He returned to Scotland in 1703.

===18th century and Jacobite uprisings===

Alexander Robertson, 13th chief, led 500 men of Clan Robertson in support of the Earl of Mar at the Battle of Sheriffmuir in 1715. He was captured, but later rescued and he took refuge in France. General Wade&#x27;s report on the Highlands in 1724, estimated the clan strength at 800 men. The fighting force of Clan Donnachaidh was estimated at 700 men in 1745.

After the defeat of the Jacobite rising of 1745 the Robertson lands became part of the Forfeited Estates, although most were returned to the then chief, another Alexander Robertson, in 1784, after it became clear that the Central Highlands were wholly pacified.

Two of the most notorious and well documented Highland Clearances occurred on the Robertson clan land of Strathcarron:
# In 1845, the Glencalvie or Croick clearance, executed by the factor James Gillander on behalf of William Robertson, sixth laird of Kindeace.
# In 1854, the Greenyards clearance, sometimes known as the Massacre of the Rosses. This was also carried out by James Gillander on behalf of Major Charles Robertson—son of William.

The Clearances upon the Clan Robertson lands are also important to the history of Scottish Gaelic literature

In Sutherland, Eòghainn MacDhonnchaidh (Ewan Robertson, (1842–1895) of Tongue was called &quot;the Bard of the Clearances&quot;; is most famous for his song &quot;Mo mhallachd aig na caoraich mhòr&quot; (&quot;My curses upon the big [Blackface and/or Cheviot, introduced from England] sheep&quot;) mocking, among others, the Duchess of Sutherland and Patrick Sellar. The song has been recorded by notable singers Julie Fowlis and Kathleen MacInnes. There is a monument to Robertson in Tongue.

A similar poem in Canadian Gaelic attacks James Gillanders of Highfield Cottage near Dingwall, who was the Factor for the estate of Major Charles Robertson of Kincardine. As his employer was then serving with the British Army in Australia, Gillanders was the person most responsible for the mass evictions staged at Glencalvie, Ross-shire in 1845. The Gaelic-language poem denouncing Gillanders for the brutality of the evictions was later submitted anonymously to Pàdraig MacNeacail, the editor of the column in Gaelic in which the poem was published in the Antigonish, Nova Scotia newspaper &quot;The Casket&quot;. The poem, which is believed to draw upon eyewitness accounts, is believed to be the only Gaelic language source relating to the evictions in Glencalvie.

Only the family vault at Dunalastair is still in the possession of the family of Struan; however, many modern properties have been added to the clan land. The title Baron of Struan is still transferred through Dunalastair.

==Clan castles==

*Mount Alexander was one of among the original seats of the chiefs of Clan Robertson. The castle was eventually replaced by Dall House. Despite common misconception, the present ruin of Dunalistair on the site is nothing to do with the clan, but was built in 1859 
*The original seat was at Invervack, and was lost in the Civil war
*Lude Castle belonged to the Clan Robertson from at least the 17th century but was torched by the forces of Oliver Cromwell in 1650 after Alexander Robertson of Lude had fought on the side of James Graham, 1st Marquess of Montrose at the Battle of Tippermuir in 1644.
*Auchleeks Castle was held by the Clan Robertson from the 1530s but was later replaced by a mansion. They sold the property in 1962 and the garden is occasionally open to the public.
*Eilean nam Faoilaig, near Kinloch Rannoch, Perthshire, is the site of a castle on an island that was held by the Robertsons of Struan and was used as both a refuge and a prison.

* &quot;MacDhònnchaidh&quot; (surname, &#x27;son of Duncan&#x27;)
* &quot;MacRaibeirt&quot; (surname, &#x27;son of Robert&#x27;)
* &quot;Robasdan&quot; (surname – used when following a first name)
* &quot;An Robasdanach&quot; (surname, &#x27;the Robertson&#x27; – used on its own, without a first name)
* &quot;Clann MhicDhònnchaidh / Clann &#x27;IcDhònnchaidh&quot; (collective – &#x27;Clan Robertson&#x27;)
* &quot;Clann Dhònnchaidh&quot; (collective)
* &quot;Na Robasdanaich&quot; (collective) – the Robertsons as a whole.

Note: the common spelling often appears with an &quot;a&quot; after the double nn of &quot;Dhònnchaidh&quot;, but this is not correct (though it does reflect the Gaelic insertion of an epenthetic vowel in pronunciation). &quot;Cf.&quot; the anglicised surname MacConnochie (and variants). &quot;MacDhònnchaidh&quot; and derivatives are usually used on the mainland, &quot;Robasdan&quot; and derivatives on the islands.

<doc id="362927" wikidata="Q596201" url="?curid=362927" title="Journeyman (album)">
<text>Journeyman is the eleventh solo studio album by Eric Clapton. Heralded as a return to form for Clapton, who had struggled with alcohol addiction and recently found sobriety, the album has a 1980s electronic sound, but it also includes blues songs like &quot;Before You Accuse Me&quot;, &quot;Running on Faith&quot;, and &quot;Hard Times.&quot; &quot;Bad Love&quot; was released as a single, reaching the No. 1 position on the Album Rock Chart in the United States, and being awarded a Grammy Award for Best Male Rock Vocal Performance in 1990. &quot;Pretending&quot; had also reached the No. 1 position on the Album Rock Chart the previous year, remaining at the top for five weeks (&quot;Bad Love&quot; had only stayed for three weeks).

The album reached number 2 on the UK Albums Chart and 16 on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 chart, and it went on to become double platinum in the US. Clapton has said &quot;Journeyman&quot; is one of his favourite albums.

== Critical reception ==

Reviewing in December 1989 for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau gave the album a B-minus and wrote of Clapton, &quot;What did you expect him to call it – &quot;Hack&quot;? &quot;Layla&quot; and &quot;461 Ocean Boulevard&quot; were clearly flukes: he has no record-making knack. So he farms out the songs, sings them competently enough, and marks them with his guitar. Which sounds kind of like Mark Knopfler&#x27;s.&quot; In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine praised the album for its &quot;convincing&quot; vocals and &quot;consistently strong&quot; songwriting.

<doc id="362930" wikidata="Q408916" url="?curid=362930" title="Diacetyl">
<text>Diacetyl ( ; IUPAC systematic name: butanedione or butane-2,3-dione) is an organic compound with the chemical formula (CH3CO)2. It is a yellow liquid with an intensely buttery flavor. It is a vicinal diketone (two C=O groups, side-by-side). Diacetyl occurs naturally in alcoholic beverages and some cheeses and is added as a flavoring to some foods to impart its buttery flavor. Chronic inhalation exposure to diacetyl fumes is a causative agent of the lung disease bronchiolitis obliterans, commonly known as &quot;popcorn lung&quot;.

==Chemical structure==
A distinctive feature of diacetyl (and other vicinal diketones) is the long C–C bond linking the carbonyl centers. This bond distance is about 1.54 Å, compared to 1.45 Å for the corresponding C–C bond in 1,3-butadiene. The elongation is attributed to repulsion between the polarized carbonyl carbon centers.

==Occurrence and biosynthesis==
Diacetyl arises naturally as a byproduct of fermentation. In some fermentative bacteria, it is formed via the thiamine pyrophosphate-mediated condensation of pyruvate and acetyl CoA. Sour (cultured) cream, cultured buttermilk, and cultured butter are produced by inoculating pasteurized cream or milk with a lactic starter culture, churning (agitating) and holding the milk until a desired pH drop (or increase in acidity) is attained. Cultured cream, cultured butter, and cultured buttermilk owe their tart flavour to lactic acid bacteria and their buttery aroma and taste to diacetyl. Malic acid can be converted to lactic acid to make diacetyl.

==Production==
Diacetyl is produced industrially by dehydrogenation of 2,3-butanediol. Acetoin is an intermediate.

==Applications==
===In food products===
Diacetyl and acetoin are two compounds that give butter its characteristic taste. Because of this, manufacturers of artificial butter flavoring, margarines or similar oil-based products typically add diacetyl and acetoin (along with beta-carotene for the yellow color) to make the final product butter-flavored, because it would otherwise be relatively tasteless.

===Electronic cigarettes===
Diacetyl is used as a flavoring agent in some liquids used in electronic cigarettes. People nearby may be exposed to it in the exhaled aerosol at levels near the limit set for occupational exposure.

===In alcoholic beverages===

In some styles of beer (e.g. in many beer styles produced in the United Kingdom, such as stouts, English bitters, and Scottish ales), the presence of diacetyl can be acceptable or desirable at low or, in some cases, moderate levels. In other styles, its presence is considered a flaw or undesirable.

Diacetyl is produced during fermentation as a byproduct of valine synthesis, when yeast produces α-acetolactate, which escapes the cell and is spontaneously decarboxylated into diacetyl. The yeast then absorbs the diacetyl, and reduces the ketone groups to form acetoin and 2,3-butanediol.

Beer sometimes undergoes a &quot;diacetyl rest&quot;, in which its temperature is raised slightly for two or three days after fermentation is complete, to allow the yeast to absorb the diacetyl it produced earlier in the fermentation cycle. The makers of some wines, such as chardonnay, deliberately promote the production of diacetyl because of the feel and flavor it imparts. Diacetyl is present in some chardonnays known as &quot;butter bombs&quot;, although there is a trend back toward the more traditional French styles.

Concentrations from 0.005 mg/L to 1.7 mg/L were measured in chardonnay wines, and the amount needed for the flavor to be noticed is at least 0.2 mg/L.

==Use as butter flavoring==

===Butter-flavoring controversy===
Chronic industrial exposure to diacetyl fumes, such as in the microwave popcorn production industry, has been associated with bronchiolitis obliterans, a rare and life-threatening form of non-reversible obstructive lung disease in which the bronchioles (small airway branches) are compressed and narrowed by fibrosis (scar tissue) and/or inflammation.

===Regulation===
The European Commission has declared diacetyl is legal for use as a flavouring substance in all EU states. As a diketone, diacetyl is included in the EU&#x27;s flavouring classification Flavouring Group Evaluation 11 (FGE.11). A Scientific Panel of the EU Commission evaluated six flavouring substances (not including diacetyl) from FGE.11 in 2004. As part of this study, the panel reviewed available studies on several other flavourings in FGE.11, including diacetyl. Based on the available data, the panel reiterated the finding that there were no safety concerns for diacetyl&#x27;s use as a flavouring.

In 2007, the European Food Safety Authority (EFSA), the EU&#x27;s food safety regulatory body, stated its scientific panel on food additives and flavourings (AFC) was evaluating diacetyl along with other flavourings as part of a larger study.

In 2007, the Flavor and Extract Manufacturers Association recommended reducing diacetyl in butter flavorings. Manufacturers of butter flavored popcorn including Pop Weaver, Trail&#x27;s End, and ConAgra Foods (maker of Orville Redenbacher&#x27;s and Act II) began removing diacetyl as an ingredient from their products.

A 2010 U.S. OSHA Safety and Health Information Bulletin and companion Worker Alert recommend employers use safety measures to minimize exposure to diacetyl or its substitutes.

In 2016, diacetyl was banned in e-liquids/e-cigarettes in the EU under the EU Tobacco Products Directive.

<doc id="362937" wikidata="Q971557" url="?curid=362937" title="From the Cradle">
<text>From the Cradle is the twelfth solo studio album by Eric Clapton, released on 12 September 1994 by Warner Bros. Records. A blues cover album and Clapton&#x27;s follow-up to his successful 1992 live album, &quot;Unplugged,&quot; it is his only UK number-one album to date.

Although he had long been associated with the blues, &quot;From the Cradle&quot; was Clapton&#x27;s first attempt at an all-blues album. He would subsequently record &quot;Riding with the King&quot; with B. B. King; a tribute to Robert Johnson, &quot;Me and Mr. Johnson&quot;; and a collaboration with J. J. Cale, &quot;The Road to Escondido&quot;.

==Title==
The title comes from the last line of a four-line poem written by Clapton (and which he never set to music) and printed in his own handwriting on the second page of the CD booklet: &quot;All along this path I tread / My heart betrays my weary head / with nothing but my love to save / from the cradle to the grave.&quot;

== Critical reception ==
&quot;From the Cradle&quot; has prompted a wide range of critical response. Stephen Thomas Erlewine of AllMusic feels that the album is almost perfect, with Clapton&#x27;s guitar soloing &quot;original and captivating&quot;. The weakness for him is Clapton&#x27;s singing, which attempts to merely imitate the original singers, but is laboured or overly emotive, and falls short of the originals. Tom Sinclair of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; felt that the recordings were &quot;flawlessly faithful&quot; but rather boring, especially compared with the inspiration evident in Cream&#x27;s live version of &quot;Spoonful&quot;. &quot;The Music Box&quot;&#x27;s John Metzger felt that Clapton&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; to promote the record was more powerful than the album itself, which was a &quot;perfunctory&quot; performance lacking any originality. Robert Christgau compared Eric Clapton&#x27;s work on the album to Son Seals and Otis Rush, saying that Clapton played better than the former, but sang worse than the latter and felt that &quot;Motherless Child&quot; and &quot;Blues Before Sunrise&quot; were stand-out tracks on the album.

According to the liner notes, the album was almost entirely recorded live in the studio with no overdubs or edits, the only overdubs being featured on &quot;How Long Blues&quot; (dobro) and &quot;Motherless Child&quot; (drums).

The album won Clapton the 1995 Grammy Award for Best Traditional Blues Album and he received a further nomination for Album of the Year.

In July 2014, &quot;Guitar World&quot; placed &quot;From the Cradle&quot; on their list &quot;Superunknown: 50 Iconic Albums That Defined 1994&quot;.

<text>Gemini 7 (officially Gemini VII) was a 1965 crewed spaceflight in NASA&#x27;s Gemini program. It was the fourth crewed Gemini flight, the twelfth crewed American spaceflight, and the twentieth crewed spaceflight including Soviet flights and X-15 flights above the Kármán line. The crew of Frank Borman and Jim Lovell spent nearly 14 days in space, making a total of 206 orbits. Their spacecraft was the passive target for the first crewed space rendezvous performed by the crew of Gemini 6A.

==Objectives==

Gemini 7 was originally intended to fly after Gemini 6, but the original Gemini 6 mission was cancelled after the failure during launch of the Agena Target Vehicle with which it was meant to rendezvous and dock. The objective of rendezvous was so important, that it was decided to fly the alternate Gemini 6A mission concurrently with Gemini 7, using the latter as the rendezvous target.

This 14-day mission required NASA to solve some of the problems of long-duration space flight, such as stowage of waste (the crew had practiced stuffing waste paper behind their seats before the flight). Timing their workday to match that of the prime shift ground crews, both men worked and slept at the same time. Gemini 7 conducted twenty experiments, the most of any Gemini mission, including studies of nutrition in space. The astronauts also evaluated a lightweight spacesuit, the G5C, which proved uncomfortable when worn for a long time in the Gemini spacecraft&#x27;s hot, cramped quarters. The high point of the mission came on the eleventh day with the rendezvous with Gemini 6A.

Both astronauts, heeding the advice of Pete Conrad who had flown for eight days on Gemini 5, took books along to read. Gemini 7 held the record for the longest space flight until Soyuz 9 in June 1970, and was the longest crewed space flight in U.S. history until the Skylab 2 mission of May and June 1973.

==Flight==
Launch went without any problems and all systems on the Titan II performed nominally. Some slight pogo vibrations were detected starting at T+110 seconds into launch, but unlike with Gemini 5 where the astronauts experienced momentary vision and speech problems, Borman reported only feeling a very light shaking sensation and Lovell nothing. After separating from the spent rocket stage, they turned the spacecraft around and proceeded to station keep with the rocket stage, a maneuver first tried on Gemini 4. The Gemini 4 attempt was unsuccessful, due to the limited knowledge at the time of the complex orbital mechanics involved. Gemini 7 flew in formation with its upper stage for fifteen minutes, at which time Borman stopped because he felt too much fuel was being consumed, and the stage was moving erratically as it vented its own remaining fuel.

They spent the rest of their first day in space doing some experiments and eating their first meal. Their sleep periods were scheduled at the same time unlike previous missions and they were able to get some sleep. The next morning they were awoken at 9:06 am EST and given the morning&#x27;s news, which included the collision of two airliners over New York. For the first time during a flight, one of the crew was allowed to take off his suit. Borman and Lovell had planned to both take them off two days into the mission, when they were satisfied that the environmental system was working properly. The NASA managers did not like this idea, and said that at least one crew member had to be wearing a suit at all times. Borman wore his suit and sweated profusely, but agreed to let Lovell stay out of his suit, as Lovell was the larger of the two, and it required a lot of effort to get in and out of a suit in little more space than the front seat of a car.

Later, the flight controllers ordered Lovell to don his suit, and Borman to get out of his. This was because the doctors wanted to see the effects of being suited and unsuited on the astronauts. At 148 hours into the flight, Borman got his chance to cool down. Finally, the NASA managers decided that there was little benefit in having the crew members suited, and so relented after a couple of days. Going suitless greatly improved the astronauts&#x27; comfort and mobility inside the cramped spacecraft.

The lessons learned from Gemini 5 allowed Lovell and Borman to have improved personal hygiene during their mission. They showered with an anti-dandruff shampoo for two weeks prior to the flight to curb the problems their predecessors had experienced with skin flakes accumulating inside the spacecraft and removal of the pressure suits in-flight also helped keep their skin more moist and less prone to drying out. They were also supplied with sanitation wipes which proved highly beneficial in keeping clean. Odors were not a problem except when they opened the storage bins where waste was stowed.

In their postflight debriefing, Borman and Lovell noted that the food rations had been generally of good quality, but they strongly disliked the freeze-dried protein bites and advised against them being included on future missions. They also suggested that more breakfast items would have been nice, to avoid including bite-sized food that could easily produce crumbs that get loose in the cabin, and improving the packaging of some items. Because of the lengthy mission, Gemini 7 had a significantly larger supply of food than previous flights, and the astronauts often found it difficult to remove the tightly packed food containers, some of which had also not been stowed in the correct order for the day of the flight they were intended to be eaten.

As part of the in-flight medical experiments, the crew were required to collect and save some of their bodily wastes for post-flight analysis, a task they described as less-than-enjoyable. The urine collection device proved particularly difficult and unpleasant to use, especially because of its habit of leaking urine, which happened several times during the flight. Borman suggested afterwards that a tube and valve mechanism be added to the spacecraft to simply release urine into space, an idea that would be realized on the Apollo command module.

The crew also strongly objected to the requirement that they record every use of drinking water and argued instead that they could simply use the meter on the water hose to gauge the amount consumed.

After five days, they had performed four orbital adjustment burns that put them in a circular orbit. This orbit would last for at least 100 days without decaying, more than stable enough for the passive target during a space rendezvous.

On their 31st orbit, Gemini 7 observed the underwater launch and exhaust trail of a Polaris missile from the submarine off Florida.

===Rendezvous===

Gemini 6A was launched on December 15, after a three-day-long delay due to a malfunction and engine shutdown immediately after ignition. It entered into an orbit, and was briefly visible from Gemini 7 just after launch. Borman and Lovell were also able to see the contrail from the launch.

The plan called for the rendezvous to take place on the fourth orbit of Gemini 6A. Their first burn came 94 minutes after launch when they increased their velocity by . Due to their lower orbit they were gaining on Gemini 7 and were behind. The next burn was at 2 hours and 18 minutes when Gemini 6A made a phase adjustment to put them on the same orbital inclination as Gemini 7. They now only trailed by .

The radar on Gemini 6A first made contact with Gemini 7 at 3 hours and 15 minutes when they were away. A third burn put them into a orbit. As they slowly gained, Walter Schirra put Gemini 6A&#x27;s computer in charge of the rendezvous, and at five hours and four minutes, he saw a bright object that he at first thought was the star Sirius, but was in fact Gemini 7.

After several more burns the two spacecraft were only apart. The burns had only used of fuel on Gemini 6A, leaving plenty of fuel. During the next 270 minutes the crews moved as close as , talking over the radio. At one stage the spacecraft were station-keeping so well that neither crew had to make any burns for 20 minutes.

As the sleep periods approached, Gemini 6A made a separation burn and slowly drifted out to 16 kilometers, to prevent an accidental collision in the night. Gemini 6A reentered the next day, landing within of the planned site, the first truly accurate atmospheric reentry.

===Last few days===

By this time, the novelty of spaceflight had worn off for the crew of Gemini 7. They had spent 11 days in space and had three more to go. They were doing little more than drifting around the Earth and the incentive of the rendezvous was over. Borman read &quot;Roughing It&quot; by Mark Twain and Lovell &quot;Drums along the Mohawk&quot; by Walter D. Edmonds.

In the Discovery Channel 2008 documentary &quot;When We Left Earth: The NASA Missions&quot; second episode titled &quot;Friends and Rivals&quot;, Borman states the last three days of the mission were &quot;bad&quot;.

Malfunctions began: in a repeat of Gemini 5, some of the thrusters stopped working. After the flight this was traced to the fact that they had an old type of laminate in the thrust chamber. Also on the 12th day, the fuel cells started to give only a partial amount of power. The ship&#x27;s batteries were enough to sustain it for the remainder of the flight.

Finally the last day of the mission arrived and the crew stored everything for reentry. The retro-rockets worked perfectly after 14 days in space. They landed within of the targeted landing point.

The crewmen were somewhat weakened by their time in space, but both were in good health and were up and about after a good night&#x27;s sleep on the recovery ship . They were also in good spirits: during recovery, they joked to Mission Control about getting married after having spent so long together in space.

The Gemini 7 and 6A missions were supported by the following U.S. Department of Defense resources: 10,125 personnel, 125 aircraft and 16 ships.

==Insignia==

The patch features an Olympic torch, symbolizing the marathon-like length of the mission. There is a small stylized image of a Gemini spacecraft and the Roman numeral VII for seven. The crew did not put its names on the patch, although souvenir versions did include the flight and crew names. The crew patch was designed by Houston artist and animator Bill Bradley.

As with a few other missions, the backup crew produced a spoof of the insignia, featuring an unlit torch, a lighter and the words &quot;NEED A LIGHT - FRANK? JIM?&quot;

==Spacecraft location==
The spacecraft is on display at the National Air and Space Museum, Washington, D.C.

<doc id="362945" wikidata="Q7450670" url="?curid=362945" title="Senior counsel">
<text>The title of senior counsel or state counsel (post-nominal letters: SC) or senior advocate is given to a senior lawyer in some countries that were formerly part of the British Empire. &quot;Senior Counsel&quot; is used in current or former Commonwealth countries or jurisdictions that have chosen to change the title &quot;King&#x27;s Counsel&quot; to a name without monarchical connotations, usually related to the British monarch that is no longer head of state, such that reference to the King is no longer appropriate. Examples of jurisdictions that have made the change because of the latter reason include Mauritius, Zambia, India (senior advocate), Bangladesh, Hong Kong, Ireland, South Africa, Kenya, Malawi, Singapore, Guyana and Trinidad and Tobago. Jurisdictions that have retained the monarch as head of state, but have nonetheless opted for the new title include some states and territories of Australia, as well as Belize.

Just as a junior counsel is &quot;called to the [Outer] Bar&quot;, a Senior Counsel is, in some jurisdictions, said to be &quot;called to the Inner Bar&quot;. Senior Counsel may informally style themselves as &quot;silks&quot;, like their British counterparts. This is the case in Ireland, Australia, Hong Kong, and South Africa.

== Dress ==
In Hong Kong, every Senior Counsel must wear a black robe and silk gown together with a wig when appearing in open court. In Ireland, Senior Counsel wear a silk gown which differs from that of a Junior Counsel; the wig is optional.

== Australia ==

The rank of Senior Counsel has also been introduced in most states and territories of Australia, even though the King remains head of state. Between 1993 and 2008 all Australian jurisdictions except the Northern Territory replaced the title of Queen&#x27;s Counsel with that of Senior Counsel. However, in 2013 Queensland restored the rank of Queen&#x27;s Counsel and there was talk of other Australian states following suit. On 3 February 2014, the Victorian Attorney-General announced that the rank of Queen&#x27;s Counsel would shortly be reinstated in the State of Victoria, with existing and future Senior Counsel having the option to apply to be issued with letters patent appointing them as Queen&#x27;s Counsel; some 89% of barristers entitled to be called Senior Counsel were reported to have applied for letters patent to become Queen&#x27;s Counsel.
On 18 February 2019, the South Australian Government restored the rank of Queen&#x27;s Counsel.

The formal difference appears to be that KCs receive a warrant signed by the relevant state governor, who is the formal viceregal representative of the sovereign in the Australian states, whereas SCs receive a certificate issued by the relevant bar association or bureaucracy such as by the judicature of the state supreme court as the case may be.

== Barbados ==

The title of Senior Counsel has replaced that of Queen&#x27;s Counsel in Barbados, which became a republic on 30 November 2021.

Those who were appointed as Q.C. are now free to change their postnominal letters to K.C., due to the death of Queen Elizabeth II and the accession of King Charles III to the British throne. They are not required to become S.C.s. For example, Dame Sandra Mason, who was appointed as Q.C. is now free to change to K.C., even though she is the first President of Barbados.

All new appointments will be as S.C. only.

== Belize ==

Senior Counsel is appointed in Belize, even though King Charles III is King of Belize.

== Hong Kong ==

&quot;Senior Counsel&quot; () replaced QC in the law of Hong Kong after the transfer of sovereignty over Hong Kong from the United Kingdom to China in 1997. King&#x27;s Counsel who had been appointed KC in Hong Kong or British King&#x27;s Counsel who had been admitted to practice in Hong Kong generally prior to the handover became senior counsel automatically.

King&#x27;s Counsel from England or other senior counsel from other jurisdictions is not accorded any precedence if they are admitted generally in Hong Kong. However, visiting King&#x27;s Counsel from another jurisdiction who have been admitted for a specific case are entitled to use the title, and to be accorded the status, of Senior Counsel for the purposes of those proceedings.

===Bangladesh===



== India ==

A member of the bar could be designated as a Senior Advocate upon a selection process that employs various criteria for designation. The said designation happens by the Supreme Court directly, or through the concerned state High Court. In August 2018 the Supreme Court issued guidelines to regulate the conferment of designation of Senior Advocate. Senior advocates&#x27; gowns have a flap at the back to distinguish them from junior counsels.

== Ireland ==

The Irish Free State came into existence in December 1922 as a dominion within the British Commonwealth of Nations. John O&#x27;Byrne was the sole King&#x27;s Counsel (KC) appointed after independence, in June 1924 when he was Attorney General of Ireland. Shortly after the Courts of Justice Act 1924 came into effect, Chief Justice Hugh Kennedy, in conjunction with the Bar Council of Ireland, revived the issue of patents of precedence, which had been used in the 18th and 19th century as an alternative to a patent as KC, but had fallen into disuse from 1883 as the strictures formerly associated with the rank of KC were abolished. The Irish Free State patent wording was based on that issued to Daniel O&#x27;Connell; the recipient would be styled &quot;Senior Counsel&quot; (SC; Irish or ). According to the view held at the time, the &quot;privilege of patent&quot; was part of the royal prerogative within the Free State. The early patents were issued under the Free State&#x27;s [internal] Great Seal by the Governor-General as the King&#x27;s representative, on the advice of the Executive Council (government). On 14 July 1924 the Chief Justice called the first recipients to the &quot;within the bar&quot; and bestowed their patents. The form of the 1924 patent omitted the appointment as &quot;one of our counsel learned in the law&quot; from the KC patent, but retained its grant of &quot;precedence and preaudience&quot; to rank next after the previously appointed KC or SC. The Constitution (Amendment No. 27) Act 1936 abolished the office of Governor-General and the Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act 1937 was held to have transferred the royal prerogative to the Executive Council (government). Although the 1937 Constitution of Ireland created the office of President of Ireland, it was still the Taoiseach as head of government who signed patents of precedence under the Executive Powers (Consequential Provisions) Act 1937.

The title &quot;K.C.&quot; continued to be used by many Senior Counsel, both those created before July 1924 and those after. Sir John L. Esmonde complained that wartime censors had changed &quot;K.C.&quot; to &quot;S.C.&quot; in a press release about a 1943 election candidate; they regarded &quot;K.C.&quot; as pro-British and thus violating Irish neutrality. In 1949, shortly before the coming into force of the Republic of Ireland Act 1948, which created the Republic of Ireland and broke the final link with the British Crown, Frank Aiken asked John A. Costello during Taoiseach&#x27;s questions &quot;whether, in view of the fact that certain members of the Inner Bar who received their patents as senior counsel continue to describe themselves as king&#x27;s counsel, he will introduce a bill entitled an act to declare that the description of a senior counsel shall be senior counsel&quot;; Costello said he had &quot;no intention of wasting public time and money&quot; on the idea. As late as the 1960s, R.G.L. Leonard (made KC before 1922) was described in the official Irish law reports as &quot;Queen&#x27;s Counsel&quot;, reflecting the British change from King to Queen in 1952.

The Legal Services Regulation Act 2015 provides for the Legal Services Regulatory Authority (LSRA) to establish an Advisory Committee on the grant of Patents of Precedence. The committee comprises the Chief Justice, the Presidents of the Court of Appeal and High Court, the Attorney General, heads of the Bar Council and Law Society of Ireland, and a lay member appointed by the Minister for Justice. The relevant part of the 2015 act was commenced in 2019. It allows the bestowal of the title &quot;Senior Counsel&quot; on solicitors. The LSRA advisory committee replaces an earlier advisory committee which had no statutory basis, and no solicitor or lay member. The 2015 Act also specifies the criteria for both solicitors and barristers:
:(a) has, in his or her practice as a legal practitioner, displayed—
::(i) a degree of competence and a degree of probity appropriate to and consistent with the grant to him or her of a Patent,
::(ii) professional independence, and
::(iii) one or more of the following:
:::(I) a proven capacity for excellence in the practice of advocacy;
:::(II) a proven capacity for excellence in the practice of specialist litigation; or
:::(III) specialist knowledge of an area of law;
:(b) is suitable on grounds of character and temperament;
:(c) is in possession of a tax clearance certificate that is in force;
:(d) is otherwise suitable to be granted a Patent.

It is still the government which grants the patent of privilege and the Chief Justice of Ireland who calls patentees to the Inner Bar. , there were about 325 SCs among about 2,300 barristers registered with the Bar Council of Ireland. On 1 September 2020 the cabinet approved the first batch of 37 recommendations of the LSRA advisory committee. These were appointed senior counsel the following day, including the first 17 (out of 60 applicants) solicitors.

In Northern Ireland, the designation King&#x27;s Counsel (KC) or Queen&#x27;s Counsel (QC) has continued since 1921, as in the rest of the United Kingdom. In 1983 Richard Ferguson, former head of the Northern Ireland bar, was called to the Inner Bar in Dublin, becoming the first to be simultaneously QC and SC. Conversely, the first SC to become QC was Paddy MacEntee in 1985.

== New Zealand ==
The title &quot;Senior Counsel&quot; was briefly established in New Zealand from 2007 until 2009. It was abolished by the following government in favour of restoring the title of Queen&#x27;s Counsel on the basis of the respect felt accorded to those appointed Queen&#x27;s Counsel. Those appointed as Senior Counsel were given the option of becoming Queen&#x27;s Counsel or remaining as Senior Counsel.

== Singapore ==
&quot;Senior Counsel&quot; is used in the law of Singapore. There is no independent bar in Singapore and senior counsel practice as members of law firms. Prior to independence, select members were given the title of King&#x27;s Counsel or Queen&#x27;s Counsel.

== South Africa ==

&quot;Senior Counsel&quot; (in Afrikaans &quot;Senior Advokaat&quot;) replaced QC in South Africa after the Union became a republic on 31 May 1961, with appointments being made by the state president until 1994, when the office was succeeded by that of president. A judge in the High Court in the province of Gauteng ruled that under the 1993 constitution, the president did not have the power to grant Senior Counsel status. This judgment has been overturned by the Supreme Court of Appeal and also the Constitutional Court. See .

== United Kingdom ==

In the United Kingdom, the position of senior counsel (lowercase) is used to denote an experienced solicitor (who need not be an advocate), who is not on the path to partnership. This position is therefore analogous to the American title of counsel and is not directly comparable to the position of King&#x27;s Counsel/Senior Counsel, which is held by barristers.

== Similar titles ==

Other jurisdictions have adopted similar titles:

* Senior Advocate under the law of Bangladesh, law of Pakistan, and that of Nigeria (see Senior Advocate of Nigeria).
*President&#x27;s Counsel in Sri Lanka. In contrast, state counsels are the public prosecutors in the legal system of Sri Lanka.

<text>Britt Allcroft (born Hilary Mary Allcroft Coote; 14 December 1943 – 25 December 2024) was an English screenwriter, producer, director, and voice actress. She adapted Wilbert Awdry&#x27;s &quot;The Railway Series&quot; in the form of the children&#x27;s television series &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends&quot; (later re-titled &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot;). She created &quot;Shining Time Station&quot; (with Rick Siggelkow), &quot;Mr. Conductor&#x27;s Thomas Tales&quot;, and &quot;Magic Adventures of Mumfie&quot;. She also wrote, co-produced, and directed the film &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot; (2000).

==Early life==
Allcroft was born Hilary Mary Allcroft Coote in Worthing, West Sussex, on 14 December 1943. Allcroft was raised in a modest household without a car or television during her early years. Growing up, she shared her home with an aunt who often recounted stories of her daily train commutes to London, igniting Allcroft&#x27;s love for trains. 

Allcroft had several stories published in a magazine when she was 15. At the age of 16, she left school and changed her first name to Britt as her career in British radio and television gained momentum. She went on to create a succession of programmes for the BBC and ITV during the 1970s and 1980s, including &quot;Moon Clue Game&quot;, &quot;Dance Crazy&quot; and &quot;Keepsakes&quot;. &quot;Mothers By Daughters&quot;, produced for Channel 4, was broadcast by PBS in the United States. She also worked in theatre, staging shows at the London Palladium and Drury Lane Theatres.

==Career==
While making a documentary about British steam locomotives in August 1979, Allcroft met the Reverend Wilbert Awdry, author of the children&#x27;s book series &quot;The Railway Series&quot;. She said &quot;it really didn&#x27;t take me long to become intrigued by the characters, the relationships between them and the nostalgia they invoked.&quot; She told him that she wanted to bring these stories to life and made an arrangement to secure certain rights through his then-publishers Kaye &amp; Ward.

In 1980, she co-founded Britt Allcroft Railway Productions (later known as The Britt Allcroft Company) with her husband, television producer Angus Wright. It took Allcroft four years to raise the funding for, and create, a first series of 26 episodes in collaboration with director David Mitton. The first two episodes of &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends&quot; were aired together for the first time on British television on 9 October 1984, with narration by Ringo Starr and music by Mike O&#x27;Donnell and Junior Campbell.

The success of the series in the UK, and the merchandising campaign that Allcroft had been organising since 1983, soon led to further success in other parts of the world. In 1989, she and American producer Rick Siggelkow created &quot;Shining Time Station&quot;, a live-action children&#x27;s sitcom fronted by the magical character of the miniature Mr. Conductor, who introduced two &quot;Thomas&quot; stories in each half-hour programme. &quot;Shining Time Station&quot; won a number of awards and significantly increased the popularity of the &quot;Thomas&quot; media franchise in the US. &quot;Shining Time Station&quot; lasted until 1995 and, in 1996, she created the short spin-off series &quot;Mr. Conductor&#x27;s Thomas Tales&quot;.

In 1994, Allcroft followed &quot;Thomas the Tank Engine &amp; Friends&quot; and &quot;Shining Time Station&quot; with the cartoon-animated &quot;Magic Adventures of Mumfie&quot;, in collaboration with director John Collins. Inspired by the books by Katharine Tozer, the production received critical acclaim and was seen worldwide. In 2008, several years after she left her original company, Allcroft revived the &quot;Mumfie&quot; library, and a reboot series eventually aired in 2021.

Allcroft wrote and directed &quot;Thomas and the Magic Railroad&quot;, a film based on the &quot;Thomas&quot; franchise, that was released in 2000. She also provided the voice of the character Lady. The film was a critical and commercial failure. The poor box-office performance of the film caused Allcroft to resign as deputy chairwoman of her company in September 2000.

Allcroft was an active member in the British Academy of Film and Television Arts and the Sundance Film Institute. She was also a fellow of the Institute of Directors.

Allcroft had expressed her disdain with the 2021 &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends: All Engines Go&quot; cartoon series, which she had no creative control over, stating that the reboot lacked the &quot;magic&quot; of the original series. 

In 2023, a documentary titled &quot;An Unlikely Fandom&quot; was released by filmmaker Brannon Carty, which centres around the &quot;Thomas &amp; Friends&quot; adult fandom. Allcroft is featured in the documentary via both archival interview clips of her and interviews taken at her home in April 2022. She appeared at the film&#x27;s premier along with Carty and Shining Time Station co-creator Rick Siggelkow.

==Personal life and death==
Allcroft married television producer Angus Wright in 1973. They had a son and daughter and divorced in 1997.

Allcroft advocated against the use of animals in circuses, believing them to be violent and harmful to the minds of children. She stated, &quot;If we teach children that it’s all right to dominate animals and use them for our amusement, how can we expect children to extend kindness to one another?&quot;

Allcroft died on 25 December 2024 in Los Angeles, California, eleven days after her 81st birthday. Her death was announced by filmmaker Brannon Carty on X on 3 January 2025.

<text>Surya Varuna Claudine Bonaly (born 15 December 1973) is a French retired competitive figure skater. She is a three-time World silver medalist (1993–1995), a five-time European champion (1991–1995), the 1991 World Junior Champion, and a nine-time French national champion (1989–1997).

Bonaly is the only Olympic figure skater to land a backflip on one blade; she performed it at the 1998 Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan.

== Early life ==
Surya Varuna Claudine Bonaly was born in Nice, France, on 15 December 1973. Her birth name was Claudine; when she was adopted out of an orphanage at the age of eight months by Suzanne Bonaly, a physical education teacher in Nice, and Georges Bonaly, a draftsman who worked for the French government, she was named after the Hindu deities Surya and Varuna. Suzanne Bonaly said that they adopted a poor, nonwhite baby because &quot;they are the babies no one takes&quot;. They initially wanted to adopt a baby from India, but received a call from an orphanage in France. Bonaly was educated at home by her mother. Bonaly&#x27;s coach, Didier Gailhaguet, told reporters early in Bonaly&#x27;s figure skating career that she had been born in Réunion and abandoned as a baby on the beach, that she had been raised on a macrobiotic diet, and that the 17-inch ponytail she had at the 1992 Olympics had never been cut. Gailhaguet made up these stories about her early life &quot;as a way to contend with better-established&quot; skaters. Bonaly later found that her biological mother was from Réunion and that her biological father was from Ivory Coast.

Bonaly began gymnastics training from her mother when she was two years old and won a silver medal for the trampoline in team tumbling at the 1986 Tumbling World Championships when she was 12 years old. She began figure skating at the age of 12, when she successfully accomplished her first triple jump. Suzanne Bonaly was her daughter&#x27;s first skating coach. In 1995, Johnette Howard of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; called Suzanne Bonaly &quot;domineering&quot; and stated that she had &quot;near-total control&quot; of her daughter&#x27;s training and was intimately involved with her daughter&#x27;s career. In 2016, reporter Susan Du described Gailhaguet&#x27;s false stories about Bonaly&#x27;s birth, the press&#x27; reactions to Suzanne Bonaly, and Gailhaguet&#x27;s unsubstantiated accusations that she abused her daughter.

Gailhaguet discovered Bonaly and invited her to train with him in Paris; her mother accompanied her there and her father stayed in Nice. Bonaly later told BBC&#x27;s &quot;Outlook Podcast&quot; in 2019 that they lived in her parents&#x27; van and were &quot;almost homeless&quot;. She made the French national team within a year.

==Skating career==

=== 1987–1988 to 1989–1990 ===
Bonaly came in seventh place at Blue Swords, a junior-level competition in Germany, in 1987. At the 1988 World Junior Championships in December 1987, she came in 14th place.

At the 1988 Trophée Lalique, Bonaly came in seventh place. She came in third place at the 1989 World Junior Championships and won the gold medal for the first time at the 1989 French National Championships in December 1988. She came in eighth place at the 1989 European Championships and in 10th place at the 1989 World Championships.

In the fall of 1989, Bonaly competed at the Nebelhorn Trophy, where she came in second place, and at Skate America, where she came in sixth place. She again won the gold medal at the French Nationals and came in second place at Junior Worlds. She came in seventh place at the 1989 Tropheé Lalique, in fourth place at Europeans, and in ninth place at Worlds.

=== 1990–1991 season: World Junior and European titles ===
In the summer of 1990, Bonaly came in third place overall at the 1990 Goodwill Games, after coming in fourth place after the short program and third place during the free skating program, when she attempted to accomplish a quadruple jump, although her landing was two-footed. Gailhaguet later stated that it was the closest she had come to landing a quad jump and that she was accomplishing them easily during practice. She was the first French female skater to successfully accomplish five triple jumps out of the seven jumps required in the free skate. Randy Harvey of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that she was the only woman to attempt a quad jump during the competition and that it was her best effort in three attempts, completing three-and-one-half revolutions, and called her free skating program &quot;easily the most ambitious program&quot; of the competition. Bonaly later told reporters that it was the first time she did not fall while attempting the quad. It was also the first time she won a bronze medal at an international competition. She performed a backflip for the audience during the awards ceremony.

Bonaly came in fifth place at the 1990 Skate America, in third place at the 1990 Skate Electric, and won the gold medal at the 1990 Grand Prix International de Paris and at the 1990 Nebelhorn Trophy. She won the gold medal at the 1991 World Junior Championships in Budapest, Hungary, her final junior appearance. After earning her third national title, Bonaly competed at the 1991 European Championships in Sofia, Bulgaria, where she won the gold medal. The world press &quot;first took note&quot; of Bonaly after the competition. She came in fifth place at the 1991 Worlds Championships. She attempted a quad jump during her free skate, but it was underrotated; she was so sure that she had landed it cleanly that she threw up her arms in excitement, tripped, and &quot;belly flopped on the ice&quot;, as &quot;The New York Times&quot; put it, &quot;for no apparent reason&quot;.

=== 1991–1992 season: Second European title and first Olympic appearance ===
In 1991, Bonaly won Skate Canada and the Grand Prix de St. Gervais. She came in second place at the NHK Trophy, in third place at Skate America, and in fifth place at the Grand Prix de France. In January 1992, Bonaly again won the gold medal at the European Championships in Lausanne, Switzerland, with &quot;a cautious performance that was still good enough to win&quot;. She finished before German skaters Marina Kielmann and Patricia Neske, who came in second and third places, respectfully. Bonaly did not attempt her quad jump during the free skate, when she portrayed a bullfight in which the bull is spared, but was able to successfully accomplish five clean triple jumps. She also won the gold medal at French Nationals again.

In February 1992, Bonaly participated in the Winter Olympics in Albertville, France. She said later that it was her favorite Olympics because it was her first one and because it took place in her home country. As a citizen of the host country, Bonaly was chosen to represent France&#x27;s athletes by taking the Olympic Oath. Her costumes were designed and donated to her by French fashion designer Christian Lacroix. Before the Olympics, &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported that Bonaly and her mother &quot;engaged in a series of disputes&quot; between her coach, Didier Gailhaguet, and Annick Dumont, her choreographer, which the French federation helped mediate. Susan Du later reported that Gailhaguet never lodged a complaint against Bonaly, but blamed Suzanne Bonaly for their dispute.

During a practice session a few hours before the short program in Albertville, Bonaly landed a backflip near Midori Ito from Japan; the &quot;Baltimore Sun&quot; reported that Ito was &quot;forced to interrupt the final rehearsal of her program&quot; and that she &quot;never regained her composure&quot;, ultimately resulting in a fall 40 seconds after starting her short program during competition, replacing her planned triple Lutz jump for a triple Axel jump, and coming in fourth place. Shortly before the practice for the free skate, the referee of the women&#x27;s competition at the Olympics gave Bonaly&#x27;s mother &quot;a rare warning&quot; because officials had suspected for two years that Bonaly used the backflip in practices to intimidate other skaters. Her mother was furious about the warning, but passed it along to her daughter, who obeyed their demand.

Bonaly came in third place after the short program. During the free skating program, she became the first woman to attempt a quadruple jump at the Olympics, the toe loop jump; although she and her coach thought that she was successful, the jump was not fully rotated and the quad was downgraded. She attempted seven jumps during her free skate. She two-footed the landing on her triple Lutz jump and fell after a triple flip jump, but successfully completed a triple Salchow jump, a triple toe loop-triple toe loop combination jump, and a second triple Lutz jump. Bonaly later told reporters that she lost her concentration and felt &quot;rattled right before going on the ice&quot; because her mother was not allowed near the ice and because she and Gailhaguet disagreed about attempting the quad jump; he later reported that he told her not to attempt the quad jump, but that she did it, anyway. He also stated that Bonaly&#x27;s mother had &quot;made some enormous tactical errors, like changing Surya&#x27;s Olympic long program at the last minute&quot;. Johnette Howard of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; said that Bonaly&#x27;s decision to attempt the jump &quot;scuttled her chances&quot; at winning the gold medal in Albertville. According to Susan Du, the judges downgraded Bonaly&#x27;s scores because it was &quot;conceit to think she could land such a move, they seemed to say&quot;. The &quot;Outlook Podcast&quot; called Bonaly&#x27;s quad attempt &quot;the most ambitious move in the Olympics&quot;. Scott Hamilton, during his commentary of the event&#x27;s broadcast, said that she was &quot;cheated by half a turn&quot;; he later said about her quest to successfully accomplish the quad jump: &quot;It turned a lot of heads. She was trying, but she was always a little short of rotation&quot;. Bonaly came sixth place in the free skate and came in fifth place overall.

After the Olympics, Howard reported that the Bonalys moved to a resort in the French Alps, &quot;to train and to heal&quot;. As Du put it, &quot;the break was a necessary respite&quot;. Bonaly and Gailhaguet decided to part company shortly after the Olympics; the &quot;Outlook Podcast&quot; later said that her desperation to complete a quad at the Olympics was the cause of their falling-out. Bonaly started working with André Brunet, an interim coach appointed by the French federation; according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, they worked together for &quot;an unsettling, contentious month&quot;. Howard reported that the French federation was &quot;shopping Surya to six coaches, five of whom said they would be happy to take her if Suzanne stayed out of the rink&quot;, although the Bonalys said they were never consulted about their coaching situation. They considered having Bonaly become professional, but chose against it when the French federation opposed it.

Bonaly concluded her season at the 1992 World Championships in Oakland, California. Ranked tenth place in the short program and 12th place in the free skate, she finished in 11th place overall. Bonaly later criticized Brunet&#x27;s coaching style and said that &quot;Oakland was the pits&quot;.

=== 1992–1993 season: First World silver medal ===
From April to September 1992, Bonaly was coached mainly by her mother. She made two month-long visits, in June and September, to train with coach Frank Carroll in southern California, at a rink &quot;The New York Times&quot; called &quot;both a touchstone and a refuge&quot; for both Bonaly and her mother. Although she wanted to work with Carroll permanently, the French skating federation was opposed to its skaters training abroad. Susanne Bonaly later said that they considered Bonaly changing nationalities, but chose not to because they could not afford it, although there were reports that they probably could afford it. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, Bonaly was &quot;skating less like a former gymnast and more like a dancer&quot;. 

&quot;The Times&quot; stated that by the time Bonaly arrived in California to train with Carroll, she was more receptive, hardworking, and cooperative. Carroll said that they were able to &quot;change the focus of what she thought was important in her skating to what the judges felt was important&quot;, which included stronger skating skills. He advised her to &quot;appeal to the judges’ sense of good skating and put her own aesthetics aside&quot; by giving up on accomplishing the quad, stop doing her backflip in front of judges, and by cutting her ponytail. Carroll also stated that the language barrier between him and Bonaly&#x27;s mother helped the quality of their relationship. His influence on Bonaly was most apparent in her free skating program, which he choreographed. Alain Giletti became Bonaly&#x27;s coach in France, commuting four times a week by train from Tours to Paris to work with Bonaly; her mother filled in for him during his absences. Giletti stated that Bonaly&#x27;s improvement was due to better artistic expression, more self-confidence, and a better environment, adding that &quot;the blossoming of Surya is due most of all to the fact that she has rediscovered the joy of skating&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribun&quot;e attributed Bonaly&#x27;s success to spending time out of France, after a year of her mother&#x27;s feuding with some French journalists, the French skating federation, and Gailhauguet. The &quot;Tribune&quot; reported that Giletti avoided problems by &quot;deferring to Madame Bonaly&quot;. They also reported that Natalia Dubova, the coach of Maya Usova and Aleksandsr Zhulin, the ice dance from Russia, accused Bonaly&#x27;s team of stealing cassette tapes of their music, an adaptation of Vivaldi&#x27;s &quot;Four Seasons&quot;, which Bonaly used for her free skating program that season. The controversy was resolved when Suzanne Bonaly paid Dubova $1,000. 

Training with Carroll helped Bonaly improve; she won the Nations Cup in Gelsenkirchen, Germany, the Lilique Trophy, the Grand Prix de St. Gervais, and the NHK Trophy that season. She came in second place at Prague Skate. She again won the French Nationals and, coming in as favorite to win into the 1993 European Championships again, came in first place. 

At the 1993 World Championships in Prague, Bonaly took silver behind Oksana Baiul from Ukraine, who had higher presentation scores. She easily beat Nancy Kerrigan from the U.S., winning her qualifying group with six triple jumps &quot;with grace&quot; and with &quot;surprising aesthetic appeal&quot;. Carlo Fassi, the coach from Italy, told her that it was the best he had ever seen her skate and Carroll told reporters that &quot;You can’t sit there and say this girl doesn’t skate anymore. She does use the edges, and darn nice edges, too&quot;.

=== 1993–1994 season ===

For the 1993—1994 season, Bonaly came in first place at the 1993 NHK Trophy, the 1993 Grand Prix de France, and again at both the 1994 French Nationals and the 1994 European Championships in Copenhagen, Denmark. She came in second place at the 1993 Skate America, behind Baiul, and in fourth place at the 1993 Piruetten.

In February 1994, Bonaly competed at the 1994 Winter Olympics in Lillehammer, Norway. The &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, in the aftermath of the assault of Nancy Kerrigan at the 1994 U.S. Figure Skating Championships the previous month, reported that Kerrigan&#x27;s &quot;principle opposition&quot;, after coming in first place after the short program, was from Bonaly and Baiul. Bonaly came in third place in the short program, fourth place in the free skate and finished in fourth place overall, behind Baiul, Kerrigan, and Chen Lu from China. 

After the Olympics, Bonaly and her mother moved to Pralognan-la-Vanoise, where Bonaly could train out of the public eye.

==== 1994 World Championships ====
Mickey Duzyj, director and executive producer of the Netflix documentary series &quot;Losers&quot;, which featured Bonaly in one episode, called Bonaly&#x27;s experience at the 1994 World Championships in Chiba, Japan, &quot;a frustrating failure&quot;. Yuka Sato from Japan came in first place after the short program by a narrow margin. Both she and Bonaly won four first-place votes from the nine judges, although Bonaly also earned three third-place votes. Randy Harvey of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; called Bonaly&#x27;s free skate an &quot;ambitious program&quot; that included a triple toe loop-half loop-triple Salchow-double toe loop sequence of jumps and back-to-back triple jumps. She touched her hand to the ice during her triple loop jump later in the program and underrotated her triple-triple combination jump. Sato won the free skate, also by a narrow margin, with scores ranging from 5.7 to 5.9; Bonaly&#x27;s scores ranged from 5.5 to 5.9. Five of the nine judges rated Sato in first place, while four judges placed Bonaly in first place, although one judge placed Bonaly in third place after Tanja Swewczenko from Germany, who came in third place over all. Bonaly&#x27;s final score was two-tenths of a point lower than Sato&#x27;s. At the end, the judges indicated, by a 5-4 vote, that Sato would come in first place and win the gold medal. According to the Associated Press (AP), Giletti had suggested that Bonaly attempt the quadruple toe loop jump during the free skate but chose not to, although she successfully accomplished a triple flip-triple toe combination jump. She touched her hand on the ice after a triple loop jump late in her program, which the AP said cost her the competition. Duzyj stated that Bonaly was &quot;visibly distraught&quot;; he also said, &quot;What she saw as unfair treatment from the judges had become routine&quot;. She later told Duzyj, &quot;When you do sport, the rule is that you&#x27;re supposed to play fair, to be a good athlete and good sport, I get it. But I think at this point it was more an act of saying, &#x27;OK, this is too much.&#x27; It happened many years in a row&quot;. 

At first, Bonaly refused to join Sato and Szewczenko and take the podium during the awards ceremony and then pulled off her medal &quot;in disgust&quot; and as a protest against the judges&#x27; decision; she was booed by the crowd. She also choose to not attend the news conference held for the three top finishers afterwards. The AP called Bonaly&#x27;s behavior &quot;a temper tantrum&quot;. As Susan Du stated, however, Bonaly &quot;changed everything about the way she skated, what made her different, and special, even how she looked. She played by the rules. It still wasn’t enough&quot;. Bonaly later told Du that she felt that no matter how well she skated, the judges would not recognize her skills. Bonaly told Harvey that she received mixed messages from her federation and judges; when she tried to be more successful using skating technique, she was told that she was not artistic enough, but when she chose to &quot;change to just normal skating, that&#x27;s not good, too&quot;. American skater Tara Lipinski stated that Bonaly should not have taken off her medal; Bonaly responded by saying that her actions would be more acceptable if she were a man and that she needed to &quot;show that [treating her differently] should not happen anymore&quot;. She also later told reporters, &quot;It&#x27;s not right&quot;. The ISU first thought of punishing Bonaly for her actions, but decided to let it go, stating that they understood that she was disappointed by the results.
=== 1994–1995 season: Fifth European title ===
Bonaly came in first place at the 1994 Skate America. She was in third place after the short program, but was able capitalize the mistakes made by Michelle Kwan and Irina Slutskaya during the free skating; according to the &quot;Greensboro News and Record&quot;, Bonaly&#x27;s &quot;oft-troublesome assortment of soaring triple jumps and gymnast-like leaps boosted her past&quot; Slutskaya, who was in first place after the short program and came in third place overall, and Kwan, who came in second place overall. Bonaly also won the 1994 Trophée de France and came in second place at the 1994 NHK Trophy. She won the 1994 Goodwill Games in St. Petersburg, Russia, which had to change venues due to lack of ice at the original rink. She also competed at two professional-amateur competitions during the 1994—1995 season, coming in first place overall at the Thrifty Car Rental International Challenge and the AT&amp;T Challenge. At the Thrifty Car Rental Challenge, Bonaly was favored to win. She came in second place in the short program, behind Olga Markova from Russia, but was able to &quot;edge out&quot; Markova in the free skate. Bonaly later told reporters that &quot;I can&#x27;t say it was 100 percent excellence, but I did my job out there&quot;. She came in second place at the 1995 Hersey&#x27;s Kisses Great American Figure Skating Challenge, competing for Team World. She also won the gold medal at the French Nationals again.

Bonaly won the 1995 European Championships for the fifth time, despite nursing a broken right toe. Coming from behind, her performance, according to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, was &quot;clearly the best&quot;. Her free skate, which was set to &quot;lively gypsy music&quot;, earned her scores between 5.7 to 5.9, included &quot;a difficult and rare&quot; triple Lutz-triple toe loop combination jump, which was the first time the combination was successfully completed in competition. The &quot;Tampa Bay Times&quot; called her performance &quot;smooth and exciting after falls and mistakes by several of the top skaters&quot;, and also said that Bonaly was noted for being &quot;more of a jumper than an artist on ice&quot;, although she had been working on her presentation scores because the judges, as she put it, &quot;always have considered it a fault of mine&quot;. Olga Markova from Russia, who was in first place after the short program, won the silver medal, and Elena Liashenko of Ukraine won the bronze medal.

At the 1995 World Championships, Bonaly came in fourth place during her &quot;flawed&quot; short program, behind Chen Lu of China. She touched the ice during a combination jump, struggled with a few of her spins, and did &quot;a good deal more churning than gliding&quot;. Five of the nine judges rated her performance higher than Michelle Kwan&#x27;s, although according to the &quot;L.A. Times&quot;, Kwan skated a clean program and successfully accomplished all of her jumps. Bonaly skated better in her free skating program, successfully accomplishing six clean triple jumps, but came in second place overall for the third year in a row. According to &quot;The New York Times&quot;, she &quot;even went out of her way to thank&quot; Kwan, who came in fourth place over all, stating that &quot;without the young American&#x27;s dynamic, third-place performance in the free skate, Bonaly would have had to settle for bronze and [Nicole] Bobek would have gotten the silver&quot;.

=== 1995–1996 season ===
For the 1996—1997 season, Bonaly came in fourth place overall at the 1995 Skate America, after coming in fifth place during the short program. She also came in fourth place at the 1995 NHK Trophy, third place at the 1995 Trophée de France, and fourth place at the 1996 Centennial on Ice. Bonaly earned 12 points, so she did not qualify for the finals for the Champions Series, the series of international competitions conducted by the ISU beginning in 1995. She had tied for the last spot in the finals, but her fifth-place finish in the free skate at the NHK Trophy was the deciding factor that took her out of the competition. She again won the gold medal at the French Nationals.

Bonaly came in second place at the 1996 European Championships, failing to tie the record for six wins at Europeans, behind Irina Slutskaya, the first Russian woman to win the title. Bonaly told reporters that she did not skate her best. She came in fifth place at the 1996 World Figure Skating Championships.
=== 1996–1997 season ===
In May 1996, Bonaly ruptured her Achilles tendon, which almost ended her figure skating career and caused her to miss much of the following season. Susan Du reported the injury occurred while Bonaly was practicing her backflip, although there were other reports that the injury occurred during an exhibition performance. She won her final and ninth consecutive French National title, which qualified her for the 1998 Olympics.

The French federation initially decided not to name her to the 1997 European Championships in Paris, believing that she lacked fitness, but Bonaly successfully appealed. She struggled to qualify, coming in sixth place in the second group of qualifiers, completing only two triple toe loop jumps and one triple Salchow jump. She later told reporters that she was nervous, despite it being the competition&#x27;s qualifying event. She came in ninth place overall.
=== 1997–1998 season: Third Olympics ===
During the 1997–1998 season, Bonaly was coached by Suzanne Bonaly and Tatiana Tarasova in Marlborough, Massachusetts. For her free skating program, Bonaly returned to her &quot;signature piece&quot;, &quot;The Four Seasons&quot; by Vivaldi, which she had used in previous seasons. Mike Penner of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; reported that due to her injury in 1996, Bonaly was still &quot;out of shape&quot; at the 1998 European Championships, so as he put it, she &quot;ran out of gas midway through her [free skating] program—doing little more than gliding across the ice for the last two minutes&quot;. She came in sixth place overall.

In February 1998, Bonaly participated in the Winter Olympics in Nagano, Japan. She called them &quot;special&quot; because it was her final Olympics and because they were &quot;pretty much my last competition ever&quot;. Penner blamed Bonaly&#x27;s low scores in the short program, along with those of Chinese skater Chen Lu, to ageism. Penner, who stated that Bonaly and Chen &quot;felt the sting of the judges’ crackback against the aged&quot;, reported that both skaters performed clean and pleasant programs. Bonaly&#x27;s coach, Uschi Keszler, called her triple toe-triple toe combination jump &quot;very difficult&quot; and her spins &quot;beautiful&quot;. Bonaly was given only one technical merit mark above a 5.3 and her presentation marks ranged from 4.9 to 5.7. Penner reported that Keszler &quot;couldn&#x27;t believe the marks&quot;; Bonaly reacted by shrugging and stated, &quot;After 10 years, I am used to it&quot;.

Bonaly had pulled her groin muscle the day before the free skate; her injury was so severe, she was unable to walk, had to be carried up the stairs, and considered dropping out of the rest of the competition. Susan Du reported that Bonaly&#x27;s injury liberated her because she knew that &quot;she had nothing to lose&quot; and that realistically, she would not be able to place in the top three. As Rihanna Walker of &quot;The New York Times&quot; put it, &quot;She was still determined to compete, however, and to leave the ice giving people something to talk about&quot;. Bonaly fell on a triple jump, and as Du put it, &quot;regained her composure, and backed into a spontaneous backflip&quot;; at the time, she was only skater in the world capable of successfully accomplishing it. She was in so much pain, she felt that she was unable to successfully accomplish even crossovers and her triple jumps, so she decided, towards the end of her program, to &quot;do something easier than a triple jump&quot;. As the host of the &quot;Outlook Podcast&quot; later said, &quot;Surya Bonaly is the only person who would think that doing a backflip would be easier&quot; than doing a triple jump. The audience erupted and the judges were shocked after she landed her backflip. She thought that the rule prevented her from landing on two feet, so she hoped that she would not be disqualified because she landed it on one foot. The audience reacted with astonishment; when she finished her program, she &quot;bore an exuberant smile&quot; and &quot;turned her back to the judges and bowed first to the fans&quot;. Bonaly later told reporters that she wanted to &quot;show the judges, who don’t appreciate what I do, just what I can do&quot;. She also wanted to please the audience.

The judges awarded Bonaly with low scores, ranging from 4.8 to 5.3, dropping her from sixth place to tenth place overall. She retired from amateur competition after the event. Bonaly had two hip surgeries after completing her competitive career. She had suffered from chronic pain since she was a gymnast, accepting it as part of elite skating and avoiding treatment for many years. 

== Professional career ==
As a professional, Bonaly had a &quot;long and successful career&quot;. She performed in many ice shows all over the world and competed and won many professional competitions. She toured with Champions on Ice between 1993 and 2007. She performed her backflip during these shows, probably about 500 times, as well as triple and quadruple jumps. She performed for audiences of 15,000 people in major cities in Europe and the U.S. She later said that the audiences at the ice shows she performed in demanded that she perform her backflip. She told &quot;The Root&quot; in 2014 that she never had quit skating, that she was planning to tour with Holiday on Ice in Europe for three months, and that had she performed in ice shows with Russian skater Evgeni Pleshenko for years. She underwent an operation in 2015 for large non-cancerous cysts along her spinal cord. Her surgeon warned her against performing any more backflips; she retired from skating and became a coach full-time. As of 2009, she coached skaters between the ages of 3 and 59 in Las Vegas, Colorado, and Switzerland. By 2016, she also coached in Minnesota.

== Influence and legacy ==

=== Skating style and the backflip ===
In 2009, the French newspaper &quot;La Dépêche&quot; called Bonaly &quot;without a doubt the most successful figure skating champion of the last twenty years&quot;. Shayla Lawson of ESPN said about Bonaly, &quot;With her electric eyeliner and sequined leotard, she was the frozen Grace Jones of dreams&quot;. She was the second black female skater, after American skater Debi Thomas, &quot;to reach the international elite&quot;. In 2011, figure skating historian James R. Hines called Bonaly &quot;the most successful black skater in the history of the sport&quot;. In 2016, reporter Susan Du called Bonaly &quot;one of the most celebrated black figure skaters in the history of a lily-white sport&quot; and &quot;the only human being in the history of the world who can land a backflip on one blade&quot;. &quot;The Root&quot; called Bonaly one of the &quot;handful of black stars to emerge&quot; at the Olympics. 

In 1990, figure skating coach John Nicks called Bonaly &quot;unique&quot; and said that it was her gymnastic abilities that made her special. By the age of 17, she was called &quot;the most daring jumper in the sport&quot; and &quot;The New York Times&quot; called her &quot;a better jumper than skater&quot;. Du stated that early in Bonaly&#x27;s career, &quot;Her pure athleticism was immediately evident. She was quick. She was aerial. It wasn’t enough for her to simply glide and dance when she could leap and spin&quot;. In 1993, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; called Bonaly &quot;more a gymnast on ice&quot; than a skater, &quot;all strength and athleticism, the one who clunked from jump to jump, trying—and always falling on—quadruple jumps and triple axels&quot;. The &quot;Tribune&quot; also stated that although Europe &quot;loved Bonaly on the continent&quot;, as evidenced by her multiple European titles, the rest of the world judged her more critically. Keli Goff of &quot;The Root&quot;l stated that Bonaly &quot;wowed audiences with routines that combined the artistry of figure skating with the athleticism of a gymnast&quot;. In 1995, &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; said that Bonaly was &quot;the most gifted and athletic figure skater in the world today, or...a unique but squandered talent whose career seems destined to stall at also-ran status&quot; if she did not win the Worlds Championships that season.

Bonaly spent much of her career working on successfully executing a quadruple jump, which she thought was more difficult than the backflip. She began working on the quad in 1989, after winning her first of nine French Nationals titles. She told Nick Zaccardi of NBC Sports in 2022 that she was able to land triples &quot;with my eyes closed&quot;, adding that &quot;Hey, with extra speed, with extra height, I could do a quadruple if I work on it&quot;. She later said that she felt that her work on the quad was not appreciated because she was unable to land it during competition. Bonaly later said that she regretted not being able to successfully execute a quad jump in competition because, as she put it, &quot;Yeah, that was my thing&quot;. 

As Hines put it, Bonaly is &quot;remembered especially for her signature back flip&quot; and Goff stated that Bonaly was best known for her &quot;famous backflips on ice&quot;. During her exhibition program following the 1995 European Championships, despite a broken toe on her right foot and a strained right calf, Bonaly performed a backflip and a handspring, another move banned from competition, as well as seven triple jumps, and two triple-double combination jumps, &quot;plus some spins and blade-flashing footwork, all set to music that conjured up visions of violin bows dancing, kettledrummers hunched over their labors and cellists sawing at their strings&quot;. She did the backflip at the 1998 Olympics because she was, up to that point, known for performing the move at exhibitions but not at competitions, and because she &quot;wanted to leave a trademark&quot; at the Olympics. According to figure skating writer and historian Ellyn Kestnbaum, by the 1998 Olympics, Bonaly was skating more for her fans than for the judges. Kestnbaum reports that observers interpreted Bonaly&#x27;s execution of the backflip at the 1998 Olympics as disrespectful towards the judges and towards figure skating officials, and that it &quot;signified Bonaly&#x27;s decision to play a game she could win—popularity with fans—rather than placing herself in the position of being determined worthy, or on this occasion more likely unworthy, according to the technical judging criteria&quot;. She performed her last backflip in 2014, but stopped doing them due to chronic pain.

=== Racism ===
In 2014, Bonaly spoke with &quot;The Root&quot; about the lack of diversity in winter sports and about racism in France and the U.S., although she said that things had improved by 2014, when more black people in France and the U.S. were skating. She said &quot;I think that some were afraid and just thought skating [and other winter sports] are just for whites&quot; and that she hoped that she inspired a new generation of diverse skaters, as black skaters like Debi Thomas had done for her. She also told &quot;The Root&quot; that &quot;race matters for sure, because I know that if I&#x27;d been white, I would have had more [endorsement] contracts and been bigger.&quot;

When asked if she was scored differently at the 1994 Worlds Championships because she was black, Bonaly responded, &quot;I never thought so, and I never really wanted to believe, 100 percent, it was that&quot; and tried to find other explanations for how she was scored and was treated by the sport. In 2016, Du stated, &quot;The question of why Surya never attained Olympic gold, and the disqualification of her singular skill, is still a matter of controversy. It’s the reason her fame inhabits a cult status rarely enjoyed by even the most decorated skating stars. It’s why people still know her name long after she hung up her competitive skates for the last time in 1998&quot;. Du also stated that one of Bonaly&#x27;s strengths as a coach later in her career was her ability to remain happy and confident, which Du said was a skill Bonaly &quot;developed over a lifetime of grappling with a world that seemed hell-bent on keeping her out&quot;. Du went on to state that from the beginning of Bonaly&#x27;s career, her critics disapproved of her style, which combined figure skating and gymnastics, considering it &quot;inelegant, more a show of power than grace&quot;, although her &quot;unique tumbling background&quot; also gave Bonaly an advantage. As Du put it, &quot;she could push the boundaries of what was considered physically possible&quot; in figure skating. Du also stated that Bonaly loved performing and &quot;loved making art that others could watch&quot;, adding that Bonaly &quot;craved the crowd, the applause, the couture, and the drama of the world stage&quot;. Du reported that as Bonaly prepared for her final Olympics in 1998, &quot;bad press followed her&quot;. Du also stated that much of the press focused on Bonaly&#x27;s race, but that she &quot;never fixated on whether the judges shortchanged her at the 1994 World Championships because she was black&quot;. 

Du went on to state, &quot;[Bonaly] believed she had to be objectively exceptional, so that race could not be held against her. Or used as an excuse. She was nevertheless used as a symbol — called a rebel, a diva, a badass, another oft-scrutinized black body. People talked about her muscles, her thighs, as if they were weapons in a cultural war&quot;. According to the &quot;Outlook Podcast&quot;, &quot;Some people suggested that her moves weren&#x27;t graceful enough, that you could see her preparing to jump, instead of fluidly moving into each move&quot;. The podcast also stated that Bonaly broke the stereotype of the &quot;white ice princess&quot;, so she was not well received, no matter how hard she trained or how she tried to please the audience and judges. In 2016, Shayla Lawson of ESPN, while writing about body image and sport, compared her years of training as a dancer with Bonaly&#x27;s experiences as a figure skater and praised her for her tenacity. Lawson stated that Bonaly &quot;did not fit the contours and fragility of the ice princess,&quot; that she was ridiculed for her physicality, and that she was &quot;pegged as a rebel&quot;. Lawson went on to state, &quot;Of course, &#x27;ice princess&#x27; was just shorthand for the fact Bonaly possessed some of the stereotypical markers of a black woman&#x27;s body. She had a short, muscular stature with thick thighs and legs. She had dark skin of unmistakably African origins&quot;.

== Personal life ==
In 1990, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; reported that Bonaly ate a macrobiotic diet, with no fish or meat. In 2006, the &quot;Citizen Times&quot;, a newspaper in Asheville, North Carolina, named Bonaly in its list of elite athletes who were vegetarians.

Bonaly resided in the U.S. since 1997, first in Boston and then starting in 1999, in Las Vegas, Nevada, where she also trained while not touring. While living in Las Vegas, she met skating coach Peter Biver; by 2016, she was in a long-time relationship with him. Also by 2016, she moved to Minnesota to be near Biver and to coach figure skaters. As of 2019, Bonaly was engaged to Biver; he was interviewed for BBC&#x27;s &quot;Outook Podcast&quot;. They did pairs skating together, including moves like the death spiral, and went to roller skating rinks during their dates. She became an American citizen in January 2004, when she was living in Las Vegas. She was able to retain her French citizenship. She skated for the first time as an American citizen in April 2004, at a Champions on Ice performance in Boston. In 2010, Bonaly served as the cultural attaché for the Monaco consulate in Las Vegas.

In 2007, Bonaly appeared in a poster made by PETA protesting Canada&#x27;s seal hunt and the fur trade. She also was part of a delegation, which included other international celebrities, from the Society for the Protection of Animals, who met with the president of France, Nicolas Sarkozy, to address the abolition of bullfighting and to prohibit attendance at bullfighting events by children under the age of 16. In 2010, Bonaly met with Princess Caroline of Monaco, who recognized her for her &quot;successful fundraising&quot; for the World Association of Children&#x27;s Friends (AMADE), a children&#x27;s charity organization founded by Princess Grace of Monaco. Bonaly was a member of the federal council of the French Federation of Ice Sports from 2010 to 2014 and was the ambassador of &quot;France of Talents and Colors&quot;, an association that fought against racism, violence, and discrimination in sport.

In 2019, Bonaly was featured in the Netflix documentary series &quot;Losers&quot;, which explores the lives of individuals who bounced back from loss or perceived failure. Also in 2019, she was awarded the Insignia of Knight, &quot;Commander of the Legion of Honour.&quot; In 2022, Bonaly co-wrote a children&#x27;s book, &quot;Fearless Heart: An Illustrated Biography of Surya Bonaly&quot;, with Frank Murphy, and illustrated by Anastasia Magloire Williams. The reviewer stated that the book was &quot;a tad uneven&quot;, probably due to the poetic nature of the text, although it had &quot;standout illustrations&quot;.

<doc id="362953" wikidata="Q919125" url="?curid=362953" title="Parallelogram law">
<text>In mathematics, the simplest form of the parallelogram law (also called the parallelogram identity) belongs to elementary geometry. It states that the sum of the squares of the lengths of the four sides of a parallelogram equals the sum of the squares of the lengths of the two diagonals. We use these notations for the sides: &quot;AB&quot;, &quot;BC&quot;, &quot;CD&quot;, &quot;DA&quot;. But since in Euclidean geometry a parallelogram necessarily has opposite sides equal, that is, &quot;AB&quot; = &quot;CD&quot; and &quot;BC&quot; = &quot;DA&quot;, the law can be stated as
formula_1

If the parallelogram is a rectangle, the two diagonals are of equal lengths &quot;AC&quot; = &quot;BD&quot;, so
formula_2
and the statement reduces to the Pythagorean theorem. For the general quadrilateral (with four sides not necessarily equal) Euler&#x27;s quadrilateral theorem states
formula_3
where formula_4 is the length of the line segment joining the midpoints of the diagonals. It can be seen from the diagram that formula_5 for a parallelogram, and so the general formula simplifies to the parallelogram law.

== Proof ==

In the parallelogram on the right, let AD = BC = &quot;a&quot;, AB = DC = &quot;b&quot;, formula_6 By using the law of cosines in triangle formula_7 we get:
formula_8

In a parallelogram, adjacent angles are supplementary, therefore formula_9 Using the law of cosines in triangle formula_10 produces:
formula_11

By applying the trigonometric identity formula_12 to the former result proves:
formula_13

Now the sum of squares formula_14 can be expressed as:
formula_15

Simplifying this expression, it becomes:
formula_16

== The parallelogram law in inner product spaces ==

In a normed space, the statement of the parallelogram law is an equation relating norms:
formula_17

The parallelogram law is equivalent to the seemingly weaker statement:
formula_18
because the reverse inequality can be obtained from it by substituting formula_19 for formula_20 and formula_21 for formula_22 and then simplifying. With the same proof, the parallelogram law is also equivalent to:
formula_23

In an inner product space, the norm is determined using the inner product:
formula_24

As a consequence of this definition, in an inner product space the parallelogram law is an algebraic identity, readily established using the properties of the inner product:
formula_25
formula_26

Adding these two expressions:
formula_27
as required.

If formula_4 is orthogonal to formula_22 meaning formula_30 and the above equation for the norm of a sum becomes:
formula_31
which is Pythagoras&#x27; theorem.

== Normed vector spaces satisfying the parallelogram law ==

Most real and complex normed vector spaces do not have inner products, but all normed vector spaces have norms (by definition). For example, a commonly used norm for a vector formula_32 in the real coordinate space formula_33 is the formula_34-norm:
formula_35

Given a norm, one can evaluate both sides of the parallelogram law above. A remarkable fact is that if the parallelogram law holds, then the norm must arise in the usual way from some inner product. In particular, it holds for the formula_34-norm if and only if formula_37 the so-called norm or norm.

For any norm satisfying the parallelogram law (which necessarily is an inner product norm), the inner product generating the norm is unique as a consequence of the polarization identity. In the real case, the polarization identity is given by:
formula_38
or equivalently by
formula_39

In the complex case it is given by:
formula_40

For example, using the formula_34-norm with formula_42 and real vectors formula_4 and formula_22 the evaluation of the inner product proceeds as follows:
formula_45
which is the standard dot product of two vectors.

Another necessary and sufficient condition for there to exist an inner product that induces the given norm formula_46 is for the norm to satisfy Ptolemy&#x27;s inequality:
formula_47

Founded by Carl Walther in 1886, the company has manufactured firearms and air guns at its facility in Germany for more than 100 years. Walther Arms, Inc. is the United States Walther business unit and is based in Fort Smith, Arkansas.

== History ==
The history of Walther started with the factory created by Matthias Conrad Pistor, the chief armorer of the Kassel Armory. Pistor is the ancestor of the Walther family. This plant was operating in 1780 and made pistols and other weapons. The granddaughter of Gustave Wilhelm Pistor married August Theodore Walther, whose son Carl Wilhelm Freund established the factory that employed apprentice Carl Walther. This small shop was established in 1886 in Zella-Mehlis, in what is today Thuringia. The company originally manufactured hunting and target rifles.
Then in 1888, he married Minna Georgine Pickert, daughter of Christian Friedrich Pickert, from the well-established revolver manufacturer &quot;Arminius Waffenwerk&quot;, in the same town.

It was not until 1908 that, under the initiative of Fritz Walther, the oldest son of Carl Walther, they began to make pistols. Models 1 to 5 and 7 to 9 were in calibers .25 ACP (6.35mm) and .32 ACP (7.65mm). The Model 6 was Walther&#x27;s first attempt at a 9mm Luger pistol. It used blowback rather than a locked breech and proved unsuccessful, with only around 1,000 made. Its rarity has made it highly sought after on the collectors market.

In 1929 Walther began to make the popular Walther PP &quot;Polizeipistole&quot; (police pistol) models. Walther followed this in 1931 with the first PPKs (&quot;Polizeipistole Kriminalmodell&quot;, or Police Pistol Detective Model). Walther manufactured both PP and PPKs in .22 Long Rifle, .32 ACP (the most common caliber), .380 ACP and a minimal number in .25 ACP. The PP models were the first mass-produced pistols with stamped parts. Still, the overall increase in dependability and high production quality with lower relative manufacturing costs made them the best option to replace the P-08 Luger. In 1938, Nazi Germany awarded the contract for that replacement to Walther for the 9mm P38.

From 1942 until 1945, the company used slave labour at the Neuengamme concentration camp, and operated its own factory at the camp.

With his factory destroyed in World War II and Zella-Mehlis in the Soviet occupation zone, Walther was reduced to just a collection of designs and patents. Fritz Walther started anew and began manufacturing in Ulm, West Germany in 1953.
The company resumed production of the P38 (renamed the P1) in 1957 to equip the new West German Army, the Bundeswehr, with sidearms. When Fritz Walther died in December 1966, his son, Karl-Heinz, took over the company, concentrating on the sports sector.

In 1993, Umarex (now part of PW Group) of Arnsberg, Germany, acquired Walther.
It continued to manufacture under the Walther name in Ulm and Arnsberg. The German Walther company is known as Carl Walther GmbH.

In 1999, the U.S.-based Smith &amp; Wesson company became the authorized importer for Walther Firearms.
In 2012, the PW Group formed a new subsidiary, Walther Arms, Inc., located in Fort Smith, Arkansas, to take over the distribution of Walther arms in the United States.

<text>The Houston Zoo is a zoological park located within Hermann Park in Houston, Texas, United States. The zoo houses over 6,000 animals from more than 900 species. It receives around 2 million visitors each year and is the second most visited zoo in the United States, surpassed only by the San Diego Zoo. It is accredited by the Association of Zoos and Aquariums (AZA). The zoo has been operated by the non-profit corporation Houston Zoo since 2002, and was previously operated by the City of Houston.

==History==
Due to the successful repopulation of American bison in the country, the United States government had an excess of bison on managed lands and donated several bison. Earl was a bison that was donated in 1922 and he would be the zoo&#x27;s first animal.

==Exhibits==

===African Forest===

Called the most ambitious project in the zoo&#x27;s then 88-year history, the African Forest officially opened on December 10, 2010. The exhibit is home to many African species, including the Grant&#x27;s zebra, white rhinoceros, red river hog, Masai giraffe, ostrich, chimpanzee, and western lowland gorilla. In 2011, the &quot;Houston Press&quot; gave the Houston Zoo the Best of Houston Award for Best New Ecosystem. In November 24, 2020, a new male pygmy hippopotamus named Silas first arrived to the Houston Zoo from the Henry Doorly Zoo in Omaha. Silas died due to an illness on October 10, 2022. In November 2024, a pygmy hippo named Akobi arrived from the San Francisco Zoo as part of the breeding recommendation from the AZA.

===McNair Asian Elephant Habitat===

The McNair Asian Elephant Habitat is home to the Houston Zoo&#x27;s herd of Asian elephants. It features a 7,000-square-foot barn custom-built to house the bull elephants, a brand-new expanded habitat with a boardwalk with an unobstructed view of the elephants in their new yard, and a 160,000-gallon pool.

===Birds===

The Houston Zoo boasts one of the largest collections in any US zoo, with more than 800 birds from over 200 species. It includes a range of diverse birds, including the Mariana fruit dove, Micronesian kingfisher, Congo peafowl, and green-winged macaw.

===Carnivores===
Hosting the University of Houston&#x27;s mascot Shasta the Cougar, the carnivore exhibit is also home to the lion, Malayan tiger, clouded leopard, American black bear, African wild dog, leopard, and cheetah.

===Allen H. and Ethel G. Carruth Natural Encounters===
The Allen H. and Ethel G. Carruth Natural Encounters is a special building at the zoo where an adventure through an entire continent is simulated. Visitors learn about animals from the river&#x27;s edge, rainforest canopy, desert, and coral reef. Animals housed in the exhibit include the Asian small-clawed otter, Damaraland mole-rat, golden lion tamarin, golden-headed lion tamarin, meerkat, naked mole-rat, pygmy marmoset, white-faced saki, Hoffmann&#x27;s two-toed sloth, eastern collared lizard, and Victoria crowned pigeon.

===Wortham World of Primates===
A winding boardwalk through a natural setting, this exhibit displays a variety of rare and endangered primates, including lemurs, monkeys, gibbons, and orangutans.

===Texas Wetlands===
Opened in March 2019, this new exhibit displays three native species: American alligators, whooping cranes, and bald eagles.

===Reptile and Amphibian House===
This building displays several venomous reptiles and exotic amphibians, including the blue iguana, crocodile monitor, and reticulated python.

===Bug House===
Opened in 2014, this exhibit displays several insects and arachnids from a variety of forests, jungles, and deserts.

===John P. McGovern Children&#x27;s Zoo===
This area features a petting zoo and a realistic bat cave.

===South America&#x27;s Pantanal===
The South America&#x27;s Pantanal is a 4.2-acre exhibit that opened on October 10, 2020. It displays the blue-throated macaw, jaguar, giant river otter, Baird&#x27;s tapir, greater rhea, capybara, and giant anteater.

=== Galapagos Islands ===
This exhibit, opening April 7th, 2023, focuses on the animals and habitats found in the Galapagos Islands, featuring species including Galapagos tortoises, Humboldt penguins, California sea lions, bonnethead sharks, and Sally Lightfoot crabs.

==Live webcams==
The zoo offers nine exhibit webcams, including the Rhino Cam, Elephant Yard Cam, and Leafcutter Ant Cam.

==Conservation==
The Houston Zoo is an active partner in the AZA&#x27;s Species Survival Plan (SSP) Program, a population management and conservation program for selected species housed in North American zoos.

The zoo supports more than a dozen conservation projects in Texas and across the globe that assist in the survival of endangered wildlife and habitats. Projects include the Houston toad, sea turtle, Attwater&#x27;s prairie chicken, Galapagos tortoise, Bornean orangutan, elephant, clouded leopard, African lion, frogs, Brazilian tapir, rhinoceros, African wild dog, chimpanzee, okapi, and cheetah.

In July 2024, the first-ever mRNA vaccine for elephant endotheliotropic herpesvirus (EEHV), developed by the Houston Zoo, Colossal Biosciences, and the Baylor College of Medicine, was successfully administered to an asian elephant.

<doc id="362961" wikidata="Q855317" url="?curid=362961" title="Peremptory norm">
<text>A peremptory norm (also called &#x27;) is a fundamental principle of international law that is accepted by the international community of states as a norm from which no derogation is permitted.

There is no universal agreement regarding precisely which norms are &quot;jus cogens&quot; nor how a norm reaches that status, but it is generally accepted that &quot;jus cogens&quot; bans genocide, maritime piracy, enslaving in general (i.e. slavery as well as slave trade), wars of aggression and territorial aggrandizement, and generally as well torture, and refoulement.

==Status of peremptory norms under international law==
Unlike ordinary customary law, which has traditionally required consent and allows the alteration of its obligations between states through treaties, peremptory norms may not be violated by any state &quot;through international treaties or local or special customs or even general customary rules not endowed with the same normative force&quot;.

Discussions of the necessity of such norms could be traced back as far as 1758 (in Vattel&#x27;s &quot;The Law of Nations&quot;) and 1764 (in Christian Wolff&#x27;s &quot;Jus Gentium&quot;), clearly rooted in principles of natural law. But it was the judgments of the Permanent Court of International Justice that indicate the existence of such a peremptory norm, in the S.S. &quot;Wimbledon&quot; case in 1923, not mentioning peremptory norms explicitly but stating how state sovereignty is not inalienable.

Under Article 53 of the Vienna Convention on the Law of Treaties, championed by Third World and socialist states during the 1960s, any treaty that conflicts with a peremptory norm is void. The treaty allows for the emergence of new peremptory norms, but does not specify any peremptory norms. It does mention the prohibition on the threat of use of force and on the use of coercion to conclude an agreement:

A treaty is void if, at the time of its conclusion, it conflicts with a peremptory norm of general international law. For the purposes of the present Convention, a peremptory norm of general international law is a norm accepted and recognized by the international community of states as a whole as a norm from which no derogation is permitted and which can be modified only by a subsequent norm of general international law having the same character.
The number of peremptory norms is considered limited but not exclusively catalogued. They are not listed or defined by any authoritative body, but arise out of case law and changing social and political attitudes. Generally included are prohibitions on waging aggressive war, crimes against humanity, war crimes, maritime piracy, genocide, apartheid, slavery, and torture. As an example, international tribunals have held that it is impermissible for a state to acquire territory through war.

Despite the seemingly clear weight of condemnation of such practices, some critics disagree with the division of international legal norms into a hierarchy. There is also disagreement over how such norms are recognized or established. The relatively new concept of peremptory norms seems to be at odds with the traditionally consensual nature of international law considered necessary to state sovereignty.

Some peremptory norms define criminal offences considered to be enforceable against not only states but also individuals. That has been increasingly accepted since the Nuremberg Trials (the first enforcement in world history of international norms upon individuals) and now might be considered uncontroversial. However, the language of peremptory norms was not used in connection with these trials; rather, the basis of criminalisation and punishment of Nazi atrocities was that civilisation could not tolerate their being ignored because it could not survive their being repeated.

There are often disagreements over whether a particular case violates a peremptory norm. As in other areas of law, states generally reserve the right to interpret the concept for themselves.

Many large states have accepted this concept. Some of them have ratified the Vienna Convention, while others have stated in their official statements that they accept the Vienna Convention as &quot;codificatory&quot;. Some have applied the concept in their dealings with international organizations and other states.

==Examples==

===Execution of juvenile offenders===
The case of &quot;Michael Domingues v. United States&quot; provides an example of an international body&#x27;s opinion that a particular norm is of a &quot;jus cogens&quot; nature. Michael Domingues had been convicted and sentenced to death in Nevada, United States for two murders committed when he was 16 years old. Domingues brought the case in front of the Inter-American Commission of Human Rights which delivered a non-legally binding report. The United States argued that there was no &quot;jus cogens&quot; norm that &quot;establishes eighteen years as the minimum age at which an offender can receive a sentence of death&quot;. The Commission concluded that there was a &quot;&quot;jus cogens&quot; norm not to impose capital punishment on individuals who committed their crimes when they had not yet reached 18 years of age&quot;.

The United States has subsequently banned the execution of juvenile offenders. Although not necessarily in response to the above non-binding report, the Supreme Court cited evolving international norms as one of the reasons for the ban (&quot;Roper v. Simmons&quot;).

===Torture===
The prohibition of torture is a rule of customary international law regarded as &quot;jus cogens&quot;.
The International Criminal Tribunal for the Former Yugoslavia stated in &quot;Prosecutor v. Furundžija&quot; that there is a &quot;jus cogens&quot; for the prohibition against torture. It also stated that every state is entitled &quot;to investigate, prosecute and punish or extradite individuals accused of torture, who are present in a territory under its jurisdiction&quot;. The United States Court of Appeals for the Second Circuit stated in &quot;Filártiga v. Peña-Irala&quot; that &quot;the torturer has become, like the pirate and the slave trader before him, &quot;hostis humani generis&quot;, an enemy of all mankind&quot;.

<doc id="362965" wikidata="Q1034946" url="?curid=362965" title="Capriccio Espagnol">
<text>Capriccio espagnol, Op. 34, is the common Western title for a five movement orchestral suite, based on Spanish folk melodies, composed by the Russian composer Nikolai Rimsky-Korsakov in 1887. It received its premiere on 31 October 1887, in St. Petersburg, performed by the Imperial Orchestra conducted by the composer. Rimsky-Korsakov originally intended to write the work for a solo violin with orchestra, but later decided that a purely orchestral work would do better justice to the lively melodies. The Russian title is Каприччио на испанские темы (literally, Capriccio on Spanish Themes).

==Structure==
The work has five movements, divided into two parts comprising the first three and the latter two movements respectively.

# The first movement, Alborada, is a festive and exciting dance, typically from traditional Asturian music to celebrate the rising of the sun. It features the clarinet with two solos, and later features a solo violin with a solo similar to the clarinet&#x27;s.
# The second movement, Variazioni, begins with a melody in the horn section. Variations of this melody are then repeated by other instruments and sections of the orchestra.
# The third movement, Alborada, presents the same Asturian dance as the first movement. The two movements are nearly identical, in fact, except that this movement has a different instrumentation and key.
# The fourth movement, Scena e canto gitano (&quot;Scene and Gypsy song&quot;) opens with five cadenzas — first by the horns and trumpets, then solo violin, flute, clarinet, and harp — played over rolls on various percussion instruments. It is then followed by a dance in triple time leading &quot;&quot; into the final movement.
# The fifth and final movement, Fandango asturiano, is also an energetic dance from the Asturias region of northern Spain. The piece ends with an even more rousing statement of the &quot;Alborada&quot; theme.

A complete performance of the &quot;Capriccio&quot; takes approximately 16 minutes.

It is scored for piccolo, 2 flutes, 2 oboes (one doubling on cor anglais), 2 clarinets (in B and A), 2 bassoons, 4 horns (in F), 2 trumpets (in B, A), 3 trombones, tuba, timpani, triangle, side drum, bass drum, cymbals, tambourine, castanets, harp, and strings.

==Characteristics==
The piece is often lauded for its orchestration, which features a large percussion section and many special techniques and articulations, such as in the fourth movement when the violinists, violists, and cellists are asked to imitate guitars (the violin and viola parts are marked &quot;quasi guitara&quot;). Despite the critical praise, Rimsky-Korsakov was annoyed that the other aspects of the piece were being ignored. In his autobiography, he wrote:

The opinion formed by both critics and the public, that the &quot;Capriccio&quot; is a &quot;magnificently orchestrated piece&quot; — is wrong. The &quot;Capriccio&quot; is a brilliant &quot;composition for the orchestra&quot;. The change of timbres, the felicitous choice of melodic designs and figuration patterns, exactly suiting each kind of instrument, brief virtuoso cadenzas for instruments solo, the rhythm of the percussion instruments, etc., constitute here the very &quot;essence&quot; of the composition and not its garb or orchestration. The Spanish themes, of dance character, furnished me with rich material for putting in use multiform orchestral effects. All in all, the &quot;Capriccio&quot; is undoubtedly a purely external piece, but vividly brilliant for all that. It was a little less successful in its third section (Alborada, in B-flat major), where the brasses somewhat drown the melodic designs of the woodwinds; but this is very easy to remedy, if the conductor will pay attention to it and moderate the indications of the shades of force in the brass instruments by replacing the fortissimo by a simple forte.

==In popular culture==
* The work is played during the opening credits and as the Spanish Carnival background music during Josef von Sternberg&#x27;s film &quot;The Devil Is a Woman&quot; (1935), credited on screen as &#x27;Music based on Rimsky-Korsakoff&#x27;s &quot;Spanish Caprice&quot; and Old Spanish Melodies&#x27;.
* Excerpts were heard in the fictional 1947 biopic of Rimsky-Korsakov, &quot;Song of Scheherazade&quot;.
* A recording by the Moscow Radio Symphony in the film &quot;Women on the Verge of a Nervous Breakdown&quot; (1988).
* A recording by &quot;Philharmonia Slavonica&quot; featured in the film &quot;Brokeback Mountain&quot; (2005). The &quot;Philharmonia Slavonica&quot; is a pseudonymous group that appears on a number of recordings of the bargain-record producer Alfred Scholz. The performances attributed to them are often by the Austrian Radio (ORF) Orchestra.
* The work&#x27;s fourth movement is featured prominently in a 1998 television commercial for Pizza Hut, famously starring the former leader of the Soviet Union, Mikhail Gorbachev.
* An orchestra performs the opening of the piece in the series &quot;Little Fires Everywhere&quot; (2020).

==Ballet Adaptations==
* &quot;Capriccio Espagnol&quot; choreographed by Leonid Massine in collaboration with Argentinita with Scenery and Costumes by Mariano Andreu.

<text>Schönbrunn Zoo (; also simply called Vienna Zoo) is a 17-hectare (42-acre) zoo in the city of Vienna, Austria. Established in 1752, it is the world&#x27;s oldest zoo still in operation. It is also a UNESCO World Heritage Site, being a part of the Schönbrunn Palace gardens. It generally receives more than 2 million visitors every year.

As of 2021, it presented a total of 707 different species with around 8,250 specimens. Its primary attractions include the giant pandas, being one of only 27 zoos in the world to house them.

Anthony Sheridan&#x27;s zoo rankings recognised Schönbrunn Zoo as the best zoo in Europe in years 2008, 2010, 2012, 2014, 2018 and 2021. Zoologist Stephan Hering-Hagenbeck has been the zoo&#x27;s director since 2019.

==History==
=== Founding and early years ===
Schönbrunn Zoo was the brainchild of Francis Stephen of Lorraine, the husband of Maria Theresa, the empress of the Habsburg monarchy at the time. In 1745, Francis Stephen commissioned the architect Jean Nicolas Jadot de Ville-Issey to design a menagerie in the park at the Habsburg-Lorraine&#x27;s summer residence in Schönbrunn.

Twelve enclosures were created in the park, each with equally sized structures for the animals, as well as an administration building with a front garden. A pond and two yards were added later. After approximately one year of construction, the menagerie was unveiled to guests in the summer of 1752. The last section to be completed was the octagonal pavilion at the heart of the site, which was designed as a breakfast and social room and finished in 1759. This pavilion, which still serves as the zoo&#x27;s historical center, has been used as a restaurant since 1949.

The first elephant, an Indian elephant, arrived at the zoo in 1770, and the first predators—wolves and bears—arrived in 1781. Polar bears, big cats, hyenas, and kangaroos joined the collection around 1800, along with another pair of Asian elephants. Initially, the menagerie was reserved for the imperial family. Later, access was extended to schools, diplomats, and private guests. In 1778, the menagerie, along with the palace and park, was opened to &quot;decently dressed persons&quot; on Sundays. By this time, the zoo had begun welcoming visitors on a daily basis, attracting not only locals from Vienna and the surrounding areas but also international guests. The exotic animals and detailed descriptions in early zoo guides drew widespread interest.

=== In the 19th century ===
In 1828, Schönbrunn Zoo received its first giraffe as a gift from the Viceroy of Egypt. Its arrival sparked a widespread fascination, influencing fashion, handicrafts, and social life in Vienna. Giraffe motifs adorned clothes, shoes, and utensils, while new hairstyles, a perfume, a theatrical play, and two musical compositions inspired by the giraffe were created.

The zoo underwent significant changes toward the end of the 19th century. Alois Kraus, who served as director from 1879 to early 1919, reorganized the historic grounds to better accommodate the animals and improve the visitor experience. New animal enclosures and farm buildings were constructed or modernized, and the zoo was expanded to the east and south. By the early 20th century, Schönbrunn Zoo was widely regarded as one of the most beautiful zoos in the world.

In 1906, the first elephant to be conceived in a zoological garden was born on its grounds.

The complex remained the private property of the imperial family until the dissolution of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in 1918.

=== World Wars and the 20th century ===
Only 400 animals survived World War I due to supply shortages and associated hygiene problems. The zoo was able to endure thanks to the residents of Vienna, who organized a relief campaign and donated animals and materials to sustain the institution.

Otto Antonius, who served as director of Schönbrunn Zoo from 1924 to 1945, was the first biologist to lead the zoo. Under his leadership, the number of animals increased to more than 3,000 by 1930. Antonius introduced the concept of breeding endangered species for conservation and worked to raise public awareness about nature preservation. He strengthened relationships with the media, universities, and museums to promote the zoo&#x27;s mission. Notably, the term &quot;menagerie&quot; was officially replaced with &quot;zoo&quot; in 1926 to reflect its modernized role in education and conservation.

At the end of World War II, the zoo suffered severe damage from aerial bombings, which destroyed or significantly damaged many enclosures. More than 1,000 animals died during this time. The Soviet and later British occupation forces assisted in the zoo&#x27;s reconstruction efforts after the war.

Julius Brachetka, director from 1945 to 1958, revived public interest through entertaining media appearances often featuring animals from the zoo. The first promotional posters were created during this period, and photography competitions were introduced to engage visitors. In 1959, a new aquarium and terrarium building was opened to replace structures for ostriches and reptiles that had been destroyed during the bombing.

Under the leadership of Walter Fiedler from 1967 to 1987, the zoo&#x27;s original area was doubled to 12 hectares with the conversion of the &quot;Kleinen Fasangarten&quot; (Little Pheasant Garden) to the east. Significant milestones during this time included the opening of a children&#x27;s zoo in 1969 and the establishment of one of Europe&#x27;s first zoo education departments in 1976. 

By the late 1980s, criticism of outdated animal husbandry practices had reached a peak. Proposals to close the zoo or relocate it to another district of Vienna were actively discussed. However, these discussions ended in 1991, after which the zoo was restructured as Schönbrunner Tiergarten-Ges.m.b.H., a private entity managed separately from federal administration. The Republic of Austria remained the sole shareholder.

Helmut Pechlaner, a veterinarian and former director of Alpenzoo Innsbruck, was appointed managing director. With support from the Austrian government, numerous donors, and sponsors, he oversaw the modernization and expansion of the zoo. The first completed project was the small monkey house in 1992, featuring two &quot;monkey islands&quot; in the baroque pond as outdoor enclosures for ring-tailed lemurs and gibbons. Additional expansions included a section of the Vienna Woods to the south, the Tirolerhof (Tyrolean Farmyard), a modern elephant park, enclosures for big cats and giant pandas, an insectarium, and one of Europe&#x27;s largest rhino enclosures, which housed two Indian rhinos, gifted in 2006 by Nepal&#x27;s former royal family. These rhinos had been orphaned and were unable to be reintegrated into the wild.

The ensemble of Schönbrunn Palace, Zoo and Palace Park was declared a UNESCO World Heritage Site in 1996. The same year saw the unveiling of the first large bronze sculpture by Gottfried Kumpf, a lion. More bronze sculptures that remain a popular photo motif to this day were added over the following decades. The Rainforest House was opened to celebrate the zoo&#x27;s 250th anniversary in 2002, which was also the year in which the first koalas arrived at Schönbrunn and the panorama railway experience was opened.

=== Recent years ===
Dagmar Schratter succeeded Helmut Pechlaner as sole managing director on January 1, 2007, and held the position until the end of 2019. During her tenure, the zoo received five awards recognizing it as the best in Europe, celebrated the birth of five giant panda cubs, and achieved a record 2.6 million visitors in 2008. Stephan Hering-Hagenbeck, formerly of Tierpark Hagenbeck in Hamburg, was introduced as her successor in autumn 2019 and assumed the role in January 2020.

== Exhibits ==
=== Polar Bear World - Franz Josef Land ===
The polar bear exhibit is located in the Franz Josef Land facility, which features a pool that allows visitors to observe the bears swimming underwater. The facility spans 1,700 square metres. The name pays tribute to the successful expedition to the Arctic achieved by Austria-Hungary in the 1870s. The visitor centre, known as the Polar Dome, has been designated an &quot;Arctic Ambassador Centre&quot; by Polar Bears International.

=== Polarium ===
The Polarium, for cold water animals, is home to South American sea lions and penguins. Through a 13-metre-long pool window, one can see the maned seals swimming. During feeding sessions, the animals climb onto the rocks and jump into the water to catch fish.

For the king and rockhopper penguins, the seasonal light and climate conditions of their native habitats are simulated: approximately 10°C indoors and 8°C in the water.

=== Rainforest House ===
The Rainforest House exhibit opened in 2002, marking the zoo&#x27;s 250th anniversary. Inside the glass house is an imitation of a mountain slope from a Southeast Asian rainforest. This area houses rare species such as the northern river terrapin, Asian small-clawed otters, various birds, flying foxes, and Fiji banded iguanas. Temperatures are maintained at a minimum of 25 °C, and humidity remains above 80% year-round. After more than 20 years of exposure to humid conditions, the Rainforest House requires extensive renovation. It is scheduled to reopen in 2025 with a new concept.

=== &quot;ORANG.erie&quot; ===
Now called the &quot;ORANG.erie&quot;, the first Palm House, which was built in the 19th century under Emperor Franz Joseph I and used as a film studio from 1920, was revitalised in 2009 and has been home to the orangutans since then. Reproductions of the works by Nonja, a female orangutan, are on display at &quot;Atelier Nonja&quot;, the adjacent café-restaurant. Nonja is famous for the paintings she created with the paints and brushes given to her in the 1990s.

=== Insectarium ===
The Insectarium opened in 2005 and originally displayed insects known for their camouflage and deceptive abilities in 14 different terrariums. In 2023, remodeling began. Upon completion, the house will provide shelter primarily for reptiles rescued by the zoo from the illegal wildlife trade.

=== Aquarium and Terrarium House ===
Visitors enter the Aquarium and Terrarium House through the crocodile pavilion. Species kept in the aquarium include piranhas, lionfish, moray eels, jellyfish, and rays, as well as a large coral reef with hundreds of Indo-Pacific fish. A tunnel aquarium with arapaimas leads to the terrarium building where snakes, iguanas, Aldabra giant tortoises, and other reptiles reside.

The construction of the new Schönbrunn Conservation Aquarium at the site of the existing aquarium near the entrance at Hietzing is set to begin in 2025. A new building is necessary as the existing structure has reached the end of its service life, and refurbishment was considered impractical for both operational and economic reasons. The aquarium, which will be the biggest in Austria, will provide insights into the conservation breeding of critically endangered species outside of their natural habitats, further emphasizing the zoo&#x27;s commitment to wildlife conservation. The new Schönbrunn Conservation Aquarium is scheduled to open in 2028.

=== Tirolerhof ===
The Haidachhof, a two-storey Lower Inn Valley farmhouse dating back to 1722, is a listed building that was dismantled at its original location in Brandenberg, Tyrol, and rebuilt at the zoo. Endangered breeds of farm animals such as Tux-Zillertal, Pustertaler Sprinzen, Noriker horses, Carinthian sheep, Original Braunvieh, Tauernsheck goats and Sulmtaler chickens have been kept here in the stables since then.

=== Nature Discovery Trail ===
The Nature Discovery Trail is a path leading from the Tirolerhof up to 10 metres into the tree canopy, allowing visitors to observe native bird species. The forest path continues past outdoor terrariums with native reptiles and amphibians. The world of native fish is presented in large aquariums in the &#x27;Am Wasser&#x27; (At the Waterside) section.

=== South America Park ===
Giant anteaters, capybaras, vicuñas and greater rhea are exhibited together in the South America Park. The outdoor area has been laid out to resemble a pampas landscape with hills and ponds.

=== Pet Park ===
The Pet Park nearby keeps small domestic animals such as the guinea pig that visitors are allowed to interact with.

=== Big Cat House ===
The Big Cat House houses indoor enclosures for Amur leopards and Siberian tigers. Each species enjoys a large landscaped outdoor area adjacent to the building, including raised platforms, ponds, and shrubs for concealment. 

=== Birdhouse ===
The Birdhouse features two halls presenting different landscapes and their native wildlife: the African savannah and the South American tropics with dozens of birds in a lush jungle of plants. The central hall is home to the zoo&#x27;s Linnaeus&#x27;s two-toed sloths.

=== Rat House ===
The Rat House is home to fancy rats and Gambian pouched rats. Special lighting technology has been installed to adapt the rhythms of the day and night so that visitors may observe the nocturnal rodents climbing, bathing and burrowing.

=== Monkey House ===
The historic Monkey House building, which dates back to 1841, is home to king colobus, meerkats, red ruffed lemurs, pygmy marmosets, common squirrel monkeys, emperor tamarins, and Goeldi&#x27;s marmosets.

=== Rhino Park ===
Two Indian rhinos reside in Rhino Park, which spans 6,000 square metres, alongside other Asian native species such as nilgais, Indochinese sika deer and blackbucks.

=== Giraffe House ===
The historic Giraffe House was restored in 2017. A winter garden was added at the rear of the building to provide additional space for the giraffes during the winter months. The photovoltaic system incorporated into the glass roof produces all the electricity needed for the enclosure. A layer of gravel in the basement stores heat accumulated during the day for night-time heating. The zoo received the City of Vienna&#x27;s environmental prize for its use of these technologies.

=== East Africa House ===
The East Africa House is home to smaller species from the same habitat as giraffes, such as common dwarf mongooses, Von der Decken&#x27;s hornbills, which forage together in the wild, and southern ground hornbills, which share the same outdoor enclosure as the giraffes.

=== Giant pandas ===
Schönbrunn Zoo is one of few zoos in Europe that is able to boast giant pandas as an attraction. The female Yang Yang (阳阳, &#x27;Sunshine&#x27;) and the male Long Hui (龙辉, &#x27;Sign of the Dragon&#x27;) arrived in 2003 and are known for successful breeding.

Yang Yang gave birth to the first baby panda (a male) to be conceived naturally and not by artificial insemination in Europe on 23 August 2007. In accordance with traditions in China, it was named 100 days after its birth: Fu Long (福龙, &#x27;Happy Dragon&#x27;). The second baby panda, also a male, was born at Schönbrunn exactly three years after Fu Long&#x27;s birth on 23 August 2010. It was named Fu Hu (福虎, &#x27;Happy Tiger&#x27;). A third panda cub, another male, was born on 14 August 2013. It was named Fu Bao (福豹, &#x27;Happy Leopard&#x27;). These were followed by twins, which were born on 7 August 2016, and named Fu Feng (福凤, &#x27;Happy Phoenix&#x27;) and Fu Ban (福伴, &#x27;Happy Companion&#x27;). Yang Yang was the first panda in captivity to raise twins without the help of her keepers. The cubs were transferred to China to zoos or panda breeding stations at the age of two. 

Long Hui died in December 2016 as a result of a tumour.

A new male panda, Yuan Yuan, arrived at the zoo in April 2019.

The research cooperation was extended for another ten years in 2024. That September, the pair living at Schönbrunn Zoo returned to China to spend their retirement there. A new pair of pandas is expected to arrive at the zoo at the beginning of 2025.

=== Desert House ===
The Desert House is located just outside the zoo entrance, opposite the Palm House. A circuit trail leads through a desert habitat with rattlesnakes, naked mole-rats, vibrant birds, and other desert creatures. The botanical focus includes cacti and other succulents.

== Wildlife conservation projects ==
Schönbrunn Zoo participates in international breeding programmes for the purposes of wildlife conservation. It is responsible here within the scope of the EAZA Ex-situ Programme for maintaining the studbook for the southern and northern rockhopper penguins as well as the Fiji banded iguana.

=== Giant pandas ===
Schönbrunn Zoo cooperates with the China Wildlife Conservation Association (CWCA) in its efforts to protect giant pandas. Joint research activities, conservation breeding, regular training courses, the establishment of panda reserves and the reforestation of bamboo forests are regarded as some of the most important pillars of the project.

=== Northern bald ibis ===
Schönbrunn Zoo is a partner to the team that is working within a European Life+ project to reintroduce the northern bald ibis, which is a highly endangered species, to central Europe. These birds&#x27; chicks that are hatched in zoos and wildlife parks are imprinted on human foster parents, who then use ultralight aircraft to teach the birds how to navigate to suitable overwintering quarters.

=== Northern river terrapin ===
Northern river terrapins belong to the three rarest species of turtle in the world. Schönbrunn Zoo was the first to successfully breed these terrapins in captivity in 2010. The zoo has – in addition to its important breeding efforts – also initiated a rescue mission in Bangladesh.

=== Polar bears ===
The zoo supports Polar Bears International (PBI), an initiative to save polar bears. The PBI researches how polar bears live in their native habitats. Transmitters are fitted to animals in the wild to track their migratory routes, which have changed due to the disappearing pack ice.

=== Barbary apes ===
The zoo also supports the Barbary Macaque Awareness and Conservation (BMAC) wildlife conservation project in Morocco, which runs educational programmes and is working to reintroduce illegally captured Barbary macaques to the wild.

=== Brasilian tapirs ===
As part of a research project in the Pantanal in South America, collar transmitters provide information about what tapirs need to survive. The project also keeps local residents informed about the animal world.

=== Pond turtles ===
European pond turtles are the only species of turtle that is native to Austria. The zoo is working with the Donau-Auen National Park, where the last intact population in Austria lives, to protect the clutches.

=== Bearded vultures ===
Bearded vultures were wiped out at the beginning of the 20th century. Animals have been successfully reintroduced from breeding programmes such as those that have taken place at Schönbrunn Zoo since the 1980s.

=== Ural owl ===
Habitat loss resulted in the extinction of the Ural owl in Austria. Living conditions have improved again and so a decision was made to launch a reintroduction project, which Schönbrunn Zoo is supporting with, among other things, chicks from its breeding programmes. Several hundred birds have already been released into the wild.

== Significant breeding successes ==
The five giant panda cubs were the first in Europe to be born as a result of natural conception. Yang Yang was the world&#x27;s first panda in captivity to raise twins without help from her keepers.

A female anteater was also able to successfully raise her twins for the first time in the world at a zoo in 2000.

The first elephant calf to be conceived with the help of artificial insemination using frozen semen was born at the zoo in 2013.

Schönbrunn Zoo is the only zoo in Europe to successfully breed the endangered northern rockhopper penguins every year.

<doc id="362970" wikidata="Q2723010" url="?curid=362970" title="Dipropyltryptamine">
<text>&quot;N,N&quot;-Dipropyltryptamine (DPT) is a psychedelic entheogen belonging to the tryptamine family. Use as a designer drug has been documented by law enforcement officials since as early as 1968. However, potential therapeutic use was not investigated until the 1970s. It is found either as a crystalline hydrochloride salt or as an oily or crystalline base. It has not been found to occur endogenously. It is a close structural homologue of dimethyltryptamine and diethyltryptamine.

Frequent physical effects are nausea, numbness of the tongue or throat, and pupil dilation.

== Pharmacology ==
Studies on rodents have found that the effectiveness with which a selective 5-HT2A receptor antagonist blocks the behavioral actions of this compound strongly suggests that the 5-HT2A receptor is an important site of action for DPT, but the modulatory actions of a 5-HT1A receptor antagonist also imply a 5-HT1A-mediated component to the actions of DPT.

== Chemistry ==
DPT changes Ehrlich&#x27;s reagent violet and causes the marquis reagent to turn yellow.

== Psychedelic properties ==
While dipropyltryptamine is chemically similar to dimethyltryptamine (DMT), its psychoactive effects are markedly different.

== Side effects ==
Negative side effects of human consumption of this drug may include increased heart rate, dizziness, anxiety, panic, confusion, paranoia, delusions, seizure (uncommon) and nausea. The use of dipropyltryptamine has been implicated in at least one death due to seizures, although details are lacking and the drug has not officially been established as the sole cause of death.

<text>The culture of Malta has been influenced by various societies that have come into contact with the Maltese Islands throughout the centuries, including neighbouring Mediterranean cultures, and the cultures of the nations that ruled Malta for long periods of time prior to its independence in 1964.

==History==

===The culture of prehistoric Malta===

The earliest inhabitants of the Maltese Islands are believed to have been Sicani from nearby Sicily who arrived on the island sometime before 5000 BC. They grew cereals and raised domestic livestock and, in keeping with many other ancient Mediterranean cultures, formed a fertility cult represented in Malta by statuettes of unusually large proportions. Pottery from the earliest period of Maltese civilization (known as the Għar Dalam phase) is similar to examples found in Agrigento, Sicily. These people were either supplanted by, or gave rise to a culture of megalithic temple builders, whose surviving monuments on Malta and Gozo are considered the oldest standing stone structures in the world. The temples date from 4000 to 2500 BC and typically consist of a complex trefoil design.

Little is known about the temple builders of Malta and Gozo; however, there is some evidence that their rituals included animal sacrifice. This culture disappeared from the Maltese Islands around 2500 BC and was replaced by a new influx of Bronze Age immigrants, a culture that is known to have cremated its dead and introduced smaller megalithic structures called dolmens to Malta, probably imported by Sicilian population because of the similarity of Maltese dolmens with similar constructions found in the largest island of the Mediterranean sea.

===The development of modern Maltese culture===
The culture of modern Malta has been described as a &quot;rich pattern of traditions, beliefs and practices,&quot; which is the result of &quot;a long process of adaptation, assimilation and cross fertilization of beliefs and usages drawn from various conflicting sources.&quot; It has been subjected to the same complex, historic processes that gave rise to the linguistic and ethnic admixture that defines who the people of Malta and Gozo are today.

Present-day Maltese culture is essentially Latin European with the recent British legacy also in evidence. In the early part of its history, Malta was also exposed to Semitic-speaking communities. The present-day legacy of this is linguistic rather than cultural. The Latin European element is the major source of Maltese culture because of the virtually continuous cultural impact on Malta over the past eight centuries and the fact that Malta shares the religious beliefs, traditions and ceremonies of its Sicilian and Southern European neighbors.

====Sources of Semitic influence====
=====Phoenicians=====
The Phoenicians inhabited the Maltese Islands from around 700 BCE, and made extensive use of their sheltered harbours. By 480 BCE, with the ascendancy of Carthage in the western Mediterranean, Malta became a Punic colony. Phoenician origins have been suggested for the Maltese people and their customs since 1565. A genetic study carried out by geneticists Spencer Wells and Pierre Zalloua of the American University of Beirut argued that more than 50% of Y-chromosomes from Maltese men may have Phoenician origins.
However, it is noted that this study is not peer-reviewed and is contradicted by major peer-reviewed studies, which prove that the Maltese share common ancestry with Southern Italians, having negligible genetic input from the Eastern Mediterranean or North Africa.

Algerian legend claims that the ancestors of the present Maltese, together with the first Algerians, fled from their original homeland of Aram, with some choosing to settle in Malta and others in North Africa, which would suggest that the prototypical Maltese culture had Aramaean origins. Another tradition suggests that the Maltese are descended from shepherd tribes who fled Bethlehem in the face of an advancing enemy, set sail from Jaffa, and settled in Malta. There is also some evidence that at least one North African tribe, the Oulad Said, claim that they share common ancestry with the Maltese.

=====Aghlabid conquest=====

This period coincided with the golden age of Moorish culture and included innovations like the introduction of crop rotation and irrigation systems in Malta and Sicily, and the cultivation of citrus fruits and mulberries. Then capital city Mdina, originally called &quot;Maleth&quot; by the Phoenicians, was at this time refortified, surrounded with a wide moat and separated from its nearest town, Rabat. This period of Arabic influence followed the conquest of Malta, Sicily and Southern Italy by the Aghlabids. It is presently evident in the names of various Maltese towns and villages and in the Maltese language, a genetic descendant of Siculo-Arabic. It is noted that, during this period, Malta was administered from Palermo, Sicily, as part of the Emirate of Sicily. Genetic studies indicate that the Arabs who colonised Malta in this period were in fact Arabic-speaking Sicilians.,

It is difficult to trace a continuous line of cultural development during this time. A proposed theory that the islands were sparsely populated during Fatimid rule is based on a citation in the French translation of the &quot;Rawd al-mi&#x27;ṭār fī khabar al-aqṭār&quot; (&quot;The Scented Garden of Information about Places&quot;). Al-Himyari describes Malta as generally uninhabited and visited by Arabs solely for the purpose of gathering honey and timber and catching fish. No other chronicles make similar descriptions and this claim is not universally accepted.
Up to two hundred years after Count Roger the Norman conquered the island, differences in the customs and usages of the inhabitants of Malta were distinct from those in other parts of the Kingdom of Two Sicilies: &quot;moribus d&#x27;aliis de vivunt d&#x27;ipsarum d&#x27;insularum de homines et constitutionibus, nostri Sicilie&quot;.

The marble gravestone of a Saracen girl named Majmuna (pr. &quot;My-moona&quot;), found in a pagan temple in the Xewkija area of Gozo dates back to 1173. Written in Kufic, it concludes saying, &quot;You who read this, see that dust covers my eyelids, in my place and in my house, nothing but sadness and weeping; what will my resurrection be like?&quot;

The population of Malta at that time amounted to no more than 1,119 households, of whom 836 were described as Saracens, inhabiting the island following the Norman invasion and before their ultimate expulsion.

=====Jewish presence=====

A number of Jewish families resided in Malta almost consistently from approximately 1500 BCE to the 1492 Edict of Expulsion, and again from the time of the Knights of Malta through to the present. This is yet another source of Semitic influence in Maltese culture.

According to local legend, the earliest Jewish residents arrived in Malta some 3,500 years ago, when the seafaring tribes of Zebulon and Asher accompanied the ancient Phoenicians in their voyages across the Mediterranean. The earliest evidence of a Jewish presence on Malta is an inscription in the inner apse of the southern temple of Ġgantija (3600–2500 BC) in Xagħra, which says, in the Phoenician alphabet: &quot;To the love of our Father Jahwe&quot;. There is evidence of a Jewish community on Malta during the Roman period, in the form of carved menorahs the catacombs in Malta. Members of the Malta&#x27;s Jewish community are known to have risen to the highest ranks of the civil service during the period of Arab occupation, including the rank of Vizier. By 1240, according to a report prepared for Emperor Frederick II, there were 47 Christian and 25 Jewish families on Malta, and 200 Christian and 8 Jewish families on Gozo.

Unlike the Jewish experience in the rest of Europe, throughout the Middle Ages the Jews of Malta generally resided among the general population rather than in ghettos, frequently becoming landowners. The Jewish population of Malta had flourished throughout the period of Norman rule, such that one third of the population of Malta&#x27;s ancient capital, Mdina, is said to have been Jewish.In 1492, in response to the Alhambra Decree the Royal Council had argued – unsuccessfully – that the expulsion of the Jews would radically reduce the total population of the Maltese Islands, and that Malta should therefore be treated as a special case within the Spanish Empire. Nonetheless, the decree of expulsion was signed in Palermo on 18 June 1492, giving the Jewish population of Malta and Sicily three months to leave. Numerous forced conversions to Catholicism, or exile, followed. Evidence of these conversions can be found in many Maltese family names that still survive today, such as the families &quot;Abela&quot;, &quot;Ellul&quot;, &quot;Salamone&quot;, &quot;Mamo&quot;, &quot;Cohen&quot;, and &quot;Azzopardi&quot;.

A much smaller Jewish community developed under the rule of the Knights of Malta, but this consisted primarily of slaves and emancipated slaves. Under the rule of certain Grandmasters of the Order, the Jews were made to reside in Valletta&#x27;s prisons at night, while by day they remained free to transact business, trade and commerce among the general population.

Local place names around the island, such as &quot;Bir Meyru&quot; (Meyer&#x27;s Well), &quot;Ġnien il-Lhud&quot; (The Jew&#x27;s Garden) and &quot;Ħal Muxi&quot; (Moshé&#x27;s Farm) attest to the endurance of Jewish presence in Malta.

=====Slaves in Malta=====
Exposure to Semitic influences continued to a limited extent during the 268-year rule of the Knights of St. John over Malta, due in part to trade between the Knights and North Africa, but primarily due to the large numbers of slaves present in Malta during the 17th and 18th centuries: upwards of 2,000 at any given time (or about 5 per cent of the population of Malta), of whom 40–45 per cent were Moors, and the remainder Turks, Africans and Jews. There were so many Jewish slaves in Malta during this time that Malta was frequently mentioned for its large enslaved Jewish population in Jewish literature of the period.

The slaves were engaged in various activities, including construction, shipbuilding and the transportation of Knights and nobles by sedan-chair. They were occasionally permitted to engage in their own trades for their own account, including hairdressing, shoe-making and woodcarving, which would have brought them into close contact with the Maltese urban population. Inquisitor Federico Borromeo &quot;(iuniore)&quot; reported in 1653 that:
[slaves] strolled along the street of Valletta under the pretext of selling merchandise, spreading among the women and simple-minded persons any kind of superstition, charms, love-remedies and other similar vanities.
A significant number of slaves converted to Christianity, were emancipated, or even adopted by their Maltese patrons which may have further exposed Maltese culture to their customs.

====Sources of Latin European influence====

=====Roman municipium=====
From 218 BCE to 395 CE, Malta was under Roman political control, initially as a praetorship of Sicily. The islands were eventually elevated to the status of Roman municipium, with the power to control domestic affairs, mint their own money, and send ambassadors to Rome. It was during this period that St. Paul was shipwrecked on the Maltese Islands and introduced Christianity. Few archeological relics survive in Malta today from the Roman period, the sole exception being the Roman Domus, just outside the walls of Mdina. From a cultural perspective, the Roman period is notable for the arrival in Malta of several highly placed Roman families, whose progeny form part of the Maltese nation today. These include the Testaferrata family (originally, &quot;Capo di Ferro&quot;), today one of Malta&#x27;s premier noble families.

Whether the origins of Maltese culture can be found in the Eastern Mediterranean or North Africa, the impact on Malta of Punic culture is believed to have persisted long after the Island&#x27;s incorporation into the Roman Republic in 218 BCE:
 ... at least during the first few centuries of Roman rule, tradition, customs and language were still Punic despite romanization of the place. This is in agreement with what can be read in the Acts of the Apostles, which call the Maltese &quot;barbarians&quot;, that is using a language that was neither Greek nor Latin, but Punic.
With the division of the Roman Empire, in 395 CE, Malta was given to the eastern portion ruled from Constantinople and this new colonization introduced Greek families to the Maltese collective, bringing with them various superstitions, proverbs, and traditions that exist within Maltese culture today.

=====Catholicism=====
It is said that in Malta, Gozo, and Comino there are more than 365 churches, or one church for every 1,000 residents. The parish church (Maltese: &quot;il-parroċċa&quot;, or &quot;il-knisja parrokjali&quot;) is the architectural and geographic focal point of every Maltese town and village, and its main source of civic pride. This civic pride manifests itself in spectacular fashion during the local village festas, which mark the feast day of the patron saint of each parish with marching bands, religious processions, special Masses, fireworks (especially petards), and other festivities.

Making allowances for a possible break in the appointment of bishops to Malta during the period of the Fatimid conquest, the Maltese Church is referred to today as the only extant Apostolic See other than Rome itself. According to tradition and as recorded in the Acts of the Apostles, the Church in Malta was founded by St. Paul in AD 70, following his shipwreck on these Islands. The earliest Christian place of worship in Malta is said to be the cavern in Rabat Malta, now known as St. Paul&#x27;s Grotto, where the apostle was imprisoned during his stay on Malta. There is evidence of Christian burials and rituals having taken place in the general vicinity of the Grotto, dating back to the 3rd century AD.

Further evidence of Christian practices and beliefs during the period of Roman persecution can be found in the many catacombs that lie beneath various parts of Malta, including St Paul&#x27;s Catacombs and St Agatha&#x27;s Catacombs in Rabat, just outside the walls of Mdina. The latter, in particular, were beautifully frescoed between 1200 and 1480; they were defaced by marauding Turks in the 1550s. There are also a number of cave churches, including the grotto at Mellieħa, which is a Shrine of the Nativity of Our Lady where, according to legend, St. Luke painted a picture of the Madonna. It has been a place of pilgrimage since medieval times.

The writings of classic Maltese historian, Gian. Francesco Abela recount the conversion to Christianity of the Maltese population at the hand of St. Paul. It is suggested that Abela&#x27;s writings were used by Knights of Malta to demonstrate that Malta had been ordained by God as a &quot;bulwark of Christian, European civilization against the spread of Mediterranean Islam.&quot; The native Christian community that welcomed Roger I of Sicily was further bolstered by immigration to Malta from Italy, in the 12th and 13th centuries.

For centuries, leadership over the Church in Malta was generally provided by the Diocese of Palermo, except under Charles of Anjou who caused Maltese bishops to be appointed, as did – on rare occasions – the Spanish and later, the Knights. This continued Malta&#x27;s connections with Sicily and Italy, and contributed to, from the 15th century to the early 20th century, the dominance of Italian as Malta&#x27;s primary language of culture and learning. Since 1808 all bishops of Malta have been Maltese.

During the Norman and Spanish periods and under the rule of the Knights, Malta became the devout Catholic nation it is today. It is worth noting that the Maltese Inquisition (more properly called the Roman Inquisition) had a very long tenure in Malta following its establishment by the Pope in 1530; the last Inquisitor departed from the Islands in 1798, after the Knights capitulated to the forces of Napoleon Bonaparte.

=====The Normans=====

The later years of Norman rule over Malta brought massive waves of immigration to the Islands from Sicily and from the Italian mainland, including clergy and notaries. Sicilian became the sole written language of Malta, as evidenced by notarial deeds from this period, but this was eventually supplanted by Tuscan Italian, which became the primary literary language and the medium of legal and commercial transactions in Malta. A large number of Sicilian and Italian words were adopted into the local vernacular.

Traces of Siculo-Norman architecture can still be found in Malta&#x27;s ancient capital of Mdina and in Vittoriosa, most notably in the Palaces of the &quot;Santa Sofia&quot;, &quot;Gatto Murina&quot;, &quot;Inguanez&quot; and &quot;Falzon&quot; families.

=====Spain=====
Traces of the ascendancy of the Crown of Aragon in the Mediterranean, and Spanish governance over Malta from 1282 to 1530, are still evident in Maltese culture today. These include culinary, religious, and musical influences. Two examples are the enduring importance of the Spanish guitar (Maltese: &quot;il-kitarra Spanjola&quot;) in Maltese folk music, and the enclosed wooden balconies (Maltese: &quot;gallerija&quot;) that grace traditional Maltese homes today. It is also possible that the traditional Maltese costume, the Faldetta, is a local variation of the Spanish mantilla.

The Spanish period also saw the establishment of local nobility, with the creation of Malta&#x27;s oldest extant title, the Barony of Djar-il-Bniet e Buqana, and numerous others. Under Spanish rule Malta developed into a feudal state. From time to time during this period, the Islands were nominally ruled by various Counts of Malta, who were typically illegitimate sons of the reigning Aragonese monarch; however, the day-to-day administration of the country was essentially in the hands of the local nobility, through their governing council known as the &quot;Università&quot;.

Some of Malta&#x27;s premier noble families including the &quot;Inguanez&quot; family, settled in Malta from Spain and Sicily during this time. Other Maltese families of Spanish origin include: &quot;Alagona&quot;, &quot;Aragona&quot;, &quot;Abela&quot;, &quot;Flores&quot;, &quot;Guzman&quot; and &quot;Xerri&quot;.

The period of Spanish rule over Malta lasted roughly as long as the period of Arab rule; however, this appears to have had little impact on the language spoken in rural Malta, which remained heavily influenced by Arabic, with Semitic morphemes. This is evident in Pietro Caxaro&#x27;s &quot;Il-Kantilena&quot;, the oldest known literary text in Maltese, which was written prior to 1485, at the height of the Spanish period.

=====The Knights of St. John=====

The population of Malta increased considerably during the rule of the Knights, from 25,000 in 1535 to over 40,000 in 1621, to over 54,463 in 1632. This was primarily due to immigration from Western Europe, but also due to generally improved health and welfare conditions, and the reduced incidence of raids from North African and Turkish corsairs. By 1798, when the Knights surrendered Malta to the forces of Napoleon Bonaparte, the population of Malta had increased to 114,000.

The period of the Knights is often referred to as Malta&#x27;s Golden Age, as a result of the architectural and artistic embellishment of the Islands by their resident rulers, and as a result of advances in the overall health, education and prosperity of the local population during this period. Music, literature, theatre and the visual arts all flourished in Malta during this period, which also saw the foundation and development of many of the Renaissance and Baroque towns and villages, palaces and gardens of Malta, the most notable of which is the capital city, Valletta.
Contact between the Maltese and the many Sicilian and Italian mariners and traders who called at Valletta&#x27;s busy Grand Harbour expanded under Knights, while at the same time, a significant number of Western European nobles, clerics and civil servants relocated to Malta during this period. The wealth and influence of Malta&#x27;s noble families – many of whom trace their ancestry back to the Norman and Spanish monarchs who ruled Malta prior to the Knights – was also greatly enhanced during this period.

Maltese education, in particular, took a significant leap forward under the Knights, with the foundation, in 1592, of the &quot;Collegium Melitense&quot;, precursor to today&#x27;s University of Malta, through the intercession of Pope Clement VIII. As a result, the University of Malta is one of the oldest extant universities in Europe, and the oldest Commonwealth university outside of the United Kingdom. The School of Anatomy and Surgery was established by Grand Master Fra Nicolás Cotoner at the &quot;Sacra Infermeria&quot; in Valletta, in 1676. The &quot;Sacra Infermeria&quot; itself was known as one of the finest and most advanced hospitals in Europe.

=====Sicily and the Italian mainland=====
Located just to the north, Sicily has provided Malta with a virtually continuous exchange of knowledge, ideas, customs and beliefs throughout history. Many modern Maltese families trace their origins to various parts of Sicily and Southern Italy. The geographic proximity has facilitated a considerable amount of intermarriage, cross-migration, and trade between the two groups of islands. It is likely that this was just as true during the period of Arab domination over Sicily as it has been since the Norman conquest of Sicily in 1060 CE. Accordingly, it is difficult to determine whether some of the Semitic influences on Maltese culture were originally imported to Malta from North Africa, or from Sicily.
The Sicilian influence on Maltese culture is extensive, and is especially evident in the local cuisine, with its emphasis on olive oil, pasta, seafood, fresh fruits and vegetables (especially the tomato), traditional appetizers such as caponata (Maltese: &quot;kapunata&quot;) and rice balls (&quot;arancini&quot;), speciality dishes such as rice timbale (Maltese: &quot;ross fil-forn&quot;), and sweets such as the &quot;cassata&quot; and &quot;kannoli&quot;.

Sicilian influence is also evident in many of the local superstitions, in simple children&#x27;s nursery rhymes, and in the devotion to certain saints, especially St. Agatha. Centuries of dependence on the Diocese of Palermo brought many Sicilian religious traditions to Malta, including the Christmas crib (Maltese: &quot;il-presepju&quot;), the ritual visiting of several Altars of Repose on Good Friday (Maltese: &quot;is-sepulkri&quot;), and the graphic, grim realism of traditional Maltese religious images and sculpture.

Despite Malta&#x27;s rapid transformation into a strategic naval base during the British period, the influence of Italian culture on Malta strengthened considerably throughout the 19th century. This was due in part to increasing levels of literacy among the Maltese, the increased availability of Italian newspapers, and an influx of Italian intelligentsia to Malta. Several leaders of the Italian risorgimento movement were exiled in Malta by the Bourbon monarchs during this period, including Francesco Crispi, and Ruggiero Settimo. Malta was also the proposed destination of Giuseppe Garibaldi when he was ordered into exile; however, this never came to pass. The political writings of Garibaldi and his colleague, Giuseppe Mazzini – who believed that Malta was, at heart, part of the emerging Italian nation – resonated among many of Malta&#x27;s upper- and middle-classes.

=====France=====

French rule over Malta, although brief, left a deep and lasting impression on Maltese culture and society. Several of the Grand Masters of the Knights of Malta had been French, and though some French customs and expressions had crept into common usage in Malta as a result (such as the expressions &quot;bonġu&quot; for &quot;good day&quot;, and &quot;bonswa&quot; for &quot;good evening&quot;, still in use today), Napoleon&#x27;s garrison had a much deeper impact on Maltese culture. Within six days following the capitulation by Grand Master Hompesch on board &quot;l&#x27;Orient&quot;, Bonaparte had given Malta a Constitution and introduced the Republican concept of &quot;Liberté&quot;, &quot;Egalite&quot;, &quot;Fraternité&quot; to Malta. Slavery was abolished, and the scions of Maltese nobility were ordered to burn their patents and other written evidence of their pedigrees before the &quot;arbre de la liberté&quot; that had been hastily erected in St. George&#x27;s Square, at the centre of Valletta. A secondary school system was established, the university system was revised extensively, and a new Civil Code of law was introduced to the legal system of Malta.

Under the rule of General Vaubois civil marriages were introduced to Malta, and all non-Maltese clergymen and women were ordered to leave the Islands. A wholesale plundering of the gold, silver and precious art of Maltese churches followed, and several monasteries were forcibly taken from the religious orders. The Maltese were scandalized by the desecration of their churches. A popular uprising culminated with the &quot;defenestration&quot; of Citizen Masson, commandant of the French garrison, and the summary execution of a handful of Maltese patriots, led by Dun Mikiel Xerri. With the French blockaded behind the walls of Valletta, a National Assembly of Maltese was formed. Petitions were sent out to the King of the Two Sicilies, and to Lord Nelson, soliciting their aid and support. The French garrison capitulated to Nelson in Grand Harbour, on 5 September 1800.

====British Malta====

British rule, from 1800 to 1964, radically and permanently transformed the language, culture and politics of Malta. Malta&#x27;s position in the British Empire was unique in that it did not come about by conquest or by colonization, but at the voluntary request of the Maltese people. Britain found in Malta an ancient, Christian culture, strongly influenced by neighbouring Italy and Sicily, and loyal to the Roman Catholic Church. Malta&#x27;s primary utility to Great Britain lay in its excellent natural harbours and strategic location, and for many decades, Malta was essentially a &quot;fortress colony&quot;.

Throughout the 19th century, Malta benefited from increased defence spending by Britain, particularly from the development of the dockyards and the harbour facilities. The Crimean War and the opening of the Suez Canal further enhanced Malta&#x27;s importance as a supply station and as a naval base. Prosperity brought with it a dramatic rise in the population, from 114,000 in 1842, to 124,000 in 1851, 140,000 in 1870, and double that amount by 1914. Malta became increasingly urbanized, with the majority of the population inhabiting the Valletta and the Three Cities. Malta&#x27;s fortunes waned during times of peace in the early 20th century, and again after World War II, leading to massive waves of emigration.

Although Malta remained heavily dependent on British military spending, successive British governors brought advances in medicine, education, industry and agriculture to Malta. The British legacy in Malta is evident in the widespread use of the English language in Malta today. English was adopted as one of Malta&#x27;s two official languages in 1936, and it has now firmly replaced Italian as the primary language of tertiary education, business, and commerce in Malta.
The British period introduced the Neoclassical style of architecture to Malta, evident in several buildings built during this period, including the parish church of Sta. Marija Assunta in Mosta and St Paul&#x27;s Pro-Cathedral in Valletta, which has a spire dominating the city&#x27;s skyline.
Neo-Gothic architecture was also introduced to Malta during this period, such as in the Chapel of Santa Maria Addolorata at Malta&#x27;s main cemetery, and in the Carmelite Church in Sliema. Sliema itself, which developed from a sleepy fishing village into a bustling, cosmopolitan town during the British period, once boasted an elegant seafront that was famed for its Regency style architecture, that was strongly reminiscent of the British seaside town of Brighton.

=====Impact of World War II=====
Perhaps as an indirect result of the brutal devastation suffered by the Maltese at the hands of Benito Mussolini&#x27;s Regia Aeronautica and the Luftwaffe during World War II, the United Kingdom has replaced neighboring Italy as the dominant source of cultural influences on modern Malta. The George Cross was awarded to the people of Malta by King George VI of the United Kingdom in a letter dated 15 April 1942 to the island&#x27;s Governor Lieutenant-General Sir William Dobbie, so as to &quot;bear witness to the heroism and devotion of its people&quot; during the great siege it underwent in the early parts of World War II. The George Cross is woven into the flag of Malta and can be seen wherever the flag is flown.

The &quot;culture clash&quot; between pro-British and pro-Italian elements in Malta reached its apex in February 1942, when British Governor Lieutenant-General Sir William Dobbie ordered the deportation of 47 notable Maltese, including Enrico Mizzi, leader of the Nationalist Party, and Sir Arturo Mercieca, Chief Justice of Malta, who were suspected by the Colonial authorities of being sympathetic to the fascist cause. Their exile in Uganda, which lasted until 8 March 1945, was a source of controversy among the Maltese.

=====British traditions in modern Malta=====
British traditions that live on in Malta include an efficient civil service, a military that is based on the British model, a Westminster-style parliamentary structure, a governmental structure premised on the rule of law, and a legal system based on common law. Another British legacy in Malta is the widely popular annual Christmas pantomime at the Manoel Theatre. Most Maltese families have adopted turkey and plum pudding as Christmas treats in place of the more traditional Maltese rooster and cassata.

Due to Malta forming a part of the British Empire in the 19th and 20th centuries, and a considerable amount of intermarriage having taken place during that time period, the existence of British or Irish surnames is increasingly common. Examples include: &quot;Alden&quot;, &quot;Atkins&quot;, &quot;Crockford&quot;, &quot;Ferry&quot;, &quot;Gingell&quot;, &quot;Hall&quot;, &quot;Hamilton&quot;, &quot;Harmsworth&quot;, &quot;Harwood&quot;, &quot;Jones&quot;, &quot;Mattocks&quot;, &quot;Moore&quot;, &quot;O&#x27;Neill&quot;, &quot;Sladden&quot;, &quot;Sixsmith&quot;, &quot;Smith&quot;, &quot;Strickland&quot;, &quot;St. John&quot;, &quot;Turner&quot;, &quot;Wallbank&quot;, &quot;Warrington&quot;, &quot;Kingswell&quot; and &quot;Woods&quot;.

===Contemporary culture of Malta===
==== Emigration and immigration ====

Malta has always been a maritime nation, and for centuries, there has been extensive interaction between Maltese sailors and fishermen and their counterparts around the Mediterranean and into the Atlantic Ocean. More significantly, by the mid-19th century the Maltese already had a long history of migration to various places, including Egypt, Tripolitania, Tunisia, Algeria, Cyprus, the Ionian Islands, Greece, Sicily and Lampedusa. Intermarriage with other nationals (especially Italians and Sicilians) was not uncommon. Migrants would periodically return to Malta, bringing with them new customs and traditions that over time have been absorbed into mainstream Maltese culture.

There was heavy migration from Malta in the early 20th century, and again after World War II until the early 1980s; however the destinations of choice during this period tended to be more distant, English-speaking countries rather than the traditional, Mediterranean littoral. Over 10,000 Maltese settled in Australia, Canada, the United Kingdom and the United States between 1918 and 1920, followed by another 90,000 – or 30 percent of the population of Malta – between 1948 and 1967. By 1996, the net emigration from Malta during the 20th century exceeded 120,000, or 33.5% of the population of Malta.

Emigration dropped dramatically after the mid-1970s and has since ceased to be a social phenomenon of significance. However, since Malta joined the EU in 2004 expatriate communities emerged in a number of European countries particularly in Belgium and Luxembourg.

===Education===

Education is compulsory between the ages of 5 and 16 years. While the state provides education free of charge, the Church and the private sector run a number of schools in Malta and Gozo. Most of the teachers&#x27; salary in Church schools is paid by the state. Education in Malta is based on the British Model.

===Religion===

Today, the Constitution of Malta provides for freedom of religion but establishes Roman Catholicism as the state religion. Freedom House and the &quot;World Factbook&quot; report that 98 percent of the Maltese profess Roman Catholicism as their religion, making Malta one of the most Catholic countries in the world. However, the commissioned by the Church of Malta reports that, as of 2005, only 52.6% of the population attended religious services on a regular basis.

===Languages===

The national language of Malta is Maltese, the only official Semitic language within the European Union. The Maltese alphabet is based on the Latin alphabet, but uses the diacritically altered letters &quot;ż&quot;, also found in Polish, as well as the letters &quot;ċ&quot;, &quot;ġ&quot; and &quot;ħ&quot;. The official languages are Maltese and English. Maltese English is the local dialect of English. Italian, French and German are also widely spoken and taught in secondary schools, though the latter two less so.

===Telecommunications===

Radio shows, television programs and the easy availability of foreign newspapers and magazines throughout the 20th century further extended and enhanced the impact of both British and Italian culture on Malta. Globalization and increased Internet usage (approx. 78.1% of the population of Malta as of September 2005) is having a significant effect on Maltese culture; as of 22 December 2006, Malta had the fourth highest rate of Internet usage in the world.

===Nightlife in Malta===

The long, warm summer nights of Malta lend themselves to a vibrant nightlife, which is at odds with Malta&#x27;s traditional conservatism and the staunch Catholicism of older generations. &quot;Clubbing&quot; and &quot;pub-crawling&quot; – especially in the traffic-free zones of Paceville near St. Julian&#x27;s, and Buġibba – is a rite of passage for Maltese teenagers, young adults and crowds of tourists. Evenings start late and many clubbers continue the festivities into the early hours of the morning. Clubs frequently have large outdoor patios, with local and visiting DJs spinning a mix of Euro-beat, House, chill-out, R&amp;B, hardcore, rock, trance, techno, retro, old school, and classic disco. Pubs, especially Irish pubs, are often the meeting place of choice for the start of a night of clubbing.

Laid back &quot;wine bars&quot; are increasingly popular among young professionals and the more discriminating tourists, and are popping up in the &quot;kantinas&quot; of some of the more picturesque, historic cities and towns, including Valletta and Vittoriosa. They typically offer a mix of local and foreign wines, traditional Maltese appetizer platters, and occasionally, live entertainment.

Despite rapidly increasing tolerance and acceptance of alternative lifestyles, Malta offers its gay and lesbian locals and visitors less nightlife options than other Southern European destinations. With the exception of several staple bars (including &quot;Tom&#x27;s&quot;, Valletta and &quot;Klozett&quot;, Paceville), &quot;gay bars&quot; in Malta have a tendency to pop up, relocate, and disappear from one summer season to the next. However, the local gay population is usually very much in evidence – and welcome – at the mainstream clubs of Paceville and elsewhere.

===Transportation===
Car ownership in Malta is the fourth highest in Europe, given the small size of the islands. Like in the UK, traffic drives on the left.

The old Maltese buses, formerly ex-British Armed forces vehicles, were Malta&#x27;s main domestic mode of transportation until 2011. From then onwards bus services were run by Arriva. There has also been a railway in the past between Valletta and the Mtarfa army barracks.

A regular ferry system connects the two main Maltese islands, via the harbours of Ċirkewwa and Marsamxett in Malta, and Mġarr in Gozo. There are also regular ferry services between the Grand Harbour and neighbouring Sicily. A busy cruise liner terminal has been developed on the Valletta side of Grand Harbour; however, Malta&#x27;s primary connection to the outside world is its airport at Luqa.

==Literature==

===The emergence of Maltese literature===
The oldest extant literary text in the Maltese language is Pietru Caxaro&#x27;s poem, &quot;Il-Kantilena&quot; (circa 1470 to 1485) (also known as &quot;Xidew il-Qada&quot;), followed by Gian Francesco Bonamico&#x27;s sonnet of praise to Grand Master Nicolò Cotoner, &quot;Mejju gie&#x27; bl&#x27;Uard, u Zahar&quot; &quot;(The month of May has arrived, with roses and orange blossoms&quot;), circa 1672. The earliest known Maltese dictionary was written by Francois de Vion Thezan Court (circa 1640). In 1700, an anonymous Gozitan poet wrote &quot;Jaħasra Mingħajr Ħtija&quot; &quot;(Unfortunately Innocent)&quot;. A Maltese translation of the Lord&#x27;s Prayer appeared in Johannes Heinrich Maius&#x27;s work &quot;Specimen Lingua Punicæ in hodierna Melitensium superstitis&quot; (1718). A collection of religious sermons by a certain Dun Ignazio Saverio Mifsud, published between 1739 and 1746, is now regarded as the earliest known Maltese prose. An anonymous poem entitled &quot;Fuqek Nitħaddet Malta&quot; &quot;(I am talking about you, Malta)&quot;, was written circa 1749, regarding the uprising of the slaves of that year. A few years later, in 1752, a catechism entitled &quot;Tagħlim Nisrani ta&#x27; Dun Franġisk Wizzino&quot; &quot;(Don Francesco Wizzino&#x27;s Christian Teachings)&quot; was published in both Maltese and Italian. The occasion of Carnival in 1760 saw the publication of a collection of burlesque verses under the heading &quot;Żwieġ la Maltija&quot; &quot;(Marriage, in the Maltese Style)&quot;, by Dun Feliċ Demarco.

A child of the Romanticism movement, Maltese patriot Mikiel Anton Vassalli (1764–1829) hailed the emergence of literary Maltese as &quot;one of the ancient patrimonies ... of the new emerging nation,&quot; seeing this nascent trend as: (1) the affirmation of the singular and collective identity, and (2) the cultivation and diffusion of the national speech medium as the most sacred component in the definition of the patria and as the most effective justification both for a dominated community&#x27;s claiming to be a nation and for the subsequent struggle against foreign rulers.

Between 1798 and 1800, while Malta was under the rule of Napoleonic France, a Maltese translation of &quot;L-Għanja tat-Trijonf tal-Libertà&quot; &quot;(Ode to the Triumph of Liberty)&quot;, by Citizen La Coretterie, Secretary to the French Government Commissioner, was published on the occasion of Bastille Day.

The first translation into Maltese of a biblical text, the Gospel of St. John. was published in 1822 (trans. Ġużeppi Marija Cannolo), on the initiative of the Bible Society in Malta. The first Maltese language newspaper, &quot;l-Arlekkin Jew Kawlata Ingliża u Maltija&quot; &quot;(The Harlequin, or a mix of English and Maltese)&quot; appeared in 1839, and featured the poems &quot;l-Imħabba u Fantasija&quot; &quot;(Love and Fantasy)&quot; and &quot;Sunett&quot; &quot;(A Sonnett)&quot;.

The first epic poem in Maltese, &quot;Il-Ġifen Tork&quot; &quot;(The Turkish Caravel)&quot;, by Giovanni Antonio Vassallo, was published in 1842, followed by &quot;Ħrejjef bil-Malti&quot; &quot;(Legends in Maltese)&quot; and &quot;Ħrejjef u Ċajt bil-Malti&quot; &quot;(Legends and Jokes in Maltese)&quot; in 1861 and 1863, respectively. The same author published the first history book in the Maltese language, entitled &quot;Storja ta&#x27; Malta Miktuba għall-Poplu&quot; &quot;(The People&#x27;s History of Malta)&quot;, in 1862.

1863 saw the publication of the first novel in Maltese, &quot;Elvira Jew Imħabba ta&#x27; Tirann&quot; &quot;(Elvira, or the Love of a Tyrant)&quot;, by the Neapolitan author, Giuseppe Folliero de Luna. Anton Manwel Caruana&#x27;s novel, &quot;Ineż Farruġ&quot; (1889), was modelled on traditional Italian historical novels, such as Manzoni&#x27;s &quot;I promessi sposi&quot;.

===Diglossia===
The development of native, Maltese literary works has historically been disrupted by diglossia. For many centuries, Maltese was considered &quot;the language of the kitchen and the workshop&quot;, while Italian was the language of literature, law and commerce. Until the early 20th century, the vast majority of literary works by the Maltese were written in Italian, although examples of written Maltese from as far back as the 16th century exist. In early Maltese history, diglossia manifested itself in the co-existence of an ancient Phoenician language and the language of a series of rulers, most notably, Latin, Greek, Arabic, Sicilian, French, Spanish and Italian, and from 1800 onwards, English. The Maltese language today is heavily overlaid with Romance and English influences as a result.

According to Prof. Oliver Friggieri:

Maltese writers developed an uninterrupted local &quot;Italian&quot; literary movement which went on up to about four decades ago, whereas Maltese as a literary idiom started to coexist on a wide scale in the last decades of the 19th century. Whilst Maltese has the historical priority on the level of the spoken language, Italian has the priority of being the almost exclusive written medium, for the socio-cultural affairs, for the longest period. The native tongue had only to wait for the arrival of a new mentality which could integrate an unwritten, popular tradition with a written, academically respectable one.

===Theatre===

The theatres currently in use for live performances in Malta and Gozo range from historic purpose-built structures to modern constructions, to retrofit structures behind historic façades. They host local and foreign artistes, with a calendar of events that includes modern and period drama in both national languages, musicals, opera, operetta, dance, concerts and poetry recitals. The more notable theatrical venues include:

=== Online Video ===
Popular Maltese YouTuber Grandayy rose to popularity posting video memes and note block covers. As of 18 July 2019, he has 2.3 million subscribers on YouTube, 2.6 million followers on Instagram, 781.2K followers on Twitter and 100,137 monthly listeners on Spotify. He is the 1st and 2nd most popular person on social media in Malta, along with his 2nd channel grande1899.

==Visual arts==
The Neolithic temple builders (3800–2500 BCE) endowed the numerous temples of Malta and Gozo with intricate bas relief designs, including spirals evocative of the tree of life and animal portraits, designs painted in red ochre, ceramics, and a vast collection of human form sculptures, particularly the Venus of Malta. These can be viewed at the temples themselves (most notably, the Hypogeum and Tarxien Temples), and at the National Museum of Archaeology in Valletta.

The Roman period introduced highly decorative mosaic floors, marble colonnades and classical statuary, remnants of which are beautifully preserved and presented in the Roman Domus, a country villa just outside the walls of Mdina. The early Christian frescoes that decorate the catacombs beneath Malta reveal a propensity for eastern, Byzantine tastes. These tastes continued to inform the endeavours of medieval Maltese artists, but they were increasingly influenced by the Romanesque and Southern Gothic movements. Towards the end of the 15th century, Maltese artists, like their counterparts in neighbouring Sicily, came under the influence of the School of Antonello da Messina, which introduced Renaissance ideals and concepts to the decorative arts in Malta.

The artistic heritage of Malta blossomed under the Knights of St. John, who brought Italian and Flemish Mannerist painters to decorate their palaces and the churches of these islands, most notably, Matteo Perez d&#x27;Aleccio, whose works appear in the Magisterial Palace and in the Conventual Church of St. John, and Filippo Paladini, who was active in Malta from 1590 to 1595. For many years, Mannerism continued to inform the tastes and ideals of local Maltese artists.

The arrival in Malta of Caravaggio, who painted at least seven works during his 15-month stay on these islands, further revolutionized local art. Two of Caravaggio&#x27;s most notable works, &quot;The Beheading of St. John the Baptist&quot;, and &quot;St. Jerome&quot; are on display in the Oratory of St. John&#x27;s Co-Cathedral, Valletta. His legacy is evident in the works of local artists Giulio Cassarino (1582–1637) and Stefano Erardi (1630–1716). However, the Baroque movement that followed was destined to have the most enduring impact on Maltese art and architecture. The severe, Mannerist interior of St. John&#x27;s Co-Cathedral was transformed into a Baroque masterpiece by the glorious vault paintings of the celebrated Calabrese artist, Mattia Preti. Preti spent the last 40 years of his life in Malta, where he created many of his finest works, now on display in the Museum of Fine Arts, in Valletta. During this period, local sculptor Melchiorre Gafà (1639–1667) emerged as one of the top Baroque sculptors of the Roman School.

Throughout the 18th century, Neapolitan and Rococo influences emerged in the works of Luca Giordano (1632–1705) and Francesco Solimena (1657–1747), and local artists Gio Nicola Buhagiar (1698–1752) and Francesco Zahra (1710–1773). The Rococo movement was greatly enhanced by the relocation to Malta of Antoine de Favray (1706–1798), who assumed the position of court painter to Grand Master Pinto in 1744.

Neo-classicism made some inroads among local Maltese artists in the late 18th century, but this trend was reversed in the early 19th century, as the local Church authorities – perhaps in an effort to strengthen Catholic resolve against the perceived threat of Protestantism during the early days of British rule in Malta – favoured and avidly promoted the religious themes embraced by the Nazarene movement of artists. Romanticism, tempered by the naturalism introduced to Malta by Giuseppe Calì, informed the &quot;salon&quot; artists of the early 20th century, including Edward and Robert Caruana Dingli.

A National School of Art was established by Parliament in the 1920s, and during the reconstruction period that followed the Second World War, the local art scene was greatly enhanced by the emergence of the &quot;Modern Art Group&quot;, whose members included Josef Kalleya (1898–1998), George Preca (1909–1984), Anton Inglott (1915–1945), Emvin Cremona (1919–1986), Frank Portelli (b. 1922), Antoine Camilleri (b. 1922) and Esprit Barthet (b. 1919). Malta has a thriving contemporary arts scene. Valletta was the European Capital of Culture for 2018. Malta has produced a pavilion for the Venice Biennale in 2017 and 1999. There are numerous contemporary arts spaces, such as Blitz and Malta Contemporary Art, which support and nurture Maltese and international artists.

==Traditional crafts==
===Lace making===
Traditional Maltese lace (Maltese: &quot;bizzilla&quot;) is bobbin lace of the filet-guipure variety. It is formed on a lace pillow stuffed with straw, and frequently features the eight-pointed Maltese cross, but not necessarily. Genoese-style leafwork is an essential component of the traditional designs. Nowadays, Malta lace is usually worked on ivory-coloured linen, although historically it was also worked on black or white silk. It is typically used to make tablecloths, placemats and serviettes, and is periodically featured in couture, and in traditional Maltese costume.

Lace making has been prevalent in Malta since the 16th century, and was probably introduced to the Islands at roughly the same time as in Genoa. Lace was included with other articles in a bando or proclamation enacted by Grand Master Ramon Perellos y Roccaful in 1697, aimed at repressing the wearing of gold, silver, jewellery, gold cloth, silks and other materials of value.

There was a resurgence of lace-making in Malta around 1833, which has been attributed to a certain Lady Hamilton-Chichester. Queen Victoria is said to be particularly fond of wearing Malta lace. In 1839, Thomas McGill noted in &quot;A Handbook, or Guide, for Strangers visiting Malta&quot;, that:
&quot;the females of the island make also excellent lace; the lace mitts and gloves wrought by the Malta girls are bought by all ladies coming to the island; orders from England are often sent for them on account of their beauty and cheapness.&quot;
Maltese lace was featured in the Great Exhibition held in London in 1851. Lacemaking is currently taught in Government trade schools for girls, and in special classes organized by the Society of Arts, Manufactures and Commerce. Lacemaking is essentially a cottage industry throughout Malta and Gozo.

===Filigree===
Filigree work (Maltese: &quot;filugranu&quot;) in gold and silver flourished in Malta under the rule of the Knights. This included gold and silver ornamental flower garlands (Maltese: &quot;ganutilja&quot;) and embroidery (Maltese: &quot;rakkmu&quot;). Filigree items that are ubiquitous in Maltese jewellery stores and crafts centres include brooches, pendants, earrings, flowers, fans, butterflies, jewelboxes, miniature &quot;dgħajjes&quot; (fishing boats) and &quot;karrozzini&quot; (horse-drawn cabs), the Maltese Cross and dolphins.

==Sport==
Throughout the 1990s, organized sports in Malta experienced a renaissance through the creation of a number of athletic facilities, including National Stadium and a basketball pavilion in Ta&#x27; Qali, an Athletic Stadium and Tartan Track for athletics, archery, rugby, baseball, softball and netball at Marsa, the National Swimming Pool Complex on University of Malta grounds at Tal-Qroqq, an enclosed swimming pool complex at Marsascala, a mechanized shooting range at Bidnija, and regional sports complexes on Gozo, and in Cottonera and Karwija.

In 1993 and again in 2003, Malta hosted the Games of the Small States of Europe. Since 1968, Malta has also hosted the annual Rolex Middle Sea Race, organized by the Royal Malta Yacht Club. The race consists of a route that starts and finishes in Malta, via the Straits of Messina and the islands of Pantelleria and Lampedusa.

===Football===

Malta&#x27;s &quot;national&quot; sport is football. Many Maltese avidly follow English and Italian matches. Malta also has its own national team; however, every four years the World Cup typically sees Maltese loyalties divided between the teams of England and Italy, and a victory by either of these two teams inevitably leads to spontaneous, and very boisterous street parties and carcades all over the Maltese Islands the Euro 2020 final, played between England and Italy, having led to some of the largest in recent memory. 

===Golf===
The Marsa sports complex includes a 68 par golf course, maintained by the Royal Malta Golf Club

===Boċċi===
Another common sport in Malta is a local variety of the game of bocce or boules (Maltese: boċċi). In Malta, the game is played on a smooth surface covered with coarse-grained sand, with teams of three players. Boċċi clubs are common throughout Malta, but also among the Maltese emigrant communities in Australia, Canada and the United States.

===Waterpolo===
Passion for waterpolo runs high in Malta and Gozo throughout the summer months. Prowess in this particular sport was the impetus for the foundation, in 1925, of a local Amateur Swimming Association, and Malta&#x27;s first participation in the Olympic Games, at the IXth Olympiad in Amsterdam, 1928.

===Horse racing===
Horse racing has a long tradition in Malta. The popular, bareback horse races that take place annually on Saqqajja Hill, in Rabat on 29 June date back to the 15th century. These races form part of the traditional celebrations of the Feast of Saints Peter and Paul (&quot;il-Festa tal-Imnarja&quot;), and were greatly encouraged by the Knights of Malta, especially during the reign of Grand Masters de Verdalle and de Lascaris-Castellar. The Knights took these races very seriously: Bonelli records a proclamation issued by the Grand Masters of the era, which threatened anyone caught interfering with or obstructing a racing horse with forced labour on board the galleys of the Knights. The tradition was revived and strengthened after the First World War under British Governor, Lord Plumer. The racecourse at Marsa, which was founded in 1868, boasted one of the longest tracks in Europe, at one and three quarter miles (2.8 km). The first Marsa races were held on 12 and 13 April 1869.

=== Il-Gostra ===
Il-Gostra is a traditional sport enjoyed in many seaside towns across Malta with its origins dating back to the Middle Ages. The sport involves leaning a large wooden pole (normally 10-16 meters in length) over the ocean and covering it in animal fat. The objective of the game is to grab one of three flags at the end of the pole by running up the greased pole. Each Flag has a different prize, the blue and white flag is dedicated to St Mary, a yellow and white flag representing the Vatican, and Belgium tricolour flag representative of St Julian. The sport is still practiced today and has recently garnered worldwide media attention.

<doc id="362983" wikidata="Q3300648" url="?curid=362983" title="Many-one reduction">
<text>In computability theory and computational complexity theory, a many-one reduction (also called mapping reduction) is a reduction that converts instances of one decision problem (whether an instance is in formula_1) to another decision problem (whether an instance is in formula_2) using a computable function. The reduced instance is in the language formula_2 if and only if the initial instance is in its language formula_1. Thus if we can decide whether formula_2 instances are in the language formula_2, we can decide whether formula_1 instances are in its language by applying the reduction and solving for formula_2. Thus, reductions can be used to measure the relative computational difficulty of two problems. It is said that formula_1 reduces to formula_2 if, in layman&#x27;s terms formula_2 is at least as hard to solve as formula_1. This means that any algorithm that solves formula_2 can also be used as part of a (otherwise relatively simple) program that solves formula_1.

Many-one reductions are a special case and stronger form of Turing reductions. With many-one reductions, the oracle (that is, our solution for formula_2) can be invoked only once at the end, and the answer cannot be modified. This means that if we want to show that problem formula_1 can be reduced to problem formula_2, we can use our solution for formula_2 only once in our solution for formula_1, unlike in Turing reductions, where we can use our solution for formula_2 as many times as needed in order to solve the membership problem for the given instance of formula_1.

Many-one reductions were first used by Emil Post in a paper published in 1944. Later Norman Shapiro used the same concept in 1956 under the name &quot;strong reducibility&quot;.

== Definitions ==

=== Formal languages ===

Suppose formula_22 and formula_23 are formal languages over the alphabets formula_24 and formula_25, respectively. A many-one reduction from formula_22 to formula_23 is a total computable function formula_28 that has the property that each word formula_29 is in formula_22 if and only if formula_31 is in formula_23.

If such a function formula_33 exists, one says that formula_22 is many-one reducible or m-reducible to formula_23 and writes
:formula_36

=== Subsets of natural numbers ===

Given two sets formula_37 one says formula_22 is many-one reducible to formula_23 and writes
:formula_40
if there exists a total computable function formula_33 with formula_42 iff formula_43. 

If the many-one reduction formula_33 is injective, one speaks of a one-one reduction and writes formula_45.

If the one-one reduction formula_33 is surjective, one says formula_22 is recursively isomorphic to formula_23 and writesp.324
:formula_49

=== Many-one equivalence ===

If both formula_40 and formula_51, one says formula_22 is many-one equivalent or m-equivalent to formula_23 and writes
:formula_54

=== Many-one completeness (m-completeness) ===

A set formula_23 is called &quot;many-one complete&quot;, or simply m-complete, iff formula_23 is recursively enumerable and every recursively enumerable set formula_22 is m-reducible to formula_23.

==Degrees==
The relation formula_59 indeed is an equivalence, its equivalence classes are called m-degrees and form a poset formula_60 with the order induced by formula_61.p.257

Some properties of the m-degrees, some of which differ from analogous properties of Turing degrees:pp.555--581
* There is a well-defined jump operator on the m-degrees.
* The only m-degree with jump 0m′ is 0m.
* There are m-degrees formula_62 where there does not exist formula_63 where formula_64.
* Every countable linear order with a least element embeds into formula_60.
* The first order theory of formula_60 is isomorphic to the theory of second-order arithmetic.

There is a characterization of formula_60 as the unique poset satisfying several explicit properties of its ideals, a similar characterization has eluded the Turing degrees.pp.574--575

Myhill&#x27;s isomorphism theorem can be stated as follows: &quot;For all sets formula_68 of natural numbers, formula_69.&quot; As a corollary, formula_70 and formula_71 have the same equivalence classes.p.325 The equivalences classes of formula_71 are called the &quot;1-degrees&quot;.

== Many-one reductions with resource limitations ==

Many-one reductions are often subjected to resource restrictions, for example that the reduction function is computable in polynomial time, logarithmic space, by formula_73 or formula_74 circuits, or polylogarithmic projections where each subsequent reduction notion is weaker than the prior; see polynomial-time reduction and log-space reduction for details.

Given decision problems formula_22 and formula_23 and an algorithm &quot;N&quot; that solves instances of formula_23, we can use a many-one reduction from formula_22 to formula_23 to solve instances of formula_22 in:
* the time needed for &quot;N&quot; plus the time needed for the reduction
* the maximum of the space needed for &quot;N&quot; and the space needed for the reduction

We say that a class C of languages (or a subset of the power set of the natural numbers) is &quot;closed under many-one reducibility&quot; if there exists no reduction from a language outside C to a language in C. If a class is closed under many-one reducibility, then many-one reduction can be used to show that a problem is in C by reducing it to a problem in C. Many-one reductions are valuable because most well-studied complexity classes are closed under some type of many-one reducibility, including P, NP, L, NL, co-NP, PSPACE, EXP, and many others. It is known for example that the first four listed are closed up to the very weak reduction notion of polylogarithmic time projections. These classes are not closed under arbitrary many-one reductions, however.

== Many-one reductions extended ==
One may also ask about generalized cases of many-one reduction. One such example is &quot;e-reduction&quot;, where we consider formula_81 that are recursively enumerable instead of restricting to recursive formula_33. The resulting reducibility relation is denoted formula_83, and its poset has been studied in a similar vein to that of the Turing degrees. For example, there is a jump set formula_84 for &quot;e&quot;-degrees. The &quot;e&quot;-degrees do admit some properties differing from those of the poset of Turing degrees, e.g. an embedding of the diamond graph into the degrees below formula_85.

== Properties ==
* The relations of many-one reducibility and 1-reducibility are transitive and reflexive and thus induce a preorder on the powerset of the natural numbers.
* formula_40 if and only if formula_87
* A set is many-one reducible to the halting problem if and only if it is recursively enumerable. This says that with regards to many-one reducibility, the halting problem is the most complicated of all recursively enumerable problems. Thus the halting problem is r.e. complete. Note that it is not the only r.e. complete problem.
* The specialized halting problem for an &quot;individual&quot; Turing machine &quot;T&quot; (i.e., the set of inputs for which &quot;T&quot; eventually halts) is many-one complete iff &quot;T&quot; is a universal Turing machine. Emil Post showed that there exist recursively enumerable sets that are neither decidable nor m-complete, and hence that &quot;there exist nonuniversal Turing machines whose individual halting problems are nevertheless undecidable&quot;.

== Karp reductions ==
A polynomial-time many-one reduction from a problem &quot;A&quot; to a problem &quot;B&quot; (both of which are usually required to be decision problems) is a polynomial-time algorithm for transforming inputs to problem &quot;A&quot; into inputs to problem &quot;B&quot;, such that the transformed problem has the same output as the original problem. An instance &quot;x&quot; of problem &quot;A&quot; can be solved by applying this transformation to produce an instance &quot;y&quot; of problem &quot;B&quot;, giving &quot;y&quot; as the input to an algorithm for problem &quot;B&quot;, and returning its output. Polynomial-time many-one reductions may also be known as polynomial transformations or Karp reductions, named after Richard Karp. A reduction of this type is denoted by formula_88 or formula_89.

<text>Audie Leon Murphy (20 June 1925 – 28 May 1971) was an American soldier, actor, and songwriter. He was widely celebrated as the most decorated American combat soldier of World War II, and has been described as the most highly decorated enlisted soldier in U.S. history. He received every military combat award for valor available from the United States Army, as well as French and Belgian awards for heroism. Murphy received the Medal of Honor for valor that he demonstrated at age 19 for single-handedly holding off a company of German soldiers for an hour at the Colmar Pocket in France in January 1945, before leading a successful counterattack while wounded.

Murphy was born into a large family of sharecroppers in Hunt County, Texas. After his father abandoned them, his mother died when he was a teenager. Murphy left school in fifth grade to pick cotton and find other work to help support his family; his skill with a hunting rifle helped feed his family.

After the attack on Pearl Harbor in 1941, Murphy&#x27;s older sister helped him to falsify documentation about his birthdate in order to meet the minimum age for enlisting in the military. Turned down initially for being underweight by the Army, Navy, and the Marine Corps, he eventually was able to enlist in the Army. He first saw action in the 1943 Allied invasion of Sicily; then in 1944 he participated in the Battle of Anzio, the liberation of Rome, and the invasion of southern France. Murphy fought at Montélimar and led his men on a successful assault at L&#x27;Omet quarry near Cleurie in northeastern France in October. Despite suffering from multiple illnesses and wounds throughout his service, Murphy became one of the most praised and decorated soldiers of World War II. He is credited with killing 241 enemy soldiers.

After the war, Murphy embarked on a 21-year acting career. He played himself in the 1955 autobiographical film &quot;To Hell and Back&quot;, based on his 1949 memoirs of the same name, but most of his roles were in Westerns. He made guest appearances on celebrity television shows and starred in the series &quot;Whispering Smith&quot;. Murphy was a fairly accomplished songwriter. He bred quarter horses in California and Arizona, and became a regular participant in horse racing.

Because Murphy had what would today be described as post-traumatic stress disorder (PTSD), then known as &quot;battle fatigue&quot;, he slept with a loaded handgun under his pillow. He looked for solace in addictive sleeping pills. In his last few years, he was plagued by money problems but refused offers to appear in alcohol and cigarette commercials because he did not want to set a bad example. Murphy died in a plane crash in Virginia in 1971, shortly before his 46th birthday. He was interred with military honors at Arlington National Cemetery.

==Early life==
Murphy was born on 20 June 1925, in Kingston, a small rural community in Hunt County in northeastern Texas. He was the seventh of twelve children born to Emmett Berry Murphy (1887–1976) and his wife Josie Bell Murphy (&quot;née&quot; Killian; 1891–1941). The Murphys were sharecroppers, of English, Irish, Scots-Irish, Scottish, and German descent. Although Murphy&#x27;s birth date is listed as 1924 in his enlistment papers, his biographer David A. Smith concluded that he was born in 1925, based on statements made by his &quot;To Hell and Back&quot; co-author David McClure, his California driver&#x27;s license, and by Murphy himself.

As a child, Murphy was a loner with mood swings and an explosive temper. He grew up in northeastern Texas around the towns of Farmersville, Greenville, and Celeste, where he attended elementary school. His father drifted in and out of the family&#x27;s life and eventually deserted them. Murphy dropped out of school in fifth grade and got a job picking cotton for a dollar a day () to help support his family; he also became skilled with a rifle, hunting small game to help feed them. After his mother died of endocarditis and pneumonia in 1941, he worked at a radio repair shop and at a combination general store, garage and gas station in Greenville. Hunt County authorities placed his three youngest siblings in Boles Children&#x27;s Home, a Christian orphanage in Quinlan. After the war, he bought a house in Farmersville for his eldest sister Corinne and her husband, Poland Burns. His other siblings briefly shared the home.

The loss of his mother stayed with Murphy throughout his life. He later stated: 

==World War II service==
===Enlistment and basic training===
After the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, he attempted to enlist in the U.S. military, but the Army, Navy, and Marine Corps all turned him down for being underweight and underage. After his sister provided an affidavit that falsified his birth date by a year, he was accepted by the U.S. Army on 30 June 1942. According to his biographer David A. Smith, Murphy acknowledged his birth date was falsified at his enlistment in a 1950 interview with the &quot;Austin Statesman&quot;: &quot;&#x27;The doctor back home couldn&#x27;t remember exactly when I was born,&#x27; he said with a smile, &#x27;so I was 18.&#x27;&quot; 

After basic training at Camp Wolters, he was sent to Fort Meade for advanced infantry training. During basic training, he earned the Marksman Badge with Rifle Component Bar and Expert Badge with Bayonet Component Bar.

===Mediterranean Theater===
Murphy was shipped to Casablanca in French Morocco on 20 February 1943. He was assigned to Company B, 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment, 3rd Infantry Division, which trained under the command of Major General Lucian Truscott. After the 13 May surrender of the Axis forces in French Tunisia, the division was put in charge of the prisoners. He participated as a platoon messenger with his division at Arzew in Algeria in rigorous training for the Allied assault landings in Sicily. Murphy was promoted to private first class on 7 May and corporal on 15 July.

When the 3rd Infantry landed at Licata, Sicily, on 10 July, Murphy was a division runner. On a scouting patrol, he killed two fleeing Italian officers near Canicattì. Sidelined with illness for a week when Company B arrived in Palermo on 20 July, he rejoined them when they were assigned to a hillside location protecting a machine-gun emplacement, while the rest of the 3rd Infantry Division fought at San Fratello en route to the Allied capture of the transit port of Messina.

Murphy participated in Operation Avalanche, the September 1943 mainland Salerno landing at Battipaglia. While on a scouting party along the Volturno river, he and two other soldiers were ambushed; German machine gun fire killed one soldier. Murphy and the other survivor responded by killing five Germans with hand grenades and machine gun fire. While taking part in the October Allied assault on the Volturno Line, near Mignano Monte Lungo Hill 193, he and his company repelled an attack by seven German soldiers, killing three and taking four prisoner. Murphy was promoted to sergeant on 13 December.

In January 1944, Murphy was promoted to staff sergeant. He was hospitalized in Naples with malaria on 21 January and was unable to participate in the initial landing at the Anzio beachhead. He returned on 29 January and participated in the First Battle of Cisterna, and was made a platoon sergeant in Company B following the battle. He returned with the 3rd Division to Anzio, where they remained for four months. Taking shelter from the weather in an abandoned farmhouse on 2 March, Murphy and his platoon killed the crew of a passing German tank. He then crawled out alone close enough to destroy the tank with rifle grenades, for which he received the Bronze Star with &quot;V&quot; device.

Murphy continued to make scouting patrols to take German prisoners before being hospitalized for a week on 13 March with a second bout of malaria. Sixty-one infantry officers and enlisted men of Company B, 15th Infantry, including Murphy, were awarded the Combat Infantryman Badge on 8 May.

Murphy was awarded a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Bronze Star. American forces liberated Rome on 4 June, and Murphy remained bivouacked in Rome with his platoon throughout July.

===European Theater===
During the first wave of the Allied invasion of southern France, Murphy received the Distinguished Service Cross for action taken on 15 August 1944. After landing on Yellow Beach near Ramatuelle, Murphy&#x27;s platoon was making its way through a vineyard when the men were attacked by German soldiers. He retrieved a machine gun that had been detached from the squad and returned fire at the German soldiers, killing two and wounding one. Two Germans exited a house about away and appeared to surrender; when Murphy&#x27;s best friend responded, they shot and killed him. Murphy advanced alone on the house under direct fire. He killed six, wounded two and took 11 prisoners.

Murphy was with the 1st Battalion, 15th Infantry Regiment during the 27–28 August offensive at Montélimar that secured the area from the Germans. Along with the other soldiers who took part in the action, he received the Presidential Unit Citation.

Murphy&#x27;s first Purple Heart was for a heel wound received in a mortar shell blast on 15 September 1944 in northeastern France. His first Silver Star came after he killed four and wounded three at a German machine gun position on 2 October at L&#x27;Omet quarry in the Cleurie valley. Three days later, Murphy crawled alone towards the Germans at L&#x27;Omet, carrying an SCR-536 radio and directing his men for an hour while the Germans fired directly at him. When his men finally took the hill, 15 Germans had been killed and 35 wounded. Murphy&#x27;s actions earned him a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Silver Star. He was awarded a battlefield commission to second lieutenant on 14 October, which elevated him to platoon leader. While en route to Brouvelieures on 26 October, the 3rd Platoon of Company B was attacked by a German sniper group. Murphy captured two before being shot in the hip by a sniper; he returned fire and shot the sniper between the eyes. At the 3rd General Hospital at Aix-en-Provence, the removal of gangrene from the wound caused partial loss of his hip muscle and kept him out of combat until January. Murphy received his first Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple Heart for this injury.

The Colmar Pocket, in the Vosges Mountains, had been held by German troops since November 1944. On 14 January 1945, Murphy rejoined his platoon, which had been moved to the Colmar area in December. He moved with the 3rd Division on 24 January to the town of Holtzwihr, where they faced a strong German counterattack. He was wounded in both legs, for which he received a second Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for his Purple Heart. As the company awaited reinforcements on 26 January, he was made commander of Company B. At about 2pm that afternoon, German troops and tanks counterattacked and Murphy ordered his company to withdraw into prepared positions. The Germans scored a direct hit on an M10 tank destroyer which was stationed near Murphy&#x27;s company command post, setting it alight and forcing the crew to abandon it. Murphy remained alone at his post, shooting his M1 carbine and directing artillery fire via his field radio, while the Germans aimed fire directly at his position. Murphy mounted the abandoned, burning tank destroyer and began firing its .50 caliber machine gun at the advancing Germans, killing a squad crawling through a ditch towards him. For an hour, Murphy stood on the flaming tank destroyer, returning German fire from foot soldiers and advancing tanks, and killing or wounding 50 Germans. He sustained a leg wound during his stand, and stopped only after he ran out of ammunition. Murphy rejoined his men, disregarding his own injury, and led them back to repel the Germans. Murphy insisted on remaining with his men while his wounds were treated.

For his actions that day, Murphy was awarded the Medal of Honor. The 3rd Infantry Division was awarded the Presidential Unit Citation for its actions at the Colmar Pocket, giving Murphy a Bronze Oak Leaf Cluster for the emblem.

On 16 February, Murphy was promoted to first lieutenant and was awarded the Legion of Merit for his service from 22 January 1944 to 18 February 1945. He was moved from the front lines to Regimental Headquarters and made a liaison officer.

===Decorations===

The United States additionally honored Murphy&#x27;s war contributions with the American Campaign Medal, the European–African–Middle Eastern Campaign Medal with arrowhead device and 9 campaign stars, the World War II Victory Medal, and the Army of Occupation Medal with Germany Clasp. France recognized his service with the French Legion of Honor – Grade of Chevalier, the French Croix de guerre with Silver Star, the French Croix de guerre with Palm, the French Liberation Medal and the French Fourragère in Colors of the Croix de guerre, which was authorized for all members of the 3rd Infantry Division who fought in France during World War II. Belgium awarded Murphy the Belgian Croix de guerre with 1940 Palm.

Brigadier General Ralph B. Lovett and Lieutenant Colonel Hallet D. Edson recommended Murphy for the Medal of Honor. Near Salzburg, Austria, on 2 June 1945, Lieutenant General A.M. Patch presented Murphy with the Medal of Honor and Legion of Merit for his actions at Holtzwihr. When asked after the war why he had seized the machine gun and taken on an entire company of German infantry, he replied, &quot;They were killing my friends&quot;.

Murphy received every U.S. military combat award for valor available from the U.S. Army for his World War II service.

===Postwar military service===
Inquiries were made through official channels about the prospect of Murphy attending West Point upon his return to the United States, but he never enrolled. According to author Don Graham, Murphy suggested the idea and then dropped it, possibly when he realized the extent of academic preparation needed to pass the entrance exam.

Murphy was one of several military personnel who received orders on 8 June 1945 to report to Fort Sam Houston in San Antonio, Texas, for temporary duty and reassignment. Upon arrival on 13 June, he was one of four assigned to Fort Sam Houston Army Ground &amp; Services Redistribution Station and sent home for 30 days of recuperation, with permission to travel anywhere within the United States during that period. While on leave, Murphy was feted with parades, banquets, and speeches. He received a belated Good Conduct Medal on 21 August.

He was discharged with the rank of first lieutenant at a 50 percent disability classification on 21 September and transferred to the Officers&#x27; Reserve Corps.

===Post-traumatic stress===
After his military service, Murphy was plagued with insomnia and bouts of depression, and he slept with a loaded pistol under his pillow. A post-service medical examination on 17 June 1947 revealed symptoms of headaches, vomiting, and nightmares about the war. His medical records indicated that he took sleeping pills to help prevent nightmares. During the mid-1960s, he recognized his dependence on the sedative Placidyl, and locked himself alone in a hotel room for a week to successfully break the addiction. Post-traumatic stress levels exacerbated his innate moodiness, and surfaced in episodes that friends and professional colleagues found alarming. His first wife, Dixie Wanda Hendrix, claimed he once held her at gunpoint. She witnessed her husband being guilt-ridden and tearful over newsreel footage of German war orphans. Murphy briefly found a creative stress outlet in writing poetry after his Army discharge. His poem &quot;The Crosses Grow on Anzio&quot; appeared in his book &quot;To Hell and Back&quot;, but was attributed to the fictitious character Kerrigan.

To draw attention to the problems of returning Korean War and Vietnam War veterans, Murphy spoke out candidly about his own problems with post-traumatic stress disorder. It was known during Murphy&#x27;s lifetime as &quot;battle fatigue&quot; and &quot;shell shock&quot;, terminology that dated back to World War I. He called on the government to give increased consideration and study to the emotional impact of combat experiences, and to extend health care benefits to war veterans. As a result of legislation introduced by U.S. Congressman Olin Teague five months after Murphy&#x27;s death in 1971, the Audie L. Murphy Memorial VA Hospital in San Antonio, now a part of the South Texas Veterans Health Care System, was dedicated in 1973.

==Texas Army National Guard==

At the end of World War II, the 36th Infantry Division reverted to state control as part of the Texas Army National Guard, and Murphy&#x27;s friends, Major General H. Miller Ainsworth and Brigadier General Carl L. Phinney, were the 36th&#x27;s commander and deputy commander respectively. After the 25 June 1950 commencement of the Korean War, Murphy began a second military career and was commissioned as a captain in the 36th Infantry Division of the Texas Army National Guard. He drilled new recruits in the summer training camps, and granted the Guard permission to use his name and image in recruiting materials. Although he wanted to join the fighting and juggled training activities with his film career, the 36th Infantry Division was never sent to Korea.

At his request, he transferred to inactive status on 1 October 1951 because of his film commitments with MGM Studios, and returned to active status in 1955. Murphy was promoted to the rank of major by the Texas Army National Guard in 1956 and returned to inactive status in 1957. In 1969, his official separation from the Guard transferred him to the United States Army Reserve. He remained with the USAR until his transfer to the Retired Reserve later in 1969.

==Film career==
During an acting career spanning from 1948 to 1969, Murphy made more than 40 feature films and one television series. When actor and producer James Cagney saw the 16 July 1945 issue of &quot;Life&quot; magazine depicting Murphy as the &quot;most decorated soldier&quot;, he brought him to Hollywood. Cagney and his brother William signed him as a contract player for their production company and gave him training in acting, voice and dance. They never cast Murphy in a movie and a personal disagreement ended the association in 1947. Murphy later worked with acting coach Estelle Harman and honed his diction by reciting dialogue from William Shakespeare and William Saroyan.

Murphy moved into Terry Hunt&#x27;s Athletic Club in Hollywood where he lived until 1948. Hollywood writer David &quot;Spec&quot; McClure befriended Murphy, collaborating with him on Murphy&#x27;s 1949 book &quot;To Hell and Back&quot;. McClure used his connections to get a $500 () bit part in &quot;Texas, Brooklyn &amp; Heaven&quot; (1948) for Murphy. He had been dating actress Wanda Hendrix since 1946. Her talent agent got him a bit part in the Alan Ladd film &quot;Beyond Glory&quot; directed by John Farrow. His 1949 film &quot;Bad Boy&quot; gave him his first leading role. The film&#x27;s financial backers refused to bankroll the project unless Murphy was given the lead; thus, Allied Artists put aside their reservations about using an inexperienced actor and gave him the starring role.
Universal Studios signed Murphy to a seven-year studio contract at $2,500 a week (). His first film for them was as Billy the Kid in &quot;The Kid from Texas&quot; in 1950. He wrapped up that year making &quot;Sierra&quot; starring Wanda Hendrix, who by that time had become his wife, and &quot;Kansas Raiders&quot; as outlaw Jesse James. Universal lent him to MGM in 1951 at a salary of $25,000 to play the lead of The Youth in &quot;The Red Badge of Courage&quot;, directed by John Huston. Murphy and Huston worked together again in the 1960 film &quot;The Unforgiven&quot;.

The only film Murphy made in 1952 was &quot;The Duel at Silver Creek&quot; with director Don Siegel. Murphy worked with Siegel one more time in 1958 for &quot;The Gun Runners&quot;. In 1953, he starred in Frederick de Cordova&#x27;s &quot;Column South&quot;, and played Jim Harvey in Nathan Juran&#x27;s &quot;Tumbleweed&quot;, an adaptation of the Kenneth Perkins novel &quot;Three Were Renegades&quot;. Director Nathan Juran also directed &quot;Gunsmoke&quot; and &quot;Drums Across the River&quot;. George Marshall directed Murphy in the 1954 &quot;Destry&quot;, a remake of &quot;Destry Rides Again&quot;, based on a character created by author Max Brand.

Although Murphy was initially reluctant to appear as himself in &quot;&quot;To Hell and Back&quot;&quot;, the 1955 adaptation of his book directed by Jesse Hibbs, he eventually agreed; it became the biggest hit in the history of Universal Studios at the time. To help publicize the release of the film, he made guest appearances on television shows such as &quot;What&#x27;s My Line?&quot;, &quot;Toast of the Town&quot;, and &quot;Colgate Comedy Hour&quot;. The Hibbs-Murphy team proved so successful in &quot;To Hell and Back&quot; that the two worked together on five subsequent films. The partnership resulted in Murphy appearing as John Phillip Clum in the 1956 western &quot;Walk the Proud Land&quot;, and the non-westerns &quot;Joe Butterfly&quot; and &quot;World in My Corner&quot;. They worked together for the last time in the 1958 western &quot;Ride a Crooked Trail&quot;.

Joseph L. Mankiewicz hired Murphy to play the titular role in the 1958 film &quot;The Quiet American&quot;. Murphy formed a partnership with Harry Joe Brown to make three films, starting with &quot;The Guns of Fort Petticoat&quot; (1957). The partnership fell into disagreement over the remaining two projects, and Brown filed suit against Murphy.

In 1957 Murphy was cast as The Utica Kid along with James Stewart and Dan Duryea in the western &quot;Night Passage&quot;.

Murphy was featured in three westerns in 1959: he starred opposite Sandra Dee in &quot;The Wild and the Innocent&quot;, collaborated as an uncredited co-producer with Walter Mirisch on the black and white &quot;Cast a Long Shadow&quot;, and performed as a hired killer in &quot;No Name on the Bullet&quot;, a film that was well received by critics. Thelma Ritter was his costar in the 1960 &quot;Startime&quot; television episode &quot;The Man&quot;. During the early 1960s, Murphy donated his time and otherwise lent his name and image for three episodes of &quot;The Big Picture&quot; television series produced by the United States Army. He received the 1960 Outstanding Civilian Service Medal for his cooperation in the episode &quot;Broken Bridge&quot;, which featured his visits to military installations in Germany, Italy, Turkey and the U.S. state of New Mexico to showcase the military&#x27;s latest weaponry.

Writer Clair Huffaker wrote the 1961 screenplays for Murphy&#x27;s films &quot;Seven Ways from Sundown&quot; and &quot;Posse from Hell&quot;. Willard W. Willingham and his wife Mary Willingham befriended Murphy in his early days in Hollywood and worked with him on a number of projects.

Willard was a producer on Murphy&#x27;s 1961 television series &quot;Whispering Smith&quot;, and co-wrote the screenplay for &quot;Battle at Bloody Beach&quot; that year. He collaborated on &quot;Bullet for a Badman&quot; in 1964 and &quot;Arizona Raiders&quot; in 1965. The Willinghams as a team wrote the screenplay for &quot;Gunpoint&quot; as well as the script for Murphy&#x27;s last starring lead in the western &quot;40 Guns to Apache Pass&quot; in 1967. Murphy made &quot;Trunk to Cairo&quot; in Israel in 1966.

He first met director Budd Boetticher when Murphy requested to be his boxing partner at Terry Hunt&#x27;s Athletic Club. He subsequently appeared in the 1951 title role of Boetticher&#x27;s first western &quot;The Cimarron Kid&quot;. Boetticher wrote the script in 1969 for Murphy&#x27;s last film, &quot;A Time for Dying&quot;. Two other projects that Murphy and Boetticher planned to collaborate on – &quot;A Horse for Mr Barnum&quot; and &quot;When There&#x27;s Sumpthin&#x27; to Do&quot; – never came to fruition.

==Personal life==
Murphy married actress Wanda Hendrix in 1949. Their divorce became final two years later in 1951. Four days later, he married former airline stewardess Pamela Opal Lee Archer, with whom he had two sons: Terry Michael and James Shannon.

Murphy bred quarter horses at the Audie Murphy Ranch in what is now Menifee, California, and the Murphy Ranch in Pima County, Arizona.

His horses raced at the Del Mar Racetrack, and he invested large sums of money in the hobby. Murphy&#x27;s gambling left his finances in a poor state. In 1968, he stated that he lost $260,000 in an Algerian oil deal and was dealing with the Internal Revenue Service over unpaid taxes. In spite of his financial difficulties, Murphy refused to appear in commercials for alcohol and cigarettes, mindful of the influence he would have on the youth market.

He was noted for a quick, fierce temper; he was involved in various violent altercations during his adult life. In May 1970, he was arrested in Burbank, California, charged with battery and assault with intent to commit murder in a dispute with a dog trainer. He was accused of firing a shot at the man, which he denied. Murphy was cleared of the charges.

==Death and commemorations==

On 28 May 1971, Murphy was killed when the private plane in which he was a passenger crashed into the side of a mountain northwest of Roanoke, Virginia, in conditions of rain, clouds, fog, and zero visibility. The pilot and four other passengers were also killed.

The aircraft was a twin-engine Aero Commander 680 flown by a pilot who had a private-pilot license and a reported 8,000 hours of flying time, but who held no instrument rating. The aircraft was recovered on 31 May. After her husband&#x27;s death, Pamela Murphy moved into a small apartment and got a clerk position at the Sepulveda Veterans Administration Hospital in Los Angeles, where she remained employed for 35 years.
On 7 June 1971, Murphy was buried with military honors at Arlington National Cemetery. In attendance were Ambassador to the U.N. George H. W. Bush, Army Chief of Staff William Westmoreland, and many of the 3rd Infantry Division. Murphy&#x27;s gravesite is in Section 46, headstone number 46-366-11, located across Memorial Drive from the Amphitheater. A special flagstone walkway was later constructed to accommodate the large number of people who visit to pay their respects. It is the cemetery&#x27;s second most-visited gravesite, after that of President John F. Kennedy.

The headstones of Medal of Honor recipients buried at Arlington National Cemetery are normally decorated in gold leaf. Murphy previously requested that his stone remain plain and inconspicuous, like that of an ordinary soldier. The headstone contains the birth year 1924, based upon purportedly falsified materials among his military records.

In 1974, a large granite marker was erected just off the Appalachian Trail at at 3,100 ft elevation, near the crash site. In 1975, a court awarded Murphy&#x27;s widow, Pamela, and their two children $2.5 million in damages because of the accident.

Civilian honors were bestowed on Murphy during his lifetime and posthumously, including a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame. In 2013, Murphy was honored by his home state with the Texas Legislative Medal of Honor.

==Songwriting==

David McClure, his collaborator on the book &quot;To Hell and Back&quot;, discovered Murphy&#x27;s talent for poetry during their work on the memoir when he found discarded verses in Murphy&#x27;s Hollywood apartment. One of those poems, &quot;The Crosses Grow on Anzio&quot;, appears in &quot;To Hell and Back&quot; attributed to a soldier named Kerrigan. Only two others survived, &quot;Alone and Far Removed&quot; and &quot;Freedom Flies in Your Heart Like an Eagle&quot;. The latter was part of a speech Murphy had written at a 1968 dedication of the Alabama War Memorial in Montgomery, and later set to music by Scott Turner under the title &quot;Dusty Old Helmet&quot;.

Murphy was a fan of country music, in particular Bob Wills and Chet Atkins, but was not a singer or musician himself. Through his friend Guy Mitchell, Murphy was introduced to songwriter Scott Turner in 1961. The two collaborated on numerous songs between 1962 and 1970, the most successful of which were &quot;Shutters and Boards&quot; and &quot;When the Wind Blows in Chicago&quot;.

<text>William Randolph Hearst Jr. (January 27, 1908 – May 14, 1993) was an American businessman, newspaper publisher and member of the wealthy Hearst family. 

He was the second son of the publisher William Randolph Hearst. He became editor-in-chief of Hearst Newspapers after the death of his father in 1951. He won a Pulitzer Prize for his interview with Soviet premier, Nikita Khrushchev, and associated commentaries in 1955.

== Early life and education ==
Hearst was born on January 27, 1908, in Manhattan, New York City, to William Randolph Hearst and his wife, Millicent Willson.

Hearst attended the University of California, Berkeley, and was a member of the Tau Kappa Epsilon fraternity.

== Career ==
Hearst was instrumental in restoring some measure of family control to the Hearst Corporation, which under his father&#x27;s will is (and will continue to be while any grandchild alive at William Randolph Hearst Sr.&#x27;s death in 1951 is still living) controlled by a board of thirteen trustees, five from the Hearst family and eight Hearst executives. When tax laws changed to prevent the foundations his father had established from continuing to own the corporation, he arranged for the family trust (with the same trustees) to buy the shares and for longtime chief executive Richard E. Berlin, who was going senile, to be eased out to become chairman of the trustees for a period. Later, William Randolph Hearst Jr. himself headed the trust and served as chairman of the executive committee of the corporation. At his death, his branch of the family became represented on the trustees by his son, William Randolph Hearst III.

Hearst was a member of the Sons of the American Revolution. He makes a brief appearance in the musical adaptation of &quot;Newsies&quot; as Bill.

== Personal life ==
Hearst was married three times:

* Alma Walker (March 24, 1928 – May 26, 1932; divorced)
* Lorelle McCarver (March 28, 1933 – March 30, 1948; divorced)
* Austine McDonnell (July 29, 1948 – December 15, 1991; her death)

He had two sons with McDonnell:
* William Randolph Hearst III (born June 18, 1949)
* John Augustine Hearst (born October 24, 1952).

<text>William Robert Renshaw (1845 – 1923) was an English industrialist and foundryman.

Renshaw was born to an agricultural family in Handforth in the county of Cheshire, England. He began his career as an apprentice button-maker at the Union Foundry of Barker and Cope in Kidsgrove, Staffordshire.

In 1880 he was in business with his own foundry, the Victoria Works in Tunstall, Staffordshire, where he produced equipment for collieries, forges and mills, before returning to Kidsgrove to acquire the Union Foundry as a member of a partnership known as Renshaw, King and Company.

He later moved to the Phoenix Works at Cliffe Vale, where electrical and railway equipment was manufactured and where specialist railway carriages and wagons were built for use by the Barnum &amp; Bailey Circus, (see Phineas Taylor Barnum) during its tour of Britain and Europe which began in 1886.

Among other children and grandchildren he had two grandsons worthy of note, namely George and John Starr, both of whom were members of the Special Operations Executive organisation
during World War II.

William Randolph Hearst III was born on June 18, 1949. His father was William Randolph Hearst Jr., and his paternal grandfather was William Randolph Hearst. He graduated from the Canterbury School in New Milford, Connecticut, in 1967. He graduated from Harvard University in 1972 with a B.A. degree in mathematics.

His grandfather had also headed that paper, though his father had been publisher of the &quot;New York Journal American&quot;.

In 1976 he left the company to become the managing editor of &quot;Outside&quot; magazine which was then being started by the &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; magazine founder Jann Wenner. He returned to the company and newspaper work in 1980. In 1992 he again left his job at the company, remaining on the board of directors. The following year he succeeded his father as a trustee of the trust that controls the company and chooses the directors.

In 1996, he was a co-founder of the @Home Network Broadband Internet service with Milo Medin, cable companies Tele-Communications Inc., Comcast and Cox Cable where he served as the company&#x27;s first chief executive officer. In 1995, he was named partner at the Silicon Valley venture capital firm of Kleiner Perkins. He sits on several boards of directors of companies in which the firm has investments, including Hearst Television. He served as a member of the board of directors of Juniper Networks until May 2008.
Since 2017, he has been Editor &amp; Publisher of the quarterly journal. &quot;Alta Journal&quot;,&lt;ref name=&quot;altaonline/premiere-issue-free&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;&lt;ref name=&quot;altaonline/alta-journal&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt; and website, Alta Online.&lt;ref name=&quot;altaonline/about-us&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

<text>Sandra Miju Oh (born July 20, 1971) is a Canadian and American actress. She is known for her starring roles as Rita Wu in the HBO comedy series &quot;Arliss&quot; (1996–2002), Dr. Cristina Yang in the ABC medical drama series &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; (2005–2014), and Eve Polastri in the BBC America spy thriller series &quot;Killing Eve&quot; (2018–2022). She has received one Primetime Emmy Award from fourteen nominations, as well as two Golden Globe Awards and four Screen Actors Guild Awards. In 2019, &quot;Time&quot; magazine named Oh one of the 100 most influential people in the world.

Oh first gained recognition for her roles in the Canadian films &quot;Double Happiness&quot; (1994) and &quot;The Diary of Evelyn Lau&quot; (1994), where she won Genie Awards for both films. Her later television credits include &quot;Judging Amy&quot; and &quot;American Crime&quot;, as well as voice roles on &quot;American Dad!, American Dragon: Jake Long&quot;, &quot;The Proud Family&quot;, &quot;Phineas and Ferb&quot;, &quot;Chop Socky Chooks&quot;, &quot;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&quot;, and &quot;Invincible&quot;. In 2021, she played the lead role in the Netflix comedy drama series &quot;The Chair&quot; and was also one of the executive producers of the series. 

She has had notable leading performances in films such as &quot;Last Night&quot; (1998), &quot;Long Life, Happiness &amp; Prosperity&quot; (2002), &quot;Wilby Wonderful&quot; (2004), &quot;Catfight&quot; (2016), &quot;Meditation Park&quot; (2017), and &quot;Quiz Lady&quot; (2023).

She hosted the 28th Genie Awards in 2008, and became the first woman of Asian descent to host the Golden Globe Awards at the 76th ceremony in 2019. In March 2019, she became the first Asian-Canadian woman to host &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and was the third actress of Asian descent to do so, after Lucy Liu in 2000 and Awkwafina in 2018. She was also the first actress of Asian descent to be nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series and the first woman of Asian descent to win two Golden Globes.

==Early life==
Sandra Miju Oh was born in Nepean, Ontario, on July 20, 1971, the daughter of middle-class South Korean immigrants Oh Young-nam, a biochemist, and Oh Jun-su (John), a businessperson. Her parents had moved to the area in the early 1960s. She has a brother, Ray, and a sister, Grace, and grew up in a Christian household, living on Camwood Crescent in Nepean, where she began acting and practicing ballet at age four to correct her pigeon-toed stance. Growing up, Oh was one of the few youths of Asian descent in Nepean.

At age ten, Oh played The Wizard of Woe in a class musical called &quot;The Canada Goose&quot;. Later, at Sir Robert Borden High School, she founded the environmental club BASE (Borden Active Students for the Environment), leading a campaign against the use of styrofoam cups. While in high school, she was elected student council president. She also played the flute and continued both her ballet training and acting studies, though she knew that she &quot;was not good enough to be a professional dancer&quot; and eventually focused on acting. She took drama classes, acted in school plays, and joined the drama club, where she took part in the Canadian Improv Games and Skit Row High, a comedy group. Against her parents&#x27; advice, she rejected a four-year journalism scholarship to Carleton University to study drama at the National Theatre School of Canada in Montreal, paying her own way.

Oh told her parents that she would try acting for a few years, and promised to return to university if it failed. Reflecting on forgoing university, she has said that she is &quot;the only person in [her] family who doesn&#x27;t have a master&#x27;s in something&quot;. Soon after graduating from the National Theatre School in 1993, she starred in a stage production of David Mamet&#x27;s &quot;Oleanna&quot; in London, Ontario. Around the same time, she won roles in biographical television films of two significant female Chinese-Canadians: as Vancouver author Evelyn Lau in &quot;The Diary of Evelyn Lau&quot;, where she won the role over more than 1,000 others who auditioned, and as Adrienne Clarkson in a CBC biopic of Clarkson&#x27;s life.

==Career==
===1994–2004: Early work===
Oh came to prominence in her home country for her lead performance in the Canadian film &quot;Double Happiness&quot; (1994), playing Jade Li, a twenty-something Chinese-Canadian woman negotiating her wishes and those of her parents. The film received critical acclaim, with Roger Ebert praising Oh&#x27;s &quot;warm performance&quot;. Janet Maslin of &quot;The New York Times&quot; also praised her performance, saying: &quot;Ms. Oh&#x27;s performance makes Jade a smart, spiky heroine you won&#x27;t soon forget.&quot; Oh won the Genie Award for Best Actress for the role. In 1995 she appeared in the Canadian film Little Criminals with a multi-scene, but uncredited, performance.

In 1997 she appeared in the film &quot;Bean&quot;, playing the supporting role of Bernice, the art gallery PR manager. Her other Canadian films include &quot;Long Life, Happiness &amp; Prosperity&quot; and &quot;Last Night&quot; (1998), for which she again won a Best Actress Genie. She was cast in the drama &quot;Dancing at the Blue Iguana&quot; (2000), playing a stripper at an adult dance club opposite Daryl Hannah. The film received mediocre reviews, though Oh was praised for her performance. &quot;The New York Times&quot; review said, &quot;Oh make[s] the most of [her] opportunity to explore the vulnerability below [her] characters&#x27; hard-edged surface.&quot; The same year, she appeared in the drama &quot;Waking the Dead&quot;. In 2002, Oh appeared in the family comedy &quot;Big Fat Liar&quot;, followed by a minor role in Steven Soderbergh&#x27;s &quot;Full Frontal&quot; (2002).

Oh garnered critical acclaim for her six seasons as Rita Wu, the assistant to the president of a major sports agency, on the HBO series &quot;Arliss&quot;, receiving a nomination for an NAACP Image Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Comedy Series and a Cable Ace award for Best Actress in a Comedy for her work. She also made several guest appearances on the series &quot;Popular&quot; (1999) playing a humanities teacher and guest starred in the television series &quot;Kung Fu: The Legend Continues&quot;, &quot;Judging Amy&quot;, &quot;Six Feet Under&quot; and &quot;Odd Job Jack&quot;.

In theatre, Oh has also starred in the world premieres of Jessica Hagedorn&#x27;s &quot;Dogeaters&quot; at the La Jolla Playhouse and Diana Son&#x27;s &quot;Stop Kiss&quot; at Joseph Papp&#x27;s Public Theater in New York City.

In 2003, she was cast in a supporting role opposite Diane Lane in &quot;Under the Tuscan Sun&quot;, followed by a supporting role in Alexander Payne&#x27;s drama &quot;Sideways&quot; (2004). She considers &quot;Sideways&quot; and &quot;The Diary of Evelyn Lau&quot; to be the two best films she has made.

===2005–2013: &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;===
In 2005, Oh appeared in several films, including David Slade&#x27;s controversial thriller &quot;Hard Candy&quot;; and the independent anthology drama &quot;3 Needles&quot; (2005), opposite Chloë Sevigny and Olympia Dukakis, in which she plays a Catholic nun in an AIDS-stricken African village. The same year, Oh was cast as Cristina Yang in the first season of what became the hit ABC medical series &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;. Oh&#x27;s role on the show earned her both a 2005 Golden Globe Award for Best Supporting Actress in a Series and a 2006 Screen Actors Guild Award for Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series. In July 2009, she received her fifth consecutive Primetime Emmy Award nomination as Best Supporting Actress in a Drama for her work on the series.
In addition to her work on &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot;, Oh continued to appear in films. She co-starred in the thriller &quot;The Night Listener&quot; (2006), alongside Robin Williams and Toni Collette; in the superhero comedy &quot;Defendor&quot; (2009); &quot;Ramona and Beezus&quot; (2010); and in the critically acclaimed drama &quot;Rabbit Hole&quot; (2010), opposite Nicole Kidman and Aaron Eckhart.

In her only audiobook, she played Brigid O&#x27;Shaughnessy in a Grammy-nominated dramatization of &quot;The Maltese Falcon&quot; (2008), which also featured Michael Madsen and Edward Herrmann. She also has done a few voice roles in animation, including a few guest appearances in &quot;American Dragon: Jake Long&quot;, the voice of Princess Ting-Ting in &quot;Mulan II&quot;, and the voice of Doofah in &quot;The Land Before Time XIII: The Wisdom of Friends&quot;.

Oh was the host of the 28th Genie Awards on March 3, 2008. In 2009, Oh performed in &quot;The People Speak&quot;, a documentary feature film that uses dramatic and musical performances of the letters, diaries, and speeches of everyday Americans, based on historian Howard Zinn&#x27;s &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the United States&quot;. During the off-season hiatus from filming &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; in 2010, Oh took the part of Sarah Chen in the British crime drama, &quot;Thorne&quot;. She undertook intensive dialect coaching in order to play her British character.

On June 28, 2011, it was announced that Oh would receive a star on Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame; she was inducted on October 1 at Elgin Theatre in Toronto. In 2013, Oh formally announced that she would be leaving &quot;Grey&#x27;s Anatomy&quot; at the end of the tenth season. Oh exited the series with the season 10 finale.

===2014–present: Film roles and &quot;Killing Eve&quot;===
In October 2014, Oh announced that she would be teaming up with Canadian director Ann Marie Fleming to collaborate on an animated feature film titled &quot;Window Horses&quot;. She also appeared in a supporting role in the comedy film &quot;Tammy&quot; (2014), playing the wife of Kathy Bates&#x27; character.
In 2015, she starred on the Refinery29 comedy web series &quot;Shitty Boyfriends&quot;. Oh began filming the comedy film, &quot;Catfight&quot; (2016), in New York City in December 2015. In 2017, Oh starred as Abby Tanaka in the third season of the anthology drama series &quot;American Crime&quot;.

Beginning in April 2018, Oh began a leading role in the BBC America and BBC Three spy thriller series &quot;Killing Eve&quot;, playing British intelligence agent Eve Polastri whose quarry is psychopathic assassin Villanelle (played by Jodie Comer), with the two women developing a mutual fascination. Upon reading the series script, Oh did not realize she was being considered for a leading role, stating that she had been &quot;brainwashed&quot; by years of being typecast as the leads&#x27; best friend. The series was renewed for a second season ahead of its debut, and a third was announced less than a day after the second premiered in the United States. &quot;Killing Eve&quot; was also renewed for a fourth season shortly after.

Oh has garnered critical acclaim for her performance on the series, with Jenna Scherer describing her in &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; as &quot;a compulsively watchable actor – expressive and complex, blending wry wit and deep pathos.&quot; When &quot;Vulture&quot; declared Oh the best actress currently on television, critic Matt Zoller Seitz wrote: &quot;It&#x27;s a tour de force performance, yet so self-effacing and invisible in its effects that you come away thinking that you&#x27;ve seen a crackling yarn with compelling characters rather than a cultural landmark. This is a magic trick of a high order.&quot; In 2018, Oh became the first actress of Asian descent to be nominated for the Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Lead Actress in a Drama Series, for that role. She won the Golden Globe Award for Best Actress – Television Series Drama, becoming the first woman of Asian descent to win two Golden Globe Awards. Oh won Outstanding Performance by a Female Actor in a Drama Series at the SAG Awards in 2019.

From 2018 to 2020, Oh voiced the role of Castaspella in the animated superhero series &quot;She-Ra and the Princesses of Power&quot;. In 2019, she co-hosted the &quot;76th Golden Globe Awards&quot;, alongside Andy Samberg. Oh became the first woman of Asian descent to host the awards show. In March 2019, she became the first Asian-Canadian woman to host &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot;, and only the third actress of Asian descent, after Lucy Liu in 2000 and Awkwafina in 2018. In 2021, Oh voiced Virana, the chieftess of the Fang tribe in the Disney animated film &quot;Raya and the Last Dragon&quot;.

Oh voices the role of Debbie Grayson in the animated superhero drama series &quot;Invincible&quot;. The series, based on the comic book series of the same name, premiered on Amazon Prime Video in 2021.
In 2021, Oh served as executive producer and had the lead role in the Netflix comedy-drama series &quot;The Chair&quot;.

In 2022, Oh voiced the role of Ming Lee, the strict and overprotective mother of the main character in the Pixar animated film &quot;Turning Red&quot;. She joined Lynne Ramsay&#x27;s adaptation of Margaret Atwood&#x27;s short story collection &quot;Stone Mattress&quot;.

In 2023, Oh played the role of Jenny Yum, a brash, outgoing, and impulsive older sister of the main character in the 20th Century Studios comedy film &quot;Quiz Lady&quot;.

Her upcoming projects include &quot;Good Fortune&quot; directed by Aziz Ansari.

==Personal life==
Oh was in a relationship with filmmaker Alexander Payne for five years. They married in January 2003, separated in early 2005, and divorced in late 2006.

On July 8, 2013, Oh received the key to the city of Ottawa from Mayor Jim Watson.

Oh practices Vipassanā, a Buddhist form of meditation. Her work in acting is informed by a loose creative collective that teaches &quot;creative dream work&quot;, which reportedly fuses Jungian dream analysis with method acting and aims to bring one&#x27;s &quot;subconscious work into consciousness&quot;.

Oh became a US citizen in 2018. On the first anniversary of her citizenship, she discussed it while hosting &quot;Saturday Night Live&quot; and referred to herself as an &quot;Asian-Canadian-American&quot;.

Oh was awarded the National Arts Centre Award from the Governor General of Canada in 2019, as a part of the Governor General&#x27;s Performing Arts Awards.

In June 2022, Oh was named an officer of the Order of Canada. Later in that year, she was one of a number of recent inductees to the Order to be included in the Canadian delegation to the state funeral of Queen Elizabeth II.

=== Activism ===
On March 22, 2021, Oh gave a speech at a Stop Asian Hate rally in Pittsburgh, Pennsylvania, in response to the Atlanta spa shootings. She encouraged people &quot;to reach out to the Asian American community&quot;, stating that they were &quot;very scared&quot;.

I&#x27;m gonna be very, very brief, but one thing I know, many of us in our community are very scared, and I understand that, and one way to try to kind of go through– get through our fear is to reach out to our communities...I will challenge everyone here: if you see something, will you help me? If you see one of our brothers and sisters in need, will you help us?...I am proud to be Asian! I wanna hear you say, I am proud to be Asian! I belong here! I am proud to be Asian! I belong here! Many of us don&#x27;t get the chance to be able to say that, so I just wanted to give us an opportunity to be able to shout that.

<text>The chamber of deputies is the lower house in many bicameral legislatures and the sole house in some unicameral legislatures.

==Description==
Historically, French Chamber of Deputies was the lower house of the French Parliament during the Bourbon Restoration, the July Monarchy, and the French Third Republic; the name is still informally used for the National Assembly under the nation&#x27;s current Fifth Republic.

The term &quot;chamber of deputies&quot; is not widely used by English-speaking countries, the more popular equivalent being &quot;House of Representatives&quot;, an exception being Burma, a former British colony, where it was the name of the lower house of the country&#x27;s parliament. It was also the official description of Dáil Éireann (the lower house of the Irish parliament) during the period of the Irish Free State.

In Malta, the House of Representatives is known, in Maltese, as &quot;Kamra tad-Deputati&quot;.
In Lebanon, the literal Arabic name of that country&#x27;s parliament is &quot;Majlis an-Nuwwab&quot;, or, &quot;Chamber of Deputies&quot; (although officially used French and English translations are &quot;Assemblée Nationale&quot; and &quot;National Assembly&quot;, respectively). Brazil also has a &quot;Chamber of Deputies&quot;, known in Brazilian Portuguese as the &quot;&quot;, for a lower house of the legislative body.

A member of a &quot;chamber of deputies&quot; is generally called a &quot;deputy&quot;, the definition of which is similar to that of &quot;congressperson&quot; or &quot;member of parliament&quot;. The term &quot;deputy&quot; may refer to any member of a legislative body or chamber; this usage is particularly common in those French-speaking countries whose parliaments are called &quot;national assemblies&quot; and Spanish-speaking countries with legislative bodies called &quot;congresses&quot;; the term is also used by Portugal&#x27;s Assembly of the Republic. In Ireland, it is used as a form of address when referring to members of Dáil Éireann instead of the Irish language term Teachta Dála, while in the Channel Islands, &quot;Deputy&quot; is used as the official title of most of the members of the States Assembly in Jersey and all but two of the members of the States of Deliberation in Guernsey.

<text>George Randolph Hearst Sr. (April 23, 1904 – January 26, 1972) was an American heir and media executive. He was the son of media magnate William Randolph Hearst, and the vice president of the Hearst Corporation.

==Early life==
Hearst was born on April 23, 1904. He was the eldest son of newspaper magnate William Randolph Hearst.

==Career==
Hearst first worked in advertising for &quot;The San Francisco Examiner&quot; from 1924 to 1928, when he became its publisher. He was appointed as the president of &quot;The New York American&quot; in 1929, and he was the vice president of the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; from 1932 to 1953.

Though he never held a title higher than Vice-President at the Hearst Corporation, he was listed above many with higher-sounding titles when executives were listed in the company&#x27;s publications. Hearst was one of the five family trustees of the trust established under his father&#x27;s will (this ensured that eight non-family trustees would have majority control of the corporation). In the 1950s Hearst Sr. secured a seat on the corporation&#x27;s board for his son, George Randolph Hearst Jr. 

==Personal life, death and legacy==
Hearst was married several times. He married and divorced Blanche Wilbur, Lora Velie, and Sally Alvarez Kirkham. Another marriage, to actress Sandra Rambeau, was annulled. Hearst married his fourth wife, actress Collette Lyons, twice because their first wedding in Mexico was invalid as Hearst was still married to Sally. They had twins, a son and a daughter. Hearst was an amateur aviator. Hearst&#x27;s last marriage was to Rosalie May Wynn born in Oklahoma City. They had a home in Palm Springs and were active philanthropists.

Hearst died on January 26, 1972, in Loma Linda, California. The California Senate passed a resolution in his memory sponsored by Sen. Gordon Cologne on February 2, 1972.

After his death in 1972, his son succeeded him as a trustee. He served as chairman of the corporation&#x27;s board from 1996 until his death in 2012.

<text>George Randolph Hearst Jr. (July 13, 1927 – June 25, 2012) was an American businessman and member of the wealthy Hearst family. He served as the chairman of the board of the Hearst Corporation from 1996 through to his death in 2012, succeeding his uncle Randolph Apperson Hearst. He was a director at the company for over forty years.

== Life ==
Hearst Jr. and his twin sister Phoebe were born July 13, 1927, in San Francisco, California. Hearst first joined the Naval Air Corps. Later, he joined the United States Army and served in the Korean War. 

In 1948, he joined the advertising staff of the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot;, which his grandfather had founded in 1903, then worked for several years at the family-run &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot;. In 1957, he was named business manager of the &quot;Los Angeles Herald-Express&quot; and three years later was made publisher. In 1967, while publisher of the &quot;Herald Examiner&quot;, Hearst felt pressure from the growing workers unions and &quot;was determined to break them.&quot; The strikes by the unions lasted until 1977 by which point circulation of the paper had been cut in half to 330,000 and advertising had evaporated, partly because of aggressive tactics by organized labor; the paper never fully recovered. 

That same year, Hearst joined the Hearst Corporation, where he would spend the rest of his career. Non-family executives are a majority on the trust that controls the corporation, and this trust will not dissolve until all grandchildren alive at the death of William Randolph Hearst have died. George Jr. was one of the oldest grandchildren. However, there are five family seats among the 13 trustees, and George represented his branch of the family.

Hearst Jr. died in Palo Alto, California at age 84 following complications from a stroke.

== Children ==
He married Mary Thompson (born 1931) in 1951, and they had four children, all born in California. They divorced in 1969.

* Mary Astrid Hearst (1953–2004), born in Santa Monica, daughters Shannon and Alexis, later married Randy Ives, died at San Simeon, California, of cancer; known as &quot;Bunny&quot;
* George Randolph Hearst III (born 1955)
* Stephen Thompson Hearst (born 1956)
* Erin Wilbur Hearst (born 1959), married a Mr. Knudsen

<doc id="363027" wikidata="Q94815" url="?curid=363027" title="Brassavola">
<text>Brassavola is a genus of 21 orchids (family Orchidaceae). They were named in 1813 by the Scottish botanist Robert Brown. The name comes from the Italian nobleman and physician Antonio Musa Brassavola. This genus is abbreviated B. in trade journals.

These species are widespread across Mexico, Central America, the West Indies and South America. They are epiphytes, and a few are lithophytes. A single, apical and succulent leaf grows on an elongated pseudobulb.

The orchid yields a single white or greenish white flower, or a raceme of a few flowers. The three sepals and two lateral petals are greenish, narrow and long. The base of the broad, sometimes fringed lip partially enfolds the column. This column has a pair of falciform (sickle-shaped) ears on each side of the front and contains twelve (sometimes eight) pollinia.

Most &quot;Brassavola&quot; orchids are very fragrant, attracting pollinators with their citrusy smell. But they are only fragrant at night, in order to attract the right moth. Longevity of flowers depends on the species and is between five and thirty days.

In 1698 &quot;Brassavola nodosa&quot; was the first tropical orchid to be brought from the Caribbean island Curaçao to Holland. Thus began the propagation of this orchid and the fascination for orchids in general.
==Taxonomy==
The species of Brassavola have been divided into four sections:

===&quot;B&quot;. sect. &quot;Brassavola&quot;===
This monotypic section, erected by H. G. Jones in 1969, contains the type of the genus:
===&quot;B&quot;. sect. &quot;Sessilabia&quot;===
This section, erected by Rolfe in 1902, is characterized by narrow labella with fimbriate margins to wider labella with entire margins.
===&quot;B&quot;. sect. &quot;Cuneilabia&quot;===
This section, erected by Rolfe in 1902, is characterized by narrowly constricted labellum bases. The sectional type is &quot;B. nodosa&quot;
===&quot;B&quot;. sect. &quot;Lateraliflorae&quot;===
This section, erected by H.G.Jones in 1975, is characterized by laterally-borne inflorescences. The sectional type is &quot;B. acaulis&quot;
==Greges and hybrid genera==
&quot;Brassavola&quot; is in the same alliance as the genera &quot;Cattleya&quot; and &quot;Laelia&quot;. They have been used extensively in hybridization and represent the &quot;B&quot; at the beginning of the names of such crosses. For example, Blc. is × &quot;Brassolaeliocattleya&quot;.
*&quot;B.&quot; Little Stars, a primary hybrid between &quot;B. nodosa&quot; and &quot;B. subulifolia&quot;

<text>John Randolph Hearst (1909–1958) was an American business executive and the third son of William Randolph Hearst.
== Career ==
Hearst, like his brothers, worked for the Hearst Corporation and was said to have the most executive talent among the sons of William Randolph Hearst. Any question of his rivaling the non-family executives who constituted a majority of the trustees of his father&#x27;s will, however, was rendered moot after he died of a heart attack aged 49, while in the Virgin Islands.

== Life ==

=== Marriages ===

==== Dorothy Hart Hearst ====
Hearst&#x27;s first marriage was to Dorothy Hart Hearst. Their marriage ended after Hart divorced and sued him in 1932, citing &quot;extreme cruelty&quot; from Hearst.

==== Gretchen Wilson Hearst ====
Hearst’s second marriage was to Gretchen Wilson Hearst. Their marriage was short lived, and ended in 1938 when Wilson divorced him and won custody of their son, John Randolph Hearst Jr. (Wilson later married Woolworth Donahue (Jessie May Woolworth Donahue&#x27;s son).

==== Fanne Wade Hearst ====
Hearst remarried for a final time to Fanne Wade Hearst, and in 1946, the couple purchased the former estate of Henry Anderson in Flower Hill, New York.

=== Children ===
Hearst had four children, including John Jr., who served as a company executive and director who represented this branch of the family among the trustees.

<text>The Genie Awards were given out annually by the Academy of Canadian Cinema and Television to recognize the best of Canadian cinema from 1980–2012. They succeeded the Canadian Film Awards (1949–1978), known as the &quot;Etrog Awards&quot; for sculptor Sorel Etrog, who designed its statuette.

Genie Award candidates were selected from submissions made by the owners of Canadian films or their representatives, based on the criteria laid out in the &quot;Genie Rules and Regulations&quot; booklet which were distributed to Academy members and industry members. Peer-group juries, assembled from volunteer members of the Academy, met to watch the submissions and select a group of nominees. Academy members then voted on these nominations.

In 2012, the Academy announced that the Genies would merge with its sister presentation for television, the Gemini Awards, to form a new award presentation, the Canadian Screen Awards.

== Broadcasting ==
The Genie Awards were aired by CBC from 1980 to 2003, before moving to CHUM Limited&#x27;s networks (Citytv, Bravo! and Star!). After CTVglobemedia purchased CHUM Limited, the Genie Awards moved to Canwest Global&#x27;s E and IFC for 2008. The last two Genie Awards (2011–2012) were broadcast by the CBC.

<doc id="363034" wikidata="Q132709" url="?curid=363034" title="Phragmipedium">
<text>Phragmipedium is a genus of the Orchid family (Orchidaceae) (Subfamily Cypripedioideae) and the only genus comprised in the tribe Phragmipedieae and subtribe Phragmipediinae. The name of the genus is derived from the Greek &quot;phragma&quot;, which means &quot;division&quot;, and &quot;pedium&quot;, which means &quot;slipper&quot; (referring to the pouch). It is abbreviated &#x27;Phrag&#x27; in trade journals.

About 20 species of these lady&#x27;s slipper orchids are known from SW Mexico, Central and tropical South America.

All &quot;Phragmipedium&quot; species are listed under Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), meaning that commercial international trade in wild-sourced specimens is prohibited, while non-commercial trade is regulated.

== Taxonomy ==

The genus &quot;Phragmipedium &quot; is divided into several sections :
* Phragmipedium : &quot;P. caudatum, P. exstaminodium, P. lindenii&quot;
* Himantopetalum : &quot;P. caricinum, P. christiansenianum, P. pearcei, P. klotzscheanum, P. richteri, P. tetzlaffianum&quot;.
* Platypetalum : &quot;P. lindleyanum&quot;
* Lorifolia : &quot;P. boissierianum, P. hirtzii, P. longifolium, P. vittatum&quot;
* Micropetalum : &quot;P. besseae, P. besseae var. dalessandroi, P. fischeri, P. schlimii.&quot;
* Schluckebieria : &quot;P. kovachii&quot;

The exact number of species is still being discussed among specialists : O. Gruss recognizes 20 species, compared to the 15 species accepted by Lucile M. McCook (see References).

Most &quot;Phragmipedium&quot; species are either terrestrial, epiphytic or lithophytic in habit. They show a unique shieldlike staminode, long, moustache-like petals and a 3-locular ovary. The large pouchlike lip is curved inwards at the margins. The acute leaves attain a length of about 80 cm. The stem lacks pseudobulbs and grows about 80 cm high, showing 2 to 3 flowers.

&quot;Phragmipedium besseae&quot; was first found in Peru by Elizabeth Locke Besse in 1981. Soon afterwards, the site was plundered and destroyed by orchid hunters. Luckily enough seed was preserved, to avert extinction. This orchid is unusual, because its flowers have a bright orange-red to almost strong salmon-red color (there is also a yellow variety), unseen in any lady&#x27;s slipper orchid. The oval-shaped petals are wide. The narrow leaves are elliptic in shape. It has since been used extensively in hybridization.

&quot;Phragmipedium caudatum&quot; is considered a complex, i.e. it could contain several species or subspecies, based on differences in flower size and color. This orchid with a short stem is semi-terrestrial, semi-lithophytic to epiphytic, depending on the substrate . The cream-colored flowers are laced with greenish stripes. The lateral spiraling, drooping petals are red-tinted and very long, even reaching the soil. They grow on wet, moss-covered hillsides.

&quot;Phragmipedium lindleyanum&quot;, named after John Lindley, forms a rosette of five long linear leaves with a yellow margin, reaching a length of 50 cm. The erect raceme can grow as high as 1 m. It is many-flowered and sometimes branched at the basis. The flowers open in succession, giving the orchid a long blooming period. The hoary flowers are green with brown veins. The glabrous, pouchlike lip is yellow, with red veins.

&quot;Phragmipedium longifolium&quot;, described in 1852 by H.G. Reichenbach f. and J. v. Warscewicz, has long lanceolate leaves without yellow margin, growing to a length of 60 cm. The inflorescence reaches a length of 1 m, with about 10 flowers, opening in succession. The long lateral petals are purplish green. The rather small glabrous labellum has a green color.

Allied genera include &quot;Paphiopedilum&quot;, &quot;Selenipedium&quot;, &quot;Cypripedium&quot; and the monotypic &quot;Mexipedium&quot;.

There are many interspecific hybrids. Rare crossings have been made between &quot;Phragmipedium&quot; and &quot;Paphiopedilum&quot;.

The genus Uropedium is generally included in &quot;Phragmipedium&quot;.

<text>The Australian honours and awards system refers to all orders, decorations, and medals, as instituted by letters patent from the Monarch of Australia and countersigned by the Australian prime minister at the time, that have been progressively introduced since 14 February 1975. The Australian honours and awards system excludes all state and local government, and private, issued awards and medals (although a few can be recognised in the order of wearing, like those in the Order of St John).

Honours and awards have been present in Australia since pre-Federation, primarily from the Imperial honours and awards system. This Imperial system remained in place until its full phase out in 1994 (although the Monarch of Australia may still confer some of these honours to Australians in their personal capacity). Between 1975 and 1992, the Australian honours and awards system and the Imperial honours and awards system operated in parallel, although the last Imperial awards to be made were in June 1989.

The Australian honours and awards system consists of honours, which are appointments to orders of chivalry (namely the Order of Australia), and awards (which are decorations and medals – decorations are medals for valour, gallantry, bravery, and distinguished or conspicuous service). Medals include meritorious service medals, operational service medals, campaign medals, long service medals, commemorative medals, and the Champion Shots medal.

Both the Order of Australia, which has a General Division and Military Division (distinguished by gold banding on the edges of the ribbon), and the Australian Operational Service Medal, which has a special civilian ribbon for Defence civilians awarded it, are unique in the Australian honour and awards system in distinguishing between military and civilian awardees (although some awards in the Australian honours and awards system can only be earned by military personnel).

The Australian honours and awards system recognises the contributions of individuals, and for the Group Bravery Citation, Unit Citation for Gallantry, and Meritorious Unit Citation, the efforts of individuals as a group (the unit citations for meritorious service and gallantry also recognise members currently posted to those units, so long as they remain posted there, but without the display of the Federation Star device on those decorations that signifies personal contribution to the granting of that award). Most honours and awards are announced on Australia Day (26 January) and the King&#x27;s Birthday holiday (June), with the exception of the bravery awards (typically announced in March and August), and the Australian Antarctic Medal (announced on 21 June), although some military medals are awarded all year round (as most are not gazetted). A public database of Australian honour recipients is maintained by the federal government.

==History==
The Australian states and the Commonwealth of Australia originally used the Imperial honours system, also known as the British honours system. The creation in 1975 of the Australian honours and awards system saw Australian recommendations for the Imperial awards decline, with the last awards being gazetted in 1989. The Commonwealth of Australia ceased making recommendations for Imperial awards in 1983, with the last Queen&#x27;s Birthday Australian Honours list submitted by Queensland and Tasmania in 1989. The Queen continued to confer honours upon Australians that emanate from her personally such as the Royal Victorian Order. Only a handful of peerages and baronetcies were created for Australians. Some were in recognition of public services rendered in Britain rather than Australia. Hereditary peerages and baronetcies derive from Britain. There have never been Australian peerages or baronetcies created under the Australian Crown.

Individual Australian states, as well the Commonwealth government, were full participants in the Imperial honours system. Originally there was bipartisan support, but Australian Labor Party (ALP) governments, both national and state, ceased making recommendations for Imperial awards – in particular, appointments to the Order of the British Empire mainly after 1972. During the Second World War, the Governor-General, on the advice of wartime Labor governments, made recommendations for gallantry awards, including eleven for the Victoria Cross. Appointments to the Order of the British Empire were for officers and men engaged in operational areas.

In 1975, the ALP (which had been out of power federally from 1949 until 1972) created the Australian honours and awards system. Recommendations were processed centrally, but state governors still had the power, on the advice of their governments, to submit recommendations for Imperial awards. From 1975 until 1983, the Liberal Party was in power federally, under Malcolm Fraser and, although it retained the Australian Honours and Awards System, it reintroduced recommendations for meritorious Imperial awards, but not for Imperial awards for gallantry, bravery or distinguished service. Recommendations for Imperial awards by the federal government ceased with the election of the Hawke Labor government in 1983. In 1989, the last two states to make Imperial recommendations were Queensland and Tasmania. The defeat of both governments at the polls that year marked the end of Australian recommendations for Imperial awards.

Following the UK New Year Honours List in 1990, which contained no Australian nominations for British honours, the Queen&#x27;s Private Secretary, Sir William Heseltine, wrote to the Governor-General, saying &quot;this seems a good moment to consider whether the time has not arrived for Australia, like Canada, to honour its citizens exclusively within its own system&quot;. There followed more than two years of negotiations with state governments before the Prime Minister, Paul Keating, made the announcement on 5 October 1992 that Australia would make no further recommendations for British honours. The Australian Order of Wear states that &quot;all imperial British awards made to Australian citizens after 5 October 1992 are foreign awards and should be worn accordingly&quot;.

The Australian honours and awards system has faced various criticisms over the years. Most criticisms however are to do with who receives honours and awards, reflecting comments such as those made by Nicholas Gruen, where he said the honours and awards system had &quot;far too much to do with how much status you&#x27;ve already got ... [It&#x27;s about] seniority, power, privilege and patronage... [with] systematic selection in favour of people who just do their job, rather than go out of their way to do something selfless&quot;. Controversy attended these awards in 2021 when former tennis player Margaret Court received the Companion of the Order of Australia. Court is known for her homophobic and transphobic views, and GP Clara Tuck Meng Soo, journalist Kerry O&#x27;Brien, and artist Peter Kingston have rejected or returned their awards in protest.

==Nominating or applying for awards==
Australians become recipients of each of the 55 different types of Australian awards and honours through one of two separate processes; by nomination or by application.
* Nomination: Individual nominations may be made by members of the public or a community group for the Order of Australia and Australian Bravery Decorations. Nominations for Meritorious Service Awards are based on nominations from each specific organisation. The Department of Defence also nominates individuals for a range of service decorations. Non-Australians can be given honorary awards for &quot;extraordinary service to Australia or humanity at large&quot;. Nomination forms for the Order of Australia are available through the Australian Honours Secretariat website, or upon application to the Honours Secretariat at Government House, Canberra or from any state Government House.
* Application: Many of the honours or awards are based on an application by the recipient or a recommendation on their behalf. Awards that fall under this category include service awards for defence force and police personnel for operational service or to other individuals for special civilian services recognised by the Australian Government. Unlike Imperial bravery or gallantry awards, any person can nominate themselves for an Australian Bravery Award under the current design of the nomination form.

==Categories of honours and awards==
The Australian honours and awards system consists of the following:
* Honours An honour is an appointment to an order of chivalry, and the Order of Australia is the only chivalric order currently able to be awarded in the Australian honours and awards system.
* Awards An award is a decoration or medal awarded to a person or organisation. Decorations are awards, normally in the form of a cross or a star, made for valour, gallantry, bravery, distinguished service or conspicuous service. Medals are everything else.

There are two broad categories of honours and awards.

===Individual honours and awards===
The honours and the awards in the Australian system are, and have been:
* those within the Australian honours and awards system;
* those conferred by the sovereign in exercise of the royal prerogative;
* those within the Order of St John; 
* Imperial/British awards conferred before 6 October 1992; and 
* foreign awards, the acceptance and wearing of which have been authorised by the Governor-General.

Awards of the British Empire/United Kingdom conferred after 5 October 1992 are foreign awards.

===Military theatre and battle honours, honour titles and distinctions===

The Australian Defence Force has a system of battle honours, theatre honours, honour titles and honour distinctions to recognise exemplary service by units (not individuals) in combat and combat-related roles. Normally, Defence Honours are not awarded below sub-unit level (an organisation normally commanded by a Major or equivalent). The recommendation for the award of battle honours, theatre honours, honour titles and honour distinctions is made by a Battle Honours Committee.

There are four categories of honours in the Defence system as follows:

* Theatre Honour: A theatre of operations is defined as a geographic area in which a campaign or series of operations is conducted and for which an operational level joint or combined commander is appointed. A Theatre Honour can be made where a unit or sub-unit of any Corps is deployed under warlike conditions. Any unit that qualifies for a Battle Honour will automatically also qualify for a Theatre Honour. Examples of Theatre Honours awarded to Australian units include Gallipoli 1915, France and Flanders 1914–1918, Middle East 1941–1944, South West Pacific 1942–1945, Korea 1950–1953 and Vietnam 1965–1972.
* Battle Honour: A battle is an operational action conducted under warlike conditions. A Battle Honour is defined as the title of a battle or a series of battles fought as a campaign, an action or an engagement and is awarded to close combat elements of a Combat Corps of the Royal Australian Navy, Australian Army or Royal Australian Air Force as a public commemoration of outstanding achievement in battle(s), action or engagement. Examples of Battle Honours awarded to Australian units include the Landing at Anzac Cove, Hamel, Tobruk, Kokoda Track, Kapyong and Coral-Balmoral.

* Honour Title: An Honour Title is awarded to any non-combat unit or sub-unit that is not entitled to a Battle Honour but which satisfies the same requirements for the award of a Battle Honour. An example of the award of an Honour Title is the title Coral, awarded to 102nd Field Battery for its outstanding achievement during the Battle of Coral–Balmoral in South Vietnam.

* Honour Distinction: An Honour Distinction is defined as a public commemoration of creditable performance by a unit or sub-unit in an operation which does not attract a Theatre, Battle or Honour Title. Honour Distinctions are intended to recognise service under operational conditions in security-related, peace keeping and peace enforcement and similar operations. The first award of an Honour Distinction was the award made to the 17th Construction Squadron for the Australian contribution to the United Nations Transition Assistance Group (UNTAG) peacekeeping mission in Namibia in 1989 and 1990.

It is common that units claim Honours from original units with a historical connection to a military predecessors of the current Unit. For example, 4th/3rd Battalion, Royal New South Wales Regiment which is a modern amalgamated unit, is entitled to the previous Honours of the 3rd Battalion, the 4th Battalion as well as the World War I Honours of the 3rd and 4th Battalions First Australian Imperial Force. The term Battle Honour can be used to denote both battle and theatre honours.

Historically the system was drawn from the British system adopted during World War I but has been modified since. A relatively recent change is the introduction of the Honours for recognition of outstanding service in dangerous operations short of declared theatres of war. Defence also has a process of Defence and Service Commendations and other honours including the Army Combat Badge and Infantry Combat Badge which are awarded by Army Headquarters.

==Australian honours and awards==

===Order of Australia===
The Order of Australia insignia were designed by Stuart Devlin in 1976. Devlin used the livery colours of the Australian Coat of Arms, gold and royal blue. He also translated an individual ball of wattle blossom into a simple convex golden disc with a rich texture of beads and radiating lines accentuating a ring of blue enamel representing the sea.

The disc is surmounted by an enamel Crown. The sovereign is Head of the Order of Australia. The Governor-General is Principal Companion, Knight or Dame, and Chancellor, of the Order of Australia. The blue and gold theme is continued in the ribbon. Most of the insignia pieces are produced by the Royal Australian Mint in Canberra. The actual pieces for the two divisions of the Order are identical: it is only the ribbon which differentiates an award between the General and the Military divisions. In the Military Division the ribbon is distinguished by the addition of a narrow gold band on each edge.

When established, only the grades of Member, Officer and Companion of the Order existed. In 1976, Malcolm Fraser recommended to Queen Elizabeth II the addition of the medal and grade of Knight and Dame in the order. The grade of Knight and Dame was removed on the advice of Prime Minister Bob Hawke in 1986 without prejudice to any person who had been admitted to the order at that grade. The grade of Knight and Dame was restored on the advice of Tony Abbott (a prominent monarchist) in March 2014. In November 2015, Prime Minister Malcolm Turnbull (a prominent republican) announced that the Queen had accepted his request to amend the order&#x27;s letters patent and cease awards in this class, after Cabinet had agreed that he should advise that these titles are no longer appropriate in the Australian honours and awards system. Currently there are four grades within the Order in both Military and General Divisions. People cannot be admitted to the Order posthumously; if a person is successfully nominated but dies prior to the scheduled announcement, the date of effect of the award is deemed to be a date before they died.

The Council for the Order of Australia makes recommendations to the Governor-General as to the appropriateness of a nominee to be admitted to the Order and at what grade. It is up to the Honours Secretariat to provide the council with as much fully verified information as is possible on each nominee so that appropriate consideration may be given to each case. This is a long process and up to eighteen months can elapse between the original submission and publication of a successful nomination.

<text>Eric Robin Bell (born 3 September 1947) is a Northern Irish rock and blues musician, best known as a founding member and the original guitarist of the rock group Thin Lizzy, of which he was a member from 1969 to 1973. After his time in Thin Lizzy, he briefly fronted his own group before joining the Noel Redding Band in the mid-1970s. He has since released several solo albums and performs regularly with a blues-based trio, the Eric Bell Band.

==Career==
===Early career===
Bell was born in England on 3 September 1947 and brought up as a young child in Belfast, Northern Ireland, by his adoptive sibling-parents Harold and Ivy Bell. From Jocelyn Avenue, Woodstock Road, in the east of the city, he attended Orangefield High School. As a boy he was enthralled by the music of Lonnie Donegan and &quot;mesmerised&quot; by the guitars in the Shadows. He began his career with local groups around the Belfast area, including the last incarnation of Them to feature Van Morrison, between September and October 1966. He also played with a number of other bands including Shades of Blue, The Earth Dwellers and The Bluebeats, before joining an Irish showband named The Dreams. He left in 1969, having tired of the showband format, and at the end of that year formed a band with Irish musicians Phil Lynott, Eric Wrixon and Brian Downey. Bell suggested the name Thin Lizzy, after Tin Lizzie, a robot character in &quot;The Dandy&quot; comic.

===Thin Lizzy===

Organist Eric Wrixon left Thin Lizzy after a few months and the remaining trio later secured a contract with Decca Records. As lead guitarist, Bell played on Thin Lizzy&#x27;s first three albums &quot;Thin Lizzy&quot;, &quot;Shades of a Blue Orphanage&quot; and &quot;Vagabonds of the Western World&quot;, as well as their hit single &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot;. He co-wrote a number of songs with Lynott and Downey, including &quot;The Rocker&quot; which became a live favourite throughout the band&#x27;s career. He also composed one song on his own, &quot;Ray Gun&quot;, from their first album, &quot;Thin Lizzy&quot;.

Although Thin Lizzy gained in popularity during the early 1970s, the pressures of recording, touring and the excesses of the rock star lifestyle began to take their toll. He left the band after a New Year&#x27;s Eve concert in 1973, after throwing his guitar into the air in the middle of the concert, pushing the amplifiers into the audience and storming off stage. He stated later that he had no regrets about leaving: &quot;I really had to leave because of ill-health. It was exhaustion, and the majority of things that were available to me... I couldn&#x27;t really handle it.&quot; He was temporarily replaced by Gary Moore.

===The Noel Redding Band===
In 1974, after a brief period fronting his own Eric Bell Band, Bell was recruited by ex-Jimi Hendrix sideman Noel Redding, along with guitarist/singer Dave Clarke and drummer Les Sampson, to form the Noel Redding Band. Bell was unsure of the musical direction Redding was taking, but went on to record two albums with the group before they split in 1976. A third album of unused tracks was released in 1995. Bell composed the song &quot;Love and War&quot; for the second album, &quot;Blowin&#x27;&quot;.

===The 1980s and Mainsqueeze===

In 1980, Bell reunited with Thin Lizzy to record a tribute song to Jimi Hendrix, &quot;Song for Jimmy&quot; [sic], which was released as an orange flexi disc and given away with &quot;Flexipop&quot; in August 1981. It was later included on Thin Lizzy&#x27;s &quot;Vagabonds, Kings, Warriors, Angels&quot; box set in 2002, although much of Eric Bell&#x27;s lead guitar work was missing from this version as the relevant master tapes could not be found. Bell also appeared as a guest on Thin Lizzy&#x27;s final tour in 1983 and the accompanying live album, &quot;Life&quot;.

Bell had also reactivated his own band in the late 1970s and released an EP in 1981.

Bell subsequently joined saxophonist Dick Heckstall-Smith&#x27;s eight-piece blues rock ensemble Mainsqueeze. They toured Europe, recorded a live album in 1983 and later toured as Bo Diddley&#x27;s backing group, recording the &quot;Hey... Bo Diddley: In Concert&quot; album in 1986.

===Later career===
Bell has continued to perform and record with the Eric Bell Band throughout the 1990s and 2000s, releasing several albums. He has also recorded with the Barrelhouse Brothers.

In 2005, he joined Gary Moore onstage to perform &quot;Whiskey in the Jar&quot; at the Phil Lynott tribute concert &quot;The Boy Is Back in Town&quot; in the Point Theatre, Dublin. This was released on a DVD called &quot;One Night in Dublin: A Tribute to Phil Lynott&quot;. Bell lived in Dublin, then London before moving to West Cork, Ireland, then to Carrodore in the Ards Peninsula, County Down.

Bell later blasted heavy metal band Metallica for failing to pay him £2,000 for a live show in Dublin in 1999.

In November 2024 Bell was presented with the Legend Award at the Northern Ireland Music Prizes.

<text>Mexipedium is a monotypic genus of the orchid family Orchidaceae, subfamily Cypripedioideae, consisting of only one species, Mexipedium xerophyticum. It is also the sole genus of tribe Mexipedieae and subtribe Mexipediinae.

==Taxonomy and discovery==
This species was initially described as &quot;Phragmipedium xerophyticum&quot; by Soto Arenas, Salazar &amp; Hágsater in 1990, but transferred to its own genus by Albert &amp; Chase in 1992, in part based on results from DNA analysis. The genus &quot;Mexipedium&quot; is listed as &quot;Phragmipedium&quot; in Appendix I of the Convention on International Trade in Endangered Species (CITES), and for other legal purposes. Allied genera include &quot;Cypripedium&quot;, &quot;Paphiopedilum&quot;, &quot;Selenipedium&quot; and &quot;Phragmipedium&quot;.

Its name is derived from the country of origin Mexico and the Latin &quot;&quot; (“foot”), referring to the slipper-shaped lip. The specific epithet &quot;xerophyticum&quot; is from the Greek &quot;ξηρός&quot; (&quot;xērós&quot;, &quot;dry&quot;) and &quot;φυτόν&quot; (&quot;phutón&quot;, &quot;plant&quot;), referring to its preference for dry conditions.

&quot;Mexipedium xerophyticum&quot; is known from a single location in Oaxaca, Mexico. Only seven plants were observed at the time of its discovery. &quot;Mexipedium&quot; was recently rediscovered in a nearby locality. A small number of plants were removed for propagation in case plant hunters eradicated the wild stock. Plants are now available as propagules.

==Description and habitat==
This is a lithophytic orchid, growing on cliffs, shielded from the sun, at an elevation of . But it grows as well on rocks or in the detritus in crevasses. Its growth form is unusual in that it tends to spread by runners, offset from the parent plant by several centimeters. The silvery-green leaves are small, stiff and semi-erect. The tiny white-pink flowers show a shieldlike, pinkish staminode and a slipper-shaped lip. The curved petals are scythe-shaped. Inflorescences are multifloral and branched.

<text>Zygopetalum (abbreviated Z.) is a genus of the orchid family (Orchidaceae). This genus consists of fourteen currently recognized species.

== Name ==
This orchid&#x27;s generic name, derived from the Greek word &quot;zugón&quot;, means &quot;yoke&quot;. It refers to the yoke-like growth at the base of the lip.

The genus name has &quot;Z.&quot; as a unique abbreviation among orchid genera.

== Distribution ==
They occur in humid forests at low- to mid-elevation regions of South America, with most species in Brazil.

== Description ==
Most species are epiphytes, but some are terrestrials with glossy, strap-like, plicate leaves, which are apical, oblong or elliptic-lanceolate, acute or acuminate. These orchids have a robust growth form. Their ovoid-conical pseudobulbs are deciduous.

They produce an erect, 60-centimeter-long, few-flowered to several-flowered, racemose inflorescence that grows laterally and is longer than the leaves. Their prominent bracts equal the length of the ovary. They are known for their fragrant, waxy, and long-lived flowers with multiple blooms in shades of green, purple, burgundy, and raspberry with several patterns.

== Cultivation ==
They are known for their ease of culture and are much in demand as excellent cut flowers.

<text>The Pajottenland (; in English occasionally Payottenland) is a distinct region within the Flemish Brabant province and the south-western part of the Brussels Region of Belgium. The region is located west-southwest of Brussels. The Pajottenland is predominantly farmland, with occasional gently rolling hills, and lies mostly between the rivers Dender and Zenne / Senne. The area has historically provided food and drink for the citizens of Brussels, especially Lambic beers, which are only produced here and in the Zenne valley where Brussels is.

==Geography==

The Pajottenland is generally understood to cover the following municipalities and submunicipalities:
*Affligem: Essene, Hekelgem and Teralfene 
*Asse: Asse, Bekkerzeel, Kobbegem, Mollem, Relegem and Zellik
*Bever
*Dilbeek: Dilbeek, Itterbeek (with Sint-Anna-Pede), Schepdaal (with Sint-Gertrudis-Pede), Sint-Martens-Bodegem, Sint-Ulriks-Kapelle, Groot-Bijgaarden
*Galmaarden: Galmaarden, Tollembeek, Vollezele
*Gooik: Gooik (with Strijland), Kester, Leerbeek, Oetingen
*Herne: Herne (with Kokejane), Herfelingen, Sint-Pieters-Kapelle
*Lennik: Gaasbeek, Sint-Kwintens-Lennik (with Eizeringen), Sint-Martens-Lennik
*Liedekerke
*Pepingen: Pepingen, Beert, Bellingen, Bogaarden, Elingen, Heikruis
*Roosdaal: Pamel (with Ledeberg), Borchtlombeek, Onze-Lieve-Vrouw-Lombeek, Strijtem, Kattem
*Sint-Pieters-Leeuw: Sint-Pieters-Leeuw, Oudenaken, Ruisbroek, Sint-Laureins-Berchem, Vlezenbeek
*Ternat: Ternat, Sint-Katherina-Lombeek, Wambeek

According to a lawyer named De Gronckel who first described it, the Pajottenland also includes Liedekerke and the Ninove deelgemeenten Neigem and Lieferinge. The rural part of Anderlecht, particularly in earlier times before it became a municipality of the Brussels region, may also be included.

The tourist area marketed under the name &quot;Pajottenland en Zennevallei&quot; (Pajottenland and Zenne Valley) also includes the municipalities Beersel, Drogenbos, Halle, Linkebeek, Sint-Genesius-Rode, which are clustered around the Zenne Valley to the south-west of the main Pajottenland region.

<text>General Baptists are Baptists who hold the &quot;general&quot; or unlimited atonement view, the belief that Jesus Christ died for the entire world and not just for the chosen elect. General Baptists are theologically Arminian, which distinguishes them from Reformed Baptists (also known as &quot;Particular Baptists&quot; for their belief in particular redemption). Free Will Baptists are General Baptists; opponents of the English General Baptists in North Carolina dubbed them &quot;Freewillers&quot; and they later assumed the name. General Baptist denominations have explicated their faith in two major confessions of faith, &quot;The Standard Confession&quot; (1660), and &quot;The Orthodox Creed&quot; (1678).

== History ==
In the late 16th and early 17th century General Baptists were led by John Smyth and Thomas Helwys. Under Helwys&#x27; leadership, this group established a church at Spitalfields outside London. Helwys is credited with the formation of a general Baptist congregation in Coventry in 1614 or earlier when he gathered with Smyth and leading Coventry Puritans at the residence of Sir William Bowes and his wife, Isobel, in 1606. Thomas Grantham, along with others, presented a confession of beliefs to King Charles II in 1660. 

A respected Biblical scholar, Dr. Charles Marie Du Veil, was baptized into the St. Paul&#x27;s Alley congregation, published his new views, and helped the General Baptist influence after 1685. In 1733 a case against several Northamptonshire congregations was presented to the General Assembly of General Baptists for &quot;singing the psalms of David or other men&#x27;s composures&quot; which determined no fixed rule on congregational singing, but deferred to the local church to set forth their own reasons as the general assembly had in 1689.

In 1825, opponents of General Baptists in North Carolina dubbed them &quot;Freewillers&quot; and they later assumed the name Free Will Baptists. 

General Baptists who accepted the existence of a second work of grace during the Holiness movement established denominations such as the Ohio Valley Association of the Christian Baptist Churches of God and Holiness Baptist Association.

<text>Peter B. Short (born July 22, 1948) is an ordained minister and was the 38th Moderator of the United Church of Canada from 2003 until 2006. He was elected Moderator at the denomination&#x27;s meeting of the 38th General Council in Wolfville, Nova Scotia. 

==Early life and career==
Short was born in Kingston, Ontario and grew up in Arnprior and Braeside, Ontario. In 1978, he graduated from Emmanuel College, and was ordained by the Maritime Conference of the United Church of Canada. He subsequently served as minister to a number of congregations in eastern and northern Canada.

Short was elected as Moderator at the 38th General Council of the United Church in August 2003. Shortly after his election, he said, &quot;Our identity as The United Church of Canada is not in our denomination, and has never been in our denomination. Our identity is in following Jesus Christ and crossing boundaries that divide people, that alienate people and that condemn people, until we stand on common ground and there is a place at the table for all.&quot; As Moderator he strove to &quot;turn on the lights of our mission work, the critical work for justice, peace and reconciliation&quot;.

Following the passage of same-sex marriage legislation by the Canadian federal government in June 2005, Short noted in a pastoral letter to all congregations of the United Church that the topic was deeply divisive. But he urged church members to not simply be for or against the issue. &quot;This would be a bad time to be carried off by the songs of victory or by the laments of resentment. Beneath the louder music of public ideologies there is a gospel invitation that is being sounded, an invitation to a great banquet. And &#x27;blessed is anyone who will eat bread in the Kingdom of God.&#x27;&quot;

==Personal==
Short is married to Susan Crawford. They have four children.

<doc id="363089" wikidata="Q7007413" url="?curid=363089" title="New England Telephone and Telegraph Company">
<text>The first incarnation of the New England Telephone and Telegraph Company was a short-lived company set up to develop the then-new telephone. New England Telephone and Telegraph lasted only a year as a separate entity, from 1878 to 1879, and had no direct relationship with the later company of the same name, which after the breakup of the Bell System in 1984 became part of the NYNEX Corporation, now part of Verizon.

== History ==

The New England Telephone and Telegraph Company was formed February 12, 1878, by investors in the states of Massachusetts and Rhode Island at the behest of an agent of Gardiner Greene Hubbard, the father-in-law of telephone inventor Alexander Graham Bell.

New England Telephone and Telegraph merged with the Bell Telephone Company (which was started on the basis of holding &quot;potentially valuable patents&quot;), on February 17, 1879, to form the National Bell Telephone Company, at which time Theodore Vail took over its operations. The National Bell Telephone Company merged with others on March 20, 1880, to form the American Bell Telephone Company.

== Later acquisition of American Bell by AT&amp;T ==

The American Bell Telephone Company was later purchased by its own subsidiary, American Telephone &amp; Telegraph (AT&amp;T) on December 30, 1899. Thus share ownership of New England Telephone and Telegraph evolved into ownership of AT&amp;T. AT&amp;T would later undergo mergers with SBC Communications and BellSouth to become &quot;The New AT&amp;T&quot;.

<text>Million years ago, abbreviated as Mya, Myr (megayear) or Ma (megaannum), is a unit of time equal to (i.e. years), or approximately 31.6 teraseconds.

==Usage==
Myr is in common use in fields such as Earth science and cosmology. Myr is also used with Mya or Ma. Together they make a reference system, one to a quantity, the other to a particular point in a year numbering system that is &quot;time before the present&quot;.

Myr is deprecated in geology, but in astronomy &quot;Myr&quot; is standard. Where &quot;myr&quot; &quot;is&quot; seen in geology, it is usually &quot;Myr&quot; (a unit of mega-years). In astronomy, it is usually &quot;Myr&quot; (Million years).

== Debate ==
In geology, a debate remains open concerning the use of &quot;Myr&quot; (duration) plus &quot;Mya&quot; (million years ago) versus using only the term &quot;Ma&quot;. In either case, the term &quot;Ma&quot; is used in geology literature conforming to ISO 31-1 (now ISO 80000-3) and NIST 811 recommended practices. Traditional style geology literature is written: 
The &quot;ago&quot; is implied, so that any such year number &quot;X Ma&quot; between 66 and 145 is &quot;Cretaceous&quot;, for good reason. But the counter argument is that having &quot;myr&quot; for a duration and &quot;Mya&quot; for an age mixes unit systems, and tempts capitalization errors: &quot;million&quot; need not be capitalized, but &quot;mega&quot; must be; &quot;ma&quot; would technically imply a &quot;milliyear&quot; (a thousandth of a year, or 8 hours). On this side of the debate, one avoids &quot;myr&quot; and simply adds &quot;ago&quot; explicitly (or adds &quot;BP&quot;), as in: 
In this case, &quot;79 Ma&quot; means only a quantity of 79 million years, without the meaning of &quot;79 million years ago&quot;.

<text>John Slidell (1793July 9, 1871) was an American politician, lawyer, slaveholder, and businessman. A native of New York, Slidell moved to Louisiana as a young man. He was a member of the Louisiana House of Representatives, U.S. House of Representatives and the U.S. Senate. He was one of two Confederate diplomats captured by the United States Navy from the British ship RMS &quot;Trent&quot; in 1861 and later released. He was the older brother of Alexander Slidell Mackenzie, a U.S. naval officer.

==Early life==
He was born to merchant John Slidell and Margery née Mackenzie, a Scot. He graduated from Columbia University (then Columbia College) in 1810. In 1835, Slidell married Mathilde Deslonde. They had three children: Alfred Slidell, Marie Rosine (later [on 30 Sept. 1872] &quot;comtesse&quot; [Countess] de St. Roman), and Marguerite Mathilde (later [on 3 Oct. 1864] &quot;baronne&quot; [Baroness] Frederic Emile d&#x27;Erlanger).

==Political career==
He was the United States Attorney for the Eastern District of Louisiana from 1829 to 1833; his brother Thomas Slidell held the post from 1837 to 1838.

Prior to the Mexican-American War, Slidell was sent to Mexico by President James Knox Polk to negotiate an agreement whereby the Rio Grande would be the southern border of Texas. He also was instructed to offer, among other alternatives, a maximum of $25 million for California by Polk and his administration. Slidell warned Polk that the Mexican reluctance to negotiate a peaceful solution might require a show of military force by the United States to defend the border. Under the command of General Zachary Taylor, U.S. troops were sent into the disputed area between the Rio Grande and Nueces Rivers. The Mexican government, in a state of chaos at the time, rejected Slidell&#x27;s mission. After Mexican forces repelled a U.S. scouting expedition, the United States declared war on Mexico on May 13, 1846.

Slidell developed a close friendship with James Buchanan when Buchanan was Secretary of State.

Slidell was elected to the Senate in 1853 and cast his lot with other pro-Southern congressmen to repeal the Missouri Compromise, acquire Cuba, and admit Kansas as a slave state. In the 1860 campaign, Slidell supported Democratic presidential candidate John C. Breckinridge but remained a pro-Union moderate until Abraham Lincoln&#x27;s election resulted in the Southern states seceding. At the Democratic National Convention in Charleston, South Carolina, in April 1860, Slidell plotted with Fire-Eaters, such as William Lowndes Yancey of Alabama, to stymie the nomination of the popular Northern Democratic Senator Stephen A. Douglas of Illinois.

==Civil War==
Slidell soon accepted a diplomatic appointment to represent the Confederacy in France. Slidell was one of the two Confederate diplomats involved in the &quot;Trent&quot; Affair in November 1861. After he was appointed the Confederate commissioner to France in September 1861, he ran the blockade from Charleston, South Carolina, with James Murray Mason of Virginia. They then set sail from Havana on the British mail boat steamer RMS &quot;Trent&quot; but were intercepted by the US Navy while en route and taken into captivity at Fort Warren in Boston.

The northern public erupted in a huge display of triumphalism at this dramatic capture. Even the cool-headed Lincoln was swept along in the celebratory spirit, but when he and his cabinet studied the likely consequences of a war with Britain, their enthusiasm waned. After some careful diplomatic exchanges, they admitted that the capture had been conducted contrary to maritime law
and that private citizens could not be classified as &quot;enemy despatches.&quot; Slidell and Mason were released, and war was averted.

After the resolution of the &quot;Trent&quot; Affair, the two diplomats set sail for England on January 1, 1862. From England, Slidell at once went to Paris, where, in February 1862, he paid his first visit to the French minister of foreign affairs. His mission to gain recognition of the Confederate States by France failed, as did his effort to negotiate a commercial agreement
for France to get control of Southern cotton if the blockade were broken. In both cases, France refused to move without the co-operation of England. He succeeded in negotiating a loan of $15,000,000 from Emile Erlanger &amp; Co. and in securing the ship &quot;Stonewall&quot; for the Confederate government.

==Later life==
Slidell moved to Paris, France, after the Civil War. He died in Cowes, Isle of Wight, England, at age 78. Along with Judah P. Benjamin and A. Dudley Mann, Slidell was among the high-ranking Confederate officials buried abroad.

==Family==
John Slidell was the brother of Alexander Slidell Mackenzie, a naval officer who commanded the USS &quot;Somers&quot;, on which a unique event occurred in 1842 off the coast of Africa during the Blockade of Africa. Three crewmen were hanged after being convicted of mutiny at sea. Mackenzie reversed the order of his middle and last names to honor a maternal uncle.

Slidell was also the brother-in-law of the American naval Commodore Matthew C. Perry, who was married to Slidell&#x27;s sister, Jane. Another brother, Thomas Slidell, was chief justice of the Louisiana Supreme Court.

==Legacy==
The city of Slidell in St. Tammany Parish, Louisiana, was named in his honor by his son-in-law, Baron Frederic Emile d&#x27;Erlanger; the village of Slidell, Texas, is also named after him.

<doc id="363112" wikidata="Q5006980" url="?curid=363112" title="C. Z. Guest">
<text>Lucy Douglas &quot;C.Z.&quot; Guest (née Cochrane; February 19, 1920 – November 8, 2003) was an American actress, author, columnist, horsewoman, fashion designer, and socialite who achieved a degree of fame as a fashion icon. She was frequently seen wearing elegant designs by designers like Mainbocher. Her unfussy, clean-cut style was seen as typically American, and she was named to the International Best Dressed Hall of Fame List in 1959.

==Life and career==
She was born on February 19, 1920, in Boston, Massachusetts to Vivian Hervey Wessell and Alexander Lynde Cochrane, an investment banker who belonged to a family of Boston Brahmins. Her brother called her Sissy, and she transformed that into C.Z. She had two sisters, Nancy (née Cochrane) Palmer of Johns Island, Florida and Jean &quot;Neenie&quot; (née Cochrane) Cameron Welch of Knockbrack Grange, near Oldcastle in County Meath, Ireland.

In 1937, she was presented as a debutante and, in 1939, she was voted the &quot;Glamor Girl of the Massachusetts North Shore in a beauty contest which prompted her to have a stint as a showgirl. She dabbled in acting, including an appearance in the Ziegfeld Follies in 1944.

On March 8, 1947, she married Winston Frederick Churchill Guest, a U.S. national polo champion and the son of Frederick Guest, who was a son of Ivor Bertie Guest, 1st Baron Wimborne, and Lady Cornelia Henrietta Maria Spencer-Churchill (daughter of John Spencer-Churchill, 7th Duke of Marlborough) and who, through his mother, was a first cousin of Sir Winston Churchill. Ernest Hemingway was best man at the wedding, which took place at Hemingway&#x27;s home in Havana, Cuba. The couple had two children, Alexander Guest and Cornelia Guest. C.Z. Guest was pictured on the cover of the July 20, 1962, issue of &quot;Time&quot; magazine as part of an article on American society.

After a horse riding accident in 1976, Guest was asked by the &quot;New York Post&quot; to write a column on gardening. Her first book, &quot;First Garden&quot;, was illustrated by her friend Cecil Beaton. Other friends included Truman Capote, Sawai Man Singh II of Jaipur, Barbara Hutton, Diana Vreeland, Babe Paley and William S. Paley, Gloria Guinness and Thomas &quot;Loel&quot; Guinness, and the Duke and Duchess of Windsor, who were the godparents of their children.

She was painted by Diego Rivera, Salvador Dalí, Kenneth Paul Block, and Andy Warhol.

In 1985, she designed a small fashion collection consisting mainly of cashmere sweaters that was introduced at a show of the Cuban-born American designer Adolfo, well known for dressing Nancy Reagan and Babe Paley. In 1986, she expanded her design work to include a limited line of sportswear sold under license, and, in 1990, she came out with a fragrant insect repellent and other garden merchandise.

==Death==
Guest died on November 8, 2003, in Old Westbury, New York, at the age of 83, as a friend was driving her to the hospital after she experienced breathing difficulties at home.

<doc id="363119" wikidata="Q836697" url="?curid=363119" title="Love over Gold">
<text>Love over Gold is the fourth studio album by British rock band Dire Straits, released on 24 September 1982 by Vertigo Records internationally and by Warner Bros. Records in the United States. The album featured two singles: &quot;Private Investigations&quot;, which reached No. 2 on the UK Singles Chart, and &quot;Industrial Disease&quot;, which reached No. 9 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Hot Mainstream Rock Tracks chart in the United States. The title track was never released as a single, but two years later a live version from &quot;&quot; reached #15 in France, #29 in New Zealand, #43 in the Netherlands and #50 in the band&#x27;s native United Kingdom. The album reached number one on album charts in Australia, Austria, Italy, New Zealand, Norway and the United Kingdom, as well as number 19 in the United States. &quot;Love over Gold&quot; was later certified gold in the United States, platinum in France and Germany and double platinum in Canada and the United Kingdom.

==Background==
Following the end of the On Location Tour on 6 July 1981 in Luxembourg, Mark Knopfler began writing songs for Dire Straits&#x27; next album. Keyboard player Alan Clark and Californian guitarist Hal Lindes, who both joined the band at the end of 1980 for the On Location Tour, would also be involved with the new album. This was also the last album to feature drummer Pick Withers.

Knopfler was inspired to write &quot;Telegraph Road&quot; after Dire Straits&#x27; tour bus drove for miles along Telegraph Road in Detroit:

==Recording==
&quot;Love over Gold&quot; was recorded at the Power Station in New York from 8 March to 11 June 1982. Knopfler produced the album, with Neil Dorfsman as his engineer—the first in a long line of collaborations between the two.

Knopfler used several guitars during the sessions, including four Schecter Stratocasters—two red, one blue, and one sunburst—a black Schecter Telecaster, an Ovation classical guitar on &quot;Private Investigations&quot; and &quot;Love over Gold&quot;, a custom Erlewine Automatic on &quot;Industrial Disease&quot; and his 1937 National steel guitar on &quot;Telegraph Road&quot;. Knopfler also used Ovation twelve- and six-string acoustic guitars during the recording.

A few songs were written and recorded during the &quot;Love over Gold&quot; sessions that were not released on the album. &quot;Private Dancer&quot; was originally planned for the album, with all but the vocal tracks being recorded. Knopfler decided that a female voice would be more appropriate and handed the song to Tina Turner for her comeback album, &quot;Private Dancer&quot;. &quot;The Way It Always Starts&quot; ended up on Knopfler&#x27;s soundtrack to the film &quot;Local Hero&quot;, with vocals sung by Gerry Rafferty. &quot;Badges, Posters, Stickers and T-Shirts&quot; was cut from the album and later released in the UK as a B-side to &quot;Private Investigations&quot; and in the United States as the B-side to &quot;Industrial Disease&quot;. It was subsequently released in the United States as the third track on the &quot;ExtendedancEPlay&quot; EP.

==Release==
&quot;Love over Gold&quot; was released on 20 September 1982 initially on vinyl LP and cassette, and later on compact disc. &quot;Private Investigations&quot; was released as the lead single from the album in Europe. It reached the number 2 position in the United Kingdom, despite its almost seven minute length, and was Dire Straits’ first single in the UK to reach the top 5. In the United States the shortest track &quot;Industrial Disease&quot; was released as a single, reaching the 75 position on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 in 1983.

The album was remastered and reissued with the rest of the Dire Straits catalogue in 1996 by Vertigo Records internationally, and in 2000 by Warner Bros. records in the United States. The remastered CD features slightly altered cover art; the album title is rendered underneath the band name, both in larger type, rather than arranged across the top. The image of lightning is also somewhat zoomed in and made brighter, making for a more purple color. It remains the only remastered Dire Straits CD with altered cover art (the U.S. remastered CD still retains the original vinyl LP art).

&quot;Love over Gold&quot; was the final album to feature original drummer Pick Withers, who was replaced by former Dave Edmunds / Rockpile drummer Terry Williams. Dire Straits then embarked on the eight-month-long Love Over Gold Tour which finished with two sold-out concerts at London&#x27;s Hammersmith Odeon on 22 and 23 July 1983. In January 1983 a four-song EP titled &quot;ExtendedancEPlay&quot; was released while &quot;Love over Gold&quot; was still in the album charts. The double album &quot;Alchemy Live&quot; was a recording of excerpts from the final two concerts of the tour and was reportedly released without studio overdubs. The concert was also issued on VHS and Laserdisc, and was remastered and released on DVD and Blu-ray in 2010.

&quot;Private Investigations&quot; continued to be played throughout the &quot;Brothers in Arms&quot; and &quot;On Every Street&quot; tours, while &quot;Telegraph Road&quot; returned to the band&#x27;s set list in 1992 during the last half of Dire Straits&#x27; final tour, and Knopfler continued to play the track during his tours as a solo artist.

==Critical reception==
In a contemporary review for &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;, David Fricke called &quot;Love over Gold&quot; &quot;an ambitious, sometimes difficult record that is exhilarating in its successes and, at the very least, fascinating in its indulgences.&quot; Fricke remarked that the album more deeply and at times more dramatically explores a dichotomy present on Dire Straits&#x27; earlier albums, between fiery angst and soft sensitivity. He concluded that &quot;in a period when most pop music is conceived purely as product, &quot;Love over Gold&quot; dares to put art before airplay.&quot;

In a retrospective review for AllMusic, Stephen Thomas Erlewine said that the addition of a new rhythm guitarist &quot;expands [Dire Straits&#x27;] sounds and ambitions&quot;. Erlewine added, &quot;Since Mark Knopfler is a skilled, tasteful guitarist, he can sustain interest even throughout the languid stretches, but the long, atmospheric, instrumental passages aren&#x27;t as effective as the group&#x27;s tight blues-rock, leaving &quot;Love over Gold&quot; only a fitfully engaging listen.&quot;

<text>Dubailand was an entertainment complex planned to be built in Dubai, United Arab Emirates, which was owned by Tatweer (which belongs to Dubai Holding). When announced in 2003 it was one of the most ambitious leisure developments ever proposed anywhere in the world costing $64.3 billion. The development was put on hold in 2008, due to the 2007–2008 financial crisis, Great Recession, and the Dubai housing crash in 2009, but resumed in mid-2013. Updates in 2013 showed that $55 billion had been raised towards the works.

Some projects were cancelled, although Dubailand has since become the name of an entertainment district in Dubai where some of the planned projects for the Dubailand complex have opened. Other projects are being built and are planned to open in 2025.

==Development==

Dubailand was announced on 23 October 2003. It would have an area of , twice the size of Walt Disney World, and comprise 45 &quot;mega projects&quot; and 200 sub projects. Over the years, there were 22 projects under construction. Dubailand was divided into six zones (worlds): Attractions and Experience World, Sports and Outdoor World, Eco-Tourism World, Themed Leisure and Vacation World, Retail and Entertainment World, and Downtown, the largest collection of theme parks in the world.

The Sahara Kingdom theme park, situated in the Attractions &amp; Experience World, would cover and would combine high end virtual and physical theme park rides, attractions such as a state of the art gaming zone, IMAX theater, and integrated live and virtual entertainment shows, together with a retail zone, four hotels and residential accommodations. The theme of the development was traditional Arabian folklore and the tales of &quot;One Thousand and One Nights&quot;.

In 2006, planning permission was granted for the Great Dubai Wheel, a giant Ferris wheel with 30 passenger capsules, to be built and managed by the Great Wheel Corporation. It was expected to open in 2009, at a cost of over AED 250 million. In January 2012, it was announced that the Great Dubai Wheel would not be built.

In 2008, most of the developments in Dubailand were put on hold and virtually all of the staff and workforce were fired due to the 2007–2008 financial crisis.

On 19 January 2008, DreamWorks announced plans to build a theme park in Dubailand.

On 4 March 2008, Tatweer announced a strategic alliance with Six Flags to build the Six Flags Dubailand theme park.

On 1 May 2008, Tatweer announced the launch of Freej Dubailand. Freej Dubailand would boast hotels totalling 2,600 keys, and feature retail, food and beverage outlets, as well as a spectrum of entertainment attractions.

On 2 May 2008, it was announced that the design and conceptual master plan for a Marvel Superheroes theme park had been finalized, the first of its kind. It would have included 17 rides and attractions on a development. It would also comprise nine retail outlets on an area of . Over 40 food and beverage outlets, including carts merchandising light refreshments, would be developed over .

On 6 May 2008, Tatweer announced a strategic alliance with Merlin Entertainments Group to build a Legoland park in Dubailand. The project would have cost AED 912 million, occupy a total of , and would feature more than 40 interactive rides, shows and attractions geared towards families with children ages 2 to 12.

At this point, Dubai Properties Group took over Dubailand from Tatweer. American park franchises Six Flags and DreamWorks announced having dropped their projects, citing loss of interest.

In September 2012, Dubai Properties Group announced the revival of the Mudon residential community project, estimating the completion of the project at around 18 months.

Construction on the site resumed in early 2013, with the Dubai Miracle Gardens opening at the beginning of March. The adjacent Dubai Butterfly Garden opened in 2015.

In October 2016, Legoland Dubai was opened at Dubai Parks and Resorts, from Dubailand. In December 2016, Motiongate Dubai, which incorporates DreamWorks&#x27; attractions, opened at Dubai Parks and Resorts.

<text>Pharaonism was an ideology that rose to prominence in Egypt in the 1920s and 1930s. A version of Egyptian nationalism, it argued for the existence of an Egyptian national continuity from ancient history to the modern era, stressing the role of ancient Egypt and incorporating anti-colonial sentiment. Pharaonism&#x27;s most notable advocate was Taha Hussein. The movement largely faded by the 1940s, having failed to resonate with most Egyptians, and was superseded by pan-Arabism and Islamism.

==Egyptian identity==
Egyptian identity since the Iron Age Egyptian Empire evolved for the longest period under the influence of native Egyptian culture, religion and identity (see Ancient Egypt). The Egyptians came subsequently under the influence of a succession of several foreign rulers, including Persians, Greco-Macedonians, Romans and Arab Caliphates. Under these foreign rulers, the Egyptians accommodated three new religions, Christianity, Judaism, and Islam, and produced a new language, Egyptian Arabic. By the 4th century, the majority of the Egyptians had converted to Christianity and in 535 the Roman Emperor Justinian ordered the Temple of Isis at Philae closed, which marked the formal end of the ancient religion of Egypt.

During the Middle Ages, the monuments of the ancient Egyptian civilization were sometimes destroyed as remnants of a time of &quot;jahiliyyah&quot; (&quot;pre-Islamic ignorance&quot;). The majority of the destruction of the ruins occurred in the 13th and 14th centuries, a time of floods, famines and plagues in Egypt, leading some people to believe that Allah was punishing the Egyptians for the continued existence of these relics of a time of &quot;jahiliyyah&quot;. The most notable acts of destruction in the Middle Ages were the tearing down of a statue of the goddess Isis in 1311 in Fustat and the destruction of a temple in Memphis in 1350, which inspired much relief when it was discovered the &quot;evil eye&quot; (the eye of Horus) on the temple&#x27;s walls did not cause the deaths of those destroying the temple as feared.

The Quran singled out the Pharaoh whose story is related in the Book of Exodus as an especially vicious tyrant opposed to Allah, and in general the Pharaohs are portrayed in Islamic tradition as depraved despots reveling in &quot;jahiliyyah&quot;. Several Muslim leaders such as the Caliph Yazid III ordered the destruction of all the pharaonic monuments. However, there is considerable evidence of popular local pride in monuments such as the Giza Pyramids and the Sphinx, so much that these monuments were never destroyed out of the fear of causing riots. The monuments of Pharaonic Egypt were generally seen as possessing magical powers and were viewed as objects of respect by ordinary Egyptians, despite the fact that the Quran execrates ancient Egyptian beliefs (such as polytheism and the worship of Pharaohs) as an especially reprehensible period of &quot;jahiliyyah&quot;. As late as 1378, it was reported that nominally Muslim peasants would go burn incense at night in front of the Sphinx while uttering prayers which were said to empower the Sphinx to speak, which led a Sufi holy man to attack the Sphinx. Local legends claimed the attack on the Sphinx led to a massive sand storm at Giza, which only ended with the holy man&#x27;s lynching.

In Egypt, the belief in the magical powers of the Pyramids and ancient ruins played a significant role in their preservation. Some even warned of dire consequences if they were destroyed, leading to the conclusion that leaving them untouched was the best option. These beliefs demonstrated a sense of pride and reverence for Egypt&#x27;s ancient past. Additionally, in the Middle Ages, Egyptians created a story associating the Pharaoh mentioned in religious texts with Iran, aiming to salvage pride despite the condemnation in the Quran. To safeguard the ruins, they often attributed them to Islamic figures, making them quasi-Islamic sites that were protected from destruction.

Because knowledge of the hieroglyphs was lost from the 6th century until 1822 when Jean-François Champollion deciphered the Rosetta Stone, the memory of ancient Egypt was that of an impressive civilization which built various monuments whose precise meaning had been long since been lost, limiting the extent of popular identification with it. Mohammad Ali the Great, the Albanian tobacco merchant turned Ottoman &quot;vali&quot; (governor) of Egypt and who ruled the country with an iron hand from 1805 until his death in 1849, had no interest in the ruins of ancient Egypt except as a source of gifts for foreign leaders. Likewise, Mohammad Ali had a permissive attitude towards Europeans taking ancient Egyptian relics with them, allowing much plundering of various sites such as by the Italian Giovanni Battista Belzoni while a diplomatic posting in Cairo was highly sought after owing to opportunities for looting. One of Mohammad Ali&#x27;s officials, Rifa&#x27;a al-Tahtawi, persuaded him in 1836 to embark on preserving Egypt&#x27;s heritage by ending the plundering of sites in Egypt and to create a museum to display Egypt&#x27;s treasures instead of letting them be taken to Europe. Tahtawi later published a history of ancient Egypt in 1868, which took advantage of the discoveries of archaeologists and the deciphering of the hieroglyphs, which marked the first time that the heritage of ancient Egypt was used as a symbol of national pride in modern Egypt.

==Nationalism==
Questions of identity came to the fore in the 20th century as Egyptians sought to end the British occupation of Egypt, leading to the rise of ethno-territorial secular Egyptian nationalism (also known as &quot;Pharaonism&quot;). Pharaonism became the dominant mode of expression of Egyptian anti-colonial activists of the pre- and inter-war periods, according to modern historian and University of Colorado professor James P. Jankowski;
Pharaonism celebrated Egypt as a distinct geographic and political unit whose origins went back to the unification of Upper and Lower Egypt in about 3100 BC, and which presented Egypt as more closely linked to Europe rather than to the Middle East. The focus on the ancient Egyptian past was used as a symbol of Egyptian distinctiveness, which was used to down-play Arab and Islamic identities, and was intended to brand Egypt as a European rather than a Near Eastern nation. Pharaonism first appeared in the early 20th century in the writings of Mustafa Kamil Pasha who called Egypt the world&#x27;s first state and Ahmed Lutfi el-Sayed who wrote about a &quot;pharaonic core&quot; surviving in modern Egypt.

In 1931, following a visit to Egypt, Syrian Arab nationalist Sati&#x27; al-Husri remarked that:
 The later 1930s would become a formative period for Arab nationalism in Egypt, in large part due to efforts by Syrian/Palestinian/Lebanese intellectuals. Nevertheless, a year after the establishment of the League of Arab States in 1945, to be headquartered in Cairo, Oxford University historian H. S. Deighton was still writing:

One of the most prominent Egyptian nationalists and critics of pan-Arabism was Egypt&#x27;s most notable writer of the 20th century, Taha Hussein. He expressed his disagreement with Arab unity and his beliefs in Egyptian nationalism on multiple occasions. In one of his most well known articles, written in 1933 in the magazine &quot;Kawkab el Sharq&quot;, he wrote saying:

It has been argued that until the 1940s, Egypt was more in favour of territorial, Egyptian nationalism and distant from the pan-Arab ideology. Egyptians generally did not identify themselves as Arabs, and it is revealing that when the Egyptian nationalist leader Saad Zaghlul met the Arab delegates at Versailles in 1918, he insisted that their struggles for statehood were not connected, claiming that the problem of Egypt was an Egyptian problem and not an Arab one.

In February 1924 Zaghloul, now prime minister of Egypt, had all of the treasures found in the tomb of King Tutankhamun seized from the British archaeological team led by Howard Carter under the grounds that the treasures belonged to Egypt and to prevent Carter from taking them to Britain as he wanted. Zaghloul justified the seizure under the grounds that &quot;it is the duty of the government to defend the rights and dignity of the nation&quot;. On 6 March 1924, Zaghlul formally opened the tomb of King Tutankhamun to the Egyptian public in an elaborate ceremony held at night with the sky lit up by floodlights, which reportedly attracted the largest crowd ever seen in Luxor. The opening of Tutankhamun tomb was turned into a nationalist demonstration when the British High Commissioner, Field Marshal Allenby arrived, and was loudly booed by the crowd, who started to demand immediate British evacuation of Egypt. The long dead Tutankhamun was turned by the Wafd Party into a symbol of Egyptian nationalism, which was why Carter&#x27;s plans to take the treasures from his tomb aroused such opposition in Egypt. However, the case of Tutankhamun&#x27;s treasures were merely an opportunistic move by Zaghlul at asserting Egyptian independence, which had only been gained in February 1922, against Carter and his team, who were viewed as acting arrogantly towards the Egyptians.

Ahmed Hussein who founded the nationalistic and fascistic Young Egypt Society in 1933 stated that he became interested in Egyptian nationalism after a scouting trip through the Valley of the Kings in 1928, which inspired him with the belief that if Egypt was great once, then it could be great again. The Young Egypt Society glorified the ancient Egyptian past, which was regularly mentioned in party rallies, and in reference to Egypt&#x27;s Turco-Circassian aristocracy demanded that Egypt have &quot;a leader of action, who is not of Turkish or Circassian blood, but of Pharanoic blood&quot;. Initially, the Young Egypt Society had very particularist interpretation of Egyptian nationalism, which emphasized that Egypt was not just another Muslim and/or Arab nation, but rather having a very distinctive identity owing to the heritage of ancient Egypt. The Young Egypt Society, which was closely modeled along the lines of the fascist movements of Italy and Germany, called for a British withdrawal from Egypt, the union of Egypt and the Sudan, and for Egypt under the banner of Arab nationalism to create an empire stretching from the Atlantic to the Indian oceans. The invocation of the glories of ancient Egypt by the Young Egypt Society was used to explain why the Egyptians were to dominate the proposed pan-Arab state. However, Hussein discovered that Pharaonism appealed only to middle class Egyptians, and limited his party&#x27;s appeal to the Egyptian masses. Starting in 1940, the Young Egypt Society abandoned Pharaonism and sought to reinvent itself as an Islamic fundamentalist party.

&quot;Pharaonism&quot; was condemned by Hassan al-Banna, the founder and Supreme Guide of the fundamentalist Muslim Brotherhood, as glorifying a period of &quot;jahiliyyah&quot;, which is the Islamic term for the pre-Islamic past. In a 1937 article, Banna attacked Pharaonism for glorifying the &quot;pagan reactionary Pharaohs&quot; like Akhenaten, Ramesses the Great and Tutankhamun instead of Muhammad and his companions and for seeking to &quot;annihilate&quot; Egypt&#x27;s Muslim identity. Banna insisted that Egypt could only be part of the wider Islamic &quot;ummah&quot; (&quot;community&quot;) and that any effort to mark Egyptian distinctiveness from the rest of Islamic world was going against the will of Allah.

==Arab identity==
However, Egypt under King Farouk was a founding member of the Arab League in 1945, and the first Arab state to declare war in support of the Palestinians in the Palestine War of 1948. This Arab nationalist sentiment increased exponentially after the Egyptian Revolution of 1952. The primary leaders of the Revolution, Muhammad Naguib, and Gamal Abdel Nasser, were staunch Arab nationalists who stressed that pride in Egypt&#x27;s individual indigenous identity was entirely consistent with pride in an overarching Arab cultural identity. It was during Naguib&#x27;s tenure as leader that Egypt adopted the Arab Liberation Flag to symbolize the country&#x27;s links to the rest of the Arab World.

For a while Egypt and Syria formed the United Arab Republic. When the union was dissolved, Egypt continued to be known as the UAR until 1971, when Egypt adopted the current official name, the Arab Republic of Egypt. The Egyptians&#x27; attachment to Arabism, however, was particularly questioned after the 1967 Six-Day War. Thousands of Egyptians had lost their lives and the country became disillusioned with Pan-Arab politics. Nasser&#x27;s successor Anwar Al Sadat, both through public policy and his peace initiative with Israel, revived an uncontested Egyptian orientation, unequivocally asserting that only Egypt and Egyptians were his responsibility. The terms &quot;Arab,&quot; &quot;Arabism,&quot; and &quot;Arab unity,&quot; save for the new official name, became conspicuously absent. (See also Liberal age and Republic sections.) Sadat only engaged in Pharaonism for international consumption, such as when he arranged for the mummy of King Ramses the Great to go to Paris for restoration work in 1974; he insisted the French provide an honor guard at Charles de Gaulle airport to fire a 21 gun salute as befitting a head of state when the coffin containing King Ramses&#x27; corpse touched French soil. Domestically, Pharaonism was discouraged under Sadat, who closed the mummy room in the Egyptian Museum for offending Muslim sensibilities, though in private Sadat was said to remark that &quot;Egyptian kings are not be made a spectacle of&quot; suggesting a degree of respect for the ancient past.

Although the overwhelming majority of Egyptians today continue to self-identify as Arabs in a linguistic sense, a growing minority reject this, pointing to the failures of Arab and pan-Arab nationalist policies, and even publicly voicing objection to the present official name of the country.

In late 2007, &quot;el-Masri el-Yom&quot; daily newspaper conducted an interview at a bus stop in the working-class district of Imbaba to ask citizens what Arab nationalism (&quot;el-qawmeyya el-&#x27;arabeyya&quot;) represented for them. One Egyptian Muslim youth responded, &quot;Arab nationalism means that the Egyptian Foreign Minister in Jerusalem gets humiliated by the Palestinians, that Arab leaders dance upon hearing of Sadat&#x27;s death, that Egyptians get humiliated in Eastern Arabia, and of course that Arab countries get to fight Israel until the last Egyptian soldier.&quot; Another felt that &quot;Arab countries hate Egyptians&quot;, and that unity with Israel may even be more of a possibility than Arab nationalism, because he believes that Israelis would at least respect Egyptians.

Some contemporary prominent Egyptians who oppose Arab nationalism or the idea that Egyptians are Arabs include Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Antiquities Zahi Hawass, popular writer Osama Anwar Okasha, Egyptian-born Harvard University Professor Leila Ahmed, Member of Parliament Suzie Greiss, in addition to different local groups and intellectuals. This understanding is also expressed in other contexts, such as Neil DeRosa&#x27;s novel &quot;Joseph&#x27;s Seed&quot; in his depiction of an Egyptian character &quot;who declares that Egyptians are not Arabs and never will be.&quot;

==Critics of Arab nationalism==
Egyptian critics of Arab nationalism contend that it has worked to erode and/or relegate native Egyptian identity by superimposing only one aspect of Egypt&#x27;s culture. These views and sources for collective identification in the Egyptian state are captured in the words of a linguistic anthropologist who conducted fieldwork in Cairo:

==Copts==

Many Coptic intellectuals hold to a version of Pharaonism which states that Coptic culture is largely derived from pre-Christian, Ancient Egyptian culture. It gives the Copts a claim to a deep heritage in Egyptian history and culture. However, some Western scholars today see Pharaonism as a late development, arguing that it was shaped primarily by Orientalism, and they doubt its validity.

==The problems of Pharaonism as an integrating ideology==

The Canadian archaeologist Michael Wood argued that one of the principal problems of Pharaonism as an integrating ideology for the population is that it glorifies a period in time too remote for most Egyptians, and moreover, one that lacks visible signs of continuity for the Arabic speaking Muslim majority, such as a common language, culture, or alphabet. Wood noted that the popular belief that ancient Egypt was a &quot;slave state&quot; has been questioned by archaeologists and historians, but this popular image held in both the Islamic and the Western nations of a &quot;slave state&quot; makes identification with this period problematic. The story told in the Book of Exodus of an unnamed Pharaoh whose cruelty led him to enslave the Israelites and whose hubris caused his death when he unwisely attempted to follow Moses across the parting of the Red Sea has led to the Pharaohs being portrayed across the ages as a symbol of tyranny. When President Sadat was assassinated on 6 October 1981 reviewing a military parade in Cairo, his Muslim fundamentalist assassins were heard to shout: &quot;We have killed the Pharaoh!&quot; In Arabic, the verb &quot;tafarana,&quot; meaning to act tyrannically, literally translates as &quot;acting Pharaohically&quot;.

Wood wrote that even the surviving ruins of ancient Egypt, consisting mostly of &quot;tombs, palaces and temples, the relics of a death-obsessed, aristocratic, pagan society,&quot; seem to confirm the popular image of a &quot;slave state,&quot; while the &quot;more sophisticated models of Egyptian history, developed mainly by foreign scholars, remain ignored&quot;. The ruins of ancient Egypt, with their pompous and grandiose bragging about the greatness of the god-kings who had them built, give the impression of a society slavishly devoted to serving the kings who proclaimed themselves to be living gods. Wood wrote that it is not certain if this was indeed the case, as Egyptologists know very little about the feelings and thoughts of ordinary people in ancient Egypt, but it is clear that ancient Egypt was a &quot;highly stratified society&quot;, which makes it difficult for people today to identify with a society whose values were so different from the present.

One of the principal reasons why Pharaonism went into decline starting in the 1940s was because the Quran condemns ancient Egypt so strongly, making it very difficult for Egyptian Muslims to use the symbols of ancient Egypt without causing accusations of abandoning their faith Wood wrote that a principal difference between Egypt and Mexico is that Mexicans can and do incorporate elements from Mesoamerican civilizations like the Olmecs, the Maya, and the Mexica (Aztecs), which are seen as part of a national continuity interrupted by the Spanish conquest of 1519–1521 and resumed with independence in 1821, whereas it is impossible for Egyptians to use pharaonic symbols &quot;without being left open to the charges that such symbols were non-Islamic or anti-Islamic&quot;. Wood wrote: &quot;Islam and the Egypt of the Pharaohs could be reconciled only with great difficulty; in the end they could not but compete...Egyptian nationalists who wished to look for their ancient history for inspiration would have to start from scratch and would have to distance themselves from an Islamic identity with which the Pharaonic past could not really coexist with&quot;.

Another problem was posed by the way in which almost all of the archaeological work on ancient Egypt in the 19th century and the first half of the 20th century was done by foreign archaeologists who discouraged Egyptians from studying the period. Western archaeologists tended to see the study of ancient Egypt as having nothing to do with modern Egypt; even the very term Egyptology refers to the study of pre-Roman Egypt, not modern Egypt. In the 19th century, various racial theories were devised to claim that the Egyptians were not the descendants of the ancient Egyptians, or alternatively, the history of ancient Egypt was a cycle of renewal caused by the conquests of racially superior invaders and decline caused by miscegenation with the racially inferior native population. The purpose of such theories was to assert the West was the &quot;true heirs&quot; of ancient Egypt, whose people were viewed as &quot;honorary Westerners&quot; with no connection to modern Egyptians. The effects of such efforts was to persuade many Egyptians that the pharaonic past was indeed not part of their heritage.

Moreover, since the Coptic language is descended from the ancient Egyptian language, starting in the 19th century a number of Copts have identified with Pharaonism as a way of emphasizing that they are &quot;purer&quot; Egyptians than the Muslim majority. For the purpose of building a national identity, an ideology that can be used to privilege a minority as being more authentic Egyptian than the majority presents problems, and generally, efforts to build an Egyptian national identity that embraces both Muslims and Copts have turned to the more recent periods of the past . Wood wrote that for the purposes of building national pride, &quot;the Pharaonic past, for the Egyptian nationalist, was simply the wrong past.&quot;

== 2020s resurgence ==
A resurgence of Pharaonic depictions and discourse has been noted in today&#x27;s Egypt, coming from both the state and the people.

The Egyptian government under president Abdel Fattah el-Sisi has openly embraced the ancient Egyptian aesthetic. In 2020, a 90-ton obelisk depicting the pharaoh Ramses II was erected in Tahrir Square. Throughout 2021, various extravagant parades were organized around the transportation of mummies and other artifacts to the Grand Egyptian Museum. Similar spectacles, including musical performances in the ancient Egyptian language, followed the opening of the Avenue of Sphinxes later that year. The First Lady Entissar Amer declared that she felt proud of &quot;belonging to an ancient civilization&quot;.

In 2023, there was mass public anger in Egypt over the historically inaccurate depiction of Cleopatra as a black African in the Netflix docudrama series &quot;African Queens&quot;. The actress in question, Adele James, received a wave of abusive comments from Egyptians over social media. The backlash was represented through the use of the hashtag #&quot;مصر_للمصريين&quot; (Egypt for the Egyptians). Young Egyptians shared photos online depicting their own faces juxtaposed against those of kings, queens or everyday figures from ancient Egypt, intending to show the physical similarities between modern Egyptians and their ancient counterparts, asserting a national continuity.

The Egyptian government also commented on the controversy, with the Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities stating that the series represented a &quot;falsification of Egyptian history.&quot; The Secretary General of the Supreme Council of Archeology through the Egyptian Ministry of Tourism and Antiquities released a statement on the issue, claiming that Queen Cleopatra was &quot;light-skinned and (had) Hellenic features.&quot;

<doc id="363125" wikidata="Q301773" url="?curid=363125" title="Aaron Burr Sr.">
<text>Aaron Burr Sr. (January 4, 1716 – September 24, 1757) was a Presbyterian minister and college educator in colonial America. He was a founder of the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) and the father of Aaron Burr (1756–1836), the third vice president of the United States.

==Early years==
A native of Connecticut, Burr was born in 1716 in present-day Fairfield to Daniel Burr (1660–1727) and Elizabeth Burr, nee Pinckney (1675–1722), daughter of captain Philip Pinckney (1618–1689). His father was a wealthy farmer. He was of English ancestry (his grandfather Jehu Burr had been born in Lavenham, Suffolk, England, in 1625, settled in the Connecticut Colony as a young man, and died there in 1692).

Aaron Burr attended Yale College (now Yale University), where he obtained a B.A. in 1735. After graduation, he studied theology in New Haven and witnessed the First Great Awakening, a significant religious and spiritual movement of the 1730s and 1740s. He was personally acquainted with Jonathan Edwards and his wife Sarah, daughter of James Pierpont, who is credited with founding Yale. Edwards, a leader of the Great Awakening, was Burr&#x27;s mentor and would later become his father-in-law.

==Career==
On December 21, 1736, Burr became a minister of the Presbyterian Church of Newark, Newark, New Jersey. He also taught Greek and Latin to youth, and co-authored &quot;Introduction to the Latin Tongue&quot;. After a few years, Burr rose to prominence in the Presbyterian circles of upper New Jersey and the New York City area.

===College founder===
Between 1741 and 1758, a controversy over unorthodox piety fostered by the Great Awakening and how it affected traditional authority of church officers led to internal differences in the Presbyterian and Congregational churches. Presbyterians became divided between the so-called conservative &quot;Old Side&quot; and dissenting, pro-Awakening &quot;New Side&quot; congregationalists—between Old and New Lights. The rift affected the faculty and student body at Yale that was at the time an incubator for both Presbyterian and Congregational clergy. In opposition to Thomas Clap, Yale&#x27;s first president, Jonathan Edwards, Burr, and Jonathan Dickinson, all being on the pro-Awakening side, founded the College of New Jersey (now Princeton University) at Elizabeth, New Jersey, in 1746.

Dickinson was elected first president of the College, but died soon after in 1747. Burr, who taught at the College, then became the second president on November 9, 1748 after approval of the college charter by the New Jersey governor, Jonathan Belcher. During his tenure (1748–1757), the curriculum was settled, the student body increased from 8 in 1747 to 40–50 in 1751, and the first commencement was held. Among the first graduates was Richard Stockton, a signer of the Declaration of Independence; five others became Presbyterian ministers. Burr moved the College to its permanent home at Princeton, New Jersey, where he supervised the construction of Nassau Hall, Princeton&#x27;s best-known structure and the largest building in colonial New Jersey when it was completed in 1756. In 1755, Burr was relieved of his pastoral duties in order to concentrate full-time on his work at Princeton. At age 32, he became the youngest person ever to serve as president of Princeton.

In September 1756, when the French and Indian War was underway, Burr wrote a sermon in which he sought to defend the &quot;Priviledges [sic] of unadulterated Christianity; British Liberty and Property, in a delightful and fruitful Country&quot; foretelling future fusion of secular and religious rhetoric in the Revolutionary era.

==Personal life==
On June 29, 1752, Burr married Jonathan and Sarah Edwards&#x27; daughter Esther (1732–1758). Together, they had two children:
*Sarah &quot;Sally&quot; Burr (1754–1797), who married Tapping Reeve (1744–1823)
*Aaron Burr Jr. (1756–1836), who in 1782 married Theodosia Bartow Prevost (1746–1794), widow of an officer of the British army, Jacques Marcus Prevost (1736–1781), who was a younger brother of general Augustine Prevost (1723–1786). After her death in 1794, he married Eliza Jumel (1775–1865) in 1833.

===Death===
In the fall of 1757, Burr died in his first year in Princeton (tenth year of being the president) of fever after traveling to Massachusetts to Governor Belcher&#x27;s funeral where he delivered a sermon. It was believed that his premature death had been brought on or aggravated by overwork. His remains were interred in the President&#x27;s Lot at Princeton Cemetery. His widow died seven months later, orphaning their three-year-old daughter and two-year-old son.

===Descendants===
His grandchildren include Aaron Burr Reeve (1780–1809), who died shortly after the birth of his only child, Tapping Burr Reeve (1809–1829), and Theodosia Burr (1783–1813). Theodosia was married to Joseph Alston (1779–1816), who served as the 44th Governor of South Carolina from 1812 to 1814.

== Brothers and sisters ==
Aaron Burr Sr. had many siblings from his father&#x27;s three marriages:

* Hannah Burr (b. 1681)
* Jehu Burr (1687–1757), was twice married, among his sons was Jehu Burr Jr. (1734–1808).
* Mary Burr (1689–1763), married David Meeker (1687–1754).
* Elizabeth Burr (1696–1760), married Nathaniel Hull (1695–1749).
* Stephen Burr (1697–1778)
* Peter Burr (1699–1777)
* Jane Burr (1701–1779), married Samuel Sherwood (1699–1768).
* Esther Burr (1703–1741), married Daniel Bradley (1704–1765).

<doc id="363127" wikidata="Q2106454" url="?curid=363127" title="First Battle of Winchester">
<text>The First Battle of Winchester, fought on May 25, 1862, in and around Frederick County, Virginia, and Winchester, Virginia, was a major victory in Confederate Army Maj. Gen. Thomas J. &quot;Stonewall&quot; Jackson&#x27;s Campaign through the Shenandoah Valley during the American Civil War. Jackson enveloped the right flank of the Union Army under Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks and pursued it as it fled across the Potomac River into Maryland. Jackson&#x27;s success in achieving force concentration early in the fighting allowed him to secure a more decisive victory which had escaped him in previous battles of the campaign.

==Background==

Maj. Gen. Nathaniel P. Banks learned on May 24, 1862, that the Confederates had captured his garrison at Front Royal, Virginia, and were closing on Winchester, turning his position. He ordered a hasty retreat down the Valley Pike from Strasburg. His columns were attacked at Middletown and again at Newtown (Stephens City) by Jackson&#x27;s converging forces. The Confederates took many Union prisoners and captured so many wagons and stores that they later nicknamed the Union general &quot;Commissary Banks&quot;. Jackson pressed the pursuit for most of the night and allowed his exhausted soldiers only a few hours of sleep before dawn.

Banks now deployed at Winchester to slow the Confederate pursuit. He had two brigades of infantry under Colonels Dudley Donnelly and George Henry Gordon, a mixed brigade of cavalry under Brig. Gen. John P. Hatch, and 16 guns. Gordon&#x27;s brigade was placed on the Union right on Bower&#x27;s Hill with its left flank at the Valley Pike, supported by a battery of artillery. The center of the line (Camp Hill) was held by the cavalry supported by two guns. Donnelly&#x27;s brigade was placed in a crescent on the left to cover the Front Royal and Millwood roads with the rest of the artillery. At earliest light the Confederate skirmish line advanced in force driving the Union pickets back to their main line of battle.

==Opposing forces==
===Union===
===Confederate===
==Battle==

During the night, the advance of Maj. Gen. Richard S. Ewell&#x27;s division (four brigades) reached Buffalo Lick. Jackson moved three of Ewell&#x27;s brigades to the left to participate in the advance on the Valley pike, leaving Ewell with just Trimble&#x27;s brigade and Bradley Johnson&#x27;s Maryland regiment. At dawn, he deployed Trimble&#x27;s brigade astride the Front Royal Pike and advanced against the Union left flank. His leading regiments (in particular the 21st North Carolina) came under heavy fire from Union forces deployed behind stone fences and were repulsed. Confederate forces regrouped and brought up artillery. Ewell advanced the regiments of Trimble&#x27;s brigade, sending regiments to either side of the high ground to enfilade the Union position. Donnelly withdrew his brigade to a position closer to town with his right flank anchored on Camp Hill. Ewell then attempted a flanking movement to the right beyond the Millwood Road, but in response to orders from Banks, Donnelly withdrew through the town.

In conjunction with Ewell&#x27;s advance on the Front Royal Pike, Jackson advanced on the Valley Pike at early dawn in a heavy fog. At Jackson&#x27;s command, Winder&#x27;s brigade swept over a hill to the left of the pike, driving off the Union skirmishers who held it. Jackson quickly placed a section of artillery on the hill to engage Union artillery on Bower&#x27;s Hill at a range of less than half a mile. Union sharpshooters along Abrams Creek began picking off the cannoneers. Jackson brought up the rest of his artillery and a duel ensued with the Union guns on Bower&#x27;s Hill.

Jackson then brought up the brigades of Fulkerson, Campbell, and Elzey to support Winder. Despite numerous officers being wounded, Jackson&#x27;s forces were in good order and nearly ready for an attack. He then deployed Brig. Gen. Richard Taylor&#x27;s Louisiana brigade (led by the Louisiana Tigers) reinforced by two regiments of Fulkerson&#x27;s brigade and backed up by Scott&#x27;s brigade, to the left along Abrams Creek. Taylor marched under fire to a position overlapping the Union right and then attacked Bower&#x27;s Hill. The Confederate assault swept irresistibly forward over the crest in the face of determined resistance. With three enemy brigades in its front and three coming at its right flank, Gordon&#x27;s Union brigade gave way and Union soldiers began streaming back into town.

Union forces retreated through the streets of Winchester and north on the Valley Pike to Martinsburg. After resting in Martinsburg, Banks&#x27; command continued north to the Potomac River, crossing it at Williamsport. Confederate pursuit was lethargic, as the troops were exhausted from the non-stop marching of the previous week under Jackson&#x27;s command. Nevertheless, many Union prisoners fell into Confederate hands. Brig. Gen. Turner Ashby&#x27;s cavalry was disorganized from the actions of May 24 and did not pursue until Banks had already reached the Potomac.

==Aftermath==
First Winchester was a major victory in Jackson&#x27;s Valley Campaign, both tactically and strategically. Union plans for the Peninsula Campaign, an offensive against Richmond, were disrupted by Jackson&#x27;s audacity, and thousands of Union reinforcements were diverted to the Valley and the defense of Washington, D.C.
