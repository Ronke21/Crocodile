<text>The Don Valley Parkway (DVP) is a municipal expressway in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, which connects the Gardiner Expressway in downtown Toronto with Highway 401. North of Highway 401, it continues as Highway 404. The parkway runs through the parklands of the Don River valley, after which it is named. It has a maximum speed limit of for its entire length of . It is six lanes for most of its length, with eight lanes north of York Mills Road and four lanes south of Eastern Avenue. As a municipal road, it is patrolled by the Toronto Police Service.

The parkway was the second expressway to be built by Metropolitan Toronto (Metro) after the Gardiner Expressway. Planning began in 1954, the year of Metro&#x27;s formation. The first section opened during 1961 and the entire route was completed to Sheppard Avenue by the end of 1966. South of Bloor Street, the parkway was constructed over existing roadways. North of Bloor Street, it was built on a new alignment through the valley, requiring the removal of several hills, diversion of the Don River and the clearing of woodland. North of Eglinton Avenue, the parkway follows the former Woodbine Avenue right-of-way north to Highway 401. A proposed extension to Steeles Avenue was instead taken over by the province and built as Highway 404, which also absorbed the Metro-built segment between Sheppard and Highway 401. The parkway was planned to be one of several municipal and provincial north–south expressways into downtown Toronto. The others, the Spadina Expressway (Allen Road) and a proposed southern extension of Highway 400 were truncated due to public opposition, leaving the parkway as the sole north–south expressway connecting downtown to the northern areas of Metro; the only other complete north-south freeway connecting to the Gardiner Expressway is Highway 427 at Toronto&#x27;s west end.

Traffic conditions on the parkway often exceed its intended capacity of 60,000 vehicles per day. Today, some sections carry an average of 100,000 vehicles a day and have bumper-to-bumper traffic conditions during commuting hours. The parkway is also used by regional transit buses which can access designated lanes to pass slow-moving traffic. Locals refer to the parkway as the &quot;Don Valley Parking Lot&quot; due to slow-moving, congested traffic.

In November 2023, the municipal and provincial governments announced a tentative deal which will see responsibility for the Don Valley Parkway and the Gardiner Expressway transferred to the province and both maintained as provincial highways.

== Route description ==

The Don Valley Parkway begins at an interchange with the Gardiner Expressway near the mouth of the Don River in downtown Toronto. From there, the parkway runs northwards on the eastern bank of the valley, between the river and the developed city to the east. Beyond the southern, older section of the city, the valley widens and the parkway continues northwards through the parklands along the river to Don Mills Road. The route leaves the valley, rises to meet Eglinton Avenue, descends into the valley again and goes through the park lands of Milne Hollow to Lawrence Avenue. The parkway ascends to meet York Mills Road and ends at Highway 401, with the physical road continuing as Highway 404.

=== South of the Forks ===

At its southern end near the mouth of the Don River, the parkway begins in a multiple-level interchange with the ground-level Lake Shore Boulevard and the elevated Gardiner Expressway directly above the boulevard. The Gardiner–Don Valley ramps provide access to the section of the Gardiner Expressway west of the parkway. There is no access either from or to the Gardiner east of the parkway (before the Gardiner&#x27;s east end realignment that commenced in 2021, the Gardiner ended shortly after crossing the Don River as it descended and merged into Lake Shore Boulevard via the Logan Avenue ramp from 2002-2021, prior to that the elevated Gardiner extended to Leslie Street from 1966-2001 where it was known as Gardiner East). To travel east from the southbound lanes of the parkway, motorists must exit via an off-ramp that meets the Lake Shore Boulevard at a signalized intersection.

Less than north of the Gardiner, the Canadian National Railway (CNR)/GO Toronto railway viaduct passes over the parkway. The interchange is constrained by that distance for the Gardiner—Don Valley two-lane ramps bridge the difference in height from ground-level under the viaduct with the height of the Gardiner. Acceleration and deceleration lanes for the Lake Shore—Don Valley ramps connect under the viaduct.
From the viaduct, the parkway proceeds north as a four-lane freeway on a straight course along the east bank of the channelized Don River, passing beneath the Eastern Avenue Bypass viaduct and veering slightly to the east as it passes below Queen Street East.
On- and off-ramps project northward from the Eastern Avenue viaduct, each adding a lane to both carriageways. The expressway continues northward, with the Don River sandwiched between the highway and Bayview Avenue. The Parkway passes beneath Dundas and Gerrard Streets and rises onto the &#x27;Don Flats&#x27; plateau at Riverdale Park. In this section, the elevation of the highway is close to the level of the river and is liable to flood after heavy rains, as occurred in June 2010, for example.

North from Riverdale Park, the valley widens considerably. The expressway rises from the floor of the valley and passes beneath the towering Prince Edward Viaduct bridge, which connects Bloor Street with Danforth Avenue and carries a subway line.
The highway runs along the eastern wall of the valley for the next several kilometres, rising and dipping repeatedly.

The expressway curves eastward into a cut in the hillside as it passes the &#x27;Half-mile&#x27; railway bridge. Immediately to the north, it meets the Bayview Avenue–Bloor Street connector at a trumpet interchange. The long off-ramp to these roads was the original southern terminus of the parkway in 1961.
The off-ramp was later proposed as the eastern terminus of the proposed Crosstown Expressway. This expressway, opposed by the City of Toronto, was never built:
it was intended for construction only after the completion of the Spadina Expressway, which itself was cancelled in 1971.

Just north of the Bayview–Bloor interchange, the expressway passes over Pottery Road. To the east is Todmorden Mills, a collection of historic buildings and a former industrial site, the original &quot;Don Mills&quot;. The nearby pond was a section of the Don River cut off by the parkway construction. Further north, to the west where the highway crosses Beechwood Avenue, is Crothers Woods, a restoration site.

The expressway continues east along the southern edge of the valley. The opposing lanes split as the expressway passes beneath the Leaside Bridge, the southbound lanes at a lower level. The lanes rejoin as they approach the Don Mills Road interchange at the &quot;forks of the Don&quot;. Just east of the Don Mills Road interchange, several large white sculptures resembling human teeth are installed on both sides of the road. The sculptures, called &quot;The Elevated Wetlands&quot;, are examples of &quot;eco-art&quot; and have become a landmark. The sculptures resemble concrete but are made of plastic and filled with waste plastic and wetland plants. The sculptures function as a water filter, removing pollutants from the Don River. A solar-powered pump lifts water to the top of the sculpture and it is returned to the Don after filtration. The sculptures were installed in 1998 and the wetland plants added in 1999.

=== North to Highway 401 ===

The expressway crosses Taylor-Massey Creek and the East Don River, and climbs out of the valley, swinging northwards toward Eglinton Avenue. In this section, the DVP passes around the apartment buildings of Flemingdon Park. The lanes split again before the underpass at Spanbridge Road, the road that connects a three-tower complex of apartments to the east of the parkway with Flemingdon Park to the west. The lanes pass beneath the Gatineau Hydro Corridor and reconnect south of the Eglinton interchange.

As it crosses Eglinton, the expressway passes a business park to the west and the Concorde Place commercial and condominium development to the east. The expressway begins to descend back into the East Don Valley. It passes beneath Wynford Drive and two railways (the CPR Midtown line and the CNR/Richmond Hill GO line) before reaching Lawrence Avenue East, one of the few remaining cloverleaf interchanges in Ontario. This area, known as Milne Hollow, is partially forested, some of the land being conservation reserve.

Passing beneath Lawrence Avenue and back over the East Don River, the expressway begins climbing out of the valley once more. Residential sub-divisions are present along both sides of the road, isolated from the expressway by noise barriers, from north of Lawrence to Highway 401. It reaches the top of the valley and curves along a plateau before rising and passing over York Mills Road and Underpass Gate, right after the latter provincial control of the road begins. At a large interchange with Highway 401 (built and maintained by the province) the northbound lanes splits into two branches: two left lanes continuing north as Highway 404, and the three others exit to Highway 401 westbound and eastbound. 

North of the interchange with Highway 401, a former segment of the parkway continues to an interchange with Sheppard Avenue (both that section and the Sheppard overpass were built by Metro), which has since been incorporated as part of Highway 404 in 1977 and has been widened in the early 2000s with a short collector-express system. 

=== Traffic cameras ===
The entire length of the parkway uses the RESCU Traffic Management System, which was installed in 1994.
Like the similar COMPASS system on provincial freeways, RESCU combines in-pavement sensors with traffic cameras and changeable message signs (6 fixed and 10 portable) to alert drivers of accidents, traffic conditions and upcoming closures. The system is used as a means of managing traffic flow along the parkway. The message signs also frequently display non-urgent messages to motorists, such as notices for future construction, safety messages and smog alerts.

The RESCU Traffic Cameras are located at regular intervals along the parkway. The cameras, which are operated by the City of Toronto, can be viewed on television and online. The cameras are located on poles and are fixed in direction. There are 16 camera locations on the parkway. Most have one camera for northbound and one for southbound traffic. RESCU operators monitor the cameras for emergency purposes; local radio and television media use the service for traffic reports.
=== Traffic congestion ===

The Don Valley Parkway, along with the Gardiner Expressway, is one of Toronto&#x27;s busiest municipal routes. It is the sole north–south expressway into Toronto&#x27;s downtown, a role it was not designed to support. The parkway was planned as one of a series of expressways to provide commuter routes to downtown from the expanding suburbs. Two other un-built expressways were planned: the Scarborough Expressway, expected to handle traffic between downtown and the eastern suburbs, and the Spadina Expressway, expected to serve traffic from the north-west.
By the early 1980s, traffic volumes on the parkway exceeded capacity, and today, the parkway has significant traffic congestion on most days. During the morning commute, commuters fill the southbound lanes as far south as Bloor Street. In the afternoon/evening commute, commuters fill the northbound lanes from Bloor Street, and often the full length of the highway in event of a collision or other hazard. The daily congestion has earned the highway the quasi-affectionate nickname of the &quot;Don Valley Parking Lot&quot;.

The section immediately south of Highway 401 is often congested at all hours. Traffic studies have attributed congestion in the southbound lanes to the number of lanes merging from Highways 401 and 404 into the parkway and the lane changing that results from merging traffic from Highway 401 clashing with exiting traffic to the nearby York Mills exit. Congestion in the northbound lanes is attributed to truck traffic coping with the steep grade of the valley, lane changing, and insufficient advanced signage for Highway 401. Most traffic in this section travels north on Highway 404, but only two of the five lanes lead to it.

== History ==
The construction of the Don Valley Parkway was a major undertaking that changed much of the Don valley. While industrial areas existed both near the mouth of the Don River and the area of today&#x27;s Leaside Bridge, several natural areas remained in those places where the steep sides of the valley had dissuaded large-scale urban development. The post-war growth period of Toronto provided an impetus to build a new automobile route into central Toronto, and the route through the valley was chosen to avoid expropriation of existing development and provide access for new development in the Metropolitan Toronto region. The construction of the six-lane highway modified the valley through the removal of hills, other earth works and the rerouting of the Don River. Since completion, the parkway has not been changed significantly, other than adding one partial interchange at Wynford Drive and updating its infrastructure to current standards.

=== Conditions before construction ===
The Don River valley, formed during the last ice age, has played an important role in the development of Toronto from its beginning as the Town of York. Using the power of the river, the first sawmill was erected at today&#x27;s Todmorden Mills by 1795 and other industry was founded soon after, including a grist mill, paper mill and brewery (Helliwell or Don Brewery) by 1828. Railways were introduced into the valley after 1850 with the building of tracks into Toronto (Ontario, Simcoe and Huron Union Railroad had trackage at mouth of the Don after 1850 and Canadian Pacific Railway Toronto branch along the lower river after 1880s). By 1900, the Don River south of today&#x27;s Bloor Street was straightened into a channel for boating purposes, with roadways and industry built on both banks.
North of Bloor Street, the wide valley floor became dominated by industrial concerns of the Taylor family, including the Don Valley Brick Works. The area from the Forks of the Don and north along the river valleys had been lumbered and farmed, such as at Milne Hollow, but several natural areas remained by the 1950s. The forests of the Don valley had been where Canadian naturalist Ernest Thompson Seton spent much of his youth in the 1870s studying animal life.

The Don Valley Parkway was not the first highway planned through the valley. In the 1930s, a &quot;speedway&quot; through the lower valley was promoted as possible depression relief. Unlike today&#x27;s parkway, this road would have curved northwest near the Don Valley Brick Works and connected to Mount Pleasant at Davisville. The city did not have the money and appealed to &#x27;civic-minded citizens&#x27; to donate the land on which the highway would be built. None came forward. In 1939, city transportation planner Norman Wilson proposed a boulevard that would follow the valley into the northeast. On January 1, 1946, Toronto voters approved the building of a &#x27;Don Valley Traffic Artery&#x27; following the same route as the &quot;speedway&quot; by a vote of 31,882 to 12,328. This was the same plebiscite where Toronto voters approved the construction of the Yonge segment of Line 1. The City then borrowed $1.5 million to finance the project. In 1949, the Official Plan of the City of Toronto updated the Don Valley Roadway plan to include two branches—one to the north-west which would eventually become the Crosstown Expressway proposal, and one to the north-east leading to O&#x27;Connor Drive. The original plan to connect to St. Clair remained. East York Township opposed construction of the north-east roadway. The City started the first section of this route from Eastern Avenue south to Keating Street in 1949, but had to suspend work in 1951 due to a lack of steel.

Recognizing the value of the natural spaces of the valley, conservationists such as Charles Sauriol founded the Don Valley Conservation Association, in 1948 to assist the provincial Don Valley Conservation Authority (DVCA) itself founded in 1946. The Association promoted conservation of the valley with rail tours and public events. In 1951, the Ontario Department of Planning and Development released its &quot;Don Valley Conservation Report&quot;, which recommended the preservation of the valley, including an artificial reservoir where Lawrence Avenue crossed the Don River. It also proposed that the valley not be used for any new major transportation routes. The DVCA adopted the report and budgeted to buy lands in the valley, but the City of Toronto withheld funding to the DVCA for land purchases.
In April 1953, the Metropolitan Toronto (Metro) federation was approved and Fred Gardiner was named as its first chairman. Its mission from the start was to build the infrastructure needed to support the rapidly growing suburbs, whose governments could not afford the projects and often disagreed on joint projects. One of its first priorities was to build the Lakeshore Expressway, and its second road priority was an expressway through the Don River valley. Gardiner was a major proponent of building a highway through the valley, since his days in the 1940s with the Toronto and York Planning Board. At the time, engineers felt that building a six-lane roadway was unfeasible due to the two large hills and a narrow valley. Gardiner and T&amp;Y Board (and later Metro Planning Board) chairman James Maher personally walked the route through the valley, determining the works that would be needed to put the highway through. &quot;We&#x27;ll move the railway over a piece. We&#x27;ll tear down the hill. We&#x27;ll shift the river over a piece, then we can have the highway through there.&quot; Gardiner toured New York City in June 1954 to study the city&#x27;s expressways and municipal parking lots. Gardiner compared the proposed Don Valley expressway to the scenic Grand Central Parkway, and was quoted as claiming that valleys like the Don are not spoiled by arterial highways, but beautified by them. The first Metro staff survey and feasibility study of the parkway&#x27;s route was approved in late 1953, before the Metro government itself came into being in 1954.

In October 1954, flooding caused by Hurricane Hazel caused the destruction of bridges and buildings in the valley. As a consequence of the destruction on the Don and other rivers, the provincial government of Ontario banned development on river floodplains. In 1957, the Metropolitan Toronto and Region Conservation Authority (MTRCA) was formed, merging all conservation authorities responsible for Toronto watersheds (including the DVCA), with greater powers to manage valley lands. The MTRCA began expropriating privately owned land in the valley for flood control, often creating or conserving open space uses. Sauriol, who was by then an employee of the MTRCA, was one of the few to speak out against the parkway project. Sauriol&#x27;s cottage at the Forks of the Don would be expropriated by Metro Toronto for the parkway, although much of his land is now part of the Charles Sauriol Conservation Reserve, which extends from the Forks of the Don, along the East Don to Milne Hollow at Lawrence Avenue, visible from the parkway. By contrast, Metro chairman Gardiner had an opposite opinion of the Don Valley and was quoted &quot;I&#x27;ll tell you what the Don Valley was. It was a place to murder little boys, that&#x27;s what it was.&quot;

=== Construction ===

The design of the project was contracted to the engineering consortium of Fenco-Harris, which completed the plans in the fall of 1955. The project included extending Bayview Avenue south along the Lower Don valley, which replaced the &#x27;north&#x27; arm of the previous Don Valley roadway project, and the realignment of Lawrence Avenue over the East Don River. The design for the section north of the Don River mouth incorporated the existing river-side Don Roadway on the east side of the River. The design also incorporated a section of the old Don Mills Road leading up from the River, north of Gerrard, to Broadview Avenue and Danforth Avenue into the highway as a northbound on-ramp from Danforth. The project was designed to carry 60,000 vehicles per day. Fenco-Harris designed the route to be &quot;located on public lands as much as possible, thus minimizing the expropriation of private property. Greenbelt land has been used for right-of-way in preference to acreage which can be commercially developed.&quot; The route required the expropriation of less than 25 properties.

The first planned route of the parkway was to follow the lower Don Valley before turning north and continuing along the Don Mills Road right-of-way north to the Toronto Bypass (today&#x27;s Highway 401). Edward P. Taylor, developer of the Don Mills subdivision, situated at Don Mills Road and Lawrence Avenue, protested the plan heavily and the path was rerouted along the CPR railway from Don Mills Road and Eglinton Avenue north-east to meet the Woodbine Avenue right-of-way at Lawrence Avenue, and proceeded north to the Toronto Bypass. To facilitate the Flemingdon Park development, located south-east of Don Mills Road and Eglinton, the entire planned route south of Lawrence to the present interchange at Don Mills Road was moved east to its current alignment.

The plan, estimated to cost C$28.674 million,
was approved by Metro Council in early 1956.
Formal approval to build came in 1958
and construction of the parkway began. A stumbling block to construction was resolved by a deal between Metro and the City of Toronto over City-owned parklands needed for the parkway. North of Bloor Street, of City-owned land would be transferred to Metro and any lands not needed for the parkway would be developed as parks by Metro. South of Bloor Street, Metro agreed to replace any recreation facilities lost in Riverdale Park due to the parkway construction. The City had threatened to not allow construction through City-owned land.

The first section of the parkway, from Bloor Street to Eglinton Avenue, was opened on August 31, 1961, by Ontario Premier Leslie Frost and Metro chairman Gardiner, who presented Frost with a silver plate.
It opened initially without an interchange at Don Mills Road and had its first traffic jam that day at the Eglinton Avenue exit.
The interchange at Don Mills was approved by Metro council on November 2, 1964.
Building the section within the valley required significant civil engineering, including the rerouting of of the Don River, installation of of reinforced retaining wall
and the removal of two hills. Tumper&#x27;s Hill, located near the Don Mills Road interchange, stood higher than it does today.
Sugar Loaf Hill, shaped like a cone, which stood alone in the shadow of the Prince Edward Viaduct where Bayview Avenue passes today, was removed completely. The of earth was used as fill for the parkway and a total of of earth was excavated and moved.
Besides modification of the natural landscape, the route required relocation and demolition of utilities and residences. Metro relocated of CNR and CPR railway tracks in the section from Bloor Street to Chester Hill Road to make way for the parkway.
The Todmorden sewage treatment plant, built in 1926, was also demolished.
The route required the removal of five homes on Minton Place located above the valley to facilitate the cut of the valley hillside. Four were demolished and one moved to Scarborough.

Construction of the section from Eglinton Avenue to Lawrence Avenue began on July 1, 1961, and it was opened to traffic in the evening of October 30, 1963, without any ceremony. The segment connected to Woodbine Avenue north of Lawrence Avenue, cutting off access to Woodbine from Lawrence Avenue. Northbound parkway traffic could continue north on Woodbine Avenue, then a two-lane road, up to the interchange with Highway 401. The section cost $2.723 million to complete.

The third section to open was from Bloor Street to the Gardiner Expressway. This section involved the removal of CPR rail sidings on the eastern bank of the Don from Eastern Avenue north. Royal Drive, which was a two-way road that connected with Bloor Street between Broadview Avenue and the Viaduct was re-purposed into a one-way north-bound on-ramp. A pedestrian overpass bridge was constructed to connect the east and west sections of Riverdale Park. The section opened in conjunction with the section of the expressway from the parkway to York Street on November 6, 1964. It was opened ceremonially by Ontario Premier John Robarts.

By 1965, concurrent with the expansion of Highway 401 into a twelve lane collector-express system, Woodbine Avenue&#x27;s existing interchange with Highway 401 was being replaced by a new freeway-to-freeway interchange (similar to a Parclo A4 but modified with grade separations for free flow of traffic) for the upcoming extension of the parkway. The final section of the parkway, from Lawrence Avenue to Sheppard Avenue was opened chaotically to traffic in the afternoon on November 17, 1966, but forced drivers to exit onto Highway 401; construction inspectors were not aware that the parkway was scheduled to open until they arrived on site that morning.
The section north of Highway 401 remained unopened until March 1, 1967, due to ongoing construction of the Sheppard Avenue bridge.
The final cost of the project was $40 million ($ in dollars). 

After passing underneath the Sheppard bridge, the parkway temporarily narrowed to the two-lane Woodbine Avenue, although Metro had plans to extend the parkway all the way to Steeles Avenue by removing the remainder of Woodbine Avenue. From Steeles Avenue onward, the Department of Highways (DHO) would continue the parkway as a &quot;new King&#x27;s Highway&quot;. 


=== Since completion ===
In 1965, Metro Toronto Chief Coroner Morton Shulman released a report criticizing the lack of safety in the design of the parkway.
In the first five months of 1965, there were 136 accidents on the parkway, with four deaths and 86 injuries. Among the &quot;death-dealing&quot; deficiencies that had to be corrected were inadequate guardrails, exposed steep slopes and light standards that were exposed to collision from passing high-speed traffic. Call boxes with emergency telephones were installed on the parkway in 1966.
The boxes, attached to street lighting on the right shoulder, provided a direct line for help from the Ontario Motor League, now part of the Canadian Automobile Association (CAA). Today, the RESCU Traffic Management System monitors the highway and can call for emergency help.

On April 18, 1969, the slope behind Davies Crescent (just west of Don Mills Road) gave way after heavy rain, covering the northbound lanes and part of the southbound lanes with up to of mud. There were only minor injuries. The slope, which had had its trees removed for the building of the expressway, was covered with sod and stakes to hold the soil.

When the province decided that the new Highway 404 should start at Highway 401 instead of the Metro boundary, it took control of the existing parkway between Highway 401 and Sheppard Avenue, as well as rebuilding the remainder of Woodbine Avenue within Metro Toronto to a freeway. The Sheppard Avenue interchange with the parkway was originally a Parclo AB2, plus Fairview Mall Drive at the time ran only east-west directly north of the shopping centre and also had its own on/off-ramps from the southbound lanes of Highway 404. In the 1980s the province removed the separate sets of Fairview Mall Drive and Sheppard Avenue ramps in favour of an on/off-ramp that fed directly to the shopping centre and an extension of Fairview Mall Drive whose eastbound lanes run south to meet with Sheppard Avenue.

In the late 1980s, a new partial-access interchange was built at Wynford Drive to provide access between the parkway and the Concorde Place development. The new partial-access interchange was paid for by the developers.
The ramp connecting Wynford with the northbound parkway required a tunnel under the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) Midtown railway lines. To avoid delaying trains on the vital freight line, a prefabricated concrete arch was jacked into the embankment, at a time, over 12 days. This was the first North American use of such a technique.
From 1986 to 1988, the City studied traffic congestion in the &#x27;Don Valley Corridor&#x27;, an area from Leslie Street east to Victoria Park Avenue. To improve traffic in the area, the proposed solutions were extending Leslie Street south of Eglinton Avenue and south-west to Bayview Avenue; widening Don Mills Road; and expanding the parkway.
Two proposals were put forward for approval: the Leslie Street extension and widening of Don Mills Road. Don Mills Road was widened from four to six lanes with the new lanes to be high occupancy/bus lanes.
The Leslie Street extension was approved by East York and North York, but was abandoned by Metro Council in 1993, after the provincial government refused to subsidize its construction.

In 1989, a public meeting was held on the future of the Don River, which was widely known for its pollution, and the Don Valley, considered an &quot;industrial wasteland&quot; and which had seen its last industrial use (the Taylor, later Domtar, Paper Mill) close in 1982. The Toronto City Council formed the &quot;Task Force to Bring Back the Don&quot;, an organization of volunteers to work on conservation efforts in the Don Valley. Since that time, the task force has planted some 40,000 trees in the valley, planted thousands of wildflowers and overseen the creation of wetlands along the river. Efforts continue to ameliorate the water quality of the river and improve the environment of the surrounding valley lands. These efforts can be seen in the &quot;Crother&#x27;s Woods&quot; north of Bloor Street and the Chester Marsh just south of Bloor Street, alongside the parkway.

Located north of the Bayview/Bloor interchange, the Pottery Road underpass was rebuilt in 1994. It was over 30 years old and it required the replacement of columns and a restructuring of the deck. It was worn down due to the cumulative effect of heavy traffic and weather. The replacement necessitated the closure of several lanes of the parkway from April until the autumn that year.

In 2001, Toronto City Councillor Paul Sutherland proposed to add two toll lanes in each direction along the parkway, from Highway 401 to Eglinton Avenue. From Eglinton Avenue south, one lane in each direction would be added. The proposal was criticized by transportation experts such as Transport 2000 for encouraging driving to downtown. Sutherland estimated the cost of the proposal at $200 million.
On May 11, 2007, GO Transit announced a plan to put dedicated bus lanes on the centre median of the parkway, to allow its buses to bypass traffic congestion and promote buses as an alternative to automobiles. The $12 million plan would be paid for by GO. The plan would require testing of soil conditions and an environmental assessment.
GO Transit was taken over by the provincial Metrolinx transit agency, and the plan did not appear in the 2008 &quot;Big Move&quot; Regional Transportation Plan of Metrolinx.
A second proposal, to allow GO Transit buses to use the left shoulder to pass slow traffic was approved in June 2010 by Toronto City Council.
The centre median shoulders, starting with the section between Lawrence Avenue and a point north of York Mills Road, are opened to GO Transit buses to pass other traffic, at no more than faster, when the other traffic is going at or less.
These lanes opened to buses beginning September 7, 2010.
City Council directed the General Manager of Transportation Services to report on the feasibility of future bus bypass lanes in the segments from Pottery Road to Don Mills Road and between Don Mills Road and Eglinton Avenue East.

On June 7, 2010, a section of the expressway was dedicated by former Toronto mayor David Miller as part of the &quot;Route of Heroes&quot;. Similar to the &quot;Highway of Heroes&quot; designation of part of Highway 401, the designation serves to honour fallen Canadian soldiers. The designation applies to the portion of the parkway between Highway 401 and Bloor Street by which repatriation processions travel when transporting the remains of Canadian soldiers from CFB Trenton to the Office of the Coroner in downtown Toronto (but since September 27, 2013 all future repatriation travels to the new Centre of Forensic Sciences at Keele Street near Wilson Avenue)

The lower section of the roadway from the Gardiner Expressway to south of Gerrard Street East has been flooded by overflowing water from the Don River on more than one occasion. This section of the Parkway was closed in 1986, in 2010 and twice in 2013 due to flooding. The elevation of the highway had been designed to 1955 estimates for maximum flood levels.

The Don Valley Parkway is closed annually on the first Sunday in June for the Ride for Heart.

== Future ==

During the 2010 municipal election, mayoral candidate Sarah Thomson proposed a road toll for the Gardiner Expressway and Don Valley Parkway, drawing comments from critics and supporters across the city.

Two projects are underway that may change the parkway&#x27;s southern end. Waterfront Toronto is conducting an environmental assessment to evaluate replacing, modifying or removing the Gardiner Expressway east of Jarvis Street.
The parkway would then end at Lake Shore Boulevard. The City of Toronto eventually decided to keep the Gardiner–Don Valley Parkway connection, with revised ramps. A second proposal, known as the &quot;Don Mouth Naturalization and Port Lands Flood Protection&quot; project, seeks to recreate the natural mouth of the Don River into Toronto Harbour with the surrounding parkland. The project is managed by the Toronto and Region Conservation Authority and Waterfront Toronto.
The ramps between the parkway and the Gardiner Expressway pass directly over the Don River channel.

A third project, the &quot;Don River Valley Park&quot; to link all of the open space from the Toronto Brick Works south to the harbour, has proposed changes that will impact the highway. The first is the replacement of the current Bayview–Bloor interchange roadways to free up green space. The second is the relocation of rail lines on the west bank of the Don River to the east bank. A third is a new land bridge over the highway joining the two sections of Riverdale Park.

In late 2016, the City of Toronto and mayor John Tory considered imposing a toll to use the highway, along with the Gardiner Expressway, to cover the maintenance costs of the highway and support public transit construction.
However, the plan was rejected by the Ontario government.

In November 2023, the municipal and provincial governments announced a tentative deal which will see the Don Valley Parkway and the Gardiner Expressway uploaded to the province and maintained as provincial highways.

<text>The Prince Edward Viaduct System, commonly referred to as the Bloor Viaduct, is the name of a truss arch bridge system in Toronto, Ontario, Canada, connecting Bloor Street East, on the west side of the system, with Danforth Avenue on the east. The system includes the Rosedale Valley phase (a smaller structure, referred to as the Rosedale Valley Bridge, carrying Bloor Street over the Rosedale Ravine) and the Sherbourne Phase, an embankment built to extend Bloor Street East to the Rosedale Ravine from Sherbourne Street. The Don Valley phase of the system, the most recognizable, spans the Don River Valley, crossing over (from west to east) the Bayview Avenue Extension, the Don River, and the Don Valley Parkway.

The roadway has five lanes (three eastbound and two westbound) with a bicycle lane in each direction. The subway level connects Broadview station in the east with and stations to the west.

==History==

Referendums on the construction of the Prince Edward Viaduct were held in Toronto in every year from 1910 to 1913, with residents voting against its construction in 1912 by 59 votes and in favour in 1913 by 9236 votes. The projected cost of its construction increased from in 1910 to in 1913; its final cost was ($ in dollars). Upon its completion in 1918, it was named for Prince Edward, Prince of Wales (later King Edward VIII).

The viaduct was designed to facilitate mass transit; its upper deck accommodated streetcars, while both the Don Valley phase and the Rosedale Valley phase included a lower deck for rail transport, controversial at the time because of its high additional cost. The bridge&#x27;s designer and the commissioner of public works, R.C. Harris, were able to have their way and the lower deck eventually proved to save millions of dollars when the Toronto Transit Commission&#x27;s Bloor–Danforth subway opened in 1966. The Rosedale Valley phase was not used for the subway, as the curve between each phase, as well as the curve to the west at Parliament Street, was considered too sharp for the subway. For this reason, a separate concrete bridge was built over the Rosedale Valley, just west of Castle Frank station.

The Prince Edward Viaduct resulted in more rapid development of those portions of Toronto lying on the east side of the Don Valley.

==Design==
Designed by Edmund W. Burke, the Prince Edward Viaduct is a three hinged concrete-steel arch bridge with a total span of 494 metres (1,620 feet), at 40 metres (131 feet) above the Don Valley. The bridge consists of a deck made of transverse beams and I-girders, which transfer load to column supports. The column supports then transfer the load to the trusses within the arches, which transfer the load to the arches themselves. Finally, the arches transfer their load through large hinges to a concrete pier and eventually to the ground. Steel was provided by Dominion Bridge Company.

In addition to the Don River, the Don Valley Parkway, and Bayview Avenue, two railway lines, an electrical transmission line and a bicycle trail all pass under the bridge spans.

===Luminous Veil===
Over time, the Prince Edward Viaduct became a magnet for suicide, falling bodies posing risk to the traffic underneath. With nearly 500 suicides by 2003, the viaduct ranked as the most fatal standing structure in Canada and the second most in North America, after the Golden Gate Bridge in San Francisco. At its peak in 1997, the suicide rate averaged one person every 22 days. In 1957, a child also climbed onto the railing and fell accidentally while walking along it but survived. People who have survived the jump have had severe consequences including paralysis, organ damage, broken bones and lifelong pain. Most think that jumping will lead to an instant death but for many death is not instant. 

The suicides and safety risks prompted the construction of a barrier in 2003, though it was first approved by Toronto City Council in 1998 and delayed because of concerns about funding; during that time, the viaduct was the site of an estimated 48 to 60 suicides. The council originally approved a budget. However, the minimum bid for construction was . Council eventually endorsed a fundraising campaign to raise the remainder of the money. Construction was completed in 2003 at the cost of , with coming from taxpayers.

The barrier was called the &quot;Luminous Veil&quot;. Designed by architect Dereck Revington and engineers at Halcrow Yolles and completed in 2003, the Luminous Veil consists of over 9,000 steel rods, apart and high, stretched to cantilevered girders. The tensile structure was difficult to analyze and required several tests at the University of Toronto. Initially, cost prohibited the planned lighting to be installed on the top horizontal member. The lighting installation was completed in July 2015. The Luminous Veil received in 1999 a Canadian Architect Award of Excellence.

A 2010 study found that though the barrier prevented suicide attempts from the viaduct, overall rates of suicide by jumping for the City of Toronto have not changed since its construction. However, a 2017 study with the same lead author found that &quot;over the long term, suicide-by-jumping declined in Toronto after the barrier with no associated increase in suicide by other means&quot;.

==Popular culture==
The bridge was shut down for three days to allow the filming of &quot;&quot; (2004), where in the film it represented the only way out of Raccoon City.

<doc id="365735" wikidata="Q1005922" url="?curid=365735" title="Ryton-on-Dunsmore">
<text>Ryton-on-Dunsmore is a village and civil parish in the Borough of Rugby, Warwickshire, England. It is situated 6 miles (8.8 km) south-east of Coventry and 8 miles (12.1 km) west of Rugby. The 2001 census recorded a population of 1,672 in the parish, increasing to 1,813 at the 2011 census. The A45 dual carriageway bissects Ryton, and nearby villages include Bubbenhall, Stretton-on-Dunsmore and Wolston. Garden Organic, the leading organic growing charity in the United Kingdom, has a demonstration garden dedicated to organic gardening in the village. Ryton Pools Country Park is about a mile south-west of the village.

==Car plant==
The former factory (also known as the Ryton plant) was a key feature of the village for more than sixty years. It was situated between the A45 (on the north-east) and the A423 (on the south-west) in Warwickshire. The south-east of the factory site bordered with Ryton-on-Dunsmore village. The factory was originally constructed by the Rootes Group in 1940 to build aircraft engines during World War II. After the war it became the headquarters of the Rootes Group, but when the organisation entered financial difficulties in the 1960s, the company (in stages) and thus the plant was taken over by the American car manufacturing giant Chrysler.

Chrysler itself entered financial difficulties, and sold the plant for a symbolic US$1.00 to PSA Peugeot Citroën in 1978, and from this stage, all cars produced at the plant were badged as Talbots, reviving an old brand name to replace the Chrysler brand in Britain, and the Simca name on the continent. Peugeot started building its 309 there on 28 October 1985, and by the end of 1987, it had been joined by the 405. This followed a decision by Peugeot in 1985, to phase out the Talbot brand, but to retain the old Rootes Group and Simca factories, for the production of Peugeot badged cars.

Peugeot 309 production was switched to France in 1989, with the plant briefly becoming a one model plant for production of the 405, but the 306 joined in the end of 1992, and for a while was the mainstay of production after the 405&#x27;s demise in the autumn of 1995. The estate model was not axed until 1997, but had always been produced in France, and Peugeot had decided to produce the 405&#x27;s successor (the 406) in France. The second production line was revived over the summer of 1998, with the commencement of production of the 206, and the 206 was the only car produced at the plant, after the end of production of the 306 in the spring of 2001. Peugeot had also decided to produce the new 307 in France rather than at Ryton.

In January 2004, Peugeot decided not to manufacture the 207 in Ryton, thus leaving the factory in danger of being shut down. In February 2004, the 1,000,000th 206 rolled off the production line. In April 2006, Peugeot decided that the Ryton plant would close during July 2007. In October 2006, however, Peugeot announced it will close its plant six months sooner than expected. In the event, it closed on 12 December 2006, and the site was sold to developer Trenport Investments Ltd for industrial use in March 2007. Demolition of the plant began on 12 November 2007. In October 2012, Network Rail acquired the site from Prologis, and constructed a haulage distribution centre. The centre opened the following year, and serves as a hub for the &quot;National Delivery Service&quot; for Network Rail.

<text>A DI unit (direct input or direct inject) is an electronic device typically used in recording studios and in sound reinforcement systems to connect a high output impedance unbalanced output signal to a low-impedance, microphone level, balanced input, usually via an XLR connector and XLR cable. DIs are frequently used to connect an electric guitar or electric bass to a mixing console&#x27;s microphone input jack. Its signal comes &quot;direct&quot; from the source instrument without passing through the air as sound waves, and thus is isolated from other sounds and avoids effects of microphone or room acoustics. The DI performs level matching, balancing, and either active buffering or passive impedance matching or impedance bridging. DI units are typically metal boxes with input and output jacks and, for more expensive units, “ground lift” and attenuator switches.

DI boxes are extensively used with professional and semi-professional PA systems, professional sound reinforcement systems and in sound recording studios. Manufacturers produce a wide range of units, from inexpensive, basic, passive units to expensive, sophisticated, active units. DI boxes may provide numerous features and user-controllable options (e.g., a user-selectable 0dB, 20dB or 40dB pad and/or a &quot;ground lift&quot; switch). They may come in different types of enclosures, usually a metal chassis that helps to protect against electrical interference. Some bass amplifiers have built-in DI units, so that the bass amp&#x27;s output signal can be connected directly to a mixing board in a sound reinforcement/live show or recording context.

==Terminology==
DI units are also referred to as a DI box, direct box, or simply DI, with each letter pronounced, as in &quot;Dee Eye.&quot; The term is variously claimed to stand for &quot;direct input&quot;, &quot;direct injection&quot;, &quot;direct induction&quot; or &quot;direct interface&quot;.

==History==

Passive direct boxes first appeared in the United States in the middle 1960s, most notably in Detroit at radio stations and recording studios like Motown, United Sound Systems, Golden World Records, Tera Shirma Studios and the Metro-Audio Capstan Roller remote recording truck. These DIs were custom made by engineers like Ed Wolfrum with his &quot;Wolfbox&quot; and by concert sound companies to help amplify electric musical instruments.

These boxes typically contained an audio transformer with a turns ratio from approximately 8:1 to 12:1 to help with impedance bridging from the high output impedance of an instrument&#x27;s pickup to the relatively lower input impedance of a typical mixing console&#x27;s microphone preamp. For example, the Triad A-11J used in the Wolfbox has a turns ratio of 10:1 and thus an impedance ratio of 100:1. The typical console preamp input impedance of 1,500 ohms would appear to the electronic instrument as a high input impedance of 150,000 ohms. 

The passive direct box was suitable for most electronic musical instruments but it negatively colored the sound of instruments with weaker output signals, such as Fender Rhodes pianos and Fender Precision Basses with single-coil pickups. To accommodate these instruments, active direct boxes were designed containing powered electronic circuitry which increased the input impedance to above 1,000,000 ohms. In 1975, a 48-volt phantom powered active direct box was designed for Leon Russell&#x27;s recording studio, its circuitry published in the April 1975 edition of &quot;dB&quot;, the sound engineering magazine. The sound company Tycobrahe, known for supporting large rock festivals such as California Jam, offered an active direct box for sale in 1977 capable of +9 dBm line level output with a built-in attenuator to compensate for various input levels.

==Purpose==
There are two related purposes for a direct box: audio and electrical. The audio purpose is to deliver a clean, unaltered instrument signal to a mixing console or recording device, where it may be processed using other devices (equalization, compression, modulation, reverberation, etc.) to meet the needs of the audio production. Without a direct box, an instrument or microphone needs to be connected to an amplifier, which might then be connected to a speaker, another microphone, and then to the mixing console. These electronic stages and cables can color the sound in ways that some audio engineers and musicians find undesirable. Of course the reverse is true—many times musicians and audio engineers seek this coloring because it fits the style of music or recording. 

The electrical purpose of a direct box is to bridge the impedance of the input and output. Most electronic instruments and microphones cannot be plugged directly into the pre-amplifier inputs of mixing boards or recording devices because of impedance mismatch. Instruments are typically high impedance, whereas microphone inputs are low impedance.

The direct box takes a high impedance, unbalanced signal and converts it to a low impedance, balanced signal. This allows the signal to be sent over long cable runs without signal loss, and greater rejection of interference due to the benefit of common mode rejection in a balanced signal. Furthermore, it allows the low impedance signal to be sent to the input preamp of a mixing console which is designed to accept input from low impedance microphones.

Because all cables are capacitive, long cables used in live sound and recording can become a low‑pass filter which reduces the high end frequencies when used with high-impedance source. Another advantage of DI units is that the DI contains a transformer to provide galvanic isolation that can eliminate a ground‑loop hum.

==Passive units==

A passive DI unit consists of an audio transformer used as a balun. The term &quot;passive&quot; indicates that the unit does not require a power source (such as batteries or phantom power) to operate. This makes passive DIs less expensive, but it also means that they cannot amplify signal power. The turns ratio on a passive DI is typically chosen to convert a nominal 50 kΩ signal source (such as the magnetic pickup of an electric guitar or electric bass) to the 100–200 Ω expected by the mic input of an audio mixer. Typical turns ratios are in the range of 10:1 to 20:1. Less commonly, a passive DI unit may consist of a resistive load, with or without capacitor coupling. Such units are best suited to outputs designed for headphones or loudspeakers.

The less expensive passive DI units are more susceptible to hum, and passive units tend to be less versatile than active; however, they require no power source, are simpler to use, and the better units are extremely reliable when used as designed. The lack of batteries in passive DIs means that users do not have to worry about batteries losing their power in the middle of a live show or recording session.

Some models have no settings or switches, while others can have a ground lift switch (to avoid ground loop problems or hums), a pad switch (to accommodate different source levels and attenuate too-strong signals) and a passive filter/equalization switch for coloring the sound or tone.

==Active units==

An active DI unit contains a preamplifier. Active DI units can therefore provide gain, and are inherently more complex and versatile than passive units. Active DI units require a power source, which is normally provided by batteries or a standard AC outlet connection, and may contain the option for phantom power use. Most active DI units provide switches to enhance their versatility. These may include gain or level adjustment, ground lift, power source selection, and mono or stereo mode. Ground lift switches often disconnect phantom power. Some active DI units also have electronic effects units.

A pass-through connector is a second jack, sometimes simply paralleled to the input connector, that delivers the input signal unchanged, to allow the DI unit to be inserted into a signal path without interrupting it. This allows a user, such as an electric bass player, to plug their bass into a DI unit, which routes the bass signal to the mixing board, and at the same time plug the bass into an onstage bass amp for monitoring purposes. Pass-through is also commonly referred to as a bypass. True-bypass occurs when the signal goes straight from the input jack to the output jack with no circuitry involved and no loading of the source impedance. False bypass (or simply &#x27;bypass&#x27;) occurs when the signal is routed through the device circuitry with buffering and no other intentional change to the signal. However, due to the nature of electrical designs there is almost always some slight change in the signal. The extent of change and how noticeable it may be can vary from unit to unit.
==Preamplifiers==
A number of companies make combination preamplifier-DI units for electric bass, double bass, or for acoustic instruments which use piezoelectric pickups (e.g., a violin, acoustic guitar, mandolin, etc.). These units may be housed in a &quot;stompbox&quot; pedal format, in a small rackmount unit (often less than a full rack space), or in units designed to be clipped to a belt or attached to an instrument.

Preamplifiers for electric bass typically contain gain knobs, sometimes including an overdrive effect unit, equalizer knobs and, for some higher-end units, multiple channels (e.g., a &quot;clean&quot; channel and a &quot;dirty&quot; channel, with the latter containing an overdrive effect). 

Preamp-DI units for double bass and other acoustic instruments often omit the overdrive features, but add additional features that help to produce a good sound and tone for acoustic instruments, such as an audio compression effect, a phase inverter switch and a notch filter (the latter two features designed to help reduce unwanted audio feedback &quot;howls&quot;). Preamp-DIs for acoustic instruments often include two channels and a simple mixer, to enable the player to use both a pickup and a condensor microphone. Some preamp-DIs provide phantom power, in case this is required to power a condenser microphone. Preamp-DI units may be battery powered, have an AC mains plug, or both.

==Typical applications==
Direct boxes are typically used with electric instruments or other electronic musical devices that only contain an unbalanced 1/4&quot; phone output which needs to be connected to an XLR input of a mixing board. Multiple direct box circuits can be mounted inside one housing. These are used for multiple unbalanced outputs, such as for a bank of electronic keyboards.

===Acoustic or electric instruments===
DI boxes can be used on instruments with electronic circuitry and pickups that do not contain an XLR balanced output. An example of this application would be an electric keyboard that needs to be connected to a mixing board, either directly or through an audio snake. Another example would be an acoustic guitar with pickups, an electric guitar or bass guitar, or a double bass with piezoelectric pickups. These instruments could be plugged into a DI box, and the DI signal would be mixed through a mixing console into a main or monitor mix.

===Instrument amplifiers===
Some instrument amplifiers, particularly bass amplifiers, contain built-in DI units, and can be connected to a mixing console directly without needing an external direct box. This would be a typical setup for a bassist who wanted to connect their instrument through a public address system (PA system) or sound reinforcement system at a live show, while keeping the unique sound of the amplifier&#x27;s preamplifier and equalizer circuitry and the custom settings. In comparison, if an external DI box is used, with the bassist plugging their bass into the DI box and sending the signal to their bass amp, the DI box signal would be the direct signal from the bass&#x27; pickups. With the external DI box approach, the sound shaping added to the bass&#x27; signal on the amplifier (e.g. boosting the preamplifier, adding overdrive, or adjusting the equalization to change the tone) would not be present in the external DI box signal. Some instrument amplifiers have the ability to turn off the amplifier&#x27;s equalizer (EQ) through a pre-eq/post-eq switch. This can be used if a &quot;clean&quot; direct output from the amplifier is desired, which does not contain the tone shaping created by the bassist&#x27;s adjustment of the EQ controls.

It is common to use both a DI signal and a microphone in front of the speaker cabinet or combo amp, in both live sound and recording settings. One method is to connect a bass guitar amplifier&#x27;s speaker level output (via a pad, to attenuate the signal) to a DI and then run it to one channel of the mixing console, and run a miked guitar speaker cabinet signal into another channel of the mixing console. Another method is to connect a DI between the guitar and the amplifier. The DI signal and mic&#x27;d guitar speaker can then be selectively blended, with the DI providing a more immediate, present, bright, un-equalized sound, and the microphone providing a more &#x27;live&#x27; sound, with instrument amplifier and speaker enclosure characteristics and some room ambience (natural reverb).

==Examples of use==
Direct-input tracking is used on almost every electric bass part on &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, most prominently on &quot;Lucy In The Sky With Diamonds&quot;, &quot;When I&#x27;m Sixty-Four&quot;, &quot;Lovely Rita&quot;, and &quot;A Day in The Life&quot;, as well as &quot;Only A Northern Song&quot;, &quot;I Me Mine&quot;, and the lead-guitar introducing &quot;Revolution&quot;. Other examples include Dave Matthews Band&#x27;s &quot;So Much To Say&quot; and Adele&#x27;s &quot;Daydreamer&quot;. The main guitar riff on Led Zeppelin&#x27;s &quot;Black Dog&quot; was recorded directly through a mic-preamp and fed through a pair of 1176 Peak Limiters. Byrds frontman and guitarist Roger Mcguinn achieved his famous jangly guitar sound in the studio by recording his 12-string Rickenbacker direct-in through a compressor to emphasize the treble.

<text>Machining is a manufacturing process where a desired shape or part is created using the controlled removal of material, most often metal, from a larger piece of raw material by cutting. Machining is a form of subtractive manufacturing, which utilizes machine tools, in contrast to &quot;additive manufacturing&quot; (e.g. 3D printing), which uses controlled addition of material.

Machining is a major process of the manufacture of many metal products, but it can also be used on other materials such as wood, plastic, ceramic, and composites. A person who specializes in machining is called a machinist. As a commercial venture, machining is generally performed in a machine shop, which consists of one or more workrooms containing primary machine tools. Although a machine shop can be a standalone operation, many businesses maintain internal machine shops or tool rooms that support their specialized needs. Much modern-day machining uses computer numerical control (CNC), in which computers control the movement and operation of mills, lathes, and other cutting machines.

== History and terminology ==
The precise meaning of the term &quot;machining&quot; has changed over the past one and a half centuries as technology has advanced in a number of ways. In the 18th century, the word &quot;machinist&quot; meant a person who built or repaired machines. This person&#x27;s work was primarily done by hand, using processes such as the carving of wood and the writing-forging and hand-filing of metal. At the time, millwrights and builders of new kinds of &quot;engines&quot; (meaning, more or less, machines of any kind), such as James Watt or John Wilkinson, would fit the definition. The noun &quot;machine tool&quot; and the verb &quot;to machine&quot; (&quot;machined, machining&quot;) did not yet exist.

Around the middle of the 20th century, the latter words were coined as the concepts they described evolved into widespread existence. Therefore, during the Machine Age, &quot;machining&quot; referred to (what we today might call) the &quot;traditional&quot; machining processes, such as turning, boring, drilling, milling, broaching, sawing, shaping, planing, abrasive cutting, reaming, and tapping. In these &quot;traditional&quot; or &quot;conventional&quot; machining processes, machine tools, such as lathes, milling machines, drill presses, or others, are used with a sharp cutting tool to remove material to achieve a desired geometry.

Since the advent of new technologies in the post–World War II era, such as electrical discharge machining, electrochemical machining, electron beam machining, photochemical machining, and ultrasonic machining, the retronym &quot;conventional machining&quot; can be used to differentiate those classic technologies from the newer ones. Currently, &quot;machining&quot; without qualification usually implies the traditional machining processes.

In the decades of the 2000s and 2010s, as additive manufacturing (AM) evolved beyond its earlier laboratory and rapid prototyping contexts and began to become standard throughout all phases of manufacturing, the term &quot;subtractive manufacturing&quot; became common retronymously in logical contrast with AM, covering essentially any removal processes also previously covered by the term &quot;machining&quot;. The two terms are effectively synonymous, although the long-established usage of the term &quot;machining&quot; continues. This is comparable to the idea that evolved because of the proliferation of ways to contact someone (telephone, email, IM, SMS, and so on) but did not entirely replace the earlier terms such as &quot;call&quot;, &quot;talk to&quot;, or &quot;write to&quot;.

=== Machining operations ===
Machining is any process in which a cutting tool removes material from the workpiece (the workpiece is often called the &quot;work&quot;). Relative motion is required in traditional machining between the device and the work to remove material; non-traditional machining processes use other methods of material removal, such as electric current in EDM (electro-discharge machining). This relative motion is achieved in most machining operations by moving (by lateral rotary or lateral motion) either the tool, or the workpiece. The shape of the tool, the relative motion, and its penetration into the work, produce the desired shape of the resulting work surface.

Machining operations can be broken down into traditional, and non-traditional operations. Within the traditional operations, there are two categories of machining based on the shape they machine; being circular shapes that includes; turning, boring, drilling, reaming, threading and more, and various/straight shapes that includes; milling, broaching, sawing, grinding and shaping.
=== Cutting tool ===
A cutting tool has one or more sharp cutting edges and is made of a harder material than the work material. The cutting edge serves to separate the chip from the parent work material. Connected to the cutting edge are the two surfaces of the tool:
* The rake face; and
* The flank.

The rake face, which directs the flow of the newly formed chip, is oriented at a certain angle and is called the rake angle &quot;α.&quot; It is measured relative to the plane perpendicular to the work surface. The rake angle can be positive or negative. The flank of the tool provides a clearance between the tool and the newly formed work surface, thus protecting the surface from abrasion, which would degrade the finish. This angle between the work and flank surfaces is called the relief angle. There are two basic types of cutting tools:
* Single point tool; and
* Multiple-cutting-edge tool

A single-point tool has one cutting edge for turning, boring, and planing. During machining, the device&#x27;s point penetrates below the work part&#x27;s original work surface. The fact is sometimes rounded to a certain radius, called the nose radius.

Multiple cutting-edge tools have more than one cutting edge and usually achieve their motion relative to the work part by rotating. Drilling and milling use turning multiple-cutting-edge tools. Although the shapes of these tools are different from a single-point device, many elements of tool geometry are similar.
=== Traditional machining ===

==== Circular machining operations ====
*Turning operations involve rotating the exterior of the workpiece against a non rotating cutting tool that is moved into the workpiece. The rotation of the workpiece is the method of producing a relative motion against the tool. Lathes are the principal machine tool used in turning.
*Boring involves the machining of an internal surface of a hole to increase it diameter, this can be performed by either turning the workpiece on a lathe (also called internal turning), or a mill where a tool is rotated around the circumference of the hole.
*Drilling operations are those in which holes are produced or refined by bringing a rotating cutting tool (often using a drill bit) with cutting edges on the lower face and edge, that is brought into contact axially with the workpiece. Drilling operations can be performed on a lathe, mill or drill press, or even by hand.
*Threading or tapping involves the cutting of defined helix (thread) into a hole (tapping or threading), or onto shaft (threading), with a constant pitch, and specific geometry designed to accept the opposite thread and object in a turning motion to fasten items together (e.g. a nut and bolt)

==== Various shape machining ====
*Sawing aims to create smaller cut lengths of bar stock material, using a saw, or cut off machine that passing a spinning (circular saw) or linear (band saw) toothed blade against the material to cut a kerf (thickness) from the material until it is cut in two. Depending on the material, a certain blade speed (in metres per minute, or feet per minute) measured as the linear speed of the teeth, may be required, between as low as 200 or 1000 feet per minute.
*Milling operations are operations where the cutting tool with cutting edges along its cylindrical face are brought against a workpiece to remove material in the profile of the spinning tools shaft and lower edge. Milling machines are the principal machine tool used in milling. Advanced CNC machines may combine lathe and milling operations.
* Broaching can refer to two operations, linear broaching, where a multi toothed tool is pressed through a hole to cut a desired shape (e.g. a spline, square, or hex shape) or along a surface by taking increasingly larger cuts by the increasing sized teeth of the broach; or rotary broaching, where a drafted tool is rotated in a special toolholder that rocks the tool around and offset axis, the tool and workpiece and mated together during machining in order to cut the desired shape. When performed in a lathe the workpiece and cutting tool rotate together, while the toolholder remains static in the tail-stock; when milling the cutting tool stops once in contact with the workpiece, only rocking around the offset axis, with the toolholder rotating in the mill.
* Shaping operations are those which remove material from a workpiece through the linear movement of a non rotating cutting tool, that is pushed along the surface of a workpiece, and designed to cut flat geometry. A shaper often uses High Speed Steel tooling similar in shape and geometry to lathe tooling. Shaping is similar to turning, in a linear axis as opposed to a circular one. Shaping operations are performed using a shaper machine, that strokes back and forth, but cuts only in one direction. A clapper box is used to raise the tool up from the work piece so that it can move backwards.
* Grinding operations involve the passing a fast moving/rotating abrasive material, such as stone, aluminium oxide, or diamond against a workpiece to remove material via grinding the material away using the abrasive surface of the tool.

=== Non-traditional machining ===

* Plasma beam machining
* Waterjet machining involves the cutting of workpiece by use of a jet of water (usually also included with an abrasive material like garnet) to cut all the way through the thickness the workpiece. A waterjet cutter may be 2-axis to produce 2-dimensional shapes, or 5-axis, to produce almost any 3-dimensional shape. 
* Electrical discharge machining (EDM) operations involve the removal of material from a workpiece using an electrically charge metal rod, or wire (wire EDM), that vaporizes the material from the workpiece. This may be used to machine holes, or cut out a specific shape from another piece. An advantage of EDM is that it can have a very small kerf, and the wire can be passed through a hole, allowing intricate shapes to be cut from a piece without cutting through the edge of the workpiece, allowing the machine of a plug and socket that fit together perfectly.

An unfinished workpiece requiring machining must have some material cut away to create a finished product. A finished product would be a workpiece that meets the specifications set out for that workpiece by engineering drawings or blueprints. For example, a workpiece may require a specific outside diameter. A lathe is a machine tool that can create that diameter by rotating a metal workpiece so that a cutting tool can cut metal away, creating a smooth, round surface matching the required diameter and surface finish. A drill can remove the metal in the shape of a cylindrical hole. Other tools that may be used for metal removal are milling machines, saws, and grinding machines. Many of these same techniques are used in woodworking.

Machining requires attention to many details for a workpiece to meet the specifications in the engineering drawings or blueprints. Besides the obvious problems related to correct dimensions, there is the problem of achieving the right finish or surface smoothness on the workpiece. The inferior finish found on the machined surface of a workpiece may be caused by incorrect clamping, a dull tool, or inappropriate presentation of a device. Frequently, this poor surface finish, known as chatter, is evident by an undulating or regular finish of waves on the machined surfaces of the workpiece.

==Cutting conditions==
Relative motion is required between the tool and work to perform a machining operation. The primary action is at a specific cutting speed. In addition, the device must be moved laterally across the work. This is a much slower motion called the feed. The remaining dimension of the cut is the penetration of the cutting tool below the original work surface, reaching the cut&#x27;s depth. Speed, feed, and depth of cut are called the cutting conditions. They form the three dimensions of the machining process, and for certain operations, their product can be used to obtain the material removal rate for the process:

:formula_1

where
*formula_2 – the material removal rate in &quot;mm3/s&quot;, (&quot;in3/s&quot;),
*formula_3 – the cutting speed in &quot;mm/s&quot;, (&quot;in/min&quot;),
*formula_4 – the feed in &quot;mm&quot;, (&quot;in&quot;),
*formula_5 – the depth of cut in &quot;mm&quot;, (&quot;in&quot;).

:Note: All units must be converted to the corresponding decimal (or USCU) units.

===Stages in metal cutting===
Machining operations usually divide into two categories, distinguished by purpose and cutting conditions:
* Roughing cuts
* Finishing cuts

Roughing cuts are used to remove a large amount of material from the starting work part as rapidly as possible, i.e., with a significant Material Removal Rate (MRR), to produce a shape close to the desired form but leaving some material on the piece for a subsequent finishing operation.
Finishing cuts complete the part and achieve the final dimension, tolerances, and surface finish. In production machining jobs, one or more roughing cuts are usually performed on the work, followed by one or two finishing cuts. Roughing operations are done at high feeds and depths – feeds of 0.4–1.25  mm/rev (0.015–0.050 in/rev) and depths of 2.5–20 mm (0.100–0.750 in) are typical, but actual values depend on the workpiece materials. Finishing operations are carried out at low feeds and depths – dinners of 0.0125–0.04  mm/rev (0.0005–0.0015 in/rev) and depths of 0.75–2.0 mm (0.030–0.075 in) are typical. Cutting speeds are lower in roughing than in finishing.

A cutting fluid is often applied to the machining operation to cool and lubricate the cutting tool. Determining whether a cutting fluid should be used and, if so, choosing the proper cutting fluid is usually included within the scope of the cutting condition.

Today other forms of metal cutting are becoming increasingly popular. An example of this is water jet cutting. Water jet cutting involves pressurized water over 620 MPa (90,000 psi) and can cut metal and have a finished product. This process is called cold cutting, which eliminates the damage caused by a heat-affected zone, as opposed to laser and plasma cutting.

== Relationship of subtractive and additive techniques==
With the recent proliferation of additive manufacturing technologies, conventional machining has been retronymously classified, in thought and language, as a subtractive manufacturing method. In narrow contexts, additive and subtractive methods may compete with each other. In the broad context of entire industries, their relationship is complementary. Each method has its advantages over the other. While additive manufacturing methods can produce very intricate prototype designs impossible to replicate by machining, strength and material selection may be limited.

<text>The Fundamental Baptist Fellowship Association (FBFA) is an association of independent fundamentalist African-American Baptist churches.It is based in Kansas City, Kansas.
The FBFA was formed in 1962 when Reverends Richard C. Mattox and Robert Hunter, of Cleveland, Ohio, led conservative-fundamentalist black ministers and congregations to form the &quot;Fundamental Baptist Fellowship Association&quot;. The association meets annually and provides fundamentalist black Baptist churches a means of fellowship in the areas of evangelism and foreign missions. Each congregation is independent and autonomous.

A number of churches in the &quot;Fundamental Baptist Fellowship Association&quot; hold dual affiliation with the General Association of Regular Baptist Churches. In the area of Christian education, the FBFA partners with Cedarville University in Cedarville, Ohio.

The FBFA is sometimes confused with the predominantly white Fundamental Baptist Fellowship International, whose strength is in the Southeast. The FBFA is predominantly black and most of its churches are located in the Midwestern states.

<text>A travel survey (or travel diary or travel behavior inventory) is a survey of individual travel behavior. Most surveys collect information about an individual (socio-economic, demographic, etc.), their household (size, structure, relationships), and a diary of their journeys on a given day (their start and end location, start and end time, mode of travel, accompaniment and purpose of travel).

Major travel surveys are conducted in metropolitan areas typically once a decade. Some regions, notably metropolitan Seattle, Washington conduct a panel survey, which interviews the same people year after year, to see how their particular behavior evolves over time.

==Recent or continuous city-wide travel surveys==
Auckland, New Zealand - A travel survey was conducted in 2006 and involved 6,000 households in the greater Auckland region.

Brisbane, Australia - The South East Queensland Travel Survey collects travel data in the Greater Brisbane region and the neighbouring areas of Gold Coast and Sunshine Coast. The continuous survey commenced in 2003 and surveys around 6,000 households every two years.

Hobart, Australia - The Greater Hobart Household Travel Survey collects information from 200 households each month.

London, United Kingdom - The London Travel Demand Survey covers 8,000 households annually. Data is collected via face to face interviews.

Sydney, Australia - The continuous Household Travel Survey collects travel data annually for approximately 3,500 households in the Sydney Greater Metropolitan Region.

Washington, United States - The Metropolitan Washington Council of Governments conducted a 10,000 household survey in 2007.

==Recent or continuous regional travel surveys==
Greater Golden Horseshoe, Canada - the Transportation Tomorrow Survey (TTS) has been conducted every five years since 1986, surveying approximately 5% of households across the region. The 2016 TTS is one of the largest and most comprehensive travel surveys in North America, comprising a dataset of 162,708 surveys conducted online and by phone.

==Recent or continuous country-wide travel surveys==
Denmark&#x27;s most recent National Travel was initiated in 2006 and has been going on continuously since then. The interviews are conducted using the internet and telephone interviews.

Germany is conducting its National Travel Survey since 1994 on a yearly basis. Each household member fills in a travel diary in which he records each trip made during the course of one week. Despite this yearly survey there is another non regular scheduled survey which is conducted again in 2008. 25,000 households are expected to participate.

The Netherlands National Travel Survey surveyed around 34,500 households in 2003. The survey has been conducted yearly since 1985, but with some changes in methodology. Survey forms are mailed out, with follow-up motivational phone calls.

In New Zealand the Ministry of Transport annually surveys 4,600 households for a two-day period. Data is collected via face to face interviews.

The United Kingdom Department for Transport conducts the National Travel Survey 

The United States last conducted the National Household Travel Survey in 2017.

South Africa conducted its first National Household Travel Survey in 2003. Successful interviews were held with 45,000 households.

Sweden&#x27;s most recent National Travel Survey (RES) was conducted in 2006-06.

<doc id="365779" wikidata="Q279513" url="?curid=365779" title="Pollinium">
<text>A pollinium (: pollinia) is a coherent mass of pollen grains in a plant that are the product of only one anther, but are transferred, during pollination, as a single unit. This is regularly seen in plants such as orchids and many species of milkweeds (Asclepiadoideae). Usage of the term differs: in some orchids two masses of pollen are well attached to one another, but in other orchids there are two halves (with two separate viscidia) each of which is sometimes referred to as a pollinium.

Most orchids have waxy pollinia. These are connected to one or two elongate stipes, which in turn are attached to a sticky viscidium, a disc-shaped structure that sticks to a visiting insect.

Some orchid genera have mealy pollinia. These are tapering into a caudicle (stalk), attached to the viscidium. They extend into the middle section of the column.

The pollinarium is a collective term that means either (1) the complete set of pollinia from all the anthers of a flower, as in Asclepiadoideae, (2) in Asclepiadoideae, a pair of pollinia and the parts that connect them (corpusculum and translator arms), or (3) in orchids, a pair of pollinia with two viscidia and the other connecting parts.

Milkweed pollinia are housed within a stigma chamber at the bottom of anther slits of its flower. A pollinating insect often stumbles in such a way that its legs fall down the slits, then pull up the pollinia as it tries to free its legs; the pollinia can be carried to another flower and dropped down the latter&#x27;s slits to achieve pollination. However, the insect sometimes fails to retract its legs from the slits and is trapped there until it dies.

<text>The U.S. Metropolitan Travel Survey Archive is a project to store, preserve, and make publicly available, via the internet, travel surveys conducted by metropolitan areas, states and localities.

As of 2007, the archive held 58 surveys comprising 2,718,329 trip records, 516,108 person records, 219,097 household records, 173,354 vehicle records, and 528,847 location records. Similar to this U.S. archive, an international archive of travel survey date has been suggested so that this service is expanded into more countries.

The motivation behind the archive is to forestall the loss of electronic files and documentation of surveys, which has befallen previous surveys. These surveys are both costly to conduct, and irreplaceable as it is impossible to reconstruct past records of human travel behavior. The archive was established with funding from the United States Department of Transportation.

<doc id="365785" wikidata="Q172451" url="?curid=365785" title="Bogeyman">
<text>The bogeyman (; also spelled or known as bogyman, bogy, bogey, and, in US English, also boogeyman) is a mythical creature typically used to frighten children into good behavior. Bogeymen have no specific appearances, and conceptions vary drastically by household and culture, but they are most commonly depicted as masculine or androgynous monsters that punish children for misbehavior. The bogeyman, and conceptually similar monsters can be found in many cultures around the world. Bogeymen may target a specific act or general misbehaviour, depending on the purpose of invoking the figure, often on the basis of a warning from an authority figure to a child. The term is sometimes used as a non-specific personification of, or metonym for, terror – and sometimes the Devil.

==Etymology==
The word &quot;bogeyman&quot;, used to describe a monster in English, may have derived from Middle English &quot;bugge&quot; or &quot;bogge&quot;, which means &#x27;frightening specter&#x27;, &#x27;terror&#x27;, or &#x27;scarecrow&#x27;. It relates to &quot;boggart&quot;, &quot;bugbear&quot; (from &quot;bug&quot;, meaning &#x27;goblin&#x27; or &#x27;scarecrow&#x27; and &quot;bear&quot;) an imaginary demon in the form of a bear that ate small children. It was also used to mean a general object of dread. The word &quot;bugaboo&quot;, with a similar pair of meanings, may have arisen as an alteration of &quot;bugbear&quot;. &quot;Bogeyman&quot; itself is known from the 15th century, though bogeyman stories are likely to be much older.

The word has equivalents in many European languages as &quot;bogle&quot; (Scots), &quot;púca,&quot; &quot;pooka&quot; or &quot;pookha&quot; (Irish), &quot;pwca&quot;, &quot;bwga&quot; or &quot;bwgan&quot; (Welsh), &quot;bucca&quot; (Cornish), &quot;buse&quot; or &quot;busemann&quot; (Norwegian), &quot;puki&quot; (Old Norse), &quot;bøhmand&quot; or &quot;bussemand&quot; (Danish), &quot;bûzeman&quot; (Western Frisian), &quot;boeman&quot; (Dutch), &quot;boeboelaas&quot; (Surinamese Dutch), &quot;Butzemann&quot; (German), &quot;Böölimaa&quot; (Swiss German), &quot;Babay/Babayka, &quot; (Russian), &quot;bauk&quot; (Serbian), &quot;bubulis&quot; (Latvian), &quot;baubas&quot; (Lithuanian), &quot;bobo (babok, bebok)&quot; (Polish), &quot;buba/gogol&quot; (Albanian), bubák (Czech), bubák (Slovak), &quot;bebok&quot; (Silesian), &quot;papão&quot; (Portuguese), &quot;&quot; (Greek), &quot;babau&quot; (also &quot;uomo nero&quot;, meaning black man) (Italian), babáj (Ukrainian), baubau (Romanian), &quot;papu&quot; (Catalan), and &quot;mumus&quot; (Hungarian).

===Physical description===
It is often described as a dark, formless creature with shapeshifting abilities. The bogeyman is known to satiate its appetite by snatching and consuming children. Descriptions of the bogeyman vary across cultures, yet there are often commonalities between them including claws/talons, or sharp teeth. The nature of the creature also varies from culture to culture, although most examples are said to be a kind of spirit, with demons, witches, and other legendary creatures being less common variants. Some are described as having animal features such as horns, hooves, or a bug-like appearance.

===Other putative origins===
Because of the myth&#x27;s global prevalence, it is difficult to find the original source of the legends. The Bogeyman was first referenced for the hobgoblins described in the 16th century England. Many believed that they were made to torment humans, and while some only played simple pranks, others were more foul in nature.

==Cultural variants==
Bogeymen, or bogeyman-like beings, are common to the folklore of many cultures, with numerous variations and equivalents.

===Sack Man===
The Sack Man is a variant of the Bogeyman folklore which, as its name suggests, stuffs children in a sack. It predominantly exists in Latin American cultures, such as Argentina, Uruguay, Chile, Paraguay, Brazil; as well as Latin Europe, in both Portugal and Spain. It is sometimes referred to as , , , or in Portuguese, (all of these names either meaning &quot;the sack man&quot; or &quot;the bag man&quot;). Another Spanish language variation is , meaning &quot;child-stealer&quot;. Similar legends are present in Eastern Europe (e.g. Bulgarian , &quot;sack man&quot;), as well as in Haiti and some countries in Asia.

=== El Coco ===
El Coco (also and , sometimes called ) is another version of the Bogeyman, common to many Spanish-speaking countries. The (or Cucafera) monster is the equivalent in certain parts of Catalonia.

In Spain, parents will sing lullabies and tell rhymes to children, warning them that if they do not sleep, will come to get them. The rhyme originated in the 17th century and while it has evolved over the years, it has still retained its original meaning to this day. Coconuts () received their name because of the hairy, brown &quot;face&quot; created by the coconut shell&#x27;s three indentations, which reminded the Portuguese sailors of &quot;Coco&quot;.

Latin America also has , although its folklore is different, commonly mixed with native beliefs and, because of cultural contacts, sometimes more closely related to the US version of the Boogeyman. However, the term is also used in Spanish-speaking Latin American countries, such as Bolivia, Colombia, Guatemala, Peru, Mexico, El Salvador, Honduras, and Venezuela, although there it is more usually called , as in Puerto Rico, the Dominican Republic, Chile, Uruguay, Panama and Argentina.

Among Mexican-Americans, is portrayed as an evil monster that hides under children&#x27;s beds at night and kidnaps or eats those who do not obey his/her parents by going to sleep when it is time to do so. However, the Spanish American bogeyman does not resemble the shapeless or hairy monster of Spain: social sciences professor Manuel Medrano says popular legend describes as a small humanoid with glowing red eyes that hides in closets or under the bed. &quot;Some lore has him as a kid who was the victim of violence... and now he&#x27;s alive, but he&#x27;s not,&quot; Medrano said, citing Xavier Garza&#x27;s 2004 book &quot;Creepy Creatures and other Cucuys&quot;.&quot;

===A Cuca===

In Brazilian folklore, a similar character called &quot;Cuca&quot; is depicted as a female humanoid alligator, or an old lady with a sack. There is a lullaby sung by many parents to their children that says that the &quot;Cuca&quot; will come to get them and make a soup, or soap out of them if they do not sleep, just as in Spain. The &quot;Cuca&quot; is also a character of Monteiro Lobato&#x27;s &quot;Sítio do Picapau Amarelo&quot; (&quot;Yellow Woodpecker&#x27;s Farm&quot;), a series of short novels written for children which contain a large number of characters from Brazilian folklore.

===Babau===
In the countries of central and Eastern Mediterranean, children who misbehave are threatened with a creature known as &quot;babau&quot; (or &quot;baubau&quot;, &quot;baobao&quot;, &quot;bavbav&quot;, or بعبع &quot;Bu&#x27;Bu&#x27;&quot; or similar). In Italy, the Babau is also called &quot;l&#x27;uomo nero&quot; or &quot;black man&quot;. In Italy, he is portrayed as a tall man wearing a heavy black coat, with a black hood or hat which hides his face. Sometimes, parents will knock loudly under the table, pretending that someone is knocking at the door, and say something like: &quot;Here comes &quot;l&#x27;uomo nero&quot;! He must know that there&#x27;s a child here who doesn&#x27;t want to drink his soup!&quot;. It is also featured in a widespread nursery rhyme in Italy: &quot;Ninna nanna, ninna oh, questo bimbo a chi lo do? Lo darò all&#x27; uomo nero, che lo tiene un anno intero.&quot; (English: &quot;Lullaby Lulla Oh, who do I give this child to? I will give him to the Boogeyman, who&#x27;s going to keep him for a whole year&quot;) &quot;L&#x27;uomo nero&quot; is not supposed to eat or harm children, but instead takes them away to a mysterious and frightening place.

===Butzemann===
German folklore has dozens of different figures that correspond to the Bogeyman. These have various appearances (such as of a gnome, man, animal, monster, ghost or devil). They are sometimes said to appear at very specific places (such as in forests, at bodies of water, cliffs, cornfields or vineyards). These figures are called by many different names, which are often only regionally known. One of these, possibly etymologically related to the Bogeyman, is the , which can be of gnome-like and other demonic or ghostly appearance. Other examples include the &quot;Buhmann&quot; (who is mostly proverbial) and &quot;der schwarze Mann&quot; (&quot;The Black Man&quot;), an inhuman creature which hides in the dark corners under the bed or in the closet and carries children away. The figure is part of the children&#x27;s game Wer hat Angst vorm schwarzen Mann? (&quot;Who is afraid of the bogeyman?&quot;).

A notable difference between it and the &quot;homem do saco&quot; is that the latter is a daytime menace and &quot;Bicho Papão&quot; is a nighttime menace. Another important difference is that &quot;Homem do Saco&quot; (&quot;Sack Man&quot;) usually kidnaps children who go to places without parents authorization, while &quot;Bicho Papão&quot; scares naughty children and hides under their beds, closets or roofs.

* Czech Republic – The equivalent of the Bogeyman in the Czech Republic is &quot;bubák&quot; (≈ imp) or &quot;strašidlo&quot; (≈ ghost), but these are not typically connected with abducting children nor with discriminating between well and bad behaved ones. This is more often attributed to &quot;polednice&quot; and &quot;klekánice&quot; (Lady Midday), or to the &quot;čert&quot; (Krampus, or lit. devil) who, along with St. Nicholas is traditionally believed to visit families on December 5.
* Egypt – The &quot;Abu Rigl Maslukha&quot; (ابو رجل مسلوخة), which translates to the &quot;Man With Burnt/Skinned Leg&quot;.

<doc id="365796" wikidata="Q271324" url="?curid=365796" title="Hedda Hopper">
<text>Elda Furry (May 2, 1885February 1, 1966), known professionally as Hedda Hopper, was an American gossip columnist and actress. At the height of her influence in the 1940s, more than 35 million people read her columns. A strong supporter of the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) hearings, Hopper named suspected Communists and was a major proponent of the Hollywood blacklist. Hopper continued to write her gossip column until her death in 1966. Her work appeared in many magazines and later on radio. She had an extended feud with Louella Parsons, an arch-rival and fellow gossip columnist.

==Early life==
Hopper was born Elda Furry in Hollidaysburg, Pennsylvania, the daughter of Margaret (née Miller; 1856–1941) and David Furry, a butcher, both members of the German Baptist Brethren. Her family was of Pennsylvania Dutch (German) descent. The family moved to Altoona when Elda was three.

==Career==
===Acting===
She eventually ran away to New York City and began her career in the chorus on the Broadway stage. Hopper was not successful in this venture. Florenz Ziegfeld called the aspiring starlet a &quot;clumsy cow&quot; and brushed off her pleas for a slot in his lavish Follies. After a few years, she joined the theater company of matinee idol DeWolf Hopper, whom she called &quot;Wolfie&quot; and would later marry. 

She remained in the chorus and they toured the country. While in the Hopper company, she realized that chorus and understudy jobs were not acting. She wanted to act, and she knew she would have to prove herself before she could hope to get anywhere in the theater. Hearing that Edgar Selwyn was casting his play &quot;The Country Boy&quot; for a road tour, she went to his office and talked him into letting her audition for the lead. She was given the role and that show toured for thirty-five weeks through forty-eight states. She studied singing during the summer and, in the fall, toured with &quot;The Quaker Girl&quot; in the second lead, the prima donna role. The show closed in Albany.

In 1913, she became the fifth wife of DeWolf Hopper, whose previous wives were named Ella, Ida, Edna and Nella. The similarity in names caused some friction, as he would sometimes call Elda by the name of one of his former wives. Consequently, Elda Hopper paid a numerologist $10 to tell her what name she should use, and the answer was &quot;Hedda&quot;. She began acting in silent movies in 1915. Her motion picture debut was in &quot;The Battle of Hearts&quot; (1916) with William Farnum, but she made a major splash in &quot;Virtuous Wives&quot; (1918), in which she established her pattern of playing society women. Hopper decided to upstage the film&#x27;s headline starlet, Anita Stewart, by spending all of her $5,000 salary on a lavish wardrobe from the upscale boutique Lucile, which she wore in the film. By 1920, she was commanding $1,000 per week as a free agent in New York; in 1923 she moved to Hollywood and became a contract player for Louis B. Mayer Pictures. She appeared in more than 120 movies over her 23 year acting career.

===Writing===

As Hopper&#x27;s movie career waned in the mid-1930s, she looked for other sources of income. In 1935, she agreed to write a weekly Hollywood gossip column for &quot;The Washington Herald&quot; at $50 a week (), which was cancelled after four months when she refused to take a $15 pay cut. In 1937, Hopper was offered another gossip column opportunity, this time with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;. Her column, entitled &quot;Hedda Hopper&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;, debuted on February 14, 1938. Hopper could not type, nor spell very well, so she dictated her column to a typist over the phone. Hopper used her extensive contacts forged during her acting days to gather material for her column. Her first major scoop had national implications: in 1939, Hopper printed that President Franklin Roosevelt&#x27;s son James Roosevelt was divorcing his wife Betsey after being caught in an affair with a nurse at the Mayo Clinic.

Part of Hopper&#x27;s public image was her fondness for wearing extravagant hats, for which the Internal Revenue Service allowed her a $5,000 annual tax deduction as a work expense. During the Second World War, the Nazis used photographs of Hopper in her extravagant hats for propaganda, as a symbol of &quot;American decadence&quot;. Her annual income was $250,000, enabling her to live a luxurious lifestyle and maintain a mansion in Beverly Hills, which she described as &quot;the house that fear built&quot;.

After Hopper printed a story about an extramarital affair between Joseph Cotten and Deanna Durbin, Cotten ran into Hopper at a social event and pulled out her chair, only to continue pulling it out from under her when she sat down and then kick her in the rear. The next day, he received dozens of flower bouquet deliveries and congratulatory telegrams from others in the industry, thanking him for having the courage to do what everyone else dreamed of doing. Cotten later threatened Hopper that he would kick her again if she kept slandering him.

Hopper spread rumors that Michael Wilding and Stewart Granger had a sexual relationship. Her 1962 book &quot;The Whole Truth and Nothing But&quot;, which she promoted on the CBS television series &quot;What’s My Line?&quot;, included a chapter in which Hopper asserted their relationship was a fact. Wilding sued Hopper for libel and won.

Hopper was an advocate for actress Joan Crawford, whose career suffered in the early 1940s after she was labelled &quot;Box-Office Poison&quot; and forced to resign from Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. In 1945, Hopper reprinted a press release for &quot;Mildred Pierce&quot; in her column, which described Crawford as a leading contender for the Best Actress Oscar. Such was Hopper&#x27;s influence that she was credited with swinging the decision in Crawford&#x27;s favor when she won the award. Hopper&#x27;s support has been described as the first instance of lobbying the Academy of Motion Picture Arts and Sciences to favor a certain nominee.

Hopper lobbied for African American actor James Baskett to receive an Academy Award for his performance in the 1946 film &quot;Song of the South&quot;. Baskett would ultimately receive an honorary award for his performance. Actress ZaSu Pitts compared Hopper to &quot;a ferret&quot;. Joan Bennett sent Hopper a &quot;$35 valentine. The $35 went for a skunk which carried a note: &#x27;Won&#x27;t you be my valentine? Nobody else will. I stink and so do you.&#x27;&quot; Hopper reportedly commented that the skunk was beautifully behaved. She called it Joan, and passed it on to actor James Mason and his wife as a present, as they had made the first bid after the story about the unusual gift made the news.

During World War II, Hopper&#x27;s only child, actor William &quot;Bill&quot; Hopper, served in the Navy in Underwater Demolitions. She chastised Douglas Fairbanks Jr., the son of her old friend Douglas Fairbanks, because she thought the younger Fairbanks was shirking his duty to his country. Fairbanks Jr. recalled in his memoirs &quot;Salad Days&quot; that he was already in uniform serving in the United States Navy, and despised Hopper for her insinuations.

Actor Kirk Douglas recounted an interaction between Hopper and Elizabeth Taylor. At the premiere of Taylor and her husband Richard Burton&#x27;s film &quot;The Sandpiper&quot; (1965), Hopper began to complain when she saw screenwriter Dalton Trumbo&#x27;s screen credit (she had led the charge in blacklisting Trumbo for his Communist party membership). This caused Taylor to turn around and say &quot;Hedda, why don&#x27;t you just shut the fuck up?&quot;

In 1963, Hopper complained in her column that three out of five Best Actor Oscar nominees were British and only two were American: &quot;The weather&#x27;s so foul on that tight little isle that, to get in out of the rain, they all gather in theatres and practise &quot;Hamlet&quot; on each other.&quot;

===Feud with Louella Parsons===
When Hopper initially came to Hollywood, she and Louella Parsons had had a mutually beneficial arrangement. At the time, Hopper was a moderately successful actress, and according to Parson&#x27;s successor, Dorothy Manners, &quot;if anything happened on a set—if a star and leading man were having an affair—Hedda would give Louella a call.” In return, Hedda was guaranteed a few lines of copy under Louella&#x27;s increasingly influential byline.

After MGM canceled her contract, Hopper struggled to maintain her career as an actress. She was offered a position as a Hollywood columnist by the Esquire Feature Syndicate due to a recommendation by Andy Hervey of MGM’s publicity department.

One of the first papers to pick up “Hedda Hopper’s Hollywood” was the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, a morning paper like Louella&#x27;s &quot;Examiner&quot;. Hopper first publicly scooped Parsons with the divorce of the president&#x27;s son Jimmy Roosevelt (a Goldwyn employee), who was involved with a Mayo Clinic nurse, from his wife, Betsey. The story became front-page news across the country.

====&quot;Citizen Kane&quot;====
When rumors began to surface that Orson Welles’ debut film &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; was inspired by the life of William Randolph Hearst, Parsons lunched with the director, and believed his evasions and denials. Hopper arrived uninvited to an early screening of the film and wrote a scathing critique, calling it a &quot;vicious and irresponsible attack on a great man&quot;. As a result, Hearst sent Parsons a letter complaining that he had learned about &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; from Hopper, and not her.

====Ingrid Bergman====
In the early 1950s, the &quot;Los Angeles Examiner&quot; ran on its front page above Parsons&#x27;s byline: &quot;Ingrid Bergman Baby Due in Three Months at Rome&quot;. Bergman left her husband, neurologist Peter Lindstrom, to live in Italy with director Roberto Rossellini, but the news that she might be pregnant was met with some skepticism. Bergman was well known for the angelic role of Sister Benedict in &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot;.

Hopper, who had been a public supporter of Bergman, believed the actress&#x27;s denial of the pregnancy, and printed a fervent repudiation of the rumor. However, Bergman was indeed pregnant and Hopper, enraged at being scooped, launched a PR campaign decrying Bergman for being pregnant out of wedlock, and carrying a married man&#x27;s child. Parsons had allegedly received the tip from Howard Hughes, who was incensed at Bergman for being unable to shoot a film for him as promised.

====Reaction====
Reportedly, whereas Hopper was more inclined to see their much-publicized antagonism as funny and good for business, Parsons took it personally and saw Hopper as a rival in every possible way. Hopper also referred to Doc Martin as &quot;that goddamn clap doctor&quot;, which infuriated Parsons. Louis B. Mayer assisted Hopper in establishing herself as a columnist, and her role was supported by other studio chiefs, which saw it as a step in offsetting Louella&#x27;s monopolistic power. Gossip columnist Liz Smith stated: &quot;The studios created both of them. And they thought they could control both of them. But they became Frankenstein monsters escaped from the labs.&quot; Hopper and Parsons had a combined readership of 75 million in a country of 160 million.

==Politics==
Hopper was a fervent Republican. During the 1944 presidential election, she spoke before a massive rally organized by David O. Selznick in the Los Angeles Coliseum in support of the Dewey-Bricker ticket, as well as Governor Earl Warren of California, who later became Dewey&#x27;s running mate in 1948, and later the Chief Justice of the United States. The gathering drew 93,000, with Cecil B. DeMille as the master of ceremonies, and Walt Disney as one of the speakers. Others in attendance included Ronald Reagan, Barbara Stanwyck, Ann Sothern, Ginger Rogers, Randolph Scott, Adolphe Menjou, Dick Powell, Gary Cooper, Edward Arnold, and William Bendix. Despite the good turnout at the rally, most Hollywood celebrities who took a public position sided with the Roosevelt-Truman ticket.

Hopper strongly supported the House Un-American Activities Committee (HUAC) hearings, and was a guest and speaker of the Women&#x27;s Division at the 1956 Republican National Convention held in San Francisco to renominate the Eisenhower–Nixon ticket. She was so well known for her conservatism that rumor had it she planned to stand up, unfurl an American flag, and walk out of the 23rd Academy Awards ceremony in March 1951 if Jose Ferrer, who was known to be a socialist, should win Best Actor. The rumor was untrue but Hopper joked that she wished she had thought of it. Screenwriter Jay Bernstein related that when he told Hopper that many people in Hollywood privately called her a Nazi because of her extreme conservatism, the gossip columnist began to cry and replied: &quot;Jay, all I&#x27;ve ever tried to be is a good American.&quot;

==Blacklisting==
Hopper was one of the driving forces behind the creation of the Hollywood blacklist, using her 35 million strong readership to destroy the careers of those in the entertainment industry whom she suspected of being a Communist, having communist sympathies, being homosexual, or leading dissolute lives. She was a leading member of the Motion Picture Alliance for the Preservation of American Ideals, founded in 1944 and devoted to rooting out suspected Communists in Hollywood. She considered herself to be a guardian of moral standards in Hollywood and bragged that she need only wag her finger at a producer and he would break off an adulterous affair instantly.

One of Hopper&#x27;s victims was screenwriter Dalton Trumbo, who was blacklisted throughout the late 1940s and 1950s partially through Hopper&#x27;s consistently negative coverage of his Communist Party membership. When actor Kirk Douglas hired Trumbo to write the screenplay for &quot;Spartacus&quot; (1960), Hopper denounced the film in her column, stating that &quot;[the script is based on] a book written by a Commie and the screen script was written by a Commie, so don&#x27;t go see it.&quot; The film was a critical and financial success.

Charlie Chaplin was another target of Hedda Hopper&#x27;s vitriol because of his alleged Communist sympathies and his relationships with much younger women, which she considered immoral despite her own marriage to a man 27 years her senior. She also objected to him for remaining a British citizen and not becoming an American, which she considered an act of ingratitude towards a country which had given him so much. When in 1943, he denied that he was the father of 22-year old actress Joan Barry’s child, Hopper assisted Barry in filing a paternity suit against Chaplin, launching a campaign of attrition against him through her column, and calling for him to be deported for his &quot;moral turpitude&quot;. She defended her behavior by stating that she wished to make an example of Chaplin as &quot;a warning to others involved in dubious relationships.&quot; Her grudge deepened when, later in the year, Chaplin married 18-year old Oona O&#x27;Neill and gave the scoop to Louella Parsons out of dislike for Hopper. For years after the paternity trial, Hopper cooperated with the FBI to destabilize Chaplin&#x27;s career. This involved her printing damaging information leaked by the FBI concerning Chaplin&#x27;s past Communist affiliations, while Hopper in turn provided the agency with unsavory gossip about Chaplin&#x27;s personal life gleaned from her informants. Her sustained criticism of Chaplin was one of the factors which contributed to his being denied re-entry to the United States in 1952.

Actress Ingrid Bergman was also blacklisted as a result of Hedda Hopper&#x27;s sustained negative coverage in her columns. Hopper had supported Bergman in her column throughout the 1940s, advocating for her to land starring roles in &quot;The Bells of St. Mary&#x27;s&quot; (1945) and &quot;Joan of Arc&quot; (1948). She was enraged when Bergman lied to her about being pregnant with married director Roberto Rossellini&#x27;s baby. Hopper had believed Bergman&#x27;s denial of the pregnancy, printing a fervent repudiation of the rumor in 1949. However, Bergman was indeed pregnant, and the news was leaked to Hopper&#x27;s arch-rival Louella Parsons, who gained the scoop. Seeking revenge, Hopper launched a PR campaign decrying Bergman for being pregnant out of wedlock and carrying a married man&#x27;s child.

==Radio and television==

Hopper had an acting role in a radio soap opera, playing Portia Brent on the Blue Network&#x27;s &quot;Brenthouse&quot; beginning in February 1939. She debuted as host of her own radio program, &quot;The Hedda Hopper Show&quot;, on November 6, 1939. Sponsored by Sunkist, she was heard on CBS three times a week for 15 minutes until October 30, 1942. From October 2, 1944, to September 3, 1945, Armour Treet sponsored a once-a-week program. On September 10, 1945, she moved to ABC, still sponsored by Armour, for a weekly program that continued until June 3, 1946. Hopper moved back to CBS beginning on October 5, 1946 with a weekly 15-minute program, &quot;This Is Hollywood&quot;, sponsored by Procter &amp; Gamble. It ran until June 28, 1947.

Expanding to 30 minutes on NBC, she was host of a variety series, &quot;The Hedda Hopper Show&quot;, broadcast from October 14, 1950, to November 11, 1950 on Saturdays, then from November 19, 1950, to May 20, 1951 on Sundays. This program featured music, talk and dramatized excerpts from movies with well-known guests, such as Broderick Crawford reprising a scene from &quot;All the King&#x27;s Men&quot; (1949).

On January 10, 1960, a television special, &quot;Hedda Hopper&#x27;s Hollywood&quot;, aired on NBC. Hosted by Hopper, guest interviews included an eclectic mix of past, current and future stars: Lucille Ball, Francis X. Bushman, Liza Minnelli, John Cassavetes, Robert Cummings, Marion Davies, Walt Disney, Janet Gaynor, Bob Hope, Hope Lange, Anthony Perkins, Debbie Reynolds, James Stewart, and Gloria Swanson. 

Hopper had several acting roles during the latter part of her career, including brief cameo appearances as herself in the movie &quot;Sunset Boulevard&quot; (1950) and &quot;The Patsy&quot; (1964), as well as episodes of &quot;I Love Lucy&quot;, &quot;The Ford Show, Starring Tennessee Ernie Ford&quot;, and &quot;The Beverly Hillbillies,&quot; starring Buddy Ebsen. Her autobiography, &quot;From Under My Hat&quot; (Doubleday, 1952) was followed by &quot;The Whole Truth and Nothing But&quot; (1962), also published by Doubleday. She remained active as a writer until her death, producing six daily columns and a Sunday column for the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; syndicate, as well as writing articles for celebrity magazines such as &quot;Photoplay&quot;.

==Personal life==
On May 8, 1913, Hopper married actor and singer DeWolf Hopper in New Jersey. They had one child, William, who later played Paul Drake in the &quot;Perry Mason&quot; series. The couple divorced in 1922.

==Death==
Hopper died on February 1, 1966, of double pneumonia at the age of 80 in Cedars-Sinai Medical Center in Los Angeles. The probate value of Hopper&#x27;s estate was $472,661 gross and $306,679 net. She is buried at Rose Hill Cemetery, Altoona, Pennsylvania. For her contribution to the motion picture industry, Hopper has a star on the Hollywood Walk of Fame at 6313½ Hollywood Boulevard in Hollywood.

<doc id="365797" wikidata="Q3082828" url="?curid=365797" title="Éric Gagné">
<text>Éric Serge Gagné (; born January 7, 1976) is a Canadian former professional baseball pitcher who played 10 seasons in Major League Baseball (MLB), most notably for the Los Angeles Dodgers. After signing with the Dodgers as a free agent in 1995, Gagné began his career as a starting pitcher. After he struggled in that role, the Dodgers converted Gagné from a starter to a reliever, where for three years (2002–2004) he was statistically the most outstanding closer in the league, winning the Cy Young Award in 2003. During that period, he set a major league record by converting 84 consecutive save opportunities.

Gagné played sparingly in 2005 and 2006 due to injury, undergoing elbow surgery in 2005 and back surgery in 2006. The Dodgers did not re-sign him after 2006, and Gagné started the 2007 season with the Texas Rangers, where he briefly enjoyed success again as a closer. However, he was less successful in stints with the Boston Red Sox and Milwaukee Brewers, and was released after the 2008 season.

In December 2007, days after signing a contract for 2008 with the Milwaukee Brewers, he was linked to baseball&#x27;s steroids scandal after he was named in the Mitchell Report.

==Early life==
Gagné comes from a Québécois family and grew up in the town of Mascouche, near Montreal. As a child, he played baseball and ice hockey at Montreal&#x27;s Polyvalente Édouard-Montpetit High School, the same high school Russell Martin attended.

His Little League teams were coached by his father, Richard. He eventually became a star with Canada&#x27;s Junior World Championship teams. He was a fan of the Montreal Expos and Montreal Canadiens throughout his childhood.

==College career==
Gagné attended Seminole Junior College in Seminole, Oklahoma. At first, Gagné knew very little English; he became proficient in English by watching American TV while in college, mainly the sitcom &quot;Kenan and Kel&quot;. He eventually became the star pitcher for Seminole&#x27;s baseball team.

==Professional career==
===Draft and minor leagues===
He was a 30th-round draft choice (845th overall) of the Chicago White Sox in 1994 MLB draft, but the following year he signed with the Los Angeles Dodgers as an amateur free agent. Gagne then pitched in the minor leagues but missed the entire 1997 season due to Tommy John surgery.

===Los Angeles Dodgers (1999–2006)===
He made his MLB debut on September 7, when he started a game for the Dodgers against the Florida Marlins, working six shutout innings and striking out eight. In his first year in MLB, he appeared in only five games as a starting pitcher, with a 1–1 record and 2.10 ERA. Over his first three seasons, he won eleven games while losing fourteen in 48 games, 38 of them starts.

At the start of the 2002 season, following the retirement of Dodgers closer Jeff Shaw, he was converted from a starting pitcher to a relief pitcher. He picked up his first career save on April 7 against the Colorado Rockies and soon became the National League&#x27;s leading reliever. He saved 10 consecutive games before he suffered his first blown save on May 7 against the Atlanta Braves. He was elected to his first All-Star Game that year, becoming the second player from Quebec to be named an All-Star (the first being Claude Raymond). In the All-Star Game he served up a two-run homer to Alfonso Soriano in the fifth, allowing the AL to cut the NL lead to 4–2. Overall, he earned 52 saves for the season.

In 2003, as a closer, Gagné converted all 55 save opportunities en route to becoming both the first pitcher to record 50 saves in more than one season and also the fastest pitcher to ever reach the 100-save plateau. His 55 saves in 2003 also equaled the National League record set the previous season by John Smoltz. Between August 26, 2002, and July 5, 2004, he converted 84 consecutive save chances, a major league record. More than half (55%) of the batters he retired during the 2003 season came by strikeout.

When Gagné entered a game at Dodger Stadium, usually in the eighth or ninth inning with the Dodgers in the lead, the words &quot;Game Over&quot; would flash across the scoreboard, and the PA system would play the song &quot;Welcome to the Jungle&quot; by Guns N&#x27; Roses.

In addition to his 55 saves, Gagné finished the 2003 season with a 1.20 earned run average and had 137 strikeouts and 20 walks in innings pitched. This translated into 1.66 strikeouts per inning pitched. For his performance, he won the Rolaids Relief Man of the Year Award and became the first relief pitcher in 11 years to win the Cy Young Award. He and Ferguson Jenkins are the only two Canadian pitchers to win the most prestigious pitching award in baseball. He is the only pitcher to win the award while having a losing season (his record was 2–3). As a result, in the off-season, during contract arbitration he asked for a 14-fold raise from $550,000 to $8 million but settled for $5 million.

His streak finally ended at 84 saves on July 5, 2004, against the Arizona Diamondbacks. Ten days later, Gagné collected his 130th save as a Dodger in a 5–2 win over the Diamondbacks at Bank One Ballpark in Phoenix, Arizona, surpassing Jeff Shaw for the most career saves in team history. Gagné threw three shutout innings during his first appearance in the playoffs that year, but the Dodgers lost the division series 3–1 to the St. Louis Cardinals. Going into the 2007 season, Gagné had converted 161 saves out of 168 save opportunities for a conversion rate of 95.8%.

===Injuries===
Before the start of the 2005 season, Gagné and the Dodgers agreed to a two-year, $19 million contract. He sustained several injuries early that year. Although he was still an effective pitcher, 2.70 ERA and 8 for 8 in save opportunities, Gagné was only able to appear in 14 games that season. On June 21, 2005, it was announced that Gagné would undergo season-ending Tommy John surgery to repair a sprained ligament in his right elbow. Recovery would take a year or more; furthermore, a return to major league pitching after a &quot;second&quot; Tommy John operation (Gagné&#x27;s first was in 1997) is nearly unheard of, having since been achieved by another Dodger reliever, the Taiwanese left-hander Hong-Chih Kuo. However, as surgeons began to operate, they discovered instead a nerve entrapped by scar tissue and were able to release it with a less invasive procedure. Gagné was still unable to play for the remainder of the 2005 season.

Gagné expressed hope that an accelerated recovery would allow him to pitch for Canada in the World Baseball Classic in March 2006, but he eventually decided that it was not worth the risk, and to focus on preparing to pitch in the regular season.
After some encouraging outings in early spring training, pain in Gagné&#x27;s pitching elbow forced him to undergo a second surgery, this time to remove entirely the nerve that doctors had previously attempted to stabilize. More recovery time ensued, but Gagné finally pitched in his first regular-season game of 2006 on June 3. He made two appearances for the Dodgers, pitching two scoreless innings and earning one save, but pain from the nerve in his elbow recurred, and he returned to the disabled list on June 12. A further (and apparently unrelated) setback occurred on July 4, when Gagné awoke with intense pain in his back. An examination revealed two herniated discs, and Gagné underwent season-ending back surgery on July 8.

===Texas Rangers (2007)===

The Dodgers declined to extend Gagné&#x27;s $12 million contract after the season, making him a free agent. On December 12, 2006, Gagné signed a one-year deal with the Texas Rangers worth $6 million, with a possible $5 million in performance bonuses. Gagné had a poor spring training, allowing five earned runs in only three innings of work. For the third consecutive year, Gagné was placed on the disabled list to start the season to let him recover from his injuries. Gagné started to make his recovery by tossing in three minor league games, two of them on consecutive days, allowing a home run and having one loss. In his last minor league game, Gagné retired all three of the batters he faced, and he was activated on April 13.

In his first week back, Gagné pitched three innings, earning one save. But in the middle of his second save situation, Gagné left the game after complaining of leg pain. He said that it would take about a week to recover from the injury, but the Rangers, not taking the risk, placed Gagné on the disabled list with a hip injury. He was reactivated on May 8 and returned to the closer role. During his time with Texas, he was 2–0 with 16 saves and an ERA of 2.16; opposing hitters batted only .192 against him.

===Boston Red Sox (2007)===

On July 31, 2007, Gagné was traded to the Boston Red Sox for pitcher Kason Gabbard and minor league outfielders David Murphy and Engel Beltré. Gagné was expected to serve as a setup man for closer Jonathan Papelbon. Theo Epstein was quoted as saying &quot;I think the bullpen is already a strength of the club, but acquiring a pitcher the caliber of Éric Gagné only makes it stronger and helps give us what we hope will be a truly dominant bullpen for the remainder of the year.&quot;

However, Gagné struggled in his new role with the Red Sox. In his first 15 appearances, Gagné allowed 14 earned runs in 14 innings (a 9.00 ERA) with three blown saves and an opponent batting average of over .350.

Gagné seemed to improve down the stretch and was eventually added to the playoff roster. In the playoffs, he was most often used in games in which the Red Sox were winning by a wide margin, including his only World Series appearance in which he pitched a perfect ninth inning in a 13–1 Game 1 victory. The only exception to this was his appearance in Game 2 of the American League Championship Series against the Cleveland Indians. Brought into a tie game in the top of the 11th inning, Gagné took the loss after allowing the first two runs of a 7-run 11th inning.

In Boston, Gagné wore the number 83, as starting pitcher Curt Schilling already wore Gagné&#x27;s usual number 38.
===Milwaukee Brewers (2008)===

On December 9, 2007, Gagné reached a preliminary agreement with the Milwaukee Brewers. On December 10, he inked the one-year deal to become their new closer. The one-year deal had a base salary of $10 million, with incentives worth up to an extra $1 million. Gagné went back to wearing the number 38 after wearing 83 in Boston.

On May 11, Brewers manager Ned Yost announced Gagné would be removed from the closer&#x27;s role for a while after three blown saves in six attempts. After a few days, Gagné indicated he was ready to return to his role as closer, and a couple of days later, got his 10th save. However, Gagné continued to struggle as the team&#x27;s closer and ultimately became the set-up man after losing his closer job to the veteran Salomón Torres before hitting the disabled list with a rotator cuff injury. After Gagné&#x27;s return, his struggles continued out of the bullpen, however, and he eventually lost his set-up job to Guillermo Mota. He finished the season as a middle relief pitcher, a role in which he still struggled.

Gagné finished 2008 with his worst full season in the major leagues: 10 saves in 17 opportunities, an ERA of 5.41, and 38 strikeouts in 46 innings. He did not convert a save after losing the closer job to Torres.

Gagné became a free agent following the 2008 season. He re-signed with the Brewers on a minor league deal. He was released midway through spring training in part due to a shoulder injury.

===Québec Capitales===
On May 26, 2009, Gagné announced he had signed with the Quebec Capitales of the independent Can-Am League as a starting pitcher/coach. Gagné began playing with the team on June 9, 2009. He had been highly praised by Capitales manager Michel Laplante for his hard work and mentorship of other pitchers and hitters on the team. Gagné helped the team win the League Championship in September 2009. On July 26, 2009, in a game versus the New Jersey Jackals, he recorded 6 no-hit innings in a 7-inning game. He would surrender two straight hits. However, the team would end the game on a triple play. In 17 starts 102.2 innings he went 6-6 with a 4.65 ERA with 64 strikeouts throwing 2 complete games and 1 shutout.

===Attempted comeback with the Los Angeles Dodgers===
On February 18, 2010, Gagné agreed to a minor league contract with the Los Angeles Dodgers with an invite to spring training. Dodgers reliever Ramón Troncoso, remembering Gagné&#x27;s mentorship of young pitchers such as himself during Gagné&#x27;s earlier stint with the Dodgers, &quot;had no problem&quot; releasing to Gagné his old uniform number 38. Gagné made three Spring training appearances with the Dodgers, allowing six runs on eight hits in innings, for a 20.25 ERA. On March 15, he was reassigned to minor league camp, acknowledging that he needed more work to bring his game back to the Major League level. After appearing in just one minor league intrasquad game after his demotion, on March 21, Gagné asked for and was granted his release from the Dodgers, with the hope that he could find another opportunity with another team. However, he announced his retirement on April 18, 2010.

===Trois-Rivières Aigles and Ottawa Champions===
On August 28, 2015, six years after his last presence in professional baseball, Gagné participated in a game with the Trois-Rivières Aigles (of which is a co-owner) of the independent Can-Am League as a starting pitcher. Gagné recorded 2 strikeouts in innings, allowing only 1 run and two hits but gave up 5 walks to the opposite team, the Quebec Capitales, in a 5–3 win for the Aigles.

On September 5, 2016, Gagné pitched for the Ottawa Champions of the Can-Am League, attracting nearly 8,000 fans.

===2017 World Baseball Classic===
On January 14, 2017, it was reported that Gagne, along with retired pitcher Ryan Dempster, would be joining the Team Canada pitching staff for the 2017 World Baseball Classic.

===Second comeback attempt===
Before the start of the 2017 season, Gagne announced that he was pondering a return to MLB. After working out with the Dodgers during spring training and pitching in the WBC, he signed a contract with the independent Long Island Ducks of the Atlantic League of Professional Baseball. He retired again on May 21, 2017. In 5 games 3.2 innings of relief he struggled immensely going 0-2 with a 12.27 ERA with 5 strikeouts.

==Coaching career==
===Coach for France===
Gagné, who is Canadian and whose native language is French, served as the pitching coach for the France national baseball team during the 2013 World Baseball Classic qualifiers in September 2012. France failed to win a game and did not qualify for the main tournament.

In the fall of 2013, Gagné was named the head coach of the French national baseball team. The team finished in sixth place in the 2014 European Championships under Gagne. France competed in the 2016 World Baseball Classic Qualifiers in Panama.

===Texas Rangers===
Gagné rejoined the Texas Rangers organization as a coach in 2018, serving as the pitching coach of the Arizona League Rangers of the rookie-level Arizona League. In 2019, Gagné was promoted to bullpen coach of the Nashville Sounds of the Triple-A Pacific Coast League. Gagné was released by the Rangers organization following the 2019 season.

==Use of HGH==
On December 13, 2007, Gagné was listed in the Mitchell Report — former Senator George Mitchell&#x27;s report on the use of performance-enhancing drugs in baseball. Gagné was identified as a user of HGH (human growth hormone). Allegedly, Gagné received the drugs from steroids dealer Kirk Radomski. At first, Radomski said that Gagné obtained them from Dodgers teammate Paul Lo Duca, but then Radomski said in the report that he mailed two shipments of HGH directly to Gagné in 2004. Receipts of FedEx and USPS shipments indicate that Radomski received at least one payment from Gagné and two from Dodgers teammate Lo Duca on behalf of Gagné. Gagné declined to meet with Senator Mitchell to respond to the charges before the report was released.

In a 2009 interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Gagné expressed remorse not only for what he had done but also for the fact that he could not speak openly about it, likely (according to the &quot;Times&quot;) due to reluctance to implicate others.
Gagné acknowledged that he has been looked to as a role model and called himself an example of what one should not do. On the other hand, when asked whether he had given an honest performance to Dodgers fans, he maintained that he had always worked hard to do so.

In a February 2010 interview with the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, Gagné admitted that he had used HGH, saying that it was to recover from a knee injury.

==Pitching style==
Gagné had an assortment of pitches he used as a reliever but his most commonly used were a four-seam fastball in the mid-to-upper 90s and a Vulcan changeup in the mid-80s. Gagné also featured a two-seam fastball, a slow curveball, and a rarely used slider.

Although he was also praised for his &quot;Bugs Bunny curveball,&quot; Gagné&#x27;s changeup was considered his best pitch. Sportswriter Dan Habib wrote:
Most closers depend on one pitch that becomes synonymous with their success: Trevor Hoffman&#x27;s changeup, Mariano Rivera&#x27;s cut fastball. Gagné thrives on the dizzying oscillation between his changeup and his fastball. They have the same release point and the same arm speed. The fastball is straight gas ... but the changeup is a devious thing, a bowling ball rolled off a picnic table. It travels some 10 mph slower than his fastball, anywhere from 83 to 88 mph, and like a splitter it breaks late and sharp.

Gagné used this combination of pitches to rack up strikeouts at a very high rate. In his Cy Young-winning season of 2003, he had 100 more strikeouts (137) than hits he allowed (37). This produced a strikeout-to-hit ratio of 3.7, a single-season record for relief pitchers with 50 innings. He also has the highest percentage of swinging strikes as a percent of his total pitches (18.5%) among all pitchers since the 2002 season. He also owns the highest percentage of swinging strikes on pitches inside the strike zone.

Gagné exhibited an emotional presence on the mound: &quot;I like to show my emotion, be real aggressive, and give everything I&#x27;ve got for one-half inning.&quot;

==Personal life==

Gagné and his ex-wife Valerie (née Hervieux) have four children — two daughters and two sons. His father&#x27;s cousin, Paul Gagné, played several seasons in the NHL.

On July 31, 2020, Gagné was involved in multiple hit-and-run accidents in Terrebonne, Quebec. Police reportedly apprehended him after he fled the scene.

<text>The Asclepiadoideae are a subfamily of plants in the family Apocynaceae. Formerly, it was treated as a separate family under the name Asclepiadaceae, e.g. by APG II, and known as the milkweed family.

They form a group of perennial herbs, twining shrubs, lianas or rarely trees but notably also contain a significant number of leafless stem succulents. The name comes from the type genus &quot;Asclepias&quot; (milkweeds).

There are 348 genera, with about 2,900 species. They are mainly located in the tropics to subtropics, especially in Africa and South America.

The florally-advanced tribe Stapelieae within this family contains several relatively familiar stem succulent genera, such as &quot;Orbea&quot;, &quot;Huernia, Stapelia&quot; and &quot;Hoodia&quot;. They are remarkable for the complex mechanisms which they have developed for pollination, independently parallel to the unrelated Orchidaceae, such as the grouping of their pollen into pollinia. The &quot;fragrance&quot; (or odor) of the flowers, often called &quot;carrion flowers&quot;, attracts flies, the chief pollinators for these plants. Additionally, the color, appearance and texture of the flowers often is thought to resemble decaying flesh or raw meat to further entice pollination by flies.

Many new hybrids have been formed due to the unique fertilization method of the flowers.

==Taxonomy==
Gilbert Thomas Burnett in 1835 is considered to be the first botanist to recognize a primary division of the family Apocynaceae using the name Asclepiadeae, an ending now used for tribes rather than subfamilies. In 2014, Endress, Liede-Schumann and Meve recognised five tribes within the subfamily. A molecular phylogenetic study in 2019 confirmed the distinctness of the five tribes, which were related as shown in the following cladogram:

=== Tribes and genera ===
The assignment of genera to tribes is based on Endress, Liede-Schumann and Meve (2014), with synonyms from Plants of the World Online .

In 2004, Kahn won the Turing Award with Vint Cerf for their work on TCP/IP.

==Early life and education==
Robert Elliot Kahn was born in December 1938 in New York to parents Beatrice Pauline (née Tashker) and Lawrence Kahn in an Ashkenazi Jewish family. Through his father, he is related to futurist Herman Kahn. After receiving a B.E.E. degree in electrical engineering from the City College of New York in 1960, Kahn went on to Princeton University where he earned a M.A. in 1962 and Ph.D. in 1964, both in electrical engineering. At Princeton, he was advised by Bede Liu and completed a doctoral dissertation titled &quot;Some problems in the sampling and modulation of signals.&quot; 

== Career ==
He first worked at Bolt Beranek and Newman Inc., where he was the principal designer of the ARPANET. In the fall of 1972, he demonstrated the ARPANET by connecting 20 different computers at the International Conference on Computer Communications (ICCC), &quot;the watershed event that made people suddenly realize that packet switching was a real technology.&quot; 

In 1972, he joined the Information Processing Techniques Office (IPTO) within DARPA. He then helped develop the TCP/IP protocols for connecting diverse computer networks. After he became director of IPTO, he started the United States government&#x27;s billion dollar Strategic Computing Initiative, the largest computer research and development program ever undertaken by the U.S. federal government.

After thirteen years with DARPA, Kahn left to found the Corporation for National Research Initiatives (CNRI) in 1986, and remains its chairman, CEO and president.

==The Internet==
While working on the SATNET satellite packet network project, he came up with the initial ideas for what later became the Transmission Control Protocol (TCP), which was intended as a replacement for an earlier network protocol, NCP, used in the ARPANET. TCP played a major role in forming the basis of internetworking, which would allow computers and networks all over the world to communicate with each other, regardless of what hardware or software the computers on each network used. To reach this goal, TCP was designed to have the following features:
* Small sub-sections of the whole network would be able to talk to each other through a specialized computer that only forwarded packets (first called a gateway, and now called a router).
* No portion of the network would be the single point of failure, or would be able to control the whole network.
* Each piece of information sent through the network would be given a sequence number, to ensure that they were dealt with in the right order at the destination computer, and to detect the loss of any of them.
* A computer which sent information to another computer would know that it was successfully received when the destination computer sent back a special packet, called an &quot;acknowledgement&quot; (ACK), for that particular piece of information.
* If information sent from one computer to another was lost, the information would be &quot;retransmitted&quot;, after the loss was detected by a &quot;timeout&quot;, which would recognize that the expected acknowledgement had not been received.
* Each piece of information sent through the network would be accompanied by a checksum, calculated by the original sender, and checked by the ultimate receiver, to ensure that it was not damaged in any way en route.
Vint Cerf joined him on the project in the spring of 1973, and together they completed an early version of TCP. Later, the protocol was separated into two separate layers: host-to-host communication would be handled by TCP, with Internet Protocol (IP) handling internetwork communication. The two together are usually referred to as TCP/IP, and form part of the basis for the modern Internet.

In 1992 he co-founded with Vint Cerf the Internet Society, to provide leadership in Internet related standards, education, and policy.

==Awards==
In 1981, Bob Kahn was elevated to the grade of IEEE fellow for original work in packet switching mobile radio telecommunications technology. He was elected as a member to the National Academy of Engineering in 1987 for research contributions in computer networks and packet switching, and for creative management contributions to research efforts in computers and communications. He was elected a Founding Fellow of Association for the Advancement of Artificial Intelligence in 1990.

He was awarded the SIGCOMM Award in 1993 for &quot;visionary technical contributions and leadership in the development of information systems technology&quot;, and shared the 2004 Turing Award with Vint Cerf, for &quot;pioneering work on internetworking, including .. the Internet&#x27;s basic communications protocols .. and for inspired leadership in networking.&quot;
He is a recipient of the AFIPS Harry Goode Memorial Award, the Marconi Award, the ACM SIGCOMM Award, the President&#x27;s Award from ACM, the IEEE Koji Kobayashi Computer and Communications Award, the IEEE Alexander Graham Bell Medal, the IEEE Third Millennium Medal, the ACM Software Systems Award, the Computerworld/Smithsonian Award, the ASIS Special Award and the Public Service Award from the Computing Research Board. He has twice received the Secretary of Defense Civilian Service Award.

He was awarded an honorary degree by the University of Pavia in 1998.

He was awarded the Stibitz-Wilson Award from the American Computer &amp; Robotics Museum in 1999 for Pioneering the Internet through Major Design and Development Contributor to the Original ARPANET NCP Protocol and Co-Inventor of the Internet&#x27;s TCP/IP Protocol.

He is a recipient of the 1997 National Medal of Technology, the 2001 Charles Stark Draper Prize from the National Academy of Engineering, the 2002 Prince of Asturias Award, and the 2004 A. M. Turing Award from the Association for Computing Machinery. Kahn received the 2003 Digital ID World award for the Digital Object Architecture as a significant contribution (technology, policy or social) to the digital identity industry.

In 2005 he was awarded the Townsend Harris Medal from the Alumni Association of the City College of New York, the Presidential Medal of Freedom, and the C &amp; C Prize in Tokyo, Japan.

He was inducted into the National Inventors Hall of Fame in May 2006.

He was inducted as a Fellow of the Computer History Museum in 2006 &quot;for pioneering technical contributions to internetworking and for leadership in the application of networks to scientific research.&quot;

He was awarded the 2008 Japan Prize for his work in &quot;Information Communication Theory and Technology&quot; (together with Vinton Cerf).

*In 2001, he was inducted as a Fellow of the Association for Computing Machinery.
*Robert Kahn and Vinton Cerf were each inducted as an Honorary Fellow of the Society for Technical Communication (STC) in May 2006.
The duo were also awarded with the Harold Pender Award, the highest honor awarded by the University of Pennsylvania School Engineering and Applied Sciences, in February 2010.

He has also served on the board of directors for Qualcomm.

In 2012, Kahn was inducted into the Internet Hall of Fame by the Internet Society.

In 2013, Kahn was one of five Internet and Web pioneers awarded the inaugural Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering.

Kahn received the 2024 IEEE Medal of Honor for &quot;pioneering technical and leadership contributions in packet communication technologies and foundations of the Internet.&quot;

<text>General elections were held in Guatemala on 9 November 2003, with a second round of the presidential election held on 28 December. Óscar Berger won the presidential election, representing the Grand National Alliance, a coalition of alliance of the Patriotic Party, the Reform Movement and the National Solidarity Party. The Alliance were also victorious in the Congressional elections, winning 47 of the 158 seats. Voter turnout was 57.9% in the Congressional elections, 58.9% in the first round of the presidential elections and 46.8% in the second.

==Presidential election==
The ruling Republican Front of Guatemala (FRG) nominated former military ruler Efraín Ríos Montt to succeed outgoing president Alfonso Portillo Cabrera. A constitutional ban on former coup leaders (Ríos Montt during 1982–83) led to strong conflict inside the country, including the besiegement of Guatemala for a day: 24 July 2003, known as &quot;jueves negro&quot; (&quot;Black Thursday&quot;). In the first round of voting, Ríos Montt came third behind the centrist mayor of Guatemala City, Óscar Berger, and the more left-wing candidate Álvaro Colom.

<doc id="365811" wikidata="Q3459695" url="?curid=365811" title="Banach–Mazur game">
<text>In general topology, set theory and game theory, a [[Stefan Banach|Banach]]–[[Stanisław Mazur|Mazur]] game is a topological game played by two players, trying to pin down elements in a set (space). The concept of a Banach–Mazur game is closely related to the concept of Baire spaces. This game was the first infinite positional game of perfect information to be studied. It was introduced by Stanisław Mazur as problem 43 in the Scottish book, and Mazur&#x27;s questions about it were answered by Banach.

==Definition==
Let formula_1 be a non-empty topological space, formula_2 a fixed subset of formula_1 and formula_4 a family of subsets of formula_1 that have the following properties:

* Each member of formula_4 has non-empty interior.
* Each non-empty open subset of formula_1 contains a member of formula_4.

Players, formula_9 and formula_10 alternately choose elements from formula_4 to form a sequence formula_12

formula_9 wins if and only if

:formula_14
Otherwise, formula_10 wins.
This is called a general Banach–Mazur game and denoted by formula_16

==Properties==
* formula_10 has a winning strategy if and only if formula_2 is of the &quot;first category&quot; in formula_1 (a set is of the first category or meagre if it is the countable union of nowhere-dense sets).
* If formula_1 is a complete metric space, formula_9 has a winning strategy if and only if formula_2 is comeager in some non-empty open subset of formula_23
* If formula_2 has the Baire property in formula_1, then formula_26 is determined.
* The siftable and strongly-siftable spaces introduced by Choquet can be defined in terms of stationary strategies in suitable modifications of the game. Let formula_27 denote a modification of formula_26 where formula_29 is the family of all non-empty open sets in formula_2 and formula_10 wins a play formula_32 if and only if
::formula_33
:Then formula_2 is siftable if and only if formula_10 has a stationary winning strategy in formula_36

* A Markov winning strategy for formula_10 in formula_27 can be reduced to a stationary winning strategy. Furthermore, if formula_10 has a winning strategy in formula_27, then formula_10 has a winning strategy depending only on two preceding moves. It is still an unsettled question whether a winning strategy for formula_10 can be reduced to a winning strategy that depends only on the last two moves of formula_9.
* formula_2 is called &quot;weakly&quot; formula_45-&quot;favorable&quot; if formula_10 has a winning strategy in formula_27. Then, formula_2 is a Baire space if and only if formula_9 has no winning strategy in formula_27. It follows that each weakly formula_45-favorable space is a Baire space.

Many other modifications and specializations of the basic game have been proposed: for a thorough account of these, refer to [1987].

The most common special case arises when formula_52 and formula_4 consist of all closed intervals in the unit interval. Then formula_9 wins if and only if formula_55 and formula_10 wins if and only if formula_57. This game is denoted by formula_58

==A simple proof: winning strategies==
It is natural to ask for what sets formula_2 does formula_10 have a winning strategy in formula_61. Clearly, if formula_2 is empty, formula_10 has a winning strategy, therefore the question can be informally rephrased as how &quot;small&quot; (respectively, &quot;big&quot;) does formula_2 (respectively, the complement of formula_2 in formula_1) have to be to ensure that formula_10 has a winning strategy. The following result gives a flavor of how the proofs used to derive the properties in the previous section work:

:Proposition. formula_10 has a winning strategy in formula_61 if formula_2 is countable, formula_1 is T1, and formula_1 has no isolated points.

:Proof. Index the elements of &quot;X&quot; as a sequence: formula_73 Suppose formula_9 has chosen formula_75 if formula_76 is the non-empty interior of formula_77 then formula_78 is a non-empty open set in formula_79 so formula_10 can choose formula_81 Then formula_9 chooses formula_83 and, in a similar fashion, formula_10 can choose formula_85 that excludes formula_86. Continuing in this way, each point formula_87 will be excluded by the set formula_88 so that the intersection of all formula_89 will not intersect formula_2.

The assumptions on formula_1 are key to the proof: for instance, if formula_92 is equipped with the discrete topology and formula_4 consists of all non-empty subsets of formula_1, then formula_10 has no winning strategy if formula_96 (as a matter of fact, her opponent has a winning strategy). Similar effects happen if formula_1 is equipped with indiscrete topology and formula_98

A stronger result relates formula_2 to first-order sets.

:Proposition. formula_10 has a winning strategy in formula_61 if and only if formula_2 is meagre.

This does not imply that formula_9 has a winning strategy if formula_2 is not meagre. In fact, if formula_1 is a complete metric space, then formula_9 has a winning strategy if and only if there is some formula_107 such that formula_108 is a comeagre subset of formula_109 It may be the case that neither player has a winning strategy: let formula_1 be the unit interval and formula_4 be the family of closed intervals in the unit interval. The game is determined if the target set has the property of Baire, i.e. if it differs from an open set by a meagre set (but the converse is not true). Assuming the axiom of choice, there are subsets of the unit interval for which the Banach–Mazur game is not determined.

<text>The 2010 Commonwealth Games, officially known as the XIX Commonwealth Games and commonly known as Delhi 2010, were an international multi-sport event for the members of the Commonwealth that was held in Delhi, India, from 3 to 14 October 2010. A total of 4352 athletes from 71 Commonwealth nations and dependencies competed in 21 sports and 272 events, making it the largest Commonwealth Games to date. It was also the largest international multi-sport event to be staged in Delhi and India, eclipsing the Asian Games in 1951 and 1982. The opening and closing ceremonies were held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the main stadium of the event.

It was the first time that the Commonwealth Games were held in India and the second time they were held in Asia after Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia in 1998. It was also the first time a Commonwealth republic hosted the games, second in a country not presently headed by the British monarch since Malaysia in 1998. The official mascot of the Games was &quot;Shera&quot; and the official song of the Games, &quot;Jiyo Utho Badho Jeeto&quot;, was composed by Academy and Grammy awardee Indian recording artist A.R. Rahman.

Preparation for the Games received widespread international media attention, with criticism being levelled against the organisers for the slow pace of work, as well as issues related to security and hygiene. In spite of threats of boycotts and athlete withdrawals however, all member nations of the Commonwealth of Nations participated in the event, with the exceptions of Fiji, which is suspended from the Commonwealth, and Tokelau, which didn&#x27;t send a team.

The internationally acclaimed opening ceremony improved the image of the Games, and dispelled negative notions surrounding them, with many observers remarking that they began on an apprehensive note, but were an exceptional experience with a largely positive ending. The President of the International Olympic Committee, Jacques Rogge, said that India had made a good foundation for a future Olympics bid, which was reiterated by the Australian Minister of Sports. Commonwealth games Federation chief Mike Fennell stated that &quot;Delhi delivered a fantastic Games&quot;. Some observers accused sections of the media of bias, unfair expectations, and negative reporting.

The final medal tally was led by Australia with 74 golds and 177 most medals overall. The host nation India achieved its best performance ever at the Commonwealth Games, finishing second overall by winning 38 golds and 101 total medals.

==Host selection==
Delhi was selected as the host city of the 2010 Commonwealth Games on 14 November 2003 during the CGF General Assembly in Montego Bay, Jamaica, defeating bid from Hamilton, Ontario, Canada. India&#x27;s bid motto was &quot;New Frontiers and Friendships&quot;.

India shifted the balance in its favour in the second round of voting with a promise that it would provide US$100,000 to each participating country, along with air tickets, boarding, lodging and transport. The successful 2003 Afro-Asian Games held in Hyderabad was also seen as having shown that India has the resources, infrastructure and technical know-how to stage a big sporting event. Meanwhile, Hamilton struggled with the notion a country would not be awarded two major multi-sport events in the same year, after Vancouver was awarded the 2010 Winter Olympics earlier in the year.

Delhi bid for the 1990 and 1994 Commonwealth Games but lost to Auckland and Victoria respectively. The Hamilton bid was Canada&#x27;s attempt to hold the games for the fifth time.
== Development and preparation ==

===Organising committee===
The organisation of 2010 Commonwealth Games was beset by delays: in January 2010, the Indian Olympic Association vice-chairman Raja Randhir Singh expressed concern that Delhi was not up to speed in forming and organising its games committee and, following a 2009 Indian Government report showing two-thirds of venues were behind schedule, Commonwealth Games Federation president Mike Fennell stated that the slow progress of preparations represented a serious risk to the event. Singh also called for a revamp of the games&#x27; organising committees: Jarnail Singh, a former Secretary of the Government of India, was appointed as the chief executive officer and Indian Olympic Association president Suresh Kalmadi was appointed as head of the committee. In spite of delays and the corruption cases levied on the organisers, commentators stated that they were confident that India will successfully host the games and do so on time.

At the launch of the Queen&#x27;s Baton Relay in October 2009, the Business Club of India (BCI) was formed through the partnership of the organising committee, the Confederation of Indian Industry and the Federation of Indian Chambers of Commerce and Industry. The BCI was formed to both market the Games and promote Indian business interests internationally.

===Venues===

Events took place at 12 competition venues. A total of 20 training venues were used in the Games. Of these 20, one was used for archery; three for aquatics; two for lawn bowls; two for netball; eight for rugby sevens, including seven venues within Delhi University; two for shooting; one for squash; two for table tennis; one for weightlifting, three for wrestling and two for tennis.

A total of five venues were newly constructed for the event; the Dr. Karni Singh Shooting Range, the Siri Fort Sports Complex, the Thyagaraj Sports Complex, the Yamuna Sports Complex as well as a rugby sevens facility in Delhi University Stadium. This does not include the two venues—the Indira Gandhi Sports Complex and Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium—that received major renovations or an uplift. All other venues had existed prior to the event. The largest venue was the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, with a capacity of 60,000, was the main venue of the event, hosting both the opening and the closing ceremonies. On the other hand, the Central Reserve Police Force (CRPF) Shooting Range located in Kadarpur had the smallest seating capacity, at 345.

There were three main non-competition venues in the event, besides the Commonwealth Games Village; namely the Delhi 2010 Commonwealth Games Organising Committee Headquarters, the Main Media Centre, and the Games Family Hotel, Hotel Ashok.

=== Commonwealth Games Village ===
The Commonwealth Games Village provided accommodation and training for athletes of the Games, and was opened from 23 September to 18 October 2010. It is located along the east bank of the River Yamuna, in proximity to competition and training venues as well as city landmarks, and is spread over an area of . Comprising five main zones—the Residential Zone, the International Zone, the Training Area, the Main Dining and the Operational Zone—the Games Village, which was a non-smoking zone, was universally accessible particularly to accommodate para-sport athletes. Free accommodation for all athletes at the Games Village, as well as free transport and other benefits, such as a free trip to the famed Taj Mahal and a reserved lane for participants on selected highways were provided. The Games Village accommodated over 8,000 athletes and officials for the Games.

===Budget===
The initial total budget estimated by the Indian Olympic Association in 2003 for hosting the Games was . In 2010, however, the official total budget soon escalated to an estimated , a figure which excluded non-sports-related infrastructure development. Business Today magazine estimated that the Games cost . The 2010 Commonwealth Games was reportedly the most expensive Commonwealth Games ever. 

===Transport===

A four-lane flyway, stretch from Lodi Road to trans-Yamuna, linking the Games Village to the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium was constructed which reduced the travelling time between the village and the Stadium to six minutes.

In response to concerns over the large number of trains that pass by the Delhi metropolitan region daily, construction of road under-bridges and over-bridges along railway lines have been completed. To expand road infrastructure, flyovers, cloverleaf flyovers, and bridges were built to improve links for the Games and city in general. Road-widening projects were finished with an emphasis being placed on expanding national highways. To improve traffic flow on existing roads, plans were made to make both the inner and outer Ring roads signal free.

To support its commitment to mass transport, nine corridors have been identified and were constructed as High Capacity Bus Systems (for example, one from Ambedkar Nagar to Red Fort). Six of these corridors were expected to be operational in 2010. Additionally, The Delhi Metro was expanded to accommodate more people and boost the use of public transport during the event. The metro has extended to Gurgaon and the Noida area. For this large increase in the size of the network, Delhi Metro had deployed 14 tunnel boring machines. Radio Frequency Identification (RFID) was used to tag vehicles in venue parking lots to help organise mass parking and increase security.

Indira Gandhi International Airport was modernised, expanded, and upgraded. Costing nearly $1.95 billion, Terminal 3 has increased airport passenger capacity to more than 37 million passengers a year by 2010. A new runway has been constructed, allowing for more than 75 flights an hour. At more than 4400 metres long, it is one of Asia&#x27;s longest. The airport has been connected to the city via a six-lane expressway (Delhi–Gurgaon Expressway) and the $580 million Delhi Airport Metro Express line.

===Green Games===
The organisers signed a Memorandum of Understanding (MoU) with the United Nations Environment Programme to show the intention to host a &quot;sustainable games&quot; and to take the environment into consideration when constructing and renovating venues. Thyagaraj Stadium is intended to be a key example of environmentally considered construction.

In opposition to this intention, a number of environmental controversies arose and the adverse ecological impact of various aspects of the games have been protested by city residents. City residents filed a public interest petition to the Supreme Court of India against the felling of &#x27;heritage&#x27; trees in the Siri Fort area to make way for Games facilities. The court appointed architect Charles Correa to assess the impact and he severely criticised the designs on ecological grounds. In spite of this, in April 2009 the Supreme Court allowed the construction on the grounds that &quot;much time had been lost&quot; and &quot;the damage already caused to the environment could not be undone&quot;.

The Commonwealth Games village, located on the flood plains of the Yamuna, has also been the subject of controversies about the flouting of ecological norms. After a prolonged legal battle between city residents and the state, construction was permitted to continue on the basis of an order of the Supreme Court of India in July 2009, which held that the government had satisfied the requirements of &quot;due process of the law&quot; by issuing public notice of its intention to begin construction work in September 1999 (a date four years prior to the acceptance of Delhi&#x27;s bid for the games).

=== Queen&#x27;s baton relay ===
The Queen&#x27;s Baton Relay began when the baton, which contains Elizabeth II&#x27;s message to the athletes, left Buckingham Palace on 29 October 2009. The baton arrived at the 2010 Games opening ceremony on 3 October 2010, after visiting the other 54 nations of the Commonwealth and travelling throughout India, reaching millions of people to join in the celebrations for the Games. The baton arrived in India on 25 June 2010 through the Wagah Border crossing from Pakistan.

The baton was designed by Michael Foley of Foley Designs and a graduate of the National Institute of Design. It is a triangular section of aluminium twisted into a helix shape and then coated with coloured soils collected from all the regions of India. The coloured soils are a first for the styling of a Queen&#x27;s Baton. A jewel-encrusted box was used to house the Queen&#x27;s message, which was laser-engraved onto a miniature 18 carat gold leaf—representative of the ancient Indian &#x27;patras. The Queen&#x27;s baton is ergonomically contoured for ease of use. It is high, wide at the base, and wide at the top and weighs .

The Queen&#x27;s baton has a number of technological features including:

* The ability to capture images and sound
*Global positioning system (GPS) technology so the baton&#x27;s location can be tracked
* Embedded light emitting diodes (LEDs) which will change into the colours of a country&#x27;s flag whilst in that country
* A text messaging capability so that people can send messages of congratulations and encouragement to the baton bearers throughout the relay

===Other preparation===
In preparation for an influx of English-speaking tourists for the Games, the Delhi government implemented a program to teach English, and the necessary skills for serving tourists, to key workers—such as cab drivers, security workers, waiters, porters, and service staff. In the two years prior to the Games 2000 drivers were taught English. In addition to Delhi, the Indian Government plans to expand the program to teach people in local tourist destinations in other parts of India.
To facilitate hassle-free sightseeing in Delhi, Delhi Tourism undertook the launch of India&#x27;s very first Hop on Hop Off bus known as HOHO DELHI, modelled on popular concept of transport facilities in Western countries. The bus, which is equipped with state-of-the-art technologies like digital video screens and GPS systems, also had trained guides who were responsible for giving information about the sites.

To prepare for the energy-usage spike during the games and to end chronic power cuts in Delhi, the government undertook a large power-production initiative to increase power production to 7000 MW (from the previous 4500 MW). To achieve this the government streamlined the power distribution process, directed additional energy to Delhi, and constructed new power plants.

Indian states trained state police forces to handle tourist-related issues and deploy them prior to the Games. A large-scale construction and &quot;beautification&quot; project has resulted in the demolition of hundreds of homes and the displacement of city dwellers—at least 100,000 of New Delhi&#x27;s 160,000 homeless people have removed from shelters, some of which have been demolished. Bamboo screens have been erected around city slums to separate visitors from the sights of the slums, a practice which human rights campaigners have deemed dishonest and immoral.

The Delhi High Court implemented a series of &quot;mobile courts&quot; to be dispatched throughout Delhi to relocate migrant beggars from Delhi streets. The mobile courts would consider each beggar on a case-by-case basis to determine whether the beggar should be sent back to his/her state of residence, or be permitted to remain in government-shelters.

=== Opening ceremony ===
The opening ceremony was held at the Jawaharlal Nehru Stadium, the main stadium of the event, in New Delhi, India. It began at 19:00  (IST) on 3 October. The opening ceremony was directed by Ganapathy Bharat, known commonly as Bharat Bala, an acclaimed Tamil film director, screenwriter and film producer based in Kodambakkam, Chennai. The ceremony featured over 8,000 performers, and lasted for two-and-a-half hours. It is estimated that 3.50 billion (US$77 million) were spent to produce the ceremony.

The ceremony was divided into six separate segments, each showcasing the rich, ancient and diverse cultures of India, including art, traditions, dances, music and colours. It began with a showcase of a variety of drummers from all parts of India, accompanied by seven-year-old tabla player Keshav. The countdown took place on a screen in the stadium, and was accompanied by fireworks. The centerpiece of the ceremony was the helium aerostat, which acted as a giant 360° screen for spectators. The ceremony showcased a fusion of various classical dances from all parts of India, mehendi decorations, sand paintings and yoga. The title song was performed by A R Rahman. Singer Hariharan sang the welcome song for the Games, titled &quot;Swagatam&quot;, with thousands of school children.

The Prince of Wales (now Charles III; representing Elizabeth II as Head of the Commonwealth) and President of India Pratibha Patil officially declared the Games open. Prime Minister Manmohan Singh of the host nation, India, attended the opening ceremony as well. A total of three heads of state from outside India attended the opening ceremony; two from Commonwealth nations and one from a non-Commonwealth nation. The three head of states were Mohamed Nasheed, President of the Maldives, Marcus Stephen, President of Nauru and a multiple Commonwealth gold medallist, and Albert II, Prince of Monaco, representing the International Olympic Committee. As well, Sir Anand Satyanand, the Governor General of New Zealand, attended the ceremony.

=== Closing ceremony ===
The closing ceremony featuring both Indian and Scottish performers. The closing ceremony was not as well received as the opening ceremony. The Commonwealth Games flag was handed over to representatives of Glasgow, Scotland, which hosted the XX Commonwealth Games in 2014. At the closing ceremony, the President of the Commonwealth Games Federation declared that Delhi had hosted a &quot;truly exceptional Games&quot;. A day after the ceremony, Scotland&#x27;s First Minister Alex Salmond stated that

===Participating Commonwealth Games Associations===
There were 71 participating nations at the 2010 Commonwealth Games. As Fiji was suspended from the Commonwealth, it was banned from participating in the Games. Rwanda fielded a team for the games for the first time after becoming a Commonwealth member in 2009. The numbers of athletes from each country is shown in brackets.

Triathlon was excluded from the games as there was no suitable location for the swimming stage. The organisers have also removed basketball, but included archery, tennis and wrestling. Cricket, although in strong demand, did not make a comeback as the Board of Control for Cricket in India were not keen on a Twenty20 tournament, and the organisers did not want a one day tournament.

===Calendar===


=== Official song ===

The official song of the 2010 Commonwealth Games &quot;Jiyo Utho Badho Jeeto&quot; was composed and performed by the Indian musician A. R. Rahman. The song&#x27;s title is based on the slogan of the games, &quot;Come out and play&quot;. The song was written by Mehboob in Hindi with a sprinkling of English words. It was released on 28 August 2010. The music video, directed by Bharath Bala was released on 23 September and featured a shorter version of the song. A. R. Rahman also gave a live concert for the theme song in Gurgaon, Haryana, which was previewed on various news channels. The official video of the song has been released on YouTube. However this song was not much appreciated by the people as it was being compared with 2010 FIFA World Cup South Africa&#x27;s official song Waka Waka (This Time for Africa) of Shakira.

==Concerns and controversies==
Several concerns were raised over the preparations of the Games and these included excessive budget overruns, likelihood of floods in Delhi due to heavy monsoon rains, infrastructural compromise, poor living conditions at the Commonwealth Games Village, delays in construction of the main Games&#x27; venues, the withdrawal of prominent athletes, widespread corruption by officials of the Games&#x27; Organising Committee and possibility of a terrorist attack by militants.

The negative pre-event publicity and heavy security presence played in part in low spectator attendance during the initial events. However the numbers picked up as the Games progressed.

===Formation of investigation committee===
The day after the conclusion of the Games, the Indian Government announced the formation of a special committee to probe the allegations of corruption and mismanagement against the Organising Committee. The probe committee will be led by former Comptroller and Auditor General of India VK Shunglu. This probe will be in addition to the Central Bureau of Investigation, Enforcement Directorate, and Central Vigilance Commission investigations already underway. The Prime Minister of India, Dr Manmohan Singh had promised in mid-August, when reports of the bungling first surfaced, that corrupt officials will be given &quot;severe and exemplary&quot; punishment after the Games. The probe committee is tasked with looking into &quot;all aspects of organising and conducting&quot; the Games, and &quot;to draw lessons from it.&quot; It was given three months to submit its report, but the report was never publicly released. The Indian Sports Ministry has directed the Organising Committee of the 2010 Commonwealth Games (led by Suresh Kalmadi), to not release any staffer from their positions until the probe committee&#x27;s work is finished.

==Legacy==
One of the aims of hosting the Commonwealth Games was to build world-class athletics infrastructure within the country, expose audiences to top-level non-cricket competition and encourage the youth to &quot;Come out and play&quot; (the official theme of the games). Building a sporting culture that looks beyond cricket is seen as an important task for a country which won its first ever individual Olympic gold medal in Beijing 2008, despite having the world&#x27;s second-largest population.

Sebastian Coe, former Olympic gold medalist and chairman of the 2012 Summer Olympics Organising Committee, was at the stadium during the 4 × 400 m women&#x27;s relay and described the audience&#x27;s cheers for the racers as &quot;potentially the moment that could change the course of athletics in Asia, the moment that could inspire thousands of people who&#x27;d never even seen an athletics track before to get involved... To build a truly global capacity in sport, you have to take it round the world – out of your own backyard. That means taking risks and facing challenges, but it has to be done.&quot;

<doc id="365817" wikidata="Q1042074" url="?curid=365817" title="Toniná">
<text>Tonina (or Toniná in Spanish orthography) is a pre-Columbian archaeological site and ruined city of the Maya civilization located in what is now the Mexican state of Chiapas, some 13 km (8.1 mi) east of the town of Ocosingo.

The site is medium to large, with groups of temple-pyramids set on terraces rising some above a plaza, a large court for playing the Mesoamerican ballgame, and over 100 carved monuments, most dating from the 6th century through the 9th centuries AD, during the Classic period. Toniná is distinguished by its well preserved stucco sculptures and particularly by its in-the-round carved monuments, produced to an extent not seen in Mesoamerica since the end of the much earlier Olmec civilization. Toniná possesses one of the largest pyramids in Mexico; at in height, it is taller than the Pyramid of the Sun at Teotihuacan.

Toniná was an aggressive state in the Late Classic, using warfare to develop a powerful kingdom. For much of its history, Toniná was engaged in sporadic warfare with Palenque, its greatest rival and one of the most important polities in the west of the Maya region, although Toniná eventually became the dominant city in the west.

The city is notable for having the last known Long Count date on any Maya monument, marking the end of the Classic Maya period in AD 909.

==Etymology==
Toniná means &quot;house of stone&quot; in the Tzeltal language of the local Maya inhabitants, an alternative interpretation is &quot;the place where stone sculptures are raised to honour time&quot;. However, this is a modern name and the original name was either &quot;Po&quot; or &quot;Popo&quot;, appearing in Classic Maya texts in the title used for the kings of Toniná, &quot;k&#x27;uhul po&#x27; ajaw&quot; (Divine Lord of Po). A Maya rebellion in Colonial times, in 1558, featured a group called the &quot;po&#x27; winikob&quot;&#x27; (People of Po). Early versions of the Toniná emblem glyph bore a doubled &quot;po&quot; glyph and the term &quot;Popo&quot; is also found in Colonial records. Since double sounds were often abbreviated in hieroglyphic texts, &quot;Popo&quot; may represent the original name of the city.

==Location==
Toniná is located at an altitude of above mean sea level in the Chiapas highlands of southern Mexico, some south of the contemporary Maya city of Palenque, Toniná&#x27;s greatest rival throughout its recorded history. Toniná is separated from Palenque by mountainous terrain and the site core is located along an easily defended ascending limestone ridge immediately to the west of a seasonal tributary of the Río Jataté, one of the two rivers forming the Ocosingo Valley.

==Rulers==

Rulers of Toniná recorded in the Maya script on Toniná monuments include:

The last known recorded date at the site is featured on Monument 101 as 15 January 909 CE.

==History==

===Early Classic===
Toniná had a particularly active Early Classic presence, although the Early Classic remains lie entirely buried under later construction. Due to this, early texts are scarce and only offer a glimpse of the early history of the site. An 8th-century text refers to a king ruling in AD 217, although it only mentions his title, not his name.

Ruler 1 is depicted on a couple of Early Classic monuments, the better preserved of which is an altar that dates to 514. A ruler known as Jaguar Bird Peccary is represented on a 6th-century stela, which describes him acceding to the throne in 568.

The first mention of Toniná in a record from a foreign state is from the site of Chinikiha, located to the northeast on the Usumacinta River, the text is from a throne and describes the capture of a person from Toniná in 573.

===Late Classic===
====K&#x27;inich Hix Chapat====
Toniná&#x27;s history comes into focus in the Late Classic, when its historical record is more fully represented by hieroglyphic texts. In 633 K&#x27;inich Hix Chapat is recorded as installing two subordinate lords but little else is known of his reign, although he was probably enthroned in 595. The last mention of K&#x27;inich Hix Chapat is in a monument dated to 665 that appears to be a memorial stone.

====Ruler 2====
Ruler 2 acceded to the throne of Toniná in 668. His rule is marked by warfare and the frequent depiction of bound captives on his monuments. Ruler 2 established the use of in-the-round sculptural style that came to typify the stelae of Toniná. A monument dated to 682 depicts three naked prisoners with their arms bound, one of them is identified as a lord from Annak&#x27;, an as yet unidentified site. His reign may have ended with his defeat and capture by K&#x27;inich Kan Balam II of Palenque in September 687, as described in a glyphic text from Temple 17 in the rival city, an event that probably culminated in his sacrifice.

====K&#x27;inich B&#x27;aaknal Chaak====
K&#x27;inich B&#x27;aaknal Chaak was enthroned in 688, twenty years after Ruler 2, and reigned for twenty-seven years. During his reign he restored Toniná&#x27;s power with a number of military victories over Palenque, and his reign was dominated by the struggle against the rival city for regional power. Ballcourt 1, the larger of Toniná&#x27;s two ballcourts, was dedicated in 699 to celebrate three victories over the city&#x27;s arch-rival. The ballcourt originally had six sculptures of bound captives, all vassals of the enemy Palenque king from the Usumacinta region. The date of the king&#x27;s death is unknown.

====Ruler 4====

Ruler 4 came to power in 708 at a very young age. Three years later, in 711, while Ruler 4 was still a child, Toniná gained an important victory over Palenque. The battle resulted in the capture of Kan Joy Chitam II of Palenque and made Toniná the dominant centre in the lower Usumacinta region. The victory was so complete that it resulted in a ten-year gap in the dynastic history of the defeated city, during which the captured ruler may have been held hostage. Ruler 4 continued in power to celebrate the period endings of 716 and 721. A captive depicted on one of his monuments is identified as being from the distant city of Calakmul, one of the two Maya &quot;superpowers&quot;.

====K&#x27;inich Ich&#x27;aak Chapat====
Ruler 4 was succeeded by K&#x27;inich Ich&#x27;aak Chapat in 723. Around 725 Toniná fought a war against Piedras Negras, a city on the north bank of the Usumacinta River, now in Guatemala. A series of events during his reign were marked on monuments between 726 and 729 and in 730 he rededicated the tomb of his predecessor K&#x27;inich B&#x27;aaknal Chaak. The mother of K&#x27;inich Ich&#x27;aak Chapat is named as Lady Winik Timan K&#x27;awiil and his father may well have been K&#x27;inich B&#x27;aaknal Chaak himself. The reign of K&#x27;inich Ich&#x27;aak Chapat is notable for the absence of the usual sculptures depicting bound war captives, although the reason for this is unknown.

====Later rulers====

Little is known of the next two rulers, Ruler 6 is named as K&#x27;inich Tuun Chapat, he celebrated the period ending of 736 and may have died 762. A damaged text accompanying the image of a bound captive indicates renewed warfare with Palenque during his reign, however the name of the prisoner is lost and it is unclear if it is the actual king of Palenque or merely one of his vassals. 

He was succeeded by Ruler 7, about whom even less is known. Around 764 Toniná defeated Palenque in battle.
Ruler 7 has been identified as the mysterious Lady K&#x27;awil, known from a fragmentary text on an altar disc which records her death in 774.

In 775 a text recorded the death of Lord Wak Chan K&#x27;ak&#x27;, a prince who appears to have been the heir to the throne and who died before he could take power.

Ruler 8 was the last of the successful warrior kings of Toniná. He celebrated a series of events between 789 and 806, including the defeat of Pomoy in 789, and the capture of the ruler Ucha&#x27;an Aj Chih, who appears to have been the vassal of B&#x27;olon K&#x27;awiil of Calakmul. In 799 he rededicated the tomb of Ruler 1. Ruler 8 oversaw an extensive remodelling of the upper levels of the Acropolis. Ruler 8 erected a number of sculptures of bound prisoners of war and adopted the title &quot;aj b&#x27;olon b&#x27;aak&quot;, &quot;He of Many Captives&quot;. However, the lesser extent of Toniná&#x27;s power is evident from its victory over the site of Sak Tz&#x27;i&#x27; (White Dog), an important city in the Lacandon region, an area which had once been dominated by Toniná.

By the time of Ruler 8&#x27;s successor, Uh Chapat, Toniná was clearly in decline. Only a single event, in 837, can be dated to his reign, although a stucco mural depicting captives with garrottes at their throats may belong to his period of rule.

The history of Toniná continued after most other Classic Maya cities had fallen, perhaps aided by the site&#x27;s relative isolation. Ruler 10 is associated with a monument dating to 904 in the Terminal Classic and a monument dating to 909 bears the last known Long Count date although the name of the king has not survived. Ceramic fragments indicate that occupation at the site continued for another century or more.

====Ritual Cremation of Rulers====
Urns containing cremated remains of Mayan rulers discovered in the Temple of the Sun at Toniná, were found to also contain rubber, coal, and roots - materials that make up the rubber balls used in the mesoamerican ball game - leading archeologists to believe that the Mayans of this period in Toniná memorialized their rulers by incorporating their ashes into the ritual game of ball typical of mesoamerican cultures.

===Modern history===
The first published account of the ruins was made by Fray Jacinto Garrido at the end of the 17th century. A number of visitors investigated the ruins of Toniná in the 19th century, the first being an expedition led by Guillaume Dupaix in 1808. John Lloyd Stephens and Frederick Catherwood visited in 1840, and Stephens wrote an extensive description of the site. Eduard Seler and Caecilie Seler-Sachs investigated the monuments at Toniná, publishing their reports at the turn of the 20th century. Karl Sapper visited the site in 1895 and 1896. Frans Blom and Oliver La Farge investigated the site in 1920s for Tulane University, publishing their reports in 1926—1927.

The &quot;French Toniná Project&quot; began excavations in 1972 which continued through 1975, then resumed in 1979 to 1980, under the direction of Pierre Becquelin and Claude Baudez. The National Institute of Anthropology and History of Mexico (INAH, &quot;the Instituto Nacional de Antropologia e Historia&quot;) began their own excavations at Toniná the following year.

The site is accessible for tourism and has a small museum that was inaugurated on 15 July 2000.

==Site description==
The site was built on a platform covering . The principal architecture is located in the acropolis, which occupies seven south-facing terraces on the northern side of the platform, rising over the plaza below. It has a more distinct geometry than at most Maya sites, with a right-angle relationship between most structures.

Much of the public imagery of the site details the ruthless manner in which the city dealt with its enemies. A stucco sculpture rising from the fourth to fifth terraces depicts a skeletal death god carrying the severed head of a lord of Palenque in one hand. A frieze on the fifth terrace probably displayed Toniná&#x27;s most distinguished victims, dozens of fragments of this frieze were discovered in the plaza below. This frieze was carved from the local sandstone but its style is that of Palenque, suggesting that captured artists carried out the work.

After the abandonment of the city at the end of the Classic Period, many of the sculptures fell down the steep embankment supporting the seven terraces.

===Structures===
Ballcourt 1 (the Sunken Ballcourt) was dedicated in 699 by K&#x27;inich B&#x27;aaknal Chaak to mark three victories over K&#x27;inich Kan Balam II of Palenque. Sculptures of the torsos of six captured vassals of the Palenque king were used as ballcourt markers. One of these vassals is named as Yax Ahk (Green Turtle), who was the lord of Annay Te&#x27;, a site that probably lay on the south side of the Usumacinta between Piedras Negras and Yaxchilán.

Ballcourt 2 is the smaller of the two ballcourts and lies in the north of the plaza, at the foot of the Acropolis.
The Palace of the Underworld is entered via three step-vaulted arches on the eastern side of the second terrace of the Acropolis.

The Palace of Frets is located on the fourth terrace of the Acropolis. The south facade of the palace is decorated with four large stepped frets. On the east side of the palace a stairway leads to a decorated throne of stone and stucco. One of the rooms of the palace contains a stucco decoration representing feathered serpents and crossed bones.

===Monuments and sculptures===
The monuments of Toniná tend to be smaller than those at other Maya sites, with most of the stelae measuring less than tall. The most important difference from monuments at other Maya sites is that they are carved in the round like statues, often with hieroglyphic text running down the spine. On the fifth terrace, in-the-round sculptures of Toniná&#x27;s rulers dominated two-dimensional representations of defeated enemies.

The dated monuments at Toniná span the period from AD 495 to 909, covering most of the Classic Period.
Monument 3 is broken into various fragments, five of which were recovered from various locations in Ocosingo and Toniná through the course of the 20th century and most of which were reunited in the Toniná site museum. Aside from being broken, the stela is largely complete and only lightly eroded, it is a statue of a ruler with inscriptions describing the accession of K&#x27;inich Baaknal Chaak and the promotion to the priesthood of Aj Ch&#x27;aaj Naah.

Monument 5 was recovered from a school in Ocosingo and moved to the site museum of Toniná. It is a badly eroded life-size human statue with the head missing.

Monument 7 is carved from yellow sandstone and has suffered only minor damage. It is a stela base with well-preserved hieroglyphs on all four vertical sides and was dedicated by K&#x27;inich Ich&#x27;aak Chapat in 728. It is currently in the Museo Regional in Tuxtla Gutiérrez.

Monument 8 dates to the reign of Ruler 2. It marks the period ending of 682 and shows the presentation of three war captives.

Monument 12 is a sculpture carved in the round, representing Ruler 2. It dates to AD 672.

Monument 27 is a carved step depicting K&#x27;awiil Mo&#x27;, a lord from Palenque, as an elderly prisoner, bound and lying on his back with his profile positioned in such a way as to be trodden on time and again.

Monument 99 is an undated fragment that depicts a female captive, which is rare in Maya art.

Monument 101 has the last Long Count date from any Maya monument, it marks the K&#x27;atun ending of AD 909.

Monument 106 is the earliest securely dated monument at the site, dating to AD 593. It depicts Ruler 1.

Monument 113 depicts Ruler 2 participating in a scattering ritual.

Monument 114 was dedicated in 794 by Ruler 8. It commemorates the death of an important noble, apparently a relative or vassal of Ruler 8&#x27;s predecessor Tuun Chapat.

Monument 122 is a low relief sculpture marking the defeat of Palenque by Ruler 4 in 711 and the capture of Kan Joy Chitam II, who is depicted as a bound captive.

Monument 141 is a very well preserved hieroglyphic panel carved from fine grained white limestone with almost the whole inscription intact. It describes the dedication of a ballcourt by K&#x27;inich B&#x27;aaknal Chaak.

Monument 154 dates to the reign of K&#x27;inich Hix Chapat and records his installing of two subordinate lords in 633.

Monument 158 has a very late date, in AD 904, at the very end of the Classic Period. It was erected during the reign of Ruler 10.

The Frieze of the Dream Lords (also known as the Frieze of the Four Suns or Frieze of the Four Eras) was uncovered by archaeologists during excavations in 1992. It is a stucco mural located at the east end of the 5th terrace. It represents a complex supernatural scene divided into four by a feather-covered scaffold from which hang the severed heads of sacrificial victims. Among the scaffold partitions are depicted the &quot;wayob&quot; (spirit companions) of the Maya elite. The most well-preserved section of the sculpture depicts a skeletal supernatural way named Ak Ok Kimi (&quot;Turtle Foot Death&quot;) wearing turtleshells on its feet and carrying a severed head in one hand, interpreted as the &quot;way&quot; of a lord from the site of Pipa&#x27;. The frieze was once brightly painted in red, blue and yellow. This frieze has strong stylistic parallels with mural paintings at the great Early Classic metropolis of Teotihuacan in the distant Valley of Mexico.

===Site museum===

The site museum is located outside of the Toniná archaeological zone. It possesses 2 exhibition rooms and a conference room. The first room explains the pyramidal form of the acropolis and how it relates to Maya mythology, while the main room contains sculptures of the city&#x27;s rulers.

Artefacts in the collection include stone sculptures, ceramics and artefacts sculpted from bone, shell, obsidian and flint. The pieces in the museum graphically depict the two sides of the power exercised by Toniná, on the one hand with sculptures of the city&#x27;s rulers and on the other with its depictions of bound prisoners of war.

<text>Joseph Louis Proust (26 September 1754 – 5 July 1826) was a French chemist. He was best known for his discovery of the law of definite proportions in 1797, stating that chemical compounds always combine in constant proportions.

==Life==
Joseph-Louis Proust was born on 26 September 1754 in Angers, France. His father served as an apothecary in Angers. Joseph studied chemistry in his father&#x27;s shop and later went to Paris where he gained the appointment of apothecary in chief to the Salpêtrière. He also taught chemistry with Pilâtre de Rozier, a famous aeronaut.

Under Carlos IV&#x27;s influence Proust went to Spain. There he taught at the Chemistry School in Segovia and at the University of Salamanca.
But when Napoleon invaded Spain, they burned Proust&#x27;s laboratory and forced him back to France. On 5 July 1826 he died in Angers, France. The mineral proustite (Ag3AsS3) is named in his honour.

==Chemistry studies==

Proust&#x27;s largest accomplishment in the realm of science was disproving Berthollet with the law of definite proportions, which is sometimes also known as Proust&#x27;s Law. Proust studied copper carbonate, the two tin oxides, and the two iron sulfides to prove this law. He did this by making artificial copper carbonate and comparing it to natural copper carbonate. With this he showed that each had the same proportion of weights between the three elements involved (Cu, C, O). Between the two types of the other compounds, Proust showed that no intermediate compounds exist between them. Proust published this paper in 1797, but the law was not accepted until 1812, when the Swedish chemist Jöns Jacob Berzelius gave him credit for it.

There are, however, exceptions to the Law of Definite Proportions. An entire class of substances does not follow this rule. The compounds are called non-stoichiometric compounds, or Berthollides, after Berthollet. The ratio of the elements present in the compound can fluctuate within certain limits, such as for example ferrous oxide. The ideal formula is FeO, but due to crystallographic vacancies it is reduced to about Fe0.95O.

Proust was also interested in studying the sugars that are present in sweet vegetables and fruits. In 1799, Proust demonstrated, to his class in Madrid, how the sugar in grapes is identical to that found in honey.

<text>The Scottsboro Boys were nine African American male teenagers accused of raping two white women in 1931. The landmark set of legal cases from this incident dealt with racism and the right to a fair trial. The cases included a lynch mob before the suspects had been indicted, all-white juries, rushed trials, and disruptive mobs. It is commonly cited as an example of a legal injustice in the United States legal system.

On March 25, 1931, two dozen people were &quot;hoboing&quot; on a freight train traveling between Chattanooga and Memphis, Tennessee. The hoboes were an equal mix of blacks and whites. A group of white teenage boys saw 18-year-old Haywood Patterson on the train and attempted to push him off, claiming that it was &quot;a white man&#x27;s train&quot;. A group of whites then gathered rocks and attempted to force all the black teenagers from the train. Patterson and the other black teenagers were able to ward off the group. The humiliated white teenagers jumped or were forced off the train and reported to a nearby train master that they had been attacked by a group of black teenage boys. Shortly thereafter, the police stopped and searched the train at Paint Rock, Alabama and arrested the black teenage boys. Two young white women were also taken to the jail, where they accused the African American teenage boys of rape. The case was first heard in Scottsboro, Alabama, in three rushed trials, in which the defendants received poor legal representation. All but 13-year-old Roy Wright were convicted of rape and sentenced to death (the common sentence in Alabama at the time for black men convicted of raping white women), even though there was no medical evidence indicating that rape had taken place.

With help from the Communist Party USA (CPUSA) and the National Association for the Advancement of Colored People (NAACP), the case was appealed. The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed seven of the eight convictions, and granted 13-year-old Eugene Williams a new trial because he was a minor. Chief Justice John C. Anderson dissented, stating that the defendants had been denied an impartial jury, fair trial, fair sentencing, and effective counsel. While waiting for their trials, eight of the nine defendants were held in Kilby Prison. The cases were twice appealed to the United States Supreme Court, which led to landmark decisions on the conduct of trials. In &quot;Powell v. Alabama&quot; (1932), the US Supreme Court ordered new trials.

The case was first returned to the lower court and the judge allowed a change of venue, moving the retrials to Decatur, Alabama. Judge Horton was appointed. During the retrials, one of the alleged victims admitted to fabricating the rape story and asserted that none of the Scottsboro Boys touched either of the white women. The jury still found the defendants guilty, but the judge set aside the verdict and granted a new trial.

The judge was replaced and the case retried. The new judge ruled frequently against the defense. For the third time a jury—now with one African American member—returned a guilty verdict. The case was sent to the US Supreme Court on appeal. It ruled that African Americans had to be included on juries, and ordered retrials. Charges were finally dropped for four of the nine defendants. The other five were convicted and received sentences ranging from 75 years to death. Three served prison sentences. In 1936 one of the Scottsboro Boys, Ozie Powell, was shot in the face and permanently disabled during an altercation with a sheriff&#x27;s deputy in prison. He later pleaded guilty to assaulting the deputy. Clarence Norris, the oldest defendant and the only one sentenced to death in the final trial, &quot;jumped parole&quot; in 1946 and went into hiding. He was found in 1976 and pardoned by Governor George Wallace. Norris later wrote a book about his experiences. He died in 1989 as the last surviving defendant.

The individuals involved and the case have been thoroughly analyzed. It is widely considered a legal injustice, highlighted by the state&#x27;s use of all-white juries. African Americans in Alabama had been disenfranchised since the Reconstruction era and thus were not allowed on juries because jurors were selected from voter rolls. The case has also been explored in many works of literature, music, theater, film and television. On November 21, 2013, Alabama&#x27;s parole board voted to grant posthumous pardons to the three Scottsboro Boys who had not been pardoned or had their convictions overturned.

==Arrests and accusations==
On March 25, 1931, the Southern Railway line between Chattanooga and Memphis, Tennessee, had nine black teenage males who were riding on a freight train with several white males and two white women. A fight broke out between the white and black groups near the Lookout Mountain tunnel, and the whites were kicked off the train. The whites went to a sheriff in the nearby town Paint Rock, Alabama, and claimed that they were assaulted by the African Americans on the train. The sheriff gathered a posse and gave orders to search for and &quot;capture every Negro on the train.&quot; The posse arrested all black passengers on the train for assault.

The black teenagers were: Haywood Patterson (age 18), who claimed that he had ridden freight trains for so long that he could light a cigarette on the top of a moving train; Clarence Norris (age 19), who had left behind ten brothers and sisters in rural Georgia; Charlie Weems (age 19); brothers Andy Wright (age 19) and Roy Wright (age 12), who were leaving home for the first time; the nearly blind Olen Montgomery (age 17), who was hoping to get a job in order to pay for a pair of glasses; Ozie Powell (age 16); Willie Roberson (age 16), who suffered from such severe syphilis that he could barely walk; and Eugene Williams (age 13); Of these nine teenagers, only four knew each other prior to boarding the train.

Two white women who were also aboard the train, Victoria Price and Ruby Bates, told a member of the posse that they had been raped by a group of black teenagers. The posse brought the women to the jail where the accused were being held, and they identified them as their attackers. A doctor was summoned to examine Price and Bates for signs of rape, but none was found. A widely published photo showed the two women shortly after the arrests in 1931.

There was no evidence (beyond the women&#x27;s testimony) pointing to the guilt of the accused, yet that was irrelevant due to the prevalent racism in the South at the time, according to which black men were constantly being policed by white men for signs of sexual interest in white women, which could be punishable by lynching. Price and Bates may have told the police that they were raped to divert police attention from themselves. They were both suspected of being prostitutes and not only risked being arrested for it, but they could also have been prosecuted for violating the Mann Act by crossing a state line &quot;for immoral purposes.&quot;

==Lynch mobs==
In the Jim Crow South, lynching of black males accused of raping or murdering whites was common; word quickly spread of the arrest and rape story. Soon a lynch mob gathered at the jail in Scottsboro, demanding the youths be surrendered to them.

Sheriff Matt Wann stood in front of the jail and addressed the mob, saying he would kill the first person to come through the door. He removed his belt and handed his gun to one of his deputies. He walked through the mob and the crowd parted to let him through; Wann was not touched by anyone. He walked across the street to the courthouse where he telephoned Governor Benjamin M. Miller, who mobilized the Alabama Army National Guard to protect the jail. Wann took the defendants to the county seat of Gadsden, Alabama, for indictment and to await trial. Although rape was potentially a capital offense in Alabama, the defendants at this point were not allowed to consult an attorney.

==Trials==
The prisoners were taken to court by 118 Alabama guardsmen, armed with machine guns. It was market day in Scottsboro, and farmers were in town to sell produce and buy supplies. A crowd of thousands soon formed. Courthouse access required a permit due to the salacious nature of the testimony expected. As the United States Supreme Court later described this situation, &quot;the proceedings ... took place in an atmosphere of tense, hostile, and excited public sentiment.&quot; For each trial, all-white juries were selected. There were few African Americans in the jury pool, as most had been disenfranchised after the Reconstruction era by a new state constitution and white discriminatory practice, and were thus disqualified from jury service.

===Defense attorneys===
The pace of the trials was very fast before the standing-room-only, all-white audience. The judge and prosecutor wanted to speed the nine trials to avoid violence, so the first trial took a day and a half, and the rest took place one right after the other, in just one day. The judge had ordered the Alabama bar to assist the defendants, but the only attorney who volunteered was Milo Moody, a 69-year-old attorney who had not defended a case in decades. The judge persuaded Stephen Roddy, a Chattanooga, Tennessee, real estate lawyer, to assist him. Roddy admitted he had not had time to prepare and was not familiar with Alabama law, but agreed to aid Moody.

Because of the mob atmosphere, Roddy petitioned the court for a change of venue, entering into evidence newspaper and law enforcement accounts describing the crowd as &quot;impelled by curiosity&quot;. Local circuit judge Alfred E. Hawkins found that the crowd was curious and not hostile.

===Norris and Weems trial===

Clarence Norris and Charlie Weems were tried first. During prosecution testimony, Victoria Price stated that she and Ruby Bates witnessed the fight, that one of the black men had a gun, and that they all raped her at knifepoint. During cross-examination by Roddy, Price livened her testimony with wisecracks that brought roars of laughter.

Dr. Bridges testified that his examination of Victoria Price found no vaginal tearing (which would have indicated rape) and that she had semen in her for several hours. Ruby Bates failed to mention that either she or Price were raped until she was cross-examined. The prosecution ended with testimony from three men who claimed the black youths fought the white youths, put them off the train, and &quot;took charge&quot; of the white girls. The prosecution rested without calling any of the white youths as witness.

During the defense testimony, defendant Charles Weems testified that he was not part of the fight, that Patterson had the pistol, and that he had not seen the white girls on the train until the train pulled into Paint Rock.

Defendant Clarence Norris stunned the courtroom by implicating the other defendants. He denied participating in the fight or being in the gondola car where the fight took place. But he said that he saw the alleged rapes by the other blacks from his spot atop the next boxcar. The defense put on no further witnesses.

During closing, the prosecution said, &quot;If you don&#x27;t give these men death sentences, the electric chair might as well be abolished.&quot; The defense made no closing argument, nor did it address the sentencing of the death penalty for their clients.

The Court started the next case while the jury was still deliberating the first. The first jury deliberated less than two hours before returning a guilty verdict and imposed the death sentence on both Weems and Norris.

===Patterson trial===
The trial for Haywood Patterson occurred while the Norris and Weems cases were still under consideration by the jury. When the jury returned its verdict from the first trial, the jury from the second trial was taken out of the courtroom. When the verdicts of guilty were announced, the courtroom erupted in cheers, as did the crowd outside. A band, there to play for a show of Ford Motor Company cars outside, began playing &quot;Hail, Hail, the Gang&#x27;s All Here&quot; and &quot;There&#x27;ll be a Hot Time in the Old Town Tonight&quot;. The celebration was so loud that it was most likely heard by the second jury waiting inside.

After the outburst, the defense of Patterson moved for a mistrial, but Judge Hawkins denied the motion and testimony continued. The second trial continued. During the second trial&#x27;s prosecution testimony, Victoria Price mostly stuck with her story, stating flatly that Patterson raped her. She accused Patterson of shooting one of the white youths. Price volunteered, &quot;I have not had intercourse with any other white man but my husband. I want you to know that.&quot;

Dr. Bridges repeated his testimony from the first trial. Other witnesses testified that &quot;the negroes&quot; had gotten out of the same gondola car as Price and Bates; a farmer claimed to have seen white women [on the train] with the black youths.

Patterson defended his actions, testifying again that he had seen Price and Bates in the gondola car, but had nothing to do with them. On cross-examination he testified that he had seen &quot;all but three of those negroes ravish that girl&quot;, but then changed his story. He said that he had not seen &quot;any white women&quot; until the train &quot;got to Paint Rock.&quot;

The younger Wright brother testified that Patterson was not involved with the girls, but that nine black teenagers had sex with the girls. On cross-examination, Roy Wright testified that Patterson &quot;was not involved with the girls&quot;, but that &quot;The long, tall, black fellow had the pistol. He is not here.&quot; He claimed also to have been on top of the boxcar, and that Clarence Norris had a knife.

Co-defendants Andy Wright, Eugene Williams, and Ozie Powell all testified that they did not see any women on the train. Olen Montgomery testified that he sat alone on the train and did not know of any of the referenced events. The jury quickly convicted Patterson and recommended death by electric chair.

===Powell, Roberson, Williams, Montgomery, and Wright trial===
This trial began within minutes of the previous case. Price repeated her testimony, adding that the black teenagers split into two groups of six to rape her and Ruby Bates. Price accused Eugene Williams of holding the knife to her throat, and said that all of the other teenagers had knives. Under cross-examination she gave more detail, adding that someone held a knife to the white teenager, Gilley, during the rapes.

This trial was interrupted and the jury sent out when the Patterson jury reported; they found him guilty. There was no uproar at the announcement. Ruby Bates took the stand, identifying all five defendants as among the 12 entering the gondola car, putting off the whites, and &quot;ravishing&quot; her and Price.

Dr. Bridges was the next prosecution witness, repeating his earlier testimony. On cross-examination, Bridges testified detecting no movement in the spermatozoa found in either woman, suggesting intercourse had taken place sometime before. He also testified that defendant Willie Roberson was &quot;diseased with syphilis and gonorrhea, a bad case of it.&quot; He admitted under questioning that Price told him that she had had sex with her husband and that Bates had earlier had intercourse as well, before the alleged rape events.

The defense called the only witnesses they had had time to find – the defendants. No new evidence was revealed. The next prosecution witnesses testified that Roberson had run over train cars leaping from one to another and that he was in much better shape than he claimed. Slim Gilley testified that he saw &quot;every one of those five in the gondola,&quot; but did not confirm that he had seen the women raped. The defense again waived closing argument, and surprisingly the prosecution then proceeded to make more argument. The defense objected vigorously, but the Court allowed it.

Judge Hawkins then instructed the jury, stating that any defendant aiding in the crime was as guilty as any of the defendants who had committed it. The jury began deliberating at four in the afternoon.

===Roy Wright trial===
The prosecution agreed that 13-year-old Roy Wright was too young for the death penalty, and did not seek it. The prosecution presented only testimony from Price and Bates. His case went to the jury at nine that evening. His jury and that from the trial of five men were deliberating at the same time.

At nine on Thursday morning, April 9, 1931, the five defendants in Wednesday&#x27;s trial were all found guilty. Roy Wright&#x27;s jury could not agree on sentencing, and was declared a hung jury that afternoon. All the jurors agreed on his guilt, but seven insisted on the death sentence while five held out for life imprisonment (in cases like this, that was often an indication that the jurors believed the suspect was innocent but they were unwilling to go against community norms of conviction). Judge Hawkins declared a mistrial.

===Death sentences===
The eight convicted defendants were assembled on April 9, 1931, and sentenced to death by electric chair. The Associated Press reported that the defendants were &quot;calm&quot; and &quot;stoic&quot; as Judge Hawkins handed down the death sentences one after another.

Judge Hawkins set the executions for July 10, 1931, the earliest date Alabama law allowed. While appeals were filed, the Alabama Supreme Court issued indefinite stays of executions 72 hours before the defendants were scheduled to die. The men&#x27;s cells were next to the execution chamber, and they heard the July 10, 1931 execution of Will Stokes, a black man from St. Clair County convicted of murder. They later recalled that he &quot;died hard.&quot;

===Help from Communist Party and NAACP===
The NAACP hesitated to take on the rape case. Thus, the Communist Party attorneys came to aid the defendants first. After a demonstration in Harlem, the Communist Party USA took an interest in the Scottsboro case. Chattanooga Party member James Allen edited the communist &quot;Southern Worker&quot;, and publicized &quot;the plight of the boys&quot;. The Party used its legal arm, the International Labor Defense (ILD), to take up their cases, and persuaded the defendants&#x27; parents to let the party champion their cause. The ILD retained attorneys George W. Chamlee, who filed the first motions, and Joseph Brodsky.

Later, the NAACP also offered to handle the case, offering the services of famed criminal defense attorney Clarence Darrow. However, the Scottsboro defendants decided to let the ILD handle their appeal. Chamlee moved for new trials for all defendants. Private investigations took place, revealing that Price and Bates had been prostitutes in Tennessee, who regularly serviced both black and white clientele. Chamlee offered judge Hawkins affidavits to that effect, but the judge forbade him to read them out loud. The defense argued that this evidence proved that the two women had likely lied at trial. Chamlee pointed to the uproar in Scottsboro that occurred when the verdicts were reported as further evidence that the change of venue should have been granted.

===Appeal to Alabama Supreme Court===
Following Judge Hawkins&#x27; denial of the motions for a new trial, attorney George W. Chamlee filed an appeal and was granted a stay of execution. Chamlee was joined by Communist Party attorney Joseph Brodsky and ILD attorney Irving Schwab. The defense team argued that their clients had not had adequate representation, had insufficient time for counsel to prepare their cases, had their juries intimidated by the crowd, and finally, that it was unconstitutional for blacks to have been excluded from the jury. In the question of procedural errors, the state Supreme Court found none.

===Williams&#x27; ruling===
On March 24, 1932, the Alabama Supreme Court ruled against seven of the eight remaining Scottsboro Boys, confirming the convictions and death sentences of all but the 13-year-old Eugene Williams. It upheld seven of eight rulings from the lower court.

The Alabama Supreme Court granted 13-year-old Eugene Williams a new trial because he was a juvenile, which saved him from the immediate threat of the electric chair.

===Weems and Norris ruling===
The Court upheld the lower court&#x27;s change of venue decision, upheld the testimony of Ruby Bates, and reviewed the testimony of the various witnesses. As to the &quot;newly discovered evidence&quot;, the Court ruled: &quot;There is no contention on the part of the defendants, that they had sexual intercourse with the alleged victim ... with her consent ... so the defendants would not be granted a new trial.&quot;

As to representation, the Court found &quot;that the defendants were represented by counsel who thoroughly cross examined the state&#x27;s witnesses, and presented such evidence as was available.&quot; Again, the Court affirmed these convictions as well. The Alabama Supreme Court affirmed seven of the eight convictions and rescheduled the executions.

====Dissent====
Chief Justice John C. Anderson dissented, agreeing with the defense in many of its motions. Anderson stated that the defendants had not been accorded a fair trial and strongly dissented to the decision to affirm their sentences. He wrote, &quot;While the constitution guarantees to the accused a speedy trial, it is of greater importance that it should be by a fair and impartial jury, &quot;ex vi termini&quot; (&quot;by definition&quot;), a jury free from bias or prejudice, and, above all, from coercion and intimidation.&quot;

He pointed out that the National Guard had shuttled the defendants back and forth each day from jail, and that this fact alone was enough to have a coercive effect on the jury. Anderson criticized how the defendants were represented. He noted that Roddy &quot;declined to appear as appointed counsel and did so only as &quot;amicus curiae&quot;.&quot; He continued, &quot;These defendants were confined in jail in another county ... and local counsel had little opportunity to ... prepare their defense.&quot; Moreover, they &quot;would have been represented by able counsel had a better opportunity been given.&quot; Justice Anderson also pointed out the failure of the defense to make closing arguments as an example of under zealous defense representation. About the courtroom outburst, Justice Anderson noted that &quot;there was great applause ... and this was bound to have influence.&quot;

Anderson noted that, as the punishment for rape ranged between ten years and death, some of the teenagers should have been found &quot;less culpable than others&quot;, and therefore should have received lighter sentences. Anderson concluded, &quot;No matter how revolting the accusation, how clear the proof, or how degraded or even brutal, the offender, the Constitution, the law, the very genius of Anglo-American liberty demand a fair and impartial trial.&quot;

===Appeal to United States Supreme Court===
The case went to the United States Supreme Court on October 10, 1932, amidst tight security. The ILD retained Walter Pollak to handle the appeal. The Attorney General of Alabama, Thomas E. Knight, represented the State.

Pollak argued that the defendants had been denied due process: first, due to the mob atmosphere; and second, because of the strange attorney appointments and their poor performance at trial. Last, he argued that African Americans were systematically excluded from jury duty contrary to the Fourteenth Amendment.

Knight countered that there had been no mob atmosphere at the trial, and pointed to the finding by the Alabama Supreme Court that the trial had been fair and representation &quot;able.&quot; He told the court that he had &quot;no apologies&quot; to make.

In a landmark decision, the United States Supreme Court reversed the convictions on the ground that the due process clause of the United States Constitution guarantees the effective assistance of counsel at a criminal trial. In an opinion written by Associate Justice George Sutherland, the Supreme Court found the defendants had been denied effective counsel. Chief Justice Anderson&#x27;s previous dissent was quoted repeatedly in this decision.

The Supreme Court did not fault Moody and Roddy for lack of an effective defense, noting that both had told Judge Hawkins that they had not had time to prepare their cases. They said the problem was with the way Judge Hawkins &quot;immediately hurried to trial.&quot; This conclusion did not find the Scottsboro defendants innocent but ruled that the procedures violated their rights to due process under the Fifth and Fourteenth Amendments. The Supreme Court sent the case back to Judge Hawkins for a retrial.

==Decatur trials==
When the case, by now a &quot;cause celebre&quot;, came back to Judge Hawkins, he granted the request for a change of venue. The defense had urged for a move to the city of Birmingham, Alabama, but the case was transferred to the small, rural community of Decatur. This was near homes of the alleged victims and in Ku Klux Klan (KKK) territory.&quot;

The Communist Party USA (CPUSA) maintained control over the defense of the case, retaining the New York criminal defense attorney Samuel Leibowitz. He had never lost a murder trial and was a registered Democrat, with no connection to the Communist Party. They kept Joseph Brodsky as the second chair for the trial.

The case was assigned to District Judge James Edwin Horton and tried in Morgan County. His appointment to the case drew local praise. Nevertheless, the judge carried a loaded pistol in his car throughout the time he presided over these cases.

The two years that had passed since the first trials had not dampened community hostility for the Scottsboro Boys. But others believed they were victims of Jim Crow justice, and the case was covered by numerous national newspapers.

At the trial, some 100 reporters were seated at the press tables. Hundreds more gathered on the courthouse lawn. National Guard members in plain clothes mingled in the crowd, looking for any sign of trouble. The Sheriff&#x27;s department brought the defendants to Court in a patrol wagon guarded by two carloads of deputies armed with shotguns.

In the courtroom, the Scottsboro Boys sat in a row wearing blue prison denims and guarded by National Guardsmen, except for Roy Wright, who had not been convicted. Wright wore street clothes. The &quot;Birmingham News&quot; described him as &quot;dressed up like a Georgia gigolo.&quot;

Leibowitz asserted his trust in the &quot;God-fearing people of Decatur and Morgan County&quot;; he made a pretrial motion to quash the indictment on the ground that blacks had been systematically excluded from the grand jury. Although the motion was denied, this got the issue in the record for future appeals. To this motion, Attorney General Thomas Knight responded, &quot;The State will concede nothing. Put on your case.&quot;

Leibowitz called the editor of the Scottsboro weekly newspaper, who testified that he&#x27;d never heard of a black juror in Decatur because &quot;they all steal.&quot; He called local jury commissioners to explain the absence of African Americans from Jackson County juries. When Leibowitz accused them of excluding black men from juries, they did not seem to understand his accusation. It was as if the exclusion was so ordinary as to be unconscious. (Note: Since most blacks could not vote after having been disenfranchised by the Alabama Constitution, the local jury commissioners probably never thought about them as potential jurors, who were limited to voters.)

Leibowitz called local black professionals as witnesses to show they were qualified for jury service. Leibowitz called John Sanford, an African American of Scottsboro, who was educated, well-spoken, and respected. The defense attorney showed that &quot;Mr. Sanford&quot; was evidently qualified in all manner except by virtue of his race to be a candidate for participation in a jury. During the following cross-examination, Knight addressed the witness by his first name, &quot;John.&quot; The first two times that he did so, Leibowitz asked the court to have him alter his behavior. He did not, and this insult eventually caused Leibowitz to leap to his feet saying, &quot;Now listen, Mr. Attorney-General, I&#x27;ve warned you twice about your treatment of my witness. For the last time now, stand back, take your finger out of his eye, and call him mister&quot;, causing gasps from the public seated in the gallery. The judge abruptly interrupted Leibowitz.

While the pretrial motion to quash the indictment was denied, Leibowitz had positioned the case for appeal. The issue of the composition of the jury was addressed in a second landmark decision by the US Supreme Court, which ruled that race could not be used to exclude anyone from candidacy for participation on a jury anywhere in the United States. This astonished (and infuriated) many residents of Alabama and many other Southern states.

===Patterson trial===

Judge Horton called the first case against Haywood Patterson and began jury selection. Leibowitz objected that African American jurors had been excluded from the jury pool. He called the jury commissioner to the stand, asking if there were any blacks on the juror rolls, and when told yes, suggested his answer was not honest. The locals resented his questioning of the official and &quot;chewed their tobacco meditatively.&quot; The National Guard posted five men with fixed bayonets in front of Leibowitz&#x27;s residence that night. The jury was selected by the end of the day on Friday and sequestered in the Lyons Hotel.

A large crowd gathered outside the courthouse for the start of the Patterson trial on Monday, April 2. Without the &quot;vivid detail&quot; she had used in the Scottsboro trials, Victoria Price told her account in 16 minutes. The defense had what she had said before under oath on paper, and could confront her with any inconsistencies. The only drama came when Knight pulled a torn pair of step-ins from his briefcase and tossed them into the lap of a juror to support the claim of rape.

Leibowitz used a 32-foot model train set up on a table in front of the witness stand to illustrate where each of the parties was during the alleged events, and other points of his defense. When asked if the model in front of her was like the train where she claimed she was raped, Price cracked, &quot;It was bigger. Lots bigger. That is a toy.&quot; Leibowitz later conceded that Price was &quot;one of the toughest witnesses he ever cross examined.&quot; Her answers were evasive and derisive. She often replied, &quot;I can&#x27;t remember&quot; or &quot;I won&#x27;t say.&quot; Once when Leibowitz confronted her with a contradiction in her testimony, she exclaimed, sticking a finger in the direction of defendant Patterson, &quot;One thing I will never forget is that one sitting right there raped me.&quot; The attorney tried to question her about a conviction for fornication and adultery in Huntsville, but the court sustained a prosecution objection.

Price insisted that she had spent the evening before the alleged rape at the home of Mrs. Callie Brochie in Chattanooga. Leibowitz asked her whether she had spent the evening in a &quot;hobo jungle&quot; in Huntsville, Alabama, with a Lester Carter and Jack Tiller, but she denied it. Leibowitz said that Callie Brochie was a fictional character in a &quot;Saturday Evening Post&quot; short story and suggested that Price&#x27;s stay with her had been equally fictional.

As the historian James Goodman wrote: 

Price was not the first hardened witness [Leibowitz] had faced, and certainly not the most depraved. Nor was she the first witness who tried to stare him down and, failing that, who seemed as if she were about to leap out of her seat and strike him. She was not the first witness to be evasive, sarcastic and crude. She was, however, the first witness to use her bad memory, truculence, and total lack of refinement, and at times, even ignorance, to great advantage.

Many of the whites in the courtroom likely resented Leibowitz as a Jew from New York hired by the Communists, and for his treatment of a southern white woman, even a low-class one, as a hostile witness. Some wondered if there was any way he could leave Decatur alive. The National Guard Captain Joe Burelson promised Judge Horton that he would protect Leibowitz and the defendants &quot;as long as we have a piece of ammunition or a man alive.&quot; Once Captain Burelson learned that a group was on their way to &quot;take care of Leibowitz&quot;, he raised the drawbridge across the Tennessee River, keeping them out of Decatur.

Judge Horton learned that the prisoners were in danger from locals. Once he sent out the jury and warned the courtroom, &quot;I want it to be known that these prisoners are under the protection of this court. This court intends to protect these prisoners and any other persons engaged in this trial.&quot; Threats of violence came from the North as well. One letter from Chicago read, &quot;When those Boys are dead, within six months your state will lose 500 lives.&quot;

Leibowitz systematically dismantled each prosecution witness&#x27; story under cross-examination. He got Dr. Bridges to admit on cross-examination that &quot;the best you can say about the whole case is that both of these women showed they had sexual intercourse.&quot; Paint Rock ticket agent W. H. Hill testified to seeing the women and the black youths in the same car, but on cross-examination admitted to not seeing the women at all until they got off the train. Posse member Tom Rousseau claimed to have seen the women and youths get off the same car but under cross-examination admitted finding the defendants scattered in various cars at the front of the train. Lee Adams testified that he had seen the fight, but later saying that he was a quarter-mile from the tracks. Ory Dobbins repeated that he&#x27;d seen the women try to jump off the train, but Leibowitz showed photos of the positions of the parties that proved Dobbins could not have seen everything he claimed. Dobbins insisted he had seen the girls wearing women&#x27;s clothing, but other witnesses had testified they were in overalls.

The prosecution withdrew the testimony of Dr. Marvin Lynch, the other examining doctor, as &quot;repetitive.&quot; Many years later, Judge Horton said that Dr. Lynch confided that the women had not been raped and had laughed when he examined them. He said that if he testified for the defense, his practice in Jackson County would be over. Thinking Patterson would be acquitted, Judge Horton did not force Dr. Lynch to testify, but the judge had become convinced the defendants were innocent.

====Defense====
Leibowitz began his defense by calling Chattanooga resident Dallas Ramsey, who testified that his home was next to the hobo jungle mentioned earlier. He said that he had seen both Price and Bates get on a train there with a white man on the morning of the alleged rape.

Train fireman Percy Ricks testified that he saw the two women slipping along the side of the train right after it stopped in Paint Rock, as if they were trying to escape the posse. Leibowitz put on the testimony of Chattanooga gynecologist, Dr. Edward A. Reisman, who testified that after a woman had been raped by six men, it was impossible that she would have only a trace of semen, as was found in this case.

Leibowitz next called Lester Carter, a white man who testified that he had had intercourse with Bates. Jack Tiller, another white, said he had had sex with Price, two days before the alleged rapes. He testified that he had been on the train on the morning of the arrests. He had heard Price ask Orville Gilley, a white youth, to confirm that she had been raped. However, Gilley had told her to &quot;go to hell.&quot; Morgan County Solicitor Wade Wright cross-examined Carter. Wright tried to get Carter to admit that the Communist Party had bought his testimony, which Carter denied. But he said that the defense attorney Joseph Brodsky had paid his rent and bought him a new suit for the trial.

Five of the original nine Scottsboro defendants testified that they had not seen Price or Bates until after the train stopped in Paint Rock. Willie Roberson testified that he was suffering from syphilis, with sores that prevented him from walking, and that he was in a car at the back of the train.

Olen Montgomery testified that he had been alone on a tank car the entire trip, and had not known about the fight or alleged rapes. Ozie Powell said that while he was not a participant, he had seen the fight with the white teenagers from his vantage point between a boxcar and a gondola car, where he had been hanging on. He said he saw the white teenagers jump off the train. Roberson, Montgomery, and Powell all denied they had known each other or the other defendants before that day. Andy Wright, Eugene Williams, and Haywood Patterson testified that they had previously known each other, but had not seen the women until the train stopped in Paint Rock. Knight questioned them extensively about instances in which their testimony supposedly differed from their testimony at their trial in Scottsboro. They did not contradict themselves in any meaningful way.

Haywood Patterson testified on his own behalf that he had not seen the women before stopping in Paint Rock; he withstood a cross-examination from Knight who &quot;shouted, shook his finger at, and ran back and forth in front of the defendant.&quot; At one point, Knight demanded, &quot;You were tried at Scottsboro?&quot; Patterson snapped, &quot;I was framed at Scottsboro.&quot; Knight thundered, &quot;Who told you to say that?&quot; Patterson replied, &quot;I told myself to say it.&quot;

Just after the defense rested &quot;with reservations&quot;, someone handed Leibowitz a note. The attorneys approached the bench for a hushed conversation, which was followed by a short recess. Leibowitz called one final witness. Thus far in the trial, Ruby Bates had been notably absent. She had disappeared from her home in Huntsville weeks before the new trial, and every sheriff in Alabama had been ordered to search for her, to no avail. Now, two guardsmen with bayonets opened the courtroom doors, and Bates entered, &quot;in stylish clothes, eyes downcast.&quot;

Her dramatic and unexpected entrance drew stares from the residents of the courtroom. Victoria Price, brought out for Bates to identify, glared at her. Attorney General Knight warned Price to &quot;keep your temper.&quot; Bates proceeded to testify and explained that no rape had occurred. She said none of the defendants had touched her or even spoken to her. When asked if she had been raped on March 25, 1931, Bates said, &quot;No sir.&quot; When asked why she had initially said she had been raped, Bates replied, &quot;I told it just like Victoria did because she said we might have to stay in jail if we did not frame up a story after crossing a state line with men.&quot; Bates explained that Price had said, &quot;she didn&#x27;t care if all the Negroes in Alabama were put in jail.&quot; This recantation seemed to be a severe blow to the prosecution.

Bates admitted having intercourse with Lester Carter in the Huntsville railway yards two days before making accusations. Finally, she testified she had been in New York City and had decided to return to Alabama to tell the truth, at the urging of Reverend Harry Emerson Fosdick of that city.

With his eye turned to the southern jury, Knight cross-examined her. He noted her stylish dress and demanded where she had gotten her fine clothes. When she responded that the Communist Party had paid for her clothes, any credibility she had with the jury was destroyed. Judge Horton warned spectators to stop laughing at her testimony or he would eject them.

===Closing arguments===
By the time Leibowitz closed, the prosecution had employed anti-semitic remarks to discredit him. Wade Wright added to this, referring to Ruby&#x27;s boyfriend Lester Carter as &quot;Mr. Caterinsky&quot; and called him &quot;the prettiest Jew&quot; he ever saw. He said, &quot;Don&#x27;t you know these defense witnesses are bought and paid for? May the Lord have mercy on the soul of Ruby Bates. Now the question in this case is this—Is justice in the case going to be bought and sold in Alabama with Jew money from New York?&quot;

Leibowitz objected and moved for a new trial. Judge Horton refused to grant a new trial, telling the jury to &quot;put [the remarks] out of your minds.&quot; One author describes Wright&#x27;s closing argument as &quot;the now-famous Jew-baiting summary to the jury.&quot; He goes on to say that, &quot;Until Wright spoke, many of the newspapermen felt that there was an outside chance for acquittal, at least a hung jury. But ... from then on the defense was helpless.&quot;

In his closing, Leibowitz called Wright&#x27;s argument an appeal to regional bigotry, claiming talk about Communists was just to &quot;befuddle&quot; the jury. He described himself as a patriot, a &quot;Roosevelt Democrat&quot;, who had served the &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; in World War I, &quot;when there was no talk of Jew or Gentile, white or black.&quot; As to Wright&#x27;s reference to &quot;Jew money&quot;, Leibowitz said that he was defending the Scottsboro Boys for nothing and was personally paying the expenses of his wife, who had accompanied him.

&quot;I&#x27;m interested&quot;, Leibowitz argued, &quot;solely in seeing that that poor, moronic colored boy over there and his co-defendants in the other cases get a square shake of the dice, because I believe, before God, they are the victims of a dastardly frame-up.&quot; He called Price&#x27;s testimony &quot;a foul, contemptible, outrageous lie.&quot; He ended with the Lord&#x27;s Prayer and a challenge to either acquit or render the death sentence—nothing in between.

Attorney General Knight delivered his rebuttal, roaring that if the jury found Haywood not guilty, they ought to &quot;put a garland of roses around his neck, give him a supper, and send him to New York City.&quot; Considering the evidence, he continued, &quot;there can be but one verdict—death in the electric chair for raping Victoria Price.&quot;

===Verdict===
The jury began deliberating Saturday afternoon and announced it had a verdict at ten the next morning, while many residents of Decatur were in church. The jury foreman, Eugene Bailey, handed the handwritten verdict to Judge Horton. The jury found the defendant guilty of rape and sentenced Patterson to death in the electric chair. Bailey had held out for eleven hours for life in prison, but in the end, agreed to the death sentence.

According to one account, juror Irwin Craig held out against the imposition of the death penalty, because he thought that Patterson was innocent.

====Irwin Craig====
Irwin &quot;Red&quot; Craig (died 1970) (nicknamed from the color of his hair) was the sole juror to refuse to impose the death penalty in the retrial of Haywood Patterson, one of the Scottsboro Boys, in what was then the small town of Decatur, Alabama. His son, Sonny, later recalled him as saying: &quot;Those young men were innocent; everybody knew that but they were going to be punished for what they didn&#x27;t do.&quot; The KKK staked a burning cross in his family yard.

He was called in to see the judge presiding over that retrial, James Horton, who exhorted him to change his vote to guilty. &quot;If you don&#x27;t, they will kill you, Red,&quot; said the judge. Craig protested: &quot;I can&#x27;t change my vote, judge.&quot; Horton replied: &quot;Don&#x27;t worry about that, I&#x27;ll take care of it.&quot;

===Horton grants Patterson a new trial===
The defense moved for a retrial and, believing the defendants innocent, Judge James Edwin Horton agreed to set aside the guilty verdict for Patterson. Horton ruled the rest of defendants could not get a fair trial at that time and indefinitely postponed the rest of the trials, knowing it would cost him his job when he ran for re-election.

Judge Horton heard arguments on the motion for a new trial in the Limestone County Court House in Athens, Alabama, where he read his decision to the astonished defense and a furious Knight: 

Horton ordered a new trial, which would turn out to be the third for Patterson. When Horton announced his decision, Knight stated that he would retry Patterson. He said that he had found Orville &quot;Carolina Slim&quot; Gilley, the white teenager in the gondola car and that Gilley would corroborate Price&#x27;s story in full. At Knight&#x27;s request, the court replaced Judge Horton with Judge William Washington Callahan, described as a racist. He later instructed the jury in the next round of trials that no white woman would voluntarily have sex with a black man.

===New trials under Callahan===
During the Decatur retrial, held from November 1933 to July 1937, Judge Callahan wanted to take the case off &quot;the front pages of America&#x27;s newspapers.&quot; He banned photographers from the courthouse grounds and typewriters from his courtroom. &quot;There ain&#x27;t going to be no more picture snappin&#x27; round here,&quot; he ordered. He also imposed a strict three-day time limit on each trial, running them into the evening. He removed protection from the defense, convincing Governor Benjamin Meek Miller to keep the National Guard away.

The defense moved for another change of venue, submitting affidavits in which hundreds of residents stated their intense dislike for the defendants, to show there was &quot;overwhelming prejudice&quot; against them. The prosecution countered with testimony that some of the quotes in the affidavits were untrue and that six of the people quoted were dead. The defense countered that they had received numerous death threats, and the judge replied that he and the prosecution had received more from the communists. The motion was denied.

Leibowitz led Commissioner Moody and Jackson County Circuit Clerk C. A. Wann through every page of the Jackson County jury roll to show that it contained no names of African Americans. When, after several hours of reading names, Commissioner Moody finally claimed several names to be of African Americans, Leibowitz got handwriting samples from all present. One man admitted that the handwriting appeared to be his. Leibowitz called in a handwriting expert, who testified that names identified as African American had been added later to the list, and signed by former Jury Commissioner Morgan.

Judge Callahan did not rule that excluding people by race was constitutional, only that the defendant had not proven that African Americans had been deliberately excluded. By letting Leibowitz go on record on this issue, Judge Callahan provided grounds for the case to be appealed to the US Supreme Court for a second time. It was the basis for the court&#x27;s finding in &quot;Norris v. Alabama&quot; (1935), that exclusion of African American grand jurors had occurred, violating the due process clause of the Constitution.

Haywood Patterson&#x27;s Decatur retrial began on November 27, 1933. Thirty-six potential jurors admitted having a &quot;fixed opinion&quot; in the case, which caused Leibowitz to move for a change of venue. Callahan denied the motion. Callahan excluded defense evidence that Horton had admitted, at one point exclaiming to Leibowitz, &quot;Judge Horton can&#x27;t help you [now].&quot; He routinely sustained prosecution objections but overruled defense objections.

Price testified again that a dozen armed negro men entered the gondola car. She said Patterson had fired a shot and ordered all whites but Gilley off the train. She said the negros had ripped her clothes off and repeatedly raped her at knifepoint, and pointed out Patterson as one of the rapists. She said they raped her and Bates, afterward saying they would take them north or throw them in the river. She testified that she had fallen while getting out of the gondola car, passed out, and came to seated in a store at Paint Rock. Leibowitz questioned her until Judge Callahan stopped court for the day at 6:30. When he resumed the next morning, he pointed out many contradictions among her various versions of the rape.

Judge Callahan repeatedly interrupted Leibowitz&#x27;s cross-examination of Price, calling defense questions &quot;arguing with the witness&quot;, &quot;immaterial&quot;, &quot;useless&quot;, &quot;a waste of time&quot;, and even &quot;illegal&quot;. The many contradictions notwithstanding, Price steadfastly stuck to her testimony that Patterson had raped her.

Orville Gilley&#x27;s testimony at Patterson&#x27;s Decatur retrial was a mild sensation. He denied being a &quot;bought witness&quot;, repeating his testimony about armed blacks ordering the white teenagers off the train. He confirmed Price&#x27;s rape account, adding that he stopped the rape by convincing the &quot;negro&quot; with the gun to make the rapists stop &quot;before they killed that woman.&quot; Leibowitz cross-examined him at length about contradictions between his account and Price&#x27;s testimony, but he remained &quot;unruffled.&quot; Gilley testified to meeting Lester Carter and the women the evening before the alleged rapes and getting them coffee and sandwiches. Callahan interrupted before Leibowitz could find out if Gilley went &quot;somewhere with [the women]&quot; that night.

The prosecution called several white farmers who testified that they had seen the fight on the train and saw the girls &quot;a-fixin&#x27; to get out&quot;, but they saw the defendants drag them back.

Lester Carter took the stand for the defense. He had testified in the first Decatur trial that Price and Bates had had sex with him and Gilley in the hobo jungle in Chattanooga prior to the alleged rapes, which could account for the semen found in the women. However, Judge Callahan would not let him repeat that testimony at the trial, stating that any such testimony was &quot;immaterial&quot;.

Ruby Bates was apparently too sick to travel. She had had surgery in New York, and at one point Leibowitz requested that her deposition be taken as a dying declaration. While she was not dying, committed to his three-day time limit for the trial, Judge Callahan denied the request to arrange to take her deposition. Although the defense needed her testimony, by the time a deposition arrived, the case had gone to the jury and they did not hear it at all.

Haywood Patterson took the stand, admitting he had &quot;cussed&quot; at the white teenagers, but only because they cussed at him first. He denied seeing the white women before Paint Rock. On cross-examination Knight confronted him with previous testimony from his Scottsboro trial that he had not touched the women, but that he had seen the other five defendants rape them. Leibowitz objected, stating that the US Supreme Court had ruled previous testimony illegal. Judge Callahan allowed it, although he would not allow testimony by Patterson stating that he had not seen the women before Paint Rock. Patterson explained contradictions in his testimony: &quot;We was scared and I don&#x27;t know what I said. They told us if we didn&#x27;t confess they&#x27;d kill us—give us to the mob outside.&quot;

Patterson claimed the threats had been made by guards and militiamen while the defendants were in the Jackson County jail. He said threats were made even in the presence of the judge. Patterson pointed at H.G. Bailey, the prosecutor in his Scottsboro trial, stating, &quot;And Mr. Bailey over there—he said send all the niggers to the electric chair. There&#x27;s too many niggers in the world anyway.&quot;

Closing arguments were made November 29 through November 30, without stopping for Thanksgiving. Callahan limited each side to two hours of argument.

Knight declared in his closing that the prosecution was not avenging what the defendants had done to Price. &quot;What has been done to her cannot be undone. What you can do now is to make sure that it doesn&#x27;t happen to some other woman.&quot; Leibowitz objected that the argument was &quot;an appeal to passion and prejudice&quot; and moved for a mistrial. Knight agreed that it was an appeal to passion, and Callahan overruled the motion. Knight continued: &quot;We all have a passion, all men in this courtroom to protect the womanhood in Alabama.&quot; For his summation, solicitor Wade Wright reviewed the testimony and warned the jury, &quot;that this crime could have happened to any woman, even though she was riding in a parlor car, instead of the boxcar.&quot;

Solicitor H. G. Bailey reminded the jury that the law presumed Patterson innocent, even if what Gilley and Price had described was &quot;as sordid as ever a human tongue has uttered.&quot; Finally, he defended the women, &quot;Instead of painting their faces ... they were brave enough to go to Chattanooga and look for honest work.&quot; Bailey attacked the defense case:

They say this is a frame-up! They have been yelling frame-up ever since this case started! Who framed them? Did Ory Dobbins frame them? Did brother Hill frame them? We did a lot of awful things over there in Scottsboro, didn&#x27;t we? My, my, my. And now they come over here and try to convince you that that sort of thing happened in your neighboring county.

Judge Callahan charged the jury that Price and Bates could have been raped without force, just by withholding their consent. He instructed them, &quot;Where the woman charged to have been raped is white, there is a strong presumption under the law that she will not and did not yield voluntarily to intercourse with the defendant, a Negro.&quot; He instructed the jury that if Patterson was so much as present for the &quot;purpose of aiding, encouraging, assisting or abetting&quot; the rapes &quot;in any way&quot;, he was as guilty as the person who committed the rapes.

He told them that they did not need to find corroboration of Price&#x27;s testimony. If they believed her, that was enough to convict. Judge Callahan said he was giving them two forms – one for conviction and one for acquittal, but he supplied the jury with only a form to convict. He supplied them with an acquittal form only after the prosecution, fearing reversible error, urged him to do so.

As &quot;Time&quot; described it: &quot;Twenty-six hours later came a resounding thump on the brown wooden jury room door. The bailiff let the jurors out [from the Patterson trial]. The foreman unfisted a moist crumpled note, handed it to the clerk. A thin smile faded from Patterson&#x27;s lips as the clerk read his third death sentence.&quot;

In May 1934, despite having run unopposed in the previous election for the position, James Horton was soundly defeated when he ran for re-election as a circuit judge. The vote against him was especially heavy in Morgan County. In the same election, Thomas Knight was elected Lieutenant Governor of Alabama.

===Norris&#x27;s retrial===
Judge Callahan started jury selection for the trial of defendant Norris on November 30, 1933, Thanksgiving afternoon. At this trial, Victoria Price testified that two of her alleged assailants had pistols, that they threw off the white teenagers, that she tried to jump off but was grabbed, thrown onto the gravel in the gondola, one of them held her legs, and one held a knife on her, and one raped both her and Ruby Bates. She claimed Norris raped her, along with five others.

Callahan would not allow Leibowitz to ask Price about any &quot;crime of moral turpitude.&quot; Nor would he allow Leibowitz to ask why she went to Chattanooga, where she had spent the night there, or about Carter or Gilley. Neither would he allow questions as to whether she&#x27;d had sexual intercourse with Carter or Gilley. During more cross-examination, Price looked at Knight so often Leibowitz accused her of looking for signals. Judge Callahan cautioned Leibowitz he would not permit &quot;such tactics&quot; in his courtroom.

Dr. Bridges was a state witness, and Leibowitz cross-examined him at length, trying to get him to agree that a rape would have produced more injuries than he found. Callahan sustained a prosecution objection, ruling &quot;the question is not based on the evidence.&quot;

Ruby Bates had given a deposition from her hospital bed in New York, which arrived in time to be read to the jury in the Norris trial. Judge Callahan sustained prosecution objections to large portions of it, most significantly the part where she said that she and Price both had sex voluntarily in Chattanooga the night before the alleged rapes.

Leibowitz read the rest of Bates&#x27; deposition, including her version of what happened on the train. She said that there were white teenagers riding in the gondola car with them, that some black teenagers came into the car, that a fight broke out, that most of the white teenagers got off the train, and that the blacks &quot;disappeared&quot; until the posse stopped the train at Paint Rock. She testified that she, Price and Gilley were arrested and that Price made the rape accusation, instructing her to go along with the story to stay out of jail. She reiterated that neither she nor Price had been raped. Leibowitz chose to keep Norris off the stand.

Closing arguments were on December 4, 1933. In his closing argument, Leibowitz called the prosecution&#x27;s case &quot;a contemptible frame-up by two bums.&quot; He attempted to overcome local prejudice, saying &quot;if you have a reasonable doubt, hold out. Stand your ground, show you are a man, a red-blooded he-man.&quot; The prosecution&#x27;s closing argument was shorter and less &quot;barbed&quot; than it had been in the Patterson case. It was addressed more to the evidence and less to the regional prejudice of the jury.

Leibowitz made many objections to Judge Callahan&#x27;s charge to the jury. &quot;The New York Times&quot; described Leibowitz as &quot;pressing the judge almost as though he were a hostile witness.&quot; New York City Mayor Fiorello H. La Guardia had dispatched two burly New York City police officers to protect Leibowitz. During the long jury deliberations, Judge Callahan also assigned two Morgan County deputies to guard him.

The jury began deliberation on December 5. After 14 hours of deliberation, the jury filed into the courtroom; they returned a guilty verdict and sentenced Norris to death. Norris took the news stoically.

Leibowitz&#x27;s prompt appeal stayed the execution date, so Patterson and Norris were both returned to death row in Kilby Prison. The other defendants waited in the Jefferson County jail in Birmingham for the outcome of the appeals. Leibowitz was escorted to the train station under heavy guard, and he boarded a train back to New York.

===United States Supreme Court reverses Decatur convictions===

The case went to the United States Supreme Court for a second time as &quot;Norris v. Alabama&quot;. The court reversed the convictions for a second time on the basis that blacks had been excluded from the jury pool because of their race.

Attorneys Samuel Leibowitz, Walter H. Pollak, and Osmond Frankel argued the case from February 15 to 18, 1935. Leibowitz showed the justices that the names of African Americans had been added to the jury rolls. The Justices examined the items closely with a magnifying glass. Thomas Knight maintained that the jury process was color blind.

Because the case of Haywood Patterson had been dismissed due to the technical failure to appeal it on time, it presented different issues. Attorneys Osmond Frankel and Walter Pollak argued those.

On April 1, 1935, the United States Supreme Court sent the cases back a second time for retrials in Alabama.
Writing for the Court, Chief Justice Charles Evans Hughes observed the Equal Protection Clause of the United States Constitution clearly forbade the states from excluding citizens from juries due solely to their race. He noted that the Court had inspected the jury rolls, chastising Judge Callahan and the Alabama Supreme Court for accepting assertions that black citizens had not been excluded. According to the US Supreme Court, &quot;something more&quot; was needed. The Court concluded, &quot;the motion to quash ... should have been granted.&quot; The Court ruled that it would be a great injustice to execute Patterson when Norris would receive a new trial, reasoning that Alabama should have opportunity to reexamine Patterson&#x27;s case as well.

Alabama Governor Bibb Graves instructed every solicitor and judge in the state, &quot;Whether we like the decisions or not ... We must put Negroes in jury boxes. Alabama is going to observe the supreme law of America.&quot;

===Final round of trials===
After the case was remanded, on May 1, 1935, Victoria Price swore new rape complaints against the defendants as the sole complaining witness. An African American, Creed Conyer, was selected as the first black person since Reconstruction to sit on an Alabama grand jury. The indictment could be made with a two-thirds vote, and the grand jury voted to indict the defendants. Thomas Knight, Jr. by now (May 1935) Lieutenant Governor, was appointed a special prosecutor to the cases.

Leibowitz recognized that he was viewed by Southerners as an outsider, and allowed the local attorney Charles Watts to be the lead attorney; he assisted from the sidelines. Judge Callahan arraigned all the defendants except the two juveniles in Decatur; they all pleaded not guilty.

Watts moved to have the case sent to the Federal Court as a civil rights case, which Callahan promptly denied. He set the retrials for January 20, 1936.

===Final decisions===

By January 23, 1936, Haywood Patterson was convicted of rape and sentenced to 75 years—the first time in Alabama that a black man had not been sentenced to death in the rape of a white woman.

During May 1937, Thomas Knight died.

On July 15, 1937, Clarence Norris was convicted of rape and sexual assault and sentenced to death.

On July 22, 1937, Andrew Wright was convicted of rape and sentenced to 99 years.

On July 24, 1937, Charlie Weems was convicted of rape and sentenced to 105 years in prison.

On July 24, 1937, Ozie Powell was taken into court and the new prosecutor, Thomas Lawson, announced that the state was dropping rape charges against Powell and that he was pleading guilty to assaulting a deputy. He was sentenced to 20 years. The state dropped the rape charges as part of this plea bargain.

On July 24, 1937, the state of Alabama dropped all charges against Willie Roberson, Olen Montgomery, Eugene Williams, and Roy Wright. The four had spent over six years in prison on death row, as &quot;adults&quot; despite their ages. Thomas Lawson announced that all charges were being dropped against the remaining four defendants: He said that after &quot;careful consideration&quot; every prosecutor was &quot;convinced&quot; that Roberson and Montgomery were &quot;not guilty.&quot; Wright and Williams, regardless of their guilt or innocence, were 12 and 13 at the time and, in view of the jail time they had already served, justice required that they also be released.

On July 26, 1937, Haywood Patterson was sent to Atmore State Prison Farm. The remaining &quot;Scottsboro Boys&quot; in custody, Norris, A Wright and Weems were at this time in Kilby Prison.

==Aftermath==
Governor Graves had planned to pardon the prisoners in 1938 but was angered by their hostility and refusal to admit their guilt. He refused the pardons but did commute Norris&#x27;s death sentence to life in prison.

Ruby Bates toured for a short while as an ILD speaker. She said she was &quot;sorry for all the trouble that I caused them&quot;, and claimed she did it because she was &quot;frightened by the ruling class of Scottsboro.&quot; Later, she worked in a New York state spinning factory until 1938; that year she returned to Huntsville. Victoria Price worked in a Huntsville cotton mill until 1938, then moved to Flintville, Tennessee. Victoria Price never recanted her testimony.

&quot;Scottsboro: A Tragedy of the American South&quot; (1969) by Dan T. Carter was widely thought to be authoritative, but it wrongly asserted that Price and Bates were dead. An NBC TV movie, &quot;Judge Horton and the Scottsboro Boys&quot; (1976), asserted that the defense had proven that Price and Bates were prostitutes; both sued NBC over their portrayals. Bates died in 1976 in Washington state, where she lived with her carpenter husband, and her case was not heard. Price&#x27;s case was initially dismissed but she appealed. When the US Supreme Court agreed to hear the case in 1977, Price disregarded the advice of her lawyer and accepted a settlement from NBC. She used the money to buy a house. Price died in 1982, in Lincoln County, Tennessee.

Most residents of Scottsboro have acknowledged the injustice that started in their community. In January 2004, the town dedicated a historical marker in commemoration of the case at the Jackson County Court House. According to a news story, &quot;An 87-year-old black man who attended the ceremony recalled that the mob scene following the Boys&#x27; arrest was frightening and that death threats were leveled against the jailed suspects. Speaking of the decision to install the marker, he said, &#x27;I think it will bring the races closer together, to understand each other better. 

Sheila Washington founded the Scottsboro Boys Museum &amp; Cultural Center in 2010 in Scottsboro. It is located in the former Joyce Chapel United Methodist Church and is devoted to exploring the case and commemorating the search for justice for its victims.

===2013 pardon===
In early May 2013, the Alabama legislature cleared the path for posthumous pardons. On November 21, 2013, the Alabama Board of Pardons and Paroles granted posthumous pardons to Weems, Wright and Patterson, the only Scottsboro Boys who had neither had their convictions overturned nor received a pardon.

Governor Robert J. Bentley said to the press that day:

While we could not take back what happened to the Scottsboro Boys 80 years ago, we found a way to make it right moving forward. The pardons granted to the Scottsboro Boys today are long overdue. The legislation that led to today&#x27;s pardons was the result of a bipartisan, cooperative effort. I appreciate the Pardons and Parole Board for continuing our progress today and officially granting these pardons. Today, the Scottsboro Boys have finally received justice.

===The Scottsboro Boys Museum===
In 2010, a museum was opened to commemorate the injustices that these nine boys faced. This museum is called &quot;The Scottsboro Boys Museum&quot; and is located in Joyce Chapel, which is considered a historical site, in Scottsboro, Alabama. This museum offers a unique experience into the 1931 incident involving the nine boys and the subsequent events that followed. 

Their mission states:&quot;The Scottsboro Boys Museum commemorates the lives and legacy of nine young African Americans who, in the 1930s, became international symbols of race-based injustice in the American South, and celebrates the positive actions of those of all colors, creeds, and origins who have taken a stand against the tyranny of racial oppression.&quot;

===Fates of the defendants===

* Following his conviction, Haywood Patterson spent 13 years in prison. He escaped in 1949 and in 1950 was found in Michigan, but the governor refused to extradite him. He wrote a book about his experience, &quot;Scottsboro Boy&quot;. In 1951 he was convicted of manslaughter over stabbing someone in a bar fight and sentenced to prison, where he died of cancer in 1952. 
* In 1936, Ozie Powell was involved in an altercation with a correction officer and shot in the face, suffering permanent brain damage. He was paroled in 1946 following his conviction for assault. He was reported to have died in Atlanta in 1974.
* Charlie Weems was paroled in 1943 after having been held in prison for a total of 12 years in some of Alabama&#x27;s worst institutions. While Weems did end up getting married and working in a laundry in Atlanta, his eyes never recovered from being tear gassed while in prison. He was reported to have died not long after his release due to tuberculosis. 
* Andy Wright was convicted and sentenced to 99 years. He was paroled and returned to prison after violating parole. He was paroled in New York State in 1950. By the mid-1950s, he seemed to have settled for good in Connecticut. He remained in contact with Clarence Norris for a few years and planned on Norris reuniting with younger brother Roy, but after Roy&#x27;s death, Norris never saw Andy again. Andy moved home to Tennessee to be with his mother Ada Wright, and died there in 1968. He is buried in an unmarked grave beside his brother Roy.
* Clarence Norris was the only defendant finally sentenced to death. Governor Bibb Graves of Alabama in 1938 commuted his death sentence to life. Given parole in 1946, he &quot;jumped&quot; and went into hiding. In 1976 he was found in Brooklyn, New York, having married and had children. In 1970 he had begun seeking a pardon, with the help of the NAACP and Alabama&#x27;s attorney, and Governor George Wallace pardoned him in 1976, declaring him &quot;not guilty&quot;. Norris published an autobiography, &quot;The Last of the Scottsboro Boys&quot; (1979). He died of Alzheimer&#x27;s disease on January 23, 1989.
* In 1937, the state dropped all charges for Willie Roberson, Olen Montgomery, Eugene Williams, and Roy Wright, who had already been in prison for six years. Roberson settled in Brooklyn and found steady work. He remained in contact with Montgomery throughout the years. While planning a visit with former cellmate Norris, it was discovered by the two men that Roberson died of an asthma attack in 1959, the week prior to their reunion.
* Olen Montgomery attempted a vaudeville career after being released from prison, but these plans never materialized. He drifted around in the North, working odd jobs and struggling with a drinking problem. He remained in contact with Clarence Norris, Willie Roberson, and the Wright brothers. After Roberson and Wright died in 1959, he told Norris he planned on returning to the south. He did so within the next year, and reportedly died in Alabama in 1975.
* Eugene Williams moved with family in St. Louis. His family planned on him going to Seminary school, but whether this happened is uncertain. Where and when Eugene Williams settled and died is unknown.
* After Alabama freed Roy Wright, the Scottsboro Defense Committee took him on a national lecture tour. He later had a career in the US Army and Merchant Marine. In August 16, 1959, believing his wife had been unfaithful during his tour, he shot and killed her, and then shot himself.
* In 2013, the state of Alabama issued posthumous pardons for Patterson, Weems, and Andy Wright.

==In popular culture==

===Literature===
* African American poet and playwright Langston Hughes wrote about the trials in his work &quot;Scottsboro Limited&quot;.
* The novel &quot;To Kill a Mockingbird&quot; by Harper Lee is about growing up in the Deep South in the 1930s. An important plot element concerns the father, attorney Atticus Finch, defending a Black man against a false accusation of rape. The trial in this novel is often characterized as based on the Scottsboro case. But Harper Lee said in 2005 that she had in mind something less sensational, although the Scottsboro case served &quot;the same purpose&quot; to display Southern prejudices. 
* Ellen Feldman&#x27;s &quot;Scottsboro: A Novel&quot; (2009) was shortlisted for the Orange Prize; it is a fictionalized account of the trial, told from the point of view of Ruby Bates and a fictional journalist, Alice Whittier.
* Richard Wright&#x27;s 1940 novel &quot;Native Son&quot; (New York: Harper, 1940) was influenced by the Scottsboro Boys case. There is a parallel between the court scene in &quot;Native Son&quot; in which Max calls the &quot;hate and impatience&quot; of &quot;the mob congregated upon the streets beyond the window&quot; (Wright 386) and the &quot;mob who surrounded the Scottsboro jail with rope and kerosene&quot; after the Scottsboro boys&#x27; initial conviction. (Maxwell 132)
* The poet Allen Ginsberg references the Scottsboro Boys in his poem &quot;America&quot;.
* The Harlem Renaissance poet Countee Cullen wrote about the injustice of the trial in his poem &quot;Scottsboro, Too, Is, Worth Its Song&quot;.

===Music===
* The American folk singer and songwriter Lead Belly commemorated the events in his song &quot;The Scottsboro Boys&quot;. In the song, he warns &quot;colored&quot; people to watch out if they go to Alabama, saying that &quot;the man gonna get ya&quot;, and that the &quot;Scottsboro boys [will] tell ya what it&#x27;s all about.&quot; In a spoken afterword to the 1938 recording of that song, Lead Belly warns people to &quot;stay woke&quot; when going through that area, which may be the first recorded instance of that phrase.
* Metal/Rap band Rage Against the Machine provides imagery of the Scottsboro Boys in their music video &quot;No Shelter&quot;, along with imagery of the executions of Sacco and Vanzetti, two men who were also denied a fair trial in court and were executed by authorities.

===Film and television===
* In 1976, NBC aired a TV movie called &quot;Judge Horton and the Scottsboro Boys&quot;, based on the case.
* In 1998, Court TV produced a television documentary on the Scottsboro trials for its &quot;Greatest Trials of All Time&quot; series. A premiere screening and discussion was held at Columbia University on July 21, 1998 in conjunction with the New York NAACP. On the panel was Columbia professor Manning Marable; James Meyerson, a former NAACP attorney responsible for one of the Scottsboro pardons; Jarvis Tyner, National Vice Chairman of the Communist Party USA; and Johnnie Cochran, prominent defense attorney and CourtTV anchor.
* Daniel Anker and Barak Goodman produced the story of the Scottsboro Boys in the 2001 documentary &quot;&quot;, which received an Oscar nomination.
* Timothy Hutton starred in a 2006 film adaptation titled &quot;Heavens Fall&quot;.

===Theater===
* Jean-Paul Sartre&#x27;s 1946 play &quot;The Respectful Prostitute&quot; (&quot;La Putain respectueuse&quot;), in which a Black man is wrongfully blamed for an incident on a train involving a white prostitute, is believed to have been based on the Scottsboro case.
* Utpal Dutta&#x27;s 1968 play মানুষের অধিকারে (The Rights of Man) was based on the Scottsboro trials.
*&quot;The Scottsboro Boys&quot; is a staged musical portrayal of the Scottsboro case. The show premiered Off Broadway in February 2010 and moved to Broadway&#x27;s Lyceum Theatre in October 2010. The show received good reviews, but closed on December 12, 2010. The musical opened in London&#x27;s Young Vic Theatre in 2013 before moving to the Garrick Theatre in October 2014.
*&quot;Direct from Death Row The Scottsboro Boys&quot;, a black ensemble vaudevillesque &quot;play with music and masks&quot; Mark Stein production, directed by Michael Menendian, and presented at Chicago&#x27;s Raven Theatre during the 2015 and 2016 seasons.

<text>Edwin Jack Fisher (August 10, 1928 – September 22, 2010) was an American singer and actor. He was one of the most popular artists during the 1950s, selling millions of records and hosting his own TV show, &quot;The Eddie Fisher Show&quot;. Actress Elizabeth Taylor was best friends with Fisher&#x27;s first wife, actress Debbie Reynolds. The couple divorced in 1959 when it was revealed shortly after Taylor&#x27;s third husband, Mike Todd, 
died in a plane crash, that she and Fisher had been having an affair. News of the affair was a great public scandal which led to the cancellation of Eddie Fisher&#x27;s television show. Fisher and Taylor married that same year. The unfavorable publicity was damaging to both Fisher and Taylor. Approximately five years later, Fisher divorced Taylor and he later married Connie Stevens. Fisher is the father of Carrie Fisher and Todd Fisher, whose mother is Reynolds, and the father of Joely Fisher and Tricia Leigh Fisher, whose mother is Stevens.

==Early life==
Fisher was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania on August 10, 1928, the fourth of seven children born to Gitte Kathrine &quot;Kate&quot; ( Minicker; 1901–1991) and Joseph Fisher ( Tisch; 1900–1972), both Ashkenazi Jewish immigrants from the Russian Empire. His father&#x27;s surname was originally Tisch, but was changed to Fisher by the time of the 1940 census. To his family, Fisher was always called &quot;Sonny Boy&quot;, a nickname derived from the song of the same name in Al Jolson&#x27;s film &quot;The Singing Fool&quot; (1928). His siblings were Sidney, Nettie, Miriam, Janet, Alvin, and Eileen. Kate and Joseph divorced when Fisher was an adult, after 33 years of marriage, and Kate married Max Stupp.

Fisher attended Thomas Junior High School, South Philadelphia High School, and Simon Gratz High School. It was known at an early age that he had talent as a vocalist, and he started singing in numerous amateur contests, which he usually won. He made his radio debut on WFIL, a local Philadelphia radio station. He also performed on &quot;Arthur Godfrey&#x27;s Talent Scouts&quot;, a popular radio show that later moved to television. Because he became a local star, Fisher dropped out of high school in the middle of his senior year to pursue his career.

==Career==
By 1946, Fisher was crooning with the bands of Buddy Morrow and Charlie Ventura. He was heard in 1949 by Eddie Cantor at Grossinger&#x27;s Catskill Resort Hotel in the Borscht Belt. Cantor&#x27;s so-called discovery of Fisher was later described as a totally contrived, &quot;manipulated&#x27; arrangement by Milton Blackstone, Grossinger&#x27;s publicity director. After performing on Cantor&#x27;s radio show he was an instant hit and gained nationwide exposure. He then signed a recording contract with RCA Victor and became their best selling pop artist.

Fisher was drafted into the U.S. Army in 1951, sent to Fort Hood, Texas, for basic training, and served a year in Korea. From 1952 to 1953, he was the official vocal soloist for the United States Army Band (Pershing&#x27;s Own) and a tenor section member in the United States Army Band Chorus (an element of Pershing&#x27;s Own) assigned at Fort Myer in the Washington, D.C. Military District. During his active duty period, he also made occasional guest television appearances, in uniform, introduced as &quot;PFC Eddie Fisher&quot;. After his discharge, he began to sing in top nightclubs and had a variety television series, &quot;Coke Time with Eddie Fisher&quot; on NBC (1953–1957). Fisher also appeared on &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot;, &quot;Club Oasis&quot;, &quot;The Martha Raye Show&quot;, &quot;The Gisele MacKenzie Show&quot;, &quot;The Chesterfield Supper Club&quot; and &quot;The George Gobel Show&quot;, and starred in another series, &quot;The Eddie Fisher Show&quot; (NBC) (1957–1959, alternating with Gobel&#x27;s series). 

Fisher&#x27;s good looks and strong, melodious tenor voice made him a teen idol and one of the most popular singers of the early 1950s. He had 17 songs in the Top 10 on the music charts between 1950 and 1956 and 35 in the Top 40. In 1953, &quot;Any Time&quot; became his first record to sell a million copies, followed soon after by &quot;I&#x27;m Walking Behind You&quot;. In 1957 he signed a then record $1 million deal with the newly opened Tropicana Las Vegas to appear there a minimum of 4 weeks a year for 5 years.

In 1956, Fisher costarred with then-wife Debbie Reynolds in the musical comedy &quot;Bundle of Joy&quot;. He played a dramatic role in the 1960 drama &quot;Butterfield 8&quot; with second wife Elizabeth Taylor. His best friend was showman and producer Mike Todd, who died in a plane crash in 1958. Fisher&#x27;s affair, divorce from Reynolds, and subsequent marriage to Taylor, Todd&#x27;s widow, caused a show business scandal. Due to the unfavorable publicity surrounding the affair and divorce, NBC canceled Fisher&#x27;s television series in March 1959.

Beginning in fall 1959, Fisher established two scholarships at Brandeis University, one for classical and one for popular music, in the name of Eddie Cantor.

In 1960, RCA Victor dropped him and he briefly recorded on his own label, Ramrod Records. He later recorded for Dot Records. During this time, he had the first commercial recording of &quot;Sunrise, Sunset&quot; from &quot;Fiddler on the Roof&quot;. This technically counts as the biggest standard Fisher can claim credit for introducing, although it is rarely associated with him. He also recorded the albums &quot;Eddie Fisher Today&quot; and &quot;Young and Foolish&quot; (both 1965). The Dot contract was not successful in record sales terms, and he returned to RCA Victor and had a minor single hit in 1966 with the song &quot;Games That Lovers Play&quot; with Nelson Riddle, which became the title of his best-selling album. When Fisher was at the height of his popularity, in the mid-1950s, singles, rather than albums, were the primary medium for issuing recordings. His last album for RCA Victor was an Al Jolson tribute, &quot;You Ain&#x27;t Heard Nothin&#x27; Yet&quot;, released in 1968. In 1983 he attempted a comeback tour but this was not a success. Eddie Fisher&#x27;s last released album was recorded around 1984 on the Bainbridge record label. Fisher tried to stop the album from being released, but it turned up as &quot;After All&quot;. The album was produced by William J. O&#x27;Malley and arranged by Angelo DiPippo. DiPippo, a world-renowned arranger, worked with Eddie countless hours to better his vocals, but it became futile. Fisher&#x27;s final recordings (never released) were made in 1995 with the London Philharmonic Orchestra. According to arranger-conductor Vincent Falcone, writing in his 2005 autobiography, &quot;Frankly: Just Between Us&quot;, these tracks were &quot;the best singing of his life&quot;. Fisher performed in top concert halls all over the United States and headlined in major Las Vegas showrooms. He headlined at the Palace Theater in New York City, as well as London&#x27;s Palladium. In the culmination of his return to the concert stage in 1962, Fisher headlined a five-week Broadway show at Winter Garden, calling it a dream of his since his youth to perform in the venue Al Jolson had made famous.

Fisher created interest as a pop culture icon. Betty Johnson&#x27;s &quot;I Want Eddie Fisher For Christmas&quot;, containing references to a number of hit songs, reached No. 28 in the Music Vendor national survey during an 11-week chart run in late 1954.

Fisher has two stars on the Hollywood Walk of Fame: one for recording, at 6241 Hollywood Boulevard, and one for television, at 1724 Vine Street.

==Personal life==
Fisher had five marriages and four children:
*Debbie Reynolds (September 26, 1955 – May 12, 1959; divorced)
**Carrie Fisher
**Todd Fisher
*Elizabeth Taylor (May 12, 1959 – March 5, 1964; divorced)
*Connie Stevens (February 9, 1967 – June 12, 1969; divorced)
**Joely Fisher
**Tricia Leigh Fisher
*Terry Richard (October 29, 1975 – April 1, 1976; divorced)
*Betty Lin (July 14, 1993 – April 15, 2001; her death)

In 1981, Fisher wrote an autobiography, &quot;Eddie: My Life, My Loves&quot; (). He wrote another autobiography in 1999 titled &quot;Been There, Done That&quot; (). The latter book devotes little space to Fisher&#x27;s singing career, but recycled the material of his first book and added many new sexual details that were too strong to publish before. Upon the book&#x27;s publication, his daughter Carrie declared: &quot;I&#x27;m thinking of having my DNA fumigated.&quot;

While performing at The Tropicana Hotel in 1957, Fisher had numerous affairs with women, which contributed to his turbulent marriage to Debbie Reynolds. One of his notable affairs was with model Pat Sheehan. They eventually parted ways after Fisher refused to divorce Reynolds. He would divorce Reynolds two years later and marry Elizabeth Taylor.

When she was interviewed, Debbie Reynolds said that she could understand being dumped &quot;for the world&#x27;s most beautiful woman&quot;, referring to Taylor, who was previously a close friend. Taylor and Reynolds later resumed their friendship and mocked Fisher in a TV movie written by Carrie Fisher, &quot;These Old Broads&quot;, in which their characters ridiculed the ex-husband they shared, named &quot;Freddie Hunter&quot;.

In his memoirs, Fisher admitted to addictions to drugs and gambling, which aggravated his career problems. He wrote that his addiction to drugs began in 1953 with the so-called &quot;vitamin&quot; shots administered by the notorious &quot;Dr. Feelgood&quot;, Max Jacobson, shots that contained methamphetamine. Fisher said he eventually kicked his drug addiction in 1990 after undergoing rehabilitation at the Betty Ford Clinic. In his autobiography, &quot;Been There, Done That&quot;, Fisher also claimed that following his separation from Taylor, he had numerous affairs with such women as Ann-Margret, Juliet Prowse, Stefanie Powers, Sue Lyon, Edie Adams, Judith Campbell, Mia Farrow, and Michelle Phillips. Phillips categorically denied Fisher&#x27;s claim that they had an affair.

Fisher supported Lyndon B. Johnson in the 1964 United States presidential election.

==Death==
Fisher suffered from knee, back, hearing, and eyesight problems in his later years, the last of which were worsened by complications stemming from cataract removal surgery, and he rarely appeared in public. According to friends, he remained mentally vigorous and kept himself busy watching television, following news and politics, and singing his old songs while friend George Michalski played the piano. Michalski had worked on several occasions over the years to help Fisher get his name back on the music charts. He said &quot;The &#x27;60s passed Eddie by; he missed that entire era of music. I&#x27;d play a Beatles song like &quot;Something&quot; for him and he&#x27;d think I wrote it.&quot;

Fisher fell and broke his hip on September 9, 2010, and died 13 days later on September 22, 2010, at his home in Berkeley, California, from complications from hip surgery, at the age of 82. His ashes were interred at Cypress Lawn Memorial Park next to his wife Betty Lin, who died in 2001.

<text>Decane is an alkane hydrocarbon with the chemical formula C10H22. Although 75 structural isomers are possible for decane, the term usually refers to the normal-decane (&quot;&quot;n&quot;-decane&quot;), with the formula CH3(CH2)8CH3. All isomers, however, exhibit similar properties and little attention is paid to the composition. These isomers are flammable liquids. Decane is present in small quantities (less than 1%) in gasoline (petrol) and kerosene. Like other alkanes, it is a nonpolar solvent, and does not dissolve in water, and is readily combustible. Although it is a component of fuels, it is of little importance as a chemical feedstock, unlike a handful of other alkanes.

==Reactions==
Decane undergoes combustion, just like other alkanes. In the presence of sufficient oxygen, it burns to form water and carbon dioxide.

:2 C10H22 + 31 O2 → 20 CO2 + 22 H2O
With insufficient oxygen, carbon monoxide is also formed.

It can be manufactured in the laboratory without fossil fuels.

==Physical properties==
It has a surface tension of 0.0238 N·m−1.

<text>The 15th United States Infantry Regiment is a parent regiment in the United States Army. It has a lineage tracing back to the American Civil War, having participated in many battles.

==Previous 15th Regiments==
The official Army history and lineage does not credit the current 15th Infantry with the honors or lineage of these earlier regiments.

The first 15th Infantry in the U.S. Army was organized on 16 July 1798 for the &quot;Quasi-War&quot; with France. The regiment saw no war service and was inactivated in 1800. A second 15th Infantry was activated in 1812 in New Jersey for service in Canada during the War of 1812. The 15th fought in the capture of Toronto and Fort George in April and May 1813, and covered the retreat of militia troops from Fort George in December 1813. A portion of the 15th were the last American troops to abandon Cornwall during the St. Lawrence Campaign of 1813. In this retreat, no member of the 15th was captured, despite taking heavy casualties. The 15th fought in the Champlain Valley campaign in autumn 1814 at Plattsburgh, and participated in General Dearborn&#x27;s offensive in Ontario in October, and took part in many smaller battles that same year. The regiment was eliminated in the Army reorganization of 1815.

On 11 February 1847, a new 15th Infantry was activated for service in Mexico. As companies of the 15th arrived at Vera Cruz, they moved inland to join General Winfield Scott&#x27;s army advancing on Mexico City. The regiment fought in the battles of Contreras and Churubusco, as well as smaller engagements before storming the walls of Chapultepec in Mexico City. Following garrison duty in Mexico City and Cuernavaca, the regiment returned to the United States for inactivation in August 1848.

== American Civil War ==
The current 15th Infantry was activated during the Civil War on 3 May 1861 by General Order No. 33. It was one of nine new Regular Army regiments, numbered 11 through 19, which were organized into three 8 company battalions. The battalions often operated independently of each other.

Its headquarters first in Wheeling, West Virginia then Cleveland, Ohio, then on to Newport Barracks, Kentucky and finally ending up in Fort Adams, Rhode Island in September 1862. Fort Adams served as the regiment&#x27;s training depot were new recruits were trained and organized into companies before being sent to the front lines.

At the Battle of Shiloh on 7 April 1862, the 15th Infantry was the first new infantry regiment to engage in battle in the Civil War. In April–May 1862, the regiment marched toward and fought in the First Battle of Corinth, Mississippi. By the end of the Civil War, the regiment had fought in 22 major engagements, including Murfreesboro, Chickamauga, Chattanooga, and Atlanta as a part of Brigadier General John H. King&#x27;s Brigade under Gen. Richard Johnson&#x27;s Division, XIV Army Corps of the Army of the Cumberland. The regiment was a key element of the only regular brigade in Sherman&#x27;s Army. The regiment&#x27;s crest includes the acorn, the symbol of the Major General George Thomas&#x27;s XIV Corps, and the mountains of stone to symbolize the corps&#x27; firm stand as the &quot;Rock of Chickamauga&quot;. The four acorns represent the four major engagements.

During the Civil War, the regiment was commanded by Colonel Fitz John Porter from May 1861 to January 1863. Porter spent little time in actual command of the regiment after its original organization, as he was promoted to brigadier general of volunteers in August 1861. Porter served as a division and corps commander in the Army of the Potomac until he was dismissed from service in January 1863. During Porter&#x27;s absence, the regiment was commanded by Lieutenant Colonel James P. Sanderson. Porter was succeed as regimental commander by Colonel Oliver L. Shepherd who served as such from January 1863 to December 1870.

==Reorganization==
In September 1866 the regiment was reorganized. The first battalion continued as the 15th Infantry and was expanded from 8 to 10 companies. The 2nd Battalion became the 24th Infantry Regiment (consolidated with the 29th Infantry in 1869 to form the 11th Infantry) and the 3rd Battalion became the 33rd Infantry Regiment (consolidated in 1869 with the 8th Infantry). In 1869 the 35th Infantry Regiment was consolidated with the 15th Infantry. (Note that the 24th Infantry Regiment mentioned above should not be confused with the African-American 24th Infantry Regiment which was formed in 1869 by the consolidation of the 38th and 41st Infantry Regiments.) 

== Reconstruction to Spanish–American War ==
Following the Civil War, the 15th Infantry served on occupation duty in Alabama until 1869. The regiment redeployed to the West, serving in Missouri, New Mexico, the Dakotas, and Colorado. The regiment remained in New Mexico for a little over 12 years. At the end of that time, the headquarters and six companies were sent to Ft. Lewis, Colorado; three companies to Fort Lyon, Colorado; with one company remaining in Santa Fe, New Mexico. In 1879 and 1880 the regiment was deeply involved in operations against the Mimbres Apaches under the warrior Victorio in New Mexico and received a campaign streamer for those operations.

In October and November 1882, the regiment was transferred to the Department of Dakota: Headquarters, A, C, D, and H Companies took station at Fort Randall, South Dakota; B and I Companies at Pembina, North Dakota; G and K Companies at Fort Lincoln, North Dakota; E and F Companies at Fort Stevenson, North Dakota.

=== Indian Wars ===
The 15th participated in campaigns against the Ute Tribe of Colorado and against the Mescalero Apaches. In May 1890, four companies proceeded to new posts in the Department of the East: A and G Companies moved to Mount Vernon Barracks, Alabama; D Company to Fort Barrancas, Florida; and K Company to Jackson Barracks, Louisiana. In July 1890 Companies I and K were skeletonized. Also in July, the headquarters and the five companies remaining in the Department of Dakota were assigned to Fort Sheridan, Illinois. In August, Companies E and H proceeded to Fort Sheridan. The regimental headquarters moved to Fort Sheridan in January 1891. The remaining companies from Dakota and the companies serving in the South completed their moves in May 1891. The final reconsolidation of all 15th Infantry companies after 12 years of being scattered throughout the West and South was concluded on 29 May 1891. While at Fort Sheridan the regiment played a vital role in containing the Chicago Railway Riots in July 1894.

The regiment remained as part of the Department of the Missouri until 15 October 1896, then served in the Department of Colorado from 19 October 1896 to 6 October 1898.

=== Spanish–American War ===
With the outbreak of the Spanish–American War in 1898, the regiment moved to Huntsville, Alabama, on 12 October for intensive training. On 27 November 1898, it sailed from Savannah, Georgia for Nuevitas, Cuba, for occupation duty. On 5 January 1900, the regiment sailed home to be posted throughout upper New York State and Vermont.

== Service in East Asia ==
The regimental headquarters, band, and First Battalion arrived in San Francisco on 16 July 1900. They immediately boarded the Transport &quot;Sumner&quot; and sailed for Nagasaki, Japan on 17 July. Later in July, Companies I, K, and L left their stations for San Francisco and went into camp at the Presidio. M Company also came from Fort McPherson at the same time. The First Battalion arrived at Nagasaki on 10 August. There they transferred to the Transport &quot;Indiana&quot;, and sailed for Tientsin via Taku on 13 August. The battalion arrived off of the Taku forts (already captured by the allies) on 16 August. During the latter part of the month, the Battalion reconnoitered and skirmished continuously over the same terrain where the 9th Infantry had lost 100 men killed in action (including their regimental commander, Colonel Liscum). Despite the fact that the Boxers had been dispersed several months before, numerous small bands of them were still operating in the country.

About 1 September, Companies A, B, and D were assigned the duty of escorting junks carrying supplies up the Pei Ho River to Peking. After completing this mission, Company C took station at Tientsin Arsenal on 6 September, while A Company occupied Tongku on 22 September. Through the latter part of November the battalion was engaged in almost daily expeditions against small bands of Boxers in nearby villages. On 25 November the First Battalion was relieved from duty with the China Relief Expedition and on 28 November arrived at Tongku. There it boarded the Transport &quot;Rosecrans&quot; and arrived at Nagasaki on 4 December, then continuing on to Manila, arriving on 13 December.

After lying at anchor in Manila Bay for eight days, the regiment sailed for Legaspi in the Province of Albay. On 24 December, Headquarters, the Band, and C and D Companies disembarked and took station at Legaspi. The transport continued to Tobacco, Albay, where B Company disembarked. Company A continued on to arrive at Mauban on 29 December. From then until 7 November 1901, the company conducted patrols to track the movement of the insurgent General Cailles. On 7 November, A Company moved to Bulan, Sorsogon and remained there until 28 December. It then moved on to the town of Sorsogon, in Sorsogon Province. It departed there on 5 March 1902 and arrived at Santa Elena, Samar on 11 March.

Company B remained at Tobacco until 30 July 1901, conducting patrols throughout that period. On 30 July B Company proceeded to the Island of Catanduanes. After five months of heavy scout work the company left for San Jose de Lagamoy, where it was engaged in tracking down bands of headhunters. On 31 July 1902 B Company returned to the regiment. C Company remained at Legaspi until 28 January 1902, when it left for the Island of Catanduanes. During the period 18 April to 31 July the company successively garrisoned Tabaco, Gubat, Santa Rita, Tones Island, Quentigean Island, and Balangigo. On 31 July it proceeded to Catbalogan and joined the regiment which was preparing to return to the United States. D Company remained on duty at Legaspi. Between 14 April and 31 July 1902 the company occupied Nueva Cacera (now Naga), Sorsogon, Bulan, and Point Binatao. On 31 July it left for the regimental assembly point at Catbalogan.

By April 1902, the balance of the regiment joined the 3rd Battalion in the Philippines and saw considerable action against the insurgents. The 2nd Battalion, which had remained in New York, did not appear in the Philippines until February 1902, just in time to turn around and return with its outfit in September to the United States. In September 1902 the regiment sailed for Monterey, California, where it built the current Presidio.

The next three years were uneventful. The unit placing seven men on the team of ten men from the Pacific Division in the Army&#x27;s annual rifle competition in 1905.

In November 1905, the regiment was posted to Mindanao in the Philippines. When the 15th returned to the U.S. in 1907, it was assigned to Fort Douglas, Utah. After 1907 the next change of station did not come for four years, but when it did come the 15th Infantry left the United States for twenty-six years. Before this removal, the regiment&#x27;s entrants won first, second and fourth honors in the individual competition, and five of its six contestants made the ten-man Army Rifle Team. The enlistments of 500 men had expired during 1908, and green recruits had filled the regiment at its home station in Utah and took part in a banquet given in their honor by the officers.

Elements of the regiment began to move to the Far East in November 1911. By mid-1912, Headquarters, the Band, and the 1st and 3rd Battalions were established at Tientsin in China as part of a multinational colonial effort designed to protect Western civilians during the Boxer Rebellion; the 2nd in the Philippines. The latter never joined the rest, for the men were transferred from it to the 1st Battalion of the 31st Infantry in August 1916. The 2nd Battalion was reorganized in Tientsin by transfer of personnel from the other two battalions. The mission of the regiment became difficult to define, and in the course of time the unit itself was transferred to the control of the State Department.

In line with new doctrine on organization, three provisional companies, Headquarters, Supply, and Machine Gun, were formed during August 1914, and in 1916 they were made permanent. That same year, World War I broke out in Europe, and most of the European nations withdrew their troops from China. The old &quot;China Regiment&quot; took over their patrolling. As a result, the regiment missed the fight in Europe, but it was often close to conflict in China. Armies of warlords roamed the land and sometimes threatened the American quarter. Christmas Day, 1925 was very tense, for 5,000 troops belonging to Feng Yuxiang, a warlord from the north, entered the area. Captain William &quot;Wild Bill&quot; Tuttle with nine men went out to warn off this force. As Tuttle&#x27;s detachment approached, the advanced guard of the mass deployed and came on with fixed bayonets. The nine Americans blocked the road while Tuttle proceeded alone toward the Chinese and ordered them to make a detour, which they did. This incident is described in great detail in &quot;The Old China Hands&quot; (Doubleday 1961, chap. 8) by Charles G. Finney, who served in the 15th Infantry from 1925 to 1929.

The 1st Battalion went to the Philippines in August 1921, where eight years later, it was deactivated. In 1932, Companies G and L were also deactivated. This left six companies at their stations in Tientsin. George C. Marshall, later General of the Army, commanded it from 1924 to 1927.

Much of the 15th Infantry&#x27;s tradition comes from the 26 years in China. The regiment&#x27;s activities and way of life in Tsientsin are described very colorfully in &quot;The Old China Hands&quot;. The dragon on the regimental crest and the pidgin English motto &quot;Can Do&quot; symbolize its China service. Also many of the ceremonial properties of the 15th are from China, for example, the grand silver punch bowl with 50 silver cups and a silver tray &amp; ladle. These items are currently stored in two regimental rooms, the Audie Murphy Room and General Marshall&#x27;s Office at Fort Stewart 3rd Battalion 15th Regiment. As Finney mentions, The Chinese Memorial Gate now at Fort Moore was presented to the regiment in 1925 by local villagers in gratitude for being protected against the troops of warlord Feng&#x27;s army.

The regiment left China on the transport &quot;Grant&quot; in February 1938.

== World War II, Korea and Cold War ==
After the USS Panay incident, the 15th Infantry left China for Fort Lewis, Washington, on 2 March 1938. On 12 January 1940, the regiment was assigned to the 3d Infantry Division. LTC Dwight D. Eisenhower served in the 15th from March to November 1940, as commander of 1st Battalion. On 24 October 1942, the 15th Infantry and the 3d Infantry Division sailed from Norfolk, Virginia, bound for French Morocco. For the next 31 months, the regiment fought through French North Africa, Sicily, Italy, France, and Germany. On 10 July the 15th Infantry starting in Sicily at Licata at h.2.57, the Allied invasion of Sicily, called Operation Husky, at Mollarella and Poliscia beaches. By the end of the war in Europe, the 15th Infantry had sixteen Medals of Honor recipients including Audie Murphy, the most decorated combat soldier of World War II. The 15th Infantry Regiment&#x27;s casualties during World War II included 1,633 killed, 5,812 wounded, and 419 missing in action.

;Korean War
On 1 December 1948, the 15th Infantry was transferred from occupation duty in Germany to Fort Benning, Georgia. As part of the 3d Infantry Division, the regiment sailed for Korea on 31 August 1950. The 15th Infantry covered the withdrawal of X Corps from Chosin Reservoir in 1950, fought north to the 38th parallel in 1951, and fought in the Kumsong sector until the armistice was signed in 1953. At the time of the truce, the regiment had seen action in eight major campaigns and added three more Medal of Honor recipients, Emory L. Bennett (24 June 1951), Ola L. Mize (10 June and 11 June 1953) and Charles F. Pendleton (16 July and 17 July 1953). The Belgian Contingent that served alongside the 15th Infantry at the &quot;Iron Triangle&quot;, borrowed its motto (&quot;Can Do&quot;), changing it to &quot;Belgians Can Do Too!&quot; for its own use.

;Cold War
On 3 December 1954, the 15th infantry returned to Fort Benning. In 1957, the Army reorganized combat forces from regiments and battalions to battle groups. 1st and 2nd Battle Groups, 15th Infantry (bearing the lineages of the former Companies A and B) were assigned to Bamberg, West Germany as part of the 3d Infantry Division. These units maintained their &quot;battle skills&quot; by several deployments to Grafenwoehr and Hohenfels training centers as well as several REFORGER exercises. Another Army-wide force reorganization in 1963 eliminated battle groups in favor of brigades and battalions and the units were relocated to Kitzingen and Wildflicken, In December 1965, the 3rd and 4th Battalions were inactivated.

The 15th Infantry regimental headquarters and the 3rd Battalion were reactivated at Fort Stewart, Georgia, on 25 August 1989, as part of the 24th Infantry Division. The 4th battalion was reactivated in May 1987 at Fort Knox, Kentucky, as part of the 194th Armored Brigade. The &quot;Can Do&quot; battalion, formerly the 4th Battalion, 54th Infantry, was the only infantry battalion at Fort Knox. The battalion served not only as a mechanized infantry battalion (equipped with M113A1/A2 armored personnel carriers, APCs), but also in support of the United States Army Armor School during various training missions.

== Post-Cold War ==
From 20 August 1990 through 22 March 1991, the 3rd Battalion participated in Operation Desert Shield and Operation Desert Storm, to free Kuwait from Iraqi oppression. In 1993, the 3rd Battalion deployed three companies to Mogadishu, Somalia, to conduct combat operations in Operations Restore and Continue Hope. In 1994, the 2nd Battalion deployed to Macedonia to deter Serbian aggression. In 1994 the 3rd Battalion deployed one company to Haiti to support Operation Uphold Democracy. In 1995 1st Battalion deployed to Macedonia to deter Serbian aggression.

The 1st Battalion colors were returned from Germany in 1996. The 1-18 IN was reflagged as 1-15 IN on 15 February 1996. The actual reflagging ceremony was held at Fort Stewart on 25 April 1996. The 2nd Battalion was inactivated in 1996.

From 2000 to 2001, 3rd Battalion, 15th Infantry deployed to Camp McGovern in Bosnia as an element of Task Force Eagle in support of Operation Joint Forge.

=== War on Terrorism ===

The 1st and 3rd Battalions deployed to Iraq with the 3d Infantry Division in 2003 and again in 2005–06, with one battalion falling under the 42nd Infantry Division. The 1st Battalion deployed to Iraq for the third time in March 2007. The 3rd Battalion was inactivated and reflagged the same year at Fort Stewart, Georgia. In 2009 the 3rd Battalion was reactivated at Fort Stewart. The 1st Battalion deployed to Iraq in 2009 assuming responsibility for operations in ad-Diwaniyah and an-Najaf for Operation Iraqi Freedom VII and Operation New Dawn.

In early 2013, nearly all of 3rd Battalion deployed to Wardak Province, Afghanistan operating from Combat Outpost Soltan Kheyl and FOB Airborne. The unit suffered five casualties.

On 15 December 2015, the 1st Battalion at Fort Moore was inactivated.

The last remaining unit is the 3rd Battalion located at Fort Stewart in 2nd Brigade, 3rd Infantry Division. 3rd Battalion was the home of one of a small number of Special Reconnaissance Platoons created to better bridge the gap between conventional forces and Special Forces.

==Insignia==
The shield is of white and blue, the old and the new colors of the Infantry. The Red Acorn was the badge of XIV Army Corps under which the 15th Infantry fought during the Civil war. The acorn is repeated four times to commemorate the four major engagements in which the regiment participated: Murfreesboro, Chickamauga, Chattanooga, and Atlanta. The rock denotes the fact that the regiment was under the Command of General George Henry Thomas for the battle in which he earned his famous sobriquet: &quot;The Rock of Chickamauga&quot;. The Chinese dragon, in gold metal, is indicative of the regiment&#x27;s service in China during the Boxer Rebellion from 1900 to 1938, of which the period after 1912 was continuous. The sunburst, triangle, and devices atop the coat of arms is symbolic of the Katipunan flag of the Philippine Insurrection.

The coat of arms was approved on 30 April 1923. It was amended to correct the blazon of the shield and crest on 14 July 1924.

<text>Undecane (also known as hendecane) is a liquid alkane hydrocarbon with the chemical formula CH3(CH2)9CH3. It is used as a mild sex attractant for various types of moths and cockroaches, and an alert signal for a variety of ants. It has 159 isomers.

Undecane may also be used as an internal standard in gas chromatography when working with other hydrocarbons. Since the boiling point of undecane (196 °C) is well known, it may be used as a comparison for retention times in a gas chromatograph for molecules whose structure has been freshly elucidated. For example, if one is working with a 50 m crosslinked methyl silicone capillary column with an oven temperature increasing slowly, beginning around 60 °C, an 11-carbon molecule like undecane may be used as an internal standard to be compared with the retention times of other 10-, 11-, or 12- carbon molecules, depending on their structures.

<text>Peter and the Wolf () Op. 67, a &quot;symphonic tale for children&quot;, is a programmatic musical composition written by Sergei Prokofiev in 1936. The narrator tells a Russian folk tale, which the orchestra illustrates by using different instruments to play a &quot;theme&quot; that represents each character in the story.
==Background==
In 1936, Prokofiev was commissioned by Natalya Sats, the director of the Central Children&#x27;s Theatre in Moscow, to write a musical symphony for children. Sats and Prokofiev had become acquainted after he visited her theatre with his sons several times. The intent was to introduce children to the individual instruments of the orchestra to enjoy music and learn to recognize musical keys.

The first draft of the libretto was about a Young Pioneer called Peter who rights a wrong by challenging an adult. However, Prokofiev was dissatisfied with the rhyming text produced by (real name Antonia Pavlovna Sokolovskaya, 1896–1951), a then-popular children&#x27;s author. Prokofiev wrote a libretto in which Peter and his animal friends capture a wolf. As well as promoting desired Pioneer virtues such as vigilance, bravery, and resourcefulness, the plot illustrates Soviet themes such as the stubbornness of the un-Bolshevik older generation (the grandfather) and the triumph of Man (Peter) taming Nature (the wolf).

Prokofiev produced a version for the piano in under a week, finishing it on April 15. The orchestration was finished on April 24. The work premiered at a children&#x27;s concert in the main hall of the Moscow Conservatory with the on 2 May 1936. However, Sats was ill, the substitute narrator was inexperienced, and the performance attracted little attention. Later that month, a more successful performance with Sats narrating was given at the Moscow Pioneers Palace. The American premiere took place in March 1938, with Prokofiev conducting the Boston Symphony Orchestra at Symphony Hall, Boston, and with Richard Hale narrating. By that time, Sats was serving a sentence in the gulag, where she was sent after her lover, Marshal Mikhail Tukhachevsky, was shot in June 1937.

==Synopsis==
Peter, a young Soviet pioneer, lives at his grandfather&#x27;s home in a forest clearing. One day, Peter goes out into the clearing, leaving the garden gate open, and a duck that lives in the yard takes the opportunity to swim in a pond nearby. The duck and a bird argue over whether a bird should be able to swim or fly. A local cat stalks them quietly, and the bird—warned by Peter—flies to safety in a tall tree while the duck swims to safety in the middle of the pond.

Peter&#x27;s grandfather scolds him for staying outside and playing in the meadow alone, because a wolf might attack him. When Peter shows defiance, believing he has nothing to fear from wolves, his grandfather takes him back into the house and locks the gate. Soon afterwards, a ferocious wolf comes out of the forest. The cat quickly climbs into the tree with the bird, but the duck, who has jumped out of the pond, is chased, overtaken, and swallowed by the beast.

Seeing all of this from inside, Peter fetches a rope and climbs over the garden wall into the tree. He asks the bird to fly around the beast&#x27;s head to distract him, while he lowers a noose and catches the wolf by his tail. The beast struggles to get free, but Peter ties the rope to the tree and the noose only gets tighter.

Hunters who have been tracking the wolf come out of the forest with their guns readied, but Peter gets them to instead help him take it to a zoo in a victory parade (the piece was first performed for an audience of Young Pioneers during May Day celebrations) that includes himself, the bird, the hunters leading the wolf, the cat, and lastly his grumbling Grandfather, still disappointed that Peter ignored his warnings, but proud that his grandson caught the beast.

At the end, the narrator states that careful listeners could hear the duck still quacking inside the wolf&#x27;s belly, because he was swallowed whole.

==Performance directions==
Prokofiev produced detailed performance notes in English and Russian. According to the English version:

==Instrumentation==
&quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; is scored for an orchestra:
*Woodwinds: a flute, an oboe, a clarinet in A, and a bassoon
*Brass: 3 horns in F, a trumpet in B and a trombone
*Percussion: timpani, a triangle, a tambourine, cymbals, castanets, a snare drum, and a bass drum
*Strings: first and second violins, violas, violoncellos, and double basses

Each character in the story has a particular instrument and musical theme:

A performance lasts about 25 minutes.

==Recordings==
Jeremy Nicholas wrote for classical music magazine &quot;Gramophone&quot; in 2015, claiming that the best overall recording of &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; was by the New Philharmonia Orchestra, narrated by Richard Baker and conducted by Raymond Leppard in 1971. &quot;Gramophone&quot;″s best DVD version is the 2006 film by Suzie Templeton; its music is performed, without narrator, by the Philharmonia Orchestra conducted by Mark Stephenson.
==Adaptations==
===Walt Disney, 1946===

Prokofiev, while touring the West in 1938, visited Los Angeles and met Walt Disney. Prokofiev performed the piano version for &quot;&quot;le papa de&quot; Mickey Mouse&quot; (French for &quot;Mickey Mouse&#x27;s dad&quot;), as Prokofiev described him in a letter to his sons. Disney was impressed, and considered adding an animated version of &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; to &quot;Fantasia&quot;, which was to be released in 1940. Due to World War II, these plans fell through, and it was not until 1946 that Disney released his adaptation, narrated by Sterling Holloway. It is not known whether Prokofiev, who was by that point behind the Iron Curtain, was aware of this. It was released theatrically as a segment of &quot;Make Mine Music&quot;, then reissued the next year, accompanying a reissue of &quot;Fantasia&quot; (as a short subject), then separately on home video in the 1990s. This version made several changes to the original, including:
* During the character introduction, the pets are given names: Sasha the songbird, Sonia the duck, and Ivan the cat.
* As the production begins, Peter and his friends already know that a wolf is nearby and are preparing to catch him.
* The hunters get names later in the story: Misha, Yasha, and Vladimir.
* Peter daydreams of hunting and catching the wolf, and for that purpose exits the garden carrying a wooden pop gun.
* At the end, in a reversal of the original (and to make the story more child-friendly), the narrator reveals that Sonia had been eaten by the wolf. Earlier in the film, the wolf is shown chasing Sonia, who hides in a tree&#x27;s hollow trunk. The wolf attacks out of view and returns in view with feathers in his mouth, licking his jaws. Peter, Ivan, and Sasha assume Sonia has been eaten. After the wolf is caught, Sasha is shown mourning Sonia. She comes out of the tree trunk at that point, and they are happily reunited.

In 1957, for one of his television programs, Disney recalled how Prokofiev had visited, inspiring Disney&#x27;s animated version. Disney used pianist Ingolf Dahl, who resembled Prokofiev, to re-create how the composer had played the themes from the score.

===British–Polish co-production, 2006===
In 2006, Suzie Templeton and Hugh Welchman directed and produced, respectively, a stop-motion animated adaptation. It is unusual in its lack of dialogue or narration. The story was told only via images and music and interrupted by sustained periods of silence. The soundtrack was performed by the Philharmonia Orchestra, The film premiered with a live accompaniment in the Royal Albert Hall. The film won the Annecy Cristal and the Audience Award at the 2007 Annecy International Animated Film Festival, and the 2007 Academy Award for Best Animated Short Film. This version makes some changes to the original Prokofiev story, including:
* Peter bumps into one of the &quot;hunters&quot; (teenage bullies in this telling), who throws him in a rubbish bin and aims at him with his rifle to scare him; the second hunter watches without interfering (thus, a dislike towards the hunter/bullies is immediately created).
* Because of a broken wing, the bird has trouble flying and takes Peter&#x27;s balloon to help it get aloft.
* Peter captures the wolf in a net and then the hunter gets him in his rifle&#x27;s sight coincidentally, but just before shooting, the second hunter stumbles, falls on him and makes him miss the shot.
* The caged wolf is brought into the village on a cart, where Peter&#x27;s grandfather tries to sell it. The hunter comes to the container and sticks his rifle in to intimidate the animal (as he did with Peter earlier on). At that time Peter throws the net on the hunter, entangling the hunter.
* Before the grandfather has made a deal, Peter unlocks the cart after looking into the eyes of the wolf. They walk side by side through the awestruck crowd and then the freed wolf runs away in the direction of the silver moon shining over the forest.

===Others===

====Up to 1959====
* In 1958, a videotaped television special entitled &quot;Art Carney Meets Peter and the Wolf&quot;, starring Carney, along with the Bil Baird Marionettes, was presented by the American Broadcasting Company, and was successful enough to be twice rebroadcast. The show had an original storyline in which Carney interacted with talking marionette animals, notably the troublemaking wolf. This first half was presented as a musical, with adapted music from &quot;Lieutenant Kijé&quot; and other Prokofiev works that had English lyrics fitted to them. The program then segued into a complete performance of &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;, performed as written by the composer, and &quot;mimed&quot; by both &quot;human&quot; and &quot;animal&quot; marionettes. The conclusion featured Carney interacting with the animal marionettes. The show was nominated for three Emmy Awards.

====1960s====
* , Hans Conried recorded the narration with a Dixieland musical band. Because a Dixieland band uses different instruments from an orchestra, Peter was represented by the trumpets, the Bird by a clarinet, the Duck by a banjo, the Cat by a &quot;cool cat&quot; tenor saxophone, the Wolf by a tuba, the Hunters by the percussive ensemble, and Grandfather by a slide trombone. The characters of the Bee and the Flea are briefly introduced to demonstrate the &quot;versatility of our chief percussionist&quot; (played by a xylophone and glockenspiel, respectively).
* The Clyde Valley Stompers recorded a jazz version in 1962, which registered on the popular music charts.
* Allan Sherman parodied the work in the album &quot;Peter and the Commissar&quot; (1964), made with Arthur Fiedler and the Boston Pops Orchestra.
* In 1966, Hammond organ player Jimmy Smith performed for a jazz album arranged by Oliver Nelson without the narration, but based on the original themes.
* In 1969, American-Canadian filmmaker Caroline Leaf used sand animation to adapt the work in &quot;Sand or Peter and the Wolf&quot;, her first film.

====1980s====
* Ray Bolger served as the narrator for a 1981 live-action version with live animals, directed by Dan Bessie and produced by Pyramid Media. The music was performed by the Santa Cruz Chamber Orchestra conducted by Dr. Lewis Keizer.
* The 1983 film &quot;A Christmas Story&quot; features music from &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; during scenes of the character Scut Farkus bullying other characters. The surname Farkus is a variation of &quot;&quot;, which is Hungarian for &quot;wolf&quot;.
* In 1985, Arnie Zane choreographed a punk music ballet version.
* In 1988, &quot;Weird Al&quot; Yankovic and Wendy Carlos produced a comedic version, using a synthesized orchestra and many additions to the story and music (e.g., Peter captures the wolf using his grandfather&#x27;s dental floss, leading to the moral of the story: &quot;Oral hygiene is very important&quot;).
* In 1989, in an episode of the &quot;Muppet Babies&quot; entitled &quot;Skeeter and the Wolf&quot;, Skeeter fills in for Peter, Gonzo is the bird, Scooter is the cat, Fozzie is the duck, Nanny is the grandparent, and Kermit and Piggy are the hunters.

====1990s====
* A 1990 episode of &quot;Tiny Toon Adventures&quot; titled &quot;Buster and the Wolverine&quot; featured Elmyra Duff providing narration for a story wherein Buster Bunny and his friends, represented with musical instruments, combat an evil &quot;wolverine&quot;. In this episode, the characters&#x27; instruments are: Buster Bunny, a trumpet; Babs Bunny, a harp; Furrball, a violin; Sweetie, a flute; Hamton J. Pig, a tuba; Plucky Duck, a bike horn (later, bagpipes, then an organ, and finally a synthesizer); and the wolverine, drums.
* Peter Schickele (a.k.a. P. D. Q. Bach) wrote an alternate, comedic libretto entitled &quot;Sneaky Pete and the Wolf&quot;, converting the story into a Western, including a showdown between Sneaky Pete and the gunslinger El Lobo (which never happens due to some local boys&#x27; giving El Lobo a hotfoot and sticking a paper airplane in his eye, and Sneaky Pete&#x27;s girlfriend Laura rendering El Lobo unconscious with a vacuum cleaner). It was recorded with the Atlanta Symphony Orchestra, conducted by Yoel Levi, in 1993.
* In the 1993 &quot;Simpsons&quot; episode &quot;Krusty Gets Kancelled&quot;, guest star Hugh Hefner plays a portion of &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; on wine glasses.
* In 1995, a 45-minute television special was made with a mix of live-action, animation, and characters from the story, designed by Chuck Jones. The film featured Kirstie Alley (as the narrator), Lloyd Bridges (as the grandfather), and Ross Malinger (as Peter), in a live-action &quot;wraparound&quot; segment. The version debuted on ABC on 8 December 1995. This version keeps the duck-friendly ending by having the swallowed duck pop out of the wolf&#x27;s mouth alive, well, and dancing as the wolf is captured. The wolf, described as &quot;not a ballet fan&quot;, grabs the duck again before the hunters force him to drop her. As the story ends, Peter finds the duck crouching at the pond&#x27;s edge, shivering and frightened because of her terrible experience, and Peter reassures her that he will always protect her. This version places the bird as a mother, with six eggs that hatch near the ending. The music was performed by the RCA Victor Symphony Orchestra, conducted by George Daugherty. The version received a 1996 Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Children&#x27;s Program and received a second Emmy nomination for Daugherty, for Outstanding Music Direction. Daugherty (also one of the writers) and Janis Diamond received a Writers Guild of America Award nomination for the script. The production received a Gold Hugo and Silver Hugo at Chicago International Film Festival.
* During September 1996, Coldcut (a duo of scratch/mix DJs from south London) released a scratch version of the main theme, included on the track &quot;More Beats + Pieces&quot;, from their album &quot;Let Us Play!&quot;.
*Matthew Hart choreographed &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; for television in 1997, performed by the dancers of the Royal Ballet School and narrated by Sir Anthony Dowell (who also danced the role of &quot;The Grandfather&quot;).

====2000s====
* In 2001, National Public Radio produced &quot;Peter and the Wolf: A Special Report&quot;, which treated the plot as if it were a developing news story. Robert Siegel, Linda Wertheimer, Ann Taylor, and Steve Inskeep of NPR&#x27;s &quot;All Things Considered&quot; report on the event against a performance of the score by the Virginia Symphony Orchestra conducted by JoAnn Falletta.
* Sesame Workshop produced a version with &quot;Sesame Street&quot; characters in 2000, as told by way of a trip to a Boston Pops Orchestra concert. Dubbed &quot;Elmo&#x27;s Musical Adventure&quot;, the story unfolds inside Baby Bear&#x27;s imagination as he attends a performance with Papa Bear, conducted by Keith Lockhart. In the story, Peter was represented by Elmo, the cat by Oscar the Grouch, the duck by Telly Monster, the bird by Zoe, the grandfather by Big Bird, and the hunters by the Two-Headed Monster. Each character is followed around by a soloist playing that character&#x27;s instrument, but Telly Monster&#x27;s &quot;Duck&quot; quits the story after learning the wolf eats the duck. (He later returns as one of the hunters.)
* In February 2004, Bill Clinton, Mikhail Gorbachev, and Sophia Loren won a Grammy Award for Best Spoken Word Album for Children for narrating the album &quot;Peter and the Wolf/Wolf Tracks&quot;. The music was performed by the Russian National Orchestra conducted by Kent Nagano and included Loren narrating &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; and Clinton narrating &quot;The Wolf and Peter&quot; by Jean-Pascal Beintus, which is another narrated orchestral piece, but the story is told from the perspective of the wolf and has the theme of letting animals live in peace.
* In 2004, Russian model Tatiana Sorokko narrated an arrangement of Beintus&#x27; &quot;Wolf Tracks&quot; with musicians from the Russian National Orchestra while on a US tour.
* In 2004, the Shirim Klezmer Orchestra recorded a klezmer version, called &quot;Pincus and the Pig: A Klezmer Tale&quot;. The recording was narrated by Maurice Sendak and featured his illustrations.
* In 2006, Neil Tobin produced a Halloween-themed narrative called &quot;Peter and the Werewolf&quot; with the Melbourne Symphony Orchestra, John Lanchbery conducting.
* In 2009, musical group Project Trio released their second studio album, &quot;Brooklyn&quot;, on which a modernized version of the story was recorded. All three members narrate.

====2010s====
* In 2010, Denver musicians Munly and the Lupercalians released &quot;Petr &amp; the Wulf&quot;, an alternative take told from the perspectives of each character: Grandfater, Petr, Scarewulf, Cat, Bird, The Three Hunters, Duk, and Wulf. Released on the Alternative Tentacles label.
* In 2012, ITV used a version of the main theme as the title music for their coverage of the European Football Championships, because Prokofiev was born in present-day Ukraine, one of the host countries.
* In 2019, composer Lior Navok released &quot;Brave Little Timmy&quot; for narrator and orchestra (same instrumentation as &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot;). The libretto, written by the composer, tells the story of Timmy, whose distant friendship with a wolf saved the latter from the hunters.
====2020s====
* In 2023, Gavin Friday, with directors Elliot Dear and Stephen McNally (musician) released an animated version based on Bono&#x27;s drawings on Max. This adaptation, narrated by Friday, alters the story slightly: Peter had lost his mother to an unspecified illness, implied to be cancer. The Wolf has puppies, one of whom reminds Peter of himself, and thus the Wolf reminds him of his late mother. Peter and his grandfather deceive the hunters and release the Wolf. The black and white short film and its theme song by Friday, &quot;There&#x27;s Nothing To Be Afraid Of&quot;, support the Irish Hospice Foundation.

==In copyright law==
In the United States, the US Supreme Court&#x27;s decision in 2012 in &quot;Golan v. Holder&quot; restored copyright protection in the United States to numerous foreign works that had entered the public domain. &quot;Peter and the Wolf&quot; was frequently cited by the parties and amici, as well as by the Court&#x27;s opinion and by the press, as an example of a well-known work that would be removed from the public domain by the decision. The restored copyright per current law is 95 years after publication. Therefore the piece is expected to enter the public domain on December 31, 2031. 

In many other countries, the piece is already in the public domain.

<text>The American Forces Network (AFN) is a government television and radio broadcast service the U.S. military provides to those stationed or assigned overseas, and is headquartered at Fort Meade in Maryland. AFN comprises two subordinate overseas commands and one directorate in the continental United States. Overseas, AFN Europe is headquartered at Sembach Kaserne in Germany and consists of 15 subordinate stations in the countries of Bahrain, Belgium, Cuba, Germany, Greece, Italy, Spain, and Turkey. AFN Pacific is headquartered at Yokota Air Base in Japan and consists of nine stations in Diego Garcia, Japan, and South Korea. Stations under AFN Europe and AFN Pacific broadcast live local radio shows 12 hours a day Monday through Friday, with the exception of U.S. federal holidays. Stateside, AFN&#x27;s broadcast operations, which include global radio and television satellite feeds, emanate from the AFN Broadcast Center/Defense Media Center at March Air Reserve Base in Riverside, California.

==History==
What is today the Maryland-based headquarters of the American Forces Network began on 26 May 1942 when the War Department established the Armed Forces Radio Service (AFRS) in Los Angeles, California with U.S. Army Colonel Tom Lewis in command. The original American Forces Network began on 4 July 1943 when AFRS established what is today AFN Europe in London, England with U.S. Army Lieutenant Colonel Charles Gurney in command. A television service was first introduced in 1954 with a pilot station at Limestone Air Force Base, Maine. In 1954, the television mission of AFRS was officially recognized and AFRS (Armed Forces Radio Service) became AFRTS (Armed Forces Radio and Television Service).

All the Armed Forces broadcasting affiliates worldwide merged under the AFN banner on 1 January 1998. On 21 November 2000, the American Forces Information Service directed a change of the AFRTS organizational title from Armed Forces Radio and Television Service to American Forces Radio and Television Service. A timeline of the history of AFN is available online.

===Origins===
The first station to be under the control of the U.S. Armed Forces was KGEI in San Francisco, whose origins come from a GE exhibit, which in February 1939 started shortwave broadcasts aimed at the Philippines, which at the time were under American control. The station was used as a counterpoint to Radio Tokyo and ultimately became a model for the army network following the invasion of Pearl Harbor in late 1941.

The first radio station began in Delta Junction, Alaska, on what was then known as Fort Greely. It was called KODK and was operated by on base personnel. In the years just before World War II, there were several radio stations based in American military bases, but none were officially recognized until 1942. The success of these individual radio stations helped pave the way for the AFN. As such, there was no single station that could be called the &quot;first&quot; to sign on as an AFN station. About two months before the formal establishment of AFN, however, a station called &quot;PCAN&quot; began regular broadcast information service in the Panama Canal Zone, primarily for troops on jungle bivouac. The station, located at Fort Clayton, was later to become part of AFRS, first simply as &quot;Armed Forces Network&quot; located at Albrook Field.

===World War II===

The original AFN - present day AFN Europe - began broadcasting from London during World War II, using equipment and studio facilities borrowed from the British Broadcasting Corporation (BBC).

The first transmission to U.S. troops began at 5:45 p.m. 4 July 1943, and included less than five hours of recorded shows, including a BBC News and sports broadcast. That day, T5 Syl Binkin became the first U.S. military broadcaster heard over the air. The signal was sent from London via telephone lines to five regional transmitters to reach U.S. troops in the United Kingdom as they made preparations for the invasion of Nazi-occupied Europe.

Fearing competition for civilian audiences, the BBC initially tried to impose restrictions on AFN broadcasts within Britain (transmissions were allowed only from American bases outside London and were limited to 50 watts of transmission power) and a minimum quota of British produced programming had to be carried. Nevertheless, AFN programs were widely enjoyed by the British civilian listeners who could receive them, and once AFN operations transferred to continental Europe (shortly after D-Day) AFN was able to broadcast with little restriction with programs available to civilian audiences across most of Europe, (including Britain), after dark.

As D-Day approached, the network joined with the BBC and the Canadian Broadcasting Corporation to develop programs especially for the Allied Expeditionary Forces. Mobile stations, complete with personnel, broadcasting equipment and a record library, were deployed to broadcast music and news to troops in the field. The mobile stations reported on front-line activities and fed the news reports back to studio locations in London.

Although the network&#x27;s administrative headquarters remained in London, its operational headquarters soon moved to Paris.

As Allied forces continued to push German troops back into their homeland, AFN moved east as well. The liberation of most of Western Europe saw AFN stations serving the forces liberating Biarritz, Cannes, Le Havre, Marseille, Nice, Paris and Reims.

During the period between 1943 and 1949 the AFN also broadcast programs developed through a collaboration of the Department of State&#x27;s Office of the Coordinator of Inter-American Affairs and the CBS network while supporting America&#x27;s cultural diplomacy initiatives. Included among the programs was &quot;Viva America&quot; which showcased leading musical talents from both North and South America and was transmitted for the benefit of armed forces throughout Europe and to South America over CBS&#x27;s short wave network &quot;La Cadena de Las Americas&quot;.

===Post-war contraction and expansion===
On 10 July 1945, the first AFN station in occupied Germany started broadcasting: AFN Munich. Its first broadcast was however incorrect as it began with the sentence &quot;Good morning! This is AFN Munich, the voice of the 7th Army!&quot;. General George S. Patton, commander of the 3rd Army, was furious with the opening as his army had taken control over Munich the previous night, and demanded that the responsible person be court-martialed.

Soon after AFN Munich signed on the air in the southern part of occupied Germany, in northern Germany, AFN Bremen begin broadcasting a few weeks later with its first radio broadcast occurring on Saturday, 28 July 1945. (In 1949, the station moved from the city of Bremen north to the port city of Bremerhaven and became AFN Bremerhaven.)

On 31 December 1945, AFN London signed off the air, and in 1948 AFN closed all its stations in France. This started the cycle of AFN stations where they would be built up during wartime, then torn down or moved after the war was over. Of the 300 stations in operation worldwide in 1945, only 60 remained in 1949.

===Post-War Europe===
A large number of AFN stations continued broadcasting from American bases in Europe (particularly Germany) after World War II. (Eight remain on the air today. See article on German Wikipedia.)

During the Berlin Blockade of 1948–1949, planes headed for Tempelhof in West Berlin tuned their radios to AFN-Berlin because the station&#x27;s transmission tower was in the glide path to the airfield and was not jammed by the Soviets.

During the 1950s and 1960s, AFN had large civilian audiences in Europe, as European radio stations rarely played American music. In Communist countries, all radio stations were state-operated, and never played American music. Despite the language barrier, the people in those countries saw AFN as an alternative connection to the West. Also, unlike stations such as Radio Free Europe, which broadcast in Eastern European languages, AFN was not jammed by the Soviets.

Especially popular was &quot;Music in the Air&quot;, which aired on the full European network at 19:00 CET. The host was AFN Frankfurt (civilian) manager John Vrotsos, who had an especially warm baritone voice. He began each program by saying (after an introductory piano phrase from the program&#x27;s theme music) &quot;Listen ... [pause for more piano] ... there&#x27;s music in the air&quot;. The theme was &quot;Music Everywhere&quot; in an arrangement by Victor Young. Later in the 1950s, Leroy Anderson&#x27;s &quot;Belle of the ball&quot; was used. The program was popular throughout Northern Europe, especially in the liberated countries such as the Netherlands, Belgium, France (the northern part), Luxembourg and, to a lesser extent, Denmark. Many Dutch households switched to the program, also because of their positive experiences with the American liberators.
Also featured were live performances of classical music and jazz by Samuel Hans Adler&#x27;s Seventh Army Symphony Orchestra in support of America&#x27;s cultural diplomacy initiatives in the post war period.

In France, about a dozen AFN stations operated, with AFN Orléans as the studio control station. The network broadcast music, shows, and news relayed from AFN Frankfurt, locally produced shows, and other features aimed at the American soldiers and their families stationed in France. In particular, a whole team of reporters and technicians was sent to cover the 24-hour auto race at Le Mans, at a time when Ford was doing its best to beat the Ferraris, and finally succeeded. AFN France broadcast with 50 watt FM transmitters made by French manufacturer TRT, type OZ 305. The network employed a technical director, a program director, several military American broadcast professionals, and some French studio operators, record librarians, secretaries and maintenance technicians. The Frankfurt network programming was received, then re-fed from AFN Orléans studios to another studio-equipped affiliate, AFN Poitiers and its repeater transmitters via modulation lines rented from the French postal service. AFN Poitiers, based at Aboville Caserne, Poitiers, France, home of an Army logistical command and a major Communication Zone Signal Corps agency, served Army depots and installations in Southwestern France with locally originated programs and network feeds from AFN Orléans via Frankfurt, Germany. It was the only other studio station affiliate of AFN Orléans because of the large American military presence and its resident Department of Defense dorm school for children of American military and civilian families assigned to Poitiers, and the American installations located throughout Southwestern France. Children living in outlying American military installations and communities commuted to Poitiers once a week for daily classes and departed for home by bus and train. AFN France was dismantled in 1967, when U.S. forces left France due to the French government&#x27;s decision of President (General) Charles de Gaulle to withdraw its forces from NATO&#x27;s military command. The French employees were dismissed but were granted a severance pay (in French francs and taxable) of one month per year of service, paid by the U.S. Army to the French government, in dollars (all the French employees were managed by a specially created service: le Bureau d&#x27;Aide aux Armées Alliées or AAA).

===Korean War===
When war broke out in Korea, Army broadcasters set up in Seoul in the Banto Hotel (the old American Embassy Hotel). When the Chinese entered Seoul in December 1950, the crew moved to a mobile unit that was just completed and retreated to Daegu. Due to the large number of American troops in Korea, a number of stations were started. Mobile units followed combat units to provide news and entertainment on the radio. By the time the 1953 armistice was signed, these mobile units became buildings with transmitters, and a network, American Forces Korea Network, was born.

Canadian and American television personality Jim Perry began his broadcasting career fresh out of high school with the Armed Forces Korea Network, under his birthname of Jim Dooley, spending one year in Korea before attending the University of Pennsylvania to further his education.

===Pahlavi Iran===
An AFRTS radio station became operational in Tehran, Iran in 1959. This was followed by a television station in 1960, known as AFTV. It broadcast a radio service on 1555 kHz and a television service on Channel 7 in Tehran and the surrounding area from its studios in the city.

Its listeners (and viewers) were American military personnel stationed in Iran as part of ARMISH (the US Army mission) and Military Assistance Advisory Group (MAAG) programs. AFTV was also popular with Iranian viewers, particularly children.

As the TV service only had a power of 1000 watts, it was only on air for a few hours each day, whereas the radio service operated for around 18 hours a day. In deference to Iranian sensitivities, AFRTS avoided carrying programming that might be construed as offensive on political or religious grounds, instead carrying cowboy or detective movies.

Following the nationalization of the privately owned Television Iran network in 1969, AFTV was the only television service not in the Iranian government&#x27;s hands. However, in 1976, it was decided by the Iranian government that AFRTS should close down its radio and TV services, which it did on 25 October of that year, the day before the Shah&#x27;s 57th birthday.

Radio 1555 closed with presenter Air Force Staff Sergeant Barry Cantor playing Roger Whittaker&#x27;s &quot;Durham Town (The Leavin&#x27;)&quot;. This was followed by a closing announcement by Chief Master Sergeant and Station Manager Bob Woodruff, ending with the U.S. national anthem:

Ladies and Gentlemen, I&#x27;m Chief Master Sergeant Bob Woodruff Station Manager of the American Forces Radio and Television Service in Tehran. After 22 years of radio broadcasting and 17 years of telecasting in Tehran, AFRTS Radio 1555 and TV Channel 7 cease all operations in this country at this time. I bid you all goodbye and thank you for letting us serve you. And now the national anthem of the United States of America.&quot;
The following day, AFRTS radio and television services in Iran were replaced by those operated by the state broadcaster National Iranian Radio and Television (NIRT), which were similar in content, appealing to the 60 000 U.S. Army and civilian personnel then stationed in Iran, as well as the wider population of foreign nationals resident in the country.

===South Vietnam===
As the U.S. military presence in South Vietnam increased, AFRTS opened radio and later television stations there.

AFRTS stations in Vietnam were initially known by the name &quot;AFRS&quot; (Armed Forces Radio Saigon), but as the number of stations quickly expanded throughout South Vietnam became known as &quot;AFVN&quot; (American Forces Vietnam Network) and had several stations, including Qui Nhơn, Nha Trang, Pleiku, Da Nang and Huế, the latter being overrun by the People&#x27;s Army of Vietnam during the Battle of Hue in January/February 1968 and replaced by a station in Quảng Trị. AFVN&#x27;s headquarters station was located in Saigon.

In Vietnam, AFVN had a number of war-related casualties. After a fierce fire fight that killed two soldiers and a civilian contractor, the remaining AFVN station staff at Huế was captured and spent five years as prisoners of war. At the height of American involvement in the war, Armed Forces Vietnam Network served more than 500,000 fighting men and women at one time. AFVN developed a program along the lines of &quot;GI Jive&quot; from World War II. A number of local disc jockeys helped make hourlong music programs for broadcast. Perhaps the best-known program became the morning &quot;Dawn Buster&quot; program, (the brainchild of Chief Petty Officer Bryant Arbuckle in 1962) thanks to the popularity of the sign-on slogan &quot;Gooooood Morning, Vietnam&quot; (which was initiated by Adrian Cronauer and later became the basis for the film &quot;Good Morning, Vietnam&quot; starring Robin Williams). Among the notable people who were AFVN disc jockeys were Don L. &quot;Scotty&quot; Brink, Lee Hansen, Les Coleman and Pat Sajak, Chris Noel, John Allgood, Joe Huser, and Dennis Woytek. Army Spec. 5 Robert Morecook announced the upcoming end of the Vietnam War on AFVN-TV news in February, 1973, which followed 30 days later. Army Spec 4 Tom Fowlston was first to announce the war end on radio news. Harry Simons hosted the &quot;GO Show&quot; at both AFVN Saigon and Danang in 1968 and 1969. Simons along with broadcaster Mike Bates created and produced a 10-hour radio documentary (&quot;AFVN: The GI&#x27;s Companion&quot;) as a tribute to AFVN and to honor all Vietnam Veterans. It aired and streamed on Veterans Day 2015 on WEBY Radio in Pensacola, Florida. The documentary is archived at Rock Radio Scrapbook: AFVN: The GI&#x27;s Companion.

Beginning in 1971, AFVN began to close some stations in Vietnam. The last station to close was the key station in Saigon in 1973. Broadcasting continued under civilian leadership on FM only and using the name American Radio Service (ARS). The civilian engineers were provided by Pacific Architects and Engineers (PAE). ARS stayed on the air until the Fall of Saigon in April 1975. It was to play Bing Crosby&#x27;s version of Irving Berlin&#x27;s &quot;White Christmas&quot; as a signal for Americans that the final evacuation of Saigon had begun. The Crosby version of the record could not be found so Tennessee Ernie Ford&#x27;s record from 1968 was played.

===Thailand===
In Thailand, the Department of Defense began the planning for the Armed Forces Thailand Network in 1964 with Project Lamplighter and Project Limelight. By late 1966, implementation of the network began by the U.S. Air Force with stations on the air at Korat, U-Tapao, Ubon, Udorn, Takhli and Nahkon Phanom. In addition, there were more than 20 satellite stations that rebroadcast one or more of the primary stations, and that included one or more clandestine locations in Laos.

In April 1970, a battle-damaged RF-4C Phantom II #65-0863 returning to Udorn from a reconnaissance mission in northwest Laos, crashed into the AFTN station, killing 9 Air Force broadcasters. Pilot Leaphart and Navigator Bernholz ejected from their battle damaged plane when it went out of control on final approach. Both crewmen were injured but survived. The incident was the single worst catastrophe in the history of military broadcasting killing: TSGT Jack A Hawley, Wakeman, OH; SSGT James A. Howard, Denver, CO; A1C Andrew C. McCartney, Lakewood, OH; SSGT Alfred N. Potter, Forest Grove, OR; SGT John Charles Rose, Bloomfield, NJ; TSGT Frank D. Ryan Jr., Mercer Island, WA; SSGT Edward W. Strain, Myrtle Beach, SC; TSGT Roy Walker, Albuquerque, NM and A1C Thomas L. Waterman, Roanoke, VA.

AFTN became the American Forces Thailand Network in the summer of 1969, and continued operations until the spring of 1976 when the remaining U.S. troops in Thailand were withdrawn at the request of the Thai government. More than 600 broadcasters from the Air Force, Navy and Army had served during the ten years that AFTN operated.

===Taiwan===

Before the United States and the People&#x27;s Republic of China established diplomatic relations in 1979, the AFN branch in Taiwan was Armed Forces Network Taiwan (AFNT), which had a main station in Yangmingshan American Military Housing, Taipei. After the U.S. armed forces withdrew all its troops stationed in Taiwan (including the United States Taiwan Defense Command) as Washington, D.C., recognizes Beijing and broke ties with Taipei, the station was reorganized under the name of International Community Radio Taipei (ICRT) by the American Chamber of Commerce in Taipei and the ROC government. Today, ICRT is the only English-language radio service in Taiwan.

===Caribbean===
Then still known as the American Forces (or Armed Forces) Radio and Television Service, military bases and facilities throughout Puerto Rico received original radio programming from Army studios at Ft. Brooke in San Juan, Air Force studios at Ramey Air Force Base, and radio and television originating from Navy studios at Roosevelt Roads, in addition to local playback of stateside entertainment radio and television shows. This broadcast service was known as AFCN, the American Forces Caribbean Network in the 1970s (later as the Armed Forces Caribbean Network) served military bases and facilities throughout Puerto Rico from transmitters in San Juan (Fort Brooke, Fort Buchanan), Roosevelt Roads Naval Station, and Ramey Air Force Base. Each of these bases also had their own television transmitters or cable systems that played back stateside TV programming delivered to each location in weekly &quot;packages&quot; of 16mm film, kinescope recordings, video tape, and satellite news programming feeds. AFCN Roosevelt Roads also produced live radio programming featuring Navy Journalist/Broadcaster disc jockeys in a Top 40 hits format, combined with programming from AFRTS Hollywood-sourced stateside shows such as American Top 40. Programming broadcast over AFCN broadcast radio and television transmitter antennas also reached some local civilian markets across Puerto Rico, such as San Juan.

===Central America===
Radio, and later television, to U.S. troops stationed in the Panama Canal Zone was provided initially by Armed Forces Radio (AFN) at Albrook Field and later as the Caribbean Forces Network at Fort Clayton with translators on the Atlantic side of the Canal Zone. In the early 1960s with reorganization of the command located in the Canal Zone, CFN became the Southern Command Network (SCN). SCN also broadcast to U.S. troops stationed in Honduras starting in 1987. SCN discontinued broadcasting on 1 July 1999 just before the 31 December turnover of the Canal Zone to the Republic of Panama when U.S. troops were removed from that country under the Torrijos-Carter Treaties.

AFN Honduras, which began in 1987 as SCN Honduras, now broadcasts from Soto Cano Air Base on 106.3 FM, and serves more than 600 American service members stationed at the installation, as well as numerous civilian employees and contractors. The station&#x27;s primary mission is radio, originating programming including two daily live shows following the &quot;Eagle&quot; format. Personnel also occasionally produce video news packages. As of 15 January 2013, AFN Honduras is one of 18 stations under the operational control of AFN Europe.

===Shortwave radio===
With the advent of satellite broadcasting, AFRTS has shifted its emphasis away from shortwave. Currently, the U.S. Navy provides the only shortwave single sideband shortwave AFN radio broadcasts via relay sites around the world to provide service to ships, including Diego Garcia, Guam, Naval Air Station Sigonella in Italy, Puerto Rico, Hawaii and others.

==Organization==
The American Forces Network (AFN) is the operational arm of the American Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS), an office of the Defense Media Activity (DMA). AFN falls under the operational control of the Office of the Assistant Secretary of Defense for Public Affairs (OASD-PA). Editorial control is by the Department of Defense, whereas the British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS), for example, is independent of the Ministry of Defence and the British armed forces.

AFN employs military broadcasters as well as Defense Department civilians and contractors. Service personnel hold broadcasting occupational specialties for their military branch.

Since 1997, all of AFN&#x27;s military personnel receive primary training at the Defense Information School (DINFOS) at Fort George G. Meade in Maryland. Before 1997, DINFOS was located at Fort Benjamin Harrison in Indianapolis, Indiana. In 1997, Fort Benjamin Harrison was largely closed as a function of the 1991 Base Closure and Realignment Commission. Additional/Advanced training is also available at Fort George G. Meade.

In the 1960s, DINFOS was located at Fort Slocum, NY on a small island just off the harbor at New Rochelle. At its peak in 1965, the Army Chaplain school was also located there. In 1963 the campus operated in a &quot;university&quot; setting with a relaxed military environment. The Army ran the Information School although training was offered to members of all military branches. Radio types took a rather severe audition written by CBS for their network announcers. Those who survived the audition became &quot;Broadcast Specialists&quot; with a 703 MOS and went on to an AFRTS assignment.

Some of AFN&#x27;s broadcasters have previous commercial broadcasting experience before enlisting in the military, but it is not a prerequisite for enlistment in the military as a broadcaster. During their training, the broadcasters are taught to use state-of-the-art audio and visual editing equipment similar to their civilian counterparts.

AFN management is located at DMA headquarters at Fort Meade. Day-to-day AFN broadcast operations are conducted at the AFN Broadcast Center/Defense Media Center in Riverside, California, from where all global radio and television satellite feeds emanate.

==Television services==

===European operations===
Until the early 1970s, U.S. military television service was provided in Western Europe by Air Force Television at Ramstein Air Base, Germany. In the early 1970s, AFN assumed this responsibility for the Armed Forces Radio and Television Service (AFRTS).

AFN Bremerhaven was the first AFN television station in Europe to broadcast its programming in color. The U.S. European Edition of &quot;Stars and Stripes&quot; (&quot;S&amp;S&quot;) reported in its Thursday, 21 August 1975, edition that the AFN-Europe Commander, Lt. Col. Floyd A. McBride, announced that AFN&#x27;s first color TV broadcast would begin in Bremerhaven on Monday 25 August 1975. As &quot;S&amp;S&quot; reported, because Bremerhaven&#x27;s TV operation was so small, only a &quot;Class C&quot; operation, and, at the time, served only one area with TV programming, it was easy to establish the color TV broadcast operation without extensive expense or expansion.

That next year, &quot;S&amp;S&quot; reported in its Wednesday, 23 June 1976, edition, that &quot;the long-awaited switch to color by AFN-TV could come by the end of the year for viewers in most of West Germany. The only viewers enjoying color right now are those watching the pilot color TV station in Bremerhaven, which went on the air in…1975&quot;.

Finally, on 28 October 1976, AFN television moved from AFTV&#x27;s old black-and-white studios at Ramstein to the network&#x27;s new color television studios in Frankfurt. In the 1980s the network added affiliates with studio capabilities in Würzburg, Germany, and Soesterberg, the Netherlands, expanding the network to 12 affiliate stations serving American military, DOD-employed civilians and their families estimated to be well-above 350,000 stationed in West Germany, the Netherlands, and Belgium. This was accomplished by a system of 112 microwave transmitters operated and maintained by the Army&#x27;s 5th Signal Command. Embassies and other entities of the American government without access to AFN TV signals received a 30-plus hour package mailed weekly of AFN and U.S. programming. In April 1984, AFN began broadcasting live news, information and entertainment programming received through an 11-meter satellite dish downlink at AFN network headquarters, in addition to primetime pre-recorded shows and movies received from the Armed Forces Radio-Television Service broadcast center in Hollywood. For outlying areas, broadcast feeds of live American sports events were frequently provided by European contractors.

AFN TV was available in West Berlin until 1994. However, it was only available in the American Sector.

In 1946, AFN Europe headquarters relocated from London to Hoechst Castle on the western edge of Frankfurt.

In 1966, AFN Europe headquarters relocated to the Dornbusch quarter of Frankfurt, adjacent to Hessischer Rundfunk.

In 2004, AFN Europe headquarters relocated to Coleman Barracks in Mannheim, Germany.

In 2014, AFN Europe headquarters relocated to Sembach Kaserne in Sembach, Germany.

===Pacific operations===
Over-the-air TV for U.S. Forces in the Pacific is currently provided by AFN-Korea, AFN-Japan and AFN-Kwajalein. All local operations merged under the AFN banner effective 1 January 1998.

====South Korea====
AFN-Korea, formerly American Forces Korea Network (AFKN), was the largest of AFN&#x27;s Pacific TV operations, although there are also AM and FM operations from military bases around Korea. AFKN began TV operations on 15 September 1957 and consisted of an originating studio at Yongsan Garrison, Seoul, and six relay transmitters throughout the peninsula. AFKN&#x27;s first live television newscast aired on 4 January 1959. Until December 2007, the channel was widely available to non-military audiences on cable television, but following complaints from U.S. companies trying to sell programs in South Korea, USFK requested that the Korean Broadcasting Commission direct the removal of Pacific Prime from the Korean cable lineups. American Forces Network-Korea discontinued analog over-the-air TV broadcast 1 May 2012, due to request from the South Korean government because many local residents could receive current over-the-air U.S. network programming, resulting in decreased sales of U.S. programs to South Korean stations.

====Japan====
AFN Japan, formerly the Far East Network (FEN), had one full-power VHF terrestrial TV outlet – located on Okinawa atop the Rycom Plaza Housing area in the central part of the island, AFN-Okinawa&#x27;s (U.S. channel 8) TV signal served Marines, Airmen, Sailors, Soldiers, and their families stationed on-island. TV viewers on military bases in the Tokyo and Kanto Plain area of Japan can view AFN via contractor-operated base cable TV services, or through AFN Direct-To-Home (DTH) dish services if they reside off-base.

AFN-Japan&#x27;s radio services consist of AM and FM stereo operations at Yokota Air Base (810 AM &amp; cable FM), MCAS Iwakuni (1575 AM), FLTACTS Sasebo (1575 AM), Okinawa (648 AM &amp; 89.1 FM) and Misawa Air Base (1575 AM).

AFN-Okinawa ceased over-the-air analog TV operations along with all other Japanese TV stations on July 24, 2011.

====Latin America====
There used to be a television service in Panama (SCN) from 1956 to 1999. Broadcast on channel 8 in the Pacific zone and channel 10 in the Atlantic zone. In 1999, from the termination of local production (June 30) to the shutdown of the station and return of the control of the Panama Canal to the Panamanian state (December 31), the channel was relaying the main AFN service. After its closure, the Panamanian regulatory body aimed at bidding channel 8 and its relay station to local companies, but the bid was frozen in March 2000.

In 2001, following failed attempts at creating a regional educational station, the Panamanian government started setting a date for the fate of the former SCN frequencies, July 10. Since no company successfully bid for those licenses, channels 7 and 9 in the capital zone were given for a bid, Tele 7 (now Oye TV) and TVMax, both starting in 2005.

====Kwajalein Atoll====
AFN-Kwajalein at the Reagan Missile Test Range on Kwajalein Atoll is the only civilian-run affiliate in AFN, broadcasting on U.S. channel 13 for military personnel and civilian contractor employees and their families. AFN-Kwajalein&#x27;s signal is beamed by microwave to the nearby island of Roi-Namur and rebroadcast on channel 8.

With the availability of AFN&#x27;s DTH service, terrestrial over-the-air TV broadcasts at all AFN outlets are slated for deactivation in the near future.

===Gulf War===
In January 1991, the network dispatched news teams and technicians to Kuwait and Saudi Arabia for Operations Desert Shield and Desert Storm. These broadcasters reported to families of soldiers deployed from Europe and staffed a number of U.S. radio stations making up the Armed Forces Desert Network. The first song on the air after the start of the ground offensive was &quot;Rock the Casbah&quot; by The Clash.

The network first signed on under the name &quot;Desert Shield Network&quot; in Al Jubayl on September 12, 1990, but operated 24-hours of programming since January 2, 1991. As of January 1991, the Desert Shield Network is staffed by more than 50 military broadcasters operating out of four vans in the cities of Riyadh, Dhahran, Al Jubayl, and King Khalid Military City, and reaches nearly 90% of the U.S. military personnel featuring a 50/50 mix of news and contemporary music with jingles produced by JAM Creative Productions during each break of song or news breaks. At the time, the network began producing three minutes of local news per day which later expanded in its lineup. The vans are mobile studios containing 21 relay transmitters carrying radio signals to troops on various FM frequencies depending on location. Right after the operation became known as &quot;Desert Storm&quot;, it retained its &quot;Desert Shield Network&quot; name due to the staff expecting to continue operations for an unspecified period of time until the end.

===Operation Iraqi Freedom===
AFN-Iraq began broadcasting in December 2003 on the FM band shortly after the fall of Saddam. The first song on the air was &quot;Freedom&quot; by Paul McCartney. Within a short time, Freedom Radio was broadcasting on multiple FM channels from as far south as Basra to as far north as Mosul.

AFN-Iraq, Freedom Radio began as a joint effort between the Air Force, the Marines and the Army. The first unit to operate the station was the 222nd Broadcast Operations Detachment, an Army Reserve unit based in southern California. &quot;Always There and on the Air&quot; was the phrase that started it all, even though there were only eight hours of live radio to kick things off.

After an introduction from Lt. Gen. Ricardo Sanchez, the commander of Coalition Ground Forces in Iraq, Air Force Master Sergeant Erik Brazones was the first DJ on the air. When the 222nd BOD took the reins of the radio operations, the first two regular radio shows were &quot;Niki Cage in the Morning&quot; and &quot;Abbey in the Afternoon&quot;. AFN-Iraq signed off in 2011.

===Operation Enduring Freedom===
AFN Afghanistan operated out of a building on Bagram Air Base. Its radio frequency throughout Afghanistan was 94.1 and 97.1 in Manas and produced live local shows. Its first radio transmission was at 06 o&#x27;clock 30 min on Friday, 21 July 2006. Beyond radio, AFN Afghanistan also had television news. It produced a daily five-minute newscast called Freedom Watch Afghanistan, which also aired on the Pentagon Channel.

The station was typically staffed with Air Force broadcasters but also slots Army, Navy and Marine broadcasters as well. For support there were usually four-man teams of engineers to handle all transmission, decoder and satellite issues.

===Operations in Western Europe===
AFN in Germany and SEB (Southern European Broadcasting) in Italy provided broadcasting to U.S. troops in Western Europe throughout the Cold War. The U.S. defense drawdown began in earnest after the Gulf War, and affected AFN stations across Europe, as many stations were consolidated or deactivated with the closing of bases. In Europe, AFN is still on the air from Tuzla, Bosnia, and Taszár, Hungary, to inform and entertain U.S. forces.

AFN went on the air 29 May with service at the Tirana airport in Albania with satellite decoders and large-screen televisions placed in high traffic areas. At the same time, the AFN also advanced into the Yugoslav province of Kosovo along with NATO.

AFN viewers abroad witnessed live television coverage of the terrorist attacks on the United States on 11 September 2001.

During military operations in Afghanistan and Iraq AFN provided non-stop coverage of the campaigns. AFN broadcast personnel from Europe deployed with the troops to cover events. Today AFN has a staffed affiliate in Iraq, AFN-Baghdad (launched in 2003).

Wherever large numbers of U.S. troops are deployed, the AFN sets up operation, providing news and entertainment from home. Today AFN has several satellites and uses advanced digital compression technology to broadcast TV and radio to 177 countries and territories, as well as on board U.S. Navy vessels.

==Media services==
There have been ongoing plans for transitioning AFN TV to HDTV with an estimated completion timeframe between 2015 and 2017. So far, AFN has added one HD channel, with more being planned. However, the conversion to HD is an expensive project, so timelines and actual transition of channels is highly dependent on availability of funds. With the additional Department of Defense budget cuts looming, this project could easily be required to slip. However, AFN is continuing to research more efficient delivery methods in hopes of continuing along the planned path. In December 2017, AFN converted all of its channels to HD; broadcasts started in the format on December 12.

All programming delivered by satellite is PowerVu encrypted DVB. While programming is provided to AFN by major American TV networks and program syndicators at little to no cost, for copyright and licensing reasons it is intended solely for U.S. forces personnel, authorized Department of Defense civilian employees, State Department diplomatic personnel and their families overseas.

AFN-TV is available to authorized viewers by &quot;Direct-to-Home&quot; (DTH) service with set-top decoders purchased or leased through military exchanges (similar to a membership store), licensed/contracted commercial cable operators, purchased used from other military members (the cheapest option) or terrestrial signal. The advent of DTH service coincides with the phasing-out of AFN terrestrial TV broadcasts due to reclamation of frequencies by host nations.

AFN is considered a non-essential service, and programming ceases during government shutdowns. Sports programming to which the AFN has already purchased rights continues to be carried, as the skeleton crew operating AFN for essential programming does not save any money by blacking out the programs.

===AFN programming===
While the audience tunes into AFN to watch their favorite shows or listen to the latest stateside hits, entertainment is the &quot;candy coating&quot; used to attract the military viewer/listener. AFN&#x27;s primary mission is to provide access for worldwide, regional and local command information (CI) spots, which air during commercial breaks in programming instead of commercial advertisements. These CI spots run the gamut from reminding service members to register to vote, promoting local command-sponsored recreation events and off-duty educational programs, providing health and wellness tips, and listing what&#x27;s playing at local base movie theaters.

AFN also inserts public service announcements from the Ad Council. Some of the 35 overseas AFN affiliates have the capability to cover the &quot;worldwide&quot; CI spots placed by the AFN Broadcast Center in California with regional or locally produced CI spots (such as localized messages from senior leadership).

Many service members welcome this approach, while others find it troublesome, especially during the airing of the Super Bowl.

The network is allowed to broadcast commercial movie promotion trailers provided by the Army &amp; Air Force Exchange Service (AAFES) and the Navy Motion Picture Service (NMPS) to promote the latest film releases in base theaters worldwide. Previously these were the only true &quot;commercials&quot; authorized for broadcast.

AFN Radio and TV schedules are available on the organization&#x27;s website.

====Radio====
AFN also offers a variety of radio programming over its various frequencies throughout the world. There is both local programming (with military disc jockeys) and satellite programming. Music programming spans classic rock, rhythm and blues, Jack FM and country music. Ryan Seacrest&#x27;s &quot;American Top 40&quot; (AFN The Blend), WoodSongs Old-Time Radio Hour (AFN Country), Casey Kasem&#x27;s American Top 40 (AFN&#x27;s Joe Radio) and the &quot;American Country Countdown&quot; with Kix Brooks (AFN Country) are broadcast weekly over AFN Radio. In addition to music, AFN broadcasts syndicated talk radio programs such as &quot;Car Talk&quot; (NPR AFN), John Tesh (Hot AC), &quot;The Bob and Sheri Show&quot; (AFN Joe Radio), &quot;Le Show&quot; (NPR AFN), &quot;Tech Nation&quot; (AFN The Voice), &quot;Kidd Kraddick in the Morning&quot; (AFN the Blend), &quot;Kim Komando&quot; (AFN The Voice), &quot;The Rush Limbaugh Show&quot; (AFN Power Talk), Delilah (AFN The Blend), &quot;The Motley Fool Radio Show&quot; (AFN The Voice), &quot;A Prairie Home Companion&quot; (NPR AFN), &quot;Doug Stephan&quot; (AFN The Voice),&quot;Titillating Sports with Rick Tittle&quot;, &quot;Sports Overnight America&quot; (AFN FANS), &quot;Mr Dad: Positive Parenting&quot; (AFN The Voice), and other programs from a variety of sources. Weekly religious programming is offered to AFN stations via closed-circuit.

On 5 December 2005, liberal/progressive Ed Schultz and conservative talk show host Sean Hannity were added to the radio programs provided by the AFN Broadcast Center to its affiliate stations. Liberal Alan Colmes rounds out the political talk lineup on The Voice channel.

On 24 April 2006, AFN Europe launched AFN The Eagle, a virtually 24-hour-a-day radio service format initially modeled after &quot;Jack FM&quot; but most recently a &quot;Hot AC&quot; format. This replaced ZFM, which had more of a contemporary hit radio flavor. When the Eagle was launched, AFN Europe took control of what local DJs could play.

Altogether, AFN produces ten general-use streams for AFN stations to use. Of these, six are music-based, two are sports-based and three general news/talk channels, including The Voice, which features live play-by-play of American sports (it&#x27;s also the one heard on shortwave, if the shortwave radio has Single sideband installed). How these stations use these formats is up to them. These formats are:
* AFN The Blend (mainstream hits and yesterday&#x27;s favorites, programming from Westwood One and Premiere Networks. Formerly known as &quot;AFN Hot AC&quot;)
* AFN Country (country/western)
* AFN Gravity (urban rhythmic)
* AFN Legacy – Deep Classic Rock Gems
* AFN&#x27;s Joe Radio (&#x27;80s, &#x27;90s)
* AFN Freedom Rock (Rock music)
* AFN The Voice (News, talk and information)
* AFN Clutch (sports programming from ESPN and SportsMap)
* AFN Fans (sports programming from Fox Sports Radio and Sports Byline USA)
* AFN PowerTalk (liberal and conservative talk programming)
* NPR AFN (public radio programs from NPR and others)

====Television====
Like its radio counterpart, AFN TV tries to air programming from a variety of sources to replicate programming on a typical U.S. TV channel; sourcing from U.S. commercial networks (including PBS), and program syndicators at little to no cost since AFN does not air commercials and in that regard cannot profit from airing shows like stations in the United States can. In their place, AFN inserts public service announcements on various subjects; these can be civilian &quot;agency spots&quot; created by the Ad Council, nationally recognized religious and public health charities, AFN&#x27;s own &quot;command information&quot; spots produced by the AFRTS Radio-Television Production Office (RTPO) or announcements by a regional/local AFN affiliate. The most common PSAs shown deal with sexual harassment, public health and safety, force protection/anti-terrorism, pride in service and messages to the troops.

Some people have found the AFN TV commercials to be repetitive, annoying, and condescending.

AFN produces and broadcasts eight core satellite television channels. They are accessible to both military and foreign service personnel abroad. All eight feeds are accessible in core areas, including but not limited to European, Korean and Japanese posts. Much of the rest of the world is limited to a smaller but more widespread naval broadcast.

=====Channels=====
Unless specified, the first telecast of each channel targets the Japan/Korea region, then replayed several hours later for the Central European time zone.
* AFN Prime. Formerly AFN Atlantic and AFN Pacific. The standard AFN feed airs current sitcoms, dramas, syndicated court shows, talk shows, game shows and reality shows popular in the United States, with a time delay from 24 hours to six months or more behind the United States airdates. In addition, popular U.S. soap operas such as &quot;General Hospital&quot; are aired by AFN on a one-week tape delay. This stream is divided into three feeds (AFN Prime Atlantic, AFN Prime Freedom (Middle East) and AFN Prime Pacific); the difference between the three is that they are time-shifted so that programs air at the same local time in each of the major regions served: Japan/Korea, Central Europe and Iraq. Many regional feeds (such as AFN-Europe and AFN-Korea) are based on AFN Prime and add local programming to it; thus, in a way, AFN Prime mimics the regular network TV concept. AFN Prime Freedom started in 2006 as a customized time-shifted version of AFN Prime for Afghanistan and shuttered services in June 2013 after the drawdown of troops from the Middle East.
* AFN Spectrum. AFN Spectrum started as more of a conservative culture-oriented channel with programming from cable networks and classic TV series. In a way, it mimicked the &quot;superstation&quot; concept from cablecasters TBS and WGN America. However, the Spectrum lineup currently contains more conventional programming, like &quot;American Idol&quot; and &quot;Ugly Betty&quot;, as some of the public television and classic fare that made up Spectrum is being reduced but remain the primary constant on the channel.
* AFN News. AFN News is a rolling-news channel providing news from all major news outlets. Newscasts, such as the &quot;NBC Nightly News&quot;, &quot;Fox News&quot;, &quot;ABC World News Tonight&quot; and &quot;CBS Evening News&quot;, were all scheduled to air in the mornings so viewers could watch the headlines live, but now they air on a tape delay in the regular early evening slot, back to back.
* AFN Family/AFN Pulse. AFN Family is a general entertainment channel providing programming for children ages 2 to 17. Although the name of the channel suggests programming appropriate for all family members at any time, the channel more closely resembles Freeform or Nickelodeon, with programming targeted at specific age groups during the course of the day. Programming during after school from 3 p.m. local time to 1 a.m. local time targets pre-schoolers but &quot;ages&quot; as older children become available to watch in the late morning and day. By 1 a.m. local time, programming is targeted at older teens. In September 2013, AFN launched a split in Family, which was branded AFN Pulse. About half of the day&#x27;s programming remains aimed at the 2-to-13 age group. During primetime hours, the channel becomes AFN Pulse, and showcases programming primarily aimed at the older teen demographic, though it remains suitable for family viewing.
* AFN Movie. AFN Movie is a channel showcasing movies as well as film-oriented programming.
* AFN Sports. AFN Sports is a rolling-sports channel, providing sports news and events, including ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsCenter&quot; and live and delayed broadcasts of the NFL, NBA, NASCAR, MLB, NHL, NCAA college football, men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s NCAA college basketball, FIFA soccer and PGA Tour, as well as other highly rated team competitions. Most major boxing and martial arts events, including all pay-per-view events from WWE and other promoters, airs on the channel with no additional payment to the viewer.
* AFN Sports 2. Launched in February 2006, as AFN Xtra. It is AFN&#x27;s exclusive home for UFC and WWE programming, including all pay-per-view events, as well as motor sports, including NASCAR, NHRA, Motocross, and other auto and motorcycle racing series.
* AFN Sports HD. AFN Sports is also now available in digital high definition using the new Cisco D9865 receiver/decoder.

<doc id="365856" wikidata="Q415889" url="?curid=365856" title="Wüstite">
<text>Wüstite (FeO, sometimes also written as Fe0.95O) is a mineral form of mostly iron(II) oxide found with meteorites and native iron. It has a grey colour with a greenish tint in reflected light. Wüstite crystallizes in the isometric-hexoctahedral crystal system in opaque to translucent metallic grains. It has a Mohs hardness of 5 to 5.5 and a specific gravity of 5.88. Wüstite is a typical example of a non-stoichiometric compound.

Wüstite was named after Fritz Wüst (1860–1938), a German metallurgist and founding director of the &quot;Kaiser-Wilhelm-Institut für Eisenforschung&quot; (presently Max Planck Institute for Iron Research GmbH).

In addition to its type locality in Germany, it has been reported from Disko Island, Greenland; the Jharia coalfield, Jharkhand, India; and as inclusions in diamonds in a number of kimberlite pipes. It also is reported from deep sea manganese nodules.

Its presence indicates a highly reducing environment.

== Wüstite redox buffer ==
Iron minerals on the Earth&#x27;s surface are typically richly oxidized, forming hematite, with Fe3+ state, or in somewhat less oxidizing environments, magnetite, with a mixture of Fe3+ and Fe2+. Wüstite, in geochemistry, defines a &quot;redox buffer&quot; of oxidation within rocks at which point the rock is so reduced that Fe3+, and thus hematite, is absent.

As the redox state of a rock is further reduced, magnetite is converted to wüstite. This occurs by conversion of the Fe3+ ions in magnetite to Fe2+ ions. An example reaction is presented below:
:&lt;chem&gt;\underset{magnetite}{FeO.Fe2O3} + \underset{graphite/diamond}{C} -&gt; {3FeO} + \underset{carbon\ monoxide}{CO}&lt;/chem&gt;

The formula for magnetite is more accurately written as FeO·Fe2O3 than as Fe3O4. Magnetite is one part FeO and one part Fe2O3, rather than a solid solution of wüstite and hematite. Magnetite is termed a &quot;redox buffer&quot; because, until all Fe3+ present in the system is converted to Fe2+, the oxide mineral assemblage of iron remains wüstite-magnetite. Furthermore, the redox state of the rock remains at the same level of oxygen fugacity. Considering buffering the redox potential (Eh) in the Fe–O redox system, this can be compared to buffering the pH in the H+/OH− acid–base system of water.

Once the Fe3+ is consumed, then oxygen must be stripped from the system to further reduce it and wüstite is converted to native iron. The oxide mineral equilibrium assemblage of the rock becomes wüstite–magnetite–iron.

In nature, the only natural systems which are chemically reduced enough to even attain a wüstite–magnetite composition are rare, including carbonate-rich skarns, meteorites, fulgurites and lightning-affected rock, and perhaps the mantle where reduced carbon is present, exemplified by the presence of diamond or graphite.

=== Effects upon silicate minerals ===
The ratio of Fe2+ to Fe3+ within a rock determines, in part, the silicate mineral assemblage of the rock. Within a rock of a given chemical composition, iron enters minerals based on the bulk chemical composition and the mineral phases which are stable at that temperature and pressure. Iron may only enter minerals such as pyroxene and olivine if it is present as Fe2+; Fe3+ cannot enter the lattice of fayalite olivine and thus for every two Fe3+ ions, one Fe2+ is used and one molecule of magnetite is created.

In chemically reduced rocks, magnetite may be absent due to the propensity of iron to enter olivine, and wüstite may only be present if there is an excess of iron above what can be used by silica. Thus, wüstite may only be found in silica-undersaturated compositions which are also heavily chemically reduced, satisfying both the need to remove all Fe3+ and to maintain iron outside of silicate minerals.

In nature, carbonate rocks, potentially carbonatite, kimberlites, carbonate-bearing melilitic rocks, and other rare alkaline rocks may satisfy these criteria. However, wüstite is not reported in most of these rocks in nature, potentially because the redox state necessary to drive magnetite to wüstite is so rare.

==Role in nitrogen fixation==

Approximately 2–3% of the world&#x27;s energy budget is allocated to the Haber process for ammonia () production, which relies on wüstite-derived catalysts. The industrial catalyst is derived from finely ground iron powder, which is usually obtained by reduction of high-purity magnetite (Fe3O4). The pulverized iron metal is burnt (oxidized) to give magnetite or wüstite of a defined particle size. The magnetite (or wüstite) particles are then partially reduced, removing some of the oxygen in the process. The resulting catalyst particles consist of a core of magnetite, encased in a shell of wüstite, which in turn is surrounded by an outer shell of iron metal. The catalyst maintains most of its bulk volume during the reduction, resulting in a highly porous high-surface-area material, which enhances its effectiveness as a catalyst.

==Historical use==
According to Vagn Fabritius Buchwald, wüstite was an important component during the Iron Age to facilitate the process of forge welding. In ancient times, when blacksmithing was performed using a charcoal forge, the deep charcoal pit in which the steel or iron was placed provided a highly reducing, virtually oxygen-free environment, producing a thin wüstite layer on the metal. At the welding temperature, the iron becomes highly reactive with oxygen, and will spark and form thick layers of slag when exposed to the air, which makes welding the iron or steel nearly impossible. To solve this problem, ancient blacksmiths would toss small amounts of sand onto the white-hot metal. The silica in the sand reacts with the wüstite to form fayalite, which melts just below the welding temperature. This produced an effective flux that shielded the metal from oxygen and helped extract oxides and impurities, leaving a pure surface that can weld readily. Although the ancients had no knowledge of how this worked, the ability to weld iron contributed to the movement out of the Bronze Age and into the modern.

== Related minerals ==
Wüstite forms a solid solution with periclase (MgO), and iron substitutes for magnesium. Periclase, when hydrated, forms brucite (Mg(OH)2), a common product of serpentinite metamorphic reactions.

Oxidation and hydration of wüstite forms goethite and limonite.

Zinc, aluminium, and other metals may substitute for iron in wüstite.

Wüstite in dolomite skarns may be related to siderite (iron(II) carbonate), wollastonite, enstatite, diopside, and magnesite.

<text>Antonov Airlines is a Ukrainian cargo airline, a division of the Antonov aviation company. It operates international charter services in the oversized-cargo market. Its main base is Hostomel Airport near Kyiv. In the aftermath of the Battle of Hostomel Airport, Antonov relocated its remaining aircraft to Leipzig/Halle Airport.

==History==
===Early years===
The airline was established and started operations in 1989 through a marketing agent agreement with Air Foyle to market Antonov An-124 Ruslan cargo charters worldwide. This relationship ended in June 2006. The same month Antonov Airlines and another large player in the global specialty air cargo business, Volga-Dnepr Airlines (Russia), established a joint venture company – Rusland International — where each company has a 50% stake. The joint operation of the Ukrainian and Russian fleets allows them to share the combined An-124-100 commercial fleet of seventeen aircraft (twelve of which belong to Antonov Airlines). In 2017 Antonov Airlines opened a United Kingdom office at London Stansted Airport, with a first flight in February by an Antonov An-124 Ruslan.

=== 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine ===

At the outbreak of the 2022 Russian invasion of Ukraine, the An-225 Mriya was at its home base of Antonov Airport in Hostomel undergoing an engine swap. During the Battle of Antonov Airport the site was captured by the Russians, and the An-225 was destroyed. UkrOboronProm said that: &quot;The restoration is estimated to take over 3 billion USD and over five years. Our task is to ensure that these costs are covered by the Russian Federation, which has caused intentional damage to Ukraine&#x27;s aviation and the air cargo sector.&quot; Other Antonov Airlines aircraft were diverted to Leipzig/Halle Airport upon completion of commercial missions, from where the airline continued operations with five An-124 aircraft.

===Notable operations===
* An 88-ton water turbine for the Tashtakumska Hydroelectric Plant from Kharkiv to Tashkent;
* Civil engineering vehicles to deal with the consequences of the earthquake in Spitak, Armenia;
* Vehicles and systems for resolving the Persian Gulf crisis (mine clearance bulldozers, mobile electric stations, special mine, and oil-clearing boats, humanitarian assistance);
* A 135.2 ton Siemens generator from Düsseldorf, Germany, to Delhi, India, was air-lifted by an An-124;
* Nuclear fuel in special containers from Habaniya, Iraq, to Yekaterinburg, Russia, under the United Nations program for disarmament of Iraq;
* A 102-ton locomotive from London, Ontario, Canada, to Dublin, Ireland;
* A 70-ton generator was flown to Lahore, Pakistan, from Doncaster Robin Hood, United Kingdom, for power station needs;
* A 140-ton generator was flown from Zagreb, Croatia, to Cebu, Philippines for replacement on one of two generators which was hit by lightning.
* A 187.6 ton power plant generator from Frankfurt-Hahn Airport, Germany, to Yerevan, Armenia (listed in the &quot;Guinness Book of Records&quot;)
* A 95-ton Putzmeister concrete pump from the Atlanta Hartsfield Airport, United States, to Japan to assist with the Fukushima I Nuclear Power Plant
*On 20 July 2015 a 76-ton single piece electrical transformer was flown from Shenyang Taoxian International Airport, China, to Karachi, Pakistan, for Quaid-e-Azam solar park power project.

<text>Hearts and Bones is the sixth solo studio album by American singer-songwriter Paul Simon. It was released in 1983 by Warner Bros. Records.

==Background==
The album was originally intended to be called &quot;Think Too Much&quot;, but Mo Ostin, president of Warner Bros. Records at the time, persuaded Simon to change it to &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot;. The album was written and recorded following Simon &amp; Garfunkel&#x27;s &quot;The Concert in Central Park&quot; in 1981, and the world tour of 1982–1983. Several songs intended for &quot;Think Too Much&quot; were previewed on tour, and Art Garfunkel worked on some of the songs with Simon in the studio, with an intention that the finished product would be an all-new Simon &amp; Garfunkel studio album. The album, particularly the title song, was a reflection on Paul&#x27;s relationship with actress Carrie Fisher, and Paul felt that it was too personal to be a Simon &amp; Garfunkel album, instead deciding that it should be a solo album. This greatly annoyed Garfunkel and ensured that there would never again be another Simon &amp; Garfunkel album. Garfunkel left the project and Simon erased all his vocals and reworked the material into a solo album.

On &quot;Think Too Much (a)&quot;, Steve Ferrone was contacted by Nile Rodgers to attend a recording session at the Power Station to record drums. After the initial attempts at recording the song were met with silence from Simon, Rodgers experimented with various effects on his rhythm guitar, which made the instrument out of synch with the original drum track. Despite Rodgers&#x27; insistence that the effects would render it difficult to overdub a new drum track, Ferrone eventually achieved a satisfactory take.

==Reception==
&quot;Hearts and Bones&quot; charted for 18 weeks on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, peaking at No. 35, although it is considered to be a relative commercial failure compared to Simon&#x27;s other recordings.

Don Shewey of &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; concluded that the album &quot;is all about heart versus mind, thinking versus feeling, and how these dichotomies get in the way of making music or love.&quot; He went on to call the songs &quot;subtle&quot;, but added that &quot;the music has a certain playfulness that matches the album&#x27;s cerebral self-consciousness.&quot; In 1986, Robert Christgau of &quot;The Village Voice&quot; referred to the album as being &quot;a finely wrought dead end.&quot; 

In retrospective reviews, William Ruhlmann of AllMusic called &quot;Hearts and Bones&quot; Simon&#x27;s &quot;most personal collection of songs, one of his most ambitious, and one of his best.&quot; Ruhlmann praised the lyrical handling of the subject of romance and the music&#x27;s blending of doo-wop and rock and roll roots with contemporary styles. David Bloom of &quot;PopMatters&quot; found the album to be &quot;riskier, both musically and lyrically,&quot; than its predecessor, &quot;One-Trick Pony&quot; (1980), &quot;and more engrossing for it.&quot; He observed that the album was &quot;so tied to Simon&#x27;s escalating preoccupation with physical and emotional remoteness that it&#x27;s hard to imagine anyone being surprised when it failed to move a fan base waiting for the next &#x27;Late in the Evening&#x27;.&quot;

<text>Air Foyle HeavyLift was a joint venture airline based in Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, England. It specialised in heavy air cargo services. It was the worldwide sales agent for Antonov Airlines of Kyiv, Ukraine. 

== History ==
The company&#x27;s Chairman and joint CEO was Christopher Foyle, also Chairman of Foyle&#x27;s bookshop.

=== Air Foyle ===
Air Foyle started operations as an executive air charter company with one Piper Aztec aircraft in 1978. It grew its fleet of Aztec, Navajo and Chieftain aircraft by carrying passenger, cargo and aerial survey flights. In 1979 it pioneered the overnight carriage of courier traffic between the UK and Europe operating a nightly return flight between Luton and Brussels for Skypak (later a TNT company), and later between Aberdeen and East Midlands Airport (also for TNT). In 1985 it started providing larger cargo aircraft to TNT, by then its principal cargo customer, using wet leased Handley Page Dart Herald aircraft operating nightly from Birmingham to Nuremberg and Hannover and these were later replaced by a BAC One-Eleven jet cargo aircraft and then by a Boeing 737-200QC aircraft wet leased from Aer Lingus. When TNT announced that it would order 72 British Aerospace 146 aircraft converted to freighters, Air Foyle won the contract to operate these aircraft on behalf of TNT, then an Australian company. This operation commenced in May 1987 with one BAe 146 aircraft and rapidly expanded to ten such aircraft which Air Foyle then operated for thirteen years for TNT on a nightly schedule from various airports in the UK and mainland Europe into TNT&#x27;s hub in Cologne and later Liège.

In 1985 Air Foyle took delivery of the first production Edgley EA-7 Optica aerial observation aircraft. Subsequently, while being operated by Hampshire Police this aircraft was destroyed in a fatal accident.

In 1989, following two years of negotiations with the Soviets, Air Foyle became the worldwide General Sales Agent of the Antonov Design Bureau of Kyiv and became responsible for the marketing and sales and commercial and operational management of Antonov&#x27;s fleet of AN-124 heavy cargo aircraft.

Between 1998 and 2000 Air Foyle bid an AN-124 solution for the Ministry of Defence Short-Term Strategic Airlift (STSA) procurement. After a protracted procurement process, Ministers in the Ministry of Defence chose a very much more expensive Boeing C-17 solution. Air Foyle believed it had been misled during the procurement process about the basis for decision on the procurement. The Comptroller and Auditor General later concluded that the procurement process was &quot;that the Department has not fully followed its own preferred practice in evaluating the Short Term Strategic Airlift proposals, but there is no evidence of illegality.&quot;
In 1994 Air Foyle won a contract to operate one Lockheed L-100 Hercules and one Ilyushin Il-76 aircraft on permanent 24/7 standby for Oil Spill Response, to provide immediate response on a worldwide basis in the event of a major oil spillage.

Adopting the TNT aircraft management principle, Air Foyle and then its sister passenger airline Air Foyle Passenger Airlines operated a variety of aircraft including Boeing 707-300F, 737-200, 737-300, 727-200, Airbus A320 and A300 for a number of airline and virtual airline customers including EasyJet, Sunseeker, Sabre, Virgin Express, Debonair, Color Air, and Air Scandic from 1993 until 2000.

=== HeavyLift ===
In 1977 the Trafalgar House Group bought 90% of Transmeridian Air Cargo and on 15 August 1979 merged it with IAS Cargo Airlines to form British Cargo Airlines. In 1978 the HeavyLift division of the carrier acquired five ex-Royal Air Force Shorts Belfast freighters to operate outsized cargo and spent £4 million on the civil certification programme for the aircraft with Marshall Aerospace. British Cargo Airlines collapsed in March 1980, although TAC HeavyLift survived, owned two-thirds by Cunard and one-third by Eurolatin Aviation Ltd. The managing director was P.J. McGoldrick who was later CEO of Ryanair and founder of both TransAer and EU-Jet. The first load carried by a civil Belfast at HeavyLift was containerised agricultural machinery from Amsterdam to Libya. The company later founded Prime Airlines as a passenger charter operation in 2001. 

In the early 1990s HeavyLift joined with the Russian Volga-Dnepr airlines to become the worldwide general sale agent for its outsized cargo operations with AN-124 aircraft. This was similar to UK rival Air Foyle which was the general sales agent for the Ukrainian AN-124 operator Antonov Airlines. Volga-Denpr terminated the agreement in 2001 after ten years of cooperation.

HeavyLift collapsed in 2002 with the closure of HeavyLift Cargo Airlines, Prime Airlines, and HeavyLift Aircraft Engineering. The joint venture Air Foyle HeavyLift was unaffected and continued to operate until 2006. The HeavyLift name continued with two new and independent airlines, HeavyLift Cargo Airlines in Australia and HeavyLift International in the UAE, founded by former employees and investors.

== Joint Venture ==
In 2001, following Volga-Dnepr&#x27;s termination of its deal with HeavyLift, the British rivals Air Foyle and HeavyLift agreed to form a joint venture responsible for the sales and marketing of charters and leases of Antonov Airline&#x27;s fleet of Antonov An-124, Antonov An-225 and Antonov An-22 cargo aircraft. The venture was originally to be named &quot;Antonov Airlines (UK)&quot; but this was changed to Air Foyle HeavyLift.

The new joint venture, &quot;Air Foyle HeavyLift&quot;, became the worldwide General Sales Agent of the Antonov Design Bureau of Kyiv, a function previously held from July 1989 by Air Foyle independently.

Antonov terminated the joint venture on 30 June 2006 to allow it to pursue a joint marketing venture with its erstwhile Russian competitor Volga-Dnepr under the name Ruslan International

Air Foyle and Air Foyle HeavyLift ceased trading in July 2006, AFH closed for business on 31 July 2006.

<text>The British Forces Broadcasting Service (BFBS) provides radio and television programmes for His Majesty&#x27;s Armed Forces, and their dependents worldwide. Editorial control is independent of the Ministry of Defence and the armed forces themselves. It was established by the British War Office (now the Ministry of Defence) in 1943. In 1944, it was managed by Gale Pedrick.

==History==

Originally known as the Forces Broadcasting Service (FBS), it was initially under the control of the British Army Welfare Service, its first effort, the Middle East Broadcasting Unit, being headquartered in Cairo.

Before and after the end of the Second World War various radio stations were set up, some using the FBS name, others using the name British Forces Network (BFN), but by the early 1960s these had all adopted the BFBS name.

From 1982 until 2020, BFBS formed part of the Services Sound and Vision Corporation (SSVC), a registered charity which is also responsible for the British Defence Film Library, SSVC Cinemas (now BFBS Cinemas), and Combined Services Entertainment (CSE; now BFBS Live Events), providing entertainment for HM Forces around the world. In March 2020, most of the properties under the SSVC umbrella were rebranded under the new BFBS and Forces brandings. On 23 July 2020, SSVC was renamed BFBS. BFBS does not carry commercial advertising.

== BFBS Radio ==
BFBS Radio operates 22 radio stations, broadcast on a combination of local DAB, FM and AM frequencies, online and on digital television. BFBS Radio is a music, news, entertainment and community service providing bespoke content to the global Forces Community with a focus on Forces News and connecting the Forces communities around the world.

===Broadcasting===
BFBS broadcasts to service personnel and their families and friends worldwide with local radio studios in Belize, Brunei, Canada, Cyprus, Germany, Gibraltar, the Falkland Islands, Nepal and operational areas. In addition, BFBS the Forces Station is heard by troops in Ascension Island, Bahrain, Belgium, Bosnia, Estonia, and the Netherlands, as well as onboard Royal Navy ships at sea via live satellite links, online at , on Sky channel 0211 in the United Kingdom only, via an Astra 2 transponder and on Freesat channel 786.

From 12 January 2008, BFBS began a trial period of broadcasting nationwide across the UK on DAB, which ran until 31 March 2008. Audience research carried out during the trial concluded that it was successful and broadcasts continued for eight years until 6 March 2017 when the service ceased due to the cost to the charity SSVC.

On 1 April 2013, BFBS began a new 10-year contract for to supply all forces broadcasting service to British troops around the world and expanded its service to UK army bases formerly served by Garrison Radio. BFBS UK base stations now broadcast using DAB in Aldershot, Aldergrove, Blandford, Bovington, Brize Norton, Bulford, Catterick, Colchester, Edinburgh, Fort George, Holywood, Inverness, Lisburn, and Portsmouth.

===Programming===
Bespoke news bulletins are broadcast every hour, 24 hours a day, utilising content from BBC News, IRN and BFBS&#x27;s own team of Forces News reporters. The standard bulletin is three minutes long, with extended ten-minute &quot;Newsplus&quot; programmes on weekdays at 0400, 0700, 1100, 1300 and 1700 UK time. Two-minute-long news and sport headlines are broadcast on the half-hour during breakfast programming. Bulletins are broadcast around the clock on BFBS the Forces Station and BFBS Gurkha Radio, and during BFBS Radio 2&#x27;s music programming.

Many of the programmes on BFBS Radio 2 are sourced from BBC Radio 4 and BBC Radio 5 Live, including the soap opera &quot;The Archers&quot;, which was popular in Hong Kong until BFBS Radio ceased broadcasting on 30 June 1997 before the handover to China. BFBS UK is a contemporary hit &#x27;pop&#x27; station. It is similar in style to BBC Radio 2, playing current music and chat, as well as regular news bulletins.

On 31 May 2010, BBC Radio 1 teamed up with BFBS to transmit the 10-hour takeover show from Camp Bastion with BFBS presenters and shout outs from the military community. It repeated the link-up in 2011.

In December 2011, the UK&#x27;s Smooth Radio broadcast its national breakfast show, presented by Simon Bates, from the BFBS studios in Camp Bastion. On 8 April 2012, Easter Sunday, BFBS simulcast a two-hour show with Smooth, presented jointly by Bates and BFBS&#x27;s Rachel Cochrane, allowing family and friends of serving troops to connect with their loved ones.

===BFBS Radio stations===
BFBS currently has three main stations: BFBS the Forces Station (each with regional content), BFBS Radio 2 and BFBS Gurkha Network. In addition, there are themed online stations under the BFBS branding; they are Beats, Rewind, Best of British (replaced Unwind), Edge (formerly Dirt) and Samishran.

BFBS Gurkha Network broadcasts on AM and DAB in selected UK locations as well as on FM in the Falkland Islands, Afghanistan, Brunei, Nepal, Belize and on Ops. It provides programmes in Nepali, for the Gurkha units serving with the British Army.

BFBS broadcast in Malta until 25 March 1979, when British forces left the islands. It ceased broadcasts from Berlin on 15 July 1994, following the end of the Cold War, German reunification, and the withdrawal of British forces from the city, after 33 years. The BFBS Berlin frequency was given up on 12 December 1994. BFBS broadcast in Hong Kong until 30 June 1997, before Chinese People&#x27;s Liberation Army replaced British forces in the city. BFBS also broadcast on FM in Belize, from Airport Camp near Belize City. These broadcasts could also be received in eastern parts of Guatemala. It ceased broadcasting in Belize in August 2011. The station re-opened in 2016.

====Local stations====
====Themed stations====
== BFBS Television ==
BFBS Television started in Celle, near Hanover in the then West Germany, on 18 September 1975 from Trenchard Barracks. This used taped broadcasts from the BBC and ITV, flown to Germany from London, which were then rebroadcast using low-power UHF transmitters. Live broadcasts of news and sport began in 1982, using a microwave link between the UK and West Germany, extending as far east as West Berlin.

The BFBS TV service used the 625-line PAL system, used in the UK as well as West Germany. By 1982, it was available at 50 sites throughout northern and central regions of West Germany.

It was known as SSVC Television (Services Sound and Vision Corporation) between 1985 and 1997, when it reverted to the BFBS name.
Today it broadcasts live via satellite. DVDs are still sent to forces serving in more remote areas. There was also a service known as Navy TV, which broadcast time-shifted versions of the channel to Royal Navy vessels around the world via military satellite.

===Programmes===
Most programmes came from the BBC, ITV, Channel 4, Channel 5 and Sky, including news from BBC News, Sky News and ITN, and sport from BBC Sport and Sky Sports. BFBS also has its own programmes, including the daily news bulletin programme &quot;Daily Forces News&quot;.

===Availability===
BFBS Television was broadcast in some areas as a terrestrial service in the clear using low-power transmitters to minimise &quot;overspill&quot; to non-service audiences and protect copyright. Despite this, it could be received in West Berlin, and its listings were carried in local German language magazines. However, the signal was largely confined to the British Sector, reflecting the situation with its American counterpart, AFN TV, whose signal was similarly limited to the American Sector.

Until 1997, it was also widely available in Cyprus, but its signal was encrypted or confined to the Sovereign Base Areas of Akrotiri and Dhekelia. Following complaints from local broadcasters like Lumiere TV, which had bought local rights to show English football and other programming, the decision was made to encrypt the signal, starting with Nicosia in April 1997 and ending with Larnaca and Limassol in May 1998. The decision was criticised by MPs in an Early Day Motion. BFBS later ended terrestrial transmissions of its TV channel in Cyprus in January 2009.

However, as a result of card sharing by services personnel, BFBS TV (later BFBS 1) was available to unentitled viewers on the island, along with other channels until 2011, when an illegal pay-TV service was closed down in a joint operation by the Cyprus Police and the Audiovisual Anti-Piracy Alliance.

In the Falkland Islands, SSVC TV was originally only available to entitled viewers in Mount Pleasant, and when a repeater in Sapper Hill was installed by civilians to relay the signal to Stanley in 1988, it was shut down owing to issues related to broadcasting rights for US programming. It was only on Christmas Eve of that year that the service became available to civilian residents. Initially this consisted of prerecorded programmes brought over on cassette from the UK, meaning that they were shown two weeks after the UK, However, in 1997, the channel, by now rebranded as BFBS, was broadcast via satellite, enabling news and sport to be shown on the same day as they had been shown in the UK, but timeshifted by three to four hours to take account of the time difference. This expanded the civilian terrestrial TV service as part of a digital upgrade, which included BFBS 1 and BFBS 2. BFBS 1 and 2 also became available to civilian audiences in Tristan da Cunha.

British Forces and their families stationed at British Army Training Unit Suffield (BATUS), located at Canadian Forces Base Suffield in Canada, had access to BFBS 1, a limited amount of BFBS 2 and BFBS 3 and Sky News on a 7-hour timeshift from CET. During the day, the television channel that BFBS 2/3 broadcast on, played BFBS Radio 1.

===Content and channels===
Until 27 March 2013, there were five BFBS Television services:

*BFBS 1 (launched in September 1975; formerly BFBS Television and SSVC Television) – general programming from chat shows to soap operas, dramas to news, documentaries to sport. Relayed the BBC News Channel overnight and was later replaced by BBC One.
*BFBS 2 (launched in 2001) – a six-hour block of general entertainment and sports programmes shown four times around the clock. Replaced by a variation of BBC Two and merged with BFBS 3 Kids.
*BFBS 3 Kids (launched in 2008) – children&#x27;s programming and factual entertainment.
*BFBS 4 (launched in May 2008) – movie channel with two films a day, each shown six times around the clock.
*BFBS 1 Day Later (launched in 2008) – time-shifted channel which aired programmes from the previous day later at peak time in Afghanistan.

A combined version of the four main channels, called BFBS Navy TV, was available on some naval vessels.

In 2005, BFBS also began distributing commercial networks Kiss TV (previously Q), Sky News, Sky Sports 1 and Sky Sports 2 to certain areas. It also started a movie channel on 2 May 2008, using money that it saved following the Premier League&#x27;s decision to waive the £250,000 rights fee.

In 2010, BFBS also added Nepali TV (a TV channel in the Nepali language, based in the UK) to its channel line-up for the benefit of Gurkha soldiers. This was replaced by Nepal Television (the state TV broadcaster of Nepal) on 1 March 2016.

====Service changes====
SSVC was awarded a new ten-year contract by the Ministry of Defence commencing on 1 April 2013. Fewer overseas troop deployments and reduced budgets resulted in a change to the previous TV service.

Since 27 March 2013, BFBS TV has offered timeshifted versions of BBC One, BBC Two, ITV, as well as two channels of its own. BFBS Extra offers a variety of entertainment programming from W (formerly Watch), Dave, Sky One, National Geographic Channel, ITV2, 3 and 4, the History Channel, Sky Atlantic and previously Channel 4 and Channel 5. BFBS Sport carries sport from BT Sport (replacing ESPN), Sky Sports, and Eurosport.

BBC Two carries children&#x27;s programming from CBBC until the late afternoon or early evening, while BFBS Extra carries programming from CBeebies until the evening. Additionally, the BBC One and ITV feeds are timeshifted to hit peak time in local time zones. Channel 4 and Channel 5 later became available as separate channels in 2019.

====Forces TV====
On 10 June 2014, SSVC launched Forces TV, a new channel aimed at the British Armed Forces. It was available on BFBS, Sky channel 181 in the United Kingdom only, Virgin Media channel 274 in the United Kingdom, Freeview channel 96, Freesat channel 165, and on satellite Eutelsat 10A (10°E) alongside BFBS the Forces Station and on Astra2 satellite 28°E free-to-air. Its content was a mixture of news reports, entertainment, documentaries and features produced by BFBS. It was independent from the Ministry of Defence and was funded through advertising and sponsorship. On 30 June 2022, due to the loss of its Freeview channel slot, Forces TV permanently ceased operations.

== BFBS Online ==
In recent years BFBS services have become available online, in order to allow British service personnel stationed all over the world to stay connect no matter how remote. It is available through the BFBS website and App as well as other media platforms such as YouTube. The BFBS online services allow for free access to the BFBS Radio Service, Entertainment and Sports services, BFBS Forces News (Available also via its own website), Documentaries, Podcasts and inter-service sports competition coverage as well as other BFBS services.

<text>The Kuiseb River is an ephemeral river in western-central Namibia. Its source is in the Khomas Highland west of Windhoek. From there it flows westwards through the Namib-Naukluft National Park and the Namib desert to Walvis Bay. Several settlements of the Topnaar people are on the banks of the lower Kuiseb, for instance Homeb, Sandfontein, Rooibank, and Utuseb. Inflows of the Kuiseb are Gomab, Ojab, Chausib, Gaub, Koam, Nausgomab and Goagos.

The Kuiseb&#x27;s catchment area (including its tributaries) is estimated to be between 15,500 and . It has a mean run-off of roughly . Friedenau Dam, built in 1972, is on the river. In January 2005, for the first time in years, the Kuiseb flowed to the ocean.

Between Naukluft and Namib the Kuiseb carved out a canyon in a barren and inaccessible area. During World War II the area around the Kuiseb Canyon served as a shelter for Henno Martin and Hermann Korn who moved there to wait the war out. Two books and a film were subsequently published about this 2-year stay; the ruins of their shelter can be visited. On its course through the Namib the Kuiseb is bordered on one side by some of the tallest sand dunes in the world, and on the other by barren rock. The red sand dunes south of the river reach heights over 150 meters. The prevailing winds blow the dunes northward, but their movement is blocked by the river. In the process, so much sand and silt is deposited in the Kuiseb that it only reaches the sea while it is in flood.

In 1907, the area between the Swakop River and the Kuiseb was designated by the German colonial administration as a game reserve. The area is currently part of the Namib-Naukluft National Park. The &quot;Desert Research Foundation of Namibia&quot; (DRFN) is located at Gobabeb on the banks of the river.

<doc id="365876" wikidata="Q2472662" url="?curid=365876" title="Distribution function (physics)">
<text>In molecular kinetic theory in physics, a system&#x27;s distribution function is a function of seven variables, formula_1, which gives the number of particles per unit volume in single-particle phase space. It is the number of particles per unit volume having approximately the velocity formula_2 near the position formula_3 and time formula_4. The usual normalization of the distribution function is
formula_5
formula_6
where &quot;N&quot; is the total number of particles and &quot;n&quot; is the number density of particles – the number of particles per unit volume, or the density divided by the mass of individual particles.

A distribution function may be specialised with respect to a particular set of dimensions. E.g. take the quantum mechanical six-dimensional phase space, formula_7 and multiply by the total space volume, to give the momentum distribution, i.e. the number of particles in the momentum phase space having approximately the momentum formula_8.

Particle distribution functions are often used in plasma physics to describe wave–particle interactions and velocity-space instabilities. Distribution functions are also used in fluid mechanics, statistical mechanics and nuclear physics.

The basic distribution function uses the Boltzmann constant formula_9 and temperature formula_10 with the number density to modify the normal distribution:
formula_11

Related distribution functions may allow bulk fluid flow, in which case the velocity origin is shifted, so that the exponent&#x27;s numerator is formula_12, where formula_13 is the bulk velocity of the fluid. Distribution functions may also feature non-isotropic temperatures, in which each term in the exponent is divided by a different temperature.

Plasma theories such as magnetohydrodynamics may assume the particles to be in thermodynamic equilibrium. In this case, the distribution function is &quot;Maxwellian&quot;. This distribution function allows fluid flow and different temperatures in the directions parallel to, and perpendicular to, the local magnetic field. More complex distribution functions may also be used, since plasmas are rarely in thermal equilibrium.

The mathematical analogue of a distribution is a measure; the time evolution of a measure on a phase space is the topic of study in dynamical systems.

<doc id="365892" wikidata="Q3349698" url="?curid=365892" title="United Nations Association of the United States of America">
<text>The United Nations Association of the United States of America (UNA-USA) is a nonprofit grassroots organization dedicated to promoting political and public support for the United Nations among Americans. It is a program of the United Nations Foundation. Its mission includes advocating for greater U.S. leadership at the UN, improving and enhancing the UN system, and implementing the Sustainable Development Goals and the UN Charter in both the U.S. and globally.

UNA-USA&#x27;s activities include public outreach, political lobbying, and community organizing. It hosts youth programs, fellowships, and networking events both locally and nationally. Its flagship events include the Global Engagement Summit at the UN Headquarters in New York City and the Leadership Summit in Washington, D.C. UNA-USA is led by an executive director and governed by a thirty-member national council that meets semi-annually.

Along with its sister organization, the Better World Campaign, UNA-USA is the world&#x27;s largest UN advocacy network. As of 2020, it has over 20,000 members across more than 200 chapters in cities and universities nationwide; the majority of members are under age of twenty-six. It is a member of the World Federation of United Nations Associations, which comprises other national UN advocacy organizations.

== History ==
The United Nations Association of the United States (UNA-USA) was founded during World War II to build American support for a new international organization designed to sustain the peace once the war was won. It considered itself the direct successor of the League of Nations Association, which was founded in 1923. At that time, the term &quot;United Nations&quot; referred to the allied nations fighting against fascism, but some leaders had already begun to embrace it as the brand name for a new international organization. UNA-USA&#x27;s first major initiative was a nationwide tour by a bipartisan group of Congressional leaders, including then Senator Harry Truman, to promote public support for a Congressional resolution for the US to become a member of a postwar organization of &quot;free and sovereign nations.&quot; The resolution, sponsored by Texas Senator Thomas Connally, was adopted with broad bipartisan support in November 1943 giving the Roosevelt administration the mandate it needed to launch the San Francisco Conference where the UN Charter was ultimately signed in 1945.

At the San Francisco Conference, the association (renamed in 1945 as the American Association for the United Nations) served as Secretariat for a coalition of 42 national organizations who were appointed by the State Department to provide input into the negotiations. These 42 &quot;Consultants,&quot; which included such diverse organizations as the NAACP and the American Association of University Women, played a key role in ensuring that the Charter included both a mandate to advance human rights and a provision allowing for the formal participation of civil society organizations in UN deliberations.

When Eleanor Roosevelt, the former First Lady of the United States, completed her term as a US representative to the United Nations General Assembly in 1953, she walked into the association&#x27;s New York office and volunteered to help. This was the quiet beginning of a major campaign in which Mrs. Roosevelt carried the message of UN across the country through personal appearances, recruitment speeches, and fundraising efforts. Mrs. Roosevelt was instrumental in building the association&#x27;s national network of chapters on college campuses and in communities across the US, an effort that continue until her death in 1962.

In 1964, UNA-USA (then still operating under the AAUN name) merged with the US Committee for the United Nations, a group composed of 138 national organizations supporting the work of the United Nations. The newly merged organization returned to the original UNA-USA name. Over the next forty years, UNA-USA would complement its grassroots mission by conducting groundbreaking policy research, convening track two diplomacy with the Soviet Union, and promoting Model UN education programs at home and abroad.

In 2011, UNA-USA merged with the United Nations Foundation combining the association&#x27;s grassroots network and public engagement capacity with the foundation&#x27;s advocacy resources and global convening power. The merger created the largest network of UN advocates worldwide.

== Programs ==

Programs at the UN: UNA-USA&#x27;s Global Engagement Summit hosted at the UN each year in February convenes over 1,500 Americans to engage with UN leaders, from the Secretary-General to Ambassadors of UN member nations, explore the top issues on the global agenda, elevate a diverse range of American voices, and equip UNA-USA members to be leaders on international cooperation in their communities throughout the year. In addition, UNA-USA members are eligible to attend a wide range of UN events throughout the year including the Conference on the Status of Women (CSW) to the UN Civil Society Forum.

Programs in DC: UNA-USA&#x27;s Global Leadership Summit hosted in Washington each year in June gathers over 500 chapter leaders, members, and partners to share best practices on advocating for the UN and advancing the SDG&#x27;s. The summit culminates with UNA-USA&#x27;s lobby day when advocates converge on Capitol Hill to demonstrate that our country is stronger when we don&#x27;t go it alone.

Programs Throughout the Country: UNA-USA chapters host events throughout the year to elevate important issues where the UN plays a critical role, from humanitarian assistance to climate change, and to celebrate local leaders who are advancing global priorities such as the UN&#x27;s Sustainable Development Goals. These events are frequently tied to major International Celebration Days such as International Women&#x27;s Day, Earth Day, and Human Rights Day and often feature community leaders, such as human trafficking task force members or private sector sustainability champions, whose local mission has a global impact. Throughout the month of October, UNA-USA chapters host over 200 events to celebrate the anniversary of the UN&#x27;s founding (October 24).

Education Outreach: Many UNA-USA chapters also partner with local school districts to host or support Model UN programs. In addition, UNA-USA provides free online teaching materials to enable teachers to put kids who may never hold a passport into the shoes of a diplomat by transforming their classrooms in to UN Security Council negotiations.

Seton Hall Partnership: Since 1997, UNA-USA has partnered with Seton Hall&#x27;s School of Diplomacy and International Relations, one of the nation&#x27;s top professional schools of international affairs, to host a wide range of collaborative programs. Every summer, UNA-USA and Seton Hall host graduate students from around the world for a &quot;UN Intensive&quot; course in New York featuring interactive sessions with UN leaders. UNA-USA also hosts the Seton Hall Washington Semester Program and works throughout the year to connect faculty and students to opportunities to participate in UN events.

== Membership ==
UNA-USA has more than 200 chapters in communities and on college campuses across the country and over 20,000 members (60% under the age of 25). These members carry out programs and advocacy campaigns at the local level through a wide range of programs and events.

== Councils ==

The UNA-USA National Council is an elected body of UNA-USA volunteer leaders which guides the organization&#x27;s mission and work. Consisting of 30 representatives elected on a regional basis the National Council meets twice a year to make recommendations on advocacy and other program priorities.

<doc id="365893" wikidata="Q2931475" url="?curid=365893" title="CHUM Limited">
<text>CHUM Limited was a Canadian media company based in Toronto, Ontario in operation from 1945 to 2007. The company was founded in 1945 as York Broadcasters Limited when it launched CHUM-AM 1050 but was acquired by salesman Allan Waters in 1954. CHUM had expanded to and owned 33 radio stations across Canada under its CHUM Radio Network division (now Bell Media Radio) and also owned other radio stations.

The company also operated full or joint control of 15 local television stations under the ATV, Citytv (acquired in 1981) and A-Channel (formerly NewNet, now CTV 2) brands, one CBC Television affiliate, one provincial educational channel, Atlantic Satellite Network in Atlantic Canada, and 20 branded specialty television channels, most notably MuchMusic and its various spin-offs that were launched under Moses Znaimer, the co-founder of CITY-TV, targeting younger audiences.

In July 2006, one year after the death of Waters, CHUM agreed to merge with CTVglobemedia (now Bell Media), owner of the CTV Television Network. The merger was completed on June 22, 2007; regulatory approval was made conditional on the sale of CHUM&#x27;s five Citytv stations to Rogers Communications. The company itself was renamed CTV Limited (now CTV Inc.) and continues as a subsidiary of Bell Media. Its Toronto radio stations TSN RADIO 1050 and CHUM 104.5 continue to use &quot;CHUM&quot; as their call signs. The headquarters were located at 299 Queen Street West in Toronto, the famous CHUM-City Building, which currently serves as Bell Media&#x27;s headquarters.

With the sale of CTVglobemedia to Bell Canada as announced in September 2010, Bell took control of most of CHUM&#x27;s former assets for the first time. CTVglobemedia was subsequently renamed Bell Media on April 1, 2011, after the deal to purchase the stations was finalized and the CHUM name was completely phased out from its new entity, with the exception of radio stations CHUM-AM and CHUM-FM in Toronto.

==History==
===Precursory===
CHUM Limited began operations when CHUM-AM was founded in 1945 by four Toronto businessmen, including Al Leary, a former sportscaster, who had been the station manager at CKCL for 14 years. CHUM received its licence in late November 1944 to operate a station with 1000 watts. CHUM launched as a dawn-to-dusk radio station under York Broadcasters Limited on 28 October 1945, with John H.Q. &quot;Jack&quot; Part, an entrepreneur in the business of patent medicines, as its president. The station, then operating from studios in the Mutual Street Arena, broadcast a format typical of the late 1940s, with a combination of information, music, and sports. When CHUM was about to debut, Leary told the press that the new station would be known for community service and in-depth news, in addition to live talent and the most popular phonograph records.

Allan Waters, a salesman from Part&#x27;s patent medicine business took control of CHUM-AM in 1954. Waters&#x27; first major move was to secure a licence for 24-hour-a-day broadcasting for CHUM, along with a power increase to 5,000 watts. On April 17, 1959, the name York Broadcasters was changed to CHUM 1050 Radio Ltd.. The CHUM studios were moved from 250 Adelaide Street West to 1331 Yonge Street, Toronto, where their iconic neon sign was erected for the first time. CHUM-FM would begin broadcasting in 1963 under a Classical Music/Fine Arts format. Alex Forbes, whose accounting firm Ewin &amp; Forbes had been CHUM&#x27;s auditor since 1952, joined CHUM 1050 Radio Ltd. as Secretary-Treasurer. He would play a pivotal role in the company&#x27;s development.

===Entering into the television world===
The company expanded into television holdings for the first time when it gained a one-third interest in CBC affiliate CKVR-TV, a station founded by Ralph Snelgrove (whose first initial and that of his wife, Valerie, form part of the station&#x27;s callsign), in Barrie. It acquired a second one-third share in 1968, and eventually gained full control in 1970.

On May 12, 1967, under the corporate name CHUM Limited, Allan Waters took the rapidly expanding company public. At the same time, Alex Forbes was appointed to the Board of Directors of CHUM Limited, while it received approval to acquire Ottawa&#x27;s Radio CFRA Limited and control of two key stations in the market: CFRA-AM and CFMO-FM. CHUM-AM launched the CHUM Christmas Wish, evolving out of The CHUM Kids Crusade, and operating in conjunction with The CHUM Charitable Foundation. This would become an annual event for over forty years under the CHUM-City Christmas Wish, and currently, the CP24 CHUM Christmas Wish.

CITY-TV – the Toronto UHF station launched with great flair and style in 1972 by Moses Znaimer – ran into financial debt by 1975. Multiple Access Ltd. (the owners of CFCF in Montreal) purchased 45% of the station in 1977, and sold its stake to CHUM Limited three years later. CITY was purchased outright by CHUM in 1981 with the sale of Moses Znaimer&#x27;s interest in the station. In 1987, CITY and the other CHUM-owned television stations moved to the CHUM-City Building at 299 Queen Street West, which became one of the most recognizable landmarks in the city. The CHUM Radio Building at 1331 Yonge Street remained CHUM Limited&#x27;s corporate headquarters.

===Specialty additions===
Between 1984 and 1999, CHUM Limited expanded into many new television holdings such as MuchMusic, Star!, Space, Bravo!, CP24, SexTV: The Channel, Fashion Television Channel, Canadian Learning Television, and many others. In September 1995, CKVR disaffiliated from the CBC after 30 years, and was re-launched as an independent station with a more youthful image in order to generate interest from viewers in the neighbouring Toronto market, where CKVR had long been available on basic cable. This included adopting a news format similar to the CityPulse newscasts on CITY, replacing its various classic TV shows with more contemporary series, and picking up a package of games for the Toronto Raptors, Toronto&#x27;s then-new NBA franchise. The resulting station became known as &quot;The New VR&quot;. That same year, the CHUM Radio Network was established to deliver syndicated radio programs across Canada.

The experiment was successful enough that CHUM replicated CKVR&#x27;s format on several stations it had acquired from Baton Broadcasting in 1997, including CHRO in Pembroke, CFPL in London, CKNX in Wingham, and CHWI in Windsor. Most of these stations were also former CBC affiliates, and all were in markets where CKVR&#x27;s sister station, CITY-TV, were already available on basic cable. CIVI in Victoria, British Columbia was added into the system by CHUM at its launch in October 2001. A month prior, CHUM bought CKVU from CanWest Global and it became Citytv Vancouver on July 22, 2002. Prior to CHUM&#x27;s acquisition of CKVU, some Citytv programming was syndicated to KVOS in nearby Bellingham, Washington.

===Final years===
Moses Znaimer retired from active management at CHUM in April 2003, and briefly continued to work on projects with the company, before moving on to other ventures such as ZoomerMedia.

On December 1, 2004, CHUM purchased Craig Media Inc., which owned five local TV stations, mainly in the Prairies, and three digital specialty services, for $265 million CAD. While Craig&#x27;s three largest stations were integrated into Citytv, Craig&#x27;s Toronto station CKXT-TV (then branded &quot;Toronto 1&quot;, now Sun TV) was sold to Quebecor. In addition to its own stations, CHUM was one of several sources (alongside Canwest&#x27;s CH / E! and Global TV) providing syndicated programming to independently owned CBC and CTV affiliates.

CHUM announced in February 2005 that the NewNet stations would be relaunched under the A-Channel brand by that fall; the rebrand took place on August 2, 2005, the same date when the former A-Channel stations in Winnipeg, Edmonton and Calgary, recently acquired by CHUM from Craig Media, were relaunched under the Citytv brand. At the same time, CHUM announced plans to consolidate the master control departments for CKVR, CFPL, CHRO, CHWI and CKNX at 299 Queen Street West in Toronto, as well as the traffic and programming departments at CFPL, resulting in the loss of approximately nine staff members from CKVR. The switch occurred on June 3, 2005.

Allan Waters stepped down from the CHUM Limited Board of Directors in October and became an honorary director. On December 3, 2005, Waters died in Toronto at the age of 84. Following tributes from across Canada, more than 2,000 attended a celebration of his life at Toronto&#x27;s Westin Harbour Castle Conference Centre.

===Sale to CTVglobemedia===
On July 12, 2006, CHUM announced that it had agreed to a takeover by Bell Globemedia, renamed CTVglobemedia and now Bell Media, (herein abbreviated &quot;CTV&quot; or &quot;CTVgm&quot; for brevity), in a transaction valuing CHUM at $1.7 billion CAD. The takeover required approval from two regulatory bodies, the Competition Bureau, which approved the transaction on March 2, and the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC), which held a public hearing beginning April 30, 2007 in Gatineau.

CTVgm&#x27;s takeover bid was completed on October 30, although CHUM was immediately in a blind trust under lawyer John McKellar.

Immediately following the announcement, CHUM separately announced 281 layoffs, primarily at its local stations in western Canada; local newscasts (other than &quot;Breakfast Television&quot; and the Noon News in Calgary and Edmonton) at all Citytv stations in the region were immediately pulled. CHUM claims the layoffs were part of an ongoing process to streamline its operations and not directly related to the takeover.

On June 8, 2007, the CRTC approved the CTV takeover of CHUM. However, the CRTC made the deal conditional on CTV divesting itself of Citytv rather than A-Channel. This consequently voided the Rogers deal; on June 11, 2007, Rogers announced that it has agreed to buy the Citytv stations. CTV said it would keep all other assets, except CHUM&#x27;s interest in MusiquePlus/MusiMax, and potentially CKX-TV and CLT.

The sale of the CHUM Limited properties to CTVglobemedia was completed on June 22, 2007 with CTVgm as the sole owner of CHUM. The Citytv stations remained under blind trust awaiting sale to Rogers Media (see below).

Following the takeover less than a month, Richard Gray was named head of news for the A-Channel stations and CKX-TV (another station in the CHUM acquisition). Gray reports directly to the CTVgm corporate group instead of CTV News to preserve independent news presentation and management. Gray now oversees CKVR and the other news departments; CHRO, CFPL, CKNX, CHWI, CIVI and CKX-TV.

===Additional developments===
With CHUM Limited dissolved, there were a number of changes. Between 2008 and 2009, Corus Entertainment acquired SexTV: The Channel, CLT, and Drive-In Classics from CTV Ltd. for an estimated worth of $73 million and $40 million each. However, it was announced that CTVglobemedia would be selling CKX-TV in Brandon, Manitoba to Bluepoint Investment Corporation for a dollar. But that station was closed down on October 2, 2009, after Bluepoint rejected the deal the day before. At the same time, they shut down CKNX-TV.

For Citytv, the transaction was worth over $375 million. Media analysts have suggested that with a more powerful media conglomerate such as Rogers behind them the Citytv stations will effectively become Canada&#x27;s fourth full-fledged commercial television network, in effect if not immediately in name. The Citytv transaction was approved by the CRTC on September 28, 2007, and Rogers officially became Citytv&#x27;s new owner on October 31. Rogers subsequently purchased 33 Dundas Street East, the former Olympic Spirit building, located at the edge of Dundas Square for the use of its Toronto television stations, and CITY-TV moved out from 299 Queen Street West into the new facility on September 8, 2009. In 2010, CP24 extended their 5:00pm newscast after the announcement regarding their massive firings taking place at Rogers Media&#x27;s Citytv stations across Canada including the cancellation of Citytv Toronto&#x27;s &quot;CityNews at Five&quot;. That same year, Corus relaunched CLT as &quot;Viva&quot;, then OWN: Oprah Winfrey Network on March 1, 2011. As well, Star! will be relaunched as E! on November 29, 2010 after CTV announced it had signed a multi-year deal with Comcast. CHUM eventually acquired CFXJ-FM from Milestone Radio that same year since the sale to CTVgm.

As Shaw Communications purchasing the Global Television Network and the Canwest television properties, Vidéotron launching its wireless telephone network with video content as a key selling point, and the enormous popularity of wireless and Internet video and other media streams at the 2010 Vancouver Olympics, Bell once again sought to bring a content provider into its portfolio. It was announced to re-acquire 100% of the company&#x27;s broadcasting arm in September 2010, including CTV Limited. Under the deal, Woodbridge, Torstar, and Teachers&#x27; received $1.3 billion in either cash or equity in BCE, while BCE will also assume $1.7 billion in debt (BCE&#x27;s existing equity interest is $200 million, for a total transaction value of $3.2 billion). Woodbridge will simultaneously regain majority control of &quot;The Globe and Mail&quot;, with Bell retaining a 15% interest. The deal is expected to close by mid-2011 pending CRTC approval. CTVglobemedia officially became Bell Media when the deal was finalized on April 1, 2011. At the same time, CHUM Limited / CTV Limited became CTV Inc. (now Bell Media Inc.). and CHUM Radio became Bell Media Radio.

==Corporate governance==
The last board of directors of CHUM Limited were: Gordon Craig, Denise Donlon, Lawrence Lamb, John Mattenley, Fred Sherratt, Robert Sutherland, Jay Switzer, Catherine Tait, James Waters (chairman), Marjorie Waters, and Ron Waters. Allan Waters retired from the board on October 29, 2005.

==Radio stations at time of sale==

In November, 2004, CHUM and Astral Media filed an application with the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission for a subscription radio service in Canada. That application, along with two satellite radio services, were approved by the CRTC on June 16, 2005. While the two satellite services launched soon after the decision, CHUM did not implement its service, the authority for which expired on June 16, 2007 (two years after licensing).

<text>Büsingen am Hochrhein (, ; Alemannic: &#x27;, ), often known simply asBüsingen, is a German municipality () in the south of Baden-Württemberg with a population of about 1,548 inhabitants. It is an exclave of Germany and Baden-Württemberg, and an enclave of Switzerland, entirely surrounded by the Swiss cantons of Schaffhausen, Zürich, and Thurgau. It is separated from the rest of Germany by a narrow strip of land (at its narrowest, about wide) containing the Swiss village of Dörflingen. Büsingen is approximately 5 km (3.1 mi) from the town of Schaffhausen and 3 km (1.8 mi) from Dörflingen, the nearest village. Its status as an exclave dates to before the formation of the modern German and Swiss states, having previously been a detached part of Further Austria, the Kingdom of Württemberg and the Grand Duchy of Baden.

Politically Büsingen is part of Germany, forming part of the district of Konstanz, but economically it forms part of the Swiss customs union, along with the principality of Liechtenstein and up until 2019, albeit unofficially, the Italian village of Campione d&#x27;Italia. As such there have been no border controls between Switzerland and Büsingen since 4 October 1967.

Büsingen is a holiday destination for much of the year and attracts a significant number of visitors from around the region as well as from further afield, for its recreational areas along the Rhine and proximity to the Rheinfall waterfalls in nearby Neuhausen am Rheinfall. Many dwellings in Büsingen are holiday flats that are accompanied by a number of small guest houses.

==History==
In the Middle Ages Büsingen was part of the Landgraviate of Nellenburg, whose came under Habsburg (Austrian) control in 1465. From then until 1805 Nellenburg formed part of Further Austria, a collection of various scattered Austrian possessions in Swabia. Austrian sovereignty did not go unchallenged by the Confederate Swiss of neighbouring Schaffhausen; an incident in 1693 in which Austrian feudal lord Eberhard Im Thurn was abducted and incarcerated by Swiss authorities, and the subsequent diplomatic dispute, played a particular role in the village being kept away from Swiss control.
In 1805, during the Napoleonic Wars, Austria was forced to cede Further Austria to Napoleon&#x27;s allies in the Peace of Pressburg; Büsingen became part of the Kingdom of Württemberg. In 1810 it passed to the Grand Duchy of Baden in a ; these borders were confirmed by the Congress of Vienna in 1815. In 1871 Baden, including Büsingen, became part of the German Empire.

In 1918, after the First World War, a referendum was held in Büsingen in which 96% of voters voted to become part of Switzerland. However no land transfer took place as Switzerland could not offer anything suitable in exchange. Later attempts to transfer the village to Swiss sovereignty were unsuccessful and consequently Büsingen has remained an exclave of Germany ever since.

During the Second World War, Switzerland effectively shut down the border, leaving Büsingen cut off from the rest of the Third Reich. German soldiers on home leave were required to deposit their weapons at the border guards&#x27; posts in Gailingen am Hochrhein. The Swiss customs officers would then supply them with greatcoats to cover up their German uniforms for the duration of their short journey through Dörflingen (Swiss territory) to their homes in Büsingen.

By the time of the Yalta Conference in early 1945, a complete German defeat was inevitable. The inter-zonal borders of Allied-occupied Germany were finalized at this conference, with Büsingen assigned to the French zone. Once again, the Swiss government refused to consider annexing the town on the grounds that any transfer of territory could only be negotiated with a sovereign German government, which ceased to exist following the German surrender. From the Swiss perspective, any unilateral annexation of the territory of her defeated neighbour (no matter how small) would have been viewed both within and outside Switzerland as a tacit recognition of the victors&#x27; right to also adjust Germany&#x27;s postwar borders. While German-speaking Swiss had not generally been sympathetic to Nazism, public opinion in Switzerland was often critical of elements of the post-war settlement, including the permanent removal of Germany&#x27;s easternmost territories and the expulsion of ethnic Germans from those regions; hence it would have been controversial within Switzerland for its government to act in a similar manner, with respect to Büsingen.

Nevertheless, the Swiss shared Allied concerns that the exclave might become a haven for Nazi war criminals; thus, an agreement was quickly reached to allow limited numbers of French soldiers to cross Switzerland for the purpose of maintaining law and order in Büsingen. Following the formation of the Federal Republic (West Germany), Büsingen became part of the new state of Baden-Württemberg in 1952 (until then it was part of (South) Baden).

On 9 September 1957, a conference between Switzerland and West Germany was held in Locarno, with the aim of regulating the jurisdictions of both countries in Büsingen.

Büsingen&#x27;s official name was altered from &quot;Büsingen (Oberrhein)&quot; to &quot;Büsingen am Hochrhein&quot; on 6 December 1961.

A treaty signed much later (on 23 November 1964) came into effect on 4 October 1967. The exclave of Büsingen was formally defined in this treaty. At the same time, the West German exclave of Verenahof, consisting of just three houses and eleven West German citizens, became part of Switzerland, whilst Büsingen&#x27;s &quot;de facto&quot; customs union with Switzerland, begun in 1947, was made official.

==Geography==
Büsingen am Hochrhein has an area of . Its border with Switzerland is long and is marked by 123 stones. One named stone, the Hattinger Stone, marks the Büsingen-Dörflingen boundary. Along with several other border points, it is situated in the river Rhine.

Büsingen is situated close to the city of Schaffhausen. In the outlying hamlet of &quot;Stemmer&quot; the border between German and Swiss territory runs down the middle of a road. Houses on one side of the road are in Switzerland, houses on the other side are in Germany.

Büsingen is not part of the customs territory of the European Union but belongs to the Swiss customs territory. Although Büsingen is otherwise a German village, EU economic regulations (other than those covered by SwissEU treaties) do not apply there.

Within the territory of Büsingen am Hochrhein are the sites of two abandoned villages Eggingen and Gluringen.

== Peculiarities of Büsingen am Hochrhein ==
===Currency===
Büsingen is the only German village in which people pay mostly with Swiss francs, although technically the euro is legal tender as throughout Germany. Until the late 1980s, the Deutsche Mark was not accepted in Büsingen. Even the Büsingen post office accepted only Swiss francs for payment of German stamps. Despite the Deutsche Mark and later the euro being accepted, today Swiss francs are still more popular, since most residents in employment are cross-border commuters working in Switzerland and as such are paid in Swiss francs.

===Electricity===
Electricity is provided by Switzerland and as such is billed in Swiss francs with there being no choice of supplier. Wall sockets are generally standard German Schuko sockets, as in the rest of Germany, though some owners may have opted to install Swiss sockets in their properties.

===Health insurance===
Residents of Büsingen am Hochrhein can opt to take out a health insurance policy either in Switzerland or in Germany (coverage is mandatory for residents of both countries).

===Law and policing===
The treaty between the two countries defines which areas of law are governed by Swiss legislation and which ones come under German legislation. Since there are no border checks between Büsingen and Switzerland, the cantonal police of Schaffhausen are permitted to arrest people in Büsingen and bring them into Switzerland. The number of Swiss police officers is limited to ten at any one time and the number of German police officers to three per 100 inhabitants, which means roughly forty-five, given the current population of around 1,540. German police officers travelling to Büsingen however must use designated routes and refrain from all official acts while crossing Swiss territory.

===Postal services===
There is a German post office in Büsingen that also provides Swiss postal services at Swiss inland rates. Büsingen has two postal codes, one German, D-78266, formerly D-7701, and one Swiss, CH-8238. Letters from Büsingen may be franked with a Swiss or a German stamp. A standard letter from Büsingen to Switzerland needs either an 85 Rappen Swiss stamp or a 80 euro cent German one.

Deutsche Post is responsible for delivering of post (letters and almost all parcels) in Büsingen, though some services are provided by Swiss Post. Other letter and parcel delivery services that operate in Germany such as Hermes do not deliver to Büsingen as they are not authorized to cross into the Swiss customs area to be able to reach the German exclave.

Goods sent from outside of the European customs area may pass through two separate customs checks: the first upon entering Germany proper, the second upon entering Büsingen itself. This can however be avoided by addressing mail shipped to Büsingen as if it were part of Switzerland, using the Swiss postal code. Goods entering Büsingen must comply with Swiss customs rules and are subject to Swiss customs duties and taxes.

===Telecommunications===
Residents of Büsingen can be reached by telephone using either a German number (with the prefix +49) or a Swiss one (with the prefix +41) or both, depending on which telephone or internet service provider(s) the resident has opted to have a contract with. Dwellings generally have both countries&#x27; phone sockets.

===School===
Büsingen has a kindergarten, the current building of which opened in 1987. By 1988, however, it was overcrowded, so the building was extended. Children attend primary school in Büsingen, and subsequently their parents may choose either a Swiss school or a German school for their secondary education.

===Sports===

The local association football team, FC Büsingen, is the only German team to play in the Swiss Football League.

===Taxation===
The much lower (compared to standard German VAT at 19%) Swiss VAT is applied to purchases made in Büsingen. It is levied at a rate of 7.7% on most commercial exchanges of goods and services. Certain exchanges, including those of basic or essential foodstuffs, drugs, books and newspapers, are subject to a reduced VAT of 2.5%. A special reduced rate of 3.7% is in use in the hotel industry.

Büsingen residents, regardless of nationality, are treated as third-country nationals with regards to VAT payable in the rest of Germany and the EU. As such residents who export purchases made in the EU to Büsingen are able to claim back the VAT paid on said purchases subsequent to exporting. Nevertheless, imports into Büsingen (via Switzerland) where applicable, are subject to Swiss importing limits, duty and VAT.

Despite further income tax breaks specific to Büsingen, younger Büsingers who work (in Switzerland or Germany) pay approximately double the amount of income tax compared to their colleagues who reside in neighbouring Swiss towns and villages, causing many young people to move away from Büsingen into Switzerland and thus the village&#x27;s population to decrease notably in recent years. Büsingen has the highest average age of residents in the whole of Baden-Württemberg.

Most Büsingen residents are pensioners; many are from Switzerland, for as in the rest of Germany they pay little or no tax on their pensions. This advantage is however progressively being phased out and by 2040 will no longer exist.

Büsingen is one of just a handful of municipalities in Germany not to levy any property tax. The business tax levied in Büsingen is the lowest in Baden-Württemberg.

Payable Skype services have been unavailable in Büsingen since 1 January 2015 due to a change in VAT laws.

===Time zone===
In the time zone database, there is a special area for this place, Europe/Büsingen, that had a different time compared to the rest of West Germany in 1980 when West Germany, but not Switzerland, observed daylight saving time.

===Transport===
Büsingen is served by PostBus Switzerland with a regular connection to the German village Randegg, the Swiss villages Ramsen, Buch and Dörflingen, as well as the city and railway station of Schaffhausen.

Südbadenbus from Germany also serves the village with a twice daily bus connection to Gailingen am Hochrhein. The bus passes through Swiss territory to reach the main village of Büsingen and the outlying settlement Stemmer.

From spring to autumn, the URh offers regular boat services on the High Rhine and Untersee between Schaffhausen and Kreuzlingen, via Konstanz.

===Vehicle registration===

Büsingen has its own licence plate &quot;(BÜS)&quot;, even though it is part of Constance district, which has the &quot;KN&quot; sign. These special licence plates were created to simplify the job of Swiss customs officers. Vehicles with &quot;BÜS&quot; licence plates are treated as if they were Swiss vehicles for customs purposes.

&quot;BÜS&quot; is one of the rarest licence plates in use in Germany as there are only around 700 in use at any one time. The letters &quot;BÜS&quot; are almost always followed by an &quot;A&quot; with the occasional exception for provisionally admitted vehicles or those purchased in Switzerland, which have the letter &quot;Z&quot;.

<doc id="365905" wikidata="Q2064189" url="?curid=365905" title="Babes in Toyland (1934 film)">
<text>Babes in Toyland is a Laurel and Hardy musical Christmas film released on November 30, 1934. The film is also known by the alternative titles &quot;Laurel and Hardy in Toyland&quot;, &quot;Revenge Is Sweet&quot; (the 1948 European reissue title), and March of the Wooden Soldiers (in the United States), a 73-minute abridged version.

Based on Victor Herbert&#x27;s popular 1903 operetta &quot;Babes in Toyland&quot;, the film was produced by Hal Roach, directed by Gus Meins and Charles Rogers, and distributed by Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer. There are two computer-colorized versions between The Samuel Goldwyn Company in 1991 and Legend Films in 2006.

Although the 1934 film makes use of many of the characters in the original play, as well as several of the songs, the plot is almost completely unlike that of the original stage production. In contrast to the stage version, the film&#x27;s story takes place entirely in Toyland, which is inhabited by Mother Goose (Virginia Karns) and other well-known fairy tale characters.

==Plot==

Stannie Dum and Ollie Dee inhabit a shoe residence alongside Mother Peep, Bo Peep, and a diverse array of children. Their tranquil existence is disrupted by the malevolent Silas Barnaby, who harbors intentions to wed Bo Peep and seize control of their shoe abode through foreclosure. Faced with imminent eviction, Ollie impulsively offers their meager savings to stave off the threat, unaware that Stannie has squandered the funds on peewees.

Subsequent attempts to procure the mortgage funds from their employer, the Toymaker, result in calamity when a misguided toy order leads to chaos in the toy shop, resulting in their dismissal. In a desperate gambit to thwart Barnaby, the duo embarks on a futile burglary endeavor, culminating in their arrest and sentencing to banishment in Bogeyland. Despite Bo Peep&#x27;s reluctant agreement to Barnaby&#x27;s demands to spare their lives, Stannie and Ollie endure a dunking and face impending exile.

Employing guile and resourcefulness, Stannie and Ollie devise a cunning scheme to disrupt Barnaby&#x27;s machinations during Bo Peep&#x27;s wedding ceremony. By unveiling Stannie in Bo Peep&#x27;s bridal attire, they expose Barnaby&#x27;s treachery and obliterate the mortgage, thus freeing Bo Peep.

However, Barnaby exacts vengeance by framing Bo Peep&#x27;s true love, Tom-Tom, for &quot;pignapping,&quot; leading to his unjust banishment to Bogeyland. In a race against time, Stannie and Ollie unravel Barnaby&#x27;s scheme, ultimately rescuing Tom-Tom and exposing Barnaby&#x27;s villainy to the townspeople. A climactic confrontation unfolds in Bogeyland, where Tom-Tom valiantly defends Bo Peep from Barnaby&#x27;s advances, while Stannie and Ollie join the fray to repel the Bogeymen. The film crescendos with the triumphant march of the wooden soldiers, orchestrated by Stannie and Ollie, driving back the Bogeymen and vanquishing Barnaby, restoring peace to Toyland.

As the kingdom celebrates its salvation, a comedic mishap ensues when Stannie and Ollie inadvertently bombard Ollie with darts from a malfunctioning cannon.

==Songs==

The film features only six musical numbers from the enormous stage score, though that is fitting for a musical with only a 78-minute running time. Included in the film, in the order in which they are performed, are: &quot;Toyland&quot; (opening), &quot;Never Mind Bo-Peep&quot;, &quot;Castle in Spain&quot;, &quot;Go to Sleep (Slumber Deep)&quot;, and &quot;March of the Toys&quot; (an instrumental piece).

Also included in the film is an instrumental version of &quot;I Can&#x27;t Do the Sum&quot; for the running theme of Laurel and Hardy&#x27;s scenes. Another song, &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?&quot;, is not one of the original stage songs but appears in the Three Little Pigs segment, heard only as an instrumental piece.

The opening song is performed by Mother Goose and an offscreen chorus; most of the others are sung by Bo Peep and/or Tom-Tom. While none of the songs is performed by Laurel and Hardy, the two briefly dance and march in a memorable scene to &quot;March of the Toys&quot;.

==Production==

RKO Pictures originally purchased the rights in 1930 with the plans of filming the musical partly in two-strip Technicolor. Plans were announced to have Bebe Daniels (later Irene Dunne) star in the musical along with the comedy team of Wheeler and Woolsey. Due to the backlash against musicals in the autumn of 1930, the plans were dropped. A couple of years later, some thought was given to filming the musical as an animated feature film to be shot in Technicolor by Walt Disney, however, the projected price of the film gave pause to RKO&#x27;s plans. Hal Roach, who had seen the play as a boy, acquired the film rights to the project in November 1933.

The film was completed in November 1934. The village of Toyland was built on sound stages at Hal Roach Studios with the buildings painted in vivid storybook colors, leading Stan Laurel to regret that the film wasn&#x27;t shot in Technicolor. The film was originally produced in sepia tone and later colorized.

Walt Disney personally approved the appearance of Mickey Mouse in the film along with the use of the song &quot;Who&#x27;s Afraid of the Big Bad Wolf?&quot;.

==Reception==

Critics&#x27; reviews were positive. Andre Sennwald of &quot;The New York Times&quot; called the film &quot;an authentic children&#x27;s entertainment and quite the merriest of its kind that Hollywood has turned loose on the nation&#x27;s screens in a long time.&quot; &quot;Variety&quot; proclaimed it &quot;a film par excellence for children. It&#x27;s packed with laughs and thrills and is endowed with that glamour of mysticism which marks juvenile literature.&quot; John Mosher wrote in &quot;The New Yorker&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;s certainly far more successful than was last year&#x27;s &quot;Alice in Wonderland&quot;, and the children will probably be far less bored by it than they generally are by those films designed especially for them&quot;. &quot;Film Daily&quot; called it &quot;delightful musical fantasy&quot; and &quot;dandy entertainment&quot;. The &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; review read: &quot;It&#x27;s been many a long day since I&#x27;ve had so much pure (and I MEAN pure!) fun as I had watching this picture&quot;.

&quot;Babes in Toyland&quot;, one of many feature films with Stan Laurel and Oliver Hardy, was also popular at the box office. However, many years later in a filmed interview, Hal Roach admitted that on its first release, the film lost money. After it appeared in theaters, it was re-released several times with the title constantly changed, to make it seem to audiences that they were going to see a different film. It surfaced as a holiday movie on TV as &quot;March of the Wooden Soldiers&quot;, where it was rerun annually on some local affiliates for many years. On one local Atlanta station, the film was shown as a Thanksgiving special only a few weeks before the release of its 1961 Disney Technicolor remake, so that those who saw it on television and then saw the Disney film version over the Christmas holiday had the experience of seeing two different versions of the same work, within a few weeks of each other.

A holiday staple, this film was shown by many television stations in the United States during the Thanksgiving/Christmas holiday season, each year, during the 1960s and 1970s. In New York City, it continues to run (as of 2024) on WPIX as &quot;March of the Wooden Soldiers&quot;, airing on that station in the daytime on Thanksgiving Day and Christmas Day. It also runs nationally, on occasion, on This TV, as well as Turner Classic Movies.

==Copyright status==

The original 79-minute film is under copyright to Prime TV Inc., the assets of which as of the present time are owned by television station WPIX (and its current owners, Mission Broadcasting), with Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer (under Orion Pictures, which like MGM is now part of Amazon) still handling partial distribution rights of the film, making this one of the few films that were not part of MGM&#x27;s pre-May 1986 library which Ted Turner purchased it.

In 1950, a 73-minute edited version was distributed by Lippert Pictures, retitled &quot;March of the Wooden Soldiers&quot;; it was released without a copyright notice. The edited version of the film had the opening tune &quot;Toyland&quot; trimmed and the &quot;Go to Sleep (Slumber Deep)&quot; number cut completely. Also removed were Barnaby&#x27;s attempted abduction of Little Bo-Peep and his ultimate fistfight with Tom-Tom. &quot;March of the Wooden Soldiers&quot; has been distributed by many motion picture and home video companies over the decades, as if it were in the public domain; however, because it relies entirely on copyrighted material from the 1934 film, &quot;March of the Wooden Soldiers&quot; itself falls under the same copyright as its parent film and will not truly enter the public domain until that film&#x27;s copyright expires in 2030. WPIX has not enforced its copyright on &quot;March of the Wooden Soldiers&quot;, effectively making the film an orphan work.

==History==
Hal Roach first sold the film in 1944 to the Victor Herbert estate, and at this point, the film’s copyright was reassigned to Federal Films. Shortly thereafter, the rights reverted to film partners Boris Morros and William LeBaron. In 1948, film producer Joe Auerbach acquired the picture and leased most of his distribution rights to Erko, and it was beginning with this distribution deal that the film began to be edited down to alternate versions, in this case, a 75-minute revised reissue. By 1950, Lippert Pictures acquired some distribution rights, and as aforementioned, cut the film further to 73 minutes. Later in the 1950s, television rights were licensed to Quality Pictures, and by 1952 TV rights reverted to Peerless Television Productions.

New York TV station WPIX’s long association with the film began with its initial airing on December 24, 1952, and it has aired almost annually ever since. Meanwhile, by 1968, Prime TV Films would acquire ownership of the film, and as previously mentioned, they have been the copyright holders of the film ever since. In the 1970s, Thunderbird Films released 16mm prints drawn from a heavily spliced (and incomplete) master. In the 1980s, WPIX and its then-owner, Tribune Broadcasting, leased the film to The Samuel Goldwyn Company. The Samuel Goldwyn Company&#x27;s select holdings (particularly the non-Samuel Goldwyn-produced films) ultimately became part of the Orion Pictures library. Finally, Orion became a division of Metro-Goldwyn-Mayer, thus after nearly eight decades, bringing partial rights full circle. Since 1984, the underlying rights to the film have been the property of WPIX and its successive owners.

In 1991, the complete film was restored and colorized by American Film Technologies for television showings and video release by The Samuel Goldwyn Company. In 2006, the complete print was again restored and colorized by Legend Films, using the latest technology. Although the Legend Films release was advertised under its reissue title, both the color and black-and-white prints featured the original title and opening credits.

<text>Much is a Canadian English language discretionary specialty channel owned by BCE Inc. through its Bell Media subsidiary that airs programming aimed at teenagers and young adults. It is headquartered at 299 Queen Street West in what was once called the MuchMusic World Headquarters.

This channel was originally launched on August 31, 1984 as MuchMusic, under the ownership of CHUM Limited, the owner of Citytv Toronto, though &quot;Much&quot; has been the branding most commonly seen on-air since 1997. In 2006, Bell Globemedia acquired MuchMusic and its parent CHUM Limited, but regulatory limits in media ownership forced CHUM to sell off the Citytv stations to avoid conflicts with CTV stations in the same markets. CTVglobemedia retained the ownership of MuchMusic along with CP24 and the small market A-Channel stations. Much was acquired yet again by Bell Media in 2011.

This channel originally focused on music programming, including blocks of music videos and original series focusing on Canadian musicians. Due to shrinking interest in music television because of the growth of online platforms, MuchMusic had increasingly focused on non-music programming targeting a young adult audience, such as comedy, films, and reality shows, and the network has cancelled the majority of its music programming due to budget and staffing cuts. This channel was officially renamed &quot;Much&quot; in 2013 in reflection of its decreasing reliance on music-related programming. From 2021 onward, the &quot;MuchMusic&quot; branding has been used exclusively for its digital media network, which operates in parallel with the linear &quot;Much&quot; TV channel.

Since its launch, MuchMusic had expanded internationally such as the United States in 1994 (now known as Fuse), Europe and beyond. This channel began to launch multiple spinoffs throughout its existence under the Much brand such as MuchMoreMusic in 1998 targeting older adult demographic and a suite of channels ranging from hip hop, rock, retro and request call-in channels throughout the 2000s. In addition, MuchMusic also had a good relations with U.S.-based MTV which also aired a number of programs on that channel since its inception. This led to Craig Media launching its own MTV channel in 2001 leading to a rivalry between the two companies in the early 2000s until CHUM acquired Craig in 2004. MTV would return to Canada in 2006 although it was licensed as a talk channel and since CTV acquired Much in 2007, Much and MTV became sister channels despite the decreasing of music programming within the 2010s decade. After the closure of MTV Canada in 2024, Much would take over the channel&#x27;s remaining programming. 

As a former Category A service, Much was required to be carried on the basic service of all digital cable providers across Canada. The channel was, and still is, typically offered optionally at the discretion of providers.

==History==
===Under Moses Znaimer and CHUM (1984–2006)===
MuchMusic was licensed on April 2, 1984, by the Canadian Radio-television and Telecommunications Commission (CRTC) to CHUM Limited. It had faced competition from two other proposed services. One of them, &quot;CMTV Canadian Music Television&quot;, was deemed not to have sufficient financial resources. The third applicant was Rogers Radio Broadcasting. The CRTC believed that the Canadian market could only support one music video service and CHUM&#x27;s proposal was chosen because of various commitments it had made and the company&#x27;s expertise in music programming. The station was initially patterned on &quot;City Limits&quot;, an overnight weekend rock music show which had aired on sister station CITY-TV since 1983.
Shortly thereafter, MuchMusic was launched on August 31, 1984, as one of the first Canadian cable specialty channels. It was headed by the channel&#x27;s founders John Martin and Moses Znaimer. The first video played on MuchMusic was &quot;an early music-to-film synchronization short from the 1920s which featured Eubie Blake performing Snappy Songs.&quot; The first video made specifically for television air play was Rush&#x27;s &quot;The Enemy Within&quot;. MuchMusic&#x27;s slogan, and on-air advertising, was &quot;The Nation&#x27;s Music Station&quot;. 

The station was originally located at CITY-TV&#x27;s 99 Queen Street East studios, but by May 1987, Much, along with CITY, moved to the renovated 299 Queen Street West.

Making use of CHUM&#x27;s facilities and production teams, the channel produced many specialty musical and variety shows, including the long-running dance show &quot;Electric Circus&quot; and the late 1980s game show &quot;Test Pattern&quot;, and Citytv shows such as &quot;City Limits&quot;, &quot;The Power Hour&quot;, &quot;The MuchMusic Spotlight&quot; and &quot;The New Music&quot; also became integral parts of the MuchMusic schedule.

The channel&#x27;s format consisted primarily of an eight-hour daily block which mixed scheduled shows with VJ-hosted general &quot;videoflow&quot;, which would then be repeated two more times to fill the 24-hour schedule (originally a six-hour block repeated three times). Some variance from this model was seen with the late-night shows &quot;City Limits&quot; and &quot;Too Much 4 Much&quot; (a show that featured panel discussions surrounding controversial music videos that the channel had refused to air in regular rotation), and live specials such as &quot;Intimate and Interactive&quot;.

For the first few years of the channel, it was classified as a pay television service and was therefore offered largely in bundles along with other pay-stations such as First Choice and TSN, and would occasionally offer free preview weekends for non-subscribers. The subscriber count was at 500,000 customers by December 1984. In December 1987, MuchMusic received permission from the CRTC to move to basic cable lineups beginning on September 1, 1988; in the interim cable operators could offer the channel as a negative-option expanded basic channel.

A US version of MuchMusic, originally known as &quot;MuchMusic USA&quot;, was launched in the U.S. on July 1, 1994, through a partnership with Rainbow Media. The network was largely a simulcast of the Canadian version with U.S. advertising and acquired programs. The network would go into its own direction over time, eventually rebranding as Fuse in 2003.

In 1995, the annual Canadian Music Video Awards were renamed to the &quot;MuchMusic Video Awards&quot; (presently known as the &quot;iHeartRadio MMVAs&quot; as of 2018). Since 1996, the ceremonies have been held outside the formerly-named &quot;MuchMusic Headquarters&quot; on 299 Queen Street West, the present-day main offices for Bell Media&#x27;s speciality channels.

In 2002, MuchMusic introduced promos that consisted of one of twelve images of a VJ posing in front of the network&#x27;s logo, lasting for only 1/60th of a second each. The &quot;quickies&quot; were recognized with a Guinness World Record for the world&#x27;s shortest television commercial. Znaimer stepped down from the CHUM board in 2003, although he continued to produce some of Much&#x27;s programming until the formation of MZ Media in 2007.

===Under Bell (2006–present)===
In July 2006, Bell Globemedia (later called CTVglobemedia) announced that it would purchase CHUM for an estimated , including MuchMusic. The sale was subject to CRTC approval and was approved in June 2007, with the transaction completed on June 22, 2007, while the Citytv stations were sold to Rogers Media in the same year. Since then, MuchMusic has aired a vast number of non-music related shows, mainly teen dramas and reality shows.

In 2010, the CRTC rejected a request by CTVglobemedia to reduce the percentage of music video programming that the channel shows from 50 to 25 percent. CTV&#x27;s second request to the CRTC to reduce and reposition its Canadian programming was also denied. For the reasoning behind these requests, CTV explained that &quot;music videos no longer distinguish the service as they are readily available through other sources.&quot; This was met with mixed reaction by music fans and drew the ire of notable artists.
On June 1, 2011, MuchMusic launched its high definition simulcast feed.

Beginning in September 2013, the channel would air more comedy programming targeting young adult men during the late afternoon and primetime hours, much of it moved from The Comedy Network. Such shows included Comedy Central series (such as &quot;South Park&quot;, &quot;Tosh.0&quot; and &quot;The Jeselnik Offensive&quot;), reruns of &quot;The Simpsons&quot; and &quot;The Cleveland Show&quot;, as well as &quot;Late Night with Jimmy Fallon&quot; and &quot;Conan&quot;. These changes came when Comedy&#x27;s request for licence amendments to reduce requirements for Canadian content and increase the amount of animated programming it could air was denied. Around the same time, the channel officially shortened its name to &quot;Much&quot;; while the &quot;Much&quot; shorthand had historically been used as part of its branding, the channel had still used &quot;MuchMusic&quot; as its main branding.

Most of the channel&#x27;s previous non-music programming, such as &quot;Pretty Little Liars&quot; and &quot;&quot;, moved to sister channels M3 (formerly MuchMoreMusic and MuchMore) and MTV respectively. At the same time the channel cut back further on original music-related programming apart from &quot;Video on Trial&quot;, &quot;The Wedge&quot;, countdowns, and other non-hosted blocks of music videos, with &quot;New.Music.Live.&quot; confirmed to have been cancelled and the likes of &quot;RapCity&quot; no longer appearing on Much&#x27;s schedule. By the summer of 2014, amidst production and staffing cutbacks, the &quot;Countdown&quot; went on hiatus and Much&#x27;s remaining original shows, including a revamped &quot;Video on Trial&quot;, were cancelled.

Meanwhile, in August, Much celebrated its 30th anniversary. A half-hour anniversary special, &quot;30 Years of Much&quot;, aired on August 30, 2014, and was preceded by a full-day countdown of &quot;The 100 Greatest Videos Ever&quot;. Repeats of both the special and the countdown aired throughout the Labour Day weekend. On September 27, 2014, the &quot;Countdown&quot; returned with a revamped format.

On April 1, 2015, Much announced the launch of Much Digital Studios (later renamed Much Studios), a production unit and YouTube multi-channel network. The network features content catered towards Much&#x27;s demographic of 12-34s, and would also be integrated into their on-air programming. Such content includes the &quot;Mike On Much&quot; podcast, hosted by Mike Veerman, co-produced by Arkells lead singer Max Kerman, and featuring segments led by Shane Cunningham. The podcast eventually spawned the spin-off series &quot;Much Studios presents &quot;Mike on Much in Conversation With...&quot;&quot;, which premiered in 2018 on sibling service Crave.

On August 12, 2016, Bell Media sold MuchLoud, MuchRetro, MuchVibe and Juicebox to Stingray Digital. On September 1, 2016, M3 was shut down and replaced by Gusto, which later became CTV Life Channel in 2019, a cooking and lifestyle-oriented TV network that Bell Media acquired, after the original Gusto TV closed in March 2016.

In late 2017, Much further cut back on music programming, reducing its music blocks to the morning hours and removing the &quot;Much Countdown&quot; from its schedule. MuchFACT was also discontinued, as a result of the CRTC having dropped the requirement for Much to fund it. On October 11, 2017, Much premiered &quot;Sides*&quot;, a new talk show which discusses youth issues; it was streamed live on Twitter on weekdays, and a weekly highlight show aired on the Much channel. In November 2017, Much began to air a Friday-night block known as &quot;Icons&quot;, which featured airings of music documentaries.

In 2019, the daytime &quot;Playlist&quot; block of music videos was discontinued and replaced with library programming, citing decreased interest and viewership. In addition, that year&#x27;s MMVAs, which were moved to August the previous year, were delayed due to scheduling conflicts with the 2019 MTV Video Music Awards. The &quot;Much Retro Lunch&quot; block remained the only regularly-scheduled music video programming on the channel, with the network citing its popularity among youth as a factor. The block was discontinued on March 20, 2020, and was later replaced by reruns of &quot;Corner Gas&quot;. The last music video that the channel aired was &quot;Irreplaceable&quot; by Beyoncé.

====2021–present====
On June 10, 2021, it was announced that the &quot;MuchMusic&quot; name would be revived for a new &quot;digital-first&quot; network to launch on July 7 in-partnership with TikTok. The network would feature new &quot;creator-driven content&quot;, including revivals of old Much programming. Meanwhile, the linear TV channel would continue with its current format and programming under the &quot;Much&quot; brand.

The channel&#x27;s early history was chronicled in a 2023 documentary film by Sean Menard, titled &quot;299 Queen Street West&quot;. The film premiered at SXSW 2023, and was soon after acquired by Bell Media. The film was scheduled to premiere on January 26, 2024 on Crave, but was indefinitely pulled due to copyright issues involving the music video clips seen in the film.

In October 2024, Canada Post announced commemorative postage stamps honouring MuchMusic and MusiquePlus; the stamps feature a stylized rendition of crowds outside of the networks&#x27; headquarters.

==Programming==


Much&#x27;s main programming includes original series from Comedy Central (select shows not seen on CTV Comedy Channel) and other acquired comedies, reality shows, broadcasts of feature films, encores of shows seen on sibling networks, and reruns of other shows sourced from Bell Media&#x27;s program libraries to fulfil Canadian content requirements.

The network&#x27;s music programming previously consisted of music video blocks seen on weekdays and the annual MuchMusic Video Awards (MMVAs), of which most of its ceremonies had been held outside the network&#x27;s headquarters on 299 Queen Street West during Father&#x27;s Day weekend from 2002 to 2017. The network also produced and aired several original series, both in-house productions (such as the &quot;MuchMusic Countdown&quot;, &quot;Video on Trial&quot;, and &quot;The Wedge&quot;) and scripted series (such as &quot;The L.A. Complex&quot; and seasons 9–13 of &quot;Degrassi: The Next Generation&quot;, after its move from CTV in 2010).

=== Relationship with MTV ===
Since its inception, Much has aired numerous programs acquired from MTV. Beginning in 1994, MTV&#x27;s then-parent company Viacom (now as Paramount) would attempt to launch localized versions of the network through other partners; Craig Media, the parent company of the A-Channel stations in Western Canada, first launched MTV Canada and MTV2 Canada as digital cable networks in 2001. Due to CRTC genre protection rules, MTV Canada was forbidden from unduly competing with existing analog channels, such as MuchMusic, and its license henceforth restricted the channel to only devoting 10% of its weekly programming to &quot;music video clips&quot;.

CHUM filed a complaint with the CRTC over MTV Canada in early-2002, alleging that 60% of the schedule contained music video programming. CHUM also alleged that the licensing deal with MTV was a &quot;bait and switch&quot; to encroach upon MuchMusic&#x27;s protected format, rather than deliver the broadly teen-based channel it had promised in the licensing process. Craig disputed the allegations as inaccurate, arguing that CHUM had incorrectly classified any programming &quot;that has some connection to the general topic of music or music videos&quot; (CRTC category 8a, &quot;Music and dance other than music video programs or clips&quot;), as counting as CRTC category 8b &quot;music video clips&quot; programming for the purposes of the complaint, and that it only aired two hours of purely music video-based programming per-day (accounting for 8% of weekly programming). Upon analysis of MTV Canada&#x27;s programming, the CRTC ruled that music videos played within a category 8a program still counted as music video programming for the purposes of this limit, and found the network in violation of its licence for this and failure to deliver the broadly teen-based service it promised. CHUM would later acquire Craig Media and both MTV-branded channels were re-launched in June 2005; with MTV becoming a youth entertainment channel called Razer, and MTV2 becoming an interactive channel called PunchMuch.

In 2006, Viacom would partner with Bell Globemedia to relaunch TalkTV as a new Canadian incarnation of MTV. The agreement also gave the company rights to air MTV programming on other sibling outlets. The original MTV was relaunched as MTV2 in 2008 before closing in 2024. MTV also closed at the end of 2024, after which airings of its current original series (such as &quot;The Challenge&quot;, and &quot;Jersey Shore: Family Vacation&quot;) were added to Much&#x27;s schedule.

==Affiliated channels==
With the success of MuchMusic, several spinoff channels have been launched within Canada and around the world, including

===Former===
*MusiquePlus: Launched in 1986, it was developed as a Canadian French language version of MuchMusic. In September 2008, new owner Astral Media separated the channel from the network and introduced a new logo. In August 2019, new owner V Media Group relaunched the channel as Elle Fictions with a female-focused programming lineup.
*MusiMax: A sister channel to MusiquePlus focused on adult contemporary music, and was developed as the French language version of MuchMoreMusic. In August 2016, new owner V Media Group rebranded the channel as Max with an entertainment-focused programming lineup.
*PunchMuch: an all-request music video service consisting of music videos from various genres. On November 17, 2011, PunchMuch was replaced by Juicebox, a new music video channel aimed at pre-teens. Stingray Digital relaunched that channel as Stingray Juicebox in 2016.
*M3: Originally known as MuchMoreMusic, this channel focused on adult contemporary, classic rock, classic hits and even generally lighter music in addition to current pop-rock hits like its sister stations Much and MTV. In March 2009, it was relaunched as MuchMore. In 2013, it rebranded under the M3 name, marketed as an entertainment-focused &quot;superstation&quot; and a separate brand. In September 2016, the channel was relaunched Gusto on all service providers before renaming to CTV Life Channel in 2019.

In 2016, new owner Stingray Digital relaunched the channel as Stingray Retro.

===International===
====Current====
*MuchMusic Czech: Launched in 2006, available in the Czech Republic. Unlike its Canadian counterpart, it airs more music programming instead of comedy programming.

====Past====
*MuchMusic Latin America: Launched in September 1992, originally available only in Argentina, at the time of its closure distributed on several pay-TV operators in several Latin American countries. it was formerly owned by WarnerMedia Latin America from 2019 until 2022. It was owned by Warner Bros. Discovery Latin America as of April 8, 2022. Unlike its Canadian counterpart, and much like its Czech counterpart, it aired more music programming instead of comedy programming.

*MuchMusic Brasil: Launched in 2000. The channel was aided by its Latin American counterpart and had limited terrestrial coverage during its brief existence. Ceased broadcasting in 2001.
*MuchMusic also had a programming block on MTV3 in Finland called &quot;JYRKI&quot;.

==Much personalities==
===VJs (1984–2014)===
Several individuals have served as MuchMusic&#x27;s on-air hosts, or video jockeys (&quot;VJs&quot;). A number of notable Canadian and American television personalities either began their careers at MuchMusic or spent time there. Among these are J.D. Roberts who, under the name John Roberts, is a national correspondent for Fox News; Christopher Ward, a noted songwriter and producer who collaborated musically with Mike Myers on the &quot;Austin Powers&quot; movies; Sook-Yin Lee, now a noted CBC Radio host and actress; Terry David Mulligan, a prolific film and TV character actor; actress Amanda Walsh; Erica Ehm, who became a noted songwriter after leaving Much; and George Stroumboulopoulos, who became a television personality on CBC, U.S. network CNN and Sportsnet.

====VJ Search====

Every few years, when new video jockeys were needed, Much ran a &quot;VJ Search&quot; to pick one new VJ to join the channel. They would usually visit cities across Canada and pick people who appear to show potential through their audition. In earlier years, the VJ Search was usually a two-part show, but in 2006 it evolved into its own reality series called &quot;MuchMusic VJ Search&quot;. As a result of that series, Tim Deegan was chosen as a VJ. It was followed in 2009 by &quot;VJ 2.0&quot;, where the winner Liz Trinnear was also picked to join the channel. The final search, &quot;Much VJ Search&quot;, which Chloe Wilde won in 2013.

===Much Creators (2015–2021)===
With the launch of &quot;Much Digital Studios&quot; in April 2015, Much &quot;Creators&quot; were selected social media personalities, mostly established and emerging Canadian YouTubers. The first ever Fan Fave Much Creator award was won by YouTwoTV during the 2017 iHeartRadio MMVAs. Much Creators was discontinued on July 7, 2021.

<text>Thanjavur (), also known as Thanjai, previously known as Tanjore, is a city in the Indian state of Tamil Nadu. It is the 12th biggest city in Tamil Nadu. Thanjavur is an important center of southern Indian religion, art, and architecture. Most of the Great Living Chola Temples, which are UNESCO World Heritage Monuments, are located in and around Thanjavur. The foremost among these, the Peruvudaiyaar Temple, built by the Chola emperor Rajaraja I, is located in the centre of the city. This temple has one of the largest bull statues (called Nandi) in India carved out of a single granite rock. Thanjavur is also home to Tanjore painting, a painting style unique to the region. Thanjavur is the headquarters of the Thanjavur District. The city is an important agricultural centre located in the Kaveri Delta and is known as the &quot;Rice bowl of Tamil Nadu&quot;. Thanjavur is administered by a municipal corporation covering an area of and had a population of 222,943. Roadways are the major means of transportation, while the city also has rail connectivity. The nearest airport is Tiruchirapalli International Airport, located away from the city. The nearest seaport is Karaikal, which is away from Thanjavur.
The city first rose to prominence during the reign of the Cholas when it served as the capital of the empire. After the fall of the Cholas, the city was ruled by various dynasties such as the Mutharaiyar dynasty, the Pandyas, the Vijayanagar Empire, the Madurai Nayaks, the Thanjavur Nayaks, the Thanjavur Marathas and the British Empire. It has been a part of independent India since 1947.

== Etymology ==
The city&#x27;s name is believed to be derived from a portmanteau of &quot;thanjam puguntha oor&quot; () which means &quot;the town where refugees entered&quot;, referring to the town&#x27;s history of providing hospitality to newcomers.

According to another local legend, the name &quot;Thanjavur&quot; originated from &quot;Tanjan,&quot; an Asura (demon) who was slain on the site. In Hindu mythology, Tanjan requested the establishment of a beautiful city at the place where he was defeated. Later, the Asura was vanquished in what is now Thanjavur by the Hindu god Neelamegha Perumal, an incarnation of Vishnu.

The city&#x27;s name &quot;Thanjavur&quot; might also be derived from the name of a Mutharayar king, &quot;Thananjay&quot; or &quot;Dhananjaya&quot;. Thananjaya added to Oor gives the name Thanjavur. The Kalamalla stone inscription (the first stone inscription) was made by the king, Erikal Muthuraju Dhanunjaya Varma of 575 CE.

==History==
Though there are no references to Thanjavur in the Sangam period (third century BCE to fourth century CE) Tamil records, some scholars believe that the city has existed since that time. Kovil Venni, situated to the east of the city, was the site of the Battle of Venni between the Chola king Karikala and a confederacy of the Cheras and the Pandyas. The Cholas seemed to have faced an invasion of the Kalabhras in the third century CE after which the kingdom faded into obscurity. The region around present day Thanjavur was conquered by the Mutharayars during the sixth century, who ruled it up to 849.

The Cholas came to prominence once more through the rise of the medieval Chola monarch Vijayalaya (841–878 CE) in about 850 CE. Vijayalaya conquered Thanjavur from the Mutharayar king Elango Mutharayar and built a temple dedicated to the Hindu goddess Nisumbhasudani. His son Aditya I (871–901) consolidated their hold over the city. The Rashtrakuta king Krishna II (878–914), a contemporary of the Chola king Parantaka I (907–950), claims to have conquered Thanjavur, but there are no records to support the claim. Gradually, Thanjavur became the most important city in the Chola Empire and remained its capital till the emergence of Gangaikonda Cholapuram in about 1025. During the first decade of the eleventh century, the Chola king Raja Raja Chola I (985–1014) constructed the Brihadeeswarar Temple at Thanjavur. The temple is considered to be one of the best specimens of Tamil architecture.

When the Chola Empire began to decline in the 13th century, the Pandyas from the south invaded and captured Thanjavur twice, first between 1218–19 and again in 1230. During the second invasion, the Chola king Rajaraja III (1216–56) was exiled and he sought the help of the Hoysala king Vira Narasimha II (1220–35) to regain Thanjavur. Thanjavur was eventually annexed along with the rest of the Chola kingdom by the Pandya king Maravarman Kulasekara Pandyan I (1268–1308) in 1279 and the Chola kings were forced to accept the suzerainty of the Pandyas. The Pandyas ruled Thanjavur from 1279 to 1311 when their kingdom was raided by the forces of Malik Kafur (1296–1306) and later annexed by the Delhi Sultanate. The Sultanate extended its authority directly over the conquered regions from 1311 to 1335 and then through the semi-independent Ma&#x27;bar Sultanate from 1335 to 1378. Starting from the 1350s, the Ma&#x27;bar Sultanate was steadily absorbed into the rising Vijayanagar Empire.

Thanjavur is believed to have been conquered by Kampanna Udayar during his invasion of Srirangam between 1365 and 1371. Deva Raya&#x27;s inscription dated 1443, Thirumala&#x27;s inscription dated 1455 and Achuta Deva&#x27;s land grants dated 1532 and 1539 attest Vijayanagar&#x27;s dominance over Thanjavur. Sevappa Nayak (1532–80), the Vijayanagar viceroy of Arcot, established himself as an independent monarch in 1532 (1549, according to some sources) and founded the Thanjavur Nayak kingdom. Achuthappa Nayak (1560–1614), Raghunatha Nayak (1600–34) and Vijaya Raghava Nayak (1634–73) are some of the important rulers of the Nayak dynasty who ruled Thanjavur. Thanjavur Nayaks were notable for their patronage of literature and arts. The rule of the dynasty came to an end when Thanjavur fell to the Madurai Nayak king Chokkanatha Nayak (1662–82) in 1673. Vijaya Raghunatha Nayak, the son of Chokkanatha, was killed in a battle and Chokkanatha&#x27;s brother Alagiri Nayak (1673–75) was crowned as the ruler of the empire. Most of palayakkars in Thanjavur from Kallar caste. The Kallar held larger and richer estates than the Nayak. 

Thanjavur was successfully conquered in 1674 by Ekoji I (1675–84), the Maratha feudatory of the sultan of Bijapur and half-brother of Shivaji (1627/30-80) of the Bhonsle dynasty. Ekoji founded the Thanjavur Maratha kingdom which ruled Thanjavur till 1855. The Marathas exercised their sovereignty over Thanjavur throughout the last quarter of the 17th and the whole of the 18th century. The Maratha rulers patronized Carnatic music. In 1787, Amar Singh, the regent of Thanjavur, deposed the minor Raja, his nephew Serfoji II (1787–93) and captured the throne. Serfoji II was restored in 1799 with the assistance of the British, who induced him to relinquish the administration of the kingdom and left him in charge of Thanjavur fort and surrounding areas. The kingdom was eventually absorbed into British India in 1855 by the Doctrine of Lapse when Shivaji II (1832–55), the last Thanjavur Maratha ruler, died without a legitimate male heir. The British referred to the city as Tanjore in their records. Five years after its annexation, the British replaced Negapatam (modern-day Nagapattinam) with Thanjavur as the seat of the district administration. Under the British, Thanjavur emerged as an important regional centre. The 1871 India census recorded a population of 52,171, making Thanjavur the third largest city in the Madras Presidency. After India&#x27;s independence, Thanjavur continued as the district headquarters.

<text>In telecommunications, a point-to-point connection refers to a communications connection between two communication endpoints or nodes. An example is a telephone call, in which one telephone is connected with one other, and what is said by one caller can only be heard by the other. This is contrasted with a &quot;point-to-multipoint&quot; or &quot;broadcast&quot; connection, in which many nodes can receive information transmitted by one node. Other examples of point-to-point communications links are leased lines and microwave radio relay.

The term is also used in computer networking and computer architecture to refer to a wire or other connection that links only two computers or circuits, as opposed to other network topologies such as buses or crossbar switches which can connect many communications devices. 

&quot;Point-to-point&quot; is sometimes abbreviated as &quot;P2P&quot;. This usage of &quot;P2P&quot; is distinct from &quot;P2P&quot; meaning &quot;peer-to-peer&quot; in the context of file sharing networks or other data-sharing protocols between peers.

==Basic data link==
A traditional point-to-point data link is a communications medium with exactly two endpoints and no data or packet formatting. The host computers at either end take full responsibility for formatting the data transmitted between them. The connection between the computer and the communications medium was generally implemented through an RS-232 or similar interface. Computers in close proximity may be connected by wires directly between their interface cards.

When connected at a distance, each endpoint would be fitted with a modem to convert analog telecommunications signals into a digital data stream. When the connection uses a telecommunications provider, the connection is called a dedicated, leased, or private line. The ARPANET used leased lines to provide point-to-point data links between its packet-switching nodes, which were called Interface Message Processors.

==Modern links==

With the exception of passive optical networks, modern Ethernet is exclusively point-to-point on the physical layer – any cable only connects two devices. The term point-to-point telecommunications can also mean a wireless data link between two fixed points. The wireless communication is typically bi-directional and either &quot;time-division multiple access&quot; (TDMA) or channelized. This can be a microwave relay link consisting of a transmitter which transmits a narrow beam of microwaves with a parabolic dish antenna to a second parabolic dish at the receiver. It also includes technologies such as lasers which transmit data modulated on a light beam. These technologies require an unobstructed line of sight between the two points and thus are limited by the visual horizon to distances of about .

==Networking==
In a local network, repeater hubs or switches provide basic connectivity. A hub provides a point-to-multipoint (or simply multipoint) circuit in which all connected client nodes share the network bandwidth. A switch on the other hand provides a series of point-to-point circuits, via microsegmentation, which allows each client node to have a dedicated circuit and the added advantage of having full-duplex connections.

From the OSI model&#x27;s layer perspective, both switches and repeater hubs provide point-to-point connections on the physical layer. However, on the data link layer, a repeater hub provides point-to-multipoint connectivity – each frame is forwarded to all nodes – while a switch provides virtual point-to-point connections – each unicast frame is only forwarded to the destination node.

Within many switched telecommunications systems, it is possible to establish a permanent circuit. One example might be a telephone in the lobby of a public building, which is programmed to ring only the number of a telephone dispatcher. &quot;Nailing down&quot; a switched connection saves the cost of running a physical circuit between the two points. The resources in such a connection can be released when no longer needed, for example, a television circuit from a parade route back to the studio.
