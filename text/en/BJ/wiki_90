Pori was established in 1558 by Duke John, who later became King John III of Sweden. The municipality is unilingually Finnish.

The neighboring municipalities are Eurajoki, Kankaanpää, Kokemäki, Merikarvia, Nakkila, Pomarkku, Sastamala, Siikainen and Ulvila.

==Name==
The Finnish name &quot;Pori&quot; comes from the -borg part (meaning citadel, fortress or &quot;castle&quot;) of the original name in Swedish with a Fennicised pronunciation. The whole Swedish name &quot;Björneborg&quot; literally means &quot;Bear Fortress&quot; or &quot;Bear Castle&quot; (), and the Latin-Greek &quot;Arctopolis&quot; means &quot;Bear City&quot; ().

==History==

=== Early years ===
City of Pori was established on March 8, 1558 by Duke John of Finland () who was later known as John III of Sweden. It was a successor to the medieval towns of Teljä (Kokemäki) and Ulvila. Sailing the Kokemäki river had become more and more difficult since the 14th century due to the post-glacial rebound. The importance of Kokemäki and Ulvila began to decline as the ships could no longer navigate the river. In the 16th century the situation had become so bad that Duke John decided to establish a new harbour and market town closer to the sea.
The Bourgeoisie of Ulvila were ordered to migrate to the newly founded city and on 8 March 1558 John III gave the charter of Pori, which read: &quot;Because we have seen that it would be best to build a strong market town alongside the sea, and because we cannot find anywhere suitable for fortifying in Ulvila, we have chosen another location at Pori.&quot;

At the beginning Pori had around 300 involuntary residents. However, they soon recognized the advantages of their new location, which offered opportunities for profitable trading, among other things. Ship building has been important since the beginning of history of Pori. Shipyard started by the river in 1572 and it worked until the early 20th century. The biggest ship probably ever built in Pori was &quot;Porin Kraveli,&quot; completed in 1583.

=== Greater Wrath and Crimean War ===
During the Greater Wrath of 1713, Pori was occupied by Russian troops. Eight Russian regiments spent four months in town from September 1713 to January 1714 vandalizing and demolishing the city. Some of the wealthiest residents vanished, they were probably imprisoned and taken to Russia. Wind mills and storage houses were burnt. Most of the oxen and horses and more than 400 boats were lost. The Russian invasion of Finland continued another seven years. It meant great financial loss for Pori as the foreign trade was completely finished. After the Greater Wrath, Pori lost its staple rights and the city went into deep depression. A new &quot;golden age&quot; for Pori started in 1765 as the city got back the staple rights for foreign trade.

As the Crimean War broke out in 1853, Pori was attacked by both the French Navy and British Navy in 1855 during the Åland War. The French frigate D&#x27;Assos made the first attempt on July and managed to catch one ship outside the Isokari island before they sailed further north. Another attack was made by the British fleet on 9 August. Mayor Klaus Wahlberg negotiated a deal with the enemy and the city was saved. Two sailing ships and 17 smaller boats along with some other properties were given to the British. The activities of the people of Pori were considered shameful and according to some information, Lieutenant General Alexander von Wendt would have later demoted the officer who had retreated from Luotsinmäki to sergeant during a review held at the Pori market square.
=== City fires ===
As most of its houses were made of wood, Pori has had its share of fires. The town has burned down and been rebuilt nine times. The city was first destroyed by fire in 1571 and the last major fire was in 1852. More than 75 per cent of the city was destroyed in 1852 and most of the residents became homeless. Only a few buildings, such as the Town Hall, were saved. The Great Fire of 1852 was one of the worst disasters in Finland so far. The new city plan and the shape of the present old town was designed by Swedish architect C. T. von Chiewitz. The newly completed buildings, such as the Pori Theatre and Hotel Otava are historically and culturally important. Four esplanades, which are wider than the other streets, divided the new city center in four parts.

=== Finnish Civil War and World War II ===
During the 1918 Finnish Civil War, Pori was a part of the Finnish Socialist Workers&#x27; Republic. The city was not on the direct war zone but some terror was made by both sides. The best known incident was the execution of 11 Whites at the schoolyard of Pori Lyceum.

During World War II, Pori was bombed four times by the Soviet Airforce in 1939–1940. The worst bombing occurred on 2 February 1940 as 21 people were killed. Most of the bombs were aimed to the harbour area instead of the city itself. From 1942 to 1944 Pori Airport served as an air depot for the Jagdgeschwader 5 of German Luftwaffe. Pori air depot was known as &quot;Feldluftpark Pori&quot; and it was one of the major German air depots in Northern Europe. In September 1944, Germans left the airport and destroyed many of their facilities with explosives. One German-built hangar is still used today. Total of 319 Soviet Red Army prisoners of war died in Pori as they were used as a forced labor by the Germans. Soviet soldiers are buried at Vähärauma district in the western part of the city.

== Geography ==

=== River and delta ===
The geological uplift after the last ice age has been relatively high at the mouth of the Kokemäenjoki river. When the city was established in 1558, it was situated on the shore of Pori bay. Because of this uplift the delta of the river now begins in front of the city. The recreation area of Kirjurinluoto is actually on an island connected with bridges to the mainland. Pori National Urban Park preserves the story of the phases of development of the town born at the mouth of the river Kokemäenjoki.

=== Climate ===
Pori has a humid continental climate (Dfb), with moderation from the Gulf of Bothnia helping to keep September above the 10 °C (50 °F) isotherm, and is amongst the northern extent of that climate in Finland. Winters are long, and cold, but are notably shorter and warmer than in the Northern parts of Finland due to the marine effect and location by the Bothnian Sea. The temperatures measured in the city center are slightly higher on average due to the urban heat island effect. Summers are relatively warm. The highest ever recorded temperature in this weather station was 33.3 °C (91.9 °F), on 13 July 2010 and the lowest official temperature ever recorded was -36.8 °C (-34.2 °F), on 3 February 1966.

In fact, it gathers the most visitors out of any other beach in Finland on summers.

<doc id="372514" wikidata="Q1064218" url="?curid=372514" title="Schur decomposition">
<text>In the mathematical discipline of linear algebra, the Schur decomposition or Schur triangulation, named after Issai Schur, is a matrix decomposition. It allows one to write an arbitrary complex square matrix as unitarily similar to an upper triangular matrix whose diagonal elements are the eigenvalues of the original matrix.

== Statement ==
The complex Schur decomposition reads as follows: if is an square matrix with complex entries, then &quot;A&quot; can be expressed as
formula_1
for some unitary matrix &quot;Q&quot; (so that the inverse &quot;Q&quot;−1 is also the conjugate transpose &quot;Q&quot;* of &quot;Q&quot;), and some upper triangular matrix &quot;U&quot;. This is called a Schur form of &quot;A&quot;. Since &quot;U&quot; is similar to &quot;A&quot;, it has the same spectrum, and since it is triangular, its eigenvalues are the diagonal entries of &quot;U&quot;.

The Schur decomposition implies that there exists a nested sequence of &quot;A&quot;-invariant subspaces , and that there exists an ordered orthonormal basis (for the standard Hermitian form of ) such that the first &quot;i&quot; basis vectors span for each &quot;i&quot; occurring in the nested sequence. Phrased somewhat differently, the first part says that a linear operator &quot;J&quot; on a complex finite-dimensional vector space stabilizes a complete flag .

There is also a real Schur decomposition. If is an square matrix with real entries, then &quot;A&quot; can be expressed as formula_2 where is an orthogonal matrix and is either upper or lower quasi-triangular. A quasi-triangular matrix is a matrix that when expressed as a block matrix of and blocks is triangular. This is a stronger property than being Hessenberg . Just as in the complex case, a family of commuting real matrices 
{&quot;Ai&quot;} may be simultaneously brought to quasi-triangular form by an orthogonal matrix. There exists an orthogonal matrix &quot;Q&quot; such that, for every &quot;Ai&quot; in the given family, 
formula_3
is upper quasi-triangular.

== Proof ==
A constructive proof for the Schur decomposition is as follows: every operator &quot;A&quot; on a complex finite-dimensional vector space has an eigenvalue &quot;λ&quot;, corresponding to some eigenspace &quot;Vλ&quot;. Let &quot;Vλ&quot;⊥ be its orthogonal complement. It is clear that, with respect to this orthogonal decomposition, &quot;A&quot; has matrix representation (one can pick here any orthonormal bases &quot;Z&quot;1 and &quot;Z&quot;2 spanning &quot;Vλ&quot; and &quot;Vλ&quot;⊥ respectively)
formula_4
where &quot;Iλ&quot; is the identity operator on &quot;Vλ&quot;. The above matrix would be upper-triangular except for the &quot;A&quot;22 block. But exactly the same procedure can be applied to the sub-matrix &quot;A&quot;22, viewed as an operator on &quot;Vλ&quot;⊥, and its submatrices. Continue this way until the resulting matrix is upper triangular. Since each conjugation increases the dimension of the upper-triangular block by at least one, this process takes at most &quot;n&quot; steps. Thus the space C&quot;n&quot; will be exhausted and the procedure has yielded the desired result.

The above argument can be slightly restated as follows: let &quot;λ&quot; be an eigenvalue of &quot;A&quot;, corresponding to some eigenspace &quot;Vλ&quot;. &quot;A&quot; induces an operator &quot;T&quot; on the quotient space C&quot;n&quot;/&quot;Vλ&quot;. This operator is precisely the &quot;A&quot;22 submatrix from above. As before, &quot;T&quot; would have an eigenspace, say &quot;Wμ&quot; ⊂ C&quot;n&quot; modulo &quot;Vλ&quot;. Notice the preimage of &quot;Wμ&quot; under the quotient map is an invariant subspace of &quot;A&quot; that contains &quot;Vλ&quot;. Continue this way until the resulting quotient space has dimension 0. Then the successive preimages of the eigenspaces found at each step form a flag that &quot;A&quot; stabilizes.

== Notes ==
Although every square matrix has a Schur decomposition, in general this decomposition is not unique. For example, the eigenspace &quot;Vλ&quot; can have dimension &gt; 1, in which case any orthonormal basis for &quot;Vλ&quot; would lead to the desired result.

Write the triangular matrix &quot;U&quot; as &quot;U&quot; = &quot;D&quot; + &quot;N&quot;, where &quot;D&quot; is diagonal and &quot;N&quot; is strictly upper triangular (and thus a nilpotent matrix). The diagonal matrix &quot;D&quot; contains the eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot; in arbitrary order (hence its Frobenius norm, squared, is the sum of the squared moduli of the eigenvalues of &quot;A&quot;, while 
the Frobenius norm of &quot;A&quot;, squared, is the sum of the squared singular values of &quot;A&quot;). The nilpotent part &quot;N&quot; is generally not unique either, but its Frobenius norm is uniquely determined by &quot;A&quot; (just because the Frobenius norm of A is equal to the Frobenius norm of &quot;U&quot; = &quot;D&quot; + &quot;N&quot;).

It is clear that if &quot;A&quot; is a normal matrix, then &quot;U&quot; from its Schur decomposition must be a diagonal matrix and the column vectors of &quot;Q&quot; are the eigenvectors of &quot;A&quot;. Therefore, the Schur decomposition extends the spectral decomposition. In particular, if &quot;A&quot; is positive definite, the Schur decomposition of &quot;A&quot;, its spectral decomposition, and its singular value decomposition coincide.

A commuting family {&quot;Ai&quot;} of matrices can be simultaneously triangularized, i.e. there exists a unitary matrix &quot;Q&quot; such that, for every &quot;Ai&quot; in the given family, &quot;Q Ai Q*&quot; is upper triangular. This can be readily deduced from the above proof. Take element &quot;A&quot; from {&quot;Ai&quot;} and again consider an eigenspace &quot;VA&quot;. Then &quot;VA&quot; is invariant under all matrices in {&quot;Ai&quot;}. Therefore, all matrices in {&quot;Ai&quot;} must share one common eigenvector in &quot;VA&quot;. Induction then proves the claim. As a corollary, we have that every commuting family of normal matrices can be simultaneously diagonalized.

In the infinite dimensional setting, not every bounded operator on a Banach space has an invariant subspace. However, the upper-triangularization of an arbitrary square matrix does generalize to compact operators. Every compact operator on a complex Banach space has a nest of closed invariant subspaces.

== Computation ==
The Schur decomposition of a given matrix is numerically computed by the QR algorithm or its variants. In other words, the roots of the characteristic polynomial corresponding to the matrix are not necessarily computed ahead in order to obtain its Schur decomposition. Conversely, the QR algorithm can be used to compute the roots of any given characteristic polynomial by finding the Schur decomposition of its companion matrix. Similarly, the QR algorithm is used to compute the eigenvalues of any given matrix, which are the diagonal entries of the upper triangular matrix of the Schur decomposition. Although the QR algorithm is formally an infinite sequence of operations, convergence to machine precision is practically achieved in formula_5 operations.
See the Nonsymmetric Eigenproblems section in LAPACK Users&#x27; Guide.

== Applications ==
Lie theory applications include:
* Every invertible operator is contained in a Borel group.
* Every operator fixes a point of the flag manifold.

== Generalized Schur decomposition ==
Given square matrices &quot;A&quot; and &quot;B&quot;, the generalized Schur decomposition factorizes both matrices as formula_6 and formula_7, where &quot;Q&quot; and &quot;Z&quot; are unitary, and &quot;S&quot; and &quot;T&quot; are upper triangular. The generalized Schur decomposition is also sometimes called the QZ decomposition.
The generalized eigenvalues formula_8 that solve the generalized eigenvalue problem formula_9 (where x is an unknown nonzero vector) can be calculated as the ratio of the diagonal elements of &quot;S&quot; to those of &quot;T&quot;. That is, using subscripts to denote matrix elements, the &quot;i&quot;th generalized eigenvalue formula_10 satisfies formula_11.

<text>The Doushantuo Formation (formerly transcribed as Toushantuo or Toushantou, from ) is a geological formation in western Hubei, eastern Guizhou, southern Shaanxi, central Jiangxi, and other localities in China. It is known for the fossil Lagerstätten in Zigui in Hubei, Xiuning in Anhui, and Weng&#x27;an in Guizhou, as one of the oldest beds to contain minutely preserved microfossils, phosphatic fossils that are so characteristic they have given their name to &quot;Doushantuo type preservation&quot;. The formation, whose deposits date back to the Early and Middle Ediacaran, is of particular interest because it covers the poorly understood interval of time between the end of the Cryogenian geological period and the more familiar fauna of the Late Ediacaran Avalon explosion, as well as due to its microfossils&#x27; potential utility as biostratigraphical markers. Taken as a whole, the Doushantuo Formation ranges from about 635 Ma (million years ago) at its base to about 551 Ma at its top, with the most fossiliferous layer predating by perhaps five Ma the earliest of the &#x27;classical&#x27; Ediacaran faunas from Mistaken Point on the Avalon Peninsula of Newfoundland, and recording conditions up to a good forty to fifty million years before the Cambrian explosion at the beginning of the Phanerozoic.

==Sedimentology==

The whole sequence sits on an unconformity with the underlying Liantuo formation, which is free of fossils, an unconformity usually being interpreted as a period of erosion. On that unconformity lie tillites of the Nantuo formation - cemented glacial till formed of glacial deposits of cobbles and gravel laid down at the end of the Marinoan glaciation (also known as Varangian glaciation, this is the second and last of a series of very extensive glaciations during a period called the Cryogenian -- named because &#x27;Snowball Earth&#x27; conditions at the time). This latest Cryogenian glacial level is tentatively dated &quot;ca&quot; 654 (660 ± 5) — 635 Ma (million years ago).

The Doushantuo formation itself has three layers representing aquatic sediments that formed as sea levels rose with the melting of worldwide glaciation. Biomarkers indicate highly saline conditions, such as might be found in a lagoon, low oxygen levels, and very little sediment that had been washed off land surfaces.

The richest finds (the &quot;Lagerstätte&quot; itself) lie at the bottom of the middle stratum, with a date about 570 Ma, thus from some time after the great Gaskiers glaciation of [585 ± 1 - 582.1 ± 0.4 Ma].

==Fossils==

Doushantuo fossils are all aquatic, microscopic, and preserved to a great degree of detail. The latter two characteristics mean that the structure of the organisms that made them can be studied at the cellular level, and considerable insight has been gained into the embryonic and larval stages of many early creatures. One contentious claim is that many of the fossils show signs of bilateral symmetry, a common feature in many modern-day animals which is usually assumed to have evolved later, during the Cambrian Explosion. A nearly microscopic fossil animal, &quot;Vernanimalcula&quot; (&quot;springtime micro-animal&quot;) was announced in October 2005, with the claim that it was the oldest known bilateral animal. However, the absence of adult forms of almost all animal types in the Doushantuo (there are microscopic adult sponges and corals) makes these claims difficult to prove: some argue that their lack suggests these finds are not larval and embryonic forms at all; supporters contend that some unidentified process &quot;filtered out&quot; all but the smallest forms from fossilization. An alternative interpretation suggests that it was created by non-biological rock-forming processes. The team that discovered &quot;Vernanimalcula&quot; have defended their conclusion that it was an animal, pointing out that they found ten specimens (not illustrated) of the same size and configuration, and stating that non-biological processes would be very unlikely to produce so many specimens that were so alike.

The discovery was made when the rich phosphate deposits were being mined, and was first reported in 1998. The finds offer direct evidence that confirms expectations that major evolutionary diversification of animals already had occurred before the onset of the Cambrian period, with its apparent &#x27;explosion&#x27; of metazoan life-forms and, therefore, that more remote ancestral forms of the phyla recognizable in Cambrian macrofossils must have existed previously.

The documented biota now includes phosphatized microfossils of algae, multicellular thallophytes (seaweeds), acritarchs, ciliates, and cyanophytes, besides adult sponges and adult cnidarians (coelenterates; these may be early forms of tabulate corals (tetracorallians)). There also seem to be what scientists cautiously report as bilateral animal embryos, termed &quot;Parapandorina&quot;, and eggs (&quot;Megasphaera&quot;). Some of the possible animal embryos are in an early stage of cellular division (that was first interpreted as spores or algal cells), including eggs and embryos which are most probably of sponges or cnidarians, as well as adult sponges and a variety of adult cnidarians.

An alternative possibility is that the &quot;embryos&quot; and &quot;eggs&quot; are in fact fossils of giant sulfur bacteria resembling &quot;Thiomargarita&quot;, a bacterium so large that it is visible to the naked eye. The interpretation would also provide a mechanism for phosphatic fossilization through microbially mediated phosphate precipitation by the bacteria, which has been observed in modern environments. If dark spots in the fossil transpire to be fossilised nuclei - an unlikely claim - this would refute the &quot;Thiomargarita&quot; hypothesis. That being said, recent comparisons of the Doushantuo fossils to modern decaying &quot;Thiomargarita&quot; and expired sea urchin embryos shows little similarity between the fossils and decaying bacterial cells.

Only about one-twentieth of the site&#x27;s fossils have been excavated. The fossil beds are threatened by increasing intensity of phosphate mining operations in the area. A workshop led in protest by local paleontologists resulted in a temporary halt to the mining in 2017.

== Palaeogeography ==
The formation was laid down on a carbonate shelf, whose rim enclosed a lagoon between tidal flats on the shore, and the deeper ocean. This lagoon was periodically anoxic or euxinic (containing hydrogen sulfide); variations in the chemistry in the lagoon can be detected in isotopic and elemental abundance cycles in the rock and possibly contributed to the fossil preservation.

==Geochemistry==
The most recent Doushantuo rocks show a sharp decrease in the 13C/12C carbon isotope ratio. Since this change appears to be worldwide but its timing does not match that of any other known major event such as a mass extinction, it may represent &quot;possible feedback relationships between evolutionary innovation and seawater chemistry&quot; in which metazoans (multi-celled organisms) removed carbon from the water, which increased the concentration of oxygen, and the increased oxygen level made possible the evolution of new metazoans.

<doc id="372522" wikidata="Q1621656" url="?curid=372522" title="Solid Snake">
<text>is a fictional character from the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; series created by Hideo Kojima and developed and published by Konami, appearing as the main protagonist in many of the games of the series. He is depicted as a former Green Beret and highly skilled special operations soldier engaged in solo stealth and espionage missions who is often tasked with destroying models of the bipedal nuclear weapon-armed mecha known as Metal Gear. Controlled by the player, he must act alone, supported via radio by commanding officers and specialists. While his first appearances in the original &quot;Metal Gear&quot; games were references to Hollywood films, the &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; series has given a consistent design by artist Yoji Shinkawa alongside an established personality while also exploring his relationship with his mentor and father.

During the &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; games, the character has been voiced by voice actor Akio Ōtsuka in the Japanese version and by Canadian-American screenwriter and actor David Hayter in the English version. He also appears in Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot; series as a playable fighter, as well as the battle royale game &quot;Fortnite&quot;. Considered to be one of the most iconic protagonists in video game history, Solid Snake has been acclaimed by critics, with his personality and both Ōtsuka&#x27;s and Hayter&#x27;s voice acting being noted as primary factors of the character&#x27;s appeal.

==Characteristics==
In the early games, Solid Snake&#x27;s visual appearances were references to popular actors. He was given his own consistent design in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;. He also establishes Philanthropy, an anti-Metal Gear organization carrying the motto &quot;To let the world be&quot;, with his friend Otacon. In &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot;, he has access to OctoCamo, which allows him to change his appearance to match the surface he is leaning on. And FaceCamo, which can change his facial appearance to make him look like other characters, as well as his younger self.

Snake possesses an IQ of 180 and is fluent in six languages. Solid Snake has been on the battlefield for most of his life, and says that it is the only place he feels truly alive. He is a hardened veteran, burying his emotions within himself during missions, every one of which has different motives. He is also immediately shown as a loner, often with no intentions of taking orders from anyone anymore and he shows no sign of longing for the army or the country of which he was a part. However, along with these traits he has a more human side, being flirtatious, self-sacrificing and with a strong belief that even on a battlefield friendship and love can flourish, and that violence is not glorious. Snake&#x27;s perceived stance on violence may be a case of denial, as Snake&#x27;s enemies and at least one of his allies have claimed that he enjoys killing, and label him as more evil than the people he has killed. When he is not on duty, his favorite recreational activity is being a musher.

==Appearances==
===Video games===
====&quot;Metal Gear&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot;====

&quot;Metal Gear&quot; introduces Snake, a rookie recruit of the elite special forces unit FOXHOUND. Snake is sent by Big Boss into Outer Heaven, a rogue nation in South Africa, to rescue Gray Fox and discover who or what the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; is. As his mission progresses, Snake finds out that he has been set up; Big Boss&#x27;s phantom intended to use TX-55 Metal Gear (the experimental, nuclear-armed weapon) to establish Outer Heaven as a nuclear power. After destroying the Metal Gear, Snake confronts and defeats Big Boss&#x27;s phantom.

The sequel &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot; sees Solid Snake called up to infiltrate Zanzibar Land, a heavily fortified enemy base in Central Asia that has aggravated an international oil crisis and declared themselves a nuclear power by kidnapping Dr. Kio Marv (after the creation of a bio-engineered algae that produces an oil substitute) and the Metal Gear engineer Pettrovich Madnar. Snake infiltrates the base and discovers that Pettrovich as well as Fox has defected to Zanzibar Land, and that Zanzibar Land is led by the true Big Boss. Snake destroys Metal Gear D, and defeats both Fox and the true Big Boss.

====&quot;Metal Gear Solid / The Twin Snakes&quot;====

&quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; and its remake – &quot;The Twin Snakes&quot; – reveals Solid Snake&#x27;s real name as . He is pulled out of retirement by Roy Campbell to deal with the &quot;Sons of Big Boss&quot; led by Liquid Snake who seized an isolated American nuclear weapons disposal facility on Shadow Moses Island. Snake&#x27;s mission is to rescue Donald Anderson and Kenneth Baker but he is unable to prevent both hostages&#x27; deaths. As the game progresses, Snake infiltrates and learns about Metal Gear REX while meeting up with rookie soldier Meryl Silverburgh and REX&#x27;s engineer Hal Emmerich, confronts and defeats each member of the corrupt faction of FOXHOUND (consisting of Revolver Ocelot, Decoy Octopus, Psycho Mantis, Sniper Wolf, Vulcan Raven, and the Genome Soldiers), several confrontations with the Cyborg Ninja, is able to destroy REX, and personally confronts Liquid. During their fight, it is revealed that Solid and Liquid are twin brothers artificially conceived from Big Boss&#x27;s genes during the &quot;Les Enfants Terribles&quot; government project designed to create the perfect soldier, in which one brother was genetically modified to be superior over the other. Liquid harbors a strong resentment towards Snake since Solid was apparently given their father&#x27;s dominant &quot;soldier genes&quot; and Liquid was seemingly cast aside. A grueling series of battles and Liquid dies from the FOXDIE virus that was previously implanted into Snake by Naomi Hunter in order to wipe out FOXHOUND without risking any damage to REX for retrieval. In the end, it is revealed that Liquid got Big Boss&#x27;s superior &quot;soldier genes&quot; while Solid was actually the inferior one.

====&quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot;====

&quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Sons of Liberty&quot; shows Solid Snake as a central character. During the game&#x27;s extensive prologue sequence, he is sent by Otacon&#x27;s anti-proliferation organization Philanthropy to infiltrate a cargo tanker and photograph Metal Gear RAY. During the operation, however, RAY is hijacked and the tanker destroyed, with Snake apparently dead and framed for the deed. During the game&#x27;s main portion, Solidus Snake steals Snake&#x27;s identity, and leads the &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; (consisting of Revolver Ocelot, Fortune, Fatman, Vamp and Olga Gurlukovich) while Snake himself uses the pseudonym as a non-playable character who assists rookie agent Raiden through the remote offshore Big Shell facility and in taking down Solidus and RAY while also learning about the Patriots.

====&quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot;====

&quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot; features an aged incarnation of the character who nicknamed himself as the protagonist once again. Thanks to Otacon and Sunny, he wears a sneaking suit outfitted with &quot;Octocamo&quot; technology which allows him to blend with his environment as well as a face mask which alters his appearance.

For his final mission, he is once again enlisted by Campbell to assassinate Liquid Ocelot, CEO of a giant mother company that are trying to take control of the Patriots&#x27; AIs. He also learns from Naomi that his life has been artificially shortened as part of the cloning process so that his genes can&#x27;t be used as a weapon in later research, thus explaining why he has the physical appearance of an elderly man despite being only forty-two years old. Snake and his allies are forced to destroy the Patriots&#x27; AI and fight through Ocelot&#x27;s forces until Snake defeats Liquid&#x27;s doppelgänger in hand-to-hand combat. Snake tried to commit suicide as his DNA contains a mutated FOXDIE virus that might trigger an epidemic, but Big Boss revealed a new variant overwrote the mutant version to which the two make up as father and son. David is told he still has a chance to live &quot;not as a snake but as a man&quot; so he decides to live out the remainder of his life in peace, vowing that he will live long enough to see what the future holds for the new world he has helped create.

===Other appearances===
The &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; prequels alludes to Solid Snake&#x27;s existence; &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops&quot; has him briefly alluded in a prophetic vision as Naked Snake&#x27;s &quot;son [who] will save the world&quot; (after Liquid and/or Solidus as Big Boss&#x27;s &quot;son [who] will bring the world to ruin&quot;), and &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot; shows Kazuhira Miller mentioning the &quot;twin sons&quot; that are two years old at the time.

Solid Snake is featured/mentioned in &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: Ground Zeroes&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid V: The Phantom Pain&quot;. The unlockable bonus mission &quot;Déjà Vu&quot; on the PlayStation platform and later Xbox platform of &quot;Ground Zeroes&quot; in which Naked Snake must re-enact situations from the original &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; game and answer a series of trivia questions after fulfilling the mission. If all the questions are answered correctly on the Normal difficulty setting, the mission can be replayed with his low-polygon model from &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; in place of his father&#x27;s standard character model. &quot;The Phantom Pain&quot; also shows that his low-polygon model from &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; can be an alternate outfit for Venom Snake after transferring the save data from &quot;Ground Zeroes&quot;. David is also alluded to in association with Eli during a conversation between Big Boss and Revolver Ocelot.

===Other &quot;Metal Gear&quot; media===
Solid Snake also serves as the protagonist in &quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, a sequel to the original &quot;Metal Gear&quot; for the NES released for the western market in 1990 and developed without Kojima&#x27;s involvement. Set three years after the events of the Outer Heaven incident, &quot;Snake&#x27;s Revenge&quot; has Snake leading a team of FOX HOUND operatives as they infiltrate an undisclosed enemy base where the Metal Gear weapon is being mass-produced. Snake is addressed by the military rank of Lieutenant and starts the game already equipped with a handgun and a combat knife, in contrast to the first game, where Snake had to procure all of his weapons on-site.

After the success of the original &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, KCEJ produced a trilogy of &quot;Metal Gear&quot; spin-offs for portable platforms set in a parallel universe outside the main Kojima-directed series. All three of these portable games were directed by Shinta Nojiri. The first of these is &quot;Metal Gear: Ghost Babel&quot; (released outside Japan as &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;), in which Solid Snake must infiltrate a rebuilt Outer Heaven (now called Galuade) to defeat a FOXHOUND-like team of rogue agents called Black Chamber and destroy a stolen Metal Gear prototype, Gander. Although the actual in-game artwork of &quot;Ghost Babel&quot; was done by Ikuya Nakamura, Yoji Shinkawa provided the promotional art like he did with the original &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;. In the second of these titles, &quot;Metal Gear Acid&quot;, Snake must retrieve &quot;Pythagoras&quot; from the Lobito Physics and Research Laboratory, in order to satisfy hijackers who have kidnapped presidential candidate Viggo Hach. This mission is complicated by La Clown, an expert mimic who impersonates Snake&#x27;s contact Teliko, and subtle brainwashing that nearly convinces him that he is Hans Davis, a ruthless scientist that worked at the Lobito facility. He overcomes both and contacts the real Teliko, then destroys the latest model of Metal Gear, Metal Gear KODOQUE. &quot;Metal Gear Acid 2&quot; features a main character who is not the real version, but a clone created from tissue samples of the man from the original &quot;Metal Gear Acid&quot;, following the events of the Lobito Island mission; the Solid Snake from the original &quot;Acid&quot; is implied to be dead in the sequel.

The character appears in his Old Snake form as a playable character in &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Portable Ops Plus&quot;, a stand-alone expansion to the &quot;Portable Ops&quot; focusing on online play. In &quot;Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance&quot;, the VR Missions DLC add-on for the game&#x27;s Japanese version includes a new weapon that can be used by Raiden known as the &quot;Hebidamashi&quot;, a talking wooden sword which speaks with Solid Snake&#x27;s voice (as portrayed by Akio Ōtsuka); the weapon was never made available for the English version.

Outside video games, Solid Snake appeared in the &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; audio drama that focuses on his missions following the battle from Shadow Moses. He also appears in Alex Garner&#x27;s comic book adaptations of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; and &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;. Raymond Benson&#x27;s novelizations of these two games also feature Solid Snake; Benson&#x27;s adaptation of the character frequently focuses on the comical aspects of his characterization. He also appears in Project Itoh&#x27;s novelization from &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot; where his actions are told from Hal Emmerich&#x27;s point of view.

===Other video games and media===
In the Worlds of Power novelization series created by F.X. Nine, Solid Snake appears in the second in the series, based on &quot;Metal Gear&quot;. In the book, written by Alexander Frost, he is Marine Captain Justin Halley. This version of the character is non-canon and is not referenced by other versions.

Solid Snake has appeared in a number of other games, including other Konami games. Hideo Kojima makes a habit of referencing his previous work. In the Kojima-produced &quot;Boktai 2: Solar Boy Django&quot; (and &quot;Shin Bokura no Taiyō: Gyakushū no Sabata&quot;), Snake appears as an unnamed character who sells items to the player. Konami&#x27;s &quot;Evolution Skateboarding&quot; features Snake and Raiden as hidden characters, as well as two stages set in the Big Shell (the skateboarding minigame in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2: Substance&quot; is a demo of &quot;Evolution Skateboarding&quot; composed exclusively of these elements). Solid Snake also appears in both halves of a crossover between the &quot;Metal Gear&quot; and &quot;Ape Escape&quot; franchises: the &quot;Ape Escape&quot; monkeys appear with Solid Snake in the &quot;Snake vs. Monkey&quot; minigame featured in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot;. In turn, Snake appears in the corresponding &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; minigame featured in &quot;Ape Escape 3&quot;, where he is rescued by Pipo Snake (Snake&#x27;s character design in this minigame is taken directly from Naked Snake&#x27;s).

He has also appeared in several cross-company fighting games. In &quot;DreamMix TV World Fighters&quot;, Solid Snake appears as a playable character alongside other Konami, Hudson Soft and Takara characters such as Bomberman and Optimus Prime. Similarly, in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Brawl&quot;, the third installment from the popular fighting game series &quot;Super Smash Bros.&quot;, Solid Snake appeared as a playable fighter alongside Sega character Sonic the Hedgehog and a variety of characters from Nintendo franchises such as &quot;Mario&quot;, &quot;The Legend of Zelda&quot;, and &quot;Donkey Kong&quot;. &quot;Brawl&quot; Director Masahiro Sakurai has stated that Snake was included under Kojima&#x27;s request, and that he had talked to Sakurai about adding Snake to the roster of the previous game &quot;Super Smash Bros. Melee&quot;, which did not materialize due to the game being too far into production. Snake returned as a playable fighter in &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot;, after being absent in &quot;Super Smash Bros. for Nintendo 3DS and Wii U&quot;. In addition, Snake has appeared as a playable character in other Konami crossover titles, such as &quot;New International Track &amp; Field&quot; and &quot;Super Bomberman R&quot;.

Old Snake has appeared in the Japanese version of &quot;Scribblenauts&quot;, having been published by Konami in that region. Customizations in Media Molecule&#x27;s &quot;LittleBigPlanet&quot; for the PlayStation 3 allow the player character, Sackboy, to take on the appearance of Old Snake. In December 2020, Paul W. Anderson stated that his 2020 film &quot;Monster Hunter&quot; had been based on a 2010 &quot;Metal Gear Solid: Peace Walker&quot; crossover event with &quot;Monster Hunter Freedom Unite&quot;, in which a military squad briefly faced monsters from the &quot;Monster Hunter&quot; series, with Snake&#x27;s equivalent in the narrative, US Army Ranger Artemis, being portrayed by Milla Jovovich.

Solid Snake appears as an outfit in &quot;Fortnite&quot;, starting from the first season of the battle royale mode&#x27;s fifth chapter in December 2023 and is unlockable from January 23, 2024 until the season&#x27;s end date.

==Creation and development==
Solid Snake was apparently named after the fictional special forces operative Snake Plissken, Kurt Russell&#x27;s character in &quot;Escape from New York&quot;. However, Kojima revealed in March 2014 that the character&#x27;s name origins were something else. According to Kojima, he was given the &quot;Snake&quot; name because snakes are a symbol of stealth. Additionally, the &quot;Solid&quot; part of his code-name was given to give the opposite impression of a soft image. Kojima has compared Snake&#x27;s personality with Lupin III of Monkey Punch&#x27;s &quot;Lupin III&quot; franchise, stating that in &quot;&quot;MGS&quot;, Snake became this sharp-tongued, Lupin III-like guy who flirted with women and told lots of jokes&quot;. His real name David is a tribute to the film &quot;2001: A Space Odyssey&quot; that has a character with the same name (and coincidentally shared with his English voice actor David Hayter). Kojima later described Snake&#x27;s role in the original &quot;Metal Gear&quot; as the &quot;player&#x27;s presence&quot;, contrasting the defined personality acquired in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;.

In addition to expanding Solid Snake&#x27;s backstory, as the first &quot;Metal Gear&quot; game to feature voice acting, &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; established his characteristic voice and appearance.

Various scenes from the games relate Solid Snake&#x27;s ideals with Hideo Kojima&#x27;s. During &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;, Snake encourages Raiden to trust himself in making his own choices with the former representing the veteran developer and the latter the younger staff who are to decide whether a sequel to the series would be made without Kojima. In &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot;, Snake tries to protect the next generation by stopping Ocelot which represented Kojima working with the staff to avoid bugs from occurring within the game. Kojima introduced the cloning origins of Snake to &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; in order to provide Snake with an adversary who would be his equal, since the story, being a continuation of the original MSX2 games, established Snake as an experienced soldier. Kojima explained that his decision to introduce a new playable character in Snake&#x27;s place for &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; was done in order to develop Snake from another character&#x27;s perspective, but also to avoid treating Snake as a rookie by having a new character be instructed via Codec instead. Snake was written to act as father figure not only to protect those he cares but also leave a message for the future generation despite his imminent death. As a pacifist message, Snake&#x27;s stress increases when killing enemies. Snake and Otacon were meant to die in the game, with Kojima being inspired by the movie &quot;Sacco &amp; Vanzetti&quot; in regards to how the duo use death as a penalty for how they are criminals rather than heroes. While the novel retained this idea, the ending in the game was changed with Snake and Otacon surviving. Following Kojima&#x27;s departure from Konami, the company indicated that it does not intend to produce further &quot;Metal Gear&quot; games with Solid Snake as the protagonist; Kojima has himself stated that Solid Snake &quot;is one character that I don&#x27;t want to entrust to other people&quot;.

===Design===
Much as &quot;Metal Gear&quot; began as a pastiche of action movies of the time, Solid Snake began as a pastiche of action movie heroes. On the cover artwork of the original &quot;Metal Gear&quot; he resembles actor Michael Biehn as Kyle Reese in the 1984 film &quot;The Terminator&quot;, although Kojima claimed to have no involvement in the production of the game&#x27;s packaging illustration. In the in-game portrait of &quot;Metal Gear 2: Solid Snake&quot;, he resembles Mel Gibson.

Yoji Shinkawa&#x27;s Solid Snake design, characterized by his navy blue bandanna and &quot;sneaking suit&quot;, would serve as the template for all future incarnations in later &quot;Metal Gear&quot; games. According to Shinkawa, Snake&#x27;s physique in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; was based on that of action star Jean-Claude Van Damme, while his facial appearance inspired by actor Christopher Walken. Shinkawa described his rendition of Solid Snake from &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; as a &quot;middle ground&quot; between the younger Snake who was in the cover artwork of the first &quot;Metal Gear&quot; and the middle-aged Snake from the MSX2 version of &quot;Metal Gear 2&quot;. For the initial events from the Big Shell chapter from &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;, Snake&#x27;s visual appearance was sightly modified with his hair being more blonde, and his appearance somewhat resembling the Man with No Name (as portrayed by Clint Eastwood). Shinkawa commented that Snake was one of the easiest &quot;Metal Gear&quot; characters for him to draw, as his appearance is consistent across games with only minor changes. According to Kojima, Snake&#x27;s character model was specifically designed to have a well-sculpted buttocks, as the player spends the majority of the game staring at the character&#x27;s back from a third-person view.

By the time &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot; started development, Kojima told Shinkawa about his idea of making Snake look elderly, which surprised the designer. Once Shinkawa showed his artwork of Old Snake to the staff, they were all also surprised by the idea of playing as an old version of the character. However, they were satisfied with the end product as the staff began to like the character. In &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot;, one of Kojima&#x27;s endings would have had Snake and Otacon turn themselves in for breaking the law, and subsequently they would be convicted and executed. However, comments from Kojima&#x27;s staff who were disappointed with his death resulted in the character&#x27;s survival. In &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot;, Old Snake is modelled after Lee Van Cleef who appeared in &quot;Escape from New York&quot;.

===Voice actors===
In the games, Solid Snake has been voiced by Akio Ōtsuka in the Japanese version, and by David Hayter in the English adaptations. When working in &quot;Captain Planet&quot;, Hayter met the casting director of this show, Kris Zimmerman, who would later also be the voice-over director for &quot;Metal Gear&quot; games. When debuting in &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;, Hayter was impressed by the game&#x27;s cutscenes and the amount of dialogue. One of Snake&#x27;s lines that Hayter liked was &quot;I just didn&#x27;t expect a world-class designer of military technology to be so… cute.&quot; when Snake interacts with Mei Ling, believing it showed a more fun side of him. Solid Snake&#x27;s English voice was inspired by Hayter&#x27;s experience with Japan&#x27;s storytelling, resulting in minor changes for the script. Hayter himself felt shocked when &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot; was released as the narrative focused more on newcomer Raiden rather than him. Although there were no news about Snake&#x27;s future role in &quot;Metal Gear&quot;, the actor believes &quot;Guns of the Patriots&quot; gave the character a proper closure. One of Snake&#x27;s final scenes in this game bothered Hayter as during the ending the character hesitates to kill himself despite having killed multiple enemies in fights. Nevertheless, Hayter stated that he &quot;loves&quot; the character he was given to portray.

Other than the aforementioned voice actors, Solid Snake has also been dubbed in four different languages for the European localization of &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;; in French by Emmanuel Bonami, in German by Stephan Grothgar, in Italian by Alessandro Ricci, and in Spanish by Alfonso Vallés.

==Reception==
===Popularity===
Solid Snake&#x27;s character was very well received by gaming media. &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; included him in the section &quot;top ten forces of good&quot; in their 2004 list of top 50 retro game heroes. In 2005, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; listed Solid Snake as number one as the top ten video game characters of all time. Solid Snake appeared in multiple GameFAQs &quot;Character Battle&quot; contests, and was runner-up in three: the &quot;Character Battle V&quot; in 2006, the &quot;Character Battle VII&quot; in 2008, and the &quot;Character Battle IX&quot; in 2013. In an Oricon poll from 2008, his character was voted as the most popular video game character in Japan, tying with Nintendo&#x27;s Pikachu. In a &quot;Famitsu&quot; poll in 2010, Solid Snake was voted by readers as the most popular video game character. His character was amongst the last 16 contestants on the greatest video game hero on GameSpot contest held in 2009, and lost out to Gordon Freeman on a tiebreaker. In the &quot;Guinness World Records Gamer&#x27;s Edition&quot; from 2011, Solid Snake was voted as the fourth most popular video game character. In 2011, &quot;Empire&quot; ranked Solid Snake as the 19th greatest video game character, adding that &quot;beginning as an action pastiche, he swiftly evolved into his very own character&quot;. In 2007, ScrewAttack ranked him as the sixth &quot;coolest&quot; character in video games. 1UP.com listed him second in the list of top video game smokers, while GamesRadar placed him at the top of their 2009 list of manliest men in video game history. &quot;Complex&quot; ranked him as fourth on the list of top &quot;pervs&quot; in games in 2012 and as the seventh greatest soldier in video games in 2013. In 2021, Chris Morgan for &quot;Yardbarker&quot; described Snake as one of &quot;the most memorable characters from old school Nintendo games&quot;. &quot;HobbyConsolas&quot; named Snake as third of their &quot;The 30 best heroes of the last 30 years.&quot;

===Critical response===
Critics have commented on his traits and appearance, often praising Solid Snake for his appealing personality. Rich Knight and Gus Turner from &quot;Complex&quot; acknowledged him as one of the best video game mascot, praising his &quot;deep, human emotion that other characters fail to match.&quot; IGN also remarked their rivalry, saying &quot;Few rivalries in games have spanned as massive and confusing a timeline as Solid Snake and Liquid Snake&quot;. Among the several characters he encounters, critics noticed that Snake&#x27;s friendship with Otacon was one of the best parts of his character due to the contrast it has with enemies as well as how he Snake comforts him in &quot;Sons of Liberty&quot;. His rivalry with Big Boss was also popular according to journalists, especially when they are compared as son and father and genetic heir. Various gaming sites such as 1UP.com, &quot;Game Informer&quot; and Kotaku joked on the poor relationship between the two of them as the father attempts to murder his own son. Among other character relationships, Snake and Gray Fox were popular due to the variety of enemies the player faces.

Solid Snake&#x27;s &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot; design was at the bottom of the worst game character makeovers list by &quot;GamePro&quot;, condemning his conversion in hairstyle in comparison to his &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot; design, and was also at the top of IGN&#x27;s list of the worst video game haircuts. The book &quot;Playing with Videogames&quot; states that Raiden&#x27;s inclusion was intended to surprise &quot;Metal Gear&quot; fans who, instead of playing as Snake, played as his opposite. Writer James Newman commented that fans&#x27; reactions were highly negative; they acted as though Kojima had betrayed their expectations. He compared Raiden to the controversial &quot;Star Wars&quot; character Jar Jar Binks. &quot;Eurogamer&quot;″s Tom Bramwell commented that his interactions with the other characters also helped expand Solid Snake&#x27;s character. His interactions with veteran Solid Snake identify the former as &quot;a &quot;Metal Gear&quot; fan&quot;. As the game progresses it is stated that Raiden &quot;has become Snake&quot;, having developed skills similar to those he gained from taking part in the Big Shell&#x27;s fights that resemble &quot;Metal Gear Solid&quot;″s Shadow Moses Island. Before &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3: Snake Eater&quot;, the character was thought to be the game&#x27;s protagonist because of his physical resemblances with Naked Snake. However, later previews speculated how was it impossible for Solid Snake to be in the game&#x27;s settings, leading to the conclusion it was a young incarnation of his father. A comparison between Solid Snake&#x27;s and Big Boss&#x27;s characters was made by IGN in article &quot;Stars Thunderdome: Snake vs. Big Boss.&quot;

The character&#x27;s appearance in &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4&quot; has received mostly positive opinions. Before it was released, various speculations were made regarding his role. As he was the only one who suffered from a drastic change in appearance, IGN commented that the most famous rumor was the one of his body deteriorating across the game. Moreover, since it had been announced it would be his last appearance, IGN and GamesRadar wondered whether the character would die during the game and if Raiden would replace him following his death. GamesRadar commented that his character was one of the few gaming characters that aged across video games. &quot;GamePro&quot; also listed Old Snake as one of the biggest surprises from the game, as the character was found interesting in contrast to pessimistic thoughts they had before the game&#x27;s release. GameDaily listed the &quot;old hero&quot; as one of their list of top video game archetypes, using the old version of the character as an example of this. &quot;PLAY&quot; gave praise to his moustache considering how highly detailed it is, and represents the change from Solid Snake&#x27;s character. On the other hand, 1UP.com criticized it as the most gracelessly aging characters as it gave negative messages about aging. 1UP.com listed their fight as the 13 &quot;most dumbass&quot; boss battles for its simple style in comparison to other more challenging bosses from &quot;Metal Gear Solid 3&quot; and its excessive length for a hand-to-hand fight between two old people. The design resulted in mixed reactions regarding whether or not the character kept his original sex appeal.

GameDaily made Solid Snake top their &quot;Smash Bros.&quot; characters list, while &quot;PLAY&quot; listed him as one of the characters they wanted to be playable in &quot;Mortal Kombat&quot;. The character customization in &quot;Soulcalibur IV&quot; that allowed to create Solid Snake was listed by UGO as one of the best ones from the series owing to his popularity within gamers. Gavin Jasper of &quot;Den of Geek&quot; ranked Solid Snake as 12th of &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; characters, and stated that &quot;bringing Snake in &quot;Smash Bros.&quot; was an act of pure dominance.&quot; Jeremy Parish of &quot;Polygon&quot; ranked 73 fighters from &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; &quot;from garbage to glorious&quot;, listing Solid Snake as 18th, stating that &quot;The legendary super-soldier Solid Snake remains one of gaming&#x27;s greatest and most tragic figures.&quot; People expressed some disappointment on &quot;Super Smash Bros. Ultimate&quot; when Solid Snake wears a skintight stealth suit, and the rendition being completely changed. Leaving the character&#x27;s butt being reduced.

Akio Otsuka&#x27;s and David Hayter&#x27;s performances as Solid Snake&#x27;s voice actors has received praise. Ōtsuka remembers being surprised during his debut as a result of the large amount of dialogue Solid Snake was given. Hayter&#x27;s performance was called one of the greatest in gaming as well as one of the character&#x27;s most recognizable traits. In 2013, &quot;Game Informer&quot; ranked Hayter&#x27;s role as Solid Snake as the seventh most memorable character voice in video games for &quot;a portrayal that&#x27;s considered to be a real classic in the history of video game voice acting&quot;. In 2024, a poll conducted by BAFTA with around 4,000 respondents named Solid Snake as the fourteenth most iconic video-game character of all time.

===Controversy===
In the &quot;Tekken 7&quot; Evo 2019 finals, the character was used to have a chat with developer Katsuhiro Harada. The organizers of Evo stated this was a joke as many fans believed it was a hint for a possible usage of the character as downloadable content. David Hayter complained about this joke as Evo did not consult Konami or him when using the audio.

<doc id="372524" wikidata="Q4868230" url="?curid=372524" title="Bastard Nation">
<text>Bastard Nation is a North American adult adoptee political advocacy and support organization. It was founded in 1996 by denizens of the Usenet newsgroup alt.adoption Shea Grimm, Damsel Plum, Marley Greiner and Lainie Petersen. The original intent of the organization was to support adult adoptees in gaining access to their original birth certificates as a civil right, rather than as a vehicle for facilitating a search, which had been the aim of prior open records organizations. It is also distinguished from search-and-reconnection focused organizations in that it supports the full spectrum of the adult adoptee experience, including adoptees who do not wish to search and adoptees whose reconnections were a bad experience.

Besides advocating adult adoptee access to original birth certificates, Bastard Nation also launches campaigns against negative stereotypes of adoption and adoptees.

North American adoptee birth certificates were originally sealed only to non-family members in the early 20th century but after World War II most states sealed adoptee birth certificates permanently to all parties involved: the adoptee, the adoptive parents and the birthparents.

The group has been successful in getting several states in the United States to approve legislation to open sealed records, for example in Oregon by Ballot Measure 58, described in the book &quot;Adoption Politics: Bastard Nation &amp; Ballot Initiative 58&quot; by E. Wayne Carp (2004). They have members throughout the United States, Canada and the world.

The name is a reference to the fact that most adopted children were born illegitimate, hence are literally &quot;bastards&quot;. The term &quot;bastard&quot; is employed both for shock value, and in an effort to reclaim the term for common usage (as was done by the organization Queer Nation with the word &quot;queer&quot;).

<doc id="372526" wikidata="Q5326940" url="?curid=372526" title="Earnings">
<text>Earnings are the net benefits of a corporation&#x27;s operation. Earnings is also the amount on which corporate tax is due. For an analysis of specific aspects of corporate operations several more specific terms are used as EBIT (earnings before interest and taxes) and EBITDA (earnings before interest, taxes, depreciation, and amortization).

Many alternative terms for earnings are in common use, such as income and profit. These terms in turn have a variety of definitions, depending on their context and the objectives of the authors. For instance, the IRS uses the term profit to describe earnings, whereas for the corporation the profit it reports is the amount left after taxes are taken out.

==Non-routine earnings==
The use of intellectual property generates non-routine profits. Those are often an order-of-magnitude greater than routine earnings. Non-routine profits are essential to warrant the high investments needed for high-technology industries.

== Earnings manipulation ==
Some statistical models (e.g. based on Benford&#x27;s law or Beneish M-score) are used in order to detect possible earnings manipulations (fraud).

<doc id="372532" wikidata="Q1394990" url="?curid=372532" title="Walter Rodney">
<text>Walter Anthony Rodney (23 March 1942 – 13 June 1980) was a Guyanese historian, political activist and academic. His notable works include &quot;How Europe Underdeveloped Africa&quot;, first published in 1972. He was assassinated in Georgetown, Guyana, in 1980.

== Biography ==

=== Early career ===
Walter Anthony Rodney was born in 1942 into a working-class family in Georgetown, Guyana. He attended the University College of the West Indies in 1960 and was awarded a first-class honours degree in history in 1963. He earned a PhD in African History in 1966 at the School of Oriental and African Studies in London, England, at the age of 24. His dissertation, which focused on the slave trade on the Upper Guinea Coast, was published by the Oxford University Press in 1970 under the title &quot;A History of the Upper Guinea Coast 1545–1800&quot; and was widely acclaimed for its originality in challenging the conventional wisdom on the topic.

Rodney travelled widely and became known internationally as an activist, scholar and formidable orator. He taught at the University of Dar es Salaam in Tanzania during the periods 1966–67 and 1969–1974 and in 1968 at his alma mater University of the West Indies at Mona, Jamaica. He was sharply critical of the middle class for its role in the post-independence Caribbean. He was also a strong critic of capitalism and argued that only under &quot;the banner of Socialism and through the leadership of the working classes&quot; could Africa break from imperialism.

On 15 October 1968, the government of Jamaica, led by prime minister Hugh Shearer, declared Rodney &quot;persona non grata&quot;. The decision to ban him from ever returning to Jamaica and his subsequent dismissal by the University of the West Indies, Mona, caused protests by students and the poor of West Kingston that escalated into a riot, known as the Rodney Riots, resulting in six deaths and causing millions of dollars in damages. The riots, which began on 16 October 1968, triggered an increase in political awareness across the Caribbean, especially among the Afrocentric Rastafarian sector of Jamaica, documented in Rodney&#x27;s book &quot;The Groundings with my Brothers,&quot; published by Bogle-L&#x27;Ouverture Publications in 1969.

In 1969, Rodney returned to the University of Dar es Salaam. He was promoted to senior lecturer there in 1971 and promoted to associate professor in 1973. He worked at the university until 1974 when he returned to Guyana. He was promised a professorship at the University of Guyana in Georgetown but the Forbes Burnham government rescinded the offer when Rodney arrived in Guyana. 

Rodney was close to C.L.R. James, among others, and supported the socialist government of Julius Nyerere. While his academic work contributed &quot;to the emergence of decolonised African social sciences,&quot; Rodney worked to disseminate knowledge in Tanzanian villages, where he spoke in Kiswahili, the language of the people. He continued his pan-African activism and, analysing the causes of the continent&#x27;s underdevelopment, published &quot;How Europe Underdeveloped Africa&quot; in 1972. With a view to the Pan-African Congress of 1974, he prepared a text on the &quot;international class struggle in Africa, the Caribbean and America.&quot; In this landmark work, Rodney denounced leaders who, like Félix Houphouët-Boigny, Jean-Claude Duvalier, Idi Amin Dada and Joseph Mobutu, were turning to tribalism under the guise of &quot;negritude.&quot;

Rodney became a prominent Pan-Africanist and Marxist, and was important in the Black Power movement in the Caribbean and North America. While living in Dar es Salaam, he was influential in developing a new centre of African learning and discussion.

=== Later life ===
In 1974, Rodney returned to Guyana from Tanzania. He was due to take up a position as a professor at the University of Guyana, but the Guyanese government prevented his appointment. Increasingly active in politics, he joined the Working People&#x27;s Alliance (WPA), a party that provided the most effective and credible opposition to the People&#x27;s National Congress government and aimed to &quot;create political consciousness, replacing ethnic politics with revolutionary organisations based on class solidarity.&quot; In 1979, he was arrested and charged with arson after two government offices were burned. The trial was deferred three times and later dropped due to lack of evidence.

== Death ==
On 13 June 1980, Rodney was killed in Georgetown, at the age of 38, by an explosive communication device in his car, a month after he returned from celebrations of independence in Zimbabwe at a time of intense political activism. He was survived by his wife, Patricia, and three children. His brother, Donald Rodney, who was injured in the explosion, said that a sergeant in the Guyana Defence Force and a member of the House of Israel, named Gregory Smith, had given Walter the explosive that killed him. After the killing, Smith fled to French Guiana, where he died in 2002.

&quot;I found Rodney to be a deeply intelligent and compassionate man, with a hatred of bloodshed but a deep and growing fear that violence and civil war might be the inevitable consequence of Burnham&#x27;s determination to hold on to power by all available means&quot; (1979) Sam Silkin, former UK Attorney General.

=== Aftermath ===
It is widely believed, but not proven, that the assassination was set up by Guyana&#x27;s president, (Guyanese Government was found liable for Rodney’s death in 2017 by Commission of Inquiry) Linden Forbes Burnham. Rodney believed that the various ethnic groups historically disenfranchised by the ruling colonial class should work together, a position that challenged Burnham&#x27;s hold on power.

In 2014, a Commission of Inquiry (COI) was held during which a new witness, Holland Gregory Yearwood, came forward claiming to be a long-standing friend of Rodney and a former member of the WPA. Yearwood testified that Rodney presented detonators to him weeks prior to the explosion asking for assistance in assembling a bomb. Yet the same Commission of Inquiry (COI) concluded in their report that Rodney&#x27;s death was a state-ordered killing, and that then Prime Minister Forbes Burnham must have had knowledge of the plot.

Donald Rodney, Walter&#x27;s brother, was in the car with him during the time of the assassination, and was convicted in 1982 of possessing explosives in connection with the incident that killed his brother. On 14 April 2021, the Guyana Court of Appeals overturned this judgment and Donald&#x27;s sentence, exonerating him after forty years in which he contested his conviction.

On 9 August 2021, the National Assembly of Guyana voted to adopt &quot;Resolution No. 23&quot; to implement the 2016 findings of &quot;The Commission of Inquiry Appointed to Enquire and Report on the Circumstances Surrounding the Death in An Explosion of the Late Dr. Walter Rodney on Thirteenth Day of June, One Thousand, Nine Hundred and Eighty at Georgetown&quot;.

==Academic influence==
Walter Rodney&#x27;s most influential book is &quot;How Europe Underdeveloped Africa&quot;, published in 1972 by Bogle-L&#x27;Ouverture Publications, London, England and the Tanzanian Publishing House (TPH) Dar es Salaam Tanzania. In it Rodney described how Africa had been exploited by European imperialists, which he argued led directly to the modern underdevelopment of most of the continent. The book became influential as well as controversial: it was groundbreaking in that it was among the first to bring a new perspective to the question of underdevelopment in Africa. Rodney&#x27;s analysis went far beyond the previously accepted approach in the study of Third World underdevelopment.

Rodney&#x27;s community-grounded approach to mass education during the 1960s and his detailed descriptions of his pedagogical approach in &quot;Groundings&quot; (1969) document his role as an important critical pedagogue and contemporary of Paulo Freire.

==Honors and awards==

Rodney&#x27;s death was commemorated in a poem by Martin Carter entitled &quot;For Walter Rodney,&quot; by the dub poet Linton Kwesi Johnson in &quot;Reggae fi Radni,&quot; and by Kamau Brathwaite in his poem &quot;Poem for Walter Rodney&quot; (&quot;Elegguas,&quot; 2010).

<doc id="372541" wikidata="Q4794497" url="?curid=372541" title="Arnaud de Borchgrave">
<text>Arnaud Charles Paul Marie Philippe de Borchgrave (26 October 1926 – 15 February 2015) was a Belgian–American journalist who specialized in international politics. Following a long career with the news magazine &quot;Newsweek&quot;, covering 17 wars in 30 years as a foreign correspondent, he held key editorial and executive positions with &quot;The Washington Times&quot; and United Press International. Borchgrave was also a founding member of Newsmax Media.

==Early life and education==

Borchgrave was born in Brussels into the De Borchgrave d&#x27;Altena family. He was the son of Belgian Count Baudouin de Borchgrave d&#x27;Altena, later head of military intelligence for the Belgian government in exile during World War II, and his British wife Audrey Dorothy Louise Townshend. His mother was the daughter of Major General Sir Charles Townshend and his French wife, Alice Cahen d&#x27;Anvers, who appeared in a notable 1881 portrait alongside her sister in Pierre-Auguste Renoir&#x27;s &quot;Pink and Blue&quot;. His maternal great-grandfather was Count Louis Cahen d&#x27;Anvers, a prominent French banker. He was a descendant of George Townshend, 1st Marquess Townshend, through his second son, Lord John Townshend.

Borchgrave was educated in Belgium, at King&#x27;s Canterbury in England, and in the United States. 

In 1940, as Belgium fell to Nazi Germany&#x27;s invasion, he and his family escaped on a freighter, and were rescued by a British destroyer after the freighter&#x27;s captain had attempted to divert to Hamburg.

==Career==
===Royal Navy===
From 1942 to 1946, during much of World War II, Borchgrave served in the British Royal Navy. He enrolled at age 15, after running away from home and convincing his grandmother to assist in falsifying his age so he could enlist. He was awarded the Maritime Medal by Belgium.

===Journalism===
====Newsweek====
In 1947, Borchgrave was appointed as the Brussels bureau manager for United Press, and in 1950 he became &quot;Newsweek&quot;″s bureau chief in Paris, and then its chief correspondent. In 1951, he gave up his Belgian title of nobility in 1951.

In 1953, he became a senior editor for the magazine. Osborn Elliott, former editor-in-chief of &quot;Newsweek&quot;, once said:
De Borchgrave has played a role in world affairs known to no other journalist. He has been able to tap the thinking of numerous world leaders... despite his intimacy with major policymakers, he has never aligned himself with either side of a dispute... Arnaud de Borchgrave has made significant contributions to world peace and understanding.
As a correspondent for &quot;Newsweek&quot;, Borchgrave secured several interviews with world leaders. In 1969, he interviewed both President Gamal Abdel Nasser of Egypt and Prime Minister Levi Eshkol of Israel. 

In October 1972, during the Vietnam War, he travelled to Hanoi to interview Prime Minister and Politburo member Pham Van Dong in North Vietnam. In that interview, Dong described a provision of a proposed peace deal as a &quot;coalition of transition,&quot; which raised fears in South Vietnam that the deal involved a coalition government and may have played a role in South Vietnam&#x27;s rejection of the deal.

In 1980, Borchgrave co-authored &quot;The Spike&quot;, a novel, with Robert Moss. 

====The Washington Times and UPI====

In March 1985, he was appointed editor-in-chief of &quot;The Washington Times&quot;, and went on to serve in the late 1990s as CEO of a much-diminished United Press International, the successor to his early-career employer, during the latter part of the agency&#x27;s ownership by a group of Saudi investors. In that role, Borchgrave orchestrated UPI&#x27;s exit from its last major media niche, the broadcast news business that United Press had initiated in the 1930s. 

He maintained that &quot;what was brilliant pioneering work on the part of UPI prior to World War II, with radio news, is now a static quantity and so far as I&#x27;m concerned, certainly doesn&#x27;t fit into my plans for the future.&quot; He sought to shift UPI&#x27;s dwindling resources into Internet-based delivery of newsletter services, focusing more on technical and diplomatic specialties than on general news. The rump UPI thus sold their client list of its still-significant radio network and broadcast wire to its former rival, the AP.

The following year, Borchgrave played a key role in the sale of the further downsized UPI to News World Communications, the international news media company founded in 1976 by Unification Church leader Sun Myung Moon, who was also the founder of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; for which Borchgrave had worked earlier.

After his CEO turn at UPI, Borchgrave became &quot;Editor-at-Large&quot; of &quot;The Washington Times&quot; and &quot;UPI,&quot; writing regular columns published by either or both and retaining associations with both Unification Church-owned media outlets. He also served as Project Director for Transnational Threats and Senior Advisor at the Center for Strategic and International Studies. He was a contributor to &quot;The Globalist&quot;, a daily online magazine.

According to &quot;Flashback&quot;, a 1990 book by Morley Safer, Borchgrave testified before Senator Jeremiah Denton&#x27;s subcommittee in 1981 that Pham Xuan An, a &quot;Time&quot; employee and Viet Cong spy based in Saigon, &quot;was an agent whose mission was to disinform the Western press&quot;. An denied to Safer that he planted disinformation, saying that his Viet Cong bosses thought it would be too obvious and that they preferred he feed them information instead.

Borchgrave was a founding member of Newsmax Media. He also belonged to the Foreign Policy Association, occasionally appearing as a panelist in their videos and events.

As a journalist, Borchgrave interviewed many heads of state, heads of government, monarchs, and key figures of the world, including Mullah Omar, who he interviewed with UPI international consultant Ammar Turabi three months prior to the September 11 attacks. The interview offered insight for decision and policy makers globally and has been published in several print media multiple times since the 2001 attacks, and UPI considers the interview, the only one ever conducted with Omar, one of its best achievements, including it in &quot;UPI&#x27;s 100 Years of Excellence&quot;.

====Plagiarism allegations====
On 17 May 2012, Erik Wemple, a blogger for &quot;The Washington Post&quot;, reported that Borchgrave&#x27;s columns in &quot;The Washington Times&quot; reflected his think tank work at the Center for Strategic and International Studies (CSIS), and raised questions about the originality of some of his writing, citing similarities between elements of his columns and other published material. Wemple included Borchgrave&#x27;s explanations for those, but also the doubts expressed about the similarities by some of the other organizations involved. Elsewhere, the news website &quot;Salon&quot; reported that anonymous &quot;Washington Times&quot; officials claimed that the paper had known about Borchgrave&#x27;s plagiarism nearly a year before Wemple&#x27;s investigation and had initially discontinued his column before resuming it without any disciplinary action.

Borchgrave denied the allegations and claimed that his column was suspended because he was on book leave. The &quot;Washington Times&quot; then announced that Borchgrave would take a hiatus to complete work on his memoirs while the paper conducted an inquiry into his work. Some of Borchgrave&#x27;s latest columns were removed from the &quot;Washington Times&quot; website. CSIS conducted its own investigation of work Borchgrave had published under its name.

==French Legion of Honor award ==
In July 2014, Borchgrave was awarded a knighthood in France&#x27;s the Legion of Honour.

==In media==
Borchgrave has been featured on several TV and Internet shows, including Weekend World, The Bob Braun Show, The Tonight Show Starring Johnny Carson, The McLaughlin Group, Paula Zahn Now, and James Goodale&#x27;s &quot;Digital Age&quot; on WNYE-TV.

He appeared as himself in a 1984 United States Information Agency report titled &quot;Soviet Active Measures&quot;.

==Personal life==
In 1969, following two earlier marriages, Borchgrave married Alexandra Villard, daughter of the ambassador and author Henry Serrano Villard. Together with John Cullen, Alexandra published a biography of Henry Villard, a railroad tycoon and her great-grandfather.

==Death==
Borchgrave died of bladder cancer in Washington, D.C. on February 15, 2015, at the age of 88. He was a member of the Metropolitan Club of Washington D.C.

<doc id="372542" wikidata="Q5318679" url="?curid=372542" title="Dyker Heights, Brooklyn">
<text>Dyker Heights is a predominantly residential neighborhood in the southwest corner of the borough of Brooklyn in New York City. It is on a hill between Bay Ridge, Bensonhurst, Borough Park, and Gravesend Bay. The neighborhood is bounded by 7th and 14th Avenues, 65th Street, and the Belt Parkway on the west, east, north, and south, respectively.

Dyker Heights originated as a speculative luxury housing development in October 1895 when Walter Loveridge Johnson developed a portion of woodland into a suburban community. It maintained its status as a wealthy neighborhood through the 20th century. During the height of his development, the boundaries were primarily between Tenth and Thirteenth Avenues and from 79th Street to 86th Street. The finest homes of the development were situated along the top of the hill, at about Eleventh Avenue and 82nd Street.

Dyker Heights has a suburban character with detached and semi-detached one-and two-family homes, many of which have driveways and private yards, which are uncommon in parts of New York City. The neighborhood contains tree-lined streets, and there are very few apartment buildings. Dyker Heights can be divided in roughly three sections. The southernmost section, south of 86th Street and east of 7th Avenue, contains Dyker Beach Park and Golf Course. The central section between Bay Ridge Parkway and 86th Street, and between 14th Avenue and Fort Hamilton Parkway, is more exclusive in character. The northern border of the neighborhood is more closely integrated with surrounding areas. The Dyker Heights Civic Association, founded in 1928, is a civic group that represents the community&#x27;s interests. The area as a whole is known for its Christmas lighting displays, which are often elaborate.
Dyker Heights is part of Brooklyn Community District 10, and its primary ZIP Code is 11228. It is patrolled by the 68th Precinct of the New York City Police Department. Politically it is represented by the New York City Council&#x27;s 43rd District.

==History==

===Early development===

The neighborhood of Dyker Heights lies within the boundaries of the then-Dutch town of New Utrecht settled in 1657. The area that is now known as Dyker Heights was not developed in the 17th or 18th century because the land was too sloped for farming; it remained common woodland until the mid-19th century. The trees of this forest were used by the townsfolk as a source of firewood and construction material. When the agricultural industry of New Utrecht changed from the farming grains to the cultivation of market garden produce, the trees were cleared for tomatoes, cabbages, and potatoes, among other produce.

The first house built at the top of the hill (what is now 11th Avenue and 82nd Street, at about above sea level) was built in the late 1820s by Brigadier General René Edward De Russy of the US Army. De Russy was a military engineer who built many forts in the US – from the Canada–US border and the eastern seaboard to the Gulf of Mexico and the Pacific coast – including Fort Hamilton in Brooklyn. Since this was the tallest natural point in southwest Brooklyn, he built his homestead here – it afforded a clear view of the harbor and its defenses, especially Fort Hamilton which was complete by November 1831. De Russy died in 1865 and his wife, Helen, sold the property in 1888 to Jane Elisabeth Loveridge and Frederick Henry Johnson.

According to the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot;, Frederick Johnson did &quot;much toward developing the locality in which he resided. He was the author of the original New Utrecht Improvement Bill, and an ardent advocate of the annexation of the Town to this City.&quot; The Town of New Utrecht was annexed to the City of Brooklyn on July 1, 1894. On January 1, 1898, the City of Brooklyn was annexed to the City of New York. Involved with real estate, Johnson was probably aware of the real estate pressures on and potential of the real estate in New Utrecht. With this in mind, he most likely purchased the De Russy estate with the intention of building an upscale residential neighborhood similar to Bensonhurst-by-the-Sea, built by James D. Lynch in 1880–1890 in the Bath Beach section of New Utrecht. At that time, the &quot;Real Estate Record&quot; claimed Bensonhurst-by-the-Sea was &quot;the most perfectly developed suburb ever laid out around New York.&quot; The restrictions placed upon the property made Bensonhurst-by-the-Sea &quot;a model settlement, where some of the most refined, intelligent and cultured of New York City and Brooklyn&#x27;s citizens have built their homes.&quot;

Following Johnson&#x27;s death on August 15, 1893, at the age of 52, his second son, Walter Loveridge Johnson, took over the real estate business and by October 1895 started Dyker Heights on his parents&#x27; property. Johnson named his development &quot;Dyker Heights&quot; after the Dyker Meadow and Beach, which his development overlooks. The meadow and beach received their name from either the Van Dykes (an original New Utrecht family) who built the dykes to drain the meadow, or for the dykes that the Van Dykes built. Johnson was able to develop this portion of New Utrecht woodland into a residential community by making necessary improvements to it. In 1890, the only roads present were Kings Highway, 86th Street, Denyse&#x27;s Lane, and a small unnamed road near Tenth Avenue – none of which were paved and only 86th Street was a thoroughfare specifically planned as such. The remaining land was unimproved. Johnson continued Brooklyn&#x27;s street grid south with macadam pavement, graded the properties, installed gas, water, telephone, and electricity lines, and planted sugar maple trees – seven on the avenues and twenty along the streets. This opened over two hundred more building sites between Tenth and 13th Avenues as well as between 79th and 86th Streets.

In 1895, Johnson, very much aware of the successful Bensonhurst-by-the-Sea, built three homes. His home was on the southwest corner of 11th Avenue and 82nd Street (across the Avenue from the home of his mother), Albert Edward Parfitt&#x27;s home was on 82nd Street next to Johnson&#x27;s, and the last, closest to Tenth Avenue, was the home of Arthur S. Tuttle who was Assistant Engineer of The Water Supply of The City Works Department of The City of Brooklyn. Parfitt was the architect of these three homes. Johnson&#x27;s house burned down before 1900, Parfitt&#x27;s was demolished by a developer in 1928 and replaced with seven, run-of-the-mill, fully detached, single-family homes, and Tuttle&#x27;s house was remodeled over 10 years ago and clad in bright-white and sky-blue brick.

Throughout the infancy of the development, Johnson was able to use the print press to his advantage. He advertised his suburban homes heavily and stated that the high ground, magnificent ocean view, and careful restrictions made Dyker Heights the handsomest suburb in Greater New York. Based on the newspaper accounts, he was right. In 1896 Johnson built and sold thirty homes in Dyker Heights. By January 1897, the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; reported on his achievements. &quot;Mr. Johnson has met with great success in the development of Dyker Heights and had probably done more business and made more sales during the past year than all the rest of the surrounding settlements combined.&quot; In April 1898 sales were still very strong. &quot;Dyker Heights still holds its lead among the suburban sections in building operations, over forty houses having been erected there during the past year... and there are fully twenty more houses about to be built.&quot; One of its many advantages was the location, which according to the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot;, &quot;is one of the finest in Greater New York, commanding an extensive view of water from Sandy Hook to the New Jersey Palisades, with Staten Island and the shores of New Jersey directly in front.&quot; Still more praise in February 1899, &quot;Dyker Heights has been one of the most successful and the most rapid in growth of any of the suburban settlements, over one hundred dwellings, costing from $5,000 to $25,000 each, having been erected there within the last two years.&quot;

===Advantages of the development===

In September 1899, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; even reported on the advantages of the development, recommending it to &quot;the busy man of Wall Street&quot; because of &quot;its magnificent transportation facilities... it can be reached via the Thirty-Ninth Street Brooklyn Ferry and Eighty-Sixth Street Nassau Line in 45 minutes.&quot; In addition, the article claimed that &quot;the 45 minutes&#x27; trip between Dyker Heights and Wall Street by water and rail is as invigorating as the Dyker Heights climate is healthy-living. The rare opportunities afforded by Dyker Heights to the wealthy and to those in moderate circumstances are due largely to the energy, enterprise and good taste of its founder, Mr. Walter L. Johnson.&quot; A month later, &quot;The Wall Street Journal&quot; published &quot;An Ideal Spot for a Home&quot;. From that article, one can clearly see why Dyker Heights was so successful. Its location and luxurious homes were first rate, &quot;[Dyker Heights] is without a rival as to location, situated as it is at an elevation of [110] feet above the sea level, and is directly opposite the new Dyker Meadow Park... which will be the only seaside park in Greater New York.&quot; The article also explained the exclusiveness of the property, which can be seen in &quot;its massive stone piers with heavy wrought-iron lamps and scrolls&quot; that adorn the entrances. In December 1899 the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; reported that, &quot;work has recently been commenced upon thirty high-class Houses, the demand for which runs a dead heat with the supply.&quot;

Johnson set very high standards for the community: the Wall Street Journal explained &quot;the property is carefully restricted against all nuisances and no building can be erected upon a plot of less than in width by in depth, and each building must cost at least $4,000 and stand well back from the street.&quot; These regulations, which were similar to those of Bensonhurst-by-the-Sea, were active until 1915. However, the most desirable feature of the area was still the &quot;uninterrupted view of the lower bay from The Narrows to Sandy Hook and Atlantic Ocean, [which] is one of the most magnificent in the country, and nowhere else in the consolidated city is there anything to compare it with. From here can be seen a marine panorama hard to beat.&quot; Dyker Heights was so desirous that important members of society flocked to it. The &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; reported in December 1899 that this &quot;drain&quot; on the more established social neighborhoods such as Brooklyn Heights and those in Manhattan, &quot;almost threatens to lower the social tone of the neighborhoods where this universal exodus is effecting a gradual change in the character of the population.&quot;

===Late 19th and early 20th centuries===
Property on 84th Street near 13th Avenue was made available to the International Sunshine Society in 1906 by lawyer, financier, and promoter George E. Crater, Jr. The society
was able to acquire the house for $11,000, roughly half the market value, and opened the Dyker Heights Home for Blind Babies on 1 November 1906. Cynthia W. Alden, Mary C. Seward, and other society officers worked with the New York City Board of Education to establish the first public kindergarten for
blind children at the home in 1907.
The original building is gone, but the work begun in Dyker Heights provided a legacy of significant reforms in the public education of blind children within New York and other regions of the United States.

One of the many focal points of the neighborhood was the Dyker Heights Club, which started in October 1896. By spring of 1898 the club had a $30,000 clubhouse designed by Albert Edward Parfitt on an $8,500 lot, measuring 200×200, located on the northeast corner of 13th Avenue and 86th Street. Johnson moved his real estate office into the clubhouse and hired a full-time architect, Constantine Schubert, who was also a Dyker Heights homeowner. This grand, neo-classical building was demolished in 1929 by the Archbishop John Hughes Knights of Columbus Club, when they acquired the property for $60,000.

Early in the history of Dyker Heights, Johnson continually purchased consecutive tracts of land until the boundaries of Dyker Heights stretched from 79th Street in the north, roughly 86th Street in the south, Tenth Avenue to the west, and about east of 13th Avenue to the east. However, the boundaries of the Neighborhood of Dyker Heights are now defined by the Dyker Heights Post Office on the northwest corner of 13th and 84th Streets; along its northeast edge runs Bay Ridge Avenue; 16th Avenue is its southeast boundary; Fort Hamilton makes its southwest border; and Interstate 278 is the northwest limit.

== Demographics ==
Based on data from the 2010 United States Census, the population of Dyker Heights was 42,419, an increase of 3,087 (7.8%) from the 39,332 counted in 2000.

The racial makeup of the neighborhood was 70.2% White, 0.1% African American, 0.0% Native American, 27.1% Asian, 0.0% Pacific Islander, 0.1% from other races, and 1.0% (430) from two or more races. Hispanic or Latino of any race were 5.9% of the population.

The entirety of Community Board 13 had 142,075 inhabitants as of NYC Health&#x27;s 2018 Community Health Profile, with an average life expectancy of 83.1 years. This is higher than the median life expectancy of 81.2 for all New York City neighborhoods. Most inhabitants are middle-aged adults and youth: 20% are between the ages of 0–17, 34% between 25 and 44, and 25% between 45 and 64. The ratio of college-aged and elderly residents was lower, at 7% and 15% respectively.

As of 2016, the median household income in Community District 10 was $68,679. In 2018, an estimated 19% of Bay Ridge and Dyker Heights residents lived in poverty, compared to 21% in all of Brooklyn and 20% in all of New York City. One in twelve residents (8%) were unemployed, compared to 9% in the rest of both Brooklyn and New York City. Rent burden, or the percentage of residents who have difficulty paying their rent, is 49% in Bay Ridge and Dyker Heights, slightly lower than the citywide and boroughwide rates of 52% and 51% respectively. Based on this calculation, , Bay Ridge and Dyker Heights are considered to be high-income relative to the rest of the city.

===Cultural history===
The first residents were either local government officials or wealthy professionals. For instance, I. M. De Varona was engineer of the Water Bureau, Clarence Barrow was ex-Fire Commissioner, William C. Bryant was current Fire Commissioner, George W. Dickinson was a cotton-goods merchant, W. Bennett Wardell was a retired judge, Richard Perry Chittenden was Assistant of the Corporation Counsel, Freeland Willcox was Secretary of the Cheeseborough Vaseline Company, and Eugene Boucher was longshoreman and insurance broker.

Since the 1940s, Dyker Heights has had a majority Italian-American population. The &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; explained a problem Johnson had with a particular Italian family in a home &quot;which at the time was owned by Walter L. Johnson, was occupied by an Italian family, to whom Mr. Johnson paid $600 to vacate it in order that the neighborhood of Dyker Heights, which is very carefully restricted, might have no objectionable features about it.&quot; By 1940 Dyker Heights was inhabited by a majority of people of Italian descent many of whom helped establish the Roman Catholic Shrine Church of Saint Bernadette (ca. 1935) on 13th Avenue between 82nd and 83rd streets.

Dyker Heights Boulevard, also known as 13th Avenue, contains many Italian-owned businesses. Dyker Heights Boulevard is the only commercial district in Dyker Heights and is the de facto center of the neighborhood.

Around 11th Avenue between 60th and 70th Streets lies a Coptic speaking Egyptian community. St. George Coptic Orthodox Church serves the community. The church was established in 1973.

However, since the 2000s, there has been a slow growing influx of Asian residents into the neighborhood and New York City Department of City Planning released a 2020 census data showing for the first time in history, the Asian population in the neighborhood has surpassed the White population. The Asian population residents are between 30,000 and 39,999 while the remaining White population residents are between 10,000 and 19,999. The 2020 census data also showed a small, but significant Hispanic population residents of 5,000 to 9,999.

== Housing ==


Dyker Heights&#x27; housing stock consists mostly of stately, single-family detached and semi-detached bungalows.

In December 1899, the &quot;Brooklyn Eagle&quot; wrote a very detailed description of the homes in Dyker Heights:
Of the approximately 150 homes initially built by Johnson, about half remain; while the others have been razed and replaced by large Mediterranean villas, condos, as well as semi and fully attached homes. Very few of the newer homes fit into the historic context of Dyker Heights, and in contrast to Brooklyn&#x27;s contemporaneous Ditmas Park and Prospect Park South developments, many of the original surviving homes have been extensively renovated and remodeled.

=== Christmas decorations ===

Dyker Heights is now most famous for its Christmas lights and decorations erected each year by its residents. It has been called &quot;Con Ed&#x27;s warmest heartthrob&quot;, the &quot;undisputed capital of Christmas pageantry&quot;, and the &quot;king of the Christmas lights&quot;. Christmas lights are now the core of the Dyker Heights identity, because the whole community, not just one home or one block, participates. As such, Dyker Heights has been referred to as &quot;an epicenter of professionally-hung Christmas lights&quot;. Most holiday decorations in the area are not erected by homeowners, but by local decorating companies, but the cost of hiring professional decorators can vary greatly, from $1,000 to $20,000 or more, depending on the scale of the display; many companies also offer additional services, including the option to take down and store decorations.

Formally, the lighting and Christmas decorations begin on the last Thursday of November (Thanksgiving) and they remain until the first days of January, with mid-December being the days most visited by tourists.

Although in which December the lights began is unclear, newspaper reports and tours of the area suggest it started sometime in the 1980s. In 1985 one Lou Singer began running tours (Singer&#x27;s Brooklyn) through the most elaborately light parts of Bensonhurst, Canarsie, Bay Ridge, and Dyker Heights where one could find &quot;designer lighting&quot;. Since those initial 1980 reports, the lights of Dyker Heights have become increasingly popular with New Yorkers as newspaper articles, news programs, documentaries, and remotes were created. In 2000, Conan O&#x27;Brien filmed a remote for &quot;Late Night with Conan O&#x27;Brien&quot; in Dyker Heights. A PBS televised documentary &quot;Dyker Lights&quot; was produced in 2001 as an insight into the neighborhood with stories involving the Christmas celebration lights.

====Notable decorations====
Early on, the two most noted homes were on 84th Street, between 11th and 12th Avenues, directly across from one another. The home of Lucy Spata with her Santa theme at 1152 84th Street and that of Alfred Polizzotto with his Nutcracker motif at 1145 84th Street.

In December 1998, the Spatas&#x27; home was covered in lights, illuminated soldiers and choirboys, and other Christmas figures. The inside is decorated with 50 motorized dolls, miniature villages and many gifts. Outside Santa, played by her nephew, greets children and others who pass by.

The white mansion, owned by Alfred Polizzotto and his family, was adorned with a pair of high wooden soldiers which stood guard and wave their arms. The front lawn had rearing horses and a quartet of dancers. In 1988, Polizzotto was diagnosed with lymphoma, which was successfully treated the following year. To celebrate his triumph, Polizzotto mounted the display the following year and until his death. In 2001, Polizzotto died; however, his family continued the tradition in his honor for a few years, until stopping in 2020.

In 1996, the Casos, who moved to Dyker Heights in 1995 and have since relocated, had Midwood artist Carl Oliveri design Charles Dickens&#x27; &quot;A Christmas Carol&quot;, which included 29 life-size figures on their front lawn at 1062 84th St.

<doc id="372544" wikidata="Q737626" url="?curid=372544" title="Genrikh Altshuller">
<text>Genrikh Saulovich Altshuller (, ; 15 October 1926 – 24 September 1998) was a Soviet engineer, inventor, and writer. He is most notable for creating the Theory of Inventive Problem Solving, better known by its Russian acronym TRIZ. He founded the Azerbaijan Public Institute for Inventive Creation and was the first President of the TRIZ Association. He also wrote science fiction under the penname Genrikh Altov.

==Early life==
Altshuller was born in Tashkent, Uzbekistan (formerly the USSR) to a family of journalists of Jewish background. He moved with his family to Baku, Azerbaijan, where he spent most of his life. After graduating from high school he was admitted to the Azerbaijan Industrial Institute. Altshuller enlisted in the Army in 1944 and was trained as a fighter pilot but did not see action.

He joined the Soviet Navy at the age of twenty and attracted attention for his ability to fix engines, getting assigned to the Commission of Innovation of the Capian Navy Flotilla.

Working as a clerk in a patent office, Altshuller embarked on finding some generic rules that would explain the creation of new, inventive, patentable ideas. He eventually created the &quot;Teoriya Resheniya Izobreatatelskikh Zadach&quot; (Theory of Inventive Problem Solving or TRIZ)). In 1956 he wrote a paper with his school friend Rafael Shapiro, &quot;Psychology of inventive creativity&quot;, which was to become influential in the study of invention development.

==Arrest and imprisonment==
During Joseph Stalin&#x27;s political purges of members of the Communist Party in 1950, he and Shapiro were imprisoned for political reasons, after sending a letter to Stalin, and continued his studies with his fellow inmates while in the Vorkuta labor camp. After his release in 1954, Altshuller settled in Baku, Azerbaijan.

==The spread of TRIZ in the Soviet Union==
A full-fledged TRIZ movement developed among Soviet engineers and other technically inclined people by the 1970s, and Altshuller played the role of its intellectual leader. He lectured at TRIZ congresses, published articles and books and corresponded with various TRIZ practitioners. He became the founding member and president of the Russian TRIZ Association. A number of his close friends and students have become the most prominent thinkers and teachers of the movement, popularizing TRIZ in Russia and abroad. In 1971 he founded the Azerbaijan Public Institute of Inventive Creativity, a school which was &quot;a blend of bohemian improvisation and gearhead thinking&quot;.

For a long time he published articles on TRIZ, with examples and exercises, in the Soviet popular science magazine &quot;Izobretatel i Ratsionalizator&quot; (&quot;Inventor and Innovator&quot;). 

==After the Soviet collapse==
Altshuller left Baku in the early 1990s amidst post-Soviet-breakup violence in the area. He settled in Petrozavodsk (Karelia in north-western Russia) with his wife and granddaughter. As a result, Petrozavodsk became the center of the TRIZ Association.

He died from complications of Parkinson&#x27;s disease in 1998.

==Science fiction==
Following his release from prison camp in the 1950s, he earned a living as a science fiction writer, under the pseudonym Genrikh Altov (Генрих Альтов), often in collaboration with his wife, Valentina Zhuravleva, whom he married in 1957.

<doc id="372546" wikidata="Q525365" url="?curid=372546" title="Seaplane tender">
<text>A seaplane tender is a boat or ship that supports the operation of seaplanes. Some of these vessels, known as seaplane carriers, could not only carry seaplanes but also provided all the facilities needed for their operation; these ships are regarded by some as the first aircraft carriers and appeared just before the First World War.

==Terminology==

In maritime parlance a tender is a vessel that is used to support the operation of other vessels.

In British usage, the term tender was used for small craft, with the term depot ship being used for large seagoing vessels. Flying boats and float planes even when based at home in ports and harbour had a need for small support vessels to operate.

British tenders were small craft of launch to pinnace size. These were used to ferry crews, stores and supplies between shore and the aircraft, to maintain the buoys used to mark out &quot;taxiways&quot; and &quot;runways&quot; and to keep these clear of debris to prevent foreign object damage, and in the case of emergency to act as rescue craft and airport crash tenders. All those functions that on land would require wheeled ground support equipment had a need for a watercraft equivalent.

When deploying flying boat squadrons, bases could rapidly be established in areas lacking infrastructure by sending flying boat depot ships in addition to small craft tenders. These ships could carry out the function of barracks, workshops and control towers, i.e. those functions which in a land based airfield would be fulfilled by buildings.

== History ==

The first seaplane carrier appeared in 1911 with the French Navy &quot;La Foudre&quot;, following the invention of the seaplane in 1910 with the French Fabre Hydravion. &quot;La Foudre&quot; carried float-equipped planes under hangars on the main deck, from where they were lowered on the sea with a crane. &quot;La Foudre&quot; was further modified in November 1913 with a -long flat deck to launch her seaplanes. Another early seaplane carrier was , an old cruiser converted and commissioned with a flying-off deck in mid-1913. However, HMS &quot;Ark Royal&quot; was the first ship in history designed and built as a seaplane carrier in 1914.

===First World War===
In the Battle of Tsingtao, from 5 September 1914, the Imperial Japanese Navy seaplane carrier conducted the world&#x27;s first naval-launched air raids from Kiaochow Bay. The four Maurice Farman seaplanes bombarded German-held land targets (communication centers and command centers) and damaged a German minelayer in the Tsingtao peninsula from September 1914 until that November, when the Germans surrendered.

On Christmas Day 1914, the British carried out the Cuxhaven Raid; seaplanes carried within range of their targets attacked German naval targets in the Heligoland Bight.

These carriers had hangars for storing and maintaining the aircraft, but no flight deck as in a true aircraft carrier. Instead, they used cranes to lower the aircraft into the sea for takeoff and to recover them after landing. The ships were normally converted merchant vessels rather than specially constructed for the task. As aircraft improved, the problems of using seaplanes became more of a handicap. The aircraft could only be operated in a smooth sea and the ship had to stop for launching or recovery, both of which took around 20 minutes. The tender was often stationed or so in front of the main battle fleet with the cruiser screen so that it would not fall significantly behind when it launched its aircraft. Seaplanes also had poorer performance than other aircraft because of the drag and weight of the floats. Seaplane tenders had largely been superseded by aircraft carriers in the battle fleet by the end of the First World War, although aircraft were still of minor importance compared to the firepower of naval artillery.

The British was a seaplane tender with a flying-off deck. Seaplanes could be recovered while the ship was under way through the &quot;Hein Mat&quot;a sheet towed behind the vessel, once the aircraft was on the mat it was effectively stationary with respect to the ship and could be hoisted aboard.

In the inter-war years, it was common for cruisers and battleships to be equipped with catapult-launched reconnaissance seaplanes. A few naviesespecially those without true aircraft carriersalso acquired catapult-equipped seaplane carriers for fleet reconnaissance.

=== World War II ===

During the Second World War, both the American and the Japanese Navies built a number of seaplane tenders to supplement their aircraft carrier fleets. However, these ships often had their catapults removed, and were used as support vessels that operated seaplanes from harbours rather than in a seaway. These aircraft were generally for long-range reconnaissance patrols. The tenders allowed the aircraft to be rapidly deployed to new bases because their runways did not have to be constructed, and support facilities were mobile much like supply ships for submarines or destroyers.

Nazi Germany&#x27;s &quot;Kriegsmarine&quot;, in the Second World War, did not operate any seaplane tenders. However, the &quot;Luftwaffe&quot; had nineteen seaplane tenders. These ships were mostly converted from existing civilian seaplane tenders, and were capable of carrying 1–3 seaplanes. The French and Italian Navies also had seaplane tenders.

Seaplane carriers became obsolete at the end of the Second World War. A few remained in service after the war but by the late 1950s most had been scrapped or converted to other uses such as helicopter repair ships.

<doc id="372548" wikidata="Q2422765" url="?curid=372548" title="Motor nerve">
<text>A motor nerve, or efferent nerve, is a nerve that contains exclusively efferent nerve fibers and transmits motor signals from the central nervous system (CNS) to the muscles of the body. This is different from the motor neuron, which includes a cell body and branching of dendrites, while the nerve is made up of a bundle of axons. Motor nerves act as efferent nerves which carry information out from the CNS to muscles, as opposed to afferent nerves (also called sensory nerves), which transfer signals from sensory receptors in the periphery to the CNS. Efferent nerves can also connect to glands or other organs/issues instead of muscles (and so motor nerves are not equivalent to efferent nerves). The vast majority of nerves contain both sensory and motor fibers and are therefore called mixed nerves.

== Structure and function ==

Motor nerve fibers transduce signals from the CNS to peripheral neurons of proximal muscle tissue. Motor nerve axon terminals innervate skeletal and smooth muscle, as they are heavily involved in muscle control. Motor nerves tend to be rich in acetylcholine vesicles because the motor nerve, a bundle of motor nerve axons that deliver motor signals and signal for movement and motor control. Calcium vesicles reside in the axon terminals of the motor nerve bundles. The high calcium concentration outside of presynaptic motor nerves increases the size of end-plate potentials (EPPs).

==Protective tissues==

Within motor nerves, each axon is wrapped by the endoneurium, which is a layer of connective tissue that surrounds the myelin sheath. Bundles of axons are called fascicles, which are wrapped in perineurium. All of the fascicles wrapped in the perineurium are wound together and wrapped by a final layer of connective tissue known as the epineurium. These protective tissues defend nerves from injury, pathogens and help to maintain nerve function. Layers of connective tissue maintain the rate at which nerves conduct action potentials.

== Spinal cord exit ==
Most motor pathways originate in the motor cortex of the brain. Signals run down the brainstem and spinal cord ipsilaterally, on the same side, and exit the spinal cord at the ventral horn of the spinal cord on either side. Motor nerves communicate with the muscle cells they innervate through motor neurons once they exit the spinal cord.

== Motor nerve types ==
Motor nerves can vary based on the subtype of motor neuron they are associate with.

===Alpha===

Alpha motor neurons target extrafusal muscle fibers. The motor nerves associated with these neurons innervate extrafusal fibers and are responsible for muscle contraction. These nerve fibers have the largest diameter of the motor neurons and require the highest conduction velocity of the three types.

=== Beta ===
Beta motor neurons innervate intrafusal fibers of muscle spindles. These nerves are responsible for signaling slow twitch muscle fibers.

=== Gamma ===
Gamma motor neurons, unlike alpha motor neurons, are not directly involved in muscle contraction. The nerves associated with these neurons do not send signals that directly adjust the shortening or lengthening of muscle fibers. However, these nerves are important in keeping muscle spindles taut.

== Neurodegeneration ==
Motor neural degeneration is the progressive weakening of neural tissues and connections in the nervous system. Muscles begin to weaken as there are no longer any motor nerves or pathways that allows for muscle innervation. Motor neuron diseases can be viral, genetic or be a result of environmental factors. The exact causes remain unclear, however many experts believe that toxic and environmental factors play a large role.

== Neuroregeneration ==

There are problems with neuroregeneration due to many sources, both internal and external. There is a weak regenerative ability of nerves and new nerve cells cannot simply be made. The outside environment can also play a role in nerve regeneration. Neural stem cells (NSCs), however, are able to differentiate into many different types of nerve cells. This is one way that nerves can &quot;repair&quot; themselves. NSC transplant into damaged areas usually leads to the cells differentiating into astrocytes which assists the surrounding neurons. Schwann cells have the ability to regenerate, but the capacity that these cells can repair nerve cells declines as time goes on as well as distance the Schwann cells are from site of damage.

<text>Kathy Tyers is an American science fiction author.

Tyers, born in Long Beach, California, is a microbiology graduate and a certified K-12 teacher. She began her writing career in the early 1980s, publishing her first novel, Firebird, in 1986. She continued to write successful science fiction novels, including The Truce at Bakura, which reached the New York Times bestseller list. After taking a sabbatical from writing, Tyers returned to the field, targeting the Christian Booksellers Association. The rewritten versions of Firebird and Fusion Fire, along with a third novel, Crown of Fire, were marketed as Christian fiction. Tyers continued to contribute to the Star Wars universe with additional novels and short stories. After her husband&#x27;s death in 2004, she took another sabbatical, during which she worked on an autobiography and earned a Master of Christian Studies degree. The Firebird Saga was completed with two more novels, and Tyers remarried in 2014.

==Biography==
Kathy Tyers Gillin (née Moore) was born and raised in Long Beach, California. She obtained a degree in microbiology from Montana State University, where she met her first husband, Mark Tyers. After their marriage, she returned to school and became certified to teach grades K-12. When their church opened a private school, she took over teaching the lower grades. In 1979, she retired from teaching to start a family; her son Matthew was born in 1981, and she began writing in earnest two years later.

Tyers published her first novel, &quot;Firebird,&quot; with Bantam Spectra in 1986. She subsequently published &quot;Fusion Fire&quot; (1988; a sequel to &quot;Firebird&quot;), &quot;Crystal Witness&quot; (1989) and &quot;Shivering World&quot; (1991). During this period she also authored a nonfiction travel book and, with her husband, released two CDs of folk music, &quot;Leave Her, Johnny&quot; and &quot;The Very Best Dreams&quot; on which she played flute and Irish harp. In 1991, while working on another speculative fiction novel, she was approached with an opportunity to write a novel in the Star Wars Expanded Universe. Her novel, &quot;The Truce at Bakura&quot; (1993), reached the New York Times bestseller list.

Despite her success, after the sale of her novel, &quot;One Mind&#x27;s Eye&quot;, Tyers took a complete sabbatical from writing from 1994 to 1997. She eventually returned to writing, specifically targeting the Christian Booksellers Association in an attempt to sell Christian science fiction, and Bethany House Publishers published rewritten versions of &quot;Firebird&quot; and &quot;Fusion Fire&quot;.

The rewritten versions, published in 1999 and 2000 along with a third novel, &quot;Crown of Fire&quot;, were much more spiritual in nature and, in most markets, were marketed as Christian fiction instead of science fiction. They were published as a single volume edition in 2004. During the same period, Tyers was approached for the &quot;Star Wars&quot; market again and authored another novel, &quot;Balance Point&quot;, in addition to short stories for four &quot;Star Wars&quot; anthologies. &quot;Shivering World&quot; was revised and re-released in early 2004.

Tyers&#x27; husband, Mark, died from alcoholism in 2004. She took another sabbatical from fiction writing, working with guitarist Christopher Parkening on his autobiography &quot;Grace Like a River&quot;. In 2006, she entered Regent College in Vancouver, British Columbia, and after earning a Master of Christian Studies degree, she lived in Bellingham, Washington for a year before returning to Montana.

The three &quot;Firebird&quot; novels were re-released in an annotated version by Marcher Lord Press in 2011, followed by two additional series novels: &quot;Wind and Shadow&quot; in 2011 and &quot;Daystar&quot; in 2012, completing the &quot;Firebird&quot; Saga.

Tyers remarried in 2014 and is active in the Presbyterian (PCA) church.

<text>Walthamstow Village is the oldest part of Walthamstow, east London. It was designated a Conservation Area by the London Borough of Waltham Forest in 1967, and another Conservation Area on nearby Orford Road was subsequently added. The area centres on St. Mary&#x27;s Church, which was founded in the 12th century. Across the road from this is a 15th-century timber-framed hall house called &quot;The Ancient House&quot;, which was restored in 1934 and 2002. Nearby are almshouses dating from the 16th and 18th centuries, and the Vestry House Museum, which has been used as a workhouse and police station, but has been a museum since 1931. It also holds the archives of the borough and a local studies library.

Orford Road, the ancient road leading up to St Mary&#x27;s church, has in recent years developed as a street of small restaurants, cafes and a local supermarket. There are also several pubs in the area.

<doc id="372557" wikidata="Q806099" url="?curid=372557" title="Banana chip">
<text>A banana chip (sometimes called banana crisp) is a deep-fried or dried, generally crispy slice of banana. It is usually made from firmer, starchier banana varieties (&quot;cooking bananas&quot; or plantains) like the saba and Nendran cultivars. It can be sweet or savory and can be covered with sugar, honey, salt, or various spices.

Banana chips are the only processed banana product with significant international trade. The main exporter of banana chips worldwide is the Philippines. Export markets for banana chips are also established in Thailand and Indonesia.

==Fried==
Fried banana chips are usually produced from under-ripe banana slices deep-fried in sunflower oil or coconut oil. These chips are dry (like potato chips), contain about 4% water (table), and can be salted, spiced, sugar-coated, or jaggery-coated. Sometimes banana flavoring is added. If ripe dessert bananas are used, they come out soggy. They are used for desserts, not for dry chips.

==Dried==
Some varieties of banana chips can be produced using only food dehydration. Banana slices that are only dehydrated are not dark yellow and crunchy but rather are brown, leathery, and chewy. They are very sweet and have an intense banana flavor. These are ideally made from fully ripe bananas. Another kind is made by baking in an oven, although this process may not result in the same intense banana flavor.

==Nutrition==
Dried banana chips are 4% water, 58% carbohydrates, 34% fat, and 2% protein. In a 100-gram reference amount, dried banana chips supply 520 calories and are a rich source (20% or more of the Daily Value, DV) of magnesium (21% DV) and vitamin B6 (20% DV), with moderate amounts of iron, copper, and potassium (10% to 11% DV) (table). Other micronutrients are in negligible amounts of the Daily Value (see nutrition table).

==Uses and variations==

===Philippines===
The Philippines is, by far, the main exporter of banana chips worldwide. It exports large quantities to more than 30 countries, including the United States, Canada, the European Union, Japan, Australia, South Korea, China, and Russia. The annual revenue for banana chip exports in the Philippines was approximately $35 million in 2009. There are many variants of banana chips in the Philippines, from traditional dishes like &quot;pinasugbo&quot; to modern versions coated in cheese powder. Banana chips in the Philippines are made predominantly from saba or cardava bananas, with the latter preferred for commercial banana chips due to their larger sizes. For domestic production and home cooking, they are made directly by deep-frying fresh sliced bananas. For commercial banana chips for the export market, the main method of production is through osmotic dehydration followed by deep frying at in coconut oil for 1 minute. The resulting chips are distinctively light-colored.

===India===
Fried plantain chips, known as &#x27; or &#x27; or &#x27; in Kerala, are fried in coconut oil. Both ripe and unripe plantains are used for this type of chip preparation. The chips may be coated with masala or jaggery to form spicy and sweet variations. Plain banana and plantain chips are called &#x27; and &#x27;, respectively; sweet jaggery-banana chips are called &#x27; or &quot;&quot;. is more expensive than . It is an integral part of the traditional Kerala meal called served during weddings and festivals, such as Onam.

===Indonesia===

Banana is a native plant of Maritime Southeast Asia and the people of the archipelago have developed many uses of it for ages, including as a snack. In Indonesia, banana chip is called &quot;kripik pisang&quot;, and is considered a variant of crispy &quot;kripik&quot; (traditional chip or crisp). &quot;Kripik pisang&quot; is a popular crispy snack and can be commonly found in Indonesia, although it seems to be more prevalent in Java and Sumatra. In North Maluku, popular with &quot;pisang mulu bebek&quot; is a duck mouth-shaped banana chip. It is served with sambal, fried peanut, and fried anchovy. In Lampung, banana chips is combined with chocolate powder called &quot;kripik pisang coklat&quot;.

Usually unripe green bananas are thinly sliced, soaked in lime and salt water solution, and deep fried as chips. Unripe banana is well suited for deep frying due to its low content of water and sugar while having high starch content. &quot;Pisang goreng&quot; is another fried banana snack, although it is not thinly sliced and serves as a sweet hot snack.

===Americas===

The chips are often part of muesli and nut mixes. Other chips, such as patacones, are salty.
Similar chips called chifle are made from plantains, the family of fruit that bananas come from. In tropical American cultures, all bananas are considered plantains, but not all plantains are bananas. These deep-fried plantain chips are also quite popular in the southeastern part of Mexico, especially in the state of Tabasco.

<text>The Worshipful Company of [[Armourer]]s and [[brass|Brasiers]] is one of the livery companies of the City of London. The Armourers&#x27; Guild was established in 1322; it received a royal charter in 1453. Other companies, including the Armour Repairers, merged with the Armourers. In 1708, brass workers joined the company, which was renamed as the Armourers&#x27; and Brasiers&#x27; Company. The company does support the metallurgy industry, but does not retain a close association with its original trade, as is the case with a majority of livery companies. It exists primarily as a charitable establishment.
The company is based at Armourers&#x27; Hall, situated on the corner of Coleman Street and London Wall, and has occupied this same site since 1346. The hall was one of the very few to escape destruction in the Great Fire of London in 1666. In 1795, the hall was enlarged, but it was decided in 1839 to rebuild it completely. The lantern, or dome, of the livery hall was added in 1872. On 29 December 1940, during a major blitz on London, the surrounding area was devastated, but again the hall survived.

The Armourers&#x27; and Brasiers&#x27; Company ranks twenty-second in the order of precedence of livery companies. The company&#x27;s motto is &quot;We Are One&quot;.

<doc id="372569" wikidata="Q8037094" url="?curid=372569" title="Worshipful Company of Wax Chandlers">
<text>The Worshipful Company of Wax Chandlers is one of the oldest livery companies of the City of London, with one of the smallest memberships (about 120).

The Wax Chandlers&#x27; Company, ranked 20th in the City Livery Company order of precedence, has an association with the Church of St Vedast alias Foster in nearby Foster Lane.

==History==
Established before 1330 (when it was recorded as being invited to contribute funds to King Edward III) and possibly before 1199 (from when there is some documentary evidence, relating to a property in Aldersgate Street, of its existence as a body), the company received further Byelaws and Ordinances from Lord Mayor John Stodeye in 1358. New Ordinances were issued in 1371 and the company was granted a Royal Charter in 1484 – one of only three known Royal Charters of King Richard III, the others being for the College of Arms and for the incorporation as a county borough of the city of Gloucester. The Company remains governed under its 1663 Royal Charter of King Charles II and corresponding Ordinances of 1664.

Wax chandlers (or merchants in beeswax products) traded separately from Tallow Chandlers; beeswax candles, being expensive, were usually reserved for churches and the households of royalty and nobility, while tallow candles were generally used in ordinary homes. In recent years, in February, the two companies have celebrated the Feast of Candlemas together.

==Company today==
As with many City Livery Companies today, the Wax Chandlers&#x27; Company no longer operates primarily as a trade association. Its role has evolved into being a civic, ceremonial, educational and charitable institution. Like other livery companies, it takes an active role in supporting the corporate governance of the City of London and the Lord Mayor.

Examples of its charitable giving are its affiliation with Armed Forces units (HMS Protector, 5 Rifles and RAF Coningsby), the donation of candles to St Paul&#x27;s Cathedral (every Holy Cross Day in September), support to those in need throughout the City and Greater London (particularly in the London Borough of Bexley), patronage of the National Honey Show and the British Beekeepers Association.

==Wax Chandlers&#x27; Hall==
The Company has maintained a Hall on the same site (6 Gresham Street, London) since 1501. The Wax Chandlers&#x27; current premises, their sixth, were substantially rebuilt in 1954 after damage during World War II. Recently refurbished, the Hall is popular for hire on corporate or social occasions. Wax Chandlers&#x27; Hall can sometimes be viewed by the general public during the annual London Open House Weekend or by prior arrangement. The Company owns other property on Fleet Street in London.

==Membership==
The Wax Chandlers&#x27; membership comprises Liverymen and Freemen (who initially join the Company by servitude (as Apprentices), by patrimony, or by redemption). 
The Company is governed by the Master Wax Chandler, Wardens (&quot;Upper Warden&quot; and &quot;Renter Warden&quot;) and a Court of Assistants. Election Court each June determines appointments to senior office, with ceremonial installation on or around the Feast of the Transfiguration, in the first week of August.
The Company has supplied five Lord Mayors of London since the 18th Century, including two in the 21st: Sir Gavyn Arthur and Dame Fiona Woolf DBE.
The Company is administered by the Clerk and day-to-day management of the Hall is overseen by the Beadle.

The Company&#x27;s current membership includes: 
*The Rt Rev &amp; Rt Hon The Lord Williams of Oystermouth (former Archbishop of Canterbury)
*Dame Fiona Woolf DBE (686th Lord Mayor of London, former President of the Law Society of England and Wales)

==Arms==

The Company received a Grant of Arms from Sir Thomas Holme, Clarenceux King of Arms, on 3 February 1485, the year following the College of Arms&#x27; foundation; the Charter of foundation of the College of Arms and that incorporating the city of Gloucester are the only known Charters of Richard III other than that which established the Wax Chandlers&#x27; Company. There were minor changes (grant of supporters and their modification), but not to the escutcheon or crest, in 1530 and 1536. 
The Company’s extant armorial bearings, as confirmed in the Visitation of London in 1630, are blazoned:

*Shield: Azure on a Chevron Argent three Roses Gules seeded Or between three Mortars royal Or. (A &quot;mortar&quot; is a type of candle-holder, similar to the mortar of a pestle-and-mortar; a mortar &quot;royal&quot; is particularly splendid.)
*Crest: On a wreath Or and Gules a Maiden vested in a Surcoat of Cloth of Or furred with Ermine, kneeling among divers Flowers Proper and making thereof a Garland. 
*Mantling: Azure doubled Ermine. 
*Supporters (granted in 1530, modified in 1536, but reverting to the 1530 version in 1630): On either side a Unicorn Argent gorged with a Garland of various Flowers Proper, the Horn wreathed Or and Gules.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Tallow Chandlers is one of the ancient livery companies of the City of London. The organisation, which engaged not only in tallow candle making but also in the trade of oils, first received a royal charter in 1462.

Traditionally tallow chandlers operated separately from wax chandlers: beeswax candles customarily being used in churches and noble houses, while tallow (animal fat) candles were generally used in other homes. As is the case with most other livery companies, the Tallow Chandlers&#x27; Company is no longer a trade association of candlemakers, its decline precipitated by the advent of electric lighting. The company now exists as a charitable institution and supports education in oil-related fields.

The company ranks 21st in the Precedence of Livery Companies in the City of London. Its motto is &quot;Ecce Agnus Dei, Ecce Qui Tollit Peccata Mundi&quot;: Latin for &quot;Behold the Lamb of God, Who Takes Away the Sins of the World&quot;, words of St John the Baptist (Patron Saint of the Company) in reference to Jesus.

<text>Blackfriars (), also known as London Blackfriars, is a central London railway station and connected London Underground station in the City of London. It provides Thameslink services: local (from North to South London), and regional (Bedford and Cambridge to Brighton) and limited Southeastern commuter services to South East London and Kent. Its platforms span the River Thames, the only station in London to do so, along the length of Blackfriars Railway Bridge, a short distance downstream from Blackfriars Bridge. There are two station entrances – one on each side of the Thames – along with a connection to the London Underground District and Circle lines.

The main line station was opened by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway with the name &quot;St. Paul&#x27;s&quot; in 1886, as a replacement for the earlier Blackfriars Bridge station (now the present station&#x27;s southern entrance) and the earlier Blackfriars railway bridge. This increased capacity of rail traffic through the Snow Hill tunnel to the rest of the rail network. The Underground station opened in 1870 with the arrival of the Metropolitan District Railway. The station was renamed &quot;Blackfriars&quot; in 1937 to avoid confusion with St Paul&#x27;s tube station. It was rebuilt in the 1970s, which included the addition of office space above the station and the closure of the original railway bridge, which was demolished in 1985.

In 2009, the station underwent major refurbishments to improve capacity, which included the extension of the platforms across the railway bridge and a new station entrance on the South Bank. The underground station was rebuilt at the same time, and work was completed in 2012. The nearest museum is the Tate Modern which is 550 yards (0.5 km) from the station.

== Location ==
Blackfriars station serves Thameslink rail services that connect suburbs with central London. It straddles the River Thames, running across the length of Blackfriars Railway Bridge parallel to the A201 Blackfriars Bridge. For this reason, it is partly in the City of London and partly in the London Borough of Southwark. The north bank entrance is on the south side of Queen Victoria Street and the south bank entrance, opened in 2011, is adjacent to Blackfriars Road.

The station falls within fare zone 1. The station is run by Thameslink, with Transport for London handling the underground platforms. A Thameslink driver depot is in the station building. The adjacent Blackfriars Millennium Pier provides river services to Putney and Canary Wharf.

London Buses routes 4, 40, 63 and night routes N63 and N89 serve the station.

== History ==
=== London, Chatham and Dover Railway ===

The station was proposed by the London, Chatham and Dover Railway (LC&amp;DR), who had been given parliamentary power to build a line into the City of London. The company wanted to compete with rivals, the South Eastern Railway, and provide the best service into Central London. The line was complete as far as the Thames by 1864; the LC&amp;DR opened Blackfriars Bridge station on 1 June, which sat on the south bank adjacent to Blackfriars Road. The station was constructed on two levels, with a goods depot at street level and passenger facilities level with the bridge. An underground station at Blackfriars north of the river was opened by the Metropolitan District Railway in 1870, before any mainline stations.

The railway bridge across the Thames was delayed because the City&#x27;s municipal body, the Corporation of London, was unsure as to what it should look like and how many arches there should be. The station was designed by Joseph Cubitt and had a long roof with walls that stretched up to the riverbank. Cubitt subsequently designed the original bridge, which carried four tracks on a lattice girder bridge, supported by sets of stone piers supporting iron columns. Services began across the bridge on 21 December 1864. Upon completion, trains ended at a temporary terminal, replaced by on 1 June 1865. A further station, , opened on 2 March 1874 and the LC&amp;DR line ran via the Snow Hill tunnel to a connection to the Metropolitan Railway near , then on to King&#x27;s Cross and stations.

The mainline Blackfriars station was opened by the LC&amp;DR as St. Paul&#x27;s railway station on 10 May 1886 when the company opened the St. Paul&#x27;s Railway Bridge across the Thames. The new bridge and station were built as a supplement to, rather than a replacement for, the first bridge because of increasing railway traffic. The joint engineers for the works were William Mills of the London, Chatham, and Dover Company, and Messrs. John Wolfe Barry and Henry Marc Brunel. Edward Cruttwell was the resident engineer in charge of construction. The bridge was constructed parallel to the 1864 Blackfriars Railway Bridge, carrying seven tracks across five arched spans between and high. It widened past the bridge to the terminus on the south side of Queen Victoria Street. The original station was a small and cheaply designed pink-red brick building, as the LC&amp;DR had financial difficulties throughout its lifetime attempting to drive a railway through Central London. The station&#x27;s frontage backed onto the District Railway, making cab access and a forecourt impossible owing to lack of space. It did, however, allow St Paul&#x27;s a direct interchange with the rest of the underground, unlike all the other LC&amp;DR stations. On 13 November 1886, a direct connection was made between the mainline and underground stations.

After the opening of St. Paul&#x27;s station, the earlier Blackfriars Bridge station was closed to passengers but remained as a goods station until 1965. Most mainline trains called at St Paul&#x27;s, including those stopping at Holborn Viaduct. Local commuters continued to use Ludgate Hill where possible, as it was closer to where they were going, but it did not have sufficient capacity.

=== Southern Railway and Southern Region ===

St. Paul&#x27;s station was renamed by the Southern Railway as Blackfriars on 1 February 1937. This was partly done to avoid confusion after the London Passenger Transport Board renamed Post Office tube station on the Central line to St Paul&#x27;s, and partly so that the mainline and underground stations would have the same name. It suffered significant bomb damage during World War II. Overnight on 16–17 April 1941, the signalbox on the south side of the bridge was destroyed, along with a bridge over Southwark Street. Seven flagmen were caught in the blast, with three being killed outright, another three dying in hospital from burns and just one surviving after a long recovery in hospital. The signals were not fully restored until 11 August 1946, after the war.
After the creation of British Railways in 1948, the station was managed by the Southern Region. Gradually, the structure of the original Blackfriars Railway Bridge deteriorated until it was unsound. In 1961, two tracks were removed from the bridge to ease its load. The station had little investment and still supported some of the original architecture and design up to the 1960s. By this time, services were reduced to a handful of commuter services. The original Blackfriars Bridge station, which had remained as a goods depot, was demolished in 1964. The bridge was closed to trains on 27 June 1971 and the deck was removed in 1985, and only the piers in the river and the orange bridge abutments remain.

The station began to be rebuilt along with the Underground station in 1971, which included an additional of office space. Reconstruction was problematic, as the original station building had sat on top of a cold store, which had frozen the ground below it. The District line tunnel had to be removed and replaced with a new supporting structure that could accommodate the redesigned station building. The work was formally reopened on 30 November 1977 by the Lord Mayor of London, Peter Vanneck (though the station had never actually closed). A part of the stonework elevation from the 1886 LC&amp;DR station has been preserved at platform level in the main line station indicating many destinations in the south-east of England and in Europe.

=== Station rebuild ===

Blackfriars station was significantly renovated between 2009 and 2012 in a £500 million redevelopment programme to modernise the station and increase capacity. The terminal platforms at the station were closed on 20 March 2009 in order for work to begin. The original concept for the project was designed by Pascall+Watson architects, with execution by Jacobs and Tony Gee and Partners; it was built by Balfour Beatty. The office building above the station was demolished and replaced as part of the Thameslink programme. The new station is the same height and has a combined National Rail and London Underground ticket hall and ventilation shaft together with escalators and lifts between a mezzanine level for main line railway services and the sub-surface level for London Underground services. The Underground station also received major enhancements, with a new roof of glazed north lights and partial-height glazed side panels installed along the entire length of the bridge.
On the south bank of the river a new station entrance was built at Bankside, containing a second ticket hall. The through platforms were moved to the east side and extended along Blackfriars Railway Bridge to accommodate 12-carriage trains (in place of the previous eight). The layout has been altered by building new bay platforms on the west side, avoiding the need for through trains between City Thameslink and London Bridge crossing the paths of terminating ones.
The works exploited the disused piers west of the existing railway bridge which once supported the former West Blackfriars and St. Paul&#x27;s Railway Bridge. The easternmost row of disused piers was strengthened, tied into the existing bridge and clad in stone. The longer platforms allow longer trains on the Thameslink route to pass through London. Thameslink services began using the newly constructed platforms in early 2011. The station&#x27;s new entrance and ticket hall on the south side of the river opened on 5 December. The tube station reopened on 20 February 2012. The Mayor of London, Boris Johnson, visited the works on the same day, saying &quot;the rebirth of this central London station will improve the journeys of thousands of passengers every single day&quot;. The reconstruction work provided jobs for around 13,000 people, with a peak of 2,000 per day at the busiest times. The Thameslink redevelopment work at Blackfriars has been well received. In January 2014 the Blackfriars Railway Bridge became the world&#x27;s largest solar-powered bridge having been covered with 4,400 photovoltaic panels providing up to half of the energy for the station. In 2017, the station won a Major Station of the Year award at the National Rail Awards.

The Waterloo &amp; City line, a deep-level tube line which runs non-stop between and Bank, runs almost directly under Blackfriars station and there have been suggestions to construct an interchange station for the line at Blackfriars. The Department for Transport considers this to have &quot;no significant transport benefit&quot;.

== Accidents ==
*On 19 May 1938, a SECR B1 class locomotive was derailed, causing several hours disruption at the station.
*On 2 January 2014, a train&#x27;s pantograph struck the roof of the station due to a technical fault. The accident involving a First Capital Connect service from to did not result in any injuries but caused delays of around 45 minutes.

== Services ==

Blackfriars main-line station is served by through services on the Thameslink route operated by Thameslink and Southeastern. This includes trains from , and to the north, and , Sutton and to the south. Southbound trains run via or ; northbound trains next call at . Before March 2009 some services from the south terminated at three bay platforms, which were then removed during renovation works. Two new bay platforms opened in May 2012 and are used during peak hours and at weekends.

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 4 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via and Gatwick Airport
* 2 tph to Three Bridges via Redhill
* 2 tph to via , , and 
* 2 tph to via and 
* 4 tph to (2 of these run via and 2 run via )
* 4 tph to (all stations)
* 2 tph to (all stations except , and )
* 4 tph to (semi-fast)
* 2 tph to via 
* 2 tph to via Stevenage

The station is also served by a small number of Southeastern services to Beckenham Junction and Dartford.

Although many services are Thameslink through trains, Blackfriars is considered a central London terminus and tickets marked &#x27;London Terminals&#x27; are valid to use when travelling to/from the south. Tickets marked &#x27;London Thameslink&#x27; can be used in both directions.
== Blackfriars Underground station ==

Blackfriars Underground station is served by the Circle and District lines and is between and stations. The underground station pre-dates the mainline one and was opened on 30 May 1870 by the Metropolitan District Railway (MDR) as the railway&#x27;s new eastern terminus when the line was extended from Westminster. The MDR had been created as a new company to complete the Circle line, which would split the budget from the District and Metropolitan Railways. The construction of the new section of the MDR was planned in conjunction with the building of the Victoria Embankment and was achieved by the cut and cover method of roofing over a shallow trench. On 3 July 1871 the MDR was extended eastwards to a new terminus at Mansion House. The Circle line ran over the same route, but its completion was delayed following arguments between the District and Metropolitan Railways and did not open until 6 October 1884.

The underground station was closed on 2 March 2009 for major renovation work and reopened on 20 February 2012. This involved demolishing the National Rail building and merging its ticket hall with the Underground&#x27;s.

<text>Ealing Broadway is a major single-level interchange station located in Ealing, in the London Borough of Ealing, West London for London Underground services and also Elizabeth line services on the National Rail Great Western Main Line.

On the Underground, it is one of three western termini of the District line, the preceding station being , and it is also one of two western termini of the Central line, the preceding station being . On the National Rail network, it is a through-station on the Great Western Main Line, down the line from , between and .

The station is managed by the Elizabeth line and saw a major upgrade and expansion as part of the Crossrail project, with a rebuilt ticket hall and the provision of step-free access.

==History==
The Great Western Railway (GWR) opened its pioneering broad gauge tracks through Ealing Broadway between and on 6 April 1838, although Ealing Broadway station did not open until 1 December of that year. As the only station in the area when it opened, it was initially named &#x27;Ealing&#x27;, but was renamed Ealing Broadway in 1875.

District Railway (DR, now the District Line) services commenced on 1 July 1879, when the DR opened a branch from on its line. The DR built its own three-platform station (including a siding) to the north of the GWR one. However, following the installation of a connection between the two railways to the east of the stations, DR trains also served the GWR station from 1 March 1883 to 30 September 1885, on a short-lived service running to station, which quickly became unprofitable. It was also intended to use the connection for a service to station (via ), but this was never introduced.

Following electrification of the main District line route through to in 1903, the section to Ealing Broadway was electrified in 1905, and the first electric trains ran to Ealing Broadway on 1 July 1905. The original brick-built DR station was replaced with a stone-faced building in 1910.

Prior to World War I, plans were made by the GWR to construct a new, mainly freight, line between Ealing and Shepherd&#x27;s Bush, to connect west-to-south with the West London Railway. The Central London Railway (CLR, now the Central Line) would use the line by extending its tracks the short distance north from its terminus at Wood Lane (now closed), to meet the new GWR tracks. CLR services to two new platforms at Ealing Broadway, built between the GWR and DR stations, started on 3 August 1920, with, initially, just one intermediate stop at . The line also carried GWR steam freight trains until 1938, when the links at Ealing Broadway and west of were removed, and the line was fully transferred to London Underground.

Originally separate companies, by 1920 the DR and the CLR were both owned by the Underground Electric Railways Company of London (UERL). Despite this, the CLR services operated via the GWR station building, not the Underground one.

The GWR-built station was demolished in 1961 and replaced by a low concrete structure containing shops and a ticket hall, opened in 1965, with a high-rise office building above. The new station building serves all the lines, and the separate District Line station ticket hall was closed, although the building remains, and the original station facade is now the entrance for multiple shops.

On Platform 9 (District line) there are some roundels of a style dating from , three of which are replicas made in 1992.

In the mid 1990s, the Great Western Main Line through the station was electrified as part of the Heathrow Express project.

In the early 1990s, the Crossrail project was proposed to serve Ealing Broadway. After many years of planning, the project was approved in 2007. An interim TfL Rail service between suburban stations and London Paddington began in 2018, transferring to the Elizabeth line on 24 May 2022.

===Accidents and incidents===
*On 16 November 1937, a steam railcar overran signals and crashed into the signal box.
*On 19 December 1973, an express passenger train was derailed when an unsecured inspection door on the locomotive hauling it struck point rodding, causing a set of points to move under the train. Ten people were killed, 94 were injured. 
*On 19 July 2000, a Real IRA bomb was planted near tracks in the station. It was discovered and destroyed by police under a controlled explosion.
*On 2 March 2016, a District Line train derailed just outside the station due to a set of points set incorrectly. There were no injuries.

==Modern station==
===Layout===
The combined station has nine platforms:
* Two National Rail platforms (1 and 2). These are only used by Great Western Railway (GWR) trains between Didcot Parkway and London Paddington, except during engineering works or a disruption.
* Two Elizabeth line platforms (3 and 4). Platforms 1, 2, 3 and 4 all are mostly in the open, but have small canopies and shelters. These platforms can be used by GWR too.
* Two Central line (5 and 6), which have a shared awning canopy.
* Three District Line (7 to 9). District Line platforms 8 and 9 are partially covered by a short canopy, and retain one original example and a number of replicas of early solid-disc Underground signs, used before Edward Johnston designed the familiar roundel in 1919.

All platforms are accessed through a gateline of ticket barriers.

===Crossrail upgrades ===
As part of the Crossrail project, the station was upgraded and expanded to meet increased passenger numbers, improve the interchange between various rail and local bus services and provide step free access.

Initially, only minor station improvements were planned as part of the Crossrail project, such as platform lengthening. However, after local and regional campaigning, the station was upgraded and step free access provided. After further criticism by local people of poor design, the station entrance was redesigned with a large glass frontage and a long curved canopy to the street.

Designed by Bennetts Associates, the station upgrade has involved demolishing the old cramped ticket hall and staircases, replacing them with:

* A new double height ticket hall, twice as large as the previous ticket hall.
* Improved and enlarged public realm outside the station with new paving, seating and street trees.
* Step free access from street to platform via new lifts, making the station fully accessible.
* Refurbishment and upgrade of existing platforms, including new signage, waiting rooms and customer information screens.
* Platform extensions to accommodate the longer Class 345 trains used by Crossrail.
* New footbridge at the eastern end of the station linking platforms 1–4.

After several periods of delay, construction on the upgrade began in 2018 by Network Rail. On 27 May 2021, the majority of the new station facilities, including the station building and ticket office, were completed and opened to the public.

===Proposed developments===
In the early 2010s, the West London Business group backed a Surbiton-to-Brent Cross light metro tube line, called the West London Orbital underground railway, based on Copenhagen Metro technology, which would include a station underground at Ealing Broadway. The London Borough of Ealing does not support the proposal, saying &quot;no consensus to progress this project [due] to extremely high costs&quot;.

In 2008, the London Group of the Campaign for Better Transport published a plan for an off-road orbital North and West London Light railway (NWLLR), sharing the Dudding Hill Line freight corridor, and using the middle two of the six track beds at North Acton. In April 2009 Ealing Council voted to call on Transport for London to look into the proposal.

The station would have been served by the West London Tram, however this proposal was cancelled in 2007 as it was opposed by the councils of all three London Boroughs that would have been served by the line.

==Services==

Ealing Broadway is served by a mixture of National Rail and London Underground services. National Rail services are operated by the Elizabeth line and London Underground services are provided by the District and Central lines.

Services at the station are as follows.

===Elizabeth line===
As of the May 2023 timetable, the typical Monday to Friday off-peak service is:
*4 tph (trains per hour) westbound to Heathrow Terminal 4
*2 tph westbound to Heathrow Terminal 5 
*2 tph westbound to Reading
*2 tph westbound to Maidenhead
*2 tph eastbound to Shenfield
*8 tph eastbound to Abbey Wood 

Elizabeth line services are operated using EMUs.

===London Underground===

The typical off-peak service in trains per hour is:
* 9 tph to Newbury Park of which 6 continue to Hainault (Central line)
* 6 tph to via Earl&#x27;s Court (District line)

The Central line also operates a night service on Friday and Saturday nights as part of the Night Tube. The station is served by a train every 20 minutes to Hainault and from Loughton.

<text>Rayners Lane is a London Underground station in the district of Rayners Lane in north west London, amid a 1930s development originally named Harrow Garden Village. The station is on the Uxbridge branch of both the Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines. On the Metropolitan line, the station is between Eastcote and West Harrow stations. On the Piccadilly line, it is between Eastcote and South Harrow stations. The station is located to the west of the junction of Rayners Lane, Alexandra Avenue and Imperial Drive (A4090). It is in Travelcard Zone 5. 

Just east of the station, the Metropolitan and Piccadilly lines tracks join for westbound services to Uxbridge and separate for eastbound services towards Central London.

==History==
The Metropolitan Railway (Harrow and Uxbridge Railway) constructed the line between Harrow on the Hill and Uxbridge and commenced services on 4 July 1904 with, initially, Ruislip being the only intermediate stop. At first, services were operated by steam trains, but track electrification was completed in the subsequent months and electric trains began operating on 1 January 1905.

Progressive development in the north Middlesex area over the next two decades led to the gradual opening of additional stations along the Uxbridge branch to encourage the growth of new residential areas. Rayners Lane opened as &quot;Rayners Lane Halt&quot; on 26 May 1906, and was named after a local farmer called Daniel Rayner. It was nicknamed &quot;Pneumonia Junction&quot; because of its exposed location.

On 1 March 1910, an extension of the District line was opened from South Harrow to connect with the Metropolitan Railway at Rayners Lane junction east of the station enabling District line trains to serve stations between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge from that date. On 23 October 1933, District line services were replaced by Piccadilly line trains.

==Design==
The station, more a halt, was rebuilt, following the start of house building in the locality in the 1930s that saw passenger figures rise from 22,000 per annum in 1930 to 4 million in 1937 by a new station to a design by Charles Holden and Reginald Uren that opened on 8 August 1938. Work had started in earnest with the opening of a temporary timber booking hall and shops on 14 March 1935 allowing work on the new station to proceed. The station, now Grade II Listed by Historic England, features the large cube-shaped brick and glass ticket hall capped with a flat reinforced concrete roof and geometrical forms typical of the new stations built in this period. To the west of the station, there is a reversing siding between the running tracks and, during the day, half of the Piccadilly line service reverses here. Two sidings were located south of the station but these were no longer used: with no connection with the running lines. In late 2017 these sidings were lifted.

==Services==

===Metropolitan line=== 
The Metropolitan Line is the only line in the network to operate an express service, though currently for Metropolitan Line trains on the Uxbridge branch this is eastbound only in the morning peaks (06:30 to 09:30) Monday to Friday.

Metropolitan Line trains are able to terminate at Rayners Lane from the westbound platform either by a crossover to the east of the station or via a centre reversing siding to the west, under normal circumstances all westbound Metropolitan Line trains continue to the terminus of the branch at Uxbridge.

The off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
* 8tph Eastbound to Aldgate (all stations)
* 8tph Westbound to Uxbridge

The morning peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
* 2tph Eastbound to Aldgate (semi-fast, running non-stop between Harrow-on-the-Hill and Wembley Park)
* 4tph Eastbound to Aldgate (all stations)
* 4tph Eastbound to Baker Street (all stations)
* 10tph Westbound to Uxbridge

The evening peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
* 7tph Eastbound to Aldgate (all stations)
* 3tph Eastbound to Baker Street (all stations)
* 10tph Westbound to Uxbridge

===Piccadilly line=== 
Piccadilly line trains are also able to terminate here by means of a crossover to the east of the station (separate from the Metropolitan Line crossover) and via the centre reversing siding although only the latter is used in normal service.

Between Rayners Lane and Uxbridge there is no Piccadilly Line service before approximately 06:30 (Monday - Friday) and 08:45 (Saturday - Sunday), except for one early morning
departure from Uxbridge at 05:18 (Monday - Saturday) and 06:46 (Sunday).

The off-peak service in trains per hour (tph) is:
* 6tph Eastbound to Cockfosters
* 3tph Westbound to Uxbridge
* 3tph Terminate Here

The peak time service in trains per hour (tph) is:
* 12tph Eastbound to Cockfosters
* 8tph Westbound to Uxbridge
* 4tph Terminate Here

==Connections==
London Buses routes 398, H9, H10 and H12 serve the station.

<doc id="372603" wikidata="Q162714" url="?curid=372603" title="Credit risk">
<text>Credit risk is the chance that a borrower does not repay a loan or fulfill a loan obligation. For lenders the risk includes late or lost interest and principal payment, leading to disrupted cash flows and increased collection costs. The loss may be complete or partial. In an efficient market, higher levels of credit risk will be associated with higher borrowing costs. Because of this, measures of borrowing costs such as yield spreads can be used to infer credit risk levels based on assessments by market participants.

Losses can arise in a number of circumstances, for example:

* A consumer may fail to make a payment due on a mortgage loan, credit card, line of credit, or other loan.
* A company is unable to repay asset-secured fixed or floating charge debt.
* A business or consumer does not pay a trade invoice when due.
* A business does not pay an employee&#x27;s earned wages when due.
* A business or government bond issuer does not make a payment on a coupon or principal payment when due.
* An insolvent insurance company does not pay a policy obligation.
* An insolvent bank will not return funds to a depositor.
* A government grants bankruptcy protection to an insolvent consumer or business.

To reduce the lender&#x27;s credit risk, the lender may perform a credit check on the prospective borrower, may require the borrower to take out appropriate insurance, such as mortgage insurance, or seek security over some assets of the borrower or a guarantee from a third party. The lender can also take out insurance against the risk or on-sell the debt to another company. In general, the higher the risk, the higher will be the interest rate that the debtor will be asked to pay on the debt. Credit risk mainly arises when borrowers are unable or unwilling to pay.

== Types ==
A credit risk can be of the following types:

* Credit default risk – The risk of loss arising from a debtor being unlikely to pay its loan obligations in full or the debtor is more than 90 days past due on any material credit obligation; default risk may impact all credit-sensitive transactions, including loans, securities and derivatives.
* Concentration risk – The risk associated with any single exposure or group of exposures with the potential to produce large enough losses to threaten a bank&#x27;s core operations. It may arise in the form of single-name concentration or industry concentration.
* Country risk – The risk of loss arising from a sovereign state freezing foreign currency payments (transfer/conversion risk) or when it defaults on its obligations (sovereign risk); this type of risk is prominently associated with the country&#x27;s macroeconomic performance and its political stability.

== Assessment ==

Significant resources and sophisticated programs are used to analyze and manage risk. Some companies run a credit risk department whose job is to assess the financial health of their customers, and extend credit (or not) accordingly. They may use in-house programs to advise on avoiding, reducing and transferring risk. They also use the third party provided intelligence. Nationally recognized statistical rating organizations provide such information for a fee.

For large companies with liquidly traded corporate bonds or Credit Default Swaps, bond yield spreads and credit default swap spreads indicate market participants assessments of credit risk and may be used as a reference point to price loans or trigger collateral calls.

Most lenders employ their models (credit scorecards) to rank potential and existing customers according to risk, and then apply appropriate strategies. With products such as unsecured personal loans or mortgages, lenders charge a higher price for higher-risk customers and vice versa. With revolving products such as credit cards and overdrafts, the risk is controlled through the setting of credit limits. Some products also require collateral, usually an asset that is pledged to secure the repayment of the loan.

Credit scoring models also form part of the framework used by banks or lending institutions to grant credit to clients. For corporate and commercial borrowers, these models generally have qualitative and quantitative sections outlining various aspects of the risk including, but not limited to, operating experience, management expertise, asset quality, and leverage and liquidity ratios, respectively. Once this information has been fully reviewed by credit officers and credit committees, the lender provides the funds subject to the terms and conditions presented within the contract (as outlined above).

=== Sovereign risk ===
Sovereign credit risk is the risk of a government being unwilling or unable to meet its loan obligations, or reneging on loans it guarantees. Many countries have faced sovereign risk in the late-2000s global recession. The existence of such risk means that creditors should take a two-stage decision process when deciding to lend to a firm based in a foreign country. Firstly one should consider the sovereign risk quality of the country and then consider the firm&#x27;s credit quality.

Five macroeconomic variables that affect the probability of sovereign debt rescheduling are:

* Debt service ratio
* Import ratio
* Investment ratio
* Variance of export revenue
* Domestic money supply growth

The probability of rescheduling is an increasing function of debt service ratio, import ratio, the variance of export revenue and domestic money supply growth. The likelihood of rescheduling is a decreasing function of investment ratio due to future economic productivity gains. Debt rescheduling likelihood can increase if the investment ratio rises as the foreign country could become less dependent on its external creditors and so be less concerned about receiving credit from these countries/investors.

=== Counterparty risk ===
A counterparty risk, also known as a settlement risk or counterparty credit risk (CCR), is a risk that a counterparty will not pay as obligated on a bond, derivative, insurance policy, or other contract. 
Financial institutions or other transaction counterparties may hedge or take out credit insurance or, particularly in the context of derivatives, require the posting of collateral. 
Offsetting counterparty risk is not always possible, e.g. because of temporary liquidity issues or longer-term systemic reasons. 
Further, counterparty risk increases due to positively correlated risk factors; accounting for this correlation between portfolio risk factors and counterparty default in risk management methodology is not trivial.

The capital requirement here is calculated using SA-CCR, the standardized approach for counterparty credit risk. This framework replaced both non-internal model approaches - Current Exposure Method (CEM) and Standardised Method (SM). 

== Mitigation ==
Lenders mitigate credit risk in a number of ways, including:

* Risk-based pricing – Lenders may charge a higher interest rate to borrowers who are more likely to default, a practice called risk-based pricing. Lenders consider factors relating to the loan such as loan purpose, credit rating, and loan-to-value ratio and estimates the effect on yield (credit spread).
* Covenants – Lenders may write stipulations on the borrower, called covenants, into loan agreements, such as:
** Periodically report its financial condition,
** Refrain from paying dividends, repurchasing shares, borrowing further, or other specific, voluntary actions that negatively affect the company&#x27;s financial position, and
** Repay the loan in full, at the lender&#x27;s request, in certain events such as changes in the borrower&#x27;s debt-to-equity ratio or interest coverage ratio.
* Credit insurance and credit derivatives – Lenders and bond holders may hedge their credit risk by purchasing credit insurance or credit derivatives. These contracts transfer the risk from the lender to the seller (insurer) in exchange for payment. The most common credit derivative is the credit default swap.
* Tightening – Lenders can reduce credit risk by reducing the amount of credit extended, either in total or to certain borrowers. For example, a distributor selling its products to a troubled retailer may attempt to lessen credit risk by reducing payment terms from &quot;net 30 &quot; to &quot;net 15&quot;.
* Diversification – Lenders to a small number of borrowers (or kinds of borrower) face a high degree of unsystematic credit risk, called concentration risk. Lenders reduce this risk by diversifying the borrower pool.
* Deposit insurance – Governments may establish deposit insurance to guarantee bank deposits in the event of insolvency and to encourage consumers to hold their savings in the banking system instead of in cash.

<doc id="372605" wikidata="Q111180987" url="?curid=372605" title="Spanish America">
<text>Spanish America refers to the Spanish territories in the Americas during the Spanish colonization of the Americas. The term &quot;Spanish America&quot; was specifically used during the territories&#x27; imperial era between 15th and 19th centuries. To the end of its imperial rule, Spain called its overseas possessions in the Americas and the Philippines &quot;The Indies&quot;, an enduring remnant of Columbus&#x27;s notion that he had reached Asia by sailing west. When these territories reach a high level of importance, the crown established the Council of the Indies in 1524, following the conquest of the Aztec Empire, asserting permanent royal control over its possessions. Regions with dense indigenous populations and sources of mineral wealth attracting Spanish settlers became colonial centers, while those without such resources were peripheral to crown interest. Once regions incorporated into the empire and their importance assessed, overseas possessions came under stronger or weaker crown control.

The crown learned its lesson with the rule of Christopher Columbus and his heirs in the Caribbean, and they never subsequently gave authorization of sweeping powers to explorers and conquerors. The Catholic Monarchs&#x27; conquest of Granada in 1492 and their expulsion of the Jews &quot;were militant expressions of religious statehood at the moment of the beginning of the American colonization.&quot; The crown&#x27;s power in the religious sphere was absolute in its overseas possessions through the papacy&#x27;s grant of the Patronato real, and &quot;Catholicism was indissolubly linked with royal authority.&quot; Church-State relations were established in the conquest era and remained stable until the end of the Habsburg era in 1700, when the Bourbon monarchs implemented major reforms and changed the relationship between crown and altar.

The crown&#x27;s administration of its overseas empire was implemented by royal officials in both the civil and religious spheres, often with overlapping jurisdictions. The crown could administer the empire in the Indies by using native elites as intermediaries with the large indigenous populations. Administrative costs of empire were kept low, with a small number of Spanish officials generally paid low salaries. Crown policy to maintain a closed commercial system limited to one port in Spain and only a few in the Indies was in practice not closed, with European merchant houses supplying Spanish merchants in the Spanish port of Seville with high quality textiles and other manufactured goods that Spain itself could not supply. Much of the silver of the Indies was diverted into those European merchant houses. Crown officials in the Indies enabled the creation of a whole commercial system in which they could coerce native populations to participate while reaping profits themselves in cooperation with merchants.

== Explorers, conquerors, and expansion of the empire ==

The Spanish conquest was facilitated by the spread of diseases such as smallpox, common in Europe but never present in the New World, which reduced the indigenous populations in the Americas. This sometimes caused a labor shortage for plantations and public works and so the colonists informally and gradually, at first, initiated the Atlantic slave trade.
One of the most accomplished conquistadors was Hernán Cortés, who, leading a relatively small Spanish force but with local translators and the crucial support of thousands of native allies, achieved the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire in the campaigns of 1519–1521. This territory later became the Viceroyalty of New Spain, present day Mexico. Of equal importance was the Spanish conquest of the Inca Empire by Francisco Pizarro, which would become the Viceroyalty of Peru. The Spanish conquest of the Maya began in 1524, but the Maya kingdoms resisted integration into the Spanish Empire with such tenacity that their defeat took almost two centuries.
After the conquest of Mexico, rumors of golden cities (Quivira and Cíbola in North America and El Dorado in South America) motivated several other expeditions. Many of those returned without having found their goal, or finding it much less valuable than was hoped. Indeed, the New World colonies only began to yield a substantial part of the Crown&#x27;s revenues with the establishment of mines such as that of Potosí (Bolivia) and Zacatecas (Mexico) both started in 1546. By the late 16th century, silver from the Americas accounted for one-fifth of Spain&#x27;s total budget.
Eventually the world&#x27;s stock of precious metal was doubled or even tripled by silver from the Americas. Official records indicate that at least 75% of the silver was taken across the Atlantic to Spain and no more than 25% across the Pacific to China. Some modern researchers argue that due to rampant smuggling about 50% went to China. In the 16th century &quot;perhaps 240,000 Europeans&quot; entered American ports.

Further Spanish settlements were progressively established in the New World: New Granada in the 1530s (later in the Viceroyalty of New Granada in 1717 and present day Colombia), Lima in 1535 as the capital of the Viceroyalty of Peru, Buenos Aires in 1536 (later in the Viceroyalty of the Río de la Plata in 1776), and Santiago in 1541.

Florida was colonized in 1565 by Pedro Menéndez de Avilés when he founded St. Augustine and then promptly destroyed Fort Caroline in French Florida and massacred its several hundred Huguenot inhabitants after they surrendered. Saint Augustine quickly became a strategic defensive base for the Spanish ships full of gold and silver being sent to Spain from its New World dominions.

The Portuguese mariner sailing for Castile, Ferdinand Magellan, died while in the Philippines commanding a Castilian expedition in 1522, which was the first to circumnavigate the globe. The Basque commander Juan Sebastián Elcano led the expedition to success. Spain sought to enforce their rights in the Moluccan islands, which led a conflict with the Portuguese, but the issue was resolved with the Treaty of Zaragoza (1525), settling the location of the antimeridian of Tordesillas, which would divide the world into two equal hemispheres. From then on, maritime expeditions led to the discovery of several archipelagos in the South Pacific as the Pitcairn Islands, the Marquesas, Tuvalu, Vanuatu, the Solomon Islands or New Guinea, to which Spain laid claim.

Most important in Pacific exploration was the claim on the Philippines, which was populous and strategically located for the Spanish settlement of Manila and entrepôt for trade with China. On 27 April 1565, the first permanent Spanish settlement in the Philippines was founded by Miguel López de Legazpi and the service of Manila Galleons was inaugurated. The Manila Galleons shipped goods from all over Asia across the Pacific to Acapulco on the coast of Mexico. From there, the goods were transshipped across Mexico to the Spanish treasure fleets, for shipment to Spain. The Spanish trading port of Manila facilitated this trade in 1572. Although Spain claimed islands in the Pacific, it did not encounter or claim the Hawaiian Islands. The control of Guam, Mariana Islands, Caroline Islands, and Palau came later, from the end of the 17th century, and remained under Spanish control until 1898.

In the 18th century, Spain was concerned with increasing Russian and British influence in the Pacific Northwest of North America and sent several expeditions to explore and further shore up Spanish claims to the region.

== Organization and administration of empire ==
The empire in the Indies was a newly established dependency of the kingdom of Castile alone, so crown power was not impeded by any existing cortes (i.e. parliament), administrative or ecclesiastical institution, or seigneurial group. The crown sought to establish and maintain control over its overseas possessions through a complex, hierarchical bureaucracy, which in many ways was decentralized. The crown asserted is authority and sovereignty of the territory and vassals it claimed, collected taxes, maintained public order, meted out justice, and established policies for governance of large indigenous populations. Many institutions established in Castile found expression in The Indies from the early colonial period. Spanish universities expanded to train lawyer-bureaucrats (&quot;letrados&quot;) for administrative positions in Spain and its overseas empire.

The end of the Habsburg dynasty in 1700 saw major administrative reforms in the eighteenth century under the Bourbon monarchy, starting with the first Spanish Bourbon monarch, Philip V (r. 1700–1746) and reaching its apogee under Charles III (r. 1759–1788). The reorganization of administration has been called &quot;a revolution in government.&quot; Reforms sought to centralize government control through reorganization of administration, reinvigorate the economies of Spain and the Spanish empire through changes in mercantile and fiscal policies, defend Spanish colonies and territorial claims through the establishment of a standing military, undermine the power of the Catholic church, and rein in the power of the American-born elites.

===Early institutions of governance===
The crown relied on ecclesiastics as important councilors and royal officials in the governance of their overseas territories. Archbishop Juan Rodríguez de Fonseca, Isabella&#x27;s confessor, was tasked with reining in Columbus&#x27;s independence. He strongly influenced the formulation of colonial policy under the Catholic Monarchs, and was instrumental in establishing the Casa de Contratación (1503), which enabled crown control over trade and immigration. Ovando fitted out Magellan&#x27;s voyage of circumnavigation, and became the first President of the Council of the Indies in 1524. Ecclesiastics also functioned as administrators overseas in the early Caribbean period, particularly Frey Nicolás de Ovando, who was sent to investigate the administration of Francisco de Bobadilla, the governor appointed to succeed Christopher Columbus. Later ecclesiastics served as interim viceroys, general inspectors (visitadores), and other high posts.

The crown established control over trade and emigration to the Indies with the 1503 establishment the Casa de Contratación (House of Trade) in Seville. Ships and cargoes were registered, and emigrants vetted to prevent migration of anyone not of old Christian heritage and facilitated the migration of families and women. In addition, the &quot;Casa de Contratación&quot; took charge of the fiscal organization, and of the organization and judicial control of the trade with the Indies.

The politics of asserting royal authority opposite to Columbus caused the suppression of his privileges in The Indies and the creation of territorial governance under royal authority. These governorates, also called as provinces, were the basic of the territorial government of the Indies, and arose as the territories were conquered and colonized. To carry out the expedition (&quot;entrada&quot;), which entailed exploration, conquest, and initial settlement of the territory, the king, as owner of the Indies, agreed &quot;capitulación&quot; (an itemized contract) with the specifics of the conditions of the expedition in a particular territory. The individual leaders of expeditions (&quot;adelantados&quot;) assumed the expenses of the venture and in return received as reward the grant from the government of the conquered territories; and in addition, they received instructions about treating the aborigens.

After the end of the period of conquests, it was necessary to manage extensive and different territories with a strong bureaucracy. In the face of the impossibility of the Castilian institutions to take care of the New World affairs, other new institutions were created.

As the basic political entity it was the governorate, or province. The governors exercised judicial ordinary functions of first instance, and prerogatives of government legislating by ordinances. To these political functions of the governor, it could be joined the military ones, according to military requirements, with the rank of Captain general. The office of captain general involved to be the supreme military chief of the whole territory and he was responsible for recruiting and providing troops, the fortification of the territory, the supply and the shipbuilding.

Provinces in the Spanish Empire had a royal treasury controlled by a set of &quot;officiales reales&quot; (royal officials). The officials of the royal treasury included up to four positions: a &quot;&quot; (treasurer), who guarded money on hand and made payments; a &quot;&quot; (accountant or comptroller), who recorded income and payments, maintained records, and interpreted royal instructions; a &quot;factor&quot;, who guarded weapons and supplies belonging to the king, and disposed of tribute collected in the province; and a &quot;&quot; (overseer), who was responsible for contacts with native inhabitants of the province, and collected the king&#x27;s share of any war booty. The treasury officials were appointed by the king, and were largely independent of the authority of the governor. Treasury officials were generally paid out of the income from the province and were normally prohibited from engaging in personal income-producing activities.

The indigenous populations in the Caribbean became the focus of the crown in its roles as sovereigns of the empire and patron of the Catholic Church. Spanish conquerors holding grants of indigenous labor in encomienda ruthlessly exploited them Spanish. A number of friars in the early period came to the vigorous defense of the indigenous populations, who were new converts to Christianity. Prominent Dominican friars in Santo Domingo, especially Antonio de Montesinos and Bartolomé de las Casas denounced the maltreatment and pressed the crown to act to protect the indigenous populations. The crown enacted Laws of Burgos (1513) and the Requerimiento to curb the power of the Spanish conquerors and give indigenous populations the opportunity to peacefully embrace Spanish authority and Christianity. Neither was effective in its purpose. Las Casas was officially appointed Protector of the Indians and spent his life arguing forcefully on their behalf. The New Laws of 1542, limiting the power of encomenderos, were a result.

Beginning in 1522 in the newly conquered Mexico, government units in the Spanish Empire had a royal treasury controlled by a set of &quot;officiales reales&quot; (royal officials). There were also sub-treasuries at important ports and mining districts. The officials of the royal treasury at each level of government typically included two to four positions: a &quot;tesorero&quot; (treasurer), the senior official who guarded money on hand and made payments; a &quot;contador&quot; (accountant or comptroller), who recorded income and payments, maintained records, and interpreted royal instructions; a &quot;factor&quot;, who guarded weapons and supplies belonging to the king, and disposed of tribute collected in the province; and a &quot;veedor&quot; (overseer), who was responsible for contacts with native inhabitants of the province, and collected the king&#x27;s share of any war booty. The &quot;veedor&quot;, or overseer, position quickly disappeared in most jurisdictions, subsumed into the position of &quot;factor&quot;. Depending on the conditions in a jurisdiction, the position of &quot;factor/veedor&quot; was often eliminated, as well.

The treasury officials were appointed by the king, and were largely independent of the authority of the viceroy, audiencia president or governor. On the death, unauthorized absence, retirement or removal of a governor, the treasury officials would jointly govern the province until a new governor appointed by the king could take up his duties. Treasury officials were supposed to be paid out of the income from the province, and were normally prohibited from engaging in income-producing activities.

===Spanish Law and indigenous peoples===
The protection of the indigenous populations from enslavement and exploitation by Spanish settlers was established in the Laws of Burgos, 1512–1513. The laws were the first codified set of laws governing the behavior of Spanish settlers in the Americas, particularly with regards to treatment of native Indians in the institution of the encomienda. They forbade the maltreatment of natives, and endorsed the Indian Reductions with attempts of conversion to Catholicism. Upon their failure to effectively protect the indigenous and following the Spanish conquest of the Aztec Empire and the Spanish conquest of Peru, more stringent laws to control conquerors&#x27; and settlers&#x27; exercise of power, especially their maltreatment of the indigenous populations, were promulgated, known as the New Laws (1542). The crown aimed to prevent the formation of an aristocracy in the Indies not under crown control.

Despite the fact that The Queen Isabel was the first monarch that laid the first stone for the protection of the indigenous peoples in her testament in which the Catholic monarch prohibited the enslavement of the indigenous peoples of the Americas. Then the first such in 1542; the legal thought behind them was the basis of modern International law. Taking advantage of their extreme remoteness from royal power, some colonists were disagree with the laws when they saw their power being reduced, forcing a partial suppression of these New Laws.

The Valladolid debate (1550–1551) was the first moral debate in European history to discuss the rights and treatment of a colonized people by colonizers. Held in the Colegio de San Gregorio, in the Spanish city of Valladolid, it was a moral and theological debate about the colonization of the Americas, its justification for the conversion to Catholicism and more specifically about the relations between the European settlers and the natives of the New World. It consisted of a number of opposing views about the way natives were to be integrated into colonial life, their conversion to Christianity and their rights and obligations. According to the French historian Jean Dumont The &quot;Valladolid debate&quot; was a major turning point in world history &quot;In that moment in Spain appeared the dawn of the human rights&quot;.

===Council of the Indies===

In 1524 the Council of the Indies was established, following the system of Councils that advised the monarch and made decisions on his behalf about specific matters of government. Based in Castile, with the assignment of the governance of the Indies, it was thus responsible for drafting legislation, proposing the appointments to the King for civil government as well as ecclesiastical appointments, and pronouncing judicial sentences; as maximum authority in the overseas territories, the Council of the Indies took over both the institutions in the Indies as the defense of the interests of the Crown, the Catholic Church, and of indigenous peoples. With the 1508 papal grant to the crown of the Patronato real, the crown, rather than the pope, exercised absolute power over the Catholic Church in the Americas and the Philippines, a privilege the crown zealously guarded against erosion or incursion. Crown approval through the Council of the Indies was needed for the establishment of bishoprics, building of churches, appointment of all clerics.

In 1721, at the beginning of the Bourbon monarchy, the crown transferred the main responsibility for governing the overseas empire from the Council of the Indies to the Ministry of the Navy and the Indies, which were subsequently divided into two separate ministries in 1754.

===Viceroyalties===

The impossibility of the physical presence of the monarch and the necessity of strong royal governance in the Indies resulted in the appointment of viceroys (&quot;vice-kings&quot;), the direct representation of the monarch, in both civil and ecclesiastical spheres. Viceroyalties were the largest territory unit of administration in the civil and religious spheres and the boundaries of civil and ecclesiastical governance coincided by design, to ensure crown control over both bureaucracies. Until the eighteenth century, there were just two viceroyalties, with the Viceroyalty of New Spain (founded 1535) administering North America, a portion of the Caribbean, and the Philippines, and the viceroyalty of Peru (founded 1542) having jurisdiction over Spanish South America. Viceroys served as the vice-patron of the Catholic Church, including the Inquisition, established in the seats of the viceroyalties (Mexico City and Peru). Viceroys were responsible for good governance of their territories, economic development, and humane treatment of the indigenous populations.

In the eighteenth-century reforms, the Viceroyalty of Peru was reorganized, splitting off portions to form the Viceroyalty of New Granada (Colombia) (1739) and the Viceroyalty of Rio de la Plata (Argentina) (1776), leaving Peru with jurisdiction over Peru, Charcas, and Chile. Viceroys were of high social standing, almost without exception born in Spain, and served fixed terms.

=== Audiencias, the High Courts ===

The Audiencias were initially constituted by the crown as a key administrative institution with royal authority and loyalty to the crown as opposed to conquerors and first settlers. Although constituted as the highest judicial authority in their territorial jurisdiction, they also had executive and legislative authority, and served as the executive on an interim basis. Judges (&quot;oidores&quot;) held &quot;formidable power. Their role in judicial affairs and in overseeing the implementation of royal legislation made their decisions important for the communities they served.&quot; Since their appointments were for life or the pleasure of the monarch, they had a continuity of power and authority that viceroys and captains-general lacked because of their shorter-term appointments. They were the &quot;center of the administrative system [and] gave the government of the Indies a strong basis of permanence and continuity.&quot;

Their main function was judicial, as a court of justice of second instance —court of appeal— in penal and civil matters, but also the Audiencias were courts the first instance in the city where it had its headquarters, and also in the cases involving the Royal Treasury. Besides court of justice, the Audiencias had functions of government as counterweight the authority of the viceroys, since they could communicate with both the Council of the Indies and the king without the requirement of requesting authorization from the viceroy. This direct correspondence of the Audiencia with the Council of the Indies made it possible for the council to give the Audiencia direction on general aspects of government.

Audiencias were a significant base of power and influence for American-born elites, starting in the late sixteenth century, with nearly a quarter of appointees being born in the Indies by 1687. During a financial crisis in the late seventeenth century, the crown began selling Audiencia appointments, and American-born Spaniards held 45% of Audiencia appointments. Although there were restrictions of appointees&#x27; ties to local elite society and participation in the local economy, they acquired dispensations from the cash-strapped crown. Audiencia judgments and other functions became more tied to the locality and less to the crown and impartial justice.

During the Bourbon Reforms in the mid-eighteenth century, the crown systematically sought to centralize power in its own hands and diminish that of its overseas possessions, appointing peninsular-born Spaniards to Audiencias. American-born elite men complained bitterly about the change, since they lost access to power that they had enjoyed for nearly a century.

===Civil administrative districts===

During the early colonial era and under the Habsburgs, the crown established a regional layer of colonial jurisdiction in the institution of Corregimiento, which was between the Audiencia and town councils. Corregimiento expanded &quot;royal authority from the urban centers into the countryside and over the indigenous population.&quot; As with many colonial institutions, corregimiento had its roots in Castile when the Catholic Monarchs centralize power over municipalities. In the Indies, corregimiento initially functioned to bring control over Spanish settlers who exploited the indigenous populations held in encomienda, to protect the shrinking indigenous populations and prevent the formation of an aristocracy of conquerors and powerful settlers. The royal official in charge of a district was the Corregidor, who was appointed by the viceroy, usually for a five-year term. Corregidores collected the tribute from indigenous communities and regulated forced indigenous labor. Alcaldías mayores were larger districts with a royal appointee, the &quot;Alcalde mayor&quot;.

As the indigenous populations declined, the need for corregimiento decreased and then suppressed, with the alcaldía mayor remaining an institution until it was replaced in the eighteenth-century Bourbon Reforms by royal officials, Intendants. The salary of officials during the Habsburg era were paltry, but the corregidor or alcalde mayor in densely populated areas of indigenous settlement with a valuable product could use his office for personal enrichment. As with many other royal posts, these positions were sold, starting in 1677. The Bourbon-era intendants were appointed and relatively well paid.

===Ecclesiastical organization===
During the early colonial period, the crown authorized friars of Catholic religious orders (Franciscans, Dominicans, and Augustinians) to function as priests during the conversion of indigenous populations. During the early Age of Discovery, the diocesan clergy in Spain was poorly educated and considered of a low moral standing, and the Catholic Monarchs were reluctant to allow them to spearhead evangelization. Each order set up networks of parishes in the various regions (provinces), sited in existing Indian settlements, where Christian churches were built and where evangelization of the indigenous was based. However, after the 1550s, the crown increasingly favored the diocesan clergy over the religious orders since the diocesan clergy was under the direct authority of the crown, while religious orders were with their own internal regulations and leadership. The crown had authority to draw the boundaries for dioceses and parishes. The creation of the ecclesiastical hierarchy with priests who not members of religious orders, those known as the diocesan or secular clergy, marked a turning point in the crown&#x27;s control over the religious sphere. In 1574, Philip II promulgated the Order of Patronage (Ordenaza del Patronato) ordering the religious orders to turn over their parishes to the secular clergy, a policy that secular clerics had long sought for the central areas of empire, with their large indigenous populations. Although implementation was slow and incomplete, it was an assertion of royal power over the clergy and the quality of parish priests improved, since the Ordenanza mandated competitive examination to fill vacant positions. Religious orders along with the Jesuits embarked on further evangelization in frontier regions of the empire. The Jesuits resisted crown control, refusing to pay the tithe on their estates that supported the ecclesiastical hierarchy and came into conflict with bishops. The most prominent example is in Puebla, Mexico, when Bishop Juan de Palafox y Mendoza was driven from his bishopric by the Jesuits. The bishop challenged the Jesuits&#x27; continuing to hold Indian parishes and function as priests without the required royal licenses. His fall from power is viewed as an example of the weakening of the crown in the mid-seventeenth century since it failed to protect their duly appointed bishop. The crown expelled the Jesuits from Spain and The Indies in 1767 during the Bourbon Reforms.

=== Cabildos or town councils ===

Spanish settlers sought to live in towns and cities, with governance being accomplished through the town council or &quot;Cabildo&quot;. The cabildo was composed of the prominent residents (&quot;vecinos&quot;) of the municipality, so that governance was restricted to a male elite, with majority of the population exercising power. Cities were governed on the same pattern as in Spain and in the Indies the city was the framework of Spanish life. The cities were Spanish and the countryside indigenous. In areas of previous indigenous empires with settled populations, the crown also melded existing indigenous rule into a Spanish pattern, with the establishment of cabildos and the participation of indigenous elites as officials holding Spanish titles. There were a variable number of councilors (&quot;regidores&quot;), depending on the size of the town, also two municipal judges (&quot;alcaldes menores&quot;), who were judges of first instance, and also other officials as police chief, inspector of supplies, court clerk, and a public herald. They were in charge of distributing land to the neighbors, establishing local taxes, dealing with the public order, inspecting jails and hospitals, preserving the roads and public works such as irrigation ditches and bridges, supervising the public health, regulating the festive activities, monitoring market prices, or the protection of Indians.

After the reign of Philip II, the municipal offices, including the councilors, were auctioned to alleviate the need for money of the Crown, even the offices could also be sold, which became hereditary, so that the government of the cities went on to hands of urban oligarchies. In order to control the municipal life, the Crown ordered the appointment of &quot;corregidores&quot; and &quot;alcaldes mayores&quot; to exert greater political control and judicial functions in minor districts. Their functions were governing the respective municipalities, administering of justice and being appellate judges in the &quot;alcaldes menores&quot;″ judgments, but only the &quot;corregidor&quot; could preside over the &quot;cabildo&quot;. However, both charges were also put up for sale freely since the late 16th century.&lt;/ref&gt;

Most Spanish settlers came to the Indies as permanent residents, established families and businesses, and sought advancement in the colonial system, such as membership of cabildos, so that they were in the hands of local, American-born (&quot;crillo&quot;) elites. During the Bourbon era, even when the crown systematically appointed peninsular-born Spaniards to royal posts rather than American-born, the cabildos remained in the hands of local elites.

===Frontier institutions – presidio and mission===

As the empire expanded into areas of less dense indigenous populations, the crown created a chain of presidios, military forts or garrisons, that provided Spanish settlers protection from Indian attacks. In Mexico during the sixteenth-century Chichimeca War, presidios guarded the transit of silver from the mines of Zacatecas to Mexico City. As many as 60 salaried soldiers were garrisoned in presidios. Presidios had resident commanders, who set up commercial enterprises of imported merchandise, selling it to soldiers as well as Indian allies.

The other frontier institution was the religious mission to convert the indigenous populations. Missions were established with royal authority through the Patronato real. The Jesuits were effective missionaries in frontier areas until their expulsion from Spain and its empire in 1767. The Franciscans took over some former Jesuit missions and continued the expansion of areas incorporated into the empire. Although their primary focus was on religious conversion, missionaries served as &quot;diplomatic agents, peace emissaries to hostile tribes ... and they were also expected to hold the line against nomadic nonmissionary Indians as well as other European powers.&quot; On the frontier of empire, Indians were seen as &quot;sin razón&quot;, (&quot;without reason&quot;); non-Indian populations were described as &quot;gente de razón&quot; (&quot;people of reason&quot;), who could be mixed-race castas or black and had greater social mobility in frontier regions.

==Ordering colonial society – social structure and legal status==


Codes regulated the status of individuals and groups in the empire in both the civil and religious spheres, with Spaniards (peninsular- and American-born) monopolizing positions of economic privilege and political power. Royal law and Catholicism codified and maintained hierarchies of class and race, while all were subjects of the crown and mandated to be Catholic. The crown took active steps to establish and maintain Catholicism by evangelizing the pagan indigenous populations, as well as African slaves not previously Christian, and incorporating them into Christendom. Catholicism remains the dominant religion in Spanish America. The crown also imposed restrictions on emigration to the Americas, excluding Jews and crypto-Jews, Protestants, and foreigners, using the &quot;Casa de Contratación&quot; to vet potential emigres and issue licenses to travel.

The portrait to the right was most likely used as a souvenir. For those who traveled to the New World and back it was common to bring back souvenirs as there were a great interest in what the New World meant. The land would be significantly different but there was a special emphasis put on the emerging mixed races. Not only was there whites mixing with blacks but there were natives mixing with both whites and blacks as well. From a Spanish viewpoint, the castas paintings would most-likely have provided a sort of sense to the madness that was mixed races. There were political implications of this portrait as well. The mestizo child appears to be literate with a satisfied grin facing his father alluding to the opportunity the child has due to his father being European.

A central question from the time of first Contact with indigenous populations was their relationship to the crown and to Christianity. Once those issues were resolved theologically, in practice the crown sought to protect its new vassals. It did so by dividing peoples of the Americas into the &quot;República de Indios&quot;, the native populations, and the &quot;República de Españoles&quot;. The República de Españoles was the entire Hispanic sector, composed of Spaniards, but also Africans (enslaved and free), as well as mixed-race castas.

Within the &quot;República de Indios&quot;, men were explicitly excluded from ordination to the Catholic priesthood and obligation for military service as well as the jurisdiction of the Inquisition. Indians under colonial rule who lived in pueblos de indios had crown protections due to their statuses as legal minors. Due to the lack of prior exposure to the Catholic faith, Queen Isabella had declared all indigenous peoples her subjects. This differed from people of the African continent because these populations had theoretically been exposed to Catholicism and chose not to follow it. This religious differentiation is important because it gave indigenous communities legal protections from members of the Républica de Españoles. In fact, an often overlooked aspect of the colonial legal system was that members of the pueblos de indios could appeal to the crown and circumvent the legal system in the Républica de Españoles. The statuses of the indigenous populations as legal minors barred them from becoming priests, but the républica de indios operated with a fair amount of autonomy. Missionaries also acted as guardians against &quot;encomendero&quot; exploitation. Indian communities had protections of traditional lands by the creation of community lands that could not be alienated, the &quot;fondo legal&quot;. They managed their own affairs internally through Indian town government under the supervision of royal officials, the &quot;corregidores&quot; and &quot;alcaldes mayores&quot;. Although indigenous men were barred from becoming priests, indigenous communities created religious confraternities under priestly supervision, which functioned as burial societies for their individual members, but also organized community celebrations for their patron saint. Blacks also had separate confraternities, which likewise contributed to community formation and cohesion, reinforcing identity within a Christian institution.

Conquest and evangelization were inseparable in Spanish America. The first order to make the trip to the Americas were the Franciscans, led by Pedro de Gante. Franciscans believed that living a spiritual life of poverty and holiness was the best way to be an example that inspired others to convert. The friars would walk into the towns barefoot as a display of their surrender to God in a sort of theater of conversion. With this began the practice of evangelization of the peoples of the new world as supported by the Spanish government. 
Religious orders in Spanish America had their own internal structures and were organizationally autonomous, but nonetheless were very important to the structure of colonial society. They had their own resources and hierarchies. Though some orders took vows of poverty, by the time the second wave of friars came to the Americas and as their numbers grew, the orders began amassing wealth and thus became key economic players. The church, as this wealthy power, had huge estates and built large constructions such as gilded monasteries and cathedrals. Priests themselves also became wealthy landowners. Orders like the Franciscans also established schools for the indigenous elites as well as hired indigenous laborers, thereby shifting the dynamics in the indigenous communities and their relationship to the Spanish.

After the fall of the Aztec and Inca empires, the rulers of the empires were replaced by the Spanish monarchy, while retaining much of the hierarchical indigenous structures. The crown recognized noble status of elite Indians, giving them exemption from the head-tax and the right to use the nobles title &quot;don&quot; and &quot;doña&quot;. Indigenous noblemen were a key group for the administration of the Spanish Empire, since they served as intermediaries between crown officials and indigenous communities. Indigenous noblemen could serve on &quot;cabildos&quot;, ride horses, and carry firearms. The crown&#x27;s recognition of indigenous elites as nobles meant that these men were incorporated into colonial system with privileges separating them from Indian commoners. Indian noblemen were thus crucial to the governance of the huge indigenous population. Through their continued loyalty to the crown, they maintained their positions of power within their communities but also served as agents of colonial governance. The Spanish Empire&#x27;s use of local elites to rule large populations that are ethnically distinct from the rulers has long been practiced by earlier empires. Indian caciques were crucial in the early Spanish period, especially when the economy was still based on extracting tribute and labor from commoner Indians who had rendered goods and service to their overlords in the prehispanic period. Caciques mobilized their populations for encomenderos and, later, &quot;repartimiento&quot; recipients chosen by the crown. The noblemen became the officers of the cabildo in indigenous communities, regulating internal affairs, as well as defending the communities&#x27; rights in court. In Mexico, this was facilitated by the 1599 establishment of the General Indian Court (&quot;Juzgado General de Indios&quot;), which heard legal disputes in which indigenous communities and individuals were engaged. With legal mechanisms for dispute-resolution, there were relatively few outbreaks of violence and rebellion against crown rule. Eighteenth-century rebellions in long-peaceful areas of Mexico, the Tzeltal Rebellion of 1712 and most spectacularly in Peru with the Tupac Amaru Rebellion (1780–81) saw indigenous noblemen leading uprisings against the Spanish state.

In the &quot;República de Españoles&quot;, class and race hierarchies were codified in institutional structures. Spaniards emigrating to The Indies were to be Old Christians of pure Christian heritage, with the crown excluding New Christians, converts from Judaism and their descendants, because of their suspect religious status. The crown established the Inquisition in Mexico and Peru in 1571, and later Cartagena de Indias (Colombia), to guard Catholics from the influence of crypto-Jews, Protestants, and foreigners. Church practices established and maintained racial hierarchies by recording baptism, marriage, and burial were kept separate registers for different racial groups. Churches were also physically divided by race.

Race mixture (&quot;mestizaje&quot;) was a fact of colonial society, with the three racial groups, European whites (&quot;españoles&quot;), Africans (&quot;negros&quot;), and Indians (&quot;indios&quot;) producing mixed-race offspring, or castas. There was a pyramid of racial status with the apex being the small number of European white (&quot;españoles&quot;), a slightly larger number of mixed-race castas, who, like the whites were mainly urban dwelling, and the largest populations were Indians living in communities in the countryside. Although Indians were classified as part of the &quot;República de Indios&quot;, their offspring of unions with &quot;Españoles&quot; and Africans were &quot;castas&quot;. White-Indian mixtures were more socially acceptable in the Hispanic sphere, with the possibility over generations of mixed-race offspring being classified as Español. Any offspring with African ancestry could never remove the &quot;stain&quot; of their racial heritage, since Africans were seen as &quot;natural slaves&quot;. Eighteenth-century paintings depicted elites&#x27; ideas of the &quot;sistema de castas&quot; in hierarchical order, but there was some fluidity in the system rather than absolute rigidity. Men of color began to apply to the Royal and Pontifical University of Mexico, but in 1688 Bishop Juan de Palafox y Mendoza attempted to prevent their entrance by drafting new regulations barring blacks and mulattoes. In small Mexican parishes, dark complected priests served while their mixed-race heritage was left unacknowledged. In 1776, the crown attempted to prevent marriages between racially unequal partners by issuing the Royal Pragmatic on Marriage, taking approval of marriages away from the couple and placing it in their parents&#x27; hands. The marriage between Luisa de Abrego, a free black domestic servant from Seville and Miguel Rodríguez, a white Segovian conquistador in 1565 in St. Augustine (Spanish Florida), is the first known and recorded Christian marriage anywhere in the continental United States.

The criminal justice system in Spanish cities and towns meted out justice depending on the severity of the crime and the class, race, age, health, and gender of the accused. Non-whites (blacks and mixed-race castas) were far more often and more severely punished, while Indians, considered legal minors, were not expected to behave better and were more leniently punished. Royal and municipal legislation attempted to control the behavior of black slaves, who were subject to a curfew, could not carry arms, and were prohibited from running away from their masters. As the urban, white, lower-class (plebeian) population increased, they too were increasingly subject to criminal arrest and punishment. Capital punishment was seldom employed, with the exception of sodomy and recalcitrant prisoners of the Inquisition, whose deviation from Christian orthodoxy was considered extreme. However, only the civil sphere could exercise capital punishment and prisoners were &quot;relaxed&quot;, that is, released to civil authorities. Often criminals served sentences of hard labor in textile workshops (&quot;obrajes&quot;), presidio service on the frontier, and as sailors on royal ships. Royal pardons to ordinary criminals were often accorded on the celebration of a royal marriage, coronation, or birth.

Elite Spanish men had access to special corporate protections (&quot;fueros&quot;) and had exemptions by virtue of their membership in a particular group. One important privilege was their being judged by the court of their corporation. Members of the clergy held the &quot;fuero eclesiástico&quot; were judged by ecclesiastical courts, whether the offense was civil or criminal. In the eighteenth century the crown established a standing military and with it, special privileges (&quot;fuero militar&quot;). The privilege extended to the military was the first &quot;fuero&quot; extended to the non-whites who served the crown. Indians had a form of corporate privilege through their membership in indigenous communities. In central Mexico, the crown established a special Indian court (Juzgado General de Indios), and legal fees, including access to lawyers, were funded by a special tax. The crown extended the peninsular institution of the merchant guild (&quot;consulado&quot;) first established in Spain, including Seville (1543), and later established in Mexico City and Peru. Consulado membership was dominated by peninsular-born Spaniards, usually members of transatlantic commercial houses. The consulados&#x27; tribunals heard disputes over contracts, bankruptcy, shipping, insurance and the like and became a wealthy and powerful economic institution and source of loans to the viceroyalties. Transatlantic trade remained in the hands of mercantile families based in Spain and the Indies. The men in the Indies were often younger relatives of the merchants in Spain, who often married wealthy American-born women. American-born Spanish men (&quot;criollos&quot;) in general did not pursue commerce but instead owned landed estates, entered the priesthood, or became a professional. Within elite families then peninsular-born Spaniards and &quot;criollos&quot; were often kin.

The regulation of the social system perpetuated the privileged status of wealthy elite spanish men against the vast indigenous populations, and the smaller but still significant number of mixed-race castas. In the Bourbon era, for the first time there was a distinction made between Iberian-born and American-born Spaniards, In the Habsburg era, in law and ordinary speech they were grouped together without distinction. Increasingly American-born Spaniards developed a distinctly local focus, with peninsular-born (&quot;peninsulares&quot;) Spaniards increasingly seen as outsiders and resented, but this was a development in the late colonial period. Resentment against &quot;peninsulares&quot; was due to a deliberate change in crown policy, which systematically favored them over American-born &quot;criollos&quot; for high positions in the civil and religious hierarchies. This left &quot;criollos&quot; only the membership in a city or town&#x27;s cabildo. When the secularizing Bourbon monarchy pursued policies strengthening secular royal power over religious power, it attacked the &quot;fuero eclesiástico&quot;, which for many members of the lower clergy was a significant privilege. Parish priests who had functioned as royal officials as well as clerics in Indian towns lost their privileged position. At the same time the crown established a standing army and promoted militias for the defense of empire, creating a new avenue of privilege for creole men and for castas, but excluding indigenous men from conscription or voluntary service.

<text>Milankovitch cycles describe the collective effects of changes in the Earth&#x27;s movements on its climate over thousands of years. The term was coined and named after the Serbian geophysicist and astronomer Milutin Milanković. In the 1920s, he provided a more definitive and quantitative analysis than James Croll&#x27;s earlier hypothesis that variations in eccentricity, axial tilt, and precession combined to result in cyclical variations in the intra-annual and latitudinal distribution of solar radiation at the Earth&#x27;s surface, and that this orbital forcing strongly influenced the Earth&#x27;s climatic patterns.

==Earth movements==
The Earth&#x27;s rotation around its axis, and revolution around the Sun, evolve over time due to gravitational interactions with other bodies in the Solar System. The variations are complex, but a few cycles are dominant.
The Earth&#x27;s orbit varies between nearly circular and mildly elliptical (its eccentricity varies). When the orbit is more elongated, there is more variation in the distance between the Earth and the Sun, and in the amount of solar radiation, at different times in the year. In addition, the rotational tilt of the Earth (its obliquity) changes slightly. A greater tilt makes the seasons more extreme. Finally, the direction in the fixed stars pointed to by the Earth&#x27;s axis changes (axial precession), while the Earth&#x27;s elliptical orbit around the Sun rotates (apsidal precession). The combined effect of precession with eccentricity is that proximity to the Sun occurs during different astronomical seasons.

Milankovitch studied changes in these movements of the Earth, which alter the amount and location of solar radiation reaching the Earth. This is known as &quot;solar forcing&quot; (an example of radiative forcing). Milankovitch emphasized the changes experienced at 65° north due to the great amount of land at that latitude. Land masses change surface temperature more quickly than oceans, mainly because convective mixing between shallow and deeper waters keeps the ocean surface relatively cooler. Similarly, the very large thermal inertia of the global ocean delays changes to Earth&#x27;s average surface temperature when gradually driven by other forcing factors.

===Orbital eccentricity===

The Earth&#x27;s orbit approximates an ellipse. Eccentricity measures the departure of this ellipse from circularity. The shape of the Earth&#x27;s orbit varies between nearly circular (theoretically the eccentricity can hit zero) and mildly elliptical (highest eccentricity was 0.0679 in the last 250 million years). Its geometric or logarithmic mean is 0.0019. The major component of these variations occurs with a period of 405,000 years (eccentricity variation of ±0.012). Other components have 95,000-year and 124,000-year cycles (with a beat period of 400,000 years). They loosely combine into a 100,000-year cycle (variation of −0.03 to +0.02). The present eccentricity is 0.0167 and decreasing.

Eccentricity varies primarily due to the gravitational pull of Jupiter and Saturn. The semi-major axis of the orbital ellipse, however, remains unchanged; according to perturbation theory, which computes the evolution of the orbit, the semi-major axis is invariant. The orbital period (the length of a sidereal year) is also invariant, because according to Kepler&#x27;s third law, it is determined by the semi-major axis. Longer-term variations are caused by interactions involving the perihelia and nodes of the planets Mercury, Venus, Earth, Mars, and Jupiter.

====Effect on temperature====
The semi-major axis is a constant. Therefore, when Earth&#x27;s orbit becomes more eccentric, the semi-minor axis shortens. This increases the magnitude of seasonal changes.

The relative increase in solar irradiation at closest approach to the Sun (perihelion) compared to the irradiation at the furthest distance (aphelion) is slightly larger than four times the eccentricity. For Earth&#x27;s current orbital eccentricity, incoming solar radiation varies by about 6.8%, while the distance from the Sun currently varies by only 3.4% ().

Perihelion presently occurs around 3 January, while aphelion is around 4 July. When the orbit is at its most eccentric, the amount of solar radiation at perihelion will be about 23% more than at aphelion. However, the Earth&#x27;s eccentricity is so small (at least at present) that the variation in solar irradiation is a minor factor in seasonal climate variation, compared to axial tilt and even compared to the relative ease of heating the larger land masses of the northern hemisphere.

====Effect on lengths of seasons====
The seasons are quadrants of the Earth&#x27;s orbit, marked by the two solstices and the two equinoxes. Kepler&#x27;s second law states that a body in orbit traces equal areas over equal times; its orbital velocity is highest around perihelion and lowest around aphelion. The Earth spends less time near perihelion and more time near aphelion. This means that the lengths of the seasons vary. Perihelion currently occurs around 3 January, so the Earth&#x27;s greater velocity shortens winter and autumn in the northern hemisphere, and summer and spring in the southern hemisphere. Summer in the northern hemisphere is 4.66 days longer than winter, and spring is 2.9 days longer than autumn. In the southern hemisphere this is the reverse, winter is 4.66 days longer than summer, and autumn is 2.9 days longer than spring. Greater eccentricity increases the variation in the Earth&#x27;s orbital velocity. Currently, however, the Earth&#x27;s orbit is becoming less eccentric (more nearly circular). This will make the seasons in the immediate future more similar in length.

===Axial tilt (obliquity)===
The angle of the Earth&#x27;s axial tilt with respect to the orbital plane (the obliquity of the ecliptic) varies between 22.1° and 24.5°, over a cycle of about 41,000 years. The current tilt is 23.44°, roughly halfway between its extreme values. The tilt last reached its maximum in 8,700 BCE, which correlates with the beginning of the Holocene, the current geological epoch. It is now in the decreasing phase of its cycle, and will reach its minimum around the year 11,800 CE. Increased tilt increases the amplitude of the seasonal cycle in insolation, providing more solar radiation in each hemisphere&#x27;s summer and less in winter. However, these effects are not uniform everywhere on the Earth&#x27;s surface. Increased tilt increases the total annual solar radiation at higher latitudes, and decreases the total closer to the equator.

The current trend of decreasing tilt, by itself, will promote milder seasons (warmer winters and colder summers), as well as an overall cooling trend. Because most of the planet&#x27;s snow and ice lies at high latitude, &quot;decreasing&quot; tilt may encourage the termination of an interglacial period (and lead to an overall cooler climate) and the onset of a glacial period for two reasons: 1) there is less overall summer insolation, and 2) there is less insolation at higher latitudes (which melts less of the previous winter&#x27;s snow and ice).

===Axial precession===
Axial precession is the trend in the direction of the Earth&#x27;s axis of rotation relative to the fixed stars, with a period of about 25,700 years. Also known as the precession of the equinoxes, this motion means that eventually Polaris will no longer be the north pole star. This precession is caused by the tidal forces exerted by the Sun and the Moon on the rotating Earth; both contribute roughly equally to this effect.

Currently, perihelion occurs during the southern hemisphere&#x27;s summer. This means that solar radiation due to both the axial tilt inclining the southern hemisphere toward the Sun, and the Earth&#x27;s proximity to the Sun, will reach maximum during the southern summer and reach minimum during the southern winter. These effects on heating are thus additive, which means that seasonal variation in irradiation of the southern hemisphere is more extreme. In the northern hemisphere, these two factors reach maximum at opposite times of the year: the north is tilted toward the Sun when the Earth is furthest from the Sun. The two effects work in opposite directions, resulting in less extreme variations in insolation.

In about 10,000 years, the north pole will be tilted toward the Sun when the Earth is at perihelion. Axial tilt and orbital eccentricity will both contribute their maximum increase in solar radiation during the northern hemisphere&#x27;s summer. Axial precession will promote more extreme variation in irradiation of the northern hemisphere and less extreme variation in the south. When the Earth&#x27;s axis is aligned such that aphelion and perihelion occur near the equinoxes, axial tilt will not be aligned with or against eccentricity.

===Apsidal precession===

The orbital ellipse itself precesses in space, in an irregular fashion, completing a full cycle in about 112,000 years relative to the fixed stars. Apsidal precession occurs in the plane of the ecliptic and alters the orientation of the Earth&#x27;s orbit relative to the ecliptic. This happens primarily as a result of interactions with Jupiter and Saturn. Smaller contributions are also made by the sun&#x27;s oblateness and by the effects of general relativity that are well known for Mercury.

Apsidal precession combines with the 25,700-year cycle of axial precession (see above) to vary the position in the year that the Earth reaches perihelion. Apsidal precession shortens this period to about 21,000 years, at present. According to a relatively old source (1965), the average value over the last 300,000 years was 23,000 years, varying between 20,800 and 29,000 years.
As the orientation of Earth&#x27;s orbit changes, each season will gradually start earlier in the year. Precession means the Earth&#x27;s nonuniform motion (see above) will affect different seasons. Winter, for instance, will be in a different section of the orbit. When the Earth&#x27;s apsides (extremes of distance from the sun) are aligned with the equinoxes, the length of spring and summer combined will equal that of autumn and winter. When they are aligned with the solstices, the difference in the length of these seasons will be greatest.

===Orbital inclination===

The inclination of Earth&#x27;s orbit drifts up and down relative to its present orbit. This three-dimensional movement is known as &quot;precession of the ecliptic&quot; or &quot;planetary precession&quot;. Earth&#x27;s current inclination relative to the invariable plane (the plane that represents the angular momentum of the Solar System—approximately the orbital plane of Jupiter) is 1.57°. Milankovitch did not study planetary precession. It was discovered more recently and measured, relative to Earth&#x27;s orbit, to have a period of about 70,000 years. When measured independently of Earth&#x27;s orbit, but relative to the invariable plane, however, precession has a period of about 100,000 years. This period is very similar to the 100,000-year eccentricity period. Both periods closely match the 100,000-year pattern of glacial events.

==Theory constraints==
Materials taken from the Earth have been studied to infer the cycles of past climate. Antarctic ice cores contain trapped air bubbles whose ratios of different oxygen isotopes are a reliable proxy for global temperatures around the time the ice was formed. Study of this data concluded that the climatic response documented in the ice cores was driven by northern hemisphere insolation as proposed by the Milankovitch hypothesis. Similar astronomical hypotheses had been advanced in the 19th century by Joseph Adhemar, James Croll, and others.

Analysis of deep-ocean cores and of lake depths, and a seminal paper by Hays, Imbrie, and Shackleton provide additional validation through physical evidence. Climate records contained in a core of rock drilled in Arizona show a pattern synchronized with Earth&#x27;s eccentricity, and cores drilled in New England match it, going back 215 million years.
===100,000-year issue===
Of all the orbital cycles, Milankovitch believed that obliquity had the greatest effect on climate, and that it did so by varying the summer insolation in northern high latitudes. Therefore, he deduced a 41,000-year period for ice ages. However, subsequent research has shown that ice age cycles of the Quaternary glaciation over the last million years have been at a period of 100,000 years, which matches the eccentricity cycle. Various explanations for this discrepancy have been proposed, including frequency modulation or various feedbacks (from carbon dioxide, or ice sheet dynamics). Some models can reproduce the 100,000-year cycles as a result of non-linear interactions between small changes in the Earth&#x27;s orbit and internal oscillations of the climate system. In particular, the mechanism of the stochastic resonance was originally proposed in order to describe this interaction.

Jung-Eun Lee of Brown University proposes that precession changes the amount of energy that Earth absorbs, because the southern hemisphere&#x27;s greater ability to grow sea ice reflects more energy away from Earth. Moreover, Lee says, &quot;Precession only matters when eccentricity is large. That&#x27;s why we see a stronger 100,000-year pace than a 21,000-year pace.&quot; Some others have argued that the length of the climate record is insufficient to establish a statistically significant relationship between climate and eccentricity variations.

===Transition changes===

From 1–3 million years ago, climate cycles matched the 41,000-year cycle in obliquity. After one million years ago, the Mid-Pleistocene Transition (MPT) occurred with a switch to the 100,000-year cycle matching eccentricity. The &quot;transition problem&quot; refers to the need to explain what changed one million years ago. The MPT can now be reproduced in numerical simulations that include a decreasing trend in carbon dioxide and glacially induced removal of regolith.

===Interpretation of unsplit peak variances===
Even the well-dated climate records of the last million years do not exactly match the shape of the eccentricity curve. Eccentricity has component cycles of 95,000 and 125,000 years. Some researchers, however, say the records do not show these peaks, but only indicate a single cycle of 100,000 years. The split between the two eccentricity components, however, is observed at least once in a drill core from the 500-million year-old Scandinavian Alum Shale.

===Unsynced stage five observation===
Deep-sea core samples show that the interglacial interval known as marine isotope stage 5 began 130,000 years ago. This is 10,000 years before the solar forcing that the Milankovitch hypothesis predicts. (This is also known as the causality problem because the effect precedes the putative cause.)

==Present and future conditions==
Since orbital variations are predictable, any model that relates orbital variations to climate can be run forward to predict future climate, with two caveats: the mechanism by which orbital forcing influences climate is not definitive; and non-orbital effects can be important (for example, the human impact on the environment principally increases greenhouse gases resulting in a warmer climate).

An often-cited 1980 orbital model by Imbrie predicted &quot;the long-term cooling trend that began some 6,000 years ago will continue for the next 23,000 years.&quot; Another work suggests that solar insolation at 65° N will reach a peak of 460 W·m−2 in around 6,500 years, before decreasing back to current levels (450 W·m−2) in around 16,000 years. Earth&#x27;s orbit will become less eccentric for about the next 100,000 years, so changes in this insolation will be dominated by changes in obliquity, and should not decline enough to permit a new glacial period in the next 50,000 years.

==Other celestial bodies==
===Mars===
Since 1972, speculation sought a relationship between the formation of Mars&#x27; alternating bright and dark layers in the polar layered deposits, and the planet&#x27;s orbital climate forcing. In 2002, Laska, Levard, and Mustard showed ice-layer radiance, as a function of depth, correlate with the insolation variations in summer at the Martian north pole, similar to palaeoclimate variations on Earth. They also showed Mars&#x27; precession had a period of about 51 kyr, obliquity had a period of about 120 kyr, and eccentricity had a period ranging between 95 and 99 kyr. In 2003, Head, Mustard, Kreslavsky, Milliken, and Marchant proposed Mars was in an interglacial period for the past 400 kyr, and in a glacial period between 400 and 2100 kyr, due to Mars&#x27; obliquity exceeding 30°. At this extreme obliquity, insolation is dominated by the regular periodicity of Mars&#x27; obliquity variation. Fourier analysis of Mars&#x27; orbital elements, show an obliquity period of 128 kyr, and a precession index period of 73 kyr.

Mars has no moon large enough to stabilize its obliquity, which has varied from 10 to 70 degrees. This would explain recent observations of its surface compared to evidence of different conditions in its past, such as the extent of its polar caps.

===Outer Solar system===
Saturn&#x27;s moon Titan has a cycle of approximately 60,000 years that could change the location of the methane lakes. Neptune&#x27;s moon Triton has a variation similar to Titan&#x27;s, which could cause its solid nitrogen deposits to migrate over long time scales.

===Exoplanets===
Scientists using computer models to study extreme axial tilts have concluded that high obliquity could cause extreme climate variations, and while that would probably not render a planet uninhabitable, it could pose difficulty for land-based life in affected areas. Most such planets would nevertheless allow development of both simple and more complex lifeforms. Although the obliquity they studied is more extreme than Earth ever experiences, there are scenarios 1.5 to 4.5 billion years from now, as the Moon&#x27;s stabilizing effect lessens, where obliquity could leave its current range and the poles could eventually point almost directly at the Sun.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Girdlers is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London.
Girdlers were granted the right to regulate their trade in the City from 1327 and obtained a Royal Charter in 1449. Girdlers, or makers of belts and girdles, are no longer closely related to their original trade. Along with the products of many other Livery Companies, girdles have become less important than in medieval times. However, the Company continues its long tradition as a charitable body.

The Girdlers&#x27; Company ranks twenty-third in the order of precedence among City Livery Companies. The Company&#x27;s motto is &quot;Give Thanks To God&quot;.

<text>Optical engineering is the field of engineering encompassing the physical phenomena and technologies associated with the generation, transmission, manipulation, detection, and utilization of light. Optical engineers use the science of optics to solve problems and to design and build devices that make light do something useful. They design and operate optical equipment that uses the properties of light using physics and chemistry, such as lenses, microscopes, telescopes, lasers, sensors, fiber-optic communication systems and optical disc systems (e.g. CD, DVD).

Optical engineering metrology uses optical methods to measure either micro-vibrations with instruments like the laser speckle interferometer, or properties of masses with instruments that measure refraction.

Nano-measuring and nano-positioning machines are devices designed by optical engineers. These machines, for example microphotolithographic steppers, have nanometer precision, and consequently are used in the fabrication of goods at this scale.

<doc id="372620" wikidata="Q1778169" url="?curid=372620" title="Schur complement">
<text>The Schur complement is a key tool in the fields of linear algebra, the theory of matrices, numerical analysis, and statistics.

It is defined for a block matrix. Suppose &quot;p&quot;, &quot;q&quot; are nonnegative integers such that &quot;p + q &gt; 0&quot;, and suppose &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot;, &quot;D&quot; are respectively &quot;p&quot; × &quot;p&quot;, &quot;p&quot; × &quot;q&quot;, &quot;q&quot; × &quot;p&quot;, and &quot;q&quot; × &quot;q&quot; matrices of complex numbers. Let
formula_1
so that &quot;M&quot; is a (&quot;p&quot; + &quot;q&quot;) × (&quot;p&quot; + &quot;q&quot;) matrix.

If &quot;D&quot; is invertible, then the Schur complement of the block &quot;D&quot; of the matrix &quot;M&quot; is the &quot;p&quot; × &quot;p&quot; matrix defined by
formula_2
If &quot;A&quot; is invertible, the Schur complement of the block &quot;A&quot; of the matrix &quot;M&quot; is the &quot;q&quot; × &quot;q&quot; matrix defined by
formula_3
In the case that &quot;A&quot; or &quot;D&quot; is singular, substituting a generalized inverse for the inverses on &quot;M/A&quot; and &quot;M/D&quot; yields the generalized Schur complement.

The Schur complement is named after Issai Schur who used it to prove Schur&#x27;s lemma, although it had been used previously. Emilie Virginia Haynsworth was the first to call it the &quot;Schur complement&quot;. The Schur complement is sometimes referred to as the &quot;Feshbach map&quot; after a physicist Herman Feshbach.

==Background==
The Schur complement arises when performing a block Gaussian elimination on the matrix &quot;M&quot;. In order to eliminate the elements below the block diagonal, one multiplies the matrix &quot;M&quot; by a &quot;block lower triangular&quot; matrix on the right as follows:
formula_4
where &quot;Ip&quot; denotes a &quot;p&quot;×&quot;p&quot; identity matrix. As a result, the Schur complement formula_5 appears in the upper-left &quot;p&quot;×&quot;p&quot; block.

Continuing the elimination process beyond this point (i.e., performing a block Gauss–Jordan elimination),
formula_6
leads to an LDU decomposition of &quot;M&quot;, which reads
formula_7
Thus, the inverse of &quot;M&quot; may be expressed involving &quot;D&quot;−1 and the inverse of Schur&#x27;s complement, assuming it exists, as
formula_8
The above relationship comes from the elimination operations that involve &quot;D&quot;−1 and &quot;M/D&quot;. An equivalent derivation can be done with the roles of &quot;A&quot; and &quot;D&quot; interchanged. By equating the expressions for &quot;M&quot;−1 obtained in these two different ways, one can establish the matrix inversion lemma, which relates the two Schur complements of &quot;M&quot;: &quot;M/D&quot; and &quot;M/A&quot; (see &quot;Derivation from LDU decomposition&quot; in ).

== Properties ==

* If &quot;p&quot; and &quot;q&quot; are both 1 (i.e., &quot;A&quot;, &quot;B&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;D&quot; are all scalars), we get the familiar formula for the inverse of a 2-by-2 matrix:
: formula_9
: provided that &quot;AD&quot; − &quot;BC&quot; is non-zero.
* In general, if &quot;A&quot; is invertible, then
: formula_10
: whenever this inverse exists.
* (Schur&#x27;s formula) When &quot;A&quot;, respectively &quot;D&quot;, is invertible, the determinant of &quot;M&quot; is also clearly seen to be given by
: formula_11, respectively
: formula_12,
: which generalizes the determinant formula for 2 × 2 matrices.
* (Guttman rank additivity formula) If &quot;D&quot; is invertible, then the rank of &quot;M&quot; is given by
: formula_13
* (Haynsworth inertia additivity formula) If &quot;A&quot; is invertible, then the &quot;inertia&quot; of the block matrix &quot;M&quot; is equal to the inertia of &quot;A&quot; plus the inertia of &quot;M&quot;/&quot;A&quot;.
* (Quotient identity) formula_14.
* The Schur complement of a Laplacian matrix is also a Laplacian matrix.

== Application to solving linear equations ==
The Schur complement arises naturally in solving a system of linear equations such as 

formula_15.

Assuming that the submatrix formula_16 is invertible, we can eliminate formula_17 from the equations, as follows.

formula_18

Substituting this expression into the second equation yields
: formula_19

We refer to this as the &quot;reduced equation&quot; obtained by eliminating formula_17 from the original equation. The matrix appearing in the reduced equation is called the Schur complement of the first block formula_16 in formula_22:
: formula_23.

Solving the reduced equation, we obtain
: formula_24

Substituting this into the first equation yields
: formula_25

We can express the above two equation as:
: formula_26

Therefore, a formulation for the inverse of a block matrix is:
: formula_27

In particular, we see that the Schur complement is the inverse of the formula_28 block entry of the inverse of formula_22.

In practice, one needs formula_16 to be well-conditioned in order for this algorithm to be numerically accurate.

This method is useful in electrical engineering to reduce the dimension of a network&#x27;s equations. It is especially useful when element(s) of the output vector are zero. For example, when formula_31 or formula_32 is zero, we can eliminate the associated rows of the coefficient matrix without any changes to the rest of the output vector. If formula_32 is null then the above equation for formula_17 reduces to formula_35, thus reducing the dimension of the coefficient matrix while leaving formula_31 unmodified. This is used to advantage in electrical engineering where it is referred to as node elimination or Kron reduction.

==Applications to probability theory and statistics==

Suppose the random column vectors &quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot; live in R&quot;n&quot; and R&quot;m&quot; respectively, and the vector (&quot;X&quot;, &quot;Y&quot;) in R&quot;n&quot; + &quot;m&quot; has a multivariate normal distribution whose covariance is the symmetric positive-definite matrix

:formula_37

where formula_38 is the covariance matrix of &quot;X&quot;, formula_39 is the covariance matrix of &quot;Y&quot; and formula_40 is the covariance matrix between &quot;X&quot; and &quot;Y&quot;.

Then the conditional covariance of &quot;X&quot; given &quot;Y&quot; is the Schur complement of &quot;C&quot; in formula_41:

:formula_42

If we take the matrix formula_43 above to be, not a covariance of a random vector, but a &quot;sample&quot; covariance, then it may have a Wishart distribution. In that case, the Schur complement of &quot;C&quot; in formula_43 also has a Wishart distribution.

== Conditions for positive definiteness and semi-definiteness ==

Let &quot;X&quot; be a symmetric matrix of real numbers given by
formula_45
Then
* If &quot;A&quot; is invertible, then &quot;X&quot; is positive definite if and only if &quot;A&quot; and its complement &quot;X/A&quot; are both positive definite:
:formula_46
* If &quot;C&quot; is invertible, then &quot;X&quot; is positive definite if and only if &quot;C&quot; and its complement &quot;X/C&quot; are both positive definite:
:formula_47
* If &quot;A&quot; is positive definite, then &quot;X&quot; is positive semi-definite if and only if the complement &quot;X/A&quot; is positive semi-definite:
:formula_48
* If &quot;C&quot; is positive definite, then &quot;X&quot; is positive semi-definite if and only if the complement &quot;X/C&quot; is positive semi-definite: 
:formula_49

The first and third statements can be derived by considering the minimizer of the quantity
formula_50
as a function of &quot;v&quot; (for fixed &quot;u&quot;).

Furthermore, since
formula_51
and similarly for positive semi-definite matrices, the second (respectively fourth) statement is immediate from the first (resp. third) statement.

There is also a sufficient and necessary condition for the positive semi-definiteness of &quot;X&quot; in terms of a generalized Schur complement. Precisely,
* formula_52 and
* formula_53

where formula_54 denotes a generalized inverse of formula_16.

<text>James Croll, FRS, (2 January 1821 – 15 December 1890) was a 19th-century Scottish scientist who developed a theory of climate variability based on changes in the Earth&#x27;s orbit.

==Life==
James Croll was born in 1821 on the farm of Little Whitefield, near Wolfhill in Perthshire, Scotland, the son of David Croll, mason, and his wife Janet Geddes. He was largely self-educated. At 16 he became an apprentice wheelwright at Collace near Wolfhill, and then because of health problems a tea merchant in Elgin, Moray. 
In 1848 he married Isabella Macdonald, daughter of John Macdonald and Annabella Sime, of Forres. 

In the 1850s he managed a temperance hotel in Blairgowrie, and was then an insurance agent in Glasgow, Edinburgh and Leicester. 
In 1859, he became a janitor at the museum of the Andersonian University in Glasgow. He was able to use the university library to get access to books, and taught himself physics and astronomy to develop his ideas.

From 1864, Croll corresponded with Sir Charles Lyell, on links between ice ages and variations in the Earth&#x27;s orbit. 
He theorised that changes in the Earth&#x27;s orbit could cause the Gulf Stream to be diverted, bringing less heat to the Arctic. More ice would then lead to more sunlight being reflected, causing a feedback loop. His ideas were published in the &quot;Philosophical Magazine&quot; in 1864, attributed to &quot;James Croll, Anderson&#x27;s University&quot;.
This led to a position in the Edinburgh office of the Geological Survey of Scotland, as keeper of maps and correspondence, where the director, Sir Archibald Geikie, encouraged his research. 
He published a number of books and papers which &quot;were at the forefront of contemporary science&quot;, including &quot;Climate and Time, in Their Geological Relations&quot; in 1875. He corresponded with Charles Darwin on erosion by rivers.

In 1876, he was elected Fellow of the Royal Society, and awarded an honorary degree by the University of St Andrews. He retired in 1880 because of ill health.

==Death==
Croll died on 15 December 1890 at 5 Pitcullen Crescent, in Perth. He was buried in a family grave in Cargill, Perthshire.
Croll&#x27;s work has been widely recognised in scientific circles and societies. The highest award of the Quaternary Research Association is the James Croll Medal.

==Theory of ice ages==

Croll was the leading proponent of an astronomical-based theory of climate change, now known as the &quot;Astronomical Theory of Climate Change&quot;. Using formulae for orbital variations developed by Urbain Le Verrier (which had led to the discovery of Neptune), Croll developed a theory of the effects of variations of the Earth&#x27;s orbit on climate cycles. His idea was that decreases in winter sunlight would favour snow accumulation, and for the first time coupled this to the idea of a positive ice-albedo feedback to amplify the solar variations. Croll further argued that the accumulation of snow would change the pattern of trade winds, leading to the deflection of warming currents like the Gulf Stream, and finally a self-sustaining ice age. He suggested that when orbital eccentricity is high winters will tend to be colder when the Earth is further from the sun in that season and hence, that during periods of high orbital eccentricity, ice ages occur on 22,000-year cycles in each hemisphere, and alternate between southern and northern hemispheres, lasting approximately 10,000 years each.

Croll&#x27;s theory predicted multiple ice ages, asynchronous in northern and southern hemispheres, and that the last ice ages should have ended about 80,000 years ago. Evidence was just then emerging of multiple ice ages, and geologists were interested in a theory to explain this. Geologists were not then able to date sediments accurately enough to determine if glaciation was synchronous between the hemispheres, though the limited evidence more pointed towards synchronicity than not. More crucially, estimates of the recession rate of the Niagara Falls indicated that the last ice age ended 6,000 to 35,000 years ago – a large range, but enough to rule out Croll&#x27;s theory, to those who accepted the measurements.

Croll&#x27;s work was widely discussed, but by the end of the 19th century, his theory was generally discredited. However, the basic idea of orbitally-forced insolation variations influencing terrestrial temperatures – now known generally as Milankovitch cycles – was further developed by Milutin Milankovitch and eventually, in modified form, triumphed in 1976. A number of scholars have argued that Croll&#x27;s contribution was sufficiently fundamental as to describe the orbital cycles as Croll-Milankovitch Cycles.

<doc id="372630" wikidata="Q7533327" url="?curid=372630" title="Siyaj Kʼakʼ">
<text>Siyaj Kʼakʼ (alternative spelling: Siyah Kʼakʼ), also known as Fire is Born (formerly nicknamed &quot;Smoking Frog&quot;), was a prominent political figure mentioned in the glyphs of Classic Period () Maya civilization monuments, principally Tikal (which he conquered in January 378), as well as Uaxactun and the city of Copan. Epigraphers originally identified him by the nickname &quot;Smoking Frog&quot;, a description of his name glyph, but later deciphered it as &quot;Siyaj Kʼakʼ&quot;, meaning &quot;Fire is born&quot;. He is believed by some to have been the general of the Teotihuacano ruler Spearthrower Owl.

==Overview==
Originally from Teotihuacan or very closely allied with that city, Siyaj Kʼakʼ was a warlord in the Maya heartland of the Petén (modern Guatemala) during the fourth century. In 378 and 379, he oversaw the replacing of the kings of important Maya states, such as Tikal, Uaxactun, and Copan with new rulers who claimed descent from Spearthrower Owl, possibly the ruler of Teotihuacan. As Fire is Born, he caused himself to be portrayed wearing Teotihuacano battle dress. It is during his lifetime that the public architecture of the Central Mexican capital began to be emulated in the Maya region; particularly the &quot;talud-tablero&quot; style so characteristic of the Mexican highlands, and so atypical of Maya building styles.

Siyaj Kʼakʼ remained a power in the region until his death early in the fifth century, acting as overlord to such kings as Yax Nuun Ayiin I (aka &quot;Curl Nose&quot;) of Tikal. The appearance of Siyah Kʼakʼ marks the beginning of a strong cultural influx from the Valley of Mexico, although whether this was accomplished via peaceful interaction or military invasion is still being very actively debated.

The history of Siyaj K&#x27;ak is referenced in the fiction novel, The Legend of the Jaguar King, by Anand Jay, where the protagonist, Ayush Mahavir, visits the rumoured location of his tomb in the city of Uaxactun, Guatemala.

<doc id="372633" wikidata="Q8037007" url="?curid=372633" title="Worshipful Company of Butchers">
<text>The Worshipful Company of Butchers is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London, England. Records indicate that an organisation of butchers existed as early as 975; the Butchers&#x27; Guild, the direct predecessor of the present Company, was granted the right to regulate the trade in 1331. The Butchers&#x27; Guild was incorporated by Royal Charter centuries later, in 1605. The Butchers&#x27; still, unlike other Livery Companies, continues to exist as a trade association for members of the industry, instead of evolving into an institution primarily dedicated to charity. However, the Company does contribute, like all Livery Companies, to various charities.

The Company ranks twenty-fourth in the order of precedence of City Livery Companies. The Company&#x27;s motto is: &quot;Omnia Subiecisti Sub Pedibus, Oves Et Boves&quot;, from the Book of Psalms and Latin for: &quot;Thou Hast Put All Things Under Man&#x27;s Feet, All Sheep and Oxen&quot;.

== History of the Butchers Hall ==

The Company&#x27;s headquarters is at Butchers&#x27; Hall. The Butchers&#x27; has had several halls throughout its history; the first was located in Monkwell Street and dated from the second half of the 15th century. The next Hall near St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital was destroyed in the Great Fire of London of 1666, together with forty three other Livery Company Halls. Its successor in Pudding Lane (1667–77) was again burnt down, rebuilt in 1829-30 and compulsorily purchased by an Act of Parliament in 1882. A new Hall was built at the present site in Bartholomew Close (1884–85), which was bombed in both world wars: 1915 and again in 1944. The Company&#x27;s present Hall dates from 1960.

== Royal connections ==

Queen Elizabeth the Queen Mother was admitted as an Honorary Freeman of the Company in March 1976, continuing a link with the Monarchy that started with King James I in 1605; she took a constant interest in &quot;Her Butchers&quot;. Following the Queen Mother&#x27;s death in March 2002, her granddaughter, the Princess Royal was admitted to the Honorary Freedom of the Company (February 2003). Like the Queen Mother, the Princess Royal takes a keen interest in Company affairs, serving as its Master (2011–12).
== Arms of the Butchers Company ==
Arms: Azure two Poleaxes in saltire Or blades inwards between two Bulls&#x27; Heads couped in fesse Argent on a Chief of the last a Boar&#x27;s Head couped Gules tusked of the second langued of the first between two bunches of Knee-Holly Vert banded Gold

Mantling: Gules doubled Argent

Supporters: On either side a Bull with wings addorsed the head forequarters wings hoofs and tuft of the tail Or the hindquarters Argent armed Gules about the head a Nimbus of the first

== Other links ==
The Butchers&#x27; connections with the local area remain strong, many Liverymen working at Smithfield Market.

The Butchers&#x27; Hall and St Bartholomew&#x27;s Hospital have also stood side by side for years, forging links that continue to this day.

The Butchers&#x27; also maintains close relations with Commonwealth and international associations. For instance, the Australian High Commissioner and New Zealand High Commissioner are customarily granted the Honorary Freedom of the Company.

St Bartholomew-the-Great is the Butchers&#x27; adopted Church, and is where the Company&#x27;s Annual Church Service takes place prior to Common Hall. The Honorary Chaplain to the Master Butcher is often the Rector of St Barts.

<text>Earphoria is a live album by American alternative rock band The Smashing Pumpkins. It is the soundtrack of the band&#x27;s &quot;Vieuphoria&quot; video. While the video has been widely available since its initial release, the CD was initially released as a limited number (under 1000) of promo copies in 1994, and was subsequently heavily bootlegged. In 2002, &quot;Vieuphoria&quot; was reissued on DVD and &quot;Earphoria&quot; finally earned a commercial release.

The CD contains the audio for all the performances in &quot;Vieuphoria&quot;, and includes extended versions of the music used in the video interludes. An exception is the performance of &quot;Silverfuck&quot; – &quot;Earphoria&quot; includes the tease of &quot;Over the Rainbow&quot; while &quot;Vieuphoria&quot; edits it out, possibly owing to prohibitive licensing costs.

== Critical reception ==
&quot;While a live document of the Pumpkins&#x27; farewell tour would have been very palatable,&quot; opined &quot;Classic Rock&quot;, &quot;this mix-and-match collection of (mainly) live material from the full breadth of their career is far more imaginative. It&#x27;s also vastly superior to their previous odds-and-sods compilation &quot;Pisces Iscariot&quot;.&quot;

== Track listing ==
All tracks written by Billy Corgan, except where noted.
== Personnel ==

* Jimmy Chamberlin – drums
* Billy Corgan – vocals, guitar
* James Iha – guitar, vocals
* D&#x27;arcy Wretzky – bass guitar, vocals, percussion on &quot;Mayonaise&quot;

<doc id="372646" wikidata="Q1343362" url="?curid=372646" title="Australian Idol">
<text>Australian Idol is a scripted Australian singing competition, which began its first season in July 2003 and ended its initial run in November 2009. As part of the &quot;Idol&quot; franchise, Australian Idol originated from the reality program &quot;Pop Idol&quot;, which was created by British entertainment executive Simon Fuller. Australian Idol was televised on Network Ten for its first seven series and was broadcast on the Southern Cross Austereo Radio Network between 2005 and 2007. The series returned in 2023 after Seven Network announced they would be picking up the show.

==Finalists==
==Series overview==
== Judges and Hosts ==
==History==
&quot;Australian Idol&quot; sought to discover the most commercial young singer in Australia through a series of nationwide auditions. The outcomes of the later stages of this competition were determined by public voting. It was the first show to use this system of voting in Australia. The original judging panel featured Mark Holden, Marcia Hines and Ian &#x27;Dicko&#x27; Dickson. In 2005, this was changed as Dickson was replaced by Kyle Sandilands.

In 2007, Dickson again returned to the program, when Holden left at the end of the season. In 2009, Sandilands was replaced by Jay Dee Springbett.

===Cancellation===

Network Ten made the decision to &quot;rest&quot; the program for 2010 after poor ratings in 2009. No further comment was formally made regarding the future of &quot;Australian Idol&quot; on Network Ten until early 2013, following the network&#x27;s acquisition of rights to the American series, when program chief Beverley McGarvey hinted it may return. However, later that same year, a Ten spokesperson confirmed that it would not be returning.

===Revival===
On 21 October 2020, Seven Network announced at their annual upfronts that they would be reviving the series, originally slated for 2022.

On 28 September 2022, Seven announced that Ricki-Lee Coulter and Scott Tweedie would be the new hosts, with the judging panel consisting of former &quot;American Idol&quot; judge Harry Connick Jr., former &quot;Australian Idol&quot; judge Kyle Sandilands, Amy Shark and Meghan Trainor. Original judge Marcia Hines appeared as a guest judge. The revival premiered on 30 January 2023.

In July 2023, it was officially revealed that the show had been renewed by Seven Network for a ninth season, set to premier in 2024. It was later revealed that Coulter and Tweedie would return as hosts, and that Sandilands and Shark will be returning to their judging positions. However, Connick Jr. and Trainor will not be returning, with Trainor leaving due to family reasons. Original judge Marcia Hines will return as a main judge. Seven officially confirmed the 2024 judges at their upfronts in October 2023. In November 2024, the series was renewed for a tenth season by Seven with Sandilands, Hines and Shark returning as judges with Coulter &amp; Tweedie returning as hosts.

==Format==

===Auditions===
Auditions were held in major cities around Australia to find each season&#x27;s contestants. Any contestant who got a &quot;yes&quot; from a majority of judges was put through to the top 100 in Sydney. The TV episodes showed the most interesting auditions, which generally meant the worst and the best.

* In Seasons 1, 3, 4, 6 and 7, auditions were held in Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Brisbane and Adelaide.
* In Season 5 auditions were also held in Darwin.
* In Season 2 in addition to the above cities, auditions were also held in Tamworth, Canberra and Hobart.

===Top 100===
Singers who progress from the auditions go to Sydney, in a stage which was sometimes called the Top 100 or Top 50 (season 8). Over a few days, these contestants are narrowed down to the semi-finalists.

===Semi-finals===
Over different seasons, the number of semi-finalists varied between 24 and 40, with between 8 and 10 contestants. For the first seven seasons, each semi-final was spread over two nights. On the first night, each semi-finalist sang a song, and was critiqued by each judge. Then over the next day, the public voted (by phone or SMS). The second night was results night, and the top 2 or 3 went through to the top 12. There was also included a &quot;wild card&quot; semi-final, to give some contestants a second chance to make the top 12.

For seasons 1 to 3, each semi-final took a week, with performances on Sunday night and results on Monday night. For seasons 4 onwards, the semi-finals were all in a single week, because there was greater viewer interest in the finals than the semi-finals.

The formats for the different seasons were:

Season 1 had 5 semi-finalis of 8 contestants each. The top 2 in each semi-final made the top 12. A wild card round decided 2 more finalists (it turned out to be 3 after one contestant withdrew) - one judges&#x27; choice, two by public vote.

Seasons 2 and 3 had 3 semi-finals of 10 contestants each, with the top 3 in each semi-final making the top 12. Then a further 3 were progressed from the wild card round (2 by judges&#x27; choice, 1 by public vote). (The wild card episode in the 3rd season had a little twist, when the judges announced a third person, namely, Roxanne Lebrasse, who also had the 2nd highest number of votes, would be included in the finals, making it a Top 13.)

Seasons 4, 5, 6 and 7 had 4 semi-finals of 6 contestants each, with the top 2 in each semi-final making the top 12. Then a further 4 made the Top 12 from the wild card round. Seasons 4 and 5 had same gender semi-finals, while Season 6 had 3 males and 3 females in each semi-final. For the wild card show, Seasons 4 and 6 selected 3 by judges&#x27; choice and 1 by public vote; Season 5 selected 2 by judges&#x27; choice and 2 by public vote;.

Season 8 had 3 semi-finals of 8 contestants each, with the judges putting 4 from each through to the top 12, on the same night. There was no public voting and no wild card round.

For the first five seasons, contestants who made the semi-finals in previous seasons were not eligible to audition. From the 2008 season onwards, only Top 12 contestants from previous seasons were ineligible.

===Finals (Top 12)===
In the Season 1 to 7 finals, one contestant was eliminated per week. (With the exception of Season 1, which eliminated 2 in the first 3 weeks of the finals, and Season 3, which eliminated 2 in the first week of finals due to having a final 13). In the Season 8 finals, two contestants were eliminated per week.

Each week, contestants chose a song to a weekly theme on the Sunday night. (As the number of contestants got smaller, they sang two or three songs each). As in the semi-finals, each performance was critiqued by the judges, and then there was (approximately) 24 hours of voting by phone or SMS, before the results were announced on the Monday night. The eliminated competitor(s) then presented a final song – usually the number they sang the previous night. In Season 8, each of the bottom 4 performed on elimination night, after voting had closed but before the results were announced.

====Grand Finale====
The final results night, the Grand Finale, was held at the Sydney Opera House. It usually featured fireworks and an outdoor concert with many past &quot;Idol&quot; stars and other Australian musicians. It had been the highest rating episode of each season. The top 12 were celebrated and at the end of the night the winner was announced. Seasons 1–5 were held inside Sydney Opera House on the concert hall stage. For seasons 6 and 7, the finale was held on a stage erected on the Opera House forecourt.

After the first two seasons, the top 12 and top 10 went on a national tour. There were no tours for later seasons. However, there was a &quot;Winner&#x27;s Journey Tour&quot; involving the winner with some guest performances from the Top 12 for seasons 4 and 5.

===Touchdowns===
A &quot;touchdown&quot; was awarded by judge Mark Holden when, in his own opinion, a contestant&#x27;s performance was particularly good. Holden awarded his first ever &quot;touchdown&quot; to Cosima De Vito for her rendition of Cold Chisel&#x27;s &quot;When the War Is Over&quot; in the Top 8 on Australian Made night in Season 1. De Vito also received a touchdown for her rendition of Respect, a classic hit by Aretha Franklin. Season 4 winner, Damien Leith and Season 2 winner, Casey Donovan have the record for the highest number of touchdowns at four apiece. Leith is the only contestant to receive two touchdowns in the same night. Emily Williams, and Matt Corby, runners-up of seasons 3 and 5 respectively both hold the record of receiving the most touchdowns without winning, at three apiece. In 2004, Top 8 contestants choice night, he awarded his only ever &#x27;Grand Royal&#x27; Touchdown when Anthony Callea sang his stunning rendition of &quot;The Prayer&quot; which is still regarded as one of the most memorable performances of all seven series. Another two of Holden&#x27;s most memorable &quot;touchdowns&quot; were awarded to Guy Sebastian for his rendition of &quot;Climb Every Mountain&quot; on the Top 3 show in Season 1 and to Jessica Mauboy for her rendition of Christina Aguilera&#x27;s &quot;Beautiful&quot; on the Top 10 Number 1 Hits show in Season 4. Holden&#x27;s final touchdown went to 2007 winner Natalie Gauci in the Top 4 on Big Band night during Season 5.

During Season 6, due to Holden&#x27;s departure from the judging panel, the other judges awarded &quot;touchdowns&quot; themselves. The first &quot;touchdown&quot; was delivered by Kyle Sandilands to Chrislyn Hamilton on top 12 night. She later received another on Motown night by guest judge and first series winner, Guy Sebastian. Thanh Bui received one from Marcia Hines during ABBA night and Mark Spano was also delivered one by Ian &quot;Dicko&quot; Dickson during Top 6 Rolling Stones night. Eventual winner, Wes Carr was awarded two; one by Hines and guest judge Jermaine Jackson on Michael Jackson night and another on Top 3 night by Dickson.

An alternate version of a &quot;touchdown&quot; was done by Dickson if he believes the performance was extraordinary saying &quot;big ticko from Dicko&quot;. This was used in one of Natalie Gauci&#x27;s performances and a few other performances when Holden was around.

In the first seven seasons, a &quot;touchdown&quot; did not carry any official status. However, in Season 8, during the Top 24 performances, each judge was allowed one &quot;touchdown&quot;, which put a singer immediately through to the Top 12.

==Season synopsis==

===Season 1===

When Network Ten paid $15 million for the first season of Australian Idol they anticipated it to be a critical and financial success like it had been in other countries such as the UK and the USA. When the show aired for the first time in August 2003 it was a ratings bonanza attracting diverse ranges of viewers, from people wanting the crazy auditions to people who wanted to hear great voices. The audition process went through several major cities in Australia including Sydney, Melbourne, Perth, Adelaide and Darwin. Australian Idol became the most popular TV show in the country with more ratings than major events such as the AFL Grand Final. The Grand Final at the Sydney Opera House attracted more than 3 million viewers. It was listed as the ninth highest rating TV show in Australia in the past century in 2007. The eventual winner of the competition was Guy Sebastian with Shannon Noll finishing in 2nd place.

Guy Sebastian has released ten top 10 albums, with eight reaching the top 5, including three No. 1&#x27;s.

Noll&#x27;s first single &quot;What About Me&quot; also reached No. 2 in Ireland and No. 10 in New Zealand, with his debut album peaking at No. 31 in NZ.

Paulini who came fourth has released two albums as a solo artist, One Determined Heart which reached No. 1 and gained platinum certification, and Superwoman which peaked at #77. She has also released four top 50 singles including the No. 1 &quot;Angel Eyes&quot;, a platinum seller which was nominated for highest selling single at the 2004 ARIA Awards. In 2007, Paulini was nominated for &quot;Urban Music Awards&quot; for &quot;Best R&amp;B Album&quot; &amp; &quot;Best Female Artist&quot; for &quot;Superwoman&quot;. Paulini was also a member of The Young Divas, who released two Top 10 albums and four Top 50 singles.

The other top 5 contestants in season one were Cosima De Vito who came 3rd, &amp; Rob Mills who finished in 5th place. After Idol it was these five, the Final 5, who were the most successful out of the Top 12. Other Idol contestants from Season 1 to release music were Levi Kereama, Rebekah LaVauney, Peter Ryan and Courtney Act. All of these independent acts achieved limited success.

===Season 2===

As well as the five larger cities, the judges also visited Canberra, Hobart, Darwin and Tamworth this year. Of the twelve finalists, three were from Sydney, two were from Melbourne, and one each from Brisbane, the Gold Coast, Hobart, Perth, Canberra, Adelaide and Bega.

The winner was Casey Donovan. The runners up (in descending order) were Anthony Callea, Courtney Murphy, Hayley Jensen &amp; Chanel Cole. The final two, as well as Ricki-Lee Coulter (7th), were the only contestants from the Top 12 to be signed to a record company. Callea was the highest seller of the three, with his first release &quot;The Prayer&quot; spending five consecutive weeks at No 1, and becoming the second highest selling song in Australia last decade overall and for an Australian artist. Chanel Cole and Daniel Belle teamed up under the name Spook to release an album in October 2005; a bootleg album for Chanel was also released in November 2005. Top 30 contestants Ngaiire Joseph and Marty Worrall each released a single in late 2005, and Hayley Jensen an album in September 2007. Daniel O&#x27;Connor, another of the Top 12, gained a role on &quot;Neighbours&quot;.

The Grand finale of this series remains the highest rated show out of all broadcast over the five seasons.

On a darker note, Telstra, a major sponsor of the series, made an embarrassing error when they issued a series of half-page advertisements in major newspapers congratulating Donovan on her victory, with a reference to her website. However, the address was incorrect, leading to a website about gay porn star Casey Donovan, rather than the singer&#x27;s. The company issued a prompt apology upon realising their mistake.

After this season, judge Ian Dickson left the series, later to appear in the Seven Network reality TV shows &quot;My Restaurant Rules, Dancing with the Stars&quot; and most recently, &quot;Australian Celebrity Survivor&quot;. The 2004 season was also notable for an Asian contestant named &quot;Flynn&quot;, who sang the Freestylers song &quot;Push Up&quot; after being found from a terrible audition, in the same vein as William Hung.

===Season 3===

For the first time in &#x27;Australian Idol&#x27; history there were 13 finalists. This came about during the Wildcard Verdict show on 5 September 2005. The judges initially chose James Kannis and Emily Williams to go through to the final. This left one spot which was chosen by the Australian public. Out of the remaining contestants the two that received the highest votes were Daniel Spillane and Roxane Lebrasse. With only 1% between them, Dan was announced as the final member of the Top 12. This meant Roxane had missed out yet again. The judges decided however that Roxane was too good to be left out of the Top 12 so they made it a Top 13. The catch was that two contestants were eliminated in the first round of the finals.

On 21 November 2005, the winner was announced and it was Kate DeAraugo. Kate was an outside chance to win throughout the whole season and after the show had ended Kate released a No. 1 single, a platinum selling album and a further Top 10 hit single through Sony BMG. Kate is currently working with all-girl group Young Divas, which is made up of past &quot;Idol&quot; contestants which include Paulini Curuenavuli, Jessica Mauboy and Emily Williams.
Runner up Emily Williams lost by 1% in the closest percentage ever in an &quot;Idol&quot; finale. She was originally signed to Sony BMG as a solo artist, but the agreement fell through. She is also a member of Young Divas and has had much success with them.

Lee Harding finished in third position and was signed to Sony BMG and released a # 1 single and a platinum selling album. His second single from his debut album proved to be less successful and in mid-2006 Harding was released from his contract with the label. He is currently touring and performing with Bedrock.

Dan England came 4th and didn&#x27;t score a recording contract with a major label but recorded several independent releases and has toured with Season 2 winner Casey Donovan and Season 1 runner-up Shannon Noll.

Anne Robertson who finished in sixth position was negotiating a deal with Sony BMG, but it was rumoured that Sony BMG was reluctant in signing her as they believed she was too similar to Season 1 contestant Paulini Curuenavuli who had been signed to the label for several years.
Other Idol contestants from Season 3 have released numerous independent material and have toured and performed with several bands and music groups.

Although averaging around the 1.5 million viewer mark, ratings were down by up to 40% on average during the third season compared to the first two seasons, which regularly drew more than 2.5 million viewers during the latter half of the competition. This created a serious situation for Ten, which was airing three &quot;Australian Idol&quot; shows every week at the time, and forced them to give away free commercial airtime to program sponsors expecting higher ratings. Commentators has theorised over the reasons why this has occurred, ranging from the viewing public being tired of the format due to Sandilands replacing the popular Dickson. This caused a major &quot;Idol&quot; revamp for Season 4 which meant Season 4 being one of the highest rating seasons yet.

===Season 4===

Changes for the fourth season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot; included the cancellation of &quot;Inside Idol&quot;; a &quot;streamlined&quot; semi-finals (replaced with a variant of the 12 females, 12 males format popularised by &quot;American Idol&quot;); and the contestants will be able to bring instruments with them on stage for at least one of the final shows. Also, the fourth season&#x27;s television promos promised a change in the viewer&#x27;s role in the show, revealed to be an SMS service called 199-JUDGE which allows viewers to SMS their opinions on the judges&#x27; reactions.

Damien Leith was named the winner of Australian Idol 2006 on 26 November, beating Jessica Mauboy for the title. Leith is the fifth most successful Australian Idol contestant behind Guy Sebastian, Shannon Noll, Mauboy and Anthony Callea. He has been awarded 7 platinum and one gold certification and achieved sales of 525,000+. He has the third highest album sales for a contestant. He achieved two No. 1 albums, &quot;The Winner&#x27;s Journey&quot; which sold 4× platinum and Where We Land which gained platinum certification. His first single, Night of My Life stayed at No. 1 for four consecutive weeks and was certified platinum after one week of sales. It was the fastest selling debut single for 2006. Leith won 4 ARIA No. 1 Chart Awards, and the 2007 ARIA Award peaked at No. 2, reaching gold status. His fourth album &quot;Remember June&quot; released in 2009 peaked at No. 25. In 2010 Leith released a covers album of Roy Orbison songs titled &quot;Roy&quot; which reached No. 2 and platinum certification. His sixth album &quot;Now and Then&quot; released in 2012 peaked at #12. He has also released two novels and hosted Network Ten&#x27;s television series &quot;Saving Kids&quot;.

Jessica Mauboy went on to join ex-Idol girl group Young Divas, after member from season 2, Ricki-Lee Coulter, left the group. Mauboy has since gained much success as a solo artist. Her first studio album Been Waiting peaked at No. 11, spent 59 weeks on the charts and achieved 2× platinum status. Mauboy has also enjoyed success with her singles &quot;Running Back&quot; which was certified 2× platinum and second single &quot;Burn&quot; which reached No. 1 and achieved platinum status. Her third single &quot;Been Waiting&quot; peaked at No. 12, fourth single &quot;Because&quot; peaked at No. 9 and her 5th single &quot;Up/Down&quot; peaked at #11. These three singles all reached gold certification. Her second studio album &quot;Get &#x27;Em Girls&quot; peaked at No. 6 and achieved gold certification. Five top 20 singles were released from the album, including 2 which achieved platinum and 2 double platinum certification. Mauboy has achieved 11 platinum and 5 gold certifications and received 12 ARIA Award nominations, including one win during her career as a recording artist. Third place getter Dean Geyer later released his debut album &quot;Rush&quot; and top ten single &quot;If You Don&#x27;t Mean It&quot; and starred on the Australian long-time running soap &quot;Neighbours&quot; from 2008 to 2009.

===Season 5===

Ian &quot;Dicko&quot; Dickson rejoined the show as one of the judges, along with Mark Holden, Marcia Hines and Kyle Sandilands from 2006. The series was again hosted by Andrew G and James Mathison. The show continued with the format from Season 4 where contestants could use instruments throughout the show and for their audition they could perform original material rather than covering other artist&#x27;s work.

Natalie Gauci went on to win the series, beating Matt Corby for the title. Natalie released her debut platinum selling album &quot;The Winner&#x27;s Journey&quot;. After the winner&#x27;s single &quot;Here I Am&quot; debuted at No. 2 on the ARIA Charts, and the album debuted at No. 11. Natalie released her second album in 2012.

Carl Riseley, who finished third in the contest went on to release a swing-style album titled &quot;The Rise&quot;, debuting at No. 5 on the ARIA Charts. Carl Riseley&#x27;s 2nd cd &quot;the stillest hour&quot; was released 24 April 2009 and peaked at NO#1 on the ARIA jazz chart.

===Season 6===

Changes to the Australian Idol format for season 6 include judge Mark Holden leaving the show and temporary absence of host Andrew Günsberg, and auditions held for the first time in the United Kingdom. This was also the first season where the Top 4 contestants were all male, and the second time with two male grand finalists, after Season 1 Finale with Guy Sebastian and Shannon Noll. On 23 November, Wes Carr was announced as Australian Idol for 2008, beating Luke Dickens.

===Season 7===
On 10 November 2008, it was announced that a seventh season of &quot;Australian Idol&quot; would be produced and aired in late 2009.

James Mathison announced on 31 March 2009 that he was leaving the show after six seasons. Andrew G continued hosting along with Ricki-Lee Coulter who was once again co-host.

On 1 June 2009, musical director John Foreman announced that he was also leaving the show after six seasons. Foreman&#x27;s right-hand man, David Pritchard-Blunt, was announced as his replacement.

On 3 August, Kyle Sandilands was let go as a judge on &quot;Australian Idol&quot;, after an on-air radio stunt went wrong. &quot;Australian Idol is very much a family program and its appeal is very much right across the board, and we&#x27;d like to think that all families can enjoy the program in front of the TV,&quot; &quot;Idol&quot; Executive David Mott stated on the daily news.

It was announced on 3 August 2009, via a press statement from Network Ten, that Sandilands had been sacked from &quot;Australian Idol&quot; due to this incident. He was replaced by Jay Dee Springbett, a Sony music executive.

A Network Ten spokesman said of Sandilands&#x27; firing:

&quot;Idol has remained a family-focused show, even more so this year with the 6.30 pm Sunday timeslot. His radio persona has taken on a more controversial position ... which is not in the interest of the show.&quot;
Of being fired from &quot;Australia Idol&quot;, Sandilands said in a statement that &quot;I&#x27;m disappointed at Channel Ten&#x27;s decision to remove me from Australian Idol. I have truly loved being a part of the show.&quot; Network Ten had held crisis talks with advertisers in the days prior to his firing amid concerns Sandilands would damage their brands. Idol creator Simon Fuller reportedly gave Ten his blessing to fire Sandilands. It was believed Sandilands earned $1 million of his estimated annual $2.8 million income from Idol.

The promotional commercial for the season featured various &quot;Legends&quot;. It featured impersonations of Elvis, Madonna, Michael Jackson, the Supremes, Christina Aguilera, and Mariah Carey among others. The Australian Idol hopefuls were featured covering Mariah Carey&#x27;s &quot;Emotions&quot; as the soundtrack to this commercial.

The 7th season began on 9 August at 6.30 pm. This was the first year that previously rejected contestants could return to audition again. The only ineligible contestants were those who previously made the Top 12/13. Semi-finalists (Top 24/30) had the opportunity to re-audition for the show.

Season 7 was also broadcast in New Zealand, five days after the initial airing in Australia. This marked the return of the show to New Zealand screens after a 4-year absence.


===Season 8===
In November 2020, the Seven Network announced that the show would be revived in early 2022, 13 years since it last aired. However, the revival was delayed to 2023.

On 28 September 2022, Ricki-Lee Coulter and Scott Tweedie were announced as the new hosts. Harry Connick Jr. alongside Amy Shark, Meghan Trainor and Kyle Sandilands were announced as the judging panel for the revived series. On 24 October 2022, Marcia Hines was announced as a guest judge for the season.

Filming for the auditions took place in October 2022 in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, and the Gold Coast. Filming for the top 50 took place at the Sydney Coliseum Theatre.
*19 March - all singers were up for elimination that week.

===Season 9===
In June 2023, Seven confirmed Australian Idol would return for a ninth season in 2024.

Ricki-Lee Coulter and Scott Tweedie were announced as the returning hosts. Harry Connick Jr. and Meghan Trainor will not return as judges. Amy Shark and Kyle Sandilands were confirmed as returning judges from the previous season. It was also confirmed that Marcia Hines will return as a main judge for the series, after being a member of the original seven seasons of the show. On March 24, Guy Sebastian temporarily filled in for Hines, who was sent to hospital after collapsing, but returned for results night.

Filming for the auditions took place in October 2023.
*18 March - all singers were up for elimination that week.

===Season 10===
In November 2024, Seven confirmed Australian Idol would return for a tenth season in 2025.

Ricki-Lee Coulter and Scott Tweedie were announced as the returning hosts with Amy Shark, Kyle Sandilands and Marcia Hines returning as series judges. The season began airing on 2 February 2025.

==Controversies==
===Weight comments===

After a performance, judge Ian &quot;Dicko&quot; Dickson told Paulini Curuenavuli that to wear the dress she had chosen she would need to &quot;shed some pounds&quot;. This caused outrage and heated debate. The TV show &quot;20 to 1&quot; named the controversy in an episode of its show titled &quot;Aussie Scandals&quot;. Kyle Sandilands claimed that 2005 winner, Kate DeAraugo, had &quot;tuck-shop arms&quot;.

===Hillsong voting claims===
In October 2007, criticism was levelled at the fairness of the program&#x27;s telephone voting system, where 50% of the remaining contestants were stated by the media to be members of the Hillsong Church. The 50% of remaining contestants dispute was not put to rest- when Daniel and Ben both lied and said they did not have any affiliations with the Assemblies of God, and raising concerns of vote-stacking by the church congregation.

=== Revenue generation ===
In October 2017, reporter Neil Wooldridge stated that although the producers are coy about how much was being made from SMS promotions that &quot;some commentators estimate Telstra and Network Ten, partners in the &#x27;Australian Idol&#x27; program, made up to $900,000 profit each episode.&quot;

In 2003, it was estimated that viewers cast 20 million votes. At 55 cents for each telephone call or text message, that equated to $11 million. Network Ten paid around $13 million for each season.

<doc id="372649" wikidata="Q6746084" url="?curid=372649" title="Man, Myth &amp; Magic (role-playing game)">
<text>Man, Myth &amp; Magic is a fantasy role-playing game originally published by Yaquinto Publications in 1982, now published by Precis Intermedia. 

==Gameplay==
&quot;Man, Myth &amp; Magic&quot; is set in historical times on Earth, drawing on myths and legends from 4000 BCE to 400 CE. 

Character generation is determined randomly, including nationality, race, and character traits (strength, speed, endurance, intelligence, courage, and skill). Because of the randomness of nationality and race, which can range from ancient Britain to the Far East, there is little chance that a party of adventurers will represent a historically accurate mix of characters. Combat and skill checks are made using percentile dice generating a number between 1 and 100. 

The game components are: a box containing three rulebooks (&quot;Basic Rules&quot;, &quot;Advanced Rules&quot;, and &quot;Adventures&quot;, which contained suggested scenarios), dice, blank character sheets, and adventure maps.

==Publication history==
Yaquinto Publications made a name for itself as a board wargame publisher with games like &quot;The Ironclads&quot; and &quot;Swashbuckler&quot;. But in 1982, Yaquinto decided to enter the role-playing game market with &quot;Man, Myth &amp; Magic&quot;, designed by James Herbert Brennan. This was followed by a number of adventures.

== Reception ==
Reviewers were not impressed with &quot;Man, Myth &amp; Magic&quot;.

Tony Watson, in the October–November 1982 issue of &quot;Different Worlds&quot; (#25), commented that the game offers nothing new and makes many historical errors in terms of the Emperors of Rome and the coinage used. He suggested that the game could be improved by the inclusion of a bibliography.
In the February 1983 edition of &quot;The Space Gamer&quot; (Issue No. 60), Russell Grant Collins did not recommend the game, saying, &quot;If the idea of a FRPG set in the days of the Roman Empire intrigues you, I&#x27;d recommend you create one yourself, using whatever system you like best. If Yaquinto lowered the price... then I could recommend this game; but as it is, it&#x27;s not worth it.&quot;

In the May 1983 edition of &quot;White Dwarf&quot; (issue #41), Marcus Rowland reviewed this game along with two published adventures: &quot;Adventure 1, Episode 5 - Death to Setanta&quot; and &quot;Adventure 1, Episode 6 - The Kingdom of the Sidhe&quot;. Rowland found the rules disorganized, relevant material hard to locate, and the game system too simplistic to be interesting. He gave the game and the adventures below average ratings of 5/10, 4/10 and 6/10 respectively.

In the December 1983 edition of &quot;Dragon&quot; Magazine (Issue #80), Ken Rolston found &quot;the poor game design and wordy style make the game unpleasant reading, comparing unfavorably with most other published FRP game systems.&quot; Rolston liked the idea of exploring Earth&#x27;s history, but found that the game couldn&#x27;t decide whether it wanted to be historically accurate, or a fantasy. &quot;Anyone who mistakenly buys the game expecting historical accuracy or simulation will be disappointed. It is not that there is no history at all in the game; to the contrary, there is a great deal of historically accurate material about the men, myths, and magicks of ancient Earth. The problem is that there are too many distracting anachronisms and fabrications (like a tyrannosaurus in Rome) to take the historical material seriously.&quot; Rolston concluded with a thumbs down: &quot;I&#x27;ve found no other system as disappointing... I cannot even recommend the game as an ambitious failure — there is little new or unconventional in the systems or design.&quot;

Although the game had been out of print for several years before game critic Rick Swan wrote his 1990 book &quot;The Complete Guide to Role-Playing Games&quot;, he warned that used copies abounded, and that &quot;potential buyers should be forewarned to keep their distance ... there&#x27;s nothing even remotely plausible about the concept, since Nazis can pop up in ancient Rome as easily as a mastodon might trample the soldiers at Gettysburg&quot; Swan found the character generation system &quot;absurd&quot;, and that gameplay was at the mercy of &quot;a mishmash of awkward ill-conceived game mechanics.&quot; Swan concluded by giving the game a very poor rating of only 1.5 out of 4, saying &quot;There are some nice graphics ... but they hardly justify the purchase of a game this muddled.&quot; 

In his 2014 book &quot;Designers &amp; Dragons: The 80s&quot;, game historian Shannon Appelcline noted that despite the bad reviews, this game was noteworthy as &quot;the earliest notable RPG to really take a solid look at historical roleplaying.&quot; Applecline also pointed out that &quot;Man, Myth, &amp; Magic&quot; was &quot;one of the earliest RPGs to provide truly serialized adventures&quot; and that &quot;&quot;Man, Myth &amp; Magic&quot; went further, providing tighter connections between adventures, and even cliffhangers at the end of each supplement&quot;.

<text>Indian Airlines was a state-owned airline in India that later became a division of Air India Limited before ultimately ceasing operations. It was based in Delhi and focused primarily on domestic routes, along with several international services to neighbouring countries in Asia and limited flights to the Middle East and Southeast Asia. It was a division of Air India Limited after the merger of eight pre-Independence domestic airlines.

On 10 December 2005, the airline was rebranded as Indian for advertising purposes as a part of a program to revamp its image in preparation for an initial public offering (IPO). The airline operated closely with Air India, India&#x27;s national overseas carrier. Alliance Air was a fully owned subsidiary of Indian.

In 2007, the Government of India announced that Indian Airlines would be merged into Air India Limited as its wholly owned subsidiary. As part of the merger process, a new company called the National Aviation Company of India Limited (now called Air India Limited) was established, into which both Air India (along with Air India Express) and Indian (along with Alliance Air) would be merged. Once the merger was completed on 26 February 2011, the airline – called Air India – would continue to be headquartered in Mumbai and would have a fleet of over 130 aircraft. 

==History==
===Merger of regional airlines===

The airline was set up under the &quot;Air Corporations Act, 1953&quot; with an initial capital of ₹32 million and started operations on 1 August 1953. It was established after legislation came into force to nationalise the entire airline industry in India. Two new national airlines were to be formed along the same lines as happened in the United Kingdom with British Overseas Airways Corporation (BOAC) and British European Airways (BEA). Air India took over international routes and Indian Airlines Corporation (IAC) took over the domestic and regional routes.

Eight pre-Independence domestic airlines, Deccan Airways, Airways India, Bharat Airways, Himalayan Aviation, Kalinga Airlines, Indian National Airways, Air Services of India and the domestic wing of Air India, were merged to form the new domestic national carrier Indian Airlines Corporation. International operations of Air India Ltd. was taken over by the newly formed Air India International. Indian Airlines Corporation inherited a fleet of 99 aircraft including 74 Douglas DC-3 Dakotas, 12 Vickers Vikings, 3 Douglas DC-4s and various smaller types from the seven airlines that made it up.

=== Early fleet ===

Vickers Viscounts were introduced in 1957 with Fokker F27 Friendships being delivered from 1961. The 1960s also saw Hawker Siddeley HS 748s, manufactured in India by Hindustan Aeronautics Limited, join the fleet. The jet age began for IAC with the introduction of the pure-jet Sud Aviation Caravelle airliner in 1964, followed by Boeing 737-200s in the early 1970s. April 1976 saw the first three Airbus A300 wide-body jets being introduced. The regional airline, Vayudoot, which had been established in 1981, was later reintegrated. By 1988, Airbus A320-200s were introduced. The economic liberalisation process initiated by the Government of India in the early 1990s ended Indian Airlines&#x27; dominance of India&#x27;s domestic air transport industry.

===Post liberalisation===
The Indian Government liberalised the private sector in Early 90s and with the emergence of new competitors, Indian Airlines faced tough competition from Jet Airways, Air Sahara, East-West Airlines, Skyline NEPC and ModiLuft. Yet, until 2005, Indian Airlines was the second-largest airline in India after Jet Airways while Air Sahara controlled 17% of the Indian aviation industry. During that time few other domestic carriers like East-West Airlines, Skyline NEPC and ModiLuft discontinued their flight operations.

Also, during 1993, another government-established regional feeder airline called Vayudoot was merged with Indian Airlines, but still operated as a standalone division until 1997 after which its entire flight operations were transferred to Indian Airlines and its employees absorbed into Indian Airlines and Air India.

===Low-cost carrier era===
Since 2003, the rise of low-cost domestic competitors Air Deccan, SpiceJet, IndiGo, GoAir and Kingfisher Airlines along with its low-cost arm Kingfisher Red led Indian to reduce airfares. However, as of 2006, Indian Airlines was still a profit-making airline; in fact during 2004–2005 it made a record profit of . Indian Airlines Limited was partly owned by the Government of India (51% of share capital) through a holding company and had 19,300 employees as of March 2007. Its annual turnover, together with that of its subsidiary Alliance Air, was well over (around ). Together with its subsidiary, Alliance Air, Indian Airlines carried a total of over 7.5 million passengers annually.

===Air India merger===
In 2007, the Government of India announced the merger of Air India and Indian Airlines. While the &quot;Indian&quot; branding was replaced with the Air India branding in the public eye by then, the &quot;IC&quot; and &quot;IAC&quot; codes of IATA and ICAO, respectively, and callsign &quot;INDAIR&quot; continued to be used on flights that were operated by the Airbus A320 family aircraft until 26 February 2011, when Indian Airlines ceased operating under its own brand and codes and completed its merger with Air India.

The last plane to bear the final Indian Airlines livery, an Airbus A319 registered as VT-SCF was repainted in the Air India livery in 2018.

==Destinations==
===Codeshare agreements===
Indian had codeshare agreements with the following airlines:

* Alliance Air
* GMG Airlines
* Gulf Air
* Uzbekistan Airways

== Fleet ==


As of 2007, Indian operated an all-Airbus A320 family fleet.
===Former fleet===
== Livery ==

The aircraft livery used while the company was called Indian Airlines was one of the longest in continuous use in the entire airline industry. The logo (IA) and the livery were designed by National Institute of Design, Ahmedabad. Its aircraft were mainly white, with the belly painted in light metallic grey. Above the windows, &quot;Indian Airlines&quot; was written in English on the starboard side and in Hindi on port side. The tail was bright orange, with its logo in white. In most of the aircraft, the logo was also painted on the engines over its bare metal colour. Also, when the company was under the title of Indian Airlines, to celebrate its 50th year of service the airline put the slogan &quot;50 years of flying&quot; in gold on many of their aircraft.

After the name change to Indian, the company&#x27;s aircraft sported a new look inspired by the Sun Temple at Konark in Odisha. The tail of their aircraft had a partial blue wheel since practically over half of it is cut off. The wheel is over an orange background with the carrier&#x27;s name &quot;Indian&quot; written in English on one side of the fuselage, and in Hindi on the other. On 15 May 2007, the Government of India released the new merger livery, which was sent to Boeing in Seattle to repaint all the new fleet coming into the new Air India. Most of the old fleets of Air India and Indian Airlines have also been painted in the new livery.

==Service==

Indian operated short-haul Airbus A320 family aircraft. It offered 2 classes on most sectors: Economy Class and Executive Class. Economy Class had the typical 3-3 seating of a narrow-body Airbus aircraft. Passengers were offered complimentary meals. The Executive Class seat configuration was 2-2 with a generous recline. Meals were more lavish.

* On 18 February 1969, Douglas DC-3 VT-CJH crashed on take-off from Jaipur – Sanganer Airport on a scheduled passenger flight. The aircraft was overloaded and take-off was either downwind or with a crosswind. All 30 people on board survived.
* On 21 April 1969, a Fokker F27 Friendship plane crashed in a thunderstorm while crossing East Pakistani (now Bangladeshi) airspace on its flight from Agartala to Calcutta, killing all 44 people on board.

=== 1970s ===

* On 29 August 1970, a Fokker F27 flew into high terrain near Silchar shortly after takeoff, killing the five crew members and their 34 passengers.
* On 30 January 1971, in the 1971 Indian Airlines hijacking, a Fokker F27 on a scheduled flight from Srinagar to Jammu was hijacked to Lahore by Ashraf and Hashim Qureshi, two Kashmiri terrorists. Passengers were returned to India on 2 February, but the hijackers destroyed the aircraft. India and Pakistan, blaming each other&#x27;s intelligence services, each banned the other country&#x27;s overflights and India-Pakistan flights until 1976.
* On 9 August 1971, a Vickers Viscount VT-DIX was damaged beyond economic repair when it overran the runway at Jaipur Airport. The aircraft was landed with a tailwind on a wet runway.
* On 9 December 1971, a Hawker Siddeley HS 748 near Chinnamanur was descending into Madurai when it flew into high terrain about from the airport, killing the four crew members and all 17 passengers. The accident occurred in reduced visibility during daylight hours.
* On 11 August 1972, a Fokker F27 at New Delhi lost altitude and crashed after aborting a landing. The four crew members and the 14 passengers were killed.
* On 15 March 1973, a HAL 748-224 Series 2 (VT-EAU) crashed near Begumpet Airport during a training flight, killing all three crew on board and one person on the ground. The pilots were drunk.
* On 31 May 1973, Flight 440, a Boeing 737 &quot;(registered VT-EAM)&quot;, crashed and burned during landing at New Delhi, killing five of the seven crew members and 43 of the 58 passengers.
* On 12 October 1976, Flight 171, a Sud Aviation SE 210 Caravelle, had its right engine catch fire shortly after takeoff from Bombay. The crew attempted to return, but fuel flow to the engine was not stopped. When the fire spread through the fuselage and the hydraulic system failed, the aircraft controls failed before landing. All six crew members and their 89 passengers were killed.
* On 17 December 1978, a Boeing 737-2A8 (VT-EAL) slid off the runway at Begumpet Airport following a wheels-up landing when the leading edge devices failed to deploy on takeoff, killing one of 132 on board and another three on the ground.
* On 4 August 1979, a HAL 748-224 Series 2 (VT-DXJ) aircraft was approaching Bombay Airport at night and in poor weather when it flew into high terrain approximately from the airport, killing the four crew members and their 41 passengers.

=== 1980s ===

* On 19 August 1981, Flight 557, a HAL 748 (VT-DXF) overshot the runway at Mangalore Airport in wet weather. The aircraft came to a halt just beyond the runway edge. While there were no fatalities, the aircraft was damaged beyond repair and was written off. One of the passengers on board was Veerappa Moily, the then Finance Minister of Karnataka.
* On 24 August 1984, Seven young hijackers demanded an Indian Airlines jetliner IC 421, on a domestic flight from Delhi to Srinagar with 100 passengers on board, be flown to the United States. The plane was taken to Lahore, Karachi and finally to Dubai where the defense minister of UAE negotiated the release of the passengers. This hijack was related to the secessionist struggle in the Indian state of Punjab. The hijacker was subsequently extradited by UAE authorities to India, who handed over the pistol recovered from the hijacker.
* On 29 September 1986, an Airbus A300B2-1C &quot;(registered VT-ELV)&quot; overrun the runway at Chennai International Airport during aborted takeoff caused by bird strike. None of 196 people on board were injured but the aircraft was damaged beyond repair.
* On 19 October 1988, Flight 113, a Boeing 737 &quot;(registered VT-EAH)&quot; hit an electric mast out on approach to Ahmedabad in poor visibility, killing the six crew members and all but two of the 129 passengers.

=== 1990s ===

* On 14 February 1990, Flight 605, an Airbus A320 crashed on final approach at HAL Airport, Bangalore. 92 people on board were killed and 54 survived.
* On 16 August 1991, Flight 257, a Boeing 737 &quot;(registered VT-EFL)&quot; crashed on its descent into Imphal, killing all 69 occupants. The flight operating on the Calcutta-Imphal sector crashed into Thangjing Hills, about 20 nautical miles (40 km) south-west of the Imphal airport. The aircraft had taken off from Calcutta and began a descent into Imphal airport with the visibility at that time being seven kilometers. However, the aircraft lost contact with Imphal airport on the Instrument Landing System. The search and rescue efforts were hampered by bad weather conditions and a slushy terrain. The probable cause of the accident was attributed to an &quot;error on the part of the Pilot-in-Command in not adhering to the operational flight.
* On 26 April 1993, Flight 491, a Boeing 737 &quot;(registered VT-ECQ)&quot; started its takeoff from Aurangabad&#x27;s runway 09 in hot and humid temperatures. After lifting off almost at the end of the runway, it heavily collided with a lorry on a highway at the end of the runway. The left main landing gear, left engine bottom cowling and thrust reverser impacted the left side of the truck at a height of nearly seven feet from the level of the road. Thereafter the aircraft hit the high tension electric wires nearly 3 km North-East of the runway and hit the ground, causing 63 Injuries and 55 fatalities.
* On 15 November 1993, Indian Airlines Flight 440, an Airbus A300 &quot;(registered VT-EDV)&quot; executed a missed approach at Hyderabad&#x27;s Begumpet Airport due to poor visibility, but the flaps failed to retract. After trying to solve the problem while flying in the vicinity of Hyderabad, the crew eventually diverted the aircraft to Chennai. The delay in diverting, and the need to fly slower due to the extended flaps, resulted in the aircraft running out of fuel on the way. The aircraft force-landed in a paddy field and was damaged beyond repair. All 262 people on board survived. Telugu actors Chiranjeevi and Bala Krishna and Allu Ramalingaiah survived this crash attracting widespread attention.
* On 24 December 1999, Flight 814, an Airbus A300B2-101 &quot;(registered VT-EDW)&quot; was hijacked just after taking off from Kathmandu, Nepal to Delhi. The plane flew around different points in the subcontinent and the Middle east. It finally landed in Kandahar, Afghanistan, as officials of the government of India and the Taliban negotiated. One passenger was killed and some were released. On 31 December 1999, the rest of the hostages were freed in exchange for the release of Mushtaq Ahmed Zargar, Ahmed Omar Saeed Sheikh and Maulana Masood Azhar. Indian Airlines, India&#x27;s sole domestic airline up to 1993, was hijacked 16 times, from 1971 to 1999.

<text>Eavesdropping is the act of secretly or stealthily listening to the private conversation or communications of others without their consent in order to gather information.

==Etymology==
The verb &quot;eavesdrop&quot; is a back-formation from the noun &quot;eavesdropper&quot; (&quot;a person who eavesdrops&quot;), which was formed from the related noun &quot;eavesdrop&quot; (&quot;the dripping of water from the eaves of a house; the ground on which such water falls&quot;).

An eavesdropper was someone who would hang from the eave of a building so as to hear what is said within. The PBS documentaries &quot;Inside the Court of Henry VIII&quot; (April 8, 2015) and &quot;Secrets of Henry VIII’s Palace&quot; (June 30, 2013) include segments that display and discuss &quot;eavedrops&quot;, carved wooden figures Henry VIII had built into the eaves (overhanging edges of the beams in the ceiling) of Hampton Court to discourage unwanted gossip or dissension from the King&#x27;s wishes and rule, to foment paranoia and fear, and demonstrate that everything said there was being overheard; literally, that the walls had ears.

==Techniques==
Eavesdropping vectors include telephone lines, cellular networks, email, and other methods of private instant messaging. Devices that support VoIP and other communication software are also vulnerable to electronic eavesdropping by computer viruses categorized as trojan viruses or more broadly as spyware.

==Network attacks==
Network eavesdropping is a network layer attack that focuses on capturing small &quot;packets&quot; from the network transmitted by other computers and reading the data content in search of any type of information. This type of network attack is generally one of the most effective as a lack of encryption services are used and when the connection between the two endpoints are weak and not secure. It is also linked to the collection of metadata.

== Security ==
There is a growing importance of security in communication systems, specifically in wireless technology. The need for security measures at different levels, including software encryption, hardware protection (e.g., trusted platform modules), and even the physical layer using wave-front engineering is as crucial than ever.

Researchers have expressed the importance of addressing the privacy concerns from eavesdropping attacks because they impact the rights of users and the ability to have confidence in the devices as well as the entire Internet. Ensuring that users have trust and confidence in their Internet activities so users continue to engage actively in the system and share data.

<doc id="372661" wikidata="Q8037076" url="?curid=372661" title="Worshipful Company of Saddlers">
<text>The Worshipful Company of Saddlers is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London. A Guild of Saddlers, the Company&#x27;s predecessor, is thought to have been an Anglo-Saxon Craft Guild – it certainly existed at some point in the eleventh century. The Guild became a Company when a Royal Charter of Incorporation was granted by King Edward III in 1363. The City granted the Company the right to regulate the trade of saddle-making; all saddlers in and within two miles of the City were subject to the Company&#x27;s regulations. However, the powers of the Company, which has existed on the same site at Cheapside (formerly West Chepe) since 1160, were eroded over time.

Nowadays the Company retains strong affiliations with the saddlery trade, sponsoring the Society of Master Saddlers and giving prizes for deserving young riders at equestrian events. The Company is an institution which is charitable rather than a charitable institution and it supports many good causes and sponsors scholarships at Alleyn&#x27;s School, has strong links with the Household Cavalry and the King&#x27;s Troop R.H.A. as well as with other regiments and Livery Companies traditionally involved with leather or horses.

The Company ranks twenty-fifth in the order of precedence of Livery Companies (as settled in 1515 on the Companies&#x27; economic or political power at that time). Unusually, the Saddlers Company has two mottoes: &quot;Hold Fast, Sit Sure&quot; and &quot;Our Trust Is In God&quot;. The coat of arms seen on the entrance of Saddlers&#x27; Hall, showcasing a parlfrey, two horses, a bascinet and the moto, is continued to be used in the Company&#x27;s communications.

In addition to admitting members as Freeman and Liveryman, the Saddlers&#x27; Company has the unique privilege of granting Yeoman status. Its notable Yeomen include the Princess Royal, Peter Walwyn (Chairman of the Lambourn Trainers Association), and Richard Meade.

<doc id="372662" wikidata="Q6241105" url="?curid=372662" title="John J. Keane (bishop)">
<text>John Joseph Keane (September 12, 1839 – June 22, 1918) was an Irish-born American prelate of the Roman Catholic Church. He served as the archbishop of the Archdiocese of Dubuque in Iowa from 1900 to 1911. He previously served as bishop of the Diocese of Richmond in Virginia from 1878 to 1888.

Keane was a founder of the Catholic University of America in Washington, D.C., serving as its first rector from 1886 to 1896.

==Biography==

=== Early life ===
Keane was born on September 12, 1839, in Ballyshannon, County Donegal, Ireland, to Hugh and Fannie (Connolly) Keane. He was one of five children, and the family immigrated to the United States when he was seven years old. He was educated at Saint Charles College in Ellicott City, Maryland, and at Saint Mary&#x27;s Seminary in Baltimore, Maryland.

=== Priesthood ===
On July 2, 1866, Keane was ordained a priest for the Archdiocese of Baltimore by Archbishop Martin Spalding. After his ordination, Keane was appointed curate of St. Patrick&#x27;s Parish in Washington, D.C., where he spent 12 years. He helped form both the Catholic Total Abstinence Union of America and the Catholic Young Men&#x27;s National Union in 1872, and the Carroll Society in 1873. He also established the Tabernacle Society in Washington that worked with poor parishes throughout the country.

=== Bishop of Richmond ===
On March 28, 1878, Pope Leo XIII appointed Keane as the fifth bishop of the Diocese of Richmond at age 38. He was consecrated on August 25, 1878, by Archbishop James Gibbons. Bishops John Joseph Kain and Thomas Foley were the principal co-consecrators.

As bishop, Keane established the Confraternity of the Holy Ghost, a Catholic fellowship, in the diocese. He published &quot;A Sodality Manual for the Use of the Servants of the Holy Ghost&quot; in 1880. Despite opposition, Keane founded schools and churches for Catholic African-Americans in the diocese. He addressed Protestant groups to educate them about the Catholic Church.

In 1884, Keane attended the Third Plenary Council of Baltimore in Baltimore, Maryland. The Council appointed him in May 1885 to the committee for the founding of a Catholic university in the United States.

=== Catholic University of America ===
Keane was appointed as the first rector of the Catholic University of America in 1886. He continued to serve as bishop of Richmond until August 12, 1888, when he resigned that post and was named titular bishop of &quot;Iasus&quot;.

Keane soon gained a reputation as an administrator and an orator who was widely quoted in the press. At the same time he became aligned with the more progressive wing of the Catholic hierarchy. He advocated for the Knights of Labor and took part in the Cahenslyism controversy. He promoted the quick Americanization of immigrants, the full representation of the Catholic Church at the Parliament of the World&#x27;s Religions in Chicago and his positions on the school question. His democratic and liberal policies made him enemies with conservatives in the hierarchy and at the Vatican. In 1896, Keane was forced to resign as rector of the university.

During his time as university rector, Keane was elected to the American Philosophical Society.
=== Rome ===
On January 29, 1897, Pope Leo XIII named Keane as the titular archbishop of &quot;Damascus&quot;. He travelled to Rome, spending the years 1897 to 1899 as canon of the Basilica of St. John Lateran, assistant at the pontifical throne, and counsellor to the Congregation for the Propagation of the Faith. He lived in two rooms at the Pontifical Canadian College.

Keane was attacked during the Americanism controversy &quot;as a rationalist, throwing all dogma over to modern ideas.&quot; He fought these attacks to maintain his name. In 1899, Keane was relieved of his responsibilities in Rome and was tasked to raise funds for the Catholic University of America, which was facing financial difficulties.

=== Archbishop of Dubuque ===
On July 24, 1900, Pope Leo XIII appointed Keane as the second archbishop of the Diocese Dubuque. As archbishop, he took a prominent part in the Catholic Young Men&#x27;s National Union and in the Total Abstinence Union of North America, and lectured widely on temperance, education and American institutions. He encouraged postgraduate courses and ongoing education for priests, and doubled the faculty and buildings of St. Joseph&#x27;s College in Dubuque. Keane established 12 academies for girls and two for boys in the archdiocese.

On January 15, 1902, the pope erected the Diocese of Sioux City from the western half of the archdiocese. Keane&#x27;s friend and associate at Catholic University, the Rev. Philip Joseph Garrigan, was appointed Sioux City&#x27;s first bishop. The current boundaries of the archdiocese would not be established until 1911 after Keane&#x27;s resignation.

=== Retirement ===
As his health declined, Keane petitioned Pope Pius X for the appointment of an auxiliary or a coadjutor bishop. However, Pius declined to make an appointment. Keane then submitted his resignation as archbishop of Dubuque, which the pope accepted on April 28, 1911. He was named titular archbishop of &quot;Cius&quot; at the same time. Keane was succeeded by Bishop James John Keane. The two bishops were unrelated. Some locals drew comparisons between the two men;. John Keane was called &quot;Sugar&quot; due to his kind and generous nature and James Keane was nicknamed &quot;Hickory&quot; due to his stern personality.

After his retirement, John Keane resided in the cathedral rectory in Dubuque. He died on June 12, 1918, in Dubuque. He was buried at Mount Olivet Cemetery in Key West, Iowa.

A selection from Keane&#x27;s writings and addresses was edited by Maurice Francis Egan under the title &quot;Onward and Upward: A Year Book&quot; (Baltimore, 1902). In 1939, Loras Hall at Loras College was renamed Keane Hall in honor of John and James Keane.

<doc id="372664" wikidata="Q1645579" url="?curid=372664" title="Hormoaning">
<text>Hormoaning is an extended play (EP) by the American rock band Nirvana. It was released on January 27, 1992, through DGC Records and Geffen Records. It was released in Australia and Japan only, during the band&#x27;s tour there.

==Songs==
Four of the songs on &quot;Hormoaning&quot; are covers which had not been released previously. The remaining two songs are Nirvana originals which previously appeared as B-sides to singles for &quot;Nevermind&quot;.

&quot;Aneurysm&quot; and &quot;Even in His Youth&quot;, two Nirvana originals produced and engineered by Craig Montgomery, also appear as B-sides on the &quot;Smells Like Teen Spirit&quot; single. This version of &quot;Aneurysm&quot; later appeared on disc two of the rarities box set &quot;With the Lights Out&quot; in 2004 and is different from the alternate version released on &quot;Incesticide&quot; in 1992.

The other four songs are from a Peel Session, recorded for BBC Radio on October 21, 1990. &quot;Turnaround&quot; (originally by Devo), &quot;Son of a Gun&quot; and &quot;Molly&#x27;s Lips&quot; (originally by The Vaselines) appear on the &quot;Incesticide&quot; album. &quot;D-7&quot; is a cover of the Wipers song and appears on the UK version of the &quot;Lithium&quot; single and later on disc 2 of &quot;With the Lights Out&quot; in 2004.

==Release and reception==

In Australia, 15,000 official copies were released: 4,000 on burgundy 12-inch vinyl, 10,000 on CD, and 1,000 on cassette. There were two different pressings of the Australian CD, one with a silver CD and one with a blue CD. In Japan it was released on CD in large quantities. The Australian and Japanese releases have entirely different artwork. The Australian version is considered rare due to the limited numbers. There were only two official Japanese pressings, both on CD with barely noticeable variations in artwork. The Japanese CDs were rushed out without prior consent from the US parent company, and as a result, the cover art is taken from the inside artwork of the &quot;Nevermind&quot; album. All Japanese vinyl copies were counterfeit. Counterfeit versions of the Japanese CDs also exist, and the Australian blue CD version has also been counterfeited. The Australian silver CD is the only official version of which counterfeit copies are not known to exist.

In a contemporary review for &quot;The Village Voice&quot;, Robert Christgau gave &quot;Hormoaning&quot; an &quot;A−&quot; and found it almost as good as their second album, &quot;Nevermind&quot; (1991), and far superior to their first record, &quot;Bleach&quot; (1989), particularly because &quot;without David Grohl they&#x27;re sludge monkeys&quot;. He named it the 33rd best album of 1992 in his list for the Pazz &amp; Jop, an annual poll of American critics published by &quot;The Village Voice&quot;. In a retrospective review, AllMusic&#x27;s Steve Bekkala gave the EP four out of five stars and called it &quot;a revealing entry in the catalog of the most influential rock band of the &#x27;90s&quot;.

&quot;Hormoaning&quot; was officially re-released on Record Store Day (April 16, 2011) as a 12-inch vinyl. Only 6,000 unnumbered copies were released.

<doc id="372666" wikidata="Q627749" url="?curid=372666" title="A Confederacy of Dunces">
<text>A Confederacy of Dunces is a picaresque novel by American novelist John Kennedy Toole which reached publication in 1980, eleven years after Toole&#x27;s death. Published through the efforts of writer Walker Percy (who also contributed a foreword) and Toole&#x27;s mother, Thelma, the book became first a cult classic, then a mainstream success; it earned Toole a posthumous Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1981, and is now considered a canonical work of modern literature of the Southern United States.

The book&#x27;s title refers to an epigram from Jonathan Swift&#x27;s essay &quot;Thoughts on Various Subjects, Moral and Diverting&quot;: &quot;When a true genius appears in the world, you may know him by this sign, that the dunces are all in confederacy against him.&quot;

&quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; follows the misadventures of protagonist Ignatius J. Reilly, a lazy, overweight, misanthropic, self-styled scholar who lives at home with his mother. He is an educated but slothful 30-year-old man living in the Uptown neighborhood of early-1960s New Orleans who, in his quest for employment, has various adventures with colorful French Quarter characters. Toole wrote the novel in 1963 during his last few months in Puerto Rico. It is hailed for its accurate depictions of New Orleans dialects. Toole based Reilly in part on his college professor friend Bob Byrne. Byrne&#x27;s slovenly, eccentric behavior was anything but professorial, and Reilly mirrored him in these respects. The character was also based on Toole himself, and several personal experiences served as inspiration for passages in the novel. While at Tulane, Toole filled in for a friend at a job as a hot tamale cart vendor, and worked at a family owned and operated clothing factory. Both of these experiences were later adopted into his fiction.

==Synopsis==
Ignatius J. Reilly is an overweight and unemployed thirty-year-old with a master&#x27;s degree in Medieval History who lives with his mother in New Orleans. He utterly loathes the modern world, which he feels has lost the medieval values of &quot;geometry and theology&quot;, and is fascinated with Boethius, feeling his life is influenced by Fortune&#x27;s Wheel. One afternoon Ignatius is waiting on the street for his mother. He is dressed in a green hunting cap, voluminous tweed trousers, a red plaid flannel shirt and a muffler. Officer Angelo Mancuso approaches Ignatius because he reckons he looks like a suspicious character and demands that he produce identification. Affronted and outraged by Mancuso&#x27;s unwarranted zeal and officious manner, Ignatius protests his innocence to the crowd while denouncing the city&#x27;s vices and the graft of the local police. An elderly man, Claude Robichaux, takes Ignatius&#x27; side, denouncing Officer Mancuso and the police as communists. Mrs. Reilly arrives and demands that Mancuso arrest Robichaux as the cause of the disturbance. In the resulting uproar, Ignatius and his mother escape, taking refuge in the Night of Joy, a bar and strip club, in case Officer Mancuso is still in pursuit.

At the police station Robichaux meets Burma Jones, a young black man who also was wrongly arrested, he claims, but seems resigned to his fate. The Sergeant tells Mancuso off for arresting Robichaux and punishes him for his uselessness by making him start to wear a different costume every day on the beat, beginning with a ballerina outfit.

At the Night of Joy the bar owner arrives and throws Ignatius and his mother out, saying they are bringing the tone of the place down. Mrs. Reilly has drunk too much. As a result, she crashes her car. The compensation she owes for the accident totals $1,020, a sizable amount of money in early 1960s New Orleans. Ignatius is forced to work for the first time in many years in order to help his mother pay the debt.

At the police station, Jones is told he must get a job or be arrested for vagrancy. He reluctantly starts work as a janitor at the Night of Joy. The owner can get away with paying him below the minimum wage and treating him badly because Jones knows if he loses the job, he will be in jail. The only way he can fight back, he decides, is to try to sabotage the business if opportunities occur.

Darlene, the bar hostess, has an ambition to perform there as a stripper, and has devised an act involving her pet cockatoo. She has trained the cockatoo to pull off rings that hold her costume together.

Ignatius answers an ad for a position in the office at the Levy Pants factory, run by an absentee but henpecked Gus Levy. Here he performs no useful work, but does arbitrarily throw away several entire file cabinet drawers full of important files. He sends an insulting letter to a complaining customer on official stationery over the owner&#x27;s signature. He carries out a regular and aggressive correspondence with his college friend Myrna Minkoff in New York. She criticizes his self-centered lifestyle and urges him to join her in radical political agitation. To impress Myrna, Ignatius tries (unsuccessfully) to incite the black workforce at the pants factory into a violent demonstration for better pay.

Dismissed from this job, he chances into employment pushing a hot dog cart. He makes no sales and spends most of his time consuming the stock himself. His boss insists that he wear a pirate outfit to try to entice trade from tourists in the Latin Quarter.

Ignatius gets the idea that universal peace could be brought about by inciting gay men to encourage all the homosexuals in the armed forces to declare themselves, and substitute love making for warfare. To this end he attends a wild gay party in the Latin Quarter looking for recruits to his cause, but when he begins to harangue the guests he is thrown out.

He arrives at the Night of Joy to find Jones at the door dressed as a plantation slave and Darlene about to have her opening night stripping as a Southern Belle character. Jones urges him in, hoping that trouble will ensue. When Darlene takes to the stage her cockatoo spies the gold pirate earring dangling from Ignatius’s ear and flies at it, causing chaos. Ignatius spills out into the street and is rescued by Jones from being hit by a passing bus. Ignatius faints.

As the novel nears its end, Fortune&#x27;s Wheel turns. The Night of Joy&#x27;s owner and her accomplice are arrested for pornography, Darlene is offered a new job due to the sensation, Gus Levy is vindicated against his berating wife, and Officer Mancuso is vindicated for his detecting work.

When Ignatius gets home, his mother has had enough and phones for an ambulance to take him away to the mental hospital, leaving for her own safety. Just then Myrna arrives at the door, having come from New York to rescue Ignatius from his lifestyle. Ignatius urges her to drive him away right then, and on the road they pass the ambulance heading to Mrs. Reilly&#x27;s house.

==Major characters==

===Ignatius J. Reilly===
Ignatius Jacques Reilly is something of a modern Don Quixote—eccentric, idealistic, and creative, sometimes to the point of delusion. In his foreword to the book, Walker Percy describes Ignatius as a &quot;slob extraordinary, a mad Oliver Hardy, a fat Don Quixote, a perverse Thomas Aquinas rolled into one&quot;. He disdains modernity, particularly pop culture. The disdain becomes his obsession: he goes to movies in order to mock their perversity and express his outrage with the contemporary world&#x27;s lack of &quot;theology and geometry&quot;. He prefers the scholastic philosophy of the Middle Ages, and the early medieval philosopher Boethius in particular. However, he also enjoys many modern comforts and conveniences and is given to claiming that the rednecks of rural Louisiana hate all modern technology, which they associate with unwanted change. The workings of his pyloric valve play an important role in his life, reacting strongly to incidents in a fashion that he likens to Cassandra in terms of prophetic significance.

Ignatius is of the mindset that he does not belong in the world and that his numerous failings are the work of some higher power. He continually refers to the goddess Fortuna as having spun him downwards on her wheel of fortune. Ignatius loves to eat, and his masturbatory fantasies lead in strange directions. His mockery of obscene images is portrayed as a defensive posture to hide their titillating effect on him. Although considering himself to have an expansive and learned worldview, Ignatius has an aversion to ever leaving the town of his birth, and frequently bores friends and strangers with the story of his sole, abortive journey out of New Orleans, a trip to Baton Rouge on a Greyhound Scenicruiser bus, which Ignatius recounts as a traumatic ordeal of extreme horror.

===Myrna Minkoff===
Myrna Minkoff, referred to by Ignatius as &quot;that minx,&quot; is a Jewish beatnik from New York City, whom Ignatius met while she was in college in New Orleans. Though their political, social, religious, and personal orientations could hardly be more different, Myrna and Ignatius fascinate one another. The novel repeatedly refers to Myrna and Ignatius having engaged in tag-team attacks on the teachings of their college professors. For most of the novel, she is seen only in the regular correspondence which the two sustain since her return to New York, a correspondence heavily weighted with sexual analysis on the part of Myrna and contempt for her apparent sacrilegious activity by Ignatius. Officially, they both deplore everything the other stands for. Though neither of them will admit it, their correspondence indicates that, separated though they are by half a continent, many of their actions are meant to impress one another.

===Irene Reilly===
Mrs. Irene Reilly is the mother of Ignatius. She has been widowed for 21 years. At first, she allows Ignatius his space and drives him where he needs to go; however, over the course of the novel she learns to stand up for herself. She also has a drinking problem, most frequently indulging in muscatel, although Ignatius exaggerates that she is a raving, abusive drunk.

She falls for Claude Robichaux, a dim but fairly well-off man with a railroad pension and rental properties. At the end of the novel, she decides she will marry Claude. But first, she agrees with Santa Battaglia (who has not only recently become Mrs. Reilly&#x27;s new best friend, but also harbors an intense dislike for Ignatius) that Ignatius is insane and arranges to have him sent to a mental hospital.

===Others===
*Santa Battaglia, a &quot;grammaw&quot; who is friends with Mrs. Reilly and has a marked disdain for Ignatius
*Claude Robichaux, an old man constantly on the lookout for any &quot;communiss&quot; who might infiltrate the United States; he takes an interest in protecting Irene 
*Angelo Mancuso, an inept police officer, the nephew of Santa Battaglia, who, after an abortive attempt to arrest Ignatius as a &quot;suspicious character,&quot; features prominently in the novel as Ignatius&#x27;s self-perceived nemesis 
*Lana Lee, a fiery and abusive owner who runs the &quot;Night of Joy&quot;, a downscale French Quarter strip club, and who secretly doubles as a pornographic model
*George, Lana&#x27;s distributor and accomplice, a young dropout who sells photographs of her to high-school children
*Darlene, a goodhearted but none-too-bright bar girl, who aspires to be a &quot;Night of Joy&quot; stripper with a pet cockatoo
*Burma Jones, an irascible black janitor for the &quot;Night of Joy&quot; who holds on to his below-minimum wage job only to avoid being arrested for vagrancy
*Mr. Clyde, the frustrated owner of Paradise Vendors, a hot dog vendor business, who inadvisedly employs Ignatius as a vendor
*Gus Levy, the reluctant, mostly absentee owner of Levy Pants, an inherited family business in the Bywater neighborhood where Ignatius briefly works
*Mrs. Levy, Gus&#x27;s henpecking wife, who attempts to psychoanalyze her husband and Miss Trixie despite being completely unqualified to do so
*Miss Trixie, an aged clerk at Levy Pants who suffers from dementia and compulsive hoarding
*Mr. Gonzalez, the meek office manager at Levy Pants
*Dorian Greene, a flamboyant French Quarter homosexual from the Midwest who puts on elaborate parties
*Frieda Club, Betty Bumper, and Liz Steele, a trio of aggressive lesbians who run afoul of Ignatius
*Dr. Talc, a mediocre professor at Tulane who had the misfortune of teaching Myrna and Ignatius
*Miss Annie, the disgruntled neighbor of the Reillys who professes an addiction to headache medicine

==Ignatius at the movies==
Toole provides comical descriptions of two of the films Ignatius watches without naming them; they can be recognized as &quot;Billy Rose&#x27;s Jumbo&quot; and &quot;That Touch of Mink&quot;, both Doris Day features released in 1962. In another passage, Ignatius declines to see another film, a &quot;widely praised Swedish drama about a man who was losing his soul&quot;. This is most likely Ingmar Bergman&#x27;s &quot;Winter Light&quot;, released in early 1963. In another passage, Irene Reilly recalls the night Ignatius was conceived: after she and her husband viewed &quot;Red Dust&quot;, released in October 1932.

==&quot;Confederacy&quot; and New Orleans==
The book is famous for its rich depiction of New Orleans and the city&#x27;s dialects, including Yat. Many locals and writers think that it is the best and most accurate depiction of the city in a work of fiction.

A bronze statue of Ignatius J. Reilly is located under the clock on the down-river side of the 800 block of Canal Street, New Orleans, the former site of the D. H. Holmes Department Store, now the Hyatt French Quarter Hotel. The statue mimics the opening scene: Ignatius waits for his mother under the D.H. Holmes clock, clutching a Werlein&#x27;s shopping bag, dressed in a hunting cap, flannel shirt, baggy pants and scarf, &#x27;studying the crowd of people for signs of bad taste.&#x27; The statue is modeled on New Orleans actor John &quot;Spud&quot; McConnell, who portrayed Ignatius in a stage version of the novel.

Various local businesses are mentioned in addition to D. H. Holmes, including Werlein&#x27;s Music Store and local cinemas such as the Prytania Theater. Some readers from elsewhere assume Ignatius&#x27;s favorite soft drink, Dr. Nut, to be fictitious, but it was an actual local soft drink brand of the era. The &quot;Paradise Hot Dogs&quot; vending carts are an easily recognized satire of those actually branded &quot;Lucky Dogs&quot;.

==Structure==
The structure of &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; reflects the structure of Ignatius&#x27;s favorite book, Boethius&#x27; &quot;The Consolation of Philosophy&quot;. Like Boethius&#x27; book, &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; is divided into chapters that are further divided into a varying number of subchapters. Key parts of some chapters are outside of the main narrative. In &quot;Consolation&quot;, sections of narrative prose alternate with metrical verse. In &quot;Confederacy,&quot; such narrative interludes vary more widely in form and include light verse, journal entries by Ignatius, and also letters between himself and Myrna. A copy of &quot;The Consolation of Philosophy&quot; within the narrative itself also becomes an explicit plot device in several ways.

==The difficult path to publication==
As outlined in the introduction to a later revised edition, the book would never have been published if Toole&#x27;s mother had not found a smeared carbon copy of the manuscript left in the house following Toole&#x27;s 1969 death at 31. She was persistent and tried several different publishers, to no avail.

Thelma repeatedly called Walker Percy, an author and college instructor at Loyola University New Orleans, to demand for him to read it. He initially resisted; however, as he recounts in the book&#x27;s foreword:
The book was published by LSU Press in 1980. It won the Pulitzer Prize for Fiction in 1981. In 2005, Blackstone Audio released an unabridged audiobook of the novel, read by Barrett Whitener.

While Tulane University in New Orleans retains a collection of Toole&#x27;s papers, and some early drafts have been found, the location of the original manuscript is unknown.

==Adaptations==
In March 1984, LSU staged a musical adaptation of the book, with book and lyrics by Frank Galati and music by Edward Zelnis; actor Scott Harlan played Ignatius.

Kerry Shale read the book for BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Book at Bedtime&quot; in 1982, and later adapted the book into a one-man show which he performed at the Adelaide Festival in 1990, at the Gate Theatre in London, and for BBC Radio.

There have been repeated attempts to turn the book into a film. In 1982, Harold Ramis was to write and direct an adaptation, starring John Belushi as Ignatius and Richard Pryor as Burma Jones, but Belushi&#x27;s death prevented this. Later, John Candy and Chris Farley were touted for the lead, but both of them, like Belushi, also died at an early age, leading many to ascribe a curse to the role of Ignatius.

Director John Waters was interested in directing an adaptation that would have starred Divine, who also died at an early age, as Ignatius.

British performer and writer Stephen Fry was at one point commissioned to adapt Toole&#x27;s book for the screen. He was sent to New Orleans by Paramount Studios in 1997 to get background for a screenplay adaptation.

John Goodman, a longtime resident of New Orleans, was slated to play Ignatius at one point.

A version adapted by Steven Soderbergh and Scott Kramer, and slated to be directed by David Gordon Green, was scheduled for release in 2005. The film was to star Will Ferrell as Ignatius and Lily Tomlin as Irene. A staged reading of the script took place at the 8th Nantucket Film Festival, with Ferrell as Ignatius, Anne Meara as Irene, Paul Rudd as Officer Mancuso, Kristen Johnston as Lana Lee, Mos Def as Burma Jones, Rosie Perez as Darlene, Olympia Dukakis as Santa Battaglia and Miss Trixie, Natasha Lyonne as Myrna, Alan Cumming as Dorian Greene, John Shea as Gonzales, Jesse Eisenberg as George, John Conlon as Claude Robichaux, Jace Alexander as Bartender Ben, Celia Weston as Miss Annie, Miss Inez &amp; Mrs. Levy, and Dan Hedaya as Mr. Levy.

Various reasons are cited as to why the Soderbergh version has yet to be filmed. They include disorganization and lack of interest at Paramount Pictures, Helen Hill the head of the Louisiana State Film Commission being murdered, and the devastating effects of Hurricane Katrina on New Orleans. When asked why the film was never made, Will Ferrell has said it is a &quot;mystery&quot;.

In 2012, there was a version in negotiation with director James Bobin and potentially starring Zach Galifianakis.

In a 2013 interview, Steven Soderbergh remarked &quot;I think it&#x27;s cursed. I&#x27;m not prone to superstition, but that project has got bad mojo on it.&quot;

In November 2015, Huntington Theatre Company introduced a stage version of &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; written by Jeffrey Hatcher in their Avenue of the Arts/BU Theatre location in Boston, starring Nick Offerman as Ignatius J. Reilly. It set a record as the company&#x27;s highest-grossing production.

==Critical reception==

On November 5, 2019, the &quot;BBC News&quot; included &quot;A Confederacy of Dunces&quot; on its list of the 100 most inspiring novels. It is sometimes considered one of the funniest American novels ever written.

<text>Colonel George Francis Robert Henderson, CB (2 June 1854 – 5 March 1903) was a British Army officer and author best known for writing &quot;Stonewall Jackson and the American Civil War&quot; (1898).

== Early life ==
Henderson was born in Saint Helier, Jersey on 2 June 1854. His father was William George Henderson, later Dean of Carlisle, and Jane Melville Dalyell, Educated at Leeds Grammar School, of which his father was headmaster, he was early attracted to the study of history, and obtained a scholarship at St John&#x27;s College, Oxford. But he soon left the university for Sandhurst, from where he was commissioned into the British Army&#x27;s 84th Regiment of Foot in 1878.

== Military service ==
After a few months service in India, he was promoted to the rank of lieutenant and returned to England, and in 1882 he went on active service to Egypt, fighting in the battles of Kassassin and Tel el-Kebir. During this time, he received numerous citations for bravery in combat, being promoted to captain in 1886. In 1885 he was seconded to the Ordnance Store Department. In 1889 appeared (anonymously) his first work, &quot;The Campaign of Fredericksburg&quot;. In the same year he became Instructor in Tactics, Military Law and Administration at Sandhurst. From this post he proceeded as Professor of Military Art and History to the Staff College (1892–1899), and there exercised a profound influence on the younger generation of officers. His study on the Battle of Spicheren had been begun some years before. Then in 1898 appeared, as the result of eight years work, his masterpiece: &quot;Stonewall Jackson and the American Civil War&quot;.

== Later life and death ==
In the Second Boer War, Henderson served with distinction on the staff of the Commander-in-Chief, Lord Roberts, as Director of Intelligence, and was promoted to lieutenant-colonel on 23 December 1899. He received the local rank of colonel whilst in South Africa only weeks later, on 10 January 1900. In a despatch dated 31 March 1900, Lord Roberts wrote that Henderson gave him &quot;valuable and reliable information regarding the physical features of the country and the disposition of the enemy&quot;.

But overwork and malaria broke his health, and he had to return home in January 1902, being eventually selected to write the official history of the war. Failing health obliged him to go to Egypt, where he died at Assuan on 5 March 1903. He had completed the portion of the history of the South African War dealing with the events up to the commencement of hostilities, amounting to about a volume, but the War Office decided to suppress this, and the work was restarted by Sir F. Maurice.

== Legacy ==
Various lectures and papers by Henderson were collected and published in 1905 by Captain Malcolm, D.S.O., under the title &quot;The Science of War&quot;; to this collection a memoir was contributed by Lord Roberts.

<text>The Australian pied cormorant (Phalacrocorax varius), also known as the pied cormorant, pied shag, or great pied cormorant, is a medium-sized member of the cormorant family. It is found around the coasts of Australasia. In New Zealand, it is usually known either as the pied shag or by its Māori name of . Older sources may refer to it as the &quot;yellow-faced cormorant&quot;.

==Taxonomy==
The Australian pied cormorant was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it in the genus &quot;Pelecanus&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Pelecanus varius&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;pied shag&quot; from Queen Charlotte Sound, New Zealand, that had been described in 1785 by English ornithologist John Latham in his book &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham had based his own description on a specimen in the Leverian Museum and on a watercolour by Georg Forster that belonged to Joseph Banks. Forster had accompanied James Cook on his second voyage to the Pacific Ocean. The Australian pied cormorant is now one of 12 species placed in the genus &quot;Phalacrocorax&quot; that was introduced in 1760 by the French zoologist Mathurin Jacques Brisson.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;P. v. hypoleucos&quot; (Brandt, JF, 1837) – coastal and inland Australia (except central-south) and Tasmania
* &quot;P. v. varius&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1789) – coastal North, South and Stewart Island (New Zealand)

== Description ==

The pied cormorant is predominantly black on its back and upper surface of the wings and white on the underside with males weighing approximately 2.2 kg and females 1.7 kg. It stands between 65–85 cm tall, with a wingspan of 110–130 cm. A small yellow patch between the bill and the eye on each side of the head is likely to have been the reason for the historical common name. It has large webbed feet which it utilises to pursue fish underwater, steering with half opened wings. The bird has a large hooked bill, green eyes with a blue eye ring and black legs and feet. The eyes have a special nictitating membrane for underwater protection. The pied cormorant can often be seen spreading its wings after diving to help dry the feathers, as it has inadequate waterproofing. This lack of feather waterproofing may help the cormorant spend longer underwater due to decreased buoyancy effects.

The two subspecies have slight differences in physical characteristics. Similar species include the black-faced cormorant (slightly smaller) and the little pied cormorant (substantially smaller).

==Distribution and habitat==
The pied cormorant is listed of least concern in the IUCN red list of threatened species, reflecting its large range with a relatively stable population.

In New Zealand its range on the east coast extends as far south as Christchurch, though this is a recent extension—older books report it no further south than Kaikōura. The range extensions have accompanied population recovery from heavy persecution in the early 1900s and likely represents recolonization of the former range. The pied cormorant is listed as Nationally Vulnerable in New Zealand. The population has been growing from around 700 breeding pairs in the 1950s to an estimated 3,000 pairs post 2000 (Refer to population trend data).

In Australia it is only moderately common in the eastern states (both the coast and inland wetlands), but abundant in the south-west, particularly along the coast. Its federal conservation status is &#x27;secure&#x27; and only changes to &#x27;near threatened&#x27; in Victoria. It can be found in all states except Tasmania. The pied cormorant has been calculated to be at high-moderate risk from fishing – particularly from set and inshore drift nets. Birds in colonies can often be observed entangled in recreational fishing line with hooks embedded in the body. In the past, the pied cormorant was seen as competition for commercial fishing and sometimes shot.

Although typically found in marine habitat—sometimes solitary, sometimes in pairs, sometimes in vast flocks of hundreds or thousands—it is also attracted to inland waters, including lakes, deep and open wetlands, and rivers. In Australia, the birds can often be found at inland waterways while in New Zealand it prefers coastal areas close to its prey. Adult birds are sedentary and can often be seen roosting in trees, on rocks or logs in the water. The birds seem unaffected by variable salinity, turbidity and shoreline vegetation provided there are available perches.

==Behaviour and ecology==

=== Feeding ===
The pied cormorant appears to feed largely (90%) on benthic fish 6–15 cm in length from waters less than 10m deep. King George Whiting juveniles are known to be eaten. Other dietary components (10%) are made up of crustaceans such as prawns and shrimp with some molluscs and cephalopods. It will dive both in shallow, still water and in rapidly moving currents. Typical dive times are around 40 seconds, with a recovery period of 10–15 seconds between dives although this is dependent on depth. The birds feed in deep and shallow waters (although shallow habitats are more productive) with flock densities in proportion to the prey abundance.

Hunting is typically performed as individuals (potentially to avoid kleptoparasitism), although larger groups can be observed when schools of small fish are close to the surface. Risk of predation by sharks and the abundance of food comprise a trade-off where the pied cormorant may choose to hunt in deeper waters where prey is less abundant if the risk is too high during warmer months when sharks are present more often. The deeper waters however require longer dive times and corresponding longer times at rest between dives on the surface.

=== Breeding ===

The pied cormorant preferably breeds in small (&lt;30 pairs) sheltered colonies (harbours, estuaries and lakes) with rarer occurrences on exposed coasts or islands, no more than 400 metres from the sea (or food source). Courtship behaviour is initiated by the male in close proximity to a future nest site. Wing waving by the male is conducted in silence while gargling can be a form of female recognition. The males can also hop up to 1 m in the air with both feet to attract female attention.

Nests are typically large platforms formed of sticks and foliage cemented with droppings averaging 80 cm in diameter on the ground or in trees. Males collect most of the nest material, while both sexes share construction tasks. The nests are used twice a year in Autumn and Spring by different breeding pairs. Some breeding occurs in summer and winter by young and inexperienced pairs.

Monogamous breeding pairs (from 2 years of age) lay eggs once a year with an average breeding cycle of 6 months. Clutch size ranges from 2–5 with an incubation period of 25–33 days. Egg and fledgling caring duties are shared by the parents. Chick rearing can take from 47–60 days with independence gained just over 3 months of age. Both sexes share feeding duties through incomplete regurgitation.

=== Dispersal ===
Banding studies have shown that the pied cormorants do not travel far from their colonies (&lt;20 km). Flight is generally low in altitude, as the pied cormorant has weaker flight capability than other species in the family, with &#x27;v&#x27; formations present when in flocks.

== Noongar culture ==
The Noongar Aboriginal people who live in the south-west corner of Western Australia believe that the pied cormorant (&quot;medi&quot;) is responsible for the transport of souls of the deceased across and beneath the Western sea to their final resting place (&quot;Kurannup&quot;). &quot;Medi&quot; can be translated as &#x27;agent&#x27;, or &#x27;medium&#x27;, possibly referring to the bird&#x27;s role as an intermediary between the living world and the afterlife. Spirits of the deceased rest for an unspecified time on the &quot;moojar&quot; (WA Christmas tree) before being carried by easterly winds or flowing waters to the sea where the spirit joins with the &quot;medi&quot; for its journey to &quot;Kurranup&quot;.

<text>The Wishkah River is a tributary of the Chehalis River in the U.S. state of Washington. Approximately long, the river drains a remote rural area of approximately in Grays Harbor County along the Washington coast north of Aberdeen. It flows south through the county and empties into the Chehalis at Aberdeen.

The name &quot;Wishkah&quot; is an adaptation of the Chehalis word &quot;hwish-kahl&quot;, meaning &quot;stinking water&quot;.

==Association with Nirvana==

While living under a bridge on the river after dropping out of high school and being kicked out of the family home, Nirvana frontman Kurt Cobain wrote the song &quot;Something in the Way&quot; about the experience. According to biographer Charles R. Cross, however, this was largely a myth created by Cobain. One third of Cobain&#x27;s ashes were scattered in the river after his death. &quot;From the Muddy Banks of the Wishkah&quot; is a live album released by Nirvana on October 1, 1996, two and a half years after Cobain&#x27;s death.

<doc id="372672" wikidata="Q383486" url="?curid=372672" title="Relics (album)">
<text>Relics (subtitle: A Bizarre Collection of Antiques &amp; Curios) is a 1971 compilation album by English rock band Pink Floyd. The album was released in the UK on 14 May 1971 and in the US on the following day. Initially released by Starline, the compilation was reissued by Music for Pleasure in the UK, while Harvest and Capitol distributed the album in the US. A remastered CD was released in 1996 with a different album cover, picturing a three-dimensional model based on the sketch drawn by drummer Nick Mason for the album&#x27;s initial release.

==Release==
The release of &quot;Relics&quot; occurred because the band&#x27;s record company, EMI, were concerned that they had gone into the studio to record what would become &quot;Meddle&quot; without any songs or ideas, effectively starting from scratch. This, combined with their ever-increasing touring schedule, made EMI realise that no new product would be released for some time, possibly not until well over a year after completing their previous album, &quot;Atom Heart Mother&quot;. In order to issue some more &quot;product&quot; for fans, they decided to release a budget priced LP on their Starline label, combining early singles, B-sides, album tracks and one unreleased song, &quot;Biding My Time&quot;. The compilation contains material from the first three albums: &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot;, &quot;A Saucerful of Secrets&quot; and &quot;More&quot;.

&quot;Relics&quot; has been re-released on numerous occasions, and at times without the proper authority. One such incident involved EMI Australia releasing the album on CD in 1987 without the band&#x27;s consent. This led to the LP being withdrawn and, as a result, the album became a rarity. &quot;Relics&quot; was made readily available again when it was officially issued on CD in 1996.

&quot;Relics&quot; was reissued again on CD on 17 June 2016, featuring the original sketch artwork cover and containing the same mastering as the 1996 edition.

==Mixes==
&quot;Relics&quot; was most noted for its inclusion of the band&#x27;s first two Syd Barrett-era hit singles, &quot;Arnold Layne&quot; and &quot;See Emily Play&quot;. Due to the lack of available stereo masters, both tracks were reprocessed into Duophonic stereo for the album&#x27;s original release (the 1996 CD release reverts to the original mono mixes). Also included were the B-sides of the three follow-up singles, with the tracks &quot;Paint Box&quot;, &quot;Julia Dream&quot; and &quot;Careful with That Axe, Eugene&quot; appearing in true stereo. &quot;Relics&quot; has the only CD release of &quot;Paint Box&quot; that has the same length (3:33) that the original single version had; on the albums &quot;The Early Singles&quot; (1992, part of &quot;Shine On&quot;), &quot;1967: The First Three Singles&quot; (1997), and the 40th anniversary edition of &quot;The Piper at the Gates of Dawn&quot; (2007), it fades out about 13 seconds later.

The album was not a definitive collection of non-album material, as several single A-sides were omitted (&quot;Apples and Oranges&quot;, &quot;It Would Be So Nice&quot; and &quot;Point Me at the Sky&quot;), as well as one B-side (&quot;Candy and a Currant Bun&quot;). Until this was rectified with the release of &quot;The Early Singles&quot; (1992), it was left to the 1970 compilation &quot;The Best of the Pink Floyd&quot; (also known as &quot;Masters of Rock&quot;) and bootlegs such as &quot;The Dark Side of the Moo&quot; to plug the gap on LP.

== &quot;Biding My Time&quot; ==
The album also includes a previously unreleased studio recording of a Roger Waters song, &quot;Biding My Time&quot;. The song, originally titled &quot;Afternoon”, had been heard by live audiences as part of the &quot;Man and the Journey&quot; concert sequence. Following the sessions for &quot;Ummagumma&quot;, it was reworked as &quot;Biding My Time&quot;, before being held over for two years until the release of &quot;Relics&quot;. Unusually, Wright plays trombone on this track.

==Cover and machine==
The album cover was designed by drummer Nick Mason, and was inspired by his time studying architecture at the Regent Street Polytechnic. In 2008, Mason sold a limited edition of 195 signed prints of this cover.

In addition to variations on the original design, the album was released in several countries with different artwork. The four-eyed face on the original US album cover was an antique bottle opener.

When the album was released on CD, former Hipgnosis partner Storm Thorgerson had a real-life version of the contraption on the cover made and presented it to Mason. It is still in Mason&#x27;s office. Both Thorgerson and his assistant, Peter Curzon, came up with the idea after viewing the head sculpture which appeared on the album sleeve of &quot;The Division Bell&quot;, constructed by John Robertson.

While the 2016 CD reissue by Pink Floyd Records reverted to the original sketch cover, it also contains photographs of the three-dimensional object inside the booklet.

In May 2019, for the 48th anniversary of the album&#x27;s release, Nick Mason&#x27;s official Twitter account, as well as the official Pink Floyd Facebook page, posted a fan made animation of the original cover art. This animated tribute was made by Scandinavian artist Alex Teglbjærg, Artist on the border. The animation was used by Nick Mason&#x27;s Saucerful of Secrets for the Echoes tour of 2022. It was used as the backdrop for the performance of the final song Bike.

<text>Edward Wightman (1566 – 11 April 1612) was an English radical Anabaptist minister, executed at Lichfield on charges of heresy; he was the last person to be burned at the stake in England for such a crime.

==Life==
Edward Wightman was born in 1566. He attended Burton Grammar School and entered the clothiers business of his mother&#x27;s family. Eventually, he served an apprenticeship as a woollen draper in the town of Shrewsbury. He married Frances Darbye of Hinckley in 1593 and settled in Burton upon Trent. Apart from his mercer&#x27;s business in Burton he also became a minister of the local Anabaptist church.

===Case of Thomas Darling===
Wightman became involved with the Puritans and in 1596 was chosen as one of the leaders assigned to the investigation of demonic possession of 13-year-old Thomas Darling. This suggests that by the mid-1590s Wightman was an important and well-respected public figure, taking part in the newly formed movement that began to hold sway over Burton&#x27;s society and politics. His involvement in the Darling case proved a turning point in his life, making him entirely amenable to the possibility of unmediated spiritual intervention. Darling claimed not just to be possessed by the devil, but engaged in a series of &#x27;spiritual wars&#x27; in which both demonic and angelic voices were said to emanate from him:

As I know at this present for a certainty, that I have the spirit of God within me: so do I with the like certainty believe, that in my dialogues with Satan, when I [quoted] sundry places of scripture, to withstand the temptations he assaulted me with: I had the spirit of God in me, and by that spirit resisted Satan at those times, by [quoting] the scriptures to confound him.

===Religious persecution===
Wightman&#x27;s adoption of &quot;heresy&quot; commenced with his understanding of the mortality of the soul, adopting the &quot;soul sleep&quot; view of Martin Luther. In one of his early public messages he preached that &quot;the soul of man dies with the body and participates not either of the joys of Heaven or the pains of Hell, until the general Day of Judgment, but rested with the body until then&quot;.

Between 1603/4 and 1610/11, he became more active and vocal. According to court records, he was a prolific writer, although none of his writings have been found to date. He came to the attention of the local church authorities and a warrant for his arrest was issued. The order instructed the constables of Burton to immediately bring him before the Bishop of Lichfield Richard Neile (or Neale) for interrogation.

===Condemned by King James I===
Wightman set about putting together a compendium of his theology for his upcoming hearing and defence. Perhaps thinking that he would at least be allowed time to plead his case, he delivered copies of it to members of the clergy in an effort to shore up support but, perhaps as a last resort, he delivered a copy to King James I, a move that would ultimately seal his fate. No copy survives.

James I came to the English throne in 1603, &quot;thinking himself a competent judge of religious questions and disposed to take seriously his title of &#x27;Defender of the Faith&#x27;&quot;. Since 1607 he had been engaged in a battle of books with Roman Catholic apologists over the Oath of Allegiance, both personally and by encouraging others to write in his defence. &quot;One of the central planks of the king&#x27;s case was the preservation of his catholic orthodoxy through his adherence to the three great creeds of the church, the Apostles&#x27;, the Nicene and the Athanasian&quot;.

Wightman was fully aware of the king&#x27;s firmly orthodox stance, yet he set about to combat both his State and Church. Of the handful of fragments of his defence treatise that have survived, he refers to the doctrine and &quot;heresies of the Nicolaitan;... most of all hated and abhorred of God himself ... the common received faith contained in those three inventions of man, commonly called the Three Creeds ... the [Apostles&#x27;], Nicene and Athanasius Creed, which faith within these 1600 years past hath prevailed in the world&quot;.

Wightman had by now isolated himself from all orthodox groups, calling into question many tenets of orthodox belief, arguing &quot;that the baptizing of infants is an abominable custom ... the practice of the Sacraments as they are now used in the Church of England are according to Christ his Institution ... [and affirming that] only the sacrament of baptism [is] to be administered in water to converts of sufficient age of understanding converted from infidelity to the faith&quot;.

However what finally spelled his end was his public rejection of Trinitarianism. It was presumably on these points that he so vehemently rejected the formulae of the Nicene Creed of 325 and the Athanasian Creed of 381. He claimed that the doctrine of the Trinity was a total fabrication, stating that Christ was only a man &quot;and a mere Creature and not both God and man in one person... [Although this did not mean that Christ was a man like all others but] only a perfect man without sin&quot;. King James was by now more set than ever in securing the execution of Wightman, since in the intervening years he had launched a dual campaign against heresy at home and abroad.

===Summary of charges by the Commission===
Edward Wightman&#x27;s examination and hearing was addressed in 16 points:
#That there is no Trinity;
#That Jesus Christ is not God, perfect God and of the same substance, eternity and majesty with the Father in respect of his God-head;
#That Jesus Christ is only man and a mere creature and not both God and man in one person ; 
#That Christ was never incarnate and did not fulfill the promise that the seed of the woman shall break the serpents head;
#The person of the Holy Ghost is not God, co-equal, co-eternal and co-essential with the Father and the Son; 
#That the three creeds of the apostolic church are the heresies of the Nicolaitanes;
#That he, Edward Wightman, is the prophet spoken of in Deuteronomy 18 in the words &quot;I will raise them up a prophet&quot; and in Isaiah &quot;I alone have trodden the wine press&quot; and in that place &quot;Whose fan is in his hand&quot;;
#That he was the Holy Spirit, the Comforter spoken of in John 16;
#That the words of Jesus on the sin of blasphemy against the Holy Spirit refer to him;
#That the fourth of Malachi refers to his person (the prophecy of Elijah);
#That the soul and body does sleep and this sleep is the first death, and that the soul and body of Jesus did also sleep in the sleep of death;
#That the souls of the elect departed (that is dead) are not in heaven; 
#That the baptizing of infants is an abominable custom;
#That the practice of the Church of England in reference to the Lord’s Supper and baptism are incorrect and baptism of water should be administered only to those with sufficient age and understanding; 
#That God has ordained and sent him, Edward Wightman, to do his part in the work of the Salvation of the world, (to admonish the heresy of the Nicolaitanes); in comparison to Christ, who was sent to save the world and by his death to deliver it from sin and to reconcile it to God;
#That Christianity is not wholly professed and preached in the Church of England, but only in part.

===Trial and execution===
Wightman&#x27;s trial was played out against the backdrop of the so-called &quot;Vorstius Affair&quot;, involving the intense opposition on the King&#x27;s part to block the appointment of the German academic Conrad Vorstius to the University of Leiden. Vorstius was being accused of atheism, Arianism and heretical opinions about the Holy Spirit.

After months of being subjected to a series of conferences with &quot;learned divines&quot;, Wightman was finally brought before Bishop Neile for the last time. According to Wightman, the Bishop told him &quot;that unless I did recant my opinions he would burn me at a stake in Burton before Allholland day next&quot;. The final verdict and list of charges included &quot;the wicked heresies of Ebion, Cerinthus, Valentinian, Arius, Macedonius, Simon Magus, Manichees, Photinus, and of the Anabaptists and other arch heretics, and moreover, of other cursed opinions belched by the instinct of Satan&quot;.

He was ordered to be placed &quot;in some public and open place below the city aforesaid [and] before the people burned in the detestation of the said crime and for manifest example of other Christians that they may not fall into the same crime&quot;.

When he was finally brought to the stake his courage left him, and as the fires were lit he is said to have quickly cried out to recant and was pulled from the fire, although by then he had been &quot;well scorched&quot;. Two or three weeks later he was again brought before the courts and, no longer fearing the searing flames, refused and &quot;blasphemed more audaciously than before&quot;. The King quickly ordered his final execution, and on 11 April 1612, he was once more led to the stake.
[Wightman] was carried again to the stake where feeling the heat of the fire again would have recanted, but for all his crying the sheriff told him he should cost him no more and commanded faggots to be set to him whence roaring, he was burned to ashes.
===Aftermath===
In the months that followed Wightman&#x27;s execution, a number of religious radicals nearly met the same fate, even though the downfall of the bishops and abolition of the High Commission in 1640–2 did not bring about any changes to the constitution:
The act of the Long Parliament which abolished the Court of High Commission used such very general words that, if it did not abolish the old ecclesiastical courts, it practically deprived them of their power. At the Restoration, however, by statute passed in 1661 (13 Car II, c. 12) it was &quot;explained&quot; that this was not the desired result; the Court of High Commission was not to be re-established, but the old ecclesiastical jurisdiction of the ecclesiastical courts was to be exercised as of old.
On 2 May 1648, a new &#x27;Ordinance for the Punishment of Blasphemies and Heresies&#x27; was created, &quot;principally those of the triune God, the resurrection, the last judgment, and that the Bible is the Word of God...relapse is to be punished as felony with death without benefit of clergy&quot;. Opposition from Independents and sectaries, however, meant that the ordinance was never enforced. Only with the passage of the Ecclesiastical Jurisdiction Act 1677 (&quot;forbidding the burning of heretics&quot;) was Wightman&#x27;s position in history &quot;as the last person in England to be burned at the stake for heresy&quot; secured.

Mention of his case came almost 100 years later by a handful of writers in the wake of the Toleration Act 1688. The only immediate result was that of a minority opposition to his execution, a shift in public opinion which may have led to a relative decline in the practice.

James I seemed to have lost faith in this method of discouraging heresy (his actions owed more to a thaw in his private attitude to Roman Catholics than to any feelings about the impropriety or inadvisability of burning heretics) and seeing that heresy still survived, &quot;publicly preferred that heretics hereafter, though condemned, should silently and privately waste themselves away in the prison rather than to grace them, and amuse others, with the solemnity of a public execution&quot;.

===Legacy===
Edward Wightman was the last person in England to be burned at the stake for heresy. The anti-Trinitarian Bartholomew Legate had been burned in London three weeks earlier. 

==Family==
Little is known about the subsequent fate of Edward Wightman&#x27;s wife and children. It is known, however, that one son, John, was born on 7 January 1599 in Burton. John&#x27;s son, George (1632–1722) emigrated to North Kingston, Rhode Island, in 1660.

<text>Aniello Falcone or Ancillo Falcone&quot;&quot; (15 November 16001656) was an Italian Baroque painter, active in Naples and noted for his painted depictions of battle scenes.

==Biography==

Born in Naples to a tradesman, he showed his artistic tendency at an early age. He first received some instruction from a relative, before becoming a pupil of José de Ribera.

He is best known for his battle scenes, their subjects taken from both biblical and secular history, and was nicknamed &quot;L&#x27;Oracolo delle Battaglie&quot;. He gained an international reputation; his works attracted the attention of the Flemish dealer and collector Gaspar Roomer, who sold his work across Europe, and he was one of the artists commissioned by Philip IV of Spain to paint a series of scenes from ancient Roman history for the Buen Retiro palace. He also painted various religious subjects such as the signed and dated &quot;Rest on the Flight to Egypt&quot; of 1641 (Naples Cathedral) and his frescoes for the chapel of Sant&#x27; Agata In S. Paolo Maggiore, Naples of around the same time.

The attribution of his battle scenes is complicated by the similarity of those of his pupil Andrea di Leone, with which they have often been confused.

During the insurrection against Spanish rule led by Masaniello in 1647, he resolved to be bloodily avenged for the death, at the hands of two Spaniards, of a nephew and of a pupil in the school of art which he had established in Naples. Salvator Rosa, Carlo Coppola, among others, and he formed an armed band called the &quot;Compagnia della Morte&quot; (&quot;Company of Death&quot;).

When the revolt was crushed, Falcone and Rosa made off to Rome, where Borgognone noticed the works of Falcone, and became his friend, and a Frenchman induced him to go to France, where Louis XIV became one of his patrons. Ultimately Jean-Baptiste Colbert obtained permission for the painter to return to Naples, where he died during the plague of 1656.

Two of his battle pieces are preserved in the Louvre and in the Naples museum; he painted a portrait of Masaniello, and engraved a few plates. His pupils included Salvator Rosa and Carlo Coppola, Domenico Gargiulo (known as Micco Spadaro), Paolo Porpora and Andrea di Lione.

<text>Anton Reinhard Falck (19 March 1777 in Utrecht16 March 1843 in Brussels) was a Dutch statesman.

He studied at the University of Leiden, and entered the Dutch diplomat service, being appointed to the legation at Madrid, Spain. Under King Louis Napoleon he was secretary-general for foreign affairs, but resigned from office due to the annexation of the Batavian Republic of France. He took a leading part in the revolt of 1813 against French domination, and was instrumental in the organization of the new kingdom of the Netherlands by drafting the Eight Articles of London which laid the foundation.

As minister of education under William I he reorganized the universities Ghent, Leuven and Liège, and the Royal Academy of Brussels. Side by side with his activities in education he directed the departments of trade and the colonies.

In the Netherlands Falck was called the king&#x27;s &#x27;good genius&#x27;, but William I tired of his counsels and he was superseded by Van Maanen. He was an ambassador in London when the disturbances of 1830 convinced him of the necessity of the separation of Belgium from the Netherlands. He consequently resigned from his post and lived in close retirement until 1839, when he became the first Dutch minister at the Belgian court. He died at Brussels on 16 March 1843. Besides some historical works he left a correspondence of considerable political interest.

<text>Kaikōura (; ) is a town on the east coast of the South Island of New Zealand, located on State Highway 1, north of Christchurch. The town has an estimated permanent resident population of as of . Kaikōura is the seat of the territorial authority of the Kaikōura District, which is part of the Canterbury region.

Kaikōura was first inhabited by the Māori, with the Ngāi Tahu iwi occupying the area since at least 1670. Europeans began to settle in Kaikōura in the mid 1840s. By the 1850s, land that had been acquired was sold to European settlers who most often started sheep farms in the area. Mount Fyffe in the Seaward Kaikōura Range is named in honour of Robert Fyffe and his family, the first European settlers in the area.

The infrastructure of Kaikōura was heavily damaged in the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake, with one of the two deaths near the town. The bay and surrounding region were uplifted by as much as . In 2023, Kaikōura was named as one of the &quot;most beautiful small towns in the world&quot;. Kaikōura is known for its biodiversity, a wide variety of marine mammals can be seen in the sea, including whales and dolphins.

==History==

=== Early Māori history ===
Māori have long been resident in Kaikōura and archaeological evidence of moa bones indicates that they hunted moa there. After the moa numbers declined, Kaikōura was still an attractive place to live because of its abundance of sea food. The Ngāi Tahu &quot;iwi&quot; have been resident in the Kaikōura area since at least 1670. Numerous pā sites are located around Kaikōura. The numbers vary between 14 and 40.

Captain James Cook saw Kaikōura in 1770 but did not land there. He reported seeing four double hulled canoes approaching HMS &quot;Endeavour&quot; containing 57 Māori.

In 1827–1828, Kaikōura was the site of the battle of Niho Maaka, between musket-armed Ngāti Toa (led by Te Rauparaha) and the Ngāti Kurī people of Ngāi Tahu. Several hundred Ngāi Tahu were killed or captured. Ngāi Tahu were surprised by the Ngāti Toa raiding party, as they were expecting a visit from the Ngāti Kahungunu sub-tribe Tū-te-pākihi-rangi, with whom they were friends. Only those Ngāti Kurī who fled to the hills survived. The name of the battle comes from a threat made by Rerewaka, one of the Kaikōura chiefs, who said he would slit Te Rauparaha&#x27;s belly with a shark tooth () if he came south.

=== Whaling stations ===
A whaling station was first established by Robert Fyffe in 1842 at Kaikōura. The Fyffe family was the first European family to settle in Kaikōura. John Guard and his family joined Fyffe sometime between 1844 and 1846. 40 men were employed at the whaling station initially. In 1845, he purchased a second whaling station at South Bay. This second whaling station (Fyffe&#x27;s Village) became the commercial centre of Kaikōura until 1867. Fyffe diversified into shipping and farming due to the decline in whale numbers. The &quot;Marlborough Express&quot; newspaper commented in 1866 that &quot;whales seemed to have abandoned coming to Kaikōura&quot;. The whaling stations continued until 1922.

Mount Fyffe owes its name to the Fyffe family. The cottage that the Fyffe family lived in, built in 1842, still stands. The area surrounding the house, including Avoca Point, has been listed as a Historic Area by Heritage New Zealand. The construction of the cottage is unusual in that the supporting foundations of the house are made of whalebone.

=== European settlement ===
The New Zealand government purchased land north of Kaikōura from Ngāti Toa in 1847. This was challenged by Ngāi Tahu who said that Ngāti Toa had no right to sell land that did not belong to them. In 1857, the New Zealand Government made an offer for land between the Ashley and Waiau Uwha rivers for 200 pounds which was signed by Ngāi Tahu. Other land deals were completed in the area leaving small reserves for local Māori. These reserves were reduced after 1900 when the New Zealand government compulsorily acquired further land for the proposed railway and &quot;scenic&quot; purposes.

From the 1850s, land that had been acquired was sold to European settlers who most often started sheep farms in the area. Many small blocks were sold around the Kaikōura Peninsula and in the 1870s roads and bridges were built. A small wharf was completed in 1863. The Inland Kaikōura Road to Rotherham was completed by 1888. The road that became State Highway 1 was started in the 1890s across the Hundalee Hills with bridges across the rivers completed in 1914. From around 1900, a total of 59 Norfolk pines were planted along the Esplanade. These trees now have &quot;protected trees&quot; status from the Kaikōura District Council.

=== 20th century ===
The population increased as a result of the extensive works required to build the railway in 1935. In December 1945, the Christchurch to Picton railway line was officially opened at Kaikōura. 5,000 people came out to celebrate the occasion. The population fell slightly after the railway was completed. In 1962 the roll-on/roll-off car ferry between Wellington and Picton increased travel between the North and South Islands, bringing more visitors to Kaikōura. There was only one motel (with 40 beds) prior to 1962.

Between 1945 and 1960, over-fishing led to a decline in the numbers of crayfish (spiny lobsters). By 1975 the decline in crayfish numbers had extended to other fish species. In 1975 there were 97 registered fishing vessels operating out of Kaikōura. There are reports that between 1963 and 1964, 248 sperm whales in Kaikoura waters were killed during the last of the whaling activity in New Zealand.

Kaikōura struggled economically during the 1970s. In 1975 there were 304 motel beds and a further 500 camp ground beds and hotel beds. The Marlborough Regional Development Council noted that there was investment in accommodation but not in tourist attractions at this time. The restructuring of the economy following the election of the Labour government in 1984 also affected Kaikōura adversely. Farm incomes dropped. Public sector employment was affected badly. There were 170 jobs lost in a town of 3,000.

In 1985 a group of local Kaikōura people established a tourist centre, and began promoting Kaikōura as a tourist destination. The focus at that stage was on the walking opportunities and the scenery. Whale-watching was established as a tourist venture in Kaikōura in 1987. Local Māori leaders were concerned about local unemployment, and mortgaged their houses to buy a boat to start up a whale watching business to see the local sperm whales. In the first year of business, 3,000 tourists took the opportunity to see whales. This has greatly expanded to more than 100,000 per annum.

=== 2016 Kaikōura earthquake ===

On 14 November 2016, a 7.8-magnitude earthquake struck the South Island just after midnight. It left two people dead (one near the town and one in the adjacent Hurunui District) and triggered a small tsunami. One thousand tourists and hundreds of residents were stranded in Kaikōura after the earthquake cut off train and vehicle access. New Zealand Air Force helicopters ferried many people out of Kaikoura initially with the New Zealand navy sending HMNZS &quot;Canterbury&quot; to ferry many hundreds of tourists out.

1700 construction workers completed two million man hours to repair the quake-damaged route along State Highway 1 after the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake. It reopened on 15 December 2017. The repairs included fixing almost of damaged road and a similar length of railway line. The repairs cost NZ$1.1 billion.

==Geography==

The stretch of coastline stretching roughly between the mouths of the Conway and Waiau Toa / Clarence Rivers is generally known as the Kaikōura coast. This coast is unusual for the South Island east coast, as there is very little coastal plain, with the Seaward Kaikōura Range, a branch of the Southern Alps, rising straight from the ocean.

The town of Kaikōura has the Seaward Kaikōuras as a backdrop. One of the walking tracks for visitors is the Mt. Fyffe track, which winds up Mt. Fyffe, and gives a panoramic view of the Kaikōura peninsula from the summit.

The Kaikōura Peninsula extends into the sea south of the town, and the resulting upwelling currents bring an abundance of marine life from the depths of the nearby Kaikōura Canyon. The town owes its origin to this effect, since it developed as a centre for the whaling industry. The name &quot;Kaikōura&quot; means &#x27;meal of crayfish&#x27; (&quot;kai&quot; – food/meal, &quot;kōura&quot; – crayfish) and the crayfish industry still plays a role in the economy of the region. However Kaikōura has now become a popular tourist destination, mainly for whale watching and swimming with or near dolphins.

===Climate===

==Governance==
The town is the seat of the territorial authority of the Kaikōura District, which is part of the Canterbury region. Local governance for Kaikōura is provided by the Kaikōura District Council (Ko te kaunihera ā rohe o Kaikōura). The council consists of a mayor and seven councillors. Elections for positions on the council are held every three years in conjunction with nationwide local elections. Kaikōura was the first local authority in the Southern Hemisphere to achieve recognition by the EarthCheck Community Standard. 

For national elections, Kaikōura is part of the Kaikōura electorate. Stuart Smith of the National Party was the current member of parliament after the 2020 election.

==Demographics==
Kaikōura is defined by Statistics New Zealand as a small urban area and covers . It had an estimated population of as of with a population density of people per km2.
Kaikōura had a population of 2,223 at the 2018 New Zealand census, an increase of 213 people (10.6%) since the 2013 census, and an increase of 21 people (1.0%) since the 2006 census. There were 873 households, comprising 1,107 males and 1,116 females, giving a sex ratio of 0.99 males per female. The median age was 47.7 years (compared with 37.4 years nationally), with 318 people (14.3%) aged under 15 years, 354 (15.9%) aged 15 to 29, 981 (44.1%) aged 30 to 64, and 573 (25.8%) aged 65 or older.

Ethnicities were 83.3% European/Pākehā, 19.6% Māori, 0.8% Pasifika, 5.0% Asian, and 3.1% other ethnicities. People may identify with more than one ethnicity.

The percentage of people born overseas was 18.2, compared with 27.1% nationally.

Although some people chose not to answer the census&#x27;s question about religious affiliation, 48.2% had no religion, 40.6% were Christian, 1.3% had Māori religious beliefs, 0.3% were Hindu, 0.3% were Muslim, 0.5% were Buddhist and 2.0% had other religions.

Of those at least 15 years old, 231 (12.1%) people had a bachelor&#x27;s or higher degree, and 447 (23.5%) people had no formal qualifications. The median income was $30,200, compared with $31,800 nationally. 189 people (9.9%) earned over $70,000 compared to 17.2% nationally. The employment status of those at least 15 was that 969 (50.9%) people were employed full-time, 315 (16.5%) were part-time, and 30 (1.6%) were unemployed.

==Economy==
In 2020, the GDP of the Kaikōura District was $232 million, with an annual growth for the region of 1.6%. Tourism is a major contributor to the economy of the district. There was a significant downturn in visitors caused by 2016 earthquake, with the COVID-19 pandemic creating a further impact in 2020–21. However, by 2024, tourism activity in the town had rebounded. 

Tourism contributed $57 million to total GDP in Kaikoura District in 2020, and was the top overall category, contributing 24.8% of district GDP. In 2023, tourism provided 27.6% of jobs in Kaikōura District in 2023, with accommodation and food services representing another 18.5%.

In addition to ecotourism activities in the town such as whale, seal and bird watching, further tourism opportunities are under development. These include astrotourism, following the accreditation of the Kaikōura District as an International Dark Sky Sanctuary, and the construction of a long-distance trail from Picton to Kaikōura known as the Whale Trail.

==Culture==
In Māori mythology, Kaikōura Peninsula (Te Taumanu-o-te-waka-a-Māui) was the seat where Māui sat when he fished the North Island (Te Ika-a-Māui) up from the depths of the sea.

The tangata whenua of Kaikōura and all of the Kaikōura District are Te Runanga o Ngāi Tahu, and they hold customary tribal authority over this entire area (rohe). Takahanga Marae, a &quot;marae&quot; (tribal meeting ground) of Ngāi Tahu and its &quot;Te Rūnanga o Kaikōura&quot; branch, is located in Kaikōura. The current marae building was opened in 2001. It includes the Maru Kaitatea &quot;wharenui&quot; (meeting house). Cliff Whiting was one of many Māori and Pākehā artists who contributed carving and artworks for the wharenui.

== Biodiversity ==
The economy of the town now has a significant reliance on the visitors who come to experience the biodiversity of the local region, particularly the ocean. The Kaikōura canyon is a submarine canyon located southwest of the Kaikōura Peninsula. It is a southern branch of the Hikurangi Trough that extends northwards up the New Zealand east coast. The canyon has been described as a &quot;bio-diversity hotspot&quot;, where upwelling of currents from the deep ocean provide feeding grounds along the Kaikōura coast for a diverse range of seabirds and marine mammals.

An incorporated society, Te Korowai o Te Tai o Marokura, Kaikōura Coastal Marine Guardians (Te Korowai) was formed in 2005 to develop use and protection strategies and actions for the Kaikōura coast. The work of the society led to the passing of the Kaikōura (Te Tai o Marokura) Marine Management Act in August 2014. This Act established the Kaikōura marine management area, including a new marine reserve, sanctuaries and protections for whales and fur seals, and established new fishing regulations. It also recognised taiapure (traditional Māori fishing grounds which include areas of special cultural or spiritual significance).

===Hikurangi Marine Reserve===
The Hikurangi Marine Reserve is a marine reserve off the Kaikōura coast, covering an area of south of the township, and including part of the Kaikōura canyon. The reserve was established in 2014, and is the largest and deepest marine reserve adjacent to any of New Zealand&#x27;s three main islands. No fishing, harvesting or mining is allowed in the reserve.

=== Kaikōura whale sanctuary ===
The Kaikōura (Te Tai o Marokura) Marine Management Act 2014 established the Te Rohe o Te Whānau Puha Whale Sanctuary covering , and extending north and south of the Kaikōura peninsula and out to sea, to provide additional protection for marine mammals in this area.

=== Marine mammals ===
A wide variety of marine mammals can be seen in the Kaikōura region, including whales, dolphins, and New Zealand fur seals. The Marine Mammals Protection Act 1978 provides legal protection for these animals, and regulations set conditions that govern human behaviour in the vicinity of marine mammals. Permits are required for commercial tourist operations associated with marine mammals.

==== Whales ====
Whale watching is a popular tourist attraction for Kaikōura, and is an important contributor to the local economy. Sperm whales can be observed all year, typically around 23 km offshore, but sometimes closer to shore. Humpback whales are often seen in June and July during their winter migration, and orca can be seen from December to March.

==== Dolphins ====
Several species of dolphin can be seen in the waters off Kaikōura, including Dusky dolphins, and the endangered Hector&#x27;s dolphin.

=== Seabirds ===
New Zealand has an unusually high diversity of shags, penguins, petrels and albatross species, leading to claims that the country is the &quot;seabird capital of the world&quot;. Some of these seabird species are in significant decline, and many are critically endangered. Notable seabirds that are seen off Kaikōura include:
* fourteen species of albatross: Wandering, Antipodean, Northern royal, Southern royal, Black-browed, Campbell, White-capped, Salvin&#x27;s, Chatham, Buller&#x27;s, Atlantic yellow-nosed, Indian yellow-nosed, Light-mantled, Sooty
* ten species of petrel: Cook&#x27;s, Grey-faced, Cape, Black, White-chinned, Westland, Grey, White-headed, Mottled, Soft-plumaged
* seven species of shearwater: Buller&#x27;s, Sooty, Hutton&#x27;s, Fluttering, Short-tailed, Flesh-footed, Pink-footed 
* four species of skua: Arctic, Pomarine, Long-tailed, Brown
* four species of storm petrel: White-faced, Wilson&#x27;s, Grey-backed, Black-bellied
* four species of penguin: Little, Yellow-eyed, Erect-crested, Chinstrap
* two species of giant petrel: Southern Giant Petrel, Northern Giant Petrel

Other notable seabirds observed off Kaikōura include: Antarctic fulmar, Fairy Prion, Grey Phalarope, Black-billed gull, Arctic tern, Black-fronted tern and Common diving petrel. Also regularly seen are Pied shags, Little shag, Spotted shag, Australasian gannet, Southern black-backed gull, Red-billed gull, White-fronted tern.

From a local conservation perspective, particularly notable seabirds in the Kaikōura region include the Hutton&#x27;s shearwater, the Red-billed gull, and the Little penguin.

==== Hutton&#x27;s shearwater ====

The Hutton&#x27;s shearwater (&quot;Puffinus huttoni&quot;) or Kaikōura tītī is an endangered seabird in the family Procellariidae. It is found in waters around Australia and New Zealand but it only breeds in the Seaward Kaikōura Range in New Zealand. It is the only seabird in the world that breeds in an alpine environment. Nests have been found at elevations from 1200 to 1800metres. The Kowhai Valley and Shearwater Stream Important Bird Area contains the only two remaining alpine breeding colonies. An artificial colony was established in a protected area on the Kaikōura peninsula as a conservation measure, after six other colonies were wiped out by feral pigs. The birds fly at night, but can become disoriented by bright lights. Fledglings are particularly vulnerable, and can crash-land on roads in the town. They are usually unable to take off again, making them vulnerable to being run over by vehicles or succumbing to predation by dogs or cats. Conservation organisations in Kaikōura rescue stranded birds for later release, and advocate for reduced lighting.

==== Red-billed gull ====

The Red-billed gull also known as tarāpunga, is native to New Zealand. The Kaikōura peninsula has one of the three largest breeding colonies of these gulls, but the local population is in significant decline. In contrast, there has been an increase in the population of Red-billed gulls at the breeding colony at Otago Peninsula, where there is control of mammalian predators.

==== Little penguin ====
The Little penguin or kororā is found along the Kaikōura coastline. These birds are vulnerable to becoming entangled in fishing nets, and while on land are vulnerable to vehicle impact and predation by rats and domestic dogs. In a recent survey of 75km of Kaikōura coastline, the only breeding colony located was in fragmented areas around the southern part of the Kaikōura peninsula.

=== Shorebirds ===
==== Banded dotterel ====
The double-banded plover, known in New Zealand as the banded dotterel or pohowera, is a species of bird in the plover family that nests on stony beaches around the Kaikōura peninsula and South Bay. The species is listed as Nationally Vulnerable. Breeding success of banded dotterels at Kaikōura has been severely affected by predation from cats. A community-driven action plan is being developed to protect the habitat of nesting shorebirds at South Bay, with support from Environment Canterbury, Kaikōura District Council, University of Canterbury and Te Rūnanga o Kaikōura.

== Dark Sky Sanctuary ==

An initiative was launched in 2022 to achieve international recognition of a dark-sky preserve in the Kaikōura area. The intention was to reduce the problems that lighting causes for Hutton&#x27;s shearwaters. The Kaikōura District Council had already modified streetlighting, to reduce the risk to the birds. In April 2022, the Mayor of Kaikōura said that the dark-sky reserve initiative had the full support of the council, and would be a boost to tourist numbers, especially during the winter period. The Kaikōura Dark Sky Trust applied to DarkSky International for designation of an International Dark Sky Sanctuary in August 2024, and the designation was announced on 11 September 2024. The sanctuary covers an area of , representing around 98% of the Kaikōura District, excluding the Kaikōura township. The Trust plans to apply for the Kaikōura township to be recognised with international dark sky community status.

==Infrastructure==
The rebuild after the 2016 earthquake replaced or upgraded many of Kaikoura District Council&#x27;s assets. These included replacing the oldest water mains built in the 1920s and many roads. This has left Kaikōura better placed financially in 2021 than many councils, as they do not have to replace these in the next 30 years as part of their long term planning.

=== Hospital ===
Funding was announced in 2013 to rebuild the 100 year old Kaikoura Hospital. It was completed in April 2016. The new building provides space for general practice, physiotherapy, dental, optometry as well as maternity, radiology and medical/trauma stabilisation and resuscitation facilities. It cost $13.4 million to complete.

=== Kaikōura Civic Centre ===

The Kaikōura Civic Centre was completed in 2016. It has a distinctive large &quot;cray pot&quot; on the outside of the building which represents Kaikōura&#x27;s connection to the sea. It contains offices for the Kaikōura District Council, Kaikōura Library and Kaikōura Museum. A third floor was approved by the Kaikōura District Council in 2011 and the cost rose which led to complaints from rate payers and submissions to the Long Term Plan in 2012 requesting restraint in spending. Long term, finances for the Kaikōura District Council have been suggested to be tenuous.

=== Hotel ===
A $35 million 4.5 star hotel was due to open in September 2021, but work was delayed due to the loss of international tourists because of the COVID-19 pandemic. It is expected to have 118 bedrooms and provide economic stimulus to Kaikōura. It later opened in October 2022.

== Transport ==

=== Road transport ===
State Highway 1 passes through the town.

===Air===
Kaikōura also has a small sealed airstrip located 6 km south of the main centre. Kaikoura Airport is mainly used for whale spotting tourist flights but it can also be used by small private and charter flights. It previously had return flights to Wellington and Christchurch operated by Sounds Air. A new service to Wellington has since been started with Air Kaikoura.

===Rail===

Kaikōura is served by the Main North Line, the northern section of the South Island Main Trunk Railway. The line opened north of Kaikōura on 13 March 1944, while the line south of the town opened on 15 December 1945, the latter completing the full line Christchurch to Picton.

Kaikōura is served by the Coastal Pacific long-distance passenger train, formerly called the TranzCoastal, which connected the town with Christchurch to the south, Picton and the Cook Strait ferries to the north. Kaikoura Station was the last station in New Zealand to have a refreshment room for passengers, which closed in 1988 when the Coastal Pacific Express (former name for the TranzCoastal) introduced on-board refreshments.

Freight trains also pass through the town, mainly carrying freight between the marshalling yards at Middleton in Christchurch and the Interislander rail ferries at Picton.

The Main North Line (Picton to Christchurch, passing through Kaikōura) suffered damage in the November 2016 earthquake and was closed for repairs, re-opening to freight traffic on 15 September 2017. The Coastal Pacific resumed running once all repairs were completed in mid 2018.

=== Mayfair Theatre ===

The Mayfair Theatre is an art deco building on the Esplanade that was first opened in 1935 as a venue for cinema and concerts. In 1985, the building was put up for sale and by 1986, it had been purchased for the town as a result of a community fundraising initiative.

The building was damaged beyond repair in the 2016 Kaikōura earthquake, but community fundraising efforts resulted in the construction of a new cinema and performance venue on the site, retaining the 1934 art deco façade. After a $3.6 million restoration project, the building was re-opened in November 2020 as the Mayfair Arts and Culture Centre Te Whare Toi ō Kaikōura. As well as two movie screens, it has space for art exhibitions.

<text>Tour d&#x27;Afrique is one of the longest bicycle expeditions in the world. It is organised by TDA Global Cycling, a Canadian company based in Toronto. It runs each year from January to May, from Cairo to Cape Town. The participants are expedition riders who cover each day at their own pace, stopping in the villages and roadside cafes. There are about 20 rest days. The organisers prepare three meals every day and transport tents and other equipment the riders need for the night stops.

The 2003 Tour d&#x27;Afrique set a Guinness World Record for fastest crossing of Africa by bicycle and this was achieved by nine participants of the race, Michael Kennedy, Chris Evans, Dave Genders (all from the United Kingdom), Paul Reynaert (Belgium), Jeremy Wex, Steve Topham, Scotty Robinson, Andrew Griffin (all from Canada) and Sascha Hartl (Austria). The 2008 Tour d&#x27;Afrique did not cross Kenya due to the political situation and reported violence.

The race component of the Tour d&#x27;Afrique was suspended after 2017, with the event continuing as an annual cycling expedition.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Cordwainers is one of the Livery Companies of the City of London. Cordwainers were workers in fine leather; the Company gets its name from &quot;cordwain&quot; (cordovan), the white leather produced from goatskin in Cordova, Spain. All fine leather makers, including Girdlers and Glovers, were originally classified as cordwainers; however, the term eventually came to refer only to fine leather footwear, including boots.

The Cordwainers&#x27; Company, which received the right to regulate City trade in 1272, obtained a Royal Charter of incorporation in 1439. The status of the Company as a trade association has lessened over the years; the Company is now, as are most other Livery Companies, a charitable body. Other leather-linked Livery Companies, which enjoy close relations with the Cordwainers include the Curriers, Leathersellers, Saddlers, Girdlers and Glovers.

The Company ranks twenty-seventh in the order of precedence of Livery Companies and is the highest ranked one without its own Livery Hall. The Company&#x27;s motto is &quot;Corio et Arte&quot;, Latin for &quot;Leather and Art&quot;.

The livery hall of the Cordwainers, Cordwainers&#x27; Hall, though rebuilt several times, stood at the same site near St. Paul&#x27;s Churchyard from 1316 until its final destruction in the London blitz in 1941. The livery hall was not rebuilt after the war. However, a window was removed from the hall for safekeeping in 1939. Thus surviving the destruction of the hall in 1941, it was re-installed in the Holy Sepulchre church in London in 1973.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Glovers is one of the ancient Livery Companies of the City of London. Glovers separated from the Cordwainers to form their own organisation in 1349 and received a Royal Charter of incorporation in 1639. The company is, as are most other Livery Companies, a charitable organisation, but it still retains close links to its original trade.

The Company ranks 62nd in the order of precedence of Livery Companies. They are a member of the &#x27;Leathery Group&#x27; of Livery Companies, along with the Leathersellers, Coachmakers &amp; Coach Harness Makers, Cordwainers, Curriers, Girdlers, Loriners, Saddlers, and Pattenmakers.

The company&#x27;s motto is &quot;True Hearts and Warm Hands&quot;.

== History ==
Glovers, along with Girdlers were originally classified as Cordwainers, but separated to form their own &#x27;mistery&#x27; (trade or craft) organisation in 1349 when the bye-laws were recorded by the City Authorities. Five years later, the articles and ordinances of a separate faith-focussed &#x27;Fraternity of the Craft of Glovers&#x27; were recorded before the Commissary of London (an ecclesiastical official appointed by the Bishop of London).

By the end of the 15th century, the traders and merchants in London were in general prospering much more than the makers of things, and hence wealth and influence accrued much more to the mercantile companies than the crafts. Following a decline in numbers beyond the point of sustainability, the Glovers first merged with the Pursers (another small leathercraft company) in 1498 and then the much larger Leathersellers in 1502. 

Gloves became a high fashion item during the Elizabethan period and hence the glove trade grew in importance and influence. After much internal dispute and protracted efforts to separate from the Leathersellers, the Glovers became independent again under a Royal Charter of incorporation from King Charles I in 1638, followed by having their ordinances accepted by the Court of Aldermen in 1644 and finally having their status confirmed as a livery company in 1680 (after delays caused by the English Civil War amongst other things).

Royal links are still maintained; for example, the Company presented Princess Elizabeth with 30 pairs of gloves in a casket on the occasion of her marriage. The company has previously formally presented the Sovereign with a glove upon his or her coronation, however King Charles lll used the glove presented to his grandfather King George Vl by the Company in 1937.

In the 17th century the focus of the company was very much on the control and governance of the trade, in particular the &#x27;search&#x27; (inspection) of tawed leather (a process also known as alum tanning, that is still used for gloves and cricket balls) to ensure the quality of raw materials, and that those making gloves in London should have served an approved apprenticeship in the trade.

In the 18th century the Glovers produced three Lord Mayors: John Barnard (1737; he translated to the more prestigious Grocers Company just prior to becoming Lord Mayor), John Burnell (1787, the oldest Lord Mayor ever), and Sir John Anderson (1797). By the late 18th century the glove trade in London had declined and become a free for all, and the company had lost almost all connection with the trade. Between 1773 and 1804 only three of the members were described as glovers, and the professions of the masters from 1770 to 1780 were linen draper, oylman, tobacconist, sugar maker, jeweller and wine merchant.

The Company nearly became extinct for a second time in the late 19th century, with the low point being 1880 to 1885 when George Hibbert appears to have been the sole member of the court and re-elected himself as Master each year. Many livery companies were struggling to survive at this time (and several did not), as they were widely perceived to be an anachronism serving no useful function, divorced from the real commerce of the country. The appointment of Sir Homewood Crawford (Solicitor to the Corporation of London) as Master in 1886 started a turnaround in the Company&#x27;s fortunes (as it did at the Fan makers), with the assistance of Benjamin Scott (City Chamberlain). He was able to obtain an inspeximus granted by Queen Victoria in 1898, confirming the original Stuart charter.

Little is known of the company in the first half of the 20th century because all of the records were destroyed in an air raid in 1941. By the 1950s it was clear that reform was needed, as the Court met four times per year but there were no other meetings of any kind so the ordinary members had minimal knowledge of and no involvement in the Company. Significant changes started from 1970, with growing glove trade involvement, charitable projects, historical education, participation in City events, social activity, production of a newsletter, and rotation of the roles on the Court. Ladies were admitted from 1979 and the first female Master took office in 1999.

The hall was acquired in the mid 17th Century and was sited near Beech Lane in the area now covered by the Barbican Centre, but was increasingly used for religious purposes in the 18th century, including by the Wesleyans for at least 1739 to 1762. It was disposed of in the late 18th century when the company was in financial difficulties and were transacting their business at the George and Vulture Tavern, Lombard Street.

The coat of arms was first granted in 1464, and the supporters were added in 1986. The arms are “&quot;on a field of six pieces Sable and Argent three Rams salient armed and unguled Or&quot;” and feature sheep, which provided much of the raw material for gloves. The supporters are a male apprentice of the Glovers&#x27; Company, and a Sempster (a sewing woman) dressed circa 1638.

==Charitable Giving==
The Charity Projects Committee (CPC) administers the Glovers&#x27; charitable donations. Around 50 charities are supported, the largest group of which are homeless charities and hospices who receive gloves for warmth, clinical needs and catering purposes. Other glove donations include gardening gloves to help with mental and physical therapy, cryotherapy mittens for patients undergoing chemotherapy treatment at Portsmouth Hospital and protective gloves for charity led emergency services such as London&#x27;s Air Ambulance. The CPC offers student bursaries and grants to selected schools and colleges and supports community projects in areas of need, including The Winch which provides after-school clubs and holiday schemes for children in Campden. A significant recent initiative is the provision of myoelectric prosthetic hands from Open Bionics and prosthetic sleeves from Koalaa for children and adults who would not otherwise be able to access them.

==The Glove Collection Trust==
The Trust was established in 1993 as a charity to &quot;advance public education in the historical, social, and artistic value of gloves&quot;. In 2003 the Company gifted its collection of about 250 items to the Trust. The core of this was the collection of mainly 17th and 18th century gloves bequeathed to the company by the artist Robert Spence in 1964. The trustees have subsequently expanded the Glove Collection to approximately 2,300 items that can be viewed on the Trust&#x27;s dedicated website. A prominent contributor to this expansion was Past Assistant Douglas Sweet, who spent 30 years making acquisitions. The Trust published an illustrated booklet containing twenty notable gloves to commemorate his work. The collection is now held in the care of the Fashion Museum, Bath. The Trust periodically lends items for display at other museums, UK and overseas.

==Glove Trade Activity==
In the first half of the 20th Century the Company had little connection with the glove trade, so other trade associations were formed: The National Association of Glove Manufacturers in 1941, and the Glove Guild of Great Britain (representing importers wholesalers and retailers) in 1965. However, the early 1980s recession and the rise in far eastern imports caused the bulk of the membership of both organisations to cease trading, and the Company facilitated a merger in 1998 to form the British Glove Association (BGA), with the Immediate Past Master Michael Down as the First President, Past Master Roderick Morriss as the second, and Past Master John Spanner as the third (and last). The number of gloves made in the UK continued to reduce in the 2000s, and at the AGM in 2010 it was agreed that the BGA would be dissolved, with the Company inheriting the small remaining funds and the Glove Trade Committee some of the activities such as lobbying on behalf of the industry, and the student glove design competition which continues to this day.

Whilst traditional glove making has largely moved offshore there are still specialist UK companies engaged in the design, development, importation and distribution of technical, military, medical and industrial gloves as well as fashion companies making or distributing dress gloves in the UK and for export markets. The Company maintains links with glove makers and importers including Dents (fashion gloves), Southcombe Gloves (fashion, technical and sports gloves), Bennett Safetywear (safety gloves), BM Polyco (rubber and PVC gloves).

The Glovers run an annual &quot;Golden Glove Award for Innovation&quot;. This was won in 2022 by the British Equestrian Federation. Student glove design and safety poster design competitions are also run annually to encourage practical and innovative glove design, and an awareness of hand protection in an industrial environment. The 2024 student glove design competition had two categories: a Glasto Glove (for any music artist who has ever played at Glastonbury, won by embroidery student Amelia Legg from the Royal School of Needlework, inspired by Lady Gaga), or an Aesthetic Prosthetic (a prosthetic hand design that reworks function and form to a new artistic level, won by Yevheniia Mizevych from the London College of Fashion). The competitions are sponsored by The Company and the winners in all categories receive cash prizes, which are presented at a formal luncheon in a City of London Livery Hall. In July 2024 the awards were presented by Dame Zandra Rhodes at Drapers Hall.

==Social and City Activity==
In common with most Livery Companies, The Glovers have an active programme of social activities of various types, including:

* Events to support and celebrate the various charities they sponsor, including visits to charities and fundraisers such as the &#x27;Mistress Glover&#x27;s Flying Circus&#x27; in 2024 which involved 15 people from 6 livery companies wing walking and raised over £50,000 to fund prosthetic hands.
* Inter-livery sporting and ceremonial events, including croquet (which the Glovers organise), golf, clay target shooting, cart marking (organised by the Carmen at Guildhall Yard which the Glovers provide protective gloves for), skiing, and a pancake race.
* Formal lunches and dinners, often linked to some other purpose such as the election of the Lord Mayor or the Sheriffs, the installation of a new Master, or the presentation of glove design awards.
* Participation in the Lord Mayor&#x27;s Show.
* Presenting gloves to new appointees to high profile positions (typically top City and military officials including in 2023 the Lord Mayor and Mayoress, the Aldermanic Sheriffs, the Lord Chief Justice, the Chief of the Defence Staff, the First Sea Lord, and the Chief of the Air Staff)
* Visits to affiliated organisations.
* Visits related to the interests of the current Master, including an annual cultural &#x27;weekend&#x27; trip outside London (now held during the week - Stratford in 2023 and Windsor in 2024).

==Affiliations==
The Worshipful Company of Glovers, like many other Livery Companies, has forged links with units of the Armed Forces. Specifically:

* THE ARTISTS RIFLES - The connection was formed in 1955 when the then Commanding Officer was a member of the company. The Artists have provided a small Guard of Honour at the Glovers&#x27; annual dinner.
* HMS ARTFUL - The Company became affiliated to HMS Cumberland in 1999 but this frigate was decommissioned in 2011. Since then, it has been affiliated to a new nuclear powered Astute class submarine, HMS Artful, which was fitted out at Barrow in Furness and officially named in September 2013 at a ceremony attended by several Glovers. This affiliation is shared with The Worshipful Company of Glass Sellers and with the City of Southampton.
* 296 (STOKE NEWINGTON) SQUADRON ROYAL AIR FORCE AIR CADETS - The Glovers were affiliated to 444 (Shoreditch) Squadron Royal Air Force cadets who were disbanded in 2021.The Glovers then became affiliated to this Cadet Squadron on 2 February 2022. The cadets of 296 had previously formed a carpet guard at the Glovers annual Banquet in 2021 and assisted on the Glovers float at the Lord Mayors show in the same year.
The company also has two non-military affiliations:
* ST JOHN AMBULANCE 467 BARNET CADETS - The Company became affiliated to this Cadet Association in 2014.
* SAFRAN GUILD OF BASEL - their historic hall features a stained glass window of the Glovers coat of arms to mark the long association.

== Honorary Glovers ==
A recent initiative is the admission of Honorary Glovers, a position offered to individuals who have made a significant contribution to the Company in pursuit of its aims and aspirations. The first of these was Charlotte Hannibal in 2018, who educated the Company about meningitis and the need for prosthetics, and then supported fundraising for the first prosthetic hand given by the Company.

<text>Health Sciences North is a teaching hospital in Greater Sudbury, Ontario, Canada. HSN offers a variety of programs and services, with regional programs in the areas of cardiac care, oncology, nephrology, trauma and rehabilitation. Patients visit HSN from a wide geographic area across northeastern Ontario.

==History==
HSN was formed through the amalgamation of three separate hospitals in 2010. The city formerly had three community hospitals: Sudbury General (completed in 1950), Sudbury Memorial (completed in 1956), and Laurentian Hospital (completed in 1975), and one mental health and community service facility, Sudbury Algoma Hospital. The three officially amalgamated in 1997 to form one corporation, the Hôpital Régional de Sudbury Regional Hospital (HRSRH), but remained a multi-site facility. In 2000, the construction of the new one-site hospital began and was completed in 2010.

In October 2012, the new one-site hospital was renamed &quot;Health Sciences North&quot; as it evolved into an academic research centre, as well as a hospital. In 2013, HSN implemented a new strategic plan that focused on delivering patient-centred care, research, teaching and learning in northeastern Ontario and beyond.

==Services==
Health Sciences North offers a variety of programs and services, with regional programs in the areas of cardiac care, oncology, nephrology, trauma and rehabilitation. HSN&#x27;s patients visit from a wide area across northeastern Ontario.

HSN employs 3,898 people, 270 physicians and has 586 volunteers - it is the single largest employer in Sudbury. In a typical year the hospital sees 328,207 outpatients and 61,540 people in the emergency department, and admits 22,633 people.

==Abduction incident==
On November 1, 2007, a Kirkland Lake woman, Brenda Batisse, abducted a newborn baby girl from the SRH&#x27;s St. Joseph&#x27;s Health Care Centre site shortly before 1 p.m. The hospital immediately went into lock-down and a province-wide AMBER Alert was issued. All highways leading out of the city were roadblocked. Batisse had already passed a roadblock location. She was subsequently arrested at her home in Kirkland Lake at 8:30 p.m., and the baby was returned to her mother unharmed.

Batisse, an Anishinaabe who had been physically, sexually and emotionally abused by several relatives throughout her childhood, had no prior criminal record and an extenuating mental health background. According to trial testimony, Batisse abducted the baby because her own pregnancy ended in a miscarriage shortly after she was physically assaulted in the summer of 2007, and she feared that her boyfriend would leave her if he found out.

Batisse was eventually sentenced to five years in prison for the abduction. On February 5, 2009, the Court of Appeal for Ontario ruled that the sentence was not consistent with the principles established by the Supreme Court of Canada around the sentencing of First Nations offenders, and reduced her sentence from five to 2.5 years.

==Computer virus==
On January 16, 2019, Sudbury&#x27;s Health Sciences North was hit by a computer virus that was affecting the medical records system, which is also used by 24 hospitals located in the north east region. As a preventive measure, systems at HSN were put on downtime, successfully avoiding dissemination of the virus. The other hospitals were not necessarily infected, but were impacted as a result.

==Heliport==
The hospital is equipped with a rooftop heliport.

<text>Locoweed (also crazyweed and loco) is a common name in North America for any plant that produces swainsonine, an alkaloid harmful to livestock. Worldwide, swainsonine is produced by a small number of species, most of them in three genera of the flowering plant family Fabaceae: &quot;Oxytropis&quot; and &quot;Astragalus&quot; in North America, and &quot;Swainsona&quot; in Australia. The term locoweed usually refers only to the North American species of &quot;Oxytropis&quot; and &quot;Astragalus&quot;, but this article includes the other species as well. Some references may incorrectly list &quot;Datura&quot; as locoweed.

Locoweed is relatively palatable to livestock, and some individual animals will seek it out. Livestock poisoned by chronic ingestion of large amounts of swainsonine develop a medical condition known as &quot;locoism&quot; (swainsonine disease, swainsonine toxicosis in North America) and &quot;pea struck&quot; in Australia. Locoism is reported most often in cattle, sheep, and horses, but has also been reported in elk and deer. It is the most widespread poisonous plant problem in the western United States.

Most of the 2,000 species of &quot;Astragalus&quot;, including many that are commonly known as locoweeds, do not produce swainsonine. Some species, including a few that produce swainsonine, accumulate selenium. This has led to confusion between swainsonine poisoning and selenium poisoning due to this genus.

==History and etymology==
The first technical account (in English) of locoism was published in 1873, in the United States. Linguists have documented &quot;locoism&quot; in use among English speakers by 1889, and both &quot;loco&quot; and &quot;locoweed&quot; in use by 1844.

&quot;Loco&quot;, a loanword from Spanish, is understood by most English-speaking users in the sense of &quot;crazy&quot;, and this appears to have also been the sense understood by vaqueros. In Spanish, however, &quot;loco&quot; has an older, different sense. In Spain, where the native &quot;Astragalus&quot; species are not known to cause locoism, for centuries &quot;loco&quot; has been applied to some of these species in the sense of &quot;rambling&quot;: common names include &quot;yerba loca&quot; (&quot;hierba loca&quot;; rambling herb) and &quot;chocho loco&quot; (rambling lupine).

The presence of a toxin in locoweed was demonstrated in 1909. Initially, the toxin was reported to be a barium compound, but that was soon disproved. Swainsonine, first isolated from &quot;Swainsona&quot;, was shown to be responsible for pea struck in 1979, and was reported in both &quot;Oxytropis&quot; and &quot;Astragalus&quot; in 1982.

Since 1982, swainsonine has been isolated from still more plants, some of which also are reported to cause locoism or medical conditions similar to it. The first report of locoism in South America, involving &quot;Astragalus pehuenches&quot;, was published in 2000.

==Taxa producing swainsonine==
Swainsonine is produced by a small number of species, including species in several genera of plants and two genera of fungi.


&quot;Oxytropis&quot; is distributed throughout western North America, particularly in the Great Plains and Rocky Mountains. However, most species of &quot;Oxytropis&quot; have narrow habitat requirements and within those habitats are abundant only in unusually wet years. The species most frequently encountered by livestock are &quot;O. lambertii&quot; (Lambert locoweed, purple locoweed, woolly locoweed) and especially &quot;Oxytropis sericea&quot; (white locoweed, white point locoweed, white point loco). Swainsonine has also been found in &quot;O. campestris&quot; (in Canada).

Some species of &quot;Astragalus&quot; (milkvetch) are also referred to as locoweed. Swainsonine has been found in:
* &quot;A. earlei&quot; (Big Bend loco)
* &quot;A. mollissimus&quot; (purple woolly loco)
* &quot;A. pubentissimus&quot; (green river milkvetch)
* &quot;A. lentiginosis&quot; (spotted locoweed, freckled milkvetch)
* &quot;A. wootoni&quot; (garbancillo)
* &quot;A. nothoxys&quot; (sheep milkvetch)
* &quot;A. tephrodes&quot; (ashen milkvetch)
* &quot;A. humistratus&quot; (ground cover milkvetch)

In Argentina, locoism (&quot;locoismo&quot;) was first reported in 2000. A flock of sheep grazing a pasture with &quot;Astragalus pehuenches&quot; was poisoned and 220 sheep (73%) died. Although this was the first report of locoism in South America, swainsonine had been isolated previously from &quot;A. pehuenches&quot; and several other species in Argentina and Peru.

In the Old World, native plants causing locoism have not been reported. &quot;Astragalus lusitanicus&quot; in Morocco was suspected, but has been shown be neither a producer of swainsonine nor an accumulator of selenium. Its toxicity is suspected to be due to a novel alkaloid.

In Australia, species of &quot;Swainsona&quot; (Darling pea) that cause pea struck include:
* &quot;S. luteola&quot;
* &quot;S. greyana&quot; (hairy Darling pea)
* &quot;S. galegifolia&quot; (smooth Darling pea)

&quot;Astragalus&quot; and &quot;Oxytropis&quot; are two of 20 genera (and 78 names of genera) in the tribe Galegeae, subtribe Astragalinae. Some authorities include &quot;Swainsona&quot; in the subtribe. Formerly, &quot;Swainsona&quot; was in another subtribe, Coluteinae, that has been combined into Astragalinae.

Swainsonine has also been isolated from &quot;Sida carpinifolia&quot; and &quot;Ipomoea carnea&quot;, and both species have been reported to cause locoism.

&quot;Embellisia&quot;, a fungus isolated from &quot;Oxytropis lambertii&quot;, has also been shown to produce swainsonine and to cause locoism in rats. &quot;Rhizoctonia leguminicola&quot;, a fungal plant pathogen that may occur on red clover (&quot;Trifolium pratense&quot;), also produces swainsonine. Although intoxication due to this fungus resembles locoism, it has additional signs and symptoms due to the production of other toxins.

==Pathology==
Intoxication with swainsonine has several kinds of effect.

Livestock that graze for several weeks on locoweed (and little else) develop a lysosomal storage disease similar to genetic mannosidosis. Swainsonine inhibits a lysosomal enzyme, alpha-mannosidase. This results in abnormal accumulation of the molecules normally processed by the enzyme, and this accumulation leads to vacuolation of most tissues. Vacuolation is most obvious in neurons and epithelial cells. The vacuolation resolves shortly after poisoning is discontinued, but if the vacuolation is so severe that it destroys cells, it may result in some neurologic damage that is irreversible and permanent. The damage is highly varied. In cattle at high altitude, complications of locoism can include congestive heart failure.

== Diagnosis ==
Diagnosis of clinical poisoning is generally made by documenting exposure, identifying the neurologic signs, and analyzing blood serum for alpha-mannosidase activity and swainsonine.

In mule deer, clinical signs of locoism are similar to chronic wasting disease. Histological signs of vacuolation provide a differential diagnosis.

Sub-clinical intoxication has been investigated in cattle grazing on &quot;Astragalus mollissimus&quot;. As the estimated intake of swainsonine increased, blood serum alpha-mannosidase activity and albumin decreased, and alkaline phosphatase and thyroid hormone increased.

== Prevention ==
Because &quot;O. sericea&quot; is both frequently encountered and relatively palatable to livestock, it is an important cause of economic losses in livestock production. Keeping livestock away from locoweed-infested pasture in spring and fall when grass and other forbs are not actively growing is recommended. Another suggested remedy is to provide palatable supplemental nutrients if animals are to be kept in infested pasture. These remedies take into account livestock preference for locoweed during seasons when grass is dry and not very nutritious. Conditioned food aversion has been used experimentally to discourage livestock from eating it. In horses, a small study has shown promising results using lithium chloride as the aversive agent.

<text>The Worshipful Company of Carpenters is a livery company of the City of London. The Carpenters were traditionally different from a fellow wood-crafting company, the Worshipful Company of Joiners and Ceilers, in that carpenters utilised nails while joiners used adhesives to attach wood.

The organisation existed in 1271; it received a Royal Charter of incorporation in 1477. As is the case with most of the other livery companies, the Company no longer has a role as a trade association of tradesmen and craftsmen. Instead, it acts as a charitable institution and supports education in wood-related fields.

In 1767 the Company purchased an estate at Stratford, London. In 1886 it opened an evening institute on the Carpenters Estate there, offering classes in carpentry, joinery, plumbing, geometry, mechanical drawing and cookery. In 1891, the Carpenter&#x27;s Institute had become a day school for boys. The school closed in 1905 when the local authority opened its own school.

The Company ranks twenty-sixth in the order of precedence of livery companies. The Company&#x27;s motto is &quot;Honour God&quot;. Its guild church is All Hallows-on-the-Wall, where the Company has held its annual elections for over 600 years. The livery hall, Carpenters Hall, is at Throgmorton Avenue; it is a Grade II listed building.

Founded in 1724, the Carpenters&#x27; Company of the City and County of Philadelphia was modelled after the Worshipful Company of Carpenters.

<text>Rev George Gilfillan (30 January 1813 – 13 August 1878) was a Scottish author and poet. One of the spasmodic poets, Gilfillan was also an editor and commentator, with memoirs, critical dissertations in many editions of earlier British poetry.

==Early life and education==
George Gilfillan was born at Comrie, Perthshire, the eleventh of twelve children. His father, the Rev. Samuel Gilfillan, the author of some theological works, was for many years minister of a Secession congregation. His mother, Rachel Barlas, the daughter of another Secession minister, was a notable beauty often spoken of as &quot;The Star of the North&quot;.

In 1825 he went to study at the University of Glasgow, where his classmates included John Eadie, William Hanna and Archibald Campbell Tait, the future Archbishop of Canterbury. In 1833 he studied for a year in Mid Calder before moving on to Edinburgh where he received warm encouragement from the professor of moral philosophy, John Wilson, better known as Christopher North. Here, he formed friendships with Thomas Aird, Thomas de Quincey, and Thomas Carlyle.

He was licensed by the Presbytery of Edinburgh as a probationer in 1835, but declined an invitation to take on his late father&#x27;s congregation in Comrie. On 23 March the following year he was ordained as minister of the School Wynd church in Dundee, a post he would hold for the rest of his life. Later that year, on 22 November, he married Margaret Valentine, daughter of a farmer and factor in Kincardineshire. He was actively involved Dundee&#x27;s cultural societies and a key figure in the city&#x27;s literary life in the mid-Nineteenth Century.

==Works==
Gilfillan published a volume of his discourses in 1839, and shortly afterwards another sermon on Hades, which brought him under the scrutiny of his co-presbyters, and was ultimately withdrawn from circulation.

Gilfillan next contributed a series of sketches of celebrated contemporary authors to the &quot;Dumfries Herald&quot;, then edited by Thomas Aird; these, with several new ones, formed his first &quot;Gallery of Literary Portraits&quot;, which appeared in 1846 and had a wide circulation. It was quickly followed by a &quot;Second&quot; and a &quot;Third Gallery&quot;.

In 1851 his most successful work, the &quot;Bards of the Bible&quot;, appeared. His aim was that it should be a poem on the Bible and it was far more rhapsodical than critical, being in Gilfillan&#x27;s words &#x27;a Prose Poem, or Hymn, in honour of the Poetry and Poets of the inspired volume with occasional divergence into the analysis of Scripture characters, and cognate fields of literature or of speculation &#x27;. His &quot;Martyrs and Heroes of the Scottish Covenant&quot; appeared in 1832, and in 1856 he produced a partly autobiographical, partly fabulous, &quot;History of a Man&quot;.
From 1853 to 1860 he was occupied with editing Cassell&#x27;s 48-volume &quot;Library Edition of the British Poets&quot;.

In 1858 he published a 3-volume edition of Thomas Percy&#x27;s &quot;Reliques of Ancient English Poetry, consisting of old heroic ballads, songs, and other pieces from our earlier poets&quot;, authoring a prefatory &#x27;Memoir and Critical Dissertation&#x27; entitled &#x27;Life of Thomas Percy, Bishop of Dromore; with Remarks on Ballad Poetry.&#x27; Although Gilfillan and Charles Cowden Clarke published the &quot;Reliques&quot; for Cassell in 1877, Gilfillan&#x27;s 1858 edition was simultaneously published by James Nichol in Edinburgh, in London by James Nisbet, and in Dublin by W. Robertson, appealing to ready markets in Scotland and Ireland. As a lecturer and as a preacher he drew large crowds, but his literary reputation proved exceptionally temporary. He died, aged 65, having just finished a new life of Burns designed to accompany a new edition of the works of that poet.

==Poetry==
For thirty years he was engaged upon a long poem, &quot;Night&quot;, which was published in 1867, but its theme was too vast, vague and unmanageable, and, according to the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; Eleventh Edition, the result was considered a failure. This, Gilfillan&#x27;s major work is in ten parts, he described in his preface as being &#x27;to an extent miscellaneous in its materials, following thus a type which once extensively prevailed in poetry.&#x27;

As a poetry critic, Gilfillan was the champion of the spasmodic poets. He supported the work of Ellen Johnston, who was known as &quot;The Factory Girl&quot; because of her humble origins.

==Support for working-class poets==
Gilfillan was a supporter of working-class poets, believing them to be less influenced by the works of others than better educated writers. In a preface to a book of poems by Janet Hamilton he wrote:

The self-taught have usually greater freshness of feeling in beholding nature, and a keener sympathy with men, than the better instructed. Having read fewer descriptions, they look at the thing described more exactly as it is. Many see not nature&#x27;s thunderstorm, but Thomson&#x27;s or Byron&#x27;s; not Bruar-water itself, but Burns&#x27; picture of it; Scott&#x27;s Trossachs, not the beautiful place itself; and hence, often when they try to describe such scenes, they merely dilute the descriptions of others and produce shadows of shades. The self-taught simply record the contact between their own genius and Nature&#x27;s works.

This support backfired somewhat when one of his proteges, William McGonagall, gained a reputation as the worst poet in the English language. McGonagall&#x27;s &quot;Address to the Rev. George Gilfillan&quot;, the first poem he ever wrote, is arguably the only reason modern readers remember Gilfillan – though modern adherents have attempted to revive his memory.

==Death and funeral==

In later life he was minister of the United Presbyterian Church on South Lindsay Street and was living at 5 Paradise Road, north of the city centre.

Gilfillan died after a very short illness on 13 August 1878 at the house of a Mr Valentine in Brechin, having travelled to that town to officiate at the wedding of a niece. He had given a sermon that Sunday on the subject of sudden death.

He was buried at the cemetery in Balgay, in a funeral procession of three thousand people. The occasion was memorialised in another McGonagall poem.

==Memorial==
Gilfillan Memorial Church was erected at the foot of Whitehall Street, Dundee, in 1888 to a design by Malcolm Stark. The congregation the church houses was formed by members of School Wynd Church who had elected the radical David McCrae of Greenock to succeed Gilfillan as minister. However, McCrae, whose views against the concept of eternal damnation Gilfillan had supported, had been declared to no longer be a minister by the UP Church. The majority of the School Wynd congregation ignored this edict and left the UP church to set up their own independent church under McCrae, taking the name of their popular minister. Several portraits of Gilfillan exist.

A biography of Gilfillan by Aileen Black was published in 2006.

<text>The grey seal (Halichoerus grypus) is a large seal of the family Phocidae, which are commonly referred to as &quot;true seals&quot; or &quot;earless seals&quot;. The only species classified in the genus Halichoerus, it is found on both shores of the North Atlantic Ocean. In Latin, &quot;Halichoerus grypus&quot; means &quot;hook-nosed sea pig&quot;. Its name is spelled gray seal in the United States; it is also known as Atlantic seal and the horsehead seal.

==Taxonomy==
There are two recognized subspecies of this seal:
The type specimen of &quot;H. g. grypus&quot; (Zoological Museum of Copenhagen specimen ZMUC M11-1525, caught in 1788 off the island of Amager, Danish part of the Baltic Sea) was believed lost for many years, but was rediscovered in 2016, and a DNA test showed it belonged to a Baltic Sea specimen rather than from Greenland, as had previously been assumed (because it was first described in Otto Fabricius&#x27; book on the animals in Greenland: &quot;Fauna Groenlandica&quot;). The name &quot;H. g. grypus&quot; was therefore transferred to the Baltic subspecies (replacing &quot;H. g. macrorhynchus&quot;), and the name &quot;H. g. atlantica&quot; resurrected for the Atlantic subspecies.

Molecular studies have indicated that the eastern and western Atlantic populations have been genetically distinct for at least one million years, and could potentially be considered separate subspecies.

==Description==

This is a fairly large seal, with bulls in the eastern Atlantic populations reaching long and weighing ; the cows are much smaller, typically long and in weight. Individuals from the western Atlantic are often much larger, with males averaging up to and reaching a weight of as much as and females averaging up to and sometimes weighing up to . Record-sized bull grey seals can reach about in length. A common average weight in Great Britain was found to be about for males and for females whereas in Nova Scotia, Canada, adult males averaged and adult females averaged . It is distinguished from the smaller harbor seal by its straight head profile, nostrils set well apart, and fewer spots on its body. Wintering hooded seals can be confused with grey seals as they are about the same size and somewhat share a large-nosed look but the hooded has a paler base colour and usually evidences a stronger spotting. Grey seals lack external ear flaps and characteristically have large snouts. Bull greys have larger noses and a less curved profile than harbor seal bulls. Males are generally darker than females, with lighter patches and often scarring around the neck. Females are silver grey to brown with dark patches.

==Ecology and distribution==

In the United Kingdom and Ireland, the grey seal breeds in several colonies on and around the coasts. Notably large colonies are at Blakeney Point in Norfolk, Donna Nook in Lincolnshire, the Farne Islands off the Northumberland Coast (about 6,000 animals), Orkney and North Rona. off the north coast of Scotland, Lambay Island off the coast of Dublin in the Irish Sea, the Isle of Man, Ramsey Island (off the coast of Pembrokeshire, Wales). In the German Bight, colonies exist off the islands Sylt, Amrum and on Heligoland.

In the western North Atlantic, the grey seal is typically found in large numbers in the coastal waters of the Maritime Provinces of Canada and south to Nantucket in the United States. In coastal Canada, it is typically seen in areas such as the Gulf of St. Lawrence, Newfoundland, Prince Edward Island, and Quebec. The largest colony in the world is at Sable Island, Nova Scotia. In the United States, it is found year-round off the coast of New England, in particular Maine and Massachusetts. It has also been observed in the waters around Connecticut, New York and Rhode Island. Archaeological evidence confirms grey seals in southern New England with remains found on Block Island, Martha&#x27;s Vineyard, and near the mouth of the Quinnipiac River in New Haven, Connecticut. Its natural range now extends much further south than previously thought, with confirmed sightings off of North Carolina. Also, there is a report by Farley Mowat of historic breeding colonies as far south as Cape Hatteras, North Carolina.

An isolated population exists in the Baltic Sea, forming the &quot;H. grypus balticus&quot; subspecies.

Besides these very large colonies, many much smaller ones exist, some of which are well-known tourist attractions, despite their small size. Such colonies include one on the Carrack rocks, Cornwall.

During the winter months, grey seals can be seen hauled out on rocks, islands, and shoals not far from shore, occasionally coming ashore to rest. In the spring, recently weaned pups and yearlings occasionally strand on beaches after becoming separated from their group.

Grey seals are vulnerable to typical predators for a pinniped mammal; their primary predator would be the orca or killer whale, but certain large species of sharks are known to prey on grey seals in North American waters, particularly great white sharks and bull sharks but also, upon evidence, additionally Greenland sharks. Some grey seal carcasses have washed ashore with visible &quot;cookie cutter&quot; bite marks, a telltale sign of attack by a Greenland shark (also called the sleeper shark). In the waters of Great Britain, grey seals are a fairly common prey species for killer whales. In the Baltic, grey seal pups are prey for White-tailed eagles, and Great black-backed gulls.

==Diet==


The grey seal feeds on a wide variety of fish, mostly benthic or demersal species, taken at depths down to 70 m (230 ft) or more. Sand eels (&quot;Ammodytes spp&quot;) are important in its diet in many localities. Cod and other gadids, flatfish, herring, wrasse and skates are also important locally. However, it is clear that the grey seal will eat whatever is available, including octopus and lobsters. The average daily food requirement is estimated to be 5 kg (11 lb), though the seal does not feed every day and it fasts during the breeding season.

Recent observations and studies from Scotland, The Netherlands, and Germany show that grey seals will also prey and feed on large animals like harbour seals and harbour porpoises. In 2014, a male grey seal in the North Sea was documented and filmed killing and cannibalising 11 pups of his own species over the course of a week. Similar wounds on the carcasses of pups found elsewhere in the region suggest that cannibalism and infanticide may not be uncommon in grey seals. Male grey seals may engage in such behaviour potentially as a way of increasing reproductive success through access to easy prey without leaving prime territory.

==Communication==
While it was originally understood that marine mammals communicate vocally, new research conducted by researchers at Monash University shows that grey seals clap their flippers as another form of communication. They clap their flippers underwater to deter a predator from attacking. If done during the mating season, the clapping can be used as a way to find a potential mate. The Monash researchers point out that seals are typically known for clapping, so this behaviour may not be a surprise, but the clapping we know typically occurs in captivity. Clapping seals are associated with aquariums and zoos, but were never observed in the wild for this behaviour. They were astonished at how loud these marine mammals were able to clap underwater, but it is logical for the reasons they do this.

==Reproduction==

Grey seals are capital breeders; they forage to build up stored blubber, which is utilised when they are breeding and weaning their pups, as they do not forage for food at this time. They give birth to a single pup every year, with females&#x27; reproductive years beginning as early as 4 years old and extending up to 30 years of age. All parental care is provided by the female. During breeding, males do not provide parental care but they defend females against other males for mating. The pups are born at around the mass of 14 kg. They are born in autumn (September to December) in the eastern Atlantic and in winter (January to February) in the west, with a dense, soft silky white fur; at first small, they rapidly fatten up on their mothers&#x27; extremely fat-rich milk. The milk can consist of up to 60% fat. Grey seal pups are precocial, with mothers returning to the sea to forage once pups are weaned. Pups also undergo a post-weaning fast before leaving the land and learning to swim. Within a month or so they shed the pup fur, grow dense waterproof adult fur, and leave for the sea to learn to fish for themselves. In recent years, the number of grey seals has been on the rise in the west and the U.S. and Canada there have been calls for a seal cull.
Seal pup first-year survival rates are estimated to vary from 80 to 85% to below 50% depending on location and conditions. Starvation, due to difficulties in learning to feed, appears to be the main cause of pup death.

Male grey seals engage in aggressive sexual behaviour, which can lead to severe injuries and even death for the female. Sometimes they will also target females from other seal species. In the North Sea, multiple cases were recorded of pregnant harbour seals dying as a result of forced copulation with male grey seals. 

==Status==
After near extirpation from hunting grey seals for oil, meat, and skins in the United States, sightings began to increase in the late 1980s. Bounties were paid on all kinds of seals up until 1945 in Maine and 1962 in Massachusetts. One year after Congress passed the 1972 Marine Mammal Protection Act preventing the harming or harassing of seals, a survey of the entire Maine coast found only 30 grey seals. At first grey seal populations increased slowly but then rebounded from islands off Maine to Monomoy Island and Nantucket Island off of southern Cape Cod. The southernmost breeding colony was established on Muskeget Island with five pups born in 1988 and over 2,000 counted in 2008. According to a genetics study, the United States population has formed as a result of recolonisation by Canadian seals. By 2009, thousands of grey seals had taken up residence on or near popular swimming beaches on outer Cape Cod, resulting in sightings of great white sharks drawn close to shore to hunt the seals. A count of 15,756 grey seals in southeastern Massachusetts coastal waters was made in 2011 by the National Marine Fisheries Service. Grey seals are being seen increasingly in New York and New Jersey waters, and it is expected that they will establish colonies further south.

Human noise pollution continues to affect marine-life communication but remains an understudied facet of marine conservation efforts. In more recent years, the potential negative effect of human noise has been highlighted with the discovery of seals using clapping as a form of communication.

In the UK seals are protected under the Conservation of Seals Act 1970; however, it does not apply to Northern Ireland. In the UK there have also been calls for a cull from some fishermen claiming that stocks have declined due to the seals.

The population in the Baltic Sea increased about 8% per year between 1990 and the mid-2000s, with the numbers becoming stagnant since 2005. As of 2011, hunting grey seals is legal in Sweden and Finland, with 50% of the quota being used. Other anthropogenic causes of death include drowning in fishing gear.

===Captivity===
Grey seals have proved amenable to life in captivity and are commonly found as zoo animals around their native range, particularly in Europe. Traditionally they were popular circus animals and often used in performances such as balancing and display acts.

<doc id="372723" wikidata="Q3082840" url="?curid=372723" title="Frank Thomas (designated hitter)">
<text>Frank Edward Thomas Jr. (born May 27, 1968), nicknamed &quot;the Big Hurt,&quot; is an American former professional baseball designated hitter and first baseman in Major League Baseball (MLB). He played for three American League (AL) teams from 1990 to 2008, all but the last three years with the Chicago White Sox. A five-time All-Star, he is the only player in major league history to have seven consecutive seasons (1991–1997) with at least a .300 batting average, 100 runs batted in (RBI), 100 runs scored, 100 walks, and 20 home runs. Thomas also won the AL batting title in 1997 with a .347 mark. Thomas is a two-time AL MVP and won a World Series in 2005 although he was injured during the regular season and World Series. Thomas is widely considered one of the greatest right-handed hitters in MLB history.

Drafted seventh overall by the White Sox in the 1989 MLB draft, Thomas made his major league debut the following year and immediately impressed with his hitting ability. Thomas was named the AL&#x27;s Most Valuable Player (MVP) by unanimous vote in 1993. That year, he became the first White Sox player to hit 40 home runs and led the team to a division title. He repeated as MVP in the strike-shortened 1994 season, batting .353 and leading the league in slugging percentage and runs. Following two sub-par seasons, Thomas lost a close MVP vote in 2000 despite posting career highs of 43 home runs and 143 RBI. Still, he was named AL Comeback Player of the Year, and Chicago finished with the AL&#x27;s best record. Later in Thomas&#x27;s career, a variety of foot injuries and minor ailments reduced his productivity and often limited him to a designated hitter role. In 2005, his final season in Chicago, he was limited to only 34 games after starting the year on the disabled list and then fracturing a bone in his foot close to where it was surgically repaired the previous off-season. He was unable to play in the post-season while the White Sox won the World Series that year. Thomas spent the final three years of his career with the Oakland Athletics and Toronto Blue Jays, with whom he hit his 500th home run.

By the end of his career, Thomas was tied for eighth in AL history for home runs (521), ninth for RBI (1,704), and sixth for walks (1,667). Among players with at least 7,000 at bats in the AL, he ranked eighth in slugging average (.555) and ninth in on-base percentage (.419). With a .301 lifetime batting average, he became the seventh player in history to retire with at least a .300 average and 500 home runs. He holds White Sox franchise records for career home runs (448), RBI (1,465), runs (1,327), doubles (447), extra base hits, walks (1,466), slugging average, (.568) and on-base percentage (.427). The White Sox retired Thomas&#x27;s uniform number 35 in 2010 and unveiled a statue of him at U.S. Cellular Field in 2011. Thomas was elected to the Baseball Hall of Fame in 2014 in his first year of eligibility—the first White Sox star to achieve that distinction.

Thomas was one of the few major league stars who never fell under suspicion during the performance-enhancing drugs controversies of the late 1990s. An advocate for drug testing as early as 1995, he was the only active player who agreed to be interviewed for the Mitchell Report in 2007.

==Early life and college==
Thomas was born and raised in Columbus, Georgia, and attended Columbus High School, where he was a standout in both football and baseball. As a sophomore, he hit cleanup for the baseball team, which won a state championship. As a senior, he not only hit .440, but also was named an All-State tight end in football, and played forward with the basketball team. He wanted desperately to win a contract to play professional baseball, but was not selected in the 1986 amateur draft. &quot;I was shocked and sad,&quot; Thomas recalled in the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;. &quot;I saw a lot of guys I played against get drafted, and I knew they couldn&#x27;t do what I could do. But I&#x27;ve had people all my life saying you can&#x27;t do this, you can&#x27;t do that. It scars you. No matter how well I&#x27;ve done. People have misunderstood me for some reason. I was always one of the most competitive kids around.&quot;

In the autumn of 1986, Thomas accepted a scholarship to play football at Auburn University. His love of baseball drew him to the school&#x27;s baseball team, where the coach immediately recognized his potential. &quot;We loved him,&quot; Auburn baseball coach Hal Baird told &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot;. &quot;He was fun to be around—always smiling, always bright-eyed.&quot; He was also a tremendous hitter, posting a .359 batting average and leading the Tigers in RBI as a freshman. During summer 1987, he played for the U.S. Pan American Team, earning a spot on the final roster in the Pan American Games. The Games coincided with the beginning of football practice back at Auburn, so he left the Pan Am team and returned to college—only to be injured twice in early-season football games. In the summer of 1988, Thomas played for the Orleans Cardinals of the Cape Cod Baseball League. Highlights included a three-homer game in Wareham, as well as a home run over the 434&#x27; sign in center field at Eldredge Park in Orleans. In 2000, Thomas was named a member of the inaugural class of the Cape Cod Baseball League Hall of Fame.

Despite the injury that could have jeopardized his football scholarship, Auburn continued his funding, and baseball became his sole sport. He won consideration for the U.S. National Team—preparing for the 1988 Summer Olympics—but was cut from the final squad. By the end of his junior baseball season, he had hit 19 home runs, 19 doubles, and batted .403 with a slugging percentage of .801. Thomas concluded his college career with 49 home runs, a school record. In May 2011, he was inducted into the Alabama Sports Hall of Fame.

== Professional career ==

=== Chicago White Sox ===

==== Early years (1990–1996) ====
The Chicago White Sox selected Thomas with the seventh pick in the first round of the June 1989 Major League Baseball draft. He made his major league debut on August 2, 1990, against the Milwaukee Brewers at County Stadium; he went without a hit, going 0-for-4, but had an RBI on a fielder&#x27;s choice which scored Iván Calderón as the White Sox won the game 4–3. On August 28, Thomas hit the first home run of his career in a road game against the Minnesota Twins at the Metrodome (which, coincidentally, would also be the site of his 500th career home run). He hit the home run off pitcher Gary Wayne in the top of the ninth inning as his team lost 12–6. Thomas played in 60 games with the White Sox in 1990, batting .330 with seven home runs and 31 runs batted in (RBI).

Thomas became known for his menacing home run power; in the on-deck circle, he routinely swung a rusted piece of rebar that he reportedly found during a renovation project in Old Comiskey Park. In his first full season, Thomas established himself as a multi-talented hitter, combining power with hitting for average, drawing walks, and driving in runs. In , Thomas finished third in MVP voting with a .318 batting average, 32 home runs and 109 RBI, as well as 138 walks. He won the first of four Silver Slugger Awards, and led the league in on-base percentage, something he would accomplish four times during his career.

In 1993, Thomas batted .317 with a club-record 41 homers, 128 RBI, 106 runs scored, and 112 walks. He joined a quartet of Hall of Famers (Babe Ruth, Lou Gehrig, Jimmie Foxx and Ted Williams) as the only players in baseball history to eclipse .300 with more than 20 homers and more than 100 RBI, runs, and walks in three straight seasons. On the back of this historic offensive output, Thomas collected all 28 votes from baseball writers for a unanimous AL Most Valuable Player award, the first by a White Sox player since Dick Allen in 1972, while leading the White Sox to their first AL West crown in 10 years. At the time, statistical analyst Bill James projected career statistics of 480 homers and a .311 lifetime average. Then-manager Gene Lamont was laudatory of Thomas&#x27; skills: &quot;I&#x27;ve only seen him two years now, but I&#x27;m convinced that there isn&#x27;t a pitch he can&#x27;t hit.&quot; White Sox announcer Ken Harrelson echoed the praise, &quot;In my 30 years in the game, I&#x27;ve never seen anyone like Big Hurt [Thomas]. In another 30 years, we may be talking about Frank Thomas in the same way we talk about Ted Williams.&quot; Thomas credited Harrelson with coining the &quot;Big Hurt&quot; nickname.

In 1994, playing just 113 games due to a strike-shortened season, Thomas again put up huge offensive numbers, batting .353 with 38 homers and 101 RBI, and he led the league in runs scored (106), walks (109), and slugging percentage with a whopping .729 mark. Thomas handily won his second consecutive MVP award, taking 24 of 28 first-place votes. He is one of only three first basemen in history to win consecutive MVP awards in the major leagues (Hall of Famer Jimmie Foxx, 1932–1933, and Albert Pujols, 2008–2009, are the others).

The 1994 shortened season was due to a players&#x27; strike, and perhaps no one felt the sting of the strike more than Thomas, who stood poised to achieve one of baseball&#x27;s most prestigious honors: the Triple Crown. Not since 1967 had any player finished the regular season first in average, home runs, and runs batted in. Thomas had recorded 32 home runs at the All-Star break, and was contending for the honor when the strike occurred. Pressed by the media to comment on his accomplishments—and his future—Thomas downplayed his own significance, telling the &quot;Atlanta Journal-Constitution&quot;: &quot;I&#x27;m not into being known as the best by fans or the media. I care how I&#x27;m perceived by my peers. I can settle for the label &#x27;one of the best&#x27; because that means you&#x27;re considered an elite player.&quot;

Thomas would continue putting up significant well-rounded offensive numbers, always placing in the top finishers in all major offensive categories, though rarely leading in any one stat. In 1995, he hit .308 with 40 homers and 111 RBI; in 1996, he hit .349 with 40 home runs and 134 RBI, and became an All-Star for the fourth time while finishing eighth in MVP voting.

==== Later years (1997–2005) ====
From 1991 to 1997, Thomas finished in the top 10 of the MVP voting every year. In , Thomas won the batting title and finished third in MVP voting. However, due in part to personal strife off the field, his offensive production wavered during the next two seasons. Never a defensive standout at first base during the early part of his career, Thomas nonetheless preferred playing in the field to serving as a designated hitter, saying that it kept him focused; the fact that he did generally hit better as a first baseman created a dilemma over the years for the White Sox as to whether to use him as a DH, which would reduce wear on his body but might cost some offensive production. By the late 1990s, minor injuries were tending to keep him unavailable for short periods, and 1997 was the last year in which he played more in the field than as a DH. Thomas rebounded with force in when he hit .328 with a career-high 43 homers and 143 RBI. Thomas finished second in MVP voting that season, behind Jason Giambi of the Oakland Athletics. Thomas also won the 2000 AL Comeback Player of the Year Award. But this would not mean an end to the rocky path he would follow later in his career.

In 2001, after his father died, Thomas also announced during the same week that he would undergo season-ending surgery after an MRI revealed a triceps tear in his right arm. He was distraught from the combined impact of both personal and professional strife. &quot;This is the worst week of my life,&quot; he said during a press conference in Chicago. &quot;First I lose my father, then come back and find out I&#x27;m lost for the season.&quot; He only played in 20 games that year, batting just .221 with four home runs and 10 RBI.

He rebounded from his injury and played in 148 games in 2002, but hit just .252, a career-low for a complete season, and would never again approach a .300 batting average. However, his power and ability to get on base and drive in runs were still in his offensive arsenal, and he finished the season with 28 home runs and 92 RBI. Always a patient hitter, Thomas led the AL in walks four times. Through the end of the 2006 season, he was second among all active players in walks and third in on-base percentage, and ranked among the top 20 lifetime in both categories.

Thomas had another solid season in 2003. He tied for second in the AL in home runs (42), and was in the league&#x27;s top ten in walks, extra base hits, slugging average, and on-base plus slugging, as he led the major leagues in fly ball percentage (54.9%). In 2005, Thomas again suffered from injury, but hit 12 home runs in 105 at-bats over 35 games, demonstrating his continued power at the plate. Adding together 2004 and 2005, he had fewer than 350 total at-bats because of injuries, but hit 30 home runs and drew 80 walks. As a member of the White Sox, Thomas and teammate Magglio Ordóñez tied a major league record for back-to-back homers, with six in one season.

==== 2005 World Series ====
In 2005, manager Ozzie Guillén led the White Sox to a World Series victory, their first in 88 years. Thomas was not on the postseason roster of the Series-winning team due to injury, but the team honored his perennial contributions to the franchise during Game 1 of the Division Series against the Boston Red Sox. Thomas was chosen to throw out the ceremonial first pitch. &quot;What a feeling,&quot; Thomas said. &quot;Standing [ovation] all around the place. People really cheering me. I had tears in my eyes. To really know the fans cared that much about me—it was a great feeling. One of my proudest moments in the game.&quot; Though Thomas was not on the postseason roster, he did earn a World Series ring for his contributions during the season.

==== Departure (2005) ====
Thomas established several White Sox batting records, including all-time leader in runs scored (1,327), home runs (448), doubles (447), RBI (1,465), extra-base hits (906), walks (1,466), total bases (3,949), slugging percentage (.568), and on-base percentage (.427). At the time he left the team, his 448 home runs were more than twice as many as any other individual player had hit for the White Sox in their 105-year history.

Despite his perennial offensive production and established fan base in Chicago, the White Sox elected to release Thomas in 2005. Thomas later expressed disappointment with how his 16-year tenure with the White Sox was ended, saying that chairman Jerry Reinsdorf did not call him to tell him he wasn&#x27;t coming back. He also said that he and Kenny Williams did not see eye-to-eye after Williams became general manager following the 2000 season. At the time, Thomas was unhappy that his next-to-last deal with the White Sox contained a &quot;diminished skills&quot; clause. He said the White Sox should have traded him after the playoffs that season.

&quot;I&#x27;ve got a lot of respect for Jerry Reinsdorf, I do. But I really thought, the relationship we had over the last 16 years, he would have picked up the phone to say, &#x27;Big guy, we&#x27;re moving forward. We&#x27;re going somewhere different. We don&#x27;t know your situation or what&#x27;s going to happen.&#x27; I can live with that, I really can,&quot; Thomas said. &quot;But treating me like some passing-by-player. I&#x27;ve got no respect for that.&quot; Thomas said he was not bitter or angry and had joined the A&#x27;s with an open mind.

=== Oakland Athletics (2006) ===

Thomas signed with the Oakland Athletics to a one-year, $500,000 deal with incentives on January 26, 2006. The Athletics installed Thomas as their everyday DH. He started the season slowly, hitting .178 through May 20, but ended the season as the team leader in home runs, RBI, slugging percentage, and on-base percentage. He provided a powerful right-handed bat in the middle of the lineup for the division-leading Athletics. He had a stretch from September 5 to September 11 where he hit a home run in six straight games.

On May 22, 2006, Thomas homered twice in his first game against his former team. Before Thomas came up to lead off the second inning, a musical montage played on the Jumbotron at U.S. Cellular Field, paying tribute to Thomas&#x27;s legacy with the White Sox. He was cheered in his introduction by the White Sox fans. Moments later, when he hit his first home run of the night to put his former team behind in the score 1–0, the Chicago crowd gave Thomas a standing ovation.

Thomas rejuvenated his career playing with the Athletics, placing fifth in the American League with 39 home runs and eighth with 114 RBI. He also was key to the team&#x27;s stretch drive to the playoffs: for the week ending September 10, he was the league&#x27;s player of the week after hitting .462 with five homers and 13 RBI. The 2006 postseason provided Thomas the opportunity to play in his first postseason games since 2000 due to having missed the 2005 playoffs with an injury, when the Athletics clinched the American League West title, defeating the Seattle Mariners 12–3 on September 26. During the A&#x27;s first playoff game on October 3, Thomas hit two solo home runs, leading the A&#x27;s to a 3–2 win over the Twins. His performance during the opening playoff game earned Thomas the distinction of being the oldest player to hit multiple home runs in a postseason game. He led the A&#x27;s to an ALDS victory, going 5-for-10 with two home runs in the series. In the 2006 ALCS, he went 0-for-13 in what turned out to be his last postseason appearance. 

On October 7, 2006, Thomas finished behind Jim Thome, his replacement as the White Sox&#x27;s DH, in the voting for the AL Comeback Player of the Year Award. He was awarded the AL players&#x27; choice award for Comeback Player. He finished fourth in the vote for the MVP award.

===Toronto Blue Jays (2007–2008)===

On November 16, 2006, Thomas signed a two-year, $18 million contract with the Toronto Blue Jays. According to MLB.com, Thomas was scheduled to make $9 million in each of the two seasons. The contract included an option for 2009 contingent on his reaching 1,050 plate appearances over the next two seasons or 525 plate appearances in the second year of the contract.

On June 17, 2007, Thomas hit his 496th career home run against the Washington Nationals, giving him his 244th home run as a DH, breaking the record previously held by Edgar Martínez.

On June 28, 2007, Thomas hit the 500th home run of his career, becoming the 21st major league player to do so. It was a three-run shot off Minnesota&#x27;s Carlos Silva (Thomas&#x27; 500th home run came on the same day Craig Biggio hit his 3,000th career hit). Despite Thomas being a player for the visiting team in the game, the Metrodome scoreboard still paid notice to his achievement. He was later ejected from this same game.

On September 17, 2007, Thomas hit three home runs in his team&#x27;s 6–1 win over the Red Sox. It was the second time in his career that Thomas hit three home runs in a game, the first time also having been against the Red Sox on September 15, 1996 in a White Sox loss. Knuckleballer Tim Wakefield started both games for the Red Sox, and gave up five of the six home runs Thomas hit, including all three in the first game.

During spring training in , Thomas expressed his confidence about his team&#x27;s chances for the upcoming season. Thomas hit his first home run of the season against the Red Sox on April 5, in a 10–2 Blue Jays win. The following day, with the bases loaded and a 2–2 tie, Thomas hit a grand slam off Red Sox reliever Manny Delcarmen, leading the Jays to a 7–4 victory. On April 19, before a game against the Detroit Tigers, manager John Gibbons benched Thomas. Thomas expressed his frustration about the decision, and vowed that his career would &quot;not end like this&quot;. On April 20, 2008, the Blue Jays released Thomas.

===Return to Oakland (2008)===
Four days later after his release from Toronto, the Athletics and Thomas agreed to terms for his return. In his final game with the Athletics on August 29, he went 2-for-4. After playing 55 games with Oakland due to time on the disabled list, Thomas hit five more home runs to bring his career total to 521, while posting a .263 batting average. On October 31, 2008, he became a free agent.

===Retirement with Chicago===

After not playing in the 2009 season, Thomas signed a one-day contract with the White Sox on February 12, 2010, and announced his retirement. During the same press conference, the White Sox, for whom he played the first 16 seasons of his career, announced that they would retire his No. 35 on August 29.
Thomas is the only player in major league history to have seven consecutive seasons of a .300 average and at least 100 walks, 100 runs, 100 runs batted in, and 20 home runs (1991–1997). The only other player to have more than five consecutive seasons accomplishing this feat was Ted Williams, with six. This accomplishment is even more remarkable considering that Thomas played only 113 games in the strike-shortened 1994 season.

There are only six other players in history who have both hit more home runs and have a higher career batting average than Thomas: Ted Williams, Hank Aaron, Jimmie Foxx, Babe Ruth, Manny Ramirez, and Willie Mays.

==Stance against performance-enhancing drugs==
Early in his career, Thomas, by his own admission, used greenies to deal with the difficulties of traveling. Thomas implied that he stopped using them after the collective bargaining agreement between the union and the league regulated teams&#x27; travel schedules.

However, as early as , Thomas was advocating drug testing for professional baseball players. After hitting his 500th career home run in 2007, Thomas stated, &quot;It means a lot to me because I did it the right way,&quot; alluding to Barry Bonds&#x27;s then-ongoing pursuit of Hank Aaron&#x27;s career home run record. Thomas was, then, the only active baseball player to be interviewed during the preparation of the Mitchell Report. He did so voluntarily.

Thomas has been critical of the election of certain players to the Hall of Fame who, he has said, &quot;we all know&quot; used performance-enhancing drugs (PEDs). Thomas said he was &quot;not happy&quot; about the 2017 election of Jeff Bagwell and Iván Rodríguez who, he said, &quot;it&#x27;s no secret&quot; used PEDs.

In a 2018 interview with the &quot;Chicago Sun-Times&quot;, Thomas complained that his &quot;career was stepped on&quot; by competitors who used PEDs and &quot;was the most hurt&quot; of any players in that era.

==Playing accomplishments==

*Five-time All-Star (1993–1997)
*Four-time Silver Slugger Award winner (1991, 1993–1994, 2000)
*On June 28, 2007, Thomas became the 21st player in major league history to hit at least 500 home runs, after he hit a first-inning home run at the Hubert H. Humphrey Metrodome.
*Thomas is on a short list of players who have hit 500 home runs while maintaining a career .300 batting average (joining Hall-of-Famers: Babe Ruth, Jimmie Foxx, Mel Ott, Ted Williams, Willie Mays, Hank Aaron, and later joined by Manny Ramírez and Miguel Cabrera).
*Thomas is also on a short list of players to hit 500 career home runs and accrue at least 1,600 walks. The others are: Babe Ruth, Mel Ott, Mickey Mantle, Ted Williams and Barry Bonds.
*Thomas was the first player in major league history to win two Silver Slugger Awards each at two different positions (1993–94 at first base; 1991 &amp; 2000 as designated hitter).
*He was only the 11th player in history to win consecutive Most Valuable Player Awards, and the first American League player to do so since Roger Maris in 1960 and 1961.
*He was the third player (Eddie Murray and Hank Aaron) to collect 500 career home runs and 120 career sacrifice flies.
*His 138 walks in the 1991 season was not only the most accrued in a season by any American League player in the 1990s, it was the most for a season by any AL player since 1969 when Harmon Killebrew walked 145 times.
*Thomas&#x27; .729 slugging average for the shortened 1994 season was the highest season mark for an AL player since Ted Williams&#x27; 0.731 slugging average in 1957. Only Mark McGwire&#x27;s 0.730 in 1996 has been higher since then.
*In the shortened 1994 season, Thomas achieved an on-base percentage of .494, which was also the highest season mark for an AL player since Ted Williams&#x27; .528 on-base percentage in 1957. No AL player has topped this since.
*Retired as the all-time leader in home runs by a designated hitter (269); David Ortiz later broke his record.
*He is the only player in major league history to hit over 100 sacrifice flies and not collect a single sacrifice bunt, as well as the only player with over 10,000 plate appearances and no sacrifice bunts.
*The White Sox retired his uniform No. 35 during an on-field ceremony on &quot;Frank Thomas Day&quot;, August 29, 2010.

===Honors===
The White Sox announced that they would honor Thomas with a life-size bronze statue. It was unveiled on July 31, 2011, on the outfield concourse at U.S. Cellular Field. It is the eighth statue on the outfield concourse.

Thomas was elected to the National Baseball Hall of Fame in 2014 with 83.7% of the vote in his initial year of eligibility, and was inducted as a member of the White Sox on July 27, 2014. He was the first player inducted into the Hall of Fame who played more games as a designated hitter than as a position player.

===Appearances in the media===

Thomas appeared in the 1992 film &quot;Mr. Baseball&quot; (as a hot-prospect rookie wearing #68 named Ricky Davis who forces Tom Selleck&#x27;s character off the Yankees roster).

During the 1994–95 MLB strike, Thomas and a handful of other striking players appeared as themselves in the November 27, 1994, episode of &quot;Married With Children&quot; (Season 9, Episode 11).

In 1995, a baseball video game titled &quot;Frank Thomas Big Hurt Baseball&quot; was developed by Acclaim Entertainment and released for various platforms, with &quot;All-Star Baseball &#x27;97 Featuring Frank Thomas&quot; following in 1997. Also in 1995, Premier Technologies created a pinball machine (marketed under the Gottlieb trade name) titled &quot;Frank Thomas&#x27; Big Hurt&quot;; Thomas made an appearance in the documentary &quot;The History of Pinball&quot; in which he discusses the similarities between playing baseball and pinball. &quot;Frank Thomas&#x27; Big Hurt&quot; was later added to pinball video game &quot;The Pinball Arcade&quot; in late July 2016.

In 2007, he appeared in a promotional advertisement for the Blue Jays, in which he engages in a pillow fight with children. This ad drew the criticism of the Television Bureau of Canada, who requested a &quot;Dramatization. Do not try this at home.&quot; disclaimer be placed on the ad. A similar warning was placed on teammate A. J. Burnett&#x27;s commercial. The Blue Jays, humorously, then scheduled a &quot;Frank Thomas Kid&#x27;s Pillow&quot; promotion for September 2, 2007.

In 2012, Thomas participated in the Pepsi MAX Field of Dreams game in Columbus, Ohio. He batted cleanup and helped the Legends team win the ballgame.

He is also a substitute color analyst for the Chicago White Sox NBC Sports Chicago broadcasts and WGN broadcasts (until the channel ceased broadcasting the White Sox in 2020), filling in for Steve Stone on occasion.

In 2014, Thomas joined Fox Sports as a studio analyst for &quot;MLB on Fox&quot;. In April 2023, Fox Sports announced that Thomas was being replaced by Derek Jeter.

In June 2023, Thomas joined Apple TV+&#x27;s &quot;Friday Night Baseball&quot; coverage as an occasional interviewer and color commentator.

The first project released under the company was Kenny Lattimore&#x27;s 2017 album, &quot;Vulnerable&quot;.

Thomas started his own microbrew, Big Hurt Beer, in 2011. 

In November 2014, Thomas opened a brewpub, Big Hurt Brewhouse, in the Chicago suburb of Berwyn, Illinois. The establishment closed in November 2016 but reopened the next year under the new name 35 Sports Bar and Grill. It closed for good in February 2018.

In 2018, Thomas was named spokesperson for Guaranteed Rate, a Chicago-based mortgage lender, who also own the naming rights to the White Sox home stadium, Guaranteed Rate Field.

<doc id="372729" wikidata="Q464756" url="?curid=372729" title="Miyamoto Yuriko">
<text>was a Japanese novelist, short-story writer, social activist, and literary critic active during the Taishō and early Shōwa periods of Japan. She is best known for her autobiographical fiction and involvement in proletarian and women&#x27;s liberation movements.

Miyamoto began writing while she was still in school. She traveled for several years to the United States and the Soviet Union before returning to Japan, where her works were heavily censored and she was imprisoned repeatedly for her political views. She founded and operated a number of proletarian and feminist magazines during her career, many of which were also censored.

Her works include &quot;Nobuko&quot;, (&quot;The&quot; &quot;Banshū Plain&quot;)&quot;,&quot; &quot;Fūchisō&quot; (&quot;The Weathervane Plant&quot;), and other works of fiction and literary criticism. Much of her work is autobiographical and centers around themes of war, class, and gender relations. She and her husband, Miyamoto Kenji, continue to be honored by the Japanese Left for their vision and commitment toward Japanese women and the working class.

Her maiden name was Yuriko.

== Biography ==
===Early life===
Miyamoto Yuriko was born Chūjō Yuriko on 13 February 1899 in the Koishikawa district of Tokyo (now part of Bunkyō district) to privileged parents. Her father was a Cambridge and Tokyo Imperial University-trained architect, and her mother was a former painter, whose career had halted when she discovered that Ueno National Art School did not accept women. Miyamoto&#x27;s mother had no intention of forcing her into the Good Wife, Wise Mother role encouraged by the Meiji government.

Miyamoto attended Ochanomizu Girls&#x27; Middle School. She was aware at an early age of the differences between her own circumstances and those of the sharecroppers who worked her family&#x27;s land, as shown in her early work &quot;Nōson&quot; (&quot;Farming Village&quot;), which drew on many of the same influences as her later work &quot;Mazushiki hitobito no mure&quot; (&quot;A Crowd of Poor People&quot;). Miyamoto&#x27;s concern for differences in social and economic status drew her towards socialism, and later towards the early Japanese feminist movement.

Miyamoto took an early interest in literature, including both Japanese writers, such as Higuchi Ichiyō, Futabatei Shimei, and Natsume Sōseki, and non-Japanese writers, including Oscar Wilde, Edgar Allan Poe, Fyodor Dostoevsky, and Leo Tolstoy. While in her teens and a freshman in the English literature department of Japan Women&#x27;s University, she wrote the short story &quot;Mazushiki hitobito no mure&quot; (&quot;A Crowd of Poor People&quot;), which was accepted for publication in the prestigious &quot;Chūō Kōron&quot; (Central Forum) literary magazine in September 1916. Her story won a literary prize sponsored by the &quot;Shirakaba&quot; (White Birch) literary circle and was endorsed by Tsubouchi Shōyō.
=== Travel to United States and first marriage ===
In 1918, Miyamoto left the university without graduating and traveled to the United States with her father. She went to New York, where she studied at Columbia University and met her first husband, Araki Shigeru, with whom she would return to Japan. She broke a number of social norms, including entering a love marriage, proposing herself, and refusing to take her husband&#x27;s surname. The two were different in terms of age, socio-economic class, and intellectual interests, and the couple divorced in 1924, inspiring her semi-autobiographical &quot;Nobuko&quot; (1924–1926), which criticizes conventional ideas of gender and love as it relates the failure of the protagonist&#x27;s marriage, her travels abroad, and her quest for independence. Considered a feminist I-novel, it was serialized in the journal &quot;Kaizo&quot; (&quot;Re-creation&quot;) from 1924 through 1926 before being published as a book in 1928.

Upon her return to Japan, Miyamoto met Russian-language scholar Yuasa Yoshiko, through a mutual writing friend Nogami Yaeko. The two bonded over their mutual interest in Russian literature, particularly Chekhov, and Miyamoto contemplated dedicating &quot;Nobuko&quot; to Yuasa, with whom she entered into an intimate relationship after the failure of her marriage in 1924. The first few years of their relationship provided inspiration for another semi-autobiographical story, &quot;Ippon no hana&quot; (One Flower), which Miyamoto published in 1927.

===Travel to Soviet Union and second marriage===
In 1927, Miyamoto and Yuasa traveled to the Soviet Union, where they lived together for three more years. In Moscow, they studied the Russian language and Russian literature and developed a friendship with noted movie director Sergei Eisenstein. Yuasa dedicated herself to Russian translation, while Miyamoto observed the advancement of women in the Communist state.

Miyamoto and Yuasa returned to Japan in November 1930. Upon return, their relationship became rocky, in part due to the social pressures on women at the time; Yuasa openly identified as lesbian, while Miyamoto struggled with the place of female love in modernizing Japan, as she would express in later works. This disagreement was exacerbated by Yoshiko&#x27;s violent outbursts and accusations of Miyamoto&#x27;s dishonesty, which are evidenced by both women&#x27;s correspondences.

Upon their return to Japan, Miyamoto became editor of the Marxist literary journal &quot;Hataraku Fujin&quot; (Working Women) and a leading figure in the proletarian literature movement. She also joined the Japan Proletarian Writers&#x27; League and the Japan Communist Party, through which she met its secretary-general, the communist literary critic and her future husband Miyamoto Kenji. She separated from Yuasa and married Miyamoto Kenji in 1932, a transition which has been interpreted as less romantic than dutiful.

===Censorship in Japan===
In February 1930, following an anarchist-Bolshevik debate (&quot;ana-boru ronsō&quot;), Miyamoto Yuriko, along with Takamure Itsue, Yagi Akiko, and other editors who preferred anarchism, separated from women&#x27;s literary magazine &quot;Nyonin geijutsu&quot; (Women&#x27;s Arts) to form their own journal &quot;Fujin sensen&quot; (Ladies&#x27; Front). However, with government enforcement of the Peace Preservation Laws and the increasingly severe suppression of leftist political movements, Miyamoto&#x27;s works were heavily censored and her magazine was forbidden to publish.

In 1932, both Miyamoto Yuriko and Miyamoto Kenji were arrested alongside other Communist writers. Miyamoto was repeatedly arrested and harassed by the police and spent more than two years in prison between 1932 and 1942. Her husband, Miyamoto Kenji, was arrested again in December 1933 and held in prison until August 1945. During this time, she wrote a large number of essays and stories detailing the struggles of Communists in 1930&#x27;s Japan, including &quot;Kokukoku&quot; (&quot;Moment by Moment&quot;), which was not published until after her death and describes the tortures endured by Communist prisoners.

During Miyamoto Kenji&#x27;s imprisonment, Miyamoto Yuriko rekindled her friendship with Yuasa Yoshiko, though they did not resume their previous intimacy. Miyamoto Yuriko remained faithful to both her husband and to Communism, which for her had become intertwined. She was arrested in 1942 and suffered from heat stroke during police interrogation, sending her health into decline. However, both she and her husband were committed to their cause and never recanted their beliefs.

===Post-war===
In the post-war period, Miyamoto Yuriko reunited with her husband and resumed Communist political activities. This period was the most prolific in her literary career.

In 1946, Miyamoto wrote &quot;Utagoe yo okore&quot; for the new Japanese Literature Association; this essay urged writers to reflect on the nation&#x27;s history, their own lived experience, and people&#x27;s rights. In this essay and others, she advocated for twenty guaranteed rights, of which three would be adopted into the new Japanese Constitution (art. 14 cl. 1 &amp; art. 24 cl. 1-2).

Within a year of the end of the war, she published two companion novels, (&quot;The Banshū Plain&quot;) and &quot;Fūchisō&quot; (&quot;The Weathervane Plant&quot;), both descriptive of her experiences in the months immediately following the surrender of Japan. The former novel received the Mainichi Cultural Prize for 1947.

===Later life and death===
Miyamoto&#x27;s health declined gradually after her heat stroke in 1942, which had impaired her vision and her heart. She died of sepsis in 1951, shortly after finishing her last novel &quot;Dōhyō,&quot; as a complication due to acute meningitis. Her grave is at Kodaira Cemetery in Kodaira city on the outskirts of Tokyo.

== Writings ==
Miyamoto&#x27;s first novel, &quot;Nobuko&quot;, follows the titular character, who, like Miyamoto, is married in New York and returns to Japan. Her husband claims devotion but speaks differently in his actions, while her mother criticizes the marriage, and Nobuko&#x27;s creativity dulls until she ultimately joins the proletarian movement and leaves her husband. The novel touches many themes that were hotly contested at the time, including the possibility of &quot;love marriage.&quot; The novel is considered mostly autobiographical and was initially received with middling acclaim; however, it enjoyed surprising re-invigoration in the post-war era. Originally seen as a story about a woman seeking self-fulfillment through love and subsequent divorce, it came to be re-interpreted as a story of a woman&#x27;s liberation from a male-centric life narrative.

 (&quot;The Banshū Plain&quot;, 1947) is a soberly detailed account of Japan in August and September 1945. The opening chapter of The Banshū Plain depicts the day of Japan&#x27;s surrender. The setting is a rural town in northern Japan, where Miyamoto, represented by the protagonist Hiroko, was living as an evacuee at the war&#x27;s end. The chapter captures the sense of confusion with which many Japanese received the news of surrender—Hiroko&#x27;s brother cannot explain what is happening to his children, while local farmers become drunk. Miyamoto depicts a &quot;moral bankruptcy&quot; which is the major theme of the novel and which is shown as the most tragic legacy of the war.

&quot;Fūchisō&quot; (&quot;The&quot; &quot;Weathervane Plant&quot;, 1947) provides a thinly fictionalized account of Miyamoto&#x27;s reunion with her husband after his release from twelve years of wartime imprisonment. The couple&#x27;s adjustment to living together again is shown as often painful. Despite many years of activism in the socialist women&#x27;s movement, she is hurt when her husband indicates that she has become too tough and too independent after living alone during the war.

&quot;Futatsu no niwa&quot; (&quot;Two Gardens&quot;, 1948) and &quot;Dōhyō&quot; (&quot;Signposts&quot;, 1950) were written as sequels to &quot;Nobuko&quot;. The first concerns Nobuko&#x27;s relationship to her wealthy family and her development as a socialist woman writer, and the second follows Nobuko&#x27;s divorce and social growth in the Soviet Union. Both novels were criticized by Yuasa Yoshiko, who claimed the novels undermined the significance of female relationships, and some scholars have agreed that the novels are an indictment of Miyamoto and Yuasa&#x27;s earlier relationship.

Along with her short stories, Miyamoto also published a collection of essays and literary criticism &quot;Fujin to Bungaku&quot; (Women and Literature, 1947) and a collection of some of the 900 letters between her and her imprisoned husband &quot;Juninen no tegami&quot; (&quot;Letters of Twelve Years&quot;, 1950–1952).

==Political and social views==
Miyamoto was unique in her combination of socialism and feminism. In both movements, she considered it imperative that individuals seeks self-fulfillment. Her debut novel &quot;Nobuko&quot; explores in detail what it means to seek fulfillment and at what point it might be acceptable to violate social norms and combat &quot;social issues&quot; in its pursuit.

In contrast to many feminists at the time, Miyamoto resisted the advancement of women in &quot;womanly fields.&quot; Her work was rejected early in her career from popular women&#x27;s magazine Fujin Kōron (Women&#x27;s Forum) for being &quot;too difficult;&quot; however, Miyamoto took it as a compliment, interpreting that her work was &quot;too masculine.&quot; She resisted the popular idea of &quot;joryū&quot; (&quot;feminine writing&quot;), which held that women&#x27;s and men&#x27;s writing styles were fundamentally different. After a series of journalistic scandals in women&#x27;s magazine &quot;Seitō&quot; (&quot;Bluestockings&quot;), she believed her work would be better able to stand on its literary merit in general-reading magazines.

In contrast to many proletarian writers at the time, who tended to focus on male bonding and the situations of working men, Miyamoto focused on working-class women and the role of female bonding. She considered women&#x27;s liberation a part of the path to better social order, pushing against both traditional proletarian literature and mainstream Japanese thought.

As a member of the proletarian movement, Miyamoto was anti-imperialist (imperialism being the highest stage of capitalism); however, her work contradicts proletarian stereotypes by featuring urban centers and certain wealthy individuals as civilizing forces for outside groups. Certain of her works also locate revolutionary action within the family unit, contrary to most conceptions of both revolution and liberation at the time.

<text>Helen Hunt Jackson (pen name, H.H.; born Helen Maria Fiske; October 15, 1830 – August 12, 1885) was an American poet and writer who became an activist on behalf of improved treatment of Native Americans by the United States government. She described the adverse effects of government actions in her history &quot;A Century of Dishonor&quot; (1881). Her popular novel &quot;Ramona&quot; (1884) dramatized the federal government&#x27;s mistreatment of Native Americans in Southern California after the Mexican–American War and attracted considerable attention to her cause. Commercially successful, it was estimated to have been reprinted 300 times, with readers liking its romantic and picturesque qualities more than its political content. The novel was so popular that it attracted many tourists to Southern California who wanted to see places from the book.

==Early life and education==
Helen Maria Fiske was born in Amherst, Massachusetts, the daughter of Nathan Welby Fiske and Deborah Waterman Vinal Fiske. Her father was a minister, author, and professor of Latin, Greek, and philosophy at Amherst College. Two brothers, Humphrey Washburn Fiske (?–1833) and David Vinal Fiske (1829–1829), died soon after birth. There was also a sister, Anne. The children were raised as Unitarians. Anne became the wife of E. C. Banfield, a federal government official who served as Solicitor of the United States Treasury.

The mother died from consumption in 1844, when Fiske was fourteen. Three years later, the father died. He had provided financially for Fiske&#x27;s education and arranged for an uncle to care for her. Fiske attended Ipswich Female Seminary and the Abbott Institute, a boarding school in New York City run by Reverend John Stevens Cabot Abbott. She was a classmate of Emily Dickinson, also from Amherst; the two corresponded for the rest of their lives, but few of their letters survived.

==Career==

===Marriage, family, and early writing career===
In 1852, she married U.S. Army Captain Edward Bissell Hunt. They had two sons, one of whom, Murray Hunt (1853–1854), died as an infant in 1854 of a brain disease. Her husband died in October 1863, in an accident that occurred while he was experimenting with one of his marine inventions. Her second son, Warren &quot;Rennie&quot; Horsford Hunt (born 1855) died of diphtheria in 1865 at the age nine.

Most of Hunt&#x27;s early elegiac verse grew out of this heavy experience of loss and sorrow. Up to this time, her life had been absorbed in domestic and social duties. Her real literary career began when she removed herself to Newport, in the winter of 1866. Her first successful poem, &quot;Coronation&quot;, appeared in &quot;The Atlantic&quot; three years later. It was the commencement of a long and fruitful connection with that magazine, with &quot;The Century&quot; later, and with &quot;The Nation&quot; and &quot;Independent&quot;. The years 1868–1870 were spent in Europe, in travel and literary work. In 1872, she visited California for the first time.

In the winter of 1873–1874, she was in Colorado Springs, Colorado at the resort of Seven Falls, seeking rest in hopes of a cure for tuberculosis, which was often fatal before the invention of antibiotics.. While in Colorado Springs, Hunt met William Sharpless Jackson, a wealthy banker and railroad executive. They married in 1875 and she took the name Jackson, under which she was best known for her later writings.

She published her early work anonymously, usually under the name &quot;H.H.&quot; Ralph Waldo Emerson admired her poetry and used several of her poems in his public readings. He included five of them in his &quot;Parnassus: An Anthology of Poetry&quot; (1880).

Over the next two years, she published three novels in the anonymous No Name Series, including &quot;Mercy Philbrick&#x27;s Choice&quot; and &quot;Hetty&#x27;s Strange History&quot;. She also encouraged a contribution from Emily Dickinson to &quot;A Masque of Poets&quot; as part of the same series.

===Activist for Native Americans===

In 1879, Jackson&#x27;s interests turned to Native Americans after she heard a lecture in Boston by Chief Standing Bear, of the Ponca Tribe. Standing Bear described the forcible removal of the Ponca from their Nebraska reservation and transfer to the Quapaw Reservation in Indian Territory (Oklahoma), where they suffered from disease, harsh climate, and poor supplies. Upset about the mistreatment of Native Americans by government agents, Jackson became an activist on their behalf. She started investigating and publicizing government misconduct, circulating petitions, raising money, and writing letters to &quot;The New York Times&quot; on behalf of the Ponca.

A fiery and prolific writer, Jackson engaged in heated exchanges with federal officials over the injustices committed against the Ponca and other American Indian tribes. Among her special targets was U.S. Secretary of the Interior Carl Schurz, whom she once called &quot;the most adroit liar I ever knew.&quot; She exposed the government&#x27;s violation of treaties with American Indian tribes. She documented the corruption of US Indian agents, military officers, and settlers who encroached on and stole reserved Indian lands.

Jackson won the support of several newspaper editors who published her reports. Among her correspondents were editor William Hayes Ward of the &quot;New York Independent&quot;, Richard Watson Gilder of &quot;The Century Magazine&quot;, and publisher Whitelaw Reid of the New York &quot;Daily Tribune&quot;.

=== &quot;A Century of Dishonor&quot;===
In 1879, Jackson attended a lecture by Standing Bear about the creation of the Great Sioux Reservation in 1868. In response, Jackson wrote a book, originally published with her H. H. pseudonym but then in 1885 reprinted under her own name Helen Jackson, in which she condemned state and federal Indian policies. She recounted a history of broken treaties. &quot;A Century of Dishonor&quot; (1881) called for significant reform in government policy toward Native Americans. Jackson sent a copy to every member of Congress with a quote from Benjamin Franklin printed in red on the cover: &quot;Look upon your hands: they are stained with the blood of your relations.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot;, however, suggested the following in Jackson&#x27;s obituary:

===Mission Indian crusade===
Jackson went to southern California for respite. Having been interested in the area&#x27;s missions and the Mission Indians on an earlier visit, she began an in-depth study. While in Los Angeles, she met Don Antonio Coronel, former mayor of the city and a well-known authority on early &quot;Californio&quot; life in the area. He had served as inspector of missions for the Mexican government. Coronel told her about the plight of the Mission Indians after 1833. They were buffeted by the secularization policies of the Mexican government, as well as later U.S. policies, both of which led to their removal from mission lands. Under its original land grants, the Mexican government provided for resident Indians to continue to occupy such lands. After taking control of the territory in 1848, the U.S. generally disregarded such Mission Indian occupancy claims. In 1852, an estimated 15,000 Mission Indians lived in Southern California. By the time of Jackson&#x27;s visit, they numbered fewer than 4,000.

Coronel&#x27;s account inspired Jackson to action. The U.S. Commissioner of Indian Affairs, Hiram Price, recommended her appointment as an Interior Department agent. Jackson&#x27;s assignment was to visit the Mission Indians, ascertain the location and condition of various bands, and determine what lands, if any, should be purchased for their use. With the help of the US Indian agent Abbot Kinney, Jackson traveled throughout Southern California and documented conditions. At one point, she hired a law firm to protect the rights of a family of Saboba Indians facing dispossession from their land at the foot of the San Jacinto Mountains.

In 1883, Jackson completed her 56-page report. It recommended extensive government relief for the Mission Indians, including the purchase of new lands for reservations and the establishment of more Indian schools. A bill embodying her recommendations passed the U.S. Senate but died in the House of Representatives.

Jackson decided to write a novel to reach a wider audience. When she wrote Coronel asking for details about early California and any romantic incidents he could remember, she explained her purpose:

===Later writing career===
Although Jackson started an outline in California, she began writing the novel in December 1883 in her New York hotel room, and completed it in about three months. Originally titled &quot;In The Name of the Law&quot;, it was published as &quot;Ramona&quot; (1884), the name of the main character. It featured Ramona, an orphan girl who was half Indian and half Scots, raised in Spanish &quot;Californio&quot; society, her Indian husband Alessandro, and their struggles for land of their own. The characters were based on people known by Jackson and incidents which she had encountered. The book achieved rapid success among a broad swath of the public. Its romantic story contributed to the growth of tourism to Southern California, as people wanted to see places described in the novel.

After she married William Sharpless Jackson in Colorado Springs in 1875, she took his name and is known in her writing as Helen Hunt Jackson. One of her most popular poems is &quot;Cheyenne Mountain&quot;, about the mountain in Colorado Springs. She was friends with fellow writer Flora Haines Loughead who cared for her during her final illness.

Encouraged by the popularity of her book, Jackson planned to write a children&#x27;s story about Indian issues, but did not live to complete it. Her last letter was written to President Grover Cleveland and she said:

==Death and burial==

Jackson died of stomach cancer in 1885 in San Francisco. Her husband arranged for her burial on a one-acre plot near Seven Falls at Inspiration Point overlooking Colorado Springs, Colorado. Her remains were later moved to Evergreen Cemetery in Colorado Springs. At the time of her death, her estate was valued at $12,642.

==Critical response and legacy==

Jackson&#x27;s &quot;A Century of Dishonor&quot; remains in print, as does a collection of her poetry.

A &quot;New York Times&quot; reviewer said of &quot;Ramona&quot; that &quot;by one estimate, the book has been reprinted 300 times.&quot; One year after Jackson&#x27;s death the &quot;North American Review&quot; described &quot;Ramona&quot; as &quot;unquestionably the best novel yet produced by an American woman&quot; and named it, along with &quot;Uncle Tom&#x27;s Cabin&quot;, as the two most ethical novels of the 19th century. Sixty years after its publication, 600,000 copies had been sold. There have been over 300 reissues to date and the book has never been out of print.

The novel has been adapted for other genres, including four films (the last in Spanish), stage, and television productions. Valery Sherer Mathes assessed the writer and her work:

Her friend Emily Dickinson once described Jackson&#x27;s literary limitations: &quot;she has the facts but not the phosphorescence.&quot;

In a review of a film version, a journalist wrote about the novel, describing it as &quot;the long and lugubrious romance by Helen Hunt Jackson, over which America wept unnumbered gallons in the eighties and nineties,&quot; and complained of &quot;the long, uneventful stretches of the novel.&quot; In reviewing the history of her publisher, Houghton Mifflin, a 1970 reviewer noted that Jackson typified the house&#x27;s success: &quot;Middle aged, middle class, middlebrow.&quot;

Jackson wrote of her late works: &quot;My &quot;Century of Dishonor&quot; and &quot;Ramona&quot; are the only things I have done of which I am glad... They will live, and... bear fruit.&quot;

<text>In mathematics, when a mathematical phenomenon runs counter to some intuition, then the phenomenon is sometimes called pathological. On the other hand, if a phenomenon does not run counter to intuition, it is sometimes called well-behaved or nice. These terms are sometimes useful in mathematical research and teaching, but there is no strict mathematical definition of pathological or well-behaved.

==In analysis==
A classic example of a pathology is the Weierstrass function, a function that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere. The sum of a differentiable function and the Weierstrass function is again continuous but nowhere differentiable; so there are at least as many such functions as differentiable functions. In fact, using the Baire category theorem, one can show that continuous functions are generically nowhere differentiable.

Such examples were deemed pathological when they were first discovered. To quote Henri Poincaré:

Since Poincaré, nowhere differentiable functions have been shown to appear in basic physical and biological processes such as Brownian motion and in applications such as the Black-Scholes model in finance.

&quot;Counterexamples in Analysis&quot; is a whole book of such counterexamples.

Another example of pathological function is Du-Bois Reymond continuous function, that can&#x27;t be represented as a Fourier series.

==In topology==
One famous counterexample in topology is the Alexander horned sphere, showing that topologically embedding the sphere &quot;S&quot;2 in R3 may fail to separate the space cleanly. As a counterexample, it motivated mathematicians to define the &quot;tameness&quot; property, which suppresses the kind of &quot;wild&quot; behavior exhibited by the horned sphere, wild knot, and other similar examples.

Like many other pathologies, the horned sphere in a sense plays on infinitely fine, recursively generated structure, which in the limit violates ordinary intuition. In this case, the topology of an ever-descending chain of interlocking loops of continuous pieces of the sphere in the limit fully reflects that of the common sphere, and one would expect the outside of it, after an embedding, to work the same. Yet it does not: it fails to be simply connected.

For the underlying theory, see Jordan–Schönflies theorem.

&quot;Counterexamples in Topology&quot; is a whole book of such counterexamples.

== Well-behaved ==

Mathematicians (and those in related sciences) very frequently speak of whether a mathematical object—a function, a set, a space of one sort or another—is &quot;well-behaved&quot;. While the term has no fixed formal definition, it generally refers to the quality of satisfying a list of prevailing conditions, which might be dependent on context, mathematical interests, fashion, and taste. To ensure that an object is &quot;well-behaved&quot;, mathematicians introduce further axioms to narrow down the domain of study. This has the benefit of making analysis easier, but produces a loss of generality of any conclusions reached.

In both pure and applied mathematics (e.g., optimization, numerical integration, mathematical physics), &quot;well-behaved&quot; also means not violating any assumptions needed to successfully apply whatever analysis is being discussed.

The opposite case is usually labeled &quot;pathological&quot;. It is not unusual to have situations in which most cases (in terms of cardinality or measure) are pathological, but the pathological cases will not arise in practice—unless constructed deliberately.

The term &quot;well-behaved&quot; is generally applied in an absolute sense—either something is well-behaved or it is not. For example:

*In algorithmic inference, a well-behaved statistic is monotonic, well-defined, and sufficient.
*In Bézout&#x27;s theorem, two polynomials are well-behaved, and thus the formula given by the theorem for the number of their intersections is valid, if their polynomial greatest common divisor is a constant.
*A meromorphic function is a ratio of two well-behaved functions, in the sense of those two functions being holomorphic.
*The Karush–Kuhn–Tucker conditions are first-order necessary conditions for a solution in a well-behaved nonlinear programming problem to be optimal; a problem is referred to as well-behaved if some regularity conditions are satisfied.
*In probability, events contained in the probability space&#x27;s corresponding sigma-algebra are well-behaved, as are measurable functions.

Unusually, the term could also be applied in a comparative sense:

*In calculus:
**Analytic functions are better-behaved than general smooth functions.
**Smooth functions are better-behaved than general differentiable functions.
**Continuous differentiable functions are better-behaved than general continuous functions. The larger the number of times the function can be differentiated, the more well-behaved it is.
**Continuous functions are better-behaved than Riemann-integrable functions on compact sets.
**Riemann-integrable functions are better-behaved than Lebesgue-integrable functions.
**Lebesgue-integrable functions are better-behaved than general functions.
*In topology:
**Continuous functions are better-behaved than discontinuous ones.
**Euclidean space is better-behaved than non-Euclidean geometry.
**Attractive fixed points are better-behaved than repulsive fixed points.
**Hausdorff topologies are better-behaved than those in arbitrary general topology.
**Borel sets are better-behaved than arbitrary sets of real numbers.
**Spaces with integer dimension are better-behaved than spaces with fractal dimension.
*In abstract algebra:
**Groups are better-behaved than magmas and semigroups.
**Abelian groups are better-behaved than non-Abelian groups.
**Finitely-generated Abelian groups are better-behaved than non-finitely-generated Abelian groups.
**-dimensional vector spaces are better-behaved than infinite-dimensional ones.
**Fields are better-behaved than skew fields or general rings.
**Separable field extensions are better-behaved than non-separable ones.
**Normed division algebras are better-behaved than general composition algebras.

==Pathological examples==
Pathological examples often have some undesirable or unusual properties that make it difficult to contain or explain within a theory. Such pathological behaviors often prompt new investigation and research, which leads to new theory and more general results. Some important historical examples of this are:

*Ranked-choice voting is commonly described as a pathological social choice function, because of its tendency to eliminate candidates for winning too many votes.
*The discovery of irrational numbers by the school of Pythagoras in ancient Greece; for example, the length of the diagonal of a unit square, that is formula_1.
*The discovery of complex numbers in the 16th century in order to find the roots of cubic and quartic polynomial functions. 
*Some number fields have rings of integers that do not form a unique factorization domain, for example the extended field formula_2.
*The discovery of fractals and other &quot;rough&quot; geometric objects (see Hausdorff dimension).
*Weierstrass function, a real-valued function on the real line, that is continuous everywhere but differentiable nowhere.
*Test functions in real analysis and distribution theory, which are infinitely differentiable functions on the real line that are 0 everywhere outside of a given limited interval. An example of such a function is the test function, formula_3
*The Cantor set is a subset of the interval formula_4 that has measure zero but is uncountable.
*The fat Cantor set is nowhere dense but has positive measure.
*The Fabius function is everywhere smooth but nowhere analytic.
*Volterra&#x27;s function is differentiable with bounded derivative everywhere, but the derivative is not Riemann-integrable.
*The Peano space-filling curve is a continuous surjective function that maps the unit interval formula_4 onto formula_6.
*The Dirichlet function, which is the indicator function for rationals, is a bounded function that is not Riemann integrable. 
*The Cantor function is a monotonic continuous surjective function that maps formula_4 onto formula_4, but has zero derivative almost everywhere.
*The Minkowski question-mark function is continuous and &quot;strictly&quot; increasing but has zero derivative almost everywhere.
*Satisfaction classes containing &quot;intuitively false&quot; arithmetical statements can be constructed for countable, recursively saturated models of Peano arithmetic. 
*The Osgood curve is a Jordan curve (unlike most space-filling curves) of positive area.
*An exotic sphere is homeomorphic but not diffeomorphic to the standard Euclidean n-sphere.

At the time of their discovery, each of these was considered highly pathological; today, each has been assimilated into modern mathematical theory. These examples prompt their observers to correct their beliefs or intuitions, and in some cases necessitate a reassessment of foundational definitions and concepts. Over the course of history, they have led to more correct, more precise, and more powerful mathematics. For example, the Dirichlet function is Lebesgue integrable, and convolution with test functions is used to approximate any locally integrable function by smooth functions.

Whether a behavior is pathological is by definition subject to personal intuition. Pathologies depend on context, training, and experience, and what is pathological to one researcher may very well be standard behavior to another.

Pathological examples can show the importance of the assumptions in a theorem. For example, in statistics, the Cauchy distribution does not satisfy the central limit theorem, even though its symmetric bell-shape appears similar to many distributions which do; it fails the requirement to have a mean and standard deviation which exist and that are finite.

Some of the best-known paradoxes, such as Banach–Tarski paradox and Hausdorff paradox, are based on the existence of non-measurable sets. Mathematicians, unless they take the minority position of denying the axiom of choice, are in general resigned to living with such sets.

==Computer science==
In computer science, &quot;pathological&quot; has a slightly different sense with regard to the study of algorithms. Here, an input (or set of inputs) is said to be &quot;pathological&quot; if it causes atypical behavior from the algorithm, such as a violation of its average case complexity, or even its correctness. For example, hash tables generally have pathological inputs: sets of keys that collide on hash values. Quicksort normally has formula_9 time complexity, but deteriorates to formula_10 when it is given input that triggers suboptimal behavior.

The term is often used pejoratively, as a way of dismissing such inputs as being specially designed to break a routine that is otherwise sound in practice (compare with &quot;Byzantine&quot;). On the other hand, awareness of pathological inputs is important, as they can be exploited to mount a denial-of-service attack on a computer system. Also, the term in this sense is a matter of subjective judgment as with its other senses. Given enough run time, a sufficiently large and diverse user community (or other factors), an input which may be dismissed as pathological could in fact occur (as seen in the first test flight of the Ariane 5).

== Exceptions ==

A similar but distinct phenomenon is that of exceptional objects (and exceptional isomorphisms), which occurs when there are a &quot;small&quot; number of exceptions to a general pattern (such as a finite set of exceptions to an otherwise infinite rule). By contrast, in cases of pathology, often most or almost all instances of a phenomenon are pathological (e.g., almost all real numbers are irrational).

Subjectively, exceptional objects (such as the icosahedron or sporadic simple groups) are generally considered &quot;beautiful&quot;, unexpected examples of a theory, while pathological phenomena are often considered &quot;ugly&quot;, as the name implies. Accordingly, theories are usually expanded to include exceptional objects. For example, the exceptional Lie algebras are included in the theory of semisimple Lie algebras: the axioms are seen as good, the exceptional objects as unexpected but valid.

By contrast, pathological examples are instead taken to point out a shortcoming in the axioms, requiring stronger axioms to rule them out. For example, requiring tameness of an embedding of a sphere in the Schönflies problem. In general, one may study the more general theory, including the pathologies, which may provide its own simplifications (the real numbers have properties very different from the rationals, and likewise continuous maps have very different properties from smooth ones), but also the narrower theory, from which the original examples were drawn.
