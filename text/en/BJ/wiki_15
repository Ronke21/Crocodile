<text>Tyler Hamilton (born March 1, 1971) is an American former professional road bicycle racer. He is the only American rider to win one of the five Monuments of cycling, taking Liège–Bastogne–Liège in 2003. Hamilton became a professional cyclist in 1995 with the US Postal Service cycling team. He was a teammate of Lance Armstrong during the 1999, 2000 and 2001 Tours de France, where Armstrong won the general classification. He was a key asset for Armstrong, being a very good climber as well as time-trialist. Hamilton appeared at the 2000 and 2004 Summer Olympics. In 2004, he won a gold medal at the individual time trial. The first doping test after his Olympic victory gave a positive result, but because the backup sample was frozen, no doping offence could be proven. After he failed further doping tests at the 2004 Vuelta a España, Hamilton was suspended for two years from the sport.

Hamilton came back after his suspension and became national road race champion in 2008. In 2009, Hamilton failed a doping test again, and was banned for eight years, which effectively caused him to retire. In July 2010, he was subpoenaed to appear before a grand jury for the use of performance-enhancing drugs in cycling. In May 2011, Hamilton admitted that he had used banned substances in competition, and returned his gold medal. In 2012, he co-authored a book &quot;The Secret Race: Inside the Hidden World of the Tour de France: Doping, Cover-ups, and Winning at All Costs&quot;, which details his doping practices and experience in the world of cycling. On August 10, 2012 the International Olympic Committee (IOC) stripped Hamilton of his 2004 gold medal.

==Biography==
Hamilton was raised in Marblehead, Massachusetts, and attended Holderness School in Plymouth, New Hampshire, where he started cycling. After graduating in 1990, he attended the University of Colorado at Boulder as a ski racer but never finished the final semester of his BA degree course in economics. A back injury (two broken vertebrae while mountain bike training on ski jump) at the University of Colorado developmental ski team in September 1991 ended his skiing, and he switched to cycling.

He turned pro in 1995 for the Montgomery Bell Cycling team which later became the U.S. Postal Service cycling team and raced for them in the 1997, 1998, 1999, 2000 and 2001 Tour de France. Hamilton protected Lance Armstrong in the mountains, and was on Armstrong&#x27;s first three Tour de France winning Postal squads and quickly grew to stardom. Hamilton acted as a scout in individual time trials, riding as hard as possible to provide time-split comparisons for Armstrong. During this time he won the 1999 Danmark Rundt and the 2000 Critérium du Dauphiné Libéré, winning stages 4 and 5.

In 2001, Hamilton left U.S. Postal for Team CSC. He was made a leader under manager Bjarne Riis. Hamilton fractured a shoulder in a crash in the 2002 Giro d&#x27;Italia but still managed to win stage 14 and finish second overall, under 2 minutes behind race winner Paolo Savoldelli. Later that year, he participated in the 2002 Tour de France, riding in support of Carlos Sastre and finished 15th overall. In 2003, Hamilton became the first American rider to win Liège–Bastogne–Liège, breaking away from a select group of riders around four kilometers from the line in wet conditions. He later won the Tour de Romandie that year, as he prepared to race the Tour de France. In the 2003 Tour de France he broke his collarbone on the first stage in a pile-up. Instead of withdrawing from the race, he stayed to finish the tour, and exceeded everyone&#x27;s expectations when he was able to follow and attack Armstrong up Alpe d&#x27;Huez on stage 8. Later, he rode one of the Tour&#x27;s most memorable feats, winning stage 16 with a 142 km solo breakaway, gaining two minutes over the field. For his stage win, Hamilton was awarded the &quot;Coeur de Lion&quot; prize (French for &quot;Heart of the Lion&quot;, the name of the cheese maker that sponsored the award), as the most daring racer of the stage. He finished the 2003 Tour de France 4th overall and returned home nationally recognized.

In 2004, Hamilton left Team CSC and joined the Phonak Hearing Systems. He assembled a team of good, well-known riders and prepared for racing in the upcoming Tour de France, winning the 2004 Tour of Romandie for the second year in a row. Furthermore, he placed 2nd in the 2004 Dauphine Libere, beating Armstrong up the Mont Ventoux time trial which promoted him to one of the Tour de France favorites. However, in the 2004 Tour de France he dropped out on stage 13, after back pain mostly due to a crash on stage 6.

In 2021 he married his long time girlfriend Kristina Hamilton and they welcomed a baby boy together.

In 2019, Hamilton joined Black Swift Group, LLC, an investment advisor and money manager based in Boulder, Colorado.

===Olympic gold and doping confession===
At the 2004 Summer Olympics in Athens, Hamilton won the gold medal in the men&#x27;s individual time trial. That medal was placed in doubt on September 20, 2004, after he failed a test for blood doping (receiving blood transfusions to boost performance) at the Olympics. Two days after the announcement of his positive test at Athens, the IOC announced Hamilton would keep his medal because results could not be obtained from the second sample. The Athens lab had frozen the backup, which made it impossible to repeat the test. The Russian Olympic Committee appealed to the International Court of Arbitration for Sport to give Hamilton&#x27;s medal to Russian silver medalist Viatcheslav Ekimov. However, on June 27, 2006, the court rejected the request.

In the Vuelta a España, he won the stage 9 time trial on September 11, 2004, but left the race six days later, citing stomach problems. As winner of the stage, he was subjected to a doping test. He was told by the Union Cycliste Internationale (UCI) on September 13, 2004 that his two samples from two days earlier showed a &quot;foreign blood population.&quot; After supporting Hamilton, Phonak team managers withdrew their support after a second member of the team, Santiago Pérez, was found positive for the same offense at the 2004 Vuelta a España.

The positive sample at the Olympics, and the positive test at the Vuelta were not the only indications that Hamilton was manipulating his hematocrit level. In April 2004 his blood was found to have a high ratio of hemoglobin to reticulocytes (young red blood cells), indicative of EPO or blood doping. His score was 132.9; a clean athlete would score 90. The UCI suspends a rider if the score exceeds 133. This sample also showed someone else&#x27;s blood was in his bloodstream. However, neither piece of evidence in isolation constituted a positive drug test (and the test for a mixed cell population had not yet been adopted), so no action was taken.

On April 18, 2005 Hamilton was sanctioned by the United States Anti-Doping Agency and received a two-year suspension, the maximum sentence for a first offense.

On May 18, 2005, he appealed to the Court of Arbitration for Sport but, after allowing Hamilton to gather evidence, the court dismissed his appeal. Hamilton claimed the UCI-sanctioned test was insufficiently validated (and may have returned a false positive result) and that some of the agencies involved had concealed documents that would support his case. He also maintained that, even if foreign cells were present, they were natural and not the result of a transfusion.

Hamilton was banned until September 22, 2006, two years from the date his &quot;B&quot; sample in the Vuelta a España was found positive.

In 2010, Hamilton was subpoenaed by a federal grand jury to testify in their doping investigation of Lance Armstrong. Hamilton admitted in his testimony that he took banned performance-enhancing drugs during his cycling career.

On May 20, 2011, he also made the confession in an email to friends and family after a taping of the TV news show &quot;60 Minutes&quot;, during which he also implicated Lance Armstrong in the doping scandal. Hamilton then voluntarily surrendered the gold medal he won at the 2004 Summer Olympics to the United States Anti-Doping Agency, which said it would continue its joint investigative work with the IOC.

On August 10, 2012, the IOC officially stripped Hamilton of his 2004 Olympic gold medal and ordered that it be returned to them.

===Operación Puerto===
On June 18, 2006, the Madrid daily &quot;El País&quot; alleged that the Spanish civil guard investigation of doping in Spanish professional sport, &quot;Operación Puerto&quot;, had found that Hamilton paid more than US$50,000 to Dr. Eufemiano Fuentes between 2002 and 2004 to plan and administer his use of performance-enhancing erythropoietin (EPO), growth hormone treatment, blood doping, and masking agents. El País charged that Hamilton&#x27;s 2003 win of Liège–Bastogne–Liège came days after a &quot;double&quot; blood transfusion planned by Fuentes. The evidence presented by &quot;El País&quot; also implicated Hamilton&#x27;s wife in facilitating Hamilton&#x27;s doping. Fuentes was arrested with team director Manolo Saiz in May 2006 as part of the Operación Puerto investigation.

On June 26, 2006, Hamilton stated on his website: &quot;I was very upset to read the accusations against me and to see my name associated with the Operación Puerto investigation in Spain. I have not been treated by Dr. Fuentes. I have not done what the article alleges. In addition, I have never been contacted by authorities in Spain regarding these allegations. Therefore, it is impossible to comment on a situation I have no knowledge of.&quot;

The Copenhagen daily, &quot;Politiken&quot;, published further charges stemming from Operación Puerto on August 19, 2006. The article summarizes Hamilton&#x27;s alleged doping program during 2003. It quotes Danish doping researcher Rasmus Damsgaard on the organization Hamilton&#x27;s program would have required. It cites Bjarne Riis, Hamilton&#x27;s directeur sportif in 2003, denying knowledge of Hamilton&#x27;s doping. And the article states that the reporters attempted to contact Hamilton on numerous occasions but were unable to reach him. The article&#x27;s allegations are based on the rider&#x27;s doping and racing calendar obtained by the paper. The calendar was seized in Operación Puerto. The doping calendar indicates use of EPO, growth hormone, testosterone, blood doping, and insulin on 114 days over seven months during the 2003 season. The racing program correlates with Hamilton&#x27;s races in 2003, according to Politiken. The calendar includes two blood transfusions during the Tour de France. “The first time before the three stages in the Alps and the second before the 12th stage – a 47 km individual time trial,” write the reporters. The article stated that such an ambitious program would have required assistance – “at least four or five people,” according to Damsgaard.

The next day, August 20, 2006, the Belgian Dutch language &quot;Het Laatste Nieuws&quot; newspaper published more details of Hamilton&#x27;s doping diary. Among many allegations, the article claims he took EPO 30 times between December 2002 and February 2003 while riding for Team CSC. In 2003, claimed Het Laatste Nieuws, Hamilton used doping on 114 of his 200 racing days.

On September 14, 2006, USA Cycling announced information from the UCI &quot;regarding Tyler Hamilton and his alleged involvement in &#x27;Operación Puerto&#x27; along with a request to move forward with disciplinary action.&quot; USA Cycling referred the case to the U.S. Anti-Doping Agency.

On April 30, 2007, &quot;La Gazzetta dello Sport&quot; published allegations that Spanish authorities had completed a second dossier on Operation Puerto, 6000 pages long and naming 49 cyclists. Hamilton was again named, with the detail that he was #11 on Dr. Fuentes&#x27;s coded list of clients.

Hamilton did not admit any wrongdoing at the time, and his defense was based on personal integrity. As US cyclist Bobby Julich who finished third in the Athens time trial that Hamilton won noted:

:&quot;It goes against everything I&#x27;ve ever seen or known from the guy. But the rest of us at the Olympics passed the test. Why didn&#x27;t he? I&#x27;m sick of people who cheat, sick of cleaning up their mess and trying to explain it. There is heavy evidence against him. With that much evidence, I don&#x27;t know how he&#x27;s going to get out of it.&quot;

Ironically, Julich confessed in 2012 that he doped during his career. The same year, Hamilton published a book, &quot;The Secret Race&quot;, where he admits he was the client &quot;4142&quot; in Fuentes&#x27; documents.

===Return to cycling===

Beginning in spring 2007, Hamilton began cycling again, having completed his two-year ban. He rode briefly for Tinkoff Credit Systems. It supported Hamilton in the face of Operation Puerto rumors. However, on May 9, with rumors circulating about Hamilton&#x27;s role in the April 30 dossier, the team dropped him for the 2007 Giro d&#x27;Italia.

In September 2007, Tyler competed at the US national championship in Greenville, SC, coming sixth in the time trial and 12th in the road race. In December, Rock Racing said Hamilton would ride for them in 2008. Rock Racing was a professional team on the US circuit. Hamilton did not ride in the team&#x27;s season-opening Tour of California because of that race&#x27;s rules against riders involved in doping investigations.

Wearing his Rock Racing gear, Tyler Hamilton finished second of approximately 60 category one and two riders March 9, 2008 at a collegiate criterium in Denver&#x27;s City Park.

In July 2008 he won the Tour of Qinghai Lake in China which is a top ranked race (UCI 2.HC). In August 2008 he won the US National Road Race Championship.

===Second positive test===
On April 17, 2009 it was revealed that Tyler had failed an out-of-competition drug test; this time for a banned steroid (DHEA), which he claimed to be taking for anti-depression purposes despite knowing that it is on the World Anti-Doping Agency banned list. He announced his decision to retire.
In June 2009, Hamilton was given an eight-year ban after testing positive for a banned anti-depressant.

===Tyler Hamilton Training===
Since September 2009, Hamilton has been providing private training services to other cyclists.

===Autobiography===
On September 5, 2012, Random House (Bantam Books) published Hamilton&#x27;s memoir &quot;The Secret Race: Inside the Hidden World of the Tour de France: Doping, Cover-ups, and Winning at All Costs&quot;, coauthored with American writer Daniel Coyle. It won the 2012 William Hill Sports Book of the Year award. In the book, he details his career and his relationship with Lance Armstrong, for whom he was a teammate and a confidant. It also details some of the doping practices he and Armstrong were using on the team, such as EPO injections and blood transfusions. They parted ways when Hamilton went riding for CSC. This decision was motivated by the fact that Armstrong had become cold and vindictive toward him. Hamilton then recounts the 2 years spent riding for Bjarne Riis, his sympathy for the former rider and how Riis introduced him to Eufemiano Fuentes, a Spanish doctor who would be later investigated in the Operacion Puerto doping affair. He then recounts his years on the Phonak Team when he tested positive during the Vuelta a España to an alleged homologous blood transfusion.

Despite admitting throughout the work that he very regularly used EPO, testosterone pills and patches, and autologous blood transfusions (all banned practices), Hamilton staunchly opposed the sanction, since he had never used the blood of another person. It was speculated that Fuentes and his assistant had mixed the blood of another rider with his. His career in shambles, he raced for lesser teams after his suspension, tested positive for DHEA (in an OTC herbal anti-depressant) and retired. He later received a call from federal investigator Jeff Novitzky, who wanted to talk to him. He refused and was served a subpoena, whereupon he decided to tell everything. Some former teammates of Lance Armstrong and other witnesses appeared, until the federal government dropped the charges. The USADA took over the investigation under civil law, and Armstrong was ultimately stripped of all his titles from August 1998 onward. Armstrong was also banned from bicycle racing and triathlon competition.

<doc id="358712" wikidata="Q521750" url="?curid=358712" title="Stepan Fyodorovich Apraksin">
<text>Stepan Fyodorovich Apraksin (; – ), a relative of Fyodor M. Apraksin, commanded the Russian armies during the Seven Years&#x27; War. He should not be confused with his son Stepan Stepanovich Apraksin, who had a notable military career in the service of Catherine the Great.

==Early life==
Apraksin the Elder fought under Münnich against the Turks and rose rapidly to the rank of General. He was present at the taking of Ochakov in 1737 and brought to the Russian capital news about the capture of Khotin in 1739. Several years later, he led the Russian embassy to Persia.

==Politics==
At the Russian court Apraksin became one of the keenest opponents of both the pro-Prussian party and of Count Lestocq. He was one of the few devoted supporters of Chancellor Aleksey Bestuzhev, who ensured Apraksin&#x27;s promotion to Field Marshal and appointment to command the Russian army on the outbreak of the Seven Years&#x27; War in 1756.

==Seven Years&#x27; War==
The next year Apraksin took up the overall command of the army invading Prussia and won the Battle of Gross-Jägersdorf on 30 August 1757, albeit with heavy losses. The Russian court, upon receiving news of the victory, expected Apraksin to overrun all of Prussia. Instead, on hearing that Empress Elizabeth had suffered a severe relapse in health, Apraksin crossed the Neman River and returned to Russia, intending to support the heir to the throne (the future Peter III of Russia, who represented the interests of Frederick II of Prussia) in the event of the Empress&#x27;s death. According to another interpretation, he was recalled by Bestuzhev whose enemies plotted his downfall.

==Downfall==
As Elizabeth recovered, Bestuzhev fell from power and suffered banishment, and Apraksin came under the suspicion of having received bribes from the Prussian king. Put on trial, he died in prison under mysterious circumstances in August 1758 before the military tribunal had reached a decision as to the reasons for his scandalous retreat. He was replaced as commander in Prussia, by William Fermor who went on to fight the inconclusive Battle of Zorndorf against Frederick the Great.

<doc id="358716" wikidata="Q254983" url="?curid=358716" title="William Safire">
<text>William Lewis Safire (; Safir; December 17, 1929 – September 27, 2009) was an American author, columnist, journalist, and presidential speechwriter. He was a long-time syndicated political columnist for &quot;The New York Times&quot; and wrote the &quot;On Language&quot; column in &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; about popular etymology, new or unusual usages, and other language-related topics.

==Early life and education==
Safire was born William Lewis Safir in New York City, the son of Ida ( Panish) and Oliver Craus Safir. His family was Jewish and of Romanian origin on his father&#x27;s side. Safire later added the &quot;e&quot; to his surname for pronunciation reasons, although some of his relatives continued to use the original spelling.

Safire graduated from the Bronx High School of Science, a specialized public high school in New York City. He attended S. I. Newhouse School of Public Communications at Syracuse University but dropped out after two years. He delivered the commencement address at Syracuse in 1978 and 1990, and later became a trustee of the university.

==Career==
After dropping out of Syracuse, Safire worked with Tex McCrary throughout the 1950s, first as a gofer and later a public relations associate. He worked as a publicist for a homebuilder who exhibited a model home at an American trade fair at Sokolniki Park in Moscow in 1959—the one in which Richard Nixon and Nikita Khrushchev had their Kitchen Debate. A much circulated black-and-white photograph of the event was taken by Safire. Safire joined Nixon&#x27;s campaign for the 1960 presidential race, and again in 1968. After Nixon&#x27;s 1968 victory, Safire served as a speechwriter for him and for Spiro Agnew; he is known for having created Agnew&#x27;s famous alliterative term, &quot;nattering nabobs of negativism&quot;.
Safire prepared a speech called &quot;In Event of Moon Disaster&quot; for President Nixon to deliver on television if the Apollo 11 astronauts were stranded on the Moon. According to the plans, Mission Control would &quot;close down communications&quot; with the LEM and a clergyman would have commended their souls to &quot;the deepest of the deep&quot; in a public ritual likened to burial at sea. Presidential telephone calls to the astronauts&#x27; wives were also planned. The speech originated in a memo from Safire to Nixon&#x27;s chief of staff H. R. Haldeman, hence the colloquial name, the &quot;Safire Memo&quot;, in which Safire suggested a protocol the administration might follow in reaction to such a disaster. The last line of the prepared text contained an allusion to Rupert Brooke&#x27;s First World War poem &quot;The Soldier&quot;. In a 2013 piece for &quot;Foreign Policy&quot; magazine, Joshua Keating included the speech as one of six entries in a list of &quot;The Greatest Doomsday Speeches Never Made&quot;.

Safire joined &quot;The New York Times&quot; as a political columnist in 1973. Soon after joining the &quot;Times&quot;, Safire learned that he had been the target of &quot;national security&quot; wiretaps authorized by Nixon, and, after observing that he had worked only on domestic matters, wrote with what he characterized as &quot;restrained fury&quot; that he had not worked for Nixon through a difficult decade &quot;to have him—or some lizard-lidded paranoid acting without his approval—eavesdropping on my conversations&quot;.

In 1978, Safire won the Pulitzer Prize for Commentary on Bert Lance&#x27;s alleged budgetary irregularities; in 1981, Lance was acquitted by a jury on all nine charges. Safire&#x27;s column on October 27, 1980, entitled &quot;The Ayatollah Votes&quot;, was quoted in a campaign ad for Ronald Reagan in that year&#x27;s presidential election. Safire also frequently appeared on the NBC&#x27;s &quot;Meet the Press&quot;. Upon announcing the retirement of Safire&#x27;s political column in 2005, Arthur Sulzberger Jr., publisher of &quot;The New York Times&quot;, said:

&quot;The New York Times&quot; without Bill Safire is all but unimaginable, Bill&#x27;s provocative and insightful commentary has held our readers captive since he first graced our Op-Ed Page in 1973. Reaching for his column became a critical and enjoyable part of the day for our readers across the country and around the world. Whether you agreed with him or not was never the point, his writing is delightful, informed and engaging.

Safire served as a member of the Pulitzer Prize Board from 1995 to 2004. After ending his op-ed column, he became the full-time chief executive of the Dana Foundation, where he was chairman from 2000. In 2006, Safire was awarded the Presidential Medal of Freedom by President George W. Bush. Portions of Safire&#x27;s FBI file were released in 2010. The documents &quot;detail wiretapping ordered by the Nixon administration, including the tapping of Safire&#x27;s phone&quot;.

===Writing on English===
In addition to his political columns, Safire wrote a column, &quot;On Language&quot;, in the weekly &quot;The New York Times Magazine&quot; from 1979 until the month of his death. Many of the columns were collected in books. According to the linguist Geoffrey Pullum, over the years Safire became less of a &quot;grammar-nitpicker,&quot; and Benjamin Zimmer cited Safire&#x27;s willingness to learn from descriptive linguists. Another book on language was &quot;The New Language of Politics&quot; (1968), which developed into what Zimmer called Safire&#x27;s &quot;magnum opus,&quot; &quot;Safire&#x27;s Political Dictionary&quot;.

==Political views==
Safire described himself as a &quot;libertarian conservative&quot;. A &quot;Washington Post&quot; story on the ending of his op-ed column quotes him on the subject:

I&#x27;m willing to zap conservatives when they do things that are not libertarian. [After the 9/11 attacks,] I was the first to really go after George W. on his treatment of prisoners.

After voting for Bill Clinton in 1992, Safire became one of the leading critics of the Clinton administration. Hillary Clinton in particular was often the target of his ire. He caused controversy in a January 8, 1996, essay when, after reviewing her record, he concluded she was a &quot;congenital liar&quot;. Although she did not respond to the specific instances cited, Hillary Clinton said that she did not feel offended for herself but for her mother&#x27;s sake. According to Bill Clinton&#x27;s press secretary at the time, Mike McCurry, &quot;the President, if he were not the President, would have delivered a more forceful response to that on the bridge of Mr. Safire&#x27;s nose.&quot;

Safire was one of several voices who called for the Iraq War, and predicted a &quot;quick war&quot; and wrote: &quot;Iraqis, cheering their liberators, will lead the Arab world toward democracy.&quot; He consistently brought up the point in his &quot;Times&quot; columns that an Iraqi intelligence agent met with Mohamed Atta, one of the 9/11 hijackers, in Prague, which he called an &quot;undisputed fact&quot;. According to the CIA and the FBI, they were unable to confirm or deny the validity of this assertion. The source who made these allegations is alleged to have become concerned that such a meeting could have harmed his career. Nonetheless, Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and Ramzi bin al-Shibh do deny that the meeting took place. Safire insisted that the theory was true and used it to make a case for war against Iraq. He also incorrectly predicted that &quot;freed scientists&quot; would lead coalition forces to &quot;caches [of weapons of mass destruction] no inspectors could find&quot;.

Safire was staunchly pro-Israel. He received the Guardian of Zion Award of Bar-Ilan University in 2005. President George W. Bush appointed him to serve on the Honorary Delegation to accompany him to Jerusalem for the celebration of the 60th anniversary of the State of Israel in May 2008.

==Personal life and death==
Safire married Helene Belmar Julius in 1962. The couple had two children. Safire died from pancreatic cancer at a hospice in Rockville, Maryland, on September 27, 2009, aged 79.

<doc id="358719" wikidata="Q946446" url="?curid=358719" title="Youth Day">
<text>Youth Day or National Youth Day is a commemorative holiday in honour of young people, celebrated in different parts of the world on various dates throughout the year.

Many countries&#x27; observance of the day corresponds with International Youth Day on August 12, which has been officially recognized by the United Nations since 1999. There is also a World Youth Day, an event organized by the Catholic Church that takes place on the Sunday before Advent, and was initiated by Pope John Paul II in 1985.

== Dates by country/culture ==
== India ==
Youth Day in India is celebrated on January 12 on the birthday of Swami Vivekananda.

In 1984, the Government of India declared and decided to observe the Birthday of Swami Vivekananda (12 January, according to the English calendar) as National Youth Day every year from 1985 onwards. To quote from the Government of India&#x27;s Communication, ‘It was felt that the philosophy of Swamiji and the ideals for which he lived and worked could be a great source of inspiration for the Indian Youth.’

Swami Vivekananda&#x27;s Birthday, according to Indian Almanac (Vishuddha Siddhanta Almanac) is on Pausha Krishna Saptami tithi, which falls on different English Calendar dates every year. This is observed in various centres of Ramakrishna Math and Mission in a traditional Hindu manner which includes mangalarati, special worship, homa (fire-ritual), meditation, devotional songs, religious discourses, sandhyarati (versper service in the evenings), and so on.

The National Youth Day is observed all over India at schools and colleges with processions, speeches, recitations, music, youth conventions, seminars, Yogasana presentation, competitions in essay-writing, recitations, speeches, music, sports, and other programs on 12 January every year dunce.

== Philippines ==
Philippine president Elpidio Quirino first issued in 1948 a proclamation designating June 19 as Filipino Youth Day, coinciding with the birth anniversary of hero Jose Rizal, whose works had inspired the Filipino youths to serve the country. Educational and religious institutions, as well as civic organizations and local communities, are encouraged to join in that observance which is being commemorated until now.

August 12 annually was later declared as the National Youth Day in consonance with the United Nations&#x27; international commemoration, by virtue of &quot;Republic Act No. 11913&quot;, one of the three bills for the youth which lapsed into law in July 2022. Educational institutions are mandated to launch related activities provided that these will be undertaken at the discretion of the school administration.

Meanwhile, the Catholic Bishops&#x27; Conference of the Philippines began its own National Youth Day in 1986 with the declaration of December 16 as such, to implement its preferential apostolate for children and youth. Since 1987, celebrations are being held with gatherings in various dioceses and parishes, annually until 1998 when it has been held every 2–3 years. The one which would be held in 2021 was postponed due to COVID-19 pandemic, delayed until 2025.

== South Africa ==

Youth Day on 16 June is a public holiday in South Africa and commemorates a protest which resulted in a wave of protests across the country known as the Soweto uprising of 1976. It came in response to multiple issues with the Bantu Education Act and the government edict in 1974 that Afrikaans will be used as medium of instruction for certain subjects in black schools. The iconic picture of Hector Pieterson whose sister now works at a museum which honours Hector Peterson and his family claim that the apartheid regime spelled his name wrong, a black schoolchild shot by the police, brought home to many people within and outside of South Africa the effect of the struggle during the Apartheid government&#x27;s reign. It is celebrated as a public holiday across South Africa to remember the brave students who protest against Afrikaans as the only medium of language for education.

==Taiwan==

Youth Day () in Taiwan (officially the Republic of China) has been celebrated on March 29 since 1954. It commemorates the Huanghuagang Uprising of 1911, during which 72 young revolutionaries sacrificed their lives to overthrow the Qing Dynasty. The Uprising took place on April 27 (the 29th day of the 3rd month in Chinese Calendar), 1911 and is subsequently known as 3.29 Guangzhou Uprising. This event also marked the last unsuccessful attempt to overthrow the Qing before the Wuchang Uprising overturned millennia of dynastic rule in China to establish the Republic of China.

==Turkey==

In Turkey, the Commemoration of Atatürk, Youth and Sports Day () on May 19 is dedicated to the youth, as well as commemorating Kemal Atatürk, the &quot;Father of Turkey&quot;, and the beginning of the national liberation movement initiated by Atatürk in 1919

The day is celebrated in honor of the arrival of Atatürk to Samsun on May 19, 1919, when the Turkish War of Independence began.

==Yugoslavia==

Youth Day was celebrated throughout the former Yugoslavia on May 25. This was also a celebration of Josip Broz Tito&#x27;s birthday. Even though Tito was born on May 7, 1892, this date was chosen in remembrance of the Operation Rösselsprung in 1944, a Nazi attempt on his life on the date of birth listed on his forged personal documents. In the weeks preceding the festival, youth ran a relay around the country, and on his birthday Tito was ceremonially presented with the baton. The baton, which had passed through all major cities, contained a symbolic birthday message, ostensibly from the youth of the whole country. 

After the breakup of Yugoslavia, Youth Day continues to be celebrated in Tito&#x27;s birthplace of Kumrovec, gathering several thousand visitors annually.

<text>Hermine Braunsteiner Ryan (July 16, 1919 – April 19, 1999) was an Austrian SS &quot;Helferin&quot; and female camp guard at Ravensbrück and Majdanek concentration camps. She was the first Nazi war criminal to be extradited from the United States to face trial in West Germany. Braunsteiner was known to prisoners of Majdanek concentration camp as the &quot;Stomping Mare&quot; and was said to have beaten prisoners to death, thrown children by their hair onto trucks that took them to be murdered in gas chambers, hanged young prisoners and stomped an old prisoner to death with her jackboots. 

Braunsteiner was convicted for her complicity and collaborating in murders of over 1,000 people during the Holocaust. She was sentenced to life imprisonment by the District Court of Düsseldorf on April 30, 1981. She was released on health grounds in 1996, and died three years later.

==Early life==
Braunsteiner was born in Vienna, the youngest of seven children in a strictly observant Roman Catholic family, variously described as petite bourgeoisie (&quot;kleinbürgerlich&quot;) or working class. Her father, Friedrich Braunsteiner, was a chauffeur for a brewery owner and a butcher, while her mother was a washwoman and custodian. She was raised under impoverished circumstances in the Döbling suburb of Nußdorf.

Braunsteiner graduated from &quot;Hauptschule&quot; in 1933 with aspirations to become a nurse. Due to the death of her father in 1934, however, she was required to find employment to support the family and thus unable to enter nursing school. Braunsteiner worked as a maid, mostly in Vienna, though she briefly moved to live with relatives in the Netherlands for three months in summer 1936. Upon her return, she was hired as an assembly worker at the brewery her father formerly worked for.

=== &quot;Anschluss&quot; ===
From 1937 to May 1938, Braunsteiner worked in London for an American engineer&#x27;s household, but returned to Austria following the &quot;Anschluss&quot;, fearing possible internment by the British government in the event of war. Having become a German citizen through the annexation, Braunsteiner filed a request to undergo nurse training with the in Berlin, to no success. In August of the same year, she relocated to Germany for a job at a munition factory in Grüneberg before moving to Berlin to work at the Heinkel aircraft works.

== World War II ==

===Camp guard at Ravensbrück===
Unsatisfied with the menial labour, Braunsteiner found out through her landlord, a Fürstenberg police officer, that the recently established Ravensbrück concentration camp had open contractual positions for female supervisors (&quot;Aufseherinnen&quot;), with a weekly salary of 64 mark, quadruple her current income. She began her training at Ravensbrück on August 15, 1939, under Maria Mandel, receiving the service number 38. She remained there after the start of World War II, and the influx of new prisoners from occupied countries. After three years, a disagreement with Mandel led Braunsteiner to request a transfer in October 1942.

===Majdanek and Alter Flughafen===

On October 16, 1942, Braunsteiner assumed her duties in the forced-labor apparel factory near the Majdanek concentration camp, established near Lublin, Poland, a year earlier. It was both a labour camp (&quot;Arbeitslager&quot;) and an extermination camp (&quot;Vernichtungslager&quot;) with gas chambers and crematoria. She was promoted to assistant wardress in January 1943, under &quot;Oberaufseherin&quot; Elsa Ehrich along with five other camp guards. By then most of the Aufseherinnen had been moved into Majdanek from the Alter Flughafen labor camp.

Braunsteiner had a number of roles in the camp. She involved herself in &quot;selections&quot; of women and children to be sent to the gas chambers and whipped several women to death. Working alongside other female guards such as Elsa Ehrich, Hildegard Lächert, Marta Ulrich, Alice Orlowski, Charlotte Karla Mayer-Woellert, Erna Wallisch and Elisabeth Knoblich, Braunsteiner became known for her wild rages and tantrums. She noted for her particularly cruel treatment of children, whom she called &quot;useless eaters&quot;, regularly punishing them for minor infractions such as wearing stockings and pillows for warmth or incorrectly sewing their identification numbers to clothes, and in one instance, she beat a group of starved children with a ladle for coming too early for food distribution. One witness at her later trial in Düsseldorf, described an incident where a prisoner had concealed his child inside a backpack and upon Braunsteiner seeing movement in the bag, she whipped the child for several minutes before personally dragging her to the gas chamber. Other survivors testified how she killed women by stomping on them with her steel-studded jackboots, earning her the nickname &quot;The Stomping Mare&quot; (In Polish &quot;Kobyła&quot;, in German &quot;Stute&quot;). For her work, she received the War Merit Cross, 2nd class, in 1943.

===Ravensbrück again and the Genthin Subcamp===
In January 1944, Braunsteiner was ordered back to Ravensbrück as Majdanek began evacuations due to the approaching front line. She was promoted to supervising wardress at the Genthin subcamp of Ravensbrück, located outside Berlin. Witnesses say that she abused many of the prisoners with a horsewhip she carried, killing at least two women with it. A French physician, who was interned at Genthin recalled the sadism of Braunsteiner while she ruled the camp: &quot;I watched her administer twenty-five lashes with a riding crop to a young Russian girl suspected of having tried sabotage. Her back was full of lashes, but I was not allowed to treat her immediately.&quot;

== Post-war ==
On May 7, 1945, Braunsteiner fled the camp ahead of the Soviet Red Army. She then returned to Vienna, where Austrian police arrested Braunsteiner a year later on May 6, 1946, and turned her over to the British military occupation authorities. She was held in various internment camps until April 18, 1947. Braunsteiner was re-arrested by Austrian officials on April 7, 1948.

On November 22, 1949, the Austrian People&#x27;s Court in Graz convicted Braunsteiner of crimes against human dignity for non-fatal abuse in Ravensbrück, but acquitted of her crimes in Majdanek, including murder, due to a lack of witnesses. Braunsteiner was sentenced to three years in prison and had her property confiscated. With credit for time served, she was released from prison on 26 April 1950, having served four months. Braunsteiner was told that she would not face further prosecution, and was later granted partial amnesty in 1957. She worked at low-level jobs in hotels and restaurants in Carinthia until emigrating.

=== Emigration and marriage ===
Russell Ryan, an American, met her whilst working as a US Air Force mechanic stationed in Germany. They married in October 1958, after they had emigrated to Nova Scotia, Canada. She entered the United States in April 1959, becoming an American citizen on January 19, 1963. They lived in Maspeth, Queens, New York City, where she was known as a fastidious housewife with a friendly manner, married to a construction worker.

=== Discovery ===
Nazi hunter Simon Wiesenthal picked up on her trail by chance on a visit to Tel Aviv. He was at a restaurant there when he received a call from his friend that he could not make it to their luncheon. The maître d&#x27;hôtel announced the &quot;phone call for Mr. Wiesenthal&quot; and this led to his recognition by the other patrons, who stood up to applaud him. When he returned to his table, there were several Majdanek survivors waiting who told him about Braunsteiner and what she had done. Based on this information he followed her trail from Vienna to Halifax, Nova Scotia, and then, via Toronto, to Queens. In 1964, Wiesenthal alerted &quot;The New York Times&quot; that Braunsteiner might have married a man named Ryan and might live in the Maspeth area of the Borough of Queens in New York City. They assigned Joseph Lelyveld, then a young reporter, to find &quot;Mrs. Ryan&quot;. They first lived at 54–44 82nd Street in western Elmhurst and moved to 52–11 72nd Street in Maspeth. He found her at the second doorbell he rang and later wrote that she greeted him at her front doorstep and said: &quot;My God, I knew this would happen. You&#x27;ve come.&quot;

Braunsteiner stated that she had been at Majdanek only a year, eight months of that time in the camp infirmary. &quot;My wife, sir, wouldn&#x27;t hurt a fly&quot; said Ryan. &quot;There&#x27;s no more decent person on this earth. She told me this was a duty she had to perform. It was a conscriptive service.&quot; On August 22, 1968, United States authorities sought to revoke Braunsteiner&#x27;s citizenship, since she had failed to disclose her convictions for war crimes; she was denaturalized in 1971 after entering into a consent judgment to avoid deportation. In 1972, vigilantes firebombed a home where they mistakenly thought Braunsteiner was living.

=== Extradition ===
A prosecutor in Düsseldorf began investigating Braunsteiner&#x27;s wartime behavior, and in 1973 the West German government requested her extradition, accusing her of joint responsibility in the death of 200,000 people. On March 22, 1973, Braunsteiner was taken into custody as she awaited deportation. She was held at Rikers Island, then at the Nassau County Jail.

The United States court denied procedural claims that her denaturalization had been invalid (U.S. citizens could not be extradited to West Germany), and that the charges alleged political offenses committed by a non-German outside West Germany. Later, it rejected claims of lack of probable cause and double jeopardy. During the next year, she sat with her husband in United States district court in Queens, hearing survivors&#x27; testimony against the former &quot;Schutzstaffel&quot; (SS) guard. They described whippings and fatal beatings. Rachel Berger, alone among the witnesses, testified she would celebrate retribution against the former vice-commandant of the women&#x27;s camp at Majdanek.

The judge certified her extradition to the Secretary of State on May 1, 1973, and on August 7, 1973, Hermine Braunsteiner Ryan became the first Nazi war criminal extradited from the United States to West Germany.

==Trial in West Germany==

Braunsteiner was remanded into custody in Düsseldorf on August 7, 1973, until her husband posted bail on April 7, 1976. However, she returned to custody on December 8, 1977, after attempting to intimidate witnesses, and remained there until January 9, 1978. The West German court rejected Ryan&#x27;s arguments that it lacked jurisdiction, because she was not a German national but Austrian, and that the alleged offences had occurred outside Germany. It ruled she had been a German citizen at the time and more importantly had been a German government official acting in the name of the German Reich.

She stood trial in West Germany with 15 other former SS men and women from Majdanek. One of the witnesses against Braunsteiner testified that she &quot;seized children by their hair and threw them on trucks heading to the gas chambers.&quot; Others spoke of vicious beatings. One witness told of Braunsteiner and the steel-studded jackboots with which she dealt blows to inmates. Braunsteiner had two recorded screaming fits during the trial and accused a witness of lying during a break. 

The third Majdanek trial (&quot;Majdanek-Prozess&quot; in German) was held in Düsseldorf. Beginning on November 26, 1975, and lasting 474 sessions, it was the longest and most expensive trial in West Germany. The defendants included Ryan, former SS guard Hermann Hackmann and camp doctor Heinrich Schmidt. The court found insufficient evidence on six counts of the indictment and convicted her on three counts: the murder of 80 people, abetting the murder of 102 children, and collaborating in the murder of 1,000 people. On June 30, 1981, the court imposed a life sentence, a more severe punishment than those meted out to her co-defendants.

== Death ==
In 1996, complications of diabetes, including a leg amputation, led to her release from Mülheimer women&#x27;s prison. Hermine Braunsteiner Ryan died on April 19, 1999, aged 79, in Bochum, Germany.

After the publicity surrounding Ryan&#x27;s extradition, the United States government established in 1979 a U.S. DOJ Office of Special Investigations to seek out war criminals to denaturalize or deport. It took jurisdiction previously held by the Immigration and Naturalization Service.

==In popular culture==
The novel &quot;The Mare&quot; by Angharad Hampshire is based on Hermine Braunsteiner&#x27;s life.

<doc id="358724" wikidata="Q3036031" url="?curid=358724" title="Donald Creighton">
<text>Donald Grant Creighton (15 July 1902 – 19 December 1979) was a Canadian historian whose major works include &quot;The Commercial Empire of the St-Lawrence, 1760–1850&quot; (first published in 1937), a detailed study on the growth of the English merchant class in relation to the St Lawrence River in Canada. His biography of John A. Macdonald, published into two parts between 1952 and 1955, was considered by many Canadian historians as re-establishing biographies as a proper form of historical research in Canada. By the 1960s Creighton began to move towards a more general history of Canada.

Creighton&#x27;s later years were preoccupied with criticizing the then ruling Liberal Party of Canada under William Lyon Mackenzie King and his successor Louis St. Laurent. Creighton denounced the Liberal Party for undermining Canada&#x27;s link with Great Britain and moving towards closer relations with the United States, a policy which he strongly disliked.

==Background==

Creighton was born on July 15, 1902, in Toronto, to William Black Creighton, a Methodist minister and editor of &quot;The Christian Guardian&quot;, and Laura Harvie Creighton. He attended Victoria College, in the University of Toronto, where he received his BA in 1925.

He then attended Balliol College at Oxford University, where he received his MA before returning to Canada to teach history, at the University of Toronto for his entire career. Creighton belonged to a generation of English Canadians who were proud of the British Empire, and his anglophilia was often expressed in his books.

In 1926, Creighton married Luella Bruce. Their daughter, Cynthia Flood, is also a noted Canadian fiction writer.

He received the Royal Society of Canada&#x27;s J. B. Tyrrell Historical Medal in 1951, along with Jean Bruchési.

Creighton died in his sleep on December 18, 1979, from cancer, in Brooklin, Ontario, aged 77.

In 1967, Creighton was made a Companion of the Order of Canada.

== Creighton as an historian ==

Creighton was heavily influenced by Harold Innis and took an economic approach to Canadian history. His significant contribution to the field was the development of the Laurentian thesis, which defined the basis of Canadian history through geography and the nation&#x27;s dependence on its major centres. Creighton&#x27;s first works were studies in the Rebellion of 1837–38 in Lower Canada, which Creighton believed to be the product of a clash between the economic traditionalism of French Canada and the relentless drive of the Anglo business elite of Montreal. In turn, this led Creighton to the study of that elite, and hence into the study of the St. Lawrence in Canadian history.

In &quot;The Commercial Empire of the St. Lawrence&quot;, Creighton argued that the economic potential of the St. Lawrence system inspired successive generations of adventurers, explorers and businessmen to try to link the vast natural resources of the interior of North America with Europe. Despite heroic efforts, the dream of the St. Lawrence failed to come to life as too many impenetrable portions of the river meant it could not live up to its potential, and the development of a railroad system in the US proved to be more economical. Creighton was well known for arguing that the &quot;natural&quot; basis of trade in Canada ran east–west rather than north–south. In Creighton&#x27;s view, the failure of commercial elites to properly develop the St. Lawrence is what led to Confederation. Creighton argued that since impassable waterfalls and rapids prevented an economic empire from being built, Canadian elites embraced a political empire, namely Confederation as a consolation prize. The theme of Confederation as a poor substitute for an economic empire was underlined in &quot;The Road To Confederation&quot; and Creighton&#x27;s biography of Macdonald.

Creighton&#x27;s two most important works are &quot;The Commercial Empire of the St. Lawrence&quot; (1937) and his two-volume biography of Sir John A. Macdonald, entitled &quot;Young Politician&quot; and &quot;Old Chieftain&quot;. Both volumes won the Governor General&#x27;s Award for best non-fiction book in 1952 and 1955, were major best-sellers, and were credited with creating a major reassessment of Macdonald&#x27;s role in Canadian history. In Creighton&#x27;s view, Macdonald sought Confederation as a way of bringing to life the political St. Lawrence empire.

Creighton saw history as a literary art and rejected calls for history to be seen as social science. Creighton was famous for spending as much time crafting his prose as he did in research, and Creighton often claimed that the best historical work should read like a well written novel. Creighton disliked what he called &quot;fat funereal volumes&quot; of unreadable biographies, and argued that well-written books should be the historian&#x27;s objective. Creighton&#x27;s major influences were R. G. Collingwood, James Anthony Froude, G. M. Trevelyan, Edward Gibbon, and A. J. P. Taylor.

Creighton&#x27;s vision of Canadian history was ultimately a deeply pessimistic and tragic one as he felt Canada had the potential to be the world&#x27;s greatest country if only Canadians would follow the vision of the Fathers of Confederation, especially Macdonald&#x27;s. In his view, most Canadian leaders had chosen to neglect that vision and had instead allowed Canada&#x27;s potential to be squandered. The only leaders who merited the description of statesmen, in his view, were Macdonald and Sir Robert Borden. According to Creighton, Macdonald&#x27;s time in office was Canada&#x27;s Golden Age and without the exception of Borden every leader who came after Macdonald had allowed Canada to deteriorate. Thus for Creighton, Canadian history after 1891 was for the most part the story of missed opportunities, thwarted ambition, and hopes scattered as the dream that was Canada was slowly allowed to unravel.

Though Creighton normally tried to maintain a formal and cold pose, he was well known for his outspoken and passionate nature. His eruptions of rage led his publisher John Gray to call him &quot;the terrible-tempered Mr. Bang&quot;. Creighton often engaged in feuds with historians whose interpretations he disliked, but he was known to be kind-hearted and munificent towards his students, albeit severe with those who engaged in work that he thought was wrong-headed. He made no effort at objectivity and was openly subjective and partisan in regards to his likes and dislikes. Creighton was fond of contrasting Canada&#x27;s participation in the First World War and the Second World War. In Creighton&#x27;s view, Robert Borden was a tough and able leader who, despite initial mistakes and missteps, was able to fully mobilize Canada and ensure that Canada contributed disproportionately to the Allied victory in 1918. Borden took the necessary steps to win the war despite the unpopularity of many of his measures. Creighton saw the rest of Canadian history as one long slide, which he largely blamed on the Liberal Party. In contrast, Creighton saw William Lyon Mackenzie King as a weak and indecisive figure who was more concerned with safeguarding the electoral fortunes of the Liberals than winning the war, and who kept Canadian troops out of combat as long as possible to avoid difficult decisions on conscription. In Creighton&#x27;s opinion, thanks to Mackenzie King, Canada did not play as large a share as possible in the Allied victory.

Creighton was regarded by many as the foremost historian of his day, and his influence is still strongly felt. His books received wide public attention. Many of Canadian historians studied under Creighton, including Ramsay Cook, H. V. Nelles, and Michael Bliss. Creighton&#x27;s view of Canadian history is still often studied. He helped initiate the &quot;Canadian Centenary Series,&quot; a nineteen-volume history of Canada, and served as its advisory editor. His book, &quot;The Forked Road: Canada, 1939–1957&quot;, was part of the &quot;Centenary Series&quot;.

== Creighton as a nationalist ==

As the Cold War grew hotter after 1947, historian Harold Innis, a major influence on Creighton, grew increasingly hostile to the United States. Innis warned urgently that Canada was becoming a subservient colony to its much more powerful southern neighbour. &quot;We are indeed fighting for our lives,&quot; he warned, pointing especially to the &quot;pernicious influence of American advertising. ...We can only survive by taking persistent action at strategic points against American imperialism in all its attractive guises.&quot; This anti-Americanism moved Creighton to a growing conviction that Canada risked being absorbed by the United States culturally, economically and politically.

In later years, Creighton frequently expressed himself through the mass media. An intense Canadian nationalist, his opinions have often been criticized, particularly by those, such as historian Susan Mann, who saw Creighton as anti-Quebec. Creighton felt that the position of the French language in Canada should be more or less what the British North America Act had prescribed. As such, Creighton was not enamoured with changes such as official bilingualism that was introduced in the 1960s and 1970s. The Quiet Revolution of the 1960s had led to a more assertive French Canadian nationalism that Creighton had no sympathy with. In 1964, when anti-British riots erupted in Quebec City when Queen Elizabeth II visited &quot;la belle province&quot;, a furious Creighton wrote Elizabeth had been &quot;humiliated&quot;. A strong supporter of the Progressive Conservatives and small &quot;c&quot; conservative, Creighton&#x27;s heroes were Macdonald, Robert Borden, and John Diefenbaker, for whom Creighton served as a speech writer. Likewise, Creighton was proud of Canada&#x27;s British past, and regarded efforts to erase that past as a national disgrace. In his later years, Creighton moved towards the left and he was regarded as a Red Tory by the time of his death. In 1972, Creighton emerged as a leading critic of the proposed Pickering Airport.

Creighton disliked the Liberal Party as he saw the Liberals as the party of continentalism (i.e. moving Canada closer to the United States) and for taking steps that Creighton saw as an attack on Canada&#x27;s British heritage, such as replacing the Canadian Red Ensign with the Maple Leaf flag in 1965. Of all the Liberal leaders, it was Lester Pearson who Creighton disliked the most. Creighton attacked the Liberal continentalist Frank Underhill as almost a traitor, imaging in one essay a smug Underhill well satisfied after 1945 with the British Empire in decline, the United States ascendant and Canada falling into the American sphere of influence. In regard to federal–provincial relations, Creighton shared Macdonald&#x27;s view of a highly centralized confederation with the provinces subservient to the federal government. In Creighton&#x27;s opinion, it had been a great mistake on Ottawa’s part to allow the growth of provincial powers in the 20th century. In particular, Creighton was strongly opposed to the demands made by the Quebec government for more power at the expense of the federal government during the Quiet Revolution and afterwards. Creighton saw this as the first steps towards separatism. Creighton favored a tough line against the Parti Québécois government of René Lévesque, and was one of the first to advocate partitioning Quebec in the event of a vote to leave Confederation, writing that northern Quebec was historically part of Rupert&#x27;s Land and was given to Quebec by the Dominion government only in 1912.

Creighton&#x27;s determination to maintain British traditions, his close association with Diefenbaker, and his dislike of continentalism led him to be accused of anti-Americanism. Later, Creighton cemented his reputation for anti-American views with his only novel, 1978&#x27;s &quot;The Take-Over&quot;. As its title implies, the book dealt with an imaginary US take-over of Canada. Creighton saw himself as a lonely crusader not only against what he called the &quot;Authorized Version&quot; of Canadian history (i.e., the Liberal interpretation), but also against what he regarded as the widespread indifference and apathy felt by most Canadians towards their history. In Creighton&#x27;s view, the so-called &quot;Liberal Interpretation&quot; of Canadian history would ultimately lead to Canada being absorbed into the United States. Creighton frequently proclaimed the aphorism that a people who forget their past are also doomed not to have a future. Throughout his life, Creighton struggled hard to raise the profile of history in Canadian life, and to convince Canadians that they had a grand and glorious history worth celebrating.

<text>Clogs are a type of footwear that has a thick, rigid sole typically made of wood, although in American English, shoes with rigid soles made of other materials are also called clogs. 

Traditional clogs remain in use as protective footwear in agriculture and in some factories and mines. Although they are sometimes negatively associated with cheap and folkloric footwear of farmers and the working class, some types are considered fashion wear today, such as Swedish träskor or Japanese geta or even American crocs from Colorado .

Clogs are also used in several different styles of dance, where an important feature is the sound they produce against the floor. Clog dancing is one of the fundamental roots of tap dancing, but with tap shoes the taps are free to click against each other and produce a different sound from clogs.

== Typology ==

The &quot;Oxford English Dictionary&quot; defines a clog as a &quot;thick piece of wood&quot;, and later as a &quot;wooden soled overshoe&quot; and a &quot;shoe with a thick wooden sole&quot;.

Welsh traditional clog maker Trefor Owen identified three main varieties of clogs: wooden upper, wooden soled and overshoes.
* Wooden upper clogs; are made by hollowing out a lump of solid wood to make a combined upper and lower. Two main variants can be seen:
** whole foot clogs; where the wooden upper covers the whole of the foot to near the ankle, such as the Dutch klomp. They are also known as &quot;wooden shoes&quot;. Whole foot clogs can give sufficient protection to be used as safety footwear without additional reinforcements.
** half open clogs; where the wooden upper extends over the toes or slightly further, such as the Belgian sabots. The upper is similar in outline to a court shoe. Half open clogs may have additional covering or securing straps in some sort of fabric or leather.
* Wooden soled clogs; use wood for the sole only. Wooden soled clogs come with a variety of uppers:
** complete uppers made from leather or similar material, such as English clogs. For more protection, they may have steel toecaps and/or steel reinforcing inserts in the undersides of the soles
** open sandal type fitting. For example, Japanese geta
** toe peg styles. For example, Indian paduka
* Overshoes; are wooden soles with straps designed to be worn over other footwear for protection, commonly known as pattens. Patten style clogs are not used anymore. However the derivative galoshes are common worldwide.
These divisions are not fixed: some overshoes look more like whole foot clogs, like Spanish albarca, whilst other wooden soled clogs raise and protect clothing in the way that overshoes do, such as Japanese geta.

The type of upper determines how the clogs are worn. Whole foot clogs need to be close fitting and can be secured by curling the toes. In contrast wooden soled clogs are fastened by laces or buckles on the welt and therefore the toes are relaxed as in shoes. Half open clogs may either be secured like whole foot clogs, or have an additional strap over the top of the foot. Some sandal types, and in particular toe peg styles, are worn more like &quot;flip-flops&quot; and rely on the grip between the big and next toe.

==Flexing the foot==
As they are primarily made from wood, clogs cannot flex under the ball of the foot as softer shoes do. To allow the foot to roll forward most clogs have the bottom of the toe curved up, known as the cast. Some styles of clogs have &quot;feet&quot;, such as Spanish albarca. The clog rotates around the front edge of the front &quot;feet&quot;. Some Japanese and Indian clogs have &quot;teeth&quot; or very high pegs attached to the soles. The clog can rotate around the front edge of the front &quot;tooth&quot; as the wearer strides forward. Some medieval pattens were in two pieces, heel through to ball and ball to toes. Joining the two was a leather strip forming a hinge, thus allowing the shoe above to flex. Klompen may have a carefully placed ease (space left around the foot), which allows the foot to bend, and the heel to lift within or out of the clog. Thick, springy wool socks provide flexibility in the fit.

==History==
The use and prevalence of wooden footwear in prehistoric and ancient times is uncertain, owing both to the ambiguity of surviving records and the difficulty of both preserving and recognizing its remains. Used clogs also tended to be repurposed as firewood.

Some ancient Greeks apparently wore &quot;kroúpezai&quot; () made of wood. These were known to the Romans as . Both the Greeks and Romans also made sandals by attaching leather straps to wooden soles in various ways.

The ancient Chinese wore wooden &quot;jī&quot; () by at least the Han dynasty, when a form decorated with colorful ribbons and designs was used by women on their wedding days. Under the Jin, a different style shaped the entire shoe from a single piece of wood and, after the Tang, the southern Chinese wore &quot;boot clogs&quot; (, &quot;xuējī&quot;).

The oldest wooden footwear so far recovered in Europe was found at Amsterdam and Rotterdam in the Netherlands. These date from and and looked very similar to the wooden shoes still worn in the area. By about this era, wooden pattens were being used as overshoes to protect the wearer&#x27;s hose and indoor shoes when walking outside, particularly in inclement weather. Some shoes then began directly incorporating the wooden platform into their soles, like the Venetian chopines.

==Manufacture==

Since wooden footwear was a hand-made product, the shape of the footwear, as well as its production process showed great local and regional diversity in style. At the beginning of the 20th century machine-made wooden footwear was introduced. After WW2, in particular, wooden shoes became uncommon. They were replaced by more fashionable all-leather and synthetic footwear. At present, only the so-called Swedish clogs (wooden bottom and leather top) is still seen as a trendy fashion item, often as ladies&#x27; high-heeled boots. Nevertheless, traditional wooden footwear is still popular in several regions in Europe and in some occupations, for its practical use. Some historic local variations have recently been replaced by uniform national models.

More information on the various methods of manufacture can be found from the gallery below.

==Gallery==
Presented below are typical clogs from the countries where they are found. Like many folk items, the boundaries of manufacture and use are regional and therefore do not always exactly follow those of modern states. So, in some countries two or more different types can be found. It is also possible that one type can be found in bordering countries. For example, Danish, German, Dutch, Belgian and clogs from Northwest France look quite similar. The links provide access to pages dealing with the different types of clog, their design, origin and manufacture.

== Fashion clogs ==

In the 1970s and 1980s, Swedish clogs became popular fashion accessories for both sexes. They were usually worn without socks and were considered suitable attire for the &quot;avant-garde&quot; man.

In the 1980s and 1990s, clogs based on Swedish clogs returned in fashion for women. Platform clogs or sandals, often raised as high as 6 or even 8 inches right through between sole and insole, were worn in many western countries. The large mid layer was often made of solid cork, although some were merely of plastic with a cork covering. The sole, more often than not, was made of a light sandy-colored rubber.

In 2007, Dutch designers Viktor &amp; Rolf introduced high heeled Dutch clogs on the catwalk, with their winter collection of 2007/08. In 2010, Swedish clogs for women returned again in Chanel&#x27;s and Louis Vuitton&#x27;s Spring / Summer 2010 collection.

<text>Ostankino Tower () is a television and radio tower in Moscow, Russia, owned by the Moscow branch of unitary enterprise Russian TV and Radio Broadcasting Network. Standing , it was designed by Nikolai Nikitin. , it is the tallest free-standing structure in Europe and 12th tallest in the world. Between 1967 and 1974, it was the tallest in the world. The tower was the first free-standing structure to exceed in height. Ostankino was built to mark the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. It is named after the surrounding Ostankino district of Moscow.

Upon the completion of construction, approximately 10,000,000 individuals resided within the transmitter coverage area, which expanded to over 15,000,000 people by 2014. This area encompasses Moscow and the Moscow Region, as well as certain portions of the Vladimir and Kaluga regions. The ownership of the TV tower lies with the Moscow Regional Center, a division of the Russian Television and Radio Broadcasting Network (RTRN).

Under favorable weather conditions, the Ostankino TV Tower can be seen by residents of certain cities in the Moscow Region, including Balashikha, Voskresensk, Zelenograd, Korolev, Krasnogorsk, Lyubertsy, Mytishchi, Odintsovo, Podolsk, Khimki, and Shchyolkovo.

==History==

===Choosing a site for construction===

The primary function of the Ostankino TV Tower is to transmit TV signals. Prior to its establishment, this task was fulfilled by a structure devised by Vladimir Shukhov in 1922. During that era, the &quot;wicker&quot; tower located on Shabolovka Street was widely regarded as an extraordinary feat of engineering ingenuity. However, it became apparent in the 1950s that the tower had reached the end of its lifespan. Originally designed primarily for radio signal transmission, the tower found itself adapting to the emergence of television broadcasting in the late 1930s.

===Initial design===

The project was initially assigned to the Kiev Design Institute specializing in steel structures, which won the All-Union competition for the best TV tower design. Their proposal was an openwork metal tower similar to the Eiffel Tower in Paris or the Shukhov Tower in Moscow. However, the architects tasked with realizing the project were not very enthusiastic about it. Numerous engineers, including Nikolai Nikitin, a member of the competition committee and an expert in reinforced concrete and metal structures, came up with an alternative idea. Nikitin expressed a strong dislike towards his colleagues&#x27; project, deeming the design unappealing. He suggested building the tower out of reinforced concrete, citing a successful similar project in Stuttgart that had been completed two years prior, in 1956. He firmly believed that such a type of structure would be much more aesthetically pleasing. Nikitin&#x27;s proposal was taken seriously, and he was given the opportunity to prepare his own application. To ensure the strength and stability of the concrete frame, Nikitin incorporated 149 taut steel ropes. Nikitin later asserted that he had conceived the project overnight, and the prototype for the cone-shaped foundation of the tower was inspired by the upside-down lilium flower, known for its robust petals and sturdy stem, which the engineer had envisioned in his dream just days before the deadline for submitting sketches. However, it is possible that the reality was different. His design was inspired by the work of scientist Yuri Kondratyuk in the 1930s, who had envisioned a thin and hollow concrete structure for a wind farm on Mount Ai-Petri in the Crimea. Kondratyuk successfully designed a 165-meter structure and took precautions by reinforcing it with steel cables to ensure its stability against strong winds. The project was left incomplete due to several factors, but the concept remained in Nikitin&#x27;s mind. In 1932, architect Pier Luigi Nervi presented a project called the &quot;Monument of the Banner&quot; in Rome for a competition. It is uncertain whether Nikolai Nikitin was acquainted with these sketches, but the base of the structure bears a striking resemblance to the Ostankino TV tower.

Nikolai Nikitin suggested constructing a 540-meter rocket, but the proposed tower had minimal foundation, with only a 4.6-meter base underground. Many of Nikitin&#x27;s colleagues expressed concerns about the stability of the structure and recommended reinforcing it with 40-meter piles. They even wrote collective letters to halt construction. However, despite their efforts, the project was ultimately completed and the tower remained stable. This was primarily due to the shifted center of gravity. The center of gravity can be compared to the Soviet toy called Nevalashka, which means that the structure can sway in strong winds. The maximum deflection of the spire throughout the construction process was approximately 12 meters. Certainly, in addition to the shifted center of gravity, there was a need for further structural reinforcement. As a result, a total of 150 steel cables were carefully installed inside. In order to safeguard against any potential corrosion of the iron over time, the cables were coated with a substance known as gun oil. This particular type of petroleum oil is made thicker by combining it with petrolatum and ceresin.

===Construction===

The construction work commenced in 1959, leading to the establishment of an entire town dedicated to the project. This town included essential facilities such as a boiler house, a concrete plant, and a mechanical workshop. The tower trunk was successfully erected using a self-lifting crane, while alternative methods, specifically the utilization of helicopters, were employed to install the antenna atop the TV tower.

Leonid Batalov and Dmitry Burdin were responsible for shaping the structure&#x27;s appearance. They incorporated arches between the supports, constructed a glazed cylinder beneath the tower trunk to accommodate technical services and live broadcasting studios, and integrated illuminator windows in the upper section of the cone, giving the tower a striking similarity to a rocket. Furthermore, at the height of 325–360 meters, the tower was extended with a structure resembling a 10-storey house, featuring essential equipment, a revolving restaurant spanning three floors, and an observation deck inspired by the design of the TV tower in Stuttgart. Moreover, the balconies and trunk of the tower efficiently housed equipment for radio relay lines, mobile television stations, radiotelephone communications, special services facilities, and a meteorological complex.

The grand opening of the Ostankino TV Tower occurred in 1967, coinciding with the 50th anniversary of the October Revolution. However, initially only a portion of the structure was operational. The remaining works were completed by 1969, allowing for the opening of observation platforms and a restaurant for visitors. The tower has two observation decks: one is a glazed deck situated at a height of 337 meters, while the second is an open deck positioned approximately 3 meters closer to the top of the tower. Although it is referred to as &quot;open&quot;, there are bars in place for safety reasons. Additionally, it is only open on rare occasions, specifically during favorable weather conditions without wind.

Prior to 1976, the Ostankino TV Tower held the prestigious title of being the tallest structure in the entire world, standing at a height of 540 meters, thereby surpassing the Empire State Building to become the tallest free-standing structure in the world. However, this achievement was subsequently overtaken by the construction of the CN Tower, situated in the city of Toronto, Canada. Towering above the ground at a height of 553 meters, the CN Tower claimed the new record.

===Vantage point===

Over the course of 30 years leading up to the 2000 fire, the vantage point and the &quot;Seventh Heaven&quot; restaurant welcomed over 10 million guests. Following the fire, both the platform and the restaurant underwent reconstruction, with the observation deck being fully renovated by January 2008. Although the observation deck resumed operations with pilot tours on March 27, 2008, the restaurant remained closed as it continued its reconstruction efforts.

On 21 July 2018, there was a race up the tower, featuring athletes from 12 countries. They ran up the narrow, spiral staircase and reached the location at an altitude of 337.0 meters. The fastest of the 28 athletes was German, Christian Riedl, who made it to the top in 9 minutes and 51 seconds. The women&#x27;s winner was Cynthia Harris (US), who reached the top in 12 minutes and 15 seconds.

==Accidents==
===Fire of 2000===
On 27 August 2000, a devastating blaze not only engulfed the restaurant &quot;Seventh Heaven,&quot; but also caused extensive damage to the entire structure. Out of the 150 steel cables that once held the building together, only 19 remained intact after the fire had subsided. The fire initially broke out at a height of 460 meters, or approximately above the observation platform and the Seventh Heaven restaurant, around 3 o&#x27;clock in the afternoon. Within moments, the flames rapidly spread, engulfing nearby structures. It took the efforts of firefighters and emergency personnel until the following evening to finally extinguish the flames. The aftermath of the fire had far-reaching consequences, as the entire city of Moscow was left without television reception, with additional disruption to radio signals. While some channels were able to quickly restore their services, it took several months to completely repair and reinstate the signal citywide.

There were three fatalities as a result of the fire. A firefighter and lift operator died when their elevator cabin crashed to the ground level due to the fire.

The fire necessitated the evacuation of all visitors and staff from those locations, carried out within 90 minutes from the onset of the fire. The substantial loss incurred was primarily attributed to the outdated and inadequately maintained electronic equipment, a significant portion of which had been installed during the 1960s. Furthermore, the tower had become increasingly crowded with equipment.

The failure of the fire suppression systems required that firefighters and emergency workers had to manually bring heavy equipment, including chemical fire extinguishers, up the tower to stop the fire. Temporary firewalls made of asbestos were installed at a height of to prevent further spreading. As a result of the fire, television broadcasts in Moscow and the surrounding areas were mostly disrupted, except for the privately owned NTV station. However, the government prioritized state channels and therefore the RTR TV channel began transmitting to several districts in Moscow. The fire caused the upper spire of the tower to tilt slightly, which caused concerns that the tower might collapse. However, upon further inspection, it was determined that although the structure suffered significant damage, there was no immediate risk of collapse. Immediate efforts were initiated to rebuild the tower, which turned out to be a lengthy and costly endeavor.

The fire was the third disaster in Russia in a month, following an explosion in Moscow&#x27;s Pushkinskaya Metro Station (which killed 12 people and injured 150), and the sinking of the submarine &quot;Kursk&quot; in the Barents Sea, in which 118 died. Russian President Vladimir Putin stated that &quot;This latest accident shows the shape of our vital installations and the overall state of our country. We should not fail to see major problems in the country behind this accident, and we should not forget the economy. Whether or not such accidents happen again in the future will depend on how we work in this vital direction.&quot;

On 25 March 2005, the first new elevators since the August 2000 fire, made by the German company ThyssenKrupp, were tested and put into service. The new elevators travel at a speed of 

The tower remained inaccessible to visitors until its reconstruction was fully completed in 2008, marking the reopening of the structure&#x27;s observation decks. However, the restoration efforts did not extend to the tower&#x27;s restaurant, which remained closed for an additional eight years. The current restaurant within the tower&#x27;s premises bears little resemblance to its Soviet-era counterpart or the establishment that existed prior to the fire. This transformation is evident not only in the culinary offerings but also in the interior decor, showcasing a complete overhaul of the dining experience. and the Seventh Heaven restaurant reopened in November 2016.

===2004 base jumping accident===

On 1 July 2004, Austrian BASE jumper Christina Grubelnik collided with the tower, resulting in a concussion and causing her to lose consciousness. Her parachute became caught on a service platform located at a lower level. Russian emergency services responded quickly.

=== Fire of 2007 ===

In 2006, representatives of the Ministry of Emergency Situations assured that a significant fire incident at the Ostankino Tower would no longer occur as there were no combustible materials remaining within the structure. Following the necessary repairs, the tower has been compartmentalized into multiple sections. In case of a fire in any of these sections, access will be promptly restricted from both sides. Moreover, special installations have been installed to introduce nitrogen into the rooms of the tower during a fire, effectively preventing the development of combustion.

However, in May 2007, smoke was noticed at a height of 342 meters. As a result of the emergency situation, the elevators were temporarily out of service. Consequently, firefighters had to reach the location of the smoke on foot. The fire in the Ostankino TV Tower was classified as a second (heightened) level of complexity. As per the statement from the Emergencies Ministry, the cause of the fire at the tower was attributed to a breach of fire safety regulations during welding operations. All people inside the tower were evacuated and the fire was successfully extinguished, with no casualties.
===Elevator system===
Originally, German elevators by R.Stahl were installed in the Ostankino TV Tower. During the fire in 2000, the high temperatures resulted in the severe damage of almost all elevator cables, leading to their collapse. There were three individuals present in one of the cabins during the incident, and none of them survived.

ThyssenKrupp manufactured four new elevators in 2003, but their installation was not completed until November 21, 2005. Additionally, a service elevator from the Shcherbinsky plant was also installed in the building. One of the elevators in the antenna section of the TV tower was also designed by ThyssenKrupp. Currently, elevators #6 and #7, which are located above the observation deck and go up to approximately 450 meters, are not functioning. It is unlikely that they will be restored due to the elevator shafts being blocked with cables and feeders. As of September 2017, five elevators are in operation, consisting of four high-speed elevators from ThyssenKrupp and one service elevator from Shcherbinsky elevator plant.

The machine units of the high-speed elevators are installed at distances of 360 and 364 meters. These elevators have a feature where their speed can be automatically reduced when signals from sensors detect any tower sway. Additionally, the elevators are equipped with a unique system that enables contactless transmission of electricity to the cabin. This is achieved through inductive energy transfer using a transformer principle. To make this possible, inductive energy transfer elements are positioned in the shaft and current collectors are attached to the car. The CPS inductive power transmission system was provided by the reputable German company Paul Vahle GmbH &amp; Co. KG.

High-speed elevator No. 4 was put into operation in December 2006.

===Restaurant===
Within the tower, there is a restaurant called &quot;Seventh Sky&quot; that offers a unique dining experience. The restaurant was visited by the USSR leaders Nikita Podgorny, Alexei Kosygin, and Leonid Brezhnev on November 7, 1967.

The restaurant was made up of three halls named &quot;Bronze&quot;, &quot;Silver&quot;, and &quot;Golden&quot;. These halls were located on separate floors at heights ranging from 328 to 334 meters above the ground. Each hall had 24 four-seat tables arranged in a circle near the panoramic windows, with a radius of 9.2 meters. The total area of the halls was 600 m2, and each hall was 2.5 meters wide. Due to limited capacity, reservations were necessary in advance, with each level accommodating a maximum of 80 people. Since its opening in 1967, it has been considered the highest establishment for dining in the Soviet Union and was also one of the most expensive. In 1987, the cheapest hall (&quot;Bronze&quot;) charged 7 rubles for a day visit, and there was no choice of dishes. The restaurant was a popular tourist attraction in Moscow because its circular rooms rotated once every forty minutes. Throughout its operation, approximately 10 million people visited the restaurant.

The restaurant operated without interruption for a span of 33 years, until a fire occurred on August 27, 2000. This incident resulted in the complete destruction of all three floors, thus necessitating a lengthy period of sixteen years for the reconstruction process to be completed.

The fire of 2000 caused extensive damage to the interiors of &quot;Seventh Sky&quot; and its reconstruction was significantly delayed for a period of 16 years. Initially, the project faced challenges in securing an investor, and subsequently, the implementation of safety regulations by the Russian Ministry of Emergency Situations posed an obstacle as it limited the number of visitors to a maximum of 50 in the tower at any given time.

During the time frame of August 28, 2000 to April 2012, various measures were taken to enhance fire safety in the restaurant halls. These included the installation of new water fire extinguishing systems, treatment of all metal structures with fireproofing compounds, replacement of exterior cladding and old double-glazed windows with newer ones. Additionally, significant renovations were done on the ventilation system, air conditioning, water supply, and other related aspects in the restaurant. The Seventh Sky restaurant complex is currently operational.

In 2016, the coffee shop and cafe levels of the complex reopened. The restaurant hall was also launched in 2017, and had to be temporarily closed in 2020 due to the ongoing coronavirus restrictions. The Seventh Heaven restaurant complex comprises three levels, namely the coffee shop (at the 334 meter mark), the cafe (at the 331 meter mark), and the restaurant (at the 328 meter mark).

===Flagpole===
The Ostankino Tower held the title of the tallest flagpole in the world for a long time. On 27 April 1967, the flag of the USSR was placed on top of the tower and was regularly replaced twice a year, for May Day and 7 November. Originally, the flag was intended to be 50 by 20 meters, but it was reduced to 5 by 2 meters due to concerns about wind load.

In 1991, the flag was taken down and the tower remained without it for over 17 years. On 12 June 2009, which is the Day of Russia, the flag of Russia was hoisted on the tower. The flag specifically made for the tower was sewn in Vladimir using a reinforced fabric. The previous flag of the USSR, which was lowered in December 1991, is currently preserved in the tower museum.

<text>The KVLY-TV mast (formerly the KTHI-TV mast) is a television-transmitting mast in Blanchard, North Dakota. It is used by Fargo station KVLY-TV (channel 11) and KXJB-LD&#x27;s Argusville/Valley City/Mayville translator K28MA-D (channel 28), along with KNGF (channel 27). Completed in 1963, it was once the tallest structure in the world, and stood at 2,063 feet (629 meters) until 2019, when the top mount VHF antenna was removed for the FCC spectrum repack, dropping the height to .

In 1974, the KVLY-TV mast was succeeded by the Warsaw radio mast as the world&#x27;s tallest structure. The Warsaw mast collapsed in 1991, again making the KVLY-TV mast the tallest structure in the world until the Burj Khalifa surpassed it in 2008. The KVLY-TV mast remained the tallest structure in the Western Hemisphere and the tallest broadcasting mast in the world until the removal of its antenna in 2019.

==Location==

The mast is located west of Blanchard, North Dakota, halfway between Fargo and Grand Forks. It became the tallest artificial structure, and the first man-made structure to exceed in height, upon the completion of its construction on August 13, 1963.

==Construction==
The tower was built by Hamilton Erection Company of York, South Carolina, and Kline Iron and Steel, and required thirty days to complete, at a cost of approximately $500,000 (roughly $ today). Construction was completed August 13, 1963.

==Owners==

Owned by Gray Media of Atlanta, Georgia, the tower broadcasts at 350 kW on channel 36 for television station KVLY-TV (channel 11 PSIP, an NBC/CBS affiliate) which is based in Fargo, North Dakota. The tower provides a broadcast area of roughly , which is a radius of about . CBS/CW+ affiliate KXJB-LD&#x27;s translator K28MA-D also broadcasts on this tower at 15 kW on UHF channel 28 (also its virtual channel).

When the mast was built, the call letters of the television station for which it was built were changed to KTHI for &quot;Tower High&quot;. The top is reachable by a two-person service elevator (built by Park Manufacturing of Charlotte, North Carolina) or ladder.

==Specifications==
The tower consists of two parts: a lattice tower of ; topped by the transmitting antenna array of . The total height of both is . The antenna weighs , the lattice tower weighs , giving a total weight of . It takes up of land with its guy anchors. Its height above mean sea level is .

==Federal rule change==
Some time after its completion, the Federal Communications Commission (FCC) and Federal Aviation Administration (FAA) imposed a policy that states, &quot;Although there is no absolute height limit for antenna towers, both agencies have established a rebuttable presumption against structures over 2,000 feet above ground level.&quot; The FCC and FAA may approve a taller structure in &quot;exceptional cases.&quot;

<doc id="358752" wikidata="Q4990254" url="?curid=358752" title="Gabrielle Weidner">
<text>Gabrielle Weidner (17 August 1914 in Brussels – 17 February 1945 in Königsberg in der Neumark) was a Dutch resistance fighter playing an active role in the French Resistance during World War II.

==Early life==
Gabrielle Weidner was born in Brussels to Dutch parents. She spent her childhood in Switzerland, close to the French border. Her father, Johan Henry Weidner Sr., taught Latin and Greek at the Seventh-day Adventist Church in Collonges-sous-Salève, a village on the French side of the border. Attending secondary school in London, Gabrielle learned to speak several languages.

==Activities during World War II==
A devoutly religious woman, Gabrielle was living and doing church work for the Seventh-day Adventists in Paris at the outbreak of World War II. With the ensuing German occupation of France, she fled with her brother Jean Weidner and several others to Lyon, in the unoccupied part of France. Following the 22 June 1940 signing of the agreement with the Nazis to create Vichy France, she returned to Paris while her brother went to Lyon where he established the &quot;Dutch-Paris&quot; underground.

In Paris, she resumed her work for the Seventh-day Adventist Church. With the help of her brother and other volunteers, she secretly coordinated plans for people to escape from occupied Paris, following the Dutch-Paris routes out of France into Switzerland or Spain. She thus helped rescue at least 1,080 people, including 800 Dutch Jews and more than 112 downed Allied airmen.

==Arrest==
In February 1944, a young female courier was arrested by the French police and extradited to the Gestapo. Against all rules, she had a notebook with her containing names and addresses of Dutch-Paris members. She was brutally interrogated by a guard that held her head under cold water repeatedly. Under torture she revealed many names of key members of the underground network. As a result, a large number of Dutch-Paris members were arrested. The name of Jean&#x27;s sister, Gabrielle, was among those in the notepad. She was arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned at Fresnes prison in Paris, as it was hoped that her comrades would try to free her. In Fresnes she was treated fairly good, but when this trap did not work, she was shipped by railway cattle car to a concentration camp at Ravensbrück in Germany.

She entered Königsberg / Neumark, a women&#x27;s subcamp of Ravensbrück. The camp was called &quot;Petit-Königsberg&quot; by the French prisoners to distinguish the village in Neumark from the city Königsberg in East Prussia. In this concentration camp, the conditions were inhumane, and she was subjected to hard labor and beatings by camp guards. On 17 February 1945, several days after the liberation by Soviet troops, Gabrielle died in Königsberg / Neumark from the effects of malnutrition.

==Recognition==
On 24 May 1950, Gabrielle Weidner posthumously received the Dutch Cross of Resistance for her efforts in the war. On the Dutch Orry-la-Ville honorary cemetery (north of Paris), her name is recorded on a plaque dedicated to the Dutch resistors.

<doc id="358753" wikidata="Q519730" url="?curid=358753" title="Robert A. Taft">
<text>Robert Alphonso Taft Sr. (September 8, 1889 – July 31, 1953) was an American politician, lawyer, and scion of the Republican Party&#x27;s Taft family. Taft represented Ohio in the United States Senate, briefly served as Senate majority leader, and was a leader of the conservative coalition of Republicans and conservative Democrats who blocked expansion of the New Deal. Often referred to as &quot;Mr. Republican&quot;, he co-sponsored the Taft–Hartley Act of 1947, which banned closed shops, created the concept of right-to-work states, and regulated other labor practices.

The elder son of William Howard Taft, the 27th president of the United States and 10th chief justice of the United States, Robert Taft was born in Cincinnati, Ohio. He pursued a legal career in Cincinnati after graduating from Harvard Law School in 1913. With his brother Charles Phelps Taft II, he co-founded the law partnership of Taft Stettinius &amp; Hollister. Taft served in the Ohio House of Representatives from 1921 to 1931 and in the Ohio Senate from 1931 to 1933. Though he lost re-election in 1932, he remained a powerful force in state and local politics.

After winning election to the Senate in 1938 over incumbent Democrat Robert J. Bulkley, Taft repeatedly sought the Republican presidential nomination, often battling for control of the party with the moderate faction of Republicans led by Thomas E. Dewey. He also emerged as a prominent non-interventionist and opposed U.S. involvement in World War II prior to the 1941 Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor. Taft&#x27;s non-interventionist stances damaged his 1940 candidacy, and the 1940 Republican National Convention nominated Wendell Willkie. Taft sought the presidency again in 1948, but he lost to Dewey at the 1948 Republican National Convention. He opposed the creation of NATO and criticized President Harry Truman&#x27;s handling of the Korean War.

Taft again sought the presidential nomination a third time in 1952, and was widely viewed as the front-runner. However, Dewey and other moderates convinced General Dwight D. Eisenhower to enter the race, and Eisenhower narrowly prevailed at the 1952 Republican National Convention and went on to win the 1952 presidential election. Taft was elected Senate majority leader in 1953 but died of a cerebral hemorrhage while being treated for pancreatic cancer later that year. A 1957 Senate committee named Taft as one of America&#x27;s five greatest senators, along with Henry Clay, Daniel Webster, John C. Calhoun, and Robert M. La Follette Sr.—portraits of the &quot;famous five&quot; are displayed in the Senate Reception Room.

==Family and education==
Taft was born in Cincinnati, Ohio, on September 8, 1889, a product of one of America&#x27;s most prominent political families. He was a grandson of Attorney General and Secretary of War Alphonso Taft, and the elder son of President and Chief Justice William Howard Taft and Helen Louise &quot;Nellie&quot; Herron. His younger brother Charles Phelps Taft II served as the mayor of Cincinnati and was the unsuccessful Republican candidate for Ohio Governor in 1952. As a boy Taft spent four years in the Philippines, where his father was Governor-General. He was first in his class at the Taft School (run by his uncle), at Yale College (1910), and at Harvard Law School (1913). He was a member of Psi Upsilon, his father&#x27;s fraternity and Skull and Bones, and edited the &quot;Harvard Law Review&quot;. In 1913, Taft scored the highest in the state on the Ohio bar exam. He then practiced for four years with the firm of Maxwell and Ramsey (now Graydon Head &amp; Ritchey LLP) in Cincinnati, his family&#x27;s ancestral city. After a two-year stint in Washington working for the Food and Drug Administration, he returned to Cincinnati and opened his own law office. In 1924, he and his brother Charles helped form the law partnership Taft Stettinius &amp; Hollister, with which Taft continued to be associated until his death and continues to carry his name today.

On October 17, 1914, he married Martha Wheaton Bowers (1889–1958), daughter of Lloyd Wheaton Bowers and Louisa Bennett Wilson. Taft himself appeared taciturn and coldly intellectual, characteristics that were offset by his gregarious wife, who served the same role his mother had for his father, as a confidante and powerful asset to her husband&#x27;s political career. In May 1950, Martha suffered a severe stroke that left her an invalid, leaving her confined to a wheelchair, unable to take care of herself, and reliant upon her husband, children, and nurses for support. A biographer called his wife&#x27;s stroke &quot;the deepest personal blow of [Taft&#x27;s] life ... there was no denying that he suffered.&quot; Following her stroke, Taft faithfully assisted his wife, called her every night when he was away on business, read stories to her at night when he was at home, &quot;pushed her about in her wheelchair, lifted her in and out of cars ... tenderly did his best to make her feel comfortable and happy, and helped feed and take care of her at public functions&quot; – facts which, his admirers noted, belied his public image as a cold and uncaring person.

They had four sons:

*William Howard Taft III (1915–1991), who became ambassador to Ireland
*Robert Alphonso Taft Jr. (1917–1993), who was also elected to the U.S. Senate
*Lloyd Bowers Taft (1923–1985), who worked as an investment banker in Cincinnati,
*Horace Dwight Taft (1925–1983), who became a professor of physics and dean at Yale.

Two of Robert and Martha&#x27;s grandsons are Robert Alphonso &quot;Bob&quot; Taft III (born 1942), Governor of Ohio from 1999 to 2007, and William Howard Taft IV (born 1945), Deputy Secretary of Defense from 1984 to 1989.

In 1917, Taft and his wife bought a farm in Indian Hill, a well-to-do suburb of Cincinnati. Called Sky Farm, it would serve as Taft&#x27;s primary residence for the rest of his life. The Tafts gradually made extensive renovations that turned the small farmhouse into a sixteen-room mansion. On the farm Taft enjoyed growing strawberries, asparagus, and potatoes for profit. During the summer, Taft often vacationed with his wife and children at the Taft family&#x27;s summer home at Murray Bay, in Quebec, Canada. Although he was nominally a member of the Episcopal church, his biographer James Patterson noted that Taft&#x27;s &quot;religious inclinations were weak&quot; and that he was a &quot;Sunday morning golfer, not a church-going Episcopalian&quot;. When reporters asked his wife Martha what church he attended, she jokingly replied, &quot;I&#x27;d have to say the Burning Tree&quot;, an exclusive country club and golf course in suburban Washington.

==Early public career==
When the United States entered World War I in April 1917, Taft attempted to join the army but was rejected due to his poor eyesight. Instead, he joined the legal staff of the Food and Drug Administration where he met Herbert Hoover, who became his idol. In 1918 and 1919, he was in Paris as legal adviser for the American Relief Administration, Hoover&#x27;s agency to distribute food to wartorn Europe. He came to distrust governmental bureaucracy as inefficient and detrimental to the rights of the individual, a principle he promoted throughout his career. He urged membership in the League of Nations but generally distrusted European politicians. He endorsed the idea of a powerful world court to enforce international law, but no such idealized court ever existed during his lifetime. He returned to Cincinnati in late 1919, promoted Hoover for president in 1920, and opened a law firm with his brother, Charles Taft.

In 1920 he was elected to the Ohio House of Representatives, where he served as Republican floor leader and was Speaker of the House from January 1926 to January 1927. In 1930, he was elected to the Ohio Senate, but was defeated for re-election in 1932; it would be the only general election defeat of his career. He was an outspoken opponent of the Ku Klux Klan, and he did not support prohibition. In 1925, he voted against a bill, sponsored by Ohio state representatives who were members of the Ku Klux Klan, to outlaw dancing on Sundays, and he led the fight against a Klan-sponsored bill requiring all Ohio public school teachers to read at least ten verses of the Bible each day in class. In his speech opposing the bill, Taft stated that religion should be taught in churches, not public schools, and while the Bible was great literature, &quot;in it religion overshadows all else.&quot; The bill passed the legislature over the opposition of Taft and his allies, but it was later vetoed by Ohio&#x27;s governor.

Taft&#x27;s period of service in the Ohio state legislature was most notable for his efforts to reform and modernize the state&#x27;s antiquated tax laws. Throughout the 1920s and 1930s, Taft was a powerful figure in local and state political and legal circles, and he was known as a loyal Republican who never threatened to bolt the party. He confessed in 1922 that &quot;while I have no difficulty talking, I don&#x27;t know how to do any of the eloquence business which makes for enthusiasm or applause.&quot; A lackluster speaker who did not mix well or glad-hand supporters, Taft was still a tireless worker with a broad range of policy and political interests. His total grasp of the complex details of every issue impressed reporters and politicians. Democrats joked that &quot;Taft has the best mind in Washington, until he makes it up.&quot; Taft&#x27;s loyalty to the conservative politicians who controlled Ohio&#x27;s Republican Party had a price, as it often caused conflict with his younger brother, Charles, who as a local politician in Cincinnati had gained a reputation as a party and liberal; however, despite their occasional policy disagreements, Charles loyally supported all three of his brother&#x27;s presidential bids.

==US Senator==
Taft was elected to the first of his three terms as US Senator in 1938. He first defeated Ohio Supreme Court justice Arthur H. Day in the Republican primary, and then defeated the Democratic incumbent, Robert Bulkley, in the general election. Taft engaged Bulkley in several debates and was generally regarded as the winner. He struggled in the earlier debates but later came out on top through assistance from his wife, Martha, who would be regarded as the most valuable asset in his campaign. As a result, Taft gained the upper hand against Bulkley, who had earlier been regarded as the frontrunner in the race, and won the election by nearly 171,000 votes, or 53.6% of the total vote. During his first two years as a Senator, the Tafts rented a home in Washington, but in 1941 they purchased a brick Victorian home, built in the 1880s, in the city&#x27;s Georgetown neighborhood. The home – despite lacking &quot;the grace and amenities of Sky Farm&quot;, their home in Ohio – remained their Washington residence until Taft&#x27;s death in 1953.

===Political positions===
Co-operating with Conservative Democrats, he led the conservative coalition that opposed the New Deal. The Republican gains in the 1938 elections, combined with the creation of the conservative coalition, had stopped the expansion of the New Deal. However, Taft saw his mission as not only stopping the growth of the New Deal but also eliminating many of its government programs.

During his first term in the Senate, Taft criticized what he believed was the inefficiency and waste of many New Deal programs and of the need to let private enterprise and businesses restore the nation&#x27;s economy instead of relying upon government programs to end the Great Depression. He condemned the New Deal as socialist and attacked deficit spending, high farm subsidies, governmental bureaucracy, the National Labor Relations Board, and nationalized health insurance. However, he did not always follow the ideology of the conservative coalition, supporting Social Security, subsidized loans for farmers and homeowners, the Reconstruction Finance Corporation, public works projects, public housing, workers&#x27; right to strike and federal aid to public education, having sponsored the Housing Act of 1949. As noted by Ralph Nader, Taft was also willing to revise the Taft-Hartley Act in order to make it more balanced and more favorable towards labor unions. Whereas some fellow liberals thought of Taft as a stooge for big business, Burton K. Wheeler described Taft as a &quot;honest conservative&quot;, believing that he &quot;would not be pushed around by Wall Street or the unintelligent reactionaries&quot;, and endorsed his 1948 presidential campaign.

Taft set forward a conservative domestic program that promoted limited government spending, a balanced federal budget, low taxes, pro-business policies to spur economic growth, a limited number of social welfare programs (such as Social Security, a minimum wage, public housing and federal aid to public education), and an adequate national defense focused on strengthening the Navy and Air Force. In foreign policy, he advocated noninvolvement in European wars and military alliances. He also strongly opposed the military draft on the principle that it limited a young man&#x27;s freedom of choice. Various historians have described Taft, in terms of political philosophy, as a libertarian; he opposed nearly all forms of governmental interference in both the national economy and in the private lives of citizens. Republican Party historian Geoffrey Kabaservice has described Taft as a politician who opposed bigness in labor, business and government. President Eisenhower found Taft &quot;extraordinarily leftish&quot; in some domestic positions.

On Independence Day 1945, Taft announced his intention to combat the Bretton Woods monetary agreement on the Senate floor, adding that his battle consisted of trying to add amendments to the bill through the Senate committee and that he wanted the agreement postponed until conditions had stabilized.

In January 1946, after President Truman delivered a radio address calling for Americans to pressure their representatives in Congress for legislation the president called &quot;vital&quot;, Taft asserted that Truman had chosen to follow the economic views of the CIO-PAC and left the Democratic Party split and his legislative recommendations stalled despite the Democratic majority in Congress.

===Opposition to World War II===
Taft&#x27;s greatest prominence during his first term came not from his fight against the New Deal but rather from his vigorous opposition to US involvement in the Second World War. A staunch non-interventionist, Taft believed that America should avoid any involvement in European or Asian wars and concentrate instead on solving its domestic problems. He believed that a strong military, combined with the natural geographic protection of the Atlantic and Pacific Oceans, would be adequate to protect America even if Germany overran all of Europe. Between the outbreak of war in September 1939, and the Japanese attack on Pearl Harbor in December 1941, Taft opposed nearly all attempts to aid countries fighting Germany. That brought him strong criticism from many liberal Republicans, such as 1940 presidential nominee Wendell Willkie, who felt that America could best protect itself by supporting the British and their allies. Although Taft fully supported the American war effort after Pearl Harbor, he continued to harbor a deep suspicion of American involvement in postwar military alliances, including the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. Taft was the only representative to speak in opposition to Japanese-American internment.

===1944 re-election===
In 1944 Taft was nearly defeated in his bid for a second term in the Senate. His Democratic opponent, former Ohio Lt. Governor William G. Pickrel, received major support from Ohio&#x27;s labor unions and internationalists, and lost by fewer than 18,000 votes out of nearly three million cast, or a margin of less than one percent. Taft lost Cleveland, the state&#x27;s largest city, by 96,000 votes, and he trailed in most of Ohio&#x27;s largest urban areas, but he ran strong in the state&#x27;s rural regions and small towns, carried 71 of Ohio&#x27;s 88 counties, and so avoided defeat. His near-defeat in 1944 &quot;was ever to confound Taft&#x27;s insistence that he was a potent vote getter&quot;, and played a role in his failure to win the Republican presidential nomination in 1948. Following his re-election, Taft became chairman of the Senate Republican Conference in 1944.

===United Nations===
In 1945, Taft was among the seven senators who opposed full United States entry into the United Nations.

===Britain===
In March 1946, after the Truman administration pushed for granting Britain a loan of $3.75 billion, Taft advocated for Britain receiving an &quot;outright gift&quot; in place of the loan and said it &quot;would cause irritation&quot; between the latter country and the United States for the next 50 years during his questioning of Undersecretary of State Dean Acheson as part of the Senate Banking committee. Taft asserted that the State Department had acted with &quot;complete secrecy&quot; in negotiating the loan, as no member of Congress had been consulted, and that the proposal would face opposition in Congress for this reason. Taft proposed that Britain could receive the funds it would have had from the loan by adding the US gift of $1 billion with an advance from the International Bank and the International Fund.

===Education===
In March 1946, Taft joined Senators Lister Hill and Elbert Thomas in introducing a version of the Hill-Thomas Federal Aid to Education bill. In 1948, Taft sponsored an education aid bill providing the poorest states with the most money. Despite Senate approval, the bill was rejected in the House.

===Condemnation of Nuremberg Trials===
Taft condemned the postwar Nuremberg Trials as victor&#x27;s justice under ex post facto laws, in which the people who won the war were the prosecutors, the judges, and the alleged victims, all at the same time. Taft condemned the trials as a violation of the most basic principles of American justice and internationally accepted standards in favor of a politicized version of justice in which court proceedings became an excuse for vengeance against the defeated.

His opposition to the trials was criticized by Republicans and Democrats alike, and it is sometimes given as a reason for his failure to secure the Republican nomination for president. Other observers, such as Senator John F. Kennedy (in &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;), applauded Taft&#x27;s principled stand even in the face of great bipartisan criticism.

===Health care===

Despite opposing President Harry Truman&#x27;s proposal for a comprehensive, national health insurance plan, Taft expressed support for medical aid for poor and low-income people, and in 1947, he proposed a program in which states would receive federal aid from the government in order to provide health care for poor and low-income people. A similar program in Medicaid would eventually be signed into law by President Lyndon B. Johnson in 1965.

In his support of means-tested public health insurance programs, Taft said in 1949: &quot;It has always been assumed in this country that those able to pay for medical care would buy their own medical service, just as under any system, except a socialistic system, they buy their own food, their own housing, their own clothing, and their own automobiles... Undoubtedly, in that system there are gaps... and we have a very definite interest in trying to fill the gaps.&quot;

===1947 Taft–Hartley Labor Act===
When the Republicans took control of Congress in 1947, he focused on labor-management relations as Chair of the Senate Labor Committee. Decrying the effect of the Wagner Act in tilting the balance toward labor unions, he wrote the 1947 Taft–Hartley Act, which remains the basic labor law. It bans &quot;unfair&quot; union practices, outlaws closed shops, and authorizes the President to seek federal court injunctions to impose an 80-day cooling-off period if a strike threatened the national interest. Taft displayed all of his parliamentary skills in getting the bill through Congress. When President Harry Truman vetoed it, Taft then convinced both houses of Congress to override the veto.

By early 1949, Elbert Thomas sponsored legislation sent to Congress by the Truman administration that would repeal the Taft–Hartley Act. Taft predicted that a majority of the Taft–Hartley Act would remain in law and began a week-long period of &quot;one hard-pounding argument after another&quot; defending the legislation. Later that month, Senators Wayne Morse and Irving Ives indicated interest in offering a new labor bill that would remove the section of the Taft–Hartley Act allowing the government to have 80-day injunctions to halt critical strikes, the two publicly stating their hope that Taft would back the legislation. In May, amid the Truman administration&#x27;s attempts to repeal the Taft–Hartley Act through its own legislation, Taft joined fellow Republicans Howard Alexander Smith and Forrest C. Donnell in introducing legislation that Taft promoted as retaining &quot;the best features of the Taft–Hartley law&quot;. In June, ahead of the Senate opening debate on labor legislation, Taft stated there would be a battle fought between his amended Taft–Hartley Act and President Truman&#x27;s proposal for a repeal and confirmed to reporters he was &quot;not contemplating any new concessions&quot;. When the Senate resumed debate on June 8, Taft responded to Elbert D. Thomas in a speech charging Democratic members of the Senate Labor Committee with playing partisan politics in their handling of the Truman administration&#x27;s bill to repeal the Taft–Hartley Act.

===Second term===
From 1947 to 1949, when the Republicans controlled the Senate for the first time since 1931, Taft was his party&#x27;s leading voice in domestic policy. He was reluctant to support farm subsidies, a position that hurt the GOP in rural areas (especially in the Midwest) in the 1948 elections. Taft engineered the passage of the Housing Act of 1949, which funded slum clearance and the construction of 810,000 units of low-income housing over a period of six years. It was one of the few Fair Deal proposals of Truman that he liked. In March 1947, Taft charged Senate Democrats with deliberately stalling legislation and threatened to continually request sessions for the purpose of forwarding the Republican legislative program. In January 1948, Taft delivered a speech responding to President Truman&#x27;s State of the Union address in which he charged the legislative proposals of the Truman administration with leading the United States to bankruptcy and totalitarianism while pledging the Republican-controlled Congress would not allow them to pass, saying they followed the principle of the New Deal in &quot;promising the people something for nothing.&quot; Taft added that the Republicans intended to introduce their own program to reduce expenses and cut both taxes and the tax burden. In turn, Truman Democrats labelled the GOP-controlled 80th congress the &quot;Do Nothing Congress&quot;, and accused Taft and Republicans legislators of engaging in obstructionism for purely political purposes.

In February 1949, after losing control of the senate to Democrats in the 1948 election, Taft announced the Republican Party policy committee had agreed to support a motion by California Senator William Knowland aimed at changing the rules of curbing filibusters. In March 1949, the Senate Labor Committee approved the Truman administration&#x27;s labor bill without changing a comma and while overriding Republican protests; Taft responded that the act was &quot;the most heavy-handed procedure&quot; he had seen since being in the Senate. That year, Taft supported a health program calling for federal outlays of $1.25 billion during the period of the next five years and stated no major health legislation would be passed during the current congressional session. In July 1950, as Senate tax writers gathered in Washington for the first time to discuss the tax reduction voted on by the House, Taft publicly admitted his lack of enthusiasm with a provision calling for the payment of corporate taxes to be sped up within the next five years. Taft stated that Republicans would support a general tax increase during the fall. The same month, during an effort by Republicans to suppress the report by Senate Democrats attacking the charges of Senator Joseph McCarthy, Taft joined Kenneth S. Wherry in predicting an effort to send the majority report back to the committee with an order calling for a bipartisan investigation of the loyalty program of the federal government.

In foreign policy, he was non-interventionist and did not see Stalin&#x27;s Soviet Union as a major threat. However, he called David Lilienthal &quot;soft on the subject of Communism&quot;. The true danger, he believed, was big government and runaway spending. He supported the Truman Doctrine and reluctantly approved the Marshall Plan but opposed NATO, as unnecessary and provocative to the Soviets. Consequently, in July 1949, Taft was one of thirteen senators to vote against the ratification of the NATO pact. However, Taft objected not to the treaty&#x27;s objectives, but to its form and especially to its rearmament aspects. Taft was strongly for the principle of guaranteeing the integrity of Western Europe. He took the lead among Republicans in condemning Truman&#x27;s handling of the Korean War and questioning the constitutionality of the war itself: &quot;My conclusion, therefore, is that in the case of Korea, where a war was already under way, we had no right to send troops to a nation, with whom we had no treaty, to defend it against attack by another nation, no matter how unprincipled that aggression might be, unless the whole matter was submitted to Congress and a declaration of war or some other direct authority obtained.&quot; In April 1949, during a debate on renewal of the Marshall Plan bill, Taft stated the US could see either a tax increase or budget deficit in the event that foreign aid and other government spending were not reduced. Later that month, a compromise European Recovery Program passed both the House and Senate, within minutes of each other. Taft stated he was hopeful the Appropriations Committees would reduce the cash total by ten percent and led an unsuccessful attempt to trim the bill by the aforementioned amount. In June 1949, Taft indicated his support for reducing funding for the European Recovery Program, saying the Economic Corporation Administration could stand a 10 percent cut in the funding approved by the House. In August 1950, Taft stated the United States had invited the attack in Korea, adding that the real problem was whether the United States was going to &quot;outfit the armed forces&quot; or build up American forces in anticipation of a war against Russia in the following two years, and an all-out rearming of the US would lead to World War III.

====Support of Israel====
Taft was a leading supporter of the new state of Israel, called for an end to the arms embargo to the Middle East, and supported arms shipments and other military aid to the new country. According to historian Brian Kennedy:
:Taft&#x27;s actions towards Palestine seemed to violate many of his foremost principles. Despite being one of the foremost isolationists in the nation, Taft proposed the United States serve as the primary arbiter in the Middle East. Although publicly stating that the United States had no right to dictate policy towards Great Britain in regards to India, he consistently sought to influence British policy in Palestine. Meanwhile, even as he criticized the efforts to grant foreign aid to allied nations in Europe, Taft proposed $150 million in aid be given to Israel. Moreover, at a time when he was running against Truman for the presidency, and while he engaged in extremely contentious and partisan political struggles with the President, Taft surprisingly seemed to agree with the President on the issue of Israel.

===1950 re-election===

In 1950, Taft ran a more effective campaign for re-election to the Senate. Wooing factory workers, he visited 334 industrial plants and gave 873 speeches. He won a third term by 431,184 votes, the second largest victory margin in Ohio Senate election history until then. He benefited from a weak Democratic opponent – one observer reportedly said of &quot;Jumping Joe&quot; Ferguson, the State Auditor, &quot;If the Democrats want to win, they should send Ferguson on a mission abroad&quot; – but more importantly, Ohio&#x27;s unions failed to effectively use the Taft–Hartley Act, which they denounced as a &quot;slave labor law&quot;, against him. Additionally, Democratic Governor Frank Lausche did not endorse Ferguson and, according to journalist Samuel Lubell, almost openly supported Taft. In a post-election survey of voters, Lubell found that the overly aggressive, labor-backed anti-Taft campaign angered some Democrats. Even many union members reportedly voted Republican to express their opposition to local union leaders, to support Taft–Hartley&#x27;s ban on the closed shop, or to prevent, as one told Lubell, &quot;the Socialists from taking over the Democratic party.&quot;

By the start of his third Senate term, Taft had been given the nickname &quot;Mr. Republican.&quot; He was the chief congressional ideologue and spokesman for the conservatism of the Republican Party and the acknowledged national leader of its conservative faction.

In a January 6, 1951 speech on the Senate floor, Taft criticized the Truman administration for plans to defend Western Europe with the U.S. Army. Taft said the NATO treaty did not commit the U.S. to send an American Army to Europe and wanted no American troops there at this time, being in favor instead of reliance on long-distance air and sea superiority to deter the Russians. Taft supported Congress reducing the number of American soldiers that could be dispatched to assist with the defenses of Western Europe, and accused the Truman administration of concealing the number of American troops and soldiers from other nations that would be furnished in the International Defense Army from Congress as well as the American people and advocated for the United States to supply a single division for every nine put up by European nations. In January 1953, Taft stated that the Truman administration&#x27;s handling of foreign policy had left the incoming Eisenhower &quot;with the most dangerous foreign problem this country has ever faced.&quot;

In August 1951, after President Truman delivered an address criticizing those &quot;trying to create fear and suspicion among us by the use of slander, unproved accusations, and just plain lies&quot;, Taft told a reporter that he considered Truman hysterical and called for him to refer to a specific remark that was both false and alleged of him. That month, Taft announced his support for an Air Force increase but opposition to similar boosts for either the Army or Navy, telling a reporter of his concerns that military leaders would ask Congress for appropriations later in the year and that additional increases for other branches would retain deficits he did not believe the US could stand. In December, Taft delivered an address to the American Medical Association, asserting the federal government as attempting to take over all welfare programs through a scheme and stated that doctors were justified in their opposition as Socialists made moves to enact a federal system of socialized medicine. On January 31, 1953, Taft indicated the Eisenhower administration would allow the death of price controls on April 30 and voiced his opposition to the &quot;legal recognition to the principle of controls&quot;.

==Presidential ambitions==

===Distrust by Old Right===

While outsiders thought Taft was the epitome of conservative Republicanism, inside the party, he was repeatedly criticized by hardliners alarmed by his sponsorship of New Deal-like programs, especially federal housing for the poor. The real estate lobby was especially fearful about public housing. Senator Kenneth S. Wherry discerned a &quot;touch of socialism&quot; in Taft, and his Ohio colleague, Senator John Bricker, speculated that perhaps the &quot;socialists have gotten to Bob Taft.&quot; The distrust on the right hurt Taft&#x27;s 1948 presidential ambitions.

===1940 and 1944===

Taft first sought the Republican presidential nomination in 1940 but lost to Wendell Willkie. Taft was regarded as a strong contender, but his outspoken support of a non-interventionist foreign policy, and his opposition to the New Deal in domestic policy led many liberal Republicans to reject his candidacy. At the 1940 Republican Convention, Willkie, once a Democrat, and a corporate executive who had never run for political office, came from behind to beat Taft and several other candidates for the nomination. That year, Taft first clashed with Thomas E. Dewey, then a New York District Attorney, who had become nationally famous for successfully prosecuting several prominent organized-crime figures, especially New York mob boss &quot;Lucky&quot; Luciano. Taft felt that Dewey was not conservative or consistent enough in his principles for the Republican Party: &quot;Tom Dewey has no real courage to stand up against the crowd that wants to smear any Republican who takes a forthright position against the New Deal ... there is only one way to beat the New Deal, and that is head on. You can&#x27;t outdeal them.&quot; In other letters, Taft described Dewey as &quot;very arrogant and bossy&quot; and worried that &quot;advisers will talk Dewey into too much internationalism ... he comes from New York and sees the group opinions there as a lot more important than they are.&quot;

In the 1944 presidential campaign Taft was not a candidate. He supported Governor John W. Bricker of Ohio, a fellow conservative, for the nomination. However, Bricker was defeated by Dewey, who had become the Governor of New York in 1943. Dewey named Bricker as his running mate; the ticket would go on to lose to Roosevelt in the general election.

===1948 and 1952===
In 1948, Taft made a second try for the nomination but again was defeated by his archrival, Dewey, who led the GOP&#x27;s moderate/liberal wing. In the 1948 United States presidential election, Dewey was defeated by the Democratic presidential candidate, Harry S. Truman.

In August 1951, during a news conference, President Truman said Taft was his choice for the Republican nomination in the following year&#x27;s presidential election, Taft responding by saying that he would let others comment on the remark. In January 1952, Taft stated those seeking the drafting of General Dwight Eisenhower had made the argument he could not win the general election and that he did not understand this perspective as the same argument was being made of Eisenhower&#x27;s candidacy by his manager David S. Ingalls. On March 20, Taft announced his withdrawal from the New Jersey Republican primary, citing the endorsement of Eisenhower by Governor of New Jersey Alfred Driscoll and insisting the endorsement was part of a move by Driscoll to corrupt the primary&#x27;s intent.

Taft sought to reach out to southern Democratic voters in his 1952 campaign. It was his third and final try for the nomination; it also proved to be his strongest effort. At the Republican State Convention in Little Rock, he declared:

I believe a Republican could carry a number of southern states if he conducts the right kind of campaign. ... Whether we win or lose in the South, we cannot afford to ignore public opinion in the southern states, because it influences national public opinion, and that opinion finally decides the election. ... It is said that southern Democrats will not vote for a Republican candidate. They have frequently done so. They did so in Little Rock last November [1951] when they elected Pratt Remmel mayor. I refuse to admit that if the issues are clearly presented, the southern voters will not vote on the basis of principle. ...

Taft had the solid backing of the party&#x27;s conservative wing. Former US Representative Howard Buffett of Nebraska (father of billionaire Warren Buffett) served as one of his campaign managers. With Dewey no longer an active candidate, many political pundits regarded Taft as the frontrunner. However, the race changed when Dewey and other moderates were able to convince Dwight D. Eisenhower, the most popular general of World War II, to run for the nomination. Eisenhower ran because of his fear that Taft&#x27;s non-interventionist views in foreign policy, especially his opposition to NATO, might benefit the Soviet Union in the Cold War.

The fight between Taft and Eisenhower for the nomination was one of the closest and most bitter in American political history. When the Republican Convention opened in Chicago in July 1952, Taft and Eisenhower were neck-and-neck in delegate votes. On the convention&#x27;s first day, Eisenhower&#x27;s managers complained that Taft&#x27;s forces had unfairly denied Eisenhower supporters delegate slots in several Southern states, including Texas, where the state chairman, Orville Bullington, was committed to Taft. The Eisenhower partisans proposed to remove pro-Taft delegates in these states and replace them with pro-Eisenhower delegates; they called their proposal &quot;Fair Play.&quot; Although Taft angrily denied having stolen any delegate votes, the convention voted to support Fair Play 658 to 548, and the Texans voted 33–5 for Eisenhower as a result. In addition, several uncommitted state delegations, such as Michigan and Pennsylvania, agreed to support Eisenhower.

The addition of the uncommitted state delegations, combined with Taft&#x27;s loss of many Southern delegates by the Fair Play proposal, decided the nomination in Eisenhower&#x27;s favor. Despite his bitterness at his narrow defeat and his belief that he had been unfairly ambushed by the Eisenhower forces (including Dewey), Taft issued a brief statement after the convention conveying his congratulations and support to Eisenhower. Thereafter, however, he brooded in silence at his summer home in Quebec, complaining, &quot;Every Republican candidate for President since 1936 has been nominated by the Chase National Bank.&quot; As the weeks passed, Eisenhower&#x27;s aides worried that Taft and his supporters would sit on their hands during the campaign and that as a result Eisenhower might lose the election. In September 1952, Taft finally agreed to meet with Eisenhower, at Morningside Heights in New York City. There, to gain Taft&#x27;s support, Eisenhower promised that he would take no reprisals against Taft partisans, would cut federal spending, and would fight &quot;creeping socialism in every domestic field.&quot; In fact, Eisenhower and Taft agreed on most domestic issues; their disagreements were primarily in foreign policy.

Eisenhower firmly believed in NATO and was committed to the US support of anticommunism in the Cold War.

==Senate Majority Leader==
Following Eisenhower&#x27;s election and the Republican takeover of Congress, Taft served as Senate Majority Leader in 1953, and he strongly supported Eisenhower&#x27;s domestic proposals. He worked hard to assist the inexperienced new officials of the administration. He even tried, with little success, to curb the excesses of red-baiting US Senator Joseph McCarthy. By April, Eisenhower and Taft were friends and golfing companions, and Taft was praising his former adversary. Defeat in 1952, it seemed, had softened Taft. No longer burdened by presidential ambitions, he had become less partisan, less abrasive, and more conciliatory; he was now widely regarded as the most powerful man in Congress.

On May 26, 1953, Taft delivered his final speech, in which he presciently warned of the dangers of America&#x27;s emerging Cold War foreign policy, specifically against US military involvement in Southeast Asia, which would later become the Vietnam War:

==Death and legacy==

In April 1953, Taft checked into Walter Reed Army Medical Center. He had been suffering from pain in his hips for some time and had recently played a round of golf with President Eisenhower, which he was barely able to finish. Doctors there put the Senator through a battery of tests, but they were not conclusive; it was suspected that Taft may have been suffering from arthritis or perhaps had a tumor somewhere in his lower extremities.

On May 26, Taft returned to Cincinnati where he underwent another round of medical testing at Holmes Hospital. Biopsies were done on several nodules on his head and abdomen, which came back as malignant. On June 7, he entered New York Hospital for more tests and treatment; to keep the news that he might have cancer a secret he registered under the assumed name &quot;Howard Roberts, Jr.&quot;. While it was agreed that Taft in fact had cancer, the physicians treating him were not in agreement on how to treat him, especially considering that none of them were aware where the primary tumor was (a postmortem examination discovered the tumor originated in the senator&#x27;s pancreas). Some thought that surgery to remove the tumors would be the best option for Taft, while others felt the cancer had spread too far and thus palliative care, specifically X-ray therapy, was preferable. On June 10, 1953, Taft held a press conference in which he announced his illness and transferred his duties as Senate Majority Leader to Senator William F. Knowland of California. He did not resign his Senate seat and told reporters that he expected to recover and return to work.

However, Taft&#x27;s condition continued to deteriorate and with the Senate in recess, he returned to New York Hospital for surgery on July 4. The surgery &quot;did not take long, for the doctors discovered cancer everywhere ... there was no longer any doubt&quot; that his condition was terminal. On July 31, Taft&#x27;s wife paid him a visit in his hospital room. Several hours after she left, Taft suffered a brain hemorrhage and was pronounced dead shortly thereafter. His body lay in state at the United States Capitol rotunda, where thousands of mourners offered their respects at his coffin. On August 3, 1953, a memorial service was held in the rotunda; in addition to his family the service was attended by Eisenhower, Vice President Nixon, the cabinet, members of the Supreme Court, and Taft&#x27;s congressional colleagues. Following the service his body was flown to Cincinnati, where he was buried in a private ceremony at Indian Hill Episcopal Church Cemetery.

In 1957, a committee led by Senator John F. Kennedy selected Taft as one of five great senators whose portraits would adorn the President&#x27;s Room off the Senate floor. Kennedy would feature him in &quot;Profiles in Courage&quot;, and Taft continues to be regarded by historians as one of the most powerful senators of the 20th century.

===Memorial===

The Robert A. Taft Memorial, featuring a statue by the sculptor Wheeler Williams and a bell tower, is located north of the Capitol on Constitution Avenue. The inscription on the tower face behind him reads:

This Memorial to Robert A. Taft, presented by the people to the Congress of the United States, stands as a tribute to the honesty, indomitable courage, and high principles of free government symbolized by his life.

<text>In mathematics and computing, the method of complements is a technique to encode a symmetric range of positive and negative integers in a way that they can use the same algorithm (or mechanism) for addition throughout the whole range. For a given number of places half of the possible representations of numbers encode the positive numbers, the other half represents their respective additive inverses. The pairs of mutually additive inverse numbers are called &quot;complements&quot;. Thus subtraction of any number is implemented by adding its complement. Changing the sign of any number is encoded by generating its complement, which can be done by a very simple and efficient algorithm. This method was commonly used in mechanical calculators and is still used in modern computers. The generalized concept of the &quot;radix complement&quot; (as described below) is also valuable in number theory, such as in Midy&#x27;s theorem.

The &quot;nines&#x27; complement&quot; of a number given in decimal representation is formed by replacing each digit with nine minus that digit. To subtract a decimal number &quot;y&quot; (the subtrahend) from another number &quot;x&quot; (the minuend) two methods may be used:

In the first method, the nines&#x27; complement of &quot;x&quot; is added to &quot;y&quot;. Then the nines&#x27; complement of the result obtained is formed to produce the desired result.
In the second method, the nines&#x27; complement of &quot;y&quot; is added to &quot;x&quot; and one is added to the sum. The leftmost digit &#x27;1&#x27; of the result is then discarded. Discarding the leftmost &#x27;1&#x27; is especially convenient on calculators or computers that use a fixed number of digits: there is nowhere for it to go so it is simply lost during the calculation. The nines&#x27; complement plus one is known as the &quot;tens&#x27; complement.&quot;

The method of complements can be extended to other number bases (radices); in particular, it is used on most digital computers to perform subtraction, represent negative numbers in base 2 or binary arithmetic and test overflow in calculation.

==Numeric complements==
The radix complement of an formula_1-digit number formula_2 in radix formula_3 is defined as formula_4. In practice, the radix complement is more easily obtained by adding 1 to the diminished radix complement, which is formula_5. While this seems equally difficult to calculate as the radix complement, it is actually simpler since formula_6 is simply the digit formula_7 repeated formula_1 times. This is because formula_9 (see also Geometric series Formula). Knowing this, the diminished radix complement of a number can be found by complementing each digit with respect to formula_7, i.e. subtracting each digit in formula_2 from formula_7.

The subtraction of formula_2 from formula_14 using diminished radix complements may be performed as follows. Add the diminished radix complement of formula_14 to formula_2 to obtain formula_17 or equivalently formula_18, which is the diminished radix complement of formula_19. Further taking the diminished radix complement of formula_18 results in the desired answer of formula_21.

Alternatively using the radix complement, formula_19 may be obtained by adding the radix complement of formula_2 to formula_14 to obtain formula_25 or formula_26. Assuming formula_27 , the result will be greater or equal to formula_28 and dropping the leading formula_29 from the result is the same as subtracting formula_28, making the result formula_31 or just formula_21, the desired result.

In the decimal numbering system, the radix complement is called the &quot;ten&#x27;s complement&quot; and the diminished radix complement the &quot;nines&#x27; complement&quot;. In binary, the radix complement is called the &quot;two&#x27;s complement&quot; and the diminished radix complement the &quot;ones&#x27; complement&quot;. The naming of complements in other bases is similar. Some people, notably Donald Knuth, recommend using the placement of the apostrophe to distinguish between the radix complement and the diminished radix complement. In this usage, the &quot;four&#x27;s complement&quot; refers to the radix complement of a number in base four while &quot;fours&#x27; complement&quot; is the diminished radix complement of a number in base 5. However, the distinction is not important when the radix is apparent (nearly always), and the subtle difference in apostrophe placement is not common practice. Most writers use &quot;one&#x27;s&quot; and &quot;nine&#x27;s complement&quot;, and many style manuals leave out the apostrophe, recommending &quot;ones&quot; and &quot;nines complement&quot;.

==Decimal example==

The nines&#x27; complement of a decimal digit is the number that must be added to it to produce 9; the nines&#x27; complement of 3 is 6, the nines&#x27; complement of 7 is 2, and so on, see table. To form the nines&#x27; complement of a larger number, each digit is replaced by its nines&#x27; complement.

Consider the following subtraction problem:

 873 [x, the minuend]
 - 218 [y, the subtrahend]

=== First method ===
Compute the nines&#x27; complement of the minuend, 873. Add that to the subtrahend 218, then calculate the nines&#x27; complement of the result.

 126 [nines&#x27; complement of x = 999 - x]
 + 218 [y, the subtrahend]
 344 [999 - x + y]

Now calculate the nines&#x27; complement of the result

 344 [result]
 655 [nines&#x27; complement of 344 = 999 - (999 - x + y) = x - y, the correct answer]

=== Second method ===
Compute the nines&#x27; complement of 218, which is 781. Because 218 is three digits long, this is the same as subtracting 218 from 999.

Next, the sum of formula_14 and the nines&#x27; complement of formula_2 is taken:

 873 [x]
 + 781 [nines&#x27; complement of y = 999 - y]
 1654 [999 + x - y]

The leading &quot;1&quot; digit is then dropped, giving 654.

 1654
 -1000 [-(999 + 1)]
 654 [-(999 + 1) + 999 + x - y]

This is not yet correct. In the first step, 999 was added to the equation. Then 1000 was subtracted when the leading 1 was dropped. So, the answer obtained (654) is one less than the correct answer formula_19. To fix this, 1 is added to the answer:

 654
 + 1
 655 [x - y]

Adding a 1 gives 655, the correct answer to our original subtraction problem. The last step of adding 1 could be skipped if instead the ten&#x27;s complement of y was used in the first step.

=== Magnitude of numbers ===

In the following example the result of the subtraction has fewer digits than formula_14:

 123410 [x, the minuend]
 - 123401 [y, the subtrahend]

Using the first method the sum of the nines&#x27; complement of formula_14 and formula_2 is

 876589 [nines&#x27; complement of x]
 + 123401 [y]
 999990
The nines&#x27; complement of 999990 is 000009. Removing the leading zeros gives 9, the desired result.

If the subtrahend, formula_2, has fewer digits than the minuend, formula_14, leading zeros must be added in the second method. These zeros become leading nines when the complement is taken. For example:

 48032 [x]
 - 391 [y]

can be rewritten

 48032 [x]
 - 00391 [y with leading zeros]

Replacing 00391 with its nines&#x27; complement and adding 1 produces the sum:

 48032 [x]
 + 99608 [nines&#x27; complement of y]
 + 1
 147641

Dropping the leading 1 gives the correct answer: 47641.

==Binary method==
The method of complements is especially useful in binary (radix 2) since the ones&#x27; complement is very easily obtained by inverting each bit (changing &#x27;0&#x27; to &#x27;1&#x27; and vice versa). Adding 1 to get the two&#x27;s complement can be done by simulating a carry into the least significant bit. For example:

 0110 0100 [x, equals decimal 100]
 - 0001 0110 [y, equals decimal 22]

becomes the sum:

 0110 0100 [x]
 + 1110 1001 [ones&#x27; complement of y = 1111 1111 - y]
 + 1 [to get the two&#x27;s complement = 1 0000 0000 - y]
 10100 1110 [x + 1 0000 0000 - y]

Dropping the initial &quot;1&quot; gives the answer: 0100 1110 (equals decimal 78)

==Negative number representations==
The method of complements normally assumes that the operands are positive and that &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;, logical constraints given that adding and subtracting arbitrary integers is normally done by comparing signs, adding the two or subtracting the smaller from the larger, and giving the result the correct sign.

Let&#x27;s see what happens if &quot;x&quot; &lt; &quot;y&quot;. In that case, there will not be a &quot;1&quot; digit to cross out after the addition since formula_41 will be less than formula_28. For example, (in decimal):

 185 [x]
 - 329 [y]

Complementing &quot;y&quot; and adding gives:

 185 [x]
 + 670 [nines&#x27; complement of y]
 + 1
 856

At this point, there is no &quot;simple&quot; way to complete the calculation by subtracting formula_28 (1000 in this case); one cannot simply ignore a leading 1. The expected answer is −144, which isn&#x27;t as far off as it seems; 856 happens to be the ten&#x27;s complement of 144. This issue can be addressed in a number of ways:
* Ignore the issue. This is reasonable if a person is operating a calculating device that doesn&#x27;t support negative numbers since comparing the two operands before the calculation so they can be entered in the proper order, and verifying that the result is reasonable, is easy for humans to do.
* Use the same method to subtract 856 from 1000, and then add a negative sign to the result.
* Represent negative numbers as radix complements of their positive counterparts. Numbers less than formula_44 are considered positive; the rest are considered negative (and their magnitude can be obtained by taking the radix complement). This works best for even radices since the sign can be determined by looking at the first digit. For example, numbers in ten&#x27;s complement notation are positive if the first digit is 0, 1, 2, 3, or 4, and negative if 5, 6, 7, 8, or 9. And it works very well in binary since the first bit can be considered a sign bit: the number is positive if the sign bit is 0 and negative if it is 1. Indeed, two&#x27;s complement is used in most modern computers to represent signed numbers.
* Complement the result if there is no carry out of the most significant digit (an indication that &quot;x&quot; was less than &quot;y&quot;). This is easier to implement with digital circuits than comparing and swapping the operands. But since taking the radix complement requires adding 1, it is difficult to do directly. Fortunately, a trick can be used to get around this addition: Instead of always setting a carry into the least significant digit when subtracting, the carry out of the most significant digit is used as the carry input into the least significant digit (an operation called an &quot;end-around carry&quot;). So if &quot;y&quot; ≤ &quot;x&quot;, the carry from the most significant digit that would normally be ignored is added, producing the correct result. And if not, the 1 is not added and the result is one less than the radix complement of the answer, or the diminished radix complement, which does not require an addition to obtain. This method is used by computers that use sign-and-magnitude to represent signed numbers.

==Practical uses==

The method of complements was used in many mechanical calculators as an alternative to running the gears backwards. For example:

* Pascal&#x27;s calculator had two sets of result digits, a black set displaying the normal result and a red set displaying the nines&#x27; complement of this. A horizontal slat was used to cover up one of these sets, exposing the other. To subtract, the red digits were exposed and set to 0. Then the nines&#x27; complement of the minuend was entered. On some machine this could be done by dialing in the minuend using inner wheels of complements (i.e. without having to mentally determine the nines&#x27; complement of the minuend). In displaying that data in the complement window (red set), the operator could see the nines&#x27; complement of the nines&#x27; complement of the minuend, that is the minuend. The slat was then moved to expose the black digits (which now displayed the nines&#x27; complement of the minuend) and the subtrahend was added by dialing it in. Finally, the operator had to move the slat again to read the correct answer.
* The Comptometer had nines&#x27; complement digits printed in smaller type along with the normal digits on each key. To subtract, the operator was expected to mentally subtract 1 from the subtrahend and enter the result using the smaller digits. Since subtracting 1 before complementing is equivalent to adding 1 afterwards, the operator would thus effectively add the ten&#x27;s complement of the subtrahend. The operator also needed to hold down the &quot;subtraction cutoff tab&quot; corresponding to the leftmost digit of the answer. This tab prevented the carry from being propagated past it, the Comptometer&#x27;s method of dropping the initial 1 from the result.
* The Curta calculator used the method of complements for subtraction, and managed to hide this from the user. Numbers were entered using digit input slides along the side of the device. The number on each slide was added to a result counter by a gearing mechanism which engaged cams on a rotating &quot;echelon drum&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;step drum&quot;). The drum was turned by use of a crank on the top of the instrument. The number of cams encountered by each digit as the crank turned was determined by the value of that digit. For example, if a slide is set to its &quot;6&quot; position, a row of 6 cams would be encountered around the drum corresponding to that position. For subtraction, the drum was shifted slightly before it was turned, which moved a different row of cams into position. This alternate row contained the nines&#x27; complement of the digits. Thus, the row of 6 cams that had been in position for addition now had a row with 3 cams. The shifted drum also engaged one extra cam which added 1 to the result (as required for the method of complements). The always present ten&#x27;s complement &quot;overflow 1&quot; which carried out beyond the most significant digit of the results register was, in effect, discarded.

===In computers===
Use of the method of complements is ubiquitous in digital computers, regardless of the representation used for signed numbers. However, the circuitry required depends on the representation:

* If two&#x27;s complement representation is used, subtraction requires only inverting the bits of the subtrahend and setting a carry into the rightmost bit.
* Using ones&#x27; complement representation requires inverting the bits of the subtrahend and connecting the carry out of the most significant bit to the carry in of the least significant bit (end-around carry).
* Using sign-magnitude representation requires only complementing the sign bit of the subtrahend and adding, but the addition/subtraction logic needs to compare the sign bits, complement one of the inputs if they are different, implement an end-around carry, and complement the result if there was no carry from the most significant bit.

===Manual uses===
The method of complements was used to correct errors when accounting books were written by hand. To remove an entry from a column of numbers, the accountant could add a new entry with the ten&#x27;s complement of the number to subtract. A bar was added over the digits of this entry to denote its special status. It was then possible to add the whole column of figures to obtain the corrected result.

Complementing the sum is handy for cashiers making change for a purchase from currency in a single denomination of 1 raised to an integer power of the currency&#x27;s base. For decimal currencies that would be 10, 100, 1,000, etc., e.g. a $10.00 bill.

==In grade school education==

In grade schools, students are sometimes taught the method of complements as a shortcut useful in mental arithmetic. Subtraction is done by adding the ten&#x27;s complement of the subtrahend, which is the nines&#x27; complement plus 1. The result of this addition is used when it is clear that the difference will be positive, otherwise the ten&#x27;s complement of the addition&#x27;s result is used with it marked as negative. The same technique works for subtracting on an adding machine.

<text>A binary asteroid is a system of two asteroids orbiting their common barycenter. The binary nature of 243 Ida was discovered when the Galileo spacecraft flew by the asteroid in 1993. Since then numerous binary asteroids and several triple asteroids have been detected.

The mass ratio of the two components – called the &quot;primary&quot; and &quot;secondary&quot; of a binary system – is an important characteristic. Most binary asteroids have a large mass ratio, i.e. a relatively small satellite in orbit around the main component. Systems with one or more small moons – also called &quot;companions&quot; or simply &quot;satellites&quot; – include 87 Sylvia, 107 Camilla and 45 Eugenia (all triples), 121 Hermione, 130 Elektra (a quadruple), 22 Kalliope, 283 Emma, 379 Huenna, 243 Ida and 4337 Arecibo (in order of decreasing primary size). Some binary systems have a mass ratio near unity, i.e., two components of similar mass. They include 90 Antiope, , and 69230 Hermes, with average component diameters of 86, 1.8, 0.9 and 0.8 km, respectively.

In August 2024 Gaia reported 352 new binary asteroid candidates.

== Description ==

Several theories have been posited to explain the formation of binary-asteroid systems. Many systems have significant macro-porosity (a &quot;rubble-pile&quot; interior). The satellites orbiting large main-belt asteroids such as 22 Kalliope, 45 Eugenia or 87 Sylvia may have formed by disruption of a parent body after impact or fission after an oblique impact. Trans-Neptunian binaries may have formed during the formation of the Solar System by mutual capture or three-body interaction. Near-Earth asteroids, which orbit in the inner part of the Solar System, most likely form by spin-up and mass shedding, likely as a result of the YORP effect. Numerical simulations suggest that when solar energy spins a “rubble pile” asteroid to a sufficiently fast rate by the YORP effect, material is thrown from the asteroid&#x27;s equator. This process also exposes fresh material at the poles of the asteroid.

<text>Stanley Mikita (born Stanislav Guoth; May 20, 1940 – August 7, 2018) was a Slovak-born Canadian ice hockey player for the Chicago Black Hawks of the National Hockey League, generally regarded as the best centre of the 1960s. In 2017, he was named one of the 100 Greatest NHL Players.
In 1961, he became the first Slovak-born player to win the Stanley Cup.

==Early life==
Mikita was born as Stanislav Guoth in Sokolče, Slovak Republic, during the brief period it was in existence as a client state of Nazi Germany. He was raised in a small farming community until 1948, when he moved to St. Catharines, Ontario. He was adopted by his aunt and uncle, Anna and Joe Mikita, who had emigrated from Slovakia to Canada 20 years earlier and were childless. They came to Czechoslovakia to visit the Guoth family before Christmas in 1948 and took the 8-year-old Stan with them when they went back to Canada. His parents believed that there was a brighter future for him in Canada than in then Communist Czechoslovakia, whose borders (including the area of Slovakia) had been reinstated at the end of World War II. His aunt and uncle also gave him their surname, and he anglicized his first name to Stanley. He attended high school at St. Catharines Collegiate.

==Playing career==
After three starring junior seasons with the St. Catharines Teepees of the Ontario Hockey Association, Mikita was promoted to the parent Chicago Black Hawks in . In his second full year, in 1961, the Black Hawks won their third Stanley Cup. The young centre led the entire league in goals during the playoffs, scoring a total of six.

The following season was his breakout year. Mikita became a star as centre of the famed &quot;Scooter Line&quot;, with right wing Ken Wharram and left wingers Ab McDonald and Doug Mohns. Combining skilled defense and a reputation as one of the game&#x27;s best faceoff men using his innovative curved stick, Mikita led the league in scoring four times in the decade, tying Bobby Hull&#x27;s year-old single-season scoring mark in with 97 points (a mark broken two years later by former teammate Phil Esposito and currently held by Wayne Gretzky). The season, an 87-point effort from Mikita, was the last year a Chicago player won the scoring title until Patrick Kane&#x27;s 106-point season.

In his early years, Mikita was among the most penalized players in the league, but he then decided to play a cleaner game and went on to win the Lady Byng Memorial Trophy for particularly sportsmanlike conduct combined with excellence twice. Mikita&#x27;s drastic change in behavior came after he returned home from a road trip. His wife told him that while their daughter, Meg, was watching the Black Hawks&#x27; last road game on television, she turned and said, &quot;Mommy, why does Daddy spend so much time sitting down?&quot; The camera had just shown Mikita in the penalty box again.

During his playing career, in 1973, Mikita teamed up with Chicago businessman Irv Tiahnybik to form the American Hearing Impaired Hockey Association (AHIHA), to bring together deaf and hard-of-hearing hockey players from all over the country, and he founded the Stan Mikita School for the Hearing Impaired, inspired by a friend&#x27;s deaf son who was an aspiring goalie. He also helped bring the Special Olympics to Chicago, bringing his family out to volunteer at races.

Internationally, Mikita played two games of the Summit Series in 1972 for Canada against Soviet Union, both of them in Canada, as well as two exhibition games also during the Summit Series, one against Sweden in Stockholm and one against Czechoslovakia in Prague. He also played several exhibition games for Czechoslovakia in summer 1967 when he came to his country of origin to visit his family.

===Curved stick use===
Mikita and teammate Bobby Hull were a well-known forward duo in the 1960s, gaining notoriety for using sticks with curved blades. Such sticks gave a comparative advantage to shooters versus goaltenders. As a result, the NHL limited blade curvature to ½&quot; in 1970. Mikita reportedly began the practice after his standard stick got caught in a bench door, bending the blade before he hit the ice; he soon was borrowing a propane torch from team trainers to create a deliberate curve.

Mikita was also one of the first players to wear a helmet full-time, after a December 1967 game in which an errant shot tore a piece off one of his ears (it was stitched back on).

==Retirement==

Mikita&#x27;s later years were marred by chronic back injuries, leading to his retirement as an active player on April 14, 1980. At that time, only Gordie Howe and Phil Esposito had scored more points in the NHL, and just six players had appeared in more games. Mikita was inducted into the Hockey Hall of Fame in 1983, and into the Slovak Hockey Hall of Fame in 2002.

After retiring, Mikita became a golf pro at Kemper Lakes Golf Club. His other business interests, under Stan Mikita Enterprises, included making the small plastic sauce containers that accompany chicken nuggets at McDonald&#x27;s. He owned Stan Mikita&#x27;s Village Inn in the 1960s and 1970s, located in the Oakbrook Shopping Center, Oak Brook, Illinois.

Mikita provided the foreword to the children&#x27;s book &quot;My Man Stan&quot; by Tim Wendel. Mikita is featured as a main character in the book.

He became a goodwill ambassador for the Blackhawks&#x27; organization, and in fall of 2011, the Blackhawks raised a statue honouring Mikita at Gate 3½ at Chicago&#x27;s United Center. For three decades the Blackhawks Alumni Association has hosted an annual golf tournament named in Mikita&#x27;s honour.

, Mikita ranks 15th in regular-season points scored in the history of the NHL, and just three other players (Steve Yzerman, Alex Delvecchio, and Nicklas Lidström) have appeared in more games while playing for only one team over their careers.

Mikita appeared as himself in a cameo role in the 1992 film &quot;Wayne&#x27;s World&quot;, which featured a &quot;Stan Mikita&quot; doughnut shop, spoofing the Canadian doughnut chain Tim Hortons (co-founded by Hockey Hall of Fame member Tim Horton). A restaurant named &quot;Stan Mikita&#x27;s&quot; and closely resembling the movie&#x27;s version opened in 1994 at the Virginia amusement park Kings Dominion and at Paramount Carowinds in Charlotte.

==Illness and death==
On May 24, 2011, Mikita was diagnosed with oral cancer and began external beam radiation therapy. On January 30, 2015, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot; released this statement from his wife: &quot;Stan has been diagnosed with suspected Lewy body dementia, a progressive disease, and was under the care of compassionate and understanding care givers&quot;. In June, 2015, it was stated that Mikita had no memory of his former life and was being cared for by his wife Jill.

Mikita died at the age of 78 on August 7, 2018. He was survived by his wife, four children and nine grandchildren. Mikita’s ashes are interred at Bronswood Cemetery in Oak Brook, Illinois. On September 14, 2019, it was reported by the Boston University CTE Center, that upon performing a posthumous study of Mikita&#x27;s brain, it was found that he suffered from stage 3 chronic traumatic encephalopathy, or CTE, at the time of his death. This marked Mikita as the first Hall of Famer to ever have been diagnosed with the disease.

<doc id="358780" wikidata="Q870258" url="?curid=358780" title="Plain of Jars">
<text>The Plain of Jars (Lao: ທົ່ງໄຫຫີນ &quot;Thong Hai Hin&quot;, ) is a megalithic archaeological landscape in Laos. It consists of thousands of stone jars scattered around the upland valleys and the lower foothills of the central plain of the Xiangkhoang Plateau. The jars are arranged in clusters ranging in number from one to several hundred.

The Xiangkhoang Plateau is at the northern end of the Annamese Cordillera, the principal mountain range of Indochina. French researcher Madeleine Colani concluded in 1930 that the jars were associated with burial practices. Excavation by Lao and Japanese archaeologists in the intervening years has supported this interpretation with the discovery of human remains, burial goods and ceramics around the jars. Researchers (using optically stimulated luminescence) determined that the jars were put in place as early as 1240 to 660 BC. The jars at Site 1 (using detrital zircon geochronology) were determined to have been transported to their current location from a presumed quarry eight kilometers away. The Plain of Jars is one of the most important prehistoric sites in Southeast Asia.

==Jar sites==
More than 90 jar sites have been identified in Xiangkhouang Province. Each site has between one and 400 stone jars. The jars vary in height and diameter between 1 m and 3 m and are all hewn from rock. Their shape is cylindrical, with the bottom always wider than the top. The stone jars are undecorated, with the exception of a single jar at Site 1. This jar has a human &quot;frogman&quot; bas-relief carved on the exterior. Parallels between the &quot;frogman&quot; and the rock painting at Huashan in Guangxi, China, have been drawn. The Chinese paintings, which depict large full-frontal images of humans with arms raised and knees bent, date to 500 BC–200 AD.

Since most of the jars have lip rims, it is thought that the jars originally supported lids, although few stone lids have been recorded; this suggests that the bulk of lids were fashioned from perishable materials. Stone lids with animal carvings have been found at a few sites such as Ban Phakeo (Site 52). The bas-relief carvings are thought to depict monkeys, tigers and frogs.

Stone discs have also been found. The discs, which differ from the lids, have at least one flat side and are grave markers which were placed on the surface to cover or mark a burial pit. These grave markers appear more rarely than jars, but are found in close proximity. Similarly, the stone grave markers are unworked but have been intentionally placed to mark a grave. To the north of Xiangkhouang, an extensive network of intentionally placed and largely unworked stones marking elaborate burial pits and chambers are known as the &quot;standing stones of Huaphanh&quot;. These have been dated to the Bronze Age.

The jars lie in clusters on the lower foothills and ridges of the hills surrounding the central plateau and upland valleys. Several quarry sites have been recorded, usually close to the jar sites. Five rock types have been identified: sandstone, granite, conglomerate, limestone and breccia. The majority of the jars are sandstone. It is assumed that Plain of Jars people used iron chisels to manufacture the jars, although no conclusive evidence for this exists. Regional differences in jar shape have been noted. While the differences in most cases can be attributed to choice and manipulation of rock source, some differences in form (such as variations in the placement of jar apertures) appear to be unique to specific sites.

A cave at Site 1 is a natural limestone formation with an opening to the northwest and two man-made holes at the top. These holes are thought to have been chimneys for a crematorium. French geologist and amateur archaeologist Madeleine Colani excavated inside the cave in the early 1930s and found material to support a crematorium theory. Colani also recorded and excavated at twelve Plain of Jars sites and published two volumes with her findings in 1935. Colani concluded that the Plain of Jars was an Iron Age burial site. Inside the jars she found, embedded in black organic soil, coloured glass beads and burnt teeth and bone fragments, sometimes from more than one individual. Around the stone jars, she found human bones, pottery fragments, iron and bronze objects, glass and stone beads, ceramic weights and charcoal. The bone and teeth inside the jars show signs of cremation, while the burials surrounding the jars yield unburnt secondary burial bones.

No further archaeological research was conducted until November 1994, when Professor Eiji Nitta of Kagoshima University and Lao archaeologist Thongsa Sayavongkhamdy surveyed and mapped Site 1. Nitta claimed that the surrounding burial pits were contemporaneous to the jars, as they were cut into the surface on which the jars had been placed. Nitta believed the jars were symbolic monuments to mark the surrounding burials. He dated the Plain of Jars to the late second or early first millennium BC based on the burial urn and associated grave goods. Sayavongkhamdy undertook surveys and excavations between 1994 and 1996, supported by the Australian National University. Sayavongkhamdy and Peter Bellwood interpreted the stone jars as a central person&#x27;s primary or secondary burial, surrounded by secondary burials of family members. Archaeological data collected during bomb clearance operations supervised by UNESCO archaeologist Julie Van Den Bergh in 2004–2005 and again in 2007 provided similar archaeological results. Like Nitta, Van Den Bergh concluded that the jars and surrounding burials were contemporaneous.

Variations in the practices of cremation inside jars and secondary burial outside jars, as noted by Colani, have proven difficult to explain. The cremated remains seem to mainly belong to adolescents. While the bomb clearance operations did not involve emptying the jars and thus no additional evidence could be gathered, Van Den Bergh suggested that the stone jars initially may have been used to distill the dead bodies and that the cremated remains within the jars represent the most recent phase in the Plain of Jars. The jars with smaller apertures may reflect the diminishing need to place an entire body inside.

The suggestion that the jars, as in traditional Southeast Asian royal mortuary practices, functioned as &quot;distilling vessels&quot;, was put forward by R. Engelhardt and P. Rogers in 2001. In contemporary funerary practices followed by Thai, Cambodian, and Laotian royalty, the corpse of the deceased is placed into an urn during the early stages of the funeral rites, at which time the soul of deceased is believed to be undergoing gradual transformation from the earthly to the spiritual world. The ritual decomposition is later followed by cremation and secondary burial.

The royal burials are across watercourses from the habitation areas in a geographically high, prominent area. Among the Black Thai people who have been in the region at least since the 11th century, the upper classes are cremated in the belief that it will release their spirits to heaven, while commoners are buried, leaving their spirits to remain on Earth.

Colani connected the location of the jars sites to ancient trade routes, in particular with the salt trade. She assumed that salt was a commodity sought after by the Plain of Jars people, which brought traders to the Xiangkhouang Plateau. The Xiangkhouang area is rich in metallic minerals, mainly due to granite intrusions and associated hydrothermal activity.

Two principal iron ore deposits exist in Laos, both in Xiangkhouang. The presence and locations of the numerous jar sites in Xiangkhouang may relate to trading and mining activities. History has shown that Xiangkhouang, at the northern end of the Annamite Range, provides relative easy passage from the north and east to the south and west.

Within the geographic setting of Xiangkhouang, the jar sites may reflect a network of intercultural villages, whereby the locations of the jars are associated with long-distance overland routes which connect the Mekong basin and the Gulf of Tonkin System. The jar sites show superficial regional differences, such as jar form, material, and the number of jars per site, but all share common setting characteristics such as burial practices, elevated locations, and commanding views over the surrounding area.

The most investigated and visited Jar site is close to the town of Phonsavan, and is known as Site 1. Seven jar sites have now been cleared of unexploded bombs and are open to visitors. These are currently sites 1, 2 and 3, and Site 16 near the old capital Xieng Khouang; Site 23, near the big hot spring in Muang Kham; Site 25 in the largely unvisited Phou Kout District; and Site 52, the largest known jar site to date with 392 jars near a traditional Hmong village only accessible by foot.

==Legends and local history==

Lao legends tell of a race of giants who inhabited the area and were ruled by a king named Khun Cheung who fought a long and ultimately victorious battle against an enemy. He supposedly created the jars to brew and store huge amounts of &quot;lau hai&quot; (&quot;lau&quot; means &#x27;alcohol&#x27;, &quot;hai&quot; means &#x27;jar&#x27;; so &quot;lau hai&quot; means &#x27;rice beer&#x27; or &#x27;rice wine&#x27; in the jars) to celebrate his victory. Another local story states that the jars were molded from natural materials including clay, sand, sugar, and animal products in a type of stone mix. This led the locals to believe the cave at Site 1 was actually a kiln, and that the jars were fired there and are not actually hewn from stone.

==Present day==
Between May 1964 and the summer of 1969, the Plain of Jars was heavily bombed by the United States Air Force operating against North Vietnamese and Pathet Lao communist forces during the Secret War. This included 262 million anti-personnel cluster bombs. An estimated 80 million of these did not explode and remain a deadly threat to the population.

The large quantity of unexploded bombs in the area, especially cluster munitions, limits free movement. Evidence of the bombing raids can be seen in the form of broken or displaced jars and bomb craters. Sightseeing on the Plain of Jars can only be done safely on cleared and marked pathways.

The Mines Advisory Group, a non-governmental organization, in collaboration with UNESCO and funded by the New Zealand government (NZAID), cleared unexploded bombs from the three most visited sites from July 2004 to July 2005. A second phase of bomb clearance at the sites, also funded by NZAID, was undertaken in 2007, during which four more jar sites were made safe.

On 6 July 2019, the Plain of Jars was inscribed as a UNESCO World Heritage Site.

<doc id="358782" wikidata="Q7965253" url="?curid=358782" title="Walter James (Australian politician)">
<text>Sir Walter Hartwell James , (29 March 1863 – 3 January 1943) was the fifth Premier of Western Australia and an ardent supporter of the federation movement.

==Background and early career==
James was born in Perth, in what was then the British colony of Western Australia. He was educated at Perth Boys School and later at Perth High School (now Hale School). After his father&#x27;s death, his mother remarried to George Randell, a member of the Legislative Council. James was thus the step-brother of Ernest Randell, who later played cricket for Western Australia. In his youth, James worked as a jackaroo at De Grey Station in the Pilbara, but after being shipwrecked off Rottnest Island in 1883 on his way to the Pilbara, he turned to the legal profession. He was articled to George Leake in 1883, and was admitted to the Western Australian bar in 1888. Shortly afterwards he went into partnership with Leake. James also played football for the Rovers Football Club in the West Australian Football Association. He later served as secretary of the Association. On 21 June 1892, he married Eleanora Marie Gwenifryd Hearder.

==Political career==
From 1890 to 1896, James represented Central Ward on Perth City Council. In 1894 he was elected to the Legislative Assembly seat of East Perth. James sat in the Legislative Assembly as an independent, and was a consistent opponent of John Forrest&#x27;s government. He was a strong advocate for social reform, working for women&#x27;s suffrage over a long period, and playing an active part in the establishment of a compulsory, free, secular education system. He became an active member of the Western Australian Liberal Association, a reformist organisation that pursued liberal ideals.
James was also strongly in favour of federation, and campaigned heavily with George Leake and James Gardiner for Western Australia to become an original member of the Federation. He was a member of the Western Australian delegation to the Federal Conventions of 1897 and 1898, but missed three quarters of its votes, the worst absence record of any delegate. In May 1898 he helped found the Federal League, and in the same month Edmund Barton thanked James for his &quot;generous contributions&quot; to the Yes campaign in the NSW federation referendum.

On 28 June 1901, James was appointed minister without portfolio in the first Leake government. In 1902 he was made KC. After Leake died in late June 1902, &quot;Nutty&quot; James, as he was popularly known, was appointed Premier and Attorney-General on 1 July. As premier, James fought for the state&#x27;s interests against an aggressive Commonwealth executive. He also led a reforming government; its achievements include legalization of the union movement, the first workers&#x27; compensation, a stronger Arbitration Act, and the opening of the current Parliament House. James also tried but failed to reform the franchise; he achieved only the abolition of plural voting, and an increase in Goldfields representation. These changes appear to have been his undoing, as it is likely that they were key factors in Labor&#x27;s strong support in the election of 28 June 1904, after which James was defeated when Parliament next met on 10 August 1904.

==Post-political career==
On 22 September 1904, James resigned from parliament to take up an appointment as Agent-General for Western Australia in London. He was appointed Knight Bachelor on 28 June 1907. After returning to Perth from London, he devoted himself to his legal practice and rose to prominence as a leading member of the Bar. In 1910 he contested the Legislative Assembly seat of Beverley at a by-election, but was unsuccessful.

James was involved with the East Perth Cricket Club (now Perth Cricket Club) in the WACA and served a two-season term as President of the club from 1908 to 1910.

In 1909, James was appointed to a Royal Commission to enquire into the establishment of a university in Perth. When the University of Western Australia was established, he became a founding member. He continued to serve the university for many years, and was elected pro-Chancellor on 19 August 1929 and Chancellor on 17 March 1930; and retired in 1936.

In 1931, James was elevated to KCMG. In 1932, he declined an offer from Premier James Mitchell to become Lieutenant-Governor of Western Australia. In 1936, he accepted an honorary degree of Doctor of Laws. He died on 3 January 1943, and was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery.

<doc id="358789" wikidata="Q58337" url="?curid=358789" title="Banff, Alberta">
<text>Banff is a resort town in Banff National Park, Alberta, Canada, in Alberta&#x27;s Rockies along the Trans-Canada Highway, west of Calgary, east of Lake Louise, and above 

Banff was the first municipality to incorporate within a Canadian national park. The town is a member of the Calgary Regional Partnership.

Banff is one of Canada&#x27;s most popular tourist destinations. Known for its mountainous surroundings and hot springs, it is a destination for outdoor sports and hiking, biking, scrambling and skiing. Sunshine Village, Ski Norquay and Lake Louise Ski Resort are nearby ski resorts within the national park.

==Toponymy==
The area was named Banff in 1884 by George Stephen, president of the Canadian Pacific Railway, recalling his birthplace near Banff, Scotland. The Canadian Pacific built a series of grand hotels along the rail line and advertised the Banff Springs Hotel as an international tourist resort.

== History ==
Banff was first settled in the 1880s after the transcontinental railway was built through the Bow Valley. In 1883, three Canadian Pacific Railway workers stumbled upon a series of natural hot springs on the side of Sulphur Mountain. In 1885, Canada established a federal reserve of around the Cave and Basin hot springs and began promoting the area as an international resort and spa as a way to support the new railway. In 1887, the reserve area was increased to and named &quot;Rocky Mountain Park&quot;. This was the beginning of Canada&#x27;s National Park system.

The Banff townsite was developed near the railway station as a service centre for tourists visiting the park. Services, such as St George-in-the-Pines church, were constructed through the late 19th century. It was administered by the Government of Canada&#x27;s national parks system until 1990 when the Town of Banff became the only incorporated municipality within a Canadian national park.

An internment camp was set up at Banff and Castle Mountain in Dominion Park from July 1915 to July 1917 mostly imprisoning Ukrainian immigrants. The prisoners of the internment camp were used as slave labour to build the infrastructure of the national park.

In 1985, the United Nations declared Banff National Park, as one of the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, a World Heritage Site. Banff remains one of the most popular tourist destinations in Canada.

One of the most notable figures of Banff was Norman Luxton, who was known as &quot;Mr. Banff&quot;. He published the Crag and Canyon newspaper, built the King Edward Hotel and the Lux Theatre, and founded the Sign of the Goat Curio Shop, which led to the development of the Luxton Museum of Plains Indians, now the Buffalo Nations Museum. He and his family helped organize the Banff Indian Days and the Banff Winter Carnival.

In 1976, the International Astronomical Union&#x27;s Working Group for Planetary System Nomenclature (IAU/WGPSN) officially adopted the name Banff for a crater on Mars, after the town in Alberta. The crater is at latitude 17.7° north and longitude 30.8° west. Its diameter is .

In 1991, Banff hosted the 1991 Winter Deaflympics, the first Deaflympics hosted in Canada, and the only Deaflympics held in Canada since then.

In response to the COVID-19 pandemic, the town chose to temporarily close portions of its main street to vehicle traffic to create a Downtown Pedestrian Zone. The Banff Town Council said the pedestrian zone would stay in effect until at least 2023.

== Attractions ==

Several mountains are located immediately adjacent to the townsite, including Mount Rundle (); Cascade Mountain (); and Mount Norquay (). Mount Norquay has a ski slope as well as mountain biking trails on the Stoney Squaw portion, and Via Ferrata (an assisted climbing experience). A tourist attraction, the Banff Gondola, is available to ascend Sulphur Mountain () where a boardwalk (Banff Skywalk) beginning from the upper terminal connects to Sanson Peak. Sulphur Mountain is also the location of the Banff Upper Hot Springs.

Lake Minnewanka located six minutes north of the townsite is a day-use area with a variety of activities. Mountain biking, hiking, and fishing are allowed in this part of the park. A Lake Cruise, motor boat rentals, and a small food concession are available at the marina.

Tunnel Mountain (formerly known as Sleeping Buffalo Mountain) () is situated within the townsite and has a summit that can be scaled in less than half an hour. It was named Tunnel Mountain because surveyors initially wanted to make a tunnel for the Canadian Pacific Railway right through the mountain, instead of following the Bow River Valley. Located on the side of Tunnel Mountain is the Banff Centre for Arts and Creativity, which hosts events, including outdoor concerts, dance, opera, and theatre.

Banff is home to the Banff World Television Festival, Banff Mountain Film Festival, Rocky Mountain Music Festival, and Bike Fest. The town is also the starting point of the Great Divide Mountain Bike Route, which terminates at Antelope Wells, New Mexico in the United States.

== Sports ==
Banff and nearby Canmore played host to the 2014 Alberta Winter Games.

Banff also hosted the 1991 Winter Deaflympics.

For several years there has been an annual long-distance relay run between Banff and Jasper, Alberta (formerly known as the Jasper to Banff Relay).

Banff has a long history of hosting Team Canada hockey training camps, including Canada&#x27;s 2012 World Junior Ice Hockey Championships team when the event was held in Alberta and the 1984 Canada Cup squad which practiced there, before the start of the tournament.

== Infrastructure ==
=== Transportation ===
In June 2008, the Banff council launched a local bus system called Roam, with three routes connecting the town, Tunnel Mountain, the Banff Springs Hotel, and the Banff Gondola. The service is operated using four hybrid Nova buses, each decorated with scenes from the National Park. 

Many bus stops along the routes have screens that tell passengers exactly how many minutes before the next two buses arrive. In December 2012, the bus system was expanded to include the hourly Route 3 service between Banff and Canmore.

As of January 2024, Roam Transit offers 10 routes, the majority serving destinations within Banff or to national park locations nearby. In addition, Roam also offers two routes to Lake Louise, as well as a local service route within Canmore.

The railway came to Banff when the Canadian Pacific Railway (CPR) line from Calgary opened in 1883. The current station building was opened by the CPR in 1910, and was declared a heritage railway station by the Canadian federal government in 1991.

Via Rail long-distance trains no longer serve Banff, but the railway station remains in use by the Rocky Mountaineer and Royal Canadian Pacific tour trains.

The nearest airport to Banff with major service is the Calgary International Airport in Calgary.

<doc id="358803" wikidata="Q157310" url="?curid=358803" title="Panchen Lama">
<text>The Panchen Lama () is a tulku of the Gelug school of Tibetan Buddhism. The Panchen Lama is one of the most important figures in the Gelug tradition, with its spiritual authority second only to the Dalai Lama. Along with the council of high lamas, he is in charge of seeking out the next Dalai Lama. &quot;Panchen&quot; is a portmanteau of &quot;Pandita&quot; and &quot;Chenpo&quot;, meaning &quot;great scholar&quot;.

The recognition of Panchen Lamas began with Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, tutor of the 5th Dalai Lama, who received the title &quot;Panchen Bogd&quot; from Altan Khan and the Dalai Lama in 1645. &quot;Bogd&quot; is Mongolian, meaning &quot;holy&quot;. Khedrup Gelek Pelzang, Sönam Choklang and Ensapa Lobsang Döndrup were subsequently recognized as the first to third Panchen Lamas posthumously.

In 1713, the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing dynasty granted the title Panchen Erdeni to the 5th Panchen Lama. In 1792, the Qianlong Emperor issued a decree known as the 29-Article Ordinance for the More Effective Governing of Tibet, and Article One of the decree was designed to be used in the selection of rinpoches, lamas and other high offices within Tibetan Buddhism, including the Dalai Lamas, Panchen Lamas and Mongolian lamas.

Traditionally, the Panchen Lama is the head of Tashilhunpo Monastery, and holds religious and secular power over the Tsang region centered in Shigatse, independent of the Ganden Podrang authority led by the Dalai Lama. The Dalai Lama and Panchen Lama are closely connected, and each participates in the process of recognizing the other&#x27;s reincarnations.

The current 11th Panchen Lama, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima, was recognized by the 14th Dalai Lama on May 14, 1995. Three days later, the six-year-old Panchen Lama was kidnapped by the government of the People&#x27;s Republic of China and his family was taken into custody. The Chinese government instead named Gyaincain Norbu as the 11th Panchen Lama. Their nomination has been widely rejected by Buddhists in Tibet and abroad, while governments have called for information about and the release of the Panchen Lama. Gedhun Choekyi Nyima has never been seen publicly since 1995.

== History ==
=== Name ===
The successive Panchen Lamas form a &quot;tulku&quot; reincarnation lineage which are said to be the incarnations of Amitābha. The title, meaning &quot;Great Scholar&quot;, is a Tibetan contraction of the Sanskrit &quot;paṇḍita&quot; (scholar) and the Tibetan &quot;chenpo&quot; (great). The Panchen Lama traditionally lived in Tashilhunpo Monastery in Shigatse. From the name of this monastery, the Europeans referred to the Panchen Lama as the &quot;Tashi-Lama&quot; (also spelled &quot;Tesho-Lama&quot; or &quot;Teshu-Lama&quot;).

Other titles of Panchen Lama include &quot;Panchen Bogd&quot;, the original title given by Altan Khan at the creation of the lineage. &quot;Bogd&quot; (Mongolian: ᠪᠣᠭᠳᠠ &quot;богд&quot;) is Mongolian, meaning &quot;holy, saint&quot;. In 1713, the 5th Panchen Lama Lobsang Yeshe received the title &quot;Panchen Erdeni&quot; from the Kangxi Emperor of the Qing Dynasty, which has been inherited by successive Panchen Lamas since then. &quot;Erdeni&quot;, or &quot;Erdini&quot;, (Manchu: ᡝᡵᡩᡝᠨᡳ &quot;erdeni&quot;) is Manchu, meaning &quot;treasure&quot;.

=== First Panchen Lama ===
Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen (1570–1662), was the first Panchen Lama to be accorded this title during his lifetime. He was the tutor and a close ally of the 5th Dalai Lama,
&quot;The Great Fifth&quot;, as he is known, pronounced the Panchen to be an incarnation of the celestial buddha Amitābha.

The 5th Dalai Lama requested the Panchen to accept Tashilhunpo Monastery, built by the 1st Dalai Lama, as his multi-lifetime seat for future incarnations. Since then, every incarnation of the Panchen Lama has been the master of Tashilhunpo Monastery and it is there that they have all received their education and their mummified bodies were enshrined.

When Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen died in 1662, the fifth Dalai Lama commenced the tradition of searching for his next incarnation. He also reserved the traditional title of &quot;Panchen&quot; which had previously been a courtesy title for all exceptionally learned lamas – exclusively for his successors. Khedrub Je, Sönam Choklang and Ensapa Lobsang Döndrup were posthumously decided by the 5th Dalai Lama to have been a previous incarnation of Lobsang Chökyi Gyaltsen, 4th Panchen Lama (1570–1662). Traditionally, there were considered to be four Indian and three Tibetan incarnations before Khedrup, starting with Subhuti, one of the original disciples of Gautama Buddha. Gö Lotsawa is considered to be the first Tibetan incarnation of Amitabha in this line.
The recognition of Panchen Lamas has always been a matter involving the Dalai Lama. Choekyi Gyaltsen, 10th Panchen Lama, himself declared, as cited by an official Chinese review that &quot;according to Tibetan tradition, the confirmation of either the Dalai or Panchen must be mutually recognized.&quot; The involvement of the government of China in this affair is seen by some as a political ploy to try to gain control over the recognition of the next Dalai Lama (see below), and to strengthen their hold over the future of Tibet and its governance. The government claims however, that their involvement does not break with tradition in that the final decision about the recognition of both the Dalai Lama and the Panchen Lama traditionally rested in the hands of the Chinese emperor. For instance, after 1792, the Golden Urn was thought to have been used in selecting the 10th, 11th and 12th Dalai Lamas; but the 14th Dalai Lama, Tenzin Gyatso, has more recently said that this was only really used in selection of the 11th, and that in the other cases it was only used to humour the Chinese to confirm a selection that had already been made by traditional methods.

=== Modern times ===
In 1924, the thirteenth Dalai Lama prohibited the 9th Panchen Lama&#x27;s followers from holding any office in the Central Tibetan government and imprisoned them in Lhasa, prompting the Panchen Lama to flee to Inner Mongolia, China. The Dalai Lama was attempting to collect revenue from the Panchen Lama&#x27;s estate to cover Tibet&#x27;s military expenses, and to reduce the power of the Panchen Lama. In China, the ninth Panchen Lama worked on plans to develop Tibet. He also held a position in the Mongolian and Tibetan Affairs Commission, and was considered extremely &quot;pro-Chinese&quot;. There, he adopted the ideas of Sun Yatsen through revolutionary Pandatsang Rapga of the Tibet Improvement Party.

When the Ninth Panchen Lama died in 1937, two simultaneous searches for the tenth Panchen Lama produced two competing candidates, with the Dalai Lama&#x27;s officials selecting a boy from Xikang and the Panchen Lama&#x27;s officials picking Gonpo Tseten. The Republic of China government, then embroiled in the Chinese Civil War, declared its support for Tseten on June 3, 1949. Chinese Nationalist governor Ma Bufang allowed Kumbum Monastery to be totally self-governed by Tseten, now called Gyaltsen, while the 14th Dalai Lama&#x27;s government refused to recognize him.

The 10th Panchen Lama sought revenge on the Dalai Lama by leading an army against him, and requested aid from Ma Bufang in September 1949. However, the Chinese Nationalist government, facing defeat from the communists, requested the Panchen Lama&#x27;s help instead. They formulated a plan where three Khampa divisions would be led by the Panchen Lama as a broad anti-Communist base in Southwest China, but the Panchen Lama decided to defect to the Communists instead. The Panchen Lama, unlike the Dalai Lama, sought to exert control in decision making.

The Panchen Lama initially supported Communist policies for Tibet. Radio Beijing broadcast the religious leader&#x27;s call for Tibet to be &quot;liberated&quot; into the PRC, which created pressure on the Lhasa government to negotiate with the People&#x27;s Republic. He also called on Tibetans to support the Chinese government.&quot; However in 1962, he wrote the 70,000 Character Petition detailing abuses of power in Tibet and discussed it with Premier Zhou Enlai. However, in 1964, he was imprisoned and forced to undergo struggle sessions. In October 1977, he was released but held under house arrest in 1982. In 1979, he married a Han Chinese woman and in 1983 they had a daughter. In 1989, the tenth Panchen Lama died suddenly in Shigatse at the age of 51 shortly after giving a speech criticizing the excesses of the Cultural Revolution in Tibet but praising the reform and opening up of the 1980s. His daughter, now a young woman, is Yabshi Pan Rinzinwangmo, better known as &quot;Renji&quot;.

The Dalai Lama named Gedhun Choekyi Nyima as the 11th incarnation of the Panchen Lama on May 14, 1995. The Chinese government insisted that the 11th Panchen Lama has to be chosen via the golden urn. In selecting a name, lottery numbers were drawn from the Golden Urn. Chinese authorities named Gyancain Norbu as the search committee&#x27;s choice on November 11, 1995. Gedhun Choekyi Nyima has not been observed by an independent party ever since May 17, 1995. The Chinese government claims he is living a &quot;normal private life&quot;. Tibetans and human rights groups continue to campaign for his release.

== Relation to the Dalai Lama lineage ==
The Panchen Lama bears part of the responsibility of the monk-regent for finding the incarnation of the Dalai Lama, and vice versa. This has been the tradition since the 5th Dalai Lama recognized his teacher &quot;Lobsang Choekyi Gyaltsen&quot; as the Panchen Lama of Tashilhunpo. With this appointment, Lobsang Choekyi Gyaltsen&#x27;s three previous incarnations were posthumously recognised as Panchen Lamas. The &quot;Great Fifth&quot; also recognized Lobsang Yeshe, 5th Panchen Lama. The 7th Dalai Lama recognized Lobsang Palden Yeshe, 6th Panchen Lama, who in turn recognized the 8th Dalai Lama. Similarly, the Eighth Dalai Lama recognised Palden Tenpai Nyima, 7th Panchen Lama. The current 14th Dalai Lama was first found by the 9th Panchen Lama when he was living in the Kumbum Monastery. In February 1937, the Panchen Lama informed his investigation to the Tibetan government&#x27;s representatives, who would later confirm the new Dalai Lama&#x27;s identity. On January 26, 1940, the Regent Reting Rinpoche requested the Central Government to exempt Tenzin Gyatso from lot-drawing process using Golden Urn to become the 14th Dalai Lama. The request was approved by the Central Government.

== Political significance ==
Monastic figures had historically held important roles in the social makeup of Tibet, and though these roles have diminished since 1959, many Tibetans continue to regard the Panchen Lama as a significant political, as well as spiritual figure due to the role he traditionally plays in selecting the next Dalai Lama. The political significance of the role is also utilized by the Chinese state. Tibetan support groups such as London-based Free Tibet have argued that the Chinese government seeks to install its own choice of Dalai Lama when Tenzin Gyatso, the current Dalai Lama, dies and that for this reason the Dalai Lama&#x27;s choice of Panchen Lama, Gedhun Choekyi Nyima went missing at the age of six, to be replaced by the Chinese state&#x27;s choice, Gyaincain Norbu. It is suggested that the Chinese government may give the title of Dalai Lama to the son of a loyal ethnic Tibetan Communist party member and it will pressure Western governments to recognize its boy, and not the boy chosen by Lamas in India, as the head of Tibetan Buddhism.

<text>Taa ( ), also known as ǃXóõ ( ; ; also spelled ǃKhong and ǃXoon), is a Tuu language notable for its large number of phonemes, perhaps the largest in the world. It is also notable for having perhaps the heaviest functional load of click consonants, with one count finding that 82% of basic vocabulary items started with a click. Most speakers live in Botswana, but a few hundred live in Namibia. The people call themselves ǃXoon (pl. ǃXooŋake) or ʼNǀohan (pl. Nǀumde), depending on the dialect they speak. The Tuu languages are one of the three traditional language families that make up the Khoisan languages. In 2011, there were around 2,500 speakers of Taa.

 is the word for &#x27;human being&#x27;; the local name of the language is , from &#x27;language&#x27;. (ǃXóõ) is an ethnonym used at opposite ends of the Taa-speaking area, but not by Taa speakers in between. Most living Taa speakers are ethnic ǃXoon (plural ) or &#x27;Nǀohan (plural ).

Taa shares a number of characteristic features with West ǂʼAmkoe and Gǀui, which together are considered part of the Kalahari Basin sprachbund.

==Classification==
Until the rediscovery of a few elderly speakers of Nǁng in the 1990s, Taa was thought to be the last surviving member of the Tuu language family.

==Dialects==
There is sufficient dialectal variation in Taa that it might be better described as a dialect continuum than a single language. Taa dialects fall into two groups, suggesting a historical spread from west to east:
*Taa dialects
**West Taa: Anthony Traill&#x27;s West ǃXoon and Dorothea Bleek&#x27;s Nǀuǁʼen
**East Taa
***ǃAma (Western)
***(Eastern)
****East ǃXoon (Lone Tree)
****Tsaasi–ǂHuan
*****Tsaasi
*****ǂHuan
Traill worked primarily with East ǃXoon, and the DoBeS project is working with ʼNǀohan (in East Taa) and West ǃXoon.

==Alternate names==
The various dialects and social groups of the Taa, their many names, the unreliability of transcriptions found in the literature, and the fact that names may be shared between languages and that dialects have been classified, has resulted in a great deal of confusion. Traill (1974), for example, spent two chapters of his &quot;Compleat Guide to the Koon&quot; [sic] disentangling names and dialects.

The name &quot;ǃXoon&quot; (more precisely &quot;ǃXóõ)&quot; is only used at Aminius Reserve in Namibia, around Lone Tree where Traill primarily worked, and at Dzutshwa (Botswana). It is, however, used by the ǃXoon for all Taa speakers. It has been variously spelled &quot;ǃxō, ǃkɔ̃ː, ǃko/ǃkõ, Khong,&quot; and the fully anglicized &quot;Koon&quot;.

Bleek&#x27;s Nǀuǁʼen dialect has been spelled &quot;ǀNuǁen, ǀNuǁe꞉n, Ngǀuǁen, Nguen, Nǀhuǁéi, ŋǀuǁẽin, ŋǀuǁẽi, ŋǀuǁen, ǀuǁen.&quot; It has also been called by the ambiguous Khoekhoe term &quot;Nǀusan (Nǀu-san, Nǀūsā, Nǀuusaa, Nǀhusi),&quot; sometimes rendered &quot;Nusan&quot; or &quot;Noosan&quot;, which has been used for other languages in the area. A subgroup was known as &quot;Koon&quot; . This dialect is apparently extinct.

Westphal studied ǂHuan (ǂhũa) dialect (or &quot;ǂHũa-ʘwani&quot;), and used this name for the entire language. However, the term is ambiguous between Taa (Western ǂHũa) and ǂʼAmkoe (Eastern ǂHũa), and for this reason Traill chose to call the language &quot;ǃXóõ&quot;.

Tsaasi dialect is quite similar to ǂHuan, and like &quot;ǂHuan,&quot; the name is used ambiguously for a dialect of ǂʼAmkoe. This is a Tswana name, variously rendered &quot;Tshasi, Tshase, Tʃase, Tsase,&quot; &quot;Sasi&quot;, and &quot;Sase&quot;.

The Tswana term for Bushmen, &quot;Masarwa&quot;, is frequently encountered. More specific to the Taa are &quot;Magon (Magong)&quot; and the &quot;Tshasi&quot; mentioned above.

The Taa distinguish themselves along at least some of the groups above. Like many San peoples, they also distinguish themselves by the environment they live in (plain people, river people, etc.), and also by direction. Traill reports the following:

:&quot;&quot; &quot;westerners&quot;
:&quot;&quot; &quot;southerners&quot;
:&quot;&quot; &quot;in-betweeners&quot;
:&quot;&quot; &quot;pure people&quot;

Heinz reports that &quot;&quot; is an exonym given by other Bushmen, and that the Taa call themselves &quot;.&quot;

The Taa refer to their language as &#x27; &quot;people&#x27;s language&quot;. Westphal (1971) adopted the word &#x27; &quot;person&quot; as the name for the Southern Khoisan language family, which is now called &quot;Tuu&quot;. The East ǃXoon term for the language is &quot;ǃxóɲa ǂâã&quot; .

==Phonology==
Taa has at least 58 consonants, 31 vowels, and four tones (Traill 1985, 1994 on East ǃXoon), or at least 87 consonants, 20 vowels, and two tones (DoBeS 2008 on West ǃXoon), by many counts the most of any known language if vowels other than oral modal vowels are counted as different from corresponding oral modal vowels. These include 20 (Traill) or 43 (DoBeS) click consonants and several vowel phonations, though opinions vary as to which of the 130 (Traill) or 164 (DoBeS) consonant sounds are single segments and which are consonant clusters.

===Tones===
Anthony Traill describes four tones for the East ǃXoon dialect: high , mid , low , and mid-falling . Patterns for bisyllabic bases include high-high, mid-mid, mid-mid-falling, and low-low. DoBeS describes only two tonemes, high and low, for the West ǃXoon dialect. By analyzing each base as bimoraic, Traill&#x27;s four tones are mapped onto [áá], [àá], [àà], and [áà]. Unlike Traill, Naumann does not find a four-way contrast on monomoraic grammatical forms in Eastern ǃXoõ data.

In addition to lexical tone, Traill describes East ǃXoon nouns as falling into two tone classes according to the melody induced on concordial morphemes and transitive verbs: either level (Tone Class I) or falling (Tone Class II). Transitive object nouns from Tone Class I trigger mid/mid-rising tone in transitive verbs, while Tone Class 2 objects correlate with any tone contour. Naumann finds the same results in the eastern ʼNǀohan dialect.

===Vowels===
Taa has five vowel qualities, . The Traill and DoBeS descriptions differ in the phonations of these vowels; it&#x27;s not clear if this reflects a dialectal difference or a difference of analysis.

====East ǃXoon (Traill)====
Traill describes the phonations of the East ǃXoon dialect as plain , murmured , or glottalized . may also be both glottalized and murmured , as well as pharyngealized / or strident (&#x27;sphincteric&#x27;) /. may be both pharyngealized and glottalized , for 26 vowels not counting nasalization or length.

Murmured vowels after plain consonants contrast with plain vowels after aspirated consonants, and likewise glottalized vowels with ejective consonants, so these are phonations of the vowels and not assimilation with consonant phonation.

Vowels may be long or short, but long vowels may be sequences rather than distinct phonemes. The other vowel quality sequences—better known as diphthongs—disregarding the added complexity of phonation, are .

All plain vowels may be nasalized. No other phonation may be nasalized, but nasalization occurs in combination with other phonations as the second vowel of a sequence (&quot;long vowel&quot; or &quot;diphthong&quot;). These sequences alternate dialectally with vowel plus velar nasal. That is, the name ǃXóõ may be dialectally , and this in turn may be phonemically , since does not occur word-finally. However, this cannot explain the short nasal vowels, so Taa has at least 31 vowels.

A long, glottalized, murmured, nasalized &quot;o&quot; with falling tone is written . A long, strident nasalized &quot;o&quot; with low tone is written , since Traill analyzes stridency as phonemically pharyngealized murmur. (Note that phonetically these are distinct phonations.)

====West ǃXoon (DoBeS)====
DoBeS describes the phonations of the West ǃXoon dialect as plain, &quot;a e i o u;&quot; nasalized, &quot;an en in on un;&quot; epiglottalized or pharyngealized, &quot;aq eq iq oq uq;&quot; strident, &quot;aqh eqh iqh oqh uqh;&quot; and glottalized or &#x27;tense&#x27;, &quot;aʼ eʼ iʼ oʼ uʼ.&quot;

===Consonants===
Taa is unusual in allowing mixed voicing in its consonants. These have been analyzed as prevoiced, but also as consonant clusters. When homorganic, as in [dt], such clusters are listed in the chart below.

Taa consonants are complex, and it is not clear how much of the difference between the dialects is real and how much is an artifact of analysis.

====East ǃXoon (Traill)====


Consonants in parentheses are rare.

The nasal only occurs between vowels, and only word finally (and then only in some dialects, for what are nasal vowels elsewhere), so these may be allophones. also only occur in medial position, except that the last is an allophone of rare initial . and (not in the table) occur in loans, mostly English.

Taa is typologically unusual in having mixed-voice ejectives. Juǀʼhoansi, which is part of the same sprachbund as Taa, has mixed voicing in .

Taa may have as few as 83 click sounds, if the more complex clicks are analyzed as clusters. Given the intricate clusters posited seen in the non-click consonants, it is not surprising that many of the Taa clicks should be analyzed as clusters. However, there is some debate whether these are actually clusters; all non-Khoisan languages in the world that have clusters allow clusters with sonorants like &quot;r, l, w, j&quot; (as in English &quot;tree, sleep, quick, cue&quot;), and this does not occur in Taa.

There are five click articulations: bilabial, dental, lateral, alveolar, and palatal. There are nineteen series, differing in phonation, manner, and complexity (see airstream contour). These are perfectly normal consonants in Taa, and indeed are preferred over non-clicks in word-initial position.


The DoBeS project takes Traill&#x27;s cluster analysis to mean that only the twenty tenuis, voiced, nasal, and voiceless nasal clicks are basic, with the rest being clusters of the tenuis and voiced clicks with and either or . Work on Taa&#x27;s sister language Nǁng suggests that all clicks in both languages have a uvular or rear articulation, and that the clicks considered to be uvular here are actually lingual–pulmonic and lingual–glottalic airstream contours. It may be that the &#x27;prevoiced&#x27; consonants of Taa, including prevoiced clicks, can also be analyzed as contour consonants, in this case with voicing contours.

* DoBeS only matches 17 series to Traill, as the – and – distinctions he discovered had not yet been published. DoBeS and , respectively, correspond to the former pair, while and (presumably in that order, as uvular clicks tend to have a delayed release) correspond to the latter pair.

Traill&#x27;s account of East ǃXoon leaves for voiceless series of clicks without equivalents with a voiced lead. The DoBeS account of West ǃXoon, which uses voicing for morphological derivation to a greater extent than East ǃXoon does, has four additional series, written nꞰʼʼ, gꞰʼ, gꞰqʼ and nꞰhh in their practical orthography. The first three match the unpaired glottalized series of Traill, (= ), , . If Traill&#x27;s series is the voiced equivalent of plain aspirated , rather than delayed aspirated, that would leave the DobeS nꞰhh series as voiced delayed aspiration.

All nasal clicks have twin airstreams, since the air passing through the nose bypasses the tongue. Usually this is pulmonic egressive. However, the series in Taa is characterized by pulmonic &quot;ingressive&quot; nasal airflow. Ladefoged &amp; Maddieson (1996:268) state that &quot;This ǃXóõ click is probably unique among the sounds of the world&#x27;s languages that, even in the middle of a sentence, it may have ingressive pulmonic airflow.&quot; Taa is the only language known to contrast voiceless nasal and voiceless nasal aspirated (i.e. delayed aspirated) clicks (Miller 2011).

====West ǃXoon (DoBeS)====
West ǃXoon has 164 consonants in a strict unit analysis, including 111 clicks in 23 series, which under a cluster analysis reduce to 87 consonants, including 43 clicks.

These are written in the practical orthography (Naumann 2008). Marginal consonants are not marked as such.

Vowel nasalization is only phonemic on the second mora (in CCVV etc. syllables), as it is a phonetic effect of the clicks on the first mora. The clicks do not make the following vowel breathy, maintaining a contrast between and . Likewise, while clicks do make the following vowel creaky, there is a delayed onset to the vowel and the amplitude of the glottalization of is less than that of with a phonemically creaky vowel.

In an attempt to keep the phonemic inventory as symmetric as possible, the DoBeS team analyzed as segments two of the click types that Traill analyzed as clusters. These are the pre-glottalized nasal clicks, &quot;ʼnꞰ&quot;, which Traill had analyzed as , and the voiced aspirated clicks, &quot;gꞰh&quot;, which Traill had analyzed as .

The expectation, from the morphology of ǃXoon, for voiceless-voiced pairs of click clusters led to the discovery of several series not distinguished by Traill. (This morphology appears to be more pervasive in West ǃXoon than in the East ǃXoon dialect that Traill worked on.) These are voiced click types which may not exist in East ǃXoon at all, namely &quot;nꞰʼʼ, nꞰhh, gꞰʼ,&quot; and &quot;gꞰqʼ.&quot; It also lead to the rediscovery of two series that Traill had not been able to publish before his death. Thus the DoBeS team distinguishes two series, &quot;Ʞqh&quot; and &quot;Ʞh,&quot; for Trail&#x27;s &quot;Ʞqh&quot; and &quot;Ʞkh&quot;, as well as &quot;Ʞʼʼ&quot; and &quot;Ʞʼ&quot; for Traill&#x27;s &quot;Ʞqʼ&quot; and &quot;Ʞkʼ&quot; (or perhaps vice versa). If Traill&#x27;s &quot;Ʞkh&quot; series is to be analyzed as &quot;kꞰ + h&quot;, then that would require a different assessment of Traill&#x27;s delayed-aspiration series.

Under the contour analysis of Miller (2009), the distinction between simple and contour clicks largely parallels the DoBeS identification of clusters, apart from the last four rows (Ʞʼʼ, nꞰʼʼ, Ʞhh, nꞰhh), which are considered to be simple clicks.

===Phonotactics===
The Taa syllable structure, as described by DoBeS, may be one of the following:

*CVV
*CCVV
*CVC2V
*CCVC2V
*CVN
*CCVN

where C is a consonant, V is a vowel, and N is a nasal stop. There is a very limited number of consonants which can occur in the second (C2) position and only certain vowel sequences (VV and V…V) occur. The possible consonant clusters (CC) is covered above; C2 may be .

==Grammar==

Taa is a subject–verb–object language with serial verbs and inflecting prepositions. Genitives, adjectives, relative clauses, and numbers come after the nouns they apply to. Reduplication is used to form causatives. There are five nominal agreement classes and an additional two tone groups. Agreement occurs on pronouns, transitive verbs (with the object), adjectives, prepositions, and some particles.

===Numbers===
Taa has only three native numbers. All numbers above three are loans from Tswana or Kgalagadi.

<doc id="358810" wikidata="Q231620" url="?curid=358810" title="Parícutin">
<text>Parícutin (or Volcán de Parícutin, also accented Paricutín) is a cinder cone volcano located in the Mexican state of Michoacán, near the city of Uruapan and about west of Mexico City. The volcano surged suddenly from the cornfield of local farmer Dionisio Pulido in 1943, attracting both popular and scientific attention.

Parícutin presented the first occasion for modern science to document the full life cycle of an eruption of this type. During the volcano&#x27;s nine years of activity, scientists sketched and mapped it and took thousands of samples and photographs. By 1952, the eruption had left a cone and significantly damaged an area of more than with the ejection of stone, volcanic ash and lava. Three people were killed, two towns were completely evacuated and buried by lava, and three others were heavily affected. Hundreds of people had to permanently relocate, and two new towns were created to accommodate their migration. Although the larger region still remains highly active volcanically, Parícutin is now dormant and has become a tourist attraction, with people climbing the volcano and visiting the hardened lava-covered ruins of the San Juan Parangaricutiro Church.

In 1997, CNN named Parícutin one of the Seven Natural Wonders of the World. The same year, the disaster film &quot;Volcano&quot; mentioned it as a precedent for the film&#x27;s fictional events.

==Description ==

Parícutin is located in the Mexican municipality of Nuevo Parangaricutiro, Michoacán, west of the city of Uruapan and about 322 km west of Mexico City. It lies on the northern flank of Pico de Tancítaro, which itself lies on top of an old shield volcano and extends above sea level and above the Valley of Quitzocho-Cuiyusuru. These structures are wedged against old volcanic mountain chains and surrounded by small volcanic cones, with the intervening valleys occupied by small fields and orchards or small settlements, from groups of a few houses to those the size of towns.

The volcano lies on, and is a product of, the Trans-Mexican Volcanic Belt, which runs west-to-east across central Mexico. It includes the Sierra Nevada mountain range (a set of extinct volcanoes) as well as thousands of cinder cones and volcanic vents. Volcanic activity here has created the Central Mexican Plateau and rock deposits up to deep. It has also created fertile soils by the widespread deposition of ash and thereby some of Mexico&#x27;s most productive farmland. The volcanic activity here is a result of the subduction of the Rivera and Cocos plates along the Middle America Trench. More specifically, the volcano is the youngest of the approximately 1,400 volcanic vents of the Michoacán-Guanajuato volcanic field, a basalt plateau filled with scoria cones like Parícutin, along with small shield volcanoes, maars, tuff rings and lava domes. Scoria cones are the most common type of volcano in Mexico, appearing suddenly and building a cone-shaped mountain with steep slopes before becoming extinct. Parícutin&#x27;s immediate predecessor was El Jorullo, also in Michoacán, which erupted in 1759.

By 2013, the crater of the volcano was about across, and it was possible to both climb the volcano and walk around the entire perimeter. Although classified as extinct by scientists, Parícutin is still hot, and seeping rainwater reacts with this heat so that the cone still emits steam in various streams. The forces that created the volcano are still active. In 1997 there was a vigorous swarm of 230 earthquakes in the Parícutin area due to tectonic movement, with five above 3.9 on the moment magnitude scale. There were also some reports of rumbling in 1995, and of black steam and rumbling in 1998. In the summer of 2006, there was another major volcanic earthquake swarm, with over 300 located near the volcano, indicating magma movement, but with no eruption at Parícutin or elsewhere.
==Formation ==

Parícutin erupted from 1943 to 1952, unusually long for this type of volcano, and with several eruptive phases. For weeks prior, residents of the area reported hearing noises similar to thunder but without clouds in the sky. This sound is consistent with deep earthquakes caused by the movement of magma. A later study indicated that the eruption was preceded by 21 earthquakes over 3.2 in intensity starting five weeks before the eruption. One week prior to the eruption, newspapers reported 25–30 per day. The day before the eruption, the number was estimated at 300.

The eruption began on February 20, 1943, at about 4:00pm local time. The center of the activity was a cornfield owned by Dionisio Pulido, near the town of Parícutin. During that day, he and his family had been working their land, clearing it to prepare for spring planting. Suddenly the ground nearby swelled upward and formed a fissure between 2 and 2.5 meters across. They reported that they heard hissing sounds, and saw smoke which smelled like rotten eggs, indicating the presence of hydrogen sulfide. Within hours, the fissure would develop into a small crater.

Pulido reported:
He tried to find his family and oxen but they had disappeared; so he rode his horse to town where he found his family and friends, happy to see him alive. The volcano grew fast and furiously after this. Celedonio Gutierrez, who witnessed the eruption on the first night, reported: 
On that first day, the volcano had begun strombolian pyroclastic activity; and within 24 hours there was a scoria cone fifty meters high, created by the ejection of lapilli fragments up to the size of a walnut and larger, semi-molten volcanic bombs. By the end of the week, reports held that the cone was between 100 and 150 meters high. Soon after the start, the valley was covered in smoke and ash.

== Phases ==
The nine-year activity of the volcano is divided into four stages, with names that come from the Purépecha language. The first phase (&quot;Quitzocho&quot;) extended from February 22 to October 18, 1943, with activity concentrated in the cracks that formed in the Cuiyusuro Valley, forming the initial cone. During this time, the ejected material was mostly lapilli and bombs. In March, the eruption became more powerful, with eruptive columns that extended for several kilometers. In four months, the cone reached 200 meters and in eight months 365 meters. During this time period, there was some lava flow. On June 12, lava began to advance towards the village of Parícutin, forcing evacuations the next day.

The second phase went from October 18, 1943 to January 8, 1944 and is called &quot;Sapichi&quot;, meaning &quot;child&quot;, referring to the formation of a lateral vent and other openings on the north side of the cone. Ash and bombs continued to be ejected but the new vent sent lava towards the town of San Juan Parangaricutiro, forcing its permanent evacuation. By August, the town was completely covered in lava and ash, with only the upper portions of the main church still visible. The evacuations of Parícutin and San Juan were accomplished without loss of life due to the slow movement of the lava. These two phases lasted just over a year and account for more than 90% of the total material ejected from the cone, as well as almost four-fifths (330 meters) of the final height of 424 meters from the valley floor. It also sent ash as far as Mexico City.

The third (&quot;Taqué-Ahuan&quot;) lasted from January 8, 1944 to January 12, 1945 and featured mainly the formation of a series of cracks on the south side of the cone, as well as an increase in activity in the center. Lava flows from this time mostly extend to the west and northwest. During this period there also formed a mesa, now called Los Hornitos, to the south.

Over the next seven years, the volcano became less active, with the ejection of ash, stone and lava coming sporadically, with periods of silence in between. Professional geologists pulled out of the area in 1948, leaving only Celedonio Gutierrez to continue observations. The last burst of activity was recorded by him between January and February 1952. Several eruptions occurred in succession and a three-kilometer smoke column was produced.

==Scientific study==
The particular importance of the Parícutin eruption was that it was the first time that volcanologists were able to fully document the entire life cycle of a volcano. The event brought geologists from all over the world, but the principal researchers were William F. Foshag of the Smithsonian Institution and Dr. Jenaro Gonzalez Reyna from the Mexican government, who came about a month after the eruption started and stayed for several years. These two wrote detailed descriptions, drew sketches and maps, and took samples and thousands of photographs during this time. Many of these are still used today by researchers. Foshag continued to study the volcano until his death in 1956. Between 1943 and 1948, almost fifty scientific articles were published in major journals about the volcano, with even more since. The worldwide effort to study Parícutin increased understanding of volcanism in general but particularly that of scoria cone formation.

==Socioeconomic consequences ==

Despite the ongoing Second World War, the eruption drew attention from around the world, with reporters from newspapers and magazines including &quot;Life&quot; coming to cover the story. In the later years of the eruption, airline pilots pointed the volcano out to passengers. The Hollywood film, &quot;Captain from Castile&quot;, was shot in the area, using the erupting volcano as a backdrop and employing locals as extras. Some outdoor shots of the Western film, &quot;Garden of Evil &quot;, were filmed at the church ruins of Nuevo San Juan Parangaricutiro and in the village of Guanajuato with the then unrestored church ruins of the Templo Santiago Apóstol, Marfil. The eruption also inspired a generation of Mexican artists to depict or allude to it in their works, including Dr Atl, Diego Rivera, David Alfaro Siqueiros, Alfredo Zalce and Pablo O&#x27;Higgins.

The eruptions ended in 1952, leaving a final scoria cone with a height of 424 meters from the valley floor. The eruption destroyed or heavily damaged a 233 km2 area, and almost all of the vegetation within several kilometers of the crater was destroyed. The volcano spread lava over 26 km2, with 52 km2 covered in volcanic sand. The town of Parícutin, which once had a population of 733, is now completely gone, and all that remains of the town of San Juan Parangaricutiro, with a former population of 1,895, are parts of its main church which stand out among the hardened lava flow.

Though no one died directly from the eruption, three people were killed when they were struck by lightning generated by pyroclastic eruptions. The damage from the eruption primarily affected five towns in two municipalities, San Juan Parangaricutiro and Los Reyes. In addition to the two towns that were obliterated, Zacan (pop. 876), Angahuan (pop. 1,098) and Zirosto (pop. 1,314) were also heavily affected. The main effect on the people of the area was the disruption of their lives and livelihood, especially during the first two years. The area most affected by the eruption had a population of 5,910, and hundreds among these were permanently evacuated. Before leaving his home for the last time, Dionisio Pulido placed a sign on the cornfield that read in Spanish: &quot;This volcano is owned and operated by Dionisio Pulido.&quot; The populations of the two destroyed towns were initially moved to camps on either side of the city of Uruapan. The population of the other three towns mostly stayed in place, but made adaptations to survive during the eruption. People of Angahuan and Zacan mostly stayed where they were. The population of Zirosto divided into three: those that stayed in the original location, now known as Zirosto Viejo; those who moved a few miles away to a ranch which is now officially called Zirosto Nuevo but locally called Barranca Seca; and a third group who founded a completely new settlement called Miguel Silva near Ario de Rosales.

The town of San Juan Parangaricutiro was the seat of the municipality of the same name, and its destruction prompted a political reorganization and a new seat at Parangaricutiro (today generally called San Juan Nuevo), where much of the population of the old seat had been relocated, with some going to Angahuan.

The economy of the area was then and is now mostly agricultural, with a mostly Purépecha population, rural and poor. However, the eruption did cause a number of changes both social and economic to the affected areas, both to adapt to the changed landscape but also because the fame of the eruption has brought greater contact from the rest of Mexico and beyond.

The volcano has become a tourist attraction, with the main access in Angahuan, from which the volcano is clearly visible. The town offers guides and horses, both to visit the ruins of the San Juan Parangaricutiro Church as well as to climb the volcano itself. The volcano is part of the Pico de Tancítaro National Park and is mostly accessible on horseback, with only the last few hundred, very steep, meters to be climbed on foot. The trek requires a guide even if horses are not used, as the path is not well-marked and passes through forest, agave fields and avocado groves. Many simply visit the ruins of the church, which are easier to access and still a pilgrimage site, the old altar regularly adorned with fresh candles and flowers. Nearby is a group of stands selling local food and souvenirs.

The story of the formation of Parícutin is the subject of the children&#x27;s book &quot;Hill of Fire&quot; by Thomas P. Lewis, published in 1983. The book was featured in an episode of &quot;Reading Rainbow&quot; in 1985.

<text>Catharine Esther Beecher (September 6, 1800 – May 12, 1878) was an American educator known for her forthright opinions on female education as well as her vehement support of the many benefits of the incorporation of kindergarten into children&#x27;s education. She published the advice manual &quot;The American Woman&#x27;s Home&quot; with her sister Harriet Beecher Stowe in 1869. Some sources spell her first name as &quot;Catherine&quot;.

==Biography==

===Early life and education===

Beecher was born September 6, 1800, in East Hampton, New York, the daughter of minister and religious leader Lyman Beecher and Roxana (Foote) Beecher. Among her siblings were writer and abolitionist Harriet Beecher Stowe, along with clergymen Henry Ward Beecher and Charles Beecher. Beecher was educated at home until she was ten years old, when she was sent to Litchfield Female Academy in Litchfield, Connecticut. She taught herself subjects not commonly offered to women, including math, Latin, and philosophy. She took over the domestic duties of her household at the age of 16, following her mother&#x27;s death. In 1821, Beecher founded a school for women in New Haven, Connecticut. Catharine was engaged to marry Alexander M. Fisher, head of the Mathematics Department at Yale College, but he died at sea before the wedding took place. She never married.

===Female seminary===
To provide educational opportunities for others, in 1823 Beecher and her sister, Mary Foote Beecher Perkins, co-founded the Hartford Female Seminary in Hartford, Connecticut, where she taught until 1832. The private girls&#x27; school had many well-known alumnae.

Comprehending the deficiencies of existing textbooks, she prepared, primarily for use in her own school, some elementary books in arithmetic, a work on theology, and one on mental and moral philosophy. The last was never published, although printed and used as a college textbook.

She was constantly making experiments, and practicing them upon the girls, weighing all their food before they ate it, holding that Graham flour and the Graham diet were better for them than richer food. Ten of her pupils invited her to dine with them at a restaurant. She accepted the invitation, and the excellent dinner changed her views. Thereafter they were served with more palatable food.

=== Opposition to Indian Removal Bill ===
In 1829 and 1830, Beecher led a women&#x27;s movement to protest the Indian Removal Bill of President Andrew Jackson. The protest was the first national campaign on the part of women in the United States.

In the bill, Jackson requested that Congress approve the use of federal money to resettle southeastern American Indians, including the Cherokee, to land west of the Mississippi River. In response, Beecher published a &quot;Circular Addressed to the Benevolent Ladies of the U. States&quot;, dated December 25, 1829, calling on women to send petitions to Congress protesting the removal. In the circular, she wrote, &quot;It has become almost a certainty that these people are to have their lands torn from them, and to be driven into western wilds and to final annihilation, unless the feelings of a humane and Christian nation shall be aroused to prevent the unhallowed sacrifice.&quot;

Congress nevertheless passed the bill, and the Indian Removal Act became law on May 28, 1830.

===Midlife in the West===
In 1832, Beecher moved with her father to Walnut Hills, Cincinnati, where he became head of the new Lane Seminary, to campaign for more schools and teachers in the frontier. There she opened a female seminary, which, on account of her failing health, was discontinued after two years. She then devoted herself to the development of an extended plan for the physical, social, intellectual, and moral education of women, to be promoted through a national board. For nearly 40 years, she labored perseveringly in this work, organizing societies for training teachers, establishing plans for supplying the territories with good educators, writing, pleading, and traveling. Her object, as she described it, was &quot;to unite American women in an effort to provide a Christian education for 2,000,000 children in our country.&quot; She made her field of labor especially in the West and South, and sought the aid of educated women throughout the United States.

===Later life and death===
In 1837, Beecher retired from administrative work. After returning East she started the Ladies&#x27; Society for Promoting Education in the West. In 1847 she co-founded the Board of National Popular Education with William Slade, a former Congressman and then governor of Vermont. In 1852 she founded the American Women&#x27;s Educational Association. Their goal was to recruit and train teachers for frontier schools and send women into the West to civilize the young. Their efforts became a model for future schools developed in the West.

It was claimed that hundreds of the best teachers the West received were sent under the patronage of this system. To a certain extent the plans succeeded, and were found beneficial, but the careers of the teachers were mostly short, for they soon married.

In &quot;The American Woman&#x27;s Home&quot;, published in 1869, Beecher and her sister presented a model home from a woman&#x27;s perspective. The kitchen was inspired by a cook&#x27;s galley in a steamship. A movable partition on wheels provided flexibility and privacy in the small home, and also served as a wardrobe. Chapters of the book discussing ventilation and heating anticipated modern central heating.

On May 12, 1878, Beecher died from apoplexy.

==Views on and advocacy of education==
In 1841 Beecher published &quot;A Treatise on Domestic Economy for the Use of Young Ladies at Home and at School&quot;, a book that discussed the underestimated importance of women&#x27;s roles in society. The book was edited and re-released the following year in its final form. Catharine Beecher was a strong advocate of the inclusion of daily physical education in women&#x27;s schooling, and developed a program of calisthenics performed to music.
In 1831, Catharine Beecher suggested that teachers read aloud to students from passages by writers with elegant styles, &quot;to accustom the ear to the measurement of the sentences and the peculiar turns of expression&quot;.
She went on to have the students imitate the piece just read using similar words, style, and turns of phrase in order to develop &quot;a ready command of the language and easy modes of expression&quot;. In 1846, Beecher pronounced that women, not men, should educate children, and established schools for training teachers in Western cities. She advocated that young ladies find godly work as Christian teachers away from the larger Eastern cities. The Board of National Popular Education, which was her idea, trained teachers in four-week sessions in Connecticut and then sent them out West. She believed that women had a higher calling to shape children and society. Along with a &quot;Treatise on Domestic Economy for the Use of Young Ladies at Home and at School,&quot; Beecher also published &quot;The Duty of American Women to Their Country&quot; in 1845 and &quot;The Domestic Receipt Book&quot; in 1846. Beecher&#x27;s views on education and women&#x27;s work were also somewhat contradictory. She believed in the preparedness of female teachers to aid in their teaching of children from unfortunate homes. At the same time, she worked to teach mothers how to care for their families. The education of females to be teachers of troubled children and also homemakers who care for and teach their families are at a counterbalance. Beecher did a lot of work as a writer to educate the general public. Beecher laid the groundwork for a lot of future Family and Consumer Science Education. Many of her books like the Domestic Receipt Book helped people to learn how to manage their household budgets with ease. 

===Views on education===
Beecher recognized public schools&#x27; responsibility to influence the moral, physical, and intellectual development of children. She promoted the expansion and development of teacher training programs, holding that teaching was more important to society than lawyers or doctors. Beecher was a strong advocate of the inclusion of daily physical education, and developed a program of calisthenics that was performed to music. She also firmly believed in the benefits of reading aloud. Catherine Beecher believed that tight corsets and bad eating habits ruined the young women&#x27;s health. She believed the primary purpose of education was to develop a young child&#x27;s basis for their conscience and morals.

===Women as educators===
Beecher believed that women have inherent qualities that make them the preferred gender as teachers. As men left teaching to pursue business and industry, she saw the untapped potential of educated women and encouraged education of women to fill the increasing need for teachers. She considered women natural teachers, with teaching as an extension of their domestic role.

==Influential changes over time==

In 1862, John Brinsley recommended that students analyze and imitate classical Greek and Latin models, while Beecher recommended English writers. They both believed that frequent practice and the study of important authors helped students acquire writing skills.

Beecher founded The American Woman&#x27;s Educational Association in 1852, an organization focused on furthering educational opportunities for women. She also founded the Western Female Institute in Cincinnati (along with her father Lyman) and The Ladies Society for Promoting Education in the West. She was also instrumental in the establishment of women&#x27;s colleges in Burlington, Iowa; Quincy, Illinois; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin.

Beecher strongly supported allowing children to simply be children and not prematurely forcing adulthood onto them. She believed that children lacked the experience needed to make important life decisions and that in order for them to become healthy self-sufficient adults, they needed to be allowed to express themselves freely in an environment suited to children. It was these beliefs that led to her support of a system of kindergartens.

===Anti-suffragist===
Beecher thought that women could best influence society as mothers and teachers, and did not want women to be corrupted by the evils of politics. She felt that men and women were put on the earth for separate reasons and accepted the view that women should not be involved in politics, but rather, they would teach male children to be free thinkers and moral learners and help shape their political ideas. (See Culture of Domesticity.)

==Legacy==
Three universities named buildings for Beecher: Central Connecticut State University, The University of Connecticut, and The University of Cincinnati. The Cincinnati building has since been demolished.

==Schools==
*1823: Hartford Female Seminary: Beecher co-founded the Hartford Female Seminary, which was a school to train women to be mothers and teachers. It began with one room and seven students; within three years, it grew to almost 100 students, with 10 rooms and 8 teachers. The school had small class sizes, where advanced students taught other students. All classes were connected to general principles, and students were motivated to go beyond the classes&#x27; texts and instruction.
*1832: Western Female Institute
*1852: The Ladies Society for Promoting Education in the West founded colleges in Burlington, Iowa; Quincy, Illinois; and Milwaukee, Wisconsin. The Milwaukee Female College changed names several times. Today, as Downer College of Lawrence University of Appleton WI, it is the longest continuously operating college for women&#x27;s higher education founded on the Beecher plan.

<text>The United States Mint is a bureau of the Department of the Treasury responsible for producing coinage for the United States to conduct its trade and commerce, as well as controlling the movement of bullion. The U.S. Mint is one of two U.S. agencies that manufactures physical money. The other is the Bureau of Engraving and Printing, which prints paper currency. The first United States Mint was created in Philadelphia in 1792, and soon joined by other centers, whose coins were identified by their own mint marks. There are currently four active coin-producing mints: Philadelphia, Denver, San Francisco, and West Point.

==History==

The first authorization for the establishment of a mint in the United States was in a resolution of the Congress of the Confederation of February 21, 1782, and the first general-circulation coin of the United States, the Fugio cent, was produced in 1787 based on the Continental dollar.

The current United States Mint was created by Congress with the Coinage Act of 1792, and originally placed within the Department of State. Per the terms of the Coinage Act, the first Mint building was in Philadelphia, which was then the capital of the United States; it was the first building of the United States raised under the Constitution. The mint&#x27;s headquarters is a non-coin-producing facility in Washington D.C. It operates mint facilities in Philadelphia, Denver, San Francisco, and West Point, New York, and a bullion depository at Fort Knox, Kentucky. Official Mints (Branches) were once also located in Carson City, Nevada; Charlotte, North Carolina; Dahlonega, Georgia; New Orleans, Louisiana; and in Manila, in the Philippines.

Originally part of the State Department, the Mint was made an independent agency in 1799. It converted precious metals into standard coin for anyone&#x27;s account with no seigniorage charge beyond the refining costs. Under the Coinage Act of 1873, the Mint became part of the Department of the Treasury. It was placed under the auspices of the Treasurer of the United States in 1981. Legal tender coins of today are minted solely for the Treasury&#x27;s account.
The first Director of the United States Mint was renowned scientist David Rittenhouse from 1792 to 1795. The position is currently filled by Ventris Gibson. Henry Voigt was the first Superintendent and Chief Coiner, and is credited with some of the first U.S. coin designs. Another important position at the Mint is that of Chief Engraver, which has been held by such men as Frank Gasparro, William Barber, Charles E. Barber, James B. Longacre, and Christian Gobrecht.
The Mint has operated several branch facilities throughout the United States since the Philadelphia Mint opened in 1792, in a building known as &quot;Ye Olde Mint&quot;. With the opening of branch mints came the need for mint marks, an identifying feature on the coin to show its facility of origin. The first of these branch mints were the Charlotte, North Carolina (1838–1861), Dahlonega, Georgia (1838–1861), and New Orleans, Louisiana (1838–1909) branches. Both the Charlotte (C mint mark) and Dahlonega (D mint mark) Mints were opened to facilitate the conversion of local gold deposits into coinage, and minted only gold coins. The Civil War closed both these facilities permanently. The New Orleans Mint (O mint mark) closed at the beginning of the Civil War (1861) and did not re-open until the end of Reconstruction in 1879. During its two stints as a minting facility, it produced both gold and silver coinage in eleven different denominations, though only ten denominations were ever minted there at one time (in 1851 silver three-cent pieces, half dimes, dimes, quarters, half dollars, and gold dollars, Quarter Eagles, half eagles, eagles, and double eagles).

A new branch facility was opened in Carson City, Nevada, in 1870; it operated until 1893, with a three-year hiatus from 1886 to 1888. Like the Charlotte and Dahlonega branches, the Carson City Mint (CC mint mark) was opened to take advantage of local precious metal deposits, in this case, a large vein of silver. Though gold coins were also produced there, no base metal coins were.

In 1911 the Mint had a female acting director, Margaret Kelly, at that point the highest paid woman on the government&#x27;s payroll. She stated that women were paid equally within the bureau.

A branch of the U.S. mint (Manila Mint) was established in 1920 in Manila in the Philippines, which was then a U.S. territory. To date, the Manila Mint is the only U.S. mint established outside the continental U.S. and was responsible for producing coins (one, five, ten, twenty and fifty centavo denominations). This branch was in production from 1920 to 1922, and then again from 1925 through 1941. Coins struck by this mint bear either the M mintmark (for Manila) or none at all, similar to the Philadelphia mint at the time.

A branch mint in The Dalles, Oregon, was commissioned in 1864. Construction was halted in 1870, and the facility never produced any coins, although the building still stands.

==Current facilities==

There are four active coin-producing mints: Philadelphia, Denver, San Francisco, and West Point.

===Philadelphia===

The Mint&#x27;s largest facility is the Philadelphia Mint. The current facility, which opened in 1969, is the fourth Philadelphia Mint. The first was built in 1792, when Philadelphia was still the U.S. capital, and began operation in 1793. Until 1980, coins minted at Philadelphia bore no mint mark, with the exceptions of the Susan B. Anthony dollar and the wartime Jefferson nickel. In 1980, the P mint mark was added to all U.S. coinage except the cent. Until 1968, the Philadelphia Mint was responsible for nearly all official proof coinage. Philadelphia is also the site of master die production for U.S. coinage, and the engraving and design departments of the Mint are also located there.

===Denver===

The Denver Mint began in 1863 as the local assay office, just five years after gold was discovered in the area. By the turn of the century, the office was bringing in over $5 million in annual gold and silver deposits, and in 1906, the Mint opened its new Denver branch. Denver uses a D mint mark and strikes mostly circulation coinage, although it has struck commemorative coins in the past, such as the $10 gold 1984 Los Angeles Olympic Commemorative. It also produces its own working dies, as well as working dies for the other mints. Although the Denver and Dahlonega mints used the same mint mark D, they were never in operation at the same time, so this is not a source of ambiguity.

===San Francisco===

The San Francisco branch, opened in 1854 to serve the goldfields of the California Gold Rush, uses an S mint mark. It quickly outgrew its first building and moved into a new facility in 1874. This building, one of the few that survived the great earthquake and fire of 1906, served until 1937, when the present facility was opened. It was closed in 1955, then reopened a decade later during the coin shortage of the mid-60s. In 1968, it took over most proof-coinage production from Philadelphia, and since 1975, it has been used almost exclusively for proof coinage, with the exceptions of the Anthony dollar (1979–1981), a portion of the mintage of cents in the early 1980s, (these cents are indistinguishable from those minted at Philadelphia), and a small portion of America the Beautiful quarters minted in circulation-quality (but not issued for circulation) since 2012.

===West Point===
The West Point branch is the newest mint facility, gaining official status as a branch mint in 1988. Its predecessor, the West Point Bullion Depository, was opened in 1938, and cents were produced there from 1973 to 1986. Along with these, which were identical to those produced at Philadelphia, West Point has struck a great deal of commemorative and proof coinage bearing the W mint mark. In 1996, West Point produced clad dimes, but for collectors, not for circulation. The West Point facility is still used for storage of part of the United States&#x27; gold bullion reserves, and West Point is now the United States&#x27; production facility for gold, silver, platinum, and palladium American Eagle coins. In 2019, West Point produced limited quantities of circulating quarters bearing the &quot;W&quot; mint mark for the first time.

===Fort Knox===
While not a coin production facility, the U.S. Bullion Depository at Fort Knox, Kentucky, is another facility of the Mint. Its primary purpose is for storage of the United States and other countries&#x27; gold and silver bullion reserves.

=== The US Mint&#x27;s Gold Depositories ===
The US Treasury owns 8133.5 tonnes of gold, 7628 tonnes of which is stored in US Mint storage facilities, namely, 4582 tonnes (147.3 million troy ozs) in the US Bullion Depository in Fort Knox, Kentucky, 1682 tonnes (54.1 million troy ozs) in the West Point bullion storage facility in upstate New York, and 1364 tonnes (43.8 million troy ozs) in the US Mint facility in Denver, Colorado.

==Functions==

The Mint manages extensive commercial marketing programs. The product line includes special coin sets for collectors, national medals, American Eagle gold, silver and platinum bullion coins, and commemorative coins marking national events such as the Bicentennial of the Constitution. The Mint&#x27;s functions include:

* Producing domestic, bullion and foreign coins;
* Manufacturing and selling national commemorative medals;
* Designing and producing the congressional gold medals;
* Designing, producing, and marketing special coinage;
* Safeguarding and controlling the movement of bullion;
* Disbursing gold and silver for authorized purposes;
* Distributing coins from the various mints to Federal Reserve Banks.

The Mint is not responsible for the production of American paper money; that is the responsibility of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing.

In 2000, the Mint was responsible for the production of 28 billion coins. See United States Mint coin production for annual production values of each coin.

The United States Mint Police, a federal law enforcement agency, is responsible for the protection of Mint facilities, employees and reserves.

The production and sale of circulating coinage and the other functions of the Mint are funded through the United States Mint Public Enterprise Fund, established in 1995. Any profits made by the Fund in excess of operating requirements are returned to the Treasury. Government procurement regulations do not apply to the Mint&#x27;s procurement and contracting activity.

== Branches ==
== Mintmarks ==
With the exception of a brief period in 1838 and 1839, all coins minted at U.S. branch mints prior to 1908 displayed that branch&#x27;s mintmark on their reverse. Larger denominations of gold and silver coins were labeled with the Dahlonega, Charlotte, and New Orleans mintmarks (D, C, and O, respectively) on the obverse (front) side, just above the dates, in those two years. Carson City, which served as a U.S. branch mint from 1870 to 1893, produced coins with a CC mintmark. The Manila Mint (the only overseas U.S. mint, which produced U.S. Territorial and U.S. Commonwealth coinage) used the M mintmark from 1920 to 1941.

Between 1965 and 1967, as the Mint labored to replace the silver coinage with base metal coins, mintmarks were temporarily dispensed with (including on the penny and nickel) in order to discourage the hoarding of coins by numismatists. Mintmarks were moved to the obverse of the nickel, dime, quarter, and half dollar in 1968, and have appeared on the obverse of the dollar coin since its re-introduction in 1971.

* Penny: Unlike all other coins, which had their mintmarks on the reverse until 1964, the Lincoln cent has always had its mintmark on the obverse below the date to the right of Lincoln&#x27;s bust since its 1909 introduction.
* Nickel: The mintmark was located near the rim of the obverse side, clockwise from the date from 1968 to 2005, to the right of Thomas Jefferson&#x27;s bust. The redesigned obverse of the nickel which appeared starting in 2006 has its mintmark below the date on the lower right. Many earlier nickels from 1938 to 1964 are still in circulation, and their mintmarks can be found on the reverse to the right of Monticello, with the exception of the 1942–1945 war nickels cited elsewhere in this article.
* Dime: The mintmark is above the date on the obverse side to the right of Franklin D. Roosevelt&#x27;s bust.
* Quarter dollar: The mintmark is to the right of George Washington&#x27;s bust.
* Half dollar: The mintmark is below the center of John F. Kennedy&#x27;s bust, above the date.
* Eisenhower Dollar (1971–1978): The mintmark is below the center of Dwight D. Eisenhower&#x27;s bust, above the date.
* Susan B. Anthony dollar (1979–1981, 1999): The mintmark is found to the left of Susan B. Anthony&#x27;s bust.
* Sacagawea dollar (2000–present): For coins minted from 2000 to 2008, the mintmark is just below the date. For coins minted since 2009, the date, mintmark and &quot;E Pluribus Unum&quot; were moved to the edge of the coin.
* Presidential dollar (2007–2016): The mintmark and date are found on the edge of the coin.
*American Innovation dollar (2018–present): The mintmark and date are found on the edge of the coin.
Due to a shortage of nickel during World War II, the composition of the five-cent coin was changed to include silver. To mark this change, nickels minted in Philadelphia (which had featured no mintmarks until then) displayed a P in the field above the dome of Monticello. Nickels from San Francisco were minted in the same fashion, and Denver nickels reflected the change in 1943. This new mintmark location continued until 1946 when the nickel returned to its pre-war composition.

The P mintmark, discontinued after the war, reappeared in 1979 on the Anthony dollar. By 1982, it had appeared on every other regular-issue coin except the cent, which, with the exception of 2017 Lincoln Cents, still bears no P mintmark. The circulating cents struck in the 1980s at San Francisco (except proofs) and West Point also bears no mintmark, as their facilities were used to supplement Philadelphia&#x27;s production. Given the limited numbers produced at each facility, they might have been hoarded as collectibles.

For 2017, in commemoration of the U.S Mint&#x27;s 225th Anniversary, the P mintmark was placed on the obverse of Philadelphia-minted Lincoln cents for the first time in the coin&#x27;s 100+ year history. The P mintmark did not re-appear for 2018 and subsequent circulation strikes minted in Philadelphia.

<doc id="358820" wikidata="Q328092" url="?curid=358820" title="Cornice">
<text>In architecture, a cornice (from the Italian &quot;cornice&quot; meaning &quot;ledge&quot;) is generally any horizontal decorative moulding that crowns a building or furniture element—for example, the cornice over a door or window, around the top edge of a pedestal, or along the top of an interior wall. A simple cornice may be formed with a crown, as in crown moulding atop an interior wall or above kitchen cabinets or a bookcase.

A projecting cornice on a building has the function of throwing rainwater free of its walls. In residential building practice, this function is handled by projecting gable ends, roof eaves, and gutters. However, house eaves may also be called &quot;cornices&quot; if they are finished with decorative moulding. In this sense, while most cornices are also eaves (overhanging the sides of the building), not all eaves are usually considered cornices. Eaves are primarily functional and not necessarily decorative, while cornices have a decorative aspect.

A building&#x27;s projecting cornice may appear to be heavy and hence in danger of falling, particularly on commercial buildings, but it often is actually very light and made of pressed metal.

==In classical architecture==

In Ancient Greek architecture and its successors using the classical orders in the tradition of classical architecture, the cornice is the topmost element of the entablature, which consists (from top to bottom) of the cornice, the frieze, and the architrave.

Where a triangular pediment is above the entablature, the cornice continues all round the triangle, the two sides being &quot;raking cornices&quot;. The vertical space below the cornice is typically decorated by dentils (little teeth) or the larger modillions. The soffit, or horizontal space under a projecting cornice, may be elaborately carved with vegetal designs.

==In modern residential architecture==
=== Rake===
A &quot;rake&quot; is an architectural term for an eave or cornice that runs along the gable of the roof of a modern residential structure. It may also be called a &quot;sloping cornice&quot;, a &quot;raking cornice&quot;. The trim and rafters at this edge are called &quot;rakes&quot;, &quot;rake board&quot;, &quot;rake fascia&quot;, &quot;verge-boards&quot;, &quot;barge-boards&quot; or &quot;verge-&quot; or &quot;barge-rafters&quot;. It is a sloped timber on the outside facing edge of a roof running between the ridge and the eave. On a typical house, any gable will have two rakes, one on each sloped side. The rakes are often supported by a series of lookouts (sometimes also called &quot;strong arms&quot;) and may be trimmed with a &quot;rake fascia&quot; board (which is not a true fascia) on the outside facing edge and a &quot;rake soffit&quot; along the bottom.

===Types===
The cornices of a modern residential building will usually be one of three types: a &quot;box&quot; cornice, a &quot;close&quot; or &quot;closed&quot; cornice, or an &quot;open&quot; cornice.

====Box cornice====

Box cornices enclose the cornice of the building with what is essentially a long, narrow box. A box cornice may further be divided into either the &quot;narrow&quot; box cornice or the &quot;wide&quot; box cornice type. A narrow box cornice is one in which &quot;the projection of the rafter serves as a nailing surface for the soffit board as well as the fascia trim.&quot; This is possible if the slope of the roof is fairly steep and the width of the eave relatively narrow. A wide box cornice, a common practice on houses with gentle roof slopes and wide eaves, requires lookouts to support it and provide a surface to attach the soffits securely. Box cornices often have ventilation screens laid over openings cut in the soffits to allow air to circulate within the cornice.

====Close cornice====

A closed or snub cornice is one in which there is no projection of the rafters beyond the walls of the building and, therefore, no soffit or fascia. This type of cornice is easy to construct but provides little aid in dispersing water away from the building and is sometimes considered to lack aesthetic value.

====Open cornice====

In an open cornice, the shape of the cornice is similar to that of a wide box cornice, except that both the lookouts and the soffit are absent. It is a lower-cost treatment that requires fewer materials and may even have no fascia board, but it lacks the finished appearance of a box cornice.

====Cavetto cornice====

Ancient Egyptian architectural tradition made special use of large cavetto mouldings as a cornice, with only a short fillet (plain vertical face) above, and a torus moulding (convex semi-circle) below. This cavetto cornice is sometimes also known as an &quot;Egyptian cornice&quot;, &quot;hollow and roll&quot; or &quot;gorge cornice&quot;. It has been suggested to be a reminiscence in stone architecture of the primitive use of bound bunches of reeds as supports for buildings, the weight of the roof bending their tops out.

The cavetto cornice, often forming less than a quarter-circle, influenced Egypt&#x27;s neighbours and as well as appearing in early Ancient Greek architecture, it is seen in Syria and ancient Iran, for example at the Tachara palace of Darius I at Persepolis, completed in 486 BC. Inspired by this precedent, it was then revived by Ardashir I (r. 224–41 AD), the founder of the Sasanian dynasty.

The cavetto took the place of the cymatium in many Etruscan temples, often painted with vertical &quot;tongue&quot; patterns, and combined with the distinctive &quot;Etruscan round moulding&quot;, often painted with scales. A typical example may be seen at the reconstructed Etruscan temple at Villa Giulia.

Additional more obscure varieties of cornice include the &quot;architrave&quot; cornice, &quot;bracketed&quot; cornice, and &quot;modillion&quot; cornice.

===Cornice return===

A &quot;cornice return&quot; is an architectural detail that occurs where a roof&#x27;s horizontal cornice connects to a gable&#x27;s rake. It is a short horizontal extension of the cornice that occurs on each side of the gable end of the building (see picture of Härnösands rådhus with two of these). The two most common types of cornice return are the &quot;Greek return&quot; and the &quot;soffit return&quot; (also called a &quot;boxed&quot; or &quot;box&quot; soffit return). The former includes a sloped hip shape on the inside of the cornice under the eaves, which is sheathed or shingled like the rest of the roof above it and is considered very attractive; the latter is a simple return without these features.

==As window treatment==

The term cornice may also be used to describe a form of hard window treatment along the top edge of a window. In this context, a cornice represents a board (usually wood) placed above the window to conceal the mechanism for opening and closing drapes. If covered in a layer of cloth and given padding, it is sometimes called a soft cornice rather than a hard cornice.

<text>The Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering is the engineering school of the University of Toronto, a public research university in Toronto, Ontario, Canada. It was founded in 1873 and currently is housed in 15 facilities on the southern side of St. George Campus and 3 building located across downtown Toronto. The faculty offers undergraduate, master&#x27;s, and doctoral degrees in engineering sciences and has a partnership with the Rotman School of Management for a dual-degree program.

Within the university, it is known by the nickname of &quot;Skule&quot; and has the oldest university engineering society in Canada.

==History==

The School of Practical Science (SPS) was created in 1873 by an act of the Legislative Assembly of Ontario. The school was to serve the needs of a growing economy at a time marked by rapidly evolving sciences and technologies. In 1878, the school enrolled its first class for a three-year curriculum in the subjects of mining, engineering, mechanics and manufacturing.

The school was established as an affiliate of the University of Toronto, but operated as a separate institution. The first classes were held in a red-brick building that was known as the &quot;Little Red Skulehouse&quot; by attending students.

The school was renamed as the Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering on June 20, 1906, when it officially became part of the university.

In 1949, the University of Toronto Institute for Aerospace Studies opened for graduate studies and research in aeronautical and space sciences.

In 1962, the Institute of Biomedical Electronics (now Institute of Biomedical Engineering) was established for graduate studies. The original Skulehouse was finally demolished in 1966, by which time the faculty had already expanded to occupy a dozen other buildings that formed an engineering precinct in the southern part of campus.

The Bahen Centre for Information Technology was completed in 2002 to meet the growing needs of the university’s computer science and electrical and computer engineering programs. Designed by Diamond Schmitt Architects, the $111 million facility contains 20,000 gross square metres and is named for John Bahen, the president of Peter Kiewit and Sons. The centre was described by &quot;Canadian Architect&quot; magazine as &quot;a complex interweaving of urbanity, public space and sustainability&quot;, and it won the Ontario Association of Architects Award, the City of Toronto Architecture and Urban Design Award, and bronze in the environmental category of the National Post Design Exchange Award.

==Academics==

The Faculty of Applied Science and Engineering offers undergraduate and graduate degrees from the University of Toronto. As of the 2022–2023 academic year, there are 5,628 undergraduate students and 3,011 graduate students enrolled in the faculty, and over 50,000 living alumni worldwide.

The undergraduate programs are conducted by the departments of chemical, civil, computer, electrical, industrial, materials, mechanical, and mineral engineering. The faculty awards Bachelor of Applied Science (BASc) degrees for all undergraduate engineering programs, with the exception of the Engineering Science program, in which a Bachelor of Applied Science in Engineering Science is awarded. The faculty also offers graduate degrees. The Master of Engineering (MEng) degree consists of 1 year of full-time study, primarily requiring the completion of coursework and/or a major project. The Master of Applied Science (MASc) degree consists of 2 years of full-time study, and requires the completion of course work and a major thesis. Unlike the MASc, which leads to a PhD degree, the MEng is a terminal degree.

Courses in several majors overlap: the electrical engineering curriculum shares courses with the computer engineering curriculum in the first two years, while chemical engineering shares a set of courses with the environmental engineering option of the civil engineering department. The undergraduate engineering science program consists of courses from a broad range of departments and places greater emphasis on theory than in a traditional engineering curriculum. In the final two years of the program, each student specializes in one of several concentration options, including biomedical engineering, aerospace engineering, and machine learning.

The faculty requires undergraduate students to accumulate 600 hours of engineering work experience, commonly obtained through employment in between academic terms. Students may also choose to participate in a paid internship program called the Professional Experience Year, which involves employment at an engineering company for a period of 12 to 16 months. The Jeffrey Skoll program allows engineering students to earn a bachelor&#x27;s degree in engineering from the faculty followed by a Master of Business Administration degree from the Rotman School of Management.

Admissions standards are specific to each department, and the faculty had an entry average of 96.0% in 2022. Due to grade inflation, entry averages have been increasing over time.

The collaboration is a joint venture across U of T&#x27;s Faculties of Applied Science &amp; Engineering and Medicine.

==Traditions and student life==

Founded in 1885, The University of Toronto Engineering Society is the oldest engineering society in Canada, comprising all undergraduate students in the faculty, and serving as its student government. The Society has been the trademark holder for the &quot;Skule&quot; nickname since 1984. Usage of the nickname began in the founding years of the School of Practical Science, when students used &quot;skule&quot; as a deliberate misspelling of &quot;school&quot;.

The Skule mascot is known as the Ye Olde Mighty Skule Cannon, which began as a cannon stolen from in front of the Parliament Buildings in the fall of 1898, and has since been rebuilt in several incarnations. Students serving as &quot;Cannon Guards&quot; are led by a &quot;Chief Attiliator&quot; to protect the Cannon, which has been historically a target for attempted theft by other engineering schools. The Cannon is often fired (empty-shelled) during orientation events, and can also be heard during various events promoting Skule Spirit.

In September 2021, the University of Toronto Engineering Society, in partnership with the Faculty of Applied Science &amp; Engineering, launched a Skule Mental Health Bursary, to provide access to mental health and wellness support for Engineering undergraduate students who are in need of financial aid.

===Social events===

The Skule Orchestra, founded in 2006, is a full symphonic orchestra of engineering students. It organizes Moment, the Valentine&#x27;s Ball. Every year the Skule Choir, led by Malcolm McGrath, puts on a Christmas concert, usually located in Knox College Chapel with Malcolm McGrath on the main pipe organ and the Skule Brass Quintet.

The Lady Godiva Memorial Bnad and &quot;White Noise Brigade&quot; draws its name from the Godiva tradition. Like several other universities, Skule students frequently sing Godiva&#x27;s Hymn (or the Engineer&#x27;s Hymn) and revere Lady Godiva. The first week of classes in January following Christmas holidays is designated Godiva Week, and features numerous events, competitions and activities.

The Skule community hosts events, parties, activities, inter-faculty sports, a yearly musical production entitled Skule Nite and special interest lectures throughout the year.

===Toike Oike===
The phrase &quot;Toike Oike&quot;, variously pronounced &quot;toy-kee-oyk&quot; or &quot;toyk-oyk&quot;, is derived from an Irish janitor named Graham who was employed in the original School of Practical Science building. When students worked late in the labs and he had to close up the building, he would tell them to &quot;take a hike&quot;, which sounded like &quot;toike oike&quot; due to his Irish accent. The phrase is used as the name of the engineering society&#x27;s humour newspaper, the &quot;Toike Oike&quot;, in print since 1911. At some points in its publishing history, the humour could be extremely sexual and misogynistic, especially given the predominant male enrollment. One of the more popular editions was a parody of the popular movie Star Wars, rebranded Star Whores. Because of its huge popularity on campuses, copies had to be gotten the day of publication, and would be sold out the next day.

It is also the inspiration for the lyrics of the Skule Yell, the cheer of the engineering society and likely the oldest surviving Skule tradition:

:Toike Oike! Toike Oike!
:Ollum te Chollum te Chay!
:Skule of Science, Skule of Science
:Hurray! Hurray! Hurray!
:We Are (we are!), We Are (we are!), We Are the Engineers!
:We Can (we can!), We Can (we can!), Demolish Forty Beers!
:Drink Rum (straight!) Rum (straight!) And Come Along With Us,
:For We Don’t Give a Damn For Any Damn Man Who Don’t Give a Damn For Us!
:Yaaaay Skule!

The Brute Force Committee: Needs identification of its role in Skule. It was an organization which was Skule’s cultural leadership.

Before the adoption of the Skule Yell, the original cheer was significantly shorter:

:Who are we? Can’t you guess?
:We are from the S.P.S.
:S-C-H-O-O-L!!

Both Skule and the rest of the university recognized the original cheer as inadequate, so the first four lines of the new yell were proposed by A. G. Piper and adopted in 1897. The new yell was first performed that year at Theatre Night, a major campus-wide event for all faculties held on Halloween. The last four lines of the yell are essentially the chorus of Godiva&#x27;s Hymn, and were first added on November 25, 1905, during the procession from Rosedale Field to the King Edward Hotel following a victory of the Toronto Varsity Blues rugby team over the Ottawa Rough Riders. During the game, Casey Baldwin, a Skuleman, had made a spectacular play in the last minutes to win the dominion championship for the university.

<doc id="358832" wikidata="Q5720137" url="?curid=358832" title="Henry Daglish">
<text>Henry Daglish (18 November 1866 – 16 August 1920) was an Australian politician who was the sixth premier of Western Australia and the first from the Labor Party, serving from 10 August 1904 to 25 August 1905. Daglish was born in Ballarat, Victoria, and studied at the University of Melbourne. In 1882, he worked as a mechanical engineer but soon switched to working in the Victorian public service. He first stood for election in 1896 but failed to win the Victorian Legislative Assembly seat of Melbourne South. He then moved to Subiaco, Western Australia, where he found work as a chief clerk in the Western Australian Police Department. In 1900, Daglish was elected to the Subiaco Municipal Council and in April the following year, he was elected to the Western Australian Legislative Assembly as the member for the newly created seat of Subiaco, becoming one of six Labor members in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. The party elected him as its whip, and he resigned from the Subiaco council on 1 May 1901. On 1 December 1902, Daglish was sworn in as mayor of Subiaco, having been elected the previous month.

In the 1904 state election, Labor won 22 of the Legislative Assembly&#x27;s 50 seats, making it the party with the most seats. On 8 July 1904, the Labor Party caucus elected Daglish as the party&#x27;s leader, and on 10 August, he successfully moved a motion of no confidence in the government of Walter James, who resigned as premier. Governor Frederick Bedford then swore in Daglish as premier of Western Australia, colonial treasurer and minister for education. His keynote speech on 23 August was poorly received; militant Labor supporters saw him as giving up on Labor policies. In parliament, Daglish struggled to achieve anything due to a hostile Legislative Council; his one major success was the passing of a new Public Service Act. In June 1905, a cabinet reshuffle decreased Daglish&#x27;s popularity within the Labor Party but he defeated a motion of no confidence at a caucus meeting later that month. Daglish resigned as premier on 22 August 1905 when his plan to buy the Midland Railway Company for £1.5 million () failed to pass through parliament. Hector Rason succeeded him as premier on 25 August.

On 27 September 1905, Daglish resigned as leader of the Labor Party. He then left the party and styled himself as an Independent Labor politician. He was again elected Mayor of Subiaco on 5 June 1907 and served until 1908. From August 1907 to September 1910, Daglish held the position of Chairman of Committees, and from September 1910 to October 1911, he was the minister for works in Frank Wilson&#x27;s Liberal government. At the October 1911 state election, Daglish lost his seat in parliament to Labor candidate Bartholomew James Stubbs and failed to regain the seat at the 1914 state election. Daglish died at his home in Subiaco on 16 August 1920. Daglish railway station and the suburb of Daglish, Western Australia, are named after him.

==Early life==
Henry Daglish was born in Ballarat, Victoria, on 18 November 1866, to Mary Ann (née James) and William Daglish, an engine driver. He was educated in Geelong and in 1881 he attended the University of Melbourne. He gained a mechanical engineering apprenticeship at a foundry in 1882 but a year later, he left engineering to join the public service as a clerk in the Victorian Police Department.

On 20 August 1894, in Carlton, Victoria, Daglish married Edith May Bishop, with whom he had a son, H. Daglish, of the Bank of New South Wales, Narrabeen, and a daughter, Rae Daglish. With an increasing interest in the labour movement, by June 1895, Daglish was the secretary of the United Public Service Association. In September 1895, he went into business as an auctioneer, accountant and legal manager.

In 1895 and 1896, Daglish was a member of the National Anti-Sweating League, a group campaigning against the poor conditions endured by low-paid workers. In 1896, Daglish stood in a by-election for the seat of Melbourne South in the Victorian Legislative Assembly, receiving 34 out of 2,192 total votes. Later the same year, Daglish moved to Western Australia (WA) after taking an offer of £200 () to resign from the recession-hit Victorian public service; he settled in the working-class suburb Subiaco, west of Perth, the state capital. Daglish wrote a letter to Premier John Forrest requesting work in the WA public service in 1897; he was offered and accepted a position as assistant to the chief clerk in the WA Police Department. He later resigned and entered business as an auctioneer, accountant and legal manager.

==Political career==
In November 1899, Daglish unsuccessfully stood for election to the Central Ward of the Subiaco Municipal Council. The following year, he was elected unopposed to the council&#x27;s South Ward, his term starting on 1 December 1900.

Daglish resigned from the public service in 1901 to stand as a Labor Party candidate in the newly created seat of Subiaco in the Western Australian Legislative Assembly. In the 1901 Western Australian state election on 24 April, Daglish was elected to that seat with the largest majority in the state, and became the whip of the Labor Party. The party had only seven members, all of whom, aside from Daglish, represented seats in the mining regions of Murchison and the Goldfields. He tendered his resignation from the Subiaco Municipal Council on 1 May 1901.

One of Daglish&#x27;s successes in his first term is the carrying of his motion in favour of an eight-hour working day for the Railway Department. He was also successful in stopping the spending of money to help public servants immigrate from England, instead spending the money on assisting Western Australian workers migrate their families from the eastern states. He also advocated for the non-alienation of crown lands and the introduction of a comprehensive system of old age pensions.

In November 1902, Daglish was elected unopposed as mayor of Subiaco. He was sworn in on 1 December 1902 by Walter James, the premier of Western Australia. The premier had earlier made a speech heaping much praise on Daglish. He was again elected mayor unopposed the following year.

Daglish was appointed to the Kings Park Board in his capacity as the member for Subiaco in October 1902. In January 1903, Daglish joined the Perth Hospital Board, which managed Perth Public Hospital (now known as Royal Perth Hospital). On the board, he &quot;earned a reputation for shouldering the real or fancied troubles of dissatisfied ex-patients&quot;. He was also a member of the Lake Monger Board and the Karrakatta Cemetery Board.

In February 1904, the Labor Party held a conference at which they decided on the issues of their campaigning and platforms they would take to the next election. The issues were:
* Referendum on abolishing the Legislative Council
* A tax on unimproved land values and no further alienation of crown lands
* Old age pensions
* Maximum working day of eight hours
* Local control and state management of the liquor trade
* Departmental construction of public works
* Nationalisation of monopolies and the establishment of a Department of Labour
* State banking and insurance
* Limitation on state borrowing except for the purpose of reproductive works
* The establishment of a sinking fund for the redemption of all future loans

In the general campaign were policies of electoral, taxation, land, industrial and mining reform.

===Premier of Western Australia===
The Labor Party supported all but two pieces of the government&#x27;s legislation during the fourth parliament. Despite this, they withdrew support for the James Ministry in August 1903. At the July 1904 state election, Daglish was re-elected with 80% of Subiaco&#x27;s vote. The Labor Party won 22 seats, James&#x27;s Ministerialist faction won 18 seats, and independents won 10 seats. The number of seats Labor won surprised most people, many of whom expected only a modest increase over the seven seats won in 1901. Two bills that passed in the previous session of parliament helped Labor; the &quot;Redistribution of Seats Act 1904&quot; created new electorates in areas where Labor did well, and the &quot;Electoral Act 1904&quot; abolished plural voting for property owners and made it easier for newcomers to Western Australia to qualify for the electoral roll.

Labor leader Robert Hastie said James should not resign until parliament met, and so James continued as premier following the election. On 8 July 1904, the Labor Party caucus elected Daglish as the party&#x27;s leader. Labor leader Hastie was universally hated and the leadership ballot was initially going to be between Hastie, Daglish, George Taylor, Patrick Lynch, Wallace Nelson and Henry Ellis. Hastie pulled out of the contest, and only Daglish and Taylor were left. Newspapers reported the vote was almost unanimously for Daglish. The party decided to sit in opposition and not try and seek government because the caucus had been divided on whether to align with independents sympathetic for the party&#x27;s cause. When Daglish was elected Labor leader, the &quot;Sunday Figaro&quot;, a newspaper in Kalgoorlie, said he was &quot;certainly one of the best debaters in the Legislative Assembly. He is a quiet, deliberate speaker, given more to argument than declamation, bearing in this respect a likeness to [Prime Minister Chris Watson]&quot;.

On 10 August, Daglish successfully moved a motion of no confidence and James resigned as premier. Governor Frederick Bedford then swore in Daglish as premier of Western Australia, colonial treasurer and minister for education. He was the first Labor Party premier of WA, the sixth overall, and at 37 years of age, the youngest premier of the state at the time and the fourth-youngest . Daglish&#x27;s Cabinet were sworn in the same day; his party granted him the freedom to choose his own cabinet. Due to constitutional requirements that at least one minister be from the Legislative Council, Daglish invited John Drew, an unaligned politician, into the ministry, resulting in criticism from within his own party. Despite becoming premier, Daglish did not move from Subiaco to a more affluent area as many other premiers had. Immediate problems for Daglish were the state&#x27;s poor financial situation and an inexperienced cabinet made up of unions that were hostile to each other.

At Kings Hall, Subiaco, on 23 August, Daglish delivered a speech that was poorly received; militant Labor supporters saw him as giving up on Labor policies. He said the state&#x27;s finances were in a poor position and expenditure was to be reduced. Newspapers mocked his use of the phrase &quot;mark time policy&quot; and so his government became known as the &quot;mark time government&quot;. In the same speech, Daglish proposed a referendum on abolishing the Legislative Council, a bill to introduce pensions for those over 60 years and who had lived in the state for 10 years, the introduction of land tax with exemptions for properties valued below £1,000 () with the land value determined by the owner), the granting of greater job security for public servants, the establishment of a Department of Labor for the administration of workplace relations legislation, the amendment of the &quot;Truck Act&quot;, and companies and mining legislation to prevent monopolies and ensure all companies conducting business in Western Australia would have at least two local directors. Concerns with Daglish&#x27;s speech included his lack of a clear policy for unemployment and that the tax exemption for land worth below £1,000 was a &quot;violation of the Labor platform&quot;. A few days later, Daglish said; &quot;we have never, as a Labor Party advocated the abolition of the Legislative Council&quot;.

The Legislative Council prevented much of Daglish&#x27;s agenda; his government&#x27;s one major change was the passing of a new Public Service Act. He twice introduced a bill for a referendum to abolish the Legislative Council; the first bill was discharged at the end of the session and the second failed to pass before the Daglish government resigned. Daglish did not contest the November 1904 Subiaco municipal election; he was succeeded as mayor by John Henry Prowse.

Daglish reshuffled his cabinet on 7 June 1905, making Thomas Bath the minister for education, leaving himself as premier and colonial treasurer. Patrick Lynch was added to cabinet, and George Taylor and John Holman were clumsily demoted. The cabinet reshuffle caused a split in the Labor Party; Daglish&#x27;s opponents said he acted towards his colleagues in a high-handed and humiliating manner. On 18 June, &quot;The Sunday Times&quot; wrote; &quot;it has taken the Labor Party in politics – and in Parliament – nearly a year to find out that its leader is not in every particular, fully qualified to hold responsible office&quot;. At a meeting of the Labor caucus on 26 June, Daglish defeated a motion of no confidence 14–3.

After this, the government created a plan to buy the Midland Railway Company for £1.5 million (). The company owned the Midland railway line, which ran from Midland Junction near Perth to Walkaway near Geraldton. Opponents criticised the price for being too high, and Daglish failed to get approval from parliament on 17 August. On Monday 22 August, the Daglish Ministry resigned; the state&#x27;s governor gave the Liberal-aligned Hector Rason until the end of the week to form a cabinet. On 25 August, the governor accepted the resignations of Daglish and his ministry, and appointed Hector Rason and the Rason Ministry to replace them.

===After premier===
On 27 September 1905, Daglish resigned as leader of the Labor Party and on 4 October, William Johnson was elected leader of the party. Daglish later left the party and began styling himself as an Independent Labor politician. On 4 October, Rason moved for the discharge of the referendum bill; the motion was defeated 18 votes to 16 and the following day, the premier met with the governor to dissolve the Legislative Assembly. The resulting election was called for 27 October. Labor Party lost eight seats at the election but Daglish narrowly retained his seat. The failure of Daglish&#x27;s government caused the Labor Party to be more careful in selecting candidates and to use more discipline.

On 5 June 1907, Daglish was again elected Mayor of Subiaco, following the resignation of the previous mayor Austin Bastow. Daglish was sworn in on 12 June 1907. He was re-elected unopposed in November 1907 and did not re-contest the post in 1908.

From 20 August 1907 to 16 September 1910, Daglish held the position of Chairman of Committees. From 16 September 1910 to 3 October 1911, he was the minister for works in Frank Wilson&#x27;s Liberal government. At the October 1911 state election, Daglish lost his seat in parliament to Labor candidate Bartholomew James Stubbs. At the following election in 1914, Daglish unsuccessfully stood for the seat of Subiaco.

==Outside politics==
From to 1906, Daglish was president of Subiaco Football Club. During 1906, he helped hold off a campaign by North Fremantle Football Club for Subiaco&#x27;s expulsion from the Western Australian Football Association after several years of poor performance. The club had been playing next to Shenton Park Lake, and the club&#x27;s ground was wet and muddy. Daglish helped secure money from the Municipality of Subiaco for the construction of a playing ground at Mueller Park, which later became known as Subiaco Oval. The club relocated there in 1908. In 1911, Daglish again served as president of Subiaco Football Club. From 1912, Daglish worked as an estate agent and from March that year, he was appointed the employers&#x27; representative in the Court of Arbitration, a post in which served until his death.

==Death and legacy==
In 1920, Daglish, who had been ill for several months, travelled to Melbourne for medical treatment. In Melbourne, he had an operation and was diagnosed with cancer. Daglish returned to Perth, arriving on 12 August 1920, and died at his home in Subiaco four days later. He was buried at Karrakatta Cemetery. He was survived by his wife Edith, who died aged 71 on 28 May 1946, and his two children.

Although the Daglish government was little-remembered decades later, the Labor Party&#x27;s coming to power marked the start of two-party politics in Western Australia. Labor came to be seen as the alternative to the Ministerialists, also known as Liberals. When Daglish resigned, he became Western Australia&#x27;s first leader of the opposition.

Daglish railway station, which opened in 1924 on the western edge of Subiaco, was named after Henry Daglish. The Perth suburb Daglish, adjacent to the railway station, was also named after him. The Subiaco house in which Daglish lived in from 1908 is heritage listed.

<text>A time capsule is a historic cache of goods or information, usually intended as a deliberate method of communication with future people, and to help future archaeologists, anthropologists, or historians. The preservation of holy relics dates back for millennia, but the practice of preparing and preserving a collection of everyday artifacts and messages to the future appears to be a more recent practice. Time capsules are sometimes created and buried during celebrations such as world&#x27;s fairs or cornerstone layings for building or at other ceremonies.

== History ==
===Early examples===
It is widely debated when time capsules were first used, but the concept is fairly simple, and the idea and first use of time capsules could be much older than is currently documented. The term &quot;time capsule&quot; appears to be a relatively recent coinage dating from 1938. In Poland a time capsule dating to 1726 has been found. 
Around 1761, some dated artifacts were placed inside the hollow copper grasshopper weathervane, itself dating from 1742, atop historic Faneuil Hall in Boston.
A time capsule dating to 1777 was discovered within a religious statue in Sotillo de la Ribera. 
A time capsule was discovered on November 30, 2017, in Burgos, Spain. A wooden statue of Jesus had hidden inside it a document with economic, political and cultural information, written by Joaquín Mínguez, chaplain of the Cathedral of Burgo de Osma in 1777.
A time capsule from the era of the American Revolution, dating to 1795 and credited to Samuel Adams and Paul Revere, was temporarily removed in 2014 from the cornerstone of the Massachusetts State House in Boston. It had been previously opened in 1855, and some new items had been added before it was reinstalled. It was ceremonially reopened in January 2015 at the Museum of Fine Arts Boston, with specific restrictions on media coverage, to preserve the fragile artifacts. The contents were displayed there briefly, and then reinstalled in their original location. It is the oldest known time capsule in the United States.

===20th century===
In 1901, a time capsule was placed inside the head of the copper lion ornamenting the Old State House in Boston. It was opened in 2014, during repairs to the sculpture and building, with plans to add new artifacts and reinstall it in its original location.

The Detroit Century Box, a brainchild of Detroit mayor William C. Maybury, was created on December 31, 1900, and scheduled to be opened 100 years later. It was filled with photographs and letters from 56 prominent residents describing life in 1900 and making predictions for the future, and included a letter by Maybury 
to the mayor of Detroit in 2000. The capsule was opened by city officials on December 31, 2000, in a ceremony presided over by mayor Dennis Archer.

A time capsule labelled &quot;Kan aabnes i 2012&quot; (&quot;Can open in 2012&quot; in Norwegian) was sealed in 1912 in Otta, Norway. The capsule was opened as part of a ceremony 100 years later in 2012. Despite the large excitement over the capsule&#x27;s opening and a preceding ceremony, its contents (which included notebooks, newspaper clippings, and community council papers) were met with disappointment.

The Crypt of Civilization (1936) at Oglethorpe University, intended to be opened in 8113, is claimed to be the first &quot;modern&quot; time capsule, although it was not called one at the time. During the socialist period in the USSR, many time capsules were buried with messages to a future communist society.

The 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair time capsule was created by Westinghouse as part of their exhibit. It was long, with an interior diameter of , and weighed . Westinghouse named the copper, chromium, and silver alloy &quot;cupaloy&quot;, claiming it had the same strength as mild steel. It contained everyday items such as a spool of thread and doll, a book of record (description of the capsule and its creators), a vial of staple food crop seeds, a microscope, and a 15-minute RKO Pathé Pictures newsreel. Microfilm spools condensed the contents of a Sears Roebuck catalog, dictionary, almanac, and other texts.

The 1939 time capsule was followed in 1965 by a second capsule at the same site, but to the north of the original. Both capsules are buried below Flushing Meadows Park, site of the Fair. Both the 1939 and 1965 Westinghouse Time Capsules are meant to be opened in 6939.

There is documentation of at least three physical time capsules at the Massachusetts Institute of Technology (MIT) in Cambridge, Massachusetts, as well as a &quot;virtual&quot; or digital time capsule.

, four time capsules are &quot;buried&quot; in space. The two Pioneer Plaques and the two Voyager Golden Records have been attached to spacecraft for the possible benefit of spacefarers in the distant future. A fifth time capsule, the KEO satellite, was scheduled to be launched in 2015–16. However, it has been delayed several times and an actual launch date has not been given. After launch, it will carry individual messages from Earth&#x27;s inhabitants addressed to earthlings around the year 52,000, when it is due to return to Earth. , the satellite had not been launched.

The International Time Capsule Society was created in 1990 to maintain a global database of all known time capsules. The Not Forgotten Digital Preservation Library maintains a current map and register of domestic and commercial time capsules.

===21st century===
&quot;Earth&#x27;s Black Box&quot;—a city bus-sized structure with steel walls, battery storage and solar panels located at remote site in Tasmania—will accumulate and electronically store comprehensive climate research and related data, including land and sea temperature changes, ocean acidification, atmospheric greenhouse gas concentrations, human population, energy consumption, military spending, and policy changes. The box was conceived to tell future civilizations how humankind created the climate crisis, and how it failed or succeeded to address it.

On February 22, 2024, the Arch Mission Foundation landed the Lunar Library on the Moon, containing the English Wikipedia and other content, with the GLL Lunaprise mission, on the Intuitive Machines IM-1 mission.

==Criticism==

According to time capsule historian William Jarvis, most intentional time capsules usually do not provide much useful historical information: they are typically filled with &quot;useless junk&quot;, new and pristine in condition, that tells little about the people of the time. Many time capsules today contain only artifacts of limited value to future historians. Historians suggest that items which describe the daily lives of the people who created them, such as personal notes, pictures, videos and documents, would greatly increase the value of the time capsule to future historians.

If time capsules have a museum-like goal of preserving the culture of a particular time and place for study, they fulfill this goal very poorly in that they, by definition, are kept sealed for a particular length of time. Subsequent generations between the launch date and the target date will have no direct access to the artifacts and therefore these generations are prevented from learning from the contents directly. Therefore, time capsules can be seen, in respect to their usefulness to historians, as dormant museums, their releases timed for some date so far in the future that the building in question is no longer intact.

Historians also concede that there are many preservation issues surrounding the selection of the media to transmit this information to the future. Some of these issues include the obsolescence of technology and the deterioration of electronic and magnetic storage media (known as the digital dark age), and possible language problems if the capsule is dug up in the distant future. Many buried time capsules are lost, as interest in them fades and the exact location is forgotten, or they are destroyed within a few years by groundwater.

==Cultural references==
The 1947 docudrama &quot;The Beginning or the End&quot; is a semi-historical account of the creation of the first atomic bomb during World War II. The film begins with staged newsreel footage of the scientists and officers involved in the project (played by actors) burying a time capsule in Redwood National Forest in California. The capsule contained a copy of the film, along with a projector to view it on, and instructions for its operation set on a metal sheet. The purpose of the capsule was in line with the film&#x27;s title, about whether humanity will destroy itself now that it has the ability to, or whether it will rise above war as a whole and come together to use nuclear power for greater purposes. The film can be seen as an example of Cold War propaganda.

The 2009 dramatic film &quot;Knowing&quot; involves a time capsule being placed in the ground by an elementary school in 1959.

Artists such as Andy Warhol, Christian Boltanski, and Louise Bourgeois are known for compiling collections of everyday artifacts that they associate with memories of the past, which are preserved in museums and archives.

The 1955 Warner Bros. cartoon &quot;One Froggy Evening&quot; involves a singing and dancing frog extricated from (and eventually replaced within) a time capsule. Filmmaker Steven Spielberg, in the PBS Chuck Jones biographical documentary &quot;Extremes &amp; Inbetweens: A Life in Animation&quot;, called &quot;One Froggy Evening&quot; &quot;the &quot;Citizen Kane&quot; of animated shorts&quot;. In 1994, it was voted of the 50 Greatest Cartoons of all time by members of the animation profession.

==Personal and domestic time capsules==
Commercially manufactured sealable containers are sold for protection of personal time capsules; some of the more durable waterproof containers used for geocaching may also be suitable. Many underground time capsules are destroyed by groundwater infiltration after short periods of time; caches stored within the wall cavities of buildings can survive as long as the building is used and maintained.

In 2016, the art collective Ant Farm displayed a show, &quot;The Present Is the Form of All Life: The Time Capsules of Ant Farm and LST&quot;, at the art center Pioneer Works, in Brooklyn, New York. The artists had previous experiences with failed time capsules, and were now exploring &quot;digital time capsules&quot; as a more durable form of preservation. They have said, &quot;We’ve come to understand that the best way to preserve digital media is to distribute it.&quot; Blockchain and cognitive learning is now used in time capsule technology. Researchers have started to study methods of preserving digital data in forms that will still be usable in the distant future.

<text>Shishapangma, or Shishasbangma or Xixiabangma (), is the 14th-highest mountain in the world, at above sea level. It is located entirely within Tibet. In 1964, it became the final eight-thousander to be climbed.

==Name==
Geologist Toni Hagen explained the name as meaning a &quot;grassy plain&quot; or &quot;meadow&quot; (&#x27;) above a &quot;comb&quot; or a &quot;range&quot; (&#x27; or &quot;&quot;) in the local Tibetan language, thereby signifying the &quot;crest above the grassy plains&quot;.

On the other hand, Tibetologist Guntram Hazod records a local story that explains the mountain&#x27;s name in terms of its literal meaning in the Standard Tibetan language: &#x27;, which means &quot;meat of an animal that died of natural causes&quot;, and &#x27;, which means &quot;malt dregs left over from brewing beer&quot;. According to the story, one year a heavy snowfall killed most of the animals at pasture. All that the people living near the mountain had to eat was the meat of the dead animals and the malt dregs left over from brewing beer, and so the mountain was named Shisha Pangma (&quot;&quot;), signifying &quot;meat of dead animals and malty dregs&quot;.

The name of the mountain, &quot;Gosainthan&quot;, means &quot;place of the saint&quot; or &quot;Abode of God&quot;. The name is in use in popular literature. For example, in the comic strip &quot;Tintin in Tibet&quot;, a fictional Air India flight had crashed at Gosainthan. Tintin, Captain Haddock and the Sherpa team traveled to Gosainthan in search of Chang Chong-Chen.

==Geography==
Shishapangma is located in south-central Tibet, five kilometres from the border with Nepal. It and Nanga Parbat are the only eight-thousanders entirely within Chinese and Pakistan territory respectively. It is also the highest peak in the Jugal Himal, which is contiguous with and often considered part of Langtang Himal. The Jugal/Langtang Himal straddles the Tibet/Nepal border. Since Shishapangma is on the dry north side of the Himalayan crest and farther from the lower terrain of Nepal, it has less dramatic vertical relief than most major Himalayan peaks.

Shishapangma also has a subsidiary peak higher than 8,000 m, Central Peak, at .

== Ascents and attempts ==
Some of Shishapangma&#x27;s ascents are not well verified, or still in dispute, with climbers potentially having only reached the slightly lower west peak at or the central peak at , which is still almost two hours of dangerous ridge-climbing from the true summit at . Himalayan chronicler and record keeper Elizabeth Hawley famously got Ed Viesturs (amongst others) to re-climb the true main summit of Shishapangma in his quest to climb all 14 eight-thousanders, as she would not accept central (or west) summit ascents as being full ascents of Shishapangma for her &quot;Himalayan Database&quot;.

Thirty-one people have died climbing Shishapangma, including Americans Alex Lowe and Dave Bridges in 1999, veteran Portuguese climber Bruno Carvalho, and noted Bulgarian climber Boyan Petrov, who disappeared on 3 May 2018. Nevertheless, Shishapangma is considered one of the easiest eight-thousanders to climb. The most common ascent, via the North Route, traverses the northwest face and northeast ridge and face, and has relatively easy access, with vehicle travel possible to base camp at . Routes on the steeper southwest face are more technically demanding and involve of ascent on a 50-degree slope.

===First ascent===
Shishapangma was first climbed, via the Northern Route, on 2 May 1964 by a Chinese expedition led by Xǔ Jìng. In addition to Xǔ Jìng, the summit team consisted of Zhāng Jùnyán (张俊岩), Wang Fuzhou, Wū Zōngyuè (邬宗岳), Chén Sān (陈三), Soinam Dorjê (索南多吉), Chéng Tiānliàng (成天亮), Migmar Zhaxi (米马扎西), Dorjê (多吉), and Yún Dēng (云登).

=== Later ascents and attempts ===
* 1980: 7 May, &quot;Northern Route&quot;, (second ascent) by Michael Dacher, Wolfgang Schaffert, Gunter Sturm, Fritz Zintl, and Manfred Sturm (12 May); as part of a German expedition.
* 1980: 13 October, &quot;Northern Route&quot;, (3rd ascent) by Ewald Putz and Egon Obojes, as part of an Austrian expedition.
* 1981: 30 April, &quot;Northern Route&quot;, (4th ascent) by Junko Tabei, Rinzing Phinzo and Gyalbu Jiabu, as part of a Japanese women&#x27;s expedition.
* 1981: 28 May, &quot;Northern Route&quot;, (5th ascent) by Reinhold Messner (Italy) and (Italy), as part of an Austrian expedition.
* 1982: 28 May, &quot;British Route&quot;, southwest face, also known as &quot;Right-hand couloir&quot; (alpine style), FA by Doug Scott, Alex MacIntyre and Roger Baxter-Jones (all UK). This route follows the right-hand couloir on the southwest face.
* 1987: 18 September, Elsa Ávila and Carlos Carsolio become the first Mexicans to summit Shishapangma. This was Ávila&#x27;s first eight-thousander and Carsolio&#x27;s second, via the northern face/ridge to the central summit, then along the arete to the main summit, with Wanda Rutkiewicz, Ramiro Navarrete, and Ryszard Warecki.
* 1987: 18 September, the two Poles Jerzy Kukuczka and Artur Hajzer, climbing alpine style, made the first ascent of the west ridge and the western peak then continued to traverse the summit ridge to reach the central peak and finally the main summit. Kukuczka then skied down from near the main summit. This was the last of his fourteen eight-thousanders.
* 1987: 19 September, central couloir, north face, FA by Alan Hinkes (UK) and Steve Untch (US).
* 1989: 19 October, Central buttress, southwest face, FA by Andrej Stremfelj and Pavle Kozjek.
* 1990: Left-hand couloir, southwest face (not reaching the main summit), Wojciech Kurtyka (Poland), FA by Erhard Loretan (Switzerland) and Jean Troillet (Switzerland).
* 1993: Far-right couloir, southwest face, FA solo by Krzysztof Wielicki (Poland).
* 1993: May 22, Marcos Couch and Nicolás De la Cruz (Argentinian expedition).
* 1994: Left-hand couloir, southwest face (not reaching the main summit), (France), Catherine Destivelle (France).
* 1996: 9 October, Anatoli Boukreev completed a solo ascent.
* 1999: 28 September, Edmond Joyeusaz (Italy), first ski descent from central summit.
* 2002: 5 May, &quot;Korean Route&quot; on southwest face, FA by Park-jun Hun and Kang-yeon Ryoung (both South Korean).
* 2002: 26 October: Tomaž Humar (Slovenia), Maxut Zhumayev, Denis Urubko, Alexey Raspopov and Vassily Pivtsov got to the summit. Humar climbed last 200 m (80°/50–60°, 200 m) of ascent and descent (65–75°, 700 m).
* 2004: 11 December, Jean-Christophe Lafaille (France) provoked controversy when he climbed the &quot;British Route&quot; on the southwest face, solo, and claimed a winter ascent. Since this was not calendar winter, he changed his claim to an ascent &quot;in winter conditions.&quot;
* 2005: 14 January, first (calendar) winter ascent by Piotr Morawski (Poland) and Simone Moro (Italy) who climbed the south face by the &quot;Slovenian route&quot;. Morawski &amp; Moro had made a winter attempt the previous year, on 17 January 2004 they reached the summit plateau at 7,700m but because of the late hour they faced an unplanned bivouac and a high likelihood of frostbite so they returned to camp, the attempt was abandoned the following day in the face of deteriorating weather.
* 2006: First Portuguese expedition reaching the top of the mountain. João Garcia, Hélder Santos, Rui Rosado, Bruno Carvalho and Ana Santos Silva reached the summit, but Bruno Carvalho died on the descent.
* 2011: 16–17 April, Ueli Steck (Switzerland) soloed the southwest face in 10.5 hours, leaving base camp (5,306m) at 10:30 pm on 16 April and returning to base camp 20 hours later.
* 2014: September 24, Sebastian Haag died along with the Italian mountaineer Andrea Zambaldi in an avalanche. Haag was 36 years old.
* 2018: May 3, Bulgarian climber Boyan Petrov disappeared after having been last seen at Camp 3 (~7,400 m). A subsequent two-week search effort found only a few personal items and medicine.
*2019: October 29, Nirmal Purja (Nepal) made it to the top of Shishapangma six months and six days after summiting his first 8000-metre peak as part of his Project Possible to climb all 14 eight-thousanders in seven months.

<text>Caddie Woodlawn is a children&#x27;s historical fiction novel by Carol Ryrie Brink that received the Newbery Medal in 1936 and a Lewis Carroll Shelf Award in 1958. The original 1935 edition was illustrated by Newbery-award-winning author and illustrator Kate Seredy. Macmillan released a later edition in 1973, illustrated by Trina Schart Hyman.

==Plot==
Set in the 1860s, the novel is about a lively eleven-year-old tomboy named Caroline Augusta Woodlawn, nicknamed &quot;Caddie&quot;, living in the area of Dunnville, Wisconsin. As a young girl, she made the journey there from Boston with her family, one that nearly cost her life. Sickly and weak, she is allowed to run wild with her brothers, Tom and Warren, to regain her health. They spend much of their time exploring the woods and rivers that surround their farm. The book opens with Caddie being late for dinner after an excursion to visit the local Indian tribe, embarrassing her mother with her antics. She, undaunted, spends the next year having a string of adventures and scares. From a midnight ride through the forest to warn her friend, &quot;Indian John&quot;, that the settlers are planning an attack, to a prairie fire that brings out the best in Obediah, the school bully, to a life-threatening fall through a lake while ice skating, her life is far from boring. Things come to a head when &quot;perfect&quot; Cousin Annabelle from Boston arrives for a visit, and Caddie is forced to confront her future. Tom and Warren, always a part of her adventures, come along for the journey. This story is full of practical jokes and touching moments, like Nero&#x27;s long journey home - a beloved pet dog that was taken by Caddie&#x27;s uncle to be &quot;educated.&quot; It tells the story of a family&#x27;s existence on the frontier during the Civil War and offers insights into how life was lived in a small Wisconsin village where fear of local Indians was a reality, and life and death situations arose with frightening regularity. The sequel, &quot;Magical Melons&quot; (1939), continues the story of Caddie Woodlawn. 

==Background==
Brink (1895–1981) was born and raised in Moscow, Idaho, in the Palouse region. Orphaned at age eight following her mother&#x27;s suicide, she lived there with her widowed maternal grandmother and an unmarried aunt; the former had grown up on a farm in Wisconsin. In a preface to the later edition of &quot;Caddie Woodlawn&quot;, she said the books were partly based on the life of her grandmother, Caddie Woodhouse Watkins (1853–1940), and her siblings: older sister Clara, older brother Tom, younger brother Warren, younger sisters Hetty and Minnie, and baby brother Joe.

The house where Caddie lived is now a historical site, about south of Menomonie, Wisconsin.

==Critical reception==
Children&#x27;s literature expert May Hill Arbuthnot says of &quot;Caddie Woodlawn&quot;, &quot;this book is far less of a frontier story—settlers versus Indians—than it is the entertaining evolution of a tomboy. The fun Caddie gets out of life suggests the usefulness of this book in counteracting the over-seriousness of most historical fiction.&quot; &quot;Kirkus Reviews&quot; said it provides &quot;an authentic picture of life on a frontier farm when massacre was a real threat and when a livelihood, hardly earned, allowed for fun in natural outdoor things.&quot; It won the Newbery Medal in 1936.

The book&#x27;s portrayal of Native Americans has been criticized in more recent years. Debbie Reese, founder of the website American Indians in Children&#x27;s Literature, shared her daughter&#x27;s pained reaction to reading it in school in &quot;Reflections on Caddie Woodlawn: Teaching about Stereotypes using Literature.&quot;

==Adaptations==
Brink transformed &quot;Caddie Woodlawn&quot; into a radio drama in 1945.

In 1989, a made-for-television movie based on the book was directed by Giles Walker with teleplay by Joe Wisenfeld and Richard John Davis. Emily Schulman of Small Wonder portrayed Caddie. Several changes were made from the book, most notably moving the conflict between the settlers and Indians toward the end, and greatly increasing the role of Caddie&#x27;s cousin, Annabelle. 

A musical, &quot;Caddie Woodlawn A Musical Adventure&quot; (The Caddie Woodlawn Musical), by Tom Shelton and Susan C. Hunter, Brink&#x27;s granddaughter, was also based on the book.

<text>Gasherbrum II (; ; ); surveyed as K4, is the 13th highest mountain in the world at above sea level. It is the third-highest peak of the Gasherbrum massif, and is located in the Karakoram, on the border between Gilgit–Baltistan, Pakistan and Xinjiang, China. The mountain was first climbed on July 7, 1956, by an Austrian expedition which included Fritz Moravec, Josef Larch, and Hans Willenpart.

==Geography==
Gasherbrum II is located on the border of Gilgit–Baltistan, Pakistan, and Xinjiang, China. It is part of the Karakoram mountain range in the Himalayas, and located at the top of the Baltoro Glacier. With an elevation of it is the third-highest member of the Gasherbrum group, behind Gasherbrum I () and Broad Peak (). Gasherbrum III is sometimes considered to be a subpeak of Gasherbrum II, because the former has a topographic prominence of only .

==Naming==
In 1856, Thomas George Montgomerie, a member of the British Royal Engineers and part of the Great Trigonometric Survey, sighted the mountain and named it &quot;K4&quot;, meaning the fourth mountain of Karakoram. The name &quot;Gasherbrum&quot; comes from the Balti words &quot;rgasha&quot; (&quot;beautiful&quot;) and &quot;brum&quot; (&quot;mountain&quot;). Contrary to popular belief, it does not mean &quot;shining wall&quot;, which is how Sir William Martin Conway described nearby Gasherbrum IV on an 1892 exploration.

==Climbing history==
The mountains of the Gasherbrum group were explored in 1909 by the Duke of the Abruzzi and Vittorio Sella. The Abruzzi Glacier, a tributary of the Baltoro Glacier, is named after the Duke.

In 1934, Günter Dyhrenfurth and his International Himalayan Expedition, including André Roch, explored Gasherbrum I and II, making it up Gasherbrum II.

The first ascent came on July 7, 1956, by Austrians Fritz Moravec, Josef Larch and Hans Willenpart by the Southwest Ridge. After they set up Camp I, they had to descend, and found the camp—and all their supplies and food—buried by an avalanche when they returned. Despite this, they decided to make a quick summit attempt. After opening up a route, they left Camp III on July 6. The group spent the night in a bivouac sack and reached the top at 11:30 am the next day.

=== 1970s ===
In 1975, four expeditions successfully climbed Gasherbrum II, including Jean-Pierre Fresafond&#x27;s French expedition, a Polish group under Janusz Onyszkiewicz, and another Polish expedition led by Wanda Rutkiewicz.

Four years later, a Chilean group claimed to have used the &quot;normal&quot; route to reach the top. Several others, including Reinhard Karl, Hanns Schell, and Kurt Diemberger also reached the summit.

=== 1980s ===
Swiss Mountaineers Romolo Nottaris and Tiziano Zünd were the first to reach the summit in alpine style on August 3, 1981.

On July 24, 1982, Reinhold Messner, along with Nazir Sabir and Sher Khan, climbed the peak via the Southwest Ridge. During the ascent, Messner discovered the body of a previously missing Austrian mountaineer, whom he buried two years later at the G I – G II crossing. He wrote of his climb of Gasherbrum II in the book &quot;3 x 8000: My Great Year in the Himalaya&quot; ().

In July 1984, Reinhold Messner and Hans Kammerlander reached both Gasherbrum II and Gasherbrum I without returning to base camp, in alpine style.

In August 1984, a French expedition led by Daniel Croisot, reached the summit and achieved the integral first descent by ski of Gasherbrum II, as witnessed and joined by Dominique Dock who was medical officer for the expedition. Patrice Bournat and Wim Pasquier skied the sowthwest ridge to Base Camp from 7,500 meters.

In August 1986, Gasherbrum II was successfully ascended by a Slovene expedition in only 32 hours from the base to the peak, with only 22 hours of climbing and 10 hours of rest at the altitude of 5900 m. This was by far the fastest ascent until then.

=== 1990s ===
In July 1996, Jean-Christophe Lafaille climbed Gasherbrum I and II in four days, without stopping at Base Camp in between.

In 1997 Anatoli Boukreev achieved a solo speed ascent, camp ABC (5800 metres) to summit in 9 hours 30 min.

=== 2000s ===
In 2006, Sebastian Haag and Benedikt Böhm climbed Gasherbrum II twice within a week. At 8:00 am on July 29, they reached the top and then skied down without abseiling or removing their skis. They rested for a few days before leaving Camp I again on August 3. They started out fast, reaching Camp IV in six hours, but of fresh snow slowed them down, and they reached the summit after over six hours of tough climbing. They descended on skis again, this time made even more dangerous by packed-down snow and the risk of avalanche. Despite this, they both made it safely back to Camp I in under 17 hours, whereas a normal expedition takes four to seven days.

Karl Unterkircher and Daniele Bernasconi, two Italians, climbed Gasherbrum II in 2007 in alpine style. They were the first to use the North Face through China. The route had been attempted a year earlier by a German–Swiss team, but they abandoned it after an avalanche. During the attempt they fixed around of rope. They arrived at the summit around 8:00 pm on July 20, after spending the night in a bivouac shelter. A third member, Michele Compagnoni, grandson of Achille Compagnoni, turned back just before the summit. The team reunited and descended down the normal, northwest route.

=== 2010s ===
On July 22, 2011, Leila Esfandyari successfully completed the ascent to the peak but she died while descending.

On February 2, 2011, Cory Richards, Denis Urubko, and Simone Moro made the first winter ascent of Gasherbrum II. Despite being buried by a class-four avalanche, they reached the summit at 11:30 am, without supplemental oxygen or porters. Richards, who was the first American to climb an eight-thousander in winter, filmed the expedition, which he turned into the film &quot;Cold&quot;.

On July 16, 2018, Felix Berg and Adam Bielecki summited Gasherbrum II making what is arguably the first ascent of the true West Face.

=== 2020s ===
In 2021, two French ski teams, including Boris Langenstein, Tiphaine Duperier, Aurelia Lanoe, and Guillaume Pierrel successfully skied Gasherbrum. On July 18, 2023, Hugo Ayaviri climbed Gasherbrum II without oxygen, the fourth 8000’er in his quest to be the first Bolivian to summit all fourteen 8000m peaks.

On July 19, 2023, Andrzej Bargiel made the highest descent from Gasherbrum II on skis. He summitted the mountain without the use of supplementary oxygen and began his ski descent from 26,362 feet up, over 8,000m.

<doc id="358879" wikidata="Q989492" url="?curid=358879" title="Córdoba, Veracruz">
<text>Córdoba, known officially as Heroica Córdoba, is a city and the seat of the municipality of the same name in the Mexican state of Veracruz. It was founded in 1618.

The city is composed of 15 barrios (neighborhoods) bounded to the north by Ixhuatlán del Café and Tomatlán, and to the south by Amatlán de los Reyes and Naranjal. The western area abuts Fortin de las Flores and the eastern area borders Amatlán de los Reyes and Peñuela.

Córdoba has a municipal area of 159.9 km.2 It is divided into 95 localities, of which the most important are San Román, Crucero Nacional, La Luz y Trinidad Palotal, and Colorines.

This city is also known as The City of the Thirty Knights since it was founded by 30 Spanish noblemen commissioned by Viceroy Fernández de Córdoba.

The city boasts of its historical importance, its colonial places and buildings, its cultural centers, parks and its gastronomy. Along with Fortín, Amatlán and Yanga, it forms part of a very important metropolitan area, with a population of 335,850 people as 2020, in the Altas Montañas region to form a large metropolitan area together with the City of Orizaba.

==Geography==
Córdoba is located in the center of the state of Veracruz, at 18º51&#x27;30&quot; north latitude and 96º55&#x27;51&quot; west longitude. It lies between the hills of Matlaquiahitl and Tepixtepec, at an elevation of 817 meters (2,680 feet) above mean sea level.

Its climate is warm and humid, with an annual average temperature of 19.8 °C (67.6 °F). There is abundant rainfall in summer and autumn, with little rain in winter.

==History==
=== Colonial period ===
The village of Córdoba was founded in 1618 by the Spanish to protect royal interests from attacks by Gaspar Yanga&#x27;s slave rebellion.

=== Mexican War of Independence ===
After the capture of the city by Mexican rebel forces in August 1821, the Mexican revolutionary Agustín de Iturbide and the Spanish viceroy Juan de O&#x27;Donojú signed the Treaty of Córdoba here, ratifying the Plan de Iguala and confirming Mexico&#x27;s independence.

In 1902 Córdoba became the interchange point of the narrow-gauge Córdoba and Huatusco Railroad to Coscomatepec.

===Modern times===
The city was severely damaged by the 1973 Veracruz earthquake.

==Economy==
The main economic activities are agriculture, ranching, industry and trade. The principal crops are sugar cane, coffee, avocado, orange, lemon, and rice, along with some non-traditional crops as anturios, heliconias and palma camedor.

A highway connects Córdoba with the state&#x27;s principal port, Veracruz. There is an adequate workforce, with a relatively low annual wage, providing opportunities for hiring for industry.

Córdoba is the focal point for the local sugar milling and coffee processing industries, and it is also an important place for marketing and refining tropical fruits.
Several medical institutions provide public-health services in Córdoba, including the ISSSTE, the IMSS, and the SCSP. There is also a local Cruz Roja (Red Cross) hospital, and several private hospitals.

The city has a large number of entertainment centers, including billiard halls, ballrooms and discothèques. Cordoba has three libraries, three auditoriums, a theatre and a museum.

== Transportation ==
From 1902 to 1953, Córdoba was served by the Córdoba and Huatusco Railroad narrow-gauge railroad. The line operated as a unique and scenic gauge branch of Ferrocarril Mexicano from 1909 through 1951.

==Demographics==
As of 2020, the municipality of Córdoba has an approximate population of 204,721 inhabitants, 139,075 residing in the municipal seat, which represents 2.57% of the total population of the State of Veracruz, which makes it the 6th largest in the state. Other localities include San Román (10,907 hab.), Crucero Nacional (8,479 hab.), La Luz y Trinidad Palotal (3,584 hab.) and Colorines (2,911 hab.).

==Notable locations==
One of Córdoba&#x27;s most important locations is its zócalo (main square). The square, called the Parque de 21 de Mayo, uses the traditional Spanish layout, with a church on the east side, the Palacio Municipal (city hall) on the west, and commercial establishments on the north and south sides.

The Paso Coyol Ecological Park is a eco-conscious park that was once an abandoned lot.

<doc id="358882" wikidata="Q178127" url="?curid=358882" title="Push-to-talk">
<text>Push-to-talk (PTT), also known as press-to-transmit, is a method of having conversations or talking on half-duplex communication lines, including two-way radio, using a momentary button to switch from voice reception mode to transmit mode.

== History==
For example, an air traffic controller usually supervises several aircraft and talks on one radio frequency to all of them. Those under the same frequency can hear others&#x27; transmissions while using procedure words such as &quot;break&quot;, &quot;break break&quot; to separate order during the conversation (ICAO doc 9432). In doing so, they are aware of each other&#x27;s actions and intentions. Unlike in a conference call, they do not hear background noise from the ones who are not speaking. Similar considerations apply to police radio, the use of business band radios on construction sites, and other scenarios requiring coordination of several parties. Citizens Band is another example of classic push-to-talk operation.

The PTT switch is most commonly located on the radio&#x27;s handheld microphone, or for small hand-held radios, directly on the radio. For heavy radio users, a PTT foot switch may be used, and also can be combined with either a boom-mounted microphone or a headset with integrated microphone.

Less commonly, a separate hand-held PTT switch may be used. This type of switch was historically called a &quot;pressel&quot;.

In situations where a user may be too busy to handle a talk switch, voice operated switches are sometimes employed. Some systems use PTT ID to identify the speaker.

== Mobile phones ==

&quot;Push-to-talk over cellular&quot; (PTToC) is a service option for a cellular phone network that enables subscribers to use their phones as walkie-talkies with unlimited range. A typical push-to-talk connection connects almost instantly. A significant advantage of PTT is the ability for a single person to reach an active talk group with a single button press; users don&#x27;t need to make several telephone calls to coordinate with a group.

Push-to-talk cellular calls similarly provide half-duplex communications – while one person transmits, the other(s) receive. This combines the operational advantages of PTT with the interference resistance and other virtues of mobile phones. Manufacturers of (POC or PoC) hardware include ToooAir and Hytera US Inc.

Mobile push-to-talk services, offered by some mobile carriers directly as well as by independent companies, adds PTT functionality to smartphones and specialized mobile handsets (hand portable and mobile/base station PTT Radio Terminals). In addition to mobile handsets, some services also work on a laptop, desktop, and tablet computers.

== Smartphone and computer apps ==

Recent development in PTT communications is the appearance of apps on smartphones, some of which can function on multiple platforms. Wireless carrier-grade PTT systems have adapted to and adopted the smartphone platform by providing downloadable apps that support their PTT systems across many mobile platforms. Over-the-top (OTT) applications do not depend on a specific carrier or type of communication network, and may be slower than carrier implementations.

<doc id="358887" wikidata="Q166517" url="?curid=358887" title="Thomas Howard, 14th Earl of Arundel">
<text>Thomas Howard, 14th Earl of Arundel KG, (7 July 1585 – 4 October 1646) was an English peer, diplomat and courtier during the reigns of King James I and King Charles I, but he made his name as a Grand Tourist and art collector rather than as a politician. When he died he possessed 700 paintings, along with large collections of sculptures, books, prints, drawings, and antique jewellery. Most of his collection of marble carvings, known as the Arundel marbles, was eventually left to the University of Oxford.

He is sometimes referred to as the 21st Earl of Arundel, ignoring the supposed second creation of 1289, or the 2nd Earl of Arundel, the latter numbering depending on whether one views the earldom obtained by his father as a new creation or not. He was also 2nd or 4th Earl of Surrey; and was later created 1st Earl of Norfolk (5th creation). He is also known as &quot;the Collector Earl&quot;.

==Early life and restoration to titles==
Arundel was born in relative penury, at Finchingfield in Essex on 7 July 1585. His aristocratic family had fallen into disgrace during the reign of Queen Elizabeth I owing to their Catholic religion and involvement in plots against the Queen. He was the son of Philip Howard, 13th Earl of Arundel, and Anne Dacre, daughter and co-heiress of Thomas Dacre, 4th Baron Dacre of Gilsland. He never knew his father, who was imprisoned before Arundel was born, and owing to his father&#x27;s attainder he was initially styled Lord Maltravers.

Henry Howard, Earl of Northampton, Arundel&#x27;s great-uncle helped him regain royal favor upon the accession of James I to the English throne in 1603, and Arundel was restored to his titles and some of his estates in 1604. Other parts of the family lands ended up with his great-uncles. The next year he married Lady Alatheia (or Alethea) Talbot, a daughter of Gilbert Talbot, 7th Earl of Shrewsbury, and a granddaughter of Bess of Hardwick. She would inherit a vast estate in Nottinghamshire, Yorkshire, and Derbyshire, including Sheffield, which has been the principal part of the family fortune ever since. Even with this large income, Arundel&#x27;s collecting and building activities would lead him heavily into debt.

==Diplomatic and political career==
In June 1607, Arundel hosted a feast at court and produced a play, &quot;The Tragedy of Aeneas and Dido&quot; to entertain the Prince de Joinville. Arundel was an effective diplomat during the reign of James I. After coming to court, he travelled abroad, acquiring his taste for art.
He was created Knight of the Garter in 1611. In 1613 he escorted Elizabeth, the electress consort Palatine, to Heidelberg as part of her marriage celebrations, and again visited Italy. On Christmas Day 1616 he took communion in a Church of England service, seen as a true test of his conformity, having been appointed a Privy Councillor in July 1616 He supported Sir Walter Raleigh&#x27;s expedition to Guiana in 1617, became a member of the New England Plantations Committee in 1620 and planned the colonization of Madagascar.

Arundel presided over the House of Lords Committee in April 1621 for investigating the corruption charges against Francis Bacon, whom he defended from degradation from the peerage, and at whose fall he was appointed a commissioner of the Great Seal. On 16 May 1621, he was briefly sent to the Tower of London by the Lords on account of insulting Baron Spencer by referring to their respective ancestry. He then incurred Prince Charles&#x27;s and the Duke of Buckingham&#x27;s anger by his opposition to the (proposed) war with Spain in 1624, and by his share in the duke&#x27;s impeachment.

On the marriage of his son Henry to Lady Elizabeth Stewart (daughter of Esmé Stewart, 3rd Duke of Lennox) without the king&#x27;s approval, he was imprisoned in the Tower by Charles I, shortly after his accession, but was released at the instance of the Lords in June 1626, being again confined to his house till March 1628, when he was once more liberated by the Lords. In the debates on the Petition of Right, while approving its essential demands, he supported the retention of some discretionary power by the king in committing to prison. The same year he was reconciled to the king and again made a privy councillor.

On 29 August 1621 Arundel had been appointed Earl Marshal, and in 1623 Constable of England, in 1630 reviving the Earl Marshal&#x27;s court. He was sent to The Hague in 1632 on a mission of condolence to the king&#x27;s sister, Elizabeth Stuart, recently Queen of Bohemia, on her husband&#x27;s death. In 1634 he was made justice in eyre of the forests north of the Trent; he accompanied Charles the same year to Scotland on the occasion of his coronation. In 1635 he was made Lord Lieutenant of Surrey.

In 1636 Arundel undertook an unsuccessful mission to the emperor Ferdinand II to procure the restitution of the Palatinate to Charles I&#x27;s nephew Charles Louis, whose father had been deposed after claiming and losing the throne of Bohemia. In 1638 he was entrusted with the charge of the forts on the border with Scotland, and, supporting alone amongst the peers the war against the Scots, was made general of the king&#x27;s forces in the first Bishops&#x27; War, though &quot;he had nothing martial about him but his presence and looks.&quot; He was not employed in the second Bishops&#x27; War, but in August 1640 was nominated captain general south of the Trent.

Arundel was appointed Lord Steward of the royal household in April 1640, and in 1641 as lord high steward presided at the trial of the Earl of Strafford. This closed his public career. He became again estranged from the court, and in 1641 he escorted Marie de&#x27; Medici home. In 1642 he accompanied Princess Mary for her marriage to William II of Orange.

==Death and succession==
With the troubles that would lead to the Civil War brewing, Arundel decided not to return from the Netherlands to England, and instead settled first in Antwerp and then at a villa near Padua, Italy. He contributed a sum of £34,000 to the king&#x27;s cause, and suffered severe losses in the war. 

He died in Padua in 1646, having returned to the Roman Catholicism he nominally abandoned on joining the Privy Council, and was buried in Arundel. He was succeeded as Earl by his eldest son Henry Howard, 15th Earl of Arundel who was the ancestor of the Dukes of Norfolk and Baron Mowbray. His youngest son William Howard, 1st Viscount Stafford was the ancestor of what was first the Earl of Stafford and later Baron Stafford.

Arundel had petitioned the king for restoration of the ancestral Dukedom of Norfolk. While the restoration was not to occur until the time of his grandson, he was created Earl of Norfolk in 1644, which at least ensured the title would stay with his family. Arundel also got Parliament to entail his earldoms to the descendants of his grandfather the 4th Duke of Norfolk.

==Collector and patron of the arts==
Thomas&#x27;s trips as special envoy to some of the great courts of Europe further encouraged his interest in art collecting. He became noted as a patron and collector of works of art, described by Walpole as &quot;the father of virtu in England&quot;, and was a member of the Whitehall group of connoisseurs associated with Charles I. He commissioned portraits of himself or his family by contemporary masters such as Daniel Mytens, Peter Paul Rubens, Jan Lievens, and Anthony van Dyck. He acquired other paintings by Hans Holbein, Adam Elsheimer, Mytens, Rubens, and Honthorst.

Among Arundel&#x27;s circle of scholarly and literary friends were James Ussher, William Harvey, John Selden and Francis Bacon. The architect Inigo Jones accompanied Arundel on one of his trips to Italy in 1613 and 1614, a journey which took both men as far as Naples. In the Veneto Arundel saw the work of Palladio which was to become so influential to Jones&#x27;s later career. Soon after the latter&#x27;s return to England, he became Surveyor to the King&#x27;s Works.

Arundel collected drawings by Leonardo da Vinci, the two Holbeins, Raphael, Parmigianino, Wenceslaus Hollar, and Dürer. Many of these are now at the Royal Library at Windsor Castle or at Chatsworth. An inventory of Arundel&#x27;s paintings was prepared in 1655 following the death of the Countess of Arundel. It was published as part of Mary Hervey&#x27;s collected edition of his correspondence. The coins and medals were bought by Heneage Finch, Earl of Winchilsea, and dispersed in 1696.

He had a large collection of antique sculptures, the Arundel Marbles mostly Roman, but including some he had excavated in the Greek world, which was then the most important in England. His acquisitions, which also included fragments, pictures, gems, coins, books and manuscripts, were deposited at Arundel House, and suffered considerable damage during the Civil War; due to the war and subsequent neglect nearly half of the marbles were destroyed. After his death, the remaining treasures were dispersed. The marble and statue collection was later bequeathed to Oxford University. It is now in the Ashmolean Museum.

Arundel&#x27;s important library and its collection of manuscripts was inherited by his son, the 15th Earl, and later by his grandson, Henry Howard (afterwards 6th Duke of Norfolk). In 1666, at the instigation of John Evelyn, who feared its total loss, Henry Howard gave most of it to the Royal Society, and a part, consisting of genealogical and heraldic collections, to the College of Heralds, the manuscript portion of the Royal Society&#x27;s portion was sold to the British Museum in 1831, and they now form the Arundel manuscripts within the British Library.

In 1995, the J.Paul Getty Museum mounted an exhibition of Thomas Howard&#x27;s and his wife Aletheia&#x27;s extensive art collection.

<text>Grey aliens, also referred to as Zeta Reticulans, Roswell Greys, Alien Greys, or simply, Greys, are purported extraterrestrial beings. They are frequent subjects of close encounters and alien abduction claims. The details of such claims vary widely. Greys are typically described as being humanoid with small bodies, smooth, grey skin; enlarged, hairless heads; and large, black, almond-shaped eyes. The Barney and Betty Hill abduction claim, which purportedly took place in New Hampshire in 1961, popularized Grey aliens. Precursor figures have been described in science fiction and similar descriptions appeared in later accounts of the 1947 Roswell UFO incident and early accounts of the 1948 Aztec UFO hoax.

The Grey alien has emerged as an archetypal image of an intelligent non-human creature and extraterrestrial life in general, as well as an iconic trope of popular culture in the age of space exploration.

==Description==
===Appearance===

Greys are typically depicted as grey-skinned, diminutive humanoid beings that possess reduced forms of, or completely lack, external human body parts such as noses, ears, or sex organs. Their bodies are usually depicted as being elongated, having a small chest, and lacking in muscular definition and visible skeletal structure. Their legs are depicted as being shorter and jointed differently from humans with limbs proportionally different from a human.

Greys are depicted as having unusually large heads in proportion to their bodies with no hair on the body, and no noticeable outer ears or noses, sometimes with small openings or orifices for ears, nostrils, and mouths. In drawings, Greys are almost always shown with very large, opaque, black eyes, without eye whites. They are frequently described as shorter than average adult humans.

===Association with Zeta Reticuli===
The association between Grey aliens and Zeta Reticuli originated with the interpretation of a map drawn by Betty Hill by a school-teacher named Marjorie Fish sometime in 1969. Betty Hill, under hypnosis, had claimed to have been shown a map that displayed the aliens&#x27; home system and nearby stars. Upon learning of this, Fish attempted to create a model from a drawing produced by Hill, eventually determining that the stars marked as the aliens&#x27; home were Zeta Reticuli, a binary star system.

==History==

===Origins===
In 1893, H. G. Wells presented a description of humanity&#x27;s future appearance in the article &quot;The Man of the Year Million&quot;, describing humans as having no mouths, noses, or hair, and with large heads. In 1895, Wells also depicted the Eloi, a successor species to humanity, in similar terms in the novel &quot;The Time Machine&quot;.

As early as 1917, the occultist Aleister Crowley described a meeting with a &quot;preternatural entity&quot; named Lam that was similar in appearance to a modern Grey. Crowley believed he had contacted the entity through a process that he called the &quot;Amalantrah Workings,&quot; which he thought allowed humans to contact beings from outer space and across dimensions. Other occultists and ufologists, many of whom have retroactively linked Lam to later Grey encounters, have since described their own visitations from him, with one describing the being as a &quot;cold, computer-like intelligence,&quot; and utterly beyond human comprehension.

In 1933, the Swedish novelist Gustav Sandgren, using the pen name Gabriel Linde, published a science fiction novel called &quot;Den okända faran&quot; (&quot;The Unknown Danger&quot;), in which he describes a race of extraterrestrials who wore clothes made of soft grey fabric and were short, with big bald heads, and large, dark, gleaming eyes. The novel, aimed at young readers, included illustrations of the imagined aliens. This description would become the template upon which the popular image of grey aliens is based.

===Barney and Betty Hill abduction===
The conception remained a niche one until 1965, when newspaper reports of the Betty and Barney Hill abduction made the archetype famous. The alleged abductees, Betty and Barney Hill, claimed that in 1961, humanoid alien beings with grayish skin had abducted them and taken them to a flying saucer.

In his 1990 article &quot;Entirely Unpredisposed&quot;, Martin Kottmeyer suggested that Barney&#x27;s memories revealed under hypnosis might have been influenced by an episode of the science-fiction television show &quot;The Outer Limits&quot; titled &quot;The Bellero Shield&quot;, which was broadcast 12 days before Barney&#x27;s first hypnotic session. The episode featured an extraterrestrial with large eyes, who says, &quot;In all the universes, in all the unities beyond the universes, all who have eyes have eyes that speak.&quot; The report from the regression featured a scenario that was in some respects similar to the television show. In part, Kottmeyer wrote:

Carl Sagan echoed Kottmeyer&#x27;s suspicions in his 1997 book, &quot;The Demon Haunted World: Science as a Candle in the Dark&quot;, where &quot;Invaders from Mars&quot; was cited as another potential inspiration.

===Diffusion into folklore===
After the Hills&#x27; encounter, Greys would go on to become an integral part of ufology and other extraterrestrial-related folklore. This is particularly true in the case of the United States: according to journalist C. D. B. Bryan, 73% of all reported alien encounters in the United States describe Grey aliens, a significantly higher proportion than other countries.
During the early 1980s, Greys were linked to the alleged crash-landing of a flying saucer in Roswell, New Mexico, in 1947. A number of publications contained statements from individuals who claimed to have seen the U.S. military handling a number of unusually proportioned, bald, child-sized beings. These individuals claimed, during and after the incident, that the beings had oversized heads and slanted eyes, but scant other distinguishable facial features.

In 1987, novelist Whitley Strieber published the book &quot;Communion&quot;, which, unlike his previous works, was categorized as non-fiction, and in which he describes a number of close encounters he alleges to have experienced with Greys and other extraterrestrial beings. The book became a &quot;New York Times&quot; bestseller, and New Line Cinema released a 1989 film adaption that starred Christopher Walken as Strieber.

In 1988, Christophe Dechavanne interviewed the French science-fiction writer and ufologist Jimmy Guieu on TF1&#x27;s &quot;Ciel, mon mardi !&quot;. Besides mentioning Majestic 12, Guieu described the existence of what he called &quot;the little greys&quot;, which later on became better known in French under the name: &quot;les Petits-Gris&quot;. Guieu later wrote two docudramas, using as a plot the Grey aliens / Majestic-12 conspiracy theory as described by John Lear and Milton William Cooper: the series &quot;E.B.E.&quot; (for &quot;Extraterrestrial Biological Entity&quot;): &quot;E.B.E.: Alerte rouge&quot; (first part) (1990) and &quot;E.B.E.: L&#x27;entité noire d&#x27;Andamooka&quot; (second part) (1991).

Greys have since become the subject of many conspiracy theories. Many conspiracy theorists believe that Greys represent part of a government-led disinformation or plausible deniability campaign, or that they are a product of government mind-control experiments. During the 1990s, popular culture also began to increasingly link Greys to a number of military-industrial complex and New World Order conspiracy theories.

In 1995, filmmaker Ray Santilli claimed to have obtained 22 reels of 16 mm film that depicted the autopsy of a &quot;real&quot; Grey supposedly recovered from the site of the 1947 incident in Roswell. In 2006, though, Santilli announced that the film was not original, but was instead a &quot;reconstruction&quot; created after the original film was found to have degraded. He maintained that a real Grey had been found and autopsied on camera in 1947, and that the footage released to the public contained a percentage of that original footage.

==Analysis==

===In close encounter claims and ufology===
Greys are often involved in alien abduction claims. Among reports of alien encounters, Greys make up about 50% in Australia, 73% in the United States, 48% in continental Europe, and around 12% in the United Kingdom. These reports include two distinct groups of Greys that differ in height.

Abduction claims are often described as extremely traumatic, similar to an abduction by humans or even a sexual assault in the level of trauma and distress. The emotional impact of perceived abductions can be as great as that of combat, sexual abuse, and other traumatic events.

The eyes are often a focus of abduction claims, which often describe a Grey staring into the eyes of an abductee when conducting mental procedures. This staring is claimed to induce hallucinogenic states or directly provoke different emotions.

===Psychocultural expression of intelligence===
Neurologist Steven Novella proposes that Grey aliens are a byproduct of the human imagination, with the Greys&#x27; most distinctive features representing everything that modern humans traditionally link with intelligence. &quot;The aliens, however, do not just appear as humans, they appear like humans with those traits we psychologically associate with intelligence.&quot;

===The &quot;Mother Hypothesis&quot;===
In 2005, Frederick V. Malmstrom, writing in &quot;Skeptic&quot; magazine, volume 11, issue 4, presents his idea that Greys are actually residual memories of early childhood development. Malmstrom reconstructs the face of a Grey through transformation of a mother&#x27;s face based on our best understanding of early-childhood sensation and perception. Malmstrom&#x27;s study offers another alternative to the existence of Greys, the intense instinctive response many people experience when presented an image of a Grey, and the act of regression hypnosis and recovered-memory therapy in &quot;recovering&quot; memories of alien abduction experiences, along with their common themes.

===Evolutionary implausibility===
According to biologist Jack Cohen, the typical image of a Grey, assuming that it would have evolved from a world with different environmental and ecological conditions from Earth, is too physiologically similar to a human to be credible as a representation of an alien.

===Other hypotheses===
The interdimensional hypothesis, the cryptoterrestrial hypothesis, and the time-traveller hypothesis attempt to provide an alternative explanation to the humanoid anatomy and behavior of these alleged beings.

==In popular culture==

Depictions of Grey aliens have gone on to appear in a number of films and television shows, supplanting the previously popular little green men. As early as 1966, for example, the superhero character Ultraman was explicitly based on them, and in 1977 they were featured in &quot;Close Encounters of the Third Kind&quot;. Greys have also been worked into space opera and other interstellar settings: in &quot;Babylon 5&quot;, the Greys are referred to as the &quot;Vree&quot;, and are depicted as being allies and trade partners of 23rd-century Earth, while in the &quot;Stargate&quot; franchise they are called the &quot;Asgard&quot; and depicted as ancient astronauts allied with modern-day Earth. &quot;South Park&quot; refers to them as &quot;visitors&quot;.

During the 1990s, plotlines wherein Greys were linked to conspiracy theories became common. and &quot;American Dad!&quot;, which features a Grey-like alien named Roger, whose backstory draws from both the Roswell incident and Area 51 conspiracy theories.

The 2011 film &quot;Paul&quot; tells the story of a Grey named Paul who attributes the Greys&#x27; frequent presence in science fiction pop culture to the US government deliberately inserting the stereotypical Grey alien image into mainstream media; this is done so that if humanity came into contact with Paul&#x27;s species, no immediate shock would occur as to their appearance. Child abduction by Greys is a key plot point in the 2013 film, &quot;Dark Skies&quot;.

Greys appear in Syfy&#x27;s 2021 science fiction dramedy series &quot;Resident Alien&quot;.

The Greys appear as the main antagonistic faction in the 2023 independent game &quot;Greyhill Incident&quot;.

==Early life==
Katsuie was born in the village of Kamiyashiro (present-day Meitō-ku, Nagoya), a branch of the Shiba clan (who descended from the Ashikaga clan, and were the former suzerains of the Oda clan). Note the differences between , , and the .

Katsuie was the retainer of Oda Nobuyuki. In 1554, Katsuie took part in the Battle of Kiyosu Castle against Oda Nobutomo, uncle of Nobunaga.

In 1556, when control of the Oda clan was contested, Katsuie initially supported his lord, Nobuyuki, against his elder brother Oda Nobunaga. Katsuie launched a coup d&#x27;état against Nobunaga. He was defeated at the Battle of Inō, and in the aftermath Nobunaga had his brother executed, but impressed with the retainer&#x27;s loyalty and bravery, spared the life of Katsuie. Katsuie pledged his services to Nobunaga, earning his praises.

In 1556, According to the records from &quot;Tosho Gunkan&quot;, Sakai Tadatsugu defends Fukutani castle which besieged by 2,000 cavalry troops of Oda clan led by Shibata Katsuie. Tadatsugu manage to repel the forces of Katsuie as he led a sallying forces outside the castle and routing them.

==Service under Nobunaga==
In 1560, he was commander of Nobunaga&#x27;s main forces against Imagawa Yoshimoto at the Battle of Okehazama.

In 1567, he led the first division of Oda Nobunaga&#x27;s forces, in the siege of Inabayama against Saito clan.

In late 1568, Katsuie, along with Hosokawa Fujitaka, Hachiya Yoritaka, Mori Yoshinari and Sakai Masahisa attacked Iwanari Tomomichi at Shōryūji Castle.

In 1570, while the Oda–Tokugawa coalition fought at the Battle of Anegawa against the Asakura and Azai clans, Katsuie was at Chōkō-ji castle, under siege by 4,000 soldiers of the Rokkaku clan. Katsuie eventually won via an all-out attack, forcing the Rokkaku to retreat. This action, along with a series of brilliant victories, gained him renown as the &quot;Oni Shibata&quot;, or &quot;Demon Shibata&quot;.

In 1571, he fought in the first Siege of Nagashima and was severely wounded.

In 1573, when Shogun Ashikaga Yoshiaki, who was protected by the Mori clan, built an anti-Nobunaga network, Katsuie fought against Yoshiaki&#x27;s forces in various places including Omi Province and Settsu Province as a powerful military commander of the Oda army. Later, He took part in the Siege of Ichijodani Castle and also in the Second Siege of Nagashima right after that, but he pulled back again.

In 1574, he took part in the third Siege of Nagashima. He commanded the right wing among the three groups along with Sakuma Nobumori.

In 1577, Nobunaga sent an army led by Shibata Katsuie and some of his most experienced generals to reinforce Shigetsura from Noto province against Uesugi Kenshin at the Battle of Tedorigawa.

In 1580, he led an army, which included his general Sakuma Morimasa in a fight against the Kaga Ikko-ikki at Kanazawa Gobo.

In 1581, after controlling Noto, he began a campaign against Etchū Province along with Maeda Toshiie, Sassa Narimasa and Fuwa Mitsuharu.

In 1582, he and Sassa Narimasa successfully laid siege to Uozu and Matsukura Castle. In the meantime, Oda Nobunaga and his eldest son and heir, Nobutada, were killed in the Honnō-ji incident by the forces of his former retainer Akechi Mitsuhide.

==Death==
Later in 1582, after the death of Nobunaga, in a meeting at Kiyosu Castle to determine Nobunaga&#x27;s successor, Katsuie initially supported the choice of Samboshi, Nobunaga&#x27;s grandson. but he later supported Oda Nobutaka, Nobunaga&#x27;s third son, for whom Katsuie had performed the genpuku ritual. He then allied with Oda Nobutaka and Takigawa Kazumasu against Toyotomi Hideyoshi who was allied with Oda Nobukatsu. Tension quickly escalated between Hideyoshi and Katsuie, and the following year they clashed at the Battle of Shizugatake.

===Battle of Shizugatake===

In 1583, Katsuie sent his nephew Sakuma Morimasa to besiege Takayama Ukon and Nakagawa Kiyohide at Shizugatake. Morimasa ignored Shibata&#x27;s orders to withdraw to Ōiwa and was captured and beheaded by Toyotomi Hideyoshi&#x27;s returning forces. Katsuie was defeated and retreated back into Echizen, all the way to Kitanosho Castle, which was taken in 3 days.

During the siege, Katsuie implored his wife, Oichi, to take their daughters and leave, but she decided to stay and die with him, while letting their daughters escape. After setting fire to his castle, Katsuie committed seppuku.

His death poem was:

:&quot;Natsu no yo no&quot;
:&quot;yumeji hakanaki&quot;
:&quot;ato no na o&quot;
:&quot;kumoi ni ageyo&quot;
:&quot;yamahototogisu&quot;

<text>Mount Columbia is a mountain located in the Winston Churchill Range of the Rocky Mountains. It is the highest point in Alberta, Canada, and is second only to Mount Robson for height and topographical prominence in the Canadian Rockies. It is located on the border between Alberta and British Columbia on the northern edge of the Columbia Icefield. Its highest point, however, lies within Jasper National Park in Alberta.

The mountain was named in 1898 by J. Norman Collie after the Columbia River. 
The river itself was named after the American ship &quot;Columbia Rediviva&quot; captained by Robert Gray, who first ventured over a dangerous sandbar and explored the lower reaches of the river in 1792. 
Mount Columbia was first ascended in 1902 by James Outram, guided by Christian Kaufmann. 
The first winter ascent of Columbia was completed on March 14, 1944, by about thirty men led by Major Douglas Groff of Winnipeg, during the course of a three-day patrol on the Icefield, using snow holes as sleeping quarters.

== Climbing routes ==

The normal route is on the east face, a non-technical glacier climb that is straightforward in summer, albeit with a long approach (approx. ) up the Athabasca Glacier and over the Columbia Icefield. Camping by King&#x27;s Trench can reduce the approach down to . Other routes include the North Ridge, which is more technical (Grade V, YDS 5.7, W3) but considered more spectacular.

==Geology==
Mount Columbia is composed of sedimentary rock laid down from the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Columbia is located in a subarctic climate with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Temperatures can drop below -20 °C with wind chill factors below -30 °C.

<doc id="358893" wikidata="Q3555932" url="?curid=358893" title="Arundel marbles">
<text>The Arundel marbles are a collection of stone Roman and Ancient Greek sculptures and inscriptions collected by Thomas Howard, 21st Earl of Arundel in the early seventeenth century, the first such comprehensive collection of its kind in England. They are now in the Ashmolean Museum, Oxford, having been donated in two groups.

==History==
The bulk of the collection was a gift by Arundel&#x27;s grandson Henry Howard, 6th Duke of Norfolk in 1667, at the prompting of John Evelyn and John Selden. The remainder were received in a second gift of 1755, when the extravagant 2nd Earl of Pomfret sold back to his mother, Henrietta Louisa, Countess of Pomfret, those that had been at his house at Easton Neston and she donated them to the Ashmolean, where they are sometimes called the Pomfret marbles.

The Earl of Arundel had supervised excavations in Rome, and deployed his agents in the Eastern Mediterranean, above all at Istanbul. Late in the seventeenth century, a visitor to Ottoman Turkey (in modern-day İzmir) could complain that:

The earl displayed his unrivalled collections at Arundel House, London, and one which his grandson did not leave to the collection, a 2nd-century AD relief from Ephesus is on display in the 17th century gallery at the Museum of London.

Some of these are not works of art but important inscriptions, the first Greek inscriptions that had been seen in England, from which historians have confirmed many dates in Greek history. Among them is the Parian Chronicle, inscribed about 263 BC so called because it was found on Paros, which gives Greek dates from 1582 BC down to 354 BC Among outstanding pieces is a relief that shows parts of the human body, outstretched arms: elbow to finger tips, foot, clenched fists and fingers each used as in that period of Ancient Greece as standard units of measure. Another important object from Arundel&#x27;s collection is the so-called Arundel Head, a Hellenistic bronze portrait of a philosopher or king from Asia Minor now in the British Museum.

The Arundel marbles were catalogued as early as 1628, when, at the suggestion of Sir Robert Bruce Cotton, John Selden compiled a catalogue: &quot;Marmora Arundelliana&quot; with the assistance of two others, Patrick Young and Richard James. In 1763 Richard Chandler published a fine edition of the inscriptions as &quot;Arundelian Marbles, Marmora Oxoniensia&quot; with a Latin translation, and a number of suggestions for filling the (gaps).

<text>Anthony Robert Kushner (born July 16, 1956) is an American author, playwright, and screenwriter. Among his stage work, he is most known for &quot;Angels in America&quot;, which earned a Pulitzer Prize and a Tony Award, as well as its subsequent acclaimed HBO miniseries of the same name. At the turn of the 21st century, he became known for his numerous film collaborations with Steven Spielberg. He received the National Medal of Arts from President Barack Obama in 2013. Kushner is among the few playwrights in history nominated for an Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Award.

Kushner made his Broadway debut in 1993 with both &quot;Angels in America: Millennium Approaches&quot; and &quot;Angels in America: Perestroika&quot;. He received the Pulitzer Prize for Drama and the Tony Award for Best Play. He then adapted the acclaimed 2003 miniseries directed by Mike Nichols for which Kushner received a Primetime Emmy Award for Outstanding Writing for a Limited Series or Movie.

In 2003, he wrote the lyrics and book to the musical &quot;Caroline, or Change&quot; which earned Kushner Tony Award nominations for Best Book of a Musical and Best Original Score. The 2021 Broadway revival of &quot;Caroline, or Change&quot; earned Kushner a nomination for the 2023 Grammy Award for Best Musical Theater Album.

He has collaborated with director Steven Spielberg on the films &quot;Munich&quot; (2005), &quot;Lincoln&quot; (2012), &quot;West Side Story&quot; (2021), and &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; (2022). His work with Spielberg has earned him four Academy Award nominations, one for Best Picture, two for Best Adapted Screenplay, and one for Best Original Screenplay.

== Early life and education ==

Kushner was born in Manhattan, the son of Sylvia (née Deutscher), a bassoonist, and William David Kushner, a clarinetist and conductor. His family is Jewish, descended from immigrants from Russia and Poland. Shortly after his birth, Kushner&#x27;s parents moved to Lake Charles, Louisiana, the seat of Calcasieu Parish where he spent his childhood. During high school Kushner was active in policy debate. He first developed an interest in the figure of Roy Cohn—who features as a major character in his play &quot;Angels in America&quot;—when he was ten years old, after asking his father about the meaning of McCarthyism, to which his father responded by giving his son a copy of Fred J. Cook’s &quot;The Nightmare Decade&quot;.

In 1974, Kushner moved back to New York to begin his undergraduate college education at Columbia University, where he received a Bachelor of Arts degree in Medieval studies in 1978. He attended the Tisch School of the Arts at NYU, graduating in 1984. During graduate school, he spent the summers of 1978–1981 directing both early original works (&quot;Masque of the Owls&quot; and &quot;Incidents and Occurrences During the Travels of the Tailor Max&quot;) and plays by Shakespeare (&quot;A Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; and &quot;The Tempest&quot;) starring the children attending the Governor&#x27;s Program for Gifted Children (GPGC) in Lake Charles.

Kushner has received several honorary degrees: in 2003 from Columbia College Chicago, in 2006 an honorary doctorate from Brandeis University, in 2008 an honorary Doctor of Letters from SUNY Purchase College, in May 2011 an honorary doctorate from CUNY&#x27;s John Jay College of Criminal Justice and also an Honorary Doctorate from The New School, and in May 2015, an honorary Doctor of Letters from Ithaca College.

== Career ==
Kushner&#x27;s best known work is &quot;Angels in America&quot; (a play in two parts: &quot;Millennium Approaches&quot; and &quot;Perestroika&quot;), a seven-hour epic about the AIDS epidemic in Reagan-era New York, which was later adapted into an HBO miniseries for which Kushner wrote the screenplay. His other plays include &quot;Hydriotaphia&quot;, &quot;Slavs!: Thinking About the Longstanding Problems of Virtue and Happiness&quot;, &quot;A Bright Room Called Day&quot;, &quot;Homebody/Kabul&quot;, and the book for the musical &quot;Caroline, or Change&quot;. His new translation of Bertolt Brecht&#x27;s &quot;Mother Courage and Her Children&quot; was performed at the Delacorte Theater in the summer of 2006, starring Meryl Streep and directed by George C. Wolfe. Kushner has also adapted Brecht&#x27;s &quot;The Good Person of Szechwan&quot;, Corneille&#x27;s &quot;The Illusion&quot;, and S. Ansky&#x27;s play &quot;The Dybbuk&quot;.

In the early 2000s, Kushner began writing for film. His co-written screenplay &quot;Munich&quot; was produced and directed by Steven Spielberg in 2005. In January 2006, a documentary feature about Kushner entitled &quot;Wrestling with Angels&quot; debuted at the Sundance Film Festival. The film was directed by Freida Lee Mock. In April 2011 it was announced that he was working with Spielberg again, writing the screenplay for an adaptation of historian Doris Kearns Goodwin&#x27;s book &quot;Team of Rivals: The Political Genius of Abraham Lincoln&quot;. The screenplay for &quot;Lincoln&quot; would go on to receive multiple awards, in addition to nominations for Best Adapted Screenplay at the Golden Globes and The Oscars.

In a 2015 interview actress/producer Viola Davis revealed she had hired Kushner to write an as yet untitled biopic about the life of Barbara Jordan that she planned to star in.

In 2016, Kushner worked on a screenplay version of August Wilson&#x27;s play &quot;Fences&quot;; the resulting film &quot;Fences&quot;, directed by Denzel Washington, was released in December 2016.

Kushner is famous for frequent revisions and years-long gestations of his plays. Both &quot;Angels in America: Perestroika&quot; and &quot;Homebody/Kabul&quot; were significantly revised even after they were first published. Kushner has admitted that the original script version of &quot;Angels in America: Perestroika&quot; is nearly double the length of the theatrical version. His newest completed work, the play &quot;The Intelligent Homosexual&#x27;s Guide to Capitalism and Socialism with a Key to the Scriptures&quot;, began as a novel more than a decade before it finally opened on May 15, 2009.

In 2018, it was announced that Kushner was working on a script of a remake of &quot;West Side Story&quot; for Spielberg to direct. &quot;West Side Story&quot; was released in December 2021 to positive reviews and received seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture.

In 2022, Kushner collaborated again with Spielberg on &quot;The Fabelmans&quot;, a fictionalized account of Spielberg&#x27;s childhood. The film premiered at the 2022 Toronto International Film Festival to widespread critical acclaim and won the festival&#x27;s People&#x27;s Choice Award. &quot;The Fabelmans&quot; received seven Academy Award nominations including Best Picture and Best Original Screenplay.

In 2023, with his Grammy Award nomination for Best Musical Theater Album for &quot;Caroline, or Change&quot;, Kushner became one of the few writers in history nominated for all four major American entertainment awards: the Emmy, Grammy, Oscar, and Tony Awards.

== Political views ==

Kushner&#x27;s six-word memoir was &quot;At least I never voted Republican.&quot; His criticism of the Israeli government&#x27;s treatment of Palestinians and the increased religious extremism in Israeli politics and culture has created some controversy with American Jews, including some opposition to his receiving an honorary doctorate at the 2006 commencement of Brandeis University. During the controversy, quotes critical of Zionism and Israel made by Kushner were circulated. Kushner said at the time that his quotes were &quot;grossly mischaracterized&quot;. Kushner told the &quot;Jewish Advocate&quot; in an interview, &quot;All that anybody seems to be reading is a couple of right-wing Web sites taking things deliberately out of context and excluding anything that would complicate the picture by making me seem like a reasonable person, which I basically think I am.&quot;

In an interview with the &quot;Jewish Independent&quot;, Kushner commented, &quot;I want the state of Israel to continue to exist. I&#x27;ve always said that. I&#x27;ve never said anything else. My positions have been lied about and misrepresented in so many ways. People claim that I&#x27;m for a one-state solution, which is not true.&quot; He later stated that he hopes that &quot;there might be a merging of the two countries because [they&#x27;re] geographically kind of ridiculous looking on a map&quot;, although he acknowledged that political realities make this unlikely in the near future. Kushner has received backlash from family members due to his political views of Israel.
On May 2, 2011, the Board of Trustees of the City University of New York (CUNY), at their monthly public meeting, voted to remove (by tabling to avoid debate) Kushner&#x27;s name from the list of people invited to receive honorary degrees, based on a statement by trustee Jeffrey S. Wiesenfeld about Kushner&#x27;s purported statements and beliefs about Zionism and Israel. In response, the &quot;CUNY Graduate Center Advocate&quot; began a live blog on the &quot;Kushner Crisis&quot; situation, including news coverage and statements of support from faculty and academics. Three days later, CUNY issued a public statement that the Board is independent.

On May 6, three previous honorees stated they intended to return their degrees: Barbara Ehrenreich, Michael Cunningham, and Ellen Schrecker. Wiesenfeld said that if Kushner would renounce his anti-Israel statements in front of the Board, he would be willing to vote for him. The same day, the Board moved to reverse its decision. Kushner accepted the honorary doctorate at the June 3 graduation for the John Jay College of Criminal Justice.

In March 2024, Kushner was one of several signatories of &quot;A Statement From Jewish Americans Opposing AIPAC&quot;, a letter denouncing AIPAC&#x27;s lobbying efforts in the United States government.

== Personal life ==
Kushner and his partner, Mark Harris, held a commitment ceremony in April 2003, the first same-sex commitment ceremony to be featured in the Vows column of &quot;The New York Times&quot;. In summer 2008, Kushner and Harris were legally married at the town hall in Provincetown, Massachusetts.

Harris is an editor of &quot;Entertainment Weekly&quot; and author of &quot;Pictures at a Revolution – Five Movies and the Birth of the New Hollywood&quot;, &quot;Five Came Back: A Story of Hollywood and the Second World War&quot;, and &quot;Mike Nichols: A Life&quot;.

He is close friends with theatre director Michael Mayer, whom he met while studying at NYU.

<text>Varina Anne Banks Davis ( Howell; May 7, 1826 – October 16, 1906) was the only First Lady of the Confederate States of America, and the longtime second wife of President Jefferson Davis. She moved to the presidential mansion in Richmond, Virginia, in mid-1861, and lived there for the remainder of the Civil War. Born and raised in the Southern United States and educated in Philadelphia, she had family on both sides of the conflict and unconventional views for a woman in her public role. She did not support the Confederacy&#x27;s position on slavery, and was ambivalent about the war.

Davis became a writer after the war, completing her husband&#x27;s memoir. She was recruited by Kate (Davis) Pulitzer, a purportedly distant cousin of Varina’s husband and wife of publisher Joseph Pulitzer, to write articles and eventually a regular column for the &quot;New York World&quot;. Widowed in 1889, Davis moved to New York with her youngest daughter Winnie in 1891 to work at writing. She enjoyed urban life. In her old age, she attempted to reconcile prominent figures of the North and South.

==Early life and education==
Varina Anne Banks Howell was born in 1826 at Natchez, Mississippi, the daughter of William Burr Howell and Margaret Louisa Kempe. Her father was from a distinguished family in New Jersey: His father, Richard Howell, served several terms as governor of New Jersey and died when William was a boy. William inherited little money and used family connections to become a clerk in the Bank of the United States.

William Howell relocated to Mississippi, when new cotton plantations were being rapidly developed. There he met and married Margaret Louisa Kempe (1806–1867), born in Prince William County, Virginia. Her wealthy planter family had moved to Mississippi before 1816. She was the daughter of Colonel James Kempe (sometimes spelled Kemp), a Scots-Irish immigrant from Ulster who became a successful planter and major landowner in Virginia and Mississippi, and Margaret Graham, born in Prince William County. Margaret Graham was illegitimate as her parents, George Graham, a Scots immigrant, and Susanna McAllister (1783–1816) of Virginia, never officially married.

After moving his family from Virginia to Mississippi, James Kempe also bought land in Louisiana, continuing to increase his holdings and productive capacity. When his daughter married Howell, he gave her a dowry of 60 slaves and of land in Mississippi. William Howell worked as a planter, merchant, politician, postmaster, cotton broker, banker, and military commissary manager, but never secured long-term financial success. He lost the majority of Margaret&#x27;s sizable dowry and inheritance through bad investments and their expensive lifestyle. They suffered intermittent serious financial problems throughout their lives.

Varina was born in Natchez, Mississippi, as the second Howell child of eleven, seven of whom survived to adulthood. She was later described as tall and thin, with an olive complexion attributed to Welsh ancestors. Later, when she was living in Richmond as the unpopular First Lady of the Confederacy, critics described her as looking like a mulatto or Indian &quot;squaw&quot;.

When Varina was thirteen, her father declared bankruptcy. The Howell family home, furnishings and slaves were seized by creditors to be sold at public auction. 

Her wealthy maternal relatives intervened to redeem the family&#x27;s property. It was one of several sharp changes in fortune that Varina encountered in her life. She grew to adulthood in a house called The Briars, when Natchez was a thriving city, but she learned her family was dependent on the wealthy Kempe relatives of her mother&#x27;s family to avoid poverty.

Varina Howell was sent to Philadelphia, Pennsylvania, for her education, where she studied at Madame Deborah Grelaud&#x27;s French School, a prestigious academy for young ladies. Grelaud, a Huguenot, was a refugee from the French Revolution and had founded her school in the 1790s. One of Varina&#x27;s classmates was Sarah Anne Ellis, later known as Sarah Anne Dorsey, the daughter of extremely wealthy Mississippi planters. (After the Civil War, Dorsey, by then a wealthy widow, provided financial support to the Davises.)

While at school in Philadelphia, Varina got to know many of her northern Howell relatives; she carried on a lifelong correspondence with some, and called herself a &quot;half-breed&quot; for her connections in both regions. After a year, she returned to Natchez, where she was privately tutored by Judge George Winchester, a Harvard graduate and family friend. She was intelligent and better educated than many of her peers, which led to tensions with Southern expectations for women. In her later years, Varina referred fondly to Madame Grelaud and Judge Winchester; she sacrificed to provide the highest quality of education for her two daughters in their turn.

In 1843, at age 17, Howell was invited to spend the Christmas season at Hurricane Plantation, the property of family friends Joseph Emory Davis and Eliza Van Benthuysen Davis. Her parents had named their oldest child after Joseph Davis. Located at Davis Bend, Mississippi, Hurricane was 20 miles south of Vicksburg. Davis was planning a gala housewarming with many guests and entertainers to inaugurate his lavish new mansion on the cotton plantation. (Varina described the house in detail in her memoirs.) During her stay, she met her host&#x27;s much younger brother Jefferson Davis. Then thirty-five years old, Davis was a West Point graduate, former Army officer, and widower. He worked as a planter, having developed Brierfield Plantation on land his brother allowed him to use, although Joseph Davis still retained possession of the land. 

==Marriage and family==
Jefferson Davis was a 35-year-old widower when he and Varina met. His first wife, Sarah Knox Taylor, daughter of his commanding officer Zachary Taylor while he was in the Army, had died of malaria three months after their wedding in 1835. Davis mourned her and had been reclusive in the ensuing eight years. He was beginning to be active in politics.

Shortly after first meeting him, Howell wrote to her mother:I do not know whether this Mr. Jefferson Davis is young or old. He looks both at times; but I believe he is old, for from what I hear he is only two years younger than you are [the rumor was correct]. He impresses me as a remarkable kind of man, but of uncertain temper, and has a way of taking for granted that everybody agrees with him when he expresses an opinion, which offends me; yet he is most agreeable and has a peculiarly sweet voice and a winning manner of asserting himself. The fact is, he is the kind of person I should expect to rescue one from a mad dog at any risk, but to insist upon a stoical indifference to the fright afterward.

In keeping with custom, Davis sought the permission of Howell&#x27;s parents before beginning a formal courtship. They initially disapproved of him due to the many differences in background, age, and politics. Davis was a Democrat and the Howells, including Varina, were Whigs. In her memoir, Varina Howell Davis wrote that her mother was concerned about Jefferson Davis&#x27;s excessive devotion to his relatives (particularly his older brother Joseph, who had largely raised him and upon whom he was financially dependent) and his near worship of his deceased first wife. The Howells ultimately consented to the courtship, and the couple became engaged shortly thereafter.

Their wedding was planned as a grand affair to be held at Hurricane Plantation during Christmas of 1844, but the wedding and engagement were cancelled shortly beforehand, for unknown reasons. In January 1845, while Howell was ill with a fever, Davis visited her frequently. They became engaged again. When they married on February 26, 1845, at her parents&#x27; house, a few relatives and friends of the bride attended, and none of the groom&#x27;s family.

Their short honeymoon included a visit to Davis&#x27;s aged mother, Jane Davis, and a visit to the grave of his first wife in Louisiana. The newlyweds took up residence at Brierfield, the plantation Davis had developed on loaned to him for his use by his brother Joseph Davis. Their first residence was a two-room cottage on the property and they started construction of a main house. It became a source of contention.

Soon after their marriage, Davis&#x27;s widowed and penniless sister, Amanda (Davis) Bradford, came to live on the Brierfield property along with her seven youngest children. Her brothers decided that she should share the large house which the Davises were building, but they had not consulted Varina Davis. It was an example of what she would later call interference from the Davis family in her life with her husband. Additionally, her brother-in-law Joseph Davis proved controlling, both of his brother, who was 23 years younger, and the even younger Varina – especially during her husband&#x27;s absences. At the same time, her parents became more financially dependent on the Davises, to her embarrassment and resentment. Their youngest son, born after her own marriage, was named Jefferson Davis Howell in her husband&#x27;s honor.

The couple had long periods of separation from early in their marriage, first as Jefferson Davis gave campaign speeches and &quot;politicked&quot; (or campaigned) for himself and for other Democratic candidates in the elections of 1846. He was also gone for extended periods during the Mexican War (1846–1848). Varina Davis was put under the guardianship of Joseph Davis, whom she had come to dislike intensely. Her correspondence with her husband during this time demonstrated her growing discontent, to which Jefferson was not particularly sympathetic.

==Urban life in Washington, DC==

Jefferson Davis was elected in 1846 to the U.S. House of Representatives and Varina accompanied him to Washington, D.C., which she loved. She was stimulated by the social life with intelligent people and was known for making &quot;unorthodox observations&quot;. Among them were that &quot;slaves were human beings with their frailties&quot; and that &quot;everyone was a &#x27;half breed&#x27; of one kind or another.&quot; She referred to herself as one because of her strong family connections in both North and South. The Davises lived in Washington, DC, for most of the next fifteen years before the American Civil War, which gave Varina Howell Davis a broader outlook than many Southerners. It was her favorite place to live. But, as an example of their many differences, her husband preferred life on their Mississippi plantation.

Soon he took leave from his Congressional position to serve as an officer in the Mexican–American War (1846–1848). Varina Davis returned for a time to Briarfield, where she chafed under the supervision of her brother-in-law, Joseph. The surviving correspondence between the Davises from this period expresses their difficulties and mutual resentments. After her husband&#x27;s return from the war, Varina Davis did not immediately accompany him to Washington when the Mississippi legislature appointed him to fill a Senate seat.

Ultimately, the couple reconciled. She rejoined her husband in Washington. He had unusual visibility for a freshman senator because of his connections as the son-in-law (by his late wife) and former junior officer of President Zachary Taylor. Varina Davis enjoyed the social life of the capital and quickly established herself as one of the city&#x27;s most popular (and, in her early 20s, one of the youngest) hostesses and party guests. The 1904 memoir of her contemporary, Virginia Clay-Clopton, described the lively parties of the Southern families in this period with other Congressional delegations, as well as international representatives of the diplomatic corps.

After seven childless years, in 1852, Varina Davis gave birth to a son, Samuel. Her letters from this period express her happiness and portray Jefferson as a doting father. The couple had a total of six children:
*Samuel Emory Davis, born July 30, 1852, named after his paternal grandfather; he died June 30, 1854, of an undiagnosed disease.
*Margaret Howell Davis, born February 25, 1855. She married Joel Addison Hayes, Jr. (1848–1919), and they lived first in Memphis, Tennessee; later they moved to Colorado Springs, Colorado. They had five children, including a daughter named after her mother; Margaret was the only Davis child to marry and raise a family. She married Joel Addison Hayes in Memphis on New Year&#x27;s Day, 1876. She, her husband, and family moved to Colorado Springs in 1885, where they soon became leading members of local society. Many of J. Addison and Margaret Hayes&#x27; descendants still reside in the area. She died on July 18, 1909, at the age of 54 and is buried with the Davis family at Hollywood Cemetery in Richmond, Virginia.
*Jefferson Davis, Jr., born January 16, 1857. He died in Memphis, Tennessee, of yellow fever at age 21 on October 16, 1878, during an epidemic in the Mississippi River Valley that caused 20,000 deaths.
*Joseph Evan Davis, born on April 18, 1859, died at the age of five due to an accidental fall on April 30, 1864.
*William Howell Davis, born on December 6, 1861, was named for Varina&#x27;s father; he died of diphtheria on October 16, 1872.
*Varina Anne &quot;Winnie&quot; Davis was born on June 27, 1864, two months after Joseph&#x27;s death. Known as the &quot;Daughter of the Confederacy&quot;, she died at age 34 on September 18, 1898, of gastritis. After her parents had opposed her marriage in the late 1880s to a man from a Northern, abolitionist family, she never married.

The Davises were devastated in 1854 when their first child died before the age of two. Varina Davis largely withdrew from social life for a time. In 1855, she gave birth to a healthy daughter, Margaret (1855–1909); followed by two sons, Jefferson, Jr., (1857–1878) and Joseph (1859–1864), during her husband&#x27;s remaining tenure in Washington, D.C. The early losses of all four of their sons caused enormous grief to both the Davises.

During the Pierce Administration, Davis was appointed to the post of Secretary of War. He and President Franklin Pierce also formed a personal friendship that would last for the rest of Pierce&#x27;s life. Their wives developed a strong respect, as well. The Pierces lost their last surviving child, Benny, shortly before his father&#x27;s inauguration. They both suffered; Pierce became dependent on alcohol and Jane Appleton Pierce had health problems, including depression. At the request of the Pierces, the Davises, both individually and as a couple, often served as official hosts at White House functions in place of the President and his wife.

According to diarist Mary Boykin Chesnut, in 1860 Mrs. Davis &quot;sadly&quot; told a friend &quot;The South will secede if Lincoln is made president. They will make Mr. Davis President of the Southern side. And the whole thing is bound to be a failure.&quot;

==Confederate First Lady==

Jefferson Davis resigned from the U.S. Senate in 1861 when Mississippi seceded. Varina Davis returned with their children to Brierfield, expecting him to be commissioned as a general in the Confederate army. He was elected as President of the Confederate States of America by the new Confederate Congress. She did not accompany him when he traveled to Montgomery, Alabama (then capital of the new country) to be inaugurated. A few weeks later, she followed and assumed official duties as the First Lady of the Confederacy.

Davis greeted the war with dread, supporting the Confederacy but not slavery. She was known to have said that:

the South did not have the material resources to win the war and white Southerners did not have the qualities necessary to win it; that her husband was unsuited for political life; that maybe women were not the inferior sex; and that perhaps it was a mistake to deny women the suffrage before the war.

In the summer of 1861, Davis and her husband moved to Richmond, Virginia, the new capital of the Confederacy. They lived in a house which would come to be known as the White House of the Confederacy for the remainder of war (1861–1865). &quot;She tried intermittently to do what was expected of her, but she never convinced people that her heart was in it, and her tenure as First Lady was for the most part a disaster,&quot; as the people picked up on her ambivalence. White residents of Richmond criticized Varina Davis freely; some described her appearance as resembling &quot;a mulatto or an Indian &#x27;squaw&#x27;.&quot;

In December 1861, she gave birth to their fifth child, William. Due to her husband&#x27;s influence, her father William Howell received several low-level appointments in the Confederate bureaucracy which helped support him. The social turbulence of the war years reached the Presidential mansion; in 1864, several of the Davises&#x27; domestic slaves escaped. James Dennison and his wife, Betsey, who had served as Varina&#x27;s maid, used saved back pay of 80 gold dollars to finance their escape. Henry, a butler, left one night after allegedly building a fire in the mansion&#x27;s basement to divert attention.

In spring 1864, five-year-old Joseph Davis died in a fall from the porch at the Presidential mansion in Richmond. A few weeks later, Varina gave birth to their last child, a girl named Varina Anne Davis, who was called &quot;Winnie&quot;. The girl became known to the public as &quot;the Daughter of the Confederacy;&quot; stories about and likenesses of her were distributed throughout the Confederacy during the last year of the war to raise morale. She retained the nickname for the rest of her life.

==Postwar==

When the war ended, the Davises fled South seeking to escape to Europe. They were captured by federal troops and Jefferson Davis was imprisoned at Fort Monroe in Phoebus, Virginia, for two years. Left indigent, Varina Davis was restricted to residing in the state of Georgia, where her husband had been arrested. Fearing for the safety of their older children, she sent them to friends in Canada under the care of relatives and a family servant. Initially forbidden to have any contact with her husband, Davis worked tirelessly to secure his release. She tried to raise awareness of and sympathy for what she perceived as his unjust incarceration.

After a few months Varina Davis was allowed to correspond with him. Articles and a book on his confinement helped turn public opinion in his favor. Davis and young Winnie were allowed to join Jefferson in his prison cell. The family was eventually given a more comfortable apartment in the officers&#x27; quarters of the fort.

Although released on bail and never tried for treason, Jefferson Davis had temporarily lost his home in Mississippi, most of his wealth, and his U.S. citizenship. In the late 20th century, his citizenship was posthumously restored by then President Carter. The small Davis family traveled constantly in Europe and Canada as he sought work to rebuild his fortunes. Davis accepted the presidency of an insurance agency headquartered in Memphis. The family began to regain some financial comfort until the Panic of 1873, when his company was one of many that went bankrupt. In 1872 their son William Davis died of typhoid fever, adding to their emotional burdens.

While visiting their daughters enrolled in boarding schools in Europe, Jefferson Davis received a commission as an agent for an English consortium seeking to purchase cotton from the southern United States. He returned to the US for this work. Varina Davis remained in England to visit her sister who had recently moved there, and stayed for several months. The surviving correspondence suggests her stay may have been prompted by renewed marital difficulties. Both the Davises suffered from depression due to the loss of their sons and their fortunes.

She resented his attentions to other women, particularly Virginia Clay. Clay was the wife of their friend, former senator Clement Clay, a fellow political prisoner at Fort Monroe. During this period, Davis exchanged passionate letters with Virginia Clay for three years and is believed to have loved her. In 1871 Davis was reported as having been seen on a train &quot;with a woman not his wife&quot;, and it made national newspapers. Still in England, Varina was outraged.

For several years, the Davises lived apart far more than they lived together. Davis was unemployed for most of the years after the war. In 1877 he was ill and nearly bankrupt. Advised to take a home near the sea for his health, he accepted an invitation from Sarah Anne Ellis Dorsey, a widowed heiress, to visit her summer cottage Beauvoir on the Mississippi Sound in Biloxi. A classmate of Varina in Philadelphia, Dorsey had become a respected novelist and historian, and had traveled extensively. She arranged for Davis to use a cottage on the grounds of her plantation. There she helped him organize and write his memoir of the Confederacy, in part by her active encouragement. She also invited Varina Davis to stay with her.

Davis and her eldest daughter, Margaret Howell Hayes, disapproved of her husband&#x27;s friendship with Dorsey. After Varina Davis returned to the United States, she lived in Memphis with Margaret and her family for a time. Gradually she began a reconciliation with her husband. She was with him at Beauvoir in 1878 when they learned that their last surviving son, Jefferson Davis, Jr., had died during a yellow fever epidemic in Memphis. That year 20,000 people died throughout the South in the epidemic. During her grieving, Varina became friends again with Dorsey.

Sarah Dorsey was determined to help support the former president; she offered to sell him her house for a reasonable price. Learning she had breast cancer, Dorsey made over her will to leave Jefferson Davis free title to the home, as well as much of the remainder of her financial estate. Her Percy relatives were unsuccessful in challenging the will.

Her bequest provided Davis with enough financial security to provide for Varina and Winnie, and to enjoy some comfort with them in his final years. When Winnie Davis completed her education, she joined her parents at Beauvoir. She had fallen in love when at college, but her parents disapproved. Her father objected to his being from &quot;a prominent Yankee and abolitionist family&quot; and her mother to his lack of money and being burdened by many debts. Forced to reject this man, Winnie never married.

Dorsey&#x27;s bequest made Winnie Davis the heiress after Jefferson Davis died in 1889. In 1891, Varina and Winnie moved to New York City. After Winnie died in 1898, she was buried next to her father in Richmond, Virginia. Varina Davis inherited Beauvoir.

==Widow==
After her husband died, Varina Howell Davis completed his autobiography, publishing it in 1890 as &quot;Jefferson Davis, A Memoir&quot;. At first the book sold few copies, dashing her hopes of earning some income.

Kate Davis Pulitzer, a distant cousin of Jefferson Davis and the wife of Joseph Pulitzer, a major newspaper publisher in New York, had met Varina Davis during a visit to the South. She solicited short articles from her for her husband&#x27;s newspaper, the &quot;New York World&quot;. In 1891 Varina Davis accepted the Pulitzers&#x27; offer to become a full-time columnist and moved to New York City with her daughter Winnie. They enjoyed the busy life of the city. White Southerners attacked Davis for this move to the North, as she was considered a public figure of the Confederacy whom they claimed for their own.

As Davis and her daughter each worked at literary careers, they lived in a series of residential hotels in New York City. (Their longest residency was at the Hotel Gerard at 123 W. 44th Street.) Varina Davis wrote many articles for the newspaper, and Winnie Davis published several novels.

After Winnie died in 1898, Varina Davis inherited Beauvoir. In October 1902, she sold the plantation to the Mississippi Division of the Sons of Confederate Veterans for $10,000 (~$ in ). She stipulated the facility was to be used as a Confederate veterans&#x27; home and later as a memorial to her husband. The SCV built barracks on the site, and housed thousands of veterans and their families. The plantation was used for years as a veterans&#x27; home.

Since 1953 the house has been operated as a museum to Davis. Beauvoir has been designated a National Historic Landmark. The main house has been restored and a museum built there, housing the Jefferson Davis Presidential Library.

Varina Howell Davis was one of numerous influential Southerners who moved to the North for work after the war; they were nicknamed &quot;Confederate carpetbaggers&quot;.

In the postwar years of reconciliation, Davis became friends with Julia Dent Grant, the widow of former general and president Ulysses S. Grant, who had been among the most hated men in the South. She attended a reception where she met Booker T. Washington, head of the Tuskegee Institute, then a black college. In her old age, Davis published some of her observations and &quot;declared in print that the right side had won the Civil War.&quot;

===Later years===

Although saddened by the death of her daughter Winnie in 1898 (the fifth / last of her six children to predecease her), Davis continued to write for the &quot;World&quot;. She enjoyed a daily ride in a carriage through Central Park. 

She was active socially until poor health in her final years forced her retirement from work and any sort of public life. Davis died at age 80 of double pneumonia in her room at the Hotel Majestic on October 16, 1906. She was survived by her daughter Margaret Davis Hayes and several grandchildren and great-grandchildren.

==Legacy and honors==

Varina Howell Davis received a funeral procession through the streets of New York City. Her coffin was taken by train to Richmond, accompanied by the Reverend Nathan A. Seagle, Rector of Saint Stephen&#x27;s Protestant Episcopal Church, New York City which Davis attended. She was interred with full honors by Confederate veterans at Hollywood Cemetery and was buried adjacent to the tombs of her husband and their daughter Winnie.

A portrait of Mrs. Davis, titled the &quot;Widow of the Confederacy&quot; (1895), was painted by the Swiss-born American artist Adolfo Müller-Ury (1862–1947). It is held at the museum at Beauvoir. In 1918 Müller-Ury donated his profile portrait of her daughter, Winnie Davis, painted in 1897–1898, to the Museum of the Confederacy in Richmond, Virginia.

On August 29, 2005, Hurricane Katrina caused extensive wind and water damage to Beauvoir, which houses the Jefferson Davis Presidential Library. The home was restored and reopened on June 3, 2008. Varina Howell Davis&#x27;s diamond and emerald wedding ring, one of the few valuable possessions she was able to retain through years of poverty, was held by the Museum at Beauvoir and lost during the destruction of Hurricane Katrina. It was discovered on the grounds a few months later and returned to the museum.

<text>Postage stamps and postal history of the United Kingdom surveys postal history and the postage stamps issued by that country (known in philatelic circles as &quot;Great Britain&quot;), and its various historical territories until the present day.

The postal history of the United Kingdom is notable in at least two respects: first, for the introduction of postage stamps in 1840, and secondly for the establishment of an efficient postal system throughout the British Empire, laying the foundation of many national systems still in existence today. As the originator of postage stamps, the UK is the only country that does not need to specify the country on its stamps, but only the denomination.

As they are protected by copyright, images of current UK stamps are not included in this article.

== Early history ==

In the 12th century Henry I appointed messengers to carry letters for the government. It is estimated that between 1100 and 1135, 4,500 letters were carried by these messengers. During this time, private individuals had to make their own arrangements. Henry III provided uniforms for the messengers, and Edward I instituted posting houses where the messengers could change horses. The reign of Edward II saw the first postal marking; handwritten notations saying &quot;Haste. Post haste&quot;. Centuries later, during the reign of Elizabeth I to express an extreme degree of urgency of delivery, gallows were drawn on the letter, known as Gallows letters and may additionally have a version of &quot;haste, post haste&quot; added.
Henry VIII created the Royal Mail in 1516, appointing Brian Tuke as &quot;Master of the Postes&quot;, while Elizabeth I appointed Thomas Randolph as &quot;Chief Postmaster&quot;. Under Thomas Witherings, chief postmaster under Charles I, the Royal Mail was made available to the public (1635), with a regular system of post roads, houses, and staff. From this time through to the postal reforms of 1839–1840 it was most common for the recipient to pay the postage, although it was generally optional to prepay the charge within the British Isles.

In 1661, Charles II made Henry Bishop the first Postmaster General. In answer to customer complaints about delayed letters, Bishop introduced the Bishop mark, a small circle with month and day inside, applied at London, in the General Post office and the Foreign section, and soon after adopted in Scotland, (Edinburgh), and Ireland, (Dublin). In subsequent years, the postal system expanded from six roads to a network covering the country, and post offices were set up in both large and small towns, each of which had its own postmark.

In 1680 William Dockwra established the London Penny Post, a mail delivery system that delivered letters and parcels weighing up to one pound within the city of London and some of its immediate suburbs for the sum of one penny.

== Postage stamps and The Great Office Reform ==
The Great Post Office Reforms of 1839 and 1840 were championed by Rowland Hill, who is often credited with the invention of the postage stamp, as a way to reverse the steady financial losses of the Post Office. Hill convinced Parliament to adopt the Uniform Fourpenny Post whereby a flat 4d per half ounce rate (equivalent to 10s 8d per pound for heavier items) was charged regardless of distance.

From December 1839, letters could arrive at any address in the United Kingdom. The flat postage rate went into effect on 5 December 1839 but only lasted for 36 days. This was immediately successful, and on 10 January 1840 the Uniform Penny Post started, charging only 1d for prepaid letters and 2d if the fee was collected from the recipient. Fixed rates meant that it was practical to avoid handling money to send a letter by using an &quot;adhesive label&quot;, and accordingly, on 6 May, the Penny Black became the world&#x27;s first postage stamp in use.

After more than 2,000 suggestions were submitted, Rowland Hill chose the method and printer, and worked by trial and error to achieve the required result. He decided to go with Perkins, Bacon &amp; Petch, &quot;a firm of bank-note printers, to carry out the work by the process of steel engraving, and the head of the Queen as engraved by William Wyon for a special medal struck to celebrate Her Majesty&#x27;s official visit to the City of London in the year of her Coronation.&quot;

The stamp was originally for use only within the United Kingdom of Great Britain and Ireland and as such was, in effect, a local stamp. For this reason the name of the country was not included within the design, a situation which continued by agreement with foreign post offices, provided the sovereign&#x27;s effigy appeared on the stamp. Envelopes sold with postage paid did not include this, so were marked with the country&#x27;s name. In 1951, the special commemorative issue for the Festival of Britain included the name &quot;Britain&quot; incidentally. It could therefore be said that the name of the country then appeared for the first time on a stamp of the UK, although the word &quot;British&quot; had appeared on British Empire Exhibition commemorative stamps of 1924.

After the stamp was circulating, it became obvious that black was not a good choice of stamp colour, since any cancellation marks were hard to see. So, from 1841, the stamps were printed in a brick-red colour. The Penny Reds continued in use for decades with about 21 billion being produced.

== Victorian era ==
The Victorian age saw an explosion of experimentation. The inefficiency of using scissors to cut stamps from the sheet inspired trials with rouletting (the Archer Roulette), and then with perforation, which became standard practice in 1854. In 1847, the (octagonal) 1 shilling (£0.05) became the first of the British embossed postage stamps to be issued, followed by 10d stamps the following year, and 6d (£0.025) values in 1854.

Surface-printed stamps first appeared in the form of a 4d stamp in 1855, printed by De La Rue, and subsequently became the standard type. d (halfpenny) and d (penny halfpenny – pronounced pennyhaypny or threehaypence) engraved stamps issued in 1870 were the last engraved types of Queen Victoria; the next would not appear until 1913. Surface-printed stamps of the 1860s and 1870s all used the same profile of Victoria, but a variety of frames, watermarks, and corner lettering.

A 5-shilling (abbreviated as 5/- or 5s) (£0.25) stamp first appeared in 1867, followed by 10 shilling (£0.50) and £1 values in 1878, culminating in a £5 stamp in 1882.

Meanwhile, the age of the Penny Reds had come to an end along with the Perkins Bacon printing contract. The new low values were also surface-printed: first was a penny stamp coloured Venetian red in a square frame, issued in 1880. However, the passage of the Customs and Inland Revenue Act 1881 necessitated new stamps valid also as revenue stamps, and so the Penny Lilac was issued in that year, inscribed &quot;POSTAGE AND INLAND REVENUE&quot;. This stamp remained the standard letter stamp for the remainder of Victoria&#x27;s reign, and vast quantities were printed. Later issues were inscribed POSTAGE &amp; REVENUE which became the more familiar POSTAGE REVENUE.

1883 and 1884 saw experimentation with stamps using fugitive inks with the &#x27;Lilac and Green Issue&#x27;. These were rather plain designs, low values in lilac and high values in green, because those were the only colours available. They succeeded in their purpose – relatively few of the stamps survived usage, their colours fading away when soaked from the envelope – but they were not liked by the public.

The last major issue of Victoria was the &quot;Jubilee issue&quot; of 1887, a set of twelve designs ranging from d to 1s, most printed in two colours or on coloured paper. (Although issued during the Jubilee year, they were not issued specifically for the occasion, and are thus not commemoratives.)

British colonies such as Barbados, Nevis, Fiji, Trinidad, British Guiana, and India at one time all used the William Wyon portrait of Queen Victoria on their stamps. Many formerly colonised countries whose head of state is the British monarch still include the monarch&#x27;s profile, although some have branched out to stamps depicting scenery, birds or beasts without the profile.
== Early 20th century ==

When Edward VII succeeded to the throne, new stamps became necessary. The approach was very conservative, however most of the Jubilee frames were reused and the image of the King was still a single profile. Edward&#x27;s reign was fairly short and there were no major changes of design as a result. Chalk-surfaced paper was introduced during this time (this type of paper can be detected by rubbing the surface with silver, which leaves a black mark).

By contrast, the stamps of George V were innovative from the very first. The first issue made was of the d and 1d values, which were in the same colours as used in the previous reign. Although the main design feature remained the same – a central ellipse for the portrait, an ornamental frame, value tablet at the base and a crown at the top – a three quarter portrait was used for the first time. However, subsequent designs reverted to the standard profile.

The UK&#x27;s first commemorative stamps were issued for the British Empire Exhibition in 1924. The pair of large-format stamps featured a lion in an imposing stance; they were issued twice, in 1924 and then in 1925, the stamps of each year being inscribed with the year of issue. A second set of commemoratives in 1929 marked the 9th Congress of the Universal Postal Union (UPU), held in London that year.
===Independence of the Irish Free State===
Following the Anglo-Irish Treaty of 1921, responsibility for posts and telegraphs in what was initially called Southern Ireland transferred to the new Provisional Government. Upon the formal independence of the Irish Free State in December 1922, tha responsibility transferred to the Free State Government. A Postmaster General was initially appointed by the Free State Government, being replaced by the office of Minister for Posts and Telegraphs in 1924. An early visible manifestation was the repainting of all post boxes green instead of red, plus the overprinting of British postage stamps prior to the introduction of Irish stamps.
== Abdication and war ==
A set of four stamps was issued in 1936 for Edward VIII before he abdicated. George VI&#x27;s coronation was marked with a commemorative: part of an omnibus issue which included every colony in the Empire. New definitives featured a profile of the King on a solid colour background, based on a plaster cast by Edmund Dulac. This was a precursor of the Machins three decades later: see below.

The centenary of the postage stamp was celebrated in 1940 with a set of six stamps depicting Victoria and George VI side by side. By the following year, wartime exigencies affected stamp printing, with the 1937 stamps being printed with less ink, resulting in significantly lighter shades. Post-war issues included commemoratives for the return of peace, the Silver Jubilee and the 1948 Summer Olympics in 1948, and the 75th anniversary of the UPU, in 1949.

In 1950 the colours of all the low values were changed. 1951 saw a new series of high values (2s 6d, 5s, 10s, £1), and two commemoratives for the Festival of Britain.
== Modern era ==

When Elizabeth II succeeded her father in 1952, new stamps were needed. A collection of variations on a theme that came to be known as the Wilding issues, based on a portrait of Queen Elizabeth II, was the result. This portrait was by photographer Dorothy Wilding.

The first Wildings, ½d and 2½d, were issued on 5 December 1952 and the series was used until 1967, when the Machin issues were introduced on 5 June. The Machin design is very simple, a profile of the Queen on a solid colour background, and very popular, still being the standard British stamp. They have been printed in scores of different colours; in addition, decimalisation required new denominations, and there have been technical improvements in the printing process, resulting in literally hundreds of varieties known to specialists. Special Stamps with pictures, and Christmas Stamps are also produced; they bear a small profile silhouette of the monarch.

First- and second-class postage was introduced in 1968. In 1989, Non-Value Indicated (NVI) stamps were produced marked &quot;1st&quot; and &quot;2nd&quot;, valid for the lowest weight of that class. Either a &quot;class&quot; stamp can be used, or denominated stamps to the value of the postage. &quot;Class&quot; stamps remain valid for the stated class even after price increases. When letter size in addition to weight came into use to determine postage, additional &quot;large letter&quot; 1st and 2nd class stamps were added.

For over a century gummed stamps were produced in sheets, perforated so that individual stamps could be detached. From 2001, many stamps became self-adhesive, without perforations.

When Royal Mail was privatised in 2013, it retained the power to issue Britain&#x27;s stamps.

Until 2022 any postage stamps since the 1971 decimalisation of British currency could be used; old &quot;definitive&quot; design stamps without barcodes were no longer be valid from 1 August 2023, with old ones exchangeable for barcoded ones indefinitely. It was initially announced that stamps without barcodes would not be valid from 1 February 2023. However, Royal Mail decided to add an additional six month grace period. Special stamps with pictures and Christmas stamps without a barcode will remain valid.

UK stamps bearing the head of Charles III became available on 4 April 2023. Unlike previous stamps depicting male monarchs, the new set features no crowns or any other decorations.

== Design trends of British stamps ==

Up to the 1950s, British commemorative stamps were few and far between; most of the stamps were what are officially called &quot;definitives&quot;, in which the portrait of the reigning monarch was the dominant element. Even after commemorative stamps began to appear more often during the 1950s and early 1960s, the monarch&#x27;s effigy was prominent, usually taking up a quarter to a third of the stamp&#x27;s design, which limited flexibility and creativity. A change came in 1965 when the then Postmaster General Tony Benn issued new criteria for what could appear on stamps. Designer David Gentleman wrote to Benn about alternative design approaches, suggesting the monarch&#x27;s head be replaced by another national symbol, such as a crown or the country name; &quot;Great Britain&quot; or &quot;United Kingdom&quot;. A compromise, a small silhouette of the Queen based on the coinage head of Mary Gillick, was accepted and this has been the standard ever since for commemorative stamps. When the monarch&#x27;s portrait is part of the stamp&#x27;s main design (as for example in the case of issues commemorating the Queen&#x27;s birthday), then the silhouette is not needed and usually does not appear.

In 1967, &quot;The Red Boy&quot; by Sir Thomas Lawrence became the first artwork to appear on a British postage stamp.

Another trend is the growing use of stamps to commemorate events related to the present Royal Family. Up to Elizabeth II&#x27;s accession in 1952 the only commemorative stamps to have been issued related to royal events were for George V&#x27;s Silver Jubilee in 1935, George VI&#x27;s coronation in 1937, and a 1948 issue to commemorate George VI&#x27;s 25th wedding anniversary. Since 1952, however, stamps have been issued to commemorate many royal occasions. In addition, memorial stamps have been issued after the deaths of Diana, Princess of Wales (in 1998) and Queen Elizabeth The Queen Mother (in 2002).

With regard to previous monarchs, stamps were issued in 1987 to mark the 150th anniversary of Queen Victoria&#x27;s accession, and in 1997 to mark the 450th anniversary of King Henry VIII&#x27;s death. From 2008 to 2011 stamps were issued featuring all of England&#x27;s kings and queens and also the Scottish House of Stewart.

In February 2022 new barcoded &quot;definitive design&quot; stamps were introduced. The rectangular (matrix) codes, unique to each stamp, use a trademarked coding designed to prevent counterfeiting and to enable tracking of letters, and to enable correspondents to link digital content to their stamps. Until 2022 any 1st and 2nd class and decimal currency postage stamps could be used; old Machin and country definitive design stamps without barcodes are no longer valid from 31 July 2023, with old ones exchangeable for barcoded ones indefinitely through a process which Royal Mail calls the &quot;Stamp Swap Out scheme&quot;. Special stamps with pictures and Christmas stamps without a barcode continued to be valid. Stamps are exchanged like-for-like: a &quot;1st class&quot; stamp will be replaced by a 1st class one, not 95p.

==Country definitives ==

Beginning in 1958, counry definitives (initially known as regional issues) were introduced in the Channel Islands, the Isle of Man, Northern Ireland, Scotland and Wales. England-specific issues were added later, starting wth the World Cup – England Winners commemorative stamp in 1966. While these issues are only sold at post offices in the respective countries, the English, Northern Irish, Scottish and Welsh issues are valid throughout the United Kingdom. The Channel Islands (since 1969) and Isle of Man (since 1973) now issue their own stamps which are not valid anywhere else.

==British postal services abroad==

The United Kingdom has introduced postal services throughout the world and has often made use of British definitives bearing local overprints.

<text>A broadcast flag is a bit field sent in the data stream of a digital television program that indicates whether or not the data stream can be recorded, or if there are any restrictions on recorded content. Possible restrictions include the inability to save an unencrypted digital program to a hard disk or other non-volatile storage, inability to make secondary copies of recorded content (in order to share or archive), forceful reduction of quality when recording (such as reducing high-definition video to the resolution of standard TVs), and inability to skip over commercials.

In the United States, new television receivers using the ATSC standard were supposed to incorporate this functionality by July 1, 2005. The requirement was successfully contested in 2005 and rescinded in 2011.

== FCC ruling ==
Officially called &quot;Digital Broadcast Television Redistribution Control,&quot; the FCC&#x27;s rule is in 47 CFR 73.9002(b) and the following sections, stating in part: &quot;No party shall sell or distribute in interstate commerce a Covered Demodulator Product that does not comply with the Demodulator Compliance Requirements and Demodulator Robustness Requirements.&quot; According to the rule, hardware must &quot;actively thwart&quot; piracy.

The rule&#x27;s Demodulator Compliance Requirements insists that all HDTV demodulators must &quot;listen&quot; for the flag (or assume it to be present in all signals). Flagged content must be output only to &quot;protected outputs&quot; (such as DVI and HDMI ports with HDCP encryption), or in degraded form through analog outputs or digital outputs with visual resolution of 720x480 pixels (EDTV) or less. Flagged content may be recorded only by &quot;authorized&quot; methods, which may include tethering of recordings to a single device.

Since broadcast flags could be activated at any time, a viewer who often records a program might suddenly find that it is no longer possible to save their favorite show. This and other reasons lead many to see the flags as a direct affront to consumer rights.

The Demodulator Robustness Requirements are difficult to implement in open source systems. Devices must be &quot;robust&quot; against user access or modifications so that someone could not easily alter it to ignore the broadcast flags that permit access to the full digital stream. Since open-source device drivers are by design user-modifiable, a PC TV tuner card with open-source drivers would not be &quot;robust&quot;.

The GNU Radio project already successfully demonstrated that purely software-based demodulators can exist and the hardware rule is not fully enforceable.

== Current status ==
In &quot;American Library Association v. FCC&quot;, 406 F.3d 689 (D.C. Cir. 2005), the United States Court of Appeals for the D.C. Circuit ruled that the FCC had exceeded its authority in creating this rule. The court stated that the Commission could not prohibit the manufacture of computer or video hardware without copy-protection technology because the FCC only has authority to regulate transmissions, not devices that receive communications. While it is always possible that the Supreme Court could overturn this ruling, the more likely reemergence of the broadcast flag is in legislation granting such authority to the FCC.

On May 1, 2006, Sen. Ted Stevens inserted a version of the Broadcast Flag into the Communications, Consumer&#x27;s Choice, and Broadband Deployment Act of 2006. On June 22, 2006 Sen. John E. Sununu offered an amendment to strike the broadcast and radio flag, but this failed and the broadcast-flag amendment was approved by the Commerce committee. Nonetheless, the overall bill was never passed, and thus died upon adjournment of the 109th Congress in December 2006.

On May 18, 2008, News.com reported that Microsoft had confirmed that current versions of Windows Media Center shipping with the Windows family of operating systems adhered to the use of the broadcast flag, following reports of users being blocked from taping specific airings of NBC programs, mainly &quot;American Gladiators&quot; and &quot;Medium&quot;. A Microsoft spokesperson said that Windows Media Center adheres to the &quot;rules set forth by the FCC&quot;.

On August 22, 2011, the FCC officially eliminated the broadcast flag regulations.

=== Radio broadcast flag and RIAA ===
With the coming of digital radio, the recording industry is attempting to change the ground rules for copyright of songs played on radio. Currently, over the air (i.e. broadcast but not Internet) radio stations may play songs freely but RIAA wants Congress to insert a radio broadcast flag. On April 26, 2006, Congress held a hearing over the radio broadcast flag. Among the witnesses were musicians Anita Baker and Todd Rundgren.

=== European Broadcast Flag ===
At present no equivalent signal is typically used in European DVB transmissions, although DVB-CPCM would provide such a set of signal as defined by DVB-SI, usable on clear-to-air television broadcasts. How adherence to such a system would be enforced in a receiver is not yet clear.

In the UK, the BBC introduced content protection restrictions in 2010 on Free to Air content by licensing data necessary to receive the service information for the Freeview HD broadcasts. However the BBC have stated the highest protection applied will be to allow only one copy to be made.

=== ISDB ===
ISDB broadcasts are protected as to allow the broadcast to be digitally recorded once, but to not allow digital copies of the recording to be made. Analog recordings can be copied freely. It is possible to disallow the use of analog outputs, although this has yet to be implemented. The protection can be circumvented with the correct hardware and software.

=== DVB-CPCM ===
The Digital Video Broadcasting organization is developing DVB-CPCM which allows broadcasters (especially PayTV broadcaster) far more control over the use of content on (and beyond) home networks. The DVB standards are commonly used in Europe and around the world (for satellite, terrestrial, and cable distribution), but are also employed in the United States by Dish Network. In Europe, some entertainment companies were lobbying to legally mandate the use of DVB-CPCM. Opponents fear that mandating DVB-CPCM will kill independent receiver manufacturers that use open source operating systems (e.g., Linux-based set-top boxes.)

=== Pay-per-view use of broadcast flag ===
In the US, since April 15, 2008, pay-per-view movies on cable and satellite television now are flagged to prevent a recording off a pay-per-view channel to a digital video recorders or other related devices from being retained after 24 hours from the ordered time of the film. This is the standard film industry practice, including for digital rentals from the iTunes Store and Google Play. Movies recorded before that point would still be available without flagging and could be copied freely, though as of 2015 those pre-2008 DVR units are well out-of-date or probably non-functional, and the pay-per-view concern is moot for all but special events, as nearly all satellite providers and cable providers have moved to more easily restricted video on demand platforms; pay-per-view films have been drawn down to non-notable content.

<text>Christopher Samuel Bond (born March 6, 1939) is an American attorney, politician and former United States Senator from Missouri and a member of the Republican Party. First elected to the U.S. Senate in 1986, he defeated Democrat Harriett Woods by a margin of 53–47%. He was re-elected in 1992, 1998, and 2004. On January 8, 2009, he announced that he would not seek re-election to a fifth term in 2010, and was succeeded by fellow Republican Roy Blunt on January 3, 2011. Following his retirement from the Senate, Bond became a partner at Thompson Coburn.

Before beginning his 24-year-long career in the U.S. Senate, Bond served two non-consecutive terms as Governor of Missouri, from 1973 to 1977 and from 1981 to 1985. He was previously State Auditor of Missouri from 1971 to 1973.

==Early life, education, and law career==
A sixth-generation Missourian, Bond was born in St. Louis, Missouri, the son of Elizabeth (née Green) and Arthur D. Bond. His father was captain of the 1924 Missouri Tigers football team and a Rhodes Scholar. His maternal grandfather, A.P. Green, founded A.P. Green Industries, a fireclay manufacturer and a major employer for many years in Bond&#x27;s hometown Mexico, Missouri. He was the benefactor and namesake of A. P. Green Chapel at the University of Missouri.

Bond graduated from Deerfield Academy in 1956 and then attended Princeton University and graduated in 1960 with an A.B. from the Woodrow Wilson School of Public and International Affairs. He completed a 162-page senior thesis that year titled &quot;Missouri Farm Organizations and the Problems of Agriculture&quot;. While a student at Princeton, Bond was a member of the Quadrangle Club. He graduated first in his class from the University of Virginia School of Law in 1963 with a J.D.

Bond served as a law clerk (1963–64) to the Honorable Elbert Tuttle, then Chief Judge on the United States Court of Appeals for the Fifth Circuit in Atlanta, Georgia. Bond practiced law (1964–67) at Covington &amp; Burling in Washington, D.C.

==Early political career==

Bond moved back to his hometown of Mexico, Missouri in the fall of 1967, and ran for Congress in 1968 in Missouri&#x27;s 9th congressional district, the rural northeastern part of the state. He defeated Anthony Schroeder in the August Republican primary, 56% to 44%, winning 19 of the district&#x27;s 23 counties.

In the November general election, Bond came close to defeating incumbent Democratic U.S. Congressman Bill Hungate, 48% to 52%. Bond won eight of the district&#x27;s 23 counties. Out of Hungate&#x27;s five re-election campaigns, that 1968 election against Bond was his worst performance.

State Attorney General John Danforth hired Bond as an Assistant Attorney General in 1969, where Bond led the office&#x27;s Consumer Protection Division. In 1970, at the age of 31, Bond was elected Missouri State Auditor, defeating seventeen-year incumbent Haskell Holman. As auditor, Bond hired seven certified public accountants to the office, which increased the total from one.

==Governor of Missouri==

In 1972, Bond was elected governor of Missouri by a margin of 55% to 45%, making him, at 33 years of age, the youngest governor in the history of Missouri. Bond was the first Republican in 28 years to serve as governor of Missouri.

Bond&#x27;s residency qualifications to be governor were challenged but were upheld by the Missouri Supreme Court in 1972. Missouri law said the governor had to be a resident for 10 years. In the 10 years before his run, he had attended law school in Virginia, clerked for a federal appeals court judge in Atlanta, worked for a firm in Washington, D.C., applied to take the bar in Virginia and Georgia, registered a car in Washington, D.C., and applied for a marriage license in Kentucky. The Court sided with him, commenting that residence &quot;is largely a matter of intention&quot; and did not require &quot;actual, physical presence&quot;. The court ruled a residence was &quot;that place where a man has his true, fixed and permanent home and principal establishment, and to which whenever he is absent he has the intention of returning.&quot;

In many ways, Bond governed as a moderate during his first term as governor: for example, he drew criticism from conservatives for his support of the Equal Rights Amendment. On June 25, 1976, he signed an executive order rescinding the Extermination Order against Mormons issued by Governor Lilburn Boggs on October 27, 1838.

During the 1976 United States presidential election, Bond endorsed Gerald Ford over Ronald Reagan in the Republican primaries, a move which drew the ire of some Missouri Republicans. Bond was on the short list to be Ford’s vice-presidential running mate.

In 1976, Bond faced Jackson County Prosecutor Joseph P. Teasdale. Bond appeared the heavy favorite, and at least one poll showed Bond ahead of Teasdale 51 percent to 36 percent. However, Teasdale attacked Bond over utility rates and launched an ad blitz attacking Bond, vastly outspending him in the last few weeks. Teasdale would defeat Bond by a little over 13,000 votes. Bond would later say of his loss: &quot;I didn&#x27;t answer his negative attacks and instead I tried to talk about the 50 good things we had accomplished. And the voters ... gave me four years to think about it.&quot; Afterwards, Bond returned to practicing law, setting up the Great Plains Legal Foundation, a group which fought agriculture regulations.

In 1980, Bond made a successful comeback, defeating fellow Republican and incumbent Lieutenant Governor Bill Phelps in the primary, and Teasdale in November. His second term had been plagued by budget issues, with the Missouri commissioner of administration Stephen Bradford telling Bond during the transition period: &quot;Governor, I&#x27;m sorry to tell you this, but there&#x27;s no money.&quot; Among Bond&#x27;s most noted accomplishments was helping take the Parents As Teachers program statewide. Bond served as the Chairman of the Midwestern Governors Association in 1983. Bond was succeeded as governor in 1985 by John Ashcroft, a Republican who Bond had appointed to complete his unexpired term as State Auditor after he was elected governor. Ashcroft later served alongside Bond in the Senate.

==U.S. Senate==
===Elections===
After Senator Thomas Eagleton decided not to run for re-election, Bond was elected senator in 1986, defeating Lieutenant Governor Harriett Woods by 53% to 47% . Bond was re-elected in 1992 by less than expected over St. Louis County Councilwoman Geri Rothman-Serot, ex-wife of former Lieutenant Governor Ken Rothman. In 1998 Bond decisively defeated Attorney General (and future Governor) Jay Nixon and Libertarian Tamara Millay after a hard-fought campaign, and in 2004 he won re-election over Democratic challenger State Treasurer Nancy Farmer with 56 percent of the vote.

Facing the expiration of his fourth full term in January 2011, Bond announced on January 8, 2009, that he did not plan to seek a fifth term and would not run for re-election in November 2010. Representative Roy Blunt held the seat for the Republicans, defeating Democratic Secretary of State Robin Carnahan.

===Tenure===
====Environmental record====
The environmental watchdog group Republicans for Environmental Protection (REP) has given Bond an exceptionally low rating of −2 for the 109th United States Congress, citing anti-environment votes on seven out of seven issues deemed critical by the organization. According to the 2006 REP scorecard, Bond supported oil drilling both offshore and in the Arctic National Wildlife Refuge, while opposing a bill for &quot;efficiency and renewable-resource programs to improve energy security, lower costs, and reduce energy-related environmental impacts&quot;. He indicated support for zero-carbon energy from nuclear power in a 2008 Senate floor speech.

====Taxes====
Commenting on an IRS spokesman&#x27;s claim that a person catching a record-breaking home run ball from Mark McGwire could be &quot;responsible for paying any applicable tax on any large gift&quot;, which was thought to be close to $140,000 in this circumstance, Bond said: &quot;If the IRS wants to know why they are the most hated federal agency in America, they need look no further than this.&quot;

====Torture====
Bond has opposed setting forth interrogation methods used by the Central Intelligence Agency to conform to the U.S. Army Field Manual. While drawing criticism for being one of only nine senators to oppose such a bill, Bond said on the floor that he does not favor or approve of torture.

In a memo to CIA director John Brennan and others, he suggested banning specific techniques that could be considered torture in order to encourage servicemen to invent others on their own. He does not approve of making interrogation techniques public information on the basis that it would allow enemy combatants to train and prepare themselves for what they might go through if captured. He drew criticism when, during a debate he made a comment comparing waterboarding to swimming, stating &quot;There are different ways of doing it. It&#x27;s like swimming, freestyle, backstroke&quot;, in response to the question &quot;do you think that waterboarding... constitutes torture?&quot;

====Free trade====

Bond has been a great supporter of expanding free trade to the third world, and he believes in giving presidential authority to fast track trade relations. He has voted for the North American Free Trade Agreement (NAFTA) and the Central America Free Trade Agreement (CAFTA) and believes in permanently normalizing trade relations with China and Vietnam.

====Government reform====
While Bond voted in favor in banning members of Congress from receiving gifts from lobbyists, he has generally opposed campaign reform. He voted against the McCain Feingold Act for bipartisan campaign finance solutions. Bond also voted against limiting contributions from corporations or labor.

====Social issues====
Bond received an 11% rating from the NAACP. He has voted consistently against same-sex marriage, supporting the proposed constitutional ban of it.

On June 25, 1976, Bond officially ordered the recension of Executive Order Number 44 issued by Lilburn W. Boggs in 1838 that ordered the expulsion or extermination of all Mormons from the State of Missouri and issued an apology to Mormons on behalf of all Missourians.

As governor of the state of Missouri in 1983, Bond signed a declaration of recognition in support of the group known as the Northern Cherokee, now called the Northern Cherokee Nation of the Old Louisiana Territory attempting to grant a form of State recognition by way of executive order. This act was part of the group&#x27;s attempt to gain Federal Recognition and to receive the related benefits for the group.

====Dismissal of U.S. attorneys controversy====

In October 2008, Bond apologized to former U.S. Attorney Todd Graves, after a U.S. Justice Department report cited Bond for forcing Graves out over a disagreement with Representative Sam Graves. Following the report, Attorney General Michael Mukasey appointed a special prosecutor to investigate whether former Attorney General Alberto Gonzales and other officials involved in the firings of nine U.S. attorneys broke the law. Citizens for Responsibility and Ethics in Washington (CREW), a progressive activist group, filed an Ethics Committee complaint against Bond over his role in the ouster of Graves.

In 2009, it was revealed according to White House documents that Graves was put on a dismissal list a month after White House e-mail indicated that his replacement was part of a deal between Bond and the Bush administration. The e-mail suggested that Graves was replaced with a candidate favored by Bond for clearing the way for an appointment of a federal judge from Arkansas on the 8th Circuit Court of Appeals.

==Post-government career==
After leaving office in January 2011, Bond joined the law firm of Thompson Coburn.

Bond serves as a co-chair of the Housing Commission at the Bipartisan Policy Center.

In August 2011, Bond announced that he would join alliantgroup&#x27;s strategic advisory board and serve as a senior adviser for the firm.

Bond formally launched his own firm, Kit Bond Strategies, in November 2011.

==Missouri Apollo 17 goodwill Moon rock==
In the last few days of his long political career, Kit Bond and his staff solved a mystery that had intrigued the press, Missouri politicians, and members of academia for much of 2010. Missouri state officials had wrongly believed that the state museum held a rare and valuable Apollo 17 lunar sample display containing a &quot;goodwill Moon rock&quot;. On June 8, 2010, the state realized that what they actually had was only the Missouri Apollo 11 lunar sample display containing small samples of Moon dust rather than the $5-million piece of Apollo 17 history.
In cleaning out his senatorial office in December 2010, it was discovered that Bond had inadvertently taken the Apollo 17 display when he had left the governor&#x27;s office. He subsequently returned the display to the governor of Missouri at the time, Jay Nixon, who passed it on to the Missouri State Museum. Bond was one of four former governors who had taken their states&#x27; lunar sample displays upon leaving office; the other three were the former governors of Colorado, West Virginia, and Arkansas.

==Personal life==
Bond&#x27;s son Sam graduated in 2003 from Princeton University, after which he became an officer in the United States Marine Corps and served multiple tours of duty in Iraq. Sam later entered a career in business.

In 1994, Bond&#x27;s wife, Carolyn, filed for a divorce, which was finalized the following year. Bond married Linda Pell, now Linda Bond, in 2002. She grew up in the Kansas City suburb of Gladstone and is a partner of a fundraising firm that supports Republican organizations. She and Bond had dated in the late 1990s then again a few years later before they were engaged. It is her second marriage as well.

After winning his second term as governor, Bond sued his investment manager and Paine Webber, alleging his $1.3 million trust fund had been drained. He was one of several clients who sued, and he settled in 1996 for $900,000.

In 2009, Bond co-authored a book with Lewis Simons entitled &quot;The Next Front: Southeast Asia and the Road to Global Peace with Islam&quot;.

Bond has permanent vision loss in one eye, which he attributes to undiagnosed amblyopia during childhood.

<text>Traditionally, a delicatessen or deli is a grocery that sells a selection of fine, exotic, or foreign prepared foods. Delicatessens originated in Germany (original: ) during the 18th century and spread to the United States in the mid-19th century. European immigrants to the United States, especially Ashkenazi Jews, popularized the delicatessen in U.S. culture beginning in the late 19th century. Today, many large retail stores like supermarkets have deli sections.

== Etymology ==
&quot;Delicatessen&quot; is a German loanword which first appeared in English in the late 19th century and is the plural of . The German form was lent from the French , which itself was lent from Italian , from , of which the root word is the Latin adjective , meaning &quot;giving pleasure, delightful, pleasing&quot;. The first U.S. short version of this word, &quot;deli&quot;, came into existence probably after World War II with the first evidence being from 1948.

==History==
The origin of the delicatessen as a grocery store is lost in time, but the path clearly spread across Western Europe as the term was borrowed by one people and language and culture after another.

The German food company Dallmayr traces its history to 1700, when it became the first store to import to the German population bananas, mangoes, and plums from places such as the Canary Islands and China. Over 300 years later, it remains the largest business of its kind in Europe.

The first delicatessen to appear in England was L Teroni and sons. This was opened in 1878. It is still open today but is no longer run by the same family.

The first delicatessens to appear in the United States were in New York City in the early 1880s, with the first advertised use of this word occurring in early 1884 in St. Louis, Missouri upon the opening of &quot;Sprague&#x27;s Delicatessen,&quot; at first one lunchroom and eventually five popular downtown lunch establishments operating between 1884 and 1906. Early delicatessens in New York catered to the German immigrant population living there. As the German-Jewish population increased in New York City during the mid- to late 1800s, kosher delicatessens began to open; the first was founded in 1889. In the United States, by the late 20th to early 21st centuries, supermarkets, local economy stores, and fast food outlets began using the word (often abbreviated as &quot;deli&quot;) to describe sections of their stores. The decline of the deli as an independent retail establishment was most noted in New York City: from a high in the 1930s of about 1,500 Jewish delicatessens, only 15 still existed in 2015.

== By country and region ==

=== Australia ===

In most of Australia, the term &quot;delicatessen&quot; retains its European meaning of high-quality, expensive foods and stores. Large supermarket chains often have a deli department, and independent delicatessens exist throughout the country. Both types of deli offer a variety of cured meats, sausages, pickled vegetables, dips, breads, and olives.

In South Australia and Western Australia, &quot;deli&quot; also denotes a small convenience store or milk bar, and some businesses use &quot;deli&quot; as part of their business name. Traditional delicatessens also exist in these states, with &quot;continental delicatessen&quot; sometimes used to indicate the European version.

=== Canada ===
In Canada, both meanings of &quot;delicatessen&quot; are used. Customers of European origin often use the term in a manner consistent with its original German meaning, but as in the United States, a deli can be a combined grocery store and restaurant.

=== Europe ===
In Europe &quot;delicatessen&quot; means high-quality, expensive foods, and stores. In German-speaking countries a common synonym is (fine food), and shops that sell it are called (delicacy stores). Department stores often have a (delicacy department). European delicatessens include Fauchon in Paris, Dallmayr in Munich, Julius Meinl am Graben in Vienna, Harrods and Fortnum &amp; Mason in London, Peck in Milan, and Jelmoli in Zürich.

Although U.S.-style delicatessens are also found in Europe, they appeal to the luxury market. In Russia, shops and supermarket sections approximating U.S.-style delis are called and offer salads and main courses. Delicate meats and cheeses, cold-cut and sliced hot, are sold in a separate section. The Eliseevsky food store in central Moscow, with its &quot;fin de siècle&quot; decor, is similar to a European delicatessen. From the Tsarist era, it was preserved by the Soviets as an outlet for difficult-to-obtain Russian delicacies. Delicatessens may also provide foods from other countries and cultures that are not readily available in local food stores. In Italy, the deli can be called , , and more recently . In France it is known as a or .

United Kingdom

In the United Kingdom a delicatessen offered a variety of meats and cheeses. It also has options of various salads. There are delicatessen counters in supermarkets as well as in markets and sandwich shops. Delicatessens will make sandwichs to take away though some have an area where you can sit and eat. Items like potato salad, coleslaw, pease pudding and olives are sold by weight. There is often an area that sells jars of chutneys, jams and sauces.

=== Ireland ===
In Ireland, a &quot;deli&quot; or &quot;deli counter&quot; is a food counter serving pre-prepared &quot;food to go&quot; like sandwiches and hot snacks. This trend began in the 1990s and led to the emergence of many ready-to-eat deli products. Delis can be found at a wide variety of convenience shops, newsagents, supermarkets, petrol stations, and casual eateries throughout Ireland.

Popular items served at hot deli counters include chicken fillet rolls (breaded chicken fillet on a bread roll), breakfast rolls (Irish breakfast items on a bread roll), jambons, sausage rolls, and potato wedges.

=== United States ===
In the United States, a delicatessen (or deli) can be a simple retail grocery store, a sit-down restaurant, or any combination in between. Sit-down and to-go delis offer a broader, fresher menu than fast-food chains, rarely employing fryers (except for chicken) and routinely preparing sandwiches to order. Delicatessens from a number of cultures can be found in the United States, including Italian, Greek, and Jewish, both kosher and &quot;kosher style&quot;. The American equivalent of a European delicatessen may be known as a gourmet food store.

Retail delis in the U.S. sell fresh-sliced cold cuts and cheeses. In addition to made-to-order sandwiches, many American delicatessens offer made-to-order green salads. Prepared pasta, potato, chicken, and tuna salads, or other salads are sometimes displayed under the counter and sold by weight. This is the same as a deli counter in a supermarket in the UK. Precooked chicken, shrimp, or eggplant dishes may also be sold. Some establishments have table seating for patrons to consume sandwiches and other food, while others only sell food to go. Delicatessens offer a variety of beverages, such as pre-packaged or fountain soft drinks, bottled water, coffee, tea, and milk. Potato chips and similar products, newspapers, and small items such as candy and mints are also usually available.

<doc id="358925" wikidata="Q1696" url="?curid=358925" title="Legazpi, Albay">
<text>Legazpi (IPA: ), officially the City of Legazpi (; ), is a component city and capital of the province of Albay, Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 209,533. Legazpi is the regional center and largest city of the Bicol Region and in Albay, in terms of population. It is the region&#x27;s center of tourism, education, health services, commerce and transportation in the Bicol Region. The city is applying for a Highly Urbanized City (HUC).

The city is composed of two districts, Legazpi Port and the Old Albay District. Mayon Volcano, one of the Philippines&#x27; most popular icons and tourist destinations, is partly within the city&#x27;s borders.

In 2018, Legazpi was ranked first in overall competitiveness among component cities by the National Competitiveness Council. The city also ranked first in infrastructure and second in economic dynamism. In the same year, Legazpi was also named &quot;most business-friendly city&quot; in the component city category by the Philippine Chamber of Commerce and Industry.
==Etymology==

The city of Legazpi was named after Miguel López de Legazpi, the Basque Spanish &quot;conquistador&quot; who officially annexed the Philippine Islands to the Spanish Empire in 1565, and whose surname came from a town in Gipuzkoa, Spain.

==History==
===Pre-Hispanic===
The area that is now Albay had a thriving civilization before the Spanish arrived. The Spanish explorers found densely populated settlements with an abundance of gold and provisions in the southern Bicol peninsula. Ancient inhabitants practiced rice cultivation, made fine gold jewelry and possessed silk, suggesting trade with China. American anthropologist Henry Otley Beyer found jars, stone tools and shells from 100 to 500 BC in Sorsogon and Albay. Meanwhile, ancient burial jars and pottery were also found in Hoyop-Hoyopan Cave in Camalig. Other evidences of pre-Hispanic civilization include the Mataas shell scoop, which dates back to the Late Neolithic Period, found in Cagraray Island. The Mataas shell scoop was declared a National Cultural Treasure by the National Museum of the Philippines.

===Foundation===
Legazpi was originally a fishing settlement called Sawangan that occupied the mangrove swamps that is now the Legazpi Port, inhabited by fisher folk and farmers. In 1569, a Spanish expedition dispatched by Miguel Lopez de Legazpi led by Luis Enriquez de Guzman and Augustinian friar Alonso Jimenez first set foot in Albay. They arrived on the coastal settlement called Ibalon in present-day Magallanes, Sorsogon after exploring the islands of Masbate, Ticao and Burias and proceeded inland as far as present-day Camalig, Albay.

In July 1573, the conquistador Juan de Salcedo, grandson of Governor-General Legazpi, led another expedition from the north. They founded Villa Santiago de Libon (present-day Libon, Albay) and reached the settlement of Albaybay, whose name was subsequently shortened to &#x27;Albay&#x27; or &quot;Pueblo de Albay&quot;. In 1616, Pueblo de Albay served as the capital of Partido de Ibalon, which included present-day Albay, Sorsogon, Masbate, parts of Camarines Sur and the islands of Catanduanes, Ticao and Burias.

===Spanish colonial era===

Spanish religious missionaries governed the settlement in the 1580s. In 1587, Franciscan friars of the &quot;Doctrina de Cagsawa&quot; began to convert the area&#x27;s population to Christianity. The village of Sawangan became more populous and progressive and the first parish priest, Fray Francisco de Santa Ana, OFM, built a wooden chapel with St. Gregory the Great as patron. Sawangan then became an independent parish and was called &quot;Misión de San Gregorio Magno de Sawangan&quot;.

A bigger and more imposing church replaced the chapel during the tenure of Fray Martin del Espiritu OFM in 1636 and Sawangan continued to thrive despite the Moro raids in the 1700s, a super typhoon in 1742, an earthquake in 1811, and other calamities. Sawangan was created a visita regular in 1605 and elevated as an independent town in 1616.

====1814 Eruption of Mt. Mayon====

On February 1, 1814, a catastrophic eruption of Mt. Mayon partially destroyed Sawangan and buried Cagsawa, Budiao and Camalig. The parish priest of Sawangan, Fray Pedro Licup, urged the residents to transfer to Makalaya (present-day Barangay Taysan) located on the slopes of Mt. Bariw. However, many residents decided to return to the lowlands and settled in Taytay (present-day Barangay Bagumbayan).

Other survivors opted to return to the original location of Sawangan and established Binanuahan (Banuang Gurang) despite a decree by the Gobierno Superior signed on October 1, 1829, which prohibited the establishment of new towns. The new settlement in Taytay grew larger and eventually became a township. Binanuahan was declared a visita or tributary of Taytay and the combined town became known as Albay Nuevo.

In 1839, the settlers in Taytay started to erect a stone church designed by Gobernadorcillo Don Jose Ma. de Peñaranda, an architect, in consultation with Fray Jose Yagres, OFM. The structure would become the present Cathedral of San Gregorio Magno in the Old Albay District. Meanwhile, those who returned to Sawangan established an &quot;ermita&quot; or chapel dedicated to the Archangel Raphael, whom they adopted as patron saint. This became the present church of St. Raphael the Archangel in the Legazpi Port district.

On July 17, 1856, Governor General Ramon Montero signed a decree creating the township of Pueblo Viejo, out of Binanuahan and the adjacent villages of Lamba, Rawis and Bigaa. In another decree, Montero named the town Legazpi, which was formally established on October 22 of the same year, in honor of no less than Miguel Lopez de Legazpi, the first Governor General, who landed in the town&#x27;s territories years before.

====Port of Legazpi opened to world trade====
The port of Legazpi served as anchorage for ships sailing to Nueva España (Mexico) beginning in the latter part of the 16th century. The nearby Sula Channel was used as a sanctuary by galleons during storms because of its sheltered inlet. In 1873, Legazpi was made a port of entry by a Royal Decree earlier issued in Madrid on May 18, 1872, and later promulgated by Governor-General Juan Alaminos y Vivar on December 3, 1874.

Legazpi was declared a city for the first time under the Becerra Law of 1892. In 1894, the Spanish Minister of the Ultramar promulgated a decree creating the combined city government (ayunamiento) of Legazpi, a merger of the towns of Albay (now Old Albay District) and Daraga with the territories of the former.

====Philippine revolution====
On September 22, 1898, the Civil Governor of Albay, Angel Bascaran y Federic and the Spanish residents evacuated Albay. Subsequently, a revolutionary junta was organized by Don Anacieto Solano who later turned over the command to General Vicente Lukban, General-in-chief of Operations of the revolutionary government in the southern region.

===American colonial era===

On January 23, 1900, American forces composed of three infantry companies equipped with powerful rifles and cannon landed on the shores of Albay Gulf to conquer Legazpi. They were met by 800 revolutionary Filipino troops headed by General Jose Ignacio Paua, Col. Antero Reyes, Captain Alvaro Nepomuceno, and Policarpio Pergone who put up a strong defense of the city.

The American troops, headed by Brig. Gen. W.A. Kobbe, encountered heavy resistance from the Filipino forces who gallantly engaged them in a bloody fight on San Rafael Bridge that resulted in the death of 172 Filipinos including Reyes, who used only bolos.

<doc id="358931" wikidata="Q1093380" url="?curid=358931" title="Club sandwich">
<text>A club sandwich or clubhouse sandwich, is a three-layer sandwich consisting of three slices of bread (traditionally toasted), sliced cooked poultry, fried bacon, lettuce, tomato, and mayonnaise. It is often cut diagonally into quarters or halves and held together by cocktail sticks. 

==History==
The club sandwich may have originated at the Union Club of New York City. The earliest known reference to the sandwich, an article that appeared in &quot;The Evening World&quot; on November 18, 1889, is also an early recipe: &quot;Have you tried a Union Club sandwich yet? Two toasted pieces of Graham bread, with a layer of turkey or chicken and ham between them, served warm.&quot; Several other early references also credit the chef of the Union Club with creating the sandwich.

Another theory is that the club sandwich was invented at the Saratoga Club in Saratoga Springs, New York, after Richard Canfield bought it and made it into the Canfield Casino in 1894. 

Other sources find the origin of the club sandwich to be up for debate, with several contemporaneous sources naming Danny Mears as the inventor.

The sandwich appeared on U.S. restaurant menus as early as 1899. The earliest reference to the sandwich in published fiction is from &quot;Conversations of a Chorus Girl&quot;, a 1903 book by Ray Cardell. Historically, club sandwiches featured slices of chicken, but with time, turkey has become increasingly common. An 1897 recipe has three layers, with the chicken and ham separated not by a slice of bread, but by a lettuce leaf.

==Ingredients==
As with a BLT, toasted white bread is standard, along with iceberg lettuce, bacon, and tomatoes. The sandwich is usually dressed with mayonnaise. Variations on the traditional club sandwich abound. Some replace the poultry meat with eggs (a &quot;breakfast club&quot;) or roast beef. Others use ham instead of, or in addition to, bacon, or add slices of cheese. Various kinds of mustard and sliced pickles may be added. Upscale variations include the oyster club, the salmon club, and Dungeness crab melt.
=== Regional varieties ===

==== New Zealand ====
In New Zealand, &#x27;club sandwich&#x27; refers to a tea (or finger) sandwich, typically filled with egg mayonnaise, lettuce and tomato.

==== Hong Kong ====
In Hong Kong, the Chinese name of club sandwich (公司三文治) literally translates to &quot;office sandwich&quot;. The regional version in Hong Kong consists of scrambled eggs, Spam, ham, tomato, lettuce and American cheese.

==== Canada ====
In Canada, club sandwiches are sometimes prepared using rotisserie chicken meat, as opposed to sliced chicken or turkey, and served hot.

<text>Singtel Optus Pty Limited is an Australian telecommunications company headquartered in Macquarie Park, a suburb in the Northern Sydney region of Sydney, New South Wales, Australia. It is a wholly owned subsidiary of Singaporean telecommunications company Singtel. 

Optus is the second-largest telecommunications company in Australia, with over 11 million customers as of 2023. Its mobile network covers 98.5% of the Australian population, with plans to cover 100% of Australia by 2025 through its partnership with SpaceX.

==History==
===AUSSAT and deregulation (1981–1990)===
Optus can trace its beginnings back to the formation of the Government-owned AUSSAT Pty Limited in 1981. In 1982, Aussat selected the Hughes 376 for their initial satellites, with the first, AUSSAT A1, launched in August 1985. AUSSAT satellites were used for both military and civilian satellite communications, and delivering television services to remote outback communities.
With Aussat operating at a loss and with moves to deregulate telecommunications in Australia, the government decided to sell Aussat, coupled with a telecommunications licence. The licence was sold to Optus Communications – a consortium including:
* logistics firm Mayne Nickless (24.99%);
* UK telecommunications company Cable &amp; Wireless (24.50%);
* US telecommunications company BellSouth (24.50%);
* AIDC Limited (10.00%);
* insurance and investment company AMP (10.00%); and
* insurance and investment company National Mutual (6.02%).

The new telecommunications company was designed to provide competition to then government owned telecommunications company &quot;Telecom Australia&quot;, now known as Telstra.

===Founding of Optus (1991–present)===
Optus gained the second general carrier licence in January 1991.

After privatisation, AUSSAT became Optus and its first offering to the general public was to offer long-distance calls at cheaper rates than that of its competitor Telstra. The long-distance calling rates on offer were initially available by consumers dialing &quot;1&quot; before the area code and phone number. Following this, a ballot process was conducted by then regulator AUSTEL, with customers choosing their default long-distance carrier. Customers who made no choice or did not respond to the mailout campaign automatically remained as a Telstra long-distance customer. Customers who remained with Telstra could dial the override code of &quot;1456&quot; before the area code and phone number to manually select Optus as the carrier for that single call. Since 1 July 1998, consumers have the choice of preselecting their preferred long-distance carrier or dialling the override code before dialling a telephone number.

The group began by building an interstate fibre optic cable and a series of exchanges between Optus&#x27; interstate network and Telstra&#x27;s local network. It also laid fibre optics into major office buildings and industrial areas, and focused on high bandwidth local, (interstate) long distance, and interstate calls for business. In its early years, Optus was only able to offer local and long-distance calls to residential customers through Telstra&#x27;s local phone network. Telstra would carry residential to residential calls to Optus&#x27; exchanges, and then the calls would be switched to Optus&#x27; long-distance fibre optic network.

In 2024, Singtel held advanced talks with Brookfield to sell a 20% stake in Optus. Brookfield and Singtel were unable to agree on terms, with Singtel claiming afterwards it remained committed to Optus and the Australian market.

==Products and services==

Key Optus products and services include:

===Voice===
* Residential and Commercial POTS for local and long-distance telephony
* Commercial VoIP and VoDSL

Retail services are sold to customers via phone, internet or through retail outlets, especially franchise chains such as Optus World, Network Communications, Strathfield, TeleChoice, and Allphones.

Optus&#x27; Customer Solutions and Services (CS&amp;S) organisation is responsible for providing support to Optus Business customers. CS&amp;S works with Optus&#x27; subsidiary Alphawest to support information technology services across Optus&#x27; large business, corporate and government client base.

==Subsidiaries==

A number of notable wholly owned subsidiaries operate as part of the Singtel Optus group. These are:
* Information Technology &amp; Network Services
** Alphawest
** Uecomm
* Mobile Telephony
** SIMplus
** Virgin Mobile Australia
** Amaysim

Until 20 January 2013, Optus sold mobile services under the brand name Boost Mobile.

Optus also has a 50% stake in the now defunct OPEL Networks.

Other wholly owned subsidiaries of note no longer have a significant active role as individual entities. These are as follows:

Reef Networks was formed in 1999 to provide an optical fibre link between Brisbane and Cairns in Queensland. Optus gained exclusive access to this link in 2001, ahead of acquiring the organisation in 2005.

XYZed was established by Optus in 2000 to provide wholesale business-grade DSL services under an individual brand, but today provides a collection of products only as part of the Optus Wholesale &amp; Satellite division. XYZed established a network of DSLAMs inside Telstra telephone exchanges, utilising Unconditioned Local Loop services to reach end users.

== Corporate affairs ==
=== Chief Executive Officer ===
Kelly Bayer Rosmarin commenced as CEO of Optus and Consumer Australia on 1 April 2020. She resigned on 20 November 2023.

===Hybrid fibre-coax rollout===

These practices meant that Optus was the largest customer of Telstra. To become competitive Optus would need to lay its own local phone network. To provide a killer application for this, the Australian Federal government sold subscription television licences. Optus, as well as the Seven Network, businessman Kerry Stokes and American cable company Cablevision, formed the Optus Vision consortium. News Corporation and Telstra created the rival Foxtel consortium.

Telstra&#x27;s local phone network did not have the capability to deliver Foxtel pay television to consumers in the early 1990s, so Telstra identified a need to create a broadband network to support this new product.

As Telstra and Optus could not agree on terms for a joint broadband cable roll out, they laid two competing cable networks, in addition to Telstra&#x27;s existing copper network, at a combined cost estimated of over A$6bn.

Whilst Telstra focused on creating a broadband network specifically for broadcast, Optus designed their cable network to provide telephony services in addition to broadcast television.

Optus is no longer a customer of Telstra&#x27;s after deciding to move the funding used to lease Telstra&#x27;s copper network into constructing their hybrid fibre-coaxial network, the first in Australia.

===Takeovers===
Cable &amp; Wireless with 24.5% stakeholder bought out BellSouth&#x27;s equal 24.5% shareholding in July 1997. The company returned to profitability in 1998 and changed its name to Cable &amp; Wireless Optus. Government relaxation of foreign ownership restrictions paved the way for the company to be floated – with Cable and Wireless increasing its holding to 52.5%) – and listed on the Australian Securities Exchange on 17 November 1998.

During 2001, Singtel launched a takeover bid for Cable and Wireless Optus which was ultimately successful and the company became known as Singtel Optus.

In May 2004, Optus announced a $226.8 million bid for UEComm. The takeover was approved in July and completed in August.

In July 2005, Optus announced it would acquire Alphawest Ltd. for A$25.9 million. The buyout was completed in November 2005 and Alphawest is now an operating division of Optus Business.

On 12 January 2006, Optus acquired the remaining 74.15% of Virgin Mobile Australia for U$22.6 m, giving it 100% ownership.

===OptusNet===

Optus Communications offered its first business-focused internet products in 1998 under the OptusNet product family, offering in-house developed dial-up and high-speed services. Optus purchased one of Australia&#x27;s pioneer ISPs, Microplex, in 1998 to provide consumer dial-up internet services. Separate to this, under the Optus Vision brand, a cable broadband arm began as a joint venture with U.S. cable and content provider Excite@Home and was known as Optus@Home from its introduction in 1999 until it was renamed in 2002. ADSL services were offered from February 2004. ADSL2+ services were provided from December 2005.

===OPEL Networks===

In June 2007, joint venture subsidiary OPEL Networks was awarded government funding towards the cost of building a regional broadband network. Optus was to be contracted to build the network on behalf of OPEL.

In April 2008, after a change of the Federal Government from the Liberal Party of Australia coalition to the Australian Labor Party, the new government terminated the funding agreement and the project was halted, with its functions to be replaced by the National Broadband Network.

===Terria===

Optus is part of a consortium – now known as Terria – that in July 2006 announced their intention to make a combined bid to build the proposed National Broadband Network.

===Outsourcing===
Since 2005, Optus has outsourced some customer service functions to Concentrix and 247.ai, with the outsourcer providing 800 staff operating offshore in India, supplementing Optus&#x27; 3,000-plus onshore call centre staff. Some functions have also been supplemented in the Philippines. Optus also uses 24/7 Inc. for telephone &amp; chat based offshore support.

In October 2006, Optus announced that it would outsource 100 contracting jobs to another Singtel subsidiary, IT company NCS, in Singapore.

==Infrastructure==
Optus&#x27; fully owned network infrastructure consists of the following:

===Network backbone===

* ExtraTerrestrial Fibre Optic Network
** Cairns to Brisbane
** Brisbane to Sydney (fully diverse over two physically separate paths)
** Sydney to Melbourne (fully diverse over two physically separate paths, one via Canberra, one via the coast)
** Melbourne to Adelaide
** Adelaide to Perth
* SDH Digital Microwave
** Hobart to Launceston
* Satellite
** Fleet of geostationary satellites (See Optus fleet of satellites)
** International Earth Stations in Sydney and Perth
** National Earth Stations in Brisbane, Canberra, Melbourne, Adelaide, Perth, Hobart and Darwin
* Regional exchanges in Sydney (Rosebery), Melbourne, Brisbane, Canberra, Adelaide and Perth.
* Telehousing Data Centres in Melbourne and Sydney

===Customer access network===

* Hybrid fibre-coaxial (HFC) network in Sydney, Brisbane and Melbourne, providing consumer fixed telephony, cable internet and cable television services.
* CBD optical fibre rings in Sydney, Melbourne, Brisbane, Adelaide, Perth, Canberra and Wollongong, providing direct access for corporate and government services.
* DSLAMs in certain Telstra local telephone exchanges in all states. Originally only providing business-grade DSL services, newer installations also provide consumer DSL and POTS telephony.

OptusNet also provides Cable internet. In August 2010, OptusNet released an upgrade of its HFC network to the DOCSIS 3.0 standard, which enabled customers to access a maximum theoretical downstream bandwidth of 100 Megabits. OptusNet is also one of the few ISPs in Australia to currently provide ADSL2+ via its own DSLAMs, which it also resells to other ISPs.

===Mobile network===
Mobile network equipment is from Nortel, Nokia and Huawei and antennas are sourced from Andrews, RFS, Argus and Kathrein.

The Optus network operates on the following bandwidth frequencies across Australia:
* 3G UMTS 900/2100 MHz
* 4G LTE 700 / 900 / 1800 / 2100 / 2300 / 2600 MHz network which has been in progressive rollout since 2012. VoLTE is currently being rolled out across Australia. For now, VoLTE is only available in CBD and metro areas in Sydney, Melbourne, Adelaide, Brisbane, Perth and Canberra on selected devices purchased on postpaid contracts. Until VoLTE has been fully rolled out, voice calling is still reliant on the 3G network (and formerly the 2G network until it was terminated).
* 5G NR 3500 MHz rollout started in October 2019

The 2G GSM 900/1800 MHz network was terminated on 3 April 2017 in Western Australia and Northern Territory. 2G GSM was completely terminated on 1 August 2017 when 2G was disconnected in Victoria, New South Wales, Australian Capital Territory, Queensland, Tasmania and South Australia. To remain connected, a device that is capable of running 3G at 900 MHz is now required after 2G was completely disconnected across Australia.

On 28 October 2024, the 3G UMTS service provided by Optus was shut down. This affects other providers reliant on their network, including Amaysim and Virgin Mobile Australia. To remain connected, customers are required to have a phone capable of connecting to their 4G LTE or 5G NR services. All phones incapable of using VoLTE will be prevented from accessing the Optus network due to legal requirements to ensure access to emergency 000 calls. 

===Partly owned infrastructure===
Part-owned network infrastructure includes:
* 3G mobile network, a joint venture with Vodafone Australia
* Southern Cross Cable, a fully diverse submarine optical fibre link across the Pacific Ocean between Sydney, New South Wales and California in the United States. The Singtel group owns a 40% interest in Southern Cross Cables Limited. This interest was originally owned by Singtel Optus Pty Limited, before ownership was transferred to parent company Singtel during the March 2006 – June 2006 quarter.

==Advertising and sponsorship==
Between 1994 and 2005 Optus had the naming rights to the Carlton football clubs original home ground in Princes Park. It was called Optus Oval until the ground was retired by the AFL in 2005. 

Optus was the main sponsor of the 1997 ARL season.

In 2016, Optus signed a 10-year partnership agreement with the Australian Olympic Committee to be the official partner of the Australian Olympic Team and the Australian Paralympic Team until 2026.

In 2017, Optus won naming rights to Perth Stadium where it would be known as Optus Stadium. Optus and the Government of Western Australia agreed to a 10-year naming right worth approximately A$50 million.

Optus also has a long-term partnership with the Adelaide Crows in the AFL. Optus has been a partner of the Collingwood Magpies in the AFL Women&#x27;s since 2018.

Optus is the current major sponsor for the No. 25 Walkinshaw Andretti United Holden ZB Commodore driven by Chaz Mostert

=== 2022 cyberattack ===

Around 22 September 2022, Optus systems sustained a significant cyberattack that resulted in a major data breach of both current and former customers&#x27; personal information, including customers’ names, dates of birth, phone numbers and email addresses, with a smaller subset of customers having their street addresses, driving licence details and passport numbers leaked. Optus CEO Kelly Bayer Rosmarin urged customers to exercise &quot;heightened awareness&quot; regarding transactions with their Optus and other accounts. Rosmarin emphasised that passwords were not compromised. The CEO said that the &quot;worst-case scenario&quot; regarding the number of customers whose data had been leaked was 9.8 million customers, but believes the actual number to be far lower.

On 24 September 2022, Australian news outlets &quot;The Age&quot; and &quot;The Sydney Morning Herald&quot; reported that Optus was investigating the authenticity of a ransom demand of US$1 million made on a hacking forum. The demand gave Optus one week to pay the ransom in cryptocurrency else the data will be sold for US$300,000 to whoever else wants it.

On 6 October, the Australian Federal Police announced the arrest of a 19-year-old man who had allegedly threatened 93 Optus customers by saying that he would use their information leaked in the attack to commit financial crimes, unless they paid AUD $2,000.

In response to the cyberattack, the Australian federal government announced emergency regulation on 6 October, in the form of a 12-month amendment to the &quot;Telecommunications Regulations 2021&quot; to &quot;enable telecommunications companies to temporarily share approved government identifier information with regulated financial services entities.&quot;

On 11 October, the Office of the Australian Information Commissioner launched an investigation, the aim of which is to explore the company&#x27;s handling of customers&#x27; data.

=== 2023 nationwide outage ===

Early on 8 November 2023, an undetermined issue caused a nationwide outage in Optus Mobile and Fixed Internet services. The outage directly impacted more than 10 million customers, including government services, hospitals and businesses. Optus Mobile customers reported that their phones showed &#x27;SOS&#x27; on the signal indicator, which is a sign the regular network is down, but mobile phones still have access to alternate networks in the event of an emergency call by using a so-called camping mechanism; however, Optus landlines were unable to make emergency triple-zero calls. The outage affected the communication systems for Melbourne&#x27;s train network, so for safety reasons the whole network was halted until backup communications commenced, leading to major delays and cancellations throughout the day.
