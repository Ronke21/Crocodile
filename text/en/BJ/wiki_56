<text>Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD) is a coenzyme central to metabolism. Found in all living cells, NAD is called a dinucleotide because it consists of two nucleotides joined through their phosphate groups. One nucleotide contains an adenine nucleobase and the other, nicotinamide. NAD exists in two forms: an oxidized and reduced form, abbreviated as NAD and NADH (H for hydrogen), respectively.

In cellular metabolism, NAD is involved in redox reactions, carrying electrons from one reaction to another, so it is found in two forms: NAD is an oxidizing agent, accepting electrons from other molecules and becoming reduced; with H+, this reaction forms NADH, which can be used as a reducing agent to donate electrons. These electron transfer reactions are the main function of NAD. It is also used in other cellular processes, most notably as a substrate of enzymes in adding or removing chemical groups to or from proteins, in posttranslational modifications. Because of the importance of these functions, the enzymes involved in NAD metabolism are targets for drug discovery.

In organisms, NAD can be synthesized from simple building-blocks (&quot;de novo&quot;) from either tryptophan or aspartic acid, each a case of an amino acid. Alternatively, more complex components of the coenzymes are taken up from nutritive compounds such as nicotinic acid; similar compounds are produced by reactions that break down the structure of NAD, providing a salvage pathway that recycles them back into their respective active form.

Some NAD is converted into the coenzyme nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide phosphate (NADP), whose chemistry largely parallels that of NAD, though its predominant role is as a coenzyme in anabolic metabolism.

In the name NAD, the superscripted plus sign indicates the positive formal charge on one of its nitrogen atoms.
A biological coenzyme that acts as an electron carrier in enzymatic reactions. NADP is a reducing agent in anabolic reactions like the Calvin cycle and lipid and nucleic acid syntheses. NADP exists in two forms: NADP+, the oxidized form, and NADPH, the reduced form. NADP is similar to nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide (NAD), but NADP has a phosphate group at the C-2′ position of the adenosyl.

==Physical and chemical properties==

Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide consists of two nucleosides joined by pyrophosphate. The nucleosides each contain a ribose ring, one with adenine attached to the first carbon atom (the 1&#x27; position) (adenosine diphosphate ribose) and the other with nicotinamide at this position.

The compound accepts or donates the equivalent of H−. Such reactions (summarized in formula below) involve the removal of two hydrogen atoms from the reactant (R), in the form of a hydride ion (H−), and a proton (H). The proton is released into solution, while the reductant RH is oxidized and NAD reduced to NADH by transfer of the hydride to the nicotinamide ring.

:RH + NAD → NADH + H + R;

From the hydride electron pair, one electron is attracted to the slightly more electronegative atom of the nicotinamide ring of NAD, becoming part of the nicotinamide moiety. The second electron and proton atom are transferred to the carbon atom adjacent to the N atom. The midpoint potential of the NAD/NADH redox pair is −0.32 volts, which makes NADH a moderately strong &quot;reducing&quot; agent. The reaction is easily reversible, when NADH reduces another molecule and is re-oxidized to NAD. This means the coenzyme can continuously cycle between the NAD and NADH forms without being consumed.

In appearance, all forms of this coenzyme are white amorphous powders that are hygroscopic and highly water-soluble. The solids are stable if stored dry and in the dark. Solutions of NAD are colorless and stable for about a week at 4 °C and neutral pH, but decompose rapidly in acidic or alkaline solutions. Upon decomposition, they form products that are enzyme inhibitors.

Both NAD and NADH strongly absorb ultraviolet light because of the adenine. For example, peak absorption of NAD is at a wavelength of 259 nanometers (nm), with an extinction coefficient of 16,900 M−1cm−1. NADH also absorbs at higher wavelengths, with a second peak in UV absorption at 339 nm with an extinction coefficient of 6,220 M−1cm−1. This difference in the ultraviolet absorption spectra between the oxidized and reduced forms of the coenzymes at higher wavelengths makes it simple to measure the conversion of one to another in enzyme assays – by measuring the amount of UV absorption at 340 nm using a spectrophotometer.

NAD and NADH also differ in their fluorescence. Freely diffusing NADH in aqueous solution, when excited at the nicotinamide absorbance of ~335 nm (near-UV), fluoresces at 445–460 nm (violet to blue) with a fluorescence lifetime of 0.4 nanoseconds, while NAD does not fluoresce. The properties of the fluorescence signal changes when NADH binds to proteins, so these changes can be used to measure dissociation constants, which are useful in the study of enzyme kinetics. These changes in fluorescence are also used to measure changes in the redox state of living cells, through fluorescence microscopy.

NADH can be converted to NAD+ in a reaction catalysed by copper, which requires hydrogen peroxide. Thus, the supply of NAD+ in cells requires mitochondrial copper(II).

==Concentration and state in cells==
In rat liver, the total amount of NAD and NADH is approximately 1 μmole per gram of wet weight, about 10 times the concentration of NADP and NADPH in the same cells. The actual concentration of NAD in cell cytosol is harder to measure, with recent estimates in animal cells ranging around 0.3 mM, and approximately 1.0 to 2.0 mM in yeast. However, more than 80% of NADH fluorescence in mitochondria is from bound form, so the concentration in solution is much lower.

NAD concentrations are highest in the mitochondria, constituting 40% to 70% of the total cellular NAD. NAD in the cytosol is carried into the mitochondrion by a specific membrane transport protein, since the coenzyme cannot diffuse across membranes. The intracellular half-life of NAD+ was claimed to be between 1–2 hours by one review, whereas another review gave varying estimates based on compartment: intracellular 1–4 hours, cytoplasmic 2 hours, and mitochondrial 4–6 hours.

The balance between the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide is called the NAD/NADH ratio. This ratio is an important component of what is called the &quot;redox state&quot; of a cell, a measurement that reflects both the metabolic activities and the health of cells. The effects of the NAD/NADH ratio are complex, controlling the activity of several key enzymes, including glyceraldehyde 3-phosphate dehydrogenase and pyruvate dehydrogenase. In healthy mammalian tissues, estimates of the ratio of free NAD to NADH in the cytoplasm typically lie around 700:1; the ratio is thus favorable for oxidative reactions. The ratio of total NAD/NADH is much lower, with estimates ranging from 3–10 in mammals. In contrast, the NADP/NADPH ratio is normally about 0.005, so NADPH is the dominant form of this coenzyme. These different ratios are key to the different metabolic roles of NADH and NADPH.

==Biosynthesis==
NAD is synthesized through two metabolic pathways. It is produced either in a &quot;de novo&quot; pathway from amino acids or in salvage pathways by recycling preformed components such as nicotinamide back to NAD. Although most tissues synthesize NAD by the salvage pathway in mammals, much more &quot;de novo&quot; synthesis occurs in the liver from tryptophan, and in the kidney and macrophages from nicotinic acid.

===&quot;De novo&quot; production===
Most organisms synthesize NAD from simple components. The specific set of reactions differs among organisms, but a common feature is the generation of quinolinic acid (QA) from an amino acideither tryptophan (Trp) in animals and some bacteria, or aspartic acid (Asp) in some bacteria and plants. The quinolinic acid is converted to nicotinic acid mononucleotide (NaMN) by transfer of a phosphoribose moiety. An adenylate moiety is then transferred to form nicotinic acid adenine dinucleotide (NaAD). Finally, the nicotinic acid moiety in NaAD is amidated to a nicotinamide (Nam) moiety, forming nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide.

In a further step, some NAD is converted into NADP by NAD kinase, which phosphorylates NAD. In most organisms, this enzyme uses adenosine triphosphate (ATP) as the source of the phosphate group, although several bacteria such as &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot; and a hyperthermophilic archaeon &quot;Pyrococcus horikoshii&quot;, use inorganic polyphosphate as an alternative phosphoryl donor.

===Salvage pathways===
Despite the presence of the &quot;de novo&quot; pathway, the salvage reactions are essential in humans; a lack of vitamin B3 in the diet causes the vitamin deficiency disease pellagra. This high requirement for NAD results from the constant consumption of the coenzyme in reactions such as posttranslational modifications, since the cycling of NAD between oxidized and reduced forms in redox reactions does not change the overall levels of the coenzyme.
The major source of NAD in mammals is the salvage pathway which recycles the nicotinamide produced by enzymes utilizing NAD. The first step, and the rate-limiting enzyme in the salvage pathway is nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT), which produces nicotinamide mononucleotide (NMN). NMN is the immediate precursor to NAD+ in the salvage pathway.

Besides assembling NAD &quot;de novo&quot; from simple amino acid precursors, cells also salvage preformed compounds containing a pyridine base. The three vitamin precursors used in these salvage metabolic pathways are nicotinic acid (NA), nicotinamide (Nam) and nicotinamide riboside (NR). These compounds can be taken up from the diet and are termed vitamin B or &quot;niacin&quot;. However, these compounds are also produced within cells and by digestion of cellular NAD. Some of the enzymes involved in these salvage pathways appear to be concentrated in the cell nucleus, which may compensate for the high level of reactions that consume NAD in this organelle. There are some reports that mammalian cells can take up extracellular NAD from their surroundings, and both nicotinamide and nicotinamide riboside can be absorbed from the gut.

The salvage pathways used in microorganisms differ from those of mammals. Some pathogens, such as the yeast &quot;Candida glabrata&quot; and the bacterium &quot;Haemophilus influenzae&quot; are NAD auxotrophs – they cannot synthesize NAD – but possess salvage pathways and thus are dependent on external sources of NAD or its precursors. Even more surprising is the intracellular pathogen &quot;Chlamydia trachomatis&quot;, which lacks recognizable candidates for any genes involved in the biosynthesis or salvage of both NAD and NADP, and must acquire these coenzymes from its host.

==Functions==
Nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide has several essential roles in metabolism. It acts as a coenzyme in redox reactions, as a donor of ADP-ribose moieties in ADP-ribosylation reactions, as a precursor of the second messenger molecule cyclic ADP-ribose, as well as acting as a substrate for bacterial DNA ligases and a group of enzymes called sirtuins that use NAD to remove acetyl groups from proteins. In addition to these metabolic functions, NAD+ emerges as an adenine nucleotide that can be released from cells spontaneously and by regulated mechanisms, and can therefore have important extracellular roles.

===Oxidoreductase binding of NAD===
The main role of NAD in metabolism is the transfer of electrons from one molecule to another. Reactions of this type are catalyzed by a large group of enzymes called oxidoreductases. The correct names for these enzymes contain the names of both their substrates: for example NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase catalyzes the oxidation of NADH by coenzyme Q. However, these enzymes are also referred to as &quot;dehydrogenases&quot; or &quot;reductases&quot;, with NADH-ubiquinone oxidoreductase commonly being called &quot;NADH dehydrogenase&quot; or sometimes &quot;coenzyme Q reductase&quot;.

There are many different superfamilies of enzymes that bind NAD / NADH. One of the most common superfamilies includes a structural motif known as the Rossmann fold. The motif is named after Michael Rossmann, who was the first scientist to notice how common this structure is within nucleotide-binding proteins.

An example of a NAD-binding bacterial enzyme involved in amino acid metabolism that does not have the Rossmann fold is found in &quot;Pseudomonas syringae&quot; pv. tomato (; ).

When bound in the active site of an oxidoreductase, the nicotinamide ring of the coenzyme is positioned so that it can accept a hydride from the other substrate. Depending on the enzyme, the hydride donor is positioned either &quot;above&quot; or &quot;below&quot; the plane of the planar C4 carbon, as defined in the figure. Class A oxidoreductases transfer the atom from above; class B enzymes transfer it from below. Since the C4 carbon that accepts the hydrogen is prochiral, this can be exploited in enzyme kinetics to give information about the enzyme&#x27;s mechanism. This is done by mixing an enzyme with a substrate that has deuterium atoms substituted for the hydrogens, so the enzyme will reduce NAD by transferring deuterium rather than hydrogen. In this case, an enzyme can produce one of two stereoisomers of NADH.

Despite the similarity in how proteins bind the two coenzymes, enzymes almost always show a high level of specificity for either NAD or NADP. This specificity reflects the distinct metabolic roles of the respective coenzymes, and is the result of distinct sets of amino acid residues in the two types of coenzyme-binding pocket. For instance, in the active site of NADP-dependent enzymes, an ionic bond is formed between a basic amino acid side-chain and the acidic phosphate group of NADP. On the converse, in NAD-dependent enzymes the charge in this pocket is reversed, preventing NADP from binding. However, there are a few exceptions to this general rule, and enzymes such as aldose reductase, glucose-6-phosphate dehydrogenase, and methylenetetrahydrofolate reductase can use both coenzymes in some species.

===Role in redox metabolism===


The redox reactions catalyzed by oxidoreductases are vital in all parts of metabolism, but one particularly important area where these reactions occur is in the release of energy from nutrients. Here, reduced compounds such as glucose and fatty acids are oxidized, thereby releasing energy. This energy is transferred to NAD by reduction to NADH, as part of beta oxidation, glycolysis, and the citric acid cycle. In eukaryotes the electrons carried by the NADH that is produced in the cytoplasm are transferred into the mitochondrion (to reduce mitochondrial NAD) by mitochondrial shuttles, such as the malate-aspartate shuttle. The mitochondrial NADH is then oxidized in turn by the electron transport chain, which pumps protons across a membrane and generates ATP through oxidative phosphorylation. These shuttle systems also have the same transport function in chloroplasts.

Since both the oxidized and reduced forms of nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide are used in these linked sets of reactions, the cell maintains significant concentrations of both NAD and NADH, with the high NAD/NADH ratio allowing this coenzyme to act as both an oxidizing and a reducing agent. In contrast, the main function of NADPH is as a reducing agent in anabolism, with this coenzyme being involved in pathways such as fatty acid synthesis and photosynthesis. Since NADPH is needed to drive redox reactions as a strong reducing agent, the NADP/NADPH ratio is kept very low.

Although it is important in catabolism, NADH is also used in anabolic reactions, such as gluconeogenesis. This need for NADH in anabolism poses a problem for prokaryotes growing on nutrients that release only a small amount of energy. For example, nitrifying bacteria such as &quot;Nitrobacter&quot; oxidize nitrite to nitrate, which releases sufficient energy to pump protons and generate ATP, but not enough to produce NADH directly. As NADH is still needed for anabolic reactions, these bacteria use a nitrite oxidoreductase to produce enough proton-motive force to run part of the electron transport chain in reverse, generating NADH.

===Non-redox roles===
The coenzyme NAD is also consumed in ADP-ribose transfer reactions. For example, enzymes called ADP-ribosyltransferases add the ADP-ribose moiety of this molecule to proteins, in a posttranslational modification called ADP-ribosylation. ADP-ribosylation involves either the addition of a single ADP-ribose moiety, in &quot;mono-ADP-ribosylation&quot;, or the transferral of ADP-ribose to proteins in long branched chains, which is called &quot;poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation&quot;. Mono-ADP-ribosylation was first identified as the mechanism of a group of bacterial toxins, notably cholera toxin, but it is also involved in normal cell signaling. Poly(ADP-ribosyl)ation is carried out by the poly(ADP-ribose) polymerases. The poly(ADP-ribose) structure is involved in the regulation of several cellular events and is most important in the cell nucleus, in processes such as DNA repair and telomere maintenance. In addition to these functions within the cell, a group of extracellular ADP-ribosyltransferases has recently been discovered, but their functions remain obscure.
NAD may also be added onto cellular RNA as a 5&#x27;-terminal modification.

Another function of this coenzyme in cell signaling is as a precursor of cyclic ADP-ribose, which is produced from NAD by ADP-ribosyl cyclases, as part of a second messenger system. This molecule acts in calcium signaling by releasing calcium from intracellular stores. It does this by binding to and opening a class of calcium channels called ryanodine receptors, which are located in the membranes of organelles, such as the endoplasmic reticulum, and inducing the activation of the transcription factor NAFC3

NAD is also consumed by different NAD+-consuming enzymes, such as CD38, CD157, PARPs and the NAD-dependent deacetylases (sirtuins,such as Sir2.). These enzymes act by transferring an acetyl group from their substrate protein to the ADP-ribose moiety of NAD; this cleaves the coenzyme and releases nicotinamide and O-acetyl-ADP-ribose. The sirtuins mainly seem to be involved in regulating transcription through deacetylating histones and altering nucleosome structure. However, non-histone proteins can be deacetylated by sirtuins as well. These activities of sirtuins are particularly interesting because of their importance in the regulation of aging.

Other NAD-dependent enzymes include bacterial DNA ligases, which join two DNA ends by using NAD as a substrate to donate an adenosine monophosphate (AMP) moiety to the 5&#x27; phosphate of one DNA end. This intermediate is then attacked by the 3&#x27; hydroxyl group of the other DNA end, forming a new phosphodiester bond. This contrasts with eukaryotic DNA ligases, which use ATP to form the DNA-AMP intermediate.

Li et al. have found that NAD directly regulates protein-protein interactions. They also show that one of the causes of age-related decline in DNA repair may be increased binding of the protein DBC1 (Deleted in Breast Cancer 1) to PARP1 (poly[ADP–ribose] polymerase 1) as NAD levels decline during aging. The decline in cellular concentrations of NAD during aging likely contributes to the aging process and to the pathogenesis of the chronic diseases of aging. Thus, the modulation of NAD may protect against cancer, radiation, and aging.

===Extracellular actions of NAD+===
In recent years, NAD+ has also been recognized as an extracellular signaling molecule involved in cell-to-cell communication. NAD+ is released from neurons in blood vessels, urinary bladder, large intestine, from neurosecretory cells, and from brain synaptosomes, and is proposed to be a novel neurotransmitter that transmits information from nerves to effector cells in smooth muscle organs. In plants, the extracellular nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide induces resistance to pathogen infection and the first extracellular NAD receptor has been identified. Further studies are needed to determine the underlying mechanisms of its extracellular actions and their importance for human health and life processes in other organisms.

==Clinical significance==
The enzymes that make and use NAD and NADH are important in both pharmacology and the research into future treatments for disease. Drug design and drug development exploits NAD in three ways: as a direct target of drugs, by designing enzyme inhibitors or activators based on its structure that change the activity of NAD-dependent enzymes, and by trying to inhibit NAD biosynthesis.

Because cancer cells utilize increased glycolysis, and because NAD enhances glycolysis, nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAD salvage pathway) is often amplified in cancer cells.

It has been studied for its potential use in the therapy of neurodegenerative diseases such as Alzheimer&#x27;s and Parkinson&#x27;s disease as well as multiple sclerosis. A placebo-controlled clinical trial of NADH (which excluded NADH precursors) in people with Parkinson&#x27;s failed to show any effect.

NAD is also a direct target of the drug isoniazid, which is used in the treatment of tuberculosis, an infection caused by &quot;Mycobacterium tuberculosis&quot;. Isoniazid is a prodrug and once it has entered the bacteria, it is activated by a peroxidase enzyme, which oxidizes the compound into a free radical form. This radical then reacts with NADH, to produce adducts that are very potent inhibitors of the enzymes enoyl-acyl carrier protein reductase, and dihydrofolate reductase.

Since many oxidoreductases use NAD and NADH as substrates, and bind them using a highly conserved structural motif, the idea that inhibitors based on NAD could be specific to one enzyme is surprising. However, this can be possible: for example, inhibitors based on the compounds mycophenolic acid and tiazofurin inhibit IMP dehydrogenase at the NAD binding site. Because of the importance of this enzyme in purine metabolism, these compounds may be useful as anti-cancer, anti-viral, or immunosuppressive drugs. Other drugs are not enzyme inhibitors, but instead activate enzymes involved in NAD metabolism. Sirtuins are a particularly interesting target for such drugs, since activation of these NAD-dependent deacetylases extends lifespan in some animal models. Compounds such as resveratrol increase the activity of these enzymes, which may be important in their ability to delay aging in both vertebrate, and invertebrate model organisms. In one experiment, mice given NAD for one week had improved nuclear-mitochrondrial communication.

Because of the differences in the metabolic pathways of NAD biosynthesis between organisms, such as between bacteria and humans, this area of metabolism is a promising area for the development of new antibiotics. For example, the enzyme nicotinamidase, which converts nicotinamide to nicotinic acid, is a target for drug design, as this enzyme is absent in humans but present in yeast and bacteria.

In bacteriology, NAD, sometimes referred to factor V, is used as a supplement to culture media for some fastidious bacteria.

High-cost unlicensed infusions of NAD+ have been claimed in the UK to be &quot;clinically proven&quot; and &quot;effective&quot; treatment for alcoholism and drug abuse. NAD+ is not approved or licensed for medical use in the UK; there are likely breaches of advertising and ­medicines rules, and no proof that treatments work. Medical experts say &quot;It&#x27;s complete nonsense&quot; ... &quot;It&#x27;s untested and unproven. We don&#x27;t know anything about its efficacy or long-term safety&quot;. A November 2024 study, cited 700 times, claiming that NAD+ levels in lab rats decreased with age was withdrawn after images were found to have been manipulated, and underlying data was not provided to the publishers on request.

==History==

The coenzyme NAD was first discovered by the British biochemists Arthur Harden and William John Young in 1906. They noticed that adding boiled and filtered yeast extract greatly accelerated alcoholic fermentation in unboiled yeast extracts. They called the unidentified factor responsible for this effect a &quot;coferment&quot;. Through a long and difficult purification from yeast extracts, this heat-stable factor was identified as a nucleotide sugar phosphate by Hans von Euler-Chelpin. In 1936, the German scientist Otto Heinrich Warburg showed the function of the nucleotide coenzyme in hydride transfer and identified the nicotinamide portion as the site of redox reactions.

Vitamin precursors of NAD were first identified in 1938, when Conrad Elvehjem showed that liver has an &quot;anti-black tongue&quot; activity in the form of nicotinamide. Then, in 1939, he provided the first strong evidence that nicotinic acid is used to synthesize NAD. In the early 1940s, Arthur Kornberg was the first to detect an enzyme in the biosynthetic pathway. In 1949, the American biochemists Morris Friedkin and Albert L. Lehninger proved that NADH linked metabolic pathways such as the citric acid cycle with the synthesis of ATP in oxidative phosphorylation. In 1958, Jack Preiss and Philip Handler discovered the intermediates and enzymes involved in the biosynthesis of NAD; salvage synthesis from nicotinic acid is termed the Preiss-Handler pathway. In 2004, Charles Brenner and co-workers uncovered the nicotinamide riboside kinase pathway to NAD.

The non-redox roles of NAD(P) were discovered later. The first to be identified was the use of NAD as the ADP-ribose donor in ADP-ribosylation reactions, observed in the early 1960s. Studies in the 1980s and 1990s revealed the activities of NAD and NADP metabolites in cell signaling – such as the action of cyclic ADP-ribose, which was discovered in 1987.

The metabolism of NAD remained an area of intense research into the 21st century, with interest heightened after the discovery of the NAD-dependent protein deacetylases called sirtuins in 2000, by Shin-ichiro Imai and coworkers in the laboratory of Leonard P. Guarente. In 2009 Imai proposed the &quot;NAD World&quot; hypothesis that key regulators of aging and longevity in mammals are sirtuin 1 and the primary NAD synthesizing enzyme nicotinamide phosphoribosyltransferase (NAMPT). In 2016 Imai expanded his hypothesis to &quot;NAD World 2.0&quot;, which postulates that extracellular NAMPT from adipose tissue maintains NAD in the hypothalamus (the control center) in conjunction with myokines from skeletal muscle cells. In 2018, Napa Therapeutics was formed to develop drugs against a novel aging-related target based on the research in NAD metabolism conducted in the lab of Eric Verdin.

<text>The Society of Antiquaries of Scotland is the senior antiquarian body of Scotland, with its headquarters in the National Museum of Scotland, Chambers Street, Edinburgh. The Society&#x27;s aim is to promote the cultural heritage of Scotland. 

The usual style of post-nominal letters for fellows is FSAScot.

==History==

The Society is the oldest antiquarian society in Scotland, and the second-oldest in Britain after the Society of Antiquaries of London. Founded by David Erskine, 11th Earl of Buchan on 18 December 1780, John Stuart, 3rd Earl of Bute, the former prime minister, was elected the first President. It was incorporated by Royal Charter in 1783, in the same year as the Royal Society of Edinburgh, and in their early years both societies shared accommodation on George Street and in the Royal Institution building on The Mound. Members of the Society collected artefacts of interest to Scottish history and culture from its foundation, and soon the Society developed a sizeable collection. In November 1851 the signing of a Deed of Conveyance with the Board of Manufactures on behalf of Parliament made the Society collections National Property. In 1891 the antiquaries moved into the purpose-built Scottish National Portrait Gallery and National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland, located on Queen Street. The National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland Act 1954 transferred the powers and duties relating to the Museum, previously vested in the Society of Antiquaries and the National Galleries, to a new Board.
The Society is now an independent not-for-profit charity registered in Scotland (SC010440).

Alexander Rhind left a bequest to the Society to fund a lecture series, the Rhind Lectures are still hosted by the Society; an online recording of these prestigious lectures has been made available to the public since 2009.

==Objects==
The Society of Antiquaries of Scotland is a charitable organisation whose purpose is set out in its Royal Charter from 1783:

The first Law of the Society focuses this further:
The Society today is concerned with every aspect of the human past in Scotland. It draws on a wide range of experience through the Fellowship, and provides a voice for Scotland&#x27;s heritage independent of the opinions of Government, University, or Agency. The Society is consulted by a wide range of organisations from central government to academic funding bodies such as the Arts &amp; Humanities Research Council. The Society makes written responses to numerous consultations, some jointly with Archaeology Scotland (formerly CSA) and the Scottish Group of the Chartered Institute for Archaeologists. The Society worked closely with the Historic Environment Advisory Council for Scotland (HEACS was abolished by the Public Services Reform (Scotland) Act 2010 as part of the Scottish Government&#x27;s policy to simplify the landscape of public bodies), and gave evidence to their working groups on heritage protection legislation and properties in care. The Society has also been actively involved in the Built Environment Forum Scotland, an umbrella body for NGOs in the built and historic environment sectors.

==Fellowship==
Members of the Society have, since 1823, been known as Fellows of the Society. There are now thousands of Fellows spread across the globe, including Honorary Fellows elected for their outstanding scholarship. Fellowship recognises a person&#x27;s support and contributions to the purpose and mission of the Society, and Fellows are permitted to use the post-nominals FSAScot (NB Not FSA (Scot) or similar). The Society has an international membership of around 2800 Fellows and a maximum of 25 Honorary Fellows. Admission to the Society is by election, and candidates must be supported by existing Fellows. The names of those seeking admission are then circulated to the whole Fellowship. Elections are held biannually at the Anniversary Meeting (AGM) on St Andrew&#x27;s Day, 30 November, and in Spring, usually in April. Fundamental to being a candidate for election to the Fellowship is an interest or involvement in Scotland&#x27;s past. Candidates are advised of the outcome of the election shortly after the ballot.

Margaret E. C. Stewart (1907–1986) was the first female Honorary Fellow.

==Supporting research==
A major part of the Society&#x27;s programme is support for research into Scotland&#x27;s past, and there are various grants and awards to assist different kinds of work, from survey and excavation to finds analysis and archival research.

==Other prizes and awards==
The Society also encourages best practice and continued research into Scotland&#x27;s past through various prizes and awards.

*The RBK Stevenson Award - This award is offered annually in recognition of the article published in the &quot;Proceedings&quot; on a topic that best reflects the scholarship and high standards of this distinguished individual, who was for many years the Keeper of the National Museum of Antiquities of Scotland and was President of the Society between 1975 and 1978.
*The Dorothy Marshall Medal - Awarded every three years by the Council of the Society for an outstanding contribution, in a voluntary capacity, to Scottish archaeological or related work.
*The Murray Prize for History - Awarded biennially to recognise original research published by the Society into the history of Scotland in the medieval and/or early modern periods (c AD 500 to AD 1700).
*Chalmers-Jervise Prize - Awarded biennially for the best paper published by the Society to cover any subject in the prehistory or archaeology of Scotland before AD 1100.

==Lectures and events==
The Society hosts monthly lectures, usually between October and May, and generally held in Edinburgh, although some are jointly hosted with other Societies elsewhere in Scotland. The Society can also fund other local Societies to invite a lecturer to them; this lecture is called the Buchan Lecture.

In addition, the Society hosts the prestigious Rhind Lectures, a series of six lectures, often presented by a single lecturer over a weekend. These allow the lecturer to present their topic in much greater detail and depth than otherwise possible, and are often published. The Rhind lectures began in 1874 after the death of Alexander Henry Rhind who left the residue of his estate to endow a lectureship in the Society and there have now been over 130 lectures and many have become the published textbook for a generation.

*Society lectures and other events are now recorded where possible and placed online on the Society website free to view.
*The Rhind Lectures are similarly recorded and available to view since 2009.

==Publications==

The Society of Antiquaries of Scotland has three main publishing outputs:

*Peer-reviewed Books, previously known as monographs, covering a wide variety of topics in the history and archaeology of Scotland.
*The &quot;Proceedings of the Society of Antiquaries of Scotland&quot; (), a yearly peer-reviewed journal covering the latest archaeological and historical research in Scotland. The Society has made the entire run of the &quot;Proceedings&quot; since 1851, and its predecessor &quot;Archaeologica Scotica&quot; back to 1792, freely available on the internet.
*&quot;Scottish Archaeological Internet Reports&quot; (SAIR, ) is a peer-reviewed online publication that includes larger and more data-rich projects. It is freely accessible without subscription or payment.

There is also a regular Society &quot;Newsletter&quot; (), and the Society publishes book reviews on their website.

<text>Independence Hall is a historic civic building in Philadelphia, where both the Declaration of Independence and the Constitution of the United States were debated and adopted by the Founding Fathers of the United States. The structure, which is the centerpiece of Independence National Historical Park, was designated a World Heritage Site in 1979.

The construction of Independence Hall, initially called the Pennsylvania State House, was completed in 1753. It served as the first capitol of both the colonial-era of the Province of Pennsylvania and, following American independence, the nation&#x27;s first capital and the capital of Pennsylvania.

Between 1775 and 1781, the Second Continental Congress, which appointed George Washington as commander-in-chief of the Continental Congress in 1775 and unanimously adopted the Declaration of Independence the following year, in 1776, met at Independence Hall. On June 21, 1788, it was the site of the Philadelphia Convention, where the U.S. Constitution, the longest-standing written and codified national constitution in the world, was drafted and ratified.

In 1915, former-U.S. president William Howard Taft presided over a convention at Independence Hall, which including his formal announcement of the formation of the League to Enforce Peace, which led to the League of Nations in 1920 and the United Nations in 1945.

==Preparation for construction==

In spring 1729, proposals were submitted to build a state house in Philadelphia, then the nation&#x27;s capital. Approximately 2,000 pounds sterling was committed to the project, and a committee including Thomas Lawrence, John Kearsley, and Andrew Hamilton was charged with selecting a site for the building&#x27;s construction, acquiring plans for it, and contracting a company for its construction. Hamilton and his future son-in-law William Allen, who was later chief justice of the Province of Pennsylvania, were named trustees and were authorized to purchase the land for the proposed state house. By October 1730, they had purchased lots on Chestnut Street for the building.

By 1732, Hamilton acquired the deed for Lot no. 2 from surveyor David Powell, who was paid for his work on the lot, but tensions began arising among the committee members. Kearsley and Hamilton disagreed on a number of issues concerning the state house. Kearsley, who designed Christ Church and St. Peter&#x27;s Church in Philadelphia, had plans for the design, but so did Hamilton. The two men also disagreed on the building&#x27;s site; Kearsley sought to have it constructed on High Street, which is present-day Market Street, and Hamilton favored Chestnut Street. Lawrence said nothing on the matter of its location.

The disagreements escalated to the point where arbitration was needed. On August 8, 1733, Hamilton brought the matter before the Provincial Assembly. He explained that Kearsley did not approve of his plans for the state house&#x27;s location and architecture and argued that the assembly had not agreed to these decisions. Three days later, Hamilton showed his plans for the state house to the assembly, which accepted them. On August 14, the assembly sided with Hamilton, granting him full authority over the project, and the current site on the south side of Chestnut Street between Fifth and Sixth Streets was chosen as its location. Ground was broken for construction soon after.

==Structure==

Independence Hall has a red brick façade, designed in Georgian style. It consists of a central building with belltower and steeple, attached to two smaller wings via arcaded hyphens. The highest point to the tip of the steeple spire is above the ground.

The State House was built between 1732 and 1753, designed by Edmund Woolley and Andrew Hamilton, and built by Woolley. Its construction was commissioned by the Pennsylvania colonial legislature which paid for construction as funds were available, so it was finished piecemeal. It was initially inhabited by the colonial government of Pennsylvania as its State House, from 1732 to 1799.

In 1752, when Isaac Norris was selecting a man to build the first clock for the State House he chose Thomas Stretch, the son of Peter Stretch his old friend and fellow council member, to do the job.
In 1753, Stretch erected a giant clock at the building&#x27;s west end that resembled a tall clock (grandfather clock). The limestone base was capped with a wooden case surrounding the clock&#x27;s face, which was carved by cabinetmaker Samuel Harding. The clock was removed about 1830. The clock&#x27;s dials were mounted at the east and west ends of the main building connected by rods to the clock movement in the middle of the building. A new clock was designed and installed by Isaiah Lukens in 1828. The Lukens clock ran consecutively for eight days, &quot;with four copper dials on each side that measured eight feet in diameter and clockworks that ensured sufficient power to strike the four-thousand pound bell made by John Wilbank.&quot; The Lukens clock remained in Independence Hall until 1877.

The acquisition of the original clock and bell by the Pennsylvania Colonial Assembly is closely related to the acquisition of the Liberty Bell. By mid-1753, the clock had been installed in the State House attic, but it was six years before Thomas Stretch received any pay for it.

===Demolition and reconstruction===
While the shell of the central portion of the building is original, the side wings, steeple and much of the interior were reconstructed much later. In 1781, the Pennsylvania Assembly had the wooden steeple removed from the main building. The steeple had rotted and weakened to a dangerous extent by 1773, but it was not until 1781 that the Assembly had it removed and had the brick tower covered with a hipped roof. A more elaborate steeple, designed by William Strickland, was added in 1828.

The original wings and hyphens (connecting corridors) were demolished and replaced in 1812. In 1898, these were in turn demolished and replaced with reconstructions of the original wings.

The building was renovated numerous times in the 19th and 20th century. The current interior is a mid-20th-century reconstruction by the National Park Service with the public rooms restored to their 18th-century appearance.

During the summer of 1973, a replica of the Thomas Stretch clock was restored to Independence Hall.

The second-floor Governor&#x27;s Council Chamber, furnished with important examples of the era by the National Park Service, includes a musical tall case clock made by Peter Stretch, c. 1740, one of the most prominent clockmakers in early America and father of Thomas Stretch.

Two smaller buildings adjoin the wings of Independence Hall: Old City Hall to the east, and Congress Hall to the west. These three buildings are together on a city block known as Independence Square, along with Philosophical Hall, the original home of the American Philosophical Society. Since its construction in the mid-20th century, to the north has been Independence Mall, which includes the current home of the Liberty Bell.

===Liberty Bell===
The lowest chamber of the original wooden steeple was the first home of the Liberty Bell. When that steeple was removed in the 1780s, the bell was lowered into the highest chamber of the brick tower, where it remained until the 1850s. The much larger Centennial Bell, created for the Centennial Exposition in Philadelphia in 1876, hangs in the cupola of the 1828 steeple. The Liberty Bell, with its distinctive crack, was displayed on the ground floor of the hall from the 1850s until 1976, and is now on display across the street in the Liberty Bell Center.

==Declaration of Independence and Second Continental Congress==

From May 10, 1775, to 1783, the Pennsylvania State House served as the principal meeting place of the Second Continental Congress, a body of representatives from each of the thirteen British North American colonies.

On June 14, 1775, delegates of the Continental Congress, gathered in the Assembly Room of the Pennsylvania State House, established the Continental Army and appointed George Washington. The Congress appointed Benjamin Franklin as the first Postmaster General of what later became the United States Post Office Department slightly over a month later, on July 26.

On July 4, 1776, the United States Declaration of Independence was unanimously approved in present-day Independence Hall. The Declaration was read aloud to the public in the area now known as Independence Square. This document unified the colonies in North America who declared themselves independent of the Kingdom of Great Britain and explained their justifications for doing so. These historic events are celebrated annually with a national holiday for U.S. Independence Day. There are 56 signatures on the Declaration of Independence, including John Hancock who signed first, writing his name in very large letters. The prominence of this signature led to the term &quot;John Hancock&quot; or &quot;Hancock&quot; becoming a colloquial term in the United States for one&#x27;s signature.

The Congress continued to meet in the Pennsylvania State House until December 12, 1776, when Congress was forced to evacuate Philadelphia during the British occupation of Philadelphia. During the British occupation of Philadelphia, the Continental Congress met in Baltimore, Maryland from December 20, 1776, to February 27, 1777. The Congress returned to Philadelphia from March 4, 1777, to September 18, 1777.

In September 1777, the British Army again sought to occupy Philadelphia, once again forcing the Continental Congress to abandon Philadelphia. The Congress then met in Lancaster, Pennsylvania, for a day on September 27, 1777, and then in York, Pennsylvania, for nine months from September 30, 1777 to June 27, 1778, where the Articles of Confederation were approved in November 1777. The Second Continental Congress then returned to Independence Hall, for its final meetings, from July 2, 1778, to March 1, 1781.

Under the Articles of Confederation, the Congress of the Confederation initially met in Independence Hall, from March 1, 1781, to June 21, 1783. Following the Pennsylvania Mutiny of 1783, Congress moved from Philadelphia again in June 1783, convening in Princeton, New Jersey, and eventually in several other cities prior to completion of the national capital of Washington, D.C. in 1800.

==U.S. Constitutional Convention==
In September 1786, commissioners from five states met in the Annapolis Convention to discuss adjustments to the Articles of Confederation that would improve commerce. They invited state representatives to convene in Philadelphia to discuss improvements to the federal government. After debate, the Congress of the Confederation endorsed the plan to revise the Articles of Confederation on February 21, 1787. Twelve states, Rhode Island being the exception, accepted this invitation and sent delegates to convene in June 1787 at Independence Hall.

The resolution calling the Convention specified its purpose as proposing amendments to the Articles, but the Convention decided to propose a rewritten Constitution. The Philadelphia Convention voted to keep deliberations secret, and to keep the Hall&#x27;s windows shut throughout the hot summer. The result was the drafting of a new fundamental government design. On September 17, 1787, the Constitution was completed, and took effect on March 4, 1789, when the new Congress met for the first time in New York&#x27;s Federal Hall.

Article One, Section Eight, of the United States Constitution granted Congress the authority to create a federal district to serve as the national capital. Following the ratification of the Constitution, the Congress, while meeting in New York, passed the Residence Act of 1790, which established the District of Columbia as the new federal capital. However, a representative from Pennsylvania, Robert Morris, did manage to convince Congress to return to Philadelphia while the new permanent capital was being built. As a result, the Residence Act also declared Philadelphia to be the temporary capital for a period of ten years. The Congress moved back into Philadelphia on December 6, 1790, and met at Congress Hall, adjacent to Independence Hall, until moving to Washington, D.C., in 1800.

==Funerary procession of Abraham Lincoln==

Following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, the nation&#x27;s 16th president, Lincoln&#x27;s body and the disinterred coffin of his son Willie, who had predeceased him in 1862, were taken by train from Washington, D.C., to Springfield, Illinois, for burial. The train route essentially retraced the route Lincoln traveled en route to the nation&#x27;s capital as president-elect in 1861 with the removal of stops in Pittsburgh and Cincinnati and the addition of Chicago. The train left Washington, D.C. for Baltimore at 8:00 am on April 21, 1865.

Lincoln&#x27;s funeral train, known as the &quot;Lincoln Special&quot;, left Harrisburg, Pennsylvania, on Saturday, April 22, 1865, at 11:15 am and arrived at Philadelphia at Broad Street Station that afternoon at 4:30 pm. It was carried by hearse past a crowd of 85,000 people and was held in state in the Assembly Room in the east wing of Independence Hall. While there, it was escorted and guarded by a detail of 27 naval and military officers. That evening, a private viewing was arranged for honored guests of the mourners. The next day, (Sunday, April 23, 1865) lines began forming at 5:00 am. Over 300,000 mourners viewed the body – some waiting 5 hours just to see him. The Lincoln Special left Philadelphia&#x27;s Kensington Station for New York City the next morning, on Monday, April 24, 1865, at 4:00 am.

==League to Enforce Peace==

The symbolic use of the hall was illustrated on June 17, 1915, where the League to Enforce Peace was formed here with former President William Howard Taft presiding. They proposed an international governing body under which participating nations would commit to &quot;jointly...use...their economic and military forces against any one of their number making war against another&quot; and &quot;to formulate and codify rules of international law&quot;.

==Preservation==
The original steeple was demolished in 1781 due to structural problems. The wings and hyphens were demolished in 1812 and replaced by larger buildings designed by architect Robert Mills and a new, more elaborate steeple designed by William Strickland, constructed in 1828. The north entrance was also rebuilt during this period.

From 1802 to 1827, artist Charles Willson Peale housed his Philadelphia Museum of natural history specimens, including the skeleton of a mastodon, and portraits of famous Americans, on the second floor of the Old State House and in the Assembly Room.

In early 1816, the Commonwealth of Pennsylvania sold the State House to the City of Philadelphia, with a contract signed by the governor. The deed, however, was not transferred until more than two years later. Philadelphia has owned the State House and its associated buildings and grounds since that time.

In 1898, the Mills wings were removed and replaced with replicas of the originals, but the Strickland steeple was left in place.

In 1948, the building&#x27;s interior was restored to its original appearance. Independence National Historical Park was established by the 80th U.S. Congress later that year to preserve historical sites associated with the American Revolution. Independence National Historical Park comprises a landscaped area of four city blocks, as well as outlying sites that include Independence Square, Carpenters&#x27; Hall (meeting place of the First Continental Congress), the site of Benjamin Franklin&#x27;s home, the reconstructed Graff House (where Thomas Jefferson wrote the Declaration of Independence), City Tavern (center of Revolutionary War activities), restored period residences, and several early banks. The park also holds the Liberty Bell, Franklin&#x27;s desk, the Syng inkstand, a portrait gallery, gardens, and libraries. A product of extensive documentary research and archaeology by the federal government, the restoration of Independence Hall and other buildings in the park set standards for other historic preservation and stimulated rejuvenation of old Philadelphia. The site, administered by the National Park Service, is listed as a World Heritage Site by UNESCO (joining only three other U.S. man-made monuments still in use, the others being the Statue of Liberty, Pueblo de Taos, and the combined site of the University of Virginia and Monticello).

Independence Hall and the Liberty Bell are now protected in a secure zone with entry at security screening buildings. Following the September 11, 2001 attacks, as part of a national effort to safeguard historical monuments by the United States Department of Homeland Security, pedestrian traffic around Independence Square and part of Independence Mall was restricted by temporary bicycle barriers and park rangers. In 2006, the National Park Service proposed installing a seven-foot security fence around Independence Hall and bisecting Independence Square, a plan that met with opposition from Philadelphia city officials, Pennsylvania Governor Ed Rendell, and Senator Arlen Specter. As of January 2007, the National Park Service plan was revised to eliminate the fence in favor of movable bollards and chains, and also to remove at least some of the temporary barriers to pedestrians and visitors.

==Legacy==
On July 16, 1987, Congress met at Independence Hall in an unprecedented joint meeting outside of Washington, to commemorate the 200th anniversary of the Connecticut Compromise that determined the structure of Congress during the Constitutional Convention.

The 1989 film &quot;A More Perfect Union&quot;, which portrays the events of the 1787 Constitutional Convention, was largely filmed in Independence Hall.

Because of its symbolic history, Independence Hall has been used in more recent times as a venue for speeches and protests in support of democratic and civil rights movements. On October 26, 1918, Tomáš Masaryk proclaimed the independence of Czechoslovakia on the steps of Independence Hall. National Freedom Day, which commemorates the struggles of African Americans for equality and justice, has been celebrated at Independence Hall since 1942. On Independence Day, July 4, 1962, President John F. Kennedy gave an address there.

Annual demonstrations organized by the East Coast Homophile Organizations advocating for gay rights were held in front of Independence Hall each July 4 from 1965 to 1969.

Independence Hall has been pictured on the back of the U.S. $100 bill since 1928, and was depicted on the 1975-76 bicentennial Kennedy half dollar. The Assembly Room is pictured on the reverse of the U.S. two-dollar bill, from the original painting by John Trumbull entitled &quot;Declaration of Independence&quot;.

===Replicas===
Independence Hall served as the model for the Pennsylvania Building at the 1893 World&#x27;s Columbian Exposition, the Pennsylvania Building at the 1907 Jamestown Exposition, and the Pennsylvania Pavilion at the 1939 New York World&#x27;s Fair. Dozens of structures replicating or loosely inspired by Independence Hall&#x27;s iconic design have been built elsewhere in the United States, including a brick-by-brick replica across from Knott&#x27;s Berry Farm in Buena Park, California.

<text>The Second Continental Congress (1775–1781) was the meetings of delegates from the Thirteen Colonies that united in support of the American Revolution and Revolutionary War, which established American independence from the British Empire. The Congress constituted a new federation that it first named the United Colonies of North America, and in 1776, renamed the United States of America. The Congress began convening in present-day Independence Hall in Philadelphia, on May 10, 1775, with representatives from 12 of the 13 colonies, following the Battles of Lexington and Concord, the first battles of the Revolutionary War, which were fought on April 19, 1775. 

The Second Continental Congress succeeded the First Continental Congress, which met from September 5 to October 26, 1774, also in Philadelphia. The Second Congress functioned as the &quot;de facto&quot; federation government at the outset of the Revolutionary War by raising militias, directing strategy, appointing diplomats, and writing petitions such as the Declaration of the Causes and Necessity of Taking Up Arms and the Olive Branch Petition. All 13 colonies were represented by the time the Congress adopted the Lee Resolution, which declared independence from Great Britain on July 2, 1776, and the Congress unanimously agreed to the Declaration of Independence two days later. 

Congress functioned as the provisional government of the United States of America through March 1, 1781, when congress became what is now often called the Confederation Congress. During this period, it successfully managed the war effort, drafted the Articles of Confederation and Perpetual Union, adopted the first U.S. constitution, secured diplomatic recognition and support from foreign nations, and resolved state land claims west of the Appalachian Mountains.

Many of the delegates who attended the Second Congress had also attended the First. They again elected Peyton Randolph as president of the Congress and Charles Thomson as secretary. Notable new arrivals included Benjamin Franklin of Pennsylvania and John Hancock of Massachusetts. Within two weeks, Randolph was summoned back to Virginia to preside over the House of Burgesses; Hancock succeeded him as president, and Thomas Jefferson replaced Randolph in the Virginia delegation. The number of participating colonies also grew, as Georgia endorsed the Congress in July 1775 and adopted the continental ban on trade with Britain.

==History==


===&quot;De facto&quot; government===
The First Continental Congress had sent entreaties to King George III to stop the Intolerable Acts. They also created the Continental Association to establish a coordinated protest of these acts, boycotting British goods in protest to them. The Second Continental Congress met on May 10, 1775, to plan further responses if the British government did not repeal or modify the acts; however, the American Revolutionary War had started by that time with the Battles of Lexington and Concord, and the Congress was called upon to take charge of the war effort.

For the first few months of the Revolutionary War, the patriots carried on their struggle in a largely ad-hoc and uncoordinated manner. Even so, they had numerous successes, seizing numerous British arsenals, driving royal officials out of several colonies, and launching the Siege of Boston in order to prevent the movement by land of British troops stationed there. On June 14, 1775, the Second Continental Congress voted to create the Continental Army out of the militia units around Boston, and the next day unanimously approved a motion naming George Washington of Virginia as its commanding general. 

On July 6, 1775, Congress approved a Declaration of Causes outlining the rationale and necessity for taking up arms in the Thirteen Colonies. Two days later, delegates signed the Olive Branch Petition to King George III affirming the colonies&#x27; loyalty to the crown and imploring the king to prevent further conflict. However, by the time British Colonial Secretary Lord Dartmouth received the petition, King George III had already issued a proclamation on August 23, 1775, in response to the Battle of Bunker Hill, declaring elements of Britain&#x27;s continental American possessions to be in a state of what he called an &quot;open and avowed rebellion&quot;. As a result, the king refused to receive the petition.

Georgia had not participated in the First Continental Congress and did not initially send delegates to the Second. But with the Revolutionary War escalating, the residents of St. John&#x27;s Parish in present-day Liberty County sent Lyman Hall to the gathering in Philadelphia on their behalf. He participated in debates but did not vote, as he did not represent the entire colony. That changed after July 1775, when a provincial Congress decided to send delegates to the Continental Congress and to adopt a ban on trade with Britain.

The Continental Congress had no explicit legal authority from the British to govern, but it assumed all the functions of a national government, including appointing ambassadors, signing treaties, raising armies, appointing generals, obtaining loans from Europe, issuing paper money called &quot;Continentals&quot;, and disbursing funds. Congress had no authority to levy taxes and was required to request money, supplies, and troops from the states to support the war effort. Individual states frequently ignored these requests.

Congress was moving towards declaring independence from the British Empire in 1776, but many delegates lacked the authority from their home governments to take such drastic action. Advocates of independence moved to have reluctant colonial governments revise instructions to their delegations, or even replace those governments which would not authorize independence. On May 10, 1776, Congress passed a resolution recommending that any colony with a government that was not inclined toward independence should form one that was. On May 15, they adopted a more radical preamble to this resolution, drafted by John Adams, which advised throwing off oaths of allegiance and suppressing the authority of the Crown in any colonial government that still derived its authority from the Crown. That same day, the Virginia Convention instructed its delegation in Philadelphia to propose a resolution that called for a declaration of independence, the formation of foreign alliances, and a confederation of the states. The resolution of independence was delayed for several weeks, as advocates of independence consolidated support in their home governments.

On June 7, 1776, Richard Henry Lee offered the resolution before the Congress, declaring the colonies independent. He urged Congress to resolve &quot;to take the most effectual measures for forming foreign Alliances&quot; and to prepare a plan of confederation for the newly independent states. Lee argued that independence was the only way to ensure a foreign alliance since no European monarchs would deal with America if they remained Britain&#x27;s colonies. American leaders had rejected the divine right of kings in the New World, but recognized the necessity of proving their credibility in the Old World.

Congress formally adopted the resolution of independence, but only after creating three overlapping committees to draft the Declaration, a Model Treaty, and the Articles of Confederation. The Declaration announced the states&#x27; entry into the international system; the model treaty was designed to establish amity and commerce with other states, and the Articles of Confederation established &quot;a firm league&quot; among the thirteen free and independent states. These three things together constituted an international agreement to set up central institutions for conducting vital domestic and foreign affairs. Congress finally approved the resolution of independence on July 2, 1776. They next turned their attention to a formal explanation of this decision, the United States Declaration of Independence which was approved on July 4 and published soon thereafter.

===Provisional government===
The Congress moved to Baltimore in the winter of 1776–77 to avoid capture by British forces who were advancing on Philadelphia during the British Army&#x27;s attempt to capture the city, which was then the revolutionary capital of the Thirteen Colonies. In Baltimore, the Congress met at Henry Fite&#x27;s tavern, the largest building in Baltimore at the time, which provided a comfortable location of sufficient size for Congress to meet. Its site at the western edge of town was beyond easy reach of the British Royal Navy&#x27;s ships should they attempt to sail up the harbor and the Patapsco River to shell the town. Congress was again forced to flee Philadelphia at the end of September 1777, as British troops seized and occupied the city; they moved to York, Pennsylvania, where they continued their work.

Congress passed the Articles of Confederation on November 15, 1777, after more than a year of debate, and sent it to the states for ratification. Approval by all 13 states was required for the establishment of the constitution. Jefferson&#x27;s proposal for a Senate to represent the states and a House to represent the people was rejected, but a similar proposal was adopted later in the United States Constitution. One issue of debate was large states wanting a larger say, nullified by small states who feared tyranny. The small states prevailed, and each state was afforded one vote. Another revolved around the issue of western land claims; states without such claims wanted those with claims to yield them to Congress. As written, western land claims remained in the hands of the individual states. Congress urged the states to give their assent quickly, and most did. The first to ratify was Virginia on December 16, 1777; 12 states had ratified the Articles by February 1779, 14 months into the process. The lone holdout, Maryland, finally ratified the Articles on February 2, 1781, doing so only after Virginia relinquished its claims on land north of the Ohio River to Congress.

<doc id="365563" wikidata="Q1327341" url="?curid=365563" title="Quttinirpaaq National Park">
<text>Quttinirpaaq National Park is located on the northeastern corner of Ellesmere Island in the Qikiqtaaluk Region of Nunavut, Canada. It is the second most northerly park on Earth after Northeast Greenland National Park. In Inuktitut, Quttinirpaaq means &quot;top of the world&quot;. It was established as Ellesmere Island National Park Reserve in 1988, and the name was changed to Quttinirpaaq in 1999, when Nunavut was created, and became a national park in 2000.
The reserve covers , making it the second largest park in Canada, after Wood Buffalo National Park.

The park is remarkable for its extensive glaciers and ice caps, desert-like conditions, and life forms that are uniquely adapted to the extreme polar environment. Only about 50 people visit the park each year.

== Landscape and weather ==
The land is dominated by rock and ice. It is a polar desert with very little annual precipitation.

Much of the highlands of the park are covered in ice caps. These ice caps, and the glaciers that descend from them, date back at least to the last episode of glaciation.

The park includes Barbeau Peak, part of the Arctic Cordillera, which at is the highest mountain in Nunavut.

The park, located in the high arctic, sees 24 hours of daylight (&quot;midnight sun&quot;) from May to August, and 24 hours of darkness (polar night) from November to February. Winters in the national park are very cold and are known for having some of Canada&#x27;s lowest recorded temperatures. Summers are short and often feature cool temperatures and winter-like conditions, though the Lake Hazen region is known for having warmer temperatures.

== Wildlife ==
Some wildlife, notably Arctic hares, lemmings, muskoxen and Arctic wolves reside in this national park, but sparse vegetation and low temperatures support only small populations. There is a very small Peary caribou population as well. Other animal inhabitants include ringed seals, bearded seals, walruses, polar bears, and narwhals. During summer months, birds nest in the park including semipalmated plovers, red knots, gyrfalcons and long-tailed jaegers. Common plants include dwarf willow, arctic willow, and Arctic cotton, in addition to grasses and lichens. Plant and animal life is more concentrated in the Lake Hazen region, given its milder climate compared to the surrounding ice cap-covered mountains and valleys.

== Human history ==
Due to its high latitude and limited wildlife, there has never been any significant human presence within this part of Ellesmere Island. The pass from Tanquary Fiord through to Lake Hazen shows evidence of being used by Arctic people since about 5000 years ago. Tent rings and food caches show that the area was visited by pre-Dorset, Dorset and Thule people, the ancestors of modern Inuit.

The east and north end of the island was used as a starting point for various polar explorations. Fort Conger was an early Arctic exploration research base, and is now maintained as a Federal Heritage Building.

== Park ==
Parks Canada maintains warden stations and gravel air strips at Tanquary Fiord Airport, Lake Hazen and Ward Island. The air strips at Tanquary Fiord and Lake Hazen are the main access points for tourists. Beyond these warden stations, there are no facilities within the park itself; however, the Inuit, First Nations, Transport Canada, Parks Canada, and other stakeholders are investigating the possibility of a railway from Churchill, Manitoba; Schefferville, Quebec; or Cochrane, Ontario to Alert, Nunavut via Arctic Bay, Grise Fiord, and Quttinirpaaq National Park. Two backpacking routes are the route between Lake Hazen and Tanquary Fiord, and a loop around the Ad Astra and Viking ice caps, both approximately .

In 2004, the park was one of nine sites added to Canada&#x27;s tentative list of potential World Heritage Sites.

The park was honoured on a postage stamp issued by Canada Post on January 14, 2019. It was a first-class rate stamp, issued at a value of 90 cents, and part of a nine-stamp definitive (regular) set issued the same day, in a series which debuted in 2018.

<text>Te Papa-Kura-o-Taranaki (formerly Egmont National Park) is located south of New Plymouth, close to the west coast of the North Island of New Zealand. The park covers three volcanic cones: Mount Taranaki and its slopes, Pouakai and Kaitake. The park was first created in 1881 as a forest reserve and went on to become New Zealand’s second national park, preceded by Tongariro National Park, in 1900. 

The forest reserve was created within a 6-mile (9.6-kilometre) radius around the cone of the dormant Mount Taranaki volcano. Areas encompassing the older volcanic remnants of Pouakai and Kaitake were later added to the reserve at the northwest side. The forest is surrounded on all sides by pasture, giving it a distinctly circular shape.

==Climate==
The park receives massive annual rainfall. Moist westerlies from the Tasman Sea form Orographic precipitation when they reach Mount Taranaki and the adjacent Pouakai and Kaitake ranges. Since the area has high annual rainfall and a mild coastal climate there is a lush rainforest covering the foothills, a forest that is nationally significant for the total absence of beech trees (genus &quot;Nothofagus&quot;).

==Ecology==

=== Flora ===
A rich northern rātā/rimu/broadleaf forest is present, although the entire park ecosystem displays distinct patterns of altitudinal zonation – the former two large species of tree are common at lower elevations whereas kāmahi tends to dominate the stunted high elevation forest. In these old growth forests the crown fern (&quot;Blechnum discolor&quot;) is a dominant understory plant species.

The character of the plant communities continues to change with increasing elevation, to subalpine and alpine shrublands at high elevations, which are in stark contrast to the surrounding pasture farmlands. Notable among the geographical features of the park is its clear radial drainage pattern, which can be discerned in the satellite picture at right.

The Ahukawakawa Swamp is a rare high-elevation (920 m) sphagnum moss wetland located between Mount Taranaki and the Pouakai Range. It contains many endemic species adapted to acid soils and low temperatures.

=== Fauna ===
The national park is integral habitat for many species of birds that rely on the large forest. Threatened bird species within the park include Blue duck (whio), North Island brown kiwi and fernbird. Nearly half of New Zealand&#x27;s indigenous fish species are found in the park, including threatened Giant kōkopu, Shortjaw kōkopu, Banded kōkopu and kōaro.

Introduced feral goats have historically degraded the forest understory. However, the park was declared free of feral goats in 2022, the first national park in New Zealand to be free of ungulates, as it was already free of feral pigs and deer. Pest animals present include possums, rodents, hares, stoats, weasels and ferrets.

<text>John Titor and TimeTravel_0 are pseudonyms used in communications and on internet forums between 1998 and 2001 by an individual claiming to be an American military time traveler from the year 2036. His posts discussed various aspects of time travel, and described future calamitous events, including a global nuclear war that he predicted would take place in 2015.

The story fascinated early internet communities, but the increasing inaccuracy of the predictions and other inconsistencies led many to view it with skepticism and try to discover who created it. A 2009 investigation suggested that the affair was a hoax started by Larry Haber, a Florida entertainment lawyer, or one of his brothers, John Rick Haber or Morey Haber, both of whom have careers in computers and information technology. However, the Habers and other suspects have denied these reports, and no one has publicly claimed to be the originator of the Titor posts.

== Titor&#x27;s posts ==
The first posts using John Titor&#x27;s military symbol appeared on the &quot;Time Travel Institute&quot; forums on November 2, 2000, under the username &quot;TimeTravel_0&quot; (The name &quot;John Titor&quot; was not used at that time.) The posts discussed time travel in general, the first one being the &quot;six parts&quot; description of the components required for a working time machine and responses to questions from other posters about how such a machine might work. These early posts tended to be short. A second thread was also made due to shortcomings of the forum software used at the time.

Titor first appeared on July 29, 1998, and sent two faxes to Art Bell, the host of a very popular and nationally broadcast radio talk show &quot;Coast to Coast AM&quot;. The two faxes told the story of the discovery of time travel in 2034 and the devastation that followed the Y2K disaster.

In January 2001, the person calling themself “John Titor” used the pseudonym TimeTravel_0 and began posting at the Art Bell Post-2-Post BBS Forums. The final Titor post was made in late March 2001.

Later, around 2003, various websites compiled Titor&#x27;s posts, re-arranging them into narratives. Not all of these sites refer to the original dates that the messages were posted on the forums.
In his online postings, Titor claimed to be an American soldier from the year 2036, based in Tampa, Florida. He said that he was assigned to a governmental time-travel project, and that as part of the project he was sent back to 1975 to retrieve an IBM 5100 computer, which was needed to debug various legacy computer programs that existed in 2036 – a possible reference to the UNIX year 2038 problem. The IBM 5100 runs the APL and/or BASIC programming languages, depending on the model.

Titor said that he had been selected for this mission because his paternal grandfather was directly involved in the original assembly and programming of the 5100. He attempted to provide proof of this by describing unpublicized features of the 5100, which led some people to believe that a computer scientist must have been behind the postings. 

Titor said that he was on a stopover in the year 2000 for &quot;personal reasons&quot;: to collect pictures lost in the (future) civil war, and to visit his family, of whom he spoke often.

Titor also said that for several months he had been trying to warn anyone who would listen about the potential threat of Creutzfeldt–Jakob disease spread through beef products, and about the possibility of an upcoming civil war within the United States. 

When questioned about the topic, Titor also expressed interest in mysteries such as UFOs, which he said remained unexplained in his time. Titor suggested that UFOs and extraterrestrials might be time travelers with superior time machines, from much further into the future than his own time.

=== Time machine ===
Titor described his time machine on several occasions. In one early post, he described it as a &quot;stationary mass, temporal displacement unit powered by two top-spin, dual positive singularities&quot;, and producing a &quot;standard off-set Tipler sinusoid&quot;.

The earliest post was more explicit, detailing the components of the machine:
* Two magnetic housing units for the dual micro singularities
* An electron injection manifold, to alter mass and gravity of the micro singularities
* A cooling and X-ray venting system
* Gravity sensors, or a variable gravity lock
* Four main cesium clocks
* Three main computer units
According to the posts, the device was installed in the rear of a 1966 Chevrolet Corvette convertible. Later posts mentioned a 1987 truck with four-wheel drive.

=== Predictions ===
Although he frequently invoked the many-worlds interpretation of quantum mechanics, whereby events from his timeline may differ from our own, Titor also said that the differences would be minimal. As such, some have interpreted his descriptions of his timeline as predictions, and have compared them with actual historical events that have occurred since Titor&#x27;s final post in 2001.

The most immediate of Titor&#x27;s predictions foretold a civil war in the United States having to do with &quot;order and rights&quot;. The war as Titor described it would begin in 2005&lt;ref name=&quot;John Titor, 2/1/01 8:36&quot;&gt;John Titor, 2/1/01 8:36&lt;/ref&gt; with civil unrest surrounding the presidential election of the previous year. According to Titor, this civil conflict, which he described as &quot;having a Waco type event every month that steadily gets worse&quot;, would be &quot;pretty much at everyone&#x27;s doorstep&quot; and erupt into war by 2008. As a result, the United States would split into five regions based on a variety of factors, including differing military objectives. 

According to Titor, this civil war would end in 2015 with a brief but intense World War III, which Titor referred to as &quot;N Day&quot;. He specified Washington, D.C. and Jacksonville, Florida as cities that would be hit in the exchange, and said that after the war, Omaha, Nebraska would be the new U.S. capital. Titor did not detail the exact causes of this World War III scenario, but in one post he said that the hostilities were led by &quot;border clashes and overpopulation&quot;. He also pointed to the contemporary Arab-Israeli conflict not as a cause of the war, but as a milestone that precedes it.

Titor said that in 2011, when he was 13 years old, he joined a Florida-based shotgun infantry unit called the Fighting Diamondbacks for at least four years. In other posts, he described himself as hiding from the war.

Titor also said that the &quot;Everett–Wheeler model of quantum physics&quot;, better known as the many-worlds interpretation, was correct. According to him, this meant that his time travel had caused the formation of a new timestream, and that in this new (current) timestream, the events that Titor had described would occur somewhat differently than they had in his home timestream. This made his predictions non-falsifiable.

== Criticism and discussion ==
&quot;The New Republic&quot; described Titor as the most famous of several internet forum posters who claimed to be time travelers.

An Italian television program, &quot;Voyager – Ai confini della conoscenza&quot;, aired the results of an investigation of John Titor on May 19, 2008. Private investigator Mike Lynch found no registry evidence, past or present, of any individual named John Titor. He did, however, identify the John Titor Foundation, which was a for-profit company formed on September 16, 2003, and had no office or address other than a rented post box in Kissimmee, Florida. An IP address connected with Titor also geolocated to Kissimmee.

In 2009, a report by John Hughston of the Hoax Hunter website pointed to Larry Haber, a Florida entertainment lawyer, as the CEO of the foundation. Lynch concluded that Larry Haber and his brother Richard, a computer scientist, were very likely the men behind John Titor, whom they actually introduced in 1998, accompanied by different predictions, including chaos due to the Y2K &quot;bug&quot;. John Hughston also reported that John Titor is a trademark registered with the United States Patent and Trademark Office; the Titor trademark is now classified as &quot;Abandoned&quot;.

In 2018, multimedia artist Joseph Matheny, creator of the alternate reality game &quot;Ong&#x27;s Hat&quot;, said that he worked as a consultant for the unnamed individuals responsible for the legend. John Titor &quot;is a story that was created as a literary experiment by people who were observing what I was doing with Ong&#x27;s Hat and these people wanted to do something like that. I was a consultant on the project, [but] it wasn&#x27;t my project.&quot;

== In popular culture ==
* In 2003, the John Titor Foundation published a book, &quot;John Titor: A Time Traveler&#x27;s Tale&quot; (), discussing his claims; the book is now out of print.
* The 2009 visual novel &quot;Steins;Gate&quot;, which was adapted into an anime in 2011, heavily features time travel and has John Titor as a major part of the plot.
* In 2009, a docudrama was created about John Titor called Timetravel_0 directed by Scott Norwood.
* Titor was referred to in the shonen supernatural horror manga &quot;Magical Girl Apocalypse&quot;.

<doc id="365583" wikidata="Q1850800" url="?curid=365583" title="Battle of the Saintes">
<text>The Battle of the Saintes (known to the French as the Bataille de la Dominique), also known as the Battle of Dominica, was an important naval battle in the Caribbean between the British and the French that took place 9–12 April 1782. The British victory was considered their greatest over the French during the American Revolutionary War.

The British fleet under Admiral Sir George Rodney defeated a French fleet under the Comte de Grasse, forcing the French and Spanish to abandon a planned invasion of Jamaica.

The battle is named after the Îles des Saintes, a group of small islands between Guadeloupe and Dominica in the West Indies. The French had blockaded the British Army at Chesapeake Bay the year before, during the Siege of Yorktown, and supported the eventual American victory in their revolution. This battle, however, halted their momentum and had a significant effect on peace negotiations to end the war.

The French suffered heavy casualties at the Saintes and many were taken prisoner, including de Grasse. Four French ships of the line were captured (including the flagship) and one was destroyed. Rodney was credited with pioneering the tactic of &quot;breaking the line&quot; in the battle, though this is disputed.

==Background==
In October 1781 Admiral Comte de Grasse, commander of the French fleet in the West Indies; Francisco Saavedra de Sangronis, General Bureau for the Spanish Indies; and Bernardo de Gálvez, court representative and aide to the Spanish Governor of Louisiana, developed a plan against British forces. The strategic objectives of the Franco-Spanish military forces in the West Indies in this plan were:
* to aid the Americans and defeat the British naval squadron at New York
* to capture the British Windward Islands and
* to conquer Jamaica.

This plan became known as the &quot;De Grasse–Saavedra Convention.&quot; The first objective had been essentially met by the surrender of the British army under General Cornwallis at the Siege of Yorktown in September 1781. De Grasse and his fleet had played a decisive part in that victory, after which they returned to the Caribbean. On arrival in Saint-Domingue in November 1781, the admiral was notified to proceed with a plan for the conquest of Jamaica.

Jamaica was the largest and most profitable British island in the Caribbean, mainly because of sugar: it was more valuable to the British economy than all of the 13 American colonies. King George III wrote to Lord Sandwich, saying that he would protect Britain&#x27;s important Caribbean islands at the risk of Britain herself, and this was the strategy implemented in 1779. Sugar made up 20% of all British imports and was worth five times as much as tobacco. The French and Spanish were fighting to take over Jamaica in order to expel the British from the West Indies, and to strike a massive blow against the British economy. The courts at Paris and Madrid perceived the invasion of Jamaica as an alternative to the Spanish and French attempts to take Gibraltar, which for two years had been a costly disaster.

Whilst de Grasse waited for reinforcements to undertake the Jamaica campaign, he captured St. Kitts in February 1782. The rest of the Windward Islands—Antigua, St. Lucia, and Barbados—still remained under British control. Admiral George Rodney arrived in the Caribbean theatre the following month, bringing reinforcements. These included 17 ships of the line and gave the British a slight numerical advantage.

On 7 April 1782, de Grasse set out from Martinique with 35 ships of the line, including two 50-gun ships and a large convoy of more than 100 cargo ships, to meet with a Spanish fleet of 12 ships of the line. In addition de Grasse was to rendezvous with 15,000 troops at Saint Domingue, who were earmarked for the conquest and intended to land on Jamaica&#x27;s north coast. Rodney, on learning of this, sailed from St. Lucia in pursuit with 36 ships of the line the following day.

The British ships&#x27; hulls by this time had been given copper sheathing to protect them from marine growth, fouling, and saltwater corrosion, dramatically improving speed and overall sailing performance in good wind.

===Opposing fleets and officers===

The British flagship was HMS &quot;Formidable&quot; under Admiral Rodney. Second in command was Admiral Samuel Hood. and third was Vice Admiral Francis Samuel Drake. As was the convention of the day, the fleet was split into three sections: Rodney had individual control as Admiral of the White of 12 ships flying the White Ensign; Drake had command of 12 ships as Admiral of the Blue flying the Blue Ensign; and Hood was Admiral of the Red with 12 ships flying the Red Ensign.

&quot;Formidable&quot; was accompanied by three 98-gun ships: HMS &quot;Barfleur&quot; (commanded by Hood), HMS &quot;Prince George&quot;, and HMS &quot;Duke&quot;, plus the 90-gun HMS &quot;Namur&quot;. The remaining 31 ships were equipped with 64 to 74 guns. In total the British fleet had 2,620 guns compared to the French total of 2,526. Most of the British fleet was equipped with carronades on the upper decks, which had a major advantage in flexibility and were a great advantage at close quarters.

In March 1782 &quot;Formidable&quot; was stationed at Gros Islet Bay between the island of St. Lucia and Pigeon Island. She was under the command of Admiral Rodney, serving as his flagship at the head of 36 ships of the line. Meanwhile, French Admiral de Grasse headed 34 ships of the line at Fort Royal Bay in Martinique. Rodney had been dispatched from Britain with 12 well-fitted ships to rescue the West Indies from a series of attacks from the French, which had already resulted in the loss of several islands. They joined 24 ships on St. Lucia who had already seen action against the French and were undergoing repairs.

The French had allies in the Spanish, who had 13 ships of the line at Cap‑Français on the island of San Domingo (Hispaniola). Together with transport ships, the Spanish had a considerable force of 24,000 men. They awaited the arrival of a further 10,000 French troops dispatched from Brest, under escort of five men-of-war, to further boost their strength. The plan was for Grasse&#x27;s fleet, with at least 5,000 further troops, to unite with the Spanish at Cap‑Français, and from there to attack and capture the island of Jamaica with their conjoined armada of some 60 ships and 40,000 troops.

Rodney had been in communication with de Grasse during March, organising the exchange of prisoners, who were conveyed by HMS &quot;Alert&quot; under Captain Vashon. The two officers had much mutual respect. Rodney&#x27;s task was to intercept the French fleet en route to Cap‑Français.

Grasse&#x27;s vice admiral at the time was Louis-Philippe de Rigaud, Marquis de Vaudreuil. Third in command was Louis Antoine de Bougainville. The French flagship was the huge 104-gun &quot;Ville de Paris&quot;. The troops were under the command of the Marquis de Bouillé. The French fleet was also split into three squadrons: Grasse led the &quot;Cornette Blanche;&quot; Bougainville led the &quot;Escadre Bleue;&quot; and Vaudreuil as a second-in-command flew the mixed white and blue colours of the &quot;Blanche et Bleue.&quot;

Other British commanders included Captain Lord Robert Manners of HMS &quot;Resolution&quot;, Admiral William Cornwallis in command of HMS &quot;Canada&quot;, and HMS &quot;Monarch&quot; under the command of Captain Francis Reynolds. Other aristocrats present included Captain Lord Cranstoun, a supernumerary onboard &quot;Formidable&quot;. Sir Charles Douglas, a nephew of Charles Douglas, 3rd Duke of Queensberry, was Captain of the Fleet. Sir James Wallace was also present. Other commanders included Captains Blair, Buckner, Burnett, Charrington, Cornish, Dumaresq, Graves, Inglefield, Inglis, Knight, Parry, Saumarez, Savage, Symons, Truscott, Wilkinson, Williams, and Wilson. Frederick Thesiger, Acting Lieutenant on board &quot;Formidable&quot;, was appointed as Rodney&#x27;s aide-de-camp shortly before the battle.

A lookout squadron, a line of frigates headed by Captain George Anson Byron on HMS &quot;Andromache&quot;, reported all of de Grasse&#x27;s movements at Fort Royal. This squadron included the speedy HMS &quot;Agamemnon&quot; and also HMS &quot;Magnificent&quot;.

===Pre-battle movements===
On 3 April it was signalled that the repairs on the French fleet were complete. On 5 April it was reported that the French troops were boarding the ships. At 8:00 am on Sunday 8 April, it was reported that the French fleet were leaving Fort Royal. Rodney&#x27;s fleet called all men to join their ships and they began leaving Gros Islet Bay at 10:30 am.

The total French armada comprised 35 ships of the line, 10 frigates, and over 100 smaller ships. The smaller ships moved in advance of the men-of-war, heading for St. Pierre.

Just past 4:00 pm Hood&#x27;s &quot;Barfleur&quot;, at the head of the British fleet, espied five sails ahead that she presumed to be part of the French fleet. These came into view of &quot;Formidable&quot; around two hours later, just before sunset. They pursued the French through the night. At 2:00 am on 9 April, HMS &quot;St Albans&quot; dropped alongside &quot;Formidable&quot;, reporting that along with HMS &quot;Valiant&quot;, she had located the French fleet in the darkness. Rodney rested for the remainder of the night.

The sun rose at 5:30 am. The French fleet extended from six to 12 miles distant, navigating the waters between Dominica and Guadeloupe. The majority of the warships lay off Prince Rupert&#x27;s Bay.

Due to a dead calm from 3:00 until 7:00 am, neither fleet could move. The initial wind only reached &quot;Barfleur&quot; and its eight support ships, causing them to detach ahead of the main fleet, which lay in the lee of Dominica. De Grasse saw the opportunity to cripple this advanced section and wheeled to begin the first attack.

== Battle ==
On 9 April 1782 the copper-sheathed British fleet caught up with the French, who were surprised by their speed. Admiral de Grasse ordered the French convoy to head into Guadeloupe for repair, forcing him to escort two 50-gun ships (&quot;Fier&quot; and &quot;Experiment&quot;), and placing his fleet in line of battle in order to cover the retreat.

===First encounters===

Hood&#x27;s section of the fleet, headed by &quot;Barfleur&quot;, braced for the first attack. As the first action, HMS &quot;Alfred&quot; taunted the 18 approaching French ships under de Vaudreuil by exposing her broadside to the approaching French, but without consequence. The British patiently awaited the formal signal from Rodney on &quot;Formidable&quot;, some six miles behind, and eventually received a red flag signal telling them to &quot;engage the enemy.&quot; As the wind rose around noon, it enabled most of the French fleet and part of the British fleet (including Rodney in &quot;Formidable&quot;) to join the melee. At this point the French outnumbered the British two to one. Captain William Bayne on &quot;Alfred&quot; was killed during this action.

After an inconclusive encounter during which both sides suffered damage, de Grasse realised that the remainder of the British fleet would soon be upon them and broke off the engagement to withdraw a safe distance. De Grasse moved his ships to the Saintes Islands to the north (south of Guadeloupe). Meanwhile, Rodney reversed the order of his line to bring Drake&#x27;s hitherto undamaged ships to the front, and allow Hood to undertake repairs in the rear lines.

On 10 April the French began 10 miles distant but did not turn to engage, instead continuing on their original course, and by nightfall had increased their separation to 15 miles. This appears to be partly due to the incorrect presumption on Rodney&#x27;s part that the French were going to turn to engage.

On Wednesday 11 April two French ships, and &quot;Magnanime&quot;, who had accidentally collided and fallen behind the main French fleet, came into view around noon. Rodney decided that attacking these two ships would cause de Grasse to return to protect them, which worked: a large section of the French fleet turned to protect the pair. These movements were executed without any physical attacks.

===Main engagement===
On 12 April the French were ranged from six to 12 miles distant and were not in formation, as the two fleets manoeuvred between the northern end of Dominica and the Saintes in the Saintes Passage. The unfortunate &quot;Zélé&quot; had had a second collision during the night with one of its rescuers, &quot;Ville de Paris&quot;, and was now being towed to Basse-Terre in Guadeloupe by &quot;Astrée&quot; with General de Bouillé on board. They were chased by four British ships: &quot;Monarch&quot;, &quot;Valiant&quot;, HMS &quot;Centaur&quot; and HMS &quot;Belliqueux&quot;. De Grasse made for Guadeloupe and bore up with his fleet to protect the ship. At the same time, Rodney recalled his chasing ships and made the signal for line of battle.

Rear Admiral Hood&#x27;s van division were still making repairs from the action three days earlier, so he directed his rear division, under Rear Admiral Drake, to take the lead. At 7:40, under Captain Taylor Penny led the British line and opened battle when she approached the centre of the French line. Having remained parallel with the French, the ships of Drake&#x27;s division passed the remaining length of de Grasse&#x27;s line and the two sides exchanged broadsides, a typical naval engagement of the time.

==== Initial attack ====

&quot;Marlborough&quot; headed the British attack. As the battle progressed, the strong winds of the previous day and night began to temper and became more variable. As the French line passed down the British line, the sudden shift of wind let Rodney&#x27;s flagship &quot;Formidable&quot; and several other ships, including &quot;Duke&quot; and , sail toward the French line.

At 8:00 am &quot;Formidable&quot; raised the red flag to permit &quot;Marlborough&quot; to open fire and engage the French. At this point &quot;Marlborough&quot; was opposite &quot;Dauphin Royal&quot;, who received her full broadside. Sixteen ships in line separated &quot;Marlborough&quot; from &quot;Formidable&quot; and each stood 200 metres apart. As each circled past the French, they fired a broadside against them. Second, behind &quot;Marlborough&quot;, was HMS &quot;Arrogant&quot;, who had been recently re-equipped and managed three broadsides against one from the French as they passed. Third in line was HMS &quot;Alcide&quot; under Captain Charles Thomson. Then followed HMS &quot;Nonsuch&quot; under Captain Truscott, and then HMS &quot;Conqueror&quot; under Captain George Balfour.

Next in line was Admiral Drake on HMS &quot;Princessa&quot;, who was in command of the first 12 vessels, and was followed by &quot;Prince George&quot; under Captain Williams. Then came the 100-year-old HMS &quot;Torbay&quot; under Captain Keppel and the year-old HMS &quot;Anson&quot; under Captain William Blair on the main deck, who was struck by round shot at waist level and sliced in two. The blue squadron was then completed by HMS &quot;Fame&quot; and HMS &quot;Russell&quot; under Captain James Saumarez.

The white squadron under Rodney followed in exact formation after the blue. This was headed by HMS &quot;America&quot; under Captain Thompson. HMS &quot;Hercules&quot; under Captain Henry Savage followed. Then came HMS &quot;Prothee&quot; under Captain Buckner and &quot;Resolution&quot; under Captain Robert Manners. The 24-year-old Manners was the first casualty on his ship and was severely injured in both legs and right arm, dying later of these wounds. &quot;Resolution&quot; was followed by &quot;Duke&quot; under Captain Alan Gardner.

As &quot;Formidable&quot; was in the centre of the British line, it took her almost an hour to reach the centre of the action. All ships had to maintain a steady speed, and as she passed de Grasse&#x27;s flagship, the 104-gun &quot;Ville de Paris&quot;, the two met for the first time. &quot;Ville de Paris&quot; was already damaged by the 15 ships ahead of &quot;Formidable&quot; in the line. Although it was a sunny day, the smoke of the battle was like a dense fog. &quot;Formidable&quot; entered the smoke and approached &quot;Ville de Paris&quot; at 8:40 am.

The countermovement of the fleets brought a series of ships opposite &quot;Formidable&quot; in sequence behind &quot;Ville de Paris&quot;, movements that brought about a different pairing of enemies every five minutes. Next was &quot;Couronne&quot;, followed by &quot;Éveillé&quot; under Le Gardeur de Tilly, and then &quot;Sceptre&quot; under the command of de Vaudreuil.

====Breaking the line====

Within an hour, the wind had shifted to the south, forcing the French line to separate and bear to the west, as it could not hold its course into the wind. This allowed the British to use guns on both sides of their ships without fear of return fire from the front and rear of the French ships, between which they were passing. The effect was greater using the carronades, with which the British had just equipped nearly half their fleet. This relatively new short-range weapon was quicker to reload and more of them could be carried. , under command of Captain des Cars, moving in the wake of &quot;Ville de Paris&quot;, was the next victim. Virtually a sitting duck due to damage in the previous 10 minutes from &quot;Duke&quot;, she was quickly pounded and dismasted by intense fire.

In the confusion four French ships beginning with &quot;Diadem&quot; broke out of sequence, partly due to the uncontrollable speed of the mastless &quot;Glorieux&quot;. &quot;Formidable&quot; turned to starboard and brought her port guns to bear on them. As a result, &quot;Formidable&quot; sailed through the gap, breaking the French line. This breach was further followed through by five other British ships. The breach was later recorded by Charles Dashwood, who was a midshipman on &quot;Formidable&quot; on that day.

Although the concept of &quot;breaking the line&quot; was born here, it is logically of mixed blessings, since in breaking the enemy line, one breaks one&#x27;s own line. Whilst the movement has the advantage that guns can be fired on both port and starboard sides, it also exposes the ship to attack on both sides. The advantage in this instance was that many of the French gunners left their post, in fear of &quot;Formidable&quot;&#x27;s three tiers of guns bearing down on them.

&quot;Diadem&quot; appears to have fully withdrawn from the battle at this stage, and many presumed her to be sunk. &quot;Formidable&quot; was followed by &quot;Namur&quot; under Captain Fanshawe and then &quot;St Albans&quot; under Captain Inglis. These were followed by the deadly &quot;Canada&quot; under Captain William Cornwallis, HMS &quot;Repulse&quot; under Captain Thomas Dumaresq, and HMS &quot;Ajax&quot; under Captain Nicholas Charrington. Each of these fired further upon the hapless and already crippled &quot;Glorieux&quot;.
Simultaneously, and because of the smoke, Commodore Edmund Affleck on &quot;Bedford&quot;, the hindmost ship of the central white squadron, accidentally sailed through the confused French line, between &quot;César&quot; and &quot;Hector&quot;, only to discover this error when no enemy lay on his starboard side in the clearing smoke.

&quot;Bedford&quot; was followed by Hood&#x27;s red squadron and this broke the French line into three sections. In the confusion the two leading ships of the rear red squadron, HMS &quot;Prince William&quot; and &quot;Magnificent&quot;, had somehow passed &quot;Bedford&quot;, who was now third in line within the red squadron and completely detached from her own white squadron. The whole red squadron then passed between &quot;César&quot; and &quot;Hector&quot;, causing each to be crippled. The final ship of the red squadron, HMS &quot;Royal Oak&quot;, passed the stern of &quot;César&quot; and delivered a final blow a few minutes after 11:00 am. Both fleets then drifted apart for some time and became temporarily becalmed.

Around noon, both fleets observed that the waters were teeming with sharks attracted by the noise and blood. French casualties were greatly increased due to the high number of troops packed onto the lower decks: a minimum of 900 per ship and no fewer than 1,300 on &quot;Ville de Paris&quot;. In order to lessen the confusion, the French had been throwing the dead (and perhaps the near-dead) overboard, a rich feast for the sharks.

===French retreat===
The French now lay totally to the leeward of the British fleet, which stood between them and their destination. They had little option on the re-emergence of the wind but to sail west with it and attempt escape. At 1:00 pm the frigate &quot;Richemont&quot;, under the command of Captain De Mortemart, but with Denis Decrès in charge of the marines, was sent to join a towing cable to the heavily crippled &quot;Glorieux&quot;. &quot;Souverain&quot; moved alongside to provide covering fire. However, the British, with both wind and cannon-power in their favour, moved a number of ships up to block this movement.

The captain of &quot;Glorieux&quot; was already dead, and the ship was now under command of the senior officer remaining, Lieutenant Trogoff de Kerlessi. &quot;Souverain&quot; and &quot;Richmond&quot; retreated under heavy fire, and Kerlessi had little choice but to tear the flag from the mast and surrender, which was done to &quot;Royal Oak&quot;. Captain Burnett used this opportunity to restock his depleted powder supplies. Meanwhile, &quot;Monarch&quot; stood alongside &quot;Andromache&quot;, who was acting as a supply ship to the British fleet; 40 barrels of powder were exchanged.

In the next action, around 1:30 pm, &quot;Centaur&quot; and &quot;Bedford&quot; attacked the stricken &quot;César&quot;, captained by Bernard de Marigny, who refused to surrender and was seriously wounded in the first five minutes. Command then fell to his Captain Paul.
With their formation shattered and many of their ships severely damaged, the French fell away to the southwest in small groups. Rodney attempted to redeploy and make repairs before pursuing the French. By 2:00 pm the wind had freshened and a general chase ensued. As the British pressed south, &quot;Ardent&quot; was flanked by HMS Belliqueux and HMS Prince William and soon surrendered. They then took possession of Glorieux and caught up with the French rear at around 3pm. Admiral de Grasse signalled other ships to protect &quot;Ville de Paris&quot;, but this was only partially fulfilled. Nine ships from de Vaudreuil&#x27;s squadron came to his aid.

The British fleet bore down on this small group. In succession Rodney&#x27;s ships isolated the other three ships. &quot;César&quot;, which was soon totally dismasted and in flames, was captured by &quot;Centaur&quot;. Soon after 5:00 pm, &quot;Hector&quot;, having been flanked by &quot;Canada&quot; and &quot;Alcide&quot;, soon became a completely dismasted wreck. Following the mortal wounding of his captain, De la Vicomte, his first lieutenant De Beaumanoir, lowered the ship&#x27;s flag and surrendered to &quot;Alcide&quot;.

Bougainville, who commanded , had ordered eight ships of his own division to aid &quot;Ville de Paris&quot;, but only &quot;Ardent&quot; had proceeded. Her isolation caused her to be flanked by &quot;Belliqueux&quot; and &quot;Prince William&quot;, soon leading to her capture.

At 5:30 pm de Grasse&#x27;s &quot;Ville de Paris&quot; stood practically alone and had &quot;Barfleur&quot; in close pursuit, with &quot;Formidable&quot; close behind. Five ships from de Vaudreuil&#x27;s squadron were trying to protect her, but none in close formation. These were &quot;Triomphant&quot; (de Vaudreuil&#x27;s flagship), &quot;Bourgogne&quot; (under De La Charette), &quot;Magnifique&quot; (Macarty Macteigue), &quot;Pluton&quot; (De Rions), and &quot;Marseillais&quot; (De Castellane-Majastre). Three ships from de Grasse&#x27;s squadron also still remained: &quot;Languedoc&quot;, &quot;Couronne&quot; and &quot;Sceptre&quot;.

De Grasse&#x27;s closest protector, &quot;Couronne&quot;, moved away at the approach of &quot;Canada&quot;, who began the final attack on &quot;Ville de Paris&quot;. With little support and suffering huge losses in men, de Grasse made another attempt to signal the fleet and gave the order &quot;to build the line on the starboard tack,&quot; but again this was not done. By this time, most of the French fleet, apart from those ships that were surrounded, had retreated.

===End of the battle===
&quot;Canada&quot; swept past &quot;Ville de Paris&quot;, doing damage to the spars and slowing her further. HMS &quot;Russell&quot; under Captain Saumarez then moved diagonally along the stern of the flagship and fired a broadside that ripped the entire length of the ship. &quot;Russell&quot; then moved to the leeward side to hamper the ship&#x27;s retreat, whilst &quot;Barfleur&quot; moved onto the opposite side. &quot;Languedoc&quot; attempted to approach and give aid but was beaten back by &quot;Duke&quot;.

&quot;Ville de Paris&quot; was in desperate condition, with all masts damaged, the rudder shot away, and at least 300 men dead or injured in the cockpit. Around 6:00 pm, overwhelmed and suffering terrible losses, &quot;Ville de Paris&quot; eventually struck her colours, signaling surrender. Hood approached on &quot;Barfleur&quot;, which de Grasse had indicated was his preferred method of surrender, to receive the French surrender.

The boarding crew, which included the British fleet surgeon Gilbert Blane, were horrified at the carnage. Admiral de Grasse appeared not to have a scratch on him, whilst every one of his officers had either been killed or wounded; only three men were unwounded. Rodney boarded soon after, and Hood presented de Grasse to him. With his surrender, the battle had effectively ended, except for a few long-range desultory shots and the retreat of many of the French ships in disorder. The gallantry of William Cornwallis of &quot;Canada&quot; (younger brother of Charles Cornwallis) gained the admiration of the whole fleet. One officer noted that he was &quot;like Hector, as if emulous to revenge his brothers cause.&quot;

The Marquis de Vaudreuil, seeing de Grasse&#x27;s fate through his telescope, took command of the remaining scattered French naval fleet. On 13 April he had 10 ships with him and sailed toward Cap-Français. Rodney signaled his fleet not to pursue the remaining ships. The battle was thus over.

Later that night around 9:00 pm, fire broke out on &quot;César&quot;, begun by the entrapped French crew on the lower decks, who had broken into the liquor stores. By 10:30 pm the fire was out of control and the magazine exploded, killing more than 400 French and 58 British sailors, plus the lieutenant in charge, all from &quot;Centaur&quot;. Many men jumped overboard trying to avoid the conflagration, only to fall victim to the sharks below. Captain Marigny, who had been confined to his cabin, was one of the many killed, and none of the British prize crew survived.

===Casualties===
The British lost 243 killed and 816 wounded, and two captains out of 36 were killed, whilst no ships were lost. The highest casualties were on &quot;Duke&quot;, with 73 killed or wounded, including the death of Lieutenant Rowland de Cerjat. The total French casualties have never been stated, but six captains out of 30 were killed. In terms of soldiers and sailors, estimates range from 3,000 killed or wounded and 5,000 captured, to as many as around 3,000 dead, 6,000 wounded, and 6,000 captured. In addition to several French ships captured, others were severely damaged. The high number of casualties demonstrates the considerable force the French committed to achieve the invasion of Jamaica. Of &quot;Ville de Paris&quot;″s crew alone, over 400 were killed and more than 700 were wounded—more than the casualties of the entire British fleet. De Grasse—the first French admiral in history to be captured by an enemy—was sent to England, where he was paroled.

==Aftermath==

Rodney&#x27;s failure to follow up the victory by a pursuit was criticised. Samuel Hood said that the 20 French ships would have been captured had Rodney maintained the chase. In 1899 the Navy Records Society published the &quot;Dispatches and Letters Relating to the Blockading of Brest&quot;. In the introduction, they include a small biography of William Cornwallis. A poem purportedly written by him includes the lines:
On 17 April Hood was sent in pursuit of the French, and promptly captured two 64-gun ships of the line (&quot;Jason&quot; and ) and two smaller warships in the Battle of the Mona Passage on 19 April. Following this victory, Hood rendezvoused with Rodney at Port Royal on 29 April. As a result of the damage the fleet had sustained in battle, repairs took nine weeks.

Soon after the defeat, the French fleet reached Cap-François in several waves. The main contingent, under de Vaudreuil, arrived on 25 April. &quot;Marseillais&quot;, along with &quot;Hercule&quot;, and &quot;Éveillé&quot;, arrived on 11 May. In May all 26 French ships from the battle arrived from Martinique and were soon joined by 12 Spanish ships. Disease struck the French forces, in particular the soldiers, of whom thousands died. The allies&#x27; hesitation and indecision soon led them to abandon plans to attack Jamaica. Instead the French and Spanish focused on protecting their own territories. Jamaica remained a British colony, as indeed did Barbados and Antigua.

Disaster struck the British months after the battle when Admiral Graves was leading a fleet back to England that included the French prizes from the battle. The fleet encountered the 1782 Central Atlantic hurricane in September, which hit off Newfoundland. &quot;Glorieux&quot;, &quot;Hector&quot; and &quot;Ville de Paris&quot;, along with other ships, foundered or sank with heavy loss of life.

===Reactions===
News of the battle reached France in June and was met with despair. The defeat along with the loss of &quot;Ville de Paris&quot; was a devastating blow to French king Louis XVI. The navy minister, the Marquis de Castries, greeted the news as &quot;a grim disaster&quot;. The Comte de Vergennes felt undermined in the confidence of the French navy. All blame lay on the Comte de Grasse, whilst he himself sought long to clear his name. He blamed his subordinates de Vaudreuil and Bougainville for the defeat, but an infuriated Louis bluntly told de Grasse to retire.

The battle had repercussions for France&#x27;s finances: the monetary loss was huge. On &quot; Ville de Paris&quot; alone, 36 chests of money worth at least £500,000 were found, this being payment for the troops. During the first four years of the war, the French navy had lost four ships of the line (three of them to accidents), whereas during 1782 it would lose 15 ships of the line, nearly half of these in April alone. The losses of these ships were significant. Nevertheless, Louis promised to build more ships after new taxes were levied. The French finance minister, Jean-François Joly de Fleury, successfully secured the addition of a Vingtième income tax, the third and last one of its kind in the ancien régime.

There was widespread celebration in Britain upon news of the victory. In the newspaper &quot;Cumberland Pacquet&quot; it was noted, &quot;A joy unknown for years past seemed to spread itself amongst all ranks of people.&quot; On his return Rodney was fêted as a hero, and a number of cartoons and caricatures were created to commemorate the victory. He presented the Comte de Grasse personally to King George III as a prisoner, and was created a peer with £2,000 a year settled on the title in perpetuity. A number of paintings were commissioned to celebrate his victory, notably by Thomas Gainsborough and Joshua Reynolds. Hood was also elevated to the peerage, whilst Drake and Affleck were made baronets.

===Impact on peace negotiations===

Following the Franco-American victory at Yorktown six months earlier and the change of Government in England, peace negotiations in Paris had begun among Britain, the American colonies, France, and Spain in early 1782. The battle had a significant effect on those talks when news arrived of its outcome in June. The result of the Battle of the Saintes transferred the strategic initiative to the British, whose dominance at sea was reasserted. News of the defeat reached the Americans, who soon realised they were unlikely to have much French support in the future. American General Nathanael Greene had high hopes of French assistance in the recapture of Charleston, but the defeat led to its abandonment.

No longer humbled, the British stiffened their resolve: they objected to American claims on the Newfoundland fisheries and Canada. As a result, the American negotiators led by John Jay became more amenable. Not only did they drop their minimum demands and insist on the single precondition of recognition of their independence, they also put forward America&#x27;s abandonment of its commitment to make no separate peace treaty without the French. The victory at the Saintes thus signaled a collapse in the Franco-American alliance. Despite this the battle did not affect the overall outcome of the American Revolution.

De Castries urged Spain to join the French to send another armada against the British West Indies. On the theory of this victory, it would win bargaining power to force Britain&#x27;s acceptance of American independence. Vergennes, however, was desperate for peace, and time was running out: France was approaching the limits of its ability to borrow money. France had also promised not to make peace with England until Spain had achieved its principal goal of conquering Gibraltar. By October this attempt had been defeated: a huge Spanish attempt in September was repelled with heavy losses, following which Richard Howe, with a large naval convoy, then relieved the garrison. As a result, Vergennes demanded that Spain give up its claim on Gibraltar to make peace, to which the latter acquiesced.

The Comte de Grasse, who was a high-profile prisoner in Britain, was used to exchange messages of peace between Great Britain and France. A preliminary peace treaty between Great Britain and the United States was signed on 30 November 1782. Thus, with the Americans split from their allies, peace was signed with France and Spain in January 1783. Initial articles of peace were signed in July, following by a full treaty in September 1783. Owing to their military successes in 1782, the peace treaties that brought the war to an end were less disadvantageous for Britain than had been anticipated.

===Impact on naval tactics===
Superior British seamanship and gunnery ruled the day in what is considered the greatest naval victory for the British over the French during the American Revolutionary War.

The battle is famous for the innovative British tactic of &quot;breaking the line,&quot; in which the British ships passed through a gap in the French line, engaging the enemy from leeward and throwing them into disorder. Historians disagree about whether the tactic was intentional or made possible by weather. If intentional, who should receive credit is ambiguous: Rodney, his Scottish Captain-of-the-Fleet and aide-de-camp, Sir Charles Douglas, or John Clerk of Eldin.

As a result of the battle, British naval tactics changed. The old method had involved the attacking fleet spreading itself along the entire enemy line. In the five formal fleet actions involving the Royal Navy between the Battle of the Saintes and the Battle of Trafalgar, all were victories for the British and achieved by the creation of localised numerical superiority.

==Monuments==
A huge ornate monument to the three captains lost in the battle—William Blair, William Bayne and Robert Manners—was erected to their memory in Westminster Abbey. The marble monument by Joseph Nollekens was completed in 1793. It consists of a figure of Fame standing on a column which has relief portraits of the captains attached, above figures of Britannia and a lion opposite figures of Neptune and a sea horse.

A monument in Spanish Town, Jamaica, was created to honour Admiral Rodney&#x27;s role in the battle. It was created by the sculptor John Bacon in 1801. Two of the &quot;Ville de Paris&quot; guns flank Rodney&#x27;s statue.
== Order of battle ==

=== Britain ===
=== France ===
Not in line: Frigates &quot;Richemont&quot; (Mortemart); &quot;Amazone&quot; (Ensign Bourgarel de Martignan, acting captain replacing Montguyot); &quot;Aimable&quot; (Lieutenant de Suzannet); &quot;Galathée&quot; (Lieutenant de Roquart); corvette &quot;Cérès&quot; (Lieutenant de Paroy); and cutter &quot;Clairvoyant&quot; (Ensign de Daché); cutter &quot;Pandour&quot; (Grasse-Limermont).

==In popular culture==
The battle is the subject of the title track on &quot;No Grave But the Sea,&quot; the 2017 album by the Scottish &quot;pirate metal&quot; band Alestorm. The lyrics mention de Grasse, the British ships &quot;Duke&quot; and &quot;Bedford&quot;, and the tactic of &quot;breaking the line.&quot;

The battle was the climax of the first written Richard Bolitho novel by Alexander Kent.

The battle is featured in &quot;Le Dernier Panache&quot;, a show in the Puy du Fou, wherein the show&#x27;s main character, François de Charette, fights in the Battle of the Saintes. In the show and in reality he fought the battle as a lieutenant de vaisseau.

In the verse epic &quot;Omeros&quot; by Nobel-prize-winning poet Derek Walcott, which is set largely on St. Lucia, the retired British officer Major Plunkett is researching the battle. Two chapters tell the story of his namesake Midshipman Plunkett, who dies in the battle.

<doc id="365598" wikidata="Q3675340" url="?curid=365598" title="Charlotte Whitton">
<text>Charlotte Elizabeth Whitton (March 8, 1896 – January 25, 1975) was a Canadian feminist and mayor of Ottawa. She was the first woman mayor of a major city in Canada, serving from 1951 to 1956 and again from 1960 to 1964. Whitton was a Canadian social policy pioneer, leader and commentator, as well as a journalist and writer.

==Early life and education==
Charlotte Elizabeth Hazeltyne Whitton was born in Renfrew, Ontario, a small Ottawa Valley town about 100 km northwest of Ottawa.

She attended Queen&#x27;s University where she was the star of the women&#x27;s hockey team and was known as the fastest skater in the league. In 1917, the year she earned a Master of Arts degree, she became the first female editor editor of the &quot;Queen&#x27;s Journal&quot; newspaper.

==Career and accomplishments==
Upon graduating from Queen&#x27;s, she became a civil servant as the private secretary for Thomas Low, MP and Minister of Trade in Liberal Prime Minister William Lyon Mackenzie King&#x27;s first government.

When Low lost his parliamentary seat, Whitton then focused on her role as founding director (1922) of the Canadian Council on Child Welfare, and worked there until 1941. It became the Canadian Welfare Council, now the Canadian Council on Social Development, and helped bring about a wide array of new legislation to help children and immigrants.

In 1934, Whitton was named a Commander of the Order of the British Empire at the 1934 New Year Honours.

She served on the League of Nations Social Questions Committee.

Whitton was awarded an honorary Doctorate of Laws by Queen&#x27;s in 1941.

She published two books in 1943.

Despite her strong views on women&#x27;s equality, Whitton was a strong social conservative, and did not support making divorce easier. She was a regular columnist in Ottawa&#x27;s daily newspapers.

==Political career==
Whitton was elected to Ottawa&#x27;s Board of Control in 1950, leading the city-wide polls, and started her term on January 1, 1951.

Upon the unexpected death of mayor Grenville Goodwin in August of the same year, only some eight months into his term, Whitton was immediately appointed acting mayor, and on 30 September 1951 was confirmed by city council to remain mayor until the end of the normal three-year term.

Whitton is sometimes mistakenly credited as the first woman &quot;ever&quot; to serve as a mayor in Canada, but this distinction is in fact held by Barbara Hanley, who became mayor of the small Northern Ontario town of Webbwood in 1936. Whitton is the first woman to serve as mayor of a large Canadian city.

Whitton was elected Ottawa mayor in the general municipal election in her own right in 1953, serving until 1956. She turned it into a full-time job.

She ran again for mayor of Ottawa in 1960, and was elected, serving until 1964, when she was defeated on her try for re-election.

===Opposes new flag===
Whitton was a staunch defender of Canada&#x27;s traditions, and, as Ottawa mayor, condemned Prime Minister Lester B. Pearson&#x27;s proposal in 1964 for new national flag to replace the traditional Canadian Red Ensign. Whitton dismissed Pearson&#x27;s design as a &#x27;white badge of surrender, waving three dying maple leaves&#x27; which might as well be &#x27;three white feathers on a red background,&#x27; a symbol of cowardice. &#x27;It is a poor observance of our first century as a nation if we run up a flag of surrender with three dying maple leaves on it,&#x27; she said. For Whitton, the Red Ensign, with its Union Jack and coat of arms containing symbols of England, Scotland, Ireland and France (or a similar flag with traditional symbols on it) would be a stronger embodiment of the Canadian achievement in peace and war.

She became well-known for her assertiveness, and for her vicious wit with which many male colleagues, and once the Lord Mayor of London, were attacked. She is noted for the quotation: &quot;Whatever women do they must do twice as well as men to be thought half as good. Luckily, this is not difficult.&quot;

On October 23, 1955, while mayor, Whitton appeared on the Sunday evening American game show &quot;What&#x27;s My Line&quot;.

In the 1958 federal election, Whitton made her only attempt to run for Parliament, in the riding of Ottawa West, as the Progressive Conservative nominee. Prime Minister John Diefenbaker and Ontario Premier Leslie Frost campaigned for her. However, she lost to Liberal Party incumbent George McIlraith by 1,425 votes. McIlraith held the riding from 1940 to 1968, and Whitton&#x27;s challenge was the closest he faced during that period.

Whitton was made an Officer of the Order of Canada in 1967.

She ran for the position of city alderwoman (councillor) in 1967, and was elected, serving until 1972.

==Accusations of racism==
Whitton had many remarkable achievements, but her story is framed by current controversy over some of her actions.

She has been accused in print of espousing, &quot;a &#x27;scientific&#x27; racism that viewed groups such as Jews and Armenians as &#x27;undesirable&#x27; immigrants.&quot; (&quot;Open Your Hearts: The Story of the Jewish War Orphans in Canada&quot; by Fraidie Martz)

In 1938, she attended a conference in Ottawa to launch the Canadian National Committee on Refugees (CNCR). She showed opposition to some of the other attendees&#x27; arguments. A common belief is that she was directly opposed to Jews and in particular Jewish children. Oscar Cohen of the Canadian Jewish Congress is reported to have said she &quot;almost broke up the inaugural meeting of the congress on refugees by her insistent opposition and very apparent anti-Semitism.&quot; This sentiment is countered by the official record, which includes notes from her presentation, including &quot;lobby the government to initiate a long-term refugee program ...&quot; and an interest in protecting all at risk, &quot;particularly Hebrews in the Reich and in Italy.&quot;

According to the Canadian Jewish Congress: &quot;Certainly in the course of the Second World War and the Holocaust, she was instrumental in keeping Jewish orphans out of Canada because of her belief that Jews would not make good immigrants and were basically inferior.&quot;

As Mayor in 1964, she declined Bertram Loeb&#x27;s $500,000 donation to the City&#x27;s Ottawa Civic Hospital. The official rationale was that the city could not afford to keep the centre operating. The sentiment exists that she &quot;simply didn&#x27;t want the name of a Jewish family on an Ottawa hospital building.&quot;.

According to Patricia Rooke (co-author of a 1987 biography of Whitton), Whitton was a &quot;complete anglophile&quot; who opposed all non-British immigration to Canada. &quot;Charlotte Whitton was a racist,&quot; according to Rooke. &quot;Her anti-Semitism, I think, was the least of it. She was quite racist about the Ukrainians, for example. She really didn&#x27;t like the changing character of Canadian society.&quot;

In opposition to the anti-Semite argument, Whitton was well received by various Jewish organizations in her lifetime, including &quot;B&#x27;nai B&#x27;rith&quot; and various Jewish-centred publications. She was also a supporter of—and the first to sign the nomination papers of—the first Jewish Mayor of Ottawa, Lorry Greenberg, who served as Ottawa mayor from 1975–1978.

In 2011 Whitton&#x27;s name was kept off a new Archives Building in Ottawa due to this controversy.

==Personal life==
Whitton never married, but lived for years in a Boston marriage living arrangement with Margaret Grier (1892 – December 9, 1947). Her relationship with Grier was not widespread public knowledge until 1999, 24 years after Whitton&#x27;s death, when the National Archives of Canada publicly released the last of her personal papers, including many intimate personal letters between Whitton and Grier. The release of these papers sparked much debate in the Canadian media about whether the relationship between Whitton and Grier could be characterized as lesbian, or merely as an emotionally intimate friendship between two unmarried women, with the debate hinging in part on the question of whether or not it was necessary to prove that Whitton and Grier had ever had sexual intercourse with each other. 

However, Whitton never publicly identified as lesbian during her political career, and Grier died before Whitton was elected as mayor, so Whitton could not be credited as Canada&#x27;s first out LGBT mayor regardless of the nature of her relationship with Grier.

Grier died in 1947 and she is buried at Thompson Hill Cemetery, Thompson Hill, Horton, Ontario, Canada. In 1975 Whitton was buried alongside her.

==Portrayals==
Whitton&#x27;s relationship with Grier was dramatized in a 2008 play called &quot;Molly&#x27;s Veil&quot; written by Canadian playwright and actor Sharon Bajer. Bajer was inspired to write the play after reading letters written between Whitton and Grier, and used these as the basis for the play. The play explores Whitton&#x27;s relationship with her partner Grier, portraying Whitton as a loving partner in a lesbian relationship and deals with the tension between Whitton&#x27;s private life and her public one.

<text>Thaddeus Stevens (April 4, 1792August 11, 1868) was an American politician and lawyer who served as a member of the United States House of Representatives from Pennsylvania, being one of the leaders of the Radical Republican faction of the Republican Party during the 1860s. A fierce opponent of slavery and discrimination against black Americans, Stevens sought to secure their rights during Reconstruction, leading the opposition to U.S. President Andrew Johnson. As chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee during the American Civil War, he played a leading role, focusing his attention on defeating the Confederacy, financing the war with new taxes and borrowing, crushing the power of slave owners, ending slavery, and securing equal rights for the freedmen.

Stevens was born in rural Vermont, in poverty, and with a club foot, which left him with a permanent limp. He moved to Pennsylvania as a young man and quickly became a successful lawyer in Gettysburg. He interested himself in municipal affairs and then in politics. He was an active leader of the Anti-Masonic Party, as a fervent believer that Freemasonry in the United States was an evil conspiracy to secretly control the republican system of government. He was elected to the Pennsylvania House of Representatives, where he became a strong advocate of free public education. Financial setbacks in 1842 caused him to move his home and practice to the larger city of Lancaster. There, he joined the Whig Party and was elected to Congress in 1848. His activities as a lawyer and politician in opposition to slavery cost him votes, and he did not seek reelection in 1852. After a brief flirtation with the Know-Nothing Party, Stevens joined the newly formed Republican Party and was elected to Congress again in 1858. There, with fellow radicals such as Massachusetts Senator Charles Sumner, he opposed the expansion of slavery and concessions to the South as the war came.

Stevens argued that slavery should not survive the war; he was frustrated by the slowness of U.S. President Abraham Lincoln to support his position. He guided the government&#x27;s financial legislation through the House as Ways and Means chairman. As the war progressed towards a Northern victory, Stevens came to believe that not only should slavery be abolished, but that black Americans should be given a stake in the South&#x27;s future through the confiscation of land from planters to be distributed to the freedmen. His plans went too far for the Moderate Republicans and were not enacted.

After the assassination of Abraham Lincoln in April 1865, Stevens came into conflict with the new president, Johnson, who sought rapid restoration of the seceded states without guarantees for freedmen. The difference in views caused an ongoing battle between Johnson and Congress, with Stevens leading the Radical Republicans. After gains in the 1866 election, the radicals took control of Reconstruction away from Johnson. Stevens&#x27;s last great battle was to secure in the House articles of impeachment against Johnson, acting as a House manager in the impeachment trial, though the Senate did not convict the President.

Historiographical views of Stevens have dramatically shifted over the years, from the early 20th-century view of Stevens as reckless and motivated by hatred of the white South to the perspective of the neoabolitionists of the 1950s and afterward, who lauded him for his commitment to equality.

==Early life and education==

Stevens was born in Danville, Vermont, on April 4, 1792. He was the second of four children, all boys, and was named to honor the Polish general who served in the American Revolutionary War, Tadeusz &quot;Thaddeus&quot; Kościuszko. His parents were Baptists who had emigrated from Massachusetts around 1786. Thaddeus was born with a club foot which, at the time, was seen by some as a judgment from God for secret parental sin. His older brother was born with the same condition in both feet. The boys&#x27; father, Joshua Stevens, was a farmer and cobbler who struggled to make a living in Vermont. After fathering two more sons (born without disability), Joshua abandoned the children and his wife Sarah ( Morrill). The circumstances of his departure and his subsequent fate are uncertain; he may have died at the Battle of Oswego during the War of 1812.

Sarah Stevens struggled to make a living from the farm even with the increasing aid of her sons. She was determined that her sons improve themselves, and in 1807 moved the family to the neighboring town of Peacham, Vermont, where she enrolled young Thaddeus in the Caledonia Grammar School (often called the Peacham Academy). He suffered much from the taunts of his classmates for his disability. Later accounts describe him as &quot;wilful, headstrong&quot; with &quot;an overwhelming burning desire to secure an education.&quot;

After graduation, he enrolled at the University of Vermont, but suspended his studies due to the federal government&#x27;s appropriation of campus buildings during the War of 1812. Stevens then enrolled in the sophomore class at Dartmouth College. At Dartmouth, despite a stellar academic career, he was not elected to Phi Beta Kappa; this was reportedly a scarring experience for him.

Stevens graduated from Dartmouth in 1814 and spoke at the commencement ceremony. Afterward, he returned to Peacham and briefly taught there. Stevens also began to read law in the office of John Mattocks. In early 1815, correspondence with a friend, Samuel Merrill, a fellow Vermonter who had moved to York, Pennsylvania to become preceptor of the York Academy, led to an offer for Stevens to join the academy faculty. He moved to York to teach, and continued the study of law in the offices of David Cossett.

==Pennsylvania attorney and politician==
===Gettysburg lawyer===

In Pennsylvania, Stevens taught school at the York Academy and continued his studies for the bar. Local lawyers passed a resolution barring from membership anyone who had &quot;followed any other profession while preparing for admission,&quot; a restriction likely aimed at Stevens. Undaunted, he reportedly (according to a story he often retold) presented himself and four bottles of Madeira wine to the examining board in nearby Harford County, Maryland. Few questions were asked, but much wine was drunk. He left Bel Air the next morning with a certificate allowing him, through reciprocity, to practice law anywhere. Stevens then went to Gettysburg, the seat of Adams County, where he opened an office in September 1816.

Stevens knew no one in Gettysburg and initially had little success as a lawyer. His breakthrough, in mid-1817, was a case in which a farmer who had been jailed for debt later killed one of the constables who had arrested him. His defense, although unsuccessful, impressed the local people, and he never lacked for business thereafter. In his legal career, he demonstrated the propensity for sarcasm that would later mark him as a politician, once telling a judge who accused him of manifesting contempt of court, &quot;Sir, I am doing my best to conceal it.&quot;

Many who memorialized Stevens after his death in 1868 agreed on his talent as a lawyer. He was involved in the first ten cases to reach the Supreme Court of Pennsylvania from Adams County after he began his practice and won nine. One case he later wished he had not won was &quot;Butler v. Delaplaine&quot;, in which he successfully reclaimed a slave on behalf of her owner.

In Gettysburg, Stevens also began his involvement in politics, serving six one-year terms on the borough council between 1822 and 1831 and becoming its president. He took the profits from his practice and invested them in Gettysburg real estate, becoming the largest landowner in the community by 1825, and had an interest in several iron furnaces outside town. In addition to assets, he acquired enemies; after the death of a pregnant black woman in Gettysburg, there were anonymous letter-writers to newspapers, hinting that Stevens was culpable. The rumors dogged him for years; when one newspaper opposed to Stevens printed a letter in 1831 naming him as the killer, he successfully sued for libel.

===Anti-Masonry===

Stevens&#x27;s first political cause was Anti-Masonry, which became widespread in 1826 after the disappearance and death of William Morgan, a Mason in upstate New York; fellow Masons were presumed to be the killers of Morgan because they disapproved of his publishing a book revealing the order&#x27;s secret rites. Since the leading candidate in opposition to President John Quincy Adams was General Andrew Jackson, a Mason who mocked opponents of the order, Anti-Masonry became closely associated with opposition to Jackson and his Jacksonian democracy policies once he was elected president in 1828.

Jackson&#x27;s adherents were from the old Democratic–Republican Party and eventually became known as the Democrats. Stevens had been told by a fellow attorney (and future president) James Buchanan that he could advance politically if he joined them. However, Stevens could not support Jackson, out of principle. For Stevens, Anti-Masonry became one means of opposing Jackson; he may also have had personal reasons as the Masons barred &quot;cripples&quot; from joining. Stevens took to Anti-Masonry with enthusiasm and remained loyal to it after most Pennsylvanians had dropped the cause. His biographer, Hans Trefousse, suggested that another reason for Stevens&#x27;s virulence was an attack of disease in the late 1820s that cost him his hair (he thereafter wore wigs, often ill-fitting), and &quot;the unwelcome illness may well have contributed to his unreasonable fanaticism concerning the Masons.&quot;

By 1829, Anti-Masonry had evolved into a political party, the Anti-Masonic Party, that proved popular in rural central Pennsylvania. Stevens quickly became prominent in the movement, attending the party&#x27;s first two national conventions in 1830 and 1831. At the latter, he pressed the candidacy of Supreme Court Justice John McLean as the party&#x27;s presidential candidate, but in vain as the nomination fell to former Attorney General William Wirt. Jackson was easily reelected; the crushing defeat (Wirt won only Vermont) caused the party to disappear in most places, though it remained powerful in Pennsylvania for several years.

In September 1833, Stevens was elected to a one-year term in the Pennsylvania House of Representatives as an Anti-Mason. Once in the capital Harrisburg, he sought to have the body establish a committee to investigate Masonry. Stevens gained attention far beyond Pennsylvania for his oratory against Masonry and quickly became an expert in legislative maneuvers. In 1835, a split among the Democrats put the Anti-Masons in control of the Pennsylvania General Assembly, the legislature. Granted subpoena powers, Stevens summoned leading state politicians who were Masons, including Governor George Wolf. The witnesses invoked their Fifth Amendment right against self-incrimination, and when Stevens verbally abused one of them, it created a backlash that caused his own party to end the investigation. The fracas cost Stevens reelection in 1836, and the issue of Anti-Masonry died in Pennsylvania. Nevertheless, Stevens remained an opponent of the order for the rest of his life.

===Crusader for education===

Beginning with his early years in Gettysburg, Stevens advanced the cause of universal education. At the time, no state outside New England had free public education for all. In Pennsylvania, there was free education in Philadelphia, but elsewhere in the state, those wishing to have their children educated without paying tuition had to swear a pauper&#x27;s oath. Stevens opened his extensive private library to the public and gave up his presidency of the borough council, believing his service on the school board more important. In 1825, he was elected by the voters of Adams County as a trustee of Gettysburg Academy. As the school was failing, Stevens got county voters to agree to pay its debt, allowing it to be sold as a Lutheran seminary. It was granted the right to award college degrees in 1831 as Pennsylvania College, and in 1921 became Gettysburg College. Stevens gave the school land upon which a building could be raised and served as a trustee for many years.
In April 1834, Stevens, working with Governor Wolf, guided an act through the legislature to allow districts across the state to vote on whether to have public schools and the taxes to pay for them. Gettysburg&#x27;s district voted in favor and also elected Stevens as a school director, where he served until 1839. Tens of thousands of voters signed petitions urging a reversal. The result was a repeal bill that easily passed the Pennsylvania Senate. It was widely believed the bill would also pass the House and be enacted despite opposition by Stevens. When he rose to speak on April 11, 1835, he defended the new educational system, stating that it would actually save money, and demonstrated how. He stated that opponents were seeking to separate the poor into a lower caste than themselves and accused the rich of greed and failure to empathize with the poor. Stevens argued, &quot;Build not your monuments of brass or marble, but make them of everliving mind!&quot; The repeal bill was defeated; Stevens was given wide credit. Trefousse suggested that the victory was not due to Stevens&#x27;s eloquence, but due to his influence, combined with that of Governor Wolf.

===Political change; move to Lancaster===

In 1838, Stevens ran again for the legislature. He hoped that if the remaining Anti-Masons and the emerging Whig Party gained a majority, he could be elected to the United States Senate, whose members until 1913 were chosen by state legislatures. A campaign, dirty even by the standards of the times, followed. The result was a Democrat elected as governor, Whig control of the state Senate, and the state House in dispute, with several seats from Philadelphia in question. Stevens won his seat in Adams County, and sought to have those Philadelphia Democrats excluded, which would create a Whig majority that could elect a Speaker and himself as a senator. Amid rioting in Harrisburglater known as the &quot;Buckshot War&quot;Stevens&#x27;s ploy backfired, with the Democrats taking control of the House. Stevens remained in the legislature for most years through 1842 but the episode cost him much of his political influence. The Whigs blamed him for the debacle and were increasingly unwilling to give leadership to someone who had not yet joined their party. Nevertheless, he supported the pro-business and pro-development Whig stances. He campaigned for the Whig candidate in the 1840 presidential election, former general William Henry Harrison. Though Stevens later alleged that Harrison had promised him a Cabinet position if elected, he received none, and any influence ended when Harrison died after a month in office, to be succeeded by John Tyler, a southerner hostile to Stevens&#x27;s stances on slavery.

Although Stevens was the most successful lawyer in Gettysburg, he had accrued debt due to his business interests. Refusing to take advantage of the bankruptcy laws, he felt he needed to move to a larger municipality to gain the money to pay his obligations. In 1842, Stevens moved his home and practice to Lancaster. He knew Lancaster County was an Anti-Mason and Whig stronghold, which ensured that he retained a political base. Within a short period, he was earning more than any other Lancaster attorney; by 1848, he had reduced his debts to $30,000 (~$ in ) and paid them off soon after. It was in Lancaster that he engaged the services of Lydia Hamilton Smith, a housekeeper, whose racial makeup was described as mulatto, and who remained with him the rest of his life.

==Abolitionist and prewar congressman==
===Evolution of views===

In the 1830s, few sought the immediate eradication of slavery. The abolitionist movement was young and only recently had figures such as William Lloyd Garrison taken on the fight. Stevens&#x27;s reason for adopting slavery as a cause has been disputed among his recent biographers. Richard N. Current, in 1942, suggested it was out of ambition; Fawn Brodie, in her controversial 1959 psychobiography of Stevens, suggested it was out of identification with the downtrodden, based on his handicap. Trefousse, in his 1997 work, also suggested that Stevens&#x27;s feelings towards the downtrodden were a factor, combined with remorse over the &quot;Butler&quot; case, but that ambition was unlikely to have been a significant motivator, as Stevens&#x27;s fervor in the anti-slavery cause inhibited his career.
At the 1837 Pennsylvania constitutional convention, Stevens, who was a delegate, fought against the disenfranchisement of African-Americans (see Black suffrage in Pennsylvania). According to historian Eric Foner, &quot;When Stevens refused to sign the 1837 constitution because of its voting provision, he announced his commitment to a non-racial definition of American citizenship to which he would adhere for the remainder of his life.&quot; After he moved to Lancaster, a city not far from the Mason–Dixon line, he became active in the Underground Railroad, not only defending people believed to be fugitive slaves, but coordinating the movements of those seeking freedom. A 2003 renovation at his former home in Lancaster disclosed that there was a hidden cistern, attached to the main building by a concealed tunnel, in which escaped slaves hid.

Until the outbreak of the American Civil War, Stevens took the public position that he supported slavery&#x27;s end and opposed its expansion. Nevertheless, he would not seek to disturb it in the states where it existed, because the Constitution protected their internal affairs from federal interference. He also supported slave-owning Whig candidates for president: Henry Clay in 1844 and Zachary Taylor in 1848.

===First tenure in Congress===

In 1848, Stevens ran for election to Congress from . There was opposition to him at the Whig convention. Some delegates felt that because Stevens had been late to join the party, he should not receive the nomination; others disliked his stance on slavery. He narrowly won the nomination. In a strong year for Whigs nationally, Taylor was chosen as president and Stevens was elected to Congress.
When the 31st United States Congress convened in December 1849, Stevens took his seat, joining other newly elected slavery opponents such as Salmon P. Chase. Stevens spoke out against the Compromise of 1850, crafted by Kentucky Senator Henry Clay, that gave victories to both North and South, but would allow for some of the territories of the United States recently gained from Mexico to become slave states. As the debates continued, in June he said, &quot;This word &#x27;compromise&#x27; when applied to human rights and constitutional rights I abhor.&quot; Nevertheless, the pieces of legislation that made up the Compromise passed, including the Fugitive Slave Act of 1850, which Stevens found particularly offensive. Although many Americans hoped that the Compromise would bring sectional peace, Stevens warned that it would be &quot;the fruitful mother of future rebellion, disunion, and civil war.&quot;

Stevens was easily renominated and reelected in 1850, even though his stance caused him problems among pro-Compromise Whigs. In 1851, Stevens was one of the defense lawyers in the trial of 38 African-Americans and three others in federal court in Philadelphia on treason charges. The defendants had been implicated in the so-called Christiana Riot: an attempt to enforce a Fugitive Slave Act warrant had resulted in the killing of the slaveowner. Justice Robert Grier of the U.S. Supreme Court, as circuit justice, tried the case, and instructed the jury to acquit because though the defendants might be guilty of murder or riot, they were not charged with that and were not guilty of treason. The well-publicized incident (and others like it) increased polarization over the issue of slavery, and made Stevens a prominent face of Northern abolitionism.

Despite this trend, Stevens suffered political problems. He left the Whig caucus in December 1851, when his colleagues would not join him in seeking the repeal of the offensive elements of the Compromise. Nevertheless, he supported its unsuccessful 1852 candidate for president, General Winfield Scott. His political opposition, and local dislike of his stance on slavery and participation in the treason trial, made him unlikely to win renomination, and he sought only to pick his successor. His choice was defeated for the Whig nomination.

===Know-Nothing and Republican===

Out of office, Stevens concentrated on the practice of law in Lancaster, remaining one of the leading attorneys in the state. He stayed active in politics, and in 1854, to gain more votes for the anti-slavery movement, he joined the nativist Know Nothing Party. The members were pledged not to speak of party deliberations (thus, they knew nothing), and Stevens was attacked for his membership in a group with similar secrecy rules as the Masons. In 1855, Stevens joined the new Republican Party. Other former Whigs who were anti-slavery joined as well, including William H. Seward of New York, Charles E. Sumner of Massachusetts, and Abraham Lincoln of Illinois.

Stevens was a delegate to the 1856 Republican National Convention, where he supported Justice McLean, as he had in 1832. However, the convention nominated John C. Frémont, whom Stevens actively supported in the race against his fellow Lancastrian, the Democratic candidate James Buchanan. Nonetheless, Pennsylvania helped elect Buchanan. Stevens returned to the practice of law, but in 1858, with the President and his party unpopular and the nation torn by such controversies as the Dred Scott decision, Stevens saw an opportunity to return to Congress. As the Republican nominee, he was easily elected. Democratic papers were appalled. One banner headline read, &quot;Niggerism Triumphant.&quot;

===1860 election; secession crisis===

Stevens took his seat in the 36th United States Congress in December 1859, only days after the hanging of John Brown, who had attacked the federal arsenal at Harpers Ferry hoping to cause a slave insurrection. Stevens opposed Brown&#x27;s violent actions at the time, though later, he was more approving. Sectional tensions spilled over into the House, which proved unable to elect a Speaker of the United States House for eight weeks. Stevens was active in the bitter flow of invective from both sides; at one point, Mississippi Congressman William Barksdale drew a knife on him, though no blood was spilled.
With the Democrats unable to agree on a single presidential candidate, the 1860 Republican National Convention in Chicago became crucial, as the nominee would be in a favorable position to become president. Prominent figures in the party, such as Seward and Lincoln, sought the nomination. Stevens continued to support the 75-year-old Justice McLean. Beginning on the second ballot, most Pennsylvania delegates supported Lincoln, helping to win him the nomination. As the Democrats put up no candidate in his district, Stevens was assured of reelection to the House and campaigned for Lincoln in Pennsylvania. Lincoln won a majority in the Electoral College. The President-elect&#x27;s known opposition to the expansion of slavery caused immediate talk of secession in the southern states, a threat that Stevens had downplayed during the campaign.

Congress convened in December 1860, with several of the southern states already pledging to secede. Stevens was unyielding in opposing efforts to appease the southerners, such as the Crittenden Compromise, which would have enshrined slavery as beyond constitutional amendment. He stated, in a remark widely quoted both North and South, that rather than offer concessions because of Lincoln&#x27;s election, he would see &quot;this Government crumble into a thousand atoms,&quot; and that the forces of the United States would crush any rebellion. Despite Stevens&#x27;s protests, the lame-duck Buchanan administration did little in response to the secession votes, allowing most federal resources in the South to fall into rebel hands. Even in the abolition movement, many were content to let it be so and let the South go its own way. Stevens disagreed, and the congressman was &quot;undoubtedly pleased&quot; by Lincoln&#x27;s statement in his first inaugural address on March 4, 1861, that he would &quot;hold, occupy and possess the property and places belonging to the Government.&quot;

==American Civil War==
===Slavery===

When the war began in April 1861, Stevens argued that the Confederates were revolutionaries to be crushed by force. He also believed that the Confederacy had placed itself beyond the protection of the U.S. Constitution by making war, and that in a reconstituted United States, slavery should have no place. Speaker Galusha Grow, whose views placed him with Stevens among the members becoming known as the Radical Republicans (for their position on slavery, as opposed to the liberal or moderate Republicans), appointed him as chairman of the House Ways and Means Committee. This position gave him power over the House&#x27;s agenda.
In July 1861, Stevens secured the passage of an act to confiscate the property, including slaves, of certain rebels. In November 1861, Stevens introduced a resolution to emancipate all slaves; it was defeated. However, legislation did pass that abolished slavery in the District of Columbia and in the territories. By March 1862, to Stevens&#x27;s exasperation, the most Lincoln had publicly supported was gradual emancipation in the Border states, with the slave owners compensated by the federal government.

Stevens and other radicals were frustrated at how slow Lincoln was to adopt their policies for emancipation; according to Brodie, &quot;Lincoln seldom succeeded in matching Stevens&#x27;s pace, though both were marching towards the same bright horizon.&quot; In April 1862, Stevens wrote to a friend, &quot;As for future hopes, they are poor as Lincoln is nobody.&quot; The radicals aggressively pushed the issue, provoking Lincoln to comment: &quot;Stevens, Sumner and [Massachusetts Senator Henry] Wilson simply haunt me with their importunities for a Proclamation of Emancipation. Wherever I go and whatever way I turn, they are on my tail, and still in my heart, I have the deep conviction that the hour [to issue one] has not yet come.&quot; The President stated that if it came to a showdown between the radicals and their enemies, he would have to side with Stevens and his fellows, and deemed them &quot;the unhandiest devils in the world to deal with&quot; but &quot;with their faces... set Zionwards.&quot; Although Lincoln composed his proclamation in June and July 1862, the secret was held within his Cabinet, and the President turned aside radical pleadings to issue one until after the Union victory at the Battle of Antietam in September. Stevens quickly adopted the Emancipation Proclamation for use in his successful re-election campaign. When Congress returned in December, Stevens maintained his criticism of Lincoln&#x27;s policies, calling them &quot;flagrant usurpations, deserving the condemnation of the community.&quot; Stevens generally opposed Lincoln&#x27;s plans to colonize freed slaves abroad, though sometimes he supported emigration proposals for political reasons. Stevens wrote to a nephew in June 1863 saying, &quot;The slaves ought to be incited to insurrection and give the rebels a taste of real civil war.&quot;
During the Confederate incursion into the North in mid-1863 that culminated in the Battle of Gettysburg, Confederates twice sent parties to Stevens&#x27;s Caledonia Forge. Stevens, who had been there supervising operations, was hastened away by his workers against his will. General Jubal Early looted and vandalized the Forge, causing a loss to Stevens of about $80,000. Early said that the North had done the same to southern figures and that Stevens was well known for his vindictiveness towards the South. Asked if he would have taken the congressman to Libby Prison in Richmond, Early replied that he would have hanged Stevens and divided his bones among the Confederate states.

Stevens pushed Congress to pass a constitutional amendment abolishing slavery. The Emancipation Proclamation was a wartime measure, did not apply to all slaves, and might be reversed by peacetime courts; an amendment would be slavery&#x27;s end. The Thirteenth Amendmentwhich outlawed slavery and involuntary servitude except as a punishment for crimeeasily passed the Senate but failed in the House in June; fears that it might not pass delayed a renewed attempt there. Lincoln campaigned aggressively for the amendment after his re-election in 1864, and Stevens described his December annual message to Congress as &quot;the most important and best message that has been communicated to Congress for the last 60years&quot;. Stevens closed the debate on the amendment on January 13, 1865. Illinois Representative Isaac Arnold wrote: &quot;distinguished soldiers and citizens filled every available seat, to hear the eloquent old man speak on a measure that was to consummate the warfare of forty years against slavery.&quot;

The amendment passed narrowly after heavy pressure exerted by Lincoln himself, along with offers of political appointments from the &quot;Seward lobby&quot;. Democrats made allegations of bribery; Stevens stated: &quot;the greatest measure of the nineteenth century was passed by corruption, aided and abetted by the purest man in America.&quot; The amendment was declared ratified on December 18, 1865. Stevens continued to push for a broad interpretation of it that included economic justice in addition to the formal end of slavery.

After passing the Thirteenth Amendment, Congress debated the economic rights of the freedmen. Urged on by Stevens, it voted to authorize the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands, with a mandate (though no funding) to set up schools and to distribute &quot;not more than forty acres&quot; [16 ha] of confiscated Confederate land to each family of freed slaves.

===Financing the war===

Stevens worked closely with Lincoln administration officials on legislation to finance the war. Within a day of his appointment as Ways and Means chairman, he had reported a bill for a war loan. Legislation to pay the soldiers Lincoln had already called into service and to allow the administration to borrow to prosecute the war quickly followed. These acts and more were pushed through the House by Stevens. To defeat the delaying tactics of Copperhead opponents, he had the House set debate limits as short as half a minute.

Stevens played a major part in the passage of the Legal Tender Act of 1862 when for the first time, the United States issued currency backed only by its own credit, not by gold or silver. Early makeshifts to finance the war, such as war bonds, had failed as it became clear the war would not be short. In 1863, Stevens aided the passage of the National Banking Act, which required that banks limit their currency issues to the number of federal bonds that they were required to hold. The system endured for half a century until supplanted by the Federal Reserve System in 1913.

Although the Legal Tender legislation allowed for the payment of government obligations in paper money, Stevens was unable to get the Senate to agree that interest on the national debt should be paid with greenbacks. As the value of paper money dropped, Stevens railed against gold speculators, and in June 1864, after consultation with Treasury Secretary Salmon P. Chase, proposed what became known as the Gold Billto abolish the gold market by forbidding its sale by brokers or for future delivery. It passed Congress in June; the chaos caused by the lack of an organized gold market caused the value of paper to drop even faster. Under heavy pressure from the business community, Congress repealed the bill on July 1, twelve days after its passage. Stevens was unrepentant even as the value of paper currency recovered in late 1864 amid the expectation of Union victory, proposing legislation to make paying a premium in greenbacks for an amount in gold coin a criminal offense. It did not pass.

Like most Pennsylvania politicians of both parties, Stevens was a major proponent of tariffs, which increased from 19% to 48% from fiscal 1861 to fiscal 1865. According to activist Ida Tarbell in &quot;The Tariff in Our Times:&quot; [Import] duties were never too high for [Stevens], particularly for iron, for he was a manufacturer and it was often said in Pennsylvania that the duties he advocated in no way represented the large iron interests of the state, but were hoisted to cover the needs of his own... badly managed works.&quot;

==Reconstruction==

===Problem of reconstructing the South===

As Congress debated how the U.S. would be organized after the war, the status of freed slaves and former Confederates remained undetermined. Stevens stated that what was needed was a &quot;radical reorganization of southern institutions, habits, and manners.&quot; Stevens, Sumner, and other radicals argued that the southern states should be treated like conquered provinces without constitutional rights. Lincoln, on the contrary, said that only individuals, not states, had rebelled. In July 1864, Stevens pushed Lincoln to sign the Wade–Davis Bill, which required at least half of prewar voters to sign an oath of loyalty for a state to gain readmission. Lincoln, who advocated his more lenient ten percent plan, pocket vetoed it.

Stevens reluctantly voted for Lincoln at the convention of the National Union Party, a coalition of Republicans and War Democrats. He would have preferred to vote for the sitting vice president, Hannibal Hamlin, as Lincoln&#x27;s running mate in 1864. However, his delegation voted to cast the state&#x27;s ballots for the administration&#x27;s favored candidate, Military Governor of Tennessee Andrew Johnson, a War Democrat who had been a Tennessee senator and elected governor. Stevens was disgusted at Johnson&#x27;s nomination, complaining, &quot;can&#x27;t you get a candidate for Vice-President without going down into a damned rebel province for one?&quot; Stevens campaigned for the Lincoln–Johnson ticket; it was elected, as was Stevens for another term in the House. When in January 1865 Congress learned that Lincoln had attempted peace talks with Confederate leaders, an outraged Stevens declared that if the American electorate could vote again, they would elect General Benjamin Butler instead of Lincoln.

===Presidential Reconstruction===

Before leaving town after Congress adjourned in March 1865, Stevens privately urged Lincoln to press the South hard militarily, though the war was ending. Lincoln replied, &quot;Stevens, this is a pretty big hog we are trying to catch and to hold when we catch him. We must take care that he does not slip away from us.&quot; Never to see Lincoln again, Stevens left with &quot;a homely metaphor but no real certainty of having left as much as a thumbprint on Lincoln&#x27;s policy.&quot; On the evening of April 14, 1865, Lincoln was assassinated by Confederate sympathizer John Wilkes Booth. Stevens did not attend the ceremonies when Lincoln&#x27;s funeral train stopped in Lancaster; he was said to be ill. Trefousse speculated that he had avoided the rites for other reasons. According to Lincoln biographer Carl Sandburg, Stevens stood at a railroad bridge and lifted his hat.

In May 1865, Andrew Johnson began what came to be known as &quot;Presidential Reconstruction&quot;: recognizing a provisional government of Virginia led by Francis Harrison Pierpont, calling for other former rebel states to organize constitutional conventions, declaring amnesty for many southerners, and issuing individual pardons to even more. Johnson did not push the states to protect the rights of freed slaves, and immediately began to counteract the land reform policies of the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau. These actions outraged Stevens and others who took his view. The radicals saw that freedmen in the South risked losing the economic and political liberty necessary to sustain emancipation from slavery. They began to call for universal male suffrage and continued their demands for land reform.

Stevens wrote to Johnson that his policies were gravely damaging the country and that he should call a special session of Congress, which was not scheduled to meet until December. When his communications were ignored, Stevens began to discuss with other radicals how to prevail over Johnson when the two houses convened. Congress has the constitutional power to judge whether those seeking to be its members are properly elected; Stevens urged that no senators or representatives from the South be seated. He argued that the states should not be readmitted as thereafter Congress would lack the power to force race reform.

In September, Stevens gave a widely reprinted speech in Lancaster in which he set forth what he wanted for the South. He proposed that the government confiscate the estates of the largest 70,000 landholders there, those who owned more than . Much of this property he wanted distributed in plots of to the freedmen; other lands would go to reward loyalists both North and South, or to meet government obligations. He warned that under the President&#x27;s plan, the southern states would send rebels to Congress who would join with northern Democrats and Johnson to govern the nation and perhaps undo emancipation.

Through late 1865, the southern states held white-only balloting and, in congressional elections, chose many former rebels, most prominently Confederate Vice President Alexander Stephens, voted as senator by the Georgia Legislature. Violence against African-Americans was common and unpunished in the South; the new legislatures enacted Black Codes, depriving the freedmen of most civil rights. These actions, seen as provocative in the North, both privately dismayed Johnson and helped turn northern public opinion against the president. Stevens proclaimed that &quot;This is not a &#x27;white man&#x27;s Government&#x27;!... To say so is political blasphemy, for it violates the fundamental principles of our gospel of liberty.&quot;

===Congressional Reconstruction===

By this time, Stevens was past age seventy and in poor health; he was carried everywhere in a special chair. When Congress convened in early December 1865, Stevens made arrangements with the Clerk of the House that when the roll was called, the names of the Southern electees be omitted. The Senate also excluded Southern claimants. A new congressman, Ohio&#x27;s Rutherford B. Hayes, described Stevens: &quot;He is radical throughout, except, I am told, he don&#x27;t believe in hanging. He is [a] leader.&quot;

As the responsibilities of the Ways and Means chairman had been divided, Stevens took the post of Chairman of the House Committee on Appropriations, retaining control over the House&#x27;s agenda. Stevens focused on legislation that would secure the freedom promised by the newly ratified Thirteenth Amendment. He proposed and then co-chaired the Joint Committee on Reconstruction with Maine Senator William Pitt Fessenden. This body, also called the Committee of Fifteen, investigated conditions in the South. It heard not only of the violence against African-Americans but against Union loyalists and against what southerners termed &quot;carpetbaggers&quot;. Northerners who had journeyed south after the restoration of peace. Stevens declared: that &quot;our loyal brethren at the South, whether they be black or white,&quot; required urgent protection &quot;from the barbarians who are now daily murdering them&quot;.

The Committee of Fifteen began to consider what would become the Fourteenth Amendment. Stevens had begun drafting versions in December 1865, before the Committee had even formed. In January 1866, a subcommittee including Stevens and John Bingham proposed two amendments: one giving Congress the unqualified power to secure equal rights, privileges, and protections for all citizens; the other explicitly annulling all racially discriminatory laws. Stevens believed that the Declaration of Independence and Organic Acts already bound the federal government to these principles, but that an amendment was necessary to allow enforcement against discrimination at the state level. The resolution providing for what would become the Fourteenth Amendment was watered down in Congress; during the closing debate, Stevens said these changes had shattered his lifelong dream in equality for all Americans. Nevertheless, stating that he lived among men, not angels, he supported the passage of the compromise amendment. Still, Stevens told the House: &quot;Forty acres of land and a hut would be more valuable to [the African-American] than the immediate right to vote.&quot;
When Illinois Senator Lyman Trumbull introduced legislation to reauthorize and expand the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau, Stevens called the bill a &quot;robbery&quot; because it did not include sufficient provisions for land reform or protect the property of refugees given them by the military occupation of the South. Johnson vetoed the bill anyway, calling the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau unconstitutional, and decrying its cost: Congress had never purchased land, established schools, or provided financial help for &quot;our own people.&quot; Congress was unable to override Johnson&#x27;s veto in February, but five months later passed a . Stevens criticized the passage of the Southern Homestead Act of 1866, arguing that the low-quality land it made available would not drive real economic growth for black families.

Congress overrode a Johnson veto to pass the Civil Rights Act of 1866 (also introduced by Trumbull), granting African-Americans citizenship and equality before the law and forbidding any action by a state to the contrary. Johnson made the gap between him and Congress wider when he accused Stevens, Sumner, and Wendell Phillips of trying to destroy the government.

After Congress adjourned in July, the campaigning for the fall elections began. Johnson embarked on a trip by rail, dubbed the &quot;Swing Around the Circle&quot; that won him few supporters; his arguments with hecklers were deemed undignified. He attacked Stevens and other radicals during this tour. Stevens campaigned for firm measures against the South, his hand strengthened by violence in Memphis and New Orleans, where African-Americans and white Unionists had been attacked by mobs, including the police. Stevens was returned to Congress by his constituents; Republicans would have a two-thirds majority in both houses in the next Congress.

===Radical Reconstruction===

In January 1867, Stevens introduced legislation to divide the South into five districts, each commanded by an army general empowered to override civil authorities. These military officers were to supervise elections with all males of whatever race, entitled to vote, except for those who could not take an oath of past loyaltymost white Southerners could not. The states were to write new constitutions (subject to approval by Congress) and hold elections for state officials. Only if a state ratified the Fourteenth Amendment would its delegation be seated in Congress. The system gave power to a Republican coalition of freedmen (mobilized by the Union League), carpetbaggers, and co-operative Southerners (the last dubbed scalawags by indignant ex-rebels) in most southern states. These states ratified the Fourteenth Amendment, which became part of the Constitution in mid-1868.

Stevens introduced a Tenure of Office Act, restricting Johnson from firing officials who had received Senate confirmation without getting that body&#x27;s consent. The Tenure of Office Act was ambiguous since it could be read to protect officeholders only during the tenure of the president who appointed them, and most of the officials the radicals sought to protect had been named by Lincoln. Chief among these was Secretary of War Edwin Stanton, a radical himself.

Stevens steered a bill to enfranchise African-Americans in the District of Columbia through the House. The Senate passed it in 1867, and it was enacted over Johnson&#x27;s veto. Congress was downsizing the Army for peacetime; Stevens offered an amendment, which became part of the bill as enacted, to have two regiments of African-American cavalry. His solicitude for African-Americans extended to the Native American; Stevens was successful in defeating a bill to place reservations under state law, noting that the native people had often been abused by the states. An expansionist, he supported the railroads. He added a stipulation into the [Transcontinental] Pacific Railroad Act requiring the applicable railroads to buy iron &quot;of American manufacture&quot; of the top price qualities. Although he sought to protect manufacturers with high tariffs, he also sought unsuccessfully to get a bill passed to protect labor with an eight-hour day in the District of Columbia. Stevens advocated a bill to give government workers raises; it did not pass.

==Impeaching President Johnson==

With Stevens&#x27; agreement, James Mitchell Ashley introduced a resolution on January 7, 1867, for a Judiciary Committee-run inquiry on impeachment, which passed the House.
The 40th Congress, which convened on March 4, 1867, proved to be less aggressive in opposing Johnson than Stevens had hoped. It soon adjourned until July, though the Judiciary Committee remained to hold hearings on impeachment. Stevens (who believed that impeachment was a &quot;purely political proceeding intended as a remedy for malfeasance in office and to prevent continuance thereof&quot;) firmly supported impeachment, but others were less enthusiastic once the Senate elected Ohio&#x27;s Benjamin Wade as its president &quot;pro tempore&quot;, next in line to the presidency in the absence of a vice president. Wade was a radical who supported wealth redistribution; a speech of his in Kansas so impressed Karl Marx that he mentioned it in the first German edition of &quot;Das Kapital&quot;. Also a supporter of women&#x27;s suffrage, Wade was widely mistrusted for his views; the prospect of his succession made some advocates of Johnson&#x27;s removal more hesitant. Stevens, though, strongly supported the removal of the president, and when the Judiciary Committee failed to report, tried to keep Congress in session until it did. Despite his opposition to its leader, Stevens worked with the administration on matters both supported; he obtained an appropriation for the purchase of Alaska and urged Secretary of State Seward to seek other territories into which to expand .

Most of Johnson&#x27;s Cabinet supported him, but Secretary of War Stanton did not, and with the General of the Army, war hero Ulysses S. Grant, worked to undermine Johnson&#x27;s Reconstruction policies. Johnson obeyed the laws that Congress had passed, sometimes over his veto, but often interpreted them in ways contrary to their intent. After Stanton refused Johnson&#x27;s request that he resign in August 1867, Johnson suspended Stanton, as permitted by the Tenure of Office Act, and made General Grant interim Secretary of War. Republicans campaigned in that year&#x27;s election on the issue of African-American suffrage, but were met with a voter surge towards the Democrats, who opposed it. Although no seats at Congress were directly at stake, voters in Ohio both defeated a referendum on black suffrage and elected the Democrats to the majority in the legislature, meaning that Wade, whose term was due to expire in 1869, would not be reelected.

When Congress met again, on December 7, 1867 Stevens voted for an impeachment resolution that was heavily defeated, though the Judiciary Committee had voted 5–4 for impeachment.

Stevens was chairman of the House Select Committee on Reconstruction, which was tasked by the House on January 27, 1868, with running a second impeachment inquiry. Only four of the nine members (three Republicans and a Democrat) had supported impeachment in December 1867. On February 13, 1868, Stevens presented to the committee a report accusing Johnson of actions that intended to violate the Tenure of Office Act. The committee tabled it by a 5–4 vote.

The prospects of impeachment took new life on February 21, 1868. The Senate had previously, on January 13, 1868, overturned Johnson&#x27;s suspension of Stanton. Grant then resigned as Secretary of War, and Stanton reclaimed his place. However, on February 21, the president ousted Stanton from his position, appointing General Lorenzo Thomas in his placethough Stanton barricaded himself in his office. These actions caused great excitement in Washington, and in the House of Representatives, Stevens went from group to group on the floor, repeating, &quot;Didn&#x27;t I tell you so? What good did your moderation do you? If you don&#x27;t kill the beast, it will kill you.&quot; On February 22, Stevens reported from the Select Committee on Reconstruction a resolution and a report opining that Johnson should be impeached for high crimes and misdemeanors. Stevens concluded the debate on the impeachment resolution on February 24, though due to his poor health, he could not complete his speech and gave it to the Clerk to read aloud. In the speech, he accused Johnson of usurping the powers of other branches of government and ignoring the people&#x27;s will. He did not deny impeachment was a political matter, but &quot;this is not to be the temporary triumph of a political party, but is to endure in its consequence until the whole continent shall be filled with a free and untrammeled people or shall be a nest of shrinking, cowardly slaves.&quot; The House voted 126–47 to impeach the president.

Stevens led the delegation of House members sent the following day to inform the Senate of the impeachment, though he had to be carried to its doors by his bearers. Elected to the committee charged with drafting articles of impeachment, his illness limited his involvement. Nevertheless, dissatisfied with the committee&#x27;s proposed articles, Stevens suggested another that would become ArticleXI. This grounded the various accusations in statements Johnson had made denying the legitimacy of Congress due to the exclusion of the southern states and stated that Johnson had tried to disobey the Reconstruction Acts. Stevens also urged Benjamin Butler to, independent of the committee, write his own impeachment article, which would ultimately be adopted as Article X.

Stevens was one of the House impeachment managers (prosecutors) elected by the House to present its case in the impeachment trial. Although Stevens was too ill to appear in the Senate on March 3, when the managers requested that Johnson be summoned (the president would appear only by his counsel or defense managers), he was there ten days later when the summons was returnable. The &quot;New York Herald&quot; described him as having a &quot;face of corpselike color, and rigidly twitching lips... a strange and unearthly apparitiona reclused remonstrance from the tomb... the very embodiment of fanaticism, without a solitary leaven of justice or mercy... the avenging Nemesis of his partythe sworn and implacable foe of the Executive of the nation.&quot;

Increasingly ill, Stevens took little part in the impeachment trial, at which the leading House manager was Massachusetts Representative Benjamin F. Butler. Stevens nourished himself on the Senate floor with raw eggs and terrapin, port and brandy. He spoke only twice before making a closing argument for the House managers on April 27. As he spoke, his voice weakened, and finally, he allowed Butler to read the second half of his speech for him. Stevens focused on ArticleXI, taking the position that Johnson could be removed for political crimes; he need not have committed an offense against the law. The president, having sworn to faithfully execute the laws, had intentionally disobeyed the Tenure of Office Act after the Senate had refused to uphold his removal of Stanton, &quot;and now this offspring of assassination turns upon the Senate who have... rebuked him in a constitutional manner and bids them defiance. How can he escape the just vengeance of the law?&quot;

Most radicals were confident that Johnson would be convicted and removed from office. Stevens, though, was never certain of the result as Chief Justice Chase (the former Treasury Secretary) made rulings that favored the defense, and he had no great confidence Republicans would stick together. On May 11, the Senate met in secret session, and senators gave speeches explaining how they intended to vote. All Democrats were opposed, but an unexpectedly large number of Republicans also favored acquittal on some or all of the articles. Counting votes, managers realized their best chance of gaining the required two-thirds for conviction was on the Stevens-inspired ArticleXI, and when the Senate assembled to give its verdict, they scheduled it to be voted upon first. The suspense was broken when Kansas Senator Edmund Ross, whose position was uncertain, voted for acquittal. This meant that, with the votes of those who remained, the president would not be convicted on that article. The article failed, 35 in favor to 19 opposed. In the hope that delay would bring a different result, Republicans adjourned the Senate for ten days. Stevens was carried from the Senate in his chairone observer described him as &quot;black with rage and disappointment&quot;and when those outside clamored for the result, Stevens shouted, &quot;The country is going to the devil!&quot;

==Final months and death==

During the recess of the impeachment court, the Republicans met in convention in Chicago and nominated Grant for president. Stevens did not attend and was dismayed by the exclusion of African-American suffrage from the party platform as radical influence began to fade in the Republican Party. When the Senate returned to session, it voted down ArticlesII andIII by the same 35–19 margin as before, and Chase declared the President acquitted. Stevens did not give up on the idea of removing Johnson; in July, he proffered several more impeachment articles (the House refused to adopt them). He offered a bill to divide Texas into several parts to gain additional Republican senators to vote out Johnson. It was defeated; the &quot;Herald&quot; stated, &quot;It is lamentable to see this old man, with one foot in the grave, pursuing the President with such vindictiveness.&quot; Nevertheless, Stevens planned to revisit the question of impeachment when Congress met again in late 1868.

Brodie suggested that Stevens&#x27;s hatred of Johnson was the only thing keeping him from despair, aware as he was of the continued violence in the South, some of which was committed by the Ku Klux Klan. Several of the southern states had been re-admitted by this time. The murders and intimidation were aiding the Democrats there in restoring white rule. With the Republicans unwilling to embrace black suffrage in their platform and the Democrats opposed to it, Stevens feared Democratic victory in the 1868 elections might even bring back slavery. He told his fellow Pennsylvania politician, Alexander McClure, &quot;My life has been a failure. With all this great struggle of years in Washington and the fearful sacrifice of life and treasure, I see little hope for the Republic.&quot; Stevens took pride in his role in establishing free public education in Pennsylvania. When interviewed by a reporter seeking to gain his life story, Stevens replied, &quot;I have no history. My life-long regret is that I have lived so long and so uselessly.&quot; Nevertheless, in his last formal speech to the House, Stevens stated that &quot;man still is vile. But such large steps have lately been taken in the true direction, that the patriot has a right to take courage.&quot;
When Congress adjourned in late July, Stevens remained in Washington, too ill to return to Pennsylvania. Stevens was in pain from his stomach ailments, from swollen feet, and from dropsy. By early August, he was unable to leave the house. He still received some visitors, though, and correctly predicted to his friend and former student Simon Stevens (no relation) that Grant would win the election. On the afternoon of August 11, his doctor warned that he would probably not last through the night. His longtime housekeeper and companion, Lydia Hamilton Smith, his nephew Thaddeus, and friends gathered by him. Two black preachers came to pray by him, telling him that he had the prayers of all their people. He sucked on ice to try to soothe the pain; his last words were a request for more of it. Thaddeus Stevens died on the night of August 11, 1868, as the old day departed.

President Johnson issued no statement upon the death of his enemy. Newspaper reaction was generally along partisan lines, though sometimes mixed. The Detroit &quot;Post&quot; stated that &quot;if to die crowned with noble laurels, and... secure of [&quot;recte&quot; in] the respect of the world... is an end worthy the ambition of a well spent life, then the veteran Radical may lie down with the noblest of the fathers to a well contented sleep.&quot; &quot;The New York Times&quot; stated that Stevens had &quot;discerned the expediency of emancipation, and urged it long before Mr. Lincoln issued his proclamation&quot; but that after the war, &quot;on the subject of Reconstruction, then, Mr. Stevens must be deemed the Evil Genius of the Republican Party. The [Franklin, Louisiana] &quot;Planter&#x27;s Banner&quot; exulted, &quot;The prayers of the righteous have at last removed the Congressional curse! May... the fires of his new furnace never go out!&quot;
Stevens&#x27;s body was conveyed from his house to the Capitol by white and black pallbearers together. Thousands of mourners, of both races, filed past his casket as he lay in state at the United States Capitol rotunda; Stevens was the third man, after Clay and Lincoln, to receive that honor. African-American soldiers constituted the guard of honor. After a service there, his body was taken by funeral train to Lancaster, a city draped in black for the funeral. Stevens was laid to rest in Shreiner&#x27;s Cemetery (today the Shreiner-Concord Cemetery); it allowed the burial of people of all races, although, at the time of Stevens&#x27;s interment, only one African-American was buried there. The people of his district posthumously renominated him to Congress. They elected his former student Oliver J. Dickey to succeed him. When Congress convened in December 1868, there were several speeches in tribute to Stevens; they were afterward collected in book form.

==Personal life==

Stevens never married, though there were rumors about his twenty-year relationship (1848–1868) with his widowed housekeeper, Lydia Hamilton Smith (1813–1884). She was a light-skinned African American; her husband Jacob and at least one of her sons were much darker than she was.
It is uncertain if the Stevens-Smith relationship was romantic. The Democratic press, especially in the South, assumed so, and when he brought Smith to Washington in 1859, she managed his household, which did nothing to stop their insinuations. In the one brief surviving letter from Stevens to her, Stevens addresses her as &quot;Mrs. Lydia Smith&quot;. Stevens insisted that his nieces and nephews refer to her as &quot;Mrs. Smith&quot;, despite deference towards an African-American servant being almost unheard of at that time. They do so in surviving letters, warmly, asking Stevens to see that she comes with him next time he visits.

As evidence that their relationship was sexual, Brodie pointed to an 1868 letter in which Stevens compares himself to Vice President Richard M. Johnson, who lived openly with a series of African-American slave mistresses. Johnson was elected even though this became known during the 1836 presidential campaign of Martin Van Buren, a fact that Stevens notes. Stevens also expresses his bitterness about his own inability to gain election by the legislature to the Senate, or to secure a Cabinet position.

When Stevens died, Smith was at his bedside, along with his friend Simon Stevens, nephew Thaddeus Stevens Jr., two Catholic nuns, and several other individuals. Stevens was baptized a Catholic by one of the nuns on his deathbed.

Under Stevens&#x27;s will, Smith was allowed to choose between a lump sum of $5,000 or a $500 annual allowance; she could also take any furniture in his house. With the inheritance, she purchased Stevens&#x27;s house, where she had lived for many years. A Catholic, she chose to be buried in a Catholic cemetery, not near Stevens, although she left money for the upkeep of his grave.

Stevens had taken custody of his two young nephews, Thaddeus (often called &quot;Thaddeus Jr.&quot;) and Alanson Joshua Stevens, after their parents died in Vermont. Alanson was sent to work at Stevens&#x27;s business, Caledonia Forge; Thaddeus Jr. was expelled from Dartmouth College, though he subsequently graduated and was taken into his uncle&#x27;s law practice. Alanson during the Civil War rose to be commanding captain of a Pennsylvania Volunteers field artillery unit and was killed in action at Chickamauga. After Alanson&#x27;s death, his uncle used his influence to have Thaddeus Jr. made provost marshal of Lancaster.
Buildings associated with Stevens and with Smith in Lancaster are being renovated by the local historical society, LancasterHistory.org. In his will, Stevens made several bequests, with much of his estate to his nephew Thaddeus Jr., on condition that he refrain from alcohol. If he did not, that bequest would establish an orphanage in Lancaster open to all races and nationalities without discrimination. A legal fight over his estate ensued, and it was not until 1894 that the courts settled the matter, awarding $50,000 (~$ in ) to found the orphanage. The school today is the Thaddeus Stevens College of Technology, in Lancaster.

Schools named after Stevens include Thaddeus Stevens Elementary School in Washington, D.C., founded in 1868 as the first school built for African-American children there. It was segregated for the first 86 years of its existence. In 1977, Amy Carter, daughter of President Jimmy Carter, a Georgian, was enrolled there, the first child of a sitting president to attend public school in almost 70 years.

==Historical and popular view==

As Stevens&#x27; biographer Richard N. Current put it, &quot;to find out what really made the man go, the historian would need the combined aid of two experts from outside the professiona psychoanalyst and a spiritualist.&quot; The historical view of Thaddeus Stevens has fluctuated widely since his death, generally in a manner inverse to that of Andrew Johnson. Early biographical works on Stevens were composed by men who knew him and reflected their viewpoints. Biographies at the turn of the twentieth century, such as those by Samuel McCall in 1899 and by James Albert Woodburn in 1913, presented Stevens favorably, as a sincere man, motivated by principle. Early African-American historian W. E. B. Du Bois called Stevens &quot;a leader of the common people&quot; and &quot;a stern believer in democracy, both in politics and in industry.&quot; Pulitzer Prize-winning historian James Ford Rhodes argued that though Stevens had a &quot;profound sympathy&quot; towards the African-American, &quot;coming straight from the heart,&quot; he also showed &quot;virulence toward the South&quot; and was &quot;bitter and vindictive.&quot; This view of a vengeful Stevens originated during Reconstruction and persisted well into the 20th century.
With the advent of the Dunning School&#x27;s view of Reconstruction after 1900, Stevens continued to be viewed negatively and generally as motivated by hatred. These historians, led by William Dunning, taught that Reconstruction had been an opportunity for radical politicians, motivated by ill will towards the South, to destroy what little of southern life and dignity the war had left. Dunning himself deemed Stevens &quot;truculent, vindictive, and cynical&quot;. Lloyd Paul Stryker, who wrote a highly favorable 1929 biography of Johnson, labeled Stevens as a &quot;horrible old man... craftily preparing to strangle the bleeding, broken body of the South&quot; and who thought it would be &quot;a beautiful thing&quot; to see &quot;the white men, especially the white women of the South, writhing under negro domination&quot;. In 1915, D. W. Griffith&#x27;s film &quot;The Birth of a Nation&quot; (based on the 1905 novel &quot;The Clansman&quot;, by Thomas Dixon Jr.) was released, containing the influenceable and ill-advised Congressman Austin Stoneman, who resembles Stevens down to the ill-fitting wig, limp, and African-American lover, Lydia Brown. This popular treatment reinforced and reinvigorated public prejudices towards Stevens. According to Foner, &quot;as historians exalted the magnanimity of Lincoln and Andrew Johnson, Stevens came to symbolize Northern malice, revenge, and irrational hatred of the South.&quot; The highly popular historian James Truslow Adams described Stevens as &quot;perhaps the most despicable, malevolent, and morally deformed character who has ever risen to high power in America&quot;.

Historians who penned biographies of Stevens in the late 1930s sought to move away from this perspective, seeking to rehabilitate him and his political career. Thomas F. Woodley, writing in 1937, shows admiration of Stevens, but he attributed Stevens&#x27;s driving force to bitterness over his clubfoot. In his 1939 biography, Alphonse Miller found that the former congressman was motivated by a desire for justice. Both men were convinced that recent books had not treated him fairly. Richard Current&#x27;s 1942 work reflected current Beardian historiography, which saw all American history, including Reconstruction, as a three-way economic struggle between the industrialists of the Northeast (represented by Stevens), the planters of the South, and the farmers of the Midwest. Current argued that Stevens was motivated in his Reconstruction policies by frustrated ambitions and a desire to use his political position to promote industrial capitalism and advance the Republican Party. He concluded that despite Stevens&#x27;s egalitarian beliefs, he promoted inequality, for &quot;none had done more than he to bring on the age of Big Business, with its concentration of wealth.&quot;

With Ralph Korngold&#x27;s 1955 biography of Stevens, the neoabolitionist school of historians began to consider the former congressman. These professors rejected the earlier view that those who had gone South to aid the African-Americans after the war were &quot;rapscallion carpetbaggers&quot; defeated by &quot;saintly redeemers.&quot; Instead, they applauded those who had sought to end slavery and forward civil rights and castigated Johnson for obstructionism. They believed that the African-American was central to Reconstruction, and the only things wrong with the congressional program were that it did not go far enough and that it stopped too soon. Brodie&#x27;s 1959 biography of Stevens was of this school. Controversial in its conclusions for being a psychobiography, it found that Stevens was a &quot;consummate underdog who identified with the oppressed&quot; and whose intelligence won him success, while his consciousness of his clubfoot stunted his social development. According to Brodie, this also made him unwilling to marry a woman of his social standing.

Scholars who followed Brodie continued to chip away at the idea of Stevens as a vindictive dictator who dominated Congress to get his way. In 1960, Eric McKitrick deemed Stevens &quot;a picturesque and adroit politician, but a very limited one,&quot; whose career was &quot;a long comic sequence of devilish schemes which, one after another, kept blowing up in his face.&quot; From the mid-1970s onward, Foner argued that Stevens&#x27;s role was in staking out a radical position, though events, not Stevens, caused the Republicans to support him. Michael Les Benedict in 1974 suggested that Stevens&#x27;s reputation as a dictator was based more on his personality than on his influence. In 1989, Allan Bogue found that as chairman of Ways and Means, Stevens was &quot;less than complete master&quot; of his committee.

Historian Hans Trefousse stated in a 1969 study of the Radical Republicans that Stevens&#x27;s &quot;one abiding passion was equality&quot;. In 1991, he noted that Stevens &quot;was one of the most influential representatives ever to serve in Congress. [He dominated] the House with his wit, knowledge of parliamentary law, and sheer willpower, even though he was often unable to prevail.&quot; In his 1997 biography of Stevens, though, he took a position similar to McKitrick&#x27;s: that Stevens was a relatively marginal figure, with his influence often limited by his extremism. Trefousse believed Brodie went too farin deeming Stevens&#x27;s clubfoot responsible for so much about him and in giving full credence to the Stevens-Smith relationshipboth those things cannot now be determined with certainty.

Stevens was celebrated for his wit and sarcasm. When Lincoln appointed rival Pennsylvania Republican leader Simon Cameron as Secretary of War, Stevens expressed disgust at Cameron&#x27;s reputed corruption. Asked whether Cameron was a thief, Stevens supposedly replied, &quot;I don&#x27;t think he would steal a red-hot stove.&quot; When Cameron objected to this characterization, Stevens said &quot;I believe I told you he would not steal a red hot stove. I will now take that back.&quot; Stevens&#x27;s ill-fitting wigs were a well-known topic of discussion in Washington, but when a female admirer who apparently did not know asked for a lock of Stevens&#x27;s hair as a keepsake, he removed his hairpiece, held it out to her, and &quot;invited her to help herself.&quot;

Steven Spielberg&#x27;s 2012 film &quot;Lincoln&quot;, in which Stevens was portrayed by Tommy Lee Jones, brought new public interest in Stevens. Jones&#x27;s character is portrayed as the central figure among the radicals, responsible in large part for the passage of the Thirteenth Amendment. Historian Matthew Pinsker notes that Stevens is referred to only four times in Doris Kearns Goodwin&#x27;s 2005 book &quot;Team of Rivals&quot;, on which screenwriter Tony Kushner based the film&#x27;s screenplay; other radicals were folded into the character. Stevens is depicted as unable to moderate his views for the sake of gaining passage of the amendment until after he is urged to do so by the ever-compromising Lincoln. According to Aaron Bady in his article about the film and how it portrays the radicals, &quot;he&#x27;s the uncle everyone is embarrassed of, even if they love him too much to say so. He&#x27;s not a leader, he&#x27;s a liability, one whose shining heroic moment will be when he keeps silent about what he really believes.&quot; The film depicts a Stevens-Smith sexual relationship; Pinsker comments that &quot;it may well have been true that they were lovers, but by injecting this issue into the movie, the filmmakers risk leaving the impression for some viewers that the &#x27;secret&#x27; reason for Stevens&#x27;s egalitarianism was his desire to legitimize his romance across racial lines.&quot;

On April 2, 2022, in front of the Adams County Courthouse in Gettysburg, Pennsylvania, a statue of Stevens was unveiled as part of a celebration of Stevens&#x27; 230th birthday. The statue was commissioned by the Thaddeus Stevens Society and was sculpted by multidisciplinary artist Alex Paul Loza.

<doc id="365608" wikidata="Q16258079" url="?curid=365608" title="Sheriff of Nottingham (position)">
<text>The Sheriff of Nottingham was historically the office responsible for enforcing law and order in Nottingham and bringing criminals to justice. For years the post has been directly appointed by the Lord Mayor of Nottingham and in modern times, with the existence of the police force, the position is entirely ceremonial and sustained to boost tourism due to the legendary connection with the fictional Sheriff of Nottingham in the tales of Robin Hood. However, the historical position goes back to Anglo-Saxon times. The office is sometimes confused with that of the High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire (that office had previously existed, from 1068 until 1568, as Sheriff of Nottinghamshire, Derbyshire and the Royal Forests).

==History==
Responsibility for enforcing the law and keeping the peace in Anglo-Saxon England fell to the sheriff or shire-reeve (which is a contraction of the Old English word for county and reeve or greave). Different types of reeves attested before the Conquest include the high-reeve, town-reeve, port-reeve, shire-reeve (predecessor to the sheriff), reeve of the hundred and the reeve in charge of a manor, its post-conquest meaning. England in the early 11th century employed the services of shire reeves to assist in the detection and prevention of crimes. Groups of 10 families or &quot;tithings&quot; under a hundredman (later constable) could call upon them. The reeve of an entire shire was a shire-reeve, predecessor to the sheriff.

After the Norman Conquest, specific counties appointed sheriffs to enforce the law (such as Yorkshire for example), although sometimes the duties of these sheriffs would cross the border of their respective counties. Nottingham would have come under the &quot;High Sheriff of Nottinghamshire and Derbyshire&quot; after the Norman Conquest.

The Sheriff during the reign of King John was Philip Marc. Marc was so unpopular that he was specifically mentioned in the Magna Carta, which demanded his removal.

===The first Sheriffs of Nottingham===
In 1449, the city of Nottingham itself appointed its own sheriff for the first time. However, the post was held simultaneously between two men, William Sadler and Thomas Lyng. The sheriffs at that time may have been responsible for &quot;the delivery of prisoners to the courts, the collection of rents and taxes and generally keeping the &#x27;King&#x27;s Peace&#x27;&quot;.

The position of Sheriff of Nottingham began to become a key feature in the tales and legends of Robin Hood from the 14th century onwards. While the position in the tales was seen as fictional and as a caricature, it was indicative of the potential for power to abused and corrupted in the medieval period.

From 1450 until 1835, the office was shared between two people, one of whom may have been chosen by the Mayor, the other by the town council. The reversion to a single sheriff was explained by the mayor and aldermen of Lincoln as &quot;Local Government changes&quot; (possibly the Municipal Corporations Act 1835).

===Past sheriffs===
The office is considered largely ceremonial, expected to attend local events when the monarch is present and promoting the city in tourism and business. There are interviews with Joan Casson, John Hartshorne and Leon Unczur all recent sheriffs, describing the role of the present-day Sheriff of Nottingham. The first female sheriff was appointed in 1931.

<text>DIC Entertainment Corporation (; also known as DIC Audiovisuel, DIC Enterprises, DIC Animation City, DIC Entertainment, L.P., and DIC Productions, sometimes stylized as DİC), branded as the Incredible World of DIC, was an international film and television production company that was mostly associated as an animation studio. As a former division of The Walt Disney Company, DIC produced live-action feature films and licensed numerous anime series.

In 2008, DIC was acquired by Cookie Jar Group in June and was later folded into Cookie Jar in December. As of 2023, most of the DIC library is currently owned by WildBrain (formerly DHX Media) after the company acquired Cookie Jar in October 2012.

==History==
===1971–1982: DIC Audiovisuel===
Diffusion, Information Communications (DIC) was founded in France in 1971 by Jean Chalopin as part of the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Télédiffusion (now RTL Group), a well-established media company. DIC primarily focused on producing television content.

In 1981, DIC formed a partnership with Tokyo Movie Shinsha, a Japanese animation studio. As part of this collaboration, DIC assisted in animating several TMS programs, including the popular series &quot;Ulysses 31&quot;. Additionally, DIC created an unaired pilot called &quot;Lupin VIII&quot; during this period.

This partnership between DIC and TMS continued until 1996, contributing to the production of numerous animated television shows and pilots.

===1982–1986: U.S.===
DIC Audiovisuel&#x27;s U.S. division, DIC Enterprises, was established in April 1982 in Burbank, California by Andy Heyward, a former writer at Hanna-Barbera. This division was created to adapt DIC productions into English for American audiences. DIC Enterprises focused on producing animated television content for both network broadcast and syndication. To reduce costs, DIC outsourced non-creative tasks overseas and employed staff on a per-program basis. Despite its success, some industry insiders referred to DIC as &quot;Do It Cheap.&quot;

Under the direction of Bruno Bianchi and Bernard Deyriès, DIC became known for its effective yet cost-conscious approach to animation production. Shortly after its formation, DIC introduced &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;, which became one of its most successful productions. DIC also collaborated with toy and greeting card companies to develop character-based product lines that could be adapted into animated series, providing built-in advertisers and financial backers. With hits like &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;, &quot;The Littles&quot;, and &quot;Heathcliff&quot;, DIC became profitable.

In 1983, DIC established its own animation facility in Japan, known as K.K. DIC Asia, to handle animation production for its shows independently. Despite facing a unionization effort in 1984, DIC remained the only non-union animation firm. Over time, DIC expanded its operations through syndication deals with companies like LBS Communications, Columbia Pictures Television, and Access Syndication. Additionally, DIC secured home video rights for its shows through agreements with Karl-Lorimar Home Video, CBS/Fox Video in the US, and The Video Collection in Great Britain. and Access Syndication.

===1987–1993: Move to North America===
Between late 1986 and 1987, Heyward, in collaboration with investors Bear Stearns &amp; Co. and Prudential Insurance Co., acquired Chalopin and the Compagnie Luxembourgeoise de Télédiffusion&#x27;s 52% stake in DIC, resulting in the transformation of DIC into DIC Animation City, Inc. This acquisition, amounting to $70 million in a leveraged buyout, relocated the company&#x27;s headquarters to the United States. Following the transaction, key personnel such as Chalopin, Bianchi, Deyriès, and producer Tetsuo Katayama departed DIC, making way for Robby London and Michael Maliani to assume pivotal roles within the organization. Additionally, Chalopin retained control of DIC&#x27;s original offices in France and its Japanese animation facility, establishing the entity Créativité et Développement (C&amp;D) in 1987 to continue producing animated content. Meanwhile, the Japanese studio was renamed K.K. C&amp;D Asia, operating until 1996.

Subsequent to the buyout, DIC encountered significant financial indebtedness, partly stemming from their competitive strategy of underbidding on projects to outmaneuver rival animation firms, coupled with an overestimation of the market demand for children&#x27;s television shows. Consequently, DIC&#x27;s debt escalated, prompting the sale of foreign rights to their library to Saban Productions in 1987, which were later transferred to Chalopin&#x27;s C&amp;D. This transaction strained the relationship between DIC and Saban, leading to legal disputes culminating in a settlement in 1991. Despite these challenges, DIC expanded its collaborations, partnering with NBC and Coca-Cola Telecommunications to produce and distribute television programs. DIC also ventured into toy manufacturing with the introduction of the Old MacDonald talking toyline.

Amidst legal battles and strategic maneuvers, DIC continued to navigate the evolving landscape of the animation industry. Legal disputes with Family Home Entertainment and LBS/Lorimar Home Video were resolved, paving the way for DIC to forge partnerships with Golden Book Video and pursue distribution agreements with Bohbot Communications. Furthermore, DIC diversified its international collaborations, teaming up with Reteitalia, S.p.A. and Telecinco, among others, to co-produce animated content. By the early 1990s, DIC expanded its operations to include subsidiaries such as Rainforest Entertainment and embarked on educational initiatives.

DIC&#x27;s growth trajectory was marked by a landmark licensing agreement with Buena Vista Home Video in 1993, facilitating the distribution of over 1,000 half-hours of animated content and the establishment of a dedicated home video label. This deal bolstered DIC&#x27;s presence in the home entertainment market, heralding a new phase of expansion and consolidation within the animation industry. DIC subsequently signed a deal with Golden Book Video to market titles under the DIC Video brand.

=== 1993–2000: Limited partnerships===
During the early 1990s, DIC attracted attention within the industry. The company engaged in discussions regarding a potential merger and buyout with PolyGram and Capital Cities/ABC, but no agreements materialized with either entity.

In July 1993, DIC Animation City began the establishment of a limited partnership with Capital Cities/ABC Video Enterprises, Inc., forming a joint venture named DIC Entertainment, L.P. This venture aimed to oversee DIC&#x27;s production library and supply content for international distribution through CAVE. DIC Animation City held 95% of the shares, while CAVE held the remaining 5%. At the end of the year, the two companies formed another Delaware limited partnership called DIC Productions, L.P., with Capital Cities/ABC holding a 95% majority stake and Heyward retaining the remaining 5%. Both limited partnerships became the successor to the former parent company DIC Animation City, coinciding with the relocation of DIC&#x27;s headquarters to a larger facility in Burbank, California.

DIC continued its expansion and diversification efforts throughout the early 1990s. In November 1993, it established DIC Interactive, a multimedia unit. Subsequently, the company ventured into live-action television production in 1994. In response to the success of Saban&#x27;s &quot;Mighty Morphin&#x27; Power Rangers&quot;, DIC collaborated with Tsuburaya Productions to adapt the Japanese series &quot;Gridman the Hyper Agent&quot; into &quot;Superhuman Samurai Syber Squad&quot;. DIC also initiated partnerships in China and engaged in syndication agreements with SeaGull Entertainment.

In July 1995, The Walt Disney Company announced its intention to acquire Capital Cities/ABC and all of its assets, including DIC. That October, DIC began planning to establish an animation studio in France in partnership with Hamster Productions. Following the completion of the merger between Capital Cities/ABC and Disney in January 1996, DIC became a subsidiary of The Walt Disney Company. Subsequently, DIC collaborated closely with Disney, launching DIC Films and signing a first-look deal with Walt Disney Pictures in 1996.&lt;ref name=&quot;Disney acquisition of Capital Cities/ABC Inc.&quot;&gt;&lt;/ref&gt;

In March 1997, DIC&#x27;s French animation studio commenced operations as Les Studios Tex S.A.R.L. DIC continued its expansion into various markets and mediums, extending its first-look deal with Walt Disney Pictures in March 1998 and announcing the launch of its direct-to-video division in April 1998. Additionally, DIC secured a programming agreement with Pax TV during this period.

=== 2000–2004: Return to independence ===
In September 2000, Andy Heyward, backed by investment firms Bain Capital and Chase Capital Partners, began to purchase DIC from The Walt Disney Company. Disney agreed to sell back the company and the deal was closed on November 25, officially allowing DIC to produce shows alone again without the limitations of Disney, coinciding with the relaunch of DIC&#x27;s international sales division at MIPCOM that year.

In 2001, DIC planned to return to the home video market, by forming a new division titled DIC Home Entertainment; they intended to begin releasing products starting that May. This was delayed due to DIC&#x27;s issues in finding a distribution partner, which eventually happened in July when DIC signed a deal with Lions Gate Home Entertainment for North American distribution of DIC Home Entertainment products. In June, DIC planned a purchase of Golden Books Family Entertainment for $170 million, but they eventually backed out of the deal due to the high costs of the purchase; the company was instead co-purchased by Random House for the book rights and Classic Media for the entertainment rights.

In July 2002, DIC purchased the Mommy &amp; Me preschool label.

In January 2003, DIC announced three syndicated children&#x27;s programming E/I blocks called DIC Kids Network. In April, DIC sued Speed Racer Enterprises, alleging that SRE had sub-licensed the worldwide exploitation rights for &quot;Speed Racer&quot; to DIC the previous year and then ended the agreement without DIC knowing. Later in July, DIC signed a television production deal with POW! Entertainment for &quot;Stan Lee&#x27;s Secret Super Six&quot;, a series about teens with alien superpowers who are taught about humanity by Lee (this show never made it to air).

===2004–2008: Going public and final years===
In 2004, Heyward acquired Bain Capital&#x27;s share in DIC Entertainment and subsequently oversaw the company&#x27;s public offering on the London Stock Exchange&#x27;s Alternative Investment Market in 2005, trading under the symbol DEKEq.L. In March 2006, DIC regained international rights to 20 of its shows from The Walt Disney Company and Jetix Europe, previously owned by Disney since their acquisition of Saban Entertainment in 2001. The same month, DIC acquired the Copyright Promotions Licensing Group (CPLG) and welcomed Jeffrey Edell as president and COO.
DIC, AOL&#x27;s KOL, and CBS Corporation joined forces to introduce a new three-hour programming block for Saturday mornings on CBS called KOL Secret Slumber Party on September 15, 2006. A year later, on September 15, 2007, DIC, CBS, and American Greetings launched another programming block named KEWLopolis.

In April 2007, DIC Entertainment, Nelvana, and NBC Universal Global Networks announced the establishment of KidsCo, an international children&#x27;s entertainment network. In October of the same year, DIC filed a lawsuit against the Dam company, alleging fraud and negligent misrepresentation regarding Dam&#x27;s troll doll and DIC&#x27;s &quot;Trollz&quot; television series, which was created under a license from Dam. Dam counter-sued DIC, accusing the company of misrepresenting its financial status and harming the troll doll&#x27;s image and reputation.

===2008–2012: Cookie Jar Group merger and DHX Media===
In June 2008, DIC Entertainment and Canadian media company Cookie Jar Group announced a merger valued at $87.6 million. President Jeffrey Edell played a key role in finalizing the deal, which was completed on July 23 of the same year. Following the merger, DIC became a subsidiary of Cookie Jar, and the company was subsequently folded into Cookie Jar&#x27;s operations. DIC Entertainment Corporation was rebranded as Cookie Jar Entertainment (USA) Inc. In 2012, Cookie Jar was acquired by DHX Media, later rebranded as DHX Media on October 22, 2012.

The DIC Kids Network was renamed Cookie Jar Kids Network in 2009 and ceased operations in 2011. Cookie Jar also produced the final season of &quot;Sushi Pack&quot;, one of DIC&#x27;s last shows, which aired until 2009. KEWLopolis on CBS was renamed Cookie Jar TV in 2009 and closed down in 2013, replaced by CBS Dream Team. Cookie Jar Toons, a block on This TV featuring shows from Cookie Jar and DIC, ran from 2008 to 2013. In 2014, Cookie Jar ceased operations.

==Programming blocks==
DIC operated many programming blocks for various television stations across the United States.

===Kideo TV===

Kideo TV was an anthology series that was produced as a joint-venture between DIC Enterprises and their US syndicator LBS Communications, with Mattel handling sponsorships. The block aired on syndicated television stations, with Metromedia stations agreeing to carry the block by January 1986, and launched in April 1986.

Kideo TV aired for 90 minutes and consisted of live-action material with three cartoons from DIC&#x27;s library used as framing material. &quot;Rainbow Brite&quot;, &quot;Popples&quot; and &quot;Ulysses 31&quot; first aired on the block, while &quot;The Get Along Gang&quot; and &quot;Lady Lovely Locks&quot; were added later on.

The &quot;Kideo&quot; brand was also used by LBS as a joint-venture home video line which released various DIC cartoons on VHS.

===Weekend Funday===
Weekend Funday was a 90-minute weekend strand produced by DIC that was syndicated through Coca-Cola Telecommunications during the Fall of 1987. Weekend Funday normally ran on Sundays under the name of &quot;Funday Sunday&quot;, but it would also run on Saturdays as &quot;Funtastic Saturday&quot;, if it wanted to go head-to-head with the other kidvid blocks.

It consisted of various half-hour cartoons from the DIC lineup, including &quot;Sylvanian Families&quot; and &quot;&quot;.

===Funtown===
Funtown was a daily children&#x27;s programming block on the CBN Family Channel that launched on September 11, 1989. It ran for 26 hours a week, broadcasting from 7:00am–9:00am on weekdays, and 8:00am–11:00am and 4:00pm–6:00pm on weekends. DIC handled the advertising sales of the block, while the CBN Family Channel handled the distribution and marketing.

The lineup of shows was a mix of formats, from live-action-animated hybrids to live-action, and programs ranging from original to off-network shows, whether produced by DIC or other companies. In addition, a companion club program was supposed to be developed. DIC also planned to produce four specials each quarter with the launching of Funtown, combined with the others, mostly holiday specials, for the fourth quarter of 1989, but nothing came out of these initial plans.

===Dragon Club===
Dragon Club (Chinese: 小神龙俱乐部 ()) was a daily television strand operated and distributed through Capital Cities/ABC through various syndicated television stations in China. It launched on September 19, 1994, and broadcast various DIC and ABC programs in addition to third-party, live-action and local offerings.

After the Disney purchase of Capital Cities/ABC, the strand transitioned to airing Disney-produced content and continued to broadcast until the start of 2019.

====Panda Club====
Panda Club (Chinese: 熊猫俱乐部) was the short-lived sister strand of &quot;Dragon Club&quot; that launched on October 2, 1994, and broadcast on a smaller selection of stations. Its programming was similar to that of Dragon Club, and broadcast until 1999.

===Freddy&#x27;s Firehouse===
Freddy&#x27;s Firehouse (FFH) was a planned children&#x27;s educational programming block that would broadcast various programs from DIC Entertainment&#x27;s library, initially announced in May 1998. In the United States, it was planned to air on Pax TV after DIC signed a deal with the broadcaster to become the exclusive supplier of animated programming on the network. The plan was for the block to run on weekends, running for three hours on Saturday and two hours on Sunday. Buena Vista International Television handled syndication sales, and would also allow for the strand to be sold to other outlets internationally.

The block was rejected in favor of Pax producing the children&#x27;s block in-house, with &quot;Cloud 9&quot; (later renamed &quot;Pax Kids&quot;) launching with Pax TV on August 31, 1998, and broadcasting until the end of the contract with DIC in 2000.

<text>Inspector Gadget Saves Christmas is a Christmas television special, featuring characters from the animated series &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;. The special was produced by DIC Animation City, and aired on NBC on December 4, 1992. The special serves as a series finale for the original TV series.

== Synopsis ==
At the North Pole, Santa Claus and his elves are working on all the toys that Santa will deliver at Christmas. Doctor Claw has managed to sneak into the factory and disguise himself as Santa. He has also managed to install mind-control devices on all the elves, which he then activates, and orders them to capture Santa. His plan is to use the mind-controlled elves to make defective toys, for which the world will blame Santa. Meanwhile, he orders his MAD agents to destroy Gadget. Several attempts are made in the opening credits, all of which fail.

Meanwhile, Gadget has been going around with his Christmas doings, oblivious to the MAD agents attempting to do him in. Later, he visits the local mall Santa, actually Chief Quimby in disguise. The Chief gives Gadget a self-destructing note containing his mission.

Gadget, along with Penny and Brain, heads off to the North Pole, taking with him the assumption that Doctor Claw has not made his move yet. Upon entering the factory, Gadget believes there is nothing wrong. He does not get suspicious when he is staring the disguised Doctor Claw in the face. Penny and Brain, on the other hand, are not fooled. But when they try to tell Gadget about it, he is sideswiped by a claw from the factory and thrown onto the conveyor belt with all the bad toys the elves are manufacturing where Gadget sings a parody of &quot;The Twelve Days of Christmas&quot; using the things he winds up crashing into. When this does not finish him off (thanks to Brain), Claw instead has Gadget dropped down the manhole he dropped Santa through at the beginning. There, Gadget comes upon the real Santa Claus, but arrests him, thinking this Santa is the fraud.

Meanwhile, Penny is snooping around the whole factory and hides in a giant jack-in-the-box. Penny sees the elves destroying the toys. Penny calls Brain to tell him that Doctor Claw plans to ruin Christmas. Brain then reports that the elves tried to eliminate Gadget, he found the real Santa and accused him of being Doctor Claw. However, the elves find Penny and trap her in the jack-in-the-box. Penny calls Brain to tell him that she will escape somehow and he has to save Gadget.

Brain manages to snatch the keys away from Doctor Claw and open the cell where Gadget has been interrogating Santa using lines of &quot;The Night Before Christmas&quot; for reference. Gadget mistakes Brain for &quot;the fake Santa&#x27;s&quot; accomplice, lassos the both of them and heads off to tell &quot;the real Santa&quot; he has caught the criminals. Meanwhile, Penny uses her computer book to find out how the elves are being mind controlled. Penny manages to escape and she finds herself in a place where Doctor Claw hidden Santa&#x27;s real toys.

As Gadget helps the disguised Doctor Claw load the broken toys onto the sleigh, Brain springs himself and the real Santa loose, and then follows Penny to the control room that Doctor Claw has left vacant. Penny deactivates the mind control on the elves, but Doctor Claw quickly gets into his jet and prepares to take off with the sleigh full of broken toys. But the real Santa shows up with his reindeer and foils him by unhooking the sleigh from the MAD Jet. Then for good measure, Gadget, still not realizing he has been helping Doctor Claw, ties the hook to a candy cane prop. Then the reindeer break up the ice behind the MAD Jet, sending him drifting into the distance. After the Chief makes an appearance to congratulate Gadget and company for saving Christmas, Santa gives them a ride in his sleigh.

<doc id="365627" wikidata="Q1147532" url="?curid=365627" title="Missing square puzzle">
<text>The missing square puzzle is an optical illusion used in mathematics classes to help students reason about geometrical figures; or rather to teach them not to reason using figures, but to use only textual descriptions and the axioms of geometry. It depicts two arrangements made of similar shapes in slightly different configurations. Each apparently forms a 13×5 right-angled triangle, but one has a 1×1 hole in it.

==Solution==

The key to the puzzle is the fact that neither of the 13×5 &quot;triangles&quot; is truly a triangle, nor would either truly be 13x5 if it were, because what appears to be the hypotenuse is bent. In other words, the &quot;hypotenuse&quot; does not maintain a consistent slope, even though it may appear that way to the human eye. 
A true 13×5 triangle cannot be created from the given component parts. The four figures (the yellow, red, blue and green shapes) total 32 units of area. The apparent triangles formed from the figures are 13 units wide and 5 units tall, so it appears that the area should be &quot;S&quot; = = 32.5 units. However, the blue triangle has a ratio of 5:2 (=2.5), while the red triangle has the ratio 8:3 (≈2.667), so the apparent combined hypotenuse in each figure is actually bent. With the bent hypotenuse, the first figure actually occupies a combined 32 units, while the second figure occupies 33, including the &quot;missing&quot; square.

The amount of bending is approximately unit (1.245364267°), which is difficult to see on the diagram of the puzzle, and was illustrated as a graphic. Note the grid point where the red and blue triangles in the lower image meet (5 squares to the right and two units up from the lower left corner of the combined figure), and compare it to the same point on the other figure; the edge is slightly under the mark in the upper image, but goes through it in the lower. Overlaying the &quot;hypotenuses&quot; from both figures results in a very thin parallelogram (represented with the four red dots in the above image) with an area of exactly one grid square (Pick&#x27;s theorem gives 0&amp;hairsp; + − 1 = 1), which corresponds to the &quot;missing&quot; area.

===Principle===

According to Martin Gardner, this particular puzzle was invented by a New York City amateur magician, Paul Curry, in 1953. However, the principle of a dissection paradox has been known since the start of the 16th century. 

The integer dimensions of the parts of the puzzle (2, 3, 5, 8, 13) are successive Fibonacci numbers, which leads to the exact unit area in the &quot;thin parallelogram&quot;.
Many other geometric dissection puzzles are based on a few simple properties of the Fibonacci sequence.

==Similar puzzles==
Sam Loyd&#x27;s chessboard paradox demonstrates two rearrangements of an 8×8 square. In the &quot;larger&quot; rearrangement (the 5×13 rectangle in the image to the right), the gaps between the figures have a combined unit square more area than their square gaps counterparts, creating an illusion that the figures there take up more space than those in the original square figure. In the &quot;smaller&quot; rearrangement (the shape below the 5×13 rectangle), each quadrilateral needs to overlap the triangle by an area of half a unit for its top/bottom edge to align with a grid line, resulting overall loss in one unit square area.

Mitsunobu Matsuyama&#x27;s &quot;paradox&quot; uses four congruent quadrilaterals and a small square, which form a larger square. When the quadrilaterals are rotated about their centers they fill the space of the small square, although the total area of the figure seems unchanged. The apparent paradox is explained by the fact that the side of the new large square is a little smaller than the original one. If &quot;θ&quot; is the angle between two opposing sides in each quadrilateral, then the ratio of the two areas is given by sec2 &quot;θ&quot;. For &quot;θ&quot; = 5°, this is approximately 1.00765, which corresponds to a difference of about 0.8%.
A vanishing puzzle is a mechanical optical illusion showing different numbers of a certain object when parts of the puzzle are moved around.

<doc id="365628" wikidata="Q7557033" url="?curid=365628" title="Solaris (video game)">
<text>Solaris is a space combat video game for the Atari 2600 published in 1986 by Atari Corporation. The game involves a player seeking out the planet Solaris via their starship. To accomplish this, the player must navigate the galactic scanner to explore quadrants of a map. Doing so allows them to explore Federation planets to refuel their ship, and engage in combat with hostile aliens known as the Zylons. 

The game was programmed by Doug Neubauer, who had previously made &quot;Star Raiders&quot; (1980) for Atari and various film tie-in games for the Atari 2600 for Fox Video Games. Neubauer pitched this game to Atari in 1984, who planned to make it a tie-in to the film &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; (1984). Following Jack Tramiel&#x27;s purchase of Atari in 1984, Atari&#x27;s production of console games was halted. Neubauer was only contacted in 1986 to complete his work on &quot;Solaris&quot; following the release of a new remodeled Atari 2600.

Contemporary and retrospective reviews of &quot;Solaris&quot; have seen critics from AllGame, &quot;Computer Entertainer&quot; and &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; praise it as having some of the best graphics for an Atari 2600 game. Reviewers in &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; called it one best games for the system.

==Gameplay==
In &quot;Solaris&quot;, the goal of the game is to survive battles with enemy aliens called Zylons as they seek out the planet Solaris. The player pilots a starship exploring outer space and visiting the surface of planets. The game contains a map of 16 total quadrants with 48 sectors. It is navigated via the Galactic Scanner map screen, which represents where the player is located within the galaxy. The player can utilize the map to identify sectors they would like to travel to. If the player picks a Zylon-infested sector, they must destroy all the enemy ships, allowing them to return to the map. Other areas feature star clusters, mine fields and traversable wormholes that lead to other quadrants. If the player chooses to travel to a planet, they navigate its surface, allowing them to attack aliens, rescue humans, and dock at refueling stations. 

Federation planets appear with docking stations to refuel the spaceship. If a Federation planet is invaded by Zylons, the player must use their ship to shoot all the aliens and rescue the occupied planet. When Zylons attack a federation planet within the current quadrant, the player has 40 seconds to defend the planet before the aliens successfully occupy it. If the player fails to do so, the Galactic Scanner quadrant will become red. Zylon planets feature stranded space cadets, which can be rescued for bonus points. They also feature corridors protected by Zylon guardians. Once inside a corridor, the player must fly over a key to ensure safe passage through, which will result in the destruction of the planet and additional points.

==Development==
Prior to working on &quot;Solaris&quot;, Doug Neubauer worked at Atari, Inc., where he made the computer game &quot;Star Raiders&quot; (1980), and later as an independent contractor for 20th Century Fox&#x27;s new video game division, making film tie-in games for the Atari 2600. Among the games he developed for Fox were &quot;Alien&quot;, &quot;Mega Force&quot; and &quot;M*A*S*H&quot;. Neubauer hoped that making several film tie-in games would lead to him developing a game based on &quot;Star Wars&quot;. He found later that &quot;just because a company makes a movie doesn&#x27;t mean they have the rights to make a video game of the movie, Case in point, &quot;Star Wars&quot;. They didn&#x27;t have the rights to it.&quot;

Douglas Neubauer pitched &quot;Solaris&quot; to Atari in 1984. The company suggested making it into a video game tie-in for the film &quot;The Last Starfighter&quot; (1984). Atari flew Neubauer to Los Angeles for a screening of the film, but he soon found out that Jack Tramiel had bought the company and most of the staff was laid off. Neubauer described these lay offs as appearing like &quot;the end of video games for Atari.&quot; Upon Tramiel&#x27;s acquisition of the Atari consumer division and launch of the Atari ST computer line, Tramiel began focusing on reviving the Atari 2600. He hired Michael Katz from Epyx in November 1985 to take on the role of president for Atari&#x27;s new Entertainment Electronics Division. The Atari 2600 was experiencing what video game historian Brett Weiss described as &quot;a resurgence of sorts&quot; following the video game company Nintendo&#x27;s financial success with their Nintendo Entertainment System (NES) console. Atari would respond with re-releasing the Atari 2600 as a smaller, budget-priced revision in January 1986. In the same year, Atari would reconnect with Neubauer to revive his game, now titled &quot;Solaris&quot;.

Mike Bevan wrote in &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; that fans of Neubauer&#x27;s game &quot;Star Raiders&quot; (1980) sometimes considered &quot;Solaris&quot; to be the &quot;true successor&quot; to that game. Neubauer responded that the game is not a sequel. &quot;Solaris&quot; was made with 16K of bank-switching ROM and 256 bytes of RAM. Neubauer had his cousin, professional comic artist Randy Emberlin, help him with the graphics for the game. &quot;Solaris&quot; was completed by October 1986. Neubauer said that he gave Atari the &quot;master EPROM&quot; of the game and his engineering notes. He then found himself surprised that his brief write-ups and what he described as his &quot;primitive little sketches&quot; were taken nearly verbatim for the games manual. Neubauer joked decades later in an interview that &quot;apparently Atari was cash-strapped at the time, but so strapped they couldn&#x27;t afford a graphics artist?&quot; The cover art of the game also reused illustrations from the Atari 2600 box art of &quot;Star Raiders&quot; (1982).

==Release==

At the Consumer Electronics Show in June 1986, Atari&#x27;s promotion booth included console games for both the Atari 7800 and Atari 2600 consoles. &quot;Midnight Magic&quot;, &quot;Pac-Man Jr.&quot; and &quot;Solaris&quot; were showcased in playable form at the event and were set to be available to consumers before the end of the 1986. &quot;Solaris&quot; was released for the Atari 2600 in November 1986. In June 1989, &quot;Electronic Gaming Monthly&quot; reported that it was the top-selling available game for either the Atari 2600 or Atari 7800 in the United States during that month.

&quot;Solaris&quot; was re-released in various Atari-themed compilations years later. These included being on the first release of the Atari Flashback series of dedicated consoles in November 2004. It was later released to other devices and software such as the Nintendo Switch, PlayStation 4, Xbox One, and Steam services as part of &quot;Atari 50: The Anniversary Celebration&quot; (2022).

==Reception and legacy==
From contemporary reviews, a reviewer in &quot;The Video Game Update&quot; gave &quot;Solaris&quot; their highest rating of four stars for both graphics and gameplay. The review proclaimed the game was &quot;strong enough to hold its own in an era of game systems far greater capabilities than the modest 2600&quot; and that &quot;Without question &quot;Solaris&quot; is the best space game ever done for this system.&quot; A reviewer in the German magazine &quot;&quot; wrote that &quot;Solaris&quot; surprised them, and while they did not find the gameplay original, they complimented the beautiful and varied graphics, finding it superior to the similarly themed Atari 2600 game &quot;Starmaster&quot; (1982).

From retrospective reviews, several reviewers complimented the graphics as being among the best for the Atari 2600. An anonymous reviewer in the British magazine &quot;Retro Gamer&quot; said that &quot;the real feature of &quot;Solaris&quot; that will make your jaw drop is the visuals. You would have never thought it was possible for the 2600 to display high-res graphics in so many colours.&quot; and that the game was &quot;widely regarded as the console&#x27;s most technically impressive commercial release.&quot; Kieren Hawken, also of &quot;Retro Gamer&quot;, praised the sound, visuals and gameplay depth, stating that &quot;&quot;Solaris&quot; is quite simply the best game for the 2600 bar none.&quot; In the magazine&#x27;s list of the top 25 Atari 2600 games, Stuart Hunt and Darran Jones listed &quot;Solaris&quot;; they noted that, while the gameplay would take some getting used to, the game &quot;can be heralded as one of the finest pieces of code written for the 2600.&quot; Weiss wrote in his book &quot;Classic Home Video Games 1972-1984&quot; that &quot;Solaris&quot; was one of the more ambitious games in the Atari 2600 library in terms of graphics and gameplay, specifically noting the multi-colored enemies, beautifully illustrated planets, and variety of sound effects. Jonathan Sutyak, writing for the online game database AllGame, found the graphics were &quot;the Atari 2600 at its best&quot; but disliked the gameplay. Sutyak found it overtly complicated and concluded that &quot;trying to make sense of everything [in &quot;Solaris&quot;] is not worth your time or effort.&quot;

Following its release, Neubauer went on to make other Atari 2600 games, including &quot;Super Football&quot; and &quot;Radar Lock&quot;. He had attempted to make a space-oriented game for the NES that was never published, saying that &quot;the days of one programmer doing a complete game were over, and by the time I got the game done, the NES was obsolete.&quot; When comparing the game to &quot;Star Raiders&quot;, Neubauer thought the original &quot;Star Raiders&quot; had better game play and preferred its cockpit point of view over &quot;Solaris&quot;. He later summarized his career in video games development, concluding that &quot;the best games I did were the ones I did for fun rather than money. Probably a lesson there.&quot;

<doc id="365630" wikidata="Q2600609" url="?curid=365630" title="Gadget &amp; the Gadgetinis">
<text>Gadget &amp; the Gadgetinis is an animated television series and the sequel of the 1983 series &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;. The series was a co-production between Fox Kids Europe, DIC Entertainment Corporation, French animation studio SIP Animation, French broadcaster M6 Métropole Télévision, the British Channel 5 and the Italian Mediatrade S.p.A. The show was first screened at MIPTV 2002.

&quot;Gadget &amp; the Gadgetinis&quot; is currently a property of WildBrain, which holds the rights to most of DIC&#x27;s library.

==Plot==
Having been recruited by an elite international peacekeeping group called the World Organization of Mega Powers (or WOMP for short), Lieutenant Gadget (promoted from his previous position of Inspector), now fights crime with a pair of mechanical assistants called the Gadgetinis, small robot versions of Gadget who were created by Penny (due to Brain retiring from active duty) and who are the unintended victims of Gadget&#x27;s bumbling.

As a member of WOMP, Lieutenant Gadget and his Gadgetinis still have to tangle with Doctor Claw and his organization M.A.D.

==Characters==

* Lieutenant Gadget (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) – Now working for WOMP as a Lieutenant, Gadget is still the same cyborg he was in the 1983 series, except that he has been upgraded with several new gadgets. He is usually blind to MAD&#x27;s interference in missions or their presence, sometimes making it easier for them to continue with Dr. Claw&#x27;s evil plans, but they are nearly always thwarted, usually by accident. Gadget&#x27;s appearance is somewhat different from his original design, as his hat and coat are now dark grey, his gloves are yellow, his tie and pants are a brighter blue and he looks a lot younger. He also wears green sunglasses in most episodes.
* The Gadgetinis (voiced by Maurice LaMarche) – Fidget (orange) and Digit (blue) are two small robots created by Penny who are miniature versions of Gadget. They frequently aid Gadget on his missions and each one has their own arsenal of hidden gadgets and devices, including video communicators in their chest-pieces. Penny created them after Brain retired due to a nervous breakdown. Fidget is the most easily spooked of the pair. He does things robots cannot do, such as feeling pain or sneeze, which Digit usually questions. Digit is the smarter, sarcastic, and more literal of the Gadgetinis. He often reminds Fidget that he is a robot when Fidget does something that robots can&#x27;t do.
* Penny (voiced by Tegan Moss) – Gadget&#x27;s know-it-all 12-year-old niece is the creator of the Gadgetinis. Instead of secretly following Gadget, she contacts the Gadgetinis to offer advice and information from home. She usually does this from the attic, using her laptop computer and many other hi-tech tools, which replace her computer book and video watch. She also usually corrects Fidget about being a robot when he does something robots can&#x27;t do, is less patient than she was in the original series, and has a bit of a short temper. Penny wears her hair in pigtails as she did in the original 1983 series.

===WOMP===
* General Sir (voiced by Alvin Sanders) – The leader of WOMP, the General assigns missions to Gadget. He is completely oblivious to Gadget&#x27;s incompetence and antics. General Sir favors Gadget over Nozzaire because he&#x27;s kinder than Nozzaire.
** Ms. Miffet – Secretary of General Sir.
* Colonel Nozzaire (voiced by Colin Murdock) – Colonel Nozzaire is a former member of the French Foreign Legion and Gadget&#x27;s new superior. Nozzaire hates Gadget and barely tolerates him, because he is extremely stupid, repeatedly hurts him and/or wrecks his office. Nozzaire constantly tries to partake in missions himself, only to get captured by M.A.D. or become badly injured as a result of Gadget&#x27;s interference or incompetence.

===M.A.D.===
* Dr. Claw (voiced by Brian Drummond) – Unlike the original series, viewers can actually see his legs and torso from time to time, his gauntlets are now gold with black joints and knuckles, and with the M.A.D. logo printed on them. Most of the time instead of banging his hand on his desk and hitting his cat, he scratches the arm of his chair when angered. In addition, he also has a brother named Doctor Thaw and a nephew named William who is Doctor Thaw&#x27;s son.
** MAD Cat (vocal effects provided by Ellen Kennedy and Frank Welker) – Doctor Claw&#x27;s pet cat who now has a chair of his own.
* Maryland Claw (voiced by Teryl Rothery) – Doctor Claw and Doctor Thaw&#x27;s mother and William&#x27;s grandmother. She first met Claw&#x27;s father in jail, the same day Gadget&#x27;s parents met. Maryland has higher authority over her son even going as far as to stop him in his evil deeds. Doctor Claw once had his M.A.D. agents turned invisible so that they could try to rob her house, apparently to get some childhood trophies from her. Like her son, only Maryland&#x27;s right hand is seen. Though in the episode &quot;Erasing Gadget,&quot; her face does appear when Gadget travels back in time.

===Other characters===
* Brain (vocal effects provided by Lee Tockar) – After years of Gadget repeatedly mistaking him for M.A.D. Agents and trying to apprehend him, Brain is now phobic and nervous when he hears Gadget&#x27;s name and has taken refuge in a shack by a lake.
* Chief Quimby – Now he&#x27;s an agent of WOMP working as General Sir&#x27;s top informant of the Cryptic Intelligence Agency (a parody of the real-life Central Intelligence Agency, or CIA). He uses self-destructing messages, much like the previous series.
* Jools &amp; Annie Tamare – Gadget&#x27;s parents and Penny&#x27;s grandparents who first met each other by crashing their bicycles.
* Jeanette Sir – The General&#x27;s daughter whom the lieutenant fell in love with.

== Episodes ==
==Production==
The original creators of &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; reunited for this series. Andy Heyward initiated the concept and was one of the executive producers; Jean Chalopin created/developed the show and wrote or co-wrote every episode; while Bruno Bianchi designed the main characters as well as directing and producing the series. &quot;Gadget &amp; the Gadgetinis&quot; follows basically the same plot as the original series, with the clueless Gadget attempting to fight crime while Penny and her helpers do all the work and he takes full credit for it, when he had no idea what happened. Dr. Claw appears less frequently and there are new villains for the group to contend with. Each episode would be budgeted at approximately $400,000 per episode. Saban was originally intended to distribute internationally &quot;Gadget &amp; the Gadgetinis&quot;. There were also going to be more Gadgetinis as the show would progress.

While Brain and Chief Quimby are mainly absent from the show, they do appear in pictures in Gadget&#x27;s house. Each also appears as a special guest in one episode. Brain appears in episode 36, &quot;No Brainer&quot;, which reveals that, having been traumatized after years of pain while saving Gadget and Gadget mistaking him for M.A.D. Agents, he retired from crime-fighting to live in a riverside house, which only Penny knows about. The mere mention of the word &quot;gadget&quot; is enough to drive him frantic. Brain is also mentioned in the episode, &quot;Roverre&quot;. Chief Quimby appears in episode 45, &quot;Super Boss Gadget&quot;. They both appear on television in the episode, &quot;Too Many Gadgets&quot;.

The French end credits to the series show a series of sketches of Penny going to visit Brain at his riverside home. The pair enjoy an emotional reunion.

Maurice LaMarche continued as Gadget&#x27;s voice, reprising his role from the &quot;Sunday Movie Toon&quot;, &quot;Inspector Gadget&#x27;s Last Case&quot;, as did Brian Drummond (Dr. Claw) and Tegan Moss (Penny).

Jean-Michel Guirao composed the musical underscore, and the main title song for the English-speaking version was written and performed by Mike Piccirillo. However, the European and French theme songs for &quot;Gadgetinis&quot; were explicitly different: The French version&#x27;s theme, composed by Noam Kaniel and David Vadant, sounded very close to Shuki Levy and Haim Saban&#x27;s original &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot; theme, and was in fact based on the original series&#x27; theme song. (The French end credits for the show state: &quot;Musique des génériques: Noam Kaniel, David Vadant, K.I.A. productions. D&#x27;après le &quot;Thème de l&#x27;Inspecteur Gadget&quot;. Musique originale de Haim Saban et Shuki Levy.&quot;) The reason this was possible - even though DiC Entertainment (which owned &quot;Inspector Gadget&quot;) no longer had the rights to Levy and Saban&#x27;s theme music - is probably that &quot;Gadget &amp; the Gadgetinis&quot; was produced primarily by the French animation studio SIP Animation, which at the time of production was owned by Haim Saban.

== Broadcast ==
The show was broadcast across various European countries on Fox Kids starting in late 2002, and remained on some stations after the Jetix rebranding.
*In the United Kingdom, the show aired on Channel 5, who were one of the co-producers. They first aired the show in August 2002, a month before it aired in France on M6.
*In the United States, the show was planned to air on Fox Family; but since Fox Family Worldwide was purchased by Disney, it never did.
*In countries where the channel operated from, it also re-ran on Jetix Play.
*The show was airing in Canada on Family Channel.

==Merchandise==
An event was held at Quick restaurants in France in April 2003.

===Video game===

A video game based on the series, titled &quot;Gadget &amp; Gadgetinis &quot; was released for the PlayStation 2 and PC in November 2004. The game developed by Eko Software and published by Hip Games, who had acquired the Inspector Gadget video game license after acquiring Light &amp; Shadow Production in February of that year. It was first unveiled at E3 2004, following an announcement on May 5, 2004; further, the game was only released in PAL regions, much like with &quot;Mad Robots Invasion&quot;.

The game&#x27;s gameplay was mostly criticized for its unoriginality, as well as the character designs and the music. The controls and the game&#x27;s appeal to children received praise.

<doc id="365634" wikidata="Q5442186" url="?curid=365634" title="Felix Dennis">
<text>Felix Dennis (27 May 194722 June 2014) was an English publisher, poet, spoken-word performer, and philanthropist. His company, Dennis Publishing, pioneered computer and hobbyist magazine publishing in the United Kingdom. In more recent times, the company added lifestyle titles such as its flagship brand &quot;The Week&quot;, which is published in the UK and the United States.

==Early life==
Felix Dennis was born on 27 May 1947 in Kingston-upon-Thames, Surrey, the son of a part-time jazz pianist who ran a tobacconist&#x27;s shop. He grew up poor in northeast Surrey, for a time living in his grandparents&#x27; tiny terrace house in Thames Ditton, not far from his birthplace, with his mother, Dorothy, and brother Julian. A place with &quot;no electricity, no indoor lavatory or bathroom ... no electric light, but gas and candles&quot;.

In 1958, he passed his 11+ exam to enter St Nicholas Grammar School in Northwood Hills, Middlesex. His first band, the Flamingos, was formed with friends at school.

In 2006, Dennis said in an interview with Oliver Marre of &quot;The Observer&quot; newspaper: 

In 1964, Dennis moved into his first bedsit at 13 St Kildas Road, Harrow, earning rent playing in R&amp;B bands and working as a window display artist in department stores. Briefly working as a sign-painter, he also enrolled at Harrow College of Art.

==Career==

===Publishing===
====&quot;OZ&quot;====
In 1967, Dennis began selling copies of the counterculture &quot;OZ&quot; magazine on the streets of London&#x27;s Kings Road. Later, Dennis became a designer and worked with Jon Goodchild, the magazine&#x27;s art director.

In 1969, Dennis wrote a world exclusive for &quot;OZ&quot;, the first ever review of Led Zeppelin&#x27;s debut album. He was quickly promoted to co-editor and became involved in the longest conspiracy trial in English history over the infamous &quot;Schoolkids OZ&quot; issue. While Richard Neville was on holiday, Jim Anderson and Dennis had invited fifth- and sixth-form kids to edit the issue. They included a sexually explicit &quot;Rupert the Bear&quot; cartoon strip, which proved too much for the authorities and resulted in the arrest of Anderson, Neville and Dennis, who were charged with &quot;conspiracy to corrupt public morals&quot;. The &quot;OZ&quot; offices in Princedale Road, Notting Hill, and the homes of its editors were repeatedly raided by Scotland Yard&#x27;s Obscene Publications Squad.

John Lennon recorded the single &quot;God Save Oz&quot; / &quot;Do The Oz&quot; to raise money for a legal defence fund.

At the conclusion of the trial, the &quot;OZ Three&quot;, defended by John Mortimer, were found not guilty on the charge of &quot;Conspiracy to deprave and corrupt the Morals of the Young of the Realm&quot;, but were convicted on two lesser offences and sentenced to imprisonment. Dennis received a more lenient sentence than his co-defendants because he was, in the opinion of the judge, &quot;much less intelligent&quot; and therefore less culpable. These convictions were later quashed on appeal. Dennis later told author Jonathan Green that on the night before the appeal was heard, the &quot;OZ&quot; editors were taken to a secret meeting with the Chief Justice, Lord Widgery, who told them that they would be acquitted if they agreed to give up work on &quot;OZ&quot;. It is alleged that MPs Tony Benn and Michael Foot had interceded on their behalf.

====Underground comix====
In 1973, following acquittal by the Court of Appeal, Dennis went on to found his own magazine publishing company. When &quot;OZ&quot; closed down the following year the &quot;cOZmic&quot; was continued by Dennis and his company, Cozmic Comics/H. Bunch Associates (which published from 1972 to 1975). UK-based cartoonists published by Dennis included Edward Barker, Michael J. Weller, Dave Gibbons, Bryan Talbot, and Brian Bolland.

With the rising popularity of martial arts with the film &quot;Enter the Dragon&quot;, Dennis&#x27;s &quot;Kung-Fu Monthly&quot; became a success just two years after the &quot;OZ&quot; trial, making over £60,000 in its first year. The magazine was published in 17 countries and ran for 13 years.

====Computer magazines====
Dennis was the second publisher of &quot;Personal Computer World&quot; which he later sold to VNU. He established &quot;MacUser&quot;, the worldwide rights of which he sold to Ziff Davis Publishing in the mid-1980s, but Dennis continued to publish the UK publication until its demise in 2015. In 1987, with Peter Godfrey and Bob Bartner, he co-founded MicroWarehouse, a company that pioneered direct IT marketing via high quality catalogues. The computer mail order company eventually went public on the NASDAQ in 1992. At the time it had 3,500 employees in 13 countries with worldwide sales in 2000 of $2.5 billion. It was sold to a private investment group in January 2000. This created the bulk of Dennis&#x27; personal wealth. Dennis also launched the successful UK IT title &quot;Computer Shopper&quot;.

====1990s and 2000s====
In 1995, Dennis Publishing created &quot;Maxim&quot;, a title that began on the back of a beer mat and became the world&#x27;s biggest selling men&#x27;s lifestyle magazine and global brand. In 1996, Dennis acquired a majority stake in what is now Dennis Publishing&#x27;s flagship brand &quot;The Week&quot; which is published in the UK and US and translates to a global circulation of over 700,000 (ABC audited). Over the following years it purchased the remainder of shares from original founder Jolyon Connell and Jeremy O&#x27;Grady. 2003 saw the purchase of IFG Limited (I Feel Good) from &quot;Loaded&quot; founder James Brown. The purchase involved titles &quot;Viz&quot;, &quot;Fortean Times&quot; and &quot;Bizarre&quot; being added to the Dennis Publishing stable.

In June 2007, Dennis sold his US magazine operation, which published the magazines &quot;Blender&quot;, &quot;Maxim&quot; and &quot;Stuff&quot; to Alpha Media Group for a reported US$250 million although exact details were never disclosed.

In 2008, Dennis Publishing established digital magazines &quot;iGizmo&quot;, &quot;iMotor&quot; and &quot;Monkey&quot; along with the purchase of &quot;The First Post&quot; from the Kensington-based First Post Group for an undisclosed sum. The award-winning online magazine which gained a D&amp;AD nomination for viral marketing was headed-up by former &quot;The Daily Telegraph&quot; editor Mark Law and &quot;Evening Standard&quot; editor Nigel Horne. This title later morphed into &quot;The Week&quot;.

In 2013, Dennis was the sole owner of Dennis Publishing, with offices in both London and New York City. At that time, the company held over 50 magazine titles, digital magazines, websites and mobile sites in the UK including &quot;The Week&quot;, &quot;Auto Express&quot;, &quot;PC Pro&quot;, &quot;CarBuyer&quot; and &quot;Viz&quot;. &quot;The Week&quot; continued to be published in the US alongside &quot;Mental Floss&quot; magazine.

===Writing and performance===
In 2001, while at hospital, Dennis wrote his first poem on a post-it note. Within a year, he wrote his first book of verse &quot;A Glass Half Full&quot;, published by Hutchinson in the UK. The launch of this book was accompanied by the first of Dennis&#x27;s UK-wide poetry reading tours entitled &quot;Did I Mention the Free Wine?&quot;. Audiences were offered fine French wine from Dennis&#x27;s personal cellar while watching him perform his poetry on stage. Dennis&#x27;s poetry was featured on radio interviews and in the national press, and was the subject of television documentaries in both the UK and US.

In October 2003, Dennis appeared with the Royal Shakespeare Company (RSC), along with RSC actors, reading from his work at the Swan Theatre, Stratford-upon-Avon. With the second publication of &quot;A Glass Half Full&quot;, by Random House in the US in 2004, Dennis embarked on a 15-date coast-to-coast tour of the US (including another RSC performance in New York). The same year &quot;Lone Wolf&quot;, Dennis&#x27;s second book of verse came out, again accompanied by a 14-date UK tour.

In 2006, Dennis wrote a best-seller on how he became a multi-millionaire in &quot;How to Get Rich&quot;. As well as anecdotes from his life, the book describes his crack cocaine addiction and admission to spending over $100 million on drugs and women.

2010 saw the release of Dennis&#x27;s follow-up to wealth creation book, &quot;88 The Narrow Road&quot;, republished in 2011, as &quot;How To Make Money&quot;.

Five more poetry books followed, &quot;When Jack Sued Jill: Nursery Rhymes for Modern Times&quot;, &quot;Island of Dreams&quot;, &quot;Homeless in my Heart&quot;. and &quot;Tales From The Woods&quot; At the end of 2008, Dennis again toured the UK and Ireland, 12-date tour coinciding with the release of &quot;Homeless in my Heart&quot;.

Both the 2008 and a further 21-date 2010 &quot;Did I Mention the Free Wine?&quot; tour were filmed and the footage used by Endemol for a one-off documentary, &quot;Felix Dennis: Millionaire Poet&quot;. During production in early 2012, Dennis was diagnosed with throat cancer. As a result, production halted while he underwent treatment. During this time, Dennis compiled &quot;Love, Of A Kind&quot;, After his operation and radiotherapy, Dennis gave a TV interview with broadcaster Jon Snow. This was incorporated into the final cut of &quot;Felix Dennis: Millionaire Poet&quot;, aired on Sky Arts HD in 2012. In 2013 Dennis launched the 30-date &quot;Did I Mention The Free Wine? - The Cut-Throat Tour&quot; to support the publication of &quot;Love, Of A Kind&quot;. The two-part tour covered the UK, Ireland and the continent during the summer and autumn months.

===In the media===
Dennis was credited with having been the first person to say the word &quot;cunt&quot; on live British television. On 7 November 1970, during an edition of David Frost&#x27;s &quot;The Frost Programme&quot;, Frost referred to guest Jerry Rubin as a &quot;reasonable man&quot;, Dennis, sitting in the audience, jokingly shouted out that Rubin was the &quot;most unreasonable cunt I&#x27;ve ever known in my life&quot;.

In 2003, Dennis was interviewed by Melvyn Bragg on the &quot;South Bank Show&quot;, and was the subject of CBS&#x27;s &quot;60 Minutes&quot; in the US. He had appeared as the guest on BBC Radio 4&#x27;s &quot;Desert Island Discs&quot;, hosted by Kirsty Young, first broadcast on 12 August 2007; his chosen favourite record, book and luxury item were &quot;One Too Many Mornings&quot; by Bob Dylan, &quot;The Dictionary of National Biography&quot;, and &quot;a very long stainless steel shaft to encourage pole-dancing mermaids!&quot; respectively.

In an interview with Ginny Dougary published in &quot;The Times&quot; in 2008, Dennis said that in the early 1980s he had killed a man who had been abusing a woman he knew, by pushing him off a cliff. Dennis later said he had been talking &quot;a load of hogwash&quot; while drunk.

In 2012, Dennis was the subject of &quot;Felix Dennis: Millionaire Poet&quot;, produced by Endemol UK, and appeared on Sky Arts HD. He appeared on BBC Breakfast television in 2013, to talk about his life and poetry tour.

==Various projects==
===Tree planting===
In 1995, Dennis planted his first small wood near Dorsington, Warwickshire. Subsequently, he conceived the idea of establishing a large native broadleaf forest, and founded The Forest of Dennis Ltd, a registered charity in 2003, which changed its name to The Heart of England Forest Ltd in 2011. Its mission is &quot;the plantation, re-plantation, conservation and establishment of trees for the benefit of the public, together with the education of the public by the promulgation of knowledge and the appreciation of trees&quot;.

The charity at present employs 80 staff and owns and manages over 500 acres of woodland, much of it newly planted. Over 3,000 acres have been planted; in excess of 1,000,000 saplings have been planted to date. The forest also includes a small percentage of ancient woodland. Trees include native varieties of Oak, Ash, Lime, Beech, Hornbeam, Hazel, Field Maple, Aspen, Hawthorn, Willow, Alder, Black Poplar, Holly, Wild Cherry, Rowan and occasional stands of Scots pine, along with numerous shrubs and bushes. Where possible, saplings are sourced from locally collected seed. The planting of saplings will continue indefinitely with the aim of eventually providing between 10,000 and 20,000 acres. Dennis bequeathed a reported 80% of his fortune to ensure that the project will continue. The forest will eventually be opened to the public along with providing educational facilities for schools as well as provide green burial services to the local area. 

On Friday, 20 September 2013, Dennis planted the scheme&#x27;s millionth tree, an oak sapling, at a ceremony attended by local residents, council members, forestry officials and employees.

===Felix Dennis UG Dissertation Prize===

Following the publication of a commissioned history of Dorsington, the village in Warwickshire, where Felix Dennis lived, he was encouraged by the editor of the History of Dorsington, Joan Lane, to support historical studies at the university where she was a lecturer. From 1999 to 2013 he sponsored a prize for the best final-year undergraduate dissertation at the Warwick University History Department.

===Garden of Heroes and Villains bronze sculptures===
Dennis had one of the largest private collections of original bronze sculpture held in his purpose-built Garden of Heroes and Villains. It contains more than 40 sculptures, life and a quarter in size, which include early man attacking a woolly mammoth, Galileo, Einstein, Winston Churchill, Crick and Watson, and more recent &quot;heroes&quot; such as Stephen Hawking, and is open to the public once a year as part of the National Gardens Scheme.

===Mandalay Estate Mustique===
In 1994 Dennis purchased &#x27;Britannia Bay House&#x27; on Mustique from English musician David Bowie who had the villa built in 1989. The villa was renamed &quot;Mandalay&quot; by Dennis, but he was keen to preserve the original influence of design from Bowie.

While staying at Mandalay Estate, Dennis wrote:

&lt;poem&gt;A ball of fire is spilling in the sea
The empty sky flamingo-pink and grey
Cicada songs creak out the end of day
A choir of tree-frogs whistle: &quot;Come to me!&quot;&lt;/poem&gt;

In 2014 Dennis worked successfully on a programme with the Saint Vincent and the Grenadines government to give every secondary school pupil a laptop, totalling 12,500.

After his death, the estate was reportedly sold to entrepreneur Simon Dolan. The Writers Cottage that was added by Dennis and where he wrote some of his poetry is now a bedroom.

==Death==
Dennis died of throat cancer at his home in Dorsington, Warwickshire, on 22 June 2014, aged 67.

<text>HMS &quot;Engadine&quot; was a cargo ship laid down at the Greenock Dockyard Company, Greenock, Scotland on 16 March 1940, launched on 26 May 1941 and completed on 17 November 1941.

She was ordered by Clan Line, and was to be named &quot;Clan Buchanan&quot; (the previous &quot;Clan Buchanan&quot; having been sunk by the on 28 April 1941). However the Admiralty requisitioned her for the Royal Navy before completion and renamed after the first for use as a seaplane depot ship.

She was loaned to the United States Navy from November 1942 until July 1943. After the war, she was restored to Clan Line in 1946 and given her originally-intended name. The ship was scrapped at Cartagena, Spain in November 1962.

<doc id="365641" wikidata="Q456519" url="?curid=365641" title="Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort">
<text>Henry Somerset, 1st Duke of Beaufort (162921 January 1700) was an English politician who sat in the House of Commons at various times between 1654 and 1667, when he succeeded his father as 3rd Marquess of Worcester. He was styled Lord Herbert from 1644 until 3 April 1667. The Dukedom of Beaufort was bestowed upon him by King Charles II in 1682.

==Early life==
Henry Somerset was born at Raglan Castle in 1629, and from 1644 was styled Lord Herbert of Raglan. As a reward for the services of his father Edward, he was promised, on 1 April 1646, the hand of Princess Elizabeth, the youngest daughter of King Charles I. He left the country during the First English Civil War, but returned by 1650.

==Lord Herbert==
His father&#x27;s estates had been forfeited, and those in Monmouthshire were held by Oliver Cromwell, but Herbert was given an allowance. Having renounced the Roman Catholic faith, which his father had held, he became acceptable to Cromwell, and was known as plain Mr. Herbert. He adopted the &quot;republican&quot; form of marriage before a justice of the peace in 1657. He sat in the First Protectorate Parliament as Member of Parliament for Breconshire in 1654–5.

After Cromwell&#x27;s death, Herbert then joined the party that demanded a &quot;full and free parliament&quot;, in practical terms demanding the Restoration of the House of Stuart. He was involved in the royalist plot of July 1659, and was committed to the Tower of London, whence he wrote to his wife on 20 August 1659 a letter taking a justly sanguine view of his situation. He was released on 1 November 1659, and was elected MP for Monmouthshire and for Wootton Basset in 1660; he chose to sit for Monmouthshire in the Convention Parliament. In 1661 he was re-elected MP for Monmouthshire in the Cavalier Parliament and sat until 1667 when he inherited a peerage.

As one of the twelve commissioners from the House of Commons who attended Charles II at Breda (7 May 1660), after Charles&#x27;s accession Herbert was appointed warden of the Forest of Dean (18 June), and also on 30 July, in response to appeals from local gentry, lord lieutenant of Gloucestershire, Herefordshire, and Monmouthshire. The Monmouthshire estates, which he had obtained by reversion from Cromwell, were allowed to remain in his possession, though they should strictly have reverted to his father; the latter wrote to Lord Clarendon that his son was intriguing against him.

Lord Herbert kept aloof from court life, but maintained good relations with the Hydes. In 1662 he was occupied with the demolition of the walls and fortifications at Gloucester, but the next year he pleaded for the retention of a garrison at Chepstow. In 1663 he entertained the king and queen at Badminton, Gloucestershire, an estate which he acquired by . Herbert was created M.A. by Oxford University on 28 September in that year. He represented Monmouthshire in the House of Commons from 1660 to 1667, when on 3 April he succeeded his father as 3rd Marquess of Worcester.

==Marquess of Worcester==
Worcester was created Lord President of the Council of Wales and the Marches in April 1672, a Privy Councillor on 17 April in the same year, and was installed as a Knight of the Garter on 29 May 1672. During the Popish Plot he was forced to maintain a public attitude of complete credence in the Plot, although he was aware that at least one of the informers, William Bedloe, was in league with his enemies, notably John Arnold, to damage his career. Bedloe never dared to accuse Worcester himself; he did accuse his steward Charles Price, and some of his relatives, but his accusations were so feeble that the Government ignored them. Worcester was also troubled by the accusations of treason made against his brother-in-law William Herbert, 1st Marquis of Powis, and against Donough Kearney, an Irishman who had married his widowed stepmother, Lady Margaret O&#x27;Brien. In the event, Kearney was acquitted of treason and Lord Powis was released after five years in the Tower of London without being brought to trial.

A steady supporter of the Court party, he voted against the Exclusion Bill at the close of 1680, whereupon the Commons petitioned the king to remove him from his person and counsels (January 1681). Charles regarded his conduct in a different light.

==Duke of Beaufort==

By letters patent, dated 2 December 1682, the Marquess was advanced to the title of Duke of Beaufort, with reference to John Beaufort of three centuries earlier, of whom the newly created Duke was a direct male-line descendant. At about the same time, the Duke began the remodelling of his seat at Badminton. On the strength of his attitude to the Exclusion Bill, Beaufort figured prominently in John Dryden&#x27;s &quot;Absalom and Achitophel&quot; as Bezaliel.

In November 1683 Beaufort obtained £20,000 damages in two libel actions against Sir Trevor Williams and John Arnold, but the judgment against the latter was partially reversed in 1690. In July 1684 he made, as president of the principality, magnificent progress through Wales, and was sumptuously entertained, among other places, at Worcester, Ludlow, and Welshpool. On 14 February 1685, along with the Duke of Somerset, he supported the Prince of Denmark as chief mourner at the funeral of Charles II. He bore the queen&#x27;s crown at the coronation of James II (23 April 1685), was appointed a gentleman of the bedchamber on 16 May, and colonel of the 11th Regiment of Foot on 20 June following.

When the Duke of Monmouth, at the close of June 1685, was hesitating to march upon Bristol, Beaufort as Lord Lieutenant occupied it in force on 16 June. He threatened to fire the city if any of Monmouth&#x27;s friends were admitted, and locked up a number of dissenters and disaffected persons in the Guildhall. Four days later he reviewed nineteen companies of foot and four troops of horse, and on 24 June twenty-one companies were drawn up on Redclyffe Mead and volunteers enlisted by the beat of the drum. On 6 July came tidings of Monmouth&#x27;s defeat at the Battle of Sedgemoor.

On 24 September James II visited the Duke at Badminton, and expressed his satisfaction at his consistent loyalty. In October 1688, when the Glorious Revolution was proceeding, Beaufort once more occupied Bristol with the train-bands of Gloucestershire, and some of his men captured John Lovelace, 3rd Baron Lovelace (who was trying to join William of Orange) at Cirencester, and lodged him a prisoner in Gloucester Castle. He prepared to defend the city, but had eventually to surrender to the superior force under the Earl of Shrewsbury and Sir John Guise. He voted for a regency in preference to the offer of the crown to William of Orange.

On 14 December 1688 Beaufort waited on William at Windsor, but was coldly received. He nevertheless took the oaths in March 1689, and was so far reconciled as to entertain William at Badminton on 7 September 1690. In 1694 he was living in great seclusion at Chelsea, taking the waters, and absenting himself from court. Suspected of complicity in the assassination plot, his house was searched in February 1696, but nothing was found to compromise him.

==Last years==
On 19 March 1696, when expected to attend the House of Lords to sign the Association, Beaufort &quot;broke his shoulder&quot;. The Lords sent him the document to sign; but he refused, though he declared his abhorrence of the plot against William. By November 1697 he was reconciled to the court, but he suffered the loss of his son and heir, Charles, through an accident to his coach in Wales in July 1698.

Beaufort died at Badminton on 21 January 1700. He was buried in the Beaufort Chapel in St. George&#x27;s, Windsor, where an elaborate monument was set up to his memory; it was moved in 1878 to Badminton. Within St Michael and All Angels Church, Badminton, this monument by Grinling Gibbons is now on the North side of the chancel and consists of an effigy of the Duke in Garter robes, reclining on a sarcophagus and a plinth with relief of St George and the Dragon. There are twin Corinthian columns with embossed shafts, acanthus frieze, cornice with flaming urns, and the Duke&#x27;s arms and supporters. At the top, 25 ft from the ground, is a tasselled cushion supporting a coronet; on the plinth are full-length female figures of Justice and Truth. Above the Duke&#x27;s effigy, parted curtains show the heavenly host with palms and crowns. The Latin inscription displays the names of his family and the many offices he held.

Roger North, in his &quot;Life of the Lord Keeper&quot;, gave an account of the state maintained by Beaufort: &quot;a princely way of living&quot; with a household of about 200. The Duke spent much time hunting, planting, and building, and was unfashionably strict: his servants lived in constant fear of dismissal, and even neighbouring landowners were reluctant to cross him.

==Family==
On 17 August 1657, he married Mary Capell, who was the daughter of Arthur Capell, 1st Baron Capell of Hadham, sister of Arthur Capell, 1st Earl of Essex, and widow of Henry Seymour, Lord Beauchamp. They had five sons and four daughters. Three of the sons were:
* Henry, who died as an infant;
* Charles (December 166013 July 1698), who had a military and political career and succeeded him as Marquess of Worcester;
* Arthur (29 September 1671July 1743), who married Mary Russell in 1695, daughter of William Russell, 1st and last Bt., and Hesther Rouse, daughter of Sir Thomas Rouse, 1st Bt. (1608–1676). Their daughter was Mary Somerset, grandmother of Sir Charles William Rouse Boughton, 1st and 9th Bt.
Three of the daughters were:
* Mary, Lady of the Bedchamber, who was married to James Butler, 2nd Duke of Ormonde as his second wife, and became the mother of one son and two daughters;
* Henrietta, who was married twice, first to Henry Horatio O&#x27;Brien, Lord Ibrackan, with whom she had one son, the 8th Earl of Thomond, and three daughters, and secondly to Henry Howard, 6th Earl of Suffolk as his second wife
* Anne (1673–1763), who married Thomas Coventry, 2nd Earl of Coventry, and became the mother of one son.
The fourth daughter—bearing an unknown name—might have died young.

Beaufort&#x27;s son Charles died before he could inherit the dukedom, so on the duke&#x27;s death it passed to Charles&#x27;s son Henry.

<doc id="365645" wikidata="Q1866923" url="?curid=365645" title="La Llorona">
<text> (; ) is a vengeful ghost in Mexican folklore who is said to roam near bodies of water mourning her children whom she drowned in a jealous rage after discovering her husband was unfaithful to her. Whoever hears her crying either suffers misfortune or death and their life becomes unsuccessful in every field.

==Origins==

Known for being Malintzin in her original nomenclature, today, the lore of La Llorona is well known in Mexico and the southwestern United States.

The earliest documentation of La Llorona is traced back to 1550 in Mexico City . But there are theories about her story being connected to specific Aztec mythological creation stories. &quot;The Hungry Woman&quot; includes a wailing woman constantly crying for food, which has been compared to La Llorona&#x27;s signature nocturnal wailing for her children. The motherly nature of La Llorona&#x27;s tragedy has been compared to Cihuacoatl, an Aztec goddess deity of motherhood. Her seeking of children to keep for herself is significantly compared to Coatlicue, known as &quot;Our Lady Mother&quot; or Tonantzin (who&#x27;s also comparable to the Virgen de Guadalupe, another significant mother figure in Mexican culture), also a monster that devours filth or sin. She was in rage so much that she drowned her children and then was so sad that she drowned herself and now is called the weeping woman.

The legend of La Llorona is traditionally told throughout Mexico, Central America and northern South America.
 is sometimes conflated with , the Nahua woman who served as &#x27; interpreter and also bore his son. is considered both the mother of the modern Mexican people and a symbol of national treachery for her role in aiding the Spanish.

Stories of weeping female phantoms are common in the folklore of both Iberian and Amerindian cultures. Scholars have pointed out similarities between and the of Aztec mythology, as well as Eve and Lilith of Hebrew mythology. Author Ben Radford&#x27;s investigation into the legend of , published in &quot;Mysterious New Mexico&quot;, found common elements of the story in the German folktale &quot;Die Wei e Frau&quot; dating from 1486. also bears a resemblance to the ancient Greek tale of the demigoddess Lamia, in which Hera, Zeus&#x27; wife, learned of his affair with Lamia and killed all the children Lamia had with Zeus. Out of jealousy over the loss of her own children, Lamia kills other women&#x27;s children.

The Florentine Codex is an important text that originated in late Mexico in 1519 , a quote from which is, &quot;The sixth omen was that many times a woman would be heard going along weeping and shouting. She cried out loudly at night, saying, &quot;Oh my children, we are about to go forever.&quot; Sometimes she said, &quot;Oh my children, where am I to take you?&quot;

While the roots of the legend appear to be pre-Hispanic, the earliest published reference to the legend is a 19th-century sonnet by Mexican poet Manuel Carpio. The poem makes no reference to infanticide, rather is identified as the ghost of a woman named Rosalia who was murdered by her husband.

==Regional versions==
The legend has a wide variety of details and versions. In a typical version of the legend, a beautiful woman named María marries a rich &quot;ranchero / conquistador&quot; to whom she bears two children. One day, María sees her husband with another woman and in a fit of blind rage, she drowns their children in a river, which she immediately regrets. Unable to save them and consumed by guilt, she drowns herself as well but is unable to enter the afterlife, forced to be in purgatory and roam this earth until she finds her children.
In another version of the story, her children are illegitimate, and she drowns them so that their father cannot take them away to be raised by his new wife. Recurring themes in variations on the myth include a white, wet dress, nocturnal wailing, and an association with water.

===Mexico===
The legend of is deeply rooted in Mexican popular culture. Her story is told to children to encourage them not to wander off in the dark and near bodies of water such as rivers and lakes alone. Her spirit is often evoked in artwork, such as that of Alejandro Colunga. is a yearly waterfront theatrical performance of the legend of set in the canals of the Xochimilco borough of Mexico City, which was established in 1993 to coincide with the Day of the Dead. In 1930s the reference and representation of &quot;La Llorona&quot; is seen in the production of films. &quot;La Llorona&quot; is portrayed as a vengeful and evil monster in many films. The classic film &quot;La Venganza de la Llorona&quot; (1974) produced by Miguel M. Delgado is one of the many popular renditions of &quot;La Llorona.&quot; 

In Chicano culture, the tale of &quot;La Llorona&quot; acts as a warning particularly for women on what is considered acceptable behavior within the culture. In Mexican culture &quot;La Llorona&quot; represents a vengeful lover who goes from a resentful wife to a monstrous mother who drowns her children after discovering her husband&#x27;s infidelity. Chicana writers and artists redefined &quot;La Llorona&quot; based on embodied experience and the social and political pressures they faced. The rise of Chicana feminism and the Chicano movement encouraged Chicana writers and artists to reinvent their historical and cultural Mexican presence in the United States. &quot;La Llorona&quot; was rewritten as a strong woman who had been forced to accommodate to the colonizers ruling and had been punished for challenging traditional female roles. Chicanas related to the agony that &quot;La Llorona&quot; faced while being stripped of her identity by Spanish colonizers. &quot;La Llorona&quot; symbolizes the pain and grief and became a metaphorical representation of the challenges and struggles faced by marginalized groups.

=== Guatemala ===
According to the local legend, in Guatemala City lived a woman who had an affair with a lover. She became pregnant and gave birth to a child named Juan de la Cruz who she drowned so her husband would not know. The woman was condemned in the afterlife to search for her murdered son in every place where there is a pool of water. She does that by crying out for himhence her moniker of the Wailing Woman (). It is a popular scary legend that in one iteration or another has been told to generations of children. The terrifying cry of &quot;Oh, my children!!&quot; (¡Ay mis hijos!) is well known due to the story. Additionally, one peculiar detail is that when a person hears the cry from afar means that the ghost is nearby, but if the cry is heard nearby, it means the ghost is afar.

<text>HMS &quot;Engadine&quot; was a seaplane tender which served in the Royal Navy during the First World War. Converted from the cross-Channel packet ship SS Engadine, she was initially fitted with temporary hangars for three seaplanes for aerial reconnaissance and bombing missions in the North Sea. She participated in the Cuxhaven Raid in late 1914 before she began a more thorough conversion in 1915 that increased her capacity to four aircraft. &quot;Engadine&quot; was transferred to the Battle Cruiser Fleet in late 1915 and participated in the Battle of Jutland in 1916 when one of her aircraft flew the first heavier-than-air reconnaissance mission during a naval battle. She was transferred to the Mediterranean in 1918.

She was sold back to her original owners in 1919 and resumed her prewar role. &quot;Engadine&quot; was sold in 1933 to a Philippine company and renamed SS &quot;Corregidor&quot;. She was sunk with heavy loss of life by a mine in December 1941 during the invasion of the Philippines at the beginning of the Pacific War.

==Description==
&quot;Engadine&quot; had an overall length of , a beam of , and a mean draught of . She displaced at deep load and was rated at . Each of the ship&#x27;s three sets of direct-drive steam turbines drove one propeller shaft. The ship&#x27;s six boilers generated enough steam to produce from the turbines, enough for a designed speed of . &quot;Engadine&quot; carried of coal, enough to give her a range of at .

==Construction and service==
SS &quot;Engadine&quot; was laid down by William Denny and Brothers at their Dumbarton, Scotland shipyard as a fast packet for the South East and Chatham Railway&#x27;s Folkestone-Boulogne run. The ship was launched on 23 September 1911 and completed later that year. She was requisitioned for service by the Admiralty on 11 August 1914, and was commissioned on 1 September after she was modified to handle seaplanes by Chatham Dockyard. Three canvas hangars were installed, one forward and two aft, and there was no flight deck, the aircraft being lowered onto the sea for takeoff and recovered again from the sea after landing by newly installed derricks. In 1918 her crew numbered 197 officers and ratings, including 53 aviation personnel.

Upon completion of the modifications on 1 September, &quot;Engadine&quot; was assigned to the Harwich Force along with the seaplane tenders and . On Christmas Day 1914, nine aircraft from all three ships took part in the Cuxhaven Raid on hangars housing Zeppelin airships. Seven of the nine seaplanes successfully took off for the attack, but they inflicted little damage. Only three of the aircraft returned to be recovered, but the crews of the other three ditched safely and were recovered by a British submarine and the Dutch trawler &quot;Marta van Hattem&quot;. A notable member of &quot;Engerdine&#x27;s&quot; crew was Robert Erskine Childers who served as an instructor in coastal navigation to newly trained pilots. He managed to extend his duties to include flying as a navigator and observer and participated in the raid, for which he was mentioned in despatches.

&quot;Engadine&quot; was purchased in February 1915 by the Admiralty and she was modified by Cunard at Liverpool from 10 February to 23 March 1915 with a permanent, four-aircraft, hangar in the rear superstructure and a pair of cranes were mounted at the rear of the hangar to hoist the seaplanes in and out of the water. Four quick-firing (QF) 12-pounder 12 cwt guns, each with 130 rounds, and two Vickers QF 3-pounder anti-aircraft guns, each with 65 rounds, were fitted for self-defence. She also carried a pigeon loft that housed carrier pigeons to be used by her aircraft if their wireless was broken.

Upon completion of the conversion, she rejoined the Harwich Force; on 3 July, &quot;Engadine&quot; and &quot;Riviera&quot; attempted to launch aircraft to reconnoitre the River Ems and lure out a Zeppelin so that it could be attacked. Of &quot;Engadine&quot;″s three Sopwith Schneider floatplanes that she attempted to launch, two wrecked on takeoff and the third was badly damaged. She was transferred to Vice Admiral David Beatty&#x27;s Battlecruiser Fleet (BCF), based at Rosyth in October. Later that month &quot;Engadine&quot; carried out trials on high-speed towing of kite balloons for gunnery observations, although she generally served as a base ship for the fleet&#x27;s seaplanes.

===Battle of Jutland===

On 30 May 1916, &quot;Engadine&quot; was attached to the 3rd Light Cruiser Squadron, commanded by Rear Admiral Trevylyan Napier, and carried two Short Type 184 and two Sopwith Baby floatplanes aboard. The two-seat Type 184s were intended for observation and were fitted with a low-power wireless while the Babies were intended to shoot down Zeppelins. &quot;Engadine&quot; accompanied the cruisers when the Battlecruiser Fleet sortied from Rosyth that evening to intercept the German High Seas Fleet. For a time on 31 May she was actually leading the BCF and may have been one of the first ships to spot the oncoming Germans. Her position in the vanguard was dictated by the requirement for smooth water to successfully launch her aircraft; turbulent water from ships&#x27; wakes was enough to ruin a take off attempt. She would also have to come to a complete stop to hoist her aircraft over the side and prepare it for launch, a process that took at least 20 minutes at anchor. Thus she could launch her floatplane in unruffled water and then fall back among the main body of the fleet.

Beatty ordered &quot;Engadine&quot; to make a search to the north-northeast at 14:40 and she sailed through the BCF before turning north-east to find calmer water. At 15:07 Lieutenant Frederick Rutland took off in his Type 184 and his observer signalled &quot;Engadine&quot; that they had spotted three German cruisers and five destroyers at 15:30. These were ships from the II Scouting Group, leading the battlecruisers of Vice Admiral Franz von Hipper. This was the first time that a heavier-than-air aircraft had carried out a reconnaissance of an enemy fleet in action. After a few other spot reports were transmitted, the aircraft&#x27;s fuel line ruptured around 15:36 and Rutland was forced to put his aircraft down. He was able to repair it and signalled that he was ready to take off again, but he was ordered to taxi to the carrier on the surface. The aircraft reached the ship at 15:47 and it was hoisted aboard by 16:04. By this time, a pair of destroyers, and , that had been ordered to protect &quot;Engadine&quot; while she was stationary had reached her. &quot;Engadine&quot; attempted to relay the spot reports to Beatty&#x27;s flagship and the flagship of the 5th Battle Squadron, but was unsuccessful. She trailed Beatty&#x27;s force during the &quot;Run to the South&quot;, during which time her two escorts were detached and again when they reversed course during the &quot;Run to the North&quot;.

The armoured cruiser &quot;Warrior&quot; had been crippled by numerous hits by German battleships around 18:30 and fell in with &quot;Engadine&quot; 10 minutes later. The former&#x27;s rudder had been jammed full over and she continued to turn in tight circles until her steam was exhausted. At 19:45 &quot;Engadine&quot; attempted to take her in tow, but the jammed rudder prevented that until it was trained amidships. By 21:30 she was making while her turbines were making revolutions for . Early the following morning &quot;Warrior&quot;″s progressive flooding had worsened and she was sinking. Captain Vincent Molteno ordered his ship abandoned after &quot;Engadine&quot; came alongside to take them off at 08:00. One of &quot;Warrior&quot;″s guns punctured &quot;Engadine&quot;″s hull below the waterline as the former ship rolled in the moderate seas, but this was quickly patched. About 675 officers and ratings successfully made it to the much smaller &quot;Engadine&quot; which had to quickly distribute them to prevent her from capsizing. Among these were about 30 seriously wounded men who were transferred across in their stretchers; one man fell off his stretcher between the ships, but was rescued by Rutland against orders. For his bravery he was awarded the First Class Albert Medal for Lifesaving in gold and briefly became the only living recipient. The transfer was completed before 09:00 and &quot;Warrior&quot; sank shortly afterwards.
&quot;Engadine&quot; remained with the Battlecruiser Force until early 1918 when she was transferred to the Mediterranean Fleet. She was based out of Malta, conducting anti-submarine patrols, for the remainder of the war.

===Postwar career===
She was sold back to her original owners, the South Eastern and Chatham Railway, in December 1919 and resumed her former role as a cross-Channel ferry. &quot;Engadine&quot; was transferred to the Southern Railway in 1923 when the British railways were consolidated. Passing through the hands of a ship broker, she was sold to Fernandez Hermanos, Inc. in the Philippines in 1933 and renamed SS &quot;Corregidor&quot;.

==== Sinking====
At 22:00 on 16 December 1941, &quot;Corregidor&quot; left its dock in Manila in total darkness, loaded to overcapacity with Filipino civilians seeking to escape to the southern Philippines after the war had started. It has been estimated that between 1,200 and 1,500 people were on board, including approximately 150 Philippine soldiers, 7 Americans, 5 Philippine legislators, and hundreds of college students who were traveling home after their schools had closed. Also aboard were military supplies as well most of the artillery complement (2.95-inch mountain guns) of the Visayan-Mindanao Force of the Philippine Army. The owners of the ship failed to inform the Navy&#x27;s Inshore Patrol of the ship&#x27;s plan to leave Manila Bay.

Although Captain Apolinar Calvo of the &quot;Corregidor&quot; had prior experience navigating the mined entrance to Manila Bay (the mines had been in place since July), the Navy had changed its procedures on that day. Rather than post a gunboat near the safe channel as they had in days previous, lighted buoys were used to guide boats through. As the &quot;Corregidor&quot; sailed close to the island of Corregidor to pass through the channel at around 01:00, the ship was observed turning toward the electrically-controlled minefield. Some officers posted at the Army&#x27;s Seaward Defense Command headquarters on the island recommended that the mines be temporarily disarmed so that the ship could pass through the minefield. A number of accounts state that Seaward Defense Commander Colonel Paul Bunker ordered that the mines be kept active.

When the &quot;Corregidor&quot; entered the minefield, there was a large explosion on the starboard side of the vessel. The overcrowded ship quickly began to sink, with many people trapped below-deck. Survivors stated that the ship sank so quickly that there was no time for large-scale panic to set in. Searchlights from Corregidor Island illuminated the scene which aided the rescue effort. Sailors of MTB Squadron 3 posted at Sisiman Cove heard the explosion and left on three PT boats (&quot;PT-32&quot;, &quot;PT-34&quot; and &quot;PT-35&quot;) to investigate. When the boats arrived they found survivors in the water and were able to retrieve 282 survivors. Seven of the rescued passengers later died from their injuries.

The incident was never investigated due to the Japanese invasion. Later, some Army officers reported that the remote-controllable mines were set to the safety position immediately after the explosion occurred. The total number of victims is unknown. It has been estimated that 900–1,200 lost their lives. Among the dead were the captain and most of the crew, two of the legislators, and one of the American passengers. At the time, the sinking of the &quot;Corregidor&quot; was the most significant maritime disaster in Philippine history.

<text>Henry van Wart (1784 - 1873), an American who became British by special act of Parliament, founded the Birmingham Stock Exchange and served as one of Birmingham&#x27;s first aldermen and a director of the Birmingham Banking Company.

He was married to Sarah Irving, the sister of author Washington Irving. They had four children: William (1812 - 1868), Matilda (b. 1814), Marianne (b. 1816). and George (b. 1817; later a wine merchant). William later named his first-born Washington Irving van Wart (b. 1836), whose niece in turn was called Rosalinda Irving van Wart (b. 1874).

Henry and Sarah met when he was employed by her family&#x27;s New York City company, Irving &amp; Smith, and they moved to England when he was tasked with opening a Liverpool branch of the firm.

After that enterprise failed, they moved to Birmingham, and he set up a profitable business, exporting the city&#x27;s goods to America.

Washington Irving lived with the van Warts at four of their homes in Birmingham, light-heartedly christening two of these buildings &quot;Castle van Tromp&quot; and writing some of his most successful stories at them.

He is also known to have worshipped at St Paul&#x27;s Church in St Paul&#x27;s Square, Birmingham.

Van Wart developed a friendship with Louisiana businessman Frederick W. Tilton, who became van Wart&#x27;s agent in New Orleans. Tilton endowed the library at Tulane University.

Henry van Wart was also great friends with fellow American Samuel Aspinwall Goddard, US Consul to Birmingham. Goddard&#x27;s uncle was also Thomas Aspinwall (consul) United States consul to London, 1816–1854. Goddard was a gunmaker, LBSC director, owner of the Church &quot;Surprise&quot; railway locomotive 1840, author and pamphleteer, exhibitor of guns at Great Exhibition of 1851 and co-patentee with Dr. William Church (inventor) of a breech-loading canon presented to the British parliamentary ordinance committee in 1853. Samuel A. Goddard also named his daughter Emily van Wart Goddard after Henry van Wart.

<doc id="365654" wikidata="Q2892312" url="?curid=365654" title="Bayou Teche">
<text>Bayou Teche (Louisiana French: &quot;Bayou Têche&quot;) is a waterway in south central Louisiana in the United States. Bayou Teche was the Mississippi River&#x27;s main course when it developed a delta about 2,800 to 4,500 years ago. Through a natural process known as deltaic switching, the river&#x27;s deposits of silt and sediment cause the Mississippi to change its course every thousand years or so.

==History==
The Teche begins in Port Barre where it draws water from Bayou Courtableau and then flows southward to meet the Lower Atchafalaya River at Patterson. During the 18th-century Acadian migration to the area - then known as the Attakapas region - the Teche was the primary means of transportation.

During the American Civil War, there were two naval engagements on Bayou Teche. The Confederate navy had a gunboat on the bayou, the , which was partially armored with railroad iron. On November 3, 1862, four Union gunboats, , , , and , moved up the Bayou to engage the Cotton. All four Union ships were damaged, but the &quot;Cotton&quot; was forced to withdraw.
The second engagement occurred on 14 January 1863. Union general Godfrey Weitzel learned that the &quot;J. A. Cotton&quot; was planning an attack on Weitzel&#x27;s forces at Berwick Bay, Louisiana. Once again &quot;Kinsman&quot;, &quot;Calhoun&quot;, &quot;Estrella&quot; and &quot;Diana&quot; steamed into the Bayou, followed by Union transports. The bayou had been obstructed with debris. The Union gunboats and land-based units engaged the &quot;J. A. Cotton&quot; and Confederate infantry in rifle pits. During the battle &quot;Kinsman&quot; hit a mine and unshipped her rudder; the &quot;J. A. Cotton&quot; was badly damaged, and her crew set her on fire during the night to prevent capture. The Union, however, was unable to hold the Teche, necessitating two more invasions of the Teche country in 1863 and 1864, referred to as the Bayou Teche campaign.

After the levees were built along the Atachafalaya River in the 1930s, the Teche and the rice farms located along the bayou suffered a drastic reduction in fresh water. Between 1976 and 1982, the United States Army Corps of Engineers built a pumping station at Krotz Springs to pump water from the Atchafalaya River into Bayou Courtableau.

The etymology of the name &quot;Teche&quot; is uncertain. One hypothesis is that it comes from &quot;tenche&quot;, a Chitimacha Indian word meaning &quot;snake&quot;, related to the bayou&#x27;s twists and turns resembling a snake&#x27;s movement. The Chitimacha tell an ancient story of how the snake attacked their villages, and it took many warriors many years to kill it. Where the huge carcass lay and decomposed, the depression it left behind filled with water to become the bayou. Alternatively, George R. Stewart asserts that it is &quot;probably a French rendering of Deutsch, the name by which the German colonists of the area would have named their stream. Cf. Allemand [&#x27;German&#x27;].&quot;

<text>Samut Prakan province (, , , sometimes rendered Samutprakan or Samutprakarn) is one of the central provinces of Thailand, established on 9 May 1946 by the &quot;Act Establishing Changwat Samut Prakan, Changwat Nonthaburi, Changwat Samut Sakhon and Changwat Nakhon Nayok, Buddhist Era 2489 (1946)&quot;.

It is a part of the Bangkok Metropolitan Region. Neighbouring provinces are Bangkok, to the north and west, and Chachoengsao to the east. Samut Prakan was previously once home to a Dutch trading post who referred to the area as New Amsterdam. Suvarnabhumi Airport is in Bang Phli district of Samut Prakan province as well as the districts of Bang Kapi, Lat Krabang, and Prawet in neighbouring Bangkok city.

==History==
The province was created during the era of the Ayutthaya Kingdom, with its administrative centre at Prapadaeng. It was the sea port of Siam, and was secured with forts, town moats, and town walls. King Rama II started building the new centre at Samut Prakan in 1819, after his predecessor King Taksin had abandoned the town fortifications. Altogether six forts were built on both sides of the Chao Phraya River, and on an island in the river the pagoda, Phra Samut Chedi, was erected. These were involved in the Paknam incident of 13 July 1893, which ended the Franco-Siamese conflict with a French naval blockade of Bangkok. Of the original six forts only two still exist today, Phi Sua Samut and Phra Chulachomklao.

==Toponymy==
In Thai the word is from Sanskrit, , meaning &#x27;ocean&#x27; or &#x27;sea&#x27;, and the word is from Sanskrit, , meaning &#x27;fortress&#x27;, &#x27;walls&#x27;, or &#x27;stronghold&#x27;.

==Geography==
Samut Prakan lies at the mouth of the Chao Phraya River on the Gulf of Thailand. Thus the province is also sometimes called &quot;Pak Nam&quot; (ปากน้ำ), Thai for &#x27;mouth of river&#x27;. The part of the province on the west side of the river consists mostly of rice paddies and shrimp farms as well as mangrove forests, while the eastern part is the urban centre, including industrial factories. It is part of the Bangkok metropolis. The urbanization on both sides of the provincial boundary is identical. The total forest area is or 3 percent of provincial area. The province has a coastline of approximately 47.2 kilometres.
Samut Prakan is the site of a skirmish between French and Siamese forces on 13 July 1893, subsequently referred to as the Paknam Incident. This battle resulted in a French victory and the signing of the Franco-Siamese Treaty of 3 October 1893 which ceded territory east of the Mekong River to France, territory that forms much of modern Laos.

==Symbols==
The provincial seal shows the temple Phra Samut Chedi, the most important site of Buddhist worship in the province.

The provincial tree is &quot;Thespesia populnea&quot;. The provincial aquatic life is the snakeskin gourami (&quot;Trichopodus pectoralis&quot;), as it is a vital commercial fish of Samut Prakan. It is widely cultivated and has been famous for a long time, especially in Bang Bo.

==Administrative divisions==

===Provincial government===
The province is divided into six districts (&quot;amphoes&quot;). The districts are further subdivided into 50 subdistricts (&quot;tambons&quot;) and 396 villages (&quot;mubans&quot;).

===Local government===
As of 13 May 2020, there are: one Samut Prakan Provincial Administrative Organization - PAO (&quot;&quot;) and twenty-two municipal (&quot;thesaban&quot;) areas in the province. The capital Samut Prakan has city (&quot;thesaban nakhon&quot;) status. Further seven have town (&quot;thesaban mueang&quot;) status and fourteen subdistrict municipalities (&quot;thesaban tambon&quot;).



The non-municipal areas are administered by 26 Subdistrict Administrative Organizations (SAO) (&quot;ongkan borihan suan tambon&quot;).

For national elections, the province is divided into three voting districts, one represented by three assemblymen and the other two each by two assemblymen.

==Suvarnabhumi Airport==


Suvarnabhumi Airport (; ) , also known as (New) Bangkok International Airport, is one of two international airports serving Bangkok. The other one is Don Mueang International Airport. Suvarnabhumi covers an area of .

The airport is on what had formerly been known as Nong Nguhao (Cobra Swamp) in Racha Thewa in Bang Phli, Samut Prakan province, about east of downtown Bangkok. The terminal building was designed by Helmut Jahn of Murphy / Jahn Architects. It was constructed primarily by ITO Joint Venture. The airport has the world&#x27;s tallest free-standing control tower (), and the world&#x27;s fourth largest single-building airport terminal, ().

Suvarnabhumi is the twentieth busiest airport in the world, the sixth busiest airport in Asia, and the busiest in the country, handling 63 million passengers in 2018, and is also a major air cargo hub, with a total of 95 airlines. On social networks, Suvarnabhumi was the world&#x27;s most popular site for taking Instagram photographs in 2012.

The airport inherited the airport code, BKK, from Don Mueang after the older airport ceased international commercial flights. Motorway 7 connects the airport, Bangkok, and the heavily industrial eastern seaboard of Thailand, where most export manufacturing takes place.

==Bhumibol Bridge==

The Bhumibol Bridge (), also known as the Industrial Ring Road Bridge () is part of the 13 km long Industrial Ring Road connecting southern Bangkok with Samut Prakan province. The bridge crosses the Chao Phraya River twice, with two cable-stayed spans of lengths of 702 m and 582 m supported by two diamond-shaped pylons 173 m and 164 m high. Where the two spans meet, another road rises to join them at a free-flowing interchange suspended 50 metres above the ground.

The bridge opened for traffic on 20 September 2006, before the official opening date of 5 December 2006. It is part of the Bangkok Industrial Ring Road, a royal scheme initiated by King Bhumibol Adulyadej that aims to solve traffic problems within Bangkok and surrounding areas, especially the industrial area around Khlong Toei Port, Southern Bangkok, and Samut Prakan province.

According to tradition, all the bridges over the Chao Phraya in Bangkok are named after a member of the royal family. In October 2009, it was announced that both bridges would be named after King Bhumibol Adulyadej, with the northern bridge officially named &quot;Bhumibol 1 Bridge&quot; and the southern bridge &quot;Bhumibol 2 Bridge&quot;.

The structure of the Bhumibol Bridge consists of two parts:
* Bhumibol Bridge 1 crosses the northern part of Chao Praya River connecting Yan Nawa district, Bangkok and Song Khanong District, Samut Prakan. It is a cable-stayed bridge with seven lanes together with two high pillars. The structure is reinforced concrete 50 m above the river to enable the passage of ships.
* Bhumibol Bridge 2 is the one across the southern part of Chao Praya River connecting Song Khanong District and Bang Ya Phraek District. The structure is similar to Bhumibol Bridge 1, with seven lanes and two pillars built using reinforced concrete 50 m high.

==Economy==
Nissan has two factories in the district, together employing 4,000 workers, 30% of them contract workers. Nissan-Thailand has an annual production capacity of 295,000 vehicles, making the Navara, Teana, Terra, Note, Almera, March, Sylphy and X-Trail models. Nissan plans to make 190,000 vehicles by the end of its fiscal year 2019, ending next March 2020. Roughly 120,000-130,000 units are pickup trucks, the remainder passenger cars.
Nissan produces hybrid electric vehicles (HEVs) based on its e-Power technology and batteries for electric vehicles at a plant in Bang Sao Thong district. It has a production capacity of 370,000 vehicles a year.

Thai Theparos Public Co., Ltd., a leading Thai condiment manufacturer, has its headquarters in Thai Ban subdistrict, Mueang Samut Prakan district.

== Health ==
Samut Prakan&#x27;s main hospital is Samut Prakan Hospital, a regional hospital operated by the Ministry of Public Health. Samut Prakan is also the location of Chakri Naruebodindra Medical Institute, a university hospital operated by the Faculty of Medicine Ramathibodi Hospital, Mahidol University.

==Human achievement index 2022==

Since 2003, the United Nations Development Programme (UNDP) in Thailand has tracked progress on human development at sub-national level using the Human achievement index (HAI), a composite index covering eight key areas of human development. National Economic and Social Development Board (NESDB) has taken over this task since 2017.

<doc id="365662" wikidata="Q326224" url="?curid=365662" title="Colchicine">
<text>Colchicine is a medication used to prevent and treat gout, to treat familial Mediterranean fever and Behçet&#x27;s disease, and to reduce the risk of myocardial infarction. The American College of Rheumatology recommends colchicine, nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) or steroids in the treatment of gout. Other uses for colchicine include the management of pericarditis. 

Colchicine is taken by mouth. The injectable route of administration for colchicine can be toxic. In 2008, the US Food and Drug Administration removed all injectable colchicine from the US market.
Colchicine has a narrow therapeutic index, so overdosing is a significant risk. Common side effects of colchicine include gastrointestinal upset, particularly at high doses. Severe side effects may include pancytopenia (low blood cell counts) and rhabdomyolysis (damage to skeletal muscle), and the medication can be deadly in overdose. Whether colchicine is safe for use during pregnancy is unclear, but its use during breastfeeding appears to be safe. Colchicine works by decreasing inflammation via multiple mechanisms.
Colchicine, in the form of the autumn crocus (&quot;Colchicum autumnale&quot;), was used as early as 1500 BC to treat joint swelling. It was approved for medical use in the United States in 1961. It is available as a generic medication. In 2022, it was the 197th most commonly prescribed medication in the United States, with more than 2million prescriptions.
Colchicine is used in plant breeding to induce polyploidy, in which the number of chromosomes in plant cells are doubled. This helps produce larger, hardier, faster-growing, and in general, more desirable plants than the normally diploid parents.

==Medical uses==
===Gout===
Colchicine is an alternative for those unable to tolerate nonsteroidal anti-inflammatory drugs (NSAIDs) when treating gout. Low doses (1.2 mg in one hour, followed by 0.6 mg an hour later) appear to be well tolerated and may reduce gout symptoms and pain, perhaps as effectively as NSAIDs. At higher doses, side effects (primarily diarrhea, nausea, or vomiting) limit its use.

For treating gout symptoms, colchicine is taken orally, with or without food, as symptoms first appear. Subsequent doses may be needed if symptoms worsen. 

There is preliminary evidence that daily colchicine may be effective as a long-term prophylaxis when used with allopurinol to reduce the risk of increased uric acid levels and acute gout flares; adverse gastrointestinal effects may occur, though overall the risk of serious side effects is low.

===Risk of cardiovascular disorders===
In June 2023, the US FDA approved a low-dose regimen of colchicine (brand name Lodoco) to reduce the risk of further disorders in adults with existing cardiovascular diseases. As an anti-inflammatory drug, Lodoco in a dose of 0.5 mg per day reduced the rate of cardiovascular events by 31% in people with established atherosclerosis and by 23% in people with recent myocardial infarction. Colchicine was most effective in combination therapy with lipid-lowering and anti-inflammatory medications. The mechanism for this effect of colchicine is unknown.

===Other conditions===
Colchicine is also used as an anti-inflammatory agent for long-term treatment of Behçet&#x27;s disease. It appears to have limited effect in relapsing polychondritis, as it may only be useful for the treatment of chondritis and mild skin symptoms. It is a component of therapy for several other conditions, including pericarditis, pulmonary fibrosis, biliary cirrhosis, various vasculitides, pseudogout, spondyloarthropathy, calcinosis, scleroderma, and amyloidosis. 

Research regarding the efficacy of colchicine in many of these diseases has not been performed. It is also used in the treatment of familial Mediterranean fever, in which it reduces attacks and the long-term risk of amyloidosis.

Colchicine is effective for prevention of atrial fibrillation after cardiac surgery. In people with recent myocardial infarction (recent heart attack), it has been found to reduce risk of future cardiovascular events. Its clinical use may grow to include this indication.

==Contraindications==
Long-term (prophylactic) regimens of oral colchicine are absolutely contraindicated in people with advanced kidney failure (including those on dialysis). About 10–20% of a colchicine dose is excreted unchanged by the kidneys; it is not removed by hemodialysis. Cumulative toxicity is a high probability in this clinical setting, and a severe neuromyopathy may result. The presentation includes a progressive onset of proximal weakness, elevated creatine kinase, and sensorimotor polyneuropathy. Colchicine toxicity can be potentiated by the concomitant use of cholesterol-lowering drugs.

==Adverse effects==
Deaths – both accidental and intentional – have resulted from overdose of colchicine. Typical side effects of moderate doses may include gastrointestinal upset, diarrhea, and neutropenia. High doses can also damage bone marrow, lead to anemia, and cause hair loss. All of these side effects can result from inhibition of mitosis, which may include neuromuscular toxicity and rhabdomyolysis.

==Toxicity==
According to one review, colchicine poisoning by overdose (range of acute doses of 7 to 26 mg) begins with a gastrointestinal phase occurring 10–24 hours after ingestion, followed by multiple organ dysfunction occurring 24 hours to 7 days after ingestion, after which the affected person either declines into multiple organ failure or recovers over several weeks.

Colchicine can be toxic when ingested, inhaled, or absorbed in the eyes. It can cause a temporary clouding of the cornea and be absorbed into the body, causing systemic toxicity. Symptoms of colchicine overdose start 2 to 24 hours after the toxic dose has been ingested, and include burning in the mouth and throat, fever, vomiting, diarrhea, and abdominal pain. This can cause hypovolemic shock due to extreme vascular damage and fluid loss through the gastrointestinal tract, which can be fatal.

If the affected persons survive the gastrointestinal phase of toxicity, they may experience multiple organ failure and critical illness. This includes kidney damage, which causes low urine output and bloody urine; low white blood cell counts that can last for several days; anemia; muscular weakness; liver failure; hepatomegaly; bone marrow suppression; thrombocytopenia; and ascending paralysis leading to potentially fatal respiratory failure. Neurologic symptoms are also evident, including seizures, confusion, and delirium; children may experience hallucinations. Recovery may begin within six to eight days and begins with rebound leukocytosis and alopecia as organ functions return to normal.

Long-term exposure to colchicine can lead to toxicity, particularly of the bone marrow, kidney, and nerves. Effects of long-term colchicine toxicity include agranulocytosis, thrombocytopenia, low white blood cell counts, aplastic anemia, alopecia, rash, purpura, vesicular dermatitis, kidney damage, anuria, peripheral neuropathy, and myopathy.

No specific antidote for colchicine is known, but supportive care is used in cases of overdose. In the immediate period after an overdose, monitoring for gastrointestinal symptoms, cardiac dysrhythmias, and respiratory depression is appropriate, and may require gastrointestinal decontamination with activated charcoal or gastric lavage.

Because colchicine is so toxic, chemists are continuing to try to synthesize derivatives of the molecule that decrease the toxicity. The most important aspect of these derivatives is that they keep the tropolone ring (the ring with the methoxy group and the carbonyl) intact to retain the mechanistic properties of the molecule.

===Mechanism of toxicity===
With overdoses, colchicine becomes toxic as an extension of its cellular mechanism of action via binding to tubulin. Cells so affected undergo impaired protein assembly with reduced endocytosis, exocytosis, cellular motility, and interrupted function of heart cells, culminating in multiple organ failure.

=== Epidemiology ===
In the United States, several hundred cases of colchicine toxicity are reported annually, about 10% of which end with serious morbidity or mortality. Many of these cases are intentional overdoses, but others were accidental; for example, if the drug were not dosed appropriately for kidney function. Most cases of colchicine toxicity occur in adults. Many of these adverse events resulted from the use of intravenous colchicine.

== Drug interactions ==
Colchicine interacts with the P-glycoprotein transporter, and the CYP3A4 enzyme involved in drug and toxin metabolism. Fatal drug interactions have occurred when colchicine was taken with other drugs that inhibit P-glycoprotein and CYP3A4, such as erythromycin or clarithromycin.

People taking macrolide antibiotics, ketoconazole, or cyclosporine, or those who have liver or kidney disease, should not take colchicine, as these drugs and conditions may interfere with colchicine metabolism and raise its blood levels, potentially increasing its toxicity abruptly. Symptoms of toxicity include gastrointestinal upset, fever, muscle pain, low blood cell counts, and organ failure. People with HIV/AIDS taking atazanavir, darunavir, fosamprenavir, indinavir, lopinavir, nelfinavir, ritonavir, or saquinavir may experience colchicine toxicity. Grapefruit juice and statins can also increase colchicine concentrations.

==Pharmacology==

===Mechanism of action===
In gout, inflammation in joints results from the precipitation of uric acid as needle-like crystals of monosodium urate in and around synovial fluid and soft tissues of joints. These crystal deposits cause inflammatory arthritis, which is initiated and sustained by mechanisms involving various proinflammatory mediators, such as cytokines. Colchicine accumulates in white blood cells and affects them in a variety of ways - decreasing motility, mobilization (especially chemotaxis), and adhesion.

Under preliminary research are various mechanisms by which colchicine may interfere with gout inflammation:

* Inhibits microtubule polymerization by binding to its constitutive protein, tubulin
* As availability of tubulin is essential to mitosis, colchicine may inhibit mitosis
* Inhibits activation and migration of neutrophils to sites of inflammation
* Interferes with the inflammasome complex found in neutrophils and monocytes that mediate interleukin-1β activation, a component of inflammation
* Inhibits superoxide anion production in response to urate crystals
* Interrupts mast cell and lysosome degranulation
* Inhibits release of glycoproteins that promote chemotaxis from synovial cells and neutrophils

Generally, colchicine appears to inhibit multiple proinflammatory mechanisms, while enabling increased levels of anti-inflammatory mediators. Apart from inhibiting mitosis, colchicine inhibits neutrophil motility and activity, leading to a net anti-inflammatory effect, which has efficacy for inhibiting or preventing gout inflammation.

===Pharmacokinetics===
Colchicine appears to be a peripherally selective drug with limited brain uptake due to binding to P-glycoprotein.

== History ==
The plant source of colchicine, the autumn crocus (&quot;Colchicum autumnale&quot;), was described for treatment of rheumatism and swelling in the Ebers Papyrus (&quot;circa&quot; 1500 BC), an Egyptian medical text. It is a toxic alkaloid and secondary metabolite. &quot;Colchicum&quot; extract was first described as a treatment for gout in &quot;De Materia Medica&quot; by Pedanius Dioscorides, in the first century AD. Use of the bulb-like corms of &quot;Colchicum&quot; to treat gout probably dates to around 550 AD, as the &quot;hermodactyl&quot; recommended by Alexander of Tralles. &quot;Colchicum&quot; corms were used by the Persian physician Avicenna, and were recommended by Ambroise Paré in the 16th century, and appeared in the &quot;London Pharmacopoeia&quot; of 1618. &quot;Colchicum&quot; use waned over time, likely due to the severe gastrointestinal side effects preparations caused. In 1763, &quot;Colchicum&quot; was recorded as a remedy for dropsy (now called edema) among other illnesses. &quot;Colchicum&quot; plants were brought to North America by Benjamin Franklin, who had gout himself and had written humorous doggerel about the disease during his stint as United States Ambassador to France.

Colchicine was first isolated in 1820 by French chemists P. S. Pelletier and J. B. Caventou. In 1833, P. L. Geiger purified an active ingredient, which he named colchicine. It quickly became a popular remedy for gout. The determination of colchicine&#x27;s structure required decades, although in 1945, Michael Dewar made an important contribution when he suggested that, among the molecule&#x27;s three rings, two were seven-member rings. Its pain-relieving and anti-inflammatory effects for gout were linked to its ability to bind with tubulin.

The full synthesis of colchicine was achieved by the Swiss organic chemist Albert Eschenmoser in 1959. 

===United States ===

====Colcrys, the Unapproved Drugs Initiative, and controversy====

In 2006, US Food and Drug Administration (FDA) announced a safety program called the Unapproved Drugs Initiative—through which the FDA sought more rigorous testing of efficacy and safety of colchicine and other unapproved drugs. This program was in response to multiple deaths caused by &quot;unapproved products.&quot;. After the Federal Food, Drug, and Cosmetic Act was signed into law in June 24, 1938, the FDA had the regulatory authority to mandate drugs be reviewed for safety prior to approval. Drugs approved before June 24, 1938, were grandfathered, as long as their manufacturing, ingredients, and labeling remained unchanged. In 1962, the Kefauver-Harris Amendment to the FD&amp;C Act gave the FDA the authority to also require efficacy as a condition for drug approval. Drugs approved after June 24, 1938, but before 1962 had a limited time to be reviewed for efficacy to remain on the market. This was known as the Drug Efficacy Study Implementation (DESI). As of today there are only a handful of drugs still on the DESI list and in 2006, the FDA stated it was not aware of any grandfathered drugs.

By 2006, URL Pharma decided to research colchicine to see if this unapproved product could gain legal FDA approval. Colchicine was a narrow therapeutic index drug that was implicated in numerous death leading to the FDA forcefully removing injectable colchicine from the US Market. At this time oral colchicine was being used to treat gout attacks. The only placebo control trial conducted using colchicine for acute gout attacks instructed physicians to give colchicine until pain relief or toxicity. All patients on the colchicine arm had adverse events. Despite its toxicity, unapproved oral colchicine was still prescribed using this dosing regimen. In addition, at this time, oral colchicine was also used to treat the often fatal disease Familial Mediterranean fever (FMF).

In July 2009, the FDA approved colchicine as a monotherapy for the treatment of three different indications (familial Mediterranean fever, acute gout flares, and for the prophylaxis of gout flares). This resulted in a 3-year regulatory market exclusivity in the acute and chronic gout indications and a 7-year exclusivity on the FMF indication. In addition, there are 17 patents on colchicine, listed in the FDA Orange Book which may confer additional exclusivity. 

At the time of approval, there were no FDA-approved single-agent colchicine products (brand or generic) in the United States. The unapproved, illegally marketed colchicine products were forcibly removed by the FDA in October 2010. 

===== Controversy =====
The events that led to the approval of Colcrys, the clearance of the illegally sold non-FDA approved colchicine products, Colcrys pricing, and the sale of URL Pharma still are controversial today.

Before the Colcrys approval, unapproved colchicine products were being illegally sold in the United States for under 10 cents a pill. These products were also labeled in an unsafe manner and not manufactured under FDA inspection. URL conducted one Phase 3 clinical trial and at least 12 other trials to gain the approval of Colcrys. URL Pharma priced Colcrys at $4.85 a pill drawing the ire of many groups. 

In 2012, Asia&#x27;s biggest drugmaker, Takeda Pharmaceutical Co., acquired URL Pharma for $800 million including the rights to Colcrys.

==Sources and uses==
===Physical properties===
Colchicine has a melting point of 142-150 °C. It has a molecular weight of 399.4 grams per mole.

=== Structure ===
Colchicine has one stereocenter located at carbon 7. The natural configuration of this stereocenter is S. The molecule also contains one chiral axis - the single bond between rings A and C. The natural configuration of this axis is aS. Although colchicine has four stereoisomers, the only one found in nature is the aS,7s configuration.

===Light sensitivity===
Colchicine is a light-sensitive compound, so needs to be stored in a dark bottle. Upon exposure to light, colchicine undergoes photoisomerization and transforms into structural isomers, called lumicolchicine. After this transformation, colchicine is no longer effective in its mechanistic binding to tubulin, so is not effective as a drug.

===Regulation===
It is classified as an extremely hazardous substance in the United States as defined in Section 302 of the U.S. Emergency Planning and Community Right-to-Know Act (42 U.S.C. 11002) and is subject to strict reporting requirements by facilities that produce, store, or use it in significant quantities.

===Formulations and dosing===
Trade names for colchicine are Colcrys or Mitigare, which are manufactured as a dark– and light-blue capsule having a dose of 0.6 mg. Colchicine is also prepared as a white, yellow, or purple pill (tablet) having a dose of 0.6 mg.

Colchicine is typically prescribed to mitigate or prevent the onset of gout, or its continuing symptoms and pain, using a low-dose prescription of 0.6 to 1.2 mg per day, or a high-dose amount of up to 4.8 mg in the first 6 hours of a gout episode. With an oral dose of 0.6 mg, peak blood levels occur within one to two hours. For treating gout, the initial effects of colchicine occur in a window of 12 to 24 hours, with a peak within 48 to 72 hours. It has a narrow therapeutic window, requiring monitoring of the subject for potential toxicity. Colchicine is not a general pain-relief drug, and is not used to treat pain in other disorders.

===Biosynthesis===
According to laboratory research, the biosynthesis of colchicine involves the amino acids phenylalanine and tyrosine as precursors. Giving radioactive phenylalanine-2-14C to &quot;C. byzantinum&quot;, another plant of the family Colchicaceae, resulted in its incorporation into colchicine. However, the tropolone ring of colchicine resulted from the expansion of the tyrosine ring. Radioactive feeding experiments of &quot;C. autumnale&quot; revealed that colchicine can be synthesized biosynthetically from &quot;(S)&quot;-autumnaline. That biosynthetic pathway occurs primarily through a phenolic coupling reaction involving the intermediate isoandrocymbine. The resulting molecule undergoes &quot;O&quot;-methylation directed by S-adenosylmethionine. Two oxidation steps followed by the cleavage of the cyclopropane ring lead to the formation of the tropolone ring contained by &quot;N&quot;-formyldemecolcine. &quot;N&quot;-formyldemecolcine hydrolyzes then to generate the molecule demecolcine, which also goes through an oxidative demethylation that generates deacetylcolchicine. The molecule of colchicine appears finally after the addition of acetyl-coenzyme A to deacetylcolchicine.

=== Purification ===
Colchicine may be purified from &quot;Colchicum autumnale&quot; (autumn crocus) or &quot;Gloriosa superba&quot; (glory lily). Concentrations of colchicine in &quot;C. autumnale&quot; peak in the summer, and range from 0.1% in the flower to 0.8% in the bulb and seeds.

===Botanical use and seedless fruit===

Colchicine is used in plant breeding by inducing polyploidy in plant cells to produce new or improved varieties, strains, and cultivars. When used to induce polyploidy in plants, colchicine cream is usually applied to a growth point of the plant, such as an apical tip, shoot, or sucker. Seeds can be presoaked in a colchicine solution before planting. Since chromosome segregation is driven by microtubules, colchicine alters cellular division by inhibiting chromosome segregation during mitosis; half the resulting daughter cells, therefore, contain no chromosomes, while the other half contains double the usual number of chromosomes (i.e., tetraploid instead of diploid), and lead to cell nuclei with double the usual number of chromosomes (i.e., tetraploid instead of diploid). While this would be fatal in most higher animal cells, in plant cells, it is not only usually well-tolerated, but also frequently results in larger, hardier, faster-growing, and in general more desirable plants than the normally diploid parents. For this reason, this type of genetic manipulation is frequently used in breeding plants commercially.

When such a tetraploid plant is crossed with a diploid plant, the triploid offspring are usually sterile (unable to produce fertile seeds or spores), although many triploids can be propagated vegetatively. Growers of annual triploid plants not readily propagated vegetatively cannot produce a second-generation crop from the seeds (if any) of the triploid crop and need to buy triploid seed from a supplier each year. Many sterile triploid plants, including some trees and shrubs, are becoming increasingly valued in horticulture and landscaping because they do not become invasive species and do not drop undesirable fruit and seed litter. In certain species, colchicine-induced triploidy has been used to create &quot;seedless&quot; fruit, such as seedless watermelons (&quot;Citrullus lanatus&quot;). Since most triploids do not produce pollen themselves, such plants usually require cross-pollination with a diploid parent to induce seedless fruit production.

The ability of colchicine to induce polyploidy can be also exploited to render infertile hybrids fertile, for example in breeding triticale (× &quot;Triticosecale&quot;) from wheat (&quot;Triticum&quot; spp.) and rye (&quot;Secale cereale&quot;). Wheat is typically tetraploid and rye diploid, with their triploid hybrid infertile; treatment of triploid triticale with colchicine gives fertile hexaploid triticale.

<text>Susan Meiselas (born June 21, 1948) is an American documentary photographer. She has been associated with Magnum Photos since 1976 and been a full member since 1980. Currently she is the President of the Magnum Foundation. She is best known for her 1970s photographs of war-torn Nicaragua and American carnival strippers.

Meiselas has published several books of her own photographs and has edited and contributed to others. Her works have been published in newspapers and magazines including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;The Times&quot;, &quot;Time&quot;, &quot;GEO,&quot; and &quot;Paris Match&quot;. She received the Robert Capa Gold Medal in 1979 and was named a MacArthur Fellow in 1992. In 2006, she was awarded The Royal Photographic Society&#x27;s Centenary Medal and Honorary Fellowship and in 2019 the Deutsche Börse Photography Foundation Prize.

After a relationship that spanned more than thirty years, she married filmmaker Richard P. Rogers shortly before his death in 2001.

==Early life and education==
Meiselas was born on June 21, 1948, in Baltimore, Maryland. She attended junior high school in Woodmere, New York. She earned her Bachelor of Arts in 1970 from Sarah Lawrence College and a Master of Arts in visual education from Harvard University, where she was a student of Barbara Norfleet. She received honorary Doctorates in Fine Arts from the Parsons School in 1986 and The Art Institute of Boston in 1996.

==Career==
After earning her masters degree from Harvard University, Meiselas was an assistant film editor on the Frederick Wiseman documentary &quot;Basic Training&quot;. From 1972 to 1974, she worked for New York City public schools, running workshops for teachers and children in the Bronx and designing photography curricula for 4th–6th graders. In the mid-1970s, Meiselas began working on a project she later titled the &quot;Prince Street Girls&quot;, a series that features young and adolescent girls from Little Italy in New York City. She also worked for the State Arts Commissions of South Carolina and Mississippi setting up photography programs in rural schools and served as a consultant to Polaroid and the Center for Understanding Media in New York City.

Her first major photography project documented strippers at New England fairs and carnivals, which she worked on during summers while teaching in the New York City public schools. The project resulted in an exhibition at the Whitney Museum and a book, &quot;Carnival Strippers,&quot; that incorporated audio interviews with the subjects on a CD packaged with the book.

In the late 1970s, Meiselas documented the insurrection in Nicaragua and human rights issues in Latin America. Her most notable photograph from this project was &quot;Molotov Man,&quot; which depicts a man (later identified as Pablo &#x27;Bareta&#x27; Aruaz) poised to throw a molotov cocktail made from a Pepsi bottle in his right hand, while holding a rifle in his left hand. It became a symbol of the Sandinista revolution and was widely reproduced and remixed in Nicaragua. Latterly, outside this context, it was reproduced via an Internet meme based on Joy Garnett&#x27;s 2003 painting &quot;Molotov,&quot; thus becoming a prominent case-study of the appropriation, transformation, and quotation in art. Her photographs of the Nicaraguan Revolution have been incorporated into local textbooks in Nicaragua. Her 1991 documentary film, &quot;Pictures from a Revolution,&quot; depicts her return to sites she photographed and conversations with subjects of the photographs as they reflect on the images ten years after the war. In 2004, Meiselas returned to Nicaragua to install nineteen mural-size images of her photographs at the locations where they were taken. The project was called &quot;Reframing History.&quot;

In 1981, she visited a village destroyed by government forces in El Salvador and took pictures of the El Mozote massacre, working with journalists Raymond Bonner and Alma Guillermoprieto.

Beginning in 1992, Meiselas used MacArthur Foundation funding to curate a photographic history of Kurdistan, resulting in the book &quot;Kurdistan: In the Shadow of History&quot; and a corresponding website, akaKurdistan.

In a 2008 interview with Phong Bui in &quot;The Brooklyn Rail&quot;, Meiselas says:

I don&#x27;t want to relinquish the role and the necessity of witnessing and the photographic act as a response, a responsible response. But I also don&#x27;t want to assume in a kind of naïve way … that the act of the making of the image is enough. What&#x27;s enough? And what can we know in this process of making, publishing, reproducing, exposing, and recontextualizing work in book or exhibition form? … I can only hope that it registers a number of questions.

Over several months in 2015 and 2016, Meiselas worked on a project about women in refuges in the Black Country area of the West Midlands, England. The project was made in collaboration with Multistory, a local community arts charity, which published a book of the work, &quot;A Room of Their Own&quot; (2017).

<text>Indore (; ISO: , ) is the largest and most populous city in the Indian state of Madhya Pradesh. It is the commercial hub of Madhya Pradesh. It is consistently ranked as the cleanest city in India. It serves as the headquarters of both the Indore District and the Indore Division. It is also considered the state education hub and houses campuses of both the Indian Institute of Technology and the Indian Institute of Management. Located on the southern edge of Malwa Plateau, at an average altitude of above sea level, it has the highest elevation among major cities of Central India. The city is west of the state capital of Bhopal. It is 57 km (35 mi) from Ujjain and 35 km (20 mi) from Dewas. Indore had a census-estimated 2011 population of 1,994,397 (municipal corporation) and 3,570,295 (urban agglomeration). The city is distributed over a land area of just , making Indore the most densely populated major city in the central province.

Modern-day Indore traces its roots to its 16th-century founding as a trading hub between the Deccan and Delhi. It was founded on the banks of the Kanh and Saraswati rivers. The city came under the Maratha Empire, on 18 May 1724, after Peshwa Baji Rao I assumed the full control of Malwa. During the days of the British Raj, Indore State was a 19 Gun Salute (21 locally) princely state (a rare high rank) ruled by the Maratha Holkar dynasty, until they acceded to the Union of India.

Indore functions as the financial capital of Madhya Pradesh and was home to the Madhya Pradesh Stock Exchange till its derecognition in 2015.

Indore has been selected as one of the 100 Indian cities to be developed as a smart city under the Smart Cities Mission. It also qualified in the first round of Smart Cities Mission and was selected as one of the first twenty cities to be developed as Smart Cities. Indore has been part of the Swachh Survekshan since its inception and had ranked 25th in 2016. It has been ranked as India&#x27;s cleanest city seven years in a row as per the Swachh Survekshan for the years 2017, 2018, 2019, 2020, 2021, 2022 and 2023. Meanwhile, Indore has also been declared as India&#x27;s first &#x27;water plus&#x27; city under the Swachhta Survekshan 2021. Indore became the only Indian city to be selected for International Clean Air Catalyst Programme. The project, with cooperation of the Indore Municipal Corporation and the Madhya Pradesh Pollution Control Board, will be operated for a period of five years to purify the air in the city. Indore will penalise anyone giving alms to beggars starting 1 January 2025, expanding a previous ban on giving to child beggars. This initiative aims to eradicate begging, with officials claiming it disrupts the begging cycle.

==Etymology==
Gupta inscriptions name Indore as &quot;Indrapura&quot;. It is believed that the city is named after its Indreshwar Mahadev Temple, where Shiva is the presiding deity. It is believed that Indra himself did &quot;Tapasya&quot; (meditation) in this place and led sage Swami Indrapuri to establish the temple. Later, Tukoji Rao Holkar who belonged to the Holkar clan of the Marathas and was the feudatory of Indore, renovated the temple.

==History==
===Gupta Empire (Gupta Era)===
Gupta Empire inscription mentions Indore as city/town of Indrapura in Gupta Indore Copper plate inscription dated 146 Gupta era or 465 CE. These are also some of the earliest mentions of Indore where the city is mentioned as &#x27;Indrapura&#x27;. Indrapura (modern day Indore) was then known for its sun temple, where in 464–65 CE, Gupta king Skandagupta had made an endowment for the permanent maintenance of the city&#x27;s sun temple. The temple was constructed by two merchants of the city – Achalavarman and Bhṛikuṇṭhasiṁha.

=== Holkar Era (Maratha Empire)===
During the Mughal era, the area under the modern Indore district was equally divided between the administrations (&quot;sarkar&quot;s) of Ujjain and Mandu. Kampel was the headquarters of a &quot;mahal&quot; (administrative unit) under the Ujjain &quot;sarkar&quot; of Malwa Subah (province). The area of the modern Indore city was included in the Kampel pargana (administrative unit).

In 1715, the Marathas invaded this region (Mughal territory) and demanded chauth (tax) from the Mughal &quot;Amil&quot; (administrator) of Kampel. The Amil fled to Ujjain, and the local zamindars agreed to pay Chauth to the Marathas. The chief zamindar, Nandlal Chaudhary (later known as Nandlal Mandloi), paid a chauth of around Rs. 25,000 to the Marathas. Jai Singh II, the Mughal Governor of Malwa, reached Kampel on 8 May 1715, and defeated the Marathas in a battle near the village. The Marathas came back in early 1716, and raided Kampel in 1717. In March 1718, the Marathas, led by Santaji Bhonsale, invaded Malwa again, but were unsuccessful this time.

By 1720, the headquarters of the local pargana were transferred from Kampel to Indore, due to the increasing commercial activity in the city. In 1724, the Marathas under the new Peshwa Baji Rao I, launched a fresh attack on the Mughals in Malwa. Baji Rao I himself led the campaign, accompanied by his lieutenants Udaji Rao Pawar, Malhar Rao Holkar and Ranoji Scindia. The Mughal Nizam met the Peshwa at Nalchha on 18 May 1724, and acceded to his demand of collecting chauth from the area. The Peshwa returned to the Deccan, but left Malhar Rao Holkar at Indore to oversee the chauth collection.

The Marathas maintained friendly relations with Nandlal Chaudhary, who held influence over the local Sardars (chiefs). In 1728, they defeated the Mughals decisively in the battle of Amjhera, and consolidated their authority in the area over the next few years. On 3 October 1730, Malhar Rao Holkar was appointed as the Maratha chief of Malwa. The local zamindars, who had the title of Chaudhari, came to be known as &quot;Mandloi&quot;s (after mandal, an administrative unit) during the Maratha reign. The Holkar dynasty of the Marathas, which controlled the region, conferred the title of &quot;Rao&quot; upon the local zamindar family.
After Nandlal died, his son Tejkarana was accepted as the &quot;Mandloi&quot; of Kampel by the Peshwa Baji Rao I. The pargana was formally granted to Malhar Rao Holkar by merging 28 and one-half Pargana by the Peshwa in 1733. The pargana headquarters were transferred back to Kampel during his reign. After his death, his daughter-in-law Ahilyabai Holkar moved the headquarters to Indore in 1766. The tehsil of Kampel was converted into Indore tehsil by a change in the name.
Ahilyabai Holkar moved the state&#x27;s capital to Maheshwar in 1767, but Indore remained an important commercial and military centre.

===Princely State (Indore/Holkar State)===

Ahalyabai Holkar is fondly remembered as a noble, saintly and courageous woman. She ruled the kingdom of Indore (which was then part of the wider Maratha Empire) for several decades. Her rule is remembered as a golden age in Indore&#x27;s history. From an agricultural background herself, she married Khande Rao, prince of Indore. Thereafter, she resided in the Royal Palace. Later, she was trained in statecraft and accompanied the army to war on many occasions. At that time the Maratha Empire (which was founded by Chhatrapati Shivaji Raje Bhonsale) was at the apex of its power. There were frequent battles and skirmishes, both against foreigners as well as internal feuds. In one such battle in 1754, Ahalyabai&#x27;s husband was killed. Her aged father-in-law (Malhar Rao) was shattered at the death of his son. He summoned Ahalyabai, who he loved deeply, and said: &quot;You are now my son. I wish that you look after my kingdom&quot;.Malhar Rao Holkar died in 1766, 12 years after the death of his son Khande Rao. Malhar Rao&#x27;s grandson and Khande Rao&#x27;s only son Male Rao Holkar became the ruler of Indore in 1766, under Ahilya Bai&#x27;s regency, but he too died within few months in April 1767. Ahilya Bai became the ruler of Indore after the death of her son with Khande Rao. Ahilya Bai was a great pioneer and builder of Hindu temples who constructed hundreds of temples and Dharmashalas throughout India. She is specially renowned for refurbishing and reconsecrating some of the most sacred sites of Hindu pilgrimage that had been desecrated and demolished in the previous century by the Mughal Emperor Aurangzeb including:

* Kashi Vishwanath Temple 
* Ayodhya – Construction of Shri Rama Temple, Sarayu Ghat
* Badrinath – Construction of Shri Kedareshwar Temple and Hari Temple, Dharamshalas (at Rangdachati, Bidarchati, Vyasaganga, Tunganath, Pawali), construction of many kundas (at Gaurkund, Kundachatri), a garden and a kunda of warm water at Devprayag, pastoral land for cows 
* Dwarka – Mohatajkhana, Pooja House and donation of some villages to the priests of the Dwarkadhish Temple
* Kedarnath – Dharmashala and Kund)
* Omkareshwar – Renovation of the temples of Mamaleshwar Mahadev, Amaleshwar and Trambakeshwar Temples, completing the construction of Gauri-Somnath temple, construction of a Dharmashala &amp; pond, donation of a silver mask for adoration of the Shivalinga 
* Rameswaram – Construction of Hanumana Temple, Shri Radha Krishna Temple, a Dharmashala, Well &amp; Garden and many more.

In 1818, the Holkars were defeated by the British during the Third Anglo-Maratha War, in the Battle of Mahidpur by which the capital was again moved from Maheshwar to Indore. A residency with British residents was established at Indore, but Holkars continued to rule Indore State as a princely state mainly due to efforts of their Dewan Tatya Jog. During that time, Indore has established the headquarters of the British Central Agency. Ujjain was originally the commercial centre of Malwa. But the British administrators such as John Malcolm decided to promote Indore as an alternative to Ujjain because the merchants of Ujjain had supported anti-British elements.

In 1906 electric supply was started in the city, the fire brigade was established in 1909, and 1918, the first master-plan of the city was made by noted architect and town planner, Patrick Geddes. During the period of Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar II (1852–86) efforts were made for the planned development and industrial development of Indore. With the introduction of Railways in 1875, the business in Indore flourished during the reigns of Maharaja Shivaji Rao Holkar, Maharaja Tukoji Rao Holkar III and Maharaja Yeshwant Rao Holkar.

The Holkar State Darbar (Court) was composed of many Jagirdars, Sardars, Istamuradars, Mankaris and Zamindars.

=== Post-independence ===

After India&#x27;s independence in 1947, Holkar State, along with several neighbouring princely states, acceded to the Indian Union. On 1 November 1956, when Madhya Bharat was merged into Madhya Pradesh, Indore became part of the newly formed state.

<text>Armand Borel (21 May 1923 – 11 August 2003) was a Swiss mathematician, born in La Chaux-de-Fonds, and was a permanent professor at the Institute for Advanced Study in Princeton, New Jersey, United States from 1957 to 1993. He worked in algebraic topology, in the theory of Lie groups, and was one of the creators of the contemporary theory of linear algebraic groups.

==Biography==
He studied at the ETH Zürich, where he came under the influence of the topologist Heinz Hopf and Lie-group theorist Eduard Stiefel. He was in Paris from 1949: he applied the Leray spectral sequence to the topology of Lie groups and their classifying spaces, under the influence of Jean Leray and Henri Cartan. With Hirzebruch, he significantly developed the theory of characteristic classes in the early 1950s.

He collaborated with Jacques Tits in fundamental work on algebraic groups, and with Harish-Chandra on their arithmetic subgroups. In an algebraic group &quot;G&quot; a &quot;Borel subgroup&quot; &quot;H&quot; is one minimal with respect to the property that the homogeneous space &quot;G/H&quot; is a projective variety. For example, if &quot;G&quot; is GL&quot;n&quot; then we can take &quot;H&quot; to be the subgroup of upper triangular matrices. In this case it turns out that H is a maximal solvable subgroup, and that the parabolic subgroups &quot;P&quot; between &quot;H&quot; and &quot;G&quot; have a combinatorial structure (in this case the homogeneous spaces &quot;G/P&quot; are the various flag manifolds). Both those aspects generalize, and play a central role in the theory.

The Borel−Moore homology theory applies to general locally compact spaces, and is closely related to sheaf theory.

He published a number of books, including a work on the history of Lie groups. In 1978 he received the Brouwer Medal and in 1992 he was awarded the Balzan Prize &quot;For his fundamental contributions to the theory of Lie groups, algebraic groups and arithmetic groups, and for his indefatigable action in favour of high quality in mathematical research and the propagation of new ideas&quot; (motivation of the Balzan General Prize Committee). He was a member of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, the United States National Academy of Sciences, and the American Philosophical Society.

He died in Princeton. He used to answer the question of whether he was related to Émile Borel alternately by saying he was a nephew, and no relation.

<text>Athanasios &quot;Thanos&quot; Mikroutsikos (; 13 April 1947 – 28 December 2019) was a Greek composer and politician. He is considered one of the most important composers of the recent Greek musical scene.

==Biography==

===Personal life===
He was born on 13 April 1947 in Patra. He was the older brother of Andreas Mikroutsikos, who is also a musician/composer and a television show host. His wife was children&#x27;s author Maria Papagianni, whom he married in 1996. He died on 28 December 2019, after a long fight with cancer, at age 72.

===Music===
He studied piano and composition in the Philharmonic Society of Patras, in the Hellenic Conservatory, and privately with Yiannis Papaioannou. In addition, he studied Mathematics in the National and Kapodistrian University of Athens. He began composing at the end of the 1960s but only officially debuted in 1975, with the release of his album &quot;Politika Tragoudia&quot; (&#x27;Political Songs&#x27;). He continued on this compositional path, setting to music the poems of Giannis Ritsos, Vladimir Mayakovsky, Manos Eleftheriou and Bertold Brecht, amongst others.

His albums &quot;Kantata gia ti Makroniso&quot; (&quot;Cantata for Makronisos&quot;), &quot;Fouente Ovehouna&quot; (&quot;Fuenteovejuna&quot;), &quot;Troparia gia Foniades&quot; (&quot;Hymns for Murderers&quot;) and &quot;Mousiki Praxi Ston Brecht&quot; (&quot;Musical Practice on Brecht&quot;) are characteristic of the climate of Metapolitefsi or Regime Change that was taking place in the period 1975–78. In particular, the &quot;Cantata for Makronisos&quot;, a pioneering piece in which Mikroutsikos experimented with atonality was extremely well received in international music festivals and an interpretation of particular note was recorded by Maria Dimitriadi.

His next album, &quot;Stavros tou Notou&quot; (&quot;Southern Cross&quot;), set to the poetry of Nikos Kavvadias, opened up further musical avenues for him, combining theatre, electronic music and atonality (a second album, &quot;Grammes ton orizondon&quot;, set to the poetry of Kavvadias was released in 1991). With the same devotion to poetry, he continued to set the works of Giannis Ritsos, Alkis Alkaios, François Villon and Constantine P. Cavafy, amongst others. In addition, he has written an opera, &quot;Eleni&quot; (&quot;Helen&quot;) and set to music several children&#x27;s fairytales.

He has worked with many renowned singers such as Maria Dimitriadi, Haris Alexiou, Manolis Mitsias, Dimitris Mitropanos, George Dalaras, Vasilis Papakonstantinou, Christos Thibaios, Miltiadis Paschalidis, Rita Antonopoulou and Giannis Koutras, amongst others. His music has been particularly well received and recognised in Western Europe. During his compositional career, he has managed to liberate the form of Greek song, adding together elements from the modernist and classical western tradition. He also experimented with the combination of tonal and atonal sounds and with morphological variation.

He was artistic director of the New Music Society and the Musical Analogion, whilst he also worked with and directed the Patras International Festival.

===Politics===

He was involved in Greece&#x27;s political life since the 1960s. During the turbulent years of the Greek military junta of 1967–1974, he was persecuted by the regime for his anti-dictatorial activities and ideas. When the junta collapsed, he continued being actively involved in politics as a member of the maoist EKKE, especially in the first years after the restoration of democracy.

After the elections of October 1993, he was appointed as Deputy Minister of Culture by the new Panhellenic Socialist Movement (PASOK) government, serving alongside the late Melina Mercouri who was Minister of Culture. He was appointed to Mercouri&#x27;s position when she died in 1994, a position he kept until 1996.

He was a supporter of the Communist Party of Greece.

<text>The Buteyko method or Buteyko breathing technique is a form of complementary or alternative physical therapy that proposes the use of breathing exercises primarily as a treatment for asthma and other respiratory conditions.

Buteyko asserts that numerous medical conditions, including asthma, are caused or exacerbated by chronically increased respiratory rate or hyperventilation. The method aims to correct hyperventilation and encourage shallower, slower breathing. Treatments include a series of reduced-breathing exercises that focus on nasal-breathing, breath-holding and relaxation.

Advocates of the Buteyko method claim that it can alleviate symptoms and reliance on medication for patients with asthma, chronic obstructive pulmonary disease (COPD), and chronic hyperventilation. The medical community questions these claims, given limited and inadequate evidence supporting the theory and efficacy of the method.

== History ==
The Buteyko method was originally developed in the 1950s by physiologist Konstantin Buteyko in the Soviet Union.

The first official study into the effectiveness of the Buteyko method on asthma was undertaken in 1968 at the Leningrad Institute of Pulmonology. The second, held at the First Moscow Institute of Pediatric Diseases in April 1980, eventually led to the head of the ministry of health to issue an order (No 591) for the implementation of the Buteyko method in the treatment of bronchial asthma. Later, this method was introduced to Australia, New Zealand, Britain and the United States, where it has received increasing exposure. Anecdotal reports of life-changing improvements attributed to the Buteyko method abound on the Internet and in books.

The Buteyko method is one of a number of breathing retraining methods in use for treating lung diseases, including conventional techniques such as physiotherapist-led breathing exercises as well as alternative medicine techniques such as yoga.

In 2019, the popular Indonesian singer Andien posted images of herself, her husband and their two-year-old son with tape over their mouths on social media. The pictures prompted discussion and interest in the Buteyko method.

== Method ==
The Buteyko method emphasizes the role of carbon dioxide and hyperventilation in respiratory diseases as well as overall health. It is known that hyperventilation can lead to low carbon dioxide levels in the blood (or hypocapnea), which can subsequently lead to disturbances of the acid-base balance in the blood and lower tissue oxygen levels. Advocates of this method assert that the effects of &quot;chronic&quot; hyperventilation have wider effects than is commonly accepted. These effects include widespread spasms of the muscle in the airways (bronchospasm), disturbance of cell energy production via the Krebs cycle, as well as disturbance of numerous vital homeostatic chemical reactions in the body. The Buteyko method purports to retrain the body&#x27;s breathing pattern to correct for the presumed &quot;chronic&quot; hyperventilation and hypocapnia, thereby treating or curing the body of these medical problems.

The Buteyko method is not widely supported in the medical community, in part due to the lack of research supporting the theory that hyperventilation and hypocapnia causes disease, with one review noting the absence of convincing evidence to indicate that trying to change asthmatics&#x27; carbon dioxide level is either &quot;desirable or achievable.&quot; Some studies that looked to corroborate the theory sought evidence such as by measuring the carbon dioxide levels in practitioners of Buteyko but failed to find conclusive support, leading some to propose alternate theoretical pathways for this method to improve symptoms.

Although variations exist among teachers of the technique in different countries, the main objective is &quot;normalization&quot; of breathing and the three core principles of Buteyko remain the same: nasal breathing, reduced breathing, and relaxation.

=== Nasal breathing ===

The Buteyko method emphasizes the importance of nasal breathing, which protects the airways by humidifying, warming, and cleaning the air entering the lungs. Many asthmatics have problems sleeping at night, and this is thought by Buteyko practitioners to be linked with poor posture and/or mouth breathing. By keeping the nose clear and encouraging nasal breathing during the day, night-time symptoms can also improve. Strictly nasal breathing during physical exercise is another key element of the Buteyko method.

=== Reduced breathing exercises ===

The core Buteyko exercises involve breath control: consciously reducing either breathing rate or breathing volume. Many teachers refer to Buteyko as &#x27;breathing retraining&#x27; and compare the method to learning to ride a bicycle. They say that after adequate practice time, the techniques become instinctive and the exercises are gradually phased out as the condition improves.

Buteyko uses a measurement called the &quot;control pause&quot; (CP), the amount of time between breaths that an individual can comfortably hold breath. According to Buteyko teachers, people with asthma who regularly practice Buteyko breathing will notice an increase in CP and decrease in pulse rate that corresponds to decreased asthma symptoms.

=== Relaxation ===

Buteyko practice emphasizes relaxation to counter asthma attacks. The first feeling of an asthma attack is unsettling and can result in a short period of rapid breathing. Buteyko method claims that by controlling this initial over-breathing phase, asthmatics can prevent a &quot;vicious circle of over-breathing&quot; from developing and spiraling into an asthma attack.

== Medical evidence ==
Advocates of the Buteyko method claim that it can treat a wide range of other diseases and symptoms (numbering up to 150), including diabetes. However, studies into the effectiveness of Buteyko have focused almost exclusively on asthma with a small amount of research on sleep apnea. Members of the medical community have been skeptical of the efficacy of Buteyko due to the often &quot;exaggerated and unsubstantiated claims&quot; earlier made by Buteyko practitioners.

There are few high quality studies such as randomized controlled trials looking at the efficacy of treating asthma with &quot;breathing retraining&quot; methods in general, which include the Buteyko method, yoga training and other relaxation techniques. Many of the studies that have evaluated breathing retraining have significant methodological flaws, including small sample sizes, possible patient selection bias as well as heterogeneity in design that makes coming to a firm conclusion difficult. These studies are also hampered by the difficulty in proper blinding and placebo control which could introduce more bias into these studies.

In 2015 the Australian Government&#x27;s Department of Health published the results of a review of alternative therapies that sought to determine if any were suitable for being covered by health insurance; the Buteyko method was one of 17 therapies evaluated for which no clear evidence of effectiveness was found. A 2020 Cochrane review has found that breathing exercises may have some positive impact on quality of life, hyperventilation symptoms and lung function (moderate to very low certainty). A 2014 British clinical guideline said that for adults the Buteyko method could improve some asthma symptoms and quality of life, but that it had little impact on lung function.

<text>Andrei Codrescu (; born December 20, 1946) is a Romanian-born American poet, novelist, essayist, screenwriter, and commentator for National Public Radio. He is the winner of the Peabody Award for his film &quot;Road Scholar&quot; and the Ovid Prize for poetry. He was the MacCurdy Distinguished Professor of English at Louisiana State University from 1984 until his retirement in 2009.

==Biography==
Codrescu was born in Sibiu. His father was an ethnic Romanian engineer; his mother was a non-practicing Jew. Their son was informed of his Jewish background at age 13. Codrescu published his first poems in Romanian under the pen name Andrei Steiu. In 1965 he and his mother, a photographer and printer, were able to leave Romania after Israel paid US$2,000 (or US$10,000, according to other sources) to the Romanian communist regime for each of them. After some time in Italy, they moved to the United States in 1966, and settled in Detroit, where he became a regular at John Sinclair&#x27;s Artists and Writers&#x27; Workshop. A year later, he moved to New York, where he became part of the literary scene on the Lower East Side. There he met Allen Ginsberg, Ted Berrigan, and Anne Waldman, and published his first poems in English.

In 1970, his poetry book, &quot;License to Carry a Gun,&quot; won the &quot;Big Table Poetry Award&quot;. He moved to San Francisco in 1970, and lived on the West Coast for seven years, four of those in Monte Rio, a Sonoma County town on the Russian River. He also lived in Baltimore (where he taught at Johns Hopkins University), New Orleans and Baton Rouge, publishing a book every year. During this time he wrote poetry, stories, essays and reviews for many publications, including &quot;The New York Times&quot;, the &quot;Chicago Tribune&quot;, the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, &quot;Harper&#x27;s&quot;, and the &quot;Paris Review&quot;. He had regular columns in &quot;The Baltimore Sun&quot;, the &quot;City Paper&quot;, &quot;Architecture&quot;, &quot;Funny Times&quot;, &quot;Gambit Weekly&quot;, and &quot;Neon&quot;.
Codrescu was a regular commentator on National Public Radio&#x27;s news program, &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, from 1983 until 2016. He won the 1995 Peabody Award for the film &quot;Road Scholar&quot;, an American road movie that he wrote and starred in, and is a two-time winner of the Pushcart Prize. His book &quot;So Recently a World: Selected Poems, 1968-2016&quot; was a National Book Award nominee.

In 1989, Codrescu covered the Romanian Revolution for National Public Radio and ABC News&#x27;s &quot;Nightline&quot;. His renewed interest in the Romanian language and literature led to new work written in Romanian, including &quot;Miracle and Catastrophe&quot;, a book-length interview conducted by the theologian Robert Lazu, and &quot;The Forgiven Submarine&quot;, an epic poem written in collaboration with poet Ruxandra Cesereanu, which won the 2008 Radio România Cultural award. His books have been translated into Romanian by Ioana Avadani, Ioana Ieronim, Carmen Firan, Rodica Grigore, and Lăcrimioara Stoie. In 2002 Codrescu returned to Romania with a PBS &quot;Frontline World&quot; video crew to &quot;take the temperature&quot; of his homeland and produced the story, &quot;My Old Haunts&quot;. In 2005 he was awarded the prestigious international Ovidius Prize (also known as the Ovid Prize), previous winners of which include Mario Vargas Llosa, Amos Oz, and Orhan Pamuk.

In 1981, Codrescu became a naturalized citizen of the United States. He is the editor and founder of the online journal &quot;Exquisite Corpse&quot;, a journal of &quot;books and ideas&quot;. He reigned as King of the Krewe du Vieux for the 2002 New Orleans Mardi Gras season.

Codrescu&#x27;s archives and much of his personal library are now part of the Louisiana State University Libraries Special Collections, University of Iowa Libraries, New Orleans Historical Society, and the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign.

==Family==
His first wife was Aurelia Munteanu. His second wife was Alice Henderson, the mother of his two sons, Lucian Codrescu and Tristan Codrescu. His third wife, Laura Rosenthal (née Cole), was an editor at &quot;Exquisite Corpse: a Journal of Books &amp; Ideas&quot; and coeditor of three poetry anthologies.

==Controversial comments==
Codrescu was a commentator for NPR, and on the December 19, 1995, broadcast of &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, Codrescu reported that some Christians believe in a &quot;rapture&quot; and four million believers will ascend to Heaven immediately. He continued, &quot;The evaporation of 4 million who believe this crap would leave the world an instantly better place.&quot;

NPR subsequently apologized for the anti-Christianity of Codrescu&#x27;s comments, saying, &quot;Those remarks offended listeners and crossed a line of taste and tolerance that we should have defended with greater vigilance.&quot;

<text>is a combination of several schools ranging from four of the original Nichiren Buddhist schools that date back to Nichiren&#x27;s original disciples, and part of the fifth:

==Overview==

The school is often referred to as the &quot;Minobu Sect&quot; due to its prominence within the Mount Minobu area. The school&#x27;s head temple, Kuon-ji, is located on Mount Minobu where Nichiren lived in seclusion and where he asked to be buried. Another significant temple of the sect is the &quot;Ikegami Honmon-ji&quot; where Nichiren died. Accordingly, many of Nichiren&#x27;s most important personal artifacts and writings, also considered to be National Treasures of Japan, are within their safekeeping.

The sect is also known for its more open and tolerant views of other Buddhist traditions, even mixing or incorporating various mixed Buddhist beliefs and Shinto practices into their own Nichiren Buddhist aesthetics, most notably the use of various religious statues, the red stamping practice of Shuin for novelty, esoteric combinations of Buddhist fortune-telling folk practices and Shinto magic rituals, as well as the tolerant photography and lax distribution of the calligraphic &quot;Gohonzon&quot;.

Nichiren Shū does not believe Nichiren designated a single successor, as taught for instance by Nichiren Shōshū, instead they maintain that he designated six senior disciples of equal ranking to succeed him.

The &quot;Six Senior Disciples&quot; designated by Nichiren were:
* Nissho (1221–1323)
* Nichiro (1245–1320)
* Nikkō (1246–1333)
* Mimbu Nikō (1253–1314)
* Nitchō (1252–1317)
* Nichiji (1250–unknown)

Nichiren Shū designates the Shakyamuni Buddha of Chapter 16 of the Lotus Sutra as the Eternal Buddha while Nichiren is regarded as the Jogyo Bodhisattva that possesses the mission in Chapter 21 as the &quot;votary messenger&quot; to uphold the true Dharma in the Latter Day of the Law.

The sect designates Shakyamuni as the &quot;Original Buddha&quot; and he alone occupies the central role in Nichiren Shū; Nichiren—referred to as Nichiren Shōnin (&quot;Saint Nichiren&quot;)—is the saint who refocused attention on Shakyamuni by rebuking other Buddhist schools for solely emphasizing other buddhas or esoteric practices or for neglecting or deriding the Lotus Sutra.

Nichiren Shu regards Nichiren&#x27;s own writings—called &quot;Gosho&quot; or &quot;Goibun&quot; (御 遺 文) as commentaries or guides to the doctrines of Buddhism. They include the Five Major Writings of Nichiren in which he establishes doctrine, belief, and practice, as well as many pastoral letters he wrote to his followers.

The sect is highly selective about which &quot;Gosho&quot; writings it deems authentic. Many &quot;Gosho&quot; writings accepted by Nichiren Shōshū are not accepted as genuine by Nichiren Shū on grounds that scholars have not verified their authenticity. This dispute arises over the veracity of various disputed writings to be truly authored by Nichiren. The sect does not reject the alleged oral transmissions (including the &quot;Ongi Kuden&quot;) citing &quot;pastoral value&quot; but cannot be definitively asserted as Nichiren&#x27;s own teachings.

==Practices and beliefs==
The sect upholds five kinds of practices:

# Receiving and keeping the Sutra both mentally and physically 
# Reading the Sutra visually 
# Reciting the Sutra orally
# Explaining the Sutra to others
# Copying the Sutra as a pious act

There are two type of practices expected of a believer:

# Primary practice — Chanting Odaimoku to an object of devotion. 
# Secondary practice — The recitation of Chapter 2 and 16 of the Lotus Sutra, or any other chapter of the Lotus Sutra as desired.

In addition, other popular forms of Buddhist silent meditation (&quot;Shōdai-gyō&quot;), singing of hymnal praises, the artistic copying of the &quot;Odaimoku&quot; (&quot;Shakyō&quot;), and the study of fundamental Buddhist concepts such as the Four Noble Truths, Threefold Training, Noble Eightfold Path and Taking Refuge taught by Shakyamuni Buddha are also used as supporting practices in the sect.
==Object of worship==
Nichiren Shū issues calligraphic &quot;Gohonzons&quot; to its members, but statue arrangements may also be used to represent the &quot;Gohonzon&quot;. In Nichiren Shū, the following may be used as the &quot;Gohonzon&quot;:
* A statue of the Shakyamuni Buddha as the Eternal Buddha, sometimes flanked by the Four Bodhisattvas of the Earth
* A stupa with &quot;Namu-myōhō-renge-kyō&quot; inscribed on it, flanked by the Buddhas Shakyamuni and Prabhutaratna Buddha
* A single inscription of the Odaimoku (&quot;Ippen Shudai&quot;)
* The &quot;Rin-metsu&quot; &quot;gohonzon&quot; of Nichiren, now claimed as the Shutei Gohonzon of Nichiren Shu

All fully ordained Nichiren Shū ministers are able to inscribe and consecrate mandalas, but in practice few of them do. They usually bestow a copy of a Nichiren inscribed mandala, called the &quot;Shutei Gohonzon&quot;, upon their members.

== Holidays ==
Holidays observed in Nichiren Shū:
* 15 February — Nirvana Day; death anniversary of Shakyamuni Buddha
* 16 February — Nichiren&#x27;s birthday
* 21 March — Higan Equinox festival
* 8 April — Buddha&#x27;s Birthday
* 13–15 July and August — Urabon ancestry festival
* 13 October — death anniversary of Nichiren (Oeshiki)
* 8 December — Bodhi Day

==Nichiren Shū temples of historic importance==
* Hokekyo-ji, temple safekeeping the original of the &quot;Rissho Ankoku Ron&quot;, one of Nichiren&#x27;s most important writings
* Ikegami Honmon-ji, founded on the site where Nichiren passed and was cremated
* Kuon-ji, founded by Nichiren 
* Kyōnin-ji, marks the site where Nichiren was attacked in 1281
* Ryūkō-ji, marks the site where Nichiren was to be executed
* Seichō-ji, originally a temple of the Tendai-shū and later Shingon-shū; converted into a temple of the Nichiren-shū in 1949 as it played an important role in Nichiren-Buddhism
* Tanjō-ji, near the site of Nichiren&#x27;s parental home (the original site is under sea level today)

==Nichiren Shū today==
Nichiren Shū first spread overseas with Japanese immigrants to the United States, then to the Kingdom of Hawaii, Brazil and other locations in the latter half of the 19th century and the early 20th century. Presently, there are Nichiren Shū temples and Sanghas in the United States, Japan, Canada, Mexico, Costa Rica, much of South America, India, Korea, Southeast Asia (Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore and Taiwan), and Europe.

Nichiren Shū also ordains non-Japanese and non-Japanese speaking men and women, and continues to expand its presence overseas. Nichiren Shū maintains relations with other Nichiren schools and non-Nichiren schools.

In 2010, Nichiren Shū described itself as a &quot;religious organization consisting of about 5,000 temples, 8,000 ministers and 3.8 million members worldwide.&quot;

==Differences and similarities with other Nichiren schools==
===Gohonzon===
The sect does not believe in the &quot;Dai-Gohonzon&quot; revered in Nichiren Shoshu to be superior to other &quot;Gohonzons&quot;, and rejects the claim that it was truly inscribed by Nichiren as fraudulent.

===View of Nichiren===
Nichiren Shu states the following:

The sect regards Nichiren as Visistacaritra and teaches that Shakyamuni Buddha is special because he was the original Buddha in recorded human history that demonstrated an exemplary model for the pursuit of Buddhism by his followers and disciples.

* The sect rejects the Nichiren Shōshū claim that Nichiren was the &quot;Original Buddha of Kuon Ganjo&quot; from a timeless past.
* It also rejects the belief of Soka Gakkai which views Nichiren as simply an ordinary mortal person who attained Buddhahood.
* Nichiren Shu disputes the claim of Nichiren Shōshū designating Nikkō Shōnin as the sole legitimate successor to Nichiren, claiming it is based on fake documents and invented doctrines.
* The sect does not have a general consensus on the authenticity of some of the writings claimed to be from Nichiren, rendering them as apocryphal within Nichiren Shū.

===Three Great Hidden Dharmas===
Accordingly, Nichiren Shu shares the doctrine of &quot;The Three Great Hidden Dharmas&quot; (also known as &quot;The Three Great Secret Laws&quot;), but still differs them on the meaning:

# &quot;Odaimoku&quot; — (The sectarian pronunciation of &quot;Namu Myoho Renge Kyo&quot;), its meaning and intent. 
# Lotus Sutra — (as Sources of Doctrine) which chapters are used, recited and revered as valid. 
# &quot;Kaidan&quot; — (defined platform for practice), its meaning and intent.

<text>The Second Seminole War, also known as the Florida War, was a conflict from 1835 to 1842 in Florida between the United States and groups of people collectively known as Seminoles, consisting of Creek and Black Seminoles as well as other allied tribes (see below). It was part of a series of conflicts called the Seminole Wars. The Second Seminole War, often referred to as &quot;the&quot; Seminole War, is regarded as &quot;the longest and most costly of the Indian conflicts of the United States&quot;. After the Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing in 1832 that called for the Seminoles&#x27; removal from Florida, tensions rose until fierce hostilities occurred in Dade&#x27;s massacre in 1835. This engagement officially started the war although there were a series of incidents leading up to the Dade battle. The Seminoles and the U.S. forces engaged in mostly small engagements for more than six years. By 1842, only a few hundred native peoples remained in Florida. Although no peace treaty was ever signed, the war was declared over on August 14, 1842 by Colonel William Jenkins Worth.

==Background==
Bands from various tribes in the southeastern United States had moved into the unoccupied lands in Florida in the 18th century. These included Alabamas, Choctaw, Yamasees, Yuchis and Muscogees (then called &quot;Creeks&quot;). The Muscogees were the largest group, and included people from the Lower Towns and Upper Towns of the Muscogee Confederacy, and both Hitchiti and Muscogee speakers. One group of Hitchiti speakers, the Mikasuki, settled around what is now Lake Miccosukee near Tallahassee. Another group of Hitchiti speakers settled around the Alachua Prairie in what is now Alachua County (see Ahaya). The Spanish in St. Augustine began calling the Alachua Muscogees &quot;cimarrones&quot;, which roughly meant &quot;wild ones&quot; or &quot;runaways&quot;, and which is the probable origin of &quot;Seminole&quot;. This name was eventually also applied to the other groups in Florida, although the Native Americans still regarded themselves as members of different tribes. Other groups in Florida at the time of the Seminole Wars included &quot;Spanish Indians&quot;, so called because it was believed that they were descended from Calusas, and &quot;rancho Indians&quot;, persons of Native American ancestry, possibly both Calusa and Muscogee, and mixed Native American/Spanish ancestry, living at Spanish/Cuban fishing ranchos on the Florida coast. For a brief period after the start of the war, these rancho Indians, particularly those residing along Tampa Bay, were offered protection. However, they were also eventually forced onto reservations. 
The United States and Spain were at odds over Florida after the Treaty of Paris ended the American Revolutionary War and returned East and West Florida to Spanish control. The United States disputed the boundaries of West Florida. They accused the Spanish authorities of harboring fugitive slaves (see the Negro Fort) and of failing to restrain the Native Americans living in Florida from raiding the United States. Starting in 1810, the United States occupied and annexed parts of West Florida. Also, the Patriot War of 1812 was part of these ongoing conflicts. In 1818, Andrew Jackson led an invasion of Spanish Florida, during the War of 1812 and the Creek War leading to the First Seminole War.

The United States acquired Florida from Spain through the Adams–Onís Treaty in 1819 and took possession of the territory in 1821. Now that Florida belonged to the United States, settlers pressured the government to remove the Seminole and their allies altogether. In 1823 the government negotiated the Treaty of Moultrie Creek with the Seminoles, establishing a reservation for them in the middle of the territory. Six chiefs, however, were allowed to keep their villages along the Apalachicola River (see Neamathla).

===Move to the reservation===
The Seminoles gave up their lands in the panhandle and slowly settled into the reservation, although they occasionally had clashes with European Americans. Colonel (later General) Duncan Lamont Clinch was placed in charge of the Army units in Florida. Fort King was built near the reservation agency, at the site of present-day Ocala, Florida.

By early 1827, the Army reported that the Seminoles were on the reservation and Florida was peaceful. This peace lasted for five years, during which time there were repeated calls for the Seminoles to be sent west of the Mississippi. The Seminoles were opposed to the move, and especially to the suggestion that they should be placed on the Creek reservation. Most European Americans regarded the Seminoles as simply Creeks who had recently moved to Florida, while the Seminoles claimed Florida as their home and denied that they had any connection with the Creeks.

The status of runaway slaves was a continuing irritation between Seminoles and European Americans. &quot;The major problem was not with them [Seminoles] but with the Indian-Negros.&quot; General Taylor would not, being a &quot;slave holder&quot; himself, deny &quot;the Seminoles of their Negros&quot;, and &quot;in practice&quot;, handed his captives over to Lt. J. G. Reynolds, U.S. Marine Corps, &quot;in charge of immigration.&quot; Spain had given freedom to slaves who escaped to Florida under their rule, although the U.S. did not recognize it. Over the years, those who became known as Black or Negro Seminoles established communities separate from the Seminole villages, and the two peoples had close alliances although they maintained separate cultures. &quot;Negroes among the Seminoles constituted a threat to the institution of slavery north of the Spanish border. Slave holders in Mississippi and other border areas were aware of this and &quot;constantly accused the Indians of stealing their &quot;Negroes.&quot; However, this &quot;accusation&quot; was often reversed; whites were raiding Florida and forcibly stealing the red men&#x27;s slaves.

Worried about the possibility of an Indian uprising and/or an armed slave rebellion, Governor DuVal requested additional Federal troops for Florida. Instead, Fort King was closed in 1828. The Seminoles, short of food and finding the hunting becoming poorer on the reservation, were wandering off of it more often. Also in 1828, Andrew Jackson, the old enemy of the Seminoles, was elected President of the United States. In 1830 Congress passed the Indian Removal Act. They wanted to solve the problems with the Seminoles by moving them to west of the Mississippi River.

===Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing===

In the spring of 1832, the Seminoles on the reservation were called to a meeting at Payne&#x27;s Landing on the Oklawaha River. The treaty negotiated there called for the Seminoles to move west, if the land was found to be suitable. They were to be settled on the Creek reservation and become part of the Creek tribe. The delegation of seven chiefs who were to inspect the new reservation did not leave Florida until October 1832. After the chiefs had toured the area for several months and had conferred with the Creeks who had already been settled there, on March 28, 1833, the federal government produced a treaty with the chiefs&#x27; signatures.

Upon their return to Florida, however, most of the chiefs renounced the statement, claiming that they had not signed it, or that they had been forced to sign it. They said they did not have the power to decide for all the tribes and bands that resided on the reservation. Even some U.S. Army officers claimed that the chiefs had been &quot;wheedled and bullied into signing.&quot; Others noted &quot;there is evidence of trickery by the whites in the way the treaty is phrased.&quot; The members of the villages in the area of the Apalachicola River were more easily persuaded, however, as they suffered more encroachment from European Americans; they went west in 1834.
The United States Senate finally ratified the Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing in April 1834. The treaty had given the Seminoles three years to move west of the Mississippi. The government interpreted the three years as starting 1832, and expected the Seminoles to move in 1835. Fort King was reopened in 1834. A new Seminole agent, Wiley Thompson, had been appointed in 1834, and the task of persuading the Seminoles to move fell to him. He called the chiefs together at Fort King in October 1834 to talk to them about the removal to the west. The Seminoles informed Thompson that they had no intention of moving, and that they did not feel bound by the Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing. Thompson requested reinforcements for Fort King and Fort Brooke, reporting that, &quot;the Indians after they had received the Annuity, purchased an unusually large quantity of Powder &amp; Lead.&quot; General Clinch also warned Washington that the Seminoles did not intend to move, and that more troops would be needed to force them to move. In March 1835 Thompson called the chiefs together to read a letter from President Andrew Jackson to them. In his letter, Jackson said, &quot;Should you... refuse to move, I have then directed the Commanding officer to remove you by force.&quot; The chiefs asked for thirty days to respond. A month later the Seminole chiefs told Thompson that they would not move west. Thompson and the chiefs began arguing, and General Clinch had to intervene to prevent bloodshed. Eventually, eight of the chiefs agreed to move west, but asked to delay the move until the end of the year, and Thompson and Clinch agreed.

Five of the most important Seminole chiefs, including Micanopy of the Alachua Seminoles, had not agreed to the move. In retaliation, Thompson declared that those chiefs were removed from their positions. As relations with the Seminoles deteriorated, Thompson forbade the sale of guns and ammunition to them. Osceola, a young warrior beginning to be noticed by the European Americans, was particularly upset by the ban, feeling that it equated Seminoles with slaves and said, &quot;The white man shall not make me black. I will make the white man red with blood; and then blacken him in the sun and rain ... and the buzzard live upon his flesh.&quot; In spite of this, Thompson considered Osceola to be a friend, and gave him a rifle. Later, though, when Osceola was causing trouble, Thompson had him locked up at Fort King for a night. The next day, in order to secure his release, Osceola agreed to abide by the Treaty of Payne&#x27;s Landing and to bring his followers in.

The situation grew worse. A group of European Americans assaulted some Indians sitting around a campfire. Two more Indians came up during the assault and opened fire on the European Americans. Three European Americans were wounded, and one Indian was killed and one wounded. In August 1835, Private Kinsley Dalton (for whom Dalton, Georgia, is named) was killed by Seminoles as he was carrying the mail from Fort Brooke to Fort King. In November, Chief Charley Emathla, wanting no part of a war, led his people to Fort Brooke, where they were to board ships to go west. This was considered a betrayal by other Seminoles. Osceola met Charley Emathla on the trail to Fort King and killed him.

==The Dade Battle==


As the realization that the Seminoles would resist relocation sank in, Florida began preparing for war. The St. Augustine Militia asked the War Department for the loan of 500 muskets. Five hundred volunteers were mobilized under Brig. Gen. Richard K. Call. Indian war parties raided farms and settlements, and families fled to forts, large towns, or out of the territory altogether. A war party led by Osceola captured a Florida militia supply train, killing eight of its guards and wounding six others. Most of the goods taken were recovered by the militia in another fight a few days later. Sugar plantations along the Atlantic coast south of St. Augustine were destroyed, with many of the slaves on the plantations joining the Seminoles.

The U.S. Army had 11 companies, about 550 soldiers, stationed in Florida. Fort King had only one company of soldiers, and it was feared that they might be overrun by the Seminoles. There were three companies at Fort Brooke, with another two expected on the way, so it was decided to send two companies to Fort King. On December 23, 1835, the two companies, totaling 110 men, left Fort Brooke under the command of Maj. Francis L. Dade. Seminoles shadowed the marching soldiers for five days. On December 28 the Seminoles ambushed the soldiers, and killed all but three of the command, which became known as the Dade Massacre. Only three white men survived the battle. Pvt Edwin DeCourcey was hunted down and killed by a Seminole the next day. The other two survivors, Pvt Ransom Clarke and Pvt Joseph Sprague, returned to Fort Brooke. Only Clarke, who ultimately succumbed to his wounds 5 years later, dying on November 18, 1840 at the age of 28, left any account of the battle from the Army&#x27;s perspective. Entitled &quot;The Surprising Adventures of Ransom Clark, Among the Indians in Florida&quot;, it was published in 1839 by J. Orlando Orton and &quot;printed by Johnson and Marble in Binghamton, New York.&quot; Joseph Sprague suffered a &quot;shattered arm&quot;, served in the army until March 1843, and lived out his days near White Springs, Florida, until possibly 1848. No written material from Sprague&#x27;s personal military experience&#x27;s has ever surfaced. The Seminoles lost three men killed, with five wounded. On the same day as the Dade Massacre, Osceola and his followers shot and killed Wiley Thompson and six others outside of Fort King.

In February, Major Ethan Allen Hitchcock was among those who found the remains of the Dade party. In his journal he wrote about the discovery and vented his bitter discontent with the conflict:

The government is in the wrong, and this is the chief cause of the persevering opposition of the Indians, who have nobly defended their country against our attempt to enforce a fraudulent treaty. The natives used every means to avoid a war, but were forced into it by the tyranny of our government.

On December 29, General Clinch left Fort Drane (recently established on Clinch&#x27;s plantation, about twenty miles (32 km) northwest of Fort King) with 750 soldiers, including 500 volunteers on an enlistment due to end January 1, 1836. They were going to a Seminole stronghold called the Cove of the Withlacoochee, an area of many lakes on the southwest side of the Withlacoochee River. When they reached the river, they could not find the ford, and Clinch had his regular troops ferried across the river in a single canoe they had found. Once they were across and had relaxed, the Seminoles attacked. The troops survived only by fixing bayonets and charging the Seminoles, at the cost of four dead and 59 wounded. The militia provided cover as the Army troops withdrew across the river.

On January 6, 1836, a band of Seminoles attacked the coontie plantation of William Cooley on the New River (in present-day Fort Lauderdale, Florida), killing his wife and children and the children&#x27;s tutor. The other residents of the New River area and of the Biscayne Bay country to the south fled to Key West. On January 17, volunteers and Seminoles met south of St. Augustine at the Battle of Dunlawton. The volunteers lost four men, with thirteen wounded. On January 19, 1836, the Navy sloop-of-war was dispatched to Tampa Bay from Pensacola. On the same day 57 U.S. Marines were dispatched from Key West to help man Fort Brooke.

==General Gaines&#x27; expedition==
The regular American army was very small at the time, with fewer than 7,500 men manning a total of 53 posts. It was spread thin, with the Canada–U.S. border to guard, coastal fortifications to man, and especially, Indians to move west and then watch and keep separated from white settlers. Temporary needs for additional troops were filled by state and territory militias, and by self-organized volunteer units. As news and rumors of the fighting spread, action was taken on many levels. Maj. Gen. Winfield Scott was placed in charge of the war. Congress appropriated US$620,000 for the war. Volunteer companies began forming in Alabama, Georgia and South Carolina. General Edmund P. Gaines put together a force of 1,100 regulars and volunteers in New Orleans and sailed with them to Fort Brooke. A lack of arms was also an issue, with only two arsenals located in Florida, one at Fort Brooke and the other at Fort Marion, with a third under construction in what is now Chattahoochee.
When Gaines reached Fort Brooke, he found it low on supplies. Believing that General Scott had sent supplies to Fort King, Gaines led his men on to Fort King. Along the road they found the site of the Dade Massacre, and buried the bodies in three mass graves. The force reached Fort King after nine days, only to find it was very short on supplies. After receiving seven days&#x27; worth of rations from General Clinch at Fort Drane, Gaines headed back for Fort Brooke. Hoping to accomplish something for his efforts, Gaines took his men on a different route back to Fort Brooke, intending to engage the Seminoles in their stronghold in the Cove of the Withlacoochee River. Due to a lack of knowledge of the country, the Gaines party reached the same point on the Withlacoochee where Clinch had met the Seminoles one-and-a-half months earlier, and it took another day to find the ford while the two sides exchanged gunfire across the river.

When a crossing was attempted at the ford of the Withlacoochee, Lt. James Izard was wounded (and later died), and General Gaines was stuck by a bullet. Unable to ford the river, and not having enough ration to return to Fort King, Gaines and his men constructed a fortification, called Camp Izard, and sent word to General Clinch. Gaines hoped that the Seminoles would concentrate around Camp Izard, and that Clinch&#x27;s forces could then hit the Seminoles in their flank, crushing them between the two forces. General Scott, however, who was in charge of the war, ordered Clinch to stay at Fort Drane. Gaines&#x27;s men were soon reduced to eating their horses and mules, and an occasional dog, while a battle went on for eight days. Still at Fort Drane, Clinch requested that General Scott change his orders and allow him to go to Gaines&#x27; aid. Clinch finally decided to disobey Scott and left to join Gaines just one day before Scott&#x27;s permission to do so arrived at Fort Drane. Clinch and his men reached Camp Izard on March 6, chasing away the Seminoles.

==General Scott&#x27;s campaign==

General Scott had begun assembling men and supplies for a grand campaign against the Seminoles. Three columns, totaling 5,000 men, were to converge on the Cove of the Withlacoochee, trapping the Seminoles with a force large enough to defeat them. Scott would accompany one column, under the command of General Clinch, moving south from Fort Drane. A second column, under Brig. Gen. Abraham Eustis, would travel southwest from Volusia, a town on the St. Johns River. The third wing, under the command of Col. William Lindsay, would move north from Fort Brooke. The plan was for the three columns to arrive at the Cove simultaneously so as to prevent the Seminoles from escaping. Eustis and Lindsay were supposed to be in place on March 25, so that Clinch&#x27;s column could drive the Seminoles into them.

On the way from St. Augustine to Volusia to take up his starting position, Gen. Eustis found Pilaklikaha, or Palatlakaha (Palatka, Florida), also known as Abraham&#x27;s Town. Abraham had been a member of the Corps of Colonial Marines and was present at, and taken into custody, at the Battle of Negro Fort In custody only a short time, he was a Black Seminole leader, and interpreter for the Seminoles, who played a critical role during the Second Seminole War.Eustis burned the town before moving on to Volusia.

All three columns were delayed. Eustis was two days late departing Volusia because of an attack by the Seminoles. Clinch&#x27;s and Lindsay&#x27;s columns only reached their positions on March 28. Because of problems crossing through uncharted territory, Eustis&#x27;s column did not arrive until March 30. Clinch crossed the Withlacoochee on March 29 to attack the Seminoles in the Cove, but found the villages deserted. Eustis&#x27;s column did fight a skirmish with some Seminoles before reaching its assigned position, but the whole action had killed or captured only a few Seminoles. On March 31 all three commanders, running low on supplies, headed for Fort Brooke. The failure of the expedition to effectively engage the Seminoles was seen as a defeat, and was blamed on insufficient time for planning and an inhospitable climate.

==The Army retreats, Governor Call tries his hand==
April 1836 did not go well for the Army. Seminoles attacked a number of forts, including Camp Cooper in the Cove, Fort Alabama on the Hillsborough River north of Fort Brooke, Fort Barnwell near Volusia, and Fort Drane itself. The Seminoles also burned the sugar works on Clinch&#x27;s plantation. After that, Clinch resigned his commission and left the territory. Fort Alabama was abandoned in late April. In late May, Fort King was also abandoned. In June the soldiers in a blockhouse on the Withlacoochee were rescued after being besieged by the Seminoles for 48 days. On July 23, 1836, Seminoles attacked the Cape Florida lighthouse, severely wounding the assistant keeper in charge, killing his assistant, and burning the lighthouse. The lighthouse was not repaired until 1846. Fort Drane was abandoned in July because of illness, with five out of seven officers and 140 men on the sick list. The Army was suffering terribly from illness; at the time summer in Florida was called the &quot;sickly season&quot;. By the end of August, Fort Defiance, on the edge of the Alachua Prairie, was also abandoned. Seeing that the war promised to be long and expensive, Congress appropriated another US$1.5 million, and allowed volunteers to enlist for up to a year.

Richard Keith Call, who had led the Florida volunteers as a Brig. Gen. when Clinch marched on the Cove of the Withlacoochee in December, had been appointed Governor of the Territory of Florida on March 16, 1836. Governor Call proposed a summer campaign using militia and volunteers instead of regular Army troops. The War Department agreed to this proposal, but delays in preparations meant the campaign did not start until the end of September. Call also intended to attack the Cove of the Withlacoochee. He sent most of his supplies down the west coast of the peninsula and up the Withlacoochee to set up a supply base. With the main body of his men he marched to the now abandoned Fort Drane, and then on to the Withlacoochee, which they reached on October 13. The Withlacoochee was flooding and could not be forded. The army could not make rafts for a crossing because they had not brought any axes with them. In addition, Seminoles on the other side of the river were shooting at any soldier who showed himself along the river. Call then turned west along the north bank of the river to reach the supply depot. However, the steamer bringing the supplies had sunk in the lower part of the river, and the supply depot was far downstream from where Call was expecting it. Out of food, Call led his men back to Fort Drane, another failed expedition against the Cove.
In mid-November Call tried again. His forces made it across the Withlacoochee this time, but found the Cove abandoned. Call divided his forces, and proceeded south along the river. On November 17, Seminoles were routed from a large camp. There was another battle the next day, and the Seminoles were assumed to be headed for the Wahoo Swamp. Call waited to bring the other column across the river, then entered the Wahoo Swamp on November 21. The Seminoles resisted the advance in the Battle of Wahoo Swamp, as their families were close by, but had to retreat across a stream. Major David Moniac, who was part Creek and possibly the first Native American to graduate from West Point, tried to determine how deep the stream was, but was shot and killed by the Seminoles.

Faced with trying to cross a stream of unknown depth under hostile fire, and with supplies again running short, Call withdrew and led his men to Volusia. On December 9, Call was relieved of command and replaced by Maj. Gen. Thomas Jesup, who took the troops back to Fort Brooke. The enlistments of the volunteers were up at the end of December and they went home.

==Jesup takes command==

In 1836, the U.S. Army had just four Major Generals. Alexander Macomb, Jr. was the commanding general of the Army. Edmund Gaines and Winfield Scott had each taken to the field and failed to defeat the Seminoles. Thomas Jesup was the last Major General available. Jesup had just suppressed an uprising by the Creeks of western Georgia and eastern Alabama (the Creek War of 1836), upstaging Winfield Scott in the process. Jesup brought a new approach to the war. Instead of sending large columns out to try to force the Seminoles into a set-piece battle, he concentrated on wearing the Seminoles down. This required a large military presence in Florida, and Jesup eventually had a force of more than 9,000 men under his command. About half of the force were volunteers and militia; he also brought a regiment of friendly Creeks from Alabama who had been involved in the Second Creek War. The force also included a brigade of Marines, and Navy and United States Revenue Cutter Service (AKA: Revenue Marine) personnel patrolling the coast and inland rivers and streams. In all the Revenue Marine committed 8 Cutters to operations in Florida during the war.

The U.S. Navy and the Revenue Marine both worked with the Army from the beginning of the war. Navy ships and revenue cutters ferried men and supplies to Army posts. They patrolled the Florida coast to gather information on and intercept Seminoles, and to block smuggling of arms and supplies to the Seminoles. Sailors and Marines helped man Army forts that were short of manpower. Sailors, Marines, and the Cuttermen of the Revenue Marine participated in expeditions into the interior of Florida, both by boat and on land. Against those numbers the Seminoles had started the war with between 900 and 1,400 warriors, and with no means of replacing their losses. The total population of the Seminoles in 1836 was estimated at around 6,000 up to 10,000 people.

==Truce and reversal==
January 1837 saw a change in the war. In various actions a number of Seminoles and Black Seminoles were killed or captured. At the &quot;Battle of Hatchee-Lustee&quot;, the Marine brigade, &quot;succeeded in capturing the horses and baggage of the enemy, with twenty-five Indians and negroes, principally women and children.&quot; At the end of January some Seminole chiefs sent messengers to Jesup, and a truce was arranged. Fighting did not stop right away, and a meeting between Jesup and the chiefs did not occur until near the end of February. In March a &#x27;Capitulation&#x27; was signed by a number of chiefs, including Micanopy, stipulating that the Seminoles could be accompanied by their allies and &quot;their negroes, their &#x27;bona fide&#x27; property&quot; in their relocation to the West.

Even as Seminoles began to come into the Army camps to await transportation west, slave catchers were claiming blacks living with the Seminoles. As the Seminoles had no written records of ownership, they generally lost in disputes over ownership. Other whites were trying to have Seminoles arrested for alleged crimes or debts. All of this made the Seminoles suspicious of promises made by Jesup. On the other hand, it was noted that many of the warriors coming into the transportation camps had not brought their families, and seemed mainly to be interested in collecting supplies. By the end of May, many chiefs, including Micanopy, had surrendered. Two important leaders, Osceola and Sam Jones, had not surrendered, however, and were known to be vehemently opposed to relocation. On June 2 these two leaders with about 200 followers entered the poorly guarded holding camp at Fort Brooke and led away the 700 Seminoles there who had surrendered.

The war did not immediately resume on a large scale. General Jesup had thought that the surrender of so many Seminoles meant the war was ending, and had not planned a long campaign. Many of the soldiers had been assigned elsewhere, or, in the case of militias and volunteers, released from duty. It was also getting into summer, the &#x27;sickly season&#x27;, and the Army did not fight aggressively in Florida during the summer. The Panic of 1837 was reducing government revenues, but Congress appropriated another US$1.6 million for the war. In August the Army stopped supplying rations to civilians who had taken refuge at its forts.

==Captures and false flags==
Jesup kept pressure on the Seminoles by sending small units into the field. Many of the blacks with the Seminoles began turning themselves in. After a couple of swings in policy on dealing with fugitive slaves, Jesup ended up sending most of them west to join the Seminoles that were already in Indian territory. On September 10, 1837, the Army and militias captured a band of Mikasukis including King Phillip, one of the most important chiefs in Florida. The next night the same command captured a band of Yuchis, including their leader, Uchee Billy.
General Jesup had King Phillip send a message to his son Coacoochee (Wild Cat) to arrange a meeting with Jesup. When Coacoochee arrived under a flag of truce, Jesup arrested him. In October Osceola and Coa Hadjo, another chief, requested a parley with Jesup. A meeting was arranged south of St. Augustine. When Osceola and Coa Hadjo arrived for the meeting, also under a white flag, they were arrested. Osceola was dead within three months of his capture, in prison at Fort Moultrie in Charleston, South Carolina. Not all of the Seminoles captured by the Army stayed captured. While Osceola was still held at Fort Marion (Castillo de San Marcos) in St. Augustine, twenty Seminoles held in the same cell with him and King Phillip escaped through a narrow window. The escapees included Coacoochee and John Horse, a Black Seminole leader. &quot;Undoubtedly the general violated the rules of civilized warfare...[and] he was still writing justifications of it twenty-one years later&quot; for an act that &quot;hardly seems worthwhile to try to grace the capture with any other label than .&quot;

A delegation of Cherokee was sent to Florida to try to talk the Seminoles into moving west. When Micanopy and others came in to meet the Cherokees, General Jesup had the Seminoles held. John Ross, the head of the Cherokee delegation, protested, but to no avail. Jesup replied that he had told the Cherokees that no Seminole who came in would be allowed to return home.

==Zachary Taylor and the Battle of Lake Okeechobee==
Jesup now had a large army assembled, including volunteers from as far away as Missouri and Pennsylvania—so many men, in fact, that he had trouble feeding all of them. Jesup&#x27;s plan was to sweep down the peninsula with multiple columns, pushing the Seminoles further south. General Joseph Marion Hernández led a column down the east coast. General Eustis took his column up the St. Johns River (southward). Colonel Zachary Taylor led a column from Fort Brooke into the middle of the state, and then southward between the Kissimmee River and the Peace River. Other commands cleared out the areas between the St. Johns and the Oklawaha River, between the Oklawaha and the Withlacoochee River, and along the Caloosahatchee River. A joint Army-Navy unit patrolled the lower east coast of Florida. Other troops patrolled the northern part of the territory to protect against Seminole raids.

Colonel Taylor saw the first major action of the campaign. Leaving Fort Gardiner on the upper Kissimmee with 1,000 men on December 19, Taylor headed towards Lake Okeechobee. In the first two days out ninety Seminoles surrendered. On the third day Taylor stopped to build Fort Basinger, where he left his sick and enough men to guard the Seminoles that had surrendered. Three days later, on Christmas Day, 1837, Taylor&#x27;s column caught up with the main body of the Seminoles on the north shore of Lake Okeechobee.

The Seminoles led by Alligator, Sam Jones, and the recently escaped Coacoochee, were well positioned in a hammock surrounded by sawgrass. The ground was thick mud, and sawgrass easily cuts and burns the skin. Taylor had about 800 men, while the Seminoles numbered less than 400. Taylor sent the Missouri volunteers in first. Colonel Richard Gentry, three other officers and more than twenty enlisted men were killed before the volunteers retreated. Next in were 200 soldiers of the 6th Infantry, who lost four officers and suffered nearly 40% casualties before they withdrew. Then it was the turn of the 4th Infantry, 160 men augmented by remnants of the 6th Infantry and the Missouri volunteers. This time the troops were able to drive the Seminoles from the hammock and towards the lake. Taylor then attacked their flank with his reserves, but the Seminoles were able to escape across the lake. Only about a dozen Seminoles had been killed in the battle. Nevertheless, the Battle of Lake Okeechobee was hailed as a great victory for Taylor and the Army.

==The Battle of Loxahatchee==
Taylor now joined the other columns sweeping down the peninsula to pass on the east side of Lake Okeechobee, under the overall command of General Jesup. The troops along the Caloosahatchee River blocked any passage north on the west side of the lake. Still patrolling the east coast of Florida was the combined Army-Navy force under Navy Lt. Levin Powell. On January 15, Powell, in the Battle of Jupiter Inlet, led eighty men towards a Seminole camp only to find themselves outnumbered by the Seminoles. A charge against the Seminoles was unsuccessful, but the troops made it back to their boats after losing four dead and twenty-two wounded. The party&#x27;s retreat was covered by Army Lt. Joseph E. Johnston. At the end of January, Jesup&#x27;s troops caught up with a large body of Seminoles to the east of Lake Okeechobee. The Seminoles were originally positioned in a hammock, but cannon and rocket fire drove them back across a wide stream (the Loxahatchee River), where they made another stand. The Seminoles eventually just faded away, having caused more casualties than they received, and the Battle of Loxahatchee was over.

The fighting now died down. In February 1838, Seminole chiefs Tuskegee and Halleck Hadjo approached Jesup with the proposition that they would stop fighting if they were allowed to stay south of Lake Okeechobee. Jesup favored the idea, foreseeing a long struggle to capture the remaining Seminoles in the Everglades, and calculating that the Seminoles would be easier to round up later when the land was actually needed by white settlers. However, Jesup had to write to Washington for approval. The chiefs and their followers camped near the Army while awaiting the reply, and there was considerable fraternizing between the two camps. Secretary of War Joel Roberts Poinsett rejected the arrangement, however, and instructed Jesup to continue his campaign. Upon receiving Poinsett&#x27;s response, Jesup summoned the chiefs to his camp, but they refused his invitation. Unwilling to let 500 Seminoles return to the swamps, Jesup sent a force to detain them. The Seminoles offered very little resistance, perhaps seeing little reason to continue fighting.

Loxahatchee River Battlefield Park preserves an area of the fighting. Memorials are also located in Jonathan Dickinson State Park.

==Jesup steps down; Zachary Taylor takes command==
Jesup asked to be relieved of his command. As summer approached in 1838 the number of troops in Florida dwindled to about 2,300. In April, Jesup was informed that he should return to his position as Quartermaster General of the Army. In May, Zachary Taylor, now a General, assumed command of the Army forces in Florida. With reduced forces in Florida, Taylor concentrated on keeping the Seminole out of northern Florida, so that settlers could return to their homes. The Seminoles were still capable of reaching far north. In July they were thought responsible for the deaths of a family on the Santa Fe River, another near Tallahassee, as well as two families in Georgia. The fighting died down during the summer, as the soldiers were pulled back to the coasts. The Seminoles concentrated on growing their crops and gathering supplies for fall and winter.

Taylor&#x27;s plan was to build small posts at frequent intervals across northern Florida, connected by wagon roads, and to use larger units to search designated areas. This was expensive, but Congress continued to appropriate the necessary funds. In October 1838, Taylor relocated the last of the Seminole living along the Apalachicola River to Indian Territory west of the Mississippi River. Killings in the Tallahassee area caused Taylor to pull troops out of southern Florida to provide more protection in the north. The winter season was fairly quiet. The Army killed only a few Seminole and transported fewer than 200 to the West. Nine U.S. troops were killed by the Seminoles. Taylor reported in the Spring of 1839 that his men had constructed 53 new posts and cut of wagon roads.

==Macomb&#x27;s peace and the Battle of Caloosahatchee==
In Washington and around the country in 1839, support for the war was eroding. The size of the Army had been increased because of the demands for manpower in the Florida war. Many people were beginning to think that the Seminole had earned a right to stay in Florida. The cost and time required to get all the Seminole out of Florida were looming larger. Congress appropriated US$5,000 to negotiate a settlement with the Seminole people in order to end the outlay of resources. President Martin Van Buren sent the Commanding General of the Army, Alexander Macomb, to negotiate a new treaty with the Seminole. Remembering the broken treaties and promises of the past, they were slow to respond to the new overtures. Finally, Sam Jones sent his chosen successor, Chitto Tustenuggee, to meet with Macomb. On May 19, 1839, Macomb announced reaching agreement with the Seminole. They would stop fighting in exchange for a reservation in southern Florida.

As the summer passed, the agreement seemed to be holding. There were few killings. A trading post was established on the north shore of the Caloosahatchee River, near present day Cape Coral, and the Seminoles who came to the trading post seemed to be friendly. A detachment of 23 soldiers was stationed at the Caloosahatchee trading post under the command of Colonel William S. Harney. On July 23, 1839, some 150 Indians, including Billy Bowlegs and two other leaders named Chakaika and Hospertarke, attacked the trading post and guard. Some of the soldiers, including Colonel Harney, were able to reach the river and find boats to escape in, but most of the soldiers, as well as a number of civilians in the trading post, were killed. The war was on again.

The Americans did not know which band of Indians had attacked the trading post. Many blamed the &#x27;Spanish&#x27; Indians, led by Chakaika. Some suspected Sam Jones, whose band of Mikasuki had come to agreement with Macomb. Jones promised to turn the men responsible for the attack over to Harney in 33 days. In the meantime, the Mikasuki in Sam Jones&#x27; camp near Fort Lauderdale remained on friendly terms with the local soldiers. On July 27 they invited the officers at the fort to a dance at the Mikasuki camp. The officers declined but sent two soldiers and a Black Seminole interpreter with a keg of whiskey. The Mikasuki killed the soldiers, but the Black Seminole escaped. He reported at the fort that Sam Jones and Chitto Tustenuggee were involved in the attack. In August 1839, Seminole raiding parties operated as far north as Fort White.

==New tactics==
The Army decided to use bloodhounds to track the Seminoles. (General Taylor had requested and received permission to buy bloodhounds in 1838) &quot;Taylor accepted two of them for trial...the hounds failed their tests. They were trained to track Negros...and could not be induced to nose out Indians.&quot; In early 1840, the Florida territorial government purchased bloodhounds from Cuba and hired Cuban handlers. Initial trials of the hounds had mixed results, and a public outcry arose against the use of the dogs, based on fears that they would be set on the Seminoles in physical attacks, including against women and children. The Secretary of War ordered the dogs to be muzzled and kept on leashes while tracking. Bloodhounds could not track through water, however &quot;tracks of Indians were found, but the dogs finding the scent far different from that of a negro, refused to follow [them].&quot;

In the north of Florida, Taylor&#x27;s blockhouse and patrol system kept the Seminole on the move, but the Army could not clear them from the area. Ambushes of travelers were common. On February 13, 1840, the mail stage between St. Augustine and Jacksonville was ambushed. In May Seminole attacked a theatrical troupe near St. Augustine, killing a total of six people. In the same month, a group of four soldiers traveling between forts in Alachua County was attacked, with one killed and two others never seen again. A party of eighteen men pursued the Indians, but six were killed.

In May 1840, Zachary Taylor, having served longer than any preceding commander in the Florida war, was granted his request for a transfer. He was replaced by Brig. Gen. Walker Keith Armistead, who had earlier served in Florida as second in command to General Jesup. Armistead began an offensive, sending out 100 soldiers at a time to search for the Seminole and their camps. For the first time, the Army campaigned in Florida during the summer, taking captives and destroying crops and buildings. The Seminole also were active in warfare, killing fourteen soldiers during July. The Army worked to find the Seminole camps, burn their fields and stores of food, and drive off their livestock, including their horses.

Armistead planned to turn over the defense of Florida north of Fort King to the militia and volunteers. He wanted to use Army regulars to confine the Seminole to south of Fort King, and pursue them within that territory. The Army destroyed camps and fields across central Florida, a total of of Seminole crops by the middle of the summer. General Armistead became estranged from the territorial government, although he needed 1,500 militiamen from the Territory to defend the area north of Fort King. To bolster the effort south of Fort King, the Army sent the Eighth Infantry Regiment to Florida. The Army in Florida now included ten companies of the Second Dragoon, nine companies of the Third Artillery, and the First, Second, Third, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Infantry Regiments.

Changes were also being made in southern Florida. At Fort Bankhead on Key Biscayne, Col. Harney instituted an intensive training program in swamp and jungle warfare for his men. The Navy took a larger role in the war, sending manned boats with sailors and marines up rivers and streams, and into the Everglades.

==The &quot;Mosquito Fleet&quot;==
In the early years of the war, Navy Lt. Levin Powell had commanded a joint Army-Navy force along with 8 Revenue Cutters of some 200 plus men that operated along the coast. In late 1839, Navy Lt. John T. McLaughlin was given command of a joint Army-Navy force supported by the Revenue Marine. This included schooners and cutters off the shores, barges close to the mainland to intercept Cuban and Bahamian traders bringing arms and other supplies to the Seminoles, and smaller boats, down to canoes, for patrolling up rivers and into the Everglades. McLaughlin established his base at Tea Table Key in the upper Florida Keys.

An attempt to cross the Everglades from west to east was launched in April 1840, but the sailors and marines were engaged by Seminoles at the rendezvous point on Cape Sable. Although there were no known fatalities (the Seminoles carried off their dead and wounded), many of the naval personnel became ill, and the expedition was called off and the sick were taken to Pensacola. For the next few months the men of Lt. McLaughlin&#x27;s force explored the inlets and rivers of southern Florida. McLaughlin did lead a force across the Everglades later. Traveling from December 1840 to the middle of January 1841, McLaughlin&#x27;s force crossed the Everglades from east to west in dugout canoes, the first groups of whites to complete a crossing.

==Indian Key==
Indian Key is a small island in the upper Florida Keys which had developed into a base for wreckers. In 1836 it became the county seat of the newly created Dade County and a port of entry. Despite fears of attack and sightings of Indians in the area, the inhabitants of Indian Key stayed to protect their property, and to be close to any wrecks in the upper Keys. The islanders had six cannons and their own small militia company for their defense, and the Navy had established a base on nearby Tea Table Key.

Early in the morning of August 7, 1840, a large party of Spanish Indians snuck onto Indian Key. By chance, one man was up and raised the alarm after spotting the Indians. Of about fifty people living on the island, forty were able to escape. The dead included Dr. Henry Perrine, former United States Consul in Campeche, Mexico, who was waiting at Indian Key until it was safe to take up a grant on the mainland that Congress had awarded to him.

The naval base on Tea Table Key had been stripped of personnel for an operation on the southwest coast of the mainland, leaving only a physician, his patients, and five sailors under a midshipman to look after them. This small contingent mounted a couple of cannons on barges and tried to attack the Indians on Indian Key. The Indians fired back at the sailors with musket balls loaded in one of the cannons on shore. The recoil of the cannons on the barges broke them loose, sending them into the water, and the sailors had to retreat. The Indians burned the buildings on Indian Key after thoroughly looting it.

==Revenge and negotiations==

In December 1840, Colonel William S. Harney led ninety men into the Everglades from Fort Dallas on the Miami River, traveling in canoes borrowed from the Marines. They were guided by a black man named John who had been in Seminole captivity for some time. The column encountered some Indians in canoes and gave chase, catching some of them and promptly hanging the men. When John was having trouble finding the way, Harney tried to force the captured Seminole women to lead the way to the camp, reportedly by threatening to hang their children. However, John got his bearings again and the Harney party found the camp of Chakaika and the &#x27;Spanish Indians&#x27;. Dressed as Indians, the soldiers approached the camp early in the morning, achieving surprise. Chakaika was outside the camp when the attack started. He started to run and then stopped and turned to face the soldiers, offering his hand, but one of the soldiers shot and killed him. There was a brief fight during which some of the Indians escaped. Harney had two of the captured warriors hanged, and had Chakaika&#x27;s body hung beside them. Harney and his men returned to Fort Dallas after twelve days in the Everglades. Harney had lost one soldier killed. His command had killed four Indians in action and hanged five more. The Legislative Council of Florida presented Harney with a commendation and a sword, and Harney was soon given command of the Second Dragoons.

Armistead had US$55,000 ($ in dollars) to use for bribing chiefs to surrender. In November 1840, General Armistead met at Fort King with Thlocklo Tustenuggee, a Muscogee speaker known as &quot;Tiger Tail&quot;, and Halleck Tustenuggee, a Mikasuki speaker. Armistead was authorized by Washington to offer each leader $5,000 ($115,023) to bring their followers in for transportation west, and to concede land in the south of Florida to those remaining. However, Colonel Ethan A. Hitchcock recorded in his diary, with considerable frustration, that the General instead pocketed these proposals and insisted the chiefs agree to the terms of the Payne&#x27;s Landing treaty. Moreover, while talking peace, he secretly sent a force threatening Halleck&#x27;s people at his home. After several days as guests of the Army both chiefs fled in the middle of the night on November 14, 1840. Echo Emathla, a Tallahassee chief, surrendered, but most of the Tallahassee, under Tiger Tail, did not. The Mikasukis, led by Coosa Tustenuggee and Halleck Tustenuggee, continued to operate in the northern part of the Florida peninsula. Coosa Tustenuggee finally accepted $5,000 for bringing in his sixty people. Lesser chiefs received $200 ($4,601), and every warrior $30 ($690) and a rifle. Coacoochee took advantage of Armistead&#x27;s willingness to negotiate. In March 1841, he agreed to bring in his followers in two or three months. During that time, he appeared at several forts, presenting the pass given to him by Armistead, and demanding food and liquor. On one visit to Fort Pierce, Coacoochee demanded a horse to ride to Fort Brooke. The fort commander gave him one, along with five and one-half gallons of whiskey.

By the spring of 1841, Armistead had sent 450 Seminoles west. Another 236 were at Fort Brooke awaiting transportation. Armistead estimated that 120 warriors had been shipped west during his tenure, and that there were no more than 300 warriors left in Florida. In May 1841, Halleck Tustenuggee sent word that he would be bringing his band in to surrender.

==Colonel Worth takes charge==
In May 1841, Armistead was replaced by Col. William Jenkins Worth as commander of Army forces in Florida. Due to the unpopularity of the war in the nation and in Congress, Worth had to cut back. The war was costing US$93,300 per month in addition to the pay of the regular soldiers. John T. Sprague, Worth&#x27;s aide, believed that some civilians were trying to deliberately prolong the war in order to stay on the government payroll. Nearly 1,000 civilian employees of the Army were released, and smaller commands were consolidated. Worth then ordered his men out on what would now be called &#x27;search and destroy&#x27; missions during the summer. These efforts effectively drove the Seminoles out of their old stronghold in the Cove of the Withlacoochee. Much of the rest of northern Florida was also cleared by these methods.

On May 1, 1841, Lieutenant William Tecumseh Sherman was assigned to escort Coacoochee to a meeting at Fort Pierce. (The fort was named for Colonel Benjamin Kendrick Pierce, who oversaw its construction.) After washing and dressing in his best (which included a vest with a bullet hole and blood on it), Coacoochee asked Sherman to give him silver in exchange for a one-dollar bill from the Bank of Tallahassee. At the meeting Major Thomas Childs agreed to give Coacoochee thirty days to bring in his people for transportation west. Coacoochee&#x27;s people came and went freely at the fort for the rest of the month, while Childs became convinced that Coachoochee would renege on his agreement. Childs asked for and received permission to seize Coacoochee. On June 4 he arrested Coachoochee and fifteen of his followers. Lieutenant Colonel William Gates ordered that Coacoochee and his men be shipped immediately to New Orleans. When Colonel Worth learned of this, he ordered the ship to return to Tampa Bay, as he intended to use Coacoochee to persuade the rest of the Seminoles to surrender.

Colonel Worth offered bribes worth about US$8,000 to Coacoochee. As Coacoochee had no real hope of escaping, he agreed to send out messengers urging the Seminoles to move west. The chiefs still active in the northern part of the Florida peninsula, Halleck Tustenuggee, Tiger Tail, Nethlockemathla, and Octiarche, met in council and agreed to kill any messengers from the whites. The southern chiefs seemed to have learned of this decision, and supported it. However, when one messenger appeared at a council of Holata Mico, Sam Jones, Otulkethlocko, Hospetarke, Fuse Hadjo and Passacka, he was made prisoner, but not killed.

A total of 211 Seminoles surrendered as a result of Coacoochee&#x27;s messages, including most of his own band. Hospetarke was drawn into a meeting at Camp Ogden (near the mouth of the Peace River) in August and he and 127 of his band were captured. As the number of Seminoles in Florida decreased, it became easier for those left to stay hidden. In November the Third Artillery moved into the Big Cypress Swamp and burned a few villages. Some of the Seminoles in southern Florida gave up after that, and turned themselves in for transportation west.

Seminoles were still scattered throughout most of Florida. One band that had been reduced to starvation surrendered in northern Florida near the Apalachicola River in 1842. Further east, however, bands led by Halpatter Tustenuggee, Halleck Tustenuggee and Chitto Harjo raided Mandarin and other settlements along the lower (i.e., northern) St. Johns River. On April 19, 1842, a column of 200 soldiers led by First Lieutenant George A. McCall found a group of Seminole warriors in the Pelchikaha Swamp, about thirty miles south of Fort King. There was a brief fire-fight and then the Seminoles disappeared into a hammock. Halleck Tustenuggee was held prisoner when he showed up at Fort King for a talk. Part of his band was caught when they visited the fort, and Lieutenant McCall captured the rest of Halleck&#x27;s band in their camp.

==The war winds down==

Colonel Worth recommended early in 1842 that the remaining Seminoles be left in peace if they would stay in southern Florida. Worth eventually received authorization to leave the remaining Seminoles on an informal reservation in southwestern Florida, and to declare an end to the war on a date of his choosing. At this time there were still several diverse bands of Indians in Florida. Billy Bowlegs was the head of a large band of Seminoles living near Charlotte Harbor. Sam Jones led a band of Mikasukis that lived in the Everglades near Fort Lauderdale. North of Lake Okeechobee was a band of Muskogees led by Chipco. Another Muskogee band, led by Tiger Tail, lived near Tallahassee. Finally, in northern Florida there was a band of Creeks led by Octiarche which had fled from Georgia in 1836.

In August 1842, Congress passed the Armed Occupation Act, which provided free land to settlers who improved the land and were prepared to defend themselves from Indians. In many ways this act prefigured the Homestead Act of 1862. Heads of households could claim of land south of a line running across the northern part of the peninsula. They had to &#x27;prove&#x27; their claim by living on the land for five years and clearing . However, they could not claim land within two miles (3 km) of a military post. A total of 1,317 grants totaling were registered in 1842 and 1843.

In the last action of the war, General William Bailey and prominent planter Jack Bellamy led a posse of 52 men on a three-day pursuit of a small band of Tiger Tail&#x27;s braves who had been attacking pioneers, surprising their swampy encampment and killing all 24. William Wesley Hankins, at sixteen the youngest of the posse, accounted for the last of the kills and was acknowledged as having fired the last shot of the Second Seminole War.

Also in August 1842, Worth met with the chiefs still in Florida. Each warrior was offered a rifle, money and one year&#x27;s worth of rations if they moved west. Some accepted the offer, but most hoped to eventually move to the reservation in southwest Florida. Believing that the remaining Indians in Florida would either go west or move to the reservation, Worth declared the war to be at an end on August 14, 1842. Worth then went on ninety-days leave, leaving command to Colonel Josiah Vose. The Army in Florida consisted at this point of parts of three regiments, totaling 1,890 men. Attacks on white settlers continued even as far north as the area around Tallahassee. Otiarche and Tiger Tail had not indicated what they would do. Complaints from Florida caused the War Department to order Vose to take action against the bands still off the reservation, but Vose argued that breaking the pledges made to the Indians would have bad results, and the War Department accepted his arguments. In early October a major hurricane struck Cedar Key, where the Army headquarters had been located, and the Indians would no longer visit it.

Worth returned to Florida at the beginning of November 1842. He soon decided that Tiger Tail and Otiarche had taken too long to make up their minds on what to do, and ordered that they be brought in. Tiger Tail was so ill that he had to be carried on a litter, and he died in New Orleans waiting for transportation to the Indian territory. The other Indians in northern Florida were also captured and sent west. By April 1843, only one regiment, the Eighth Infantry, was still in Florida. In November 1843 Worth reported that the only Indians left in Florida were 42 Seminole warriors, 33 Mikasukis, 10 Creeks and 10 Tallahassees, with women and children bringing the total to about 300. Worth also stated that these Indians were all living on the reservation and were no longer a threat to the white population of Florida.

==Costs==
Mahon cites estimates of US$30,000,000 to $40,000,000 as the cost of the Second Seminole War, but knew of no analysis of the actual cost. Congress appropriated funds for the &#x27;suppression of Indian hostilities&#x27;, but the costs of the Creek War of 1836 are included in that. An inquiry in extravagance in naval operations found that the Navy had spent about US$511,000 on the war. The investigation did find questionable expenditures. Among other things, while the Army had bought dugout canoes for $10 to $15 apiece, the Navy spent an average of $226 per canoe. The number of Army, Navy and Marine regulars who served in Florida is given as 10,169. About 30,000 militiamen and volunteers also served in the war.

By the spring 1841, the paymaster general issued a report that found the U.S. government had issued $2,500,000 in payroll to regular army soldiers and an additional $3,500,000 in payroll to citizen soldiers. 

Sources agree that the U.S. Army officially recorded 1,466 deaths in the Second Seminole War, mostly from disease. The number killed in action is less clear. Mahon reports 328 regular Army killed in action, while Missall reports that Seminoles killed 269 officers and men. Almost half of those deaths occurred in the Dade Massacre, Battle of Lake Okeechobee and Harney Massacre. Similarly, Mahon reports 69 deaths for the Navy while Missall reports 41 for the U.S. Navy and Marine Corps, but adds others may have died after being sent out of Florida as &quot;incurable&quot;. Mahon and the Florida Board of State Institutions agree that 55 volunteer officers and men were killed by the Seminoles, while Missall says the number is unknown. There is no figure for how many militiamen and volunteers died of disease or accident, however.

The number of white civilians, Seminoles and Black Seminoles killed is uncertain. A northern newspaper carried a report that more than 80 civilians were killed by Indians in Florida in 1839. Nobody was keeping a cumulative account of the number of Indians and Black Seminoles killed, or the number who died of starvation or other privations caused by the war. The people shipped west did not fare well, either. By the end of 1843, 3,824 Indians (including 800 Black Seminoles) had been shipped from Florida to what became the Indian Territory. They were initially settled on the Creek Reservation, which created tensions. The next year, the Florida people numbered 3,136. As of 1962, their numbers had dropped to 2,343 Seminoles in the Indian Territory and perhaps some 1,500 in Florida.

==Aftermath ==
Peace had come to Florida for a while. The Natives were mostly staying on the reservation, but there were minor clashes. The Florida authorities continued to press for removal of all Natives from Florida. The Natives for their part tried to limit their contacts with the American settlers as much as possible. 

As time went on there were more serious incidents. The government resolved once more to remove all Indians from Florida, and applied increasing pressure on the Seminoles until they struck back, starting the Third Seminole War of 1855–1858.

<text>The Brethren of the Common Life (, FVC) was a Roman Catholic pietist religious community founded in the Netherlands in the 14th century by Gerard Groote, formerly a successful and worldly educator who had had a religious experience and preached a life of simple devotion to Jesus Christ. They believed that Christianity should be practiced not only in formal religious settings, but also in everyday life, and they sought to promote a practical spirituality that emphasized personal piety and devotion. 

Without taking up irrevocable vows, the Brethren banded together in communities, giving up their worldly goods to live chaste and strictly regulated lives in common houses, devoting every waking hour to attending divine service, reading and preaching of sermons, labouring productively, and taking meals in common that were accompanied by the reading aloud of Scripture: &quot;judged from the ascetic discipline and intention of this life, it had few features which distinguished it from life in a monastery&quot;, observes Hans Baron.

The Brethren of the Common Life were an important religious movement of the late Middle Ages and the Renaissance, and their emphasis on education, personal piety, and social justice had a profound influence on the religious and intellectual culture of Europe.

==Cornerstones==
The four cornerstones of the Brethren were 

* contempt of the world and of self (), 
* imitation of the lowly life of Christ (), 
* good-will (), and 
* the grace of devoutness (.) 

The Confraternity of the Common Life were in many ways similar to the Beghard and Beguine communities which had flourished two centuries earlier but were by then declining. Its members took no vows and neither asked nor received alms; their first aim was to cultivate the interior life, and they worked for their daily bread.

The &quot;antifraternal&quot; insistence on work distinguishes the Brethren from mendicant (begging) friars; they were attacked by mendicant theologians at the Council of Constance for not having mainstream formal vows initially, but were successfully defended by Pierre d&#x27;Ailly and Jean Gerson.

==Devotio Moderna==

The Brethren&#x27;s confraternity is the best known fruits of the &quot;Devotio Moderna&quot;, (the Modern Devotion), a lifestyle and undogmatic form of piety which some historians have argued helped to pave the road for the Protestant Reformation. In the fifteenth century, the movement spread to southern and western Germany. The Protestant Reformers, including Martin Luther and John Calvin, were influenced by the ideas and practices of the Devotio Moderna.

==Gerard Groote==

Of wealthy burgher stock, Groote was born in Deventer in the Oversticht possession of the Duchy of Guelders in 1340. Having read at Cologne, at the Sorbonne, and at Prague, he took orders and obtained preferment, a canon&#x27;s stall at Utrecht and another at Aachen. His relations with the German Gottesfreunde and the writings of John of Ruusbroec, who later became his friend, gradually inclined him to mysticism, and on recovering from an illness in 1373, he resigned his prebends, bestowed his goods on the Carthusians of Arnhem and lived in solitude for seven years.

Feeling himself constrained to go forth and preach, Groote went from place to place calling men to repentance, proclaiming the beauty of Divine love, and bewailing the relaxation of ecclesiastical discipline and the degradation of the clergy. The effect of his sermons was marvelous; thousands hung on his words.

A small band of followers attached themselves to Groote and became his fellow workers, thus becoming the first &quot;Brethren of the Common Life&quot; (). The reformer was opposed by many, including the clergy, for his preaching on moral decadence, and in 1383 his license to preach was revoked. Nonetheless, his zeal for purifying the Catholic faith and the morality of its followers won many to his cause. Members of the secular clergy even enrolled themselves in his brotherhood, which, in due course, was approved by the Pope.

==Windesheim Congregation==

Groote, however, did not live long enough to finish the work he had begun. He died in 1384 and was succeeded by Florens Radewyns, who two years later refounded the famous monastery of Augustinian canons at Windesheim, near Zwolle, which was now the centre of the new association.

==Education and activity==
The majority of the Brethren were laymen who did not take monastic vows. They devoted themselves to doing charitable work, chaplaining schools, nursing the sick, studying and teaching the Scriptures, and copying religious and inspirational works. They founded or supported a number of schools that became famous for their high standards of learning. Many famous men attended their schools, including Nicholas of Cusa, Thomas à Kempis, and Erasmus, all of whom studied at the Brethren&#x27;s school at Deventer.

Books and the library were central to the communities of Brethren, whose scrupulous copies of works of piety supported their houses and put the texts in which they found spiritual sustenance in many hands. The houses of the brothers and sisters occupied themselves with literature and education, and their priests also with preaching.

When Groote began, education in the Netherlands was still rare, unlike in Italy and the southern parts of the Holy Roman Empire of the German Nation; the University of Leme of the schools of Liège was only a vague memory. Apart from some of the clergy who had studied at the universities and cathedral schools in Paris or in Cologne, there were few scholars in the land; even amongst the higher clergy there were many who were ignorant of the scientific study of Latin, and the ordinary burgher of the Dutch cities was quite content if, when his children left school, they were able to read and write the Medieval Low German and Diets.

Groote determined to change all that. The Brethren worked consistently in the scriptorium; afterwards, with the printing press, they were able to publish their spiritual writings widely. Among them are to be found the best works of 15th-century Flemish prose. 

The Brethren were specially involved in youth education, running many schools and associated hostels: in the early 1500s Brethren in Zwolle  built a large a house which would hold 200 poor schoolboys.
The Brethren spared no pains to obtain good masters, if necessary from foreign countries, for their schools, which became centres of spiritual and intellectual life of the Catholic Church; amongst those whom they trained or who were associated with them were men like Thomas à Kempis, Dierick Maertens, Gabriel Biel, the physician Vesalius, Jan Standonck (1454–1504), priest and reformer, Master of the Collège de Montaigu in Paris, and the Dutch Pope Adrian VI.

Another famous student of the Brethren of the Common Life was Desiderius Erasmus of Rotterdam. His mystical and scholarly efforts produced many works of literature. One of his greatest contributions to the Christian faith was a critical Greek New Testament (1514) which challenged the previous New Testament text translations (specifically the Vulgate). Commonly called Erasmus, he embraced ecclesiastical structure yet challenged the Augustinian view (people do not choose God, but God is the only one who brings people into grace and salvation), the nature of the human will, and the corruption and problems of the late medieval church.

Martin Luther studied under the Brethren of the Common Life at Magdeburg before going on to the University of Erfurt.

Through the trade connections of the Dutch Hanseatic cities Deventer and Zwolle the ideas of the Modern devotion spread over the whole of the Hanseatic trade area. Before the fifteenth century closed, the Brethren of the Common Life had placed in all Germany and the Netherlands schools in which teaching was offered &quot;for the love of God alone.&quot;

Gradually the course of study, at first elementary, embraced the humanities, philosophy, and theology. The religious orders were not impressed, as the Brethren were neither monks nor friars, but they were protected by Popes Eugene IV, Pius II, and Sixtus IV. Cardinal Nicholas of Cusa had been their pupil and so became their staunch protector and benefactor. He was also the patron of Rudolph Agricola (Rudolf de Boer), who in his youth at Zwolle had studied under Thomas à Kempis; and through this connection the Brethren of the Common Life, through Cusa and Agricola, influenced Erasmus and other adepts in the New Learning. More than half of the crowded schools —(in 1500, Deventer had over two thousand students) were swept away in the religious troubles of the sixteenth century. Others languished until the French Revolution, while the rise of universities, the creation of diocesan seminaries, and the competition of new teaching orders gradually extinguished the schools that regarded Deventer and Windesheim as their parent establishments.

=== Impact ===
A 2016 study in the &quot;Economic Journal&quot; finds that the Brethren of the Common Life &quot;contributed to the high rates of literacy, to the high level of book production and to city growth in the Netherlands.&quot;

==Lutheran community in Herford==
Of the hundred or so men&#x27;s and women&#x27;s houses, only a single community adopted Lutheranism at the Reformation. 

The community of the Brethren in Herford went over bodily to the Reformation, but the local council nonetheless threatened to close their house. The Brethren wrote to Martin Luther 1532, who defended their community life by writing to the council of the city. To Jacob Montanus and Gerhard Wilskamp he wrote in the end of January 1532: &quot;Your way of life, since you teach and live according to the Gospel, pleases me no end&quot;. If only &quot;there had been, and today there were more convents like yours!...Abide by your way of life and use it to spread the Gospel (as you do)!&quot; The house of the Brethren of the Common Life in Herford remained in existence as a Lutheran brotherhood until 1841.

==Revived congregation==

Since 1975, there is in Germany a revived Congregation of the Brothers of the Common Life, . It is a constituent member of the Confederation of Canons Regular of St Augustine, its pronominal being CRVC. The superior general of the congregation, Richard Lehmann-Dronke, resides in the motherhouse in Maria Bronnen. Since 2000, the community has also had pastoral care for the Marian shrine of Waghäusel in Nordbaden.

<text>Robert Alan Edwards (May 16, 1947 – February 10, 2024) was an American broadcast journalist who was a Peabody Award-winning member of the National Radio Hall of Fame. He hosted both of National Public Radio&#x27;s flagship news programs, the afternoon &quot;All Things Considered&quot;, and &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, where he was the first and longest serving host in the latter program&#x27;s history. Starting in 2004, Edwards hosted &quot;The Bob Edwards Show&quot; on Sirius XM Radio and &quot;Bob Edwards Weekend&quot; distributed by Public Radio International to more than 150 public radio stations. Those programs ended in September 2015.

==Early life, family and education==
Edwards was born in Louisville, Kentucky, to a homemaking mother and an accountant father. He became interested in radio, and pursuing a radio career, from a young age.

Edwards was a graduate of St. Xavier High School in 1965 and the University of Louisville in 1969. He also earned an M.A. in communication from American University in Washington, D.C., graduating in 1972.

==Career==
=== Early career ===
Edwards began his radio career in 1968 at a small radio station in New Albany, Indiana, a town located across the Ohio River from Louisville, his hometown. Afterwards, Edwards served in the U.S. Army during the Vietnam War, producing and anchoring television and radio news programs for the American Forces Korea Network from Seoul. Following his army service, he went on to anchor news for WTOP / 1500, a CBS affiliate, in Washington, D.C. In 1972, at age 25, Edwards anchored national newscasts for the Mutual Broadcasting System.

Edwards joined NPR in 1974 as a newscaster. Before hosting &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, Edwards was co-host of &quot;All Things Considered&quot;.

===Host of &quot;Morning Edition&quot;===
Edwards hosted NPR&#x27;s flagship program, &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, from the show&#x27;s inception in November 1979 until April 2004. After 24 plus years with Edwards as host, Arbitron ratings showed that, with 13 million listeners, it was the second highest-rated radio broadcast in the country, behind only Rush Limbaugh&#x27;s AM show. Prior to his departure, he was very popular among both listeners and critics.

When &quot;Morning Edition&quot; and its host won a George Foster Peabody Award in 1999, the Peabody committee lauded Edwards as

Edwards&#x27; skills as an interviewer were widely praised. NPR&#x27;s ombudsman Jeffrey Dvorkin said, &quot;If I were his producer, I would think of Edwards as NPR&#x27;s version of Charlie Rose.&quot; The New York &quot;Daily News&quot; called him &quot;an institution among &quot;Morning Edition&quot; listeners for his interviewing skills and his calm, articulate style&quot;. It is estimated that Edwards conducted over 20,000 interviews for NPR. His subjects ranged from major politicians to authors and celebrities. His weekly call-in chats with retired sportscaster Red Barber are fondly remembered. The chats were supposedly about sports, but often digressed into topics like the Gulf War, what kind of flowers were blooming at Barber&#x27;s Tallahassee, Florida home, or other non-sport subjects. Barber would call Edwards &quot;Colonel Bob,&quot; referring to Edwards&#x27; Kentucky Colonel honor from his native state.

===Departure from NPR===
In April 2004, NPR executives decided to &quot;freshen up&quot; &quot;Morning Edition&quot;″s sound. Edwards was removed as host, replaced with Steve Inskeep and Renée Montagne, and reassigned as a senior correspondent for NPR News. The move took him by surprise. &quot;I&#x27;d rather stay,&quot; he said, &quot;but it&#x27;s not my decision to make&quot;.

At first, NPR executives and spokespersons did not fully explain the move, leaving many listeners confused. Eventually they did make some attempts to explain themselves. According to NPR spokeswoman Laura Gross, &quot;It&#x27;s part of a natural evolution. A new host will bring new ideas and perspectives to the show. Bob&#x27;s voice will still be heard; he&#x27;ll still be a tremendous influence on the show. We just felt it was time for a change&quot;.

Executive Vice President Ken Stern also explained the move. &quot;This change in &quot;Morning Edition&quot; is part of the ongoing evaluation of all NPR programming that has taken place over the last several years. We&#x27;ve looked at shows like &quot;All Things Considered&quot; and &quot;Talk of the Nation&quot; with an eye to how we can best serve listeners in the future.&quot;

The decision to remove Edwards, made shortly before his 25th anniversary with the show, was met with much criticism by listeners. Jeffrey Dvorkin, NPR&#x27;s ombudsman, reported that the network received over 50,000 letters and emails, most of them angry, regarding Edwards&#x27; demotion; the listener reaction was the largest reaction on a single subject that NPR had received to that date. Other journalists, including ABC&#x27;s Cokie Roberts and CBS&#x27;s Charles Osgood, expressed dissatisfaction with the move.

His final broadcast as host was on April 30, 2004; his last &quot;Morning Edition&quot; interview was with Charles Osgood, who had also been Edwards&#x27; first Morning Edition interview subject almost 25 years earlier.

Edwards decided not to remain at NPR as a senior correspondent and filed only one story, an interview with Bob Dole and other Senate veterans of World War II about the Washington, DC, World War II memorial, in that role. Three months after his departure from &quot;Morning Edition&quot;, XM Satellite Radio announced that he had signed on to host a new program, &quot;The Bob Edwards Show&quot;, for its new XM Public Radio channel.

===Sirius XM Satellite Radio===
After leaving NPR, XM Satellite Radio offered Edwards a show so, according to Edwards, &quot;I can continue to host and be heard every day instead of occasionally, as I would have been at NPR&quot;. He said the format would be &quot;loose&quot;: &quot;It&#x27;ll be long interviews, short interviews, and then maybe departments... You&#x27;ve got to have the news ... it&#x27;s not going to be all features, yet it&#x27;s not going to be the &quot;Financial Times&quot;, either.&quot; &quot;The Bob Edwards Show&quot;″s first broadcast was on October 4, 2004. &quot;Washington Post&quot; columnist David Broder and former CBS News anchor Walter Cronkite were Edwards&#x27; first guests.

While continuing his daily show on XM, Edwards returned to public radio stations in January 2006 with his show &quot;Bob Edwards Weekend&quot;, produced by XM Satellite Radio and distributed by Public Radio International to affiliate stations around the country. A September 22, 2005 press release from PRI states, &quot;&quot;Bob Edwards Weekend&quot; will provide PRI listeners with an opportunity to sample some of the astute commentary and intriguing interviews offered to XM subscribers each weekday on &quot;The Bob Edwards Show&quot;.&quot; This was the first time that a satellite radio company provided programming to over-the-air terrestrial radio.

&quot;The Bob Edwards Show&quot; received several awards, including: the Deems Taylor Award from ASCAP (2006), a Gabriel Award from the Catholic Academy for Communication Arts Professionals (2006), The National Press Club&#x27;s Robert L. Kozic Award for Environmental Reporting (2007) for the documentary, &quot;Exploding Heritage&quot;, about mountaintop-removal coal mining. That program was also honored with a Gabriel Award, a 2006 New York Festivals Gold World Medal, and an award from the Society of Environmental Journalists.

In 2008, &quot;The Bob Edwards Show&quot; received an Edward R. Murrow Award from the Radio-Television News Directors Association and a New York Festivals / United Nations Gold Award for the documentary, &quot;The Invisible: Children without homes&quot;. &quot;The Invisible&quot; also was honored by the Journalism Center for Children and Families and by the Catholic Academy for Communication Arts Professionals.

In 2009, the show received a Sigma Delta Chi Award from the Society of Professional Journalists for the documentary, &quot;Stories from Third Med: Surviving a Jungle ER&quot;. The documentary also received a Gabriel Award. In September 2012, Edwards was named a Fellow of the Society of Professional Journalists. In 2013, the program was awarded a Robert F. Kennedy Journalism Award for the documentary, &quot;An Occupational Hazard: Rape in the military&quot;. The show&#x27;s last live episode aired on September 26, 2014.

===AARP podcast===
In July 2018, Edwards joined with AARP to host a podcast, &quot;Take On Today&quot;, which was published most Thursdays. The program covered topics of health, work, money, aging, and entertainment, including interviews and panel discussions of issues relevant to older Americans.

== Personal life ==
Edwards was married three times. His marriages to Joan Murphy and Sharon Kelly ended in divorce. He had two daughters, Eleanor and Susannah, with Sharon Kelly. He married NPR news anchor Windsor Johnston in 2011, with whom he remained until his death.

Bob Edwards died on February 10, 2024, at the age of 76, in Arlington, Virginia. His cause of death was reported to be from metastatic bladder cancer and heart failure.

==Awards and legacy==
In 1999, Edwards won a Peabody Award.

In 2003, Edwards was inducted into the Kentucky Journalism Hall of Fame. In November 2004, Edwards was inducted into the National Radio Hall of Fame.

He donated his papers and his library to American University in Washington, DC.

He held honorary degrees from the University of Louisville, Spalding University, Bellarmine University, Willamette University, Grinnell College, DePaul University, the University of St. Francis, and Albertson College (now the College of Idaho).

== Publications ==
Edwards wrote three books.

His first book, &quot;Fridays with Red: A Radio Friendship&quot;, was based on his weekly interviews with Red Barber, and was released in 1993, a year after Barber&#x27;s death.

During his final months at NPR, Edwards wrote his second book, &quot;Edward R. Murrow and the Birth of Broadcast Journalism&quot;, which was published in May 2004. The book, a short biography of Edward R. Murrow, brought some public attention to prior to the release of the 2004 film &quot;Good Night and Good Luck&quot;.

His memoir, &quot;A Voice in the Box&quot;, was published in September 2011.

<doc id="365711" wikidata="Q7660606" url="?curid=365711" title="SylvaC">
<text>SylvaC (with a deliberate capital C at the end) is a brand of British ornamental pottery characterised primarily by figurines of animals and Toby Jugs. The SylvaC company briefly ceased production in 1982 although production of SylvaC pieces was resumed in 1998 by the current trademark holder Norman Williams.

The company was founded in 1894 by William Copestake and William Shaw. They gave their names to the fledgling company - Shaw and Copestake. Copestake left in 1895, however, and Richard Hull became Shaw&#x27;s partner. Hull&#x27;s son joined in 1936 and in 1938 the Thomas Lawrence Falcon Pottery was bought (which produced pottery with the distinctive &#x27;falcon&#x27; mark on it). However, the Shaw and Copestake company maintained its original name right up until the end.

Central to the SylvaC line throughout its history were figurines of animals, and rabbits in particular. Dogs were also popular and virtually every breed ended-up being characterised in pottery. Many variations of Toby Jugs were produced, including &#x27;character&#x27; versions which celebrated events or tied into product advertising.

Although many colours and glazes were used, most people remember the distinctive orange or green glazes most.

SylvaC pieces are not rare; however, they are becoming collectable, and the best pieces can fetch high prices. There is a common belief that pieces made after 1982 are fakes or somehow &quot;less&quot; SylvaC than pieces made before then. As with any collectable, there is a vested interest in keeping prices high despite the fact that SylvaC was never particularly expensive to produce and not in any sense rare and certainly never meant to be high art. 

The Falconware/SylvaC brands have passed through many hands since the days of Shaw&amp;Copestake and the notion of a &quot;Golden Era&quot; of SylvaC is a very modern construct that has had a detrimental effect on all of the great pottery houses, especially those based in Stoke-on-Trent.

<doc id="365715" wikidata="Q220402" url="?curid=365715" title="Timothy Gowers">
<text>Sir William Timothy Gowers, (; born 20 November 1963) is a British mathematician. He is Professeur titulaire of the Combinatorics chair at the Collège de France, and director of research at the University of Cambridge and Fellow of Trinity College, Cambridge. In 1998, he received the Fields Medal for research connecting the fields of functional analysis and combinatorics.

==Education==
Gowers attended King&#x27;s College School, Cambridge, as a choirboy in the King&#x27;s College choir, and then Eton College as a King&#x27;s Scholar, where he was taught mathematics by Norman Routledge. In 1981, Gowers won a gold medal at the International Mathematical Olympiad with a perfect score. He completed his PhD, with a dissertation on &quot;Symmetric Structures in Banach Spaces&quot; at Trinity College, Cambridge in 1990, supervised by Béla Bollobás.

==Career and research==
After his PhD, Gowers was elected to a Junior Research Fellowship at Trinity College. From 1991 until his return to Cambridge in 1995 he was lecturer at University College London. He was elected to the Rouse Ball Professorship at Cambridge in 1998. During 2000–2 he was visiting professor at Princeton University. In May 2020 it was announced that he would be assuming the title &quot;chaire de combinatoire&quot; at the College de France beginning in October 2020, though he intends to continue to reside in Cambridge and maintain a part-time affiliation at the university, as well as enjoy the privileges of his life fellowship of Trinity College.

Gowers initially worked on Banach spaces. He used combinatorial tools in proving several of Stefan Banach&#x27;s conjectures in the subject, in particular constructing a Banach space with almost no symmetry, serving as a counterexample to several other conjectures. With Bernard Maurey he resolved the &quot;unconditional basic sequence problem&quot; in 1992, showing that not every infinite-dimensional Banach space has an infinite-dimensional subspace that admits an unconditional Schauder basis.

After this, Gowers turned to combinatorics and combinatorial number theory. In 1997 he proved that the Szemerédi regularity lemma necessarily comes with tower-type bounds.

In 1998, Gowers proved the first effective bounds for Szemerédi&#x27;s theorem, showing that any subset formula_1 free of &quot;k&quot;-term arithmetic progressions has cardinality formula_2 for an appropriate formula_3. One of the ingredients in Gowers&#x27;s argument is a tool now known as the Balog–Szemerédi–Gowers theorem, which has found many further applications. He also introduced the Gowers norms, a tool in arithmetic combinatorics, and provided the basic techniques for analysing them. This work was further developed by Ben Green and Terence Tao, leading to the Green–Tao theorem.

In 2003, Gowers established a regularity lemma for hypergraphs, analogous to the Szemerédi regularity lemma for graphs.

In 2005, he introduced the notion of a quasirandom group.

More recently, Gowers has worked on Ramsey theory in random graphs and random sets with David Conlon, and has turned his attention to other problems such as the P versus NP problem. He has also developed an interest, in joint work with Mohan Ganesalingam, in automated problem solving.

Gowers has an Erdős number of three.

===Popularisation work===
Gowers has written several works popularising mathematics, including &quot;Mathematics: A Very Short Introduction&quot; (2002), which describes modern mathematical research for the general reader. He was consulted about the 2005 film &quot;Proof&quot;, starring Gwyneth Paltrow and Anthony Hopkins. He edited &quot;The Princeton Companion to Mathematics&quot; (2008), which traces the development of various branches and concepts of modern mathematics. For his work on this book, he won the 2011 Euler Book Prize of the Mathematical Association of America. In May 2020 he was made a professor at the Collège de France, a historic institution dedicated to popularising science.

===Blogging===

After asking on his blog whether &quot;massively collaborative mathematics&quot; was possible, he solicited comments on his blog from people who wanted to try to solve mathematical problems collaboratively. The first problem in what is called the Polymath Project, Polymath1, was to find a new combinatorial proof to the density version of the Hales–Jewett theorem. After seven weeks, Gowers wrote on his blog that the problem was &quot;probably solved&quot;.

In 2009, with Olof Sisask and Alex Frolkin, he invited people to post comments to his blog to contribute to a collection of methods of mathematical problem solving. Contributors to this Wikipedia-style project, called Tricki.org, include Terence Tao and Ben Green.

In 2012, Gowers posted to his blog to call for a boycott of the publishing house Elsevier. A petition ensued, branded the Cost of Knowledge project, in which researchers commit to stop supporting Elsevier journals. Commenting on the petition in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, Alok Jha credited Gowers with starting an Academic Spring.

In 2016, Gowers started Discrete Analysis to demonstrate that a high-quality mathematics journal could be inexpensively produced outside of the traditional academic publishing industry.

===Awards and honours===
In 1994, Gowers was an invited speaker at the International Congress of Mathematicians in Zurich where he discussed the theory of infinite-dimensional Banach spaces. In 1996, Gowers received the Prize of the European Mathematical Society, and in 1998 the Fields Medal for research on functional analysis and combinatorics. In 1999 he became a Fellow of the Royal Society and a member of the American Philosophical Society in 2010. In 2012 he was knighted by the British monarch for services to mathematics. He also sits on the selection committee for the Mathematics award, given under the auspices of the Shaw Prize. He was listed in Nature&#x27;s 10 people who mattered in 2012.

==Personal life==
Timothy Gowers was born on 20 November 1963, in Marlborough, Wiltshire, England.

Gowers&#x27;s father was Patrick Gowers, a composer; his great-grandfather was Sir Ernest Gowers, a British civil servant who was best known for guides to English usage; and his great-great-grandfather was Sir William Gowers, a neurologist. He has two siblings, the writer Rebecca Gowers, and the violinist Katharine Gowers. He has five children and plays jazz piano.

In November 2012, Gowers opted to undergo catheter ablation to treat a sporadic atrial fibrillation, after performing a mathematical risk–benefit analysis to decide whether to have the treatment.

In 1988, Gowers married Emily Thomas, a classicist and Cambridge academic: they divorced in 2007. Together they had three children. In 2008, he married for a second time, to Julie Barrau, a University Lecturer in British Medieval History at the University of Cambridge. They have two children together.

<text>The Houston Museum District is an association of 21 museums, cultural centers and community organizations located in Houston, Texas, dedicated to promoting art, science, history, and culture.

The Houston Museum District currently includes 21 museums that recorded a collective attendance of around 7 million visitors a year. All of the museums offer free times or days and 11 of the museums are free all the time. Thursdays the Museum District gets particularly crowded because of museum free days. On Thursdays, The Children&#x27;s Museum of Houston is free after 5 p.m., The Health Museum is free from 2–7 pm, and the Museum of Fine Arts, Houston is free 11 am - 9 pm. The Houston Museum of Natural Science is free on Tuesdays between 5-8 pm.

Houston&#x27;s Museum District is walkable and bikeable. Sidewalks are wide and well-maintained, and attractions and restaurants are situated near each other.

The district is bordered roughly by Texas State Highway 288, Hermann Park, U.S. Route 59, and the Texas Medical Center. The Museum District Civic Association compared the area to Georgetown in Washington, D.C., and to the French Quarter of New Orleans.

The Museum District is served by four stops on the METRORail, one specifically named for it and is easily accessible from I-69/US 59, State Highway 288 and Main Street, across from the main entrance to Rice University.

The beginnings of the Museum District are found in 1977, when it became apparent that some action needed to be taken to provide easier access to the museums of the area. This call for community improvement evolved into the non-profit Montrose Project by the mid-1980s but changed into the Museum District Development Association of Houston (MDDAH) shortly thereafter. Based on the works of this organization, the Museum District was formally recognized by the City of Houston in 1989. The founding organization was dissolved in 1994, but the Museum District is now under the auspices of the Houston Museum District Association, founded in 1997.

The Museum District attracts visitors, students and volunteers of all ages, backgrounds, and ethnicities to learn about and celebrate art, history, culture, and nature around the world. More information on the 21 institutions of Houston&#x27;s Museum District may be found on their official website.

==History==
In the late 1970s, the area currently including the Houston Museum District had fallen into disrepair, badly needing attention from local, county and state governments to improve roads and beautify the area, then unsafe for pedestrian traffic and cyclists.

The Houston Museum District began as a grassroots community movement in 1977 led by Alexandra R. Marshall whose concept was to create a pedestrian-friendly district with the Museum of Fine Arts, at the intersection of Bissonnet Street and Montrose Boulevard, as its core. In such a strongly vehicle-oriented city, and one which to this day retains the title of the largest city in the United States without zoning, this was fairly progressive.

The Museum District Development Association of Houston proposed a multi-phase plan to beautify and make more pedestrian-friendly the area located between Allen Parkway, Buffalo Bayou and Hermann Park. It took advantage of the opportunity to create in Houston an area of vital urban importance, similar to the French Quarter in New Orleans, St. Germain in Paris, and Georgetown in Washington, DC.

Since its creation, the numerous efforts of the Houston Museum District organizations have included community improvement projects, tree planting, sidewalk planning, construction and expansion, esplanade design, development and beautification, establishment of public transportation to and from the area, police support and various cultural events
The Montrose Association, the Museum Area Municipal Association, the South Main Civic Association, the Cultural Arts Center of Houston and TALA (Texas Accountants and Lawyers for the Arts) all played a part in the development and subsequent success in the creation of the Houston Museum District.

==Funding==
Originally, funding was completely based on private sources—association member dues and members&#x27; donations. Later, with growing awareness of the MDDAH and their work, funding came from numerous other sources.

Today, total operating budgets for the member museums are funded almost completely from revenues and private donations. Museum District funding includes contributions from all participating museums; foundation support from The Houston Endowment, Inc.; The John P. McGovern Foundation; and The Wortham Foundation, Inc.

==Public issues==

The District plays an ongoing role in forming responses to public concerns and opportunities that include transportation improvements, signage, visitor information, area beautification, flood control and urban planning considerations.
The HMDA also serves as an intermediary, which fosters an ongoing dialogue among the museums in the district to maintain continuing interest and visitation in the area.

==Residential areas==
Museum Park Neighborhood Association (MPNA) serves houses roughly bound by Texas State Highway 288, Hermann Park, Main Street, and Alabama Street. Several apartment and/or condo communities are already in the area and new ones are currently being built and developed. One benefit of living at The Circle at Hermann Park, The Mosaic, The Parklane, The Plaza, The Warwick, or new residential communities being built is that residents enjoy easy walking distance to the Houston Zoo, The Children&#x27;s Museum Houston, The Houston Museum of Natural Science, Miller Outdoor Theatre, Hermann Park, The Museum of Fine Arts, Houston, and more.

In 2003 Keiji Asakura of SLA Studio Land presented the Museum District Walk Project, a project to expand walkability in the area. In 2015 a walkability study came from SWA Group.

By 2018 residential condominiums became a popular form of residence in the community.

==Parking==
Parking in the Houston Museum District can be tricky if you visit on Thursdays, weekends, HISD Spring/Summer/Winter vacation days, or evenings when Miller Outdoor Theatre is hosting a popular show. A parking lot adjacent to the McGovern Centennial Gardens on Hermann Drive was added in 2014. You may park there for free. Parking in the lot across from the Law Building at MFAH is also free. You may also park at the zoo or in the lot near the Rice University Light Rail Station for free (there is a 3-hour time limit). You may pay to park along Hermann Drive or on side streets, in the HMNS garage, or in various garages. You may also park along the MetroRail Line and take the light rail train to Rice University or The Museum District stops.

==Education==

===Primary and secondary schools===
The Houston Independent School District (HISD) operates area public schools.

Elementary schools serving portions of the Museum District area:
* MacGregor
* Poe

Middle schools serving portions of the Museum District area:
* Cullen (east of Fannin Street and Montrose Boulevard)
* Lanier (west of Fannin Street and Montrose Boulevard)
Beginning in 2018 Baylor College of Medicine Academy at Ryan also serves as a boundary option for students zoned to Blackshear, Lockhart, and MacGregor elementary schools.

Lamar High School serves houses in the Museum District area.

Presbyterian School is located in the Museum District. The Post Oak High School, a private Montessori high school, opened in the northern hemisphere fall of 2012. It is the first high school in the Museum District.

In 2013 Houston A+ Challenge announced that the private middle school A+ Unlimited Potential would open in the Museum District area.

===Public libraries===

The Houston Public Library Clayton Library, Center for Genealogical Research is located in the Museum District. The genealogical collection, originally housed in the Julia Ideson Building in Downtown Houston, moved to the William Clayton Home, a Georgian-style house built in 1917, in the Museum District in 1968. A site for a new building, adjacent to the Clayton Home, was purchased in 1986. The new building, which was built in 1988, was designed to complement the Clayton Home. The city implemented a $6.8 million renovation project for the Clayton Home and the guest house and carriage house on the property in the 2000s. The city planned to renovate the property so it would meet LEED standards. The city installed an elevator in the guest house so the building could be used as an administrative office. The carriage house received an addition so it could function as a 100-person conference room. The Clayton site can accommodate one plenary session and four breakout meetings, which would be required for a national genealogical conference. The &quot;Houston Business Journal&quot; awarded the renovation as the best historic renovation for its 2009 Landmark Awards. There is also a branch of the Houston Public Library in the Children&#x27;s Museum of Houston.

==Religion==
First Presbyterian Church is located in the Museum District. St. Mathew&#x27;s Lutheran Church and St. Paul&#x27;s United Methodist Church are located in the Museum District.
