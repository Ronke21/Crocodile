<text>Mopsuestia ( and Μόψου &quot;Mopsou&quot; and Μόψου πόλις and Μόψος; Byzantine Greek: &quot;Mamista&quot;, &quot;Manistra&quot;, &quot;Mampsista&quot;; Arabic: &quot;al-Maṣṣīṣah&quot;; Armenian: &quot;Msis&quot;, &quot;Mises&quot;, &quot;Mam(u)estia&quot;; modern Yakapınar) is an ancient city in Cilicia Campestris on the Pyramus River (now the Ceyhan River) located approximately east of ancient Antiochia in Cilicia (present-day Adana, southern Turkey). From the city&#x27;s harbor, the river is navigable to the Mediterranean Sea, a distance of over 40 km (24 mi).

The 1879 book &quot;A Latin Dictionary&quot;, the 1898 book &quot;Dictionary of Classical Antiquities&quot;, the 1913 &quot;Catholic Encyclopedia&quot; and the 1920 &quot;La Cilicie&quot; mention that the city at that time was called Missis or Messis, but in 1960 the name changed to Yakapınar.

==History==
The founding of this city is attributed to the seer Mopsus, from whom the city also took its name, who lived before the Trojan War, although it is scarcely mentioned before the Christian era. The name has been glossed as , &quot;The house (hestia) of Mopsus&quot;. Pliny the Elder calls it the free city of Mopsos (&quot;Hist. nat.&quot;, V, 22), but the ordinary name is Mopsuestia, as found in Stephanus of Byzantium and all the Christian geographers and chroniclers. Under the Seleucid Empire, the city took the name of Seleucia on the Pyramus (classical Greek: Σελεύκεια πρὸς τὸν Πύραμον, &quot;Seleukeia pros ton Pyramon&quot;; ), but gave it up at the time of the Roman conquest. Coins and inscriptions show that under Hadrian it was called Hadriana, under Decius Decia, and so forth. Constantius II built there a magnificent bridge over the Pyramus (Malalas, &quot;Chronographia&quot;, XIII; P.G., XCVII, 488) afterwards restored by Justinian (Procopius, &quot;De Edificiis&quot;, V. 5) and has been restored again recently.

Near the city a battle between the Antiochus X Eusebes, son of Antiochus IX Cyzicenus, and Seleucus VI Epiphanes was fought. Antiochus won and Seleucus took shelter in Mopsuestia, but the citizens of Mopsuestia killed him. His brothers Antiochus XI and Philip I destroyed Mopsuestia as an act of revenge and their armies fought those of Antiochus X, but they lost.

Christianity seems to have been introduced very early into Mopsuestia, and during the 3rd century, there is mention of a bishop, Theodorus, the adversary of Paul of Samosata. Other famous residents of the early Christian period in the city&#x27;s history include Saint Auxentius (d. 360), and Theodore, bishop from 392–428, the teacher of Nestorius. The bishopric is included in the Catholic Church&#x27;s list of titular sees. Along with much of Cilicia, the region was wrested from Roman control by the Arabs in the late 630s.

In 684 the Emperor Constantine IV recaptured Misis from its small Arab garrison and it remained an imperial possession until 703 (Theophanes, &quot;Chronogr.&quot;, A. M. 6178, 6193), when it was recaptured by the Arabs, who rebuilt the fortifications, constructed a mosque, and maintained a permanent garrison. Because of its position on the frontier, the city was repeatedly fought over and was recaptured from time to time by the Byzantines: it was besieged in vain by the Byzantine troops of John I Tzimisces in 964, but was taken the following year after a long and difficult siege by Nicephorus Phocas.
Mopsuestia then numbered 200,000 inhabitants, some of whom were Muslim, and the Byzantines made efforts to re-Christianize the city. In the early 1090s, Turkish forces overran the town, but were expelled in 1097 by Crusader troops under Tancred who took possession of the city and its strategic port, which were annexed to the Principality of Antioch. It suffered much from the internecine war between Crusaders, Armenians, and Greeks who lost it and recaptured it, notably in 1106, 1132, and 1137. Finally, in 1151–1152 the Armenian Baron T&#x27;oros II captured the city and defeated the Greek counterattack led by Andronikos I Komnenos. Thereafter it remained a possession of the Armenian Kingdom of Cilicia, but was briefly captured and plundered by the Mamluks in 1266, 1275, and 1322. The Venetians and Genoese were licensed by the Armenians to maintain warehouses near the harbor to store goods brought from India. The Armenians were permanently evicted by the Mamluks in 1347. The city was the site of several church councils and possessed four Armenian churches; the Greek diocese still existed at the beginning of the fourteenth century (Le Quien, &quot;Oriens Christianus&quot;, II, 1002). In 1432 the Frenchman Bertrandon reported that the city was ruled by the Muslims and was largely destroyed. In 1515 Mopsuestia, and the whole of Cilicia was incorporated into the Ottoman Empire by Sultan Selim I. Since then it has steadily declined and became the small village of &quot;Misis&quot;. Misis was renamed &quot;Yakapınar&quot; in the 1960s. Only fragments of the medieval fortifications survive today. However, an etching of the circuit walls and towers was made in the mid-19th century. The Misis Mosaic Museum was founded in 1959 to exhibit the mosaics found in the area, including the famous &quot;Samson Mosaic&quot;.

Victor Langlois wrote that he found a beautiful Greek inscription at the city and while he was trying to move it to France, the inscription fell in the Pyramus River.

<doc id="359670" wikidata="Q310989" url="?curid=359670" title="Dick Fosbury">
<text>Richard Douglas Fosbury (March 6, 1947 – March 12, 2023) was an American high jumper, who is considered one of the most influential athletes in the history of track and field. He won a gold medal at the 1968 Summer Olympics, revolutionizing the high jump event with a &quot;back-first&quot; technique now known as the Fosbury flop. His method was to sprint diagonally towards the bar, then curve and leap backward over the bar, which gave him a much lower center of mass in flight than traditional techniques. Debbie Brill was developing her similar &quot;Brill Bend&quot; around the same time. This approach has seen nearly universal adoption since Fosbury&#x27;s performance in Mexico. Though he never returned to the Olympics, Fosbury continued to be involved in athletics after retirement and served on the executive board of the World Olympians Association.

In 2014, Fosbury challenged Steve Miller for a seat in the Idaho House of Representatives, but was unsuccessful. Fosbury ran for Blaine County Commissioner against incumbent Larry Schoen in 2018, won the seat, and took office in 2019.

==Athletic career==

===High school and the origins of the Fosbury Flop===


Born in Portland, Oregon, Fosbury started experimenting with a new high-jumping technique at age 16, while attending Medford High School. Fosbury had difficulty competing using the dominant high-jumping techniques of the period. In his second year, he failed to complete jumps of , the qualifying height for many high-school track meets. This dominant technique, the straddle method, was a complex motion where an athlete went over the high-jump bar facing down, and lifted their legs individually over the bar. Fosbury found it difficult to coordinate all the motions involved in the straddle method, so he began to experiment with other ways of doing the high jump.

Fosbury later recalled, &quot;I knew I had to change my body position and that&#x27;s what started first the revolution, and over the next two years, the evolution.&quot; At first, he tried to use a technique known as the upright scissors method. In this method, a jumper runs upright towards the bar, facing forward, and during their jump lifts their straight legs one at a time over the bar. High-jump rules stipulate only that competitors must jump off one foot at takeoff; there is no rule governing how a competitor crosses the bar, so long as they go over it.

As he began to experiment with this technique, he gradually adapted it to make himself more comfortable and to get more height out of it. Nonetheless, it was nowhere near as coordinated as a well-performed straddle method jump, and one historian has referred to Fosbury&#x27;s early attempts as an &quot;airborne seizure&quot;. However, during the latter part of his second year and the beginning of his junior year, it started to produce results, and he gradually was able to clear higher jumps.

Gradually, Fosbury shifted his positioning during the jump, such that by his senior year he had begun to go over the bar backward, head-first, curving his body over the bar and kicking his legs up in the air at the end of the jump. This required him to land on his back, but, prior to his junior year, his high school had replaced its wood chip landing pit with a softer material, so he was able to land safely.

Luckily for Fosbury, replacement of landing surfaces with foam rubber was becoming common across the United States in the early 1960s. Sawdust, sand, or woodchip surfaces had been usable previously because jumpers using the scissors technique were able to clear the bar while upright and then land on their feet, and those using the Western Roll or Straddle made a three-point landing on their hands and lead leg. In the late 1950s, U.S. colleges began to use bundles of soft foam rubber, usually held together by a mesh net. These bundles were not only much softer, but were also elevated about off the ground. By the early 1960s, U.S. high schools were following the lead of the colleges in acquiring foam rubber landing pits. With the softer, elevated landing surface, Fosbury was able to land safely.

Fosbury did, however, compress a couple of vertebrae in the mid-1960s because not all high schools could afford the upgraded, foam material. Fosbury recovered from this injury.

Fosbury&#x27;s coaches at first encouraged him to continue practicing the straddle method, but they abandoned that idea when his marks continued to improve. In his junior year, he broke his high-school record with a jump, and the next year took second place in the state with a jump.

The technique gained the name the &quot;Fosbury Flop&quot; when in 1964 the &quot;Medford Mail-Tribune&quot; ran a photo captioned &quot;Fosbury Flops Over Bar,&quot; while in an accompanying article a reporter wrote that he looked like &quot;a fish flopping in a boat.&quot; Others were even less kind, with one newspaper captioning Fosbury&#x27;s photograph, &quot;World&#x27;s Laziest High Jumper&quot;.

===College===
After graduating from Medford High School in 1965, he enrolled at Oregon State University in Corvallis. The school&#x27;s coach, Berny Wagner, believed that Fosbury would eventually achieve greater results using the western roll and convinced him to continue practicing the old technique through his first year, although he was allowed to use the &quot;flop&quot; in freshman meets. The debate over technique ended during Fosbury&#x27;s second year, however, when he cleared in his first meet of the season, shattering the school record.

Fosbury later recalled:

After the meet, Berny came up to me and said, &quot;That&#x27;s enough.&quot; That was the end of Plan A, on to Plan B. He would study what I was doing, film it, and even start to try to experiment and teach it to the younger jumpers.

The national sports media began to take notice of the jumper from Oregon with the unusual style. He was on the cover of &quot;Track and Field News&#x27;s&quot; February 1968 issue. Fosbury won the 1968 National Collegiate Athletic Association (NCAA) title using his new technique—the first of two consecutive titles—as well as the United States Olympic Trials.

Fosbury continued to refine his technique, developing a curved, J-shaped approach run. This allowed him to increase his speed, while the final &quot;curved&quot; steps served to rotate his hips. As his speed increased, so did his elevation. Fosbury made little to no use of his arms at takeoff, failing to &quot;pump&quot; them upwards, keeping them down, close to his body; the next generation of floppers would add an arm pump. Fosbury&#x27;s key discovery was the need to adjust his point of takeoff as the bar was raised. His flight through the air described a parabola: as the bar went up in height, he needed more &quot;flight time&quot; so that the top of his arc was achieved as his hips passed over the bar. To increase &quot;flight time&quot;, Fosbury moved his takeoff further and further away from the bar (and the pit). Jumpers have a natural tendency to be drawn in closer to the bar and it requires mental discipline to move out, rather than in. By way of comparison, classic straddle jumpers plant their take-off foot in the same place every time, less than one foot away from a line parallel with the bar. Photographs of Fosbury attempting heights above show him taking off nearly out from the bar.

In the 1968 outdoor season, Fosbury won the Pac-8 Conference title and went on to win the NCAA championship at Berkeley, California, in mid-June with a jump of . He duplicated those wins the following year.

===Fosbury at the 1968 Summer Olympics===

Fresh off his NCAA win in mid-June, Fosbury went on to win the U.S. Olympic trials two weeks later in Los Angeles with a jump of . Despite the win, his place on the Olympic team was not assured because the U.S. Olympic Committee was worried that the results at sea-level Los Angeles might not be replicated at the high altitude in Mexico City. Another competition was held in September at the Olympic camp at Echo Summit near South Lake Tahoe, California. At that competition, Fosbury was one of four men to clear , but he was in fourth place because of misses. The bar was raised to , a height none of the four had ever cleared. However, Olympic veteran Ed Caruthers, high schooler Reynaldo Brown, and Fosbury all cleared on their first attempts. When the fourth man, John Hartfield, another high schooler who had been leading the competition, missed all three of his attempts, the Olympic team of three jumpers was set.

At the 1968 Olympics in Mexico City, Fosbury took the gold medal and set a new Olympic record at , displaying the potential of the new technique. Despite the initial skeptical reactions from the high-jumping community, the &quot;Fosbury Flop&quot; quickly gained acceptance. In the Finals competition, only three jumpers cleared , and Fosbury was in the lead by virtue of having cleared every height on his first attempt. At the next height, , Fosbury again cleared the bar on his first jump. His teammate, Ed Caruthers, cleared on his second effort, while Valentin Gavrilov of the Soviet Union missed on all three attempts and earned the bronze medal (third place). The bar was raised to , which would be new Olympic and United States records. Fosbury missed on his first two attempts, but cleared on his third, while Caruthers missed on all three of his attempts. Having won the gold medal and broken the American record, Fosbury asked the bar to be raised to for his final three attempts, hoping to break Valeriy Brumel&#x27;s five-year-old world record of . He took three attempts at in an attempt to break the world record, but did not prevail.

===Athletic legacy and the dominance of the Flop===
At the next Olympics in 1972 at Munich, 28 of the 40 competitors used Fosbury&#x27;s technique, although gold medalist Jüri Tarmak used the straddle technique. In the women&#x27;s event, the winner Ulrike Meyfarth used Fosbury&#x27;s technique. By 1980, 13 of the 16 Olympic finalists used it. Of the 36 Olympic medalists in the event from 1972 through 2000, 34 used &quot;the Flop&quot;, making it the most popular technique in high jumping.

Fosbury was inducted into the National Track and Field Hall of Fame in 1981.

In 1988, Fosbury competed in the Masters Outdoor Nike World Games and taught at the jump clinic held during the meet.

In 2013, Fosbury&#x27;s high jump appeared in a Mazda commercial portraying &quot;Game Changers&quot; and, with Fosbury himself, in an ad for Wuaki TV.

In 2015, Swedish DJ and Producer Avicii released the music video for &quot;Broken Arrows&quot; (with lyrics by Zac Brown) that is loosely based on Fosbury&#x27;s high-jumping story and personal life.

In 2020, SuperWest Sports included Fosbury in its list of The Greatest Pac-12 Male Track and Field Athletes of All Time, naming him the best-ever at Oregon State University.

==Politics==
After the national anthem during his Olympic medal ceremony, Fosbury stated that he raised his fist in solidarity with the earlier civil rights protest at the games. After returning to university, Fosbury also stood up for a black football player who was removed from the Oregon State University team after refusing to shave his facial hair.

In fall 2014, Fosbury ran as a Democrat for a seat in the Idaho House of Representatives against incumbent Republican Representative Steve Miller. Miller won the election.

In January 2019, Fosbury succeeded Larry Schoen as Blaine County Commissioner.

==Personal life==
Fosbury graduated from Oregon State University in 1972 with a degree in civil engineering and was the co-owner of Galena Engineering, Inc. in Ketchum, Idaho, where he lived from 1977.

In March 2008, Fosbury was diagnosed with stage-one lymphoma. He had surgery a month later to remove a cancerous tumor engulfing his lower vertebra. Due to concerns about the tumor&#x27;s proximity to the spine, it was not completely removed and he was put on a chemotherapy regimen. In March 2009, Fosbury announced that he was in remission. In March 2014, he stated in an interview with the &quot;Corvallis Gazette-Times&quot; that he was &quot;doing well&quot; and was &quot;clear of cancer.&quot;

During the 2008 edition of &quot;Sport Movies &amp; TV – Milano International FICTS Fest&quot;, Fosbury was awarded the Excellence Guirlande d&#x27;Honneur and entered in the FICTS &quot;Hall of Fame&quot;.

Fosbury was a member of the &quot;Champions for Peace&quot; club, a group of 54 famous elite athletes committed to serving peace in the world through sport, created by Peace and Sport, a Monaco-based international organization.

Fosbury, along with fellow Olympians Gary Hall and Anne Cribbs, was a founder of World Fit, a non-profit organization that promotes youth fitness programs and Olympic ideals.

Fosbury died on March 12, 2023, aged 76, after a short bout with a recurrence of lymphoma; he was survived by his wife Robin.

<doc id="359671" wikidata="Q299636" url="?curid=359671" title="Michael Adams (chess player)">
<text>Michael Adams (born 17 November 1971) is an English chess grandmaster and is an eight-time British Chess Champion. His highest ranking is world No. 4, achieved several times from October 2000 to October 2002. His peak Elo rating is 2761, the highest achieved by an English chess player.

Several times a World Championship Candidate, he reached the semifinals in 1997, 1999 and 2000. He reached the final at the 2004 FIDE Championship, narrowly losing out to Rustam Kasimdzhanov in the tie-break games.

Adams won the World Senior Chess Championship (Over-50 category) in 2023.

==Early career==
Adams was born on 17 November 1971 in Truro, Cornwall, UK. By 1980, his chess talent had been recognised by the British Chess Federation, and he received high-level coaching from former European Junior Champion Shaun Taulbut and coaching from local chess champion Michael Prettejohn. In 1981, aged nine, Adams entered the Cornwall (County) Under-9 Championship and won it. He won the Under-13, Under-15 and Under-18 Championships at the same event. The last two contests clashed for one day, and he had to play them simultaneously, commuting cautiously between different rooms, some thirty metres apart.

In 1987, he took the silver medal at the World Under-16 Championship, held in Innsbruck, behind the Icelandic player Hannes Stefánsson. Later that year, at the age of fifteen, he became the world&#x27;s youngest International Master (IM).

Two books co-written with his father, Bill Adams, &quot;Development of a Grandmaster&quot; (1991) and &quot;Chess in the Fast Lane&quot; (1996), discuss his early chess career.
In 1988 a television documentary was screened nationwide featuring Adams and Gary Lane. It is now regularly screened at chess film festivals.

==National success==
Adams&#x27; early endeavours were already beginning to pay dividends at the British Championship of 1987, where he gained his final IM norm and took the best junior prize. He proceeded to win the full Championship title in 1989, at just seventeen years old. He won again in 1997, jointly with Matthew Sadler. Then, after a lengthy break from the event, he returned to claim further titles in 2010, 2011, 2016, 2018, 2019 and 2023.

His win at the British Chess Championship 2016 with 10/11 tied the record score set by Julian Hodgson in 1992.

Adams also won the British Rapidplay Championship in 1995, 1996 and 1999.

== World Championship candidate ==
Adams has performed strongly in several World Chess Championship tournaments.

In 1993 he finished equal first (with Viswanathan Anand) in the Groningen Interzonal tournament to determine challengers for the PCA World Chess Championship 1995. This took him to the Candidates Tournament matches, where he beat Sergei Tiviakov in the quarter-finals but lost to Anand in the semifinals.

He also qualified for the Candidates Tournament for the FIDE World Chess Championship 1996, losing to Boris Gelfand in the first round of matches.

In 1997, he took part in the 1997–1998 FIDE World Championship, which, for the first time, was a large knockout event, the winner of which would play a match against reigning champion Anatoly Karpov. This tournament included most of the world&#x27;s top players (Garry Kasparov, Vladimir Kramnik, and Gata Kamsky were the only notable absentees), and Adams won short matches against Tamaz Giorgadze, Sergei Tiviakov, Peter Svidler, Loek van Wely and Nigel Short, before coming up against Anand in the final round. Their four games at normal time controls were all drawn, as were four rapidplay games at quicker time limits before Anand won the sudden-death game, thereby eliminating Adams from the competition.

The 1999 FIDE World Championship resulted in another semifinal finish for Adams before losing to Vladimir Akopian. Nevertheless, he reached the semifinals of the 2000 FIDE World Championship before losing to eventual winner Anand. In the 2002 FIDE World Championship he won his first three rounds before being knocked out in the &#x27;round of 16&#x27; by Peter Svidler.

Adams came closest to claiming a world title at the 2004 FIDE Championship when he reached the final, winning matches against Hussein Asabri, Karen Asrian, Hichem Hamdouchi, Hikaru Nakamura, Vladimir Akopian and Teimour Radjabov. However, he lost to Rustam Kasimdzhanov in the final (3½–4½ after rapidplay tie-breaks, the match having been tied 3–3 after the six standard games).

As runner-up in the 2004 event, Adams was one of eight players invited to the FIDE World Chess Championship 2005. He finished in equal sixth–seventh place, with a score of 5½ out of 14.

In May–June 2007, Adams participated in the Candidates Tournament to qualify for the FIDE World Chess Championship 2007. He drew 3–3 with Alexey Shirov in the first round and was beaten 2½–½ in the rapidplay playoff.

==Other results==
Among his other notable results were first place at Terrassa in 1991, joint first at Dos Hermanas in 1995 (with Kamsky and Karpov), joint first at Dortmund Sparkassen Chess Meeting in 1998 (with Kramnik and Svidler) and clear first at Dos Hermanas in 1999, ahead of Kramnik, Anand, Svidler, Karpov, Veselin Topalov, Judit Polgár and others.

In more recent times, he won the fifth Howard Staunton Memorial Tournament in August 2007, achieving a score of 8½/11 (six wins, five draws), picking up the top purse of £1000. The highest-seeded player in the tournament by 45 Elo points, Adams finished a full point ahead of Dutch Grand Masters Ivan Sokolov and Loek van Wely. The tournament, one of a series held in London, commemorated the life of the nineteenth-century English chess master Howard Staunton. Prior to the start of the tournament, on 4 August, Adams married his longtime girlfriend, the actress Tara MacGowran, at a ceremony in Taunton, close to where they live.

In September 2007, Adams took part in a match between the United Kingdom and China, held in Liverpool, England. Playing alongside Adams was former World Championship challenger GM Nigel Short. This chess event was the first time in almost 15 years that the two GMs had played chess together on British soil. Overall, he scored 3½/6, conceding one loss to GM Zhang Pengxiang (ELO 2649, at the match) in round four. The UK team lost the match to China, who had also defeated a Russian chess team a few weeks before, 20–28.

Adams won the 2nd Ruy Lopez Masters tournament held in Mérida, Spain, 4–13 April 2008, scoring 5½/7 to finish a half-point ahead of Zhang Pengxiang. The tournament was an eight-player round-robin with an average rating of 2616 (FIDE category 15). In August 2008, there was a second successive victory in the Staunton Memorial. Adams finished on 8/11, ahead of Loek van Wely (7½/11) and Jan Smeets (7/11). He followed this with a share of second place at the 4th EU Individual Open Chess Championship in Liverpool, joining Viktor Láznička and Nigel Short on 7½/10 (after winner Jan Werle, 8/10).

After topping a strong open tournament in Gibraltar in 2010, he won the 2010 British Chess Championship, held in Canterbury, with an undefeated score of 9.5/11 and shared second place at the Chicago Open.

Further successes followed in 2011, with a share of first place at the Philadelphia World Open and a clear win at the British Championship in Sheffield. Adams finished outright first at the Los Angeles Metropolitan International and the European Team Championship and was awarded the gold medal for his performance on board one.

In 2012, he shared first place with Nigel Short at the Bunratty International and finished with a share of third place at the London Chess Classic, equal with Hikaru Nakamura and ahead of the world champion Viswanathan Anand and world number two ranked player Levon Aronian.

In the 2013 Alekhine Memorial tournament, held from 20 April to 1 May, Adams finished fourth, with +2−2=5. In March 2013, he came first in the 20th Bunratty Masters tournament.

At the Dortmund Sparkassen Chess Meeting in July–August 2013, Adams scored possibly the best result of his career, with a rating performance of 2925. He won the tournament with five wins and four draws (7/9), ahead of a field of 9 other grandmasters whose ratings averaged over 2705, including Fabiano Caruana (2796) and Vladimir Kramnik (2784).

In October of that year, the sixth Grand Slam Chess Masters final was held in Bilbao as a double round-robin with four players. Adams&#x27; opponents were Levon Aronian, Maxime Vachier-Lagrave and Shakhriyar Mamedyarov. Adams finished second behind Aronian, scoring +2−1=3 or 9 points according to the &quot;football scoring system&quot; traditionally used in the Grand Slam.

2014 included two notable results; a silver medal for his performance on board 1 at the Tromsø Olympiad and a share of first place at the London Chess Classic Blitz tournament (with Nakamura and Kramnik). 

In 2023, Adams played his first World Senior Chess Championship and was the winner in the Over-50 category at Terrasini in Italy.

Now in his 50&#x27;s, Adams remains one of the top English chess-players and is rated among the top 100 chess players of the world.

== Hydra match ==

In June 2005, Adams took on the chess supercomputer Hydra in a six-game match in London, England, with a prize of $10,000 for each draw and $25,000 for each win. Hydra, housed in Abu Dhabi at the time of the match, consisted of 64 PCs, each running 3.06 GHz Intel Xeon processors. Its designers said that it could, under optimal conditions, analyse up to 200 million positions a second and, in the endgame, calculate up to 40 moves ahead. Adams lost the match, drawing only the second game. The final score was Hydra 5½, Adams ½, with Adams only receiving $10,000 of the $145,000 prize fund.

== Personal life ==
Adams lives in Somerset with his wife, actress Tara MacGowran. His nickname is &quot;Mickey&quot;.

He was educated at Truro School.

<doc id="359674" wikidata="Q3045021" url="?curid=359674" title="Variance (land use)">
<text>A variance is a deviation from the set of rules a municipality applies to land use and land development, typically a zoning ordinance, building code or municipal code. The manner in which variances are employed can differ greatly depending on the municipality. A variance may also be known as a standards variance, referring to the &quot;development standards&quot; contained in code. A variance is often granted by a Board or Committee of adjustment. 

==Description==
A variance is an administrative exception to land use regulations. The use and application of variances can differ considerably throughout the great number of municipalities worldwide that regulate land use on this model. The issuance of variances may be very common, or nearly unheard-of in a given municipality. This can depend on a municipality&#x27;s regulations, built environment and development pattern, and even political climate. One city may view variances as a routine matter, while another city may see variances as highly unusual exceptions to the norm. Community attitudes and political climates can change within a city as well, affecting the manner in which variances are granted even when no changes are made to the regulations governing variances.

Typically, in the United States, the process for a variance must be made available to a landowner upon request, or the municipality may be in danger of committing a regulatory taking. The variance process has been described as &quot;a constitutional safety valve&quot; to protect the rights of landowners.

==Types==
Two broad categories of variances generally are used in the practice of local land use planning: area (or bulk) variances and use variances.

An area variance is the most common type. It can be requested by a builder or landowner when an odd configuration of the land, or sometimes the physical improvements (structures) on the land, requires a relaxation of the applicable regulations to avoid denying the landowner the same rights and use of the property enjoyed by owners of neighboring properties. A textbook example would be a house built on an oddly-shaped lot. If the odd shape of the lot makes it onerous for the landowner or builder to comply with the standard building setbacks specified in the code, a variance could be requested to allow a reduced setback. Another would be a house built on a sloping lot. If the slope of the lot makes it onerous to comply with the height limit—typically due to the way the municipality&#x27;s code requires height to be measured—then a variance could be requested for a structure of increased height because of the special conditions on the lot.

A use variance is a variance that authorizes a land use not normally permitted by the zoning ordinance. Such a variance has much in common with a special-use permit (sometimes known as a conditional use permit). Some municipalities do not offer this process, opting to handle such situations under special use permits instead. Grant of a use variance also can be similar, in effect, to a zone change. This may, in certain cases, be considered spot zoning, which is prohibited in many jurisdictions.

In either case, the variance request is justified only if special conditions exist on the lot that create a hardship making it too difficult to comply with the code&#x27;s normal requirements. Likewise, a request for a variance on a normal lot with no special conditions could judiciously be denied. The special conditions or hardship typically must arise from some physical configuration of the lot or its structures. The financial or personal situation of the applicant normally cannot be taken into consideration. Under most codes governing variances, approval of the variance must not result in a public health or safety hazard and must not grant special privilege to the property owner. In other words, when a variance is granted, any other property owner with similar site conditions should be able to obtain a similar variance; this criterion is often addressed by citing precedent.

<doc id="359676" wikidata="Q17189" url="?curid=359676" title="Pasay">
<text>Pasay, officially the City of Pasay (; ), is a highly urbanized city in the National Capital Region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 440,656 people.

Due to its location just south of Manila, Pasay quickly became an urban town during the American colonial period. It is now best known for being the site of most of Ninoy Aquino International Airport and of complexes such as Newport City and the SM Central Business Park.

==Etymology==
There are possible explanations on the origins of the city&#x27;s name:
*A legend suggested that it may have been named after Dayang-dayang Pasay, a princess of the Kingdom of Namayan and daughter of Kingdom of Maynila ruler Rajah Sulayman. She inherited half of her father&#x27;s lands, which encompasses the present-day city, and founded the present-day city.
*Another legend suggests that the city was named after Pasay, one of the sons of Tagkan, a ruler of Namayan. He inherited territories that included the area of the present-day city.
*There&#x27;s also a romantic legend where a man named Jose loudly cried out &quot;Paz-ay!&quot; at the grave of his wealthy love interest, Paz, symbolizing their forbidden love and Paz&#x27;s eventual death due to loneliness. In tribute, Paz&#x27;s parents named their hacienda &quot;Paz-ay&quot; or &quot;Pasay&quot;.
*Some historians believe that the city is named after the medicinal plant named &quot;pasaw&quot; (Pseuderanthemum reticulatum) that once grew abundantly there.
*According to American historian Austin Craig, Pasay was known as &quot;Javan Pasar&quot;, a corruption of the Arabic word &quot;bazar&quot; as the town was a marketplace.

==History==
=== Early history ===
In local folk history about the period before the arrival of Spanish colonizers, Pasay is said to have been part of Namayan (sometimes also called Sapa), a confederation of barangays which supposedly controlled territory stretching from Manila Bay to Laguna de Bay, and which, upon the arrival of the Spanish, eventually became known as Santa Ana de Sapa (modern day Santa Ana, Manila).

===Spanish colonial period===
On May 19, 1571, Miguel López de Legazpi took formal possession of the Rajahnate of Maynila and its surrounding polities in the name of the Spanish crown.

Of the many religious orders that came, it was the Augustinian Order who would figure predominantly in the evangelisation of Pasay. Having control over Pasay, they converted the area into an extensive agricultural estate known as the Hacienda de Meysapan. The parish of Pasay was governed from the old Namayan capital, since renamed Santa Ana de Sapa, which was under the jurisdiction of the Franciscans. The promise of space in Heaven prompted early native converts to donate their possessions to the Church, with folklore recounting how a baptized Pasay on her deathbed donated her vast estate to the Augustinians. Most of Pasay went to friar&#x27;s hands either via donation or by purchase; many natives were also forced to divest of their properties to cope with stringent colonial impositions. 

In 1727, the Augustinians formally took over Pasay and transferred it from Santa Ana de Sapa to Malate, particularly under the jurisdiction of the Parish of Nuestra Señora de los Remedios. In 1815, it was separated from Malate.

In 1862, notable residents of Pasay submitted a petition to handle their political and religious matters independently, proposing to rename the town &quot;Pineda&quot;, in honor of &quot;Don&quot; Cornelio Pineda, a Spanish horticulturist who was their benefactor. On December 2, 1863, with the recommendation of Manila Archbishop Gregorio Melitón Martínez Santa Cruz, Pineda was granted its own municipal charter, and this date is celebrated yearly as the city&#x27;s official foundation day.

=== Philippine revolutionary period ===

Pasay produced numerous heroes during the Philippine Revolution. The Katipunan, the organization founded by Andrés Bonifacio that spearheaded the revolution, had a chapter in Pineda organized by Pascual Villanueva, Jacinto Ignacio, and Valentin Ignacio. Several women also fought for the cause of the Katipunan including Marcela Marcelo. The execution of José Rizal, who authored the novels &quot;Noli Me Tangere&quot; and &quot;El Filibusterismo&quot; (considered seditious by the colonial government) on December 30, 1896, fanned the flames of the Revolution.

===American colonial period===
General Emilio Aguinaldo meanwhile declared the independence of the First Philippine Republic on June 12, 1898, and issued decrees providing political reorganization in the country. With this, &quot;Don&quot; Catalino became Pasay&#x27;s first &quot;Presidente municipal&quot; (equivalent to present-day Mayor). 

Pineda was made the command outpost of the &quot;Primera Zona de Manila&quot; under Gen. Mariano Noriel, but Gen. Wesley Merritt appealed that the Pineda outpost turned over to the Americans so that they could be closer to the Spanish lines. Thinking Americans were allies, Noriel left Pineda on July 29, allowing American General Greene to transfer. When Intramuros was finally captured, the Filipinos were denied entry to the walled city. Since then, tension simmered between Filipino and American troops, with both sides assigned respective zones but neither observed boundary lines. On the night of February 4, 1899, four Filipinos crossed the American line in Santa Mesa, Manila, and shots were exchanged, triggering the Philippine–American War. 

On May 19, 1899, General Noriel was given command again of Pineda. In June, Noriel together with General Ricarte almost defeated the American forces had they exploited the exhaustion of the enemy in the Battle of Las Piñas. Instead, their forces were attacked by American reinforcements and bombarded by warships. The assault forced them to abandon Pineda to occupation by American forces. 

On June 11, 1901, Pineda was incorporated into the Province of Rizal. Pascual Villanueva was appointed as municipal president. On August 4, 1901, the Pineda municipal council passed a resolution petitioning that the original name of Pasay be returned. On September 6, 1901, the Philippine Commission, acting on the request of the townsfolk, passed Act No. 227 renaming Pineda back to Pasay. Two years later, on October 12, 1903, Act No. 942 merged Pasay with the southern municipality of Malibay, expanding its territory. With a population of 8,100 in 1903, Pasay was placed under the fourth-class category together with 9 other municipalities.

Friar lands, then nationalized, were turned into subdivisions. Soon, the Pasay Real Estate Company offered friar lands as residential lots for sale or for lease to foreign investors. Postal, telegraph, and telephone lines were installed, and branches of Philippine Savings Bank were established. In 1907, a first-class road from Pasay to Camp Nichols was completed. Others were repaired including the old Avenida Mexico, now called the Taft Avenue extension. Transportation services improved. Among the first buses plying routes to Pasay were Pasay Transportation, Raymundo Transportation, Try-tran, and Halili Transit.

By 1908, Meralco tranvia (electric tram car) lines linked Pasay to Intramuros, Escolta, San Miguel, San Sebastian, and San Juan. Automobiles took to the streets, testing their maximum speed on Taft Avenue. On April 11, 1914, Cora Wong, a nurse at the Chinese General Hospital, became the first woman in the Philippines to fly as a passenger on a flight with Tom Gunn in a Curtiss seaplane off Pasay Beach.

Pasay eventually became a suburban area of Manila during the American occupation period. From a population of 6,542 residents, the town had a population of 18,697 by 1918, where 163 of them were Americans. Pasay was developed to be a residential area for prominent Filipino families and Americans, including future president Manuel L. Quezon. By the 1930s, the former rural town had become a suburb of the capital city. 

From the 1900s up to the mid-1930s, Philippine National Railway services reached Pasay thru its Cavite Line.

===Japanese occupation ===

World War II came and on December 26, 1941, General Douglas MacArthur issued a proclamation declaring Manila and its suburbs (Caloocan, Quezon City, San Juan, Mandaluyong, Makati, and Pasay) an open city. On New Year&#x27;s Day 1942, Quezon, while in Corregidor, established the City of Greater Manila, wherein Pasay, along with other nearby towns of Rizal, was merged with Manila and Quezon City. He called his secretary Jorge B. Vargas and appointed him by executive order &quot;the Mayor of Greater Manila&quot;. The mayor of Pasay was then Rufino Mateo, who was concurrently the district chief of Pasay under the City of Greater Manila, governing a town of more than 55,161. During the WWII, many Pasayeños joined in the fight against the Japanese. Jose P. Maibag, born and bred in Pasay, laid out underground networking. Carlos Mendoza, a resident of Barrio San Roque, together with 14 others, formed a mobile broadcasting station called &quot;The Voice of Juan dela Cruz.&quot; On July 11, 1942, Japanese military police captured the group. Carling Mendoza, alias Juan de la Cruz&quot; and other members of the group were brought to the old Bilibid Prison and were tortured.

Pasay had to redo the signs all over town, with Filipino was ordered to prevail over English. The national language became a core subject in the secondary school curriculum, while Japanese was taught as well at all levels of education. On October 14, 1943, Japan proclaimed the Second Philippine Republic. In the meantime, food had become so scarce that prices soared. Pasay residents began to move away from the city to the provinces outside. The Japanese occupation forces dissolved the City of Greater Manila in 1944 with the establishment of the Philippine Executive Commission to govern occupied regions in the country, thus separating the consolidated cities and towns, with Pasay returning to the province of Rizal. In the middle of February up to early March 1945, as the combined Allied forces began to converge on the way to the Manila area northwards from the south, Pasay suffered enormous damage during the month-long Battle of Manila, and many residents perished either by the Japanese or friendly fire from the combined Filipino and American forces.

On February 27, 1945, General MacArthur turned over the government to President Sergio Osmeña. One of Osmeña&#x27;s first acts was to dissolve the City of Greater Manila. He then appointed Juan Salcedo Jr., born in Pasay in 1904, as Director of Philippine Health, and then as executive officer of the Philippine Rehabilitation Administration in charge of national recovery from the devastation wrought by the Japanese occupation. Osmeña appointed Adolfo Santos as prewar vice mayor of Pasay, in place of incumbent Moises San Juan who died during the war. He also issued an executive order that would dissolve the City of Greater Manila effective August 1, 1945, thus reinstating Pasay&#x27;s pre-war status as a municipality of Rizal.

===Philippine independence===
====Cityhood====
Ignacio Santos-Diaz, a congressman from the first district of Rizal, pushed for the conversion of the town into a city and it to be named after Rizal. Republic Act No. 183 was signed into law by President Manuel Roxas on June 21, 1947, officially establishing Rizal City, named after José Rizal, with Mateo Rufino as mayor and a population of 88,738. As of June 1948, the city had revenues of . But the residents could not get themselves to call their city by its new name. After two years, eight months, and twelve days of trying, the force of habit prevailed and Eulogio Rodriguez Jr., Santos-Diaz&#x27;s successor, filed a bill returning the city to its original name. On June 7, 1950, President Elpidio Quirino, once a resident of Pasay himself, signed into law Republic Act No. 437, which changed the name of Rizal City to Pasay City.

It was also in the 1940s when houses of faith were constructed in different parts of Pasay. Among them was the Church of Our Lady of Sorrows, the Libreria de San Pablo Catholic Women&#x27;s League, Caritas, the nutrition center, and the grotto of Our Lady of Lourdes. In 1951, two parishes were established: the Parish of San Isidro Labrador and the Parish of San Rafael. By that time, the city was once more the aviation center of the country when what is now Ninoy Aquino International Airport opened its doors in 1948.

On June 14, 1955, Pasay regained its power to choose its leader. Pablo Cuneta ran against one-time Mayor Adolfo Santos and became the city&#x27;s first elected mayor. In 1959, he campaigned again and won against his former vice mayor, Ruperto Galvez. On December 30, 1965, Ferdinand Marcos was sworn in as President of the Philippines, with Fernando Lopez, a resident of Pasay, as vice president. From that moment, Imelda Romualdez Marcos, the then First Lady, became involved in national affairs. On the northern boundary of Pasay, she started filling the waterfront on Manila Bay to build the Cultural Center of the Philippines. In the later decades she would add three more architectural showpieces on reclaimed land in Pasay: the Folk Arts Theater, Manila Film Center, and the Philippine International Convention Center, and later on the PhilCite Exhibition Hall, the basis of what is now Star City. The city, though, was also being groomed as a television center for the country, for in 1958, ABS-CBN had opened its brand new television studios on what is now Roxas Boulevard, later handing it over in 1969 to the Radio Philippines Network, which used them until a 1973 fire which ruined the studios, as ABS-CBN had moved northward into Quezon City with the opening of its current studios and offices.

In 1967, Jovito Claudio won the city elections as chief executive against Pablo Cuneta. In the following year, an assassination attempt occurred in Pasay when a Bolivian surrealist painter lunged at Pope Paul VI, with a knife grazing his chest. In 1971, Cuneta was re-elected as city mayor of a growing city of almost 90 thousand people.

====Martial law era====

On December 7, 1972, almost two months after martial law was declared, an assassin tried to kill Imelda Marcos in Pasay, on live television, while Mrs. Marcos was distributing prizes to the winners of the National Beautification and Cleanliness contest. She suffered some wounds and broken nails but on the whole, she emerged unscathed from that close encounter. On the second anniversary of martial law, Marcos issued Presidential Decree No. 557, declaring every barrio in the country as barangays. Not long after the decree had been put into effect, the Metropolitan Manila Commission and the Department of Local Government instructed Pasay to create its own barangays. Mayor Cuneta, in response, ordered the creation of 487 barangays. Upon the firm suggestion of Local Government and Community Development Secretary Jose Roño, the number of barangays was cut down to two hundred, organized into several zones.

On November 7, 1975, Marcos appointed the First Lady, Imelda, as governor of Metro Manila. The federation consolidated 13 towns and 4 cities including Pasay, which was removed from Rizal province, by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 824.

Pasay was the host city of Miss Universe 1974, the first time this event had been held in the morning and in the Asia Pacific, and thus was in the international spotlight in the leadup to the pageant day. Half a decade later, the city&#x27;s first family would become famous nationally in the music scene: Sharon, the then young daughter of the mayor, broke out into the spotlight as a singer with the release of the LP &quot;DJ&#x27;s Pet&quot;.

On December 22, 1979, along with Manila, Quezon City, Caloocan, and other cities in the country, Pasay became a highly urbanized city.

In 1981, LRT Line 1 opened its Pasay stations, including its Baclaran terminal on the Parañaque border, marking a return to rapid urban rail.

====EDSA people power====

The situation changed in the city in the immediate aftermath of the People Power Revolution. Cuneta left his post to be replaced by two acting mayors, Eduardo Calixto and Norman Urbina, only to be reelected in 1988 and serving for three more terms, before handing over to Jovito Claudio in 1998. Upon the end of his term, he was the city&#x27;s longest ever city mayor. Claudio, himself replaced by the then vice mayor Wenceslao &quot;Peewee&quot; Trinidad in 2000, saw the building of the MRT Line 3&#x27;s southern terminus in the city, linked to the LRT Line 1 along Taft Avenue, and the Pasay City General Hospital and Ninoy Aquino International Airport Terminal 2 were both opened to the public. All these and other projects spurred a new era of growth in the city that continues to this day. The EDSA Entertainment Complex, located just to the city&#x27;s west along EDSA, just miles from the Baclaran, Parañaque, for many years now is very well known for adult entertainment, including prostitution.

===Contemporary===

In 2006, the SM Mall of Asia, the largest shopping center overall in the country, was opened, and the area around this mall began to grow into the city&#x27;s business center in subsequent years that followed, followed by the opening of the city&#x27;s biggest sports venue, the Mall of Asia Arena. Two years later, the NAIA Terminal 3 opened its doors in July 2008, and within two years, progress blossomed in the vicinity with the opening of yet another residential and entertainment hub, Newport City, strengthened by the construction of the NAIA Expressway in 2016.

In 2007, then-Acting Mayor Allan Panaligan carried a plan to construct a new city hall located at the Central Business Park-I Island A along Macapagal Avenue. However, the plan has not come into fruition until now.

In 2021, Mayor Imelda Calixto-Rubiano announced that the city government was planning to build a new hospital facility in the city. An appropriate location for the new hospital is still to be determined given the city&#x27;s geographically small area and dense population.

==Geography==

<text>Philip Hampson Knight (born February 24, 1938) is an American billionaire businessman and philanthropist who is the co-founder and chairman &quot;emeritus&quot; of Nike, Inc., a global sports equipment and apparel company. He was previously its chairman and CEO. As of January 2025, &quot;Forbes&quot; estimated his net worth at $33 billion. He is also the owner of the stop motion film production company Laika. Knight is a graduate of the University of Oregon and the Stanford Graduate School of Business. He was part of the track and field club under coach Bill Bowerman at the University of Oregon with whom he would later co-found Nike.

Knight has donated hundreds of millions of dollars to each of his &quot;alma maters&quot;, as well as Oregon Health &amp; Science University. He has donated over $2 billion to these three institutions.

==Early life and education==

Phil Hampson Knight was born on February 24, 1938, in Portland, Oregon, to Bill Knight, a lawyer turned newspaper publisher, and his wife, Lota Cloy (née Hatfield) Knight. He grew up in the Portland neighborhood of Eastmoreland, and attended Cleveland High School. According to one source, &quot;When his father refused to give him a summer job at his newspaper [the now defunct &quot;Oregon Journal&quot;], believing that his son should find work on his own,&quot; Knight &quot;went to the rival &quot;Oregonian&quot;, where he worked the morning shift tabulating sports scores and every morning ran home the full .&quot;

Knight continued his education at the University of Oregon in Eugene, where he ran for the famed Oregon track and field program, was a sports reporter for the &quot;Oregon Daily Emerald&quot; and was a member of Phi Gamma Delta fraternity. Knight earned a business degree (B.B.A.) in 1959 in just three years. That same year, Knight also received his Army Reserve Commission and was a &quot;Distinguished Military Graduate&quot;.

As a middle-distance runner at Oregon, his personal best was in 4 minutes, 13 seconds, and he won varsity letters for his track performances in 1957, 1958, and 1959. In 1977, together with Bowerman and Geoff Hollister, Knight founded an American running team called Athletics West.

==Career==
===Early career===
Before Blue Ribbon Sports—later Nike—flourished, Knight worked as a Certified Public Accountant, first with Coopers &amp; Lybrand, and then Price Waterhouse. Knight then became an accounting professor at Portland State University.

===Nike Inc.===
Immediately after graduating from the University of Oregon, Knight enlisted in the Army and served one year on active duty and seven years in the Army Reserve. He next enrolled at Stanford Graduate School of Business, where, for his small business class, Knight produced a paper, &quot;Can Japanese Sports Shoes Do to German Sports Shoes What Japanese Cameras Did to German Cameras?&quot;, that essentially foretold his eventual foray into selling running shoes. His ambition was to import high-quality and low-cost running shoes from Japan into the American market. He graduated with a master&#x27;s degree in business administration from Stanford in 1962.

Knight set out on a trip around the world after graduation, during which he made a stop in Kobe, Japan, in November 1962. It was there that he discovered Tiger brand running shoes, manufactured in Kobe by the Onitsuka Co., now known as Asics. Impressed by the quality and low cost of the shoes, Knight called Mr. Onitsuka, who agreed to meet with him. By the end of the meeting, Knight had secured Tiger distribution rights for the western United States.

The first Tiger samples would take more than a year to be shipped to Knight; during that time he found a job as an accountant in Portland. When Knight finally received the shoe samples, he mailed two pairs to Bowerman at the University of Oregon, hoping to gain both a sale and an influential endorsement. To Knight&#x27;s surprise, Bowerman not only ordered the Tiger shoes, but also offered to become a partner with Knight and provide product design ideas. The two men agreed to a partnership by handshake on January 25, 1964, the birth date of Blue Ribbon Sports, the company that would later become Nike.

Knight&#x27;s first sales, were made out of a now storied green Plymouth Valiant automobile at track meets across the Pacific Northwest. By 1969, these early sales allowed Knight to leave his accountant job and work full-time for Blue Ribbon Sports.

Jeff Johnson, Nike&#x27;s first employee, suggested calling the firm &quot;Nike,&quot; named after the Greek winged goddess of victory, and Blue Ribbon Sports was subsequently renamed Nike in 1971.

Nike&#x27;s &quot;swoosh&quot; logo, now considered one of the most valuable logos in the world, was commissioned for $35 from graphic design student Carolyn Davidson in 1971. According to Nike&#x27;s website, Knight said at the time: &quot;I don&#x27;t love it, but it will grow on me.&quot; In September 1983, Davidson was given an undisclosed amount of Nike stock for her contribution to the company&#x27;s brand. On the &quot;Oprah&quot; television program in April 2011, Knight said he gave Davidson &quot;a few hundred shares&quot; when the company went public.

At Nike, Knight developed personal relationships with some of the world&#x27;s most recognizable athletes, including Michael Jordan and Tiger Woods.

===Vinton Studios becomes Laika===
Following mainstream success in the late 1990s, Will Vinton Studios animation company sought external investors due to rapid growth. Knight assumed a 15 percent stake in the company in 1998, and his son Travis—who had graduated from Portland State following an unsuccessful attempt at a rap music career—went to work at the studio as an animator.

Citing mismanagement, Knight eventually purchased Will Vinton Studios and assumed control of the company&#x27;s board with the cooperation of Nike executives. In late 2003, Knight appointed his son to the board and, after Vinton had stepped down—prior to leaving the company with a severance package—Knight rebranded the company Laika. He then invested $180 million into Laika, and the studio released its first feature film, &quot;Coraline&quot;, in stop motion, in 2009. &quot;Coraline&quot; was a financial success and Travis Knight was then promoted into the roles of Laika CEO and president.

===Death of Matthew Knight===
In May 2004, two years after Knight bought Vinton, his son Matthew, aged 34 years, traveled to El Salvador to film a fund-raising video for Christian Children of the World, a Portland nonprofit organization. However, while scuba diving with his colleagues Vincenzo Iannuzzelli and Robert McDonell in Lake Ilopango, near San Salvador, he died from a heart attack underwater due to an undetected congenital heart defect. Knight and Travis traveled to El Salvador to return Matthew&#x27;s body to the US. Laika Studio&#x27;s 2005 short film &quot;Moongirl&quot; was dedicated to Matthew&#x27;s memory.

Knight resigned as Nike CEO on November 18, 2004, several months after Matthew&#x27;s funeral but retained the position of chairman of the board. Knight&#x27;s replacement was William Perez, former CEO of S.C. Johnson &amp; Son, Inc., who was eventually replaced by Mark Parker in 2006.

In 2011, the Matthew Knight Arena at the University of Oregon was named in his honor.

===Post-Nike CEO role===
During the 2009–2010 period, Knight was the largest single contributor to the campaign to defeat Oregon Ballot Measures 66 and 67, which, once passed, increased income tax on some corporations and high-income individuals.

In June 2015, Knight and Nike announced that he would step down as the company&#x27;s chairman, with president and CEO Mark Parker to succeed him. Knight&#x27;s retirement from the Nike board took effect at the end of June 2016. In September 2017, Knight decided to come out of retirement to put black back in the UNC jerseys for the Phil Knight Classic in Portland, Oregon.

===Memoir===
Knight&#x27;s memoir, &quot;Shoe Dog&quot;, was released on April 26, 2016, by Simon &amp; Schuster, was rated fifth on &quot;The New York Times&quot; Best Seller list for business books in July 2018, and details the building of the Nike brand, from importing Japanese shoes to being part of a federal investigation.

==Philanthropy==
As of July 2021, Knight has a net worth of $60.8 billion. In 1990, Knight founded the Philip H. Knight Charitable Foundation Trust. As of 2016, according to &quot;Portland Business Journal&quot;, &quot;Knight is the most generous philanthropist in Oregon history. His lifetime gifts now approach $2 billion.&quot; In 2023, Knight was America&#x27;s second largest donor with $1.2 billion in giving.

===Stanford University===
In 2006, Knight donated US$105 million to the Stanford Graduate School of Business, which, at the time, was the largest ever individual donation to a U.S. business school. The campus was named &quot;The Knight Management Center,&quot; in honor of Knight&#x27;s philanthropic service to the school.

In 2016, it was announced that Knight contributed $400 million to start the Knight-Hennessy Scholars graduate-level education program inspired by the Rhodes Scholarship. Graduates are charged to tackle global challenges, such as climate change and poverty. The first class of 51 scholars from 21 countries was scheduled to arrive at Stanford in the fall of 2018.

In May 2022, it was announced that Phil and Penny Knight gifted Stanford $75 million to establish the Phil and Penny Knight Initiative for Brain Resilience. The initiative will be housed at Stanford&#x27;s Wu Tsai Neurosciences Institute and is set to study the cognitive decline and degenerative brain diseases such as Parkinson&#x27;s and Alzheimer&#x27;s.

===University of Oregon===

As of 2023, Knight has donated over one billion dollars to the University of Oregon. It is believed that Knight made his first major contribution in the late 1980s. By 2000 Knight had already contributed over $50 million to UO. He was UO&#x27;s 2018–19 honorary degree recipient.

====UO Academics====
Major gifts include funds supporting the renovation of the Knight Library and construction of the Knight Law Center. Contrary to press reports, which claim that Knight financed the whole library renovation project, Knight only financed a portion of the library&#x27;s renovation. Knight also established endowed chairs across the campus. In the fall of 2016, it was announced that Knight will donate $500 million to UO for a new three-building laboratory and research science complex. This donation was part of a series of large higher-education gifts.

====UO Athletic Department (Oregon Ducks)====
Knight contributed towards the Moshofsky Center, which opened in 1998.
In August 2007, Knight announced that he and his wife would be donating US$100 million to found the UO Athletics Legacy Fund to help support all athletic programs at the university. In response, athletic director Pat Kilkenny said: &quot;This extraordinary gift will set Oregon athletics on a course toward certain self sufficiency and create the flexibility and financial capacity for the university to move forward with the new athletic arena.&quot; At the time, the donation was the largest philanthropic gift in the history of the university.

The 2010 construction of the UO basketball team&#x27;s Matthew Knight Arena was the result of a partnership between Knight and former Oregon athletic director Pat Kilkenny. Although Knight didn&#x27;t pay for the project directly, he established a $100 million &quot;Athletic Legacy Fund.&quot; The fund supports the athletic department. Named after Knight&#x27;s deceased son, the venue replaced the McArthur Court building and cost over US$200 million to build. The facility was built using bonds backed by the State of Oregon.

Knight was responsible for financing the UO&#x27;s US$68 million 145,000 square-foot gridiron football facility that was officially opened in late July 2013. Knight&#x27;s personal locker in the team&#x27;s locker room displays the title &quot;Uncle Phil&quot;, and other features include a gym with Brazilian hardwood floors, Apple iPhone chargers in each of the players&#x27; lockers, various auditoriums and meeting rooms, a games room for the players that includes flat-screen televisions and foosball machines, and a cafeteria.

In November 2015, it was announced that Knight and his wife would be donating $19.2 million towards a new sports complex project at the University of Oregon. The plans for the 29,000 square foot complex was announced in September. Construction started in January 2016 and ended in September 2016. The sports complex was named the Marcus Mariota Sports Performance Center and includes motion capture systems, neurocognitive assessment tools, 40-yard dash track, and steam machines made by Nike to help athletes break into their footwear more quickly.

In 2021, Knight helped to fund the renovation of Hayward Field, a track and field stadium at the university. The project was estimated to cost $270 million, although Knight&#x27;s total contribution remained private.

====Controversy====
Knight&#x27;s contributions to the athletic department at UO have also led to controversy. In April 2000, student leaders began organizing an anti-sweatshop and fair labor practices campaign, and called for Dave Frohnmayer, president of the school, to support the Workers Rights Consortium (WRC). On April 4, 2000, students began a sit-in at Johnson Hall, the UO&#x27;s administrative center. In early April, an open meeting of students further demanded that the organization Fair Labor Association (FLA) would receive no consideration from the university, as it was perceived as a group founded, funded and backed by Nike and other corporations, and had also been criticized by worker rights advocates as an exercise in dishonest public relations.

University President Dave Frohnmayer subsequently signed a one-year contract with the WRC; Knight then withdrew a US$30 million commitment toward the Autzen Stadium expansion project and offered no further donations to the university. In a public statement, Knight criticized the WRC for having unrealistic provisions and called it misguided, while praising the FLA for being &quot;balanced&quot; in its approach. In the face of ongoing conflict with students, Frohnmayer sided with Knight&#x27;s assertion that the WRC was providing unbalanced representation, and in October 2000 the &quot;Eugene Weekly&quot; reported Frohnmayer stating that:
On February 16, 2001, the Oregon University System enacted a mandate that all institutions within the system choose business partners from a politically neutral standpoint, barring all universities in Oregon from joining either the WRC or the FLA. Following the dissolved relationship between the university and the WRC, Knight reinstated the donation and increased the amount to over US$50 million.

Also controversial was Knight&#x27;s success in lobbying for former insurance executive Pat Kilkenny to be named as athletic director at the university. Kilkenny had neither a college degree nor any prior experience in athletics administration. He attended but did not graduate from UO, as he left the school with several credit hours still owing. Prior to his appointment at UO, Kilkenny had been the chairman and chief executive officer of the San Diego–based Arrowhead General Insurance Agency, and grew the business into a nationwide organization, with written premiums of nearly US$1 billion when he sold the company in 2006.

===Other projects===
In October 2008, Knight and his wife pledged US$100 million to the OHSU Cancer Institute, the largest gift in the history of Oregon Health &amp; Science University. In recognition, the university renamed the organization the &quot;OHSU Knight Cancer Institute.&quot;

In October 2010, Knight donated several million dollars to the Catlin Gabel School to establish a scholarship for incoming freshmen students.

On May 18, 2012, Knight contributed US$65,000 to a higher education Political Action Committee (PAC) formed by Columbia Sportswear CEO Tim Boyle. According to Boyle, the PAC will help facilitate an increase in the autonomy of schools in the Oregon University System.

On September 27, 2013, Knight announced to the audience at the OHSU Knight Cancer Institute&#x27;s biennial gala, when he announced his intention to donate US$500 million for research if OHSU could match it over the subsequent two years. On June 25, 2015, OHSU met that $500 million goal, and Knight announced his upcoming $500 million donation, to bring the total to $1 billion raised.

Knight and wife Penny also donated to the Marylhurst Knights Opportunity Scholarship Program at Marylhurst University, a private Roman Catholic university in Marylhurst, Oregon; as a result, the university named a lawn on their campus &quot;Knight&#x27;s Green&quot; in the family&#x27;s honor.

In December 2016, Knight disclosed that he had donated $112 million in Nike stock to charity.

==Accolades==
In 2000, Knight was inducted into the Oregon Sports Hall of Fame for his Special Contribution to Sports in Oregon. At the time of his induction, he had contributed approximately US$230 million to UO, the majority of which was for athletics.

On February 24, 2012, Knight was announced as a 2012 inductee of the Naismith Memorial Basketball Hall of Fame, as a contributor. The Hall recognized him as the driving force behind Nike&#x27;s huge financial support of U.S. basketball and its players. Knight was formally inducted on September 7, 2012.

In 1989, Knight received the Golden Plate Award of the American Academy of Achievement. For his &quot;contributions to business, corporate and philanthropic leadership&quot;, Knight was elected to the 2015 American Academy of Arts and Sciences membership class.

In 2020, the university polled alumni and fans on social media, asking them which four UO alumni they would place on a notional Mount Rushmore for the university. Knight was one of the four final choices, along with Ducks track legend Steve Prefontaine; current NFL player Marcus Mariota, the 2014 Heisman Trophy winner; and Sabrina Ionescu, who had just completed an epic college basketball career for the Ducks.

In 2024, Knight received the President&#x27;s award of the World Athletics Awards.

==Personal life==
Knight met his wife, Penelope &quot;Penny&quot; Parks, while he was working at Portland State University and Penny was a student. They were married on September 13, 1968. They own a home in La Quinta, California.

Knight&#x27;s son, Matthew, died in a scuba diving accident in El Salvador in 2004. Another son of Knight&#x27;s, Travis Knight, runs the Laika animation studio. Phil Knight serves as chairman.

Knight lists Nike&#x27;s headquarters in Beaverton, Oregon, as his home address on government records. He resides in a rural area outside Hillsboro, Oregon and owns a personal flight hangar along with two private jets at the Hillsboro Airport.

Ben Affleck and Matt Damon produced a film called &quot;Air&quot; about Nike&#x27;s signing of Michael Jordan and ultimately the Air Jordan brand. Affleck plays Knight in the film.

==Politics==
Knight is a registered Republican and a frequent contributor to Republican political candidates in Oregon. In 2010, he donated $400,000 to Chris Dudley, the then Republican nominee for Governor of Oregon.

Knight occasionally supports Democrats, however; in 1986 he financed Neil Goldschmidt&#x27;s successful campaign, and in 2014, he donated $250,000 to the re-election campaign of Democrat John Kitzhaber.

He donated $3.5 million to Republican Knute Buehler during the 2018 Oregon gubernatorial election. Regarding this donation, Knight criticized the unfunded Oregon Public Employees Retirement System and the general fiscal state of Oregon, implying Democratic governor Kate Brown was at fault.

Knight was once again a major donor during the 2022 Oregon gubernatorial election. He gave $3.75 million to independent candidate Betsy Johnson until September 2022. After Johnson&#x27;s support declined in the polls, he switched to backing Republican Christine Drazan, writing her a $1 million check on October 6 of that year. He made a second donation to the Drazan campaign later in October. Also in 2022, Knight donated $2 million to a political action committee seeking to elect Republican state legislators in Oregon. In April 2023, Knight contributed $2 million more to the same conservative PAC. 

While Knight is generally reluctant to give interviews, he spoke with the &quot;New York Times&quot; in October 2022 regarding his support for Republican candidates. He argued Oregon&#x27;s government had drifted too far to the left and described himself as &quot;more conservative than Nike,&quot; responding to criticism of him backing an anti-abortion candidate which apparently contrasted with the company&#x27;s image of supporting progressive social justice causes. Nike itself donated $75,000 to Drazan and Johnson&#x27;s Democratic opponent, Tina Kotek, the eventual winner of the election.

<doc id="359681" wikidata="Q142489" url="?curid=359681" title="Gigabit interface converter">
<text>Gigabit interface converter (GBIC) is a standard for transceivers. First defined in 1995, it was used with Gigabit Ethernet and Fibre Channel. By standardizing on a hot swappable electrical interface, a single gigabit port can support a wide range of physical media, from copper to long-wave single-mode optical fiber, at lengths of hundreds of kilometers.

The small form-factor pluggable transceiver (SFP), also known as mini-GBIC, succeeds GBIC. Announced in 2001, it obsoleted GBIC.

==Appeal==

Flexibility is the benefit of hot-swappable transceivers like the GBIC standard as opposed to fixed physical interface configurations. Where optical technologies are mixed, an administrator can just-in-time purchase GBICs of the specific type for each link. This flexibility lowers fixed costs. However, if one port type such as copper predominates, a switch with built-in ports is cheaper and space efficient.

==Standards==
The GBIC standard is openly defined by the Small Form Factor Committee in document number 8053i. The first publication was in November 1995. A few corrections and additions were made through September 2000. Robert Snively of Brocade Communications was the technical editor. The original contributors were AMP Incorporated, Compaq Computers, Sun Microsystems, and Vixel Corporation.

<doc id="359684" wikidata="Q746007" url="?curid=359684" title="Cumulant">
<text>In probability theory and statistics, the cumulants of a probability distribution are a set of quantities that provide an alternative to the &quot;moments&quot; of the distribution. Any two probability distributions whose moments are identical will have identical cumulants as well, and vice versa.
The first cumulant is the mean, the second cumulant is the variance, and the third cumulant is the same as the third central moment. But fourth and higher-order cumulants are not equal to central moments. In some cases theoretical treatments of problems in terms of cumulants are simpler than those using moments. In particular, when two or more random variables are statistically independent, the th-order cumulant of their sum is equal to the sum of their th-order cumulants. As well, the third and higher-order cumulants of a normal distribution are zero, and it is the only distribution with this property.

Just as for moments, where &quot;joint moments&quot; are used for collections of random variables, it is possible to define &quot;joint cumulants&quot;.

== Definition ==
The cumulants of a random variable are defined using the cumulant-generating function , which is the natural logarithm of the moment-generating function:
formula_1

The cumulants are obtained from a power series expansion of the cumulant generating function:
formula_2

This expansion is a Maclaurin series, so the th cumulant can be obtained by differentiating the above expansion times and evaluating the result at zero:
formula_3

If the moment-generating function does not exist, the cumulants can be defined in terms of the relationship between cumulants and moments discussed later.

=== Alternative definition of the cumulant generating function ===
Some writers prefer to define the cumulant-generating function as the natural logarithm of the characteristic function, which is sometimes also called the &quot;second&quot; characteristic function,
formula_4

An advantage of —in some sense the function evaluated for purely imaginary arguments—is that is well defined for all real values of even when is not well defined for all real values of , such as can occur when there is &quot;too much&quot; probability that has a large magnitude. Although the function will be well defined, it will nonetheless mimic in terms of the length of its Maclaurin series, which may not extend beyond (or, rarely, even to) linear order in the argument , and in particular the number of cumulants that are well defined will not change. Nevertheless, even when does not have a long Maclaurin series, it can be used directly in analyzing and, particularly, adding random variables. Both the Cauchy distribution (also called the Lorentzian) and more generally, stable distributions (related to the Lévy distribution) are examples of distributions for which the power-series expansions of the generating functions have only finitely many well-defined terms.

== Some basic properties ==

The formula_5th cumulant formula_6 of (the distribution of) a random variable formula_7 enjoys the following properties:
* If formula_8 and formula_9 is constant (i.e. not random) then formula_10 i.e. the cumulant is translation invariant. (If formula_11 then we have formula_12
* If formula_9 is constant (i.e. not random) then formula_14 i.e. the formula_5th cumulant is homogeneous of degree formula_5.
* If random variables formula_17 are independent then formula_18 That is, the cumulant is cumulative — hence the name.

The cumulative property follows quickly by considering the cumulant-generating function:
formula_19
so that each cumulant of a sum of independent random variables is the sum of the corresponding cumulants of the addends. That is, when the addends are statistically independent, the mean of the sum is the sum of the means, the variance of the sum is the sum of the variances, the third cumulant (which happens to be the third central moment) of the sum is the sum of the third cumulants, and so on for each order of cumulant.

A distribution with given cumulants can be approximated through an Edgeworth series.

=== First several cumulants as functions of the moments ===

All of the higher cumulants are polynomial functions of the central moments, with integer coefficients, but only in degrees 2 and 3 are the cumulants actually central moments.
* formula_20mean
* formula_21the variance, or second central moment.
* formula_22the third central moment.
* formula_23the fourth central moment minus three times the square of the second central moment. Thus this is the first case in which cumulants are not simply moments or central moments. The central moments of degree more than 3 lack the cumulative property.
* formula_24

== Cumulants of some discrete probability distributions ==
* The constant random variables . The cumulant generating function is . The first cumulant is and the other cumulants are zero, .
* The Bernoulli distributions, (number of successes in one trial with probability of success). The cumulant generating function is . The first cumulants are and . The cumulants satisfy a recursion formula formula_25
* The geometric distributions, (number of failures before one success with probability of success on each trial). The cumulant generating function is . The first cumulants are , and . Substituting gives and .
* The Poisson distributions. The cumulant generating function is . All cumulants are equal to the parameter: .
* The binomial distributions, (number of successes in independent trials with probability of success on each trial). The special case is a Bernoulli distribution. Every cumulant is just times the corresponding cumulant of the corresponding Bernoulli distribution. The cumulant generating function is . The first cumulants are and . Substituting gives and . The limiting case is a Poisson distribution.
* The negative binomial distributions, (number of failures before successes with probability of success on each trial). The special case is a geometric distribution. Every cumulant is just times the corresponding cumulant of the corresponding geometric distribution. The derivative of the cumulant generating function is . The first cumulants are , and . Substituting gives and . Comparing these formulas to those of the binomial distributions explains the name &#x27;negative binomial distribution&#x27;. The limiting case is a Poisson distribution.

Introducing the variance-to-mean ratio
formula_26
the above probability distributions get a unified formula for the derivative of the cumulant generating function:
formula_27

The second derivative is
formula_28
confirming that the first cumulant is and the second cumulant is .

The constant random variables have .

The binomial distributions have so that .

The Poisson distributions have .

The negative binomial distributions have so that .

Note the analogy to the classification of conic sections by eccentricity: circles , ellipses , parabolas , hyperbolas .

== Cumulants of some continuous probability distributions ==
* For the normal distribution with expected value and variance , the cumulant generating function is . The first and second derivatives of the cumulant generating function are and . The cumulants are , , and . The special case is a constant random variable .
* The cumulants of the uniform distribution on the interval are , where is the th Bernoulli number.
* The cumulants of the exponential distribution with rate parameter are .

== Some properties of the cumulant generating function ==
The cumulant generating function , if it exists, is infinitely differentiable and convex, and passes through the origin. Its first derivative ranges monotonically in the open interval from the infimum to the supremum of the support of the probability distribution, and its second derivative is strictly positive everywhere it is defined, except for the degenerate distribution of a single point mass. The cumulant-generating function exists if and only if the tails of the distribution are majorized by an exponential decay, that is, (&quot;see Big O notation&quot;)
formula_29
where formula_30 is the cumulative distribution function. The cumulant-generating function will have vertical asymptote(s) at the negative supremum of such , if such a supremum exists, and at the supremum of such , if such a supremum exists, otherwise it will be defined for all real numbers.

If the support of a random variable has finite upper or lower bounds, then its cumulant-generating function , if it exists, approaches asymptote(s) whose slope is equal to the supremum or infimum of the support,
formula_31
respectively, lying above both these lines everywhere. (The integrals
formula_32
yield the -intercepts of these asymptotes, since .)

For a shift of the distribution by , formula_33 For a degenerate point mass at , the cumulant generating function is the straight line formula_34, and more generally, formula_35 if and only if and are independent and their cumulant generating functions exist; (subindependence and the existence of second moments sufficing to imply independence.)

The natural exponential family of a distribution may be realized by shifting or translating , and adjusting it vertically so that it always passes through the origin: if is the pdf with cumulant generating function formula_36 and formula_37 is its natural exponential family, then formula_38 and formula_39

If is finite for a range then if then is analytic and infinitely differentiable for . Moreover for real and is strictly convex, and is strictly increasing. 

== Further properties of cumulants ==

=== A negative result ===
Given the results for the cumulants of the normal distribution, it might be hoped to find families of distributions for which
 for some , with the lower-order cumulants (orders 3 to ) being non-zero. There are no such distributions. The underlying result here is that the cumulant generating function cannot be a finite-order polynomial of degree greater than 2.

=== Cumulants and moments ===
The moment generating function is given by:
formula_40

So the cumulant generating function is the logarithm of the moment generating function
formula_41

The first cumulant is the expected value; the second and third cumulants are respectively the second and third central moments (the second central moment is the variance); but the higher cumulants are neither moments nor central moments, but rather more complicated polynomial functions of the moments.

The moments can be recovered in terms of cumulants by evaluating the th derivative of formula_42 at ,
formula_43

Likewise, the cumulants can be recovered in terms of moments by evaluating the th derivative of formula_44 at ,
formula_45

The explicit expression for the th moment in terms of the first cumulants, and vice versa, can be obtained by using Faà di Bruno&#x27;s formula for higher derivatives of composite functions. In general, we have
formula_46
formula_47
where formula_48 are incomplete (or partial) Bell polynomials.

In the like manner, if the mean is given by formula_49, the central moment generating function is given by
formula_50
and the th central moment is obtained in terms of cumulants as
formula_51

Also, for , the th cumulant in terms of the central moments is
formula_52
The th moment is an th-degree polynomial in the first cumulants. The first few expressions are:
formula_53

The &quot;prime&quot; distinguishes the moments from the central moments . To express the &quot;central&quot; moments as functions of the cumulants, just drop from these polynomials all terms in which appears as a factor:
formula_54

Similarly, the th cumulant is an th-degree polynomial in the first non-central moments. The first few expressions are:
formula_55

In general, the cumulant is the determinant of a matrix:
formula_56

To express the cumulants for as functions of the central moments, drop from these polynomials all terms in which μ&#x27;1 appears as a factor:
formula_57
formula_58
formula_59
formula_60
formula_61

The cumulants can be related to the moments by differentiating the relationship with respect to , giving , which conveniently contains no exponentials or logarithms. Equating the coefficient of on the left and right sides and using gives the following formulas for :
formula_62
These allow either formula_63 or formula_64 to be computed from the other using knowledge of the lower-order cumulants and moments. The corresponding formulas for the central moments formula_65 for formula_66 are formed from these formulas by setting formula_67 and replacing each formula_64 with formula_65 for formula_66:
formula_71

=== Cumulants and set-partitions ===
These polynomials have a remarkable combinatorial interpretation: the coefficients count certain partitions of sets. A general form of these polynomials is
formula_72
where
* runs through the list of all partitions of a set of size ;
* &quot;&quot; means is one of the &quot;blocks&quot; into which the set is partitioned; and
* is the size of the set .

Thus each monomial is a constant times a product of cumulants in which the sum of the indices is (e.g., in the term , the sum of the indices is 3 + 2 + 2 + 1 = 8; this appears in the polynomial that expresses the 8th moment as a function of the first eight cumulants). A partition of the integer corresponds to each term. The &quot;coefficient&quot; in each term is the number of partitions of a set of members that collapse to that partition of the integer when the members of the set become indistinguishable.

=== Cumulants and combinatorics ===
Further connection between cumulants and combinatorics can be found in the work of Gian-Carlo Rota, where links to invariant theory, symmetric functions, and binomial sequences are studied via umbral calculus.

== Joint cumulants==
The joint cumulant of several random variables is defined as the coefficient in the Maclaurin series of the multivariate cumulant generating function, see Section 3.1 in,
formula_73
Note that
formula_74
and, in particular
formula_75
As with a single variable, the generating function and cumulant can instead be defined via 
formula_76
in which case
formula_77
and
formula_78

=== Repeated random variables and relation between the coefficients &quot;κ&quot;&quot;k&quot;1, ..., &quot;k&quot;&quot;n&quot; ===
Observe that formula_79 can also be written as
formula_80
from which we conclude that
formula_81
For example
formula_82
and
formula_83
In particular, the last equality shows that the cumulants of a single random variable are the joint cumulants of multiple copies of that random variable.

=== Relation with mixed moments ===
The joint cumulant of random variables can be expressed as an alternate sum of products of their mixed moments, see Equation (3.2.7) in, 
formula_84
where  runs through the list of all partitions of ; where  runs through the list of all blocks of the partition ; and where  is the number of parts in the partition.

For example,
formula_85
is the expected value of formula_86,
formula_87
is the covariance of formula_86 and formula_89, and
formula_90

For zero-mean random variables formula_91, any mixed moment of the form formula_92 vanishes if formula_93 is a partition of formula_94 which contains a singleton formula_95.
Hence, the expression of their joint cumulant in terms of mixed moments simplifies.
For example, if X,Y,Z,W are zero mean random variables, we have 
formula_96
formula_97

More generally, any coefficient of the Maclaurin series can also be expressed in terms of mixed moments, although there are no concise formulae.
Indeed, as noted above, one can write it as a joint cumulant by repeating random variables appropriately, and then apply the above formula to express it in terms of mixed moments. For example
formula_98

If some of the random variables are independent of all of the others, then any cumulant involving two (or more) independent random variables is zero.

The combinatorial meaning of the expression of mixed moments in terms of cumulants is easier to understand than that of cumulants in terms of mixed moments, see Equation (3.2.6) in:
formula_99

For example:
formula_100

=== Further properties ===
Another important property of joint cumulants is multilinearity:
formula_101

Just as the second cumulant is the variance, the joint cumulant of just two random variables is the covariance. The familiar identity
formula_102
generalizes to cumulants:
formula_103

=== Conditional cumulants and the law of total cumulance ===

The law of total expectation and the law of total variance generalize naturally to conditional cumulants. The case , expressed in the language of (central) moments rather than that of cumulants, says
formula_104

In general,
formula_105
where
* the sum is over all partitions  of the set of indices, and
* 1, ..., b are all of the &quot;blocks&quot; of the partition ; the expression indicates that the joint cumulant of the random variables whose indices are in that block of the partition.

=== Conditional cumulants and the conditional expectation ===
For certain settings, a derivative identity can be established between the conditional cumulant and the conditional expectation. For example, suppose that where is standard normal independent of , then for any it holds that 
formula_106
The results can also be extended to the exponential family.

== Relation to statistical physics ==
In statistical physics many extensive quantities – that is quantities that are proportional to the volume or size of a given system – are related to cumulants of random variables. The deep connection is that in a large system an extensive quantity like the energy or number of particles can be thought of as the sum of (say) the energy associated with a number of nearly independent regions. The fact that the cumulants of these nearly independent random variables will (nearly) add make it reasonable that extensive quantities should be expected to be related to cumulants.

A system in equilibrium with a thermal bath at temperature have a fluctuating internal energy , which can be considered a random variable drawn from a distribution formula_107. The partition function of the system is
formula_108
where  =  and is the Boltzmann constant and the notation formula_109 has been used rather than formula_110 for the expectation value to avoid confusion with the energy, . Hence the first and second cumulant for the energy give the average energy and heat capacity.
formula_111

The Helmholtz free energy expressed in terms of
formula_112
further connects thermodynamic quantities with cumulant generating function for the energy. Thermodynamics properties that are derivatives of the free energy, such as its internal energy, entropy, and specific heat capacity, all can be readily expressed in terms of these cumulants. Other free energy can be a function of other variables such as the magnetic field or chemical potential formula_49, e.g.
formula_114
where is the number of particles and formula_115 is the grand potential. Again the close relationship between the definition of the free energy and the cumulant generating function implies that various derivatives of this free energy can be written in terms of joint cumulants of and .

== History ==
The history of cumulants is discussed by Anders Hald.

Cumulants were first introduced by Thorvald N. Thiele, in 1889, who called them &quot;semi-invariants&quot;. They were first called &quot;cumulants&quot; in a 1932 paper by Ronald Fisher and John Wishart. Fisher was publicly reminded of Thiele&#x27;s work by Neyman, who also notes previous published citations of Thiele brought to Fisher&#x27;s attention. Stephen Stigler has said that the name &quot;cumulant&quot; was suggested to Fisher in a letter from Harold Hotelling. In a paper published in 1929, Fisher had called them &quot;cumulative moment functions&quot;. 

The partition function in statistical physics was introduced by Josiah Willard Gibbs in 1901. The free energy is often called Gibbs free energy. In statistical mechanics, cumulants are also known as Ursell functions relating to a publication in 1927.

== Cumulants in generalized settings ==

=== Formal cumulants ===
More generally, the cumulants of a sequence , not necessarily the moments of any probability distribution, are, by definition,
formula_116
where the values of for are found formally, i.e., by algebra alone, in disregard of questions of whether any series converges. All of the difficulties of the &quot;problem of cumulants&quot; are absent when one works formally. The simplest example is that the second cumulant of a probability distribution must always be nonnegative, and is zero only if all of the higher cumulants are zero. Formal cumulants are subject to no such constraints.

=== Bell numbers ===
In combinatorics, the th Bell number is the number of partitions of a set of size . All of the cumulants of the sequence of Bell numbers are equal to 1. The Bell numbers are the moments of the Poisson distribution with expected value 1.

=== Cumulants of a polynomial sequence of binomial type ===
For any sequence of scalars in a field of characteristic zero, being considered formal cumulants, there is a corresponding sequence of formal moments, given by the polynomials above. For those polynomials, construct a polynomial sequence in the following way. Out of the polynomial
formula_117
make a new polynomial in these plus one additional variable :
formula_118
and then generalize the pattern. The pattern is that the numbers of blocks in the aforementioned partitions are the exponents on . Each coefficient is a polynomial in the cumulants; these are the Bell polynomials, named after Eric Temple Bell.

This sequence of polynomials is of binomial type. In fact, no other sequences of binomial type exist; every polynomial sequence of binomial type is completely determined by its sequence of formal cumulants.

=== Free cumulants ===
In the above moment-cumulant formula\
formula_119
for joint cumulants, one sums over &quot;all&quot; partitions of the set . If instead, one sums only over the noncrossing partitions, then, by solving these formulae for the formula_120 in terms of the moments, one gets free cumulants rather than conventional cumulants treated above. These free cumulants were introduced by Roland Speicher and play a central role in free probability theory. In that theory, rather than considering independence of random variables, defined in terms of tensor products of algebras of random variables, one considers instead free independence of random variables, defined in terms of free products of algebras.

The ordinary cumulants of degree higher than 2 of the normal distribution are zero. The &quot;free&quot; cumulants of degree higher than 2 of the Wigner semicircle distribution are zero. This is one respect in which the role of the Wigner distribution in free probability theory is analogous to that of the normal distribution in conventional probability theory.

<text>Mandaluyong ( ; ), officially the City of Mandaluyong (, ), is a highly urbanized city in the National Capital Region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 425,758 people.

Located directly east of Manila, Mandaluyong was originally a barrio of Santa Ana de Sapa (now a district of Manila) called San Felipe Neri. It separated and became its own town in 1841, and later acquired the name Mandaluyong in 1931 during the American occupation. In 1994, it became the first municipality of Metro Manila to become a city since the metropolis&#x27; establishment in 1975.

At present, it is known for the Ortigas Center, a commercial and business center that it also shares with the city of Pasig. Notable institutions and establishments in the city include the Asian Development Bank, the headquarters of Banco de Oro and San Miguel Corporation and shopping malls like Shangri-La Plaza and SM Megamall.

The city is bordered by Manila to the west, San Juan to the north, Quezon City to the northeast, Pasig to the east, Taguig to the southeast, and Makati to the south. It is also the 6th-smallest city in the Philippines with a land area of , similar to Makati and Marikina.

==Etymology==
There are different stories on the origin of the name &quot;Mandaluyong&quot;.

One tells of how the place was abundant with a kind of tree called &quot;luyong&quot;, now more commonly known as &quot;anahaw&quot; (&quot;Saribus rotundifolius&quot;), from which canes and furniture were made.

Another claims that the Spaniards named the place based on the report of a navigator named Acapulco, who saw the rolling hills frequently being lashed at by &quot;daluyong&quot; (“big waves from the sea”). This seems to confirm traditional pre-Hispanic stories that giant waves from the sea would meet the adjoining hills of the vast lowland, referred to as &quot;salpukan ng alon&quot;. Felix dela Huerta, a Franciscan historian, observed that the rolling topography of this land resembled giant waves of the sea.

As with the etymological legends of many Philippine places, when the foreigners asked what the place was called, the locals answered with the description &quot;madaluyong&quot; (&quot;undulating&quot;), later transcribed by Spanish writers as &quot;Mandaluyong,&quot; with the addition of an “n”.

Another version of the name is based on a legend that a Maharlika named Luyong fell in love with Manda, the lovely daughter of a barangay chieftain. The chieftain did not like Luyong and forbade him Manda&#x27;s hand. Luyong overcame this objection by winning a series of tribal contests, as was the custom at the time. The couple settled thereafter in a place which was later called “Mandaluyong&quot; – a term made up of joining their names.

==History==
===Early history===
Residents of Mandaluyong have always been known for their industry. Men did the laundry to the amusement of non-residents until shortly after the war, while the women ironed the clothes.

These industrious people trace their roots to Emperor Soledan (also known as &quot;Anka Widyaya&quot; of the Great Majapahit Empire) and Empress Sasaban of the Kingdom of Sapa, whose son Prince Balagtas ruled as sovereign of the kingdom in about the year 1300.

More than a century later, in about the year 1470, it expanded and was called the &quot;Kingdom of Namayan&quot; with &quot;Lakan Takhan&quot; as sovereign. The vast Kingdom comprised what are now Quiapo, San Miguel, Sta, Mesa, Paco, Pandacan, Malate and Santa Ana in Manila, and Mandaluyong, San Juan, Makati, Pasay, Pateros, Taguig and Parañaque.

===Spanish colonial era===
====Foundation====
Mandaluyong was first known as a barrio of Santa Ana de Sapa, which was part of the District of Paco, Province of Tondo (later known as the Province of Manila). It was named San Felipe Neri by the Spaniards in honor of the patron saint of Rome. It was separated civilly from Santa Ana de Sapa in 1841.

On September 15, 1863, San Felipe Neri established its own parish. Under the administration of the Congregation “Dulcísimo Nombre de Jesús” (), it constructed its own church, convent and school. The Parish of San Felipe Neri played a significant role as a relay station for propagating the Katipunan during the 1896–1898 Revolution.

====Original barrios====
According to Pedro Patricio in his book &quot;Mandaluyong: 1837–1975&quot;, Mandaluyong had five original barrios: Poblacion, Barangka, Hagdang Bato, Namayan, and Hulo. This was according to the first recorded census in 1903. From these five evolved 22 sub-barrios.

====The Philippine revolution====
Mandaluyong was significant in the Philippine Revolution of 1896 as the baluarte (territory) of the Katipunan or &quot;Makabuhay&quot; group, with seventeen branches.

On August 29, 1896, Andres Bonifacio, together with Emilio Jacinto and other members of the Katipunan went into the house of Romualdo Vicencio at Sitio Balakbak (now Villa San Miguel) to prepare for the upcoming revolution against Spanish authority. In this site, Bonifacio read the last manifestation of the Katipunan before they transferred in Hagdan Bato, in the house of Felix Sanchez. This event is also known as the &quot;29 De Agosto&quot; and &quot;Pinagtipunan&quot; in which it is already named in two streets near the historic Barangay Hagdan Bato Itaas. It was in Barangay Hagdang Bato on August 28, 1896, where Andres Bonifacio issued a proclamation setting Saturday, August 29, 1896, as the date of the attack on Manila.

On August 30, 1896, after the successfully revolution in San Felipe Neri, the Katipuneros went to San Juan del Monte and attacked the El Polvorin (gunpowder depot) in order to amass more weapons to use against the Spaniards. This event is popularly known as the Battle of San Juan del Monte. It was also in this town that the revolutionary paper, &quot;La Republika&quot;, was established on September 15, 1896.

===American colonial era===
On June 11, 1901, San Felipe Neri was incorporated into the newly established province of Rizal. During the American Occupation, it was raised to a first-class municipality with five barrios, namely: Poblacion, Barangka, Hagdang Bato, Namayan and Hulo. By virtue of Act No. 942 dated November 6, 1903, it was consolidated with the municipality of San Juan del Monte and became the seat of the municipal government. For several months in 1904, San Felipe Neri became the capital of Rizal. San Juan del Monte was later separated from San Felipe Neri to regain its independent municipality status on March 27, 1907.

San Felipe Neri was renamed to its present name of Mandaluyong on November 6, 1931, by virtue of Act No. 3836. Many government infrastructures are established during the American Period, including the Correctional Institute for Women, Welfareville Compound, The Boy&#x27;s Town, and the National Center for Mental Health.

===Japanese occupation era=== 
From 1942 to 1945, during World War II, Mandaluyong formed part of the City of Greater Manila, along with Manila, Quezon City, and other nearby towns of Rizal. Also during the war, Mandaluyong lost many of her people; among them were Catholic priests and civilians. Destruction was felt all over, but with the timely arrival of the American Liberation Forces and the Philippine Commonwealth troops on February 9, 1945, the municipality was saved from further damages. That day became a red calendar day for Mandaluyong marking its liberation from the Japanese Imperial forces by the Allies.

===Philippine independence===
After World War II, Mandaluyong began to become progressive and dramatically increase the economy. Many infrastructures, companies, and other businesses were developed in 1950s–1960s and as the result, making Mandaluyong recognized as the most developed municipality in the province of Rizal.

====The Martial Law era====
====Ambush of Juan Ponce Enrile====

Mandaluyong played a small part in Ferdinand Marcos&#x27; efforts to rationalize his declaration of Martial law because the alleged 1972 ambush of Juan Ponce Enrile took place in Wack Wack, an exclusive neighborhood in Mandaluyong, in the hours immediately preceding its implementation. Because the alleged ambush took place in an exclusive subdivision, no independent eyewitnesses of the event have come forward, and witnesses of the immediate aftermath are few. This has lent credence to accounts which say that the ambush was faked, and that the site was selected specifically because it was easy to stage the incident there. The 14-year period which followed that night is remembered for the Marcos administration&#x27;s record of human rights abuses, particularly targeting political opponents, student activists, journalists, religious workers, farmers, and others who fought against the Marcos dictatorship.

====Industrial growth and government takeover efforts ====
A prominent figure in Philippine business before Martial Law was Mandaluyong-based industrialist Domingo M. Guevara Sr., whose success began when he created Radiowealth, a brand of affordable Philippine-made appliances including radios and televisions. This eventually became the Mandaluyong-based Guevara Enterprises which dominated the fields of electronics, communications, agriculture and industrial development, transportation, and manufacturing in the Philippines, whose headquarters was on Libertad (now D.M. Guevarra). National Artist Nick Joaqin noted that Guevara&#x27;s projects - which included the manufacturing the &quot;Sakbayan,&quot; which was the ever first Philippine-made car - brought the Philippine economy to the verge of Newly Industrialized Country status in the years before Martial Law. However, the growth of Guevara&#x27;s businesses stopped when he refused to surrender control of his businesses to President Ferdinand Marcos during Martial Law, and Marcos retaliated by making it difficult for Guevarra to do business.

====Separation from Rizal province====

On November 7, 1975, Mandaluyong was formally included in newly established Metropolitan Manila by virtue of Presidential Decree No. 824 signed by President Ferdinand Marcos.

===Cityhood===

By virtue of the 1987 Constitution, Mandaluyong and the then-municipality of San Juan were represented in Congress by a single congressman.

San Juan–Mandaluyong Representative Ronaldo Zamora sponsored a House Bill which eventually became Republic Act No. 7675 otherwise known as &quot;An Act Converting the Municipality of Mandaluyong into a Highly Urbanized City to be known as the City of Mandaluyong.&quot; President Fidel V. Ramos signed R.A. No. 7675 into law on February 9, 1994 (the 49th anniversary of its liberation from the Japanese), which was ratified through a plebiscite on April 10, 1994, making Mandaluyong the fifth city in Metro Manila. Mandaluyong became a lone district with its own representative in Congress. Prior to the enactment of the assailed statute, the municipalities of Mandaluyong and San Juan belonged to only one legislative district.

===Contemporary===

<text>In gridiron football, defensive backs (DBs), also called the secondary, are the players on the defensive side of the ball who play farthest back from the line of scrimmage. They are distinguished from the other two sets of defensive players, the defensive linemen who play directly on the line of scrimmage, and the linebackers, who play in the middle of the defense, and between the defensive line and the defensive backs.

Among all the defensive backs, there are two main types, cornerbacks, which play nearer the line of scrimmage and the sideline, whose main role is to cover the opposing team&#x27;s wide receivers, and the safeties, who play further back near the center of the field, and who act as the last line of defense. American defensive formations usually includes two of each, a left and right cornerback, as well as a strong safety and a free safety, with the free safety tending to play further back than the strong safety. In Canadian football, which has twelve players on the field compared to the eleven of American football, there is an additional position called defensive halfback, which plays like a hybrid between a linebacker and cornerback. Canadian formations include two cornerbacks, two halfbacks and one safety, for a total of five defensive backs.

Besides the standard set of defensive backs, teams may also remove a defensive lineman or a linebacker and replace them with an additional defensive back. The fifth defensive back is commonly called the nickelback (so named because a five-cent coin in the U.S. and Canada is called a nickel). By extension, a sixth defensive back is called a dimeback (because the next value coin in the U.S. and Canada is called a dime). Rarely, teams may employ seven or even eight defensive backs.

Historic notable defensive backs include Hall-of-Famers Dick &quot;Night Train&quot; Lane, Mike Haynes, Ronnie Lott, Troy Polamalu, Deion Sanders, Darrelle Revis, and Ed Reed, among others. In 2019, the National Football League released its all-time team in honor of the league&#x27;s 100th anniversary, in which the top defensive backs in its history were noted and honored.

Longtime National Football League executive and renowned former general manager of the Dallas Cowboys, Gil Brandt released a list of the top cornerbacks of all time.

<doc id="359692" wikidata="Q987260" url="?curid=359692" title="Dishonoured cheque">
<text>A dishonoured cheque (US spelling: dishonored check) is a cheque that the bank on which it is drawn declines to pay (“honour”). There are a number of reasons why a bank might refuse to honour a cheque, with non-sufficient funds (NSF) being the most common, indicating that there are insufficient cleared funds in the account on which the cheque was drawn. An NSF cheque may be referred to as a bad cheque, dishonoured cheque, bounced cheque, cold cheque, rubber cheque, returned item, or hot cheque. Lost or bounced cheques result in late payments and affect the relationship with customers. In England and Wales and Australia, such cheques are typically returned endorsed &quot;Refer to drawer&quot;, an instruction to contact the person issuing the cheque for an explanation as to why it was not paid. If there are funds in an account, but insufficient cleared funds, the cheque is normally endorsed “Present again”, by which time the funds should have cleared.

When more than one cheque is presented for payment on the same day, and the payment of both would result in the account becoming overdrawn (or below some approved credit limit), the bank has a discretion as to which cheque to pay and which to dishonour. A bank has a general discretion whether or not to honour a cheque that will result in an account becoming overdrawn, but a payment on one occasion does not bind the bank to do so again on another occasion. A bank cannot partially pay on a cheque, so that it must either pay a cheque in full or dishonour it. If a bank declines to pay a cheque, it must promptly return the cheque to the person who deposited it or presented it to be cashed. In general, a bank can only pay out of the account on which it was drawn, and cannot draw on any other account that the customer may have at the bank, unless expressly instructed to the contrary.

==Reasons for dishonour==
Cheques may be dishonoured by a financial institution because:
* There are insufficient cleared funds in the account to cover the value of the cheque.
* The account holder has instructed the bank not to pay the cheque (called a stopped cheque).
* The account holder&#x27;s funds have been frozen.
* The account does not actually exist, either due to a false cheque being presented, an error in writing the account number, or the account being closed. 
* The cheque has expired, is cashed before the date on the cheque, or the date on the cheque is erroneous.
* There is a discrepancy in the amounts written in numbers and the amount in words.
* The cheque is scribbled or overwritten.
* The signature on the cheque does not match the signature on file of the account holder or an authorised signatory on the account, or has touched the MICR strip on the cheque.
* The cheque is damaged.

==Process==

If a bank receives a cheque that it would normally dishonour, such as there being insufficient funds in an account on which it is drawn, the manager may as a courtesy contact the customer to advise them of the situation to allow them to rectify the situation promptly to avoid a cheque being dishonoured. The bank is not obliged to contact the customer, and is unlikely to do so more than once.

When a cheque is dishonoured, the bank customer may be charged a dishonour fee by their bank. If paying the cheque would result in the account becoming overdrawn, the bank may in its discretion still honour the cheque. In this situation, the bank may charge an overdraft establishment fee, in addition to interest at the overdraft rate until the account is back in credit.

If a cheque is dishonoured for any reason, the bank on which it is drawn must promptly return the cheque to the depositor&#x27;s (payee&#x27;s) bank, which will ultimately return it to the depositor. The depositor&#x27;s bank will debit the amount of the cheque from the depositor&#x27;s account into which it had been deposited, as well as a service fee.

Depending on the reason for a cheque being dishonoured, the depositor may determine whether to re-submit the cheque, hoping it will be paid on a second attempt, or else proceed immediately with collection activities, civil or criminal.

==Consequences of insufficient funds==
Among the consequences of issuing a NSF cheque are actions by financial institutions, civil liability to the drawee, and possible criminal penalties. When a bad cheque is negotiated, the recipient of the cheque may choose to take action against the drawer. The action that is taken may be a civil collection action or lawsuit, or seeking criminal charges, depending on the amount of the cheque and the laws in the jurisdiction where the cheque is drawn.

===Civil consequences===
If the dishonoured cheque has been scanned and replaced by a substitute cheque, the original cheque is not returned to the depositor, but instead the substitute cheque will be marked &quot;not sufficient funds&quot; and returned to the depositor. The recipient may choose not to accept cheques in the future from the writer (typically recorded on a paper or electronic &quot;Do not accept cheques from...&quot; list), or may suspend the cheque-writer&#x27;s privileges until the cheque-writer has made good on the debt.

The recipient may also choose to report the writer to a database service. This may lead to other merchants in the future refusing to accept cheques from the writer or a joint account holder, or the writer having trouble obtaining a chequing account at another bank. If a merchant or other place of business receives too many bad cheques from customers, it may simply decide to not accept any cheques at all from anyone.

===Criminal consequences===
In some cases the issuance of a NSF cheque may result in criminal prosecution of the drawer of the cheque. Criminal charges are more likely where the drawer can be shown to have issued the cheque knowing that it would not be honoured. Charges are also more likely when the NSF cheque is for a large amount, or where the drawer issues multiple NSF checks.

==Prevention==
Steps that can be taken to reduce the likelihood of a bad cheque include:
*Carrying a higher balance in the chequing account; that is to always have a &quot;buffer&quot; amount just in case an unexpected cheque does clear
*Better balancing techniques
*Overdraft protection – This may be in the form of a link to a savings account from which funds will be automatically transferred, a credit card, or a line of credit designed specially for this purpose
*Using a credit card, debit card, or cash instead of cheques

==Legal issues==

===Australia===
The &quot;Cheques Act 1986&quot; (Cth) imposes strict liability on the drawer of a dishonoured cheque. The payee may sue the drawer on the cheque itself, who may not have been the original debtor.

===India===
In India, a bounced cheque is a criminal offence, punishable by fines, jail term, or both under Section 138 of the Negotiable Instruments Act, 1881.

===Israel===
In Israel, a bounced cheque without cover incurs a negative record in the credit history of account holder(s). Ten bounced cheques during a year would result in the restriction of cheques for the account, and the bank will bounce new cheques for a year. If the account owner continues to draw cheques during the restriction period, that person&#x27;s accounts in all Israeli banks will be denied from issuing cheques.

Dishonoured cheque can be presented to the state bailiff service for being forcedly paid.

=== United Arab Emirates ===
Until January 2013, a bounced cheque was a criminal offence in the United Arab Emirates that led to imprisonment of the person who wrote it.

===United States===
In many jurisdictions in the United States, a bad check restitution program exists that allows recipients of bad cheques to collect the funds from the local district attorney&#x27;s office, regardless of the amount. An agency run by the district attorney will pursue the drawer of the cheque by attempting to collect the funds in exchange for avoiding criminal prosecution. The cheque drawer will be responsible to cover the amount of the cheque , plus all fees to which the recipient is legally entitled, plus a programme fee. The drawer will also be required to take a course designed to improve cheque-writing habits. These programmes are controversial and in recent years have come under fire in lawsuits. Normally, if the cheque writer can cover up their bad credits in sixty days, all charges will be dropped.

In some jurisdictions, for a criminal prosecution on a bad cheque there must be some element of fraud involved in the issuance of the cheque. In some U.S. states, if the cheque drawer informs the party they are uttering the cheque to that it will not clear at the current time (such as asking someone to &quot;hold&quot; a cheque for a few days), if the cheque bounces, they can still be sued for the value of the cheque, but warning the recipient before acceptance that the cheque will not clear immediately negates the element of fraud and prevents criminal prosecution. For similar reasons, a post-dated cheque will not normally support a conviction for issuing a NSF cheque.

===United Kingdom===
In England and Wales, the use of the endorsement &quot;refer to drawer&quot; has become standard after a bank was successfully sued for libel after returning a cheque incorrectly endorsed &quot;insufficient funds&quot;; the court ruled that, as there were sufficient funds, the statement was demonstrably false and damaging to the reputation of the person issuing the cheque. Even with the use of this revised endorsement, the mere implication that funds were insufficient has been held to be libelous in other cases of banks mistakenly refusing to pay cheques.

<doc id="359695" wikidata="Q48437" url="?curid=359695" title="Article Seven of the United States Constitution">
<text>Article Seven of the United States Constitution sets the number of state ratifications necessary for the Constitution to take effect and prescribes the method through which the states may ratify it. Under the terms of Article VII, constitutional ratification conventions were held in each of the thirteen states, with the ratification of nine states required for the Constitution to take effect. Delaware was the first state to ratify the Constitution, doing so on December 7, 1787. On June 21, 1788, New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify the Constitution, ensuring that the Constitution would take effect. Rhode Island was the last state to ratify the Constitution under Article VII, doing so on May 29, 1790.

==Text==
==Background==
On September 20, 1787, three days after its adoption by the Constitutional Convention, the drafted Constitution was submitted to the Congress of the Confederation for its endorsement. After eight days of debate, the opposing sides came to the first of many compromises that would define the ratification process. The Confederation Congress voted to release the proposed Constitution to the states for their consideration, but neither endorsed nor opposed its ratification.

==Ratification==
The Constitution was ratified by the 13 states between December 7, 1787, and May 29, 1790, as follows:

==Implementation==

In 1787 and 1788, following the Constitutional Convention, a great debate took place throughout the United States over the Constitution that had been proposed. The supporters of the Constitution began the ratification campaign in those states where there was little or no controversy, postponing until later the more difficult ones.

On June 21, 1788, New Hampshire became the ninth state to ratify the Constitution, thus establishing it as the new framework of governance for the United States. Though officially enacted, four states, Virginia, New York, North Carolina, and Rhode Island remained outside the new government. The Congress of the Confederation chose March 4, 1789, as the day &quot;for commencing proceedings under the Constitution.&quot; Virginia and New York ratified the Constitution before the members of the new Congress assembled on the appointed day to bring the new government into operation.

After twelve amendments, including the ten in the Bill of Rights, were sent to the states in June 1789, North Carolina ratified the Constitution. Finally, Rhode Island, after having rejected the Constitution in a March 1788 referendum, called a ratifying convention in 1790. Faced with the threat of being treated as a foreign government, it ratified the Constitution by just two votes.

<text>Pierre &quot;Peter&quot; Charles L&#x27;Enfant (; August 2, 1754June 14, 1825) was a French-American artist, professor, and military engineer. In 1791, L&#x27;Enfant designed the baroque-styled plan for the development of Washington, D.C., after it was designated to become the capital of the United States following its relocation from Philadelphia. His work, known as the L&#x27;Enfant Plan, inspired plans for other major world capitals, including Brasília, New Delhi, and Canberra. In the U.S., plans for the development of three major cities, Detroit, Indianapolis, and Sacramento, were inspired from from L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s plan for Washington, D.C. 

==Early life and education==
L&#x27;Enfant was born on August 2, 1754, in the Gobelins section of Paris, France, in the 13th arrondissement on the city&#x27;s left bank. He was the third child and second son of Pierre L&#x27;Enfant (1704–1787), a painter and professor at Royal Academy of Painting and Sculpture known for his panoramas of battles, and Marie Charlotte Leullier, the daughter of a French military officer. In 1758, his brother Pierre Joseph died at six, and Pierre Charles became the eldest son. He studied with an intense curriculum at the Royal Academy from 1771 until 1776 with his father being one of his instructors. Academy classes were held at the Louvre, benefiting from the close proximity to some of Paris&#x27; greatest landmarks, such as the Tuileries Garden and Champs-Élysées, both designed by André Le Nôtre, and Place de la Concorde. L&#x27;Enfant would have also learned about city and urban planning during his time at the academy, likely examining baroque plans for Rome by Domenico Fontana and London by Sir Christopher Wren.

He was described by William Wilson Corcoran as &quot;a tall, erect man, fully six feet in height, finely proportioned, nose prominent, of military bearing, courtly air and polite manners, his figure usually enveloped in a long overcoat and surmounted by a bell-crowned hat -- a man who would attract attention in any assembly.&quot; Sarah De Hart, daughter of New Jersey statesman John De Hart, drew a silhouette of L&#x27;Enfant in 1785, which now hangs in the Diplomatic Reception Rooms at the United States Department of State.

==Career==
===Military service===

After his education L&#x27;Enfant was recruited by Pierre Augustin Caron de Beaumarchais to serve in the American Revolutionary War in the United States. He arrived in 1777 at the age of 23, and served as a military engineer in the Continental Army with Major General Lafayette. He was commissioned as a captain in the Corps of Engineers on April 3, 1779, to rank from February 18, 1778.

Despite his aristocratic origins, L&#x27;Enfant closely identified with the United States, changing his first name from Pierre to Peter when he first came to the rebelling colonies in 1777. L&#x27;Enfant served on General George Washington&#x27;s staff at Valley Forge. While there, the Marquis de Lafayette commissioned L&#x27;Enfant to paint a portrait of Washington.

During the war, L&#x27;Enfant made a number of pencil portraits of George Washington and other Continental Army officers. He also made at least two paintings of Continental Army encampments in 1782. They depict panoramas of West Point and Washington&#x27;s tent at Verplanck&#x27;s Point. The latter details what is believed to be &quot;the only known wartime depiction of Washington’s tent by an eyewitness.&quot; The seven-and-a-half-foot-long painting was purchased by the Museum of American Revolution in Philadelphia.

In the fall of 1779, L’Enfant contributed to the Regulations for the Order and Discipline of the Troops of the United States, authored by General Friedrich Wilhelm von Steuben. He was tasked to draft the eight &quot;plates&quot; or illustrations detailing camp and troop formations, as he was the only artistically trained individual involved. The &quot;Blue Book&quot; was completed by April 1779, receiving approval from General Washington and Congress. For his efforts, Congress awarded L’Enfant $500 and officially promoted him to captain of engineers, retroactive to February 1778.

L&#x27;Enfant was wounded at the Siege of Savannah on October 9, 1779. He recovered and became a prisoner of war at the surrender of Charleston, South Carolina, on May 12, 1780. He was exchanged in November 1780 and served on General Washington&#x27;s staff for the remainder of the American Revolution. While the historical consensus generally attributes the creation of the Badge of Military Merit, later known as the Purple Heart, to George Washington in 1782, there is an implied claim by Pamela Scott, Washington D.C. historian and former editor of The L&#x27;Enfant Papers at the Library of Congress, that L&#x27;Enfant may have conceived the medal&#x27;s design. L&#x27;Enfant was promoted by brevet to Major in the Corps of Engineers on May 2, 1783, in recognition of his service to the cause of American liberty. He was discharged when the Continental Army was disbanded in December 1783. In acknowledgment of his Revolutionary War contributions, L&#x27;Enfant received 300 acres of land in present-day Ohio from the United States. However, he never set foot on or resided in the granted land. A map outlining the territory was sketched on the reverse side of a segment of L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s land deed, signed by President Thomas Jefferson on January 13, 1803.

===Post–Revolutionary War===

Following the American Revolutionary War, L&#x27;Enfant settled in New York City and achieved fame as an architect by redesigning the City Hall in New York for the First Congress of the United States (See: Federal Hall).

L&#x27;Enfant also designed furniture and houses for the wealthy, as well as coins and medals. Among the medals was the eagle-shaped badge of the Society of the Cincinnati, an organization of former officers of the Continental Army of which he was a founder. At the request of George Washington, the first President of the Society, L&#x27;Enfant had the insignias made in France during a 1783–84 visit to his father and helped to organize a chapter of the Society there.

In 1787, L&#x27;Enfant received an inheritance upon his father&#x27;s death that included a farm in Normandy. His military pension and success as a designer provided financial stability enabling him to pursue his career and contribute to various projects for a period of time. While L&#x27;Enfant was in New York City, he was initiated into Freemasonry. His initiation took place on April 17, 1789, at Holland Lodge No. 8, F &amp; A M, which the Grand Lodge of New York F &amp; A M had chartered in 1787. L&#x27;Enfant took only the first of three degrees offered by the Lodge and did not progress further in Freemasonry.

L&#x27;Enfant designed the &quot;Glory&quot; ornamentation above the altar in St. Paul&#x27;s Church. The chapel, built in 1766, is the oldest continuously used building in New York City. George Washington worshipped there on his inauguration day. The intricate design vividly depicts Mt. Sinai amidst clouds and lightning, capturing the dramatic moment of divine revelation. At the center of the piece is the Hebrew word for &quot;God&quot; enclosed within a triangle, symbolizing the Holy Trinity. Below, the two tablets of the Law are inscribed with the Ten Commandments, highlighting the enduring significance of these foundational moral laws.

L&#x27;Enfant was also a close friend of Alexander Hamilton. Some of their correspondences from 1793 to 1801 now reside in the Library of Congress. Hamilton is credited with helping L&#x27;Enfant with the federal city commission.

===Plan for Washington, D.C.===

The new Constitution of the United States, which took effect in March and April 1789, gave the newly organized Congress of the United States authority to establish a federal district up to 10 miles square in size. L&#x27;Enfant had already written first to President George Washington, asking to be commissioned to plan the city. However, a decision on the capital was put on hold until July 1790 when the First Congress passed the &quot;Residence Act&quot;, setting the site of the new federal district and national capital to be on the shores of the Potomac River.

The Residence Act was the result of an important early political compromise between northern and southern congressional delegations, brokered by new cabinet members, Secretary of the Treasury Alexander Hamilton of New York and political opponent, Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, of Virginia. It specified the new capital would be situated on the northern and southern banks of the Potomac River, at some location, to be determined by the president, between the Eastern Branch (now referred to as the Anacostia River) near Washington&#x27;s estate of Mount Vernon and the confluence with the Conococheague Creek, further upstream near Hagerstown, Maryland. The Residence Act also gave authority to President Washington to appoint three commissioners to oversee the survey of the ten mile square federal district and &quot;according to such Plans, as the President shall approve,&quot; provide public buildings to accommodate the Federal government in 1800.
President Washington appointed L&#x27;Enfant in 1791 to plan the new &quot;Federal City&quot;, later named the &quot;City of Washington&quot; under the supervision of the three Commissioners, who Washington had appointed to oversee the planning and development of the federal territory that would later become designated the &quot;District of Columbia&quot;. Included in the new district were the river port towns of Georgetown (formerly in Montgomery County of the State of Maryland) and Alexandria (in Fairfax County, in the Commonwealth of Virginia). 

Thomas Jefferson, who worked alongside President Washington in overseeing the plans for the development of the new capital, sent L&#x27;Enfant a letter outlining his task, which was to provide a drawing of suitable sites for the federal city and the public buildings. Though Jefferson had modest ideas for the Capital, L&#x27;Enfant saw the task as far more grandiose, believing he was not only surveying the capital, but devising the city plan and designing the buildings. The work of André Le Nôtre, particularly his Gardens of Versailles and Tuileries Garden, is said to have influenced L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s master plan for the capital.

====Arrival in Georgetown====
L&#x27;Enfant arrived in Georgetown on March 9, 1791, and began his work, from Suter&#x27;s Fountain Inn. Washington arrived later on March 28, to meet with L&#x27;Enfant and the Commissioners for several days. On June 22, L&#x27;Enfant presented his first plan for the federal city to the President. On August 19, he appended a new map to a letter that he sent to the President. 100 square miles, roughly 6,000 acres, had been allocated to the city with the ambitious goal of having one million residents inhabit the area; it was to be as large as the occupied portions of New York, Boston, and Philadelphia combined. In a letter to then Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson, L’Enfant stated that his models for the new city included such “grand” cities as London, Madrid, Paris, Amsterdam, Naples, Venice, Genoa, and Florence.

L&#x27;Enfant collaborated with a talented team of assistants whose contributions were instrumental in realizing his grand vision. Among these collaborators were Andrew Ellicott, a skilled surveyor whose meticulous measurements helped lay the groundwork for the city&#x27;s layout. Benjamin Banneker, an African American mathematician and surveyor, provided invaluable expertise and calculations essential to the project. Étienne Sulpice Hallet or Stephen Hallet, an accomplished architect, served as a draftsman. Alexander Ralston, renowned for his urban design prowess, helped L&#x27;Enfant lay out the city plan. Isaac Roberdeau, a competent draftsman and son of the American founding father Daniel Roberdeau, served as L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s main assistant. Together, this diverse team of assistants collaborated closely with L&#x27;Enfant, each contributing their unique skills and expertise to the creation of the plan for the nation&#x27;s capital.

President Washington retained a copy of one of L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s plans, showed it to the Congress, and later gave it to the three Commissioners. The U.S. Library of Congress now holds both the plan that Washington apparently gave to the Commissioners and an undated anonymous &quot;dotted line&quot; survey map that the Library considers L&#x27;Enfant to have drawn before August 19, 1791. The full plan identifies &quot;Peter Charles L&#x27;Enfant&quot; as its author in the last line of an oval in its upper left corner. The &quot;dotted line&quot; survey map may be one that L&#x27;Enfant appended to his August 19 letter to the President.

L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s &quot;Plan of the city intended for the permanent seat of the government of the United States..&#x27;&quot; encompassed an area bounded by the Potomac River, the Eastern Branch, the base of the escarpment of the Atlantic Seaboard Fall Line, and Rock Creek. His plan specified locations for two buildings, the &quot;Congress House&quot; (the United States Capitol) and the &quot;President&#x27;s House&quot; (known after its 1815–1817 rebuilding and re-painting of its stone walls, as the &quot;White House&quot; or &quot;Executive Mansion&quot;). The plan specified that most streets would be laid out in a grid. To form the grid, some streets (later named for letters of the alphabet) would travel in an east–west direction, while others (named for numbers) would travel in a north–south direction. Diagonal broader avenues, later named after the states of the Union, crossed the north–south-east/west grid. The diagonal avenues intersected with the north–south and east–west streets at circles and rectangular plazas that would later honor notable Americans and provide open space. The 15 states at the time were each allocated a square to build on and decorate as they saw fit. They would be located along the avenues and were to be easily visible from each other to engender friendly competition. L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s plan additionally laid out a system of canals (later designated as the Washington City Canal) that would pass the &quot;Congress House&quot; and the &quot;President&#x27;s House&quot;. One branch of the canal would empty into the Potomac River south of the &quot;President&#x27;s House&quot; at the mouth of old Tiber Creek, which would be channelized and straightened.

==== Congress House ====

The &quot;Congress House&quot; would be built on &quot;Jenkins Hill&quot; (later to be known as &quot;Capitol Hill&quot;), which L&#x27;Enfant described as a &quot;pedestal awaiting a monument&quot;. Emphasizing the importance of the new Nation&#x27;s Legislature, the &quot;Congress House&quot; would be located on a longitude designated as 0:0. A sunburst of avenues would radiate out from this structure affirming its role as the center of the new republic. John Trumbull was given a tour of &quot;Jenkins Hill&quot; by L&#x27;Enfant himself; Trumbull confirmed in his autobiography that the concept for a &quot;great circular room and dome&quot; had originated with L&#x27;Enfant. It is unknown what L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s vision for the capitol building would have looked like. However, a separate plan submitted at a later date by his draftsman Étienne Sulpice Hallet might provides researchers a glimpse of what L&#x27;Enfant may have had in mind. Hallet&#x27;s plan incorporates L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s ideas and shows different points of focus that align with the radiating avenues, thus ensuring harmony and balance that was important to L&#x27;Enfant.

==== President&#x27;s House ====
L&#x27;Enfant envisioned the &quot;President&#x27;s House&quot; (later to be known as The White House), to have public gardens and monumental architecture. Reflecting his grandiose visions, he specified that the &quot;President&#x27;s House&quot; (occasionally referred to as the &quot;President&#x27;s Palace&quot;) would be five times the size of the building that was actually constructed, even then becoming the largest residence then constructed in America. The &quot;President&#x27;s House&quot; would be located at a northwest diagonal from the &quot;Congress House&quot; along the future Pennsylvania Avenue. while situated on a ridge parallel to the Potomac River, north of a riverfront marsh and Tiber Creek.

====National Mall====
L&#x27;Enfant laid out a -wide garden-lined &quot;grand avenue&quot;, which he expected to travel for about along an east–west axis in the center of an area that would later become the National Mall. The figure 1.6 symbolizes the Golden Ratio and is considered significant in art and architecture for creating visually appealing compositions. It can be found in many natural and man-made objects. The Mall was to be a democratic and egalitarian space—the complete opposite of the gardens of Versailles where only royalty and nobility accessed similar spaces in size and scope. It was to be flanked by gardens and spacious accommodations for foreign ministers.

====Pennsylvania Avenue====

L&#x27;Enfant also laid out a narrower avenue, later named Pennsylvania Avenue, which connected two important landmarks: &quot;Congress House&quot; and the &quot;President&#x27;s House&quot;. Following the trajectory of the old Ferry Road, Pennsylvania Avenue would start from Georgetown—across the federal city—to the drawbridge by the Eastern Branch. The width of the avenue was set at 160 feet, identical to the narrowest points of the Champs Elysees in Paris that L&#x27;Enfant is likely to have examined. The most common explanation for the avenue being named after the state of Pennsylvania is likely pride of place to make up for losing the capital.

====Plan revisions and dismissal====
L&#x27;Enfant secured the lease of quarries at Wigginton Island and further southeast along Aquia Creek off the lower Potomac River&#x27;s southern bank in Virginia to supply well-regarded &quot;Aquia Creek sandstone&quot; for the foundation and later for the wall slabs and blocks of the &quot;Congress House&quot; in November 1791. However, his temperament and his insistence that his city design be realized as a whole brought him into conflict with the Commissioners, who wanted to direct the limited funds available into the construction of the Federal buildings. In this, they had the support of Secretary of State Thomas Jefferson. Meanwhile, a concurrent plot began brewing that involved a local and wealthy landowner named Daniel Carroll of Duddington. He built a house that protruded exactly where L&#x27;Enfant planned for New Jersey Avenue SE to run; L&#x27;Enfant had the house torn down which infuriated the owner.

During a contentious period in February 1792, Andrew Ellicott, who had been conducting the original boundary survey of the future District of Columbia (see: Boundary markers of the original District of Columbia) and the survey of the &quot;Federal City&quot; under the direction of the Commissioners, informed the Commissioners that L&#x27;Enfant had not been able to have the city plan engraved and had refused to provide him with the original plan (of which L&#x27;Enfant had prepared several versions). Additionally, L&#x27;Enfant hinted that he rendered draft plans for the &quot;Congress House&quot; and &quot;President&#x27;s House&quot;, but he was not ready to share them. During a trip to Philadelphia in December 1791, his office had been burgled and sketches and plans for the city and public buildings had been stolen.

Andrew Ellicott stated in his letters that, although he was refused the original plan, he was familiar with L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s system and had many notes of the surveys that he had made himself. It is, therefore, possible that Ellicott recreated the plan. Ellicott, with the aid of his brother, Benjamin Ellicott, later revised the plan, despite L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s protests. Ellicott&#x27;s revisions included the straightening of Massachusetts Avenue, the removal of Randolph Square (close to present-day Shaw Library) and geometric changes to the public spaces. In L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s plan, the original design of what became known as Dupont Circle was rectangular while Logan Circle featured a triangular shape.

Shortly thereafter, Washington dismissed L&#x27;Enfant due to insubordination. Andrew Ellicott continued the city survey in accordance with the revised plan, several versions of which were engraved, published and distributed. As a result, Ellicott&#x27;s revisions subsequently became the basis for the capital city&#x27;s development. Ellicott&#x27;s brother Joseph later adopted the radial plan of Washington for Buffalo, New York.

However, L&#x27;Enfant was not the only person to experience frustration overseeing the project. Ellicott complained to Washington on March 16, 1793, and expressed immense dissatisfaction at being rushed through his work. He left the project and the role of chief surveyor and planner fell to a succession of men: Isaac Briggs, Benjamin Ellicott and Joseph Ellicott, Thomas Freeman, Nicholas King, Robert King Sr., and Nicholas King again. In 1802, Jefferson relieved the Commissioners of their duties and appointed three individuals to report directly to him on matters concerning the city&#x27;s development: Thomas Munroe was appointed superintendent, Nicholas King assumed the role of surveyor for the federal city, and Benjamin Latrobe was designated as surveyor of public buildings.

===Later works===

Soon after leaving the national capital area, L&#x27;Enfant prepared the initial plans for the city of Paterson, in northeast New Jersey along the Passaic River, but was discharged from this project after a year had passed. However, in 1846 the city reinstated the original scheme proposed by L&#x27;Enfant after the city&#x27;s raceway system encountered problems. During the same period (1792–1793) he designed Robert Morris&#x27;s mansion in Philadelphia, which was never finished because of his delays and Morris&#x27;s bankruptcy. In 1794, L&#x27;Enfant was placed in charge of reconstructing Fort Mifflin on Mud Island in the Delaware River below Philadelphia.

In 1812, L&#x27;Enfant was offered a position as a professor of engineering at United States Military Academy, at West Point, New York, but declined that post. He later served as a professor of engineering at West Point from 1813 to 1817. In 1814, acting secretary of war James Monroe hired L&#x27;Enfant to oversee the design and reconstruction of Fort Washington on the Potomac River southeast of Washington, D.C., but others soon replaced him. Monroe urged L&#x27;Enfant to be more economical as project costs soared. Ultimately, L&#x27;Enfant left the project due to these financial issues.

L&#x27;Enfant had no part in planning or platting Perrysburg, Ohio, or Indianapolis, Indiana, as has been claimed in Internet postings. Alexander Bourne, Joseph Wampler and William Brookfield surveyed and platted the future Perrysburg area in 1816. Alexander Ralston, an engineer who had assisted L&#x27;Enfant in planning the city of Washington, used elements of L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s plan for his own design and survey in the 1820s of the future city of Indianapolis (the state capital of Indiana).

==Death==
L&#x27;Enfant approached his financial matters with a casual attitude, especially related to payment for his work. Operating on a gentlemanly code of conduct, L&#x27;Enfant believed that if he committed his efforts to a project, he would eventually receive compensation and/or more work, without the need for formal contracts. This laissez-faire approach meant that L&#x27;Enfant often found himself in precarious financial situations. L&#x27;Enfant also valued fame and notoriety over money and land. After his work on Federal Hall for Washington&#x27;s inauguration, the Common Council of New York offered L&#x27;Enfant honorary citizenship and a ten-acre plot on the city&#x27;s northern edge; he accepted citizenship, but declined the plot. However, in times of financial desperation, he demanded back pay for his work and was dissatisfied when the amounts offered did not meet his expectations.

In an 1806 journal entry, architect Benjamin Latrobe said the following of the major: &quot;Daily through the city stalks the picture of famine, L&#x27;Enfant and his dog. The plan of the city is probably his, though others claim it. He had the courage to undertake any public work whatever was offered to him. He has not succeeded in any, but was always honest and is now miserably poor. He is too proud to receive any assistance, and it is very doubtful in what manner he subsists.&quot;

Although the United States Congress paid him $4,600 in 1808 and $1,300 in 1810 for his work on the design of the City of Washington, after many years of petitioning for back pay and recognition, L&#x27;Enfant lost most of the money from a lawsuit filed by his friend and housemate, Richard Soderstrom, the Swedish counsel to the United States. Soderstrom claimed that the L&#x27;Enfant owed him for a decade worth of rent, firewood, and meals among other things. He had supported L&#x27;Enfant with his quest for back pay and was also in a position to know when Congress might act on the matter. Sadly, L&#x27;Enfant &quot;had become the victim of an outright swindle.&quot;.

In his final years, he befriended Thomas Digges and became a permanent guest at the family estate in Maryland. His days there consisted of tending to flowers, passionately absorbing himself in work, and recuperating from his medical afflictions. L&#x27;Enfant died on June 14, 1825, and was originally buried at the Green Hill farm in Chillum, Prince George&#x27;s County, Maryland. He left behind three watches, three compasses, some books, some maps, and surveying instruments, the total value was forty-six dollars.

==Legacy==


For four decades following L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s death, Washington was seen as a stillborn city, growing slowly and remaining a collection of muddy villages. After John Adams left office, Democratic-Republicans insisted the federal city remain small and modest, believing in limited government and fearing grandiose buildings would symbolize excessive power. They aimed for a capital reflecting republican virtues of simplicity and frugality, avoiding European-style ostentation and ensuring the city did not overshadow the states.

Between the administrations of Thomas Jefferson and Abraham Lincoln, many presidents neglected the city&#x27;s overall upkeep and development, resulting in inadequate infrastructure, poor planning, and overall chaos. In an 1800 letter to the commissioners, L&#x27;Enfant accused some politicians of being infatuated with the idea of the city becoming a &quot;mere contemptible hamlet.&quot; The lack of basic infrastructure led to unsanitary conditions, with the Washington City Canal becoming an open sewer. Summer heat and oppressive humidity compounded these issues. President Lincoln&#x27;s third son died from typhoid fever likely due to contaminated water. Crime and gang violence proliferated, creating the rise of unstable neighborhoods like Hell&#x27;s Bottom (Shaw), Murder Bay (Federal Triangle), and Swampoodle (NoMa). The Mall was a wasteland where animals grazed casually around an unfinished Washington Monument. Slave trading was rampant and often operated near the Capitol and White House.

Charles Dickens, in his 1842 visit, famously characterized the city as &quot;the City of Magnificent Intentions&quot; due to its incomplete streets and buildings. Considered a national embarrassment, the capital faced significant challenges, transforming into a hotbed of issues that tarnished its image. Foreign diplomats considered their assignments to the city as a hardship post.

The city&#x27;s fortunes changed after the American Civil War and the election of President Ulysses S. Grant and his appointment of Alexander Robey Shepherd as head of the DC Board of Public Works from 1871 to 1873. Shepherd rapidly improved infrastructure by paving roads, installing gas and sewer lines, and planting thousands of trees. Through these investments in public works, Grant squashed debates about moving the capital westward. In 1874, landscape architect Frederick Law Olmsted was asked to redesign the Capitol grounds, addressing issues with its placement by building marble terraces on the west front.

At the beginning of the 20th century, the ideals of the City Beautiful movement influenced the McMillan Commission under the leadership of Senator James McMillan, (1838–1902) of Michigan, who modified L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s plan within a report that recommended a partial redesign of the capital city. Among other things, the commission&#x27;s report laid out a plan for a sweeping mall in the area of L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s widest &quot;grand avenue&quot;, which had not yet been constructed. The McMillan Plan has since been instrumental in the further development of Washington, D.C. (See: History of Washington, D.C. in the 20th century). Frederick Law Olmsted Jr., (&quot;Rick&quot; Olmsted), was part of the Commission alongside Daniel Burnham, Charles Follen McKim and Augustus Saint-Gaudens.

At the instigation of a French ambassador to the United States, Jean Jules Jusserand, L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s adopted nation then recognized his contributions. In 1909, L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s remains were exhumed from their burial site at Green Hill and placed in a metal-lined casket. After lying in state at the Capitol rotunda, L&#x27;Enfant was re-interred in front of Arlington House on a slope in Arlington National Cemetery in Virginia. His re-burial site overlooks the Potomac River and the portion of Washington, D.C., that he had originally designed. In 1911, a monument was placed on top of L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s grave during a dedication ceremony at which President William Howard Taft, Jusserand, and Senator Elihu Root spoke. Engraved on the monument is a portion of L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s plan in a diagram map, which Andrew Ellicott&#x27;s revision and the McMillan Commission&#x27;s plan had superseded.

When the British decided to move the capital of their Indian Empire from Calcutta to Delhi in 1911, by creating a new district of the latter entitled New Delhi, architect Sir Edwin Lutyens took inspiration from the McMillan Plan with the inclusion of broad avenues and a ceremonial axis placing important monuments at strategic locations.

Today, various government agencies such as the National Capital Planning Commission and United States Commission of Fine Arts oversee development in the city and surrounding areas ensuring adherence to the L&#x27;Enfant plan and its historical accuracy.

The design and development of Washington, D.C. is the story of six influential men: three presidents and three visionary figures who shaped the city. George Washington, Ulysses S. Grant and Theodore Roosevelt provided crucial presidential leadership, while Pierre Charles L&#x27;Enfant, Alexander Robey Shepherd, and Frederick Law Olmsted Jr. made significant contributions to the city&#x27;s design and development.

Artist Peter Waddell painted the federal city plan in the way L&#x27;Enfant intended it to look; the painting is called &quot;The Indispensable Plan&quot;.

==Honors==
* In 1942, an American cargo-carrying Liberty ship in World War II named the S.S. &quot;Pierre L&#x27;Enfant&quot; was launched, part of a series of almost 2,000 ships mass-produced in an &quot;assembly-line&quot; fashion from eleven coastal shipyards. In 1970, she was shipwrecked and abandoned.
* L&#x27;Enfant Plaza, a complex of office buildings, was dedicated in 1968 and named for the architect. It includes the 1972 headquarters of the United States Postal Service, an adjacent L&#x27;Enfant Plaza Hotel, an office building and underground parking garage, and a series of underground corridors with a shopping center, centered around an esplanade (&#x27;L&#x27;Enfant Promenade&quot;) in southwest Washington, D.C.. Meeting rooms in the L&#x27;Enfant Plaza Hotel bear the names of French artists, military leaders, and explorers. The central portion of the plaza contains an engraved map of the city by Pierre L&#x27;Enfant from 1791. Within the city map is a smaller map that shows the plaza&#x27;s location.
* Beneath L&#x27;Enfant Plaza is one of the central Metro subway stops in Washington, D.C., the L&#x27;Enfant Plaza station.
* In 1980, Western Plaza (subsequently renamed to &quot;Freedom Plaza&quot;) opened in downtown Washington, D.C., adjacent to Pennsylvania Avenue, N.W. A raised marble inlay in the Plaza&#x27;s surface depicts parts of L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s 1791 plan for the City of Washington. The inlay contains an oval bearing the title of the plan followed by the words &quot;By Peter Charles L&#x27;Enfant&quot;.
* In 2003, L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s 1791 Plan for Washington was commemorated on a USPS commemorative postage stamp. The diamond shape of the stamp reflects the original tract of land selected for the District. Shown is a view along the National Mall, including the Capitol, the Washington Monument, and the Lincoln Memorial. Also portrayed are cherry blossoms around the &quot;Tidal Basin&quot; and row houses from the Shaw neighborhood.
* The Government of the District of Columbia commissioned a statue of L&#x27;Enfant in 2008 that now resides in the U.S. Capitol as part of the National Statuary Hall Collection as of February 2022. Federal Law only allows U.S. states (and not federal territories, commonwealths, districts or other possessions) to contribute statues to the Collection, which the District of Columbia&#x27;s Delegate to the U.S. House of Representatives, Eleanor Holmes Norton, attempted to have Congress change the law to permit the installation of the statue to represent the District in the Statuary Hall. The statue was displayed in the historic John A. Wilson District Building for the municipal government offices on Pennsylvania Avenue prior to the Capitol.
* Since 2005, the National Building Museum in Washington, D.C. has held an annual &quot;L&#x27;Enfant Lecture on City Planning and Design&quot; to draw attention to critical issues in city and regional planning in the United States.
* The American Planning Association (APA) has created an award named in &quot;L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s honor&quot; which recognizes excellence in international planning.
* In a presentation at the University of Toronto, landscape architect Kathryn Gustafson said &quot;L&#x27;Enfant&#x27;s plan was one of the most amazing urban plans in the world.&quot;

<doc id="359702" wikidata="Q1624" url="?curid=359702" title="Pasig">
<text>Pasig, officially the City of Pasig (), is a highly urbanized city in the National Capital Region of the Philippines. According to the 2020 census, it has a population of 803,159 people.

It is located along the eastern border of Metro Manila with Rizal province, the city shares its name with the Pasig River. A formerly rural settlement, Pasig is primarily residential and industrial, but has been becoming increasingly commercial in recent years, particularly after the construction of the Ortigas Center business district in its west. The city is home to the Roman Catholic Diocese of Pasig, based in Pasig Cathedral, a landmark built around the same time as the town&#x27;s foundation in 1573.

Pasig was formerly part of Rizal province before the formation of Metro Manila, the national capital region of the country. The seat of government of Rizal was hosted in Pasig at the old Rizal Provincial Capitol until a new capitol was opened in Antipolo, within Rizal&#x27;s jurisdiction in 2009. On June 19, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte signed Republic Act No. 11475, which designated Antipolo as the official capital of Rizal. However, it remained as the &quot;de jure&quot;, or official capital of the province until July 7, 2020.

==Etymology==

The city&#x27;s name, &quot;Pasig&quot;, is a Tagalog word which means, &quot;a river that flows into the sea&quot; or &quot;sandy bank of a river&quot;.

Etymologically, it is a word of Proto-Malayic (PM), &quot;*pasir&quot;, or Proto-Malayo-Polynesian (PMP) / Proto-Western-Malayo-Polynesian (PWMP) word, &quot;*pasiR&quot;. It is cognate with the 
meaning of &quot;sand&quot; in Malay () &amp; &quot;beach/sand&quot; in Acehnese (&quot;pasi&quot;) and almost similar meanings and similar spellings in other Western Malayo-Polynesian (WMP) languages.
==History==

===Early history===
There are no surviving firsthand accounts of the history of Pasig before Spanish colonizers arrived in 1573 and established the settlement, which they called the Ciudad-Municipal de Pasig.
However, surviving genealogical records and folk histories speak of a thriving precolonial barangay on the banks of the Bitukang Manok River (now nearly extinct and known as Parian Creek), which eventually became modern-day Pasig.

The creek was given the name &quot;Bitukang Manok&quot; (Tagalog for &quot;Chicken Gut&quot;) due to the serpentine shape of its waterway. Among its early dwellers were Tagalogs and people from South China with origins dating back to the Ming dynasty). The Bitukang Manok was once a principal tributary of the Marikina River. The Spanish colonizers called the creek &quot;Rio de Pasig&quot;; however, the natives still called it the Bitukang Manok.

The first stretch of the Bitukang Manok became known as the &quot;Pariancillo&quot; (Estero de San Agustin), where its shoreline was once settled by ethnic Chinese and Malay merchants to trade their goods with Tagalogs until it developed up to the 1970s as the city&#x27;s main public market. Likewise, the creek contributed enormously to the economic growth of Pasig during the Spanish colonial era (1565–1898) through irrigation of its wide paddy fields, and by being the progressive center of barter trade.

The Bitukang Manok, also known as the &quot;Parian Creek,&quot; had once linked the Marikina River with the Antipolo. Before the Manggahan Floodway was built in 1986, The Parian Creek was connected to the Sapang Bato-Buli Creek (which serves as the boundary between Pasig&#x27;s barangays Dela Paz-Manggahan-Rosario-Santa Lucia and the Municipality of Cainta), the Kasibulan Creek (situated at Vista Verde, Barangay San Isidro, Cainta), the Palanas Creek (leaving Antipolo through Barangay Muntindilao), the Bulaw Creek (on Barangay Mambungan, besides the Valley Golf and Country Club), and the Hinulugang Taktak falls of Barangay Dela Paz (fed by the Taktak Creek passing close to the Antipolo Town Square), thus being the detached and long-abandoned Antipolo River.

===Spanish colonial era===
Since the early 1600s up to the period of Japanese Imperialism, over a thousand Catholic devotees coming from &quot;Maynilad&quot; (Manila), &quot;Hacienda Pineda&quot; (Pasay), &quot;San Juan del Monte&quot;, &quot;Hacienda de Mandaloyon&quot; (Mandaluyong), &quot;Hacienda Mariquina&quot; (Marikina), &quot;Barrio Pateros&quot;, &quot;Pueblo de Tagig&quot; (Taguig), and &quot;San Pedro de Macati&quot; (Makati), followed the trail of the Parian Creek to the Pilgrimage Cathedral on the mountainous pueblo of Antipolo, Morong (the present-day Rizal province).

The Antipoleños and several locals from the far-reached barrios of &quot;Poblacion de San Mateo&quot;, &quot;Montalban&quot; (Rodriguez), &quot;Monte de Tanhai&quot; (Tanay), &quot;Santa Rosa-Oroquieta&quot; (Teresa), and &quot;Punta Ibayo&quot; (Baras), had also navigated this freshwater creek once to go down to the vast &quot;Kapatagan&quot; (Rice plains) of lowland Pasig. Even the marian processions of the Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage passed this route back and forth eleven times.

In the 1600s, Fr. Joaqin Martinez de Zuñiga, conducted a census of Pasig City based on tributes and each tribute representing an average family of 5 to 7, and found that it totalled 3000 tributes, half of which were Indios (Native Filipinos) and the other half were Sangleys (Chinese Filipinos) These tributes were policed by a company of Mexican soldiers under command by a handful of Spanish, patrolling the Pasig river from nearby Fort Santiago which has the Pasig river snake through it. The years: 1636, 1654, 1670, and 1672; saw the deployment of 22, 50, 86, and 81 of these Latin-American soldiers from Mexico at Fort Santiago patrolling along the Pasig. Some of these Mexicans, after being discharged from their duties, had settled in Pasig and other nearby areas. So that they would be close to the Mexico-made image of Our Lady of Peace and Good Voyage in nearby Antipolo. Indian Filipinos (from India) that had later settled in nearby Cainta, Rizal also visit Pasig on their way to the capital.

The creek has been also used during the British Occupation of Manila in 1762 to 1764 by the Royal British army, under the leadership of General William Draper and Vice Admiral Sir Samuel Cornish, 1st Baronet, to transport their red troops (and also the Sepoys they&#x27;ve brought from East India) upstream to take over the nearby forest-surrounded villages of Cainta and Taytay. They even did an ambush at the &quot;Plaza Central&quot; in front of the Pasig Cathedral, and turned the Roman Catholic Parish into their military headquarters, with the church&#x27;s fortress-like &quot;Campanilla&quot; (belfry) serving as a watchtower against Spanish defenders sailing from the walled city of Intramuros via the Pasig River.

The Sepoys backstabbed their abusive British lieutenants and sided with the combined forces of the Spanish Conquistadors (assigned by the Governor-General Simon de Anda y Salazar), local rice farmers, fisherfolk, and even Chinese traders. After the British Invasion, the Sepoys remained and intermarried with Filipina women, and that explains the Hindu features of some of today&#x27;s citizens of Pasig, especially Cainta and Taytay.

In 1742, an Augustinian friar named Fray Domingo Diaz, together with a group of wealthy &quot;Mestizos de Sangley&quot; (Chinese Mestizos) from Sagad, ordered a construction of a marble, roof-tiled cover bridge across the creek in the style of an oriental pagoda. It was named &quot;Puente del Pariancillo&quot;, and a few years later, it changed to &quot;Puente de Fray Felix Trillo&quot;, dedicated to the dynamic parochial curate of the Immaculate Conception Parish. Edmund Roberts visited Pasig in 1832.

On the night of May 2, 1896, more than 300 revolutionary Katipuneros, led by the Supremo Gat. Andres Bonifacio, Emilio Jacinto and Pio Valenzuela, secretly gained access in this very creek aboard a fleet of seventeen &quot;Bangkas&quot; (canoes) to the old residence of a notable Valentin Cruz at Barangay San Nicolas, and formed the &quot;Asamblea Magna&quot; (mass meeting).

Three months later on Saturday evening, August 29, about less than 2,000 working-class Pasigueños (along with a hundred Chinese &quot;Trabajadores&quot; (laborers) from the failed Sangley revolts of 1639 and throughout the 17th century), armed with coconuts, machetes and bayoneted muskets (some were donated by the rich Ilustrado families, while many of those guns were looted from Spanish authorities), joined the Katipunan and made a surprise attack at the &quot;Municipio del Gobernadorcillo&quot; (the current site of the Pasig City Hall) and its adjacent garrison of the &quot;Guardias Civil&quot; (Civil Guard), situated near the border of barangays Maybunga and Caniogan.

That was the first and victorious rebellion ever accomplished by the Katipunan, and that particular event was popularly known as the &quot;Nagsabado sa Pasig&quot; (the Saturday Uprising on Pasig). After they had managed to successfully out-thrown the seat of Spanish government on Pasig, the Katipuneros fled immediately and advanced towards a &quot;Sitio&quot; located at the neighboring &quot;Ciudad de San Juan&quot; called &quot;Pinaglabanan&quot;, and there they launched their second attempt to end the numerous cases of corruption made by the greedy Castilian &quot;Encomenderos&quot; (town officials) and &quot;Hacienderos&quot; (landlords), which shall be commemorated as the Battle of San Juan del Monte.

===American invasion era===

On June 11, 1901, during the Philippine–American War, the province of Rizal was created through Act No. 137 of the Philippine Commission. Pasig was incorporated into the province of Rizal, and was designated as the capital of the new province.

In 1939, the barrio or sitio of Ogong (Ugong Norte), which includes the present-day Libis area, was separated from Pasig to form part of the newly established Quezon City.

===Japanese occupation era===
After World War II, the Bitukang Manok was slowly exposing its ecological downfall. It resulted in water pollution due to rational ignorance. The worst came to the Bitukang Manok in the late 1960s when the disappearing waterway, instead of being revived was totally separated from the Marikina River, and was converted into an open sewage ditch, with its original flow now moving in reverse towards the direction of the Napindan Channel (a portion of the Pasig River bordering between the barangays Kalawaan-Pinagbuhatan and Taguig), to give way to public commercial facilities.

===Philippine independence===
====The Martial Law era ====

Pasig was home to a number of prominent human rights advocates who became prominent during the administration of Ferdinand Marcos from 1965 to 1986. One of these advocates was lawyer and publisher Augusto &quot;Bobbit&quot; Sanchez, whose publication &quot;The Weekly Post&quot; was so uncompromising in its coverage that Pasig politicians came to refer to it as the &quot;Weekly Pest.&quot; Another human rights advocate who was an early critic of Marcos&#x27; policies was opposition figure and Liberal Party member Jovito Salonga, a Pasig native who was elected representative of Rizal&#x27;s second district in 1961.

When Ferdinand Marcos&#x27; economic policy of using foreign loans to fund government projects during his second term resulted in economic crises at the beginning of the 1970s, numerous Pasigueños participated in the various protests of the time, which eventually came to be known as the First Quarter Storm. This included brothers Eman Lacaba and Pete Lacaba, who lived in nearby Pateros but studied at the Pasig Catholic College (PCC) where their mother was a teacher.

When Marcos suspended the writ of habeas corpus in 1971 and eventually declared Martial Law in September 1972, students were unable to congregate. In Pasig, one of the prominent residences that sheltered them and allowed them to meet together was the Bahay Na Tisa in Barangay San Jose. Because the house was also the venue of meetings of prominent Pasig leaders who were pro-Marcos, it came to be known as Pasig&#x27;s &quot;Freedom House.&quot; The house has since been declared an Important Cultural Property by the Philippines&#x27; National Museum.

Another prominent site in Pasig which was affected by Martial Law was the Benpres Building, which was shuttered by the Philippine Constabulary when Marcos&#x27; declaration closed down all media outlets on September 23, 1972.

After the fall of the dictatorship, one of the first properties to be surrendered by a Marcos crony to the PCGG was the &quot;Payanig sa Pasig&quot; property, at the confluence of Ortigas, Meralco and Doña Julia Vargas Avenues, whose title businessman Jose Yao Campos said he was keeping under the name of the Mid-Pasig Land Development Corp (MPLDC) in lieu of Ferdinand Marcos. This was eventually sequestered by the Presidential Commission on Good Government as part of the Unexplained wealth of the Marcos family.

====Integration into Metro Manila====

On November 7, 1975, Pasig was carved out of Rizal province and became part of Metro Manila when the Metro Manila Commission (precursor of Metro Manila Authority and later Metropolitan Manila Development Authority) was created through Presidential Decree 824.

===Cityhood===

In July 1994, Pasig was converted into a highly urbanized city through Republic Act 7829. And in December 1994, President Fidel V. Ramos signed it into law, which was ratified through a plebiscite on January 21, 1995.

===Contemporary===
On February 4, 2006, the ULTRA Stampede, in which 71 people died, happened during the first anniversary celebration of ABS-CBN&#x27;s noontime show &quot;Wowowee&quot;, because of the prizes that were to be given away. The anniversary of the show would be held on PhilSports Arena but the event has been already cancelled due to the tragedy.

Pasig was one of the areas struck by the high flood created by Typhoon Ondoy (Ketsana) on September 26, 2009, which affected the Ortigas Avenue and the east city side of the Manggahan Floodway. It is the most destructive flood in Philippine history. Pasig is accessed by the Pasig River, wherein the waters of Marikina River channeled and the Manggahan Floodway routed to Laguna de Bay.

In the first week of August 2012, intense monsoon rain caused the 2012 Philippines flooding, which affected again Pasig and particularly the National Capital Region (NCR), Calabarzon and the southwest part of Luzon. The nonstop eight-day monsoon rain, strengthened by Typhoon Gener, caused the Marikina River to overflow and destroyed the same places that were ruined by Typhoon Ondoy in 2009.

On June 19, 2020, President Rodrigo Duterte signed into law Republic Act No. 11475, officially transferring the capital of the Rizal province from Pasig to Antipolo. The law took effect on July 7, 2020, almost 45 years since Pasig became part of Metro Manila and around 11 years since the Rizal provincial government moved to the latter city.
==Geography==
Pasig is bordered on the west by Quezon City and Mandaluyong; to the north by Marikina; to the south by Pateros and Taguig; and to the east by the municipalities of Cainta and Taytay in the province of Rizal. Pasig was also bounded by Makati to the southwest until 2023 when the Barangays Cembo, West Rembo, and East Rembo became part of Taguig.

The Pasig River runs through it and forms its southwestern and southeastern borders with Taguig, while the Marikina River forms its western border with Quezon City. The artificial Manggahan Floodway, built in 1986, begins at its confluence with the Marikina River in its northeast.

===Barangays===
Pasig is politically subdivided into 30 barangays.
Its barangays are grouped into two districts for city council representation purposes. The first district encompasses the southern and western sections of the city, while the second district encompasses the northern and eastern sections. Among these barangays, 27 are located on the northern side or right bank of the Pasig River while 3 (Buting, San Joaquin and Kalawaan) are located on the river&#x27;s southern side or left bank.

===Climate===
The dry season runs through the months of November to April, while the wet season starts in May and lasts to November. The wet season reaches its peak in the month of August. Maximum rainfall in usually occurs from the month of June to September. The average annual of rainfall is with a peak of in July and a low in April. The highest temperature occurs during the month of April and May () while the lowest occurs during the months of January &amp; February ().

The Philippines, due to its geographical location, is one of the Asian countries often affected by typhoons. It is located within the so-called &quot;typhoon belt&quot;. Generally, typhoon season starts from June and ends in November. However, the rest of the months are not entirely free of the typhoons since they are unpredictable in nature and might enter the country anytime of the year.

==Demographics==
Population growth of Pasig has consistently been higher than the regional average. Thus, the percentage share of Pasig in the total population of Metro Manila has significantly increased. Its share has grown from less than 3% in 1960 to 4.5% in 1980 and then to almost 6% in 2015. Pasig&#x27;s population is projected to reach one million between the 2025 and 2030 census years.

===Religion===
The Roman Catholic Diocese of Pasig was established in 2003 by Pope John Paul II as the diocese of the Catholic Church in the Philippines, with the Immaculate Conception Parish (Pasig Cathedral) as the seat.

Pasig is the headquarters of the Presbyterian Church of the Philippines.
==Economy==
===19th century===
Historically, Pasig produced rice, fruit and sugarcane as an agricultural town.

===Today===
The western part of the city is where most of Pasig&#x27;s financial resources are primarily concentrated. It includes numerous factories, warehouses, establishments and commercial facilities. They are primarily situated in Ortigas Center, Pasig proper and along E. Rodriguez Jr. Avenue (C-5) and Ortigas Avenue (R-5 Road). Real estate and commercial developments along Mercedes Avenue and other areas near the city center are developing. The eastern part was mostly dominated by residential areas but numerous commercial establishments are now being developed along Marcos Highway. In the arguably more significant western part of Pasig, east of the city of Mandaluyong and part of the barangay of San Antonio, lies the Ortigas Center.

Ortigas Center is one of the top business districts in the country. Numerous high-rise office buildings, residential condominiums, commercial establishments, schools and malls are situated here. The University of Asia and the Pacific is also located here. The head office of the Integrated Bar of the Philippines was established in the district. The former headquarters of the Philippine Stock Exchange is located along ADB Avenue. San Miguel Corporation, owner of one of the largest producers of beer in Asia, also has its headquarters in the district along San Miguel Avenue. Situated along Ortigas Avenue is Crowne Plaza, a five-star hotel near Robinsons Galleria. Adjacent to Ortigas Center is Capitol Commons, a mixed-use development that was built on the old site of the second Rizal Provincial Capitol.

Notable developments along E. Rodriguez Jr. Avenue (C-5) include Arcovia City, The Grove by Rockwell, and Ortigas East (formerly Frontera Verde), home of the Tiendesitas market. El-Pueblo, a colonial-themed commercial complex in Ortigas Center, provides new concept of cafes, restaurants and bars. Metrowalk (formerly Payanig), a commercial hub along Ortigas Avenue and Meralco Avenue, was established in 2005 and comprises shops, depot warehouses, stalls, restaurants and bars. Bridgetowne Destination Estates, a integrated township development of Robinsons Land, has its Victor Monument and bridge connecting Pasig and Quezon City. Parklinks, a urban estate, is partly built in Pasig near C-5. 

==Government==
===Local government===

Pasig is governed primarily by the city mayor, the vice mayor, and the city councilors. The mayor acts as the chief executive of the city, while the city councilors act as its legislative body. The vice mayor, besides taking on mayoral responsibilities in case of a temporary vacancy, acts as the presiding officer of the city legislature. The two city districts have six elected councilors each. 

The incumbent mayor is Vico Sotto, while the incumbent vice mayor is Robert Jaworski Jr.

Its centerpiece is the PhilSports Arena, formerly known as the ULTRA, which hosted games for the Philippine Basketball Association and East Asia Super League among other leagues.

The tentatively-named &quot;Home of the UAAP&quot; in Bridgetowne, a partnership between the University Athletic Association of the Philippines and Akari Lighting &amp; Technology Corp., will begin construction in 2025 and open in 2027. Other venues in the city include the Ynares Sports Arena as well as the Pasig Sports Center.

As of 2024, the city isn&#x27;t home to any professional sports teams. The last team to represent the city was Pasig City MCW Sports of the Maharlika Pilipinas Basketball League, who last played in the MPBL in the 2023 season.

===Railway===
This city is also served by Santolan and Marikina–Pasig Stations of LRT Line 2, albeit being located within the city of Marikina, located along Marcos Highway near the Pasig–Marikina boundary. The line&#x27;s depot is located in Barangay Santolan, Pasig. The city will also be served by the Metro Manila Subway, which is currently under construction, and MRT Line 4, which has been approved. The Metro Manila Subway will have two stations in Ortigas Center, namely: Ortigas North and Ortigas South.

Long before the Manila Light Rail Transit System finally opened its services in the early 2000s, steam train services had once served Pasig in the past, even before World War II.

In Marikina, there is a street named &quot;Daangbakal&quot;, also called by the names of &quot;Shoe Avenue Extension&quot;, &quot;Munding Avenue&quot; and &quot;Bagong Silang&quot;. There is also a similar &quot;Daangbakal&quot; in the San Mateo and Montalban (Rodriguez) areas, and on the maps one can notice that the two roads should have been connected with each other. In fact, as the name suggests in Tagalog, these streets were once a single railway line. The two sides of the &quot;Daangbakal&quot; roads were once connected by a bridge in the San Mateo-Marikina border. However, as the railroad tracks have been largely ignored after the Japanese occupation and was transformed into separate roads, the railway connection was abandoned.

The old railroad tracks, called the Montalban Branch, was connected from Tutuban station in Manila, passing through Tramo (Barangay Rosario, Pasig) coming all the way to the town of Marikina up to Montalban. On the northern end of the &quot;Daangbakal&quot; road in Montablan is a basketball court. That basketball court which stands today, surrounded by the Montalban Catholic Church and Cemetery, was once the railway station terminus of that particular line.

The present-day Santo Niño Elementary School in Marikina was said to be a train depot. And also it was said that a railroad station once stood in the Marikina City Sports Park.

The Montalban Line was completed in 1906, and continued its operation until 1936. It was said that the Imperial Japanese Army made use of this railway line during the Second World War. These railways were dismantled during the 1960s and were converted into ordinary roads.

Today, the citizens are dependent on tricycles, jeepneys, taxis, UV Express, buses, and AUV&#x27;s which contribute to the everyday unusual and unbearable traffic of Metro Manila. Even now, there is uncertainty in the Northrail project, which links Manila to the northern provinces of Luzon, because of corruption within the project&#x27;s construction.

Aside from the Montalban Line, another railway branch in the Antipolo Line had existed in the city before it was permanently removed. It traversed from Santa Mesa to Antipolo. There is also a street named &quot;Daangbakal&quot; in Antipolo, where like the &quot;Daangbakal&quot; roads on Marikina and San Mateo, a railway line once existed. Its operation ceased in 1917.

It is established in 1983 to serve and meet the industry&#x27;s demand for middle-level technical manpower.

<text>Xplay (previously GameSpot TV, Extended Play, and X-Play) was a television program about video games. The program, known for its reviews and comedy skits, aired on G4 in the United States and has aired on &quot;G4 Canada&quot; in Canada (and briefly on YTV during its time as GameSpot TV), FUEL TV in Australia, Ego in Israel, GXT in Italy, MTV Russia &amp; Rambler TV in Russia, NET 25 (GameSpot TV to Extended Play only) &amp; Solar Sports in the Philippines, and Adult Swim and MuchMusic in Latin America.

The show in its previous incarnation was hosted by Morgan Webb and Blair Herter, with Kristin Adams (née Holt) and Jessica Chobot serving as special correspondents/co-hosts (Tiffany Smith, Alex Sim-Wise and Joel Gourdin have also served as correspondents during the show&#x27;s run). Adam Sessler was the original host of the program; he previously co-hosted with Lauren Fielder and Kate Botello.

&quot;Xplay&quot; began on ZDTV in 1998 as &quot;GameSpot TV&quot;, where Sessler co-hosted with Fielder for the show&#x27;s first year, then co-hosted with Botello up through 2002 (the producers of ZDTV originally had plans to air a video-game program when the channel launched called &quot;Extended Play&quot; that would be hosted by Simon Rex; however, when an agreement was reached with the makers of the newly created &quot;GameSpot&quot; website, plans for the original show&#x27;s format were scrapped in favor of a &quot;GameSpot&quot;-branded program, and Rex was dropped as host).

The show assumed the previously rejected &quot;Extended Play&quot; moniker in 2001 after ZDTV changed to TechTV and the partnership with Ziff Davis&#x27; GameSpot ended. Botello left in early 2002, and Sessler hosted the show by himself up until April 2003, when Webb joined the cast and the show was renamed &quot;X-Play&quot;.

A new incarnation of the show was featured on the revived G4 network which operated from November 2021 to October 2022.

==History==
&quot;GameSpot TV&quot;, &quot;Extended Play&quot;, and &quot;X-Play&quot; all originated in San Francisco, California. Throughout the course of the show&#x27;s history, it has gone through numerous changes, in more than just name.

===&quot;GameSpot TV&quot;===
In the days of &quot;GameSpot TV&quot;, the show was filmed on a simple ZDTV studio set consisting of faux-brick walls, randomly positioned TV monitors, and functioning &quot;Gauntlet Legends&quot; and &quot;Rival Schools&quot; arcade game cabinets. For the occasional special episode, filming would move off-site to another location, such as the Sony Metreon arcade, and numerous game conventions such as the Classic Gaming Expo and E3. Each episode would start off with &quot;Game News&quot;, where Sessler or Fielder would give a brief overview of top news stories featured on the GameSpot website. Game reviews were run in a segment known as &quot;The Grill&quot; (games were graded on GameSpot&#x27;s official 0.1-10.0 system), &quot;Spotlight&quot; showcased special content such as interviews with industry leaders, and &quot;Game Breakers&quot; featured strategy guides and hints for recently released games. New episodes would debut on weekend mornings at 10:00 a.m. EST.

Following the Columbine High School massacre on April 20, 1999, the network forbade the show from depicting gunplay in video games, which limited coverage of certain titles such as &quot;Grand Theft Auto III&quot;. Kate Botello became Sessler&#x27;s new co-host on April 29, 2000, and towards the end, the 10-point grading system was changed to a 5-point system.

===&quot;Extended Play&quot;===
When &quot;GameSpot TV&quot; converted to &quot;Extended Play&quot; on February 17, 2001, the show moved entirely to the Metreon, and took on a very simple style and format. Filming consisted of co-hosts Sessler and Botello and a small single camera crew; the show featured strictly game reviews and game hints. New episodes debuted once a week at 9:00 p.m. EST. Like &quot;GameSpot TV&quot;, certain special episodes would be filmed elsewhere. In August 2002, the series became a daily program with a mix of repeats and first-run episodes airing Monday-Friday at 4:00 p.m. EST, with Friday episodes remaining in the 9:00 p.m. timeslot. After the departure of Botello on March 29, 2002, Sessler continued to host at the Metreon by himself, until the change to &quot;X-Play&quot; in April 2003.

===&quot;X-Play&quot; San Francisco===
When &quot;X-Play&quot; debuted on April 28, 2003, the show moved back to the TechTV studios, and Morgan Webb came on board as co-host, leaving her previous hosting duties on TechTV&#x27;s &quot;The Screen Savers&quot; and &quot;Call for Help&quot;. &quot;X-Play&quot; had a larger scale than that of &quot;Extended Play&quot;, but it still maintained an extremely simple and spartan style. Filming was done in TechTV&#x27;s Studio A, home to the sets of &quot;Call For Help&quot;, &quot;Fresh Gear&quot;, and &quot;TechLive&quot;. The filming setup was increased to three cameras; a main floor camera, a Jibcam for high angle shots, and a black-and-white handheld DV camera, which would be cut to suddenly and intermittently throughout episodes.

&quot;X-Play&#x27;s&quot; primary set consisted of a single couch, coffee table and television (with working game consoles) positioned in the middle of the large studio floor. However, hosts Sessler and Webb would migrate around various areas of the studio, normally not even going to their actual set until the end of the program. Each episode would typically conclude with Sessler and Webb playing one of the consoles on the TV. The show&#x27;s format consisted primarily of game reviews and previews (with some previews being conducted as live in-studio demos by Morgan and Adam), with an occasional game-related sketch thrown in for comedic value.

The &quot;Disembodied Voice&quot; was also introduced to the show at this phase in its history. This unseen announcer would begin each episode with an often over-the-top introduction to which the hosts usually responded or commented (these comments varied widely, ranging from total non-sequiturs to Gilbert and Sullivan references to , along with viewer-submitted intros taken from the show&#x27;s web forums).

&quot;X-Play&quot; aired at a later time slot than its predecessors and featured more risque language and subject matter; the previous restriction on gunplay was also lifted. X-Play aired four brand new episodes for their first two weeks, but would ultimately air three new episodes a week for the majority of the show&#x27;s remainder on TechTV. Many of the episodes created during this time period aired on the &quot;G4 Rewind&quot; block of retro programming in 2008; the first episode would end up being the last show on the channel itself before it officially shut down on December 31, 2014.

===&quot;X-Play&quot; Los Angeles===
Comcast purchased TechTV in May 2004 and merged it with its gaming channel, G4, necessitating a move for &quot;X-Play&quot;″s base of operations from San Francisco to G4&#x27;s Santa Monica studios. X-Play continued production at the TechTV studios in San Francisco until August 2004. The final episode to be produced in San Francisco aired on August 24, 2004.

The first episode of X-Play to be filmed at the Los Angeles set aired on September 13, 2004. The new set designed for the show resembled a lounge—or rumpus room—where the hosts could sit around while discussing their latest reviews (during the 400th episode, which originally aired on May 8, 2006, all chairs were removed from the set so that Adam and Morgan had to stand throughout the duration of each episode).

While originally maintaining its late-night time slot, new episodes were eventually moved to 4:00 p.m. EST in the afternoons (usually airing on Mondays, Tuesdays, and Wednesdays) starting on April 10, 2006. This changed to 3:00 p.m. EST on September 5, 2006, before &quot;X-Play&quot; returned to prime-time on November 6 of the same year, to an 8:00 p.m. EST timeslot.

On March 4, 2007, it was announced that the G4 Studios in Santa Monica would close on April 15. Production of G4 programs was relocated to the Studios of the E! Television Network situated elsewhere in the Los Angeles area. As a consequence, new sets had to be designed for &quot;X-Play&quot;, and many G4 employees involved in production were laid off.

The E! Building&#x27;s set was smaller than the Santa Monica studio, thus some aspects of the studio had to be shrunk down. The &quot;X-Play&quot; logo was retro-fitted to sit above the stage on the right-hand side of the set, with curtains surrounding the entirety of the space to create a sense of intimacy; a large flat-screen monitor was also placed in the background, and several small decorative glass balls were strategically placed around various spots on the floor (Adam and Morgan would often joke of their fear that they would trip over one of these balls and hurt themselves). During video-game analysis and viewer mail segments, Sessler and Webb would sit in orange recliner chairs as they debated over the issue at hand.

===&quot;X-Play&quot; Expands===
On January 14, 2008, G4 commenced with a complete overhaul to the show&#x27;s entire format, branding the move as &quot;X-Play&quot; &quot;jumping to the next level&quot;.

Both Adam and Morgan have stated that this new format represents &quot;the type of show that they&#x27;ve always wanted &quot;X-Play&quot; to be&quot;, whereby a strict focus on game reviews was replaced with a broader range of topics relating to the video-game field (including more in-depth gaming news, first looks at game demos, and game cheat-codes/strategies with Kristin Adams twice a week).

The set was once again refurbished to coincide with the change, as the studio now has blue-tinged walls covered with several flat-screen monitors, and a giant orange &quot;X-Play&quot; logo (also newly redesigned for the relaunch) covering the floor. In addition, G4 took advantage of the new set and show format by expanding &quot;X-Play&#x27;s&quot; schedule in order to air new episodes five days a week.

However, economic factors forced G4 to contract &quot;X-Play&#x27;s&quot; schedule back down to only three original episodes per week, starting on March 2, 2009; in addition, the show&#x27;s timeslot was moved out of prime-time to 6:30 p.m. EST (although reruns still air at 8 o&#x27;clock) and a number of &quot;X-Play&quot; staff members were laid off.

===&quot;X-Play XL&quot;===
In December 2008, the show aired &quot;X-Large&quot; one-hour episodes every Tuesday, Thursday, and Friday. According to G4 television president Neil Tiles, this was an experimental change with the possibility of having all episodes run 60 minutes long sometime in the future where new segments were incorporated to see if &quot;X-Play&quot; could &quot;go deeper than the current half hour show allows.&quot; Tiles also stated that the writers will be looking to add &quot;more comedy&quot; back into the program &quot;as requested.&quot;

===1,000th episode===
On February 1, 2010, &quot;X-Play&quot; aired its 1,000th episode. To commemorate this milestone, G4 aired a six-hour marathon containing favorite episodes of the series, leading up to the premiere of the actual new episode.

===Changes in 2012===
In April 2012, it was announced that Sessler would no longer be part of G4. Blair Herter, previously a co-host on &quot;X-Play,&quot; would become the new co-host of the series. The &quot;X-Play&quot; set was once again redesigned, and debuted on the June 18, 2012 episode. The new set featured giant white-tinged flatscreen monitors (displaying two large orange-and-black &quot;X&quot; logos) positioned behind the hosts, as well as the addition of a studio audience (making the presentation of the program similar to that of &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot;). Also, there is an area of the studio with two large reclining chairs and a glass table, used as a place to interview featured guests (such as Mark Lamia from Treyarch and Ted Price from Insomniac Games).

===Original series finale===
On October 26, 2012, it was reported that the show (along with &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot;) would cease production after 2012. The hour-long finale of the original iteration of &quot;X-Play&quot; aired on January 23, 2013. During the broadcast, the hosts announced that the network would be auctioning off &quot;X-Play&quot; memorabilia via eBay (the set was even designed to resemble a telethon, with several people—Drunk Link, Canadian Guy, Superman, a pair of Imperial Stormtroopers—manning phones), and that all proceeds from the winning bids would be donated to Child&#x27;s Play. The three items auctioned off were a seven-foot Dovahkiin statue, a signed copy of the script for the final episode, and a &quot;Halo 4&quot; Limited Edition Xbox 360 console bundle signed by the &quot;X-Play&quot; staff.

After a montage of scenes from the show&#x27;s history to close out the broadcast (with the tagline &quot;A show on television, April 2003 - January 2013&quot;), the remaining cast and crew thanked the viewers, as well as the developers for making the games that made the show possible (&quot;even Koei, because ... taking a dump on &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot; filled up a lotta time&quot;). The closing credits then ran in the style of a 1980s-era video game, with an 8-bit version of the logo and the phrase &quot;CONGRATULATIONS!!! You have completed X-Play&quot; written in an 8-bit font and set to chiptune music. Once the credits were complete, the words &quot;GAME OVER&quot; appeared on screen along with an Xbox Live &quot;Achievement Unlocked: 100G - Mission Complete&quot; badge, with the G4 Media copyright box shown in the bottom left corner.

When G4 ceased broadcasting on December 31, 2014, the last program broadcast at 11:30pm EST was the first episode of &quot;X-Play&quot;.

Webb and Sessler reunited for Bethesda Softworks&#x27; press conference at E3 in 2016.

=== Revival ===
On July 24, 2020, G4 announced a revival of the network set for a 2021 launch. Later on November 24, 2020, G4 released &quot;A Very Special G4 Reunion Special&quot;, which featured former X-Play hosts Adam Sessler, Morgan Webb, and Blair Herter (who is one of the key people behind the re-launch), as well as correspondent Kristin Adams. On January 28, 2021, G4 announced that &quot;X-Play&quot; (alongside &quot;Attack of the Show!&quot;) would return with it. On February 12, 2021, G4 announced that Adam Sessler would return to host. The revival premiered on November 19, 2021, broadcast live on G4&#x27;s Twitch and YouTube channels. Unlike the previous iteration, the episodes were two hours long (they were later cut down to 30-minute episodes on G4&#x27;s cable channel). Sessler, Froskurinn, The Completionist and The Black Hokage co-hosted the revival; Sessler mainly co-hosted the show remotely from his San Francisco home while the others were based at G4’s studio in Los Angeles. Froskurinn was let go after G4 bought out the remainder of her contract in September 2022.

The show was canceled in October 2022 when it was announced that month that G4 would shut down for the second time, with its final episode airing on October 20.

==Reviews==
There have been over 2,705 games reviewed on &quot;X-Play&quot;; for most of the show&#x27;s run, reviews were designated by a five-point rating scale, based on such factors as graphics, sound, gameplay, and &quot;playability&quot; (i.e. replay value).

===Original ratings scale===
On &quot;X-Play&#x27;s&quot; original TechTV homepage, the ratings system was broken down in the following way:
The first game to receive a perfect &quot;5 out of 5&quot; rating was &quot;Tom Clancy&#x27;s Splinter Cell&quot; during the November 20th (2002) episode, while the first game to receive a &quot;1 out of 5&quot; rating was Infogrames&#x27; 2003 racer &quot;Humvee Assault&quot;, during the May 29th (2003) episode.

===2007 ratings primer===
In a 2007 episode billed as a &quot;primer on our scoring system&quot;, Adam and Morgan further elaborated on their ratings scale:
* A score of 1 is a game that &quot;has to produce true crappiness, [through] the full cooperation of an entire development team - level designers taking off early to attend their children&#x27;s soccer games, animators getting so high during their lunchbreak that they can&#x27;t operate their mouse, and of course money hungry execs who will release anything if they can dupe kids into begging their moms for it.&quot;
:&quot;Example Given: 50 Cent: Bulletproof&quot;
* A score of 2 &quot;is such a difficult score to give, because it requires a game that fundamentally fails, but has a barely redeeming charm which makes it untenable to give a 1; it&#x27;s that &quot;Suddenly Susan&quot; cocktail of technical competence floated atop a pile of dreck.&quot;
:&quot;Example Given: &quot;
* There are different levels to a score of 3 - &quot;there&#x27;s the 3 that&#x27;s a mix of very good and very bad elements (like &quot;Blood Will Tell&quot;) or 3&#x27;s that have a great concept that&#x27;s poorly executed (like &quot;Railroads!&quot;), and then there&#x27;s those 3&#x27;s that are just churned out because they know people will buy them even though there&#x27;s nothing original in it (like every FIFA game ever).&quot;
:&quot;Example Given: Sid Meier&#x27;s Railroads!&quot;
* &quot;There are really two kinds of games that get 4&#x27;s regularly: these are great games with significant problems (like &quot;Dead Rising&quot;) and games that are amazing but just aren&#x27;t suited for everyone (the &quot;Warhammer: Dark Crusade&quot; expansion or any of the &quot;Sims&quot; expansions are good examples).&quot;
:&quot;Example Given: Dead Rising&quot;
* Titles that earn a perfect 5 out of 5 are &quot;those magnificent games which, whatever minor flaws they may have, call out to us and say, &#x27;Buy me, you must buy me&#x27; ... &quot;
:&quot;Example Given: Ōkami&quot;

During this episode, the hosts also explained why they use a 5-point ratings system, rather than a 10- or even 100-point scale:

===2011 ratings primer===
On the January 24, 2011 episode, Adam and Morgan gave an updated ratings primer in response to confusion spawned by aggregator review sites like Metacritic. To that end, the &quot;X-Play&quot; review scale was broken down in the following manner:

1 out of 5
* Broken controls
* Amateurish design
* Less fun than a menu screen
* Mainly shoddy licensed games (&quot;Clash of the Titans&quot;) and shovelware (&quot;Tournament of Legends&quot;)

2 out of 5
* Some fun to be had
* Serious flaws in gameplay
* Rental at best
* Examples given were &quot;Quantum Theory&quot; and &quot;&quot;

3 out of 5
* Not bad, not great (average)
* Technically competent
* Often lacking in ambition
* Mainly rushed sequels (&quot;Front Mission Evolved&quot;) and functional licensed games (&quot;James Bond 007: Blood Stone&quot;)

4 out of 5
* Good game with good ideas
* Accomplishes most goals
* Minor flaws hurt playability
* Games that might not be for everyone (&quot;Heavy Rain&quot;)

5 out of 5
* Outstanding, genre-defining title
* Realizes all ambitions of its design
* Renews your faith in gaming
* Examples given were &quot;Red Dead Redemption&quot; and &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot;

===Introduction of the half star===
During the 2012 season premiere (January 17), the &quot;half star&quot; was introduced to the &quot;X-Play&quot; ratings system, with the hosts explaining that they felt a change towards a &quot;more granular ratings scale will help distinguish the great games from the really great games from the really really great games.&quot; They also believed that over the years it had gotten &quot;a little too easy to score the coveted 5 out of 5,&quot; and that the change will make such an accomplishment &quot;more of a rarity&quot;; it also means that the lowest score a game can achieve is now a &quot;point-5 out of 5.&quot;

In addition, the review scale was again broken down to make the show&#x27;s criteria clear to the viewing audience:

5 stars
* Exceptional game
* A true must-play
* Example Given: &quot;Gears of War 3&quot;

4 stars
* Great game with minor issues
* Lacks that &quot;certain something&quot;
* Example Given: &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Skyward Sword&quot;

3 stars
* Decent game
* Nothing special, nothing awful
* Example Given: &quot;Dead Island&quot;

2 stars
* Severely flawed
* Not recommended
* Example Given: &quot;The Lord of the Rings: War in the North&quot;

1 star
* Truly awful
* No redeeming qualities
* Example Given: &quot;&quot;

The hosts concluded this explanation with the following caveat:

The first game to receive a half-star in its rating was &quot;Kingdoms of Amalur: Reckoning&quot; (two and a half stars) during the February 13th (2012) episode.

The first game to receive the lowest possible rating was &quot;Steel Battalion: Heavy Armor&quot; (0.5 stars) during the July 2nd (2012) episode.

During the April 8 (2013) edition of &quot;Sessler&#x27;s ... Something&quot;, Adam (then an employee of Revision3) implied that the introduction of the half-star rating was actually pushed through by G4 executives without his knowledge; he stated that he &quot;came back in 2013 to find out that we had moved to a half-star system as well, [and] it was all at the behest of one very very large publisher who said that [the show] wouldn&#x27;t be taken seriously unless we were listed on Metacritic.&quot;

===2021 relaunch===
With the relaunch of the show, the rating system has been simplified back down to its original &quot;out of 5&quot; format. In opting to get rid of half points, Adam Sessler stated that half points &quot;are for cowards&quot; and that &quot;score[s] are not reviews.&quot; In fact, Adam says that he prefers to not give scores at all, but that the system was an integral part of the old show that they wanted to carry over to the new iteration; the score reflects the hosts&#x27; thoughts on the game.

During the November 19, 2021 episode broadcast live on Twitch, Adam and new Xplay hosts TheBlackHokage, Froskurinn, and Jirard &quot;The Completionist&quot; Khalil broke down the revised Xplay rating scale as follows:

1 out of 5 - Broken, Unfinished, or Worthless

* Rarely &quot;awarded&quot;.
* We&#x27;re embarrassed FOR this game.
* A waste of a player&#x27;s money and time.
* No fun to be had except to watch this game be roasted by Xplay.

Examples Given: &quot;Cyberpunk 2077&quot; for PlayStation 4, &quot;Shadow the Hedgehog (video game)&quot;

2 out of 5 - This is a bad game

* Aggressively poor design decisions were made.
* It makes you angry to keep playing.
* The bad overwhelms the good.

Examples Given: &quot;Crisis Core Final Fantasy VII&quot;, &quot;Apex Legends&quot; for Nintendo Switch.

3 out of 5 - This is a fine game

* A &quot;good&quot; game.
* Enjoyable, but lacks that special something.
* Forgettable, but technically competent.

Example Given: &quot;&quot;

4 out of 5 - This is a great game

* Top of the &quot;normal&quot; review scale.
* Technically perfect title that lacks some sort of spark.
* Top-level game that never truly surprises the player.

Examples Given: &quot;Halo Wars&quot;, &quot;Persona 4&quot;, &quot;Brütal Legend&quot;.

5 out of 5 - Highest Score Possible

* Rarely awarded.
* More than the sum of its parts.
* Creates a lasting, unique experience for the player.
* A must-play!
* Major contender for Game of the Year.

Examples Given: &quot;Metal Gear Solid 4: Guns of the Patriots&quot;, &quot;Bully (video game)&quot;, &quot;No More Heroes (video game)&quot;, &quot;Psychonauts 2&quot;.

During the breakdown, Froskurinn tells viewers to think of the scale &quot;less as a 5 point scale and more of a 4 point scale, with the 5 as a bonus that is very, very hard to reach.&quot;

==Sketches and segments==
Various recurring segments and comedy skits have been used throughout the show&#x27;s history by the &quot;X-Play&quot; writers.

===&quot;Gaming Update/The Feed: Gaming Edition&quot;===
The Gaming Update originally began in 2007 as a short segment (hosted by Joel Gourdin) which recapped the top three or four news items of the day, and would often air before leading out to commercial. When X-Play relaunched with their new format in 2008, the segment developed into a two- to three-minute piece running at the start of each show, narrated by either Adam or Morgan (or by Blair Herter, who served as X-Play newsdesk producer at the time), then continued via a news ticker at the bottom of the screen throughout the rest of the episode.

===&quot;Video Viewer Mail/X-Play Inbox&quot;===
Adam and Morgan would often read selected correspondence from the program&#x27;s viewers at the end of every episode. These messages from the fans could be questions about the current state of the videogame
industry, requests for recommendations on the best games to buy, or (especially during the TechTV era) hate mail from viewers who felt that X-Play did not give certain games a &quot;fair&quot; rating.

On November 6, 2006, X-Play gave their Viewer Mail segment a high-tech face-lift, by renaming it Video Viewer Mail. While previous correspondence was held via the written word or e-mail, the producers added the
ability for viewers to also record short clips of themselves asking questions with a webcam or video recorder; people who had their viewer mail appear on air often would receive a free gift, such as a game or T-shirt
provided by Jinx.com.

In early 2011, this segment was again rebranded as simply The X-Play Inbox, with the practice of featuring video clips sent in from viewers seemingly dropped altogether.

===&quot;Face Time&quot;===
This segment featured the hosts conducting an interview with a personality from the gaming community (programmers, directors, company CEOs, etc.) either in studio or via satellite. It continued the &quot;X-Play&quot; tradition of having famous names on their show, including non-gaming celebrities such as Adam West, David Duchovny, John Cleese, Ben Affleck, Angelina Jolie, Carmen Electra, Ben Stiller, Andrew W.K., Rob Van Dam, Kurt Angle, Quentin Richardson, Jet Li, Vin Diesel, Janina Gavankar, and Kumail Nanjiani.

===&quot;X-List&quot;===
A top-five list compiled by the X-Play writers that have to do with video games (including &quot;Top Five Smash Bros. Levels&quot;, &quot;Top Five Creatures in Halo 3&quot;, and &quot;Top Five Recommended Obscure Games&quot;).

===&quot;Cheat!&quot;===
The Cheat! concept originally existed as a half-hour television program airing on the G4 network; however, in 2008 the show&#x27;s host - Kristin Adams (née Holt) - moved over to the &quot;X-Play&quot; staff and &quot;Cheat!&quot; was re-created
as a single segment where she provided cheat codes and/or secrets for currently released games to the viewing audience.

===&quot;Spoiler Theater&quot;===
In this segment, Adam and Morgan showcased and spoiled the endings of current-generation games that had been on the market for some time (their reasoning was that the game had been available to the home viewers for such a length of time that if they have not yet purchased/beaten said game by this point, they never will). Past games that have been given the Spoiler Theater treatment include &quot;Metroid Prime&quot;, &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Hearts&quot;, &quot;Kingdom Hearts II&quot;, &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, &quot;Conker&#x27;s Bad Fur Day&quot;, and &quot;Metal Gear Solid 2&quot;.

There was also an occasional segment called &quot;Insignificant Spoiler Theater&quot; (alternately identified as &quot;Not-So-Spoiler Theater&quot; and &quot;Irrelevant Spoiler Theater&quot; on G4&#x27;s website), which featured the endings of games that either exhibited very little in the way of plot (such as &quot;Katamari Damacy&quot; and &quot;Left Behind: Eternal Forces&quot;) or were based on movies where the storylines are already well-known (like &quot;The Godfather&quot;, &quot;Reservoir Dogs&quot;, and &quot;Pirates of the Caribbean&quot;).

===&quot;X-Play Investigates&quot;===
This segment began during the TechTV era as a parody of investigative news programs; X-Play would delve into such &quot;hard-hitting&quot; issues as the effects of E-rated games on America&#x27;s youth, just what the &quot;cool&quot; people (such as then-TechLive anchor Chris Leary) were into, the horrors of animal testing for video-game quality control, and why certain intellectual property - like the TV show &quot;American Chopper&quot; - deserved to have their own video games (in the cleverly titled &quot;&quot;How&#x27;d They Get a Game&quot;?&quot;).

However, this segment has recently taken on a more serious tone, with the show tackling subjects without the sole intent of creating comedy skits. Examples include a look at the portrayal of sex in video games, the prevalence of &quot;achievement whores&quot;, and an inspection of the life of competitive gamer Steve Wiebe.

===&quot;Best Of Awards&quot;===

&quot;X-Play&quot; would dedicate an entire show to the best games released over the preceding twelve months; awards were handed out in several categories, such as &quot;Most Original Game&quot; and &quot;Best Handheld Game&quot;, but the most prestigious - and most hotly debated - is &quot;Game of the Year&quot;:

* 2021 winner - &quot;Psychonauts 2&quot;
* 2012 winner - &quot;Borderlands 2&quot;
* 2011 winner - &quot;The Elder Scrolls V: Skyrim&quot;
* 2010 winner - &quot;Mass Effect 2&quot;
* 2009 winner - &quot;Uncharted 2: Among Thieves&quot;
* 2008 winner - &quot;Fable II&quot;
* 2007 winner - &quot;BioShock&quot;
* 2006 winner - &quot;The Legend of Zelda: Twilight Princess&quot; 
* 2005 winner - &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot;
* 2004 winner - &quot;Halo 2&quot;
* 2003 winner - &quot;Star Wars: Knights of the Old Republic&quot;

===&quot;Golden Mullet Awards&quot;===
The polar opposite of X-Play&#x27;s yearly &quot;Best Of&quot; special, The Golden Mullet Awards were used to showcase the reviewers&#x27; picks for worst video games of the past year. The name is a twisted &quot;homage&quot; to the Aquaman character from the poorly reviewed 2003 game &quot;&quot;, who sported a blonde polygonal mullet hairstyle.

===&quot;The X-Play Challenge&quot;===
In this segment, the hosts would have a celebrity guest conduct a speedrun through &quot;World 1-1&quot; of the original &quot;Super Mario Bros.&quot; for the NES. Their times were then placed on the leaderboard (i.e. a cardboard facsimile of the
flagpole found at the end of the level):

* Randy Pitchford: 21.1 seconds
* Ted Price: 23.6 seconds
* Cliff Bleszinski: 24.0 seconds
* Game: 25.3 seconds
* Scott Porter: 26.3 seconds
* Kiki Wolfkill: 27.5 seconds
* Ken Levine: 31.6 seconds
* Andrew W.K.: 33.1 seconds
* Ernest Cline: 38.5 seconds
* Thomas Jane: 39.7 seconds
* Todd Stashwick: 42.7 seconds

===Non-Denominational Holiday Buyer&#x27;s Guide===
For the holiday season, X-Play aired gift guide episodes that recommends video games to viewers for Christmas.

==Themes==
===Recurring characters===
&quot;X-Play&quot; has amassed a large group of fictional characters that will appear from time to time, often to bring some humor during game reviews.
===Interns===
&quot;X-Play&quot; has its own cast of &quot;interns&quot; (students from local universities who have signed up with G4 to gain valuable work experience in the television production field), who will sometimes appear as characters on the show. When appearing on camera, they are commonly outfitted in a white undershirt with the word &quot;INTERN&quot; scrawled across the chest in black Sharpie.

Their roles are not relegated to simply being on-screen comic relief, as the interns are accountable for much of the game footage used during reviews/previews. &quot;X-Play&quot; interns also play a role in other behind-the-scenes work on the show&#x27;s set; some of the former interns have eventually been hired full-time within the G4 company itself. Examples include Leticia Caparaz (the first intern to be offered a full-time position in 1999 as a Production Assistant and later the program&#x27;s Web Producer, before leaving the company in June 2004 as a result of the G4/TechTV merger), Jason Frankovitz (he would leave the show in early 2005), Albert Iskander (who has worked as a Production Assistant for G4&#x27;s &quot;Video Game Vixens&quot; and &quot;G4tv.com&quot;), Gene Yraola (now a part of G4&#x27;s Games Editorial Department, the liaison between the shows and the actual software/hardware companies), Eric Acasio (a production assistant for &quot;X-Play&quot;) and Emily Mollenkopf (hired as a production assistant on &quot;Attack of the Show&quot; in 2006).

A near-complete list of interns who have worked on the show follows:
* From San Francisco, California: &quot;Leticia Caparaz&quot;, &quot;Jason Frankovitz&quot;, &quot;Scott Humphrey&quot;, &quot;Chris Ivarson&quot;, &quot;Matt Ketterer&quot;, &quot;Robert Padbury&quot;, &quot;Desiree Peel&quot;, &quot;Jana Suverkropp&quot;, &quot;Kevin Theobald&quot;, &quot;Blake Yoshiura&quot;, and &quot;Kevin Yuen&quot;.
* From Los Angeles, California:, &quot;Eric Acasio&quot;, &quot;Russ Brock&quot;, &quot;Steve Dutzy&quot;, &quot;Brian Flores&quot;, &quot;Gil Garcia&quot;, &quot;Albert Iskander&quot;, &quot;Isaac Gelman&quot;, &quot;Kenny&quot;, &quot;Megan&quot;, &quot;Erik Merlin&quot;, &quot;Emily Mollenkopf&quot;, &quot;Geoff Pinkus&quot;, &quot;Stephan&quot;, &quot;Alex Villegas&quot;, &quot;Chuck Wilkerson&quot;, &quot;Chris Wilson&quot;, &quot;Gene Yraola&quot;, &quot;Rob Yeager&quot;, &quot;Daniel Powley&quot;, Michael &quot;Sully&quot; Sullivan, and &quot;Thomas McBeath&quot;

The &quot;Screaming Intern&quot; (played by Robert Manuel) was actually not a true intern, but instead was an editorial coordinator for the show.

===Guest appearances===
When &quot;X-Play&quot; was still a part of TechTV, personalities from other shows on the network would often make guest appearances (including Leo Laporte, Yoshi DeHerrera, and &quot;Unscrewed&#x27;s&quot; Martin Sargent and Laura Swisher). This continued after the merger with G4, with names like Kevin Pereira, Tina Wood, and Julie Stoffer.

&quot;X-Play&quot; has also had pseudo-celebrities who are not affiliated with G4 (such as Tony Little, Kato Kaelin, Michael Winslow, and Rip Taylor) appear on the show.

===Hatred===
There have been several gaming titles/genres/trends over the years which the hosts have displayed an exaggerated sense of &quot;hatred&quot; towards (often playing up their dislike for the cameras in order to make for humorous television). These include:
* Card battle games such as &quot;Yu-Gi-Oh!&quot;.
* Games based on anime series (particularly &quot;Naruto&quot;, &quot;Dragon Ball Z&quot;, &quot;Bleach&quot;, &quot;One Piece&quot;, and &quot;Fullmetal Alchemist&quot;).
* &quot;Ungodly boob physics&quot;, where female video-game characters are rendered with impossibly large breasts that bounce and sway unnaturally and independently from the rest of their bodies (this phenomenon is particularly prevalent in Japanese dating simulation games like &quot;Sexy Beach 2&quot;).
* Game series which continue to produce titles despite a lack of quality and/or innovation (such as &quot;Dynasty Warriors&quot;, &quot;Mega Man&quot;, &quot;Leisure Suit Larry&quot;, &quot;Tony Hawk&quot;, and 3D iterations of &quot;Sonic The Hedgehog&quot;).
* The proliferation of WWII first-person shooter games on the market (during their review of &quot;Moscow to Berlin: Red Siege&quot;, Morgan remarked &quot;That&#x27;s it! No more World War II games! According to my contract, I only have to review 75 World War II games per year, and I already hit my quota in March!&quot;).
* Video games based on existing IPs (like current movies or TV shows), since they are usually rushed to the market to cash in on the latest craze and end up being painful to actually play (such as the &quot;Charlie&#x27;s Angels&quot; or &quot;Da Vinci Code&quot; video games).
* 3D water levels in games, since the show&#x27;s writers feel that game developers almost never capture the feeling of swimming in an enjoyable manner (&quot;Instead of making us awkwardly pilot our character through zero-gravity space, why don&#x27;t you just come to our house and punch us in the face? It&#x27;s exactly the same amount of fun!&quot;).
* &quot;Escort missions&quot;, where the player is forced to keep an NPC character (who has its own health meter) from dying; this often proves difficult when the NPC&#x27;s A.I. is so insufficient that they continuously place themselves in harm&#x27;s way (leaving the player with little or no chance to save them). However, &quot;Resident Evil 4&quot; is an exception of this.
* &quot;Barbie Horse Adventures: Wild Horse Rescue&quot; (Morgan has often called this the worst game ever made).
* Jonny Moseley and the ridiculous comments made in his video game &quot;Jonny Moseley Mad Trix&quot; (including the classic line &quot;What if it snowed in San Francisco?&quot;).
* Dane Cook and his brand of comedy.
* Uwe Boll and his film adaptions of video games.
* Shovelware for the Nintendo Wii, like &quot;All Star Cheer Squad&quot; and &quot;Crappy Minigame Collection No. 272&quot;.
* Developers who feel the need to take a perfectly acceptable single-player game and tack on a multiplayer mode.
* Sixaxis controls in PS3 games.
* 3D &quot;Castlevania&quot; games.
* Level grinding in role-playing games.
* Japanese RPGs. This was considered to be Adam&#x27;s pet peeve where people would tell Adam that Japanese RPGs, such as &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;, are the best RPGs. Adam however believes that &quot;Final Fantasy&quot; is not the best RPG.
* &quot;Devil May Cry&quot;, claiming that it is a &quot;last-gen&quot; game.
* The animated series &quot;&quot;.

===Physical comedy===
For comedic purposes, the &quot;X-Play&quot; writers have portrayed the show as an exceedingly violent working environment; interns are often depicted as suffering from sexual harassment and physical abuse at the hands of the hosts (such as being forced to use a bucket to relieve themselves - instead of the bathroom - or retrieving items suspended over the &quot;&quot;X-Play&quot; snake pit&quot;).

This violent dynamic has also manifested itself within the interactions between the hosts themselves (like when Morgan Webb continuously struck Adam Sessler with a baseball bat during &quot;X-Play&#x27;s&quot; mockumentary on the history of violence in video games).

==Online content==
The producers of &quot;X-Play&quot; have used a number of internet-driven initiatives to engage the show&#x27;s technologically savvy audience.

===&quot;The X-Play Boards&quot;===
The show&#x27;s hosts have often been the subject of numerous negative comments (including &quot;Morgan&#x27;s not really a gamer!&quot; and &quot;Sessler doesn&#x27;t know gaming because he hates &quot;Final Fantasy&quot;!&quot;) through the show&#x27;s official message board. The vitriol spewed forth on the forums has become so well-documented that the &quot;X-Play&quot; staff even produced a music video dedicated to the message board&#x27;s denizens entitled &quot;On the X-Play Boards&quot; (MP3 format).

The song was written and performed by &quot;Marque Phahee and the Bling Dongs&quot; (in reality &quot;X-Play&quot; segment producer Mark Fahey playing an acoustic guitar), featuring the &quot;X-Play After School Choir&quot; (composed of Morgan, Adam and various recurring &quot;X-Play&quot; characters). It is also supposed to be the lead track from the &quot;X-Play: The Musical&quot; motion picture soundtrack (even though &quot;X-Play&quot; eventually created an actual all-musical episode which made no mention of &quot;On the X-Play Boards&quot;).

===Chat===
When &quot;X-Play&quot; was still a part of TechTV, the show would host an online chat every Tuesday at 1:00 p.m. EST. After the merger with G4, &quot;X-Play&#x27;s&quot; official IRC chat room was re-designed by Philippe Detournay and Raphael Seeqmuller using the PJIRC chat client.

On November 6, 2006 (to coincide with the show&#x27;s move to prime time), G4 integrated &quot;X-Play&#x27;s&quot; chat feature into the actual broadcast of each new episode. Using an idea similar to their production of &quot;Star Trek 2.0&quot;, a window covering the bottom half of the screen would pop up during reviews and display messages typed out by G4 users on &quot;X-Play&#x27;s&quot; official web site in real-time (with moderation for broadcast standards to avert profanity and other inappropriate responses). The presentation of the &quot;X-Play&quot; chat function was later redesigned for the show&#x27;s 2008 reformatting, so that chat messages would display on the left-hand side of the screen during a review.

===Twitter===
The interactive chat feature was abandoned in late 2009, in order to take advantage of the increasing popularity of the micro-blogging site Twitter. The show&#x27;s producers now present &quot;X-Play&quot; viewers with a question relevant to the day&#x27;s news/reviews via their official Twitter feed, then display the resulting answers during that night&#x27;s episode through a scrolling ticker on the bottom portion of the screen.

Starting the week of June 13, 2011, the show began the practice of having their on-air personalities live-tweeting during reruns of the show airing on Thursdays and Fridays.

===&quot;X-Play: The Online Game&quot;===
&quot;X-Play: The Online Game&quot; is a short Flash game created by the San Francisco-based company &quot;Orange Design&quot; (graphics and audio by Sean Talley, programming by Fearghal O&#x27;Dea).

The brief intro sequence begins in the fictitious &quot;X-Play Labs&quot; (which made an appearance on the show during the &quot;X-Play X-Plentions&quot; skit), where Morgan is about to put the finishing touches on the &quot;X-Play&quot; online game. An excited Adam asks if the game can have &quot;fudge zombies and stealthy ninjas and drunken pirates and radioactive Dik-diks&quot;, then haphazardly presses a large red button which &quot;digitizes physical matter and materializes digital matter&quot;; this causes all of the bad guys from the &quot;X-Play&quot; video game to escape (much to Morgan&#x27;s chagrin).

Once the game begins, players can choose from big-headed versions of either Adam (whose main weapon is &quot;Slippy the Fish&quot;) or Morgan (whose main weapon is her fists), and battle their way through a few continuously repeating levels of action. Controls consist of the arrow keys for movement, the &quot;A&quot; key to punch, and the &quot;S&quot; key to kick.

The game is no longer available on G4&#x27;s website, but a mirror site can be found via Orange Design&#x27;s online company portfolio.

===&quot;Hyperactive&quot;===
Culled from the theory that many viewers of TechTV both watched the network while using the internet, &quot;TechTV&#x27;s Hyperactive &quot; was launched in 2004.

Designed to be used as a combination trivia game and chat room which would run concurrently with the 11 PM weeknight block of &quot;X-Play&quot; and &quot;Unscrewed with Martin Sargent&quot;, participants could compete against one another by answering questions relating to, and revolving around, video games, pop-culture and host references from episodes that were currently airing. Leaderboards were synchronized with the episodes as they aired, often showcasing the names of the 10 highest scoring contestants as the show came back from each commercial break.

After the merger of TechTV and G4, &quot;Hyperactive&quot; continued until late 2004. During this time, participants could win an iPod mini by playing the game.

===&quot;Daily Video Podcast&quot;===
On November 11, 2005, G4 started offering &quot;X-Play&quot; segments (reviews, skits, etc.) for free in podcast form via their website and the iTunes Store, giving viewers the opportunity to watch segments on-demand with their computers and portable devices. These podcasts have since become available through other podcatcher software (such as the Zune Marketplace) as well.

===&quot;X-Play Weekly&quot;===
On August 14, 2008, a special weekly wrap-up show called &quot;X-Play Weekly&quot; was made available for download on the Xbox LIVE Video Store, allowing Xbox 360 owners to view highlights from the previous week&#x27;s episodes for 160 Microsoft Points ($2 US).

Beginning the week of June 15, 2009, &quot;X-Play Weekly&quot; was also made available for download through the PlayStation Network, also at $2 per weekly program.

===&quot;Feedback&quot;===
In September 2009, G4TV.com rebranded its &quot;Feed Nightcap&quot; vodcast (a web spin-off of the &quot;Attack of the Show&quot; segment &quot;The Feed&quot;) with the new title &quot;Feedback&quot; . This weekly segment was hosted by Adam Sessler (before Blair Herter took over official hosting duties with the October 19th, 2011 episode) and featured a rotating panel of co-hosts drawn from &quot;X-Play&#x27;s&quot; editorial staff with the occasional guest from the gaming industry (such as Tim Schafer and Cliff Bleszinski). The show&#x27;s stated goal is to deliver &quot;intelligent, informative, and very very humorous discussion about games&quot; by reviewing current news stories and answering viewer questions. It is filmed via a roundtable format in G4&#x27;s audio recording studio. Even though the show could be considered an extension of the &quot;AOTS&quot; brand, all of the content for the program is drawn from and presented by &quot;X-Play&quot; staff.

==Book==
On October 22, 2004, TechTV (in association with Peachpit Press) published the book &quot;The X-Play Insider&#x27;s Guide to Gaming: All You Ever Wanted to Know About Video Games From G4techTV&#x27;s Brutally Honest Experts&quot;. Written by Marc Saltzman (along with the &quot;X-Play Cast&quot;) and weighing in at a hefty 468 pages, the book contains game reviews, cheat codes, and Q&amp;A sessions with the cast and crew. Adam and Morgan even went on a nationwide book-signing tour to help promote their literary endeavor.

Copies of the book can be found everywhere from the Brooklyn Public Library to the University of Hong Kong.

<text>A land-grant university (also called land-grant college or land-grant institution) is an institution of higher education in the United States designated by a state to receive the benefits of the Morrill Acts of 1862 and 1890, or a beneficiary under the Equity in Educational Land-Grant Status Act of 1994. There are 106 institutions in all: 57 which fall under the 1862 act, 19 under the 1890 act, and 35 under the 1994 act.

With Southerners absent during the Civil War, Republicans in Congress set up a funding system that would allow states to modernize their weak higher educational systems. The Morrill Act of 1862 provided land in the western parts of North America that states sold to fund new or existing colleges and universities. The law specified the mission of these institutions: to focus on the teaching of practical agriculture, science, military science, and engineering—although &quot;without excluding other scientific and classical studies&quot;. This mission was in contrast to the historic practice of existing colleges which offered a narrow Classical curriculum based heavily on Latin, Greek and mathematics.

The Morrill Act quickly stimulated the creation of new state colleges and the expansion of existing institutions to include these new mandates. By 1914, land-grant colleges and universities in every state gained political support and expanded the definition and scope of university curricula to include advanced research and outreach across the state. The federal Hatch Act of 1887 established an agricultural experiment station at each school to conduct research related to the needs of improving agriculture as well as a system to disseminate information to the farmers eager to innovate. By 1917, Congress funded the teaching of agricultural subjects in the new public high schools that were opening. The Second Morrill Act of 1890 further expanded federal funding for the land-grant colleges and funded the founding of new land-grant colleges for African Americans; these institutions are now among the nation&#x27;s historically black colleges and universities (HBCUs). The 1994 expansion gave land-grant status and benefits to several tribal colleges and universities. Most of the state schools were coeducational—indeed they led the way in that reform. A new department was added: home economics. However, relatively few women attended and they had second-class status.

Ultimately, most land-grant schools became large state universities that offer a full spectrum of educational and research opportunities. Some land-grant colleges are private, including Cornell University and Tuskegee University.

==History==
The concept of federal support for agricultural and technical educational institutions in every state first rose to national attention through the efforts of Jonathan Baldwin Turner of Illinois in the late 1840s. However, the first land-grant bill was introduced in Congress by Representative Justin Smith Morrill of Vermont in 1857. The bill passed in 1859, but was vetoed by President James Buchanan. Morrill resubmitted his bill in 1861, and President Abraham Lincoln signed the Morrill Act into law in 1862. The law gave every state and territory 30,000 acres per member of Congress to be used in establishing a &quot;land grant&quot; university. Over 17 million acres were granted through the federal land-grant law.

Recent scholarship has emphasized that many of these federal public lands had been purchased from Indigenous peoples through treaties and land cessions, often after they were defeated in war. Approximately 25% of the individual land parcels had not been purchased at all; treaties with tribes in California, for example, had been placed under seal by the U.S. Senate and were unratified at the time of the land grant.

Upon passage of the federal land-grant law in 1862, Iowa was the first state legislature to accept its provisions, on September 11, 1862. Iowa designated the State Agricultural College (now Iowa State University) as the land-grant college on March 29, 1864.

The first land-grant institution open under the Act was Kansas State University, which was established on February 16, 1863, and opened on September 2, 1863.

A second Morrill Act was passed in 1890, aimed at the former Confederate states. This act required each state to show that race was not an admissions criterion, or else to designate a separate land-grant institution for persons of color. This latter clause had the effect of facilitating segregated education, although it also provided higher educational opportunities for persons of color who otherwise would not have had them. Among the seventy colleges and universities which eventually evolved from the Morrill Acts are several of today&#x27;s historically black colleges and universities. Though the 1890 Act granted cash instead of land, it granted colleges under that act the same legal standing as the 1862 Act colleges; hence the term &quot;land-grant college&quot; properly applies to both groups.

Later on, other colleges such as the University of the District of Columbia and the &quot;1994 land-grant colleges&quot; for Native Americans were also awarded cash by Congress in lieu of land to achieve &quot;land-grant&quot; status.

In imitation of the land-grant colleges&#x27; focus on agricultural and mechanical research, Congress later established programs of sea grant colleges (aquatic research, in 1966), space grant colleges (space research, in 1988), and sun grant colleges (sustainable energy research, in 2003).

West Virginia State University, a historically black university, is the only current land-grant university to have lost land-grant status (when desegregation cost it its state funding in 1957) and subsequently regain it, which happened in 2001.

The land-grant college system has been seen as a major contributor in the faster growth rate of the U.S. economy that led to its overtaking the United Kingdom as economic superpower, according to research by faculty from the State University of New York.

The three-part mission of the land-grant university continues to evolve in the twenty-first century. What originally was described as &quot;teaching, research, and service&quot; was renamed &quot;learning, discovery, and engagement&quot; by the Kellogg Commission on the Future of State and Land-Grant Universities. It was later recast as &quot;talent, innovation, and place&quot; by the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (APLU).

Historians once presented a &quot;Romantic&quot; interpretation of the origins as a product of a working class democratic demand for access to higher education. Recent scholarship has abandoned this approach, showing there was little such demand. Instead middle class reformers were responsible because they thought that modern capitalism needed a better educated working class.
===State law precedents===

Prior to the enactment of the Morrill Act in 1862, individual states established institutions of higher education with grants of land. The first state to do so was Georgia, which set aside 40,000 acres for higher education in 1784 and incorporated the University of Georgia in 1785.

The College Lands were a tract of land in Ohio that the Congress in 1787 donated for the support of a university. The Ohio state legislature assigned the lands in 1804 to the creation of a new school, Ohio University.

Michigan State University was chartered under state law as an agricultural land-grant institution on February 12, 1855, as the Agricultural College of the State of Michigan, receiving an appropriation of of state-owned land. The Farmers&#x27; High School of Pennsylvania (later to become The Pennsylvania State University) followed as a state agricultural land-grant school on February 22 of that year. Michigan State and Penn State were subsequently designated as the federal land-grant colleges for their states in 1863. In 1955, the U.S. Postal service issued a commemorative stamp to celebrate the two institutions as &quot;first of the land-grant type institutions to be founded.&quot;

==Hatch Act and Smith–Lever Act==
The mission of the land-grant universities was expanded by the Hatch Act of 1887, which provided federal funds to states to establish a series of agricultural experiment stations under the direction of each state&#x27;s land-grant college, as well as pass along new information, especially in the areas of soil minerals and plant growth. The outreach mission was further expanded by the Smith–Lever Act of 1914 to include cooperative extension—the sending of agents into rural areas to help bring the results of agricultural research to the end users. Beyond the original land grants, each land-grant college receives annual federal appropriations for research and extension work on the condition that those funds are matched by state funds.

==Expansion==
While today&#x27;s land-grant universities were initially known as land-grant colleges, only a few of the more than 70 institutions that developed from the Morrill Acts retain &quot;College&quot; in their official names; most are universities.

The University of the District of Columbia received land-grant status in 1967 and a $7.24 million endowment (USD) in lieu of a land grant. In a 1972 Special Education Amendment, American Samoa, Guam, Micronesia, Northern Marianas, and the Virgin Islands each received $3 million.

In 1994, 29 tribal colleges and universities became land-grant institutions under the Improving America&#x27;s Schools Act of 1994. As of 2008, 32 tribal colleges and universities have land-grant status in the U.S. Most of these colleges grant two-year degrees. Six are four-year institutions, and two offer a master&#x27;s degree.

==Land acknowledgment statements and criticism==
In the early 21st century, a growing number of land-grant universities have placed land acknowledgment statements on their websites in recognition of the fact that their institutions occupy lands that were once traditional territories of Native American peoples. For example, the University of Illinois System states, 
These lands were the traditional birthright of indigenous peoples who were forcibly removed and who have faced two centuries of struggle for survival and identity in the wake of dispossession. We hereby acknowledge the ground on which we stand so that all who come here know that we recognize our responsibilities to the peoples of that land and that we strive to address that history so that it guides our work in the present and the future. 
Another example comes from the University of Connecticut which states, 
We would like to begin by acknowledging that the land on which we gather is the territory of the Eastern Pequot, Golden Hill Paugussett, Lenape, Mashantucket Pequot, Mohegan, Nipmuc and Schaghticoke Peoples who have stewarded this land throughout the generations. We thank them for their strength and resilience in protecting this land, and aspire to uphold our responsibilities according to their example.

In an article in &quot;High Country News&quot;, Robert Lee and Tristan Ahtone criticized such statements for failing to acknowledge the true breadth of the benefits derived by European Americans from formerly Native American land. They pointed out that land grants were used not only for campus sites but also included many other parcels that universities rented or sold to generate funds that formed the basis of their endowments. Lee and Ahtone also pointed out that only a few land-grant universities have undertaken significant efforts at reconciliation with respect to the latter types of parcels. For instance, they could identify what portions of their current resources are traceable to Native American lands and reallocate some of those resources to help Native Americans.

==Nomenclature==

The &quot;land grant&quot; name inspired those of the sea grant, space grant and sun grant college programs established in 1965, 1988, and 2003 respectively. Some land-grant universities are also in one or more of these newer programs, whose names denote their field of research rather their original source of funding.

In the Texas A&amp;M University System, the land-grant missions for agricultural research and extension have been relegated to a statewide agency of the university system rather than the main campus. Its agricultural missions, including the agricultural college at the system&#x27;s flagship campus, are now under the umbrella of Texas A&amp;M AgriLife.

<text>Adoniram Judson (; August 9, 1788 – April 12, 1850) was an American Congregationalist and later Particular Baptist missionary who worked in Burma for almost 40 years. At the age of 25, Judson was sent from North America to preach in Burma. His mission and work with Luther Rice led to the formation of the first Baptist association in America to support missionaries.

Judson was one of the first Protestant missionaries to Burma. He translated the Bible into Burmese and established a number of Baptist churches in Burma.

==Early life==
Judson was born on August 9, 1788, in Malden, Middlesex County, Massachusetts. He was born to Abigail (née Brown) and Adoniram Judson Sr., a Congregational minister, and Abigail (née Brown). Judson entered the College of Rhode Island &amp; Providence Plantations (now Brown University) at 16, and graduated as valedictorian of his class at 19. While studying at college, he met a young man named Jacob Eames, a devout deist and skeptic. Judson and Eames developed a strong friendship, leading to Judson&#x27;s abandonment of his childhood faith and parents&#x27; religious instruction. During this time, Judson embraced the writings of the French philosophes. After graduating from college, Judson opened a school and wrote an English grammar and mathematics textbook for girls.

Judson&#x27;s deist views were shaken when his friend Eames fell violently ill and died. Both had been sleeping in separate rooms at an inn, and Judson heard the death throes of the person next door, only to learn from the clerk the next morning that his anonymous neighbor had been Mr. Eames, who had indeed died. The shock of learning the dying neighbor&#x27;s identity – and that Eames had led Judson away from the Christian faith into skepticism, but was now dead – returned Judson back to the faith of his youth, although he was already attending the Andover Theological Seminary. In 1808, Judson &quot;made a solemn dedication of himself to God&quot;. During his final year at the school, Judson decided upon a missionary career.

In 1810, Judson joined a group of mission-minded students who called themselves &quot;The Brethren&quot;; the students inspired the establishment of America&#x27;s first organized missionary society. Eager to serve abroad, Judson became convinced that &quot;Asia with its idolatrous myriads, was the most important field in the world for missionary effort&quot;. He, and three other students from the seminary, appeared before the Congregationalists&#x27; General Association to appeal for support. In 1810, the elders voted to form the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions.

===Marriage===
On September 19, Judson was appointed by the American Board of Commissioners for Foreign Missions as a missionary to the East. Judson was also commissioned by the Congregational Church, and married Ann Hasseltine on February 5, 1812. He was ordained the next day at the Tabernacle Church in Salem. On February 19, he set sail aboard the brig &quot;Caravan&quot; with Luther Rice; Samuel Newell and Harriet Newell; and his wife, Ann (known as &quot;Nancy&quot;) Judson.

==Ministry background==

===Voyage to India===
The Judsons arrived in Calcutta on June 17, 1812. While aboard ship en route to India, he did a focused study on the theology of baptism. He came to the position that believer&#x27;s baptism was theologically valid and should be done as a matter of obedience to the command of Jesus ().

On September 6, 1812, he switched to the Baptist denomination along with his wife and they were baptized by immersion in Calcutta by an English missionary associate of William Carey named William Ward.

Both the local and British authorities did not want Americans evangelizing Hindus in the area, so the group of missionaries separated and sought other mission fields. They were ordered out of India by the British East India Company, to whom American missionaries were even less welcome than British (they were baptized in September, and already in June, the United States had declared war on Great Britain). The following year, on July 13, 1813, he moved to Burma, and en route his wife miscarried their first child aboard ship.

Judson offered to Baptists in the United States to serve as their missionary. Luther Rice, who had also converted, was in poor health and returned to America where his work and William Carey&#x27;s urging resulted in the 1814 formation of the first national Baptist denomination in the United States for Foreign Missions (commonly called the Triennial Convention) and its offshoot the American Baptist Missionary Union.

===Missionaries in Burma===
It was another difficult year before the Judsons finally reached their intended destination, Burma. Buddhist Burma, Judson was told by the Serampore Baptists, was impermeable to Christian evangelism. Judson, who already knew Latin, Greek, and Hebrew, immediately began studying Burmese grammar but took over three years to learn to speak it. This was due, in part, to the radical difference in structure between Burmese and Western languages. He found a tutor and spent twelve hours per day studying the language. He and his wife firmly dedicated themselves to understanding it.

During this time they were almost entirely isolated from contact with any European or American. Four years passed before Judson dared even to hold a semi-public service. At first, he tried adapting to Burmese customs by wearing a yellow robe to mark himself as a teacher of religion, but he soon changed to white to show he was not a Buddhist. Then, he gave up the whole attempt as artificial and decided that, regardless of his dress, no Burmese would identify him as anything but a foreigner.

He accommodated some Burmese customs and built a &quot;zayat&quot;, the customary bamboo and thatch reception shelter, on the street near his home as a reception room and meeting place for Burmese men. Fifteen men came to his first public meeting in April 1819. He was encouraged but suspected they had come more out of curiosity than anything else. Their attention wandered, and they soon seemed uninterested. Two months later, he baptized his first Burmese convert, Maung Naw, a 35-year-old timber worker from the hill tribes. &quot;Burma Baptist Chronicle&quot; stated that Maung Naw (Nai Naw) was an ethnic Mon.

First attempts by the Judsons to interest the natives of Rangoon with the Gospel of Jesus met with almost total indifference. Buddhist traditions and the Burmese worldview at that time led many to disregard the pleadings of Adoniram and his wife to believe in one living and all-powerful God. Their second child, Roger William Judson, died at almost eight months of age.

Judson completed the translation of the &quot;Grammatical Notices of the Burman Language&quot; the following July and the &quot;Gospel of Matthew&quot;, in 1817. Judson began public evangelism in 1818 sitting in a zayat by the roadside calling out &quot;Ho! Every one that thirsteth for knowledge!&quot; The first believer was baptized in 1819, and there were 18 believers by 1822.

In 1820, Judson and a fellow missionary named Colman petitioned the Emperor of Burma, King Bagyidaw, in the hope that he would grant freedom for the missionaries to preach and teach throughout the country, as well as remove the sentence of death that was given for those Burmese who changed religion.

Bagyidaw disregarded their appeal and threw one of their Gospel tracts to the ground after reading a few lines. The missionaries returned to Rangoon and met with the fledgling church there to consider what to do next. The progress of Christianity would continue to be slow with much risk of endangerment and death in the Burmese Empire.

It took Judson 12 years to make 18 converts. His wife, Ann, was even more fluent in the spoken language of the people than her more academically literate husband. She befriended the wife of the viceroy of Rangoon, as quickly as she did illiterate workers and women.

A printing press had been sent from Serampore, and a missionary printer, George H. Hough, who arrived from America with his wife in 1817, produced the first printed materials in Burmese ever printed in Burma, which included 800 copies of Judson&#x27;s translation of the &quot;Gospel of Matthew&quot;. The chronicler of the church, Maung Shwe Wa, concludes this part of the story, &quot;So was born the church in Rangoon–logger and fisherman, the poor and the rich, men and women. One traveled the whole path to Christ in three days; another took two years. But once they had decided for Christ they were his for all time.&quot;

One of the early disciples was U Shwe Ngong, a teacher and leader of a group of intellectuals dissatisfied with Buddhism, who were attracted to the new faith. He was a Deist skeptic to whose mind the preaching of Judson, once a college skeptic himself, was singularly challenging. After consideration, he assured Judson that he was ready to believe in God, Jesus Christ, and the atonement.

Judson, instead of welcoming him to the faith, pressed him further asking if he believed what he had read in the gospel of Matthew that Jesus the son of God died on the cross. U Shwe Ngong shook his head and said, &quot;Ah, you have caught me now. I believe that he suffered death, but I cannot believe he suffered the shameful death on the cross.&quot; Not long after, he came back to tell Judson, &quot;I have been trusting in my own reason, not the word of God…. I now believe the crucifixion of Christ because it is contained in scripture.&quot;

The essence of Judson&#x27;s preaching was a combination of conviction of the truth with the rationality of the Christian faith, a firm belief in the authority of the Bible, and a determination to make Christianity relevant to the Burmese mind without violating the integrity of Christian truth, or as he put it, &quot;to preach the gospel, not anti-Buddhism.&quot;

By 1823, ten years after his arrival, membership of the little church had grown to 18, and Judson finished the first draft of his translation of the New Testament in Burmese.

===Anglo-Burmese War (1824–1826)===
Two opposite hungers triggered the First Anglo-Burmese War of 1824: Burma&#x27;s desire for more territory, and Britain&#x27;s desire for more trade. Burma threatened Assam and Bengal; Britain responded by attacking and absorbing two Burmese provinces into her India holdings to broaden her trade routes to East Asia. The war was a rough interruption of the Baptists&#x27; missionary work. English-speaking Americans were too easily confused with the enemy and suspected of spying.

Judson was imprisoned for 17 months during the war between the United Kingdom and Burma, first at Ava and then at Aung Pinle. Judson and Price were violently arrested. Officers led by an official executioner burst into the Judson home, threw Judson to the ground in front of his wife, bound him with torture thongs, and dragged him off to the prison of Ava.

Twelve months later, Judson and Price, along with a small group of surviving Western prisoners, were marched overland for six more months of misery in a primitive village near Mandalay. Of the sepoy British prisoners-of-war imprisoned with them, all but one died. He spent 20 months in prison.

After her husband was released by the Burmese, Ann wrote that one good result of the war could be that terms of the treaty which ceded Burmese provinces to the British might provide opportunity to expand the witness of the mission into unreached parts of the country.

On October 24, 1826, Ann died at Amherst (now Kyaikkami), Burma. Their third child died six months later. She died while her husband was out exploring the ceded province of Tenasserim. Within a few years of the end of the war, Baptist membership doubled on an average of every eight years for the 32 years between 1834 and 1866.

The collapse of Burma&#x27;s armies brought Judson out of prison, but his release was not complete freedom. In 1826, several months after the surrender, Burma pressed Judson into service as a translator for the peace negotiations.

Most of the growth of Baptist churches in Burma was in British-ruled territory, rather than the Burmese-ruled kingdom. Most of the growth came from animist tribes, rather than from the major population group, the Buddhist Burmese. The first Burmese pastor Judson ordained was Ko-Thah-a, one of the original group of converts, who refounded the church at Rangoon.

===Karen apostle===
The Karen people were a hunted minority group of ancient Tibeto-Burman ancestry scattered in the forests and jungles of the Salween River and in the hills along the southeast coast. Judson was the first missionary to make contact with them in 1827, when he ransomed and freed a debt-slave from one of his early converts. The freed slave, Ko Tha Byu, was an illiterate, surly man who spoke almost no Burmese and was reputed to be not only a thief, but also a murderer who admitted killing at least 30 men, but could not remember exactly how many more.

In 1828, the former Karen bandit, &quot;whose rough, undisciplined genius, energy and zeal for Christ&quot; (Sarah B Judson) had caught the notice of the missionaries, was sent south with a new missionary couple, the Boardmans, into the territory of the strongly animistic, non-Buddhist Karen. Ko Tha Byu was no sooner baptized, when he set off into the jungle alone to preach to his fellow tribe members. Astonishingly, he found them prepared for his preaching. Their ancient oracle traditions, handed down for centuries, contained some startling echoes of the Old Testament that some scholars conjecture a linkage with Jewish communities (or possibly even Nestorians), before their migrations from western China into Burma perhaps as early as the 12th century.

The core of what they called their &quot;Tradition of the Elders&quot; was a belief in an unchangeable, eternal, all-powerful God, creator of heaven and earth, of man, and of woman formed from a rib taken from the man (Genesis). They believed in humanity&#x27;s temptation by a devil, and its fall, and that some day a Great Messiah would come to its rescue. They lived in expectation of a prophecy that white foreigners would bring them a sacred parchment roll.

While the Boardmans and Ko Tha Byu were penetrating the jungles to the south, Judson shook off a paralyzing year-long siege of depression that overcame him after the death of his wife and set out alone on long canoe trips up the Salween River into the tiger-infested jungles to evangelize the northern Karen. Between trips, he worked unceasingly at his lifelong goal of translating the entire Bible into Burmese. When he finished it at last in 1834, he had been labouring on it for 24 years. It was printed and published in 1835.

In April of that same year, he married Sarah Hall Boardman, widow of fellow missionary George Boardman. They had eight children, five of whom survived to adulthood. Sarah&#x27;s health began failing and physicians recommended a return to America. Sarah died en route at St. Helena on September 1, 1845. He continued home, where he was greeted as a celebrity and toured the eastern seaboard raising the profile of and money for missionary activity. Because he could barely speak above a whisper, due to pulmonary illness, his public addresses were made by speaking to an assistant, who would then address the audience.

On June 2, 1846, Judson married for the third time, to writer Emily Chubbuck, who he had commissioned to write memoirs for Sarah Hall Boardman. They had a daughter born in 1847.

Sarah Cummings and Jason Tuma arrived in 1832. Cummings proved her mettle at once, choosing to work alone with Karen evangelists in the malaria-ridden Salween River valley north of Moulmein, but within two years she died of fever.

In 1835, a second single woman, Eleanor Macomber, after five years of mission to the Ojibway Indians in Michigan, joined the mission in Burma. Alone, with the help of Karen evangelistic assistants, she planted a church in a remote Karen village and nurtured it to the point where it could be placed under the care of an ordinary missionary. She lived there five years and died of jungle fever.

Judson developed a serious lung disease and doctors prescribed a sea voyage as a cure. On April 12, 1850, he died at age 61 on board ship in the Bay of Bengal and was buried at sea, having spent 37 years abroad with only one trip back home to America. A memorial to Judson was built on Burial Hill in Plymouth, Massachusetts.

==Legacy==

By the time of Judson&#x27;s death, he had translated the Bible into Burmese as well as a half-completed Burmese-English dictionary. Burma at the time had 100 churches, and over 8,000 believers.

By 2006, Myanmar had the third largest number of Baptists worldwide, behind the United States and India. The majority of adherents are Karen, Kachin and Chin.

Judson compiled the first ever Burmese-English dictionary; missionary E. A. Steven completed the English-Burmese half. Every dictionary and grammar written in Burma in the last two centuries has been based on ones originally created by Judson. Judson &quot;became a symbol of the preeminence of Bible translation for&quot; Protestant missionaries. In the 1950s, Burma&#x27;s Buddhist prime minister U Nu told the Burma Christian Council &quot;Oh no, a new translation is not necessary. Judson&#x27;s captures the language and idiom of Burmese perfectly and is very clear and understandable.&quot; Though the Bible has been translated numerous times into Burmese, Judson&#x27;s translation remains the most popular version in Myanmar.

Each July, Baptist churches in Myanmar celebrate &quot;Judson Day,&quot; commemorating his arrival as a missionary. Inside the campus of Yangon University is Judson Church, named in his honor, and in 1920 Judson College, named in his honor, merged into Rangoon College, which has since been renamed Yangon University. The American University named in his honor, Judson University was founded in Elgin, Illinois, in 1963, as the liberal arts Judson College was separated from the Northern Baptist Theological Seminary, which moved from Chicago to Lombard, Illinois. This American Judson College became Judson University in 2007 and now also has a campus in Rockford, Illinois.

Judson&#x27;s change to the validity of believer&#x27;s baptism, and subsequent need of support, led to the founding of the first national Baptist organization in the United States and subsequently to all American Baptist associations, including the Southern Baptists that were the first to break off from the national organization. Publication of his wife Ann&#x27;s letters about their mission inspired many Americans to become or support Christian missionaries. At least 36 Baptist churches in the United States are named after Judson. In 2024 Southeastern Baptist Theological Seminary renamed its undergraduate program to Judson College. 

The town of Judsonia, Arkansas is named after Judson along with Judson College in Alabama which was named after his wife Ann and a dormitory at Maranatha Baptist University carries his name. Christian Union owns and operates a ministry center named after him at his undergraduate alma mater, Brown University. His seminary alma mater, Andover Theological Seminary, (now Andover Newton Theological School), gives out an annual The Judson Award.

Judson Harmon, a former Governor of Ohio, was named after him.

Judson Deland Cominskie, first son of renowned Free Will Baptist minister Devin Lyle Cominskie, derives his name from Adoniram.

In World War II, the United States liberty ship SS &quot;Adoniram Judson&quot; was named in his honor.

<doc id="359729" wikidata="Q1156461" url="?curid=359729" title="Electronic Industries Alliance">
<text>The Electronic Industries Alliance (EIA; until 1997 Electronic Industries Association) was an American standards and trade organization composed as an alliance of trade associations for electronics manufacturers in the United States. They developed standards to ensure the equipment of different manufacturers was compatible and interchangeable. The EIA ceased operations on February 11, 2011, but the former sectors continue to serve the constituencies of EIA.

== History ==
In 1924, 50 radio manufacturers in Chicago formed a trade group called the &quot;Associated Radio Manufacturers&quot;. This organization was designed to control the licensing of the large number of radio patents so that each member could have access to all the relevant patents necessary to build radio transmitters, antennas and receivers. Over time, new electronic technologies brought new members, non-manufacturer members, and name changes.

Names in chronological order:
* 1924 – &quot;Associated Radio Manufacturers&quot;
* 1924 – &quot;Radio Manufacturers Association&quot; (&quot;RMA&quot;) 
* 1950 – &quot;Radio Television Manufacturers Association&quot; (&quot;RTMA&quot;)
* 1953 – &quot;Radio Electronics Television Manufacturers Association&quot; (&quot;RETMA&quot;)
* 1957 – &quot;Electronic Industries Association&quot; (&quot;EIA&quot;)
* 1997 – &quot;Electronic Industries Alliance&quot; (&quot;EIA&quot;)

The organization&#x27;s headquarters were in Arlington, Virginia. The EIA divided its activities into the following sectors:
* ECA – Electronic Components, Assemblies, Equipment &amp; Supplies Association
* JEDEC – JEDEC Solid State Technology Association, former Joint Electron Device Engineering Council
* GEIA – (now part of TechAmerica), Government Electronics and Information Technology Association
* TIA – Telecommunications Industry Association
* CEA – Consumer Electronics Association

The EIA announced in 2007 that it would be dissolved into its constituent divisions, and transferred operations soon after. The Alliance formally ceased to exist on February 11, 2011. EIA designated ECA to continue to develop standards for interconnect, passive and electro-mechanical (IP&amp;E) electronic components under the ANSI-designation of EIA standards. All other electronic components standards will be managed by their respective sectors.

The ECA merged with the National Electronic Distributors Association (NEDA) in 2011 to form the Electronic Components Industry Association (ECIA). However, the EIA standards brand will continue for IP&amp;E standards within ECIA.

== EIA standards ==
With the changing names of the EIA, the naming convention of the standards was also adapted. For example, a standard defining serial communication between computers and modems e.g. was originally drafted as a Recommended Standard, thus the &quot;RS&quot; RS-232. Later it was taken over by the EIA as &quot;EIA-232&quot;. Later this standard was managed by the TIA and the name was changed to the current &quot;TIA-232&quot;. Because the EIA was accredited by ANSI to help develop standards in its areas, these standards are often described as (e.g. &quot;ANSI TIA-232&quot;, or formerly as &quot;ANSI EIA/TIA-232&quot;). As currently authorized, any ANSI standard designated at ANSI EIA-xxx is developed or managed by ECA (and, in the future, ECIA).

<doc id="359733" wikidata="Q6624892" url="?curid=359733" title="List of land-grant universities">
<text>This is a list of land-grant colleges and universities in the United States of America and its associated territories.

Land-grant institutions are often categorized as 1862, 1890, and 1994 institutions, based on the date of the legislation that designated most of them with land-grant status.

Of the 106 land-grant institutions, all but two (the Community College of Micronesia and Northern Marianas College) are members of the Association of Public and Land-grant Universities (formerly the National Association of State Universities and Land-Grant Colleges).

Note: &quot;Historically black colleges or universities on this list are listed in italics&quot;.

==Native American==
The 31 tribal colleges of 1994 are represented as a system by the single membership of the American Indian Higher Education Consortium (AIHEC).

The AIHEC has its headquarters in Alexandria, Virginia for the benefits of ready access to the federal government in Washington, D.C. None of its member schools are located in Virginia. They are located from Michigan westward to Arizona, California and Alaska.

==By state==

===Alabama===

*&quot;Alabama A&amp;M University&quot;
*Auburn University (designated as a land-grant college in 1872 under the name Agricultural and Mechanical College of Alabama)
*&quot;Tuskegee University&quot; (private)

Though Alabama A&amp;M is Alabama&#x27;s official 1890 Morrill Act institution, the mission and unique history of Tuskegee are so similar to those of the 1890 institutions that it functions as a &quot;de facto&quot; land-grant university and is almost universally regarded as one of them. Tuskegee is a land-grant member of APLU, as are Alabama A&amp;M and Auburn. However, only Alabama A&amp;M and Auburn formally participate in the now-combined Alabama Cooperative Extension System, with Tuskegee listed as a &quot;cooperating partner&quot; in ACES. Tuskegee has also received Smith-Lever Act funds since 1972 to operate its own Cooperative Extension program. Tuskegee is also explicitly granted the same status as the 1890 land-grant institutions in a number of Federal laws.

===Alaska===
*University of Alaska Fairbanks

===Arizona===
*Diné College
*Tohono O&#x27;odham Community College, Sells
*University of Arizona, Tucson

===Arkansas===
*University of Arkansas (Fayetteville) (designated in 1871; opened in 1872)
*&quot;University of Arkansas at Pine Bluff&quot; (formerly Arkansas Agricultural, Mechanical and Normal)

===California===
*University of California (designated in 1866; University of California, Berkeley opened in 1868)

===Colorado===
*Colorado State University

===Connecticut===
*University of Connecticut
Originally, in 1863, the Sheffield Scientific School, part of Yale University, was designated as the state&#x27;s land-grant college. Despite the fact that Yale&#x27;s agricultural efforts and education were lauded by state officials and others (with 50 to 60 students graduating annually from its tuition-free agricultural program within the &quot;Sheff&quot;), the Connecticut State Grange felt farmers were not receiving the full benefits of the Morrill Act due to Yale&#x27;s high admissions standards; thus, in 1893, they persuaded the Connecticut General Assembly to establish Storrs Agricultural College (now called the University of Connecticut) and make it the state&#x27;s sole land-grant institution (thereby removing Yale University&#x27;s designation). In compensation, the General Assembly awarded Yale University $155,000.

The University of Nevada, Las Vegas, is technically considered a land-grant university according to the attorney-general of Nevada, but has received minuscule land-grant benefits as compared to the University of Nevada, Reno (UNR), and does not have an agricultural program. However, former Governor Brian Sandoval, a UNR graduate and the current president of UNR, opposes that interpretation and views UNR as the sole land grant institution in the state.

===North Carolina===
*North Carolina State University
*&quot;North Carolina A&amp;T State University&quot; (founded in 1891 as The Agricultural and Mechanical College for the Colored Race)

===Pennsylvania===
*Pennsylvania State University (designated in April 1863)

===Rhode Island===
*University of Rhode Island
Originally, in January 1863, Brown University was designated as the state&#x27;s land-grant college. Soon though, in the state&#x27;s opinion, Brown University provided inadequate agricultural education, in part due to the fact that it could not afford to hire a specific professor or faculty of agricultural sciences, and in part due to the fact that Rhode Island&#x27;s method for allocating land-grant scholarships favored urbanites and effectively produced few to no farmers. The curator of the University&#x27;s museum of natural history had been reluctantly recruited to give series of lectures on agricultural topics, which included visits to local farms. When the Hatch Act of 1887 supporting agricultural experiment stations was passed, the Grange had made sure it was stated therein that funds did not need to be applied to current colleges and could be used for agricultural experiment stations not connected with them, so the Rhode Island General Assembly, having grown disenchanted with Brown&#x27;s lackluster performance, established an agricultural school at Kingston and applied the Hatch Act&#x27;s funds to it. Eventually, in 1890, Brown felt it drew no benefit from being the state&#x27;s land-grant university, so it offered to return the Morrill trust to the state and withdraw as the land-grant institution. Shortly thereafter, Congress passed the second Morrill Act to increase funding to land-grant universities, and, following a controversy as to which school should benefit being decided in Brown&#x27;s favor by the Rhode Island Supreme Court, Brown promptly withdrew its offer. On May 19, 1892, after growing increasingly displeased with Brown&#x27;s agricultural program, the Rhode Island General Assembly decided to restructure the Kingston school as the Rhode Island College for the Agricultural and Mechanical Arts (now called the University of Rhode Island) and to designate it as the state&#x27;s only land-grant institution, thereby removing Brown from that status. Brown University protested by suing the state and the case was heard by the US District Court for Rhode Island. This court decided against Brown, which then appealed to the US Supreme Court. When the Supreme Court refused to hear the case, Brown conceded defeat such that, in 1894, the state, as related by Encyclopedia Brunoniana, &quot;approved an agreement in which Brown would repay the $50,000 received from the sale of the land in Kansas and assume the expense of educating the present holders of the state scholarships, and in return [Brown] would receive $40,000 in compensation for the education of earlier state scholars and would be relieved of the responsibility for agricultural education assumed in connection with the Morrill Act of 1863.&quot;

===South Carolina===
*Clemson University
*&quot;South Carolina State University&quot; (Founded in 1896 as the Colored Normal, Industrial, Agricultural and Mechanical College of South Carolina. It still has the 1890 land-grant legacy of service to the citizenry of the state.)

*Texas A&amp;M University
*&quot;Prairie View A&amp;M University&quot;
Founded in 1876, Prairie View is the second oldest state-sponsored institution of higher education in Texas (after Texas A&amp;M University). Consistent with terms of the federal Morrill Land-Grant Colleges Act, which provided public lands for the establishment of colleges, the State of Texas authorized an &quot;Agricultural and Mechanical College for the Benefit of Colored Youth&quot; as part of the Agricultural and Mechanical College of Texas (now Texas A&amp;M University) System.

===Utah===
*Utah State University

===Vermont===
*University of Vermont

===Virginia===

In 1902, the legislature revised the school&#x27;s charter and renamed it the &quot;Virginia Normal and Industrial Institute&quot;. In 1923, this college was renamed &quot;Virginia State College for Negroes&quot;. It was designated one of Virginia&#x27;s land grant colleges in response to the Amendments to the Morrill Act in 1890, which required that the states either open their land-grant colleges to all races, or else establish separate land-grant schools for African-Americans.

<text>Saluda is a census-designated place (CDP) in and the county seat of Middlesex County, Virginia, United States. 

== History ==
The Middlesex County Courthouse was built between 1850 and 1874 by architects William R. Jones and John P. Hill, and is listed in the National Register of Historic Places. A new courthouse complex was built in the 2003–2004 time-frame, but the opening was stalled due to various construction problems, leading to a legal dispute between the County board and the contractor. It was eventually opened in 2007.

An older notable building is the Christ Church. The highly decorated Marine, veteran of the Banana Wars, World War II, and the Korean War, Lieutenant General Lewis Burwell &quot;Chesty&quot; Puller was raised in Saluda. He died in Hampton, Virginia in 1971, and was buried in historic Christ Church&#x27;s Cemetery near Saluda.

== Demographics ==
The population stated in the 2010 Census was 769. As of the 2020 Census, the population was 627. According to the 2020 Census, Saluda has a 55.6% employment rate, 228 total houses with 125 belonging to families, and a medium income of $115,221 with a 10.7% poverty rate. Out of the population, 451 are white, 134 are black, 28 are mixed race, 1 is Asian, 1 is Native American, and 12 are other.

<doc id="359750" wikidata="Q319261" url="?curid=359750" title="Eugène Scribe">
<text>Augustin Eugène Scribe (; 24 December 179120 February 1861) was a French dramatist and librettist. He is known for writing &quot;well-made plays&quot; (&quot;pièces bien faites&quot;), a mainstay of popular theatre for over 100 years, and as the librettist of many of the most successful grand operas and opéras-comiques.

Born to a middle-class Parisian family, Scribe was intended for a legal career, but was drawn to the theatre, and began writing plays while still in his teens. His early years as a playwright were unsuccessful, but from 1815 onwards he prospered. Writing, usually with one or more collaborators, he produced several hundred stage works. He wrote to entertain the public rather than educate it. Many of his plays were written in a formulaic manner which aimed at neatness of plot and focus on dramatic incident rather than naturalism, depth of characterisation or intellectual substance. For this he was much criticised by intellectuals, but the &quot;well-made play&quot; remained established in the theatre in France and elsewhere long after his death.

In 1813 Scribe wrote his first opera libretto. From 1822 until his death he was closely associated with the composer Daniel Auber for whom he wrote or co-wrote 39 librettos, among them that for the first French grand opera, &quot;La Muette de Portici&quot; (1828). His second most frequent musical partner was Giacomo Meyerbeer, who took grand opera further and made it a dominant feature of French musical life. Among the other composers with whom Scribe worked were Adolphe Adam, Adrien Boieldieu, Gaetano Donizetti, Fromental Halévy, Jacques Offenbach and Giuseppe Verdi.

Scribe&#x27;s librettos are still performed in opera houses around the world, and although few of his non-musical plays have been revived frequently in the 20th or 21st centuries, his influence on subsequent generations of playwrights in France and elsewhere was profound and lasting.

==Life and career==
===Early years===
Scribe was born in Paris on 24 December 1791, at the family house in the Rue Saint-Denis near Les Halles. His father, a silk merchant, died while the boy was an infant, but left his widow comfortably off. Scribe was educated at the prestigious Collège Sainte-Barbe, where he was an outstanding pupil, winning the college&#x27;s top prize in his final year and being ceremonially crowned with a laurel wreath at the Académie Française. His mother intended him to pursue a career in the legal profession, and sent him to study with Louis-Ferdinand Bonnet, a leading Parisian lawyer.

Although he was conscientious in his studies, Scribe&#x27;s ambition was to write for the theatre, and when his mother died in 1807 he turned from the law, and together with his former classmate Germain Delavigne he set his sights on a theatrical career. His first piece, a one-act vaudeville &quot;Le Prétendu par hasard&quot;, was produced anonymously at the Théâtre des Variétés in January 1810 and was a failure. Numerous other plays, written in collaboration with Delavigne and others, followed; but for the next five years Scribe earned little from the theatre and was reliant on his inheritance. He had modest successes with &quot;Les Derviches&quot; (1811) and &quot;L&#x27;Auberge&quot;, (1812), both written with Delavigne for the Théâtre du Vaudeville. In 1813 he wrote the first of three melodramas, of which the third, &quot;Les Frères invisibles&quot;, did reasonably well at the Théâtre de la Porte Saint-Martin. In the same year he wrote his first opera libretto, for Luc Guénée&#x27;s opéra comique &quot;La Chambre à coucher&quot;. 

Scribe&#x27;s first substantial success came in 1815, with the comedy &quot;Une Nuit de la garde nationale&quot; (&quot;A Night at the National Guard&quot;), a collaboration with his friend Charles Delestre-Poirson. Over the next five years Scribe built a position as a dramatist, writing under his own name or pseudonyms, usually in collaboration with others. In 1820 Delestre-Poirson established the Théâtre du Gymnase, and opened on 23 December with &quot;Le Boulevard Bonne-Nouvelle&quot; by Scribe and two friends who had also abandoned law for the theatre, Baron Anne-Honoré-Joseph Duveyrier, who wrote under the pen name Mélesville, and Charles Moreau. Delestre-Poirson gave Scribe a remunerative contract that made him, in effect, the theatre&#x27;s resident playwright, with the Gymnase having first call on his services.

===1820s===
Between 1820 and 1830 Scribe wrote more than a hundred plays for the Gymnase, and librettos and plays for the Comédie-Française, the Opéra, the Opéra-Comique and seven other theatres. In 1822 he began a collaboration with the composer Daniel Auber that lasted for 41 years and produced 39 operas. Auber&#x27;s biographer Robert Letellier writes that the names of Scribe and Auber became as linked in French minds as those of Gilbert and Sullivan later were in British ones. The partners&#x27; first collaboration was &quot;Leicester, ou Le château de Kenilworth&quot;, a three-act opéra comique, with a plot that Scribe, in collaboration with Mélesville, derived from Walter Scott&#x27;s historical romance &quot;Kenilworth&quot;. As with his plays, Scribe customarily wrote his librettos in collaboration with other writers. For Auber he worked with, among others, X. B. Saintine, E.-J.-E. Mazères and Jules-Henri Vernoy de Saint-Georges as well as Mélesville and Delavigne. Letellier writes that &quot;part of Scribe&#x27;s genius lay in his careful selection of his collaborators&quot;. A story grew that Scribe would hire one man to write the narrative, a different one for the dialogue, a third for the jokes, a fourth for the lyrics, and so on. The story was apocryphal, but literary collaboration was a French tradition in which Scribe was thoroughly at home:
During his career Scribe worked with more than 60 co-authors, in addition to writing more than 130 stage works on his own. He wrote or co-wrote librettos for 48 composers. During the 1820s Scribe collaborated with Adrien Boieldieu on &quot;La Dame blanche&quot; (1825), a Romantic opera based on stories by Walter Scott. Scribe&#x27;s libretto was one of the first to introduce the supernatural into an operatic plot. The piece was enormously popular, and reached its thousandth performance at the Opéra-Comique shortly after Scribe&#x27;s death. In 1827 Scribe wrote the scenario for &quot;La Somnambule&quot;, a ballet with music by Ferdinand Hérold, for the Paris Opéra. It was a landmark – the first time the Opéra had presented a ballet with a scenario by a leading dramatist. Until then the storyline and staging of a ballet had been left to the in-house &quot;chef de danse&quot;. This was the precursor of the fusion of opera and ballet in the first French grand opera, given the following year – &quot;La Muette de Portici&quot;, with music by Auber and libretto by Scribe and Delavigne.

In 1828 Scribe collaborated with Gioachino Rossini on &quot;Le Comte Ory&quot;, an unusual undertaking as the words for about half the numbers had to be written to fit existing music, repurposed by Rossini from &quot;Il viaggio a Reims&quot;, a &quot;pièce d&#x27;occasion&quot; composed three years earlier. The opera was a success, and was seen in London within six months of the Paris premiere, and in New York in 1831.

===1830s===
In the 1830s Scribe&#x27;s works were twice adapted by others for new operas that became well known. His scenario for &quot;La Somnambule&quot; was used by Felice Romani as the basis of Vincenzo Bellini&#x27;s 1831 opera &quot;La sonnambula&quot;; his libretto for Auber&#x27;s &quot;Le Philtre&quot; (1831) was adapted by Romani for Gaetano Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;elisir d&#x27;amore&quot; (1832). The Opéra-Comique commissioned a grand opera, &quot;Robert le diable&quot;, from Scribe, Delavigne and Giacomo Meyerbeer. For reasons of musical politics the work was premiered by the Paris Opéra, at the Salle Le Peletier in 1831, after extensive re-writing. Within three years it reached 100 performances on the stage of the Opéra, and by 1835 it had been seen at 77 houses in ten different countries.

For the non-musical theatre, Scribe wrote &quot;Bertrand et Raton ou l&#x27;art de conspirer&quot; (The School for Politicians, 1830) a &quot;serious&quot; five-act comedy for the Comedie-Française. This began a series of historical or political comedies, which, as Pierre Larousse comments, have little to do with real politics and history, but which became the models of a new genre. The series continued with &quot;L&#x27;Ambitieux&quot; (1834), &quot;La Camaraderie&quot; (1836), &quot;Les Indépendants&quot; (1837), &quot;La Calomnie&quot; (1840) and &quot;Le Verre d&#x27;eau&quot; (1840), all comedies in five acts, developing a more or less original theme. In 1836 Scribe was elected to the Académie Française, and in 1839, at the age of 48 he married. His wife, whom he had known for several years, was the widow of a wine merchant. She worried about his tendency to overwork, and attempted, with only limited success, to get him to slow down. His working habits varied little throughout his life. He began work at five in the morning during the summer and at six in the winter, writing until noon. He spent the rest of the day planning new work, attending rehearsals of his plays or operas, and in the evening visiting friends or going to the theatre.

During the 1830s Scribe introduced social questions into his plays, although never losing sight of his principal purpose, which was to entertain. By this point in his career he had honed his skills as a dramatist and developed what became known as the &quot;well-made play&quot; – &quot;la pièce bien faite&quot; – characterised by concise plotting, compelling narrative and a largely standardised structure, with little emphasis on characterisation and intellectual ideas. In the words of one literary critic:

One of Scribe&#x27;s key devices was the &quot;quiproquo&quot;, in which two or more characters interpret a word, a situation or a person&#x27;s identity in different ways, all the time assuming that their interpretations are the same. This important feature of Scribe&#x27;s &quot;well-made plays&quot; was raised to its greatest heights by Georges Feydeau later in the 19th century.

Scribe&#x27;s earnings from his plays and librettos were considerable and he amassed a large fortune. He was a good businessman: commenting on a dispute over payment with Léon Pillet, the director of the Opéra, in 1841, he said he wanted to be paid for his librettos &quot;according to what they bring in, that is to say, a great deal. The present director only wants to pay for them according to what they are worth, that is to say, very little&quot;. He bought a mansion in the fashionable Rue Olivier-Saint-Georges and two country houses. He was unobtrusively generous to deserving causes; among his benefactions was a fund for impoverished musicians and theatre people, into which he paid 13,000 francs (roughly €125,000 in 2015 values) a year.

===Later years===
In Larousse&#x27;s view the latter part of Scribe&#x27;s career, from 1840 to 1861, was &quot;just as full and as glorious as the first&quot;. Larousse singled out from the long list of Scribe&#x27;s plays for the Théâtre Français: &quot;Une chaîne&quot; (1841), &quot;Le Puff&quot; (1848), &quot;Adrienne Lecouvreur&quot; (1849), &quot;Les Contes de la reine de Navarre&quot; (1850), &quot;Bataille de dames&quot; (1851) and &quot;La Czarine&quot; (1855). Of these, &quot;Bataille de dames&quot; – battle of the ladies – has been seen by literary critics including Brander Matthews and Stephen Stanton as among the best and most characteristic of Scribe&#x27;s plays. It combines a story of a young man&#x27;s successful attempts to escape official attempts to arrest him on a political charge with the depiction of the love two women have for him. It combines action, romance and a happy, albeit bitter-sweet, ending. Henrik Ibsen thought highly of the work, and drew on it in his own early writing; Bernard Shaw also drew on it, in his &quot;Arms and the Man&quot;.

Of Scribe&#x27;s later librettos for the Opéra or the Opéra-comique, Larousse listed as among the most notable: &quot;Les Diamants de la couronne&quot;, &quot;La Part du diable&quot; and &quot;Haydée&quot; (with Auber, 1841, 1843 and 1847) and &quot;Le Prophète&quot; and &quot;L&#x27;Etoile du Nord&quot; (with Meyerbeer, 1849 and 1854). In 1855 Scribe had his only direct collaboration with Giuseppe Verdi. (The libretto for the latter&#x27;s &quot;Un ballo in maschera&quot; (1859) was translated from Scribe&#x27;s libretto for Auber&#x27;s &quot;Gustave III, ou Le bal masqué&quot; (1833), but Scribe was not involved with the adaptation.) Scribe and Charles Duveyrier provided Verdi with the libretto for &quot;Les Vêpres siciliennes&quot;, premiered at the Opéra in June. It was well received; Hector Berlioz judged it a perfect mixture of French and Italian sensibilities, but it did not become a core part of the Verdian operatic repertoire.

Scribe was the subject of continual criticism from highbrow writers. Théophile Gautier and Théodore de Banville accused him of being &quot;the ultimate in bourgeois art and philistinism, pleasing the masses and writing &quot;théâtre vide&quot;&quot; – empty plays. Gautier asked, &quot;How is it that an author devoid of poetry, lyricism, style, philosophy, truth and naturalness could have become the most fashionable dramatic writer of an era?&quot; Scribe&#x27;s answer to the question was: 

Scribe elaborated on his views in a speech to the Académie Française: &quot;I do not think the comic author should be a historian: that is not his mission. I do not believe that even in Molière himself you can recover the history of our country&quot;. In a 2012 study, David Conway writes of Scribe&#x27;s historical operas:

At the Académie, Scribe went on to give his views on the purpose of the theatre of his own time, maintaining that the public no longer went to the theatre to be instructed – as had been the theory in the 18th century – but to be diverted and entertained. 

Scribe never retired. He was working on the libretto for Meyerbeer&#x27;s last opera, &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot;, when he died suddenly of a stroke on 20 February 1861, in his carriage on the way home from a meeting of the Société des auteurs et compositeurs dramatiques. He was buried in the Père Lachaise Cemetery.

Estimates differ considerably of the number of stage works Scribe wrote or co-wrote. The published edition of his known works ran to 76 volumes, but it is inevitably incomplete, as he is known to have written pseudonymously and even anonymously. His total output of stage works is variously reckoned as between 300 and nearly 500. The known works include more than 120 librettos for 48 composers, collaborations in musical and non-musical theatre with more than 60 co-authors, and over 130 stage works written solo.

Among the many later playwrights drawing on Scribe&#x27;s precepts for the well-made play were Alexandre Dumas &quot;fils&quot;, Victorien Sardou and Georges Feydeau in France, W. S. Gilbert, Oscar Wilde, Noël Coward and Alan Ayckbourn in Britain, and Lillian Hellman and Arthur Miller in the US.
===Librettos===
Among the best-known operas for which Scribe contributed to the libretto are:
*1825: Boieldieu&#x27;s &quot;La Dame blanche&quot;
*1828: Auber&#x27;s &quot;La Muette de Portici&quot;
*1828: Rossini&#x27;s &quot;Le Comte Ory&quot;
*1830: Auber&#x27;s &quot;Fra Diavolo&quot;
*1831: Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Robert le diable&quot;
*1831: Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Les Huguenots&quot;
*1835: Halévy&#x27;s &quot;La Juive&quot;

*1843: Donizetti&#x27;s &quot;Dom Sébastien&quot;
*1849: Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;Le Prophète&quot;
*1855: Verdi&#x27;s &quot;Les Vêpres siciliennes&quot;
*1858: Offenbach&#x27;s&quot; La chatte métamorphosée en femme&quot;
*1860: Offenbach&#x27;s &quot;Barkouf
*1865: Meyerbeer&#x27;s &quot;L&#x27;Africaine&quot; (posthumous)

Among the other composers with whom Scribe worked were Adolphe Adam, Michael Balfe, Luigi Cherubini, Charles Gounod, Ferdinand Hérold and Ambroise Thomas.

===Film adaptations===

There have been at least 30 films based on works by Scribe, from the 1916 silent &quot;The Dumb Girl of Portici&quot;, directed by Phillips Smalley and Lois Weber to &quot;A Glass of Water&quot; (1960), based on &quot;Le Verre d&#x27;eau&quot;.

<text>The Sharpeville massacre occurred on 21 March 1960, when police opened fire on a crowd of people who had assembled outside the police station in the township of Sharpeville in the then Transvaal Province of the then Union of South Africa (today part of Gauteng) to protest against the pass laws. A crowd of approximately 5,000 people gathered in Sharpeville that day in response to the call made by the Pan-Africanist Congress to leave their pass-books at home and to demand that the police arrest them for contravening the pass laws. The protestors were told that they would be addressed by a government official and they waited outside the police station as more police officers arrived, including senior members of the notorious Security Branch. At 1.30pm, without issuing a warning, the police fired 1,344 rounds into the crowd. For more than fifty years the number of people killed and injured has been based on the police record, which included 249 victims in total, including 29 children, with 69 people killed and 180 injured. More recent research has shown that at least 91 people were killed at Sharpeville and at least 238 people were wounded. Many people were shot in the back as they fled from the police.

The massacre was photographed by photographer Ian Berry, who initially thought the police were firing blanks. In present-day South Africa, 21 March is commemorated as a public holiday in honour of human rights and to commemorate the Sharpeville massacre.

In 2024, the area where the massacre occurred and the memorial became a World Heritage Site, known as Nelson Mandela Legacy Sites.

== Life in Sharpeville before the massacre ==
Sharpeville was first built in 1943 to replace Topville, a nearby township that suffered overcrowding where illnesses like pneumonia were widespread. Due to the illness, removals from Topville began in 1958. Approximately 10,000 Africans were forcibly removed to Sharpeville. Sharpeville had a high rate of unemployment as well as high crime rates. There were also youth problems because many children joined gangs and were affiliated with crimes instead of schools. Furthermore, a new police station was created, from which the police were energetic to check passes, deporting illegal residents, and raiding illegal shebeens.

== Preceding events ==

South African governments since the eighteenth century had enacted measures to restrict the flow of Africans into cities. Pass laws, intended to control and restrict their movement and employment, were updated in the 1950s. Under the country&#x27;s National Party government, African residents in urban districts were subject to influx control measures. Individuals over sixteen were required to carry passbooks, which contained an identity card, employment and influx authorisation from a labour bureau, name of employer and address, and details of personal history. Leading up to the Sharpeville massacre, the National Party administration under the leadership of Hendrik Verwoerd used these laws to enforce greater racial segregation and, in 1959–1960, extended them to include women. From the 1960s, the pass laws were the primary instrument used by the state to detain and harass its political opponents. These laws forced Africans to carry special identification that police and other authorities could check at any time. The government used passes to restrict where Africans could work, live and travel.

The Pan-Africanist Congress (PAC), led by its founding President Robert Sobukwe, marched peacefully and unarmed to the Orlando police station in Soweto and demanded to be arrested as they were not prepared to a carry dompass, on 21 March, simultaneously a university student, a member of the PAC, Philip Ata Kgosana led the very same march in the Cape Province in Langa Township.

==Massacre==
On 21 March 1960, a group of approximately 5,000 people gathered at the Sharpeville police station, offering themselves up for arrest for not carrying their passbooks. The Sharpeville police were not completely unprepared for the demonstration, as they had already driven smaller groups of more militant activists away the previous night.

The PAC actively organized to increase turnout to the demonstration, distributing pamphlets and appearing in person to urge people not to go to work on the day of the protest. Many of the civilians present attended voluntarily to support the protest, but there is evidence that the PAC also used coercive means to draw the crowd there, including the cutting of telephone lines into Sharpeville, and preventing bus drivers from driving their routes.

By 10:00, a large crowd had gathered, and the atmosphere was initially peaceful and festive. Fewer than 20 police officers were present in the station at the start of the protest. Later the crowd grew to about 20,000, and while some news reports described the mood as &quot;ugly&quot;, this has been contested by witnesses who were there, including photographer Ian Berry. 130 police officers supported by four Saracen armoured personnel carriers arrived in Sharpeville. The police were armed with firearms, including Sten submachine guns and Lee–Enfield rifles. There was no evidence that anyone in the gathering was armed with anything other than stones.

F-86 Sabre jets and Harvard Trainers approached to within of the ground, flying low over the crowd in an attempt to scatter it. The protesters responded by hurling stones (striking three policemen) and rushing the police barricades. Police officers attempted to use tear gas to repel these advances, but it proved ineffectual, and the police fell back on the use of their batons. At about 13:00 the police tried to arrest a protester, and the crowd surged forward. The police began shooting shortly thereafter.

===Death and injury toll===
The apartheid-era police records indicate that 69 people were killed, including 10 children, and 180 injured, including 19 children. This figure has subsequently been shown to have been greatly under-estimated. New research has shown that at least 91 people were killed and more than 238 people wounded. The police shot many people in the back as they turned to flee, causing some to be paralyzed.

Some of the victims were buried en masse in a ceremony performed by clergy. Philip Finkie Molefe, responsible for establishing the first Assemblies of God church in the Vaal, was among the clergy that conducted the service.

===Pretext for firing===
Police reports in 1960 claimed that young and inexperienced police officers panicked and opened fire spontaneously, setting off a chain reaction that lasted about forty seconds. Few of the policemen present had received public order training. Some of them had been on duty for over twenty-four hours without respite. Some insight into the mindset of those on the police force was provided by Lieutenant Colonel Pienaar, the commanding officer of the police reinforcements at Sharpeville, who said in his statement that &quot;the native mentality does not allow them to gather for a peaceful demonstration. For them to gather means violence.&quot; He also denied giving any order to fire and stated that he would not have done so.

The Truth and Reconciliation Commission found in 1998 that &quot;the evidence of Commission deponents reveals a degree of deliberation in the decision to open fire at Sharpeville and indicates that the shooting was more than the result of inexperienced and frightened police officers losing their nerve.&quot;

==Response==

The uproar among South Africa&#x27;s black population was immediate, and the following week saw demonstrations, protest marches, strikes, and riots around the country. On 30 March 1960, the government declared a state of emergency, detaining more than 18,000 people, including prominent anti-apartheid activists who were known as members of the Congress Alliance including Nelson Mandela and some still enmeshed in the Treason Trial.

Many white South Africans were also horrified by the massacre. The poet Duncan Livingstone, a Scottish immigrant from the Isle of Mull who lived in Pretoria, wrote in response to the massacre the Scottish Gaelic poem &quot;Bean Dubh a&#x27; Caoidh a Fir a Chaidh a Marbhadh leis a&#x27; Phoileas&quot; (&quot;A Black Woman Mourns her Husband Killed by the Police&quot;).

A storm of international protest followed the Sharpeville shootings, including sympathetic demonstrations in many countries and condemnation by the United Nations. On 1 April 1960, the United Nations Security Council passed Resolution 134. Sharpeville marked a turning point in South Africa&#x27;s history; the country found itself increasingly isolated in the international community. The event also played a role in South Africa&#x27;s departure from the Commonwealth of Nations in 1961.

The Sharpeville massacre contributed to the banning of the PAC and ANC as illegal organisations. The massacre was one of the catalysts for a shift from passive resistance to armed resistance by these organisations. The foundation of Poqo, the military wing of the PAC, and Umkhonto we Sizwe, the military wing of the ANC, followed shortly afterwards.

Not all reactions were negative: embroiled in its opposition to the Civil Rights Movement, the Mississippi House of Representatives voted for a resolution supporting the South African government &quot;for its steadfast policy of segregation and the [staunch] adherence to their traditions in the face of overwhelming external agitation.&quot; The resolution passed 78–8 in the Mississippi House of Representatives and 45–0 in the Mississippi State Senate.

==Commemoration==
Since 1994, 21 March has been commemorated as Human Rights Day in South Africa.

Sharpeville was the site selected by President Nelson Mandela for the signing into law of the Constitution of South Africa on 10 December 1996.

In 1998, the Truth and Reconciliation Commission (TRC) found that the police actions constituted &quot;gross human rights violations in that excessive force was unnecessarily used to stop a gathering of unarmed people.&quot;

On 21 March 2002, the 42nd anniversary of the massacre, a memorial was opened by former President Nelson Mandela as part of the Sharpeville Human Rights Precinct.

In 2024, the area where the massacre occurred and the memorial became a World Heritage Site, known as Nelson Mandela Legacy Sites.

== International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination ==
UNESCO marks 21 March as the yearly International Day for the Elimination of Racial Discrimination, in memory of the massacre.

==References in art and literature==
The Afrikaner poet Ingrid Jonker mentioned the Sharpeville Massacre in her verse.

The event was an inspiration for painter Oliver Lee Jackson in his &quot;Sharpeville Series&quot; from the 1970s.

Ingrid de Kok was a child living on a mining compound near Johannesburg where her father worked at the time of the Sharpeville massacre. In her poem &quot;Our Sharpeville&quot; she reflects on the atrocity through the eyes of a child.

Max Roach&#x27;s 1960 album &quot;We Insist! Freedom Now Suite&quot; includes the composition &quot;Tears for Johannesburg&quot; in response to the massacre.

South African artist Gavin Jantjes dedicated several prints in his series &quot;A South African Colouring Book&quot; (1974–75) to the Sharpeville Massacre. Iconic reportage photographs of scattering protesters are arranged alongside stenciled and handwritten captions pulled from news reporting of the unfolding event.

The massacre is referenced in the 1992 book Tandia, by South African author Bryce Courtenay.

<text>Favorite son (or favorite daughter) is a political term.
At the quadrennial American national political party conventions, a state delegation sometimes nominates a presidential candidate from the state, or less often from the state&#x27;s region, who is not a viable candidate in the view of other delegations, and votes for this candidate in the initial ballot. The technique allows state leaders to negotiate with leading candidates in exchange for the delegation&#x27;s support in subsequent ballots.

Serious candidates usually, but not always, avoided campaigning in favorite sons&#x27; states. If a party&#x27;s leader in a state, usually the governor, was unsure of whom to support, as the favorite son the state party could avoid disputes. Conversely, a party leader who has chosen a candidate might become a favorite son to keep other candidates&#x27; campaigns out of the state, or prevent a rival local politician from becoming a favorite son. The favorite son may explicitly state that the candidacy is not viable, or that the favorite son is not a candidate at all. The favorite son may hope to receive the vice-presidential nomination, Cabinet post or other job, increase support for the favorite son&#x27;s region or policies, or just the publicity from being nominated at the convention.

The technique was widely used in the 19th and early 20th centuries. Since nationwide campaigns by candidates and binding primary elections have replaced brokered conventions, the technique has fallen out of use, as party rule changes in the early 1970s required candidates to have nominations from more than one state.
A politician whose electoral appeal derives from their native state, rather than their political views is called a &quot;favorite son&quot;. For example, in the United States, a presidential candidate will usually win the support of their home state(s). A particularly notable instance of this occurred in 1984, when challenger Walter Mondale lost 49 of 50 states against popular incumbent Ronald Reagan, winning only his home state of Minnesota.

<text>Pierre Isaac Isidore Mendès France (; 11 January 190718 October 1982) was a French politician who served as prime minister of France for eight months from 1954 to 1955. As a member of the Radical Party, he headed a government supported by a coalition of Gaullists (RPF), moderate socialists (UDSR), Christian democrats (MRP) and liberal-conservatives (CNIP). His main priority was ending the Indochina War, which had already cost 92,000 lives, with 114,000 wounded and 28,000 captured on the French side. Public opinion polls showed that, in February 1954, only 7% of the French people wanted to continue the fight to regain Indochina out of the hands of the Communists, led by Ho Chi Minh and his Viet Minh movement. At the 1954 Geneva Conference, Mendès France negotiated a deal that gave the Viet Minh control of Vietnam north of the seventeenth parallel, and allowed him to pull out all French forces. He is considered one of the most prominent statesmen of the French Fourth Republic.

==Early life==
Mendès France was born on 11 January 1907 in Paris, the son of a textile merchant from Limoges. He was descended from Portuguese Jews who settled in France in the 16th century. He studied at the École des sciences politiques and the Faculty of Law of Paris, graduating with a doctorate in law and becoming the youngest member of the Paris bar association in 1926, at age 19. In 1924, Mendès France joined the Radical Party, the traditional party of the French middle-class centre-left (not to be confused with the mainstream SFIO, often called the Socialist Party). He married Lili Cicurel, the niece of Salvator Cicurel.

==Third Republic and World War II==

In 1932, Mendès France was elected member of the Chamber of Deputies for the Eure department; he was the Assembly&#x27;s youngest member. In 1936 he came within 700 votes of losing to Modeste Legouez, the president of the radical agrarian group the Comités de défense paysanne in what he said was his hardest electoral fight. His ability was soon recognized, and in 1938 the government of Léon Blum appointed him Under Secretary of State for Finance.

In October 1940, France was put on trial by the Vichy regime at the courthouse in Clermont-Ferrand for desertion after he boarded the liner SS &quot;Massilia&quot; for Casablanca in Morocco to continue the fight against the Nazis. He was imprisoned for desertion. He escaped and succeeded in reaching Britain, where he joined the Free French forces led by Charles de Gaulle. Mendès France later described his trial, conviction and subsequent escape in the famous documentary &quot;The Sorrow and the Pity&quot;.

During the latter years of the war, Mendès France served in the Free French Air Forces and flew in a dozen bombing raids. After the Liberation of Paris in August 1944, he was appointed Minister for National Economy in the French provisional government by de Gaulle. He later headed the French delegation to the 1944 United Nations Monetary and Financial Conference at Bretton Woods.

Mendès France soon fell out with the Finance Minister, René Pleven. Mendès France supported state regulation of wages and prices to control inflation, while Pleven favoured generally &quot;laissez-faire&quot; policies. When de Gaulle sided with Pleven, Mendès France resigned. Nonetheless, de Gaulle valued Mendès France&#x27;s abilities, and appointed him as a director of the International Bank for Reconstruction and Development, and as French representative to the United Nations Economic and Social Council.

==Fourth Republic==

In 1947, after democratic French politics resumed under the Fourth Republic, Mendès France was re-elected to the National Assembly. He first tried to form a government in June 1953, but was unable to gain the numbers in the Assembly. From 1950 he had been a consistent opponent of French colonialism, and by 1954 France was becoming hopelessly embroiled in major colonial conflicts: the First Indochina War and the Algerian War of Independence. When French forces were defeated by the Vietnamese Communists at Dien Bien Phu in June 1954, the government of Joseph Laniel resigned, and Mendès France formed a government with support from the centre-right.

Mendès France immediately negotiated an agreement with Ho Chi Minh, the Vietnamese Communist leader. There was, he said, no choice but total withdrawal from Indochina, and the Assembly supported him by 471 votes to 14. Nevertheless, nationalist opinion was shocked, and Roman Catholic opinion opposed abandoning the Vietnamese believers to Communism. A tirade of abuse, much of it anti-Semitic, was directed at Mendès France. Jean-Marie Le Pen, then a Poujadist member of the Assembly, described his &quot;patriotic, almost physical repulsion&quot; for Mendès France.

Undeterred, Mendès France next came to an agreement with Habib Bourguiba, the nationalist leader in Tunisia, for the independence of that colony by 1956, and began discussions with the nationalist leaders in Morocco for a French withdrawal. He also favoured concessions to the nationalists in Algeria; but the presence of a million &quot;Pied-noirs&quot; there left the colonial power no easy way to extricate itself from that situation. The future mercenary Bob Denard was convicted in 1954 and sentenced to fourteen months in prison for an assassination attempt against Mendès France.

Mendès France hoped that the Radical Party would become the party of modernization and renewal in French politics, replacing the SFIO. An advocate of greater European integration, he helped bring about the formation of the Western European Union, and proposed far-reaching economic reform. He also favoured defence co-operation with other European countries, but the National Assembly rejected the proposal for a European Defence Community, mainly because of misgivings about Germany&#x27;s participation.

His cabinet fell in February 1955. In 1956 he served as Minister of State in the cabinet headed by the SFIO leader Guy Mollet, but resigned over Mollet&#x27;s handling of the Algerian War, which was coming to dominate French politics. His split over Algeria with Edgar Faure, leader of the conservative wing of the Radical Party, led to Mendès France resigning as party leader in 1957.

==Fifth Republic==
Like most of the French left, Mendès France opposed de Gaulle&#x27;s seizure of power in May 1958, when the mounting crisis in Algeria brought about a breakdown in the Fourth Republic system and the creation of a Fifth Republic. He led the &quot;Union of Democratic Forces&quot;, an anti-Gaullist group, but in the November 1958 elections he lost his seat in the Assembly. After being expelled from the Radical Party, whose majority faction supported de Gaulle, in late 1959 he joined the Autonomous Socialist Party (PSA), a breakaway group from the SFIO.

In April 1960, the PSA merged with several other groups to form the Unified Socialist Party (PSU). He made an unsuccessful bid to regain his seat in the National Assembly representing Eure in the 1962 election.

In 1967 he returned to the Assembly as a PSU member for the Isère, but again lost his seat in the 1968 landslide election victory of the Gaullist party UDR. Mendès France and the PSU expressed sympathy for the sentiments and actions of the student rioters during the events of May 1968, a position unusual for a politician of his age and status. One year later, Pompidou&#x27;s socialist opponent in the presidential election of 1969, Gaston Defferre of the SFIO, designated him his preferred Prime Minister prior to the election. The two campaigned together in what was the first – and so far only – dual &quot;ticket&quot; in a French presidential election. Defferre gained only 5% of the vote and was eliminated in the election&#x27;s first round. When François Mitterrand formed a new Socialist Party in 1971, Mendès France supported him, but did not attempt another political comeback. He lived long enough to see Mitterrand elected president.

<text>An intermission, also known as an interval in British and Indian English, is a break between parts of a performance or production, such as for a theatrical play, opera, concert, or film screening. It should not be confused with an entr&#x27;acte (French: &quot;between acts&quot;), which, in the 18th century, was a sung, danced, spoken, or musical performance that occurs between any two acts, that is unrelated to the main performance, and that thus in the world of opera and musical theater became an orchestral performance that spans an intermission and leads, without a break, into the next act.

Jean-François Marmontel and Denis Diderot both viewed the intermission as a period in which the action did not in fact stop, but continued off-stage. &quot;The interval is a rest for the spectators; not for the action,&quot; wrote Marmontel in 1763. &quot;The characters are deemed to continue acting during the interval from one act to another.&quot; However, intermissions are more than just dramatic pauses that are parts of the shape of a dramatic structure. They also exist for more mundane reasons, such as that it is hard for audience members to concentrate for more than two hours at a stretch, and actors and performers (for live action performances at any rate) need to rest. They also afford opportunity for scene and costume changes. Performance venues take advantage of them to sell food and drink.

Psychologically, intermissions allow audiences to pause their suspension of disbelief and return to reality, and are a period during which they can engage critical faculties that they have suspended during the performance itself.

== Plays ==
The term &quot;Broadway Bladder&quot; names &quot;the alleged need of a Broadway audience to urinate every 75 minutes&quot;. Broadway Bladder, and other considerations (such as how much revenue a theater would lose at its bar if there were no intermissions), govern the placement of intermissions within performances, and their existence in performances, such as plays, that were not written/created with intermissions in mind.

=== William Shakespeare ===
The plays of William Shakespeare were originally intended for theater performance without intermissions. The placement of intermissions within those plays in modern performances is thus a matter for the play&#x27;s director. Reviewer Peter Holland analyzed the placement of intermissions in 1997:
* Of &quot;The Winter&#x27;s Tale&quot; he noted that there was &quot;as natural a break as anyone could wish for&quot; before the speech of Time as Chorus, and that he had never seen a production that placed an intermission other than at that point.
* Trevor Nunn&#x27;s production of &quot;Measure for Measure&quot; in 1991 is given as an example of intermissions placed in the middle of a scene. It stopped halfway through act 3 scene 1, moving some of the lines from later in the scene to before the intermission.
* Performances of &quot;King Lear&quot;, he observed, often place the intermission &quot;disproportionately late&quot;, after the blinding of Gloucester.
* The 1991 RSC production of &quot;Julius Caesar&quot; directed by Stephen Pimlott is pointed out as noteworthy for its extraordinary intermission length. Pimlott had placed the intermission after act 4 scene 1, after the action leaves Rome. This allowed the striking of the scenery. But it took sometimes as much as forty minutes for stage crew to remove the scenery, which comprised a &quot;massive set of columns and a doorway&quot; designed by Tobias Hoheisel, a period that was longer than the remaining length of the performance, some thirty-five minutes.

Many modern productions of Shakespeare plays have thus eschewed the introduction of an intermission, choosing instead to perform them straight through, as originally intended.

=== Kabuki ===
The intermissions in Kabuki theater can last up to an hour. Because this often results in people returning to their seats several minutes after the performance has resumed, playwrights generally take to writing &quot;filler&quot; scenes for the starts of acts, containing characters and dialogue that are not important to the overall story.

=== Noh ===
In the Noh theatrical tradition, interludes called nakairi are staged between the first and second halves of a performance, during which time kyōgen actors sum up the plot or otherwise further the action through performances known as aikyōgen. These interludes also give the main actors a chance to change costumes and rest. 

== Films ==
Intermissions in early films had a practical purpose: they were needed to facilitate the changing of reels. When &quot;Les Amours de la reine Élisabeth&quot; (&quot;The Loves of Queen Elizabeth&quot;), starring Sarah Bernhardt, opened on July 12, 1912, in the Lyceum Theatre in New York City, the four reel film was shown in four acts, with an intermission at each reel change.

The technology improved, but as movies became progressively longer, the intermission fulfilled other needs. It gave the audience a breather, and provided the theater management an opportunity to entice patrons to its profitable concession stand. A well-known 1957 animated musical snipe suggested, before the main feature in theaters and during intermission at drive-ins, &quot;let&#x27;s all go to the lobby to get ourselves a treat&quot;. During the 3D film trend of the early 1950s, intermissions were a necessity because even though many theaters used two projectors that could skip intermission by shifting from one reel to the other, 3D films required the use of both projectors – one for each stereoscopic image – and so needed an intermission to change the reels on both projectors.

The built-in intermission has been phased out of Hollywood films, the victim of the demand to pack in more screenings and advances in projector technology which make reel switches either unnoticeable or non-existent (such as digital projection, in which reels do not exist).

=== Indian cinema ===
Despite the phasing out of intermissions in the West, they have remained prevalent in India. There is a mass reluctance to abolish intermissions as they bring a large revenue to cinemas through customers buying snacks during these periods. The films &quot;Sangam&quot; and &quot;Mera Naam Joker&quot; had two intermissions each. Very few Indian films have been screened without intermissions, including &quot;Dhobi Ghat&quot;, &quot;Delhi Belly&quot;, &quot;That Girl In Yellow Boots&quot; and &quot;Trapped&quot;. Forced intermissions are common during screenings of western films in India.

Indian films shown in cinemas in the United Kingdom also commonly include intermissions, yet in the United States and Canada, these films play from start to finish without any pauses in between. Many Indian films released on DVD include the &quot;intermission&quot; card for cinematic screening.

<text>Mount Alberta is a mountain located in the upper Athabasca River Valley of Jasper National Park, Alberta, Canada. J. Norman Collie named the mountain in 1898 after Princess Louise Caroline Alberta. It is the most difficult of the 11,000ers from a climbing point of view.

Mount Alberta is the fifth-highest peak of the Canadian Rockies and the third highest in Alberta. It is situated southeast of the town of Jasper, just beyond the Northern extent of the Columbia Icefield. According to the Climber&#x27;s Guide, Mount Alberta is &quot;One of the finest peaks in the Rockies, a singular uplift that is difficult on all sides.&quot;

== Climbing ==
;History
The first ascent was made in 1925 by members of the Japanese Alpine Club: S. Hashimoto, H. Hatano, T. Hayakawa, Y. Maki, Y.Mita, N. Okabe. The team was guided by Hans Fuhrer, H. Kohler and J. Weber, and the leader of the team was Maki. This team consisted of four Keio University alpine club members and two Gakushuin University alpine club members. They started climbing on July 21, 1925. After some difficulty in dealing with an overhang and a steep series of ledges for 16 hours, they reached the top and ceremoniously planted an ice axe. The ice axe was left as a symbol of their achievement. The second party that achieved the ascent found this ice axe 23 years later, and brought it back to the American Alpine Club in New York. The handle of the ice axe had been broken by the ice and rocks. In 1969, the handle was found by a Japanese party, and the two parts were put together in Tokyo in 1997. This ice axe is now exhibited in Jasper Yellowhead Museum.

The second ascent was completed in 1948 by Americans Fred Ayers and John Oberlin. In 1958, the first ascent by a Canadian team was completed by Neil Brown, Hans Gmoser, Leo Grillmair, Heinz Kahl and Sarka Spinkova.

<doc id="359784" wikidata="Q1062504" url="?curid=359784" title="Shoutcast">
<text>Shoutcast (formerly SHOUTcast) is a service for streaming media over the internet to media players, using its own cross-platform proprietary software. It allows digital audio content, primarily in MP3 or High-Efficiency Advanced Audio Coding format. The most common use of Shoutcast is for creating or listening to Internet audio broadcasts; however, there are also video streams. The software is available to use for free or as a paid cloud service with additional professional features.

In the early days of esports for video games, Shoutcast was used by some to stream play-by-play commentary, leading to the term &quot;shoutcaster&quot; as a name for esports commentators.

==History==
Created in 1998, Shoutcast&#x27;s streaming protocol uses metadata tags and responses that all start with ICY, which stands for &quot;I Can Yell.&quot; Nullsoft was purchased by AOL on June 1, 1999.

On January 14, 2014, AOL sold Nullsoft to Belgian online radio aggregator Radionomy Group; no financial details were publicly announced. In 2018 the software was rebranded from its original name of SHOUTcast to Shoutcast. In 2020 Radionomy shut down its own streaming service and migrated to the Shoutcast platform.

==Software==
The Shoutcast software uses a client–server model, with each component communicating via a network protocol that intermingles audio or video data with metadata such as song titles and the station name. It uses HTTP as a transport protocol.

Shoutcast servers and clients are available for FreeBSD, Linux, macOS, Microsoft Windows, and Solaris. There are client-only versions for Android, BlackBerry OS, iOS (iPad, iPhone), Palm OS and webOS (Radio Hibiki), PlayStation Portable, Windows Mobile, Symbian S60 and UIQ, Nintendo DS (DSOrganize), and Wii.

The output format is supported by multiple clients, including Nullsoft&#x27;s own Winamp as well as Amarok, Exaile, foobar2000, iTunes, Songbird, Totem, XMMS, and Zinf. If the client does not support the Shoutcast protocol, then the Shoutcast server sends the stream without the metadata, allowing it to be heard and viewed in clients such as Windows Media Player. Shoutcast servers are usually linked to by means of playlist files, which are small text files (usually with extensions .pls or .m3u) that contain the URL of the Shoutcast server. When that URL is visited in a Web browser which identifies itself as Mozilla-compatible (as most do), the server will return a generated Shoutcast server info/status page, rather than streaming audio.

In 2010 VideoLAN dropped support for Shoutcast from VLC media player at AOL&#x27;s request, as Shoutcast&#x27;s license forbade its integration into other software that contained free or open-source components, additionally specifying that it &quot;forces us to integrate the spyware and adware based Shoutcast Radio Toolbar inside your browser&quot;. An alternative to Shoutcast is Icecast

==Popularity==
A feature of Shoutcast servers is the ability to optionally publish server information, including the current number of listeners, in a directory of stations that Shoutcast maintains on their website. Site visitors can pick a station to listen to and download a playlist file for use in their own Shoutcast-capable media player.

In 2011 up to 900,000 concurrent listeners could be seen on public Shoutcast streams during peak hours. The maximum and minimum number of listeners fluctuates widely during a day, with roughly three times as many listeners during peak hours as at low use times.

 85,317 stations were streaming using Shoutcast.

<doc id="359786" wikidata="Q167028" url="?curid=359786" title="David Wilson, Baron Wilson of Tillyorn">
<text>David Clive Wilson, Baron Wilson of Tillyorn (, born 14 February 1935) is a retired British administrator, diplomat and Sinologist. He was the penultimate Commander-in-Chief and 27th Governor of Hong Kong (from 1987 to 1992). He served as Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland, the British Monarch&#x27;s representative to the Assembly, in 2010 and 2011.
He is also one of two living former governors of Hong Kong, alongside Chris Patten. He retired from the House of Lords on 12 February 2021 after sitting as a crossbencher for over 28 years.

==Early life and career==
Wilson was born in Alloa in Scotland on 14 February 1935 and was educated at Trinity College, Glenalmond, and Keble College, Oxford (1955–58, Master of Arts), and the School of Oriental and African Studies, University of London (PhD in contemporary Chinese history, 1973). He studied Chinese at the University of Hong Kong from 1960 to 1962 and then served in the British Mission in Beijing. He is fluent in Mandarin and has mastered basic Cantonese and spent 10 of his 30 years as a diplomat in China.

In 1968 Wilson resigned from the Foreign and Commonwealth Office to edit &quot;The China Quarterly&quot; at the School of Oriental and African Studies. After rejoining the Diplomatic Service in 1974 he worked in the Cabinet Office and then, from 1977 to 1981, as Political Adviser to Sir Murray MacLehose, then Governor of Hong Kong. Following that he became Head of Southern European Department in the FCO and then Assistant Under Secretary for Asia and the Pacific during which time he was head of the British side of the Working Group engaged in drafting the 1984 Sino-British Joint Declaration on Hong Kong and then, in 1984, the first Senior British Representative on the Sino-British Joint Liaison Group (中英聯合聯絡小組) set up under the Joint Declaration. When Sir Edward Youde died in Beijing on 5 December 1986, Wilson replaced him to become the Governor of Hong Kong on 9 April 1987.

==Hong Kong governorship==

As governor, Wilson had to deal with the fallout in Hong Kong from Black Monday, in which the colony&#x27;s stock exchange had been among the most hit by the financial crash along with the 1989 Tiananmen Square protests in Beijing. He also encountered the Vietnamese refugee problem, which steadily grew worse and led to the 1988 policy of repatriating those found not to qualify for refugee status (see bắt đầu từ nay). In October 1989, Wilson proposed, in the Governor&#x27;s Annual Policy Address, the building of an airport on Lantau Island, known as the Rose Garden Project (玫瑰園計劃, see Hong Kong International Airport). The proposal was created out of concern that Kai Tak Airport, which had been in use since the beginning of aviation in Hong Kong, was not equipped to handle modern aviation needs.

In December 1991, Britain announced the removal of Wilson as the governor, who had been widely criticised by Hong Kong&#x27;s pro-democratic camp, three months after their strong performance in Hong Kong&#x27;s first direct elections to the Legislative Council. Wilson left Hong Kong in June 1992 following the completion of his five-year term as governor. Before his retirement Wilson embarked on political reforms that paved the way for eighteen legislators of the Legislative Council to be directly elected by the people of Hong Kong.

Wilson was succeeded by Chris Patten, who was then-British Prime Minister John Major&#x27;s Conservative ally, and had risen to become Chairman of the Conservative Party, and a former Member of the Parliament who was recently defeated in the general election before was being appointed.

===Name in Chinese===
When Wilson studied Mandarin Chinese at The University of Hong Kong, he was given the Chinese name Wei Dewei or Ngai Tak-Ngai (); &quot;Wei&quot; was short for &quot;Wilson&quot;, while &quot;Dewei&quot; is a Chinese transliteration of David. However, when he arrived in Hong Kong to take up the position of Governor of Hong Kong, it was noted that the Cantonese pronunciation of his earlier name sounded almost nothing like his actual name.

Nicholas Kristof of &quot;The New York Times&quot; commented that Wilson&#x27;s previous Chinese name sounded too much like &quot;hypocrisy to the extent of danger&quot; (偽得危). Kristof also noted that the surname and the third character can each be divided into components meaning &quot;1,800 female ghosts&quot; (千八女鬼). According to Chan Chung-kwong of RTHK, some locals referred to the name as &quot;two ghosts knocking at the door&quot; (雙鬼拍門), which is unlucky and inappropriate for a governor&#x27;s name.

When Wilson assumed his position as Governor of Hong Kong, he changed his Chinese name to Wai Yik-Shun (), the Cantonese Chinese pronunciation of which is more similar to his English name. The new name also has a more favourable meaning and was composed of 33 strokes, said to be a lucky number.

==Post-governorship==
After his governorship and elevation to a life peerage with the title Baron Wilson of Tillyorn, of Finzean in the District of Kincardine and Deeside and of Fanling in Hong Kong in 1992, Wilson became the chairman of the energy company Scottish Hydro Electric plc. (later Scottish and Southern Energy) based in Perth, Scotland from 1993 to 2000. He was a member of the board of the British Council (and chairman of its Scottish Committee) from 1993 to 2002; a director of the Martin Currie Pacific Trust from 1993 to 2002 and Chairman of the Trustees of the National Museums of Scotland from 2002 to 2006. In 1996 he was appointed a vice-president of the Royal Scottish Geographical Society; and he was the Chancellor of the University of Aberdeen from 1997 to 2013, succeeded by the Duchess of Rothesay. He was president of the Bhutan Society of the UK (1993–2008), the Hong Kong Society (1994– ) and the Hong Kong Association (1994– ). Wilson was made a Knight of the Thistle in 2000. He served as Master of Peterhouse, Cambridge from 2002 to 2008. He was President of the Royal Society of Edinburgh from October 2008 to October 2011, when he was succeeded by Sir John Arbuthnott. In January 2010 he was appointed Lord High Commissioner to the General Assembly of the Church of Scotland for 2010.

Wilson informed the Clerk of the Parliaments that he would retire from the House of Lords on 12 February 2021 under the provisions of the House of Lords Reform Act 2014.

==Places named after him==
The 78-kilometre Wilson Trail, containing ten hiking segments aligned north–south in Hong Kong, is named after him, as is the Lord Wilson Heritage Trust (衛奕信勳爵文物信託) established in December 1992 to preserve and conserve Hong Kong&#x27;s heritage.

==Personal life==

Wilson married Natasha Helen Mary Alexander, daughter of Bernard Gustav Alexander, in 1967 and they have two sons, Peter and Andrew.

==Views==
Wilson defended Hong Kong Police during 2014 Hong Kong protests, claiming the actions taken by the police were &quot;largely proportionate&quot;. During the 2019 Hong Kong protests, he was against the British government&#x27;s interference into the situation, and stated &quot;we cannot and should not try to tell the Hong Kong Government what to do&quot; in a speech given at the House of Lords. He believes such demonstrations &quot;started peacefully&quot; with &quot;a majority of young people who were clearly well-intentioned and concerned about their own future&quot;, but continued with an increasing amount of violence; he believed the police brutality during the event should be remedied, but &quot;it is worth remembering not only that the police have been under enormous strain week after week, weekend after weekend, but that their families have also been threatened&quot;.

Wilson was criticised by the pro-democracy camp for not moving more quickly towards a fully elected Legislature based on universal suffrage and for paying too much attention to the views of the Government in China in agreeing arrangements for a process of increasing the number of fully elected seats up to and beyond the transfer of sovereignty in 1997.

<doc id="359796" wikidata="Q1753999" url="?curid=359796" title="The Revolution Will Not Be Televised">
<text>&quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot; is a satirical poem and Black Liberation song by Gil Scott-Heron. Scott-Heron first recorded it for his 1970 album &quot;Small Talk at 125th and Lenox&quot;, on which he recited the lyrics, accompanied by congas and bongo drums. A re-recorded version, with a three-piece band, was the B-side to Scott-Heron&#x27;s first single, &quot;Home Is Where the Hatred Is&quot;, from his album &quot;Pieces of a Man&quot; (1971). This recording was still sparsely instrumented, but now, in addition to drums, featured a driving bassline played by Jerry Jemmott and, somewhat unconventionally, a jazz-infused flute line by Hubert Laws throughout, acting as a countermelody to Heron&#x27;s passionately delivered spoken word vocal. This sparse and rhythm-driven backdrop to Heron&#x27;s incisive vocal, held down by Bernard Purdie&#x27;s tight and explosive funk drumming, and eschewing thick chordal accompaniment, foreshadowed musical developments in hip-hop in the decade to come.

It was also included on his compilation album, &quot;The Revolution Will Not Be Televised&quot; (1974). All these releases were issued on the Flying Dutchman Productions record label.

The song&#x27;s lyrics either mention or allude to several television series, advertising slogans and icons of entertainment and news coverage that serve as examples of what &quot;the revolution will not&quot; be or do. The song is a response to the spoken-word piece &quot;When the Revolution Comes&quot; by The Last Poets, from their eponymous debut album, which opens with the line &quot;When the revolution comes some of us will probably catch it on TV&quot;.

It was inducted to the National Recording Registry in 2005.

In 2021, it was ranked at No. 258 on &quot;Rolling Stone&quot;″s &quot;500 Greatest Songs of All Time&quot;. In 2025, the publication ranked the song at number 14 on its list of &quot;The 100 Best Protest Songs of All Time.&quot;

<doc id="359797" wikidata="Q472323" url="?curid=359797" title="Ranasinghe Premadasa">
<text>Sri Lankabhimanya Ranasinghe Premadasa ( &quot;Raṇasiṃha Premadāsa&quot;; &quot;Raṇaciṅka Pirēmatācā&quot;; 23 June 1924 – 1 May 1993) was the third President of Sri Lanka from 2 January 1989 until his assassination in 1993. He also served as Prime Minister of Sri Lanka from 6 February 1978 to 2 January 1989. This makes Premadasa the longest-serving uninterrupted Prime Minister of Sri Lanka, having served in the post for nearly 11 years. He was the first person to be conferred with Sri Lanka&#x27;s highest civilian award, the Sri Lankabhimanya in 1986 by President J. R. Jayewardene.

==Early life==
Ranasinghe Premadasa was born on 23 June 1924 at Dias Place, Colombo 11, to the family of Richard Ranasinghe (Ranasinghe Mudalali) of Kosgoda and Battuwita Jayasinghe Arachchige Ensina Hamine of Batuwita, Horana. Premadasa was the oldest of five children, three sisters, and one brother. His father was engaged in the transport business in Colombo employing rickshaws.

He received his early education at the Purwarama temple under Ven. Welitara Sri Pannananda and secondary education at Lorenz College, Skinner&#x27;s Road, South Maradana and at St. Joseph&#x27;s College, Colombo under Rector Fr. Le Goc.
At age fifteen, Premadasa started the Sucharita Children&#x27;s Society, which later became the Sucharitha Movement, a volunteers organisation with the objectives of uplifting the economic, social and spiritual development of the low-income people living in shanty areas of the capital. He was the full-time organizer of the community development project in the area in 1939. These youth who enrolled in his development movement refrained from taking liquor and avoided smoking and gambling. Premadasa too was a teetotaler.

==Early political career==
=== Ceylon Labour Party ===
Allying with A. E. Goonesinghe, the founder leader of the Ceylon Labour movement, Premadasa started his political career in 1946 joining the Ceylon Labour Party as a full-time member and campaigned for Goonesinghe in the 1947 general election. In 1950, he was elected to the Colombo Municipal Council as a member of San Sebastian&#x27;s Ward.

=== United National Party ===
Having realized the limited future prospects in the Labour Party in the mid-1950s, Premadasa supported Sir John Kotelawala&#x27;s attempts to remove the then-incumbent Mayor of Colombo, Dr N. M. Perera of the Lanka Sama Samaja Party. In 1955, Premadasa succeeded T. Rudra as Deputy Mayor and joined the United National Party in 1956 following the successful removal of N. M. Perera as Mayor of Colombo in February 1956.

From the UNP, Premadasa contested the 1956 general election from the Ruwanwella electorate but lost to N. M. Perera. Following his defeat, he joined J. R. Jayewardene working for the party reorganization under Dudley Senanayake and served as the secretary of the Religious Affairs Committee of the Buddhist Council appointed by the government to organize the 2500th Buddha Jayanthi celebrations. The following year he joined the protest march to Kandy on 3 October, which had been organized by J. R. Jayewardene. The march was disrupted at Imbulgoda by thugs led by S. D. Bandaranayake.

Premadasa was elected as the third Member of Parliament from Colombo Central in the March 1960 general election. The short-lived Dudley Senanayake government was defeated in three months and in the July 1960 general election that followed he polled fourth in the three-member constituency of Colombo Central. In 1961, he re-entered the Colombo Municipal Council having been elected from the Cinnamon Gardens Ward and served till 1965. During this time, he worked to open preschools for poor families and initiated vocational training centres in sewing and tailoring for the youth.

===Minister of Local Government (1965–1970)===
Premadasa successfully contested the Colombo Central electorate in the 1965 general election and was elected to parliament and appointed as Chief Government Whip and Parliamentary Secretary to the Minister of Local Government, M. Tiruchelvam. When Tiruchelvam resigned in 1968 after the Ilankai Tamil Arasu Kachchi left Dudley Senanayake&#x27;s government, Premadasa was promoted as Minister of Local Government and became a minister in Senanayake&#x27;s cabinet. During his tenure, he instituted a bridges programme using pre-stressed concrete components, created the Maligawatta Housing Scheme and became known in the local governments across the island. Premadasa turned Radio Ceylon, the oldest radio station in South Asia, into a public corporation – the Ceylon Broadcasting Corporation on 5 January 1967.

===Opposition and the Citizens Front (1970–1977)===
In the following 1970 general election, Premadasa was elected as the first Member of Parliament for Colombo Central and sat in the opposition with J. R. Jayewardene, the Leader of the Opposition. Premadasa was appointed Chief Opposition Whip. Furthermore, he was elected chairman of the General Assembly of the Commonwealth Inter-Parliamentary Association held in Australia.

Premadasa was a member of the Constituent Assembly which drafted the constitution of 1972. Premadasa called for reforms of the party which Dudley Senanayake refused, resulting in Premadasa resigning from the party working committee. He went on to form the &quot;Samastha Lanka Puravesi Peramuna&quot;, known generally as the &quot;Puravesi Peramuna&quot; or &quot;Citizens Front&quot;. Building up the Citizens Front, he was in open conflict with Senanayake who had recently healed a rift with Jayawardane. Amidst this conflict, Senanayake died on 13 April 1973 following a heart attack and Senanayake loyalists found fault with Premadasa. Jayawardane, who became UNP leader came to terms with Premadasa, who stopped the Citizens Front and returned to fully support the UNP, driving up its membership at grassroot levels and becoming the Deputy Leader of the party.

===Minister of Local Government, Housing and Construction (1977–1978)===
Premadasa was re-elected as the first member of parliament for Colombo Central in the general election in 1977 and was appointed the Leader of the House and the Minister of Local Government, Housing and Construction.

==Prime minister==
In the following year, when J. R. Jayewardene became the first executive president of Sri Lanka, he appointed Premadasa as prime minister. Premadasa began to define the new role of the prime minister under an executive president. He took residence at Temple Trees, retained the use of the Prime Minister&#x27;s Lodge and established a new prime minister&#x27;s office at Sirimathipaya. He began representing Sri Lanka internationally, having led the Sri Lankan delegation to the Commonwealth Heads of Government Meeting in 1979, where he secured British funding for the construction of the Victoria Dam. He headed the Sri Lankan delegation to the United Nations General Assembly in 1980 where he addressed the general assembly.

Continuing to hold the portfolios of Local Government, Housing and Construction, he initiated his political program, shelter for the poor, after the United Nations declared a Year of Shelter. His proposal to declare 1987 as the International Year of Shelter for the Homeless was unanimously accepted at the 37th session of the United Nations General Assembly. Other policies included &quot;Jana Saviya&quot;, the instrument he used to help the poor, a foster parents scheme, the &quot;Gam Udawa&quot; project with which he tried to stir up the stupor in the villages, the mobile secretariat whereby he took the central government bureaucracy to the peasants, the Tower Hall Foundation for drama and music, and the pension schemes he initiated for the elder artistes. On the economic front, the garment industry project that he initiated became a forerunner in earning foreign exchange and provision of employment in the villages. Premadasa served as prime minister from 1978 to 1988, with little rifts with President Jayewardene with the exception of the latter&#x27;s signed the Indo-Sri Lanka Accord. Jayewardene decided to step down after his second term and Premadasa was nominated as the party candidate for the presidential election set for December 1988.

Premadasa was elected as the 2nd executive president of the country at the 1988 presidential election, gaining 2,569,199 (50.43%) votes and defeating former prime minister Sirimavo Bandaranaike, who came in second with 2,289,860 (44.95%) votes. Premadasa became the first non-Govigama politician to be appointed prime minister and elected president of Sri Lanka.

==Presidency==
Soon after being elected president, Premadasa dissolved parliament and called for fresh elections. In the 1989 parliamentary election in February the UNP gained 125 seats in parliament, forming a government with a majority in parliament. At the time he became president, the country faced both a civil war in the north and a communist insurgency in the south, both key issues Premadasa concentrated on, with particularly ruthless actions against the insurgents. The security forces brutally put down the revolt and killed many of its leaders.

===Monetary policy===
Premadasa also concentrated on a grassroots-level economic development drive, focusing on the provision of housing, poverty alleviation and the upliftment of the poor. He encouraged the building of model villages with clean water, transport infrastructure, schools and health centres. He encouraged the establishment of small-scale industries (mostly garment-related) in poor areas by giving factory owners low-interest loans and a share in textile quotas for the United States and Europe. The &quot;Gam Udāwa&quot; programme is one of his best-known achievements in this area, along with the &quot;Janasaviya&quot; programme that is today part of the &quot;Samurdhi&quot; scheme.

===JVP insurrection===

Appointing Ranjan Wijeratne as Minister of Foreign Affairs and State Minister for Defence, Premadasa had Wijeratne clamp down on the JVP insurgent activity in the south which had been paralyzing the state machinery and economic activity of the island since 1987 with its target killings, its unofficial curfews and work stoppages. Operation Combine launched by Wijeratne successfully challenged the insurgency by brutally suppressing and killing its leaders, including JVP leader Rohana Wijeweera by late 1989 and effectively ending the insurrection by early 1990.

===Civil War===

His handling of the country&#x27;s civil war was less successful. In the north, the Liberation Tigers of Tamil Eelam faced off against the Indian Peace Keeping Force. The Indian presence on the island was unpopular, and Premadasa requested India to pull out its troops. In order to force the IPKF to leave the island, he authorized a clandestine operation to supply arms to LTTE to fight the IPKF-backed Eelam People&#x27;s Revolutionary Liberation Front, a collusion that came to light in the report published by the Sri Lankan Presidential Commission to inquire into the 1992 assassination of Lieutenant General Denzil Kobbekaduwa. While the IPKF was recalled by New Delhi in 1990, the government&#x27;s war with the LTTE resumed, beginning Eelam War II, which ended in a stalemate five years later. The 1990 massacre of Sri Lankan Police officers, which occurred after the policemen were asked to surrender to the LTTE in Batticaloa at Premadasa&#x27;s request, was later established to have been performed with the same weapons he had supplied them.

===Impeachment attempt===
In September 1991, Premadasa faced an impeachment attempt in parliament led by his two formidable rivals in the UNP, Lalith Athulathmudali and Gamini Dissanayake. He defeated the attempt by adjourning Parliament and Speaker M. H. Mohamed dismissed the impeachment stating a lack of signatures after several parliamentarians who supported the impeachment later withdrew their support after facing threats. Premadasa expelled Athulathmudali and Dissanayake from the party, who then went on to form their own political party, the Democratic United National Front (DUNF).

===Country name change===
In 1992, Premadasa changed the country&#x27;s English name from Sri Lanka to Shri Lanka on the advice of soothsayers, who predicted it would improve the country&#x27;s fortunes. The change was reverted after his assassination in 1993.

==Assassination==

Ranasinghe Premadasa was killed along with 23 others on 1 May, Saturday, 1993, around 12.45 p.m. during UNP&#x27;s May Day rally in Colombo, by an LTTE suicide bomber. The explosion took place at Armour Street-Grandpass Junction in Hulftsdorp, Colombo while President Premadasa was unofficially supervising the procession as it was heading towards the Galle Face Green from Sugathadasa Stadium. The suicide bomber was later identified as Kulaveerasingam Veerakumar alias &#x27;Babu&#x27;, a close friend of the President&#x27;s valet E. M. P. Mohideen. He rode a bicycle towards the President, left it near the President&#x27;s Range Rover and walked towards the President when security personnel attempted to stop him. Despite this, Mohideen allowed him to get close to the President, when Veerakumar detonated the explosive device. Killed in the explosion were Mohideen, SSP Ronnie Gunasinghe and most of Premadasa&#x27;s personal staff. Another 38 people were injured in the bombing including seven who were seriously wounded. Confusion prevailed as it was unclear what had happened, with Premadasa and his security detail missing. His death was only confirmed two hours later by his personal physician when the remains of the president were identified by his ring and watch.

The site of the explosion was cleaned within hours before a proper investigation was conducted. The May Day parade continued even after the explosion for some time. An island-wide curfew was imposed hours after the assassination. Prime minister Dingiri Banda Wijetunga was sworn in as the acting president in the afternoon. The government did not announce the death of President Premadasa until 6 p.m. local time when state television Rupavahini broadcast a tape of BBC&#x27;s report of the incident. A period of national mourning was announced until the funeral. Police claimed that they recovered the severed head of a young man suspected to be the bomber, which was found to have a cyanide suicide capsule, bearing LTTE tradecraft in his mouth. Premadasa&#x27;s state funeral took place at Independence Square, Colombo on 9 May 1993.

==Legacy==

Amongst Sri Lankans, Premadasa has left behind a mixed legacy. While he was seen as a spokesperson of the poor, common man, his handling of the country&#x27;s two civil conflicts, the JVP insurrection and the Sri Lankan Civil War, have been heavily criticised.

The R. Premadasa International Cricket Stadium, which was built under Premadasa&#x27;s supervision in 1986, still remains named after him.

The Sri Lankabhimanya Ranasinghe Premadasa Memorial is a statue depicting Premadasa, which stands in Hulftsdorp, Colombo.

The Former president Sri Lankabhimanya Ranasinghe Premadasa Memorial Monument stands at the location of the bomb blast, at the junction of Armour Street and Grandpass Road in Hulftsdorp.

Ranasinghe Premadasa&#x27;s son, Sajith Premadasa, went on to become a politician in his own right. Sajith ran for presidency twice unsuccessfully in 2019 and 2024 winning 41.99% and 32.76% of the vote respectively. He is the current Leader of the Opposition representing the Samagi Jana Balawegaya political party, a breakaway party of the United National Party his father once led.

===In popular culture===
* The 1993 Indian Tamil-language film &quot;Gentleman&quot; was rewritten by the director S. Shankar based on the assassination of Ranasinghe Premadasa after a request by film producer K. T. Kunjumon. The film was in the post-production stage when Premadasa was assassinated, and the film was released on 30 July 1993.
* The 2013 Indian Hindi-language film &quot;Madras Cafe&quot;, which takes place during the Sri Lankan Civil War, refers to a Sri Lankan president being killed by a suicide bomber. While the film never names Premadasa, he is the only Sri Lankan president to be assassinated in this manner.

==Personal life==
Premadasa married Hema Wickramatunge, the only daughter of Mr and Mrs Wickramatunge Arachchige Charles Appuhamy of Bandarawela on 23 June 1964. They had a son, Sajith, and a daughter, Dulanjali. A hard worker, Premadasa was known for rising early and following a strict routine. He lived and worked from his private residence and office, Sucharitha even during his tenure as prime minister and president.

<text>The salamander letter was a controversial and widely believed forged document about the history of the Latter Day Saint movement.
The letter was one of hundreds of documents concerning the history of the Latter Day Saint movement that surfaced in the early 1980s. The salamander letter presented a view of the life of the movement&#x27;s founder, Joseph Smith, that stood sharply at odds with the commonly accepted version of the early progression of the church Smith established.

Initially accepted by some document experts and collectors, and rejected by others, the salamander letter generated much discussion and debate inside and outside the Latter Day Saint movement. Kenneth W. Rendell, a prominent dealer of historical papers, lent credence to the salamander letter by stating that the ink, paper, and postmark were all consistent with the period; he concluded that &quot;there is no indication that the document is a forgery.&quot; The document was later demonstrated to be a forgery created by Mark Hofmann, who had been responsible for the forgery of many other notable documents. Rendell then recast his conclusion, stating that while there was &quot;the absence of any indication of forgery in the letter itself, there was also no evidence that it was genuine.&quot;

==Contents==
The contents of the letter implied a magical aspect to Smith&#x27;s life, a controversial subject debated amongst scholars of Latter Day Saint history. The salamander letter was supposedly written by Martin Harris to W. W. Phelps, an early convert in the Latter Day Saint movement. Harris served for a short period of time as scribe for the translation of the golden plates, and assisted in the financing of the first printing of the Book of Mormon. A joint statement by Harris and two other men appears in the front of the Book of Mormon stating that he was shown by an angel the golden plates from which the book was translated.

The letter presented a version of the recovery of the golden plates which contrasted with the orthodox version of events as related by Joseph Smith and the Latter Day Saint movement, which would have, if true, confirmed some controversial aspects of Smith&#x27;s life. Smith had been accused of &quot;treasure digging&quot; and using a &quot;seer stone,&quot; which was later confirmed by the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church).

According to the letter, when Smith dug up the plates a &quot;salamander&quot; appeared, which transformed itself into a spirit that refused to give Smith the plates unless his brother, Alvin Smith, was also present. This would have been very difficult, as Alvin was dead at the time of the alleged appearance. This reference may have been an attempt by Hofmann to associate the recovery of the gold plates to a rumor that Alvin&#x27;s grave was dug up by Smith&#x27;s family to use Alvin&#x27;s remains in a magical ceremony.

Hofmann&#x27;s use of a salamander drew upon legends about certain animals having supernatural powers. Hofmann may have been inspired by the early anti-Mormon book, &quot;Mormonism Unvailed&quot; (1834), which claimed that a toad-like animal was rumored to have appeared to Smith in conjunction with the recovery of the plates.

:Yours Respect
:Martin Harris

==Initial assessments of authenticity==
The letter was initially deemed authentic by experienced document examiners, however this conclusion is disputed. Critics of the LDS Church have used the letter as an argument against the validity of the religion. The letter was useful to these organizations because it seemed to support the opinions of Reed Durham, D. Michael Quinn, and others regarding &quot;magical&quot; aspects of Smith&#x27;s religious experiences.

==Purchase and publicity==

The letter was initially offered to Don Schmidt of the LDS Church Historical Department on January 3, 1984, by Lyn Jacobs, who wanted to trade it for a $10 Mormon gold piece. Jacobs told Schmidt that he got the letter from a collector in the east, referred by Mark Hofmann. Jacobs later changed his offer to a trade for a copy of a Book of Commandments. This offer was also rejected. Jacobs also suggested that Brent Ashworth might have an interest in it, although Hofmann had already showed a transcript of it to him and he had declared it to be fake. The contents of the letter also seemed too similar to Howe&#x27;s &quot;Mormonism Unvailed&quot; to others in the LDS Church&#x27;s Historical Department. The letter was also offered to other interested parties, including Jerald and Sandra Tanner, prominent critics of Mormonism. Although the letter&#x27;s authenticity would have bolstered the Tanners&#x27; claims against the church, they expressed doubts as to its authenticity. A deal with the LDS Church was never reached. Hofmann finally sold the letter to Steven F. Christensen on January 6, 1984, for $40,000. Christensen wanted to try to authenticate it and then donate it to the LDS Church .

In the &quot;Church News&quot; on April 28, 1985, the LDS Church revealed the contents of the salamander letter. Alongside was included a First Presidency statement, quoting Gordon B. Hinckley: &quot;No one, of course, can be certain that Martin Harris wrote the document. However, at this point we accept the judgment of the examiner that there is no indication that it is a forgery. This does not preclude the possibility that it may have been forged at a time when the Church had many enemies. It is, however, an interesting document of the times.&quot; At about this same time, the church also released a letter to its high school seminary program for youth, suggesting that seminary teachers not encourage debate about the salamander letter, but that they should tactfully answer genuine questions on the subject. FARMS (a research group composed of Mormon scholars) published several articles which examined the salamander letter, such as, &quot;Why Might a Person in 1830 Connect an Angel With a Salamander?&quot;

==Suspicion and resolution==
Hofmann drew suspicion for discovering so many astounding documents that others had missed, including the so-called &quot;Oath of a Freeman&quot;, which he was attempting to sell to the Library of Congress.

By early 1984, Jerald Tanner concluded there was significant doubt as to the salamander letter&#x27;s authenticity. He even went so far as to publish an attack on the document, which surprised many scholars and students since this and other &quot;discoveries&quot; of important Mormon documents by Hofmann often appeared to bolster the Tanners&#x27; own arguments. By late 1984, Jerald Tanner questioned the authenticity of most if not all of Hofmann&#x27;s &quot;discoveries&quot;, based in large part on their unproven provenance. The Tanners did concur with Hofmann in contending that the LDS Church&#x27;s apparent inability to discern the forged documents was evidence against church leadership being divinely inspired. John Tvedtnes, a Mormon scholar, responded with Joseph Smith&#x27;s statement that &quot;a prophet was a prophet only when he was acting as such,&quot; and that purchasing historical materials is a business activity rather than a prophetic undertaking. It is also asserted that the LDS Church&#x27;s leaders do not claim infallibility and that the church&#x27;s efforts to obtain and archive historically significant material extend to works even by anti-Mormon authors.

Hofmann was struggling under massive debt and falling behind on delivering on deals that he had made. In 1985, when he learned that the pedigree of the salamander letter was under widespread suspicion, he produced and placed a number of bombs. They were detonated with a mercury switch, but without a safety switch. Two people were killed: Christensen at his office, the main target; and Kathleen Sheets at her home. That bomb was intended as a diversion, to draw off investigators by causing them to focus on unrelated business dealings between Christensen and Sheets&#x27;s husband. Hofmann himself was subsequently injured when a third bomb went off prematurely in his car. That bomb exploded in a way that most of the blast did not hit Hofmann.

The police investigated these bombings, and during a search of Hofmann&#x27;s home found a studio in the basement where he could create counterfeited documents as well as a semi-automatic carbine which had been converted to full automatic fire. Many of the documents Hofmann sold or donated were proven to be forgeries by a new forensic technique developed by the Federal Bureau of Investigation, chiefly to detect his forgeries. 

The Salt Lake City Police Department used Utah State special agent and forensic examiner George Throckmorton and Arizona document examiner William Flynn to examine a poem supposedly written by Harris and placed in his old Book of Common Prayer and determined it had actually been created by Hofmann. Hofmann used the poem to authenticate the writing in the salamander letter. Although this was enough proof by itself that the letter was a forgery, Throckmorton and Flynn bolstered their case by getting in touch with Frances Magee, the widow of a descendant of Martin Harris. Magee&#x27;s family had owned the book for many years, and Magee told investigators that she&#x27;d never seen the poem before. She suspected someone had planted it there after she sold the book. Hofmann ultimately pleaded guilty to his forgeries and murders and was sentenced to life in prison.

Church leaders, especially First Presidency member Gordon B. Hinckley, continued to field criticism for some time for &quot;being duped&quot; and being &quot;unable to discern the evil intentions of a man like Hofmann&quot;. Hinckley later noted: &quot;I accepted him to come into my office on a basis of trust … I frankly admit that Hofmann tricked us. He also tricked experts from New York to Utah, however ... I am not ashamed to admit that we were victimized. It is not the first time the Church has found itself in such a position. Joseph Smith was victimized again and again. The Savior was victimized. I am sorry to say that sometimes it happens.&quot;

Following the Hofmann trial, in a speech at Brigham Young University titled &quot;Recent Events Involving Church History and Forged Documents&quot;, Dallin H. Oaks addressed media critiques of the church, saying:
In addition to addressing the media&#x27;s treatment of the church during this period, Oaks also spoke about other concerns including alleged suppression of documents, Hofmann&#x27;s access to church officials, actual amounts paid for documents, and reminders of the many cautions Church leaders gave as to the documents&#x27; authenticity prior to Hofmann&#x27;s arrest. 

In addressing why Hofmann&#x27;s lies were not detected by church leaders, Oaks said:
==Lasting effects==

More than twenty years later, effects of the letter still lingered. The letter was referenced in research by both Mormons and critics of Mormonism alike. Resulting publications that include conclusions based on the presumption that the letter was authentic are still available and may influence the opinions of those seeking information on &quot;deep Mormon doctrine&quot; or evidence to support a naturalistic or magical historical view of Mormonism or Joseph Smith.

Grant H. Palmer, author of the book &quot;An Insider&#x27;s View of Mormon Origins&quot;, stated that his work was influenced in part by his original acceptance of the salamander letter as being valid and supportive of his view. Palmer stated that the &quot;salamander letter&quot; caused him to explore Joseph Smith&#x27;s &quot;mystical mindset&quot;.

The salamander letter also influenced the content of the film &quot;The God Makers II&quot;, an alleged exposé of Mormonism. The film suggests that Joseph Smith was required to dig up his brother Alvin&#x27;s body and bring a part of it with him to the hill Cumorah in order to obtain the golden plates from which the Book of Mormon was said to be translated. Jerald and Sandra Tanner refuted this suggestion and determined that the only known source of such a requirement would have been the salamander letter.

<doc id="359812" wikidata="Q390375" url="?curid=359812" title="National Library of New Zealand">
<text>The National Library of New Zealand () is charged with the obligation to &quot;enrich the cultural and economic life of New Zealand and its interchanges with other nations&quot; (National Library of New Zealand (Te Puna Mātauranga) Act 2003). Under the Act, the library&#x27;s duties include collecting, preserving and protecting New Zealand&#x27;s documentary heritage, supporting other libraries in New Zealand, and collaborating with peer institutions abroad. The library headquarters is on the corner of Aitken and Molesworth Streets in Wellington, close to the New Zealand Parliament Buildings and the Court of Appeal.

The National Library is New Zealand&#x27;s legal deposit library, and the Legal Deposit Office is the country&#x27;s agency for ISBN and ISSN. The library supports schools through its Services to Schools business unit, which has curriculum and advisory branches around New Zealand.

==History==
===Origins===
The National Library of New Zealand was formed in 1965 when the General Assembly Library, the Alexander Turnbull Library, and the National Library Service were brought together by the National Library Act 1965.

The General Assembly Library was founded from money voted by Parliament in 1856 and soon became &quot;a magnificent national treasure house in a splendid building&quot;. From its beginnings until it became the National Library, it always comprised a parliamentary information service of documents and newspapers plus an extensive library of international research and literature.

The Alexander Turnbull Library was founded in 1920 and grew to hold a &quot;comprehensive collection&quot; of primarily New Zealand culture and history, Māori and non-Māori. The National Library Service, established in 1945, was made up of four divisions: the Country Library Service, the School Library Service, a National Library centre and Library School in Wellington.

===Consolidation===
In 1974, the Archive of New Zealand Music was established at the suggestion of New Zealand composer Douglas Lilburn.

In 1976 Mary Ronnie became the first female national librarian in the world, due to becoming New Zealand&#x27;s first female National Librarian, at the National Library of New Zealand.

In 1985, the General Assembly Library returned to become part of the Parliamentary Service, changing its name in 1987 to the Parliamentary Library. When it separated from the National Library, the National Library then took guardianship of hundreds of thousands of international volumes previously acquired by the General Assembly Library, and the National Library continued to curate the traditional international library.

In 1987, staff and collections from 14 different sites around Wellington were centralised in a new National Library building, officially opened in August. The architecture of the building is said to have been heavily influenced by the design of the Boston City Hall, but direct reference to the Birmingham Central Library should not be ruled out.

In 1988, the National Library became an autonomous government department where previously it had been administered by the Department of Education. The same year, the Library took on the te reo Māori name Te Puna Mātauranga o Aotearoa, which translated means: the wellspring of knowledge, of New Zealand.

===Restructuring and renovations===
In early 1998 an ambitious $8.5 million computer project was scrapped.

The National Library building was to be expanded and upgraded in 2009–2011, but the incoming Fifth National Government greatly scaled down the scope of the work, reducing the budget for it and delaying the commencement, arguing concerns about the cost of the project and the reduction in the accessibility of collections and facilities during the construction work. The building closed for two years, reopening in June 2012, while refurbishment continued.

On 25 March 2010 the Minister of State Services announced that Archives New Zealand and the National Library of New Zealand would be subsumed under the Department of Internal Affairs.

In June 2018 a National Archival and Library Institutions Ministerial Group (NALI) was announced. The purpose of NALI was to examine the structure and role of the National Library, Archives New Zealand and Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision, the position of the Chief Archivist and National Librarian, and the future of collecting, preserving and providing access to New Zealand&#x27;s documentary heritage, particularly digital preservation and access. Before and since NALI was set up concern has been expressed about the National Library being part of the Department of Internal Affairs.

In December 2020, the Department of Internal Affairs confirmed that the National library along with Archives New Zealand and Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision would move to a new purpose-built business park called the Horowhenua Business Park in Levin at an unspecified date.

In February 2022 Internal Affairs Minister Jan Tinetti, Archives NZ chief archivist Stephen Clarke and Māori iwi (tribe) Taranaki Whānui Te Āti Awa confirmed that the Government would build a new archives building on the site of the former Defence House on Wellington&#x27;s Aitken Street between the present Archives NZ and National Library buildings. The new NZ$290 million building will also host archives repository and specialist facilities for the National Library, Archives New Zealand and Ngā Taonga Sound &amp; Vision.

===Overseas published collections review===
In 2015, the National Library signalled the beginning of a review process of their international collections, comprising the General Assembly international library in its guardianship of General Assembly collections and substantial post-1965 acquisitions. The National Library classified these collections as &quot;overseas published collections&quot;. This was done in consultation with New Zealand&#x27;s library sector. The review process was publicly announced in December 2019.

Under the aegis of the Department of Internal Affairs, operations began in 2018 to dispense with 625,000 &quot;overseas published&quot; books, out of a total of overseas published collections amounting to 710,000 items.

In October 2019, the library announced its intention to offer the books to local libraries, prison libraries, and community groups. The library stated the weeding was being done to create &quot;room to continue to grow our Māori, Pacific and New Zealand collections and to build well-managed coherent collections that support the National Library&#x27;s functions, in line with our legislated mandate and collections policy.&quot;

In September 2020, the review and weeding of overseas published book collections began to be discussed in the New Zealand media. The review attracted both positive and negative international and local media coverage.

The review revealed that some of the books may be of pertinence to New Zealand/Aotearoan history and on-going narratives. Concerned that researchers would lose access, the weeding of over 600,000 books was challenged by the advocacy group Book Guardians Aotearoa. The books in question are housed in Wellington and Whanganui. In July 2021 the Library announced it had made a donation agreement with the Internet Archive to take the books and digitise them, making them available to researchers on their Open Library platform.

In September 2021, the Publishers Association of New Zealand and the New Zealand Society of Authors lodged an appeal against the legality of the National Library&#x27;s donation to Internet Archive with the attorney-general, arguing that the donation breached copyright law and expressing concern about the future of the books should the archive be ordered to close. In October 2021, British novelist Philip Pullman, the President of the British Society of Authors, criticised the donation for allegedly breaching copyright laws. Wellington QC Hugh Rennie also alleged that the National Library was receiving advice from a lawyer unauthorised to practise in New Zealand, in response to Tohatoha copyright adviser Michael Wolfe&#x27;s statement in support of the donation agreement. The lawyers Andrew Brown QC and Jack Oliver-Hood also opined that the deal made the library liable for copyright infringement in New Zealand courts.

The Library states that the Internet Archive uses controlled digital lending to &quot;prevent illicit copying and ensure that copies are loaned to one person at a time&quot; and that &quot;controlled digital lending provides a way to ensure protection for content creators as well as the ability for people to be able to access and use the work that&#x27;s been created.&quot; The International Federation of Library Associations and Institutions (IFLA) issued a statement in support of controlled digital lending and highlighted the degree to which the COVID-19 pandemic underscored the need for legislation to enable libraries to provide temporary digital access to library holdings.

The Library&#x27;s donation agreement with the Internet Archive was supported by library groups and New Zealand civil society organisations.

The overseas published collections project was supported by the library sector including the Council of New Zealand University Librarians (CONZUL), Library and Information Association of New Zealand Aotearoa (LIANZA) and the Library Information Advisory Committee (LIAC), which advises the Minister of Internal Affairs.

However, several groups including the Book Guardians Aotearoa, the Publishers&#x27; Association, the Society of Authors and Writers Against National Library Disposals have been opposing moves to donate the 600,000 books by writing articles, organising events and publishing a 64-page anthology of writing. Organisations that protect writer and publisher copyright particularly PANZ and NZSA (PEN NZ) are primarily concerned with the interests of their clients and members, e.g. illegal copying of books. Meanwhile, groups like Writers Against National Library Disposals (referred to by government as the &quot;creative sector&quot;) and Book Guardians Aotearoa advocate for increased government funding for correct storage and professional curation of the international collection, to encourage and facilitate public accessibility to the threatened books. The Creative Sector does not oppose digitisation, but wishes it to occur within New Zealand as long as it fully respects authors&#x27; rights.

On 29 November 2021, the National Library of New Zealand announced that it was &quot;reconsidering&quot; its contract with Internet Archive, and would make an announcement in early 2022 regarding its continuation or cancellation. The National Library of New Zealand has also stated that it would enter into consultation with all the authors&#x27; rights and creative sector groups concerned, in 2022. On 31 October 2022, in a letter that seems to bring the protests and the process of disposals to some kind of resolution, the director of the New Zealand National Library announced that the library is &quot;developing a new policy for removing and disposing of collection items&quot;. Details of this new policy are expected to be made public in 2023 prior to the next general election.

==Collections==

The National Library&#x27;s collections are stored in the main building in Wellington and several other locations in New Zealand such as the former National Computer Centre in Whanganui. The library has three main groups: the General Collections which includes New Zealand published and overseas published volumes, the Schools Collection, and the collections of the Alexander Turnbull Library. Physical access to some of the collections may be requested through digital portals, and digital acquisitions are possible through products and online resources.

The General Collections focus on supporting the information needs of New Zealanders through services to individuals, schools and researchers, with notable collections such as the Dorothy Neal White Collection. The Schools Collection contains books and other material to support teaching and learning in New Zealand schools.

===General Assembly Library collections===
From the foundation of the National Library in 1965 until 1986 the General Assembly Library was one of the three pillars of the institution. The General Assembly Library had previously acted as a &quot;de facto&quot; National Library, offering recess privileges to the public when parliament was not in session. In 1924, for example, &quot;6,135 books were issued during the recess period, and 670 recess access cards had been granted&quot;. The Chief Librarian further notes that &quot;the New Zealand General Assembly Library is the only legislative library in the world from which volumes may be taken out during the recess&quot;. Until 1986, its collections included a significant overseas collection and copious parliamentary documents. The General Assembly Library became a stand-alone institution in 1986, when it restricted its focus to documents of immediate pertinence to parliamentary activities. Many of its overseas collections remained with the National Library and some works, particularly its rare books, then entered under the protection of the Alexander Turnbull Library.

===Alexander Turnbull Library===
The Alexander Turnbull Library was founded in 1919 by Alexander Turnbull (1868–1918), whose bequest to the nation included the 55,000 volume nucleus of the current collection. In later years, the library made its own acquisitions and his bequest was augmented with books from the General Assembly Library collections. The Alexander Turnbull Library is now part of National Library but its collections are fully protected by law and may not be sold or otherwise disposed of by the Direction of the National library. Unlike the general collections of the National Library, the collections of the Alexander Turnbull Library are normally held in its Wellington building, the National Library building constructed in 1987. Turnbull House, the library&#x27;s former location in Bowen Street in downtown Wellington, is now managed by Heritage New Zealand. It is charged under the Act to:
* &#x27;Preserve, protect, develop, and make accessible for all the people of New Zealand the collections of that library in perpetuity and in a manner consistent with their status as documentary heritage and taonga&#x27;; and
* &#x27;Develop the research collections and the services of the Alexander Turnbull Library, particularly in the fields of New Zealand and Pacific studies and rare books&#x27;; and
* &#x27;Develop and maintain a comprehensive collection of documents relating to New Zealand and the people of New Zealand.&#x27;

Turnbull collected the works of John Milton extensively, and the library now has holdings of Milton&#x27;s works which are &quot;ranked among the finest in the world&quot; and &quot;good collections of seventeenth-century poetical miscellanies and of Dryden material, ... along with fine sets of literary periodicals.&quot;

Chief librarians of the Alexander Turnbull Library have been:
* Johannes Andersen, 1919–1937
* Clyde Taylor, 1937–1963
* John Reece Cole, 1963–1965
* Graham Bagnall, 1966–1973
* Jim Traue, 1973–1990
* Margaret Calder, 1990–2007
* Chris Szekely, 2007–2024
* Jessica Moran (acting), 2024

The Friends of the Turnbull Library (FoTL) is an incorporated society that supports the work of the Alexander Turnbull Library by organising events, activities and offering an annual research grant to a scholars using the library&#x27;s resources. FoTL also funds the publication of &quot;The Turnbull Library Record&quot; which publishes information about the activities of the library and showcases the library&#x27;s collections. First published in 1940, digital issues of &quot;The Turnbull Library Record&quot; are available through Papers Past.

A number of archives held at the Alexander Turnbull Library have been added to the UNESCO Memory of the World Aotearoa New Zealand Ngā Mahara o te Ao register. These include:
*The &quot;Overture Aotearoa&quot; manuscript score, added in 2011.

==Services==

The National Library has been providing support to schools since 1942 and the current service operates from centres in Auckland and Christchurch. Services to Schools has three priorities:

* reading engagement
* school libraries
* digital literacy

School libraries can keep up-to-date with research on school libraries, and gain advice on management, finance and staffing, collection management, library systems, and teaching and learning. Reading engagement encompasses advice on supporting children&#x27;s reading and children&#x27;s and young adults literature. Digital literacy supports the school library&#x27;s role in developing digital literacy and inquiry learning.

Other services include:

* The Lending Service loans fiction and non-fiction books to schools and home educators
* Teaching and Learning Resources makes available a range of databases and curated resources to teachers and students. AnyQuestions is an online reference service for all New Zealand school students
* Professional and Learning Support for school librarians and educators via courses, events and online methods.

===National Digital Heritage Archive===
Established in 2004, the National Digital Heritage Archive (NDHA) is a partnership between the National Library, Ex Libris and Sun Microsystems to develop a digital archive and preservation management system. A digital storehouse, the system ensures that websites, digital images, CDs, DVDs and other &#x27;digitally born&#x27; and digitised items that make up the Library&#x27;s growing digital heritage collections will, despite technical obsolescence, be preserved and remain accessible to researchers, students and library users now and in the future.

===Papers Past===
The Papers Past website, run by the National Library of New Zealand, provides free access to digitised newspapers, magazines, journals, letters, diaries, and parliamentary papers from the 19th and 20th centuries. It was launched in 2001. In 2014 it included an estimated 3.3 million digitised pages. Since 12 September 2024 a correctable text feature has been added, allowing users to correct automatically generated text.

=== Index New Zealand ===
Index New Zealand (INNZ) is a freely accessible online index of articles from journals, magazines and newspapers covering New Zealand and the South Pacific, with some links to the full text of articles. Updating of the Index ceased on 21 June 2024, though the historic entries will remain available.

===Aotearoa People&#x27;s Network Kaharoa===
Established in 2007, the Aotearoa People&#x27;s Network Kaharoa (APNK) provides internet access to the public through local libraries in New Zealand. The service provides funding for internet connectivity and computing hardware. In 2009 the service won an award from the Library and Information Association of New Zealand Aotearoa.

<text>Berg Lake is a lake on the Robson River just below the river&#x27;s source located within Mount Robson Provincial Park, at the doorstep of the north face of Mount Robson, the highest peak in the Canadian Rockies. It is partly fed by the Berg Glacier.

The turquoise colored Berg Lake is dotted with icebergs even in the middle of summer. Berg Lake can be reached by following a marked hiking trail for from the parking lot. To reach the parking lot, follow Highway 5 north from Valemount to Highway 16 and head east . Or, follow Yellowhead Highway 16 west from Jasper townsite for to the Mount Robson Viewpoint centre. On the north side of the highway, follow a two-lane paved road for , ending at the parking lot.

==Berg Lake Trail==
The trail climbs gradually alongside the Robson River (a tributary of the Fraser River) for before reaching Kinney Lake. After crossing a steel bridge at the end of Kinney Lake, it is just to the Kinney Lake campground. After leaving the Kinney Lake campground the trail climbs and then descends a small bluff. After descending the bluff the trail splits for less than a kilometre, giving the hiker the option of traversing
the flats, which is not recommended in the early summer because of high water, or continuing on in the forest. At the end of the Kinney Lake flats the trail starts climbing up to the Valley of a Thousand Falls. After several kilometres the trail crosses the Robson River on a suspension bridge and enters Whitehorn campground at the mark. After leaving the campground the trail eventually crosses a second steel bridge. At this point the trail starts a steep climb with numerous switchbacks. Over the next few kilometres, the trail passes White Falls, Falls-of-the-Pool and Emperor Falls. Finally, once above this valley, the trail levels off and dips down toward the river, providing the first glimpses of the Emperor Face of Mt. Robson. After climbing just over in , the trail enters Emperor campground. From here the trail continues on until reaching the shores of Berg Lake and Marmot campground. If you carry on a further you will reach Berg Lake campground. There are three popular day trips from this campground, Hargeaves Glacier/Mumm Basin Traverse, Toboggan Falls and Snowbird Pass. At the mark and mark there are two more campgrounds, Rearguard and Robson Pass.

<text>Mount Robson Provincial Park is a provincial park in the Canadian Rockies with an area of 2,249 km. The park is located entirely within British Columbia, bordering Jasper National Park in Alberta. The B.C. legislature created the park in 1913, the same year as the first ascent of Mount Robson by a party led by Conrad Kain. It is the second-oldest park in the provincial system. The park is named for Mount Robson, which has the highest point in the Canadian Rockies and is located entirely within the park.

==History==
The first recreational trail was built in 1913 by Jasper outfitter Donald &quot;Curly&quot; Phillips along the Robson River to Berg Lake.

From May to September, the Mt. Robson Visitor Information Centre is open to the public, and is a common stop on the Yellowhead Highway. The only commercial services within the park are at a combination coffee-shop gas station complex at the same viewpoint. There are two government campgrounds near the Visitor Centre and one near Yellowhead Pass.

==Geography==
The park spans the Yellowhead Highway and is located 390 kilometres west of Edmonton or 290 kilometres east of Prince George.

The source of the Fraser River is in Mount Robson Provincial Park. A dripping spring just west of a pond at Fraser Pass is the actual source of British Columbia&#x27;s longest river. It is located south of the Yellowhead Highway at Lucerne Campground. There are no trails there and the best access is by helicopter from Valemount.

===Notable features===
Notable natural features found in the park include:
*Arctomys Cave
*Berg Lake
*Kinney Lake
*Yellowhead Lake

==World Heritage Site==
In 1990 Mount Robson Park was included within the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks UNESCO World Heritage Site. Together with the other national and provincial parks that comprise the Canadian Rocky Mountain Parks, the park was recognized for its natural beauty and the geological and ecological significance of its mountain landscapes containing the habitats of rare and endangered species, mountain peaks, glaciers, lakes, waterfalls, canyons, limestone caves and fossils.

<text>Te Aho o Te Kura Pounamu or Te Kura (formerly The Correspondence School) is New Zealand&#x27;s largest school with around 28,000 students enrolled each year, from early childhood to secondary level. It is headquartered in Portland Crescent in Thorndon, Wellington. In addition to its ordinary full-time students, Te Kura provides programmes to students at other state-owned schools where a subject is unavailable, and to adults. Te Kura is Ministry of Education funded.

==Early history==
The school began in 1922 with 100 primary level students, expanding into secondary education in 1928 with 50 students and into early childhood education in 1976. When the school was first established in the 1920s, parliamentarians referred to the founding vision as &quot;a school for the benefit of the most isolated children, for example of lighthouse keepers and remote shepherds living upon small islands or in mountainous districts&quot;. The same parliamentary debate on TCS also described it as &quot;a school of last resort, ensuring that no matter where he lived every child should have as full an education as he was capable of achieving&quot;.

==Recent developments==
The school began a significant review of its services under the leadership of Debbie Francis (CEO January 2004 – July 2006) during which time the school was restructured. A $6 million annual deficit was corrected primarily through reducing the number of salaried staff – amongst other strategies. Further to this, the school developed a Differentiated Services Model for its full-time students.

Mike Hollings commenced in the position of CEO from August 2006 after completing a contract as the CEO of New Zealand Education Review Office (ERO). Further restructuring was undertaken at the end of 2007 when the school commenced the adoption of a more regionally focused model.

==Notable staff==

*Arthur Gordon Butchers (1885–1960), principal, educationalist and historian
*Louise Henderson (1902–1994), artist and painter
*Trish McKelvey (born 1942), former cricketer, cricket administrator, and educator
*Apirana Mahuika (1934–2015), Māori tribal leader
*Te Paekiomeka Joy Ruha (1931–2011), prominent Māori leader and teacher

==Notable alumni==

*Courtney McGregor (born 1998), representative artistic gymnast
*Nico Porteous (born 2001), represented New Zealand and won bronze at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.
*Miguel Porteous (born 1999) represented New Zealand at the 2018 Winter Olympics in Pyeongchang.

<doc id="359846" wikidata="Q8059691" url="?curid=359846" title="Ys (series)">
<text>() is a Japanese series of action role-playing games developed by Nihon Falcom. The series chronicles the life of the adventurer Adol Christin.

The first game in the series, &quot;Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished&quot;, was released on the NEC PC-8801 in 1987. &quot;Ys&quot; games have since been ported and released on many other platforms. As of 2017, &quot;Ys&quot; had sold over 4.8 million copies worldwide.

==Common elements==
===Plot===
The &quot;Ys&quot; series chronicles the life of Adol Christin, a young man obsessed with adventure. Gameplay usually revolves around Adol, though his comrade, Dogi, is a frequent companion in his travels. More recent games in the series include several other playable party members.
A feature of the early &quot;Ys&quot; games is the Darm Tower. In the story, it is an unfinished and deserted tower, built with the intention of touching the sky. The tower houses a small annex, titled &quot;the Tower of Rado&quot; (or simply &quot;Rado&#x27;s Annex&quot;) three quarters of the way up. According to in-game lore, the normally immortal ancient Ys aged because humans overused the magic power of an ancient artifact, known as the Black Pearl. The result of this misuse was evil magical energy bringing forth millions of cruel demons. The people of Ys fled to the Palace of Solomon and used the Black Pearl to lift the palace into the sky, creating a safe haven. The demons, focused on controlling the Black Pearl for their own intentions, began building the Darm Tower, day and night, attempting to connect to the Palace of Solomon with their construction. As in-game-events transpired, however, the demons&#x27; efforts were thwarted. Later games feature a variety of plots but frequently begin with a shipwreck, with a stranded Adol getting involved in the new area&#x27;s events.

===Gameplay===
In early games, the player uses only the directional pad to fight. The player must run Adol into enemies, hitting them on the side, back or slightly off-center of the front. This was created with accessibility in mind; while other RPGs at the time had either turn-based combat or a manually activated sword, &quot;Ys&quot; had Adol automatically attack when walking into enemies. While most &quot;Ys&quot; titles do not use the &#x27;bump attack&#x27; system, it has become one of the series&#x27; defining features. Falcom staff have compared this style of gameplay to the enjoyment of popping air bubble sheets, in the sense that it took the tedious task of level-grinding and turned it into something similar to a high-score-based arcade game.

A feature that has been used in nearly every &quot;Ys&quot; title is the health regeneration mechanism, which had previously only been used in the &quot;Hydlide&quot; series. Recharging health has since become a common mechanism used in many video games today.

&quot;Ys II&quot; introduced magic spells to the series (e.g. shooting fireballs), and the ability to transform into a monster, which allows the player to both scare human non-player characters for unique dialogues, and interact with non-boss monsters.

&quot;Ys III: Wanderers from Ys&quot; adopted side-scrolling action-adventure gameplay, similar to Falcom&#x27;s own &quot;Dragon Slayer&quot; series and Nintendo&#x27;s &quot;Zelda II: The Adventure of Link&quot;, with an attack button and a variety of different attacks.

&quot;Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys&quot; and &quot;Ys IV: Mask of the Sun&quot; returned to the original control scheme, while &quot;Ys IV: Mask of the Sun-A New Theory&quot; requires the player to press buttons to attack.

&quot;Ys V: Lost Kefin, Kingdom of Sand&quot; uses a top-down viewpoint and requires the player to press buttons to attack or defend with a shield.

&quot;Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim&quot; graphically departed from its predecessors, using a mix of three-dimensional graphics and sprites. Gameplay is hack and slash generally without the ability to actively block. &quot;Ys: The Oath in Felghana&quot; and &quot;Ys: Origin&quot; share this gameplay style.

&quot;Ys Seven&quot; brought back the ability to actively block, with skills, stun meters for enemies, weapon types, super combos known as EXTRA skills, and the ability to parry hits from attacks with a flash guard system. Failed flash guards result in the player character taking extra damage compared to failing to defend at all. &quot;Memories of Celceta&quot; introduces a flash dodge where a player character dodges just before a hit. &quot;Ys VIII&quot; and &quot;IX&quot; continued this style.

==Games==

The &quot;Ys&quot; series has its roots in the Japanese computer system NEC PC-8801. Each of the first three games was released on that platform first. Ports of the games to console platforms have usually been handled by various other licensee companies, such as Hudson Soft, Tonkin House and Konami. 

The first two games in the series were originally intended as a single game, but the creators, Masaya Hashimoto and Tomoyoshi Miyazaki, eventually decided to split it into two separate games: &quot;Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished&quot; (1987) and &quot;Ys II: Ancient Ys Vanished – The Final Chapter&quot; (1988). They were later re-released together in the enhanced remake &quot;Ys I &amp; II&quot; (1989). It was one of the first video games to use CD-ROM, which was utilized to provide enhanced graphics, animated cutscenes, a Red Book CD-DA soundtrack, and voice acting. Its English localization was also one of the first to use voice dubbing. The game received the Game of the Year award from &quot;OMNI Magazine&quot; in 1990, as well as many other awards. The Sharp X68000 remake of &quot;Ys I&quot; released in 1991 was notable for its early use of 3D pre-rendering for the boss sprites. An MS-DOS remake called &quot;Ys II Special&quot; was also released exclusively for the South Korean market in 1994; it was a mash-up of &quot;Ys II&quot; with the anime &quot;Ys II: Castle in the Heavens&quot; (1992) along with a large amount of new content.

After completing &quot;Ys III: Wanderers from Ys&quot; (1989), Hashimoto and Miyazaki left Nihon Falcom and founded Quintet. Two versions of the fourth game were released, and Falcom licensed both versions out: the Super Famicom version to Tonkin House (who had handled the Super NES port for &quot;Ys III&quot;), titled &quot;Ys IV: Mask of the Sun&quot;; and the PC Engine CD version to Hudson Soft (who had ported all three previous games to that platform), titled &quot;Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys&quot;. Hudson Soft took certain liberties with the game, and as a result, it is very different from &quot;Mask of the Sun&quot;. They share the same setting, cast, and much of the basic plot, but the actual structure of the story plays out in a completely different manner, as do the game&#x27;s levels and enemies. &quot;Mask of the Sun&quot; is the official continuation of the series, while Falcom have deemed &quot;The Dawn of Ys&quot; to be essentially an &quot;alternate universe&quot; take on the events in Celceta. A PS2 remake of &quot;Mask of the Sun&quot; was released in May 2005, further subtitled &quot;A New Theory&quot;.

Falcom released &quot;Ys V&quot; as a Super Famicom exclusive. A standalone title, it gave Adol a jump and manual attack. It was criticized as being too easy; in response to this, Falcom put out &quot;Ys V Expert&quot;, a harder version of the game. A PS2 remake of &quot;Ys V&quot; by Taito was released 2006 in Japan.

After this, the series remained dormant for eight years (except for remakes such as &quot;Ys Eternal&quot;), during which time Falcom abandoned console development altogether, choosing instead to focus on the Windows platform. The sixth game in the series, entitled &quot;Ys VI: The Ark of Napishtim&quot;, was released in September 2003. &quot;&quot;, a remake of &quot;Ys III&quot;, was released in 2005. A spin-off game called &quot;Ys Strategy&quot; was released in March 2006 in Japan for the Nintendo DS. Unlike the rest of the series, it is a real-time strategy game. It received lackluster reviews and general disdain from fans.

&quot;Ys Origin&quot; was released in December 2006. It takes place 700 years before the events of the first game, following the separation of Ys from Esteria. The two initial playable characters are Yunica Tovah and Hugo Fact. The two characters&#x27; stories play out somewhat differently during character interactions. Adol appears only as a hidden bonus character. Falcom has since released a new version of the game that required a copy&#x27;s registration serial number sent to Falcom along with shipping charges to get an extra enhancement disc for the game. With this disc the player would be able to play as Adol, along with various other new features. &quot;Ys Seven&quot; was released in Japan in 2009 for the PlayStation Portable. Unlike the previous entries in the series, this time the player has a party of characters fighting simultaneously against enemies on the field, and can change the controlled character on the fly with the press of a button. This system has been maintained in all subsequent games in the series. The graphics also had a significant upgrade compared to &quot;Ys Origin&quot;.

In September 2012, &quot;&quot; was released for the PlayStation Vita. &quot;Ys VIII: Lacrimosa of Dana&quot; was released in Japan in July 2016 for the PlayStation Vita, and was later ported to the PlayStation 4, Windows, and Nintendo Switch. &quot;Ys IX: Monstrum Nox&quot; was released on the PlayStation 4 in Japan in September 2019. It was released in North America and Europe in 2021. &quot;Ys X: Nordics&quot; was released in Japan for the PlayStation 5, PlayStation 4 and Nintendo Switch in September 2023. It features naval exploration and combat for the first time in the series.

=== English releases ===
Until 2005, only three &quot;Ys&quot; games were available in North America: &quot;Ys I: Ancient Ys Vanished&quot; (Master System, MS-DOS, Apple IIGS), &quot;Ys I &amp; II&quot; (TurboGrafx CD), and &quot;Ys III: Wanderers from Ys&quot; (SNES, Genesis, TurboGrafx CD). The original PC-8801, PC-9801, X1 and MSX2 versions, as well as the Famicom ports, remain exclusive to Japan. English ports of the Japanese PC game &quot;Ys VI: Ark of Napishtim&quot; were released by Konami in 2005 and 2006 for the PS2 and PSP, respectively, marking the first English release of the series in 13 years.

At one point, NEC Interchannel proposed bringing DigiCube&#x27;s &quot;Ys Eternal Story&quot; to North America, but the idea was rejected by Sony Computer Entertainment America.

The original Windows PC remakes were &quot;Ys Eternal&quot; and &quot;Ys II Eternal&quot;. Later, there was a compiled re-release called &quot;Ys I &amp; II Complete&quot;, which bumped up &quot;Ys Eternal&quot; visuals to &quot;Ys II Eternal&quot; level (more color depth, primarily) and made the soundtrack sound more cohesive between the two. Once this was out of print, Falcom began selling the two separately again, as &quot;Ys I Complete&quot; and &quot;Ys II Complete&quot;. Falcom changed the &quot;Eternal&quot; to &quot;Complete&quot; on all external packaging and advertisements, but not in the actual games themselves. In one of the English patches, the internal bitmaps are edited to reflect the external change for the packages.

In 2002, Nicolas Livaditis, an avid &quot;Ys&quot; fan and software engineer, spearheaded an English fan translation project for the first PC remake, &quot;Ys I Complete&quot;. This led to other projects for &quot;Ys II Complete&quot;, &quot;Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys&quot;, &quot;&quot;, &quot;&quot; and &quot;Ys Origin&quot;, though not all were completed; the &quot;Ys VI&quot; project for example, was cancelled to respect Konami&#x27;s licensing rights. Completed translation patches were made for &quot;Ys I &amp; II Complete&quot; and &quot;Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys&quot;. In 2010, Xseed Games purchased the fan-translated script for &quot;&quot; from Jeff Nussbaum, the actual translator, an act considered historic and unprecedented, as unlicensed translations are technically copyright infringements as unauthorized derivative works. XSEED went on to purchase three more fan-translated scripts for &quot;Ys I&quot;, &quot;Ys II&quot;, and &quot;Ys Origin&quot;.

Nintendo added &quot;Ys Book I &amp; II&quot; to the US Virtual Console in August 2008, the first release of the &quot;Ys&quot; series on a 7th generation home console. Atlus released the games in one package entitled &quot;Legacy of Ys: Books I &amp; II&quot; in February 2009 on the Nintendo DS.

Xseed Games localized the PlayStation Portable games &quot;Ys I &amp; II Chronicles&quot;, &quot;Ys: The Oath in Felghana&quot;, and &quot;Ys Seven&quot; in North America. As of 2011, all games have been released.

In 2012, Xseed Games began publishing Japanese PC games through Steam, starting with the PC version of &quot;Ys: The Oath in Felghana&quot; on 19 March. On 31 May, Xseed Games released an English version of &quot;Ys Origin&quot; on Steam. &quot;Ys I &amp; II&quot; were also released via Steam in February 2013 as &quot;Ys I &amp; II Chronicles+&quot; – XSEED&#x27;s Steam programmer Sara managed to combine Falcom&#x27;s PC port of &quot;Ys I &amp; II Chronicles&quot; with the earlier fan-favorite PC release &quot;Ys I &amp; II Complete&quot;, effectively mixing all the best features of both versions like selectable soundtracks (PC-88 original, Complete and Chronicles) and art styles from both Chronicles and Complete, alongside the visual flexibility of Complete, such as greater viewing area, togglable screen frame and support for windowed mode.

&quot;&quot; was released in North America in November 2013 by Xseed Games. The American release was also released as a limited edition called &quot;Silver Anniversary Edition&quot;, which features a 3-CD collection of both original and arranged music spanning the history of the franchise, a cloth map of the land of Celceta, a logo-emblazoned compass and Adol&#x27;s Travel Journal, containing around 120+ pages of adventuring strategies and artwork. &quot;&quot; was released by NIS America in Europe in February 2014.

===MMORPG===
&quot;Ys Online ~ The Call of Solum&quot;, developed by the South Korean game maker CJ Internet and taking place more than a hundred years after the main series, was launched on 5 November 2007 in South Korea, and in 2009 as an open beta for Chinese, Japanese and European players, but was discontinued in all regions in October 2012.

==Animation==

There are two separate OVA series of &quot;Ys&quot;, with the first spanning seven episodes and covering the events of the first game, and the second running for four episodes and loosely covering the events of the second game. The first anime expands on the relatively thin storyline of &quot;Ys I&quot;, including a retelling and expansion of the prologue found in the game&#x27;s original Japanese manual.

Both series were released on DVD in English by Media Blasters&#x27; anime label &quot;AnimeWorks&quot;, packaged both separately and in a three-disc box set. The dubbed/audio tracks have changes to some character names (&quot;Dark Fact&quot; becoming &quot;Dark Factor&quot;, &quot;Adol&quot; becoming &quot;Adle&quot;, and &quot;Lilia&quot; becoming &quot;Lillian&quot;, for instance). Pronunciations of various names are inconsistent, sometimes within the same scene.

Included on one of the discs is what appears to be a preview for an anime based around &quot;Ys IV: Dawn of Ys&quot;. This was created by Falcom as a &quot;pitch&quot; trailer to shop around to various animation studios to see if anyone was interested in producing the series, but they had no takers, so this trailer is all that exists of the rumored &quot;Ys IV: Dawn of Ys&quot; anime.

==Music==
The first two games were composed by Yuzo Koshiro, Mieko Ishikawa, and Hideya Nagata, whereas Mieko Ishikawa handled the soundtrack for &quot;Ys III&quot;. The composers&#x27; works have been remixed for each subsequent release, for instance, by Japanese musician Ryo Yonemitsu for Hudson Soft&#x27;s &quot;Ys I &amp; II&quot;, &quot;Ys III: Wanderers from Ys&quot; and &quot;Ys IV: The Dawn of Ys&quot; releases for TurboGrafx-CD. The TurboGrafx versions made use of Red Book audio.

The &quot;Ys&quot; series is seen in the video game music industry as some of the finest and most influential role-playing video game scores of all time, demonstrated by an extensive series of CD releases based on the series&#x27; music, with numerous variations on its themes. It has also inspired video game composers outside Japan, such as German musician Chris Huelsbeck.

The later games in the series were composed by Falcom Sound Team jdk, the collective name of Falcom&#x27;s internal sound production staff (not to be confused with the jdk Band – a band made of freelance musicians who works for Falcom and performs Sound Team jdk&#x27;s music live and for arranged albums).

<doc id="359848" wikidata="Q89114" url="?curid=359848" title="Conrad Kain">
<text>Conrad Kain (10 August 1883, Nasswald – 2 February 1934, Cranbrook, British Columbia) was an Austrian mountain guide who guided extensively in Europe, Canada, and New Zealand, and was responsible for the first ascents of more than 60 routes in British Columbia. He is particularly known for pioneering climbs in the Purcell Mountains and the first ascents of Mount Robson (1913), Mount Louis (1916) and Bugaboo Spire (1916).

== Life ==

Kain was born in poverty in a small village in Lower Austria. His father was a miner who died when Kain was 8. In his youth he worked as a goatherd in the Rax Alps and from 1898 to 1904 he worked at stone quarries in Veitsch and Hirschwang. His free time he spent climbing, and by 1904 he guided his first clients, becoming an officially recognized professional guide in 1906. He guided his clients not only in Austria (including the Dolomites), but also in Switzerland and France, including the Matterhorn, La Meije and several first ascents.

Dissatisfied with his life in Austria, he planned to emigrate and in 1908 he took lessons in English in Vienna for that purpose. In June 1909 he moved to Canada with the promise of employment as the Alpine Club of Canada&#x27;s first professional guide, changing his name from Konrad to Conrad. In the summer of 1910 he surveyed the Purcell Mountains and in 1911 he explored the Banff area, making a number of first ascents already. In 1912 he joined an exploration in Siberia&#x27;s Altai Mountains, after which he returned to Austria where he spent several months with his mother. He then traveled to New Zealand where he was a guide in the winter of 1913. He was encouraged to return to Canada again to be a guide for two mountaineering camps, one based at Lake O&#x27;Hara camp and another at Robson Pass. The next three years he would guide respective summers in both Canada and New Zealand, completing many first ascents in both countries.

Conrad Kain is credited with 69 first ascents in Canada alone, including Resplendent Mountain and Whitehorn Mountain (1911), Nasswald Peak (named after his hometown) and Mount Robson (1913), Mount Farnham (1915), Mount Louis, Howser Spire and Bugaboo Spire (1916), North Twin Peak and Mount Saskatchewan (1923), Mount Hooker and Mount Fraser (1924) and Peyto Peak and Trapper Peak (1933). Between 1914 and 1916 he made about 30 first ascents in New Zealand as well.

While he considered his climb of Bugaboo Spire the most challenging, and it was considered the most difficult alpine climb in Canada until the 1940s, his most notable first ascent was that of Mount Robson in July 1913. He guided :de:Albert MacCarthy and William Wasbrough Foster over the northeast face by hacking hundreds of steps and famously told his clients at the top &quot;Gentlemen, that&#x27;s so far as I can take you.&quot; During the ascent, Kain was under the assumption that Mount Robson had been climbed in 1909 by George Kinney and Curly Phillips, but on their return to the campsite at Robson Pass, Phillips, who was outfitter of the expedition, revealed that he and Kinney had actually fallen short of reaching the summit in their heroic effort over the west face four years before.

Conrad Kain climbed Mount Louis for the last time on his 50th birthday. He fell ill in October of that year in Wilmer, British Columbia, and died six months later of encephalitis in a hospital in Cranbrook. The marker on his grave in Cranbrook reads &quot;A guide of great spirit&quot;.

==Legacy==
Kain wrote an autobiography titled &quot;Where the Clouds Can Go&quot; where he describes his tough years while growing up in Austria as well as his 25 years working variously as a guide for The Alpine Club of Canada, a hunter outfitter, and an assistant to Arthur O. Wheeler for the Geographic Survey of Canada.

In 1911, A. O. Wheeler named Mount Kain after him, when Kain had pointed at the mountain and exclaimed &quot;Ach, that is my peak!&quot; a few days after he had come to Wheeler&#x27;s rescue after slipping on a descent from Lynx Mountain. Near the Bugaboos there is the Conrad Group, with the Conrad Icefield, Conrad Glacier and with Mount Conrad (3271 m) as highest point. The latter previously unclimbed peak was the last mountain Kain climbed (in September 1933). Since 1970, the Alpine Club of Canada maintains an alpine hut named Conrad Kain hut centrally located in the Bugaboos, where Kain made many first ascents. In New Zealand there is also a Mount Conrad (2,598 m) named after him, lying in the Liebig Range above the Murchison Glacier in the Southern Alps.

To commemorate the 100th anniversary of Kain&#x27;s arrival in Canada, the Conrad Kain Centennial Society was formed in the upper Columbia Valley in 2007 to celebrate his achievements and to develop legacy projects in his memory.

<text>The London Gazette, known generally as The Gazette, is one of the official journals of record or government gazettes of the Government of the United Kingdom, and the most important among such official journals in the United Kingdom, in which certain statutory notices are required to be published.

Other official newspapers of the UK government are &quot;The Edinburgh Gazette&quot; and &quot;The Belfast Gazette&quot;, which, apart from reproducing certain materials of nationwide interest published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;, also contain publications specific to Scotland and Northern Ireland, respectively. In turn, &quot;The London Gazette&quot; carries not only notices of UK-wide interest, but also those relating specifically to entities or people in England and Wales. However, certain notices that are only of specific interest to Scotland or Northern Ireland are also required to be published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;.

The &quot;London&quot;, &quot;Edinburgh&quot; and &quot;Belfast Gazettes&quot; are published by The Stationery Office (TSO) on behalf of His Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office. They are subject to Crown copyright.

&quot;The London Gazette&quot; claims to be the oldest surviving English newspaper and the oldest continuously published newspaper in the UK, having been first published on 7 November 1665 as The Oxford Gazette. The claim to being oldest is also made by the &quot;Stamford Mercury&quot; (1712) and &quot;Berrow&#x27;s Worcester Journal&quot; (1690).

== Current publication ==
&quot;The London Gazette&quot; is published each weekday, except for bank holidays. Notices for the following, among others, are published:

* Granting of royal assent to bills of the Parliament of the United Kingdom, the Scottish Parliament, the Senedd and the Northern Ireland Assembly
* The issuance of writs of election when a vacancy occurs in the House of Commons
* Appointments to certain public offices
* Commissions in the Armed Forces and subsequent promotion of officers
* Corporate and personal insolvency
* Granting of awards of honours and military medals
* Changes of names or of coats of arms
* Royal proclamations and other declarations

His Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office has digitised all issues of &quot;The Gazette&quot;, and these are available online.

The official Gazettes are published by The Stationery Office. The content is available in a number of machine-readable formats, including XML (delivery by email/FTP) and XML/RDFa via Atom feed.

== History ==
&quot;The London Gazette&quot; was first published as &quot;The Oxford Gazette&quot; on 7 November 1665. Charles II and the Royal Court had moved to Oxford to escape the Great Plague of London, and courtiers were unwilling to touch London newspapers for fear of contagion. The &quot;Gazette&quot; was &quot;Published by Authority&quot; by Henry Muddiman, and its first publication is noted by Samuel Pepys in his diary. The King returned to London as the plague dissipated, and the &quot;Gazette&quot; moved too, with the first issue of &quot;The London Gazette&quot; (labelled No. 24) being published on 5 February 1666. The &quot;Gazette&quot; was not a newspaper in the modern sense: it was sent by post to subscribers, not printed for sale to the general public.

His Majesty&#x27;s Stationery Office took over the publication of the &quot;Gazette&quot; in 1889. Publication of the &quot;Gazette&quot; was transferred to the private sector in 2006, under government supervision, when HMSO was sold and renamed The Stationery Office. All content is available under the Open Government Licence v3.0, except where otherwise stated.

===Dates before 1 January 1752===
Until the Calendar (New Style) Act 1750 came into effect on 1 January 1752, the &quot;Gazette&quot; was published with a date based on the Julian calendar with the start of year as 25 March. (Modern secondary sources may adjust the start of the calendar year during this period to 1 January, while retaining the original day and month. Using this adjustment, an issue with a printed date of 24 March 1723 will be reported as being published in 1724 the same solar year as an issue published two days later, on 26 March 1724.)

==&quot;Gazetted&quot;==
In time of war, dispatches from the various conflicts are published in &quot;The London Gazette&quot;. Soldiers who are mentioned in despatches will also be named in the Gazette. When members of the armed forces are promoted, and these promotions are published here, the person is said to have been &quot;gazetted&quot;.

Being &quot;gazetted&quot; (or &quot;in the gazette&quot;) also meant having official notice of one&#x27;s bankruptcy published, as in the classic ten-line poem comparing the stolid tenant farmer of 1722 to the lavishly spending faux-genteel farmers of 1822:

Notices of engagement and marriage were also formerly published in the &quot;Gazette&quot;.

==Colonial gazettes==
Gazettes, modelled on &quot;The London Gazette&quot;, were issued for most British colonial possessions. Many of these continued after independence, and to the present day.

<doc id="359863" wikidata="Q2036444" url="?curid=359863" title="Yellowhead Highway">
<text>The Yellowhead Highway () is a major interprovincial highway in Western Canada that runs from Winnipeg to Graham Island off the coast of British Columbia via Saskatoon and Edmonton. It stretches across the four western Canadian provinces of British Columbia, Alberta, Saskatchewan, and Manitoba and is part of the Trans-Canada Highway system and the larger National Highway System, but should not be confused with the more southerly, originally-designated Trans-Canada Highway. The highway was officially opened in 1970. Beginning in 1990, the green and white Trans-Canada logo is used to designate the roadway.

The highway is named for the Yellowhead Pass, the route chosen to cross the Canadian Rockies. The pass and the highway are named after a fur trader and explorer named Pierre Bostonais. He had yellow streaks in his hair, and was nicknamed &quot;Tête Jaune&quot; (Yellowhead). Almost the entire length of the highway is numbered as 16, except for the section in Manitoba that is concurrent with Trans-Canada Highway 1.

The highway number &quot;16&quot; is also the number given to a branch of the Trans-Canada in New Brunswick; Route 16. However, the numeric designation is strictly coincidental, and New Brunswick Route 16 is not part of the Yellowhead.

==Route description==
===British Columbia and Alberta===

In the west, the highway begins at Masset, British Columbia, on Haida Gwaii, heading south along Graham Island for to Skidegate. It then connects via a ferry route to Prince Rupert, then passes southeastward for through to Prince George, before travelling another eastward through to Tête Jaune Cache.

A spur of the Yellowhead Highway, Highway 5, also known as the Southern Yellowhead Highway, connects the main highway at Tête Jaune Cache midway between the Alberta-British Columbia border and Prince George. The highway continues past Kamloops before following the Coquihalla Highway to Hope. Unlike Highway 16, route 5 is not branded as being part of the Trans-Canada system and retains the original Yellowhead signage (whereas Highway 16 uses the Trans-Canada Highway logo).

The highway enters Alberta through the Rocky Mountains near Jasper, from Tête Jaune Cache, passes through Edmonton further east, and travels another before entering Saskatchewan at Lloydminster. The highest point on the highway, at , is Obed Summit near Obed, Alberta.

===Saskatchewan and Manitoba===
The highway travels southeast for to Saskatoon, passing through North Battleford about halfway in between. From Saskatoon, the Yellowhead Highway continues its southeastern journey through the province for to Yorkton. The highway continues for another from Yorkton and enters Manitoba northwest of Russell.

Within Manitoba, the highway travels before meeting the main Trans-Canada Highway near Portage la Prairie, Manitoba, where it ends its Highway 16 designation. It then overlaps the TCH into Winnipeg as an unnumbered highway. Officially, the eastern end of the Yellowhead Highway is at the corner of Portage Avenue and Main Street in Winnipeg. The total length of the Yellowhead Highway, including ferries, is .

==History==
The main Yellowhead Highway has been designated as Highway 16 for its entire length since 1977. Prior to this, only the Alberta and British Columbia portions of the highway were designated with this number. The Manitoba portion from the Trans-Canada Highway west of Portage la Prairie to the Saskatchewan border was designated as PTH 4 (redesignated PTH 16 in 1977), while the Saskatchewan portion (which was redesignated as Highway 16 in 1976) had two numbers designated. From the Manitoba border to Saskatoon, the highway was designated as Highway 14 while the portion from Saskatoon to Lloydminster and the Alberta border was designated as Highway 5. Prior to the opening of the Yellowhead Highway, Highways 5 and 14 both ran the width of Saskatchewan; the respective eastern and western portions of these highways retain their original designations. Prior to the highway retaining the number 16 designation, a very small section of the highway along Idylwyld Drive in Saskatoon was not designated with a number, as Highway 14 redirected on to 22 Street and Highway 5 would redirect on to Idylwyld Drive from 23 Street. Currently, the Yellowhead Highway remains unnumbered between Winnipeg and PTH 16, although it shares the roadway with PTH 1.

While the beginnings of the Yellowhead Highway can be traced back to 1819 when Iroquois Metis Pierre Bostonais, nicknamed Tête Jaune/Yellow Head, was engaged by the Hudson&#x27;s Bay Company to guide them westward through the Rocky Mountains, the impetus for the building of the highway began in 1921 when a group from Edmonton formed to advocate for a driveable road from Edmonton to Jasper.

Much of the Yellowhead Highway between Edmonton and BC Interior is built on former railway lines. In the early 1900s, both the Canadian Northern Railway (CNoR) and the Grand Trunk Pacific Railway (GTPR) built lines leading to the Yellowhead Pass. In 1917 the Canadian government compelled the two railways to share one line between Red Pass Junction and Lobstick, and portions of both railways were abandoned. Rails pulled from the abandoned sections were sent to France during the Great War. The CNoR was nationalized in 1918, and in 1919 the GTPR was nationalized as well. One of the engineers working on the crew that pulled up the rails was Fred Driscol. He had the idea to convert the rail bed into a road, and his proposal was endorsed by the Edmonton Automobile and Good Road Association (forerunner of today&#x27;s Alberta Motor Association) and became that organizations main object of advocacy for the next fifteen years. Despite the E.A.&amp; G.R.A.&#x27;s lobbying efforts the successor railway (the Canadian National) would not give up the right-of-way. Therefore, a different route to Jasper was assembled from old cart path, with the club paying for some sections to be built themselves. The E.A.&amp; G.R.A. offered a $100 prize to the first motorists to reach Jasper from Edmonton. The prize was claimed by stunt driver Charley Neimeyer and mechanic Frank Silverthorne in an Overland in June 1922 just beating out George Gordon and J.E. Sims in a Ford by a few days. Both parties continued all the way to the coast and each also received a gold medal from the City of Victoria for being the first to reach that city by motorcar from across the Rockies, Neimeyer and Silverthorne though Washington State, and Gordon and Sims via the Fraser Canyon.

Work continued on the cart path upgrades with many sections also built on rail beds without formal permission from Canadian National. Finally, CN and the federal government agreed to a lease of the right-of-way backdated to 1923. In 1966, the provincial government received title to the entire stretch of abandoned rails. there were of the Edmonton-to-Jasper section of the highway on former railway grades.

In 1936 the advocacy around the highway was formalized with the formation of the Yellowhead Highway Association which later, in 1947, was reformed as the Trans-Canada Highway System Association and a submission was made to Prime Minister Mackenzie King to advocate for the construction of the highway. The Association was renamed the Trans Canada Yellowhead Highway Association (TCYHA) in 2000 to better reflect its roots. The iconic Yellowhead Highway signage seen along the highways is trademarked to the TCYHA.
The Yellowhead Highway was officially opened in Western Canada in 1970; in 1978 all four Western Provinces agreed to use #16 for the highway. In 1986, the Yellowhead Highway received the designation of a Trans Canada Highway with Highway #5 in BC, from Tête Jaune to Hope, remaining named just the Yellowhead Highway.

The Highway 5 in British Columbia used to be designated as part of the Yellowhead Highway only between Tête Jaune Cache and Kamloops, with Highway 5 south of Kamloops being signed with the standard BC highway shield. In the 2000s, route markers along the Coquihalla Highway were changed to reflect Yellowhead Highway 5.

<text>The redpoll (Acanthis flammea) is a species of small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. It is the only species placed in the genus Acanthis. It breeds in the Arctic and north temperate Holarctic tundra and taiga. The redpoll was formerly widely treated as three species: the common or mealy redpoll, the arctic or hoary redpoll (&quot;A. hornemanni&quot;), and the lesser redpoll (&quot;A. cabaret&quot;).

==Taxonomy==
The redpoll was listed in 1758 by the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Fringilla flammea&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;flammea&quot; is Latin meaning &quot;flame-coloured&quot;. Linnaeus also described the redpoll as &quot;Fringilla linaria&quot; on the same page, but the earlier name &quot;flammea&quot; has priority.

The redpoll was previously placed in the genus &quot;Carduelis&quot;. Molecular phylogenetic studies showed that it formed a distinct lineage, so it was moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Acanthis&quot; that had been introduced in 1797 by the German naturalist Moritz Balthasar Borkhausen. The genus name &quot;Acanthis&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;akanthis&quot;, a name for a small now-unidentifiable bird.

Five subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;A. f. flammea&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – north Europe, Siberia, Alaska and Canada
* &quot;A. f. rostrata&quot; (Coues, 1861) – northeast Canada, Greenland and Iceland
* &quot;A. f. cabaret&quot; (Müller, PLS, 1776) – temperate west, central west Palearctic lowland (montane in south) birch and larch woods: British Isles, southwest Scandinavia east to north Germany and south Poland; south to southeast France, Austria and Czech Republic
* &quot;A. f. exilipes&quot; (Coues, 1862) – low (locally high) Arctic tundra birch and willow of north Eurasia, north Alaska and northwest Canada
* &quot;A. f. hornemanni&quot; (Holbøll, 1843) – low (locally high) Arctic tundra birch and willow of far northeast Canada and Greenland

The redpoll was formerly regarded as three separate species: the common redpoll with subspecies &quot;flammea&quot; and &quot;rostrata&quot;, the lesser redpoll with subspecies &quot;cabaret&quot; and the arctic redpoll with subspecies &quot;hornemanni&quot; and &quot;exilipes&quot;. The three species are now considered as conspecific based on the small genetic differences and the continuous phenotypic variation.

==Description==

The redpoll is a small brownish-grey finch with dark streaks and a bright red patch on its forehead. It has a black bib and two pale stripes on the wings. Males&#x27; breasts are often suffused with red. Adults measure between in length and weighing between . Wingspan ranges from 7.5 to 8.7 in (19–22 cm). The rump is streaked and there is a broad dark brown streak across the vent. It has brown legs, a dark-tipped yellowish bill and dark brown irises.

==Distribution and habitat==
The range of the redpoll extends through northern Europe and Asia to northern North America, Greenland and Iceland. It is a partial migrant, moving southward in late autumn and northward again in March and April. Its typical habitat is boreal forests of pines, spruces and larches. It feeds mainly on seeds, principally birch and alder seeds in the winter. 

Redpolls, subspecies &quot;A. f. cabaret&quot;, were introduced into New Zealand between 1862 and 1875. They are now found throughout both the North and South Islands as well as on many outlying islands.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
The redpoll first breed when they are one year old. The female builds the nest, accompanied by the male, often low down in a tree or bush. It has an outer layer of thin twigs, a middle layer of root fibres, fragments of juniper bark and lichens and an inner layer of down, wool and hair. Three to seven speckled eggs are laid. The eggs are with a calculated weight of . They are incubated by the female and hatch after about 11 days. The young are cared for by both parents but are brooded only by the female. The chicks fledge when aged around 13 days. Generally two broods are raised each year.

===Food and feeding===
The diet is mostly very small seeds, especial those from birch trees (&quot;Betula&quot;). In the breeding season some invertebrates are also eaten. It forages mainly in trees but will occasinally forage on the ground.

<doc id="359876" wikidata="Q10965357" url="?curid=359876" title="Twite">
<text>The twite (Linaria flavirostris) is a small brown passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. It is a partially migratory species that is found in northern Europe and across the Palearctic to China. It mainly feeds on small seeds but occasionally also feeds on insects.

==Taxonomy==
In 1758 the Swedish naturalist Carl Linnaeus included the twite in the 10th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Fringilla flavirostris&quot;. The twite and the closely related linnets were at one time placed in the genus &quot;Carduelis&quot; but were moved to the resurrected genus &quot;Linaria&quot; based on a phylogenetic analysis of mitochondrial and nuclear DNA sequences that was published in 2012. The genus had originally been introduced in 1802 by the German naturalist Johann Matthäus Bechstein. The genus name &quot;linaria&quot; is the Latin for a linen-weaver, from &quot;linum&quot;, &quot;flax&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;flavirostris&quot; means &quot;yellow-billed&quot;.

Nine subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;L. f. pipilans&quot; (Latham, 1787) – north Ireland and north Britain (includes &quot;bensonorum&quot;)
* &quot;L. f. flavirostris&quot; (Linnaeus, 1758) – north Scandinavia and northwest Russia
* &quot;L. f. brevirostris&quot; (Bonaparte, 1855) – Turkey, the Caucasus and north Iran
* &quot;L. f. kirghizorum&quot; (Sushkin, 1925) – north, central Kazakhstan
* &quot;L. f. korejevi&quot; (Zarudny &amp; Härms, 1914) – northeast Kazakhstan to northwest China
* &quot;L. f. altaica&quot; (Sushkin, 1925) – southwest Siberia and north, west Mongolia
* &quot;L. f. montanella&quot; (Hume, 1873) – Kyrgyzstan, Tajikistan, north Afghanistan and northwest Pakistan to northwest China (includes &quot;pamirensis&quot;)
* &quot;L. f. miniakensis&quot; (Jacobi, A, 1923) – east Tibet and west China
* &quot;L. f. rufostrigata&quot; (Walton, 1905) – west, south Tibet, north India and north Nepal

==Description==
The twite is similar in size and shape to a linnet, at long. It lacks the red head patch and breast shown by the linnet and the redpolls. It is brown streaked with black above, and a pink rump. The underparts are buff to whitish, streaked with brown. The conical bill is yellow in winter and grey in summer. The call is a distinctive &quot;twit&quot;, from which its name derives, and the song contains fast trills and twitters. Twites can form large flocks outside the breeding season, sometimes mixed with other finches on coasts and salt marshes. They feed mainly on seeds.

==Distribution and habitat==
The twite breeds in northern Europe and across the Palearctic to Siberia and China. Treeless moorland is favoured for breeding. It is partially resident and in winter many birds migrate further south, or move to the coasts. It has declined sharply in parts of its range, notably in Ireland.

==Behaviour==
===Breeding===
The female builds a nest either on the ground or low down in a bush, laying 3–6 eggs. The eggs are light or dark blue in colour with variable dark purplish-brown specs or blotches which are mainly concentrated around the broad end. They are laid daily and measure . They are incubated by the female for 12–13 days. The young are fed and cared for by both parents and fledge when aged 11 to 12 days. They continue to be fed for a further two weeks after leaving the nest.

In the UK, the twite is the subject of several research projects in the Pennines, the Scottish Highlands and on the North Wales and Lancashire coastlines. Records show that the birds to the east of the Pennine hills move to the southeast coast in winter and those to the west winter between Lancashire and the Hebrides. The Welsh population winters almost exclusively in Flintshire. Ringing data has revealed that twite breeding in different parts of Britain use different non‐breeding areas, and that non-breeding areas of British twite do not overlap with non-breeding areas of continental twite.

<text>Mount Kain is a mountain located in the Fraser River Valley of Mount Robson Provincial Park, Canada. Mt. Kain was named during a survey of the Mt. Robson region conducted by the Alpine Club of Canada during the summer of 1911. While surveying from a nearby peak, the party noticed the mountain and guide Conrad Kain exclaimed &quot;Ach! That is my peak.&quot; Trip leader Arthur Oliver Wheeler recorded the peak as Mt. Kain.

<doc id="359884" wikidata="Q424210" url="?curid=359884" title="Aristolochic acid">
<text>Aristolochic acids () are a family of carcinogenic, mutagenic, and nephrotoxic phytochemicals commonly found in the flowering plant family Aristolochiaceae (birthworts). Aristolochic acid (AA) I is the most abundant one. The family Aristolochiaceae includes the genera &quot;Aristolochia&quot; and &quot;Asarum&quot; (wild ginger), which are commonly used in Chinese herbal medicine. Although these compounds are widely associated with kidney problems, liver and urothelial cancers, the use of AA-containing plants for medicinal purposes has a long history. The FDA has issued warnings regarding consumption of AA-containing supplements.

==History==

===Early medical uses===
Birthwort plants, and the aristolochic acids they contain, were quite common in ancient Greek and Roman medical texts, well-established as an herb there by the fifth century BC. Birthworts appeared in Ayurvedic texts by 400 AD, and in Chinese texts later in the fifth century. In these ancient times, it was used to treat kidney and urinary problems, as well as gout, snakebites, and a variety of other ailments. It was also considered to be an effective contraceptive. In many of these cases, birthworts were just some of the many ingredients used to create ointments or salves. In the early first century, in Roman texts, &quot;Aristolochia&quot; is first mentioned as a component of frequently ingested medicines to treat things such as asthma, hiccups, spasms, pains, and expulsion of afterbirth.

===Discovery of toxicity===
====Kidney damage====
Aristolochic acid poisoning was first diagnosed at a clinic in Brussels, Belgium, when cases of nephritis leading to rapid kidney failure were seen in a group of women who had all taken the same weight-loss supplement, &quot;Aristolochia fangchi&quot;, which contained aristolochic acid. This nephritis was termed “Chinese herbs nephropathy” (CHN) due to the origin of the weight-loss supplement. A similar condition previously known as Balkan endemic nephropathy (BEN), first characterized in the 1950s in southeastern Europe, was later discovered to be also the result of aristolochic acid (AA) consumption. BEN is more slowly progressive than the nephritis that is seen in CHN, but is likely caused by low-level AA exposure, possibly from contamination of wheat flour seeds by a plant of the birthwort family, &quot;Aristolochia clematitis&quot;. CHN and BEN fall under the umbrella of what is now known as aristolochic acid nephropathy, the prevalent symptom of AA poisoning.

====Liver cancer====
A study reported in the Science Translational Medicine journal in October 2017 reported high incidents of liver cancer in Asia, particularly Taiwan, which bore the &quot;well-defined mutational signature&quot; of aristolochic acids. The same link was found in Vietnam and other South-east Asian countries. This was compared with much lower rates found in Europe and North America.

==Biosynthesis==
The herbal drug known as aristolochic acid contains a mixture of numerous structurally related nitrophenanthrene carboxylic acids generally consisting of two major compounds: aristolochic acid I (AA-I) and aristolochic acid II (AA-II). The biosynthesis of these compounds has been of considerable interest due in large part to the inclusion of both an aryl carboxylic acid and an aryl nitro functionality (uncommon in natural products) within their structures, which suggested an apparent biogenetic relationship to the well-known aporphine alkaloids. Furthermore, this association thereby suggested a biosynthetic relationship with norlaudanosoline (tetrahydropapaveroline) or related benzylisoquinoline precursors, which in turn are derived from tyrosine (2). Feeding studies (&quot;Aristolochia sipho&quot;) independently using uniquely 14C-labeled compounds [3-14C]-tyrosine, [2-14C]-dopamine and [2-14C]-dihydroxyphenylalanine resulted in the isolation of [14C]-AA-I in each case, which illustrated that the aporphine alkaloid stephanine (11) could be a precursor of AA-I since tyrosine, L-DOPA (3) and dopamine (4) were known precursors of norlaudanosoline: tyrosine (2) is metabolized to -DOPA (3) which is converted into dopamine (4) which is metabolized to 3,4-dihydroxyphenylacetaldehyde (DOPAL); cyclization of these two compounds results in the formation of norlaudanosoline via a Pictet-Spengler like condensation catalyzed by norlaudanosoline synthetase. 

Subsequent feeding studies that used (±)‑[4‑14C]-norlaudanosoline also resulted in the formation of 14C‑labeled-AAI, further suggesting that norlaudanosoline and stephanine (11) could have a possible intermediacy in the biosynthesis of AA-I. Degradation studies of the isolated 14C-labeled AA-I demonstrated that the carbon atom at ring position C4 of the benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline norlaudanosoline was incorporated exclusively in the carboxylic acid moiety of AAI. When this study was repeated but using [4‑14C]-tetrahydropapaverine no labeled AAI was isolated; this observation established that a phenol oxidative reaction was required for the biosynthesis of AA-I from norlaudanosoline, further supporting the intermediacy of aporphine intermediates. The results of a feeding experiment (&quot;A. sipho&quot;) with (±)‑[3‑14C, 15N]-tyrosine followed by degradation of the isolated doubly labeled AA-I provided evidence that the nitro group of AA-I originates from the amino group of tyrosine. 

Confirmation of the involvement of aporphine intermediates in the biogenetic route from norlaudanosoline to AA-I was obtained some two decades later through a series of feeding studies (&quot;Aristolochia bracteata&quot;) using several labeled hypothetical benzyltetrahydroisoquinoline and aporphine precursors. Feeding experiments with (±)‑[5’,8‑3H2; 6-&quot;methoxy&quot;‑14C]-nororientaline resulted in the isolation of the doubly labeled AA-I. Cleavage of the methylenedioxy group with trapping of the resulting 14C‑labeled formaldehyde confirmed that this functionality was formed from the &quot;o&quot;‑methoxyphenol segment of the tetrahydroisoquinoline ring of nororientaline. (±)‑[5’,8‑3H2]‑Orientaline was also incorporated into AA-I. These observations implied that the aporphine prestephanine (10) would be an obligatory intermediate in the biosynthesis, which would involve the intermediacy of the proaporphines orientalinone (8) and orientalinol (9) via the known intramolecular dienone-dienol-phenol sequence for the transformation of benzyltetrahydroisoquinolines to aporphines. A potential role for CYP80G2, a cytochrome P450 that has been demonstrated to catalyze the intramolecular C-C phenol coupling of several benzyltetrahydroisoquinolines, in this orientaline (7) to prestephanine (10) transformation has been suggested. (±)‑[&quot;aryl&quot;‑3H]‑Prestephanine was incorporated into AA-I confirming its intermediacy in the biosynthesis; and also (±)‑[&quot;aryl&quot;‑3H]‑stephanine was incorporated into AA-I. This final transformation, that is stephanine (11) to AA-I (12), involves an uncommon oxidative cleavage of the B ring of the aporphine structure to give a nitro substituted phenanthrene carboxylic acid. Hence, taken together these experiments support the sequence outlined for the biosynthesis of aristolochic acid I from norlaudanosoline.  


==Symptoms and diagnosis==
Exposure to aristolochic acid is associated with a high incidence of uroepithelial tumorigenesis, and is linked to urothelial cancer. Since aristolochic acid is a mutagen, it does damage over time. Patients are often first diagnosed with aristolochic acid nephropathy (AAN), which is a rapidly progressive nephropathy and puts them at risk for renal failure and urothelial cancer. However, urothelial cancer is only observed long after consumption. One study estimated, on average, detectable cancer develops ten years from the start of daily aristolochic acid consumption.

A patient thought to have AAN can be confirmed through phytochemical analysis of plant products consumed and detection of aristolactam DNA adducts in the renal cells. (Aristolochic acid is metabolised into aristolactam.) Additionally, mutated proteins in renal cancers as a result of transversion of A:T pairings to T:A are characteristically seen in aristolochic acid-induced mutations. In some cases, early detection resulting in cessation of aristolochia-product consumption can lead to reverse of the kidney damage.

==Pharmacology==

===Absorption, distribution, metabolism, and excretion===

Once orally ingested, aristolochic acid I is absorbed through the gastrointestinal tract into the blood stream. It is distributed throughout the body via the blood stream.

Aristolochic acids are metabolized by oxidation and reduction pathways, or phase I metabolism. Reduction of aristolochic acid I produces aristolactam I which has been observed in the urine. Further processing of aristolactam I by O-demethylation results in aristolactam Ia, the primary metabolite. Additionally, nitroreduction results in an N-acylnitrenium ion, which can form DNA-base adducts, thus giving aristolochic acid I its mutagenic properties.

Aristolactam I adducts that are bound to DNA are extremely stable; they have been detected in patient biopsy samples taken 20 years after exposure to plants containing aristolochic acid.

Excretion of aristolochic acids and their metabolites is through the urine.

===Mechanism of action===
The exact mechanism of action of aristolochic acid is not known, especially in regards to nephropathy. The carcinogenic effects of aristolochic acids are thought to be a result of mutation of the tumor suppressor gene &quot;TP53&quot;, which seems to be unique to aristolochic acid-associated carcinogenesis. Nephropathy caused by aristolochic acid consumption is not mechanistically understood, but DNA adducts characteristic of aristolochic acid-induced mutations are found in the kidneys of AAN patients, indicating these might play a role.

==Regulation==
In April 2001, the Food and Drug Administration issued a consumer health alert warning against consuming botanical products, sold as &quot;traditional medicines&quot; or as ingredients in dietary supplements, containing aristolochic acid. The agency warned that consumption of aristolochic acid-containing products was associated with &quot;permanent kidney damage, sometimes resulting in kidney failure that has required kidney dialysis or kidney transplantation. In addition, some patients have developed certain types of cancers, most often occurring in the urinary tract.&quot;

In August 2013, two studies identified an aristolochic acid mutational signature in upper urinary tract cancer patients from Taiwan. The carcinogenic effect is the most potent found thus far, exceeding the amount of mutations in smoking-induced lung cancer and UV-exposed melanoma. Exposure to aristolochic acid may also cause certain types of liver cancer.

<text>Paccar Inc. (stylized as PACCAR) is an American company primarily focused on the design and manufacturing of large commercial trucks through its subsidiaries DAF, Kenworth and Peterbilt sold across markets worldwide. The company is headquartered in Bellevue, Washington, in the Seattle metropolitan area, and was founded in 1971 as the successor to the Pacific Car and Foundry Company, from which it draws its name. The company traces its predecessors to the Seattle Car Manufacturing Company formed in 1905. In addition to its principal business, the company also has a parts division, a financial services segment, and manufactures and markets industrial winches. The company&#x27;s stock is a component of the Nasdaq-100 and S&amp;P 500 stock market indices.

==History==
The company was founded by William Pigott Sr. as Seattle Car Manufacturing Company in 1905, with a capitalization of $10,000. Its original business was the production of railway and logging equipment. The company built a new factory in Renton in 1909 after its Duwamish facility was destroyed in fire as well as to fulfill large number of orders. In 1917 it merged with a Portland firm, Twohy Brothers, which was its only competitor on the west coast at the time and company was renamed as Pacific Car and Foundry Company. The company manufactured horse or oxen-drawn logging trucks built specifically to address the dense, hilly forests in which the Northwest logging industry operated to transport massive logs. The following years the company specialized in designing air brakes, open cars, refrigerated boxcars for shipment of perishable items and the universal trailer which could be pulled by a truck. The company also manufactured structural steel that was finished by hand that was used to create columns and girders that went into many Seattle-area buildings. In 1924, the founder, William Pigott sold a controlling interest in the company to American Car and Foundry Company. However, his son, Paul Pigott reacquired a significant interest in the company from American Car and Foundry Company in 1934.

During the Great Depression in 1930 despite the stock market crash, the company&#x27;s earnings rose; but as the Great Depression deepened, Pacific Car and Foundry became one of the most depressed businesses in the Northwest. During the late 1930s, Pacific Car and Foundry received government contracts for steel fabrication for construction of Lacey V. Murrow Memorial Bridge as well as orders from other companies.

===During World War II===
During World War II, Pacific Car and Foundry&#x27;s sales grew due to an increased demand for steel used in airplanes, airports, bridges, naval ships, highways and other equipment that helped build America&#x27;s infrastructure to support the war effort. Pacific Car also sub-contracted for Boeing, building aluminum wing spars for B-17 bombers. During 1942 and 1943 the company also built M4A1 Sherman tanks for the U.S. Army. The company was able to cast almost all the parts for the tanks at its own foundry. Other notable vehicles that were built included the M25 tank transporter, known as the &quot;Dragon Wagon,&quot; and the T28 super-heavy tank. Everett-Pacific Shipbuilding &amp; Dry Dock Company was established in 1942 that built ships and other marine products for the US Navy in Port Gardner Bay in Everett. It was bought by Pacific Car and Foundry in 1944.

===Post-war===
After World War II ended, Pacific Car was a part of the federal government&#x27;s Mobilization Planning Program, which meant that it promised to devote 100 percent of its facilities to military production in the event of a national emergency. The company was a prime contractor during the Korean War for producing tanks. Pacific Car chose to subcontract many of the necessary parts, boosting smaller businesses in the state. In 1945 Pacific Car purchased the Kenworth Motor Truck Corporation. Named after founding stockholders Harry Kent and Edgar Worthington, Kenworth had been producing trucks in Seattle since it was incorporated in 1923. During World War II, Kenworth produced trucks, airplane assemblies and sub-assemblies for the United States military. As the war drew to an end Kenworth shifted attention to production of commercial trucks for the postwar market. In 1956 Kenworth lost independent status and became a division directly under Pacific Car and Foundry.

In 1954, Pacific Car acquired the Dart Truck Company of Kansas City, Missouri, and the Peterbilt Motors Company, of Oakland, California. Dart built primarily heavy off-highway dump trucks and specialty vehicles. Peterbilt had been a major competitor with Kenworth, producing many kinds of trucks and buses. Peterbilt operated as a wholly owned subsidiary of Pacific Car until 1960, following which it was dissolved and made a division of the company. Pacific Car&#x27;s structural steel division made the steel used to build the 50-story Seattle-First National Bank headquarters and to build Seattle&#x27;s Space Needle in 1961. The firm provided 5,668 steel panels, weighing 58,000 tons, which formed a major part of the load bearing walls for New York City&#x27;s World Trade Center twin towers. The World Trade Center, like the Sea-First building, bore the building&#x27;s load on the exterior walls rather than on an interior structural skeleton. The steel panels were shipped by rail from Seattle to New York City on more than 1,600 railcars. Pacific Car was the largest contractor of the 13 steel fabricators that provided steel for the World Trade Center towers.

===The 1970s to 1990s===
In 1970 PACCAR created an overseas manufacturing facility at Bayswater, Melbourne, Australia, producing Kenworth Trucks to serve the growing developing local and Southeast Asian Markets, which still trade strongly today. The first completed locally built truck rolled off the production line in March 1971, and Australian made vehicle exports commenced in 1975. Despite a serious slowdown due to recessions during 1974, PACCAR continued to generate increasing sales throughout the 1970s. PACCAR purchased Wagner Mining Company in 1975, which built underground Mining Vehicles, International Car Company in 1975 and Foden Trucks a British truck manufacturer in 1980. Fodens sold trucks in Europe and Africa. Paccar International was formed in 1972 that promoted exports worldwide. Paccar Technical Center was established in 1980 in Mount Vernon, Washington, as a research and testing facility. The facility included test tracks, engine test cells, materials test laboratories and structural laboratories. The tech center conducts an Open House event every April that coincides with the Skagit Valley Tulip Festival. In 1983 the International Car Co Division in Kenton Ohio, which had been acquired on December 1, 1975, was disbanded. In 1983 the Paccar Rail Leasing Inc subsidiary in Renton WA and the RAILEASE Inc subsidiary in Bellevue WA were disbanded. In 1986 the Pacific Car and Foundry subsidiary in Renton WA was renamed to Paccar Defense Systems Division. In 1984 PACCAR posted record sales in its history of $2.25 billion.

In the mid-1980s, PACCAR share of Class 8 trucks dropped to about 18% owing to aggressive competition from Freightliner Trucks, which is a subsidiary of Daimler AG and the merged operations of Volvo White and General. This competition forced PACCAR to close its Kenworth assembly plant in Kansas City in April, 1986 and its Peterbilt plant in Newark, California, the following October. PACCAR acquired Trico Industries in 1986 which was a manufacturer of oil exploration equipment based in Gardena, California, for $65 million in order to reduce its dependence on the Class 8 Truck market. During the mid-80&#x27;s PACCAR was negotiating with the Rover Group, for acquiring its British Leyland truck division. However, Rover management decided to sell the truck division to DAF Trucks which was a Dutch automotive concern. Its Dart Truck Company and Wagner Mining Equipment Company were sold in 1984 and 1989 in order to remain profitable. In 1987, PACCAR entered the automotive parts &amp; accessories retail market by acquiring Al&#x27;s Auto Supply and Grand Auto Incorporated, giving the company greater ability to weather periods of national economic downturn.

===The 1990s and beyond===
Paccar Parts was created in 1992 in Renton, Washington. The building it was housed in occupied part of the company&#x27;s historic Pacific Car and Foundry site. In the same year, PACCAR purchased a 21 percent stake in Wood Group ESP which added to its oil field equipment manufacturing. In 1993, PACCAR acquired a line of winches from heavy equipment manufacturer Caterpillar. The same year it brought a new plant in Washington on line to help meet the increased demand for trucks. In 1994 the company began selling in New Zealand for the first time and entered new countries in Asia and Central and South America. The company made its Mexican joint venture VILPAC, S.A., a wholly owned subsidiary in 1995. PACCAR&#x27;s Winch division was one of the world&#x27;s largest manufacturer of industrial winches by 1994.

Paccar International marketed trucks to more than 40 countries, and was one of the largest exporters of capital goods in North America by 1995. Kenworth truck factory in Renton, Washington, was opened on June 4, 1993. In 1997 Mark Pigott assumed PACCAR&#x27;s presidency as Charles Pigott retired in 1997. In 1996, the company spent $543 million to acquire DAF Trucks N.V. based in the Netherlands, an acquisition it first pursued back in the mid-1980s. The acquisition was funded in part by the sale of Trico Industries to EVI in 1997. Financial and leasing subsidiaries also performed well in the late 1990s. In 1998, PACCAR acquired UK-based Leyland Trucks, a manufacturer known for its light and medium truck (6 to 44 metric tons) design and manufacture capability. With its Peterbilt, Kenworth, and DAF nameplates, PACCAR ranks second in production numbers in the United States and third in production numbers globally in &quot;big rig&quot; truck production; behind Mercedes-Benz Group in the US market. Other major heavy-truck competitors include International Motors and Volvo.

<text>Mark William Hofmann (born December 7, 1954) is an American counterfeiter, forger, and convicted murderer. Widely regarded as one of the most accomplished forgers in history, Hofmann is especially noted for his creation of fake documents related to the history of the Latter Day Saint movement. When his schemes began to unravel, he constructed bombs to murder three people in Salt Lake City, Utah. The first two bombs killed two people on October 15, 1985. On the following day, a third bomb exploded in Hofmann&#x27;s car. He was arrested for the bombings three months later, and in 1987 pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree murder, one count of theft by deception, and one count of fraud.

==Early life==
Mark Hofmann was born in 1954 in Salt Lake City, Utah, to Lucille (&quot;née&quot; Sears) and William Hofmann (1928–1993). He was raised in the Church of Jesus Christ of Latter-day Saints (LDS Church). He was a below-average student at Olympus High School, but had many hobbies including stage magic, electronics, chemistry, and stamp and coin collecting. Hofmann and his friends were said to have made bombs for fun on the outskirts of Murray, Utah. Hofmann graduated 573 in a class of 700. According to Hofmann, while still a teenage coin collector, he forged a rare mint mark on a dime and was told by an organization of coin collectors that it was genuine.

Like many young men in the LDS Church, Hofmann volunteered to spend two years as an LDS missionary, and in 1973 the church sent him to its mission in Bristol, England. Hofmann told his parents that he had baptized several converts; he did not tell them that he had also perused Fawn M. Brodie&#x27;s biography of Joseph Smith, &quot;No Man Knows My History&quot;. While in England, Hofmann enjoyed investigating bookshops and buying early Mormon material, as well as books critiquing Mormonism. He later told prosecutors that he had lost his faith in the LDS Church and become an atheist around age 14. He had learned that his maternal grandparents had continued to secretly practice polygamy for more than a decade after the church publicly ended the practice (it was not fully renounced until 1904). A former girlfriend believed Hofmann performed his mission only because of social pressure and the desire not to disappoint his parents.

After Hofmann returned from his mission, he enrolled as a pre-med major at Utah State University. In 1979, he married Doralee &quot;Dorie&quot; Olds, and the couple eventually had four children. Dorie Olds Hofmann filed for divorce in 1987, two years after Hofmann&#x27;s crimes came to light, and became co-founder of a holistic medicine company.

==Forgeries==
===Anthon Transcript forgery===
In 1980, Hofmann claimed that he had found a 17th-century King James Bible with a folded paper gummed inside. The document seemed to be the transcript that Smith&#x27;s scribe Martin Harris had presented to Charles Anthon, a Columbia classics professor, in 1828. According to the Mormon scripture Joseph Smith–History, the transcript and its unusual reformed Egyptian characters were copied by Smith from the golden plates from which he translated the Book of Mormon.

Hofmann constructed his version to fit Anthon&#x27;s description of the document, and its discovery made Hofmann&#x27;s reputation. Dean Jessee, a researcher well-versed in early Mormon manuscripts and historical documents (such as of Smith&#x27;s papers) in the Historical Department of the LDS Church, concluded that the document was a Smith holograph. The LDS Church announced the discovery of the Anthon Transcript in April and purchased it from Hofmann for more than US$20,000. Appraised by the LDS Church for US$25,000, it was purchased on October 13 in exchange for several artifacts the church owned in duplicate, including a $5 gold Mormon coin, Deseret banknotes, and a first edition of the Book of Mormon. Assuming the document to be genuine, prominent Mormon academic Hugh Nibley predicted that the discovery promised &quot;as good a test as we&#x27;ll ever get of the authenticity of the Book of Mormon&quot; because he thought the paper might be translated. Zoology professor Barry Fell soon after claimed to have decoded the text.

Hofmann promptly dropped out of school and went into business as a dealer in rare books. He soon fabricated other historically significant documents and became noted among LDS Church history buffs for his &quot;discoveries&quot; of previously unknown materials pertaining to the Latter Day Saint movement. These deceived not only members of the First Presidency – notably Gordon B. Hinckley, then the &quot;de facto&quot; president of the church due to the poor health of more senior leaders – but also document experts and distinguished historians. According to Richard and Joan Ostling, Hofmann was by this time a &quot;closet apostate&quot; motivated not only by greed but also by &quot;the desire to embarrass the church by undermining church history&quot;.

===Joseph Smith III blessing===
During the early 1980s, a significant number of new Mormon documents came into the marketplace. Sometimes the church received these as donations, and others it purchased. According to the Ostlings, &quot;The church publicized some of the acquisitions; it orchestrated public relations for some that were known to be sensitive; others it acquired secretly and suppressed.&quot;

In 1981, Hofmann presented the LDS Church with a document which supposedly provided evidence that Smith had designated his son Joseph Smith III, rather than Brigham Young, as his successor. In a forged cover letter, purportedly written by Thomas Bullock and dated January 27, 1865, Bullock chastises Young for having all copies of the blessing destroyed. Bullock writes that although he believes Young to be the legitimate leader of the LDS Church, he would keep his copy of the blessing. Such a letter, if true, would portray Young and, by extension, the LDS Church, in an unfavorable light.

In February 1981, Hofmann tried to sell the letter to the chief archivist of the LDS Church. He expected the church to &quot;buy the blessing on the spot and &quot;bury&quot; it.&quot; When the archivist balked at the price, Hofmann offered it to the Reorganized Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (RLDS Church; now known as the Community of Christ), which had always claimed that the line of succession had been bestowed on Smith&#x27;s descendants but had never had written proof. A scramble to acquire the document occurred, and Hofmann, posing as a faithful Mormon, presented it to his church in exchange for items worth more than $20,000. Nevertheless, he also ensured that the document would be made public. The next day, a &quot;New York Times&quot; headline read, &quot;Mormon Document Raises Doubts on Succession of Church&#x27;s Leaders,&quot; and the LDS Church was forced to confirm the discovery and publicly present the document to the RLDS Church.

During the race by the Utah and Missouri churches to acquire the blessing document, Hofmann discovered &quot;a lever to exercise enormous power over his church&quot;, a power to &quot;menace and manipulate its leaders with nothing more sinister than a sheet of paper&quot;. Salt Lake County District Attorney&#x27;s investigator Michael George believed that, after Hofmann had successfully forged the blessing, his ultimate goal was to create the lost 116 pages of the Book of Mormon, which he could have filled with inconsistencies and errors, sell them &quot;to the church to be hidden away&quot; and then – as he had done often with embarrassing documents – &quot;make sure its contents were made public.&quot;

===Salamander letter===
Perhaps the most famous of Hofmann&#x27;s Mormon forgeries, the Salamander letter, appeared in 1984. Supposedly written by Martin Harris to W. W. Phelps, the letter presented a version of the recovery of the gold plates that contrasted markedly with the church-sanctioned version of events. Not only did the letter intimate that Smith had been practicing &quot;money digging&quot; through magical practices, but it also replaced the angel that Smith said had appeared to him with a white salamander.

After the letter had been purchased for the church and became public knowledge, LDS Church apostle Dallin H. Oaks asserted to Mormon educators that the words &quot;white salamander&quot; could be reconciled with Smith&#x27;s Angel Moroni because, in the 1820s, the word &quot;salamander&quot; might also refer to a mythical being thought to be able to live in fire, and a &quot;being that is able to live in fire is a good approximation of the description Joseph Smith gave of the Angel Moroni.&quot;

In 1984, longtime critics of Mormonism Jerald and Sandra Tanner became the first to declare the Salamander letter a forgery, despite the fact that it, as well as others of Hofmann&#x27;s purported discoveries, would have strengthened the Tanners&#x27; arguments against the veracity of official Mormon history. Document expert Kenneth W. Rendell later said that while there was &quot;the absence of any indication of forgery in the letter itself, there was also no evidence that it was genuine.&quot;

===Other Mormon forgeries===
No one is certain how many forged documents Hofmann created during the early 1980s, but they included a letter from Smith&#x27;s mother, Lucy Mack Smith, describing the origin of the Book of Mormon; letters from Martin Harris and David Whitmer, two of the Three Witnesses, each giving a personal account of their visions; a contract between Smith and Egbert Bratt Grandin for the printing of the first edition of the Book of Mormon; and two pages of the original Book of Mormon manuscript taken in dictation from Smith to Oliver Cowdery.

In 1983, Hofmann bypassed the LDS Church&#x27;s historical department and sold to Hinckley an 1825 Smith holograph purporting to confirm that Smith had been treasure hunting and practicing magic five years after his First Vision. Hofmann had the signature authenticated by Charles Hamilton, the contemporary &quot;dean of American autograph dealers&quot;, sold the letter to the church for $15,000, and gave his word that no one else had a copy. Hofmann then leaked its existence to the press, after which the church was virtually forced to release the letter to scholars for study, despite previously denying it had it in its possession.

To make this sudden flood of important Mormon documents seem plausible, Hofmann explained that he relied on a network of tipsters, had methodically tracked down modern descendants of early Mormons, and had mined collections of 19th-century letters that had been saved by collectors for their postmarks rather than for their contents. Hofmann also traded in many legitimate historical documents acquired from rare book sellers and collectors. The forgeries were thus intermingled with many legitimate historical documents, which bolstered Hofmann&#x27;s credibility.

===Various forged Americana===
In addition to documents from Mormon history, Hofmann also forged and sold signatures of many famous non-Mormons, including George Washington, John Adams, John Quincy Adams, Daniel Boone, John Brown, Andrew Jackson, Mark Twain, Nathan Hale, John Hancock, Francis Scott Key, Abraham Lincoln, John Milton, Paul Revere, Myles Standish, and Button Gwinnett, whose signature was the rarest, and therefore the most valuable, of any signer of the Declaration of Independence. Hofmann also forged a previously unknown poem in the hand of Emily Dickinson.

But Hofmann&#x27;s grandest scheme was to forge what was perhaps the most famous missing document in American colonial history, the &quot;Oath of a Freeman&quot;. The one-page &quot;Oath&quot; had been printed in 1639, the first document to be printed in Britain&#x27;s American colonies, but only about fifty copies had been made, and none of them were extant. A genuine example was probably worth over US$1 million in 1985, and Hofmann&#x27;s agents began to negotiate a sale to the Library of Congress.

==Murders==

Despite the considerable amounts of money Hofmann had made from document sales, he was deeply in debt, in part because of his increasingly lavish lifestyle and his purchases of genuine first-edition books. In an effort to clear his debts, he attempted to broker a sale of the &quot;McLellin collection&quot; – a supposedly extensive group of documents written by William E. McLellin, an early Mormon apostle who eventually broke with the LDS Church. Hofmann hinted that the McLellin collection would provide revelations unfavorable to the LDS Church. It was already known that McLellin had written various letters and papers dealing with controversial subjects in Joseph Smith&#x27;s life; in 1879 the RLDS Church printed a letter from McLellin to Joseph Smith III stating that the elder Smith&#x27;s wife, Emma, knew and disapproved of her husband&#x27;s adultery. When McLellin was visited by this same Joseph Smith III, McLellin asserted: &quot;Emma Smith told him [McLellin] that Joseph was both a polygamist and an adulterer.&quot;

However, Hofmann had no idea where the McLellin collection was, nor did he have the time to forge a suitably large group of documents. Those to whom Hofmann had promised documents or repayments of debts began to hound him, and the sale of the &quot;Oath of a Freeman&quot; was delayed by questions about its authenticity. 

In an effort to buy more time, Hofmann began constructing bombs. On October 15, 1985, he first killed document collector Steven Christensen (as well as injuring a secretary in the leg with shrapnel). Later the same day, a second bomb killed Kathy Sheets, the wife of Christensen&#x27;s former employer. As Hofmann had intended, police initially suspected that the bombings were related to the impending collapse of an investment business of which Sheets&#x27;s husband, J. Gary Sheets, was the principal and Christensen his protégé.

The following day, Hofmann himself was severely injured when a bomb exploded in his Toyota MR2. Although police quickly focused on Hofmann as the suspect in the bombings, some of his business associates went into hiding, fearing they might also become victims.

==Trial and sentencing==
During the bombing investigation, police discovered evidence of the forgeries in Hofmann&#x27;s basement. They also found the engraving plant where the forged plate for &quot;Oath of a Freeman&quot; was made. Document examiner George Throckmorton analyzed several Hofmann documents that had previously been deemed authentic and determined they were forgeries. Three letters purportedly written from an Illinois prison by Smith used different ink, paper, and writing instruments. Because the letters had been authenticated by different experts, the inconsistencies had earlier escaped detection. Throckmorton also discovered that some documents, supposedly written by different people, had similar writing styles and that they had been written with homemade iron gall ink that looked cracked like alligator skin under a microscope, although authentic period ink did not. Investigators also found that a poem used to authenticate the handwriting in the Salamander Letter had been forged by Hofmann and inserted in a &quot;Book of Common Prayer&quot; once owned by Martin Harris.

Hofmann was arrested in January 1986 and charged on four indictments totaling 27 counts, including first-degree murder, delivering a bomb, constructing or possessing a bomb, theft by deception, and communication fraud. A fifth indictment, containing an additional five counts of theft by deception, was added later in January. Hofmann initially maintained his innocence. However, at a preliminary hearing, prosecutors produced voluminous evidence of his forgeries and debts, as well as evidence linking him to the bombs. During the investigations, many of the prosecution team became convinced that they were being stonewalled by leaders of the LDS Church. Chief investigator Jim Bell said, &quot;They&#x27;re hiding something; the church is doing everything it can to make this as difficult as possible. I&#x27;ve never seen anything like this in a homicide investigation.&quot;

Hofmann not only faced the prospect of the death penalty in Utah but was indicted on federal charges of possession of an unregistered Uzi machine pistol. New York prosecutors also sought an indictment for the fraudulent sale of &quot;Oath of a Freeman&quot;. In January 1987, Hofmann pleaded guilty to two counts of second-degree murder, one count of theft by deception for forging the Salamander Letter, and one count of fraud for the bogus sale of the McLellin collection. The fact that Hofmann got off with a plea bargain instead of going to trial, where he would likely have faced the death penalty if found guilty, was quite puzzling to a reporter from the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, who wrote, &quot;In any other state, you&#x27;d see this thing go on trial, because that&#x27;s how prosecutors&#x27; reputations are made. Going to trial and getting bad guys, big splashes, lots of exposure. Here you have a nice plea bargain.&quot;

Hofmann agreed to confess his forgeries in open court, in return for which prosecutors in Utah and New York dropped additional charges against him. He was sentenced to five years to life, but the judge recommended that Hofmann never be released. Utah has an indeterminate sentencing scheme. Prison sentences have a minimum and maximum time frame; offenders must serve their entire sentence unless the Utah Board of Pardons and Parole opts to grant them parole sooner. The five-years-to-life sentence was the minimum possible under Utah sentencing guidelines of the time; changes to sentencing guidelines have since increased the minimum sentence for murder to 15 years to life.

In 1988, Hofmann told the Board of Pardons that he thought planting the bomb that killed Kathy Sheets was &quot;almost a game ... at the time I made the bomb, my thoughts were that it didn&#x27;t matter if it was Mrs. Sheets, a child, a dog ... whoever&quot; [was killed]. Within the hour the board, citing Hofmann&#x27;s &quot;callous disregard for human life&quot;, decided that he would indeed spend the remainder of his &quot;natural life in prison&quot;. Hofmann also told investigator Michael George that he was bewildered by the attention paid to his murder victims: &quot;I don&#x27;t feel anything for them. My philosophy is that they&#x27;re &quot;dead&quot;. They&#x27;re not suffering. I think life is basically worthless. They could have died just as easily in a car accident. I don&#x27;t believe in God. I don&#x27;t believe in an afterlife. &quot;They don&#x27;t know they&#x27;re dead&quot;.&quot;

After Hofmann was imprisoned, he was excommunicated by the LDS Church and his wife filed for divorce. Hofmann attempted suicide in his cell by taking an overdose of antidepressants. He was revived, but not before spending twelve hours lying on his right arm and blocking its circulation, thus causing muscle atrophy. His forging hand was thereby permanently disabled.

Hofmann, Utah Department of Corrections offender number 41235, was originally incarcerated at Utah State Prison in Draper. However, in 2016, he was transferred to Central Utah Correctional Facility in Gunnison.

==Influence==
As a master forger, Hofmann deceived a number of renowned document experts during his short career. Some of his forgeries were accepted by scholars for years, and an unknown number of them may still be in circulation. But it is Hofmann&#x27;s forgeries of Mormon documents that have had the greatest historical significance. In August 1987, the sensationalist aspects of the Hofmann case led apostle Dallin H. Oaks to believe that church members had witnessed &quot;some of the most intense LDS Church-bashing since the turn of the [20th] century.&quot;

A student of Mormonism, Jan Shipps, agreed that press reports &quot;contained an astonishing amount of innuendo associating Hofmann&#x27;s plagiarism with Mormon beginnings. Myriad reports alleged secrecy and cover-up on the part of LDS general authorities, and not a few writers referred to the way in which a culture that rests on a found scripture is particularly vulnerable to the offerings of con-artists.&quot;

According to the Ostlings, the Hofmann forgeries could only have been perpetrated &quot;in connection with the curious mixture of paranoia and obsessiveness with which Mormons approach church history.&quot; After Hofmann&#x27;s exposure, the LDS Church tried to correct the record, but the &quot;public relations damage as well as the forgery losses meant the church was also a Hofmann victim.&quot; Robert Lindsey has also suggested that Hofmann &quot;stimulated a burst of historical inquiry regarding Joseph Smith&#x27;s youthful enthusiasm for magic [that] did not wither after his conviction&quot;.

==Portrayal in media==
A three-part documentary series about Hofmann&#x27;s illegal activities, entitled &quot;Murder Among the Mormons&quot;, premiered on Netflix on March 3, 2021. The limited series debuted for the week ending March 7, 2021, as the third most streamed video on demand original-content program, according to Nielsen streaming ratings with 587 million viewer minutes.

The events were a part of the series, &quot;City Confidential&quot; in the 1998 episode, &quot;Faith and Foul Play in Salt Lake City&quot;.

The murders were also covered by a 1997 episode of &quot;Forensic Files&quot;, &quot;Postal Mortem&quot;, and a 2010 episode of &quot;Who the (Bleep) Did I Marry?&quot;, &quot;An Explosive Love&quot;. 

Hofmann&#x27;s crimes are fictionalized in the 2000 &quot;The X-Files&quot; episode &quot;Hollywood A.D.&quot; and in the episode &quot;The Saint&quot;, &quot;Law &amp; Order: Criminal Intent&quot; (2004), where the forger is portrayed by Stephen Colbert.
A 2003 BBC documentary about Hofmann is entitled &quot;The Man Who Forged America&quot;.

<text>Mount Galatea is the highest peak of the Kananaskis Range, a subrange of the Canadian Rockies in the province of Alberta. It is located in the upper Spray Lakes Valley of the Kananaskis Country system of provincial parks. The mountain was named after the Royal Navy cruiser HMS &quot;Galatea&quot;.

==Geology==
Mount Galatea is composed of sedimentary rock laid down during the Precambrian to Jurassic periods. Formed in shallow seas, this sedimentary rock was pushed east and over the top of younger rock during the Laramide orogeny.

==Climate==
Based on the Köppen climate classification, Mount Galatea is located in a subarctic climate zone with cold, snowy winters, and mild summers. Winter emperatures can drop below −20 °C with wind chill factors below −30 °C.

<text>Actinopteri () is the sister group of Cladistia (bichirs) in the class Actinopterygii (ray-finned fish).

Dating back to the Permian period, the Actinopteri comprise the Chondrostei (sturgeons and paddlefish), the Holostei (bowfins and gars), and the teleosts; in other words, all extant ray-finned fish other than the bichirs.

In this clade the lungs have evolved into a swim bladder.

Characters of Actinopteri include paired fin structure, a single dorsal fin, fulcra, a large median gular and numerous branchiostegals, ganoid scales, and a valvula cerebelli in the brain.

==Classification==
The following cladogram summarizes the evolutionary relationships of extant Actinopteri. Divergence time for each clade in mya are based on:

<text>David Norman Dinkins (July 10, 1927 – November 23, 2020) was an American politician, lawyer, and author who served as the 106th mayor of New York City from 1990 to 1993.

Dinkins was among the more than 20,000 Montford Point Marines, the first African-American U.S. Marines, from 1945 to 1946. He graduated &quot;cum laude&quot; from Howard University and received his law degree from Brooklyn Law School in 1956. A longtime member of Harlem&#x27;s Carver Democratic Club, Dinkins began his electoral career by serving in the New York State Assembly in 1966, eventually advancing to Manhattan borough president. He won the 1989 New York City mayoral election, becoming the first African American to hold the office. After losing re-election in 1993, Dinkins joined the faculty of Columbia University while remaining active in municipal politics.

==Early life and education==
Dinkins was born in Trenton, New Jersey, to Sarah &quot;Sally&quot; Lucy Dinkins, a domestic worker, and William Harvey Dinkins Jr., a barber and real estate agent. His parents separated when he was six years old, after which he was raised by his father. Dinkins moved to Harlem as a child before returning to Trenton. He attended Trenton Central High School, where he graduated in 1945.

Upon graduating, Dinkins attempted to enlist in the United States Marine Corps but was told that a racial quota had been filled. After traveling the Northeastern United States, he finally found a recruiting station that had not, in his words, &quot;filled their quota for Negro Marines&quot;; however, World War II was over before Dinkins finished boot camp. He served in the Marine Corps from July 1945 through August 1946, attaining the rank of private first class. Dinkins was among the Montford Point Marines who received the Congressional Gold Medal from the United States Senate and House of Representatives.

Dinkins graduated &quot;&quot; from Howard University with a bachelor&#x27;s degree in mathematics in 1950. He received his LL.B. from Brooklyn Law School in 1956.

==Political career==
=== Early and middle career ===
While maintaining a private law practice from 1956 to 1975, Dinkins rose through the Democratic Party organization in Harlem, beginning at the Carver Democratic Club under the aegis of J. Raymond Jones. He became part of an influential group of African American politicians that included Denny Farrell, Percy Sutton, Basil Paterson, and Charles Rangel; the latter three together with Dinkins were known as the &quot;Gang of Four&quot;. As an investor, Dinkins was one of fifty African American investors who helped Sutton found Inner City Broadcasting Corporation in 1971.

Dinkins briefly represented the 78th District of the New York State Assembly in 1966. From 1972 to 1973, he was president of the New York City Board of Elections. In late 1973, he was poised to take office as New York City&#x27;s first Black deputy mayor in the administration of Mayor-elect Abraham D. Beame; however, the appointment was not effectuated amid &quot;difficulties that stemmed from [Dinkins&#x27;] failure to pay federal, state or city personal income taxes for four years.&quot; Instead, he served as city clerk (characterized by Robert D. McFadden as a &quot;patronage appointee who kept marriage licenses and municipal records&quot;) from 1975 to 1985. He was elected Manhattan borough president in 1985 on his third run for that office. On November 7, 1989, Dinkins was elected mayor of New York City, defeating three-term incumbent mayor Ed Koch and two others in the Democratic primary and Republican nominee Rudy Giuliani in the general election. During his campaign, Dinkins sought the blessing and endorsement of Rabbi Menachem Mendel Schneerson, the Lubavitcher Rebbe.

Dinkins was elected in the wake of a corruption scandal that stemmed from the decline of longtime Brooklyn Democratic Party chairman and preeminent New York City political leader Meade Esposito&#x27;s American Mafia-influenced patronage network, ultimately precipitating the suicide of Queens Borough President Donald Manes and a series of criminal convictions among the city&#x27;s Democratic leadership. In March 1989, the New York City Board of Estimate (which served as the primary governing instrument of various patronage networks for decades, often superseding the mayoralty in influence) also was declared unconstitutional under the Fourteenth Amendment&#x27;s Equal Protection Clause by the Supreme Court of the United States; this prompted the empanelment of the New York City Charter Revision Commission, which abolished the Board of Estimate and assigned most of its responsibilities to an enlarged New York City Council via a successful referendum in November. Koch, the presumptive Democratic nominee, was politically damaged by his administration&#x27;s ties to the Esposito network and his handling of racial issues, exemplified by his fealty to affluent interests in predominantly white areas of Manhattan. This enabled Dinkins to attenuate public perceptions of his previous patronage appointments and emerge as a formidable, reform-minded challenger to Koch. Additionally, the fact that Dinkins was African American helped him to avoid criticism that he was ignoring the Black vote by campaigning to whites. While a large turnout of African American voters was important to his election, Dinkins campaigned throughout the city. Dinkins&#x27; campaign manager was political consultant William Lynch Jr., who became one of his first deputy mayors.

===Mayoralty===
====Crime====

Dinkins entered office in January 1990 pledging racial healing, and famously referred to New York City&#x27;s demographic diversity as &quot;not a melting pot, but a gorgeous mosaic&quot;. The crime rate in New York City had risen alarmingly during the 1980s, and the rate of homicide in particular reached an all-time high of 2,245 cases during 1990, the first year of the Dinkins administration. The rates of most crimes, including all categories of violent crime, then declined during the remainder of his four-year term. That ended a 30-year upward spiral and initiated a trend of falling rates that continued and accelerated beyond his term. However, the high absolute levels, the peak early in his administration, and the only modest decline subsequently (homicide down 12% from 1990 to 1993) resulted in Dinkins&#x27; suffering politically from the perception that crime remained out of control on his watch. Dinkins in fact initiated a hiring program that expanded the police department nearly 25%. &quot;The New York Times&quot; reported, &quot;He obtained the State Legislature&#x27;s permission to dedicate a tax to hire thousands of police officers, and he fought to preserve a portion of that anticrime money to keep schools open into the evening, an award-winning initiative that kept tens of thousands of teenagers off the street.&quot;

Dinkins&#x27; term was marked by a greater push toward accountability and oversight regarding police misconduct, which led to friction between Dinkins and the city&#x27;s Patrolmen&#x27;s Benevolent Association (PBA). In 1992, Dinkins proposed a bill to change the leadership of the Civilian Complaint Review Board (CCRB), the oversight body that examined complaints of police misconduct, from half-cop–half-civilian to all civilian and make it independent of the New York Police Department. Following the Washington Heights Riot, fueled by the beating of Jose &quot;Kiko&quot; Garcia, an undocumented Dominican Republic immigrant, by a police officer, Dinkins attempted to defuse tensions by inviting Garcia&#x27;s family to Gracie Mansion. This gesture outraged the city&#x27;s PBA, who claimed Dinkins&#x27;s actions showed favoritism toward Garcia and bias against the police. To condemn Dinkins&#x27; position on policing, the city PBA organized a protest on September 16, 1992, which quickly turned violent when nearly 4,000 off-duty police officers blocked traffic on the Brooklyn Bridge and knocked over police barricades in an attempt to rush City Hall. The nearly 300 uniformed on-duty officers did little to control the riot. Despite the riot and objections from the PBA, the CCRB was reorganized and made independent from the police department in July 1993.

====Dealmaking====
Dinkins was rebuffed in his attempt to end the licensing of locksmiths.

During his final days in office, Dinkins made last-minute negotiations with the sanitation workers, presumably to preserve the public status of garbage removal. Giuliani, who had defeated Dinkins in the 1993 mayoral race, blamed Dinkins for a &quot;cheap political trick&quot; when Dinkins planned the resignation of Victor Gotbaum, Dinkins&#x27; appointee on the board of education, thus guaranteeing Gotbaum&#x27;s replacement six months in office. Dinkins also signed a last-minute 99-year lease with the USTA National Tennis Center. By negotiating a fee for New York City based on the event&#x27;s gross income, the Dinkins administration made a deal with the US Open that brings more economic benefit to the City of New York each year than the New York Yankees, New York Mets, New York Knicks, and New York Rangers combined. The city&#x27;s revenue-producing events Fashion Week, Restaurant Week, and Broadway on Broadway were all created under Dinkins.

====Other longterm matters====
Dinkins&#x27;s term was marked by polarizing events such as the Family Red Apple boycott, a boycott of a Korean-owned grocery in Flatbush, Brooklyn, and the 1991 Crown Heights riot. When Lemrick Nelson was acquitted of murdering Yankel Rosenbaum during the Crown Heights riots, Dinkins said, &quot;I have no doubt that in this case the criminal-justice system has operated fairly and openly.&quot; Later he wrote in his memoirs, &quot;I continue to fail to understand that verdict.&quot;

In 1991, when &quot;Iraqi Scud missiles were falling&quot; in Israel and the Mayor&#x27;s press secretary said &quot;security would be tight and gas masks would be provided for the contingent&quot;, Mayor Dinkins visited Israel as a sign of support.

The Dinkins administration was adversely affected by a declining economy, which led to lower tax revenue and budget shortfalls. Nevertheless, Dinkins&#x27; mayoralty was marked by a number of significant achievements. New York City&#x27;s crime rate, including the murder rate, declined in Dinkins&#x27; final years in office; Dinkins persuaded the state legislature to dedicate certain tax revenue for crime control (including an increase in the size of the New York Police Department along with after-school programs for teenagers), and he hired Raymond W. Kelly as police commissioner. Times Square was cleaned up during Dinkins&#x27; term, and he persuaded The Walt Disney Company to rehabilitate the old New Amsterdam Theatre on 42nd Street. The city negotiated a 99-year lease of city park space to the United States Tennis Association to create the USTA National Tennis Center (which Mayor Michael Bloomberg later called &quot;the only good athletic sports stadium deal, not just in New York, but in the country&quot;). Dinkins continued an initiative begun by Ed Koch to rehabilitate dilapidated housing in northern Harlem, the South Bronx, and Brooklyn; overall more housing was rehabilitated in Dinkins&#x27; only term than Giuliani&#x27;s two terms. With the support of Governor Mario Cuomo, the city invested in supportive housing for mentally ill homeless people and achieved a decrease in the size of the city&#x27;s homeless shelter population to its lowest point in two decades.

===1993 election===

In 1993, Dinkins lost to Republican Rudy Giuliani in a rematch of the 1989 election. Dinkins earned 48.3 percent of the vote, down from 51 percent in 1989. One factor in his loss was his perceived indifference to the plight of the Jewish community during the Crown Heights riot. Another was a strong turnout for Giuliani in Staten Island; a referendum on Staten Island&#x27;s secession from New York was placed on the ballot that year by Democratic Governor Mario Cuomo and the New York State Legislature.

==Later career==

From 1994 until his death, Dinkins was a professor of professional practice at the Columbia University School of International and Public Affairs.

Dinkins was a member of the board of directors of the United States Tennis Association. He served on the boards of the New York City Global Partners, the Children&#x27;s Health Fund, the Association to Benefit Children, and the Nelson Mandela Children&#x27;s Fund. Dinkins was also on the advisory board of Independent News &amp; Media and the Black Leadership Forum, was a member of the Council on Foreign Relations, and served as chairman emeritus of the board of directors of the National Black Leadership Commission on AIDS.

Dinkins&#x27; radio program &quot;Dialogue with Dinkins&quot; aired on WLIB radio in New York City from 1994 to 2014. His memoirs, &quot;A Mayor&#x27;s Life: Governing New York&#x27;s Gorgeous Mosaic&quot;, written with Peter Knobler, were published in 2013.

Although he never attempted a political comeback, Dinkins remained somewhat active in politics after his mayorship, and his endorsements of various candidates, including Mark Green in the 2001 mayoral race, were well-publicized. He supported Democrats Fernando Ferrer in the 2005 New York mayoral election, Bill Thompson in 2009, and Bill de Blasio in 2013. During the 2004 Democratic presidential primaries, Dinkins endorsed and actively campaigned for Wesley Clark. In the campaign for the 2008 Democratic presidential nomination, Dinkins served as an elected delegate from New York for Hillary Clinton. During the 2020 Democratic presidential primaries, Dinkins endorsed former Mayor Michael Bloomberg for president on February 25, 2020, just before a Democratic debate.

Dinkins sat on the board of directors and in 2013 was on the Honorary Founders Board of The Jazz Foundation of America. He worked with that organization to save the homes and lives of America&#x27;s elderly jazz and blues musicians, including musicians who survived Hurricane Katrina. He served on the boards of the Children&#x27;s Health Fund (CHF), the Association to Benefit Children, and the Nelson Mandela Children&#x27;s Fund (NMCF). Dinkins was also chairman emeritus of the board of directors of the National Black Leadership Commission on AIDS. He was a champion of college access, serving on the Posse Foundation National Board of Directors until his death in 2020.

The David N. Dinkins Municipal Building in Manhattan was named after the former mayor in 2015 by mayor Bill de Blasio.

==Personal life==

Dinkins married Joyce Burrows, the daughter of Harlem political eminence Daniel L. Burrows, in August 1953. They had two children, David Jr. and Donna. When Dinkins became mayor of New York City, Joyce retired from her position at the State Department of Taxation and Finance. The couple were members of the Church of the Intercession in New York City. Joyce died on October 11, 2020, at the age of 89.

Dinkins was a member of Alpha Phi Alpha and Sigma Pi Phi (&quot;the Boule&quot;), the oldest collegiate and first professional Greek-letter fraternities, respectively, established for African Americans. He was raised as a Master Mason in King David Lodge No. 15, F. &amp; A. M., PHA, located in Trenton, New Jersey, in 1952.

In 1994, Dinkins was part of an Episcopal Church delegation to Haiti.

Dinkins was hospitalized in New York on October 31, 2013, for treatment of pneumonia. He was hospitalized again for pneumonia on February 19, 2016.

Dinkins starred as himself on April 13, 2018, in &quot;Risk Management&quot;, the 19th episode of the 8th season of the CBS police procedural drama &quot;Blue Bloods&quot;.

===Death===
On November 23, 2020, Dinkins died from unspecified natural causes at his home on the Upper East Side of Manhattan, about a month after his wife&#x27;s death. He was 93.
