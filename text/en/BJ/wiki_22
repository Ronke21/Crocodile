<text>Alternative metal (also known as alt-metal) is a genre of heavy metal music that combines heavy metal with influences from alternative rock and other genres not normally associated with metal. Alternative metal bands are often characterized by heavily downtuned, mid-paced guitar riffs, a mixture of accessible melodic vocals and harsh vocals and sometimes sounds that are unconventional within other heavy metal styles. The term has been in use since the 1980s, although it came into prominence in the 1990s.

Other genres considered part of the alternative metal movement included rap metal and funk metal, both of which influenced another prominent subgenre, nu metal. Nu metal expands the alternative metal sound, combining its vocal stylings and downtuned riffs with elements of other genres, such as hip hop, funk, thrash metal, hardcore punk and industrial metal.

Alternative metal began in the 1980s with bands like Faith No More, Living Colour, Soundgarden, and Jane&#x27;s Addiction. The genre achieved success in the 1990s with the popularity of bands like Helmet, Tool, and Alice in Chains. In the late 1990s and early 2000s, nu metal achieved mainstream popularity with the mainstream success of bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit, P.O.D., Papa Roach, Disturbed, System of a Down, Linkin Park, Slipknot, Deftones and Staind. After the mid-2000s, nu metal&#x27;s popularity began to decline, with many nu metal bands moving on to other genres. 

==Characteristics==

The genre is generally considered a fusion between alternative rock and heavy metal, although AllMusic states &quot;alt-metal is a far-reaching term that has been used to describe everyone from Hammerlock to Neurosis to Ministry to Limp Bizkit&quot;. They also remarked that alternative metal was originally &quot;a style united by its nonconformist sensibility rather than any immediately classifiable sound.&quot;

One of the main characteristics of alternative metal and its subgenres are heavily downtuned, mid-paced &quot;chug&quot;-like guitar riffs. However, funk metal bands often use a more conventional riffing style influenced by 1980s thrash metal. Alternative metal features clean and melodic vocals, influenced by those of alternative rock, in contrast to other heavy metal subgenres. Later bands frequently incorporated vocal styles that alternated between clean singing, growls and screaming. Examples include alternative metal bands associated with the nu metal movement, such as Korn and Deftones, who have been described as having &quot;bipolar vocals&quot;.

Jonathan Gold of the &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot; wrote in 1990 &quot;Just as rock has an alternative, [left] wing-bands like the Replacements and Dinosaur Jr.-so does metal. Alternative metal is alternative music that rocks. And alternative metal these days can reach 10 times the audience of other alternative rock. Jane&#x27;s Addiction plays an intense brand of &#x27;70s-influenced arty metal; so does Soundgarden. In fact, the arty meanderings of Sabbath and Zeppelin themselves would be considered alternative metal.&quot; &quot;Houston Press&quot; has described the genre as being a &quot;compromise for people for whom Nirvana was not heavy enough but Metallica was too heavy.&quot;

The first wave of alternative metal bands emerged from many backgrounds, including hardcore punk (Bad Brains, Rollins Band, Life of Agony, Corrosion of Conformity), noise rock (Helmet, the Jesus Lizard, Today Is the Day), Seattle&#x27;s grunge scene (Alice in Chains, Soundgarden), stoner rock (Clutch, Kyuss), sludge metal (Fudge Tunnel, Melvins), gothic metal (Type O Negative), groove metal (Pantera, White Zombie) and industrial (Godflesh, Nine Inch Nails, Ministry). These bands never formed a distinct movement or scene; rather they were bound by their incorporation of traditional metal influences and openness to experimentation. Jane&#x27;s Addiction borrowed from art rock and progressive rock, Quicksand blended post-hardcore and Living Colour injected funk into their sound, for example, while Primus were influenced by progressive rock, thrash metal and funk and Faith No More mixed progressive rock, R&amp;B, funk and hip hop. Fudge Tunnel&#x27;s style of alternative metal included influences from both sludge metal and noise rock.

==History==
===Origins (1980s)===

The origins of the genre can be traced back to funk rock music of the early to mid-1980s, when alternative bands like Fishbone, Faith No More and the Red Hot Chili Peppers started mixing heavy metal with funk, creating the alternative metal subgenre funk metal. Other early bands in the genre also came from hardcore punk backgrounds. Bands such as Faith No More, Jane&#x27;s Addiction and Soundgarden are recognized as some of the earliest alternative metal acts, with all three of these bands emerging around the same time, and setting the template for the genre by mixing heavy metal music with a variety of different genres in the mid to late 1980s. During the 1980s, alternative metal appealed mainly to alternative rock fans, since virtually all 1980s alt-metal bands had their roots in the American independent rock scene. Living Colour was another alternative metal band that combined the genre with funk metal.

===Expansion and mainstream popularity (early–mid 1990s)===

The emergence of grunge as a popular style of rock music in the early 1990s helped make alternative metal more acceptable to a mainstream audience, with alternative metal soon becoming the most popular metal style of the 1990s. Several bands associated with the genre denied their status as metal bands. Helmet drummer John Stanier said &quot;We fell into the whole metal thing by accident, we always hated it when people mentioned metal in conjunction with us.&quot; Helmet&#x27;s &quot;Meantime&quot; (1992) album became one of the most influential heavy metal albums of the 1990s. Saby Reyes-Kulkarni of &quot;Pitchfork Media&quot; stated &quot;bands like Faith No More, Soundgarden, Primus, Helmet, the Rollins Band, and dozens more were initially marketed as quasi-metal acts. This was only possible in a climate where record labels, journalists, and college radio DJs understood that the metal audience could embrace new, albeit arty variations on the form.&quot; The alternative music festival Lollapalooza conceived by Jane&#x27;s Addiction singer Perry Farrell, helped bands associated with the movement such as Tool, Rage Against the Machine, Primus, Nine Inch Nails, Soundgarden, and Alice in Chains gain exposure. The progressive rock-influenced band Tool became a leading band in the alternative metal genre with the release of their 1993 debut album &quot;Undertow&quot;; Tool&#x27;s popularity in the mid-&#x27;90s helped kick off an era of bands with alt-metal tendencies also classified in other genres like industrial (Nine Inch Nails) and rap rock (Rage Against the Machine). &quot;Spin&quot; stated in August 1998 that &quot;It was Helmet that spawned the idea of alternative metal with the punk crutch of 1992&#x27;s &quot;Meantime&quot; [and] bands such as Rage Against the Machine took the concept a crucial step further, integrating hip hop to connect with skate rat kids raised on Metallica and Run D.M.C.&quot; Many established 1980s metal bands released albums in the 1990s that were described as alternative metal, including Anthrax, Metallica and Mötley Crüe. Bands like Life of Agony combined alternative metal with hardcore punk influences. Life of Agony&#x27;s debut album &quot;River Runs Red&quot; combined alternative metal with influences of hardcore punk, with lyrics about depression and suicide.

===Emergence of nu metal and commercial peak (late 1990s – early 2000s)===
In the latter part of the 1990s, a second, more aggressive wave of alternative metal emerged; dubbed nu metal, it often relied on hardcore punk, groove/thrash metal, industrial and hip hop influences, as opposed to the influences of the first wave of alternative metal bands, with this style subsequently becoming more popular than regular alternative metal. It resulted in a more standardized sound among alternative metal bands, in contrast to the more eccentric and unclassifiable early alternative metal bands. Korn, a band formed in 1993, released their self-titled debut the following year, which is widely considered to be the first nu metal release. MTV stated that Korn &quot;arrived in 1993 into the burgeoning alternative metal scene, which would morph into nü-metal the way college rock became alternative rock.&quot; &quot;Stereogum&quot; similarly claimed that nu metal was a &quot;weird outgrowth of the Lollapalooza-era alt-metal scene&quot;. During the late 1990s and early 2000s, nu metal was prevalent in the mainstream, with bands such as Korn, Limp Bizkit, Linkin Park, Slipknot and Staind all attaining success. AllMusic has compared nu and alternative metal&#x27;s commercial success during this period to the rise of the glam metal phenomenon in the 1980s, stating that it is &quot;ironic, given alternative metal&#x27;s vehement rejection of hair metal&#x27;s attitude.&quot; Some nu metal bands managed to push musical boundaries while still remaining commercially viable, such as Mudvayne (who combined progressive elements) and Deftones, who have incorporated post-hardcore and dream pop influences.

Korn&#x27;s 1998 album &quot;Follow the Leader&quot; and 1999 album &quot;Issues&quot; sold 3.6 million and 3.2 million copies in the United States, respectively, and the band&#x27;s 2002 album &quot;Untouchables&quot; sold 1.4 million. Korn&#x27;s eponymous debut (1994) and second album &quot;Life is Peachy&quot; (1996) sold 2.1 million and 1.8 million copies, respectively. Limp Bizkit&#x27;s &quot;Significant Other&quot; (1999) and &quot;Chocolate Starfish and the Hot Dog Flavored Water&quot; (2000) sold over seven million and six million, respectively. Korn and Limp Bizkit were frequently featured on MTV, often hitting number 1 and having multiple retired videos on the popular MTV show &quot;Total Request Live&quot;, competing on the show with boy bands like N&#x27;Sync and Backstreet Boys. Papa Roach&#x27;s album &quot;Infest&quot; (2000) went triple platinum and was supported by the hit single &quot;Last Resort&quot;. Bands like P.O.D. and Linkin Park also had widespread popularity.

Joel McIver believes that the band Tool is important to the development of this genre; he wrote in his book &quot;Unleashed: The Story of Tool&quot;, &quot;By 1996 and &#x27;97 the wave of alternative metal spearheaded by Tool in the wake of grunge was beginning to evolve into nu-metal&quot;. However, Tool&#x27;s vocalist Maynard James Keenan was quick to separate himself from this movement saying &quot;I&#x27;m sick of that whole attitude. The one that puts Tool in with [nu] metal bands. The press... can&#x27;t seem to distinguish between alternative and metal.&quot; Other alternative metal bands considered influential to the nu metal genre such as Helmet have also tried to distance themselves from the movement.

===Decline in nu metal and continuity in popularity of alternative metal (2003–2009)===

In 2004, nu metal&#x27;s popularity was declining, with bands like Korn, Limp Bizkit and P.O.D. having a decline in album sales. Instead, post-grunge bands like Nickelback were selling the most records and being promoted the most on radio. Additionally, many nu metal bands began to move away from the nu metal genre and moved on to other genres.

===Mainstream decline (2010s)===
In 2016, Jason Heller of &quot;Vice&quot; wrote &quot;The term alternative metal still pops up from time to time, but it’s no more relevant or meaningful today than alternative rock. Instead, it’s a relic. But the brief, nebulous era of alternative metal in the late 80s and early 90s remains a snapshot of a vibrant time when a brash new generation of heavy-leaning bands threw everything against the wall to see what stuck.&quot;

<text>The northern saw-whet owl (Aegolius acadicus) is a species of small owl in the family Strigidae. The species is native to North America. Saw-whet owls of the genus &quot;Aegolius&quot; are some of the smallest owl species in North America. They can be found in dense thickets, often at eye level, although they can also be found some up. Saw-whets are often in danger of being preyed upon by larger birds of prey. The northern saw-whet owl is a migratory bird without any strict pattern.

==Taxonomy==
The northern saw-whet owl was formally described in 1788 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the other owls in the genus &quot;Strix&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Strix acadicus&quot;. Gmelin based his description on the &quot;Acadian owl&quot; from Nova Scotia that had been described and illustrated in 1781 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his multi-volume work &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. The northern saw-whet owl is now one of five species placed in the genus &quot;Aegolius&quot; that was introduced in 1829 by the German naturalist Johann Jakob Kaup. The genus name is Latin for a screech owl, the word came from the Ancient Greek &quot;aigōlios&quot; meaning &quot;a bird of ill omen&quot;. The specific epithet &quot;acadicus&quot; is from &quot;Acadia&quot;, the name of a former French colony in Nova Scotia.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;A. a. acadicus&quot; (Gmelin, JF, 1788) – south Alaska, Canada, north, southwest USA and north Mexico
* &quot;A. a. brooksi&quot; (Fleming, JH, 1916) – Haida Gwaii (formerly the Queen Charlotte Islands) (off British Columbia, Canada)

==Description==
The scientific description of one of the subspecies of this owl is attributed to the Rev. John Henry Keen, a missionary in Canada in 1896. Adults are long with a wingspan. They can weigh from with an average of around , making them one of the smallest owls in North America. They are similar in size to the American robin (78.5 g). Northern saw-whet owls do not exhibit sexual dimorphism in their plumage, so are often sexed by size dimorphism—females are larger than males. Females on average weigh 100 g and males on average weigh 75 g. Northern saw-whet owls have porphyrin pigments in their flight feathers. When exposed to a UV light, feathers on the ventral side of the wing fluoresce a neon pink. This is used in order to estimate molt and age in adults.

The northern saw-whet owl has a round, light, white face with brown and cream streaks; they also have a dark beak and yellow eyes. The underparts are pale with dark shaded areas; the upper parts are brown or reddish with white spots. Juveniles have a dark brown head and wings, and a tawny rust-colored breast and belly. There is also a distinct white, Y-shaped coloration between their eyes. Saw-whet owls can be confused with boreal owls, but are distinguishable by their larger size, bill color, and lack of a spotted forehead. They are quite common, but hard to spot.

There are two subspecies of the northern saw-whet owl: the &quot;Aegolius acadicus&quot; &quot;acadicus&quot; found all around North America and the non-migratory &quot;Aegolius acadicus brooksi&quot; endemic to the Haida Gwaii archipelago in British Columbia.  &quot;A. a. brooksi&quot; is identified by a darker, buffier plumage and has been proposed as a separate species, the Haida Gwaii saw-whet owl. Isolated populations of northern saw-whet owls in the Allegheny Plateau and Southern Appalachian Mountains have been found to be morphologically different to mid-range owls and as genetically distinct as the subspecies &quot;A.a.brooksi&quot; in British Columbia.

===Vocalisation===
The northern saw-whet owl makes a repeated tooting whistle sound. Some say they sound like a saw being sharpened on a whetstone. These calls are usually produced by males searching for mates, so they can be heard more often beginning in January and continuing through the end of the breeding season in early July. Despite being more common in spring, they do vocalize year round. The advertising &quot;too-too-too&quot; call has been heard up to 300 meters away through forest. At least 11 different vocalizations have been reported for the northern saw-whet owl. These include the Advertising call, the Rapid call, Whine, Ksew call, Tssst call, Squeaks, Twittering call (similar to an American Woodcock), Guttural chuck, and begging calls of nestlings. Two additional calls only recorded in &quot;brooksi&quot; include the Transition Call and Alternate Whine. Non-vocal sounds such as bill snapping are used as a warning call by adults, juveniles and nestlings usually when approached up close or when in the hand.

==Distribution and habitat==

The bird&#x27;s habitat is coniferous forests, sometimes mixed or deciduous woods, across North America. Most birds nest in dense coniferous forests near wetlands during the breeding season, but may also breed in mixed-deciduous forests at the southern edge of their range in the eastern United States. Wintering birds prefer conifer stands or shrub thickets near water, but may occasionally be found in mixed-deciduous forest. They are secondary cavity nesters, meaning they do not make their own nest cavities but rather rely on naturally occurring holes or cavities excavated by other animals. Some are permanent residents, while others may migrate south in winter or move down from higher elevations. Their range covers most of North America south of the boreal forest, including southeastern and southcentral Alaska, southern Canada, most of the United States and the central mountains in Mexico. 

Some have begun to move more southeast in Indiana and neighboring states. Buidin &quot;et al.&quot; did a study of how far north the northern saw-whet owls breed and they found that they can breed northward of 50° N, farther than ever recorded before. Their range is quite extensive and they can even breed in the far north where most birds migrate from to breed. They are an adaptive species that can do well in the cold.

There are two semi-isolated permanent populations in the eastern part of the United States. This first is a population along the West Virginia border in the Allegheny Plateau. The second population is in the higher elevations (&gt;4000 ft) of the southern Appalachian Mountains of western North Carolina, eastern Tennessee, and southwestern Virginia. Although there are abundant populations in the Northern and Western Regions of North America, in some counties of North Carolina, it is currently listed as a threatened species due to a decline in suitable habitat. This is due to loss of boreal forests from hemlock woolly adelgid, logging, and pollution.

==Behavior and ecology==
===Breeding===

Northern saw-whet owls lay about four or six white-colored eggs in natural tree cavities or woodpecker holes. Males will often sing from a nest site and cache food in nest sites in order to attract a female. The father does the hunting while the mother watches and sits on her eggs. Females can have more than one clutch of eggs each breeding season with different males. Once the offspring in the first nest have developed their feathers the mother will leave the father to care for them and go find another male to reproduce with. This type of mating is sequential polyandry. They compete with boreal owls, starlings and squirrels for nest cavities and their nests may be destroyed or the nestlings eaten by those creatures as well as nest predators such as martens and corvids. Saw-whet owls of all ages may be predated by any larger species of hawks or owls, of which there are at least a dozen that overlap in range including &quot;Accipiter&quot; hawks, which share with the saw-whet owls a preference for wooded habitats with dense thickets or brush.

In 2014 nesting northern saw-whet owls were found in breeding nest boxes in the Southern Appalachian mountains. This is the most southeastern known breeding area in the United States.

===Food and feeding===

The northern saw-whet owl has vertically asymmetrical ears and different shapes of the ear openings. Because the sound reaches the ears at a different time and is of different intensity, the northern saw-whet owl can very precisely localize its prey. Such accurate sound localization allows it to hunt in complete darkness by hearing alone. A study by &quot;Beatini et al&quot; showed that the northern saw-whet owl had a possible frequency sensitivity of 0.7 to 8.6 kHz with the best sensitivity ranging from 1.6 to 7.1 kHz. This allows it to hunt in the dark purely by sound. The birds wait on a high perch at night and swoop down on prey. They mainly eat small organisms with a strong focus on small mammals in their diet. Swengel and Swengel (1992) reviewed ten studies that found northern saw-whet owls eating almost exclusively mammals (88% to 100%), with most of the mammals being rodents (85% to 99+%). Specifically in their Wisconsin study, the Swengels counted saw-whet owls as most often eating deer mice (&quot;Peromyscus&quot;; ~68% of captured prey), voles (&quot;Microtis pennsylvunicus&quot; and &quot;M. ochrogaster&quot;; ~16%), and shrews (~9%; &quot;Blarina brevicauda&quot; and &quot;Sorex cinereus&quot;). A similar study by Holt and Leroux (1996) in Montana found saw-whet owls eating more voles (60%) than other mammal species. Engel et al. (2015) also found in the saw-whet owl a strong preference for small mammals (89%), with 55% of prey being two species of voles.

Holt and Leroux compared the eating habits of northern saw-whet owls to northern pygmy owls and found that they prey on different animals for their main food source, with the saw-whet owl&#x27;s diet 98% small mammals, while for pygmy owls over one-third of their prey was birds. Their study concluded that these owls could adapt depending on the prey and also with the other predators in the areas where they live. Engel et al. (2015) in Chain O&#x27;Lakes State Park, Illinois, during the winter of 1987–88, compared northern saw-whet owls to long-eared owls. Engel confirmed the saw-whet owl&#x27;s strong preference for small mammals. Their diet appeared varied in the winter, and was less tied to one mammal than was the long-eared owl; at times, northern saw-whet owls hunted larger prey, such as the meadow vole (&quot;M. pennsylvanicus&quot;).

Other mammals preyed on occasionally include shrews, squirrels (largely chipmunks and red squirrels), various other mice species, flying squirrels, moles and bats. Also supplementing the diet are small birds, with passerines such as swallows, sparrows, kinglets and chickadees favored. However, larger birds, up to the size of rock dove (which are typically about 4 times as heavy as a saw-whet owl) can even be taken. On the Pacific coast they may also eat crustaceans, frogs and aquatic insects. Like many owls, these birds have excellent hearing and exceptional vision in low light.

==Popular culture==

An adult female northern saw-whet owl was found dehydrated and hungry within the wrapped branches of the Rockefeller Center Christmas Tree during its installation on November 16, 2020. The bird was discovered by workers who transported the spruce from Oneonta, New York to New York City. The feathered stowaway, named Rockefeller (Rocky), endured the three-day road trip and generated much public interest and media coverage. She was taken to a wildlife center for a check-up and nursed to full strength before being released on the grounds of the wildlife center in Saugerties, New York. Rocky gained more fame when Frontier Airlines announced that her image will be featured on the aircraft tails in their fleet.

<text>Michael Tilson Thomas (born December 21, 1944) is an American conductor, pianist, and composer. He is Artistic Director Laureate of the New World Symphony, an American orchestral academy in Miami Beach, Florida, Music Director Laureate of the San Francisco Symphony, and Conductor Laureate of the London Symphony Orchestra. He gave his final performance with the San Francisco Symphony in January 2024 while fighting brain cancer.
He led the Houston Symphony Orchestra and Chorus in Beethoven&#x27;s 9th Symphony on November 14, 2024.

==Biography==

Tilson Thomas was born in Los Angeles, California, to Ted and Roberta Thomas, a Broadway stage manager and a middle school history teacher, respectively. He is the grandson of noted Yiddish theater stars Boris and Bessie Thomashefsky, who performed in the Yiddish Theater District in Manhattan. The family talent goes back to Tilson Thomas&#x27;s great-grandfather, Pincus, an actor and playwright, and before that to a long line of cantors; his father, Theodor Herzl Tomashefsky (Ted Thomas), was also a poet and painter.

He was an only child and musical prodigy. Tilson Thomas studied piano with John Crown and composition and conducting under Ingolf Dahl at the University of Southern California, where he graduated from the USC Thornton School of Music &#x27;67 and MM &#x27;76. As a student of Friedelind Wagner, Tilson Thomas was a Musical Assistant and Assistant Conductor at the Bayreuth Festival.

Tilson Thomas lives in San Francisco with his husband and partner of over 40 years, Joshua Robison. The couple married on November 2, 2014. On August 6, 2021, Tilson Thomas disclosed publicly for the first time that he had been diagnosed with an aggressive form of brain cancer, called glioblastoma multiforme.

On January 9, 2022, Tilson Thomas returned to his hometown to conduct—for the first time since his cancer disclosure—the Los Angeles Philharmonic. Despite the small audience at Walt Disney Hall due to more than 43,000 newly-diagnosed cases of COVID-19 in L.A. County, Tilson Thomas was greeted warmly by the appreciative audience. He proceeded to lead an acclaimed concert of works by Gabriel Fauré, Tilson Thomas&#x27; own &quot;Meditations on Rilke&quot;—wistful reflections on life and death as the composer turned 75 in 2019—and to conclude, a stunning performance of Sergei Prokofiev&#x27;s monumental Fifth Symphony.

In February 2025, Tilson Thomas announced that his brain tumor had returned. His final public appearance is planned for April 26, 2025, when he will conduct the San Francisco Symphony in a belated 80th birthday celebration concert.

==Career==

Tilson Thomas has conducted a wide variety of music and is a particular champion of modern American works. He is also renowned for his interpretation of the works of Gustav Mahler; he has recorded all nine Mahler symphonies and other major orchestral works with the San Francisco Symphony. These recordings have been released on the high-resolution audio format Super Audio CD on the San Francisco Symphony&#x27;s own recording label. Tilson Thomas is also known as a premier interpreter of the works of Aaron Copland, Charles Ives, and Steve Reich.

A sampling of Tilson Thomas&#x27;s own compositions include &quot;From the Diary of Anne Frank&quot; (1990), &quot;Shówa/Shoáh&quot; (1995, memorializing the fiftieth anniversary of the bombing of Hiroshima), &quot;Poems of Emily Dickinson&quot; (2002) and &quot;Urban Legend&quot; (2002).

Tilson Thomas has also been devoted to music education. He leads a series of education programs titled &quot;Keeping Score&quot; which offers insight into the lives and works of great composers, and led a series of Young People&#x27;s Concerts with the New York Philharmonic. Tilson Thomas founded the New World Symphony in Miami in 1987. Most recently, Tilson Thomas has led two incarnations of the YouTube Symphony Orchestra, which brings young musicians from around the world together for a week of music making and learning.

Tilson Thomas currently serves as president of the Tomashefsky Project, a $2 million undertaking formed in 2017 that is intended to record and preserve his grandparents&#x27; theatrical achievements, and is on the faculty of the University of Southern California Thornton School of Music.

Due to health concerns, Tilson Thomas announced on March 2, 2022, he would be stepping down as the Artistic Director of the New World Symphony and instead serve as the Artistic Director Laureate.

===Boston, Buffalo, New York, and Los Angeles===

From 1968 to 1994, Tilson Thomas was the Music Director of the Ojai Music Festival seven times. After winning the Koussevitzky Prize at Tanglewood in 1969, Tilson Thomas was named Assistant Conductor of the Boston Symphony Orchestra. That same year, he made his conducting debut with the orchestra, replacing an unwell William Steinberg mid-concert and thereby coming into international recognition at the age of 24. He stayed with the Boston Symphony as Principal Guest Conductor until 1974 and made several recordings with the orchestra for Deutsche Grammophon. He was music director of the Buffalo Philharmonic Orchestra from 1971 to 1979, and recorded for Columbia Records with the orchestra.

Between 1971 and 1977, he also conducted the series of Young People&#x27;s Concerts with the New York Philharmonic as well as the Young Musicians Foundation Debut Orchestra based in Los Angeles. From 1981 to 1985, he was principal guest conductor of the Los Angeles Philharmonic Orchestra. During a 1985 performance of Mahler&#x27;s Eighth Symphony at the Hollywood Bowl, a (police) helicopter flew over the venue, disrupting the concert. Tilson temporarily left the stage.

In 2007, he returned to the Hollywood Bowl leading the Los Angeles Philharmonic again in the Mahler Eighth, announcing jokingly, &quot;Now where were we?&quot;

===New World and London===

In 1987, Tilson Thomas founded the New World Symphony in Miami Beach, Florida, an orchestral academy for gifted young musicians whose stated mission is &quot;to prepare highly-gifted graduates of distinguished music programs for leadership roles in orchestras and ensembles around the world.&quot; He played an instrumental role in the development of the Frank Gehry-designed New World Center in Miami Beach, which opened in 2011, and currently maintains a relationship with the organization as Artistic Director Laureate. (The two had personal history, with Gehry sometimes having baby-sat for Tilson Thomas back when both were growing up in Los Angeles.) In March 2022, Tilson Thomas announced that he is to stand down as Artistic Director of the New World Symphony as of June 1, 2022.

From 1988 to 1995, Tilson Thomas was principal conductor of the London Symphony Orchestra (LSO), and recorded with them for such labels as Columbia (now Sony Classical), including the Symphony No. 3 of Mahler. From 1995, he held the title of principal guest conductor with the LSO, and became conductor laureate in 2016.

===San Francisco===

Tilson Thomas became the San Francisco Symphony&#x27;s 11th Music Director in 1995. He originally made his debut with the orchestra in January 1974 conducting Mahler&#x27;s Symphony No. 9. During his first season with the San Francisco Symphony, Tilson Thomas included a work by an American composer on nearly every one of his programs, including the first performances ever by the orchestra of music by Lou Harrison, and culminated with &quot;An American Festival,&quot; a two-week focus on American music.

In June 2000, Tilson Thomas and the San Francisco Symphony presented a landmark 12-concert American Mavericks Festival, recognizing the innovative works of 20th century American composers. Additional season-ending festivals in Davies Symphony Hall have included explorations of the music of Wagner, Prokofiev, Mahler, Stravinsky, Beethoven and Weill, including semi-staged productions of Rimsky-Korsakov&#x27;s opera-ballet &quot;Mlada&quot;, Beethoven&#x27;s &quot;Fidelio&quot;, and Wagner&#x27;s &quot;The Flying Dutchman&quot;.

During his tenure, the orchestra began to issue recordings on its own SFS Media label.

In April 2005, he conducted the Carnegie Hall premiere of &quot;The Thomashefskys: Music and Memories of a Life in the Yiddish Theater,&quot; partly as a tribute to his own grandparents. Other American orchestras have since performed this production, including the Chicago Symphony Orchestra, Los Angeles Philharmonic, Boston Symphony Orchestra, Philadelphia Orchestra, New York Philharmonic, New World Symphony and San Francisco Symphony. It has also been recorded for future broadcast on PBS.

Tilson Thomas collaborated with YouTube in 2009 to help create the YouTube Symphony Orchestra, an orchestra whose members were selected from 30 countries based on more than 3,000 video auditions on YouTube. The Orchestra, as well as such soloists as Mason Bates, Measha Brueggergosman, Joshua Roman, Gil Shaham, Yuja Wang, and Jess Larsen, and participated in a classical music summit in New York City at the Juilliard School over three days. The event culminated in a live concert at Carnegie Hall on Wednesday, April 15. The concert was later made available on YouTube. On March 20, 2011, Tilson Thomas also conducted the &quot;YTSO2&quot; (YouTube Symphony Orchestra 2) in Sydney.

In October 2017, the orchestra announced that Tilson Thomas would conclude his tenure as its music director at the close of the 2019–2020 season, and subsequently take the title of music director laureate.

==Film and television==

His first television appearances were in the Young People&#x27;s Concerts with the New York Philharmonic, airing from 1971 to 1977. He has also made regular appearances on PBS, with broadcasts featuring Tilson Thomas airing from 1972 through 2008. Eight episodes of WNET&#x27;s &quot;Great Performances&quot; series have featured Tilson Thomas. He has also been featured on Japan&#x27;s NHK and the BBC many times in the last three decades.

In 1976, Tilson Thomas appeared alongside Bugs Bunny and Daffy Duck in a prime-time special, &quot;Bugs and Daffy&#x27;s Carnival of the Animals&quot;, a combined live action/animated broadcast of &quot;The Carnival of the Animals&quot; by Saint-Saëns.

In 2011, he hosted a concert stage show celebrating his grandparents and the music of American Yiddish theatre &quot;The Thomashefskys: Music and Memories of a Life in the Yiddish Theater&quot;, which aired in 2012 on the PBS series &quot;Great Performances.&quot;
Tilson Thomas hosted the &quot;Keeping Score&quot; television series, nine one-hour documentary-style episodes and eight live-concert programs, which began airing nationally on PBS stations in early November 2006. He and the San Francisco Symphony have examined the lives and music of Gustav Mahler, Dmitri Shostakovich, Charles Ives, Hector Berlioz, Aaron Copland, Igor Stravinsky, Peter Ilyich Tchaikovsky, and Ludwig van Beethoven.

<text>Microsoft Comic Chat (later Microsoft Chat) is a graphical IRC client created by Microsoft, first released with Internet Explorer 3.0 in 1996. Comic Chat was developed by Microsoft Researcher David Kurlander, with Microsoft Research&#x27;s Virtual Worlds Group and later a group he managed in Microsoft&#x27;s Internet Division.

==Overview==
Comic Chat&#x27;s main feature, which set it apart from other IRC clients, is that it enabled comic avatars to represent a user; this character could express a specified emotion, possibly making IRC chatting a more emotive and expressive experience. All of the comic characters and backgrounds were initially created by comic artist Jim Woodring. Later, tools became available that allowed user-created characters and backgrounds.

Comic Chat started out as a research project, and a paper describing the technology was published at SIGGRAPH &#x27;96. It was an experiment in automatic illustration construction and layout. The algorithms used in Comic Chat attempted to mimic some basic illustration techniques of comic artists (particularly Jim Woodring). Character placement, the choice of gestures and expressions, and word balloon construction and layout, were all chosen automatically. A widget called the &quot;emotion wheel&quot; allowed users to override the program&#x27;s choice of expression.

Although Comic Chat could be used in text-based chat rooms as well, it added a code at the beginning of every message to communicate the character&#x27;s expression to other chat clients. This had a somewhat annoying effect on non-Comic Chat users (although it could be disabled).

Comic Chat was released with the full downloads of Internet Explorer 3, 4, and 5, as well as in the Windows 98 and Windows 2000 distributions. It also became the official chat client of MSN. It was localized into 24 different languages. Although the program can still be downloaded and still works with most IRC servers, it is infrequently used today because MSN decided to get out of the chat business, and turned off its servers.

In December 1996, The Microsoft Network introduced a show-based format, in which high quality multimedia content was produced around several themes. MSN&#x27;s MotorWeb was built around an automobile theme. MSN entered into a partnership with NPR’s CarTalk, and each day featured a new online Car Talk caller from the popular NPR radio duo of &quot;Click and Clack&quot; (Tom and Ray Magliozzi).

Created and produced at MSN by Mike Klozar, the &quot;Chat Show,&quot; as it was called, was an innovative combination of on-demand streaming audio, text (as cartoon bubbles) and comic strip characters all synchronized to display an animated cartoon comic strip created dynamically from the text input. An example of the show can be found at David Kurlander&#x27;s project site, under [MSN CarTalk Comic Chat Show].

Each episode depicted a caller (as a black and white default character) and color caricatures of Tom &amp; Ray interacting in a unique closed visual chat. The visuals were generated dynamically by the Comic Chat client (already residing on the PC), given a timed, textual transcript of the show. This allowed an online comic strip to draw in exact timing with the audio/dialogue that was streamed via Real Audio (14.4 modems were the norm at this time). The show ran for one year. MSN moved away from the &quot;show&quot; format the following year, and CarTalk signed a contract with Cars.com. The online chat show ended at that time.

Microsoft Comic Chat installed a custom font, Comic Sans MS, that users could use in other applications and documents. In 1996 it was bundled with several other fonts in Microsoft&#x27;s Core Fonts for the Web project and subsequent versions of Microsoft Windows, leading to its notoriety among the digerati.

It was renamed as &quot;Microsoft Chat 2.0&quot;, and was bundled with Internet Explorer along with the then new Outlook Express, in the late 1990s. Version 2.5 bundled with Internet Explorer 5 was the last update.

Microsoft Comic Chat was removed with Internet Explorer 6.

<doc id="360125" wikidata="Q504369" url="?curid=360125" title="Henry Halleck">
<text>Henry Wager Halleck (January 16, 1815 – January 9, 1872) was a senior United States Army officer, scholar, and lawyer. A noted expert in military studies, he was known by a nickname that became derogatory: &quot;Old Brains&quot;. He was an important participant in the admission of California as a state and became a successful lawyer and land developer. Halleck served as the General-in-Chief of the Armies of the United States from 1862 to 1864, and then became Chief of Staff for the remainder of the war when Ulysses S. Grant was appointed to that position.

Early in the American Civil War, Halleck was a senior Union Army commander in the Western Theater. He commanded operations in the West from 1861 until 1862, during which time, while the Union armies in the East were repeatedly defeated and held back, the troops under Halleck&#x27;s command won many important victories. However, Halleck was not present at those battles, and his subordinates earned most of the recognition. The only operation in which Halleck exercised field command was the so-called siege of Corinth in the spring of 1862, a Union victory which he conducted with unnecessary caution, which allowed the Confederate force to escape. Halleck also developed rivalries with several of his subordinate generals, such as Grant and Don Carlos Buell. In July 1862, following Major General George B. McClellan&#x27;s failed Peninsula Campaign in the Eastern Theater, Halleck was promoted to general-in-chief. Halleck served in this capacity for about a year and a half.

Halleck was a cautious general who believed strongly in thorough preparations for battle and in the value of defensive fortifications over quick, aggressive action. He was a master of administration, logistics, and the politics necessary at the top of the military hierarchy, but exerted little effective control over field operations from his post in Washington, D.C. As general-in-chief he refused to give orders to his subordinate commanders, instead offering advice, but leaving the final decisions up to the generals in the field. As a result, his subordinates frequently criticized him and often ignored his instructions. Still, Halleck&#x27;s earlier contributions to military theory are credited with encouraging a new spirit of professionalism in the army.

In March 1864, Grant was promoted to general-in-chief, locating his headquarters with the Army of the Potomac in the field, while Halleck was relegated to serving as chief of staff in Washington, providing the necessary administrative support to fulfill Grant&#x27;s orders to the various armies. Without the pressure of having to control the movements of the armies, Halleck performed capably in this task, ensuring that the Union armies were as well-equipped and supplied as possible.

==Early life==
Halleck was born on a farm in Westernville, Oneida County, New York, the third child of 14 of Joseph Halleck, a lieutenant who served in the War of 1812, and Catherine Wager Halleck. Young Henry detested the thought of an agricultural life and ran away from home at an early age to be raised by an uncle, David Wager of Utica. He attended Hudson Academy, Union College in Schenectady, New York, then the United States Military Academy. He became a favorite of military theorist Dennis Hart Mahan and was allowed to teach classes while still a cadet. He graduated in 1839, third in his class of 31 cadets, as a second lieutenant of engineers. After spending some time as a member of the teaching staff at the academy, and a few years improving the defenses of New York Harbor, he wrote a report for the United States Senate on seacoast defenses, &quot;Report on the Means of National Defence&quot;, which pleased General-in-Chief Winfield Scott, who rewarded Halleck with a trip to Europe in 1844 to study European fortifications and the French military. Returning home as a first lieutenant, Halleck gave a series of twelve lectures at the Lowell Institute in Boston that were subsequently published in 1846 as &quot;Elements of Military Art and Science&quot;. His work, one of the first expressions of American military professionalism, was well received by his colleagues and was considered one of the definitive tactical treatises used by officers in the coming Civil War. His scholarly pursuits earned him the later derogatory nickname &quot;Old Brains&quot;.

During the Mexican–American War, Halleck was assigned to duty in California. During his seven-month journey on the transport USS &quot;Lexington&quot; around Cape Horn, assigned as aide-de-camp to Commodore William Shubrick, he translated Henri Jomini&#x27;s &quot;Vie politique et militaire de Napoleon&quot; (&quot;Political and Military Life of Napoleon&quot;), which further enhanced his reputation for scholarship. He spent several months in California constructing fortifications, then was first exposed to combat on November 11, 1847, during William Shubrick&#x27;s capture of the port of Mazatlán; Lt. Halleck served as lieutenant governor of the occupied city. He was awarded a brevet promotion to captain in 1847 for his &quot;gallant and meritorious service&quot; in California and Mexico, and would later be appointed captain in the regular army on July 1, 1853. He was transferred north to serve under General Bennet Riley, the governor general of the California Territory. Halleck was soon appointed military secretary of state, a position which made him the governor&#x27;s representative at the 1849 convention in Monterey where the California state constitution was written. Halleck became one of the principal authors of the document. The California State Military Museum writes that Halleck &quot;was [at the convention] and in a lone measure its brains because he had given more studious thought to the subject than any other, and General Riley had instructed him to help frame the new constitution.&quot; He was nominated during the convention to be one of two men to represent the new state in the United States Senate, but received only enough votes for third place. During his political activities, he found time to join a law firm in San Francisco, Halleck, Peachy &amp; Billings, which became so successful that he resigned his commission in 1854. The following year, he married Elizabeth Hamilton, granddaughter of Alexander Hamilton and sister of Union general Schuyler Hamilton. Their only child, Henry Wager Halleck Jr., was born in 1856, and died in 1882.

Halleck became a wealthy man as a lawyer and land speculator, and a noted collector of &quot;Californiana&quot;. He obtained thousands of pages of official documents on the Spanish missions and colonization of California, which were copied and are now maintained by the Bancroft Library of the University of California, the originals having been destroyed in the 1906 San Francisco earthquake and fire. He built the Montgomery Block, San Francisco&#x27;s first fireproof building, home to lawyers, businessmen, and later, the city&#x27;s Bohemian writers and newspapers. He was a director of the Almaden Quicksilver (Mercury) Company in San Jose, president of the Atlantic and Pacific Railroad, a builder in Monterey, and owner of the 30,000 acre (120 km2) Rancho Nicasio in Marin County. But he remained involved in military affairs and by early 1861 he was a major general of the California Militia.

==Civil War==

===Western Theater===
As the Civil War began, Halleck was nominally a Democrat and was sympathetic to the South, but he had a strong belief in the value of the Union. His reputation as a military scholar and an urgent recommendation from Winfield Scott earned him the rank of major general in the regular army, effective August 19, 1861, making him the fourth most senior general, after Scott, George B. McClellan, and John C. Frémont. He was assigned to command the Department of the Missouri, replacing Frémont in St. Louis on November 9, and his talent for administration quickly sorted out the chaos of fraud and disorder left by his predecessor. He set to work on the &quot;twin goals of expanding his command and making sure that no blame of any sort fell on him.&quot;

Halleck established an uncomfortable relationship with the man who would become his most successful subordinate and future commander, Brig. Gen. Ulysses S. Grant. The pugnacious Grant had just been repulsed at the minor, but bloody, Battle of Belmont but had ambitious plans for amphibious operations on the Tennessee and Cumberland Rivers. Halleck, by nature a cautious general, but also judging that Grant&#x27;s reputation for alcoholism in the prewar period made him unreliable, twice rejected Grant&#x27;s plans. However, under pressure from President Lincoln to take offensive action, Halleck reconsidered and Grant conducted operations with naval and land forces against Forts Henry and Donelson in February 1862, capturing both, along with 14,000 Confederates.

Grant had delivered the first major Union victory of the war. Halleck obtained a promotion for him to major general of volunteers, along with some other generals in his department, and used the victory as an opportunity to request overall command in the Western Theater, which he currently shared with Maj. Gen. Don Carlos Buell, but which was not granted. He briefly relieved Grant of field command of a newly ordered expedition up the Tennessee River after Grant left his district to meet Buell in Nashville, failed to provide returns of his force, and allegedly did not immediately stop looting at the two captured forts. It was later determined that the requests from Halleck about Grant&#x27;s force never made it to Grant. Halleck also cited rumors of renewed alcoholism, but then restored Grant to field command – pressure by Lincoln and the War Department may have been a factor in this about-face. Explaining the reinstatement to Grant, Halleck portrayed it as his effort to correct an injustice, not revealing to Grant that the injustice had originated with him. When Grant wrote to Halleck suggesting &quot;I must have enemies between you and myself,&quot; Halleck replied, &quot;You are mistaken. There is no enemy between you and me.&quot;

Halleck&#x27;s department performed well in early 1862, driving the Confederates from the state of Missouri and advancing into Arkansas. They held all of West Tennessee and half of Middle Tennessee. Grant, not yet aware of the political maneuvering behind his back, regarded Halleck as &quot;one of the greatest men of the age&quot; and Maj. Gen. William T. Sherman described him as the &quot;directing genius&quot; of the events that had given the Union cause such a &quot;tremendous lift&quot; in the previous months. This performance can be attributed to Halleck&#x27;s strategy, administrative skills, and his good management of resources, and to the excellent execution by his subordinates – Grant, Maj. Gen. Samuel R. Curtis at Pea Ridge, and Maj. Gen. John Pope at Island Number 10. Military historians disagree about Halleck&#x27;s personal role in providing these victories. Some offer him the credit based on his overall command of the department; others, particularly those viewing his career through the lens of later events, believe that his subordinates were the primary factor.

On March 11, 1862, Halleck&#x27;s command was enlarged to include Ohio and Kansas, along with Buell&#x27;s Army of the Ohio, and was renamed the Department of the Mississippi. On April 6, Grant&#x27;s Army of the Tennessee at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee, was the victim of a surprise attack due to his negligence, but both sides suffered heavy casualties in the ensuing Battle of Shiloh. With the arrival of the bulk of the Army of the Ohio, Grant and Buell managed to repulse the Confederate Army on April 7. General P.G.T. Beauregard had taken command of the Confederates after General Albert Sidney Johnston died on the first day. Pursuant to his earlier plan, Halleck arrived to take personal command of the massive army in the field for the first time. Grant was under public attack over the slaughter at Shiloh, and Halleck replaced Grant as a wing commander and assigned him instead to serve as second-in-command of the entire 100,000 man force, a job with virtually no responsibilities, which Grant complained was a censure and allegedly akin to an arrest. Halleck, disliking the volunteer generals who ranked just behind Grant, covered up the surprise attack for Grant&#x27;s sake. Halleck proceeded to conduct operations against Beauregard&#x27;s army in Corinth, Mississippi, called the siege of Corinth because Halleck&#x27;s army, twice the size of Beauregard&#x27;s, moved so cautiously and stopped daily to erect elaborate field fortifications. The army waited so long to begin and their movement was so slow that by the time they reached the city, Beauregard had already abandoned Corinth without a fight, deceiving Halleck into thinking that Confederate reinforcements were arriving by train, when, in fact, the trains were taking away the Rebel army&#x27;s materiel.

===General-in-Chief===
In the aftermath of the failed Peninsula Campaign in Virginia, President Lincoln summoned Halleck to the East to become General-in-Chief of the Armies of the United States, as of July 23, 1862. Lincoln hoped that Halleck could prod his subordinate generals into taking more coordinated, aggressive actions across all of the theaters of war, but he was quickly disappointed, and was quoted as regarding him as &quot;little more than a first rate clerk.&quot; Grant replaced Halleck in command of most forces in the West, but Buell&#x27;s Army of the Ohio was separated and Buell reported directly to Halleck, as a peer of Grant. Halleck began transferring divisions from Grant to Buell; by September, four divisions had moved, leaving Grant with 46,000 men.

In Washington, Halleck continued to excel at administrative issues and facilitated the training, equipping, and deployment of thousands of Union soldiers over vast areas. He was unsuccessful, however, as a commander of the field armies or as a grand strategist. His cold, abrasive personality alienated his subordinates; one observer described him as a &quot;cold, calculating owl.&quot; Historian Steven E. Woodworth wrote, &quot;Beneath the ponderous dome of his high forehead, the General would gaze goggle-eyed at those who spoke to him, reflecting long before answering and simultaneously rubbing both elbows all the while, leading one observer to quip that &quot;the great intelligence he was reputed to possess must be located in his elbows.&quot; This disposition also made him unpopular with the Union press corps, who criticized him frequently.

Halleck, more a bureaucrat than a combat soldier, was able to impose little discipline or direction on his field commanders. Strong personalities such as George B. McClellan, John Pope, and Ambrose Burnside routinely ignored his advice and instructions. A telling example of his lack of control was during the Northern Virginia Campaign of 1862, when Halleck was unable to motivate McClellan to reinforce Pope in a timely manner, contributing to the Union defeat at the Second Battle of Bull Run. It was from this incident that Halleck fell from grace. Abraham Lincoln said that he had given Halleck full power and responsibility as general-in-chief. &quot;He ran it on that basis till Pope&#x27;s defeat; but ever since that event he has shrunk from responsibility whenever it was possible.&quot;

In Halleck&#x27;s defense, his subordinate commanders in the Eastern Theater, whom he did not select, were reluctant to move against General Robert E. Lee and the Army of Northern Virginia. Many of his generals in the West, other than Grant, also lacked aggressiveness. And despite Lincoln&#x27;s pledge to give the general in chief full control, both he and Secretary of War Edwin M. Stanton micromanaged many aspects of the military strategy of the nation. Halleck wrote to Sherman in February 1864, &quot;I am simply a military advisor of the Secretary of War and the President, and must obey and carry out what they decide upon, whether I concur in their decisions or not. As a good soldier I obey the orders of my superiors. If I disagree with them I say so, but when they decide, it is my duty faithfully to carry out their decision.&quot; However, biographer John F. Marszalek points out that this role was one that Halleck had crafted for himself by his failure to take responsibility and issue orders to his subordinates. Lincoln and Stanton had brought Halleck to Washington to command the Union armies and get results such as he had in the West, but Halleck drew back from the task.

That Lincoln and Stanton were serious in their willingness to cede control to Halleck – after removing McClellan as general-in-chief, the two has performed that role between themselves – can be seen by their behavior with Grant when he came East to take the same role. Although they offered advice and broad strategic goals, they left Grant alone, and Grant took the challenge in a way that Halleck never did.

===Chief of staff===
On March 12, 1864, after Ulysses S. Grant, Halleck&#x27;s former subordinate in the West, was promoted to lieutenant general and general-in-chief, Halleck was relegated to chief of staff, responsible for the administration of the vast U.S. armies. Grant and the War Department took special care to let Halleck down gently. Their orders stated that Halleck had been relieved as general-in-chief &quot;at his own request.&quot;

Now that there was an aggressive general in the field, Halleck&#x27;s administrative capabilities complemented Grant&#x27;s field operations and they worked well together. Throughout the arduous Overland Campaign and Richmond-Petersburg Campaign of 1864, Halleck saw to it that Grant was properly supplied, equipped, and reinforced on a scale that wore down the Confederates. Grant had also transferred responsibility to Halleck for oversight of operations outside of Virginia during this campaign. Halleck agreed with Grant and Sherman on the implementation of a hard war toward the Southern economy and endorsed both Sherman&#x27;s March to the Sea and Maj. Gen. Philip Sheridan&#x27;s destruction of the Shenandoah Valley. However, the 1864 Red River Campaign, a doomed attempt to occupy Eastern Texas, had been advocated by Halleck, over the objections of Grant and Nathaniel P. Banks, who commanded the operation. When the campaign failed, Halleck claimed to Grant that it had been Banks&#x27; idea in the first place, not his – an example of Halleck&#x27;s habit of deflecting blame.

===Richmond===
Following the assassination of Abraham Lincoln, Secretary of War Edward M. Stanton took it upon himself to reassign Halleck to head the Army&#x27;s department in the defeated Confederate capital, Richmond; by doing so Halleck lost his position as chief-of-staff.

In April 1865, after Sherman exceeded his authority and offered absurdly generous surrender terms to Joseph E. Johnston – Sherman apparently believed that he was following Lincoln&#x27;s desires as expressed at a meeting at City Point, Virginia – it was very badly received in official Washington. Newspapers and officials – including Stanton – began to talk about Sherman possibly being a traitor. Probably to ingratiate himself with Stanton, Halleck took up this position, and instructed other generals to ignore orders coming from Sherman. This enraged Sherman, resulting in a vituperative exchange of letters in which Halleck attempted to explain away his behavior. This caused a rift between Halleck and Sherman, who, up until this time, had publicly and privately lauded Halleck, ever since Sherman had a mental breakdown while he was in charge of the Department of Kentucky, and was transferred into Halleck&#x27;s department, where he was given the chance to work his way back into being of service to the country.

The rift between the two generals was so strong that when Sherman&#x27;s army marched from North Carolina to Washington to take part in the final grand review of the Union armies and passed through Richmond, where Halleck was in command, Halleck ordered one of Sherman&#x27;s corps to pass him in review, an order that an insubordinate Sherman countermanded. Sherman ordered his troops to pass through Richmond &quot;with colors flying and drums beating as a matter of right and not by H&#x27;s leave.&quot; No salute of any kind was offered to Halleck as the troops passed by his house, even though Halleck was standing on the porch.

Halleck, realizing that losing Sherman&#x27;s friendship was more important to him than gaining Stanton&#x27;s regard, wrote a letter to Sherman in which he completely humbled himself, but Sherman remained incensed, in particular at Halleck&#x27;s telling Sherman&#x27;s subordinates not to follow his orders. He rejected Halleck entreaties, and the two men remained estranged. Still, when Sherman wrote his memoirs in the 1880s he praised Halleck to the extent he thought was deserved.

===Evaluation by others===
General George B. McClellan, who, when he was General-in-Chief, appointed Halleck to replace Frémont in the West, said of Halleck:

Of all the men who I have encountered in high position, Halleck was the most helplessly stupid. It was more difficult to get an idea through his head than can be conceived by anyone who never made the attempt. I do not think he ever had a correct military idea from beginning to end.

McClellan told his wife that although Halleck had some good qualities as a soldier, &quot;he does not understand strategy and should never plan a campaign.&quot;

Historian Kendall Gott described Halleck as a department commander:

British general and military historian J. F. C. Fuller described Halleck as &quot;a cautious, witless pedant who had studied war, and imagined that adherence to certain strategical and tactical maxims constituted the height of generalship.&quot; Fuller approvingly quotes W. E. Woodward&#x27;s description of Halleck as &quot;a large emptiness surrounded by an education.&quot; Fuller also opines that Halleck, after the Siege of Corinth, when he was in direct command of an army of 115,000 men, could have, and should have, crushed P. G. T. Beauregard&#x27;s army, taken Vicksburg, and occupied Chattanooga, being then in a position to threaten Richmond via the Allegheny Mountains. Instead, by taking so long to move from Pittsburg Landing to Corinth, Halleck allowed the Confederates to escape, then chose to break up his army into small pieces and spread them around the Western theatre. Therefore, according to Fuller, Halleck&#x27;s being called to Washington by Lincoln to be General-in-Chief was a blessing to the North, because it eliminated from the field a sub-standard general (Halleck) and left Grant free to develop his strategic thinking, and, by taking Vicksburg and opening the Mississippi River, to deal the Confederacy a blow from which it never recovered.

However helpful it was to the Union for Grant to be free of Halleck&#x27;s supervision in the West, in Washington, D.C. Halleck did not perform well in his role as General-in-Chief. President Abraham Lincoln, growing tired of Halleck&#x27;s inability to control the Union&#x27;s generals and make them obey Lincoln&#x27;s wishes, once described him as &quot;little more than a first rate clerk.&quot; Lincoln&#x27;s Secretary of the Navy, Gideon Welles, who kept a diary throughout the war, said of him &quot;Halleck originates nothing, anticipates nothing to assist others; takes no responsibility, plans nothing, suggests nothing, is good for nothing.&quot; Welles later commented that although Halleck was intelligent and educated, he was &quot;a moral coward, worth but little except as a critic and director of operations...&quot; When Jubal Early&#x27;s army was threatening Washington from the Shenandoah Valley and the city was panicking, Welles described Halleck as contributing to the chaos. He was &quot;in a perfect maze, bewildered, without intelligent decision or self-reliance.&quot; Count Adam Gurowski, a Radical Republican Polish émigré who was a minor State Department official, as well as a member of the editorial staff of the &quot;New York Tribune&quot;, agreed, saying &quot;All the incapacity, all the blunderings are exclusively Halleck&#x27;s work ... History has not on record military conduct so below any honor or manhood as that of Halleck...&quot;

Secretary of the Treasury Salmon P. Chase, who had begun by being a supporter of Halleck, said during the Siege of Chattanooga that Halleck was &quot;good for nothing, and everybody knew it but the President.&quot;

Historian John F. Marszalek, the author of the only complete biography of Halleck – Stephen E. Ambrose&#x27;s &quot;&quot; is an expansion of his dissertation – writes:

Halleck saw himself as a subordinate, not a decision maker, a follower, not a leader. This was a deeply felt sentiment, long present in his character, but made conspicuous under the stress of war. ... Halleck&#x27;s personality and his performance as a Civil War general were largely the result of deeply ingrained psychological factors and the physical ailments that developed as a result. [His] drive to succeed, his many accomplishments, and his eventual failure to reach his potential all stemmed from deeply embedded conscious and unconscious forces. The powerful man of success was also the tormented child, and, under the stress of war, the torment won out over the power. Indecision became his surrender to, his way of coping with, the turmoil he felt all his life.

==Postwar career==
After Grant forced Lee&#x27;s surrender at Appomattox Court House, Halleck was assigned to command the Military Division of the James, headquartered at Richmond. Prior to that, he was present at Lincoln&#x27;s death and was a pall-bearer and representative of the military at Lincoln&#x27;s funeral. In August 1865 he was transferred to the Division of the Pacific in California, essentially in military exile. While holding this command he accompanied photographer Eadweard Muybridge to the newly purchased Russian America (Alaska). He and Senator Charles Sumner are credited with applying the name &quot;Alaska&quot; to that region. In March 1869, he was assigned to command the Military Division of the South, headquartered in Louisville, Kentucky.

== Death ==
Halleck became ill in January 1872 and his condition was diagnosed as edema caused by liver disease. He died at his post in Louisville on January 9, just 7 days short of his 57th birthday. He was buried in the family plot in Green-Wood Cemetery, in Brooklyn, New York, on January 25.

Halleck is commemorated by a street named for him in San Francisco and a statue in Golden Gate Park. He left no memoirs for posterity and apparently destroyed his private correspondence and memoranda. His estate at his death showed a net value of $474,773.16 ($ in 2024 dollars). His widow, Elizabeth, married Halleck&#x27;s best friend, Col. George Washington Cullum in 1875. Cullum had served as Halleck&#x27;s chief of staff in the Western Theater and then on his staff in Washington.

==Family==
David Wager was Halleck&#x27;s uncle. Henry Benjamin Whipple was his first cousin, and Charles H. Whipple was his first cousin once removed.

<text>During the American Civil War, the United States Army, the land force that fought to preserve the collective Union of the states, was often referred to as the Union army, the federal army, or the northern army. It proved essential to the restoration and preservation of the United States as a working, viable republic.

The Union Army was made up of the permanent regular army of the United States, but further fortified, augmented, and strengthened by the many temporary units of dedicated volunteers, as well as including those who were drafted in to service as conscripts. To this end, the Union army fought and ultimately triumphed over the efforts of the Confederate States Army.

Over the course of the war, 2,128,948 men enlisted in the Union Army, including 178,895, or about 8.4% being colored troops; 25% of the white men who served were immigrants, and a further 18% were second-generation Americans. 596,670 Union soldiers were killed, wounded or went missing during the war. The initial call-up in 1861 was for just three months, after which many of these men chose to reenlist for an additional three years.

==Formation==
When the American Civil War began in April 1861, the U.S. Army included ten regiments of infantry, four of artillery, two of cavalry, two of dragoons, and one of mounted rifles. The regiments were scattered widely. Of the 197 companies in the U.S. Army, 179 occupied 79 isolated posts in the West, and the remaining 18 manned garrisons east of the Mississippi River, mostly along the Canada–United States border and on the U.S. East Coast. There were only 16,367 servicemen in the U.S. Army, including 1,108 commissioned officers. Approximately 20% of these officers, most of them Southerners, resigned, choosing to tie their lives and fortunes to the Confederate army.

Almost 200 United States Military Academy graduates who previously left the U.S. Army, including Ulysses S. Grant, William Tecumseh Sherman, and Braxton Bragg, returned to service at the outbreak of the Civil War. This group&#x27;s loyalties were far more evenly divided. Clayton R. Newell (2014) states, 92 wore Confederate gray and 102 put on the blue of the United States Army. Hattaway and Jones (1983), John and David Eicher (2001), and Jennifer M. Murray (2012), state that 99 joined the Confederate army and 114 returned to the Union forces.

With the Southern slave states declaring secession from the United States, and with a shortage of soldiers in the army, President Abraham Lincoln called on the states to raise a force of 75,000 troops for three months to put down the Confederate insurrection and defend the national capital in Washington, D.C. 

Lincoln&#x27;s call forced the border states to choose sides, and four seceded, making the Confederacy eleven states strong. It turned out that the war itself proved to be much longer and far more extensive in scope and scale than anyone on either side, Union North or Confederate South, expected or even imagined at the outset on the date of July 22, 1861. That was the day that Congress initially approved and authorized subsidy to allow and support a volunteer army of up to 500,000 troops to the cause.

The call for volunteers initially was easily met by patriotic Northerners, abolitionists, and even immigrants who enlisted for a steady income and meals. Over 10,000 German Americans in New York and Pennsylvania immediately responded to Lincoln&#x27;s call, along with Northern French Americans, who were also quick to volunteer. As more men were needed, however, the number of volunteers fell and both money bounties and forced conscription had to be turned to. Many Southern Unionists would also fight for the Union army. An estimated 100,000 white soldiers from states within the Confederacy served in Union army units. Between April 1861 and April 1865, at least 2,128,948 men served in the United States Army, of whom the majority were volunteers.

It is a misconception that the South held an advantage because of the large percentage of professional officers who resigned to join the Confederate army. At the start of the war, there were 824 graduates of the U.S. Military Academy on the active list; of these, 296 resigned or were dismissed, and 184 of those became Confederate officers. Of the approximately 900 West Point graduates who were then civilians, 400 returned to the U.S. Army and 99 to the Confederacy. The ratio of U.S. Army to Confederate professional officers was 642 to 283. One of the resigning officers was Robert E. Lee, who initially was offered the assignment as commander of a field army to suppress the rebellion. Lee disapproved of secession, but refused to bear arms against his native state, Virginia, and resigned to accept the position as commander of the Virginian Confederate forces. Lee eventually became the overall commander of the Confederate army. 

The Confederacy had the advantage of having several military colleges, including The Citadel and Virginia Military Institute, but they produced fewer officers. Though officers were able to resign, enlisted soldiers did not have this right. As they usually had to either desert or wait until their enlistment term was over in order to join the Confederate States Army; though few are believed to have done so, their total number is unknown.

==Organization==

===Leadership===
U.S. President Abraham Lincoln exercised supreme command and control over the army in his capacity as commander-in-chief of the United States Armed Forces. Below him was the Secretary of War, who oversaw the administration of the army, and the general-in-chief, who directed the field operations of the army. 

At the start of the war, Simon Cameron served as Secretary of War before being replaced in January 1862 by Edwin Stanton. The role of general-in-chief was filled by several men during the course of the war:
*Winfield Scott: July 5, 1841November 1, 1861
*George B. McClellan: November 1, 1861March 11, 1862
*Henry W. Halleck: July 23, 1862March 9, 1864
*Ulysses S. Grant: March 9, 1864March 4, 1869

The gap from March 11 to July 23, 1862, was filled with direct control of the army by President Lincoln and Secretary Stanton, with the help of an unofficial &quot;War Board&quot; that was established on March 17, 1862. The board consisted of Ethan A. Hitchcock, the chairman, with Department of War bureau chiefs Lorenzo Thomas (Adjutant General), Montgomery C. Meigs (Quartermaster General), Joseph G. Totten (Chief of Engineers), James W. Ripley (Chief of Ordnance), and Joseph P. Taylor (Commissary General).

Reporting directly to the Secretary of War were the bureau chiefs or heads of staff departments which made up the Department of War. These included, at the onset of the war, the adjutant general, inspector general, paymaster-general, judge advocate general, chief of engineers, chief of topographical engineers, quartermaster general, commissary general of subsistence, chief of ordnance, and surgeon general.

After the war started, the position of Provost Marshal General was also created. Originally established on September 24, 1862, as an office in the Adjutant General&#x27;s department under Simeon Draper, it was made an independent department in its own right on May 1, 1863, under James B. Fry. The Signal Corps was created and deployed for the first time, through the leadership of Albert J. Myer.

One drawback to this system was that the authority and responsibilities of the Secretary of War, his Assistant Secretaries, and the General-in-Chief were not clearly delineated. Additionally, the efforts of the four &quot;supply&quot; departments (Quartermaster, Subsistence, Ordnance &amp; Medical) were not coordinated with each other, a condition that would last throughout the war. Although the &quot;War Board&quot; could provide military advice and help coordinate military policy, it was not until the appointment of Ulysses Grant as General-in-Chief was there more than the vaguest coordination of military strategy and logistics.

===Major organizations===
The Union army was composed of numerous organizations, which were generally organized geographically.

; Military division
: A collection of Departments reporting to one commander (e.g., Military Division of the Mississippi, Middle Military Division, Military Division of the James). Military Divisions were similar to the more modern term Theater; and were modeled close to, though not synonymous with, the existing theaters of war.
; Department
: An organization that covered a defined region, including responsibilities for the Federal installations therein and for the field armies within their borders. Those named for states usually referred to Southern states that had been occupied. It was more common to name departments for rivers (such as Department of the Tennessee, Department of the Cumberland) or regions (Department of the Pacific, Department of New England, Department of the East, Department of the West, Middle Department).
; District
: A territorial subdivision of a Department (e.g., District of Cairo, District of East Tennessee). There were also Subdistricts for smaller regions.
; Army
: The fighting force that was usually, but not always, assigned to a District or Department but could operate over wider areas. An army could contain between one and eight corps, with an average of three. Some of the most prominent armies were:
:*Army of the Cumberland, the army operating primarily in Tennessee, and later Georgia, commanded by William S. Rosecrans and George Henry Thomas.
:*Army of Georgia, operated in the March to the Sea and the Carolinas commanded by Henry W. Slocum.
:*Army of the Gulf, the army operating in the region bordering the Gulf of Mexico, commanded by Benjamin Butler, Nathaniel P. Banks, and Edward Canby.
:*Army of the James, the army operating on the Virginia Peninsula, 1864–65, commanded by Benjamin Butler and Edward Ord.
:*Army of the Mississippi, a briefly existing army operating on the Mississippi River, in two incarnations—under John Pope and William S. Rosecrans in 1862; under John A. McClernand in 1863.
:*Army of the Ohio, the army operating primarily in Kentucky and later Tennessee and Georgia, commanded by Don Carlos Buell, Ambrose E. Burnside, John G. Foster, and John M. Schofield.
:*Army of the Potomac, the principal army in the Eastern Theater, commanded by George B. McClellan, Ambrose E. Burnside, Joseph Hooker, and George G. Meade.
:*Army of the Shenandoah, the army operating in the Shenandoah Valley, under David Hunter, Philip Sheridan, and Horatio G. Wright.
:*Army of the Tennessee, the most famous army in the Western Theater, operating through Kentucky, Tennessee, Mississippi, Georgia, and the Carolinas; commanded by Ulysses S. Grant, William T. Sherman, James B. McPherson, and Oliver O. Howard.
:*Army of Virginia, the army assembled under John Pope for the Northern Virginia Campaign.

Each of these armies was usually commanded by a major general. Typically, the Department or District commander also had field command of the army of the same name, but some conflicts within the ranks occurred when this was not true, particularly when an army crossed a geographic boundary.

The commanding officer of an army was authorized a number of aides-de-camp as their personal staff and a general staff. The general staff included representatives of the other combat arms, such as a chief of artillery and chief of cavalry (the infantry being typically represented by the commanding officer) and representatives of the staff bureaus and offices. The staff department officers typically assigned to an army or military department included an assistant adjutant general, a chief quartermaster, a chief commissary of subsistence, an assistant inspector general, an ordnance officer (all with the rank of colonel) and a medical director. The actual number of personnel assigned to an army&#x27;s headquarters could be quite large: at Gettysburg the headquarters of General Meade (excluding engineers, the artillery reserve and the headquarters of each corps) was no less than 3,486 strong.

===Tactical organizations===
The military organization of the United States Army was based on the traditions developed in Europe, with the regiment being the basis of recruitment, training and maneuvering. However, for a variety of reasons there could be vast differences in the number of actual soldiers organized even into units of the same type. Changes in how units were structured during the course of the war, contrasts in organizational principals between regular and volunteer units, and even simple misnaming all played a role. Thus for example, comparing two infantry regiments at their full authorized strength one might have twice as many soldiers as the other. Furthermore, even when units were of equivalent size, their actual effectiveness depended greatly on training, leadership, equipment and other factors.


==Personnel==
===Regulars vs. volunteers===

During the course of the Civil War, the vast majority of soldiers fighting to preserve the Union were in the volunteer units. The pre-war regular army numbered approximately 16,400 soldiers, but by the end while the Union army had grown to over a million soldiers, the number of regular personnel was still approximately 21,699, of whom several were serving with volunteer forces. Only 62,000 commissions and enlistments in total were issued for the regular army during the war as most new personnel preferred volunteer service.

Since before the Civil War, the American public had a generally negative view of the nation&#x27;s armed forces, attributable to a Jeffersonian ideal which saw standing armies as a threat to democracy and instead valorized the &quot;citizen soldier&quot; as being more in keeping with American ideals of equality and rugged individualism. This attitude remained unchanged during the Civil War, and afterwards many would attribute the Union&#x27;s victory to the volunteers rather than the leadership and staff work provided by the regular army. In return, officers of the regular army despised the militia and saw them as having dubious value. Commentators such as Emory Upton would later argue that the reliance on militia for the nation&#x27;s defense was responsible for prolonging conflicts and making them more expensive in both money and lives spent.

Despite these attitudes towards the regulars, they would serve as an important foundation around which the Union army was built. In the disastrous First Battle of Bull Run, it was the regulars who acted as rearguard during the retreat while the volunteers fled, and when George McClellan was put in charge of what became the Army of the Potomac he used regular officers and non-commissioned officers to train the volunteers. Training the volunteers, especially in regards to critical administrative and logistical matters, remained an important function of the regulars during the war. This was particularly the case with regular army artillery, as they were more widely dispersed than the infantry and cavalry (making them more visible to the volunteers) and were assigned to specific units to train their volunteer counterparts.

In battle, the regulars&#x27; performance could impress even the most battle-hardened volunteers. At The Wheatfield during the Battle of Gettysburg, the regulars&#x27; fighting skill and orderly retirement under fire drew the admiration of many observers, including Prince Philippe, Count of Paris. As one volunteer put it, &quot;For two years the U.S. Regulars taught us how to be soldiers [;] in the Wheatfield at Gettysburg, they taught us how to die like soldiers.&quot; The regulars became the standard by which the Volunteers were measured, and to be described as being as good or better than them was considered the highest compliment.

===Officers===

Commissioned officers in the Union army could be divided in several categories: general officers, including lieutenant general, which was added on March 2, 1864, major generals and brigadier generals; field officers including colonels, lieutenant colonels and majors; and company officers including captains, first lieutenants and second lieutenants. There was further differentiation between line officers, who were members of the artillery, cavalry or infantry branches, and staff officers, who were part of the various departments and bureaus of the War Department. All line officers outranked staff officers except in cases pertaining to their staff assignment, in which they received their orders from their respective department chiefs. Regular general officers outranked volunteer general officers of the same grade regardless of their date of commission, a feature which could have become a subject of contention. The use of brevet ranks was also a common feature of the Union army.

Officer appointments depended on the commission grade and whether it was in the regular or volunteer forces. The President reserved the right to issue commission for all regular officers and for general officers in the volunteer forces. Volunteer field and company-grade officers could be commissioned by either the president or their respective governor. Company officers were also unique in that they were usually elected by members of their company. The political appointment and/or election of volunteer officers was part of a long-standing militia tradition and of a political patronage system common in the United States. While many of these officers were West Point graduates or had prior military experience, others had none, nor was military leadership a primary consideration in such appointments. Such a policy inevitably resulted in the promotion of inept officers over more able commanders. As the war dragged on and casualties mounted, governors reacted to their constituents&#x27; complaints and instead began to issue commissions on the basis of battlefield rather than political competence.

Officers tended to suffer a higher percentage of battle wounds on account of either the necessity of leading their units into combat and their conspicuousness when accompanied by staff and escorts.

Among memorable field leaders of the army were Nathaniel Lyon (first Union general to be killed in battle during the war), William Rosecrans, George Henry Thomas, William Tecumseh Sherman, Phil Sheridan, and Benjamin F. Butler.

;Officer ranks

*Lieutenant general: The rank of lieutenant general did not exist in the Union army for most of the war until February 1864, when an Act of Congress allowed for its creation. A single lieutenant general was authorized to serve as the commander of all the field armies and geographic departments of the United States, under the direction and at the pleasure of the President. By law, they were allowed two secretaries and four aides-de-camp with the rank of lieutenant colonel, and a chief of staff with the rank of brigadier general.
*Major general: Major generals were nominally the commanding officer of a division, although given the lack of higher grades of general officers they were also given command of army corps, field armies and geographic departments. In the event two or more officers of the same grade were present in the same army or department, command was decided by seniority. In an exception to this practice, the president was authorized by law to appoint a junior officer to command over his seniors. A major general was allowed a personal staff of three aides-de-camp. These were personally chosen by the general from among the captains and lieutenants of the army and would accompany him whenever his command changed, being separate from the general staff of the unit he commanded.
*Brigadier general: A brigadier general was typically in command of a brigade, but like major generals it was not uncommon for them to command larger units. They were responsible for the organization and administration of their command, particularly when operating independently. As with major generals they were also allowed a personal staff of two aides-de-camp of lieutenant grade.
*Colonel: A colonel was the commanding officer of a regiment, though they might also be assigned the commanding officer of larger units or expeditions. They oversaw the recruitment, organization and training of their regiment; conducted parades, reviews and inspections; and managed the administration of the unit, ensuring that soldiers were clothed, fed, armed and paid.
*Lieutenant colonel: A lieutenant colonel was the senior assistant to their regiment&#x27;s colonel in carrying out his duties and taking command in his absence. When the regiment was split among several posts, the lieutenant colonel would command a detachment of four companies. Of those duties specific to a lieutenant colonel were taking care of the personal property of deceased officers; act as officer of the day for a brigade; and conduct regimental courts martial.
*Major: A major acted as an assistant to their regiment&#x27;s colonel in carrying out his duties and commanded detachments of two or more companies. The specific duties of a major were also the same as a lieutenant colonel.
*Captain: A captain was the commanding officer of a company and saw to its administration. This included selecting (with the colonel&#x27;s approval) and training non-commissioned officers, issuing punishments and conducting courts martial, and maintaining company records and books such as inventories and the muster roll. They also served as the officer of the day at a regimental camp or small post.
*Lieutenant: In the US Army there were three grades of lieutenant – first, second and brevet second. The last grade, limited to one per company, was given to West Point graduates and others worthy of the promotion but for whom there was no vacancy. Regardless of grade, lieutenants acted as assistants to the captain, and in his absence the senior-most lieutenant took command. Among their various duties they might be assigned to take the daily roll-call, conduct inspections of the troops, and assist with recordkeeping; oversee the posting of guards when in camp or pickets in the field, command patrols or escorts for general officers; and command fatigue parties. Lieutenants were also chosen to serve on their regiment&#x27;s staff, and may be assigned in an acting capacity to serve on the general staff of a higher unit.

===Enlisted personnel===

Non-commissioned officers (NCOs) were important in the Union army in maintaining the order and alignment of formations during marches, battles, and transitioning between the two. Sergeants in particular were vital in this role as general guides and their selection ideally reserved for the most distinguished soldiers. NCOs were also charged with training individuals in how to be soldiers. While the captain or other company-level officers were responsible for training the soldiers when assembled into squads, platoons or as a company, experienced NCOs could take over this training as well. NCOs were also responsible for the regimental colors, which helped the unit maintain formation and serve as a rally point for the regiment. Typically a sergeant was designated the standard-bearer and protected by a color guard of corporals who only opened fire in defense of the colors. There were a number of staff NCO positions including quartermaster sergeant, ordnance sergeant, and commissary sergeant.

NCOs in the volunteer forces were quite different from their regular counterparts as the war began. Appointed to their role as each regiment was created, they were often on a first-name basis with both their superior officers and the enlisted men they were tasked to lead. Discipline among friends and neighbors was not enforced as strictly as in the regular army, and while some NCOs brought with them prior battlefield experience (whether from the Mexican–American War or foreign military service) many at the start of the war were as equally ignorant as their officers in military matters. Training for these NCOs took place during off-duty hours and often involved lessons based on manuals such as &quot;Hardee&#x27;s Tactics&quot;. One notable exception was Michigan, which designated Fort Wayne as a training center for both officers and NCOs. As the war progressed NCOs gained valuable experience and even drastic disciplinary measures such as execution by firing squad were carried out when deemed necessary. The promotion of soldiers to NCOs (and NCOs to officers) was also increasingly based on battlefield performance, although each state maintained their own standards for when and where promotions could be granted.

;Enlisted ranks
*Sergeant Major: The sergeant major was the senior-most enlisted soldier of a regiment and was expected to serve as a model for the other enlisted personnel. Appointed by the regiment&#x27;s colonel, among his responsibilities was to issue orders to the first sergeants, maintain a roster of the sergeants and corporals detailed to various tasks, and assist the regimental adjutant in his duties. If a regiment didn&#x27;t have a drum major or chief musician, he also had responsibility for overseeing the musicians.
*Quartermaster Sergeant: The quartermaster sergeant was appointed by the regimental quartermaster to assist him in carrying out his duties. This included maintaining the store of supplies and serving as foreman for various work parties. Separately, each Union cavalry company was also authorized a quartermaster sergeant who performed similar tasks but was answerable to the company commander and first sergeant.
*Commissary Sergeant: Appointed by the regimental commissary, the commissary sergeant was responsible for assisting him in requisitioning and issuing rations to the regiment. Union cavalry companies and some artillery companies were also authorized a commissary sergeant to perform similar tasks.
*Hospital Steward: Regimental hospital stewards were responsible for the care of sick and wounded soldiers and their transportation to a general hospital, along with overseeing of any hospital property and medicines. Appointed by the colonel on the advice of the regiment&#x27;s senior surgeon, they could direct any musicians (and later any Ambulance Corps assets) to assist in carrying out these duties. Hospital stewards assigned to general hospitals acted as supervisors to the rest of the hospital staff (except for the doctors). A single steward was considered sufficient for a 150-bed hospital, while a 500-bed hospital would require three stewards: a chief steward charged with administration, one to act as pharmacist and a third overseeing the preparation of meals.
*First Sergeant: The first sergeant was the senior NCO of a company and appointed by the captain to serve as its immediate supervisor. Among his duties were taking roll call, arresting and confining soldiers for offenses committed, and overseeing the company stores (assisted by the company commissary and/or quartermaster sergeants if present).
*Sergeant: Sergeants were chosen from among a company&#x27;s corporals and important for supervising the other soldiers. Each sergeant was in command of a squad of soldiers and directed them in carrying out their duties while in camp or garrison. In battle, sergeants kept the soldiers in ranks and prevented them from falling out; if necessary this included shooting them if they attempted to run away. Sergeants oversaw the changing of guards and pickets, confinement of prisoners (which, if numerous enough, would require one sergeant assigned as provost-sergeant), and led patrols and fatigue parties. One sergeant in the regiment would be chosen as the color sergeant and, protected by the color guard, carried the regimental colors on parade and in battle. 
:Sergeants in the artillery branch commanded individual cannons as the Chief of Piece and were responsible for keeping it maintained and directing its use in battle. Sergeants of the Ordnance Department (distinct from the separate rank of Ordnance Sergeant) were employed at the various arsenals and armories with manufacturing and caring for the various arms and equipment. They were referred to as master armorers, master carriage-makers or master blacksmiths early in the war. Sergeants of the Corps of Engineers, in addition to the normal duties of a sergeant, also had to be knowledgeable in the construction of bridges, forts and other military engineering projects. In the Signal Corps, a sergeant was assigned to each signal officer, from whom he took instruction in order to assist with the sending and receiving of signals and performing mounted reconnaissance.
*Corporal: The lowest grade of NCO, corporals would be chosen from among a company&#x27;s most competent privates and given charge of various tasks and duties. They might be given charge of small parties carrying out fatigue, police or guard duties, and in the absence of the sergeant they may take on their duties. The five most distinguished corporals of a regiment would be chosen to act as the color guard and accompany the color sergeant.
:Artillery corporals acted as gunners and would assist the Chief of Piece in maintaining and aiming the cannon. As with sergeants, corporals of the Ordnance Department were employed at its various facilities. Their formal titles were armorer, carriage-maker or blacksmith until revised later in the war. Likewise, corporals in the Corps of Engineers were also required to be knowledgeable in practical military engineering in addition to their soldierly skills.
*Private: Privates carried out the basic functions of being a soldier in the Union army. When in camp or garrison they filled in on the various work details and fatigue parties, stood guard and policed the local area. They might be assigned to extra duties such as the company cook, tailor, clerk or as orderlies. In the field they were employed in tasks commiserate with their roles as infantry, cavalry or artillery soldiers. This included being deployed as pickets, skirmishers or flankers. 
:Soldiers could also be employed in special duties that were not strictly military in nature: mechanics and laborers, hospital attendants and cooks, regimental armorers, officers&#x27; servants, pioneers, couriers, scouts and spies. In the Corps of Engineers, Ordnance Department, and Signal Corps, privates were further differentiated as first class or second class. First class Engineer and Ordnance privates were formerly referred to as artificers, while second class privates were formerly referred to as laborers.

===Southern Unionists===
Southerners who were against the Confederate cause during the Civil War were known as Southern Unionists. They were also known as Union Loyalists or Lincoln&#x27;s Loyalists. Within the eleven Confederate states, states such as Tennessee (especially East Tennessee), Virginia (which included West Virginia at the time), and North Carolina were home to the largest populations of Unionists. Many areas of Southern Appalachia harbored pro-Union sentiment as well. As many as 100,000 men living in states under Confederate control would serve in the Union army or pro-Union guerilla groups. Although Southern Unionists came from all classes, most differed socially, culturally, and economically from the region&#x27;s dominant pre-war planter class.

===Ethnic composition===
Native-born White Americans made up roughly two-thirds of the soldiers in the Union army, with the rest of many different ethnic groups, including large numbers of immigrants. About 25% of the white men who served in the Union army were foreign-born. The U.S. experienced its heaviest rate of immigration during the 1850s, and the vast majority of these people moved to the Northeastern states. 

Among these immigrants, Germans constituted the largest group with a million arrivals between 1850 and 1860, many of them Forty-Eighters. Nearly as many Irish immigrants arrived during the same period. Immigrant soldiers were among the most enthusiastic in the Union army, not only from a desire to help save their adoptive home but to prove their patriotism towards it. To help cement immigrant enthusiasm and loyalty to the Union, several generals were appointed from these communities, including Franz Sigel and Michael Corcoran.

Many immigrant soldiers formed their own regiments, such as the Irish Brigade, including the 69th New York, 63rd New York, 88th New York, 28th Massachusetts, 116th Pennsylvania; the Swiss Rifles (15th Missouri); the Gardes de Lafayette (55th New York); the Garibaldi Guard (39th New York); the Martinez Militia (1st New Mexico); the Polish Legion (58th New York); the German Rangers; Sigel Rifles (52nd New York, inheriting the 7th); the Cameron Highlanders (79th New York Volunteer Infantry); and the Scandinavian Regiment (15th Wisconsin). But for the most part, the foreign-born soldiers were scattered as individuals throughout units.

The Confederate army was less diverse: 91% of its soldiers were native-born white men and only 9% were foreign-born white men, with Irish being the largest group, other groups included Germans, French, British, and Mexicans. Most Mexicans happened to have been born when the Southwest was still part of Mexico. Some Confederate propaganda condemned foreign-born soldiers in the Union army, likening them to the German Hessian troops who fought alongside the British Army during the American Revolutionary War. A relatively smaller number of Native Americans, including members of Cherokee, Chickasaw, Choctaw and Muscogee peoples, fought for the Confederacy.

====Italian Americans in the Union army====

The great majority of Italian Americans, for both demographic and ideological reasons, served in the Union army (including generals Edward Ferrero and Francis B. Spinola). Six Italian Americans received the Medal of Honor during the war, among whom was Colonel Luigi Palma di Cesnola, who later became the first Director of the Metropolitan Museum of Arts in New York (1879–1904). Most of the Italian-Americans who joined the Union army were recruited from New York City. Many Italians of note were interested in the war and joined the army, reaching positions of authority. Brigadier General Edward Ferrero was the original commander of the 51st New York Regiment. He commanded both brigades and divisions in the eastern and western theaters of war and later commanded a division of the United States Colored Troops. Colonel Enrico Fardella, of the same and later of the 85th New York regiment, was made a brevet brigadier general when the war ended. Francis B. Spinola recruited four regiments in New York, was soon appointed Brigadier General by President Abraham Lincoln and given command of the Spinola Brigade. Later he commanded another unit, the famed Excelsior Brigade.
The Garibaldi Guard recruited volunteers for the Union army from Italy and other European countries to form the 39th New York Infantry. At the outbreak of the American Civil War, Giuseppe Garibaldi was a very popular figure. The 39th New York Volunteer Infantry Regiment, of whose 350 members were Italian, was nicknamed &quot;Garibaldi Guard&quot; in his honor. The unit wore red shirts and &quot;bersaglieri plumes.&quot; They carried with them both a Union Flag as well as an Italian flag with the words &quot;Dio e popolo,&quot; meaning &quot;God and people.&quot; In 1861 Garibaldi himself volunteered his services to President Abraham Lincoln. Garibaldi was offered a major general&#x27;s commission in the U.S. Army through the letter from Secretary of State William H. Seward to H. S. Sanford, the U.S. Minister at Brussels, July 17, 1861.

Colonel Luigi Palma di Cesnola, a former Italian and British soldier and veteran of the Crimean War, commanded the 4th New York Cavalry and would rise to become one of the highest ranking Italian officer in the Union army. He established a military school in New York City where many young Italians were trained and later served in the Union army. Di Cesnola received the Medal of Honor for his actions during the Battle of Aldie. Two more famous examples were Francesco Casale and Luigi Tinelli, who were instrumental in the formation of the 39th New York Infantry Regiment. According to one evaluation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies, there were over 200 Italians who served as officers in the U.S. army.

====African Americans in the Union army====
By 1860, the African American or Black population of the United States consisted of four million enslaved and half a million free Blacks. When the Civil War began, many freedmen in the North attempted to enlist in federal service but were barred from doing so. Popularly-held prejudices doubted whether Black people could be effective soldiers, and President Lincoln believed allowing their enlistment would anger Northern whites and alienate not just the South but the Border States too. However he eventually changed his mind and persuaded Congress to authorize the first official Black enlistment system in late 1862, which evolved into the United States Colored Troops.

Before they were allowed to enlist, many Black people volunteered their services to the Union army as cooks, nurses, and in other informal roles, and several volunteer regiments of Black troops were raised by the states. These included the 1st Kansas Colored Infantry Regiment, the first Black regiment to be raised and the first to engage in combat; the 1st Louisiana Native Guard, raised from both freedmen and escaped slaves after the Capture of New Orleans; and the 54th Massachusetts Infantry Regiment, which became the most famous Black unit after their valiant participation in the Battle of Fort Wagner. Their efforts helped to dispel the notion that Black soldiers were a liability, allowing about 200,000 Black soldiers to serve in the Union army during the Civil War.

Even as they served their country, Black soldiers were subject to discrimination. They were more often assigned to menial labor. Some Union officers refused to employ them in combat, but when they were they often had to use inferior weapons and equipment. Black soldiers were paid less than white soldiers ($10 vs $16 per month) until Congress yielded to public pressure and approved equal pay in June 1864. Black units were led predominantly by white officers, and while more than a hundred Black men were eventually made officers (not counting those passing as white), none were promoted to a rank higher than major. If captured by Confederate forces, Black soldiers risked being made slaves or summarily executed.

===Women in the Union army===

Women took on many significant roles in the Union army and were important to its ultimate success on the battlefield. The most direct way they could help was to enlist and fight as soldiers, although women were officially barred from doing so. Nevertheless, it is believed hundreds of women disguised themselves as men in order to enlist. While many were discovered and forced to quit, others were only found out after they were killed in combat, and a number managed to serve throughout the entire war with their true identity successfully concealed.

One of the more traditional roles played by women in the Union army was that of camp followers. Thousands of white and Black women accompanied Union armies in an unofficial capacity to provide their services as cooks, laundresses, nurses and/or prostitutes. Many were the wives or other female relatives of the soldiers themselves who saw to their personal needs and (if time allowed) looked to the well-being of other soldiers. A somewhat more formal role for some camp followers was that of &quot;vivandière&quot;. Originally a female sutler, the role of &quot;vivandière&quot; expanded to include other responsibilities, including on the battlefield. Armed for their own protection, they brought water to thirsty soldiers, carried the regimental colors and rallied their fellow soldiers to fight, provided first aid or helped the wounded back to a field hospital. A related (and sometimes conflated) role was that of &quot;daughter of the regiment&quot;. Often literally a daughter of one of the regimental officers, these women looked to the soldiers&#x27; well-being but also served as their regiment&#x27;s &quot;mascot&quot; who inspired the men by wearing stylish clothing and enduring the same hardships as them. Some of the most prominent women to accompany the Union armies in the field include Anna Etheridge, Marie Tepe, and Nadine Turchin.

Women also sought to serve more formally as nurses in the Union army, many having been inspired by the work of Florence Nightingale during the Crimean War. However, there was strong resistance against these efforts at first. Societal prejudices saw women as too delicate and the job too unsuitable for women of social rank, particularly at the thought of unmarried women surrounded by thousands of men in close quarters. Nevertheless, Congress eventually approved for women to serve as nurses, to which Dorothea Dix – appointed Superintendent of Army Nurses – was responsible for setting hiring guidelines and starting a training program for prospective candidates. For the women who served, nursing during the Civil War was a hazardous occupation: grueling hours spent in close proximity to deadly diseases and nearby battlefields resulted in many suffering permanent disabilities or death. Added to this were the prejudices of the male medical officers in charge who did not want them there and frequently clashed with the nurses over issues of triage, patient treatments and hospice care. Tens of thousands of women served as nurses for the Union army, among whom are included Clara Barton, Susie King Taylor, Mary Edwards Walker, and Louisa May Alcott.

No less vital were the thousands of women who provided service to the Union army in the field of espionage. Early in the war, women were at a distinct advantage as spies, scouts, smugglers, and saboteurs: the idea of women participating in such dangerous lines of work was simply not considered. Eventually though their opponents recognized their existence, and while female spies caught in the act were not typically executed like their male colleagues, they still faced the threat of lengthy prison sentences. For self-evident reasons many of these activities were kept secret and any documentation (if it existed) was often destroyed. As such the identity of many of these women will never be known. Of those who became famous for their espionage work during or after the end of the war, prominent examples include Harriet Tubman, Mary Louvestre, Pauline Cushman, Elizabeth Van Lew, and Mary Bowser.

==Motivations==
===Anti-slavery sentiment===
In his 1997 book examining the motivations of the American Civil War&#x27;s soldiers, &quot;For Cause and Comrades&quot;, historian James M. McPherson states that Union soldiers fought to preserve the United States, as well as to end slavery, stating that:

McPherson states that witnessing the slave system of the Confederacy first-hand also strengthened the anti-slavery views of Union soldiers, who were appalled by its brutality. He stated that &quot;Experience in the South reinforced the antislavery sentiments of many soldiers.&quot; One Pennsylvanian Union soldier spoke to a slave woman whose husband was whipped, and was appalled by what she had to tell him of slavery. He stated that &quot;I thought I had hated slavery as much as possible before I came here, but here, where I can see some of its workings, I am more than ever convinced of the cruelty and inhumanity of the system.&quot;

==Army administration and issues==
===Adjutant General&#x27;s Department===

The responsibilities and functions of the Adjutant General&#x27;s Department (AGD) were many and varied during the course of the Civil War, but principle among them was handling military correspondence between the President, Secretary of War and General-in-Chief, and the rest of the army. Other functions included administering recruitment, overseeing the appointment of chaplains, maintaining personnel records, and issuing instruction books and other forms. During the war, some of the department&#x27;s responsibilities and functions were spun off to new offices while new ones were added. The recruitment of new white volunteers and draftees, and the suppression and punishment of absenteeism and desertion, was given to the newly formed Provost Marshal General&#x27;s Bureau in May 1863, while the position of Commissioner for the Exchange of Prisoners was created to take over this function from the AGD. The Bureau of Colored Troops was created within the AGD specifically to oversee the creation of the United States Colored Troops, and in the final year of the war the AGD was given the responsibility for collecting and editing documents which would constitute &quot;The War of the Rebellion: A Compilation of the Official Records of the Union and Confederate Armies&quot;.

At the start of the Civil War, the AGD numbered just fourteen regular officers: the Adjutant General (AG) with the rank of colonel, a lieutenant-colonel, four brevet majors, and eight brevet captains. In August 1861 the AG was raised to major-general and the strength of the AGD increased to twenty officers, and a year later it was reorganized to constitute the AG, two colonels, four lieutenant-colonels, and thirteen majors. The small number of civilian clerical staff supporting the officers was also increased as the war progressed, including the addition of up to ten noncommissioned officers by 1862. However to meet the need for assistant adjutant generals authorized for each corps, division and brigade, appointments were made from among the volunteer forces, and by 1865 there were an additional 85 majors and 256 captains serving in these capacities. At the regimental level, one of the unit&#x27;s lieutenants would be selected to serve as its adjutant.

In spite of the rapid increase of the army at the start presenting numerous challenges and being perpetually understaffed throughout the war, the AGD appears to have handled its responsibilities competently and with little disruption. The AGD also had fewer conflicts with field commanders compared to some of the other departments, partly because its authority was well-established and issued few controversial orders itself, and it was less affected by matters of procurement and emerging technologies.

;Leadership
Colonel Lorenzo Thomas was named Adjutant General of the army on March 7, 1861, one day after Col. Samuel Cooper resigned the join the Confederacy. While Thomas served as the AG throughout the entirety of the war, he eventually ran afoul of Secretary Stanton, who reassigned him to the job of recruiting soldiers for black regiments in the western theater. From March 1863 on then, the assistant adjutant general Colonel Edward D. Townsend essentially was the acting AG in Washington.

===Bureau of Military Justice===

An office of the Judge Advocate had existed in the US Army since its founding, consisting at the start of the Civil War of a single officer with the rank of major and small civilian clerical staff in Washington. It was not until after the war began however that Congress formally authorized the appointment of a Judge Advocate General (JAG) and creation of the Bureau of Military Justice, a de facto department and forerunner to a true Judge Advocate General&#x27;s Department. The principle functions of the JAG included conducting courts-martial and inquiries; codifying the laws of war and the military laws of the United States; reviewing the records of courts-martial, military commissions and inquiries; and asserting the jurisdiction of military commissions over civilians in times of war.

To meet the demands of a vastly larger army, Congress authorized in July 1862 the appointment of a JAG with the rank of colonel and for President Lincoln to appoint a judge advocate of volunteers with the rank of major for each army in the field. These judge advocates were to advise commanders on legal issues, prosecute offenses, and review and maintain the records of courts-martial and other proceedings in the field. A year later, Congress legislated the creation of the Bureau of Military Justice, gave it an appellant function, and authorized the JAG to head it as a brigadier general alongside an assistant JAG with the rank of colonel. With these authorizations came a small increase in the size of the clerical staff assisting the JAG.

During the war the JAG and his subordinates were able to satisfactorily handle the increased volume and complexity of legal matters that came with the exponential growth of the army. Among their most important accomplishments was the creation of the Lieber Code and, for the first time, collecting all precedents, decisions and opinions which had become US military law into a single digest and publishing it in early 1865. One of the most controversial issues associated with the bureau was the use of military commissions to try civilians, an issue which would not be settled until &quot;Ex parte Milligan&quot; was decided in 1866.

;Leadership
The Civil War began with brevet Major John F. Lee serving as the judge advocate of the army until September 3, 1862, when Joseph Holt was formally appointed as JAG. Holt played an important parts in helping to expanding the office of the JAG and oversaw some of the most important and sensitive trials of the war. However Holt also made many enemies while JAG and was severely criticized for his handling of the trial of President Lincoln&#x27;s assassins.

===Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands===

In March 1865 the Bureau of Refugees, Freedmen, and Abandoned Lands was created by Congress with a mandate to see to the needs of all Black freedmen and white refugees, and the management of all lands within the rebel states which had been abandoned or otherwise come into the possession of the United States. It consisted of a commissioner as head of the bureau, an assistant commissioner for each of the rebel states, and a small staff of one chief and nine other clerks. Additionally, any military officer could be assigned to duty on behalf of the bureau. Major General Oliver Otis Howard was appointed to head the bureau at its creation and lead it throughout its lifetime. While the Freedmen&#x27;s Bureau was the center of much controversy during the Reconstruction era and some of the relief it provided was less than satisfactory, its most important contribution was in providing education to many Blacks and poor whites.

===Corps of Engineers===

The Corps of Engineers was a small part of the army prior to the Civil War but played an important role not only in the conflict but for the nation as a whole. The Corps was responsible for running the United States Military Academy at West Point, which supplied officers to all branches but whose top graduates were commissioned into the Corps. They were not only involved with military engineering such as constructing fortifications and harbor defenses but also oversaw civil engineering including building canals, bridges and similar projects. This focus on civil works did prevent the Corps from devoting its entire effort to the war though. Corps personnel acted as combat engineers during battle, helping to construct pontoon bridges, repair roads and bridges, dig trenches, and conduct reconnaissance. The Corps also exerted an influence beyond its small size as many of the Union&#x27;s most prominent officers, including McClellan and Meade, were themselves trained as engineers and used their knowledge to influence the outcome of battles.

Prior to the war, the Corps of Engineers consisted of just forty-eight officers and a single company of 150 engineer troops. Engineer Company A was first created for the Mexican–American War and guarded President Lincoln at his first inauguration. It was organized with ten sergeants (master-workmen), ten corporals (overseers), two musicians, sixty-four first-class privates (artificers) and sixty-four second-class privates (laborers). In August 1861 Congress authorized the formation of three more companies to be organized the same as Engineer Company A, with all four organized into a single battalion (the US Engineer Battalion, later 1st Engineer Battalion), and the addition of two lieutenant colonels, four majors and six lieutenants to the Corps. The battalion had no formal headquarters but fell under the command of the most senior officer present. In March 1863, when the Corps of Topographical Engineers was disbanded and its function merged with the Corps of Engineers, Congress further revised the Corps to consist of a brigadier-general as Chief Engineer, four colonels, ten lieutenant-colonels, twenty majors, thirty captains, thirty first lieutenants and ten second lieutenants.

The US Engineer Battalion served ably as part of the Army of the Potomac, but on its own was insufficient to see to the army&#x27;s need for engineers throughout the different theaters of war. A small number of volunteer engineer regiments were formed during the war, including the 1st Michigan Engineers and Mechanics Regiment, the 1st New York Engineer Regiment and the 1st United States Veteran Volunteer Engineer Regiment. However, in many cases engineering work was carried out by line soldiers under the supervision of officers with engineering backgrounds, if any were available. Most types of engineering work, such as digging simple earthworks or laying small bridges, did not require the specialized skills of engineers, which were required for complex endeavors like constructing pontoon bridges or forts. Union armies typically detailed soldiers to form company-sized detachments of pioneers to repair roads or bury the dead after a battle.

===Corps of Topographical Engineers===

The Corps of Topographical Engineers had been established in 1831 with the mission of exploration, surveying, and cartography, particularly in the American West. Topographical engineers (or &quot;topogs&quot;) including John C. Frémont, Howard Stansbury, William H. Emory and Gouverneur K. Warren were instrumental in the westward expansion of the United States. During the war, the civilian nature of the Corps&#x27; mission was largely suspended and it undertook the role of reconnaissance, construction of defensive works and supplying maps to the army. In these conditions drawing a distinction between the two corps became increasingly impractical, until in March 1863 the Corps of Topographical Engineers was disbanded and its mission taken up by the Corps of Engineers.

The Topographical Engineers numbered forty-five officers before the Civil War. In August 1861 an additional two lieutenant colonels, four majors and six lieutenants were authorized by Congress. There were no enlisted men in the Corps, although when the Corps was expanded Congress also authorized a company of engineers for the Topographical Engineers to be modeled after the Corps of Engineers. However this company was never formed, and the actual size of the Corps shrank as a number retired, died, defected to the Confederacy or became general officers of the volunteers, until eventually the remaining officers were absorbed by the Corps of Engineers.

The most important role played by the Topographical Engineers, even after their merger with the regular Corps, was providing desperately-needed maps to army commanders. Each field army headquarters established their own topographical departments under the supervision of engineer officers, which would provide the army with maps necessary for a given campaign. Such departments themselves were staffed with teams of draughtsmen and assistants and stocked with printing presses, photographic and lithographic equipment.
;Leadership
The Chief of Topographical Engineers at the start of the Civil War was Colonel John James Abert. Colonel Abert had been responsible for lobbying Congress to make the Corps an independent branch of War Department and was appointed to lead his creation in 1838. He retired in September 1861 and was replaced by Stephen Harriman Long, who remained in the position until the Corps was disbanded. Thereafter he continued to serve in the Corps of Engineers as the senior officer to the Chief Engineer.

===Inspector General&#x27;s Department===

At the start of the Civil War, there was technically no Inspector General&#x27;s Department, with neither a set of operating practices or centralized direction. Instead there were two Inspector Generals (IGs) with the rank of colonel whose duty was to conduct inspections and investigations to ensure the army was organized and operating at full readiness, but these were done in an ad-hoc manner at the discretion of the Secretary of War. As the war progressed and membership in the inspectorate increased, the duties of IGs and assistant IGs were continually redefined, to the extent that any time a problem was identified the common response was simply to assign an inspector to it. Eventually in January 1863 a permanent office of the IG was established in Washington, and it was from here that the process of exerting a centralized control over IGs in the field and crafting standard policies and procedures was started.

In August 1861, Congress authorized an increase of two additional IGs with the rank of colonel and five assistant IGs with the rank of major from among the regular army. This number stayed the same throughout the entire war, with the addition of a small civilian clerical staff once the Washington office was established. Congress eventually determined that each geographical department, army, corps, division and brigade would also be assigned an IG or assistant IG, however these positions were to be filled by regular or volunteer officers detailed from line units of the army or from the other staff departments.

The inspectorate faced many challenges during the Civil War, including hostility and lack of cooperation from some commanders and the mixed performance of some IGs in the field. Despite these issues it was able to successfully meet the challenges of the war overall, particularly with bringing under control the waste, fraud and abuse which had been rampant at the start of the conflict.
;Leadership
At the start of the war the inspectorate consisted of Colonel Sylvester Churchill, the senior IG of the army, and Colonel Joseph K. Mansfield, the junior IG. Churchill however took leave in April 1861 on account of his health and formally retired in September that year, while Mansfield was promoted to major-general and left to command troops in May. Colonel Henry Lee Scott replaced Mansfield that same month, but when Churchill retired his position was given to Colonel Randolph Marcy, father-in-law to George McClellan, in the same month. Serving as the chief of staff to McClellan, Marcy did not formally take up his duties as senior IG until after the Battle of Antietam, by which point however his association with McClellan had soured Marcy&#x27;s relationship with Secretary Stanton, who sent him on inspection tours of various geographical departments. Instead, the de facto leader of the inspectorate was whoever was the IG in charge of the Washington office, which was Colonel Delos Sacket between January 1863 and March 1864, and Colonel James Allen Hardie for the remainder of the war.

===Medical Department===
The Army Medical Department (AMD) was rivaled only by the Quartermaster&#x27;s Department in the scope and complexity of its responsibilities: caring for sick and wounded soldiers, operating field and general hospitals, and acquiring and distributing medicine, medical equipment, hospital food and similar supplies. Functions such as evacuating soldiers off the battlefield or constructing hospitals were handled were handled by other departments, though later in the war the AMD assumed many of these roles. In March 1864 it was placed in charge of casualty evacuation (U.S. Ambulance Corps) and the organization and operation of medical supply trains. In December it was given control over the construction and equipping of military hospitals, and of hospital trains and hospital ships in February 1865. Other responsibilities assumed during the war included care for disabled veterans and their families, prisoners of war, refugees and freed slaves; maintaining medical records of the dead and wounded; and preparing a medical and surgical history of the war. The AMD started out the war staffed by a conservative and inflexible leadership which negatively impacted its functioning, but would eventually be rectified by war&#x27;s end.

In April 1861 the AMD was the largest of the staff departments in the regular army: a Surgeon General (with the rank of colonel), thirty surgeons, eighty-three assistant surgeons, and fifty-nine Hospital Stewards. However this number was barely adequate to meet the needs of the army in peacetime, and in May 1861 an additional ten surgeons and twenty assistant surgeons were added to cover the new regular army regiments being raised. Later that year in August, Congress authorized the appointment of fifty medical cadets to be chosen from young men with a liberal education and prior medical experience. They had the rank and pay of West Point cadets and were to act as ambulance attendants in the field and assistants in general hospitals.

In April 1862, Congress authorized a substantial reorganization of the AMD. Beyond promoting the surgeon general to brigadier general and adding additional staff, one of the most controversial was the introduction of medical inspectors, as a number of these were appointed by Secretary Stanton for &quot;political&quot; purposes. Charged with supervising all aspects of sanitary conditions within the army, their purview included the inspection of quarters, camps, hospitals and transports; their duties were later expanded to include issuing certificates of discharge for reasons of disability. Congress also gave the surgeon general the authority to hire as many hospital stewards as necessary, and a month later they authorized the addition of six trained apothecaries and druggists as medical storekeepers.

Most regular army medical officers served in staff positions, whether at the office in Washington or out in the field as regimental surgeons, attending physicians in general hospitals, medical purveyors who ran medical supply depots and laboratories, or as the medical director of a division, corps, field army or military department. Medical directors oversaw the operation of field hospitals and the associate medical personnel, field sanitation and medical supply within their command. However, there was no statutory basis for their assignment, and it wasn&#x27;t until February 1865 when Congress bowed to pressure and provided for officers serving in these capacities to receive rank, pay and emoluments appropriate to their responsibilities.

Added to the relatively small number of regular army medical personnel were a further 546 surgeons and assistant surgeons volunteers, appointed by the president to supplement regular army personnel in staff positions; another 5,532 civilian doctors employed under contract (mainly in general hospitals) as acting assistant surgeons; a small number of medical officers of the Veteran Reserve Corps; and the thousands of regimental surgeons and assistant surgeons appointed to the volunteer regiments by their respective state governors. Thousands more civilians were employed by the AMD as nurses, clerks, hospital attendants, laborers, etc. The AMD was further augmented by a number of private and semi-official philanthropic organizations, foremost among which was the United States Sanitary Commission (USCC).

The chaotic aftermath of the first Battle of Bull Run – no coordination between field hospitals and casualty evacuation, regimental surgeons refusing to treat soldiers from other units, and the few ambulance drivers robbing their charges or fleeing – exemplified the inadequacies of pre-war planning and preparations. Burdened with an aged and conservative leadership, it took the injection of more enlightened leaders to make the necessary reforms for the AMD to meet these new challenges. By the war&#x27;s end, the AMD had implemented a better method of evacuating battlefield casualties to field hospitals and general hospitals, established laboratories to test and certify drugs and other medicines, identified reliable sources of supply and implemented effective contracting procedures, and increased the number of medical personnel to see to the needs of over a million men under arms.

Some challenges remained however, against which only small progress was made. Although improved field sanitation reduced disease rates and some advances like the use of chloroform proved helpful, a lack of aseptic surgery or general understanding of the germ theory led to many deaths from disease, shock or secondary infection. Psychological trauma was not well understood and the average soldier made due with an inadequate diet for maintaining their health. The AMD&#x27;s reliance on the Quartermaster and Subsistence departments for transportation and rations respectively left these subject to interdepartmental rivalry until late in the war, and personal conflict between military commanders and their supporting medical personnel could lead to problematic health outcomes. Despite these faults, AMD personnel did their best to alleviate the suffering of their fellow soldiers and laid the groundwork for future improvement.

;Leadership
The Surgeon General at the start of the war was Colonel Thomas Lawson, who at 97 years was on his deathbed and his duties were being carried out Major Robert C. Wood, one of his assistants. When he passed in May 1861 Lawson was succeeded by Clement Finley, another old soldier who was characterized by contemporaries as &quot;utterly ossified and useless&quot;. Finley was slow to act, failed to reform the AMD to address the needs of the war, and particularly opposed to the use of female nurses. He was forced to retire by Secretary Stanton in April 1862 and replaced with William A. Hammond, who immediately went about reorganizing the AMD, eliminating red tape and promoting competent young men to positions of authority. His strong independent streak also earned the enmity of Secretary Stanton, who in September 1863 sent him on an extended tour of the western theater and made Colonel Joseph Barnes the acting Surgeon General. When Hammond was arrested, court-martialed and dismissed in August 1864, Barnes was promoted to fill his position. Barnes remained the Surgeon General until after the war&#x27;s end and succeeded in continuing Hammond&#x27;s reforms by maintaining an excellent relationship with Secretary Stanton.

===Ordnance Department===

The principal mission of the Ordnance Department (ORDD) during the Civil War was the development, procurement, storage, distribution and repair of all army ordnance and ordnance-related equipment such as limbers and caissons and accoutrements. It was also responsible for the procurement of horses to pull artillery until June 1861 when the Quartermaster Department took over that job. The department faced challenges during the war, particularly during the early months as it struggled to arm the vastly expanded Union army whilst traitorous forces seized control of a number of arsenals and depots. Eventually it was able to resolve many of these challenges and succeeded in providing thousands of field artillery pieces and millions of small arms for the Union army.

When the Civil War began the Ordnance Department was commanded by a Chief of Ordnance and authorized forty officers, many in command of the army&#x27;s arsenals and depots; fifteen ORDD military storekeepers; seventy ordnance sergeants, often placed in supervisory roles including command of some depots and arsenals; and four hundred enlisted men, most of whom were employed as technicians at the armories and arsenals. Hundreds of civilians were also employed, not only as clerks and laborers but also technicians and supervisors. There were also artificiers on the rolls of the army&#x27;s artillery regiments who were responsible for the maintenance of weapons within their regiments.

Even in peacetime the size of the ORDD was insufficient, as fifty-six officers alone would&#x27;ve been required to bring the arsenals to their full authorized strength, and it proved inadequate once the war began. In August 1861 Congress increased the authorized number of officers to forty-five: the Chief of Ordnance (brigadier general), two colonels, two lieutenant colonels, four majors, twelve captains, twelve first lieutenants, and twelve second lieutenants. This still was not enough, and so in March 1863 an additional lieutenant colonel, two majors, eight captains and eight first lieutenants were added, bringing the authorized strength to sixty-four officers where it would remain for the rest of the war. The number of ordnance sergeants and enlisted personnel were similarly increased on a yearly basis, until by 1865 they numbered 163 and 560 respectively, and the civilian staff was likewise increased.

In the field, each regiment was authorized an ordnance officer (to be chosen from among the unit&#x27;s lieutenants) who, assisted by an ordnance sergeant, saw to the requisition and issuing of arms to the troops and management of the regimental ammunition train. For brigades and higher echelons of command, an ordnance officer was authorized to serve on the unit&#x27;s staff with similar responsibilities. However unlike with the other supply departments, the ordnance department did not commission any volunteer officers to this role, instead relying on ORRD officers or (at division level and below) relying on regular officers filling the role as acting ordnance officers or combining the role with the assigned quartermaster.

The ORDD maintained a number of arsenals, armories and depots, where the majority of the army&#x27;s arms, ammunition and other ordnance-related supplies were manufactured and/or stored. A number were seized before or at the war&#x27;s outbreak, but more were created after fighting began and existing ones were expanded. By the middle of the war, the largest arsenals employed between one and two thousand civilians each. A substantial number of these employees were women and children, partly because they could be paid less than adult male workers, their small hands were thought to be better suited to assembling cartridges, and women were believed to be more safety-oriented. Their line of work was dangerous for obvious reasons, and a number died in accidental explosions during the war. In the single-worst accident of the war, the explosion at the Allegheny Arsenal, 70 of the 78 victims were women and girls.

The ORDD faced an immediate crisis when the war began as it was suddenly responsible for arming the rapidly-expanding number of troops being brought into Federal service. This job was made more difficult by actions taken by Secretary of War John B. Floyd before the war, when he ordered the transfer of large numbers of arms from Northern to Southern arsenals and the sale of Federal arms to various Southern states. When the Southern states did seize the arsenals within their territory, in addition to the gun-making equipment at Harper&#x27;s Ferry they were able to acquire about 159,000 small arms, 429 cannons, and 4.5 million rounds of small arms ammunition. ORDD was forced to make up the immediate shortfall by contracting with private companies or purchasing from European powers; many weapons bought under contract proved to be inferior to government standards or sold at inflated prices, while European governments were happy to get rid of their obsolete weapons. Eventually the fraud and corruption was brought under control and ORDD was able to bring its arsenals&#x27; productions levels up to where they could meet the army&#x27;s need. This can be seen with the rapid expansion of the Springfield Armory, which before the war averaged 800 muskets a month but by January 1863 was producing 24,000 muskets and rifles a month.

A more persistent issue faced by ORDD were efforts by members of Congress, the general public, and even President Lincoln to get them to adopt many new military technologies, particularly breech-loading and repeating rifles like the Spencer and Henry rifle. The department&#x27;s senior leadership was unwilling to wholeheartedly embrace this technology without extensive field testing, and worried over delays from retooling manufacturing equipment and other logistical concerns that went with their adoption. Nevertheless, a limited number of these weapons were purchased and distributed to troops in the field, and trials were undertaken to determine which one would become the army&#x27;s standard rifle for general use, although these weren&#x27;t completed until well after the war ended.

After the war ORDD came under harsh criticisms, particularly over their conservatism in regards to new technology. However it did meet the challenge of equipping the Union army with many modern weapons and other materiel. From the beginning of the war to the end, Federal arsenals produced 7,892 cannons with over six million artillery shot and shell and six million pounds of grapeshot and canister shot; more than 4 million small arms with over a billion rounds of small arms ammunition; over 13,000 tons of gunpowder and 45,000 tons of lead; and nearly 3 million complete sets of infantry and cavalry accoutrements and horse equipment.

;Leadership
Henry K. Craig was the Chief of Ordnance when the Civil War began, having served in that position since 1851. Craig received much of the blame for the poor state of affairs at the time, and angered many special interests by resisting the purchase of new and untested weapons in favor of increasing arsenal production and limiting purchases to reputable domestic and international sources. His obstinate behavior saw Craig relieved and replaced with James Wolfe Ripley on April 23, 1861. However Ripley was similarly resistant to these same private contractors and their Congressional backers, particularly with adopting breech-loading rifles, and so was forced to retire on September 15, 1863. His replacement, George D. Ramsay, was more open to the new weaponry but did not have the confidence of Secretary Stanton, who inserted Captain George T Balch into Ramsay&#x27;s headquarters to &quot;call the shots&quot;. Ramsay endured this situation until forced to retire on September 12, 1864. Alexander Brydie Dyer took over as Chief of Ordnance and served out the remainder of the war heading the department. While resistant to the lobbyists like his predecessors, Dyer was a more enthusiastic proponent of breech-loading and repeating rifles. He was also more bureaucratically adept and able to remain on good terms with Secretary Stanton.

===Pay Department===

The Pay Department had the responsibility of accounting for, maintaining records regarding, and disbursing of funds for payment to army personnel, including allowances and bounties, as well as settling claims against the government related to pay and allowances. It was not however responsible for payments on contracts and other obligations incurred by the Army as those were handled by the respective department. Payments to officers and soldiers was supposed to be made on a bi-monthly basis, although circumstances might see these delayed significantly (as much as by eight months in some cases).

As originally organized the Pay Department was headed by a paymaster general with the rank of colonel, two deputy paymasters general with the rank of lieutenant colonel, and twenty-five paymasters with the rank of major. There were also a small number of civilian clerks, but no enlisted personnel assigned to the department. Cash was received directly by the paymaster general from the Treasury Department and forwarded to the supervising paymaster of a given &quot;pay district&quot; or field headquarters. These funds were then distributed under armed guard to the officers and soldiers within the pay district. Pay districts generally coincided with the boundaries of military divisions, departments and districts, which as the army grew the number and size of pay districts grew likewise. This required the appointment of more paymasters during the course of the war and an increase in the number of civilian clerks, the latter of which reached a peak of 155 by 1864.

The rapid increase in the size of the army presented a significant challenge to the Pay Department, as the number of soldiers needed to be paid was over fifty times greater than the pre-war size. This was particularly the case for sick and wounded soldiers who were separated from their units and so harder to located. However while payments were occasionally delayed, it never got to the point where soldiers felt compelled to mutiny as had been done during the Revolution. In the four years and four months of the Civil War, the Pay Department disbursed $1,029,239,000 of which $541,000 was lost due to embezzlements and other causes, at an expense of $6,429,600.

;Leadership
When the Civil War began, Colonel Benjamin F. Larned served as Paymaster General but was in poor health. He was temporarily relieved of duty in July 1862 due to illness and would die a few months later. From July until December of that year, Major Cary H. Fry served as the acting Paymaster General, when Timothy Andrews was appointed to the position. He would remain in that position until retiring in November 1864, when Benjamin Brice was appointed in his place and finished out the war as Paymaster General. Both Andrews and Brice argued that the position of Paymaster General should made a brigadier general and the number and rank of subordinate paymasters similarly increased, commensurate with the type of expansion other administrative departments experienced during the war, but their recommendations were ignored.

===Provost Marshal General&#x27;s Bureau===

The Provost Marshal General&#x27;s Bureau (PMGB) was created to oversee the apprehension of deserters, conduct counterespionage, and recover stolen government property. Originally established as an office of the AGD in September 1862, it was made an independent department in May 1863 as part of the Conscription Act of 3 March 1863. The Conscription Act also made it responsible for the administration of the draft system, with two other responsibilities added later that year: first with the management of the Invalid Corps in April, and then the recruitment of white volunteers in May. Intended only as temporary organization for the duration of the war the PMGB was effectively terminated in August 1866, whereupon all records, funds and responsibilities were transferred to the AGD.

Initially consisting of a single officer, the provost marshal general (PMG) himself, eventually the bureau was authorized fourteen additional officers split between several branches. However, a mix of officers from the regulars, volunteers, and Invalid Corps were also detailed to the PMGB to fulfill a number of rolls. Each congressional district was appointed a provost marshal who served on a &quot;board of enrollment&quot;. The board included two other persons (one of whom was to be a licensed physician) and was charged with overseeing the enrollment of men for the draft. An enrolling officer could also be appointed per subdistrict (town, township or ward) on a temporary basis, as could special agents tasked with apprehending deserters. Additionally, all provost marshals and special agents were empowered to arrest any stragglers and send them to the nearest military post. By November 1864 the PMGB (not counting the Invalid Corps) included 4,716 officers and employees.

In the aggregate, the PMGB was successful in the enrollment and maintenance of sufficient manpower for the Union army. Over one million men were brought into the Union army at a cost of $9.84 per man (versus $34.01 per man prior to the bureau&#x27;s formation) and the arrest and return to duty of over 76,500 deserters. The bureau was also able to raise $26 million to fully fund its enrollment and draft duties.

;Leadership
When originally created as an office of the AGD, Colonel Simeon Draper was named the Provost Marshal General, which he held from October 1862 to March 1863. However, the PMGB did not live up to expectations under Draper&#x27;s leadership. When it was made an independent department he was replaced with James Barnet Fry, who served as the PMG until the bureau&#x27;s dissolution.

===Quartermaster&#x27;s Department===

The Quartermaster&#x27;s Department (QMD) was the most important and extensive department of the Union army, not least because it provided transportation services to the entire army, including the other supply departments. The QMD was responsible for the procurement, storage and distribution of supplies not already covered by another supply department, including various equipage (clothing, tents, stoves, etc.), horses and mules (Cavalry Bureau), forage and fuel, and non-Ordnance vehicles including wagons, ambulances and traveling forges. Other assumed responsibilities included the acquisition, construction and maintenance of various military structures such as barracks, hospitals, wharves, storehouses, etc.; the charter, purchase and maintenance of all riverine and ocean-going vessels used by the army and the Western Gunboat Flotilla; the construction, maintenance and management of all military railroad transportation (United States Military Railroad); the construction, maintenance and management of military telegraph lines (U.S. Military Telegraph Corps); management of all wagon trains in the field; the collection and burial of the dead and maintenance of national cemeteries; and any expenses associated with army movement and operations that did not fall under another department&#x27;s purview.

The QMD at the start of the war consisted of just thirty-seven officers, seven military storekeepers, and thirteen civilian clerks at the office of the Quartermaster-General (QMG), a situation which was considered understaffed even for peacetime requirements. Within a month of the conflict&#x27;s start, Congress passed an act to raise the number of officers to forty-nine, and again several months later it was raised to seventy-six, adding an assistant quartermaster-general (colonel) and additional numbers of deputy quartermaster-generals (lieutenant colonel), quartermasters (major) and assistant quartermasters (captain) to support the QMG (brigadier-general). Although a substantial increase, this was not enough to meet the needs of the QMD, and so more than nine hundred assistant quartermasters of volunteers were commissioned and a large number of regular and volunteer officers were detailed to serve as acting quartermasters during the war. Congress also authorized the number of storekeepers increased to twelve and the hiring of additional clerks and other civilian workers for the office (including women), which would grow to over 200 by 1863 and close to 600 by the war&#x27;s end. To this were added the many civilians working at the quartermaster depots or with quartermasters in the field. Many of these workers were rowdy and difficult to manage, especially before Congress made QMD employees subject to military law and discipline. One exception were Black workers who proved more reliable and whom Quartermaster-General Meigs considered a great aid; by 1864 the QMD was largely reliant on them to fulfill various unskilled positions.

Officers of the QMD were assigned as commanders of the various quartermaster depots or to the staff of various field units (with the exception of regiments, whose quartermaster personnel were selected from among its own officers and NCOs). Depot commanders were responsible for the acquisition, storage and distribution of supplies and the disbursement of funds for transportation and other services. Supplies could be manufactured within the depot or purchased from commercial interests, usually as part of a low-bid contract but in an emergency on the open market. In the first three years of the war depot commanders themselves were responsible for managing these contracts, but by July 1864 a more centralized system requiring approval from the QMG&#x27;s office had been implemented to improve accountability. Based on unit quartermasters&#x27; requests, supplies would be shipped to advanced depots or railheads, where the unit quartermasters arraigned to have them picked up and issued to the unit.

The principal depots of the QMD were located in Cincinnati, Milwaukee, New York, Philadelphia, Quincy, Illinois, Steubenville, Ohio, St. Louis, and Washington, D.C., with other major depots located in Baltimore, Chicago, Louisville, New Orleans, and San Francisco. New York, Philadelphia, and Washington were the primary depots supporting Union armies in the eastern theater, with Cincinnati, St. Louis, and Louisville the primary support depots in the western theater. Many advanced and temporary depots were established as needed, including at Alexandria, Virginia, Fort Monroe, City Point, Virginia, and Nashville, which could become as large and busy as any general depot. However, despite these depots being responsible for thousands of soldiers and millions of dollars in supplies, many of their commanders were only captains. Congress approved in July 1864 the appointment of ten depot commanders to the rank of colonel, while other commanders either received a volunteer commission or brevet rank of brigadier general for as long as they remained at their depot.

In the early months of the conflict, the QMD struggled to clothe, equip and transport the rapidly-growing Union army, especially as fraud, war profiteering and political interference was rampant. Under the able leadership of Quartermaster-General Meigs and legislation passed by Congress, this corruption was quickly brought under control and most quartermasters (with notable exceptions such as Justus McKinstry) proved to be able and law-abiding. Undoubtedly this was due in part to the requirement that quartermasters file a bond worth $10,000 that made them personally liable for their supplies. The exception to this was when the supplies were destroyed due to natural causes or to prevent them falling into enemy hands, a situation which perversely caused celebration among some quartermasters. While there were inevitably mistakes and other mishaps, the Union army was rarely deprived of the supplies and services provided by the QMD. Although the scope and scale of the Civil War was beyond any prewar planning, the professional competence of the department allowed it to quickly meet every challenge. It also exploited emerging technologies like railroads and steamboats with expertise to support the Union army like never before at a strategic and operational level.

Of the $1.8 billion spent by the Federal government during the war, over a billion of that was distributed by the Quartermaster Department. Among the staggering number of supplies and services acquired by the QMD include approximately a million horses and half a million mules; the movement by rail of over 1.2 million troops; 590 ocean-going vessels under charter or owned outright providing over 190,000 tons of shipping, with another 599 riverine vessels; over 1.6 million tons of coal and 500,000 cords of wood; over 22 million bushels of corn, 78 million of oat, 1.5 million tons of hay and 21,000 tons of straw and other fodder; more than $23 million for the rental, construction and maintenance of army property; and over 51,000 standard army wagons and 5,300 ambulances.

;Leadership
The Quartermaster General at the start of the war was Joseph E. Johnston, who resigned shortly after on April 22, 1861, to join the Confederate army. Major Ebenezer S. Sibly served as acting QMG until Montgomery C. Meigs was appointed and took up his new duties on June 13, 1861. Considered one of the most effective leaders to serve in the Union army, Meigs oversaw the expansion of the QMD to meet the demands of the war and continued to lead it well after its end. Meigs was also a hands-on manager and from August 1863 to January 1864 he was busy handling logistical matters in the western theatre. During his absence, Colonel Charles Thomas served as acting QMG in Washington.

===Signal Corps===

The creation of a Signal Corps for the US Army was the result of Albert James Myer, an army surgeon who had developed a system of military signals based on sign language known as wigwag. Myer was appointed to the rank of major and to lead the Signal Corps (albeit as its only officer) effective June 27, 1860. During the early years of the Civil War the Signal Corps did not have any personnel other than Myer appointed to it. Instead, officers and enlisted men were sent from other units to Fort Monroe to learn his system and in turn teach others. Myer continued to campaign for a more formal and permanent Signal Corps, which was finally granted by Congress on March 3, 1863. However, a dispute between the Signal Corps and the U.S. Military Telegraph Corps over who controlled electrical telegraphy led Secretary Stanton to replace Myer with Maj. William Nicodemus in November of that year. After an inadvertent release of confidential information, Nicodemus was in turn replaced by Colonel Bejamin Fisher, who would remain the Corps&#x27; commander until the end of the war. The Signal Corps proved instrumental in coordinating the actions of the Union army during the Civil War and afterwards Congress appointed Myers to once again lead it in 1866.

===Subsistence Department===
The mission of the Subsistence Department was the purchase, storage and distribution of rations and related items in a timely manner. It was the smallest of the four supply departments, and even as the army grew to encompass over a million soldiers the department itself barely expanded in size. Yet it was able to meet its mission to such an extent that President Lincoln once remarked to an officer &quot;Your department we scarcely hear of; it is like a well-regulated stomach, works so smoothly we are not conscious of having it.&quot;

The authorized strength of the department at the war&#x27;s start was a Commissary General of Subsistence (CGS) with the rank of colonel, an assistant CGS with the rank of lieutenant colonel, and ten commissaries of subsistence (CS), two with the rank of major and the rest captains. Those not assigned to work at the office of the CGS in Washington were in charge of one of the subsistence depots or purchasing offices, or assigned to the staff of one of the military departments. Although there were no enlisted personnel in the department (all commissary positions at the regimental level being fulfilled by members of the regiment), a small civilian staff of clerks and laborers was assigned to the department.

To meet the needs of feeding the rapidly-expanding Union army, Congress authorized a CS with the rank of captain to be assigned to each brigade in July 1861, and in August 1861 the department was expanded with twelve additional officers, four majors and eight captains. A year later when army corps were officially created a CS with the rank of lieutenant colonel was authorized to serve on their staff, and in February 1863 the department was further expanded when the CGS was promoted to brigadier general, a second assistant CGS was added with the rank of colonel, and two additional majors were authorized. Eventually in March 1865 Congress formally recognized wartime requirements by authorizing a chief CS with the rank of colonel for each field army, military department and division, and principle subsistence depot; an assistant CS with the rank of colonel assigned to Washington; up to six CS with the rank of lieutenant colonel to serve as inspectors or special duty assignment; a chief CS with the rank of lieutenant colonel for each army corps; and a CS with the rank of major for each division.

The need to fill CS positions among the field units primarily came from volunteer officers or regular officers detailed to the duty, and by the end of the war there were 535 commissaries of subsistence of volunteers, bringing the total complement of officers in the department to 564. Although educating them in the principles of their duty was a constant problem, it was a minor one eventually fixed with time and experience, and those who could not meet the standards of the department were relieved of duty.

During the war the principle subsistence depots and purchasing offices were located in Baltimore, Boston, Chicago, Cincinnati, Louisville, Philadelphia, St. Louis, San Francisco and Washington, D.C. Depot commissaries, assisted by civilian clerks and laborers, received purchases in bulk at these locations and repackaged them for shipment to armies in the field. The actual transportation of rations was handled by the Quartermaster Department, requiring close cooperation between the two. Major beef depots were also established in Alexandria, Virginia, Louisville and Washington. During the war the department developed a highly effective system of base, advanced, and temporary depots, and mobile beef herds which followed behind Union forces in the field.

The success of the Subsistence Department in meeting the challenges of the war was noted by Secretary Stanton, who observed in 1865 that no operation conducted by the Union army failed on account of the department being unable to meet its obligations. In total, the department purchased over $361 million in foodstuff and miscellaneous subsistence items from July 1, 1861, to June 30, 1865. The vast quantities of items managed by the department included over 504 million pounds of hardtack, 223 million pounds of bacon, 200 million pounds of brown sugar, 106 million pounds of fresh beef, 64 million pounds of roasted coffee and more than 322,000 live beef cattle.

;Leadership
At the Civil War&#x27;s start, the CGS was George Gibson. Gibson, who at eighty-six was the oldest serving officer in the army, had been in this position since the department was first created in April 1818 and as such was responsible for establishing its procurement and distribution methods. When he died on September 29, 1861, he was succeeded by his deputy, Joseph Pannell Taylor. Taylor oversaw the department&#x27;s expansion during the most eventful years of its history and served until his death on June 29, 1864. The senior assistant CGS Amos Beebe Eaton was promoted to the position upon Taylor&#x27;s death and served as CGS for the rest of the war.

==Military tactics==
The tactics of the Union army, as with their Confederate opponents, was derived from traditions developed in Europe around the use of smoothbore muskets: soldiers marching shoulder-to-shoulder in lines, columns and other formations in order to deliver volley fire on the enemy. The most notable development though was the widespread use of rifled muskets, which had an effective range of 500 yards versus the smoothbore&#x27;s 100 yards. This led to predictions the defense would have the advantage over an attacker and render such linear tactics obsolete, which many contemporaries and early historians echoed. More recently, historians have questioned this narrative and argued based on research that most combat still took place at the range of smoothbore muskets and casualty rates were little different from during the Napoleonic Wars. Instead they assert these tactics still remained relevant during the Civil War.

In the first stage of an attack, preparatory fire would be carried out by field artillery and skirmishers. When possible a flanking maneuver was preferred, but if necessary a frontal assault was conducted, with feints to draw off the enemy&#x27;s attention. Successive lines of infantry would advance on the enemy at a walking pace until the first line got to within 200 yards or less, whereupon (ideally) they broke into a charge to overrun the enemy&#x27;s position, stopping only once to fire a volley. If successful the first line would regroup in place as the succeeding lines pass through to attack the next position; if they became bogged down or forced to retreat, the next line would pass through to continue the attack. More likely, the attackers stopped within 100 yards of the enemy and begin exchanging fire with them until using up their ammunition and either be driven off or press home with a bayonet charge.

Fieldworks were used extensively on the defensive thanks to the teachings of Dennis Hart Mahan at West Point. Even when not conducting a siege, such defensive fortifications would be constructed if time allowed. Examples included rifle pits, abatises, wire obstacles, land mines, and palisades. Truly impressive trench systems could be constructed thanks to the widespread use of Black laborers. If field fortifications were not available, the main defensive line would be formed around a strong terrain feature (stone wall, embankment, etc.) which ideally allowed for flanking fire. Supporting lines were placed behind the main line, on a hill overlooking it if possible but otherwise providing a ready reserve. Counter-battery fire would attempt to knock out the enemy&#x27;s artillery while skirmishers harassed the attacker as they advanced. Once within range, the defending infantry attempted to drive off the enemy with superior firepower or, if timed right, a counter-charge of their own.

Union cavalry were rarely used in actual battle in the first years of the war, instead being parceled out on scouting and raiding missions and often at a disadvantage against their Confederate counterparts. Under energetic commanders like Philip Sheridan however the Union cavalry grew into its own and developed tactics unique from their European counterparts. Instead of masses of heavy cavalry charging enemy infantry, a cavalry force would leave a portion of its troopers mounted while the rest dismounted to engage the enemy in a firefight. The widespread employment of repeating firearms gave Union cavalry a particular advantage, especially when utilizing marching fire. If the firefight did not achieve success, the dismounted portion could clear any obstacles to allow the mounted portion to charge with revolvers and sabers, and if not successful the force could remount and use their mobility to attack from another direction. In this way an enemy could be defeated in detail as these successive attacks forced them to spread out and allowed isolated elements to eventually be overwhelmed.

==Desertions and draft riots==
Desertion was a major problem for both sides. The daily hardships of war, forced marches, thirst, suffocating heat, disease, delay in pay, solicitude for family, impatience at the monotony and futility of inactive service, panic on the eve of battle, the sense of war-weariness, the lack of confidence in commanders, and the discouragement of defeat (especially early on for the Union army), all tended to lower the morale of the Union army and to increase desertion.

In 1861 and 1862, the war was going badly for the Union army and there were, by some counts, 180,000 desertions. In 1863 and 1864, the bitterest two years of the war, the Union army suffered over 200 desertions every day, for a total of 150,000 desertions during those two years. This puts the total number of desertions from the Union army during the four years of the war at nearly 350,000. Using these numbers, 15% of Union soldiers deserted during the war. Official numbers put the number of deserters from the Union army at 200,000 for the entire war, or about 8% of Union army soldiers. Since desertion is defined as being AWOL for 30 or more days and some soldiers returned within that time period, as well as some deserters being labeled missing-in-action or vice versa, accurate counts are difficult to determine. Many historians estimate the &quot;real&quot; desertion rate in the Union army as between 9–12%. About 1 out of 3 deserters returned to their regiments, either voluntarily or after being arrested and being sent back. Many deserters were professional &quot;bounty jumpers&quot; who would enlist to collect the cash bonus and then desert to do the same elsewhere. If not caught and executed, this crime could pay well.

Irish immigrants were the main participants in the famous &quot;New York Draft riots&quot; of 1863. Stirred up by the instigating rhetoric of Democratic politicians, the Irish had shown the strongest support for Southern aims prior to the start of the war and had long opposed abolitionism and the free black population, regarding them as competition for jobs and blaming them for driving down wages. Alleging that the war was merely an upper-class abolitionist war to free slaves who might move north and compete for jobs and housing, the poorer classes did not welcome a draft, especially one from which a richer man could buy an exemption. The poor formed clubs that would buy exemptions for their unlucky members. As a result of the Enrollment Act, rioting began in several Northern cities, the most heavily hit being New York City. A mob reported as consisting principally of Irish immigrants rioted in the summer of 1863, with the worst violence occurring in July during the Battle of Gettysburg. The mob set fire to African American churches and the Colored Orphan Asylum as well as the homes of prominent Protestant abolitionists. A mob was reportedly repulsed from the offices of the staunchly pro-Union &quot;New York Tribune&quot; by workers firing two Gatling guns. The principal victims of the rioting were African Americans and activists in the anti-slavery movement. Not until victory was achieved at Gettysburg could the Union army be sent in; some units had to open fire to quell the violence and stop the rioters. Casualties were estimated as up to 1,000 killed or wounded. There were a few small scale draft riots in rural areas of the Midwest and in the coal regions of Pennsylvania.

<text>This is a list of notable conspiracy theories. Many conspiracy theories relate to supposed clandestine government plans and elaborate murder plots. They usually deny consensus opinion and cannot be proven using historical or scientific methods, and are not to be confused with research concerning verified conspiracies, such as Germany&#x27;s pretense for invading Poland in World War II.

In principle, conspiracy theories might not always be false, and their validity depends on evidence as for any theory. However, they are often implausible &quot;prima facie&quot; due to their convoluted and all-encompassing nature. Conspiracy theories tend to be internally consistent and correlate with each other; they are generally designed to resist falsification either by evidence against them or a lack of evidence for them.

Psychologists sometimes attribute proclivities toward conspiracy theories to a number of psychopathological conditions such as paranoia, schizotypy, narcissism, and insecure attachment, or to a form of cognitive bias called &quot;illusory pattern perception&quot;. However, the current scientific consensus holds that most conspiracy theorists are not pathological, but merely exaggerate certain cognitive tendencies that are universal in the human brain and probably have deep evolutionary origins, such as natural inclinations towards anxiety and agent detection.

== Aviation ==
Numerous conspiracy theories pertain to air travel and aircraft. Incidents such as the 1955 bombing of the Kashmir Princess, the 1985 Arrow Air Flight 1285 crash, the 1986 Mozambican Tupolev Tu-134 crash, the 1987 Helderberg Disaster, the 1988 bombing of Pan Am Flight 103 and the 1994 Mull of Kintyre helicopter crash as well as various aircraft technologies and alleged sightings, have all spawned theories of foul play that deviate from official verdicts.

=== Black helicopters ===

This conspiracy theory emerged in the US in the 1960s. The John Birch Society originally promoted it, asserting that a United Nations force would soon arrive in black helicopters to bring the US under UN control. A similar theory concerning so-called &quot;phantom helicopters&quot; appeared in the UK in the 1970s. The theory re-emerged in the 1990s during the presidency of Bill Clinton, and was &quot;energetically&quot; promoted by writer Jim Keith in his book &quot;Black Helicopters Over America&quot;. By the 2000s, the term &quot;black helicopters&quot; became a shorthand for anti-government conspiracy theories that &quot;stretch the bounds of credulity&quot;, such as those espoused by militia groups and a number of guests of talk show host Glenn Beck.

=== Chemtrails ===

Also known as SLAP (Secret Large-scale Atmospheric Program), this theory alleges that water condensation trails (&quot;contrails&quot;) from aircraft consist of chemical or biological agents, or contain a supposedly toxic mix of aluminum, strontium and barium, under secret government policies. An estimated 17% of people globally believe the theory to be true or partly true. In 2016, the Carnegie Institution for Science published the first-ever peer-reviewed study of the chemtrail theory; 76 out of 77 participating atmospheric chemists and geochemists stated that they had seen no evidence to support the chemtrail theory, or stated that chemtrail theorists rely on poor sampling.

=== Korean Air Lines Flight 007 ===
The destruction of Korean Air Lines Flight 007 by Soviet jets in 1983 has long drawn the interest of conspiracy theorists. The theories range from allegations of a planned espionage mission, to a US government cover-up, to the consumption of the passengers&#x27; remains by giant crabs.

=== Malaysia Airlines Flight MH370 ===

The disappearance of Malaysia Airlines Flight 370 in southeast Asia in March 2014 has prompted many theories. One theory suggests that this plane was hidden away and reintroduced as Flight MH17 later the same year in order to be shot down over Ukraine for political purposes. American conspiracy theorist James H. Fetzer has placed responsibility for the disappearance with the then Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu. Historian Norman Davies has promoted the conspiracy theory that hackers remotely took over a Boeing Uninterruptible Autopilot, supposedly installed on board, remotely piloting the aircraft to Antarctica.

=== Malaysia Airlines Flight MH17 ===
Malaysia Airlines Flight 17 was shot down over Ukraine in July 2014. This event has spawned numerous alternative theories. These variously include allegations that it was secretly Flight MH370, that the plane was actually shot down by the Ukrainian Air Force to frame Russia, that it was part of a conspiracy to conceal the &quot;truth&quot; about HIV (seven disease specialists were on board), or that the Illuminati or Israel was responsible.

== Business and industry ==
===&quot;Deepwater Horizon&quot;===
Multiple conspiracy theories pertain to a fatal oil-rig industrial accident in 2010 in the Gulf of Mexico, alleging sabotage by those seeking to promote environmentalism, or a strike by North Korean or Russian submarines. Elements of such theories had been suggested or promoted by US radio host Rush Limbaugh.

=== New Coke ===

A theory claims that the Coca-Cola Company intentionally changed to an inferior formula with New Coke, with the intent either of driving up demand for the original product or permitting the reintroduction of the original with a new formula using cheaper ingredients. Coca-Cola president Donald Keough rebutted this charge: &quot;The truth is, we&#x27;re not that dumb, and we&#x27;re not that smart.&quot;

== Deaths and disappearances ==

===Death of Nero===
In ancient times, widespread conspiracy theories were circulated pertaining to the death of the Roman emperor Nero, who committed suicide in 68 AD. Some of these theories claimed that Nero had actually faked his death and was secretly still alive, but in hiding, plotting to reestablish his reign. In most of these stories, he was said to have fled to the East, where he was still influential. Other theories held that Nero would return from the dead to retake his throne. Many early Christians feared Nero&#x27;s return to resume his vicious anti-Christian persecutions. The Book of Revelation may allude to these conspiracy theories in its description of the slaughtered head returned to life.

===John F. Kennedy assassination===


In modern times, multiple conspiracy theories concerning the assassination of John F. Kennedy in 1963 have emerged. Vincent Bugliosi estimated that over 1,000 books had been written about the Kennedy assassination, at least ninety percent of which are works supporting the view that there was a conspiracy. As a result of this, the Kennedy assassination has been described as &quot;the mother of all conspiracies&quot;. The countless individuals and organizations that have been accused of involvement in the Kennedy assassination include the CIA, the Mafia, sitting Vice President Lyndon B. Johnson, Cuban Prime Minister Fidel Castro, the KGB, or even some combination thereof. It is also frequently asserted that the United States federal government intentionally covered up crucial information in the aftermath of the assassination to prevent the conspiracy from being discovered.

===Disappearance of Harold Holt===
At approximately 12:20pm on 17 December 1967, then–Prime Minister of Australia Harold Holt, disappeared while swimming at Cheviot Beach, near the town of Portsea in Victoria. While it is presumed that Holt drowned, the topic is still described as one of the biggest unsolved mysteries in Australian history and has spawned many conspiracy theories. The conspiracy theories have been widely criticised by the public and by members of Holt&#x27;s own family.

In 2007, television presenter Ray Martin hosted the television special &quot;Who Killed Harold Holt?&quot;, which first aired on the Nine Network on 20 November 2007. While the special explored numerous theories about Holt&#x27;s disappearance, it gave particular credence to the theory that he committed suicide. In the lead-up to the airing of the program, Holt&#x27;s biographer, Tom Frame, described the allegations made in the special as &quot;unjustified and contrary to all the evidence&quot; in an opinion piece published in &quot;The Australian&quot; newspaper, while Holt&#x27;s son, Sam, said he was &quot;amazed that people can still keep bringing up [these] fallacious theories&quot;.

Another conspiracy theory is that Holt was actually a spy for the Chinese government (under both the Nationalist and Communist governments) ever since he began studying at the University of Melbourne in 1929 and that he &quot;pretended to drown&quot;, instead theorising that once below the surface two Chinese frogmen transported him to China in a submarine. This theory also claims that the Australian Security Intelligence Organisation (ASIO) covered up any evidence. This theory was first promoted in British writer Anthony Grey&#x27;s 1983 novel &quot;The Prime Minister Was a Spy&quot;, which attracted controversy in Australia. Other conspiracy theories claim that Holt was assassinated. Targets of these claims include North Vietnam and the US Central Intelligence Agency (CIA).

===Death of other prominent figures===
The deaths of prominent figures of all types attract conspiracy theorists, sometimes elaborating on historically verified conspiracies such as the assassination of US President Abraham Lincoln, as well as the deaths of Martin Luther King Jr., Mustafa Kemal Atatürk, Eric V of Denmark, Dmitry Ivanovich, Sheikh Rahman, Yitzhak Rabin, Zachary Taylor, George S. Patton, Diana, Princess of Wales, Dag Hammarskjöld, Kurt Cobain, Michael Jackson, Marilyn Monroe, Tupac Shakur, Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart, John Lennon, Jimi Hendrix, the Notorious B.I.G., Pope John Paul I, Jill Dando, Olof Palme, Linkin Park member Chester Bennington, Paul Walker, biological warfare authority David Kelly, Haitian president Jovenel Moïse, Indian freedom fighter Subhas Chandra Bose, and Bollywood star Sushant Singh Rajput.

There are also claims that deaths were covered up. Such theories include the &quot;Paul is dead&quot; claim alleging that Paul McCartney died in a car accident in 1966 and was replaced by a look-alike Scottish orphan named William Shears Campbell who also went by Billy Shears, and that the Beatles hinted at this in their songs, most noticeably &quot;Revolution 9&quot;, &quot;Strawberry Fields Forever&quot;, &quot;Glass Onion&quot;, and &quot;I Am the Walrus&quot;, as well on the covers of &quot;Abbey Road&quot;, &quot;Sgt. Pepper&#x27;s Lonely Hearts Club Band&quot;, and &quot;Magical Mystery Tour&quot;. Another is the conspiracy theory, widely circulated in Nigeria, which alleges that Nigerian president Muhammadu Buhari died in 2017 and was replaced by a look-alike Sudanese impostor. Many fans of punk-pop star Avril Lavigne claim that she died at the height of her fame and was replaced by a look-alike named Melissa. The Melania Trump replacement theory proposes the same of the former US First Lady.

Inverted theories concerning deaths are also known, prominently claims that Elvis Presley&#x27;s death was faked and that Adolf Hitler survived the Second World War and fled to the Americas, to Antarctica, or to the Moon. Theories that Hitler had survived are known to have been deliberately promoted by the government of the Soviet Union under Joseph Stalin as part of a disinformation campaign.

The disappearance, and often presumed death, of an individual may also become a cause for conspiracy theorists. Theories of a cover-up surrounding the 1974 disappearance of Lord Lucan following the murder of his family&#x27;s nanny include, for example, allegations of a suicide plot whereby his body was fed to tigers at Howletts Zoo. Numerous conspiracy theories have also attended the 2007 disappearance of English girl Madeleine McCann.

The murder of Democratic National Committee employee Seth Rich spawned several right-wing conspiracy theories, including that Rich had been involved with the leaked DNC emails in 2016, which runs contrary to US intelligence&#x27;s conclusion that the leaked DNC emails were part of Russian interference in the 2016 United States elections. Law enforcement as well as fact-checking websites like PolitiFact.com, Snopes.com, and FactCheck.org stated that these theories were false and unfounded. &quot;The New York Times&quot;, &quot;Los Angeles Times&quot;, and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; called the fabrications fake news and falsehoods.

== Economics and society ==
=== New World Order ===

The New World Order theory states that a group of international elites control governments, industry, and media organizations, with the goal of establishing global hegemony. They are alleged to be implicated in most of the major wars of the last two centuries, to carry out secretly staged events, and to deliberately manipulate economies.

The New World Order has been connected to a wide range of actors including the Illuminati (see ), Jews (), colluding world governments or corporations, NGOs such as the World Economic Forum (), and secretive organizations such as Bohemian Grove, Le Cercle, and Skull and Bones. Theorists believe that a wide range of musicians, including Beyoncé and Whitney Houston, have been associated with the &quot;group&quot;. Prominent theorists include Mark Dice and David Icke.

=== Predictive programming ===

Many theorists allege that the contents of fictional media, in a process called &quot;predictive programming&quot;, are manipulated to reference planned false flags, technological innovations, social changes, and other future events. These references are understood to be a conditioning and brainwashing tool, such that the public becomes more accepting of these events than they would be otherwise. Predictive programming has been used to explain events such as the September 11 attacks and COVID-19 pandemic, and has been connected with media such as &quot;Die Hard&quot;, &quot;The Simpsons&quot;, and &quot;Contagion&quot;.

=== George Soros ===

Hungarian-American investor George Soros has been the subject of conspiracy theories since the 1990s. Soros has used his wealth to promote many political, social, educational and scientific causes, disbursing grants totaling an estimated $11 billion up to 2016. However, theories tend to assert that Soros is in control of a large portion of the world&#x27;s wealth and governments, and that he secretly funds a large range of persons and organizations for nefarious purposes, such as antifa, which some conspiracy theorists claim is a single far-left militant group. Such ideas have been promoted by Viktor Orbán, Donald Trump, Rudy Giuliani, Joseph diGenova, Bill O&#x27;Reilly, Roy Moore, Alex Jones, Paul Gosar, and Ben Garrison. Soros conspiracy theories are sometimes linked to antisemitic conspiracy theories.

=== Freemasonry ===
Conspiracy theories concerning the Freemasons have proliferated since the 18th century. Theorists have alleged that Freemasons control large parts of the economies or judiciaries of a number of countries, and have alleged Masonic involvement in the British enquiry regarding the sinking of the &quot;Titanic&quot; and in the crimes of Jack the Ripper. Notable among theorists has been American inventor Samuel Morse, who in 1835 published a book of his own conspiracy theories. Freemason conspiracy theories have also been linked to certain antisemitic conspiracy theories.

=== &quot;Üst akıl&quot; ===
Conspiracy theories in Turkey started to dominate public discourse during the late reign of the Justice and Development Party and Recep Tayyip Erdoğan. In 2014, Erdoğan coined the term &quot;üst akıl&quot; (&quot;mastermind&quot;) to denote the alleged command and control institution, somewhat ambiguously placed with the government of the United States, in a comprehensive conspiracy to weaken or even dismember Turkey, by orchestrating every political actor and action perceived hostile by Turkey. Erdoğan as well as the &quot;Daily Sabah&quot; newspaper have on multiple occasions alleged that very different non-state actors—like the Salafi jihadist Islamic State of Iraq and the Levant (ISIL), the libertarian socialist Kurdistan Workers&#x27; Party (PKK) and supporters of Fethullah Gülen—were attacking Turkey at the same time in a well-coordinated campaign.

One instance of promoting the &quot;mastermind&quot; conspiracy theory occurred in February 2017, when then-Ankara Mayor Melih Gökçek claimed that earthquakes in the western province of Çanakkale could have been organized by dark external powers aiming to destroy Turkey&#x27;s economy with an &quot;artificial earthquake&quot; near Istanbul. In another example, in November 2017, the Islamist newspaper &quot;Yeni Akit&quot; claimed that the fashion trend of &quot;ripped denim&quot; jeans was in fact a means of communication, via specific forms of rips and holes, between agents of foreign states and their collaborators in Turkey.

== Espionage ==
=== Israel animal spying ===

There are conspiracy theories alleging that Israel uses animals to conduct espionage or to attack people. These are often associated with conspiracy theories about Zionism. Matters of interest to theorists include a series of shark attacks in Egypt in 2010, Hezbollah&#x27;s accusations of the use of &quot;spying&quot; eagles, and the 2011 capture of a griffon vulture carrying an Israeli-labeled satellite tracking device.

=== Harold Wilson ===
Numerous persons, including former MI5 officer Peter Wright and Soviet defector Anatoliy Golitsyn, have alleged that British Prime Minister Harold Wilson was secretly a KGB spy. Historian Christopher Andrew has lamented that a number of people have been &quot;seduced by Golitsyn&#x27;s fantasies&quot;.

=== Malala Yousafzai ===
Conspiracy theories concerning Malala Yousafzai are widespread in Pakistan, elements of which originate from a 2013 satirical piece in &quot;Dawn&quot;. These theories variously allege that she is a Western spy, or that her attempted murder by the Taliban in 2012 was a secret operation to further discredit the Taliban, and was organized by her father and the CIA and carried out by actor Robert de Niro disguised as an Uzbek homeopath.

== Ethnicity, race and religion ==
=== Antisemitism ===

Since at least the Middle Ages, antisemitism has featured elements of conspiracy theory. In medieval Europe it was widely believed that Jews poisoned wells, had been responsible for the death of Jesus, and ritually consumed the blood of Christians. The second half of the 19th century saw the emergence of notions that Jews and/or Freemasons were plotting to establish control over the world. Forged evidence has been presented to spread the notion that Jews were responsible for the propagation of communism, or the hoax &quot;The Protocols of the Elders of Zion&quot; (1903), which outlines a supposed high council of Jews planning to control the world. Such antisemitic conspiracy theories became central to the worldview of Adolf Hitler. Antisemitic theories persist today concerning banking, Hollywood, the news media and a purported Zionist Occupation Government of the United States. These theories all allege plots to establish a world tyranny.

Holocaust denial is also considered an antisemitic conspiracy theory, claiming that the Nazi extermination of European Jews is a hoax designed to win sympathy for Jews and justify the creation of the State of Israel. Holocaust deniers include Iranian President Mahmoud Ahmedinejad, the chemist with a conviction for inciting racial hatred Germar Rudolf and the discredited author David Irving.

Reptilian conspiracies, prominent in ufology theories, have also been linked to anti-semitism, as &quot;a very old trope with disturbing links to anti-immigrant and antisemitic hostilities dating to the 19th century.&quot; Conspiracy author David Icke suggests numerous Jewish political figures are reptilian shapeshifters and &quot;the Jewish Rothschild family is part of a bloodline of reptilian humanoids that secretly control the world&quot;. Critics contend these theories to be antisemitic, although he denies animosity towards Jewish people. Other far-right ufologists speculate that the Jewish race originated from genetic engineering by malevolent extraterrestrials engaged in interstellar conflict with Anunnaki or Pleiadians.

=== Anti-Armenianism ===

Conspiracy theories that allege that the Armenians wield secret political power are prevalent in Azerbaijan and have been promoted by the government, including President Ilham Aliyev. Turkish Foreign Minister Mevlüt Çavuşoğlu has claimed that the Russian media is run by Armenians. American writer and disbarred lawyer Samuel Weems has claimed that the Armenian genocide was a hoax designed to defraud Christian nations of billions of dollars, and that the Armenian Church instigates terrorist attacks. Filmmaker Davud Imanov has accused the Armenians of plotting against Azerbaijan and has claimed that the Karabakh movement was a plot by the CIA to destroy the Soviet Union.

=== Anti-Baháʼísm ===

Iran&#x27;s Baháʼí Faith minority has been the target of conspiracy theories alleging involvement with hostile powers. Iranian government officials and others have claimed that Baháʼís have been variously agents of the Russian, British, American or Israeli governments. An apocryphal and historically inaccurate book published in Iran, entitled &quot;The Memoirs of Count Dolgoruki&quot;, details a theory that the Bahá&#x27;ís intend to destroy Islam. Such anti-Baháʼí accusations have been dismissed as having no factual foundation.

=== Anti-Catholicism ===

Since the Protestant Reformation of the 16th century, theories about Catholic conspiracies have taken many forms, including the 17th-century Popish Plot allegations, claims by persons such as William Blackstone that Catholics posed a secret threat to Britain, and numerous writings by authors such as Samuel Morse, Rebecca Reed, Avro Manhattan, Jack Chick and Alberto Rivera. Theorists often claim that the Pope is the Antichrist, accuse Catholics of suppressing evidence incompatible with Church teachings, and describe Catholics as being involved with secret evil rituals, crimes, and other plots.

In 1853, the Scottish minister Alexander Hislop published his anti-Catholic pamphlet &quot;The Two Babylons&quot;, in which he claims that the Catholic Church is secretly a continuation of the pagan religion of ancient Babylon, the product of a millennia-old conspiracy founded by the Biblical king Nimrod and the Assyrian queen Semiramis. It also claims that modern Catholic holidays, including Christmas and Easter, are actually pagan festivals established by Semiramis and that the customs associated with them are pagan rituals. Modern scholars have unanimously rejected the book&#x27;s arguments as erroneous and based on a flawed understanding of Babylonian religion, but variations of them are still accepted among some groups of evangelical Protestants. The Jehovah&#x27;s Witnesses periodical &quot;The Watchtower&quot; frequently published excerpts from it until the 1980s. The book&#x27;s thesis has also featured prominently in the conspiracy theories of racist groups, such as The Covenant, The Sword, and the Arm of the Lord.

Fears of a Catholic takeover of the US have been especially persistent, prompted by large-scale Catholic immigration in the 19th century and Ku Klux Klan propaganda. Such fears have attached to Catholic political candidates such as Al Smith and John F. Kennedy. Pope John Paul I died in September 1978, only a month after his election to the papacy. The timing of his death and the Vatican&#x27;s alleged difficulties with ceremonial and legal death procedures has fostered several conspiracy theories. The elderly Pope Benedict XVI&#x27;s resignation in February 2013, officially due to &quot;lack of strength of mind and body&quot;, prompted theories in Italian publications such as and &quot;Panorama&quot; that he resigned to avoid the exposure of an underground gay Catholic network.

=== Antichrist ===
Apocalyptic prophecies, particularly Christian claims about the end times, have inspired a range of conspiracy theories. Many of these cite the Antichrist, a leader who will supposedly create an oppressive world empire. Countless figures have been called Antichrist, including Holy Roman Emperor Frederick II, Russian emperor Peter the Great, Saladin, Pope John XXII, Benito Mussolini, Barack Obama, French Emperor Napoleon Bonaparte, and German Führer Adolf Hitler.

=== Bible and Jesus ===
Bible conspiracy theories posit that significant parts of the New Testament are false, or have been omitted. Various groups both real (such as the Vatican) and fake (such as the Priory of Sion) are said to suppress relevant information concerning, for example, the dating of the Shroud of Turin. Much of this line of conspiracy theory has been stimulated by a debunked book titled &quot;The Holy Blood and the Holy Grail&quot; (1982), which claimed that Jesus and Mary Magdalene were lovers and that their offspring and descendants were secretly hidden in Europe following the death of Jesus, from whom the then-living French draughtsman Pierre Plantard claimed descent. Interest in this hoax saw a resurgence following the publication of Dan Brown&#x27;s 2003 novel &quot;The Da Vinci Code&quot;. &quot;The Gospel of Afranius&quot;, an atheistic Russian work published in 1995 with an English translation published in 2022, proposes politically motivated gaslighting as the origin of the foundational Christian belief in the resurrection of Jesus.

=== Islamist ===
&quot;War against Islam&quot; is a conspiracy theory in Islamist discourse that describes a plot to destroy Islamic society. The alleged plotters are non-Muslims and &quot;false Muslims&quot; in collusion with Western powers whose efforts are a continuation of the Medieval Crusades.

===Anti-Islamic===
Since the September 11 Attacks, many anti-Islamic conspiracy theories have emerged. Love Jihad, also called Romeo Jihad, refers to a conspiracy theory that Muslim men try to convert non-Muslim women to Islam by feigning love. The &quot;Eurabia&quot; theory alleges a Muslim plot to Islamize Europe and the West through mass immigration and high birth rates. US President Barack Obama was accused of being a secret Muslim.

=== Paganism ===

It&#x27;s speculated that the witch trials of the Early Modern period were an effort to suppress pre-Christian, pagan religions that had endured the Christianization of Europe. Some far right conspiracy theorists suggests that Christianity was created as a Jewish agenda to undermine the Aryan race, which is thought to have initially led to the fall of Rome.

During the 1930s and 1940s, Neo-Pagan Heinrich Himmler organized a branch of the SS to do an extensive survey of witch-hunt trial records across Europe, with the intention to use it as anti-Christian propaganda by claiming the inquisition had been a repression of an indigenous &quot;Völkisch&quot; Norse-Germanic nature religion, and using it as evidence for reconstructing that religion.

=== Paul the Apostle ===
Paul the Apostle makes an appearance in some variants of the medieval Jewish anti-Christian polemic, &quot;Toledot Yeshu&quot;, as a spy for the rabbis. Muslims have long believed that Paul purposefully corrupted the original revealed teachings of Jesus by introducing elements of paganism, the theology of the cross, and the idea of original sin producing the need for redemption. The Baháʼí Faith also regards Paul as a false or misguided preacher who corrupted Jesus&#x27;s original message. In this sense, he is seen as the real &quot;Judas&quot; who betrayed Jesus.

=== Pre-Māori settlement of New Zealand ===
=== Racism ===
White genocide conspiracy theory is a white nationalist notion that immigration, integration, low fertility rates and abortion are being promoted in predominantly white countries to dispossess or eliminate white people. A 2017 study in France by IFOP, for example, found that 48% of participants believed that political and media elites are conspiring to replace white people with immigrants.

The idea of Black genocide in the United States holds that African Americans are the victims of genocide by white Americans. Arguments for its existence have focused on historical persecution of African Americans through lynchings, racial discrimination, and forced sterilization. Some accusations of genocide have been described as conspiracy theories, in particular the characterization of birth control and medical abortions as part of a deliberate and ongoing genocide of African Americans.

&quot;The Plan&quot; is an alleged plot by white power brokers in Washington, D.C., to take control of the city&#x27;s local government from African Americans, who were a majority of the city&#x27;s population from the late 1950s to the early 2010s and remain its largest ethnic group. While most residents, of any race, do not believe in an intentional plan to move or displace black people, many still feel that gentrification, urban renewal projects and the demolition of black neighborhoods have contributed (intentionally or otherwise) to Washington&#x27;s changing demographics.

== Fandom, celebrity relationships, and shipping ==
Numerous conspiracy theories surround the desire by followers of a fandom for two celebrities to be in a romantic and/or sexual relationship, known as shipping. Many real-person shipping conspiracy theories involve claims that the pregnancies and children of partnered or married celebrity couples are fake. Proponents of celebrity shipping conspiracies that ship two celebrities of the same gender typically argue that they are being pro-LGBT by supporting two people who are forcibly closeted by a homophobic industry.
Conspiracy communities about celebrity relationships tend to be created and dominated by women.

=== Larries ===

Larries are a group of shipping conspiracy theorist fans, centered around the idea that two members of the boy band One Direction, Harry Styles and Louis Tomlinson, are secretly a couple. These conspiracy theorists falsely claim that Styles and Tomlinson have been closeted by their management since the inception of the band, despite multiple claims otherwise by Styles, Tomlinson, their friends, and their family.

== Government, politics, and conflict ==

In the modern era, political conspiracy theories are often spread using fake news on social media. A 2017 study of fake news, which was published by the Shorenstein Center, found that &quot;misinformation is currently predominantly a pathology of the right&quot;. Political conspiracy theories may take generalized and wide-ranging forms concerning wars and international bodies, but may also be seen at a localized level, such as the conspiracy theory pertaining to the 118th Battalion, a British regiment stationed in Kitchener, Ontario, during World War I, which was believed by some in Kitchener to still be present years after the war ended and to be controlling local politics.

===BlueAnon===
BlueAnon is a set of loosely related left-wing conspiracy theories that suggest Donald Trump is engaged in elaborate plots to capture or maintain control of the United States Government.

=== Crisis actors ===

Crisis actors are individuals who portray disaster victims in first responder training exercises. Conspiracy theories allege that mass shooting and similar traumatic events are actually staged, with victims and their families being portrayed by covert crisis actors.

=== Illuminati in Europe ===
Conspiracy theories concerning the Illuminati, a short-lived 18th-century Enlightenment-era secret society, appear to have originated in the late 19th century, when some Catholic conservatives in Europe came to believe that the group had been responsible for the French Revolution of 1789–1799. Hoaxes about the Illuminati were later spread in the 1960s by a group of American practical jokers known as the Discordians who wrote a series of fake letters about the Illuminati to &quot;Playboy&quot;.

=== False flag operations ===
False flag operations are covert operations designed to appear as if they are being carried out by other entities. Some allegations of false flag operations have been verified or are subjects of legitimate historical dispute (such as the 1933 Reichstag arson attack). Unsubstantiated allegations of such operations feature strongly in conspiracy theories.

Such allegations have attached to the bombing of Pearl Harbor, the Oklahoma City bombing, the 2004 Madrid train bombings, the 1964 Gulf of Tonkin incident, and the Euromaidan massacre. The rise of ISIS gave rise to conspiracy theories that it had been created by the US, CIA, Mossad, or Hillary Clinton. The same happened after the rise of Boko Haram.

=== 9/11 2001 attack on United States===
The attacks on the US by terrorists using hijacked aircraft on 11 September 2001 have proved attractive to conspiracy theorists. Theories may include reference to missile or hologram technology. The most common theory is that the Twin Towers collapsed in controlled demolitions, a theory rejected by the engineering profession and the 9/11 Commission.

=== Sandy Hook school shooting in US 2012===

A 2012 fatal mass shooting at Sandy Hook Elementary School in Newtown, Connecticut, prompted numerous conspiracy theories, among them the claim that it was a staged to promote gun control. Former Ku Klux Klan leader David Duke blamed Zionist deception. Theorists such as Alex Jones have suggested that the event was staged with actors. Harassment of the bereaved families by conspiracy theorists has resulted in actions for defamation. Rush Limbaugh stated that the Mayan Calendar phenomenon drove the shooter Adam Lanza.

=== Clintons ===

The Clinton body count conspiracy theory, notably advanced by Newsmax publisher Christopher Ruddy, asserts that US President Bill Clinton and his wife Hillary Clinton have assassinated fifty or more of their associates and enemies. Such accusations have been around at least since the 1990s, when a pseudo-documentary film called &quot;The Clinton Chronicles&quot;, produced by Larry Nichols and promoted by Rev. Jerry Falwell, accused Bill Clinton of multiple crimes including murder.

=== Jeffrey Epstein death conspiracy theories ===

The 2019 death of Jeffrey Epstein, an American financier billionaire and convicted sex offender with ties to Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, and other members of the elite, has become the subject of conspiracy theories.

=== 2017 Las Vegas shooting conspiracy theories ===

The 2017 Las Vegas shooting, the deadliest mass shooting in modern U.S. history, has sparked numerous conspiracy theories. Some theorists suggest the use of a machine gun rather than semi-automatic weapons, claiming the rapid fire heard in videos indicates automatic gunfire. Others allege government involvement, speculating that the incident was orchestrated to justify banning bump stocks, devices that enable semi-automatic rifles to fire more rapidly. Additionally, there are theories about multiple shooters, fueled by eyewitness accounts and video evidence that purportedly show gunfire from different locations. Despite extensive investigations debunking these claims, they continue to circulate in various conspiracy theory communities.

=== FEMA ===

The United States&#x27;s Federal Emergency Management Agency is the subject of many theories, including that the organization has been building concentration camps in the US to prepare for imposing martial law and genocide.

=== African National Congress ===
Members of South Africa&#x27;s African National Congress party have long propagated conspiracy theories, frequently concerning the CIA and alleged white supremacists. In 2014, Deputy Minister of Defence Kebby Maphatsoe joined others in accusing without evidence Public Protector Thuli Madonsela of being a US agent working to create a puppet government in South Africa.

=== Barack Obama ===

Barack Obama has been the subject of numerous conspiracy theories. His presidency was the subject of a 2009 film, &quot;The Obama Deception&quot;, by Alex Jones, which alleged that Obama&#x27;s administration was a puppet government for a wealthy elite. The &quot;birther&quot; theory, which came to prominence in 2009, denies the legitimacy of Obama&#x27;s presidency by claiming that he was not born in the US. This theory has persisted despite his Hawaiian birth certificate and birth announcements in two Hawaiian newspapers in 1961. Notable promoters of the theory are dentist-lawyer Orly Taitz and President Donald Trump, who has since publicly acknowledged its falsity but is said to continue to advocate for it privately. Other theories claim that Obama, a Protestant Christian, is secretly a Muslim.

A pair of fatal attacks on US government facilities in Benghazi, Libya, by Islamist terrorists in 2012 has spawned numerous conspiracy theories, including allegations that Obama&#x27;s administration arranged the attack for political reasons, and Senator Rand Paul&#x27;s claimed that the government&#x27;s response to the incident was designed to distract from a secret CIA operation.

=== Cultural Marxism ===

The intellectual group known as the Frankfurt School, which emerged in the 1930s, has increasingly been accused of promoting communism in capitalist societies. The term &quot;Cultural Marxism&quot; has been notably employed by conservative American movements such as the Tea Party, and by Norwegian mass murderer Anders Behring Breivik.

=== Deep state ===

While the term is occasionally used as a neutral term to denote a nation&#x27;s bureaucracy, the conspiratorial notion of a &quot;deep state&quot; originated principally in Middle Eastern and North African politics with some basis in truth, and has been known in the US since the 1960s. It was revived under the Trump presidency. &quot;Deep state&quot; in the latter sense refers to an unidentified insider &quot;power elite&quot; who manipulate a nation&#x27;s politics and government. Proponents have included Canadian author Peter Dale Scott, who has promoted the idea in the US since the 1990s, as well as &quot;Breitbart News&quot;, &quot;Infowars&quot; and Donald Trump. A 2017 poll by ABC News and &quot;The Washington Post&quot; indicated that 48% of Americans believe in the existence of a conspiratorial &quot;deep state&quot; in the US.

=== Sutherland Springs ===

The 2017 Sutherland Springs church shooting has also been the subject of multiple conspiracy theories. The shooter has been linked to multiple conspiracies, such as identifying him as a Democrat, Hillary Clinton supporter, Bernie Sanders supporter, &quot;alt-left&quot; supporter, antifa member, or radical Muslim; or claiming that he carried an antifa flag and told churchgoers: &quot;This is a communist revolution&quot;. Some reports also falsely claimed that he targeted the church because they were white conservatives.

=== Trump, Biden, and Ukraine ===

Beginning in 2017, a sprawling conspiracy theory emerged from 4chan and was spread via right-wing message boards and websites, then via Breitbart and Fox News to then-President Donald Trump and his allies. The conspiracy theory holds both that Ukraine (rather than Russia) had interfered in the 2016 United States elections, and that then-Vice President Joe Biden had intervened to protect a company in which his son Hunter was involved. &quot;The New Yorker&quot; found that reporting of the conspiracy in the right wing media was initiated by Peter Schweizer, a former &quot;Breitbart News&quot; contributor and president of The Government Accountability Institute, &quot;a self-styled corruption watchdog group chaired and funded by conservative mega-donor Rebekah Mercer&quot; and founded by Steve Bannon.

=== Biden-Ukraine conspiracy theory ===

A series of allegations have been made that Joe Biden and his son Hunter Biden coordinated efforts against anti-corruption investigations in Ukraine into the Ukrainian gas company Burisma, on whose Board Hunter Biden sat. Investigations are currently ongoing.

=== Michelle Obama ===
Some conservatives have supported a conspiracy theory falsely claiming that former FLOTUS, Michelle Obama, is secretly transgender, and that her name was originally &quot;Michael&quot;. Alex Jones has been a vocal supporter of the theory, initially promoting it in 2014 after Joan Rivers made a joke referring to Obama as transgender.

=== Ottoman and Turkish reforms, secularism, and statesmen ===


The belief that the modernist and secularist movements and reforms in the Ottoman Empire and the Turkish Republic were Judeo-Masonic conspiracies is dominant among Islamists. Because of their adherence to traditionalist elements and their creation of cults of personality for the Ottoman sultans, Islamists portray anything contrary to Islamic tradition as evil. According to them, the constitutionalist movement ended absolute monarchy, the end of traditional religious institutions, and the introduction of a secular state were the work of Jews, Freemasons, or &quot;Dönme&quot;s. For example, according to their conspiracy theory, Turkish President Mustafa Kemal Atatürk was a &quot;Dönme&quot;.

Various conspiracy theories against Atatürk have been put forward by Islamist circles who did not support his secularist reforms. Kadir Mısıroğlu, known for his hatred of Atatürk, is behind many conspiracy theories about Atatürk. One of these conspiracy theories is that Anatolia was invaded by the Greeks as a result of Atatürk&#x27;s agreement with the United Kingdom to overthrow the caliphate. Another conspiracy theory about Atatürk is that he was poisoned to death by the Freemasons due to the closure of Masonic lodges in Turkey in 1935. In 2015, &quot;Yeni Şafak&quot; claimed that İsmet İnönü was in charge of planning the murder.

In 2007, the bestselling book in Turkey was &quot;Musa&#x27;nın Çocukları: Tayyip ve Emine&quot; (The Children of Moses: Tayyip and Emine) by Ergün Poyraz. Poyraz claims that there is an international Jewish conspiracy pulling the strings behind the world, including installing Recep Tayyip Erdoğan as prime minister of Turkey.

===Golden billion threatens Russia===
The golden billion is an idea there is an anti-Russian Western population of approximately one billion seeking to appropriate Russia&#x27;s natural resources. It is a justification for Russian leader Vladimir Putin&#x27;s imperial aggression, claiming to be a defense against a far-reaching covert attack. The theory was first advanced under the name A. Kuzmich.

===Voting pencils===

The voting pencil conspiracy theory concerns pencils at polling places enabling electoral fraud through erasing legitimate votes. It has been nicknamed &quot;Pencilgate&quot; and promoted on Twitter as &quot;#Pencilgate&quot; and &quot;#UsePens&quot;. The conspiracy theory originated in the United Kingdom and was originally promoted by &quot;Yes&quot; voters in the unsuccessful 2014 Scottish independence referendum, with supporters of Scottish independence (who usually lean to the left of the political spectrum) claiming that electoral fraud was the reason the referendum failed. However, the theory was later adopted by supporters of the &quot;Leave&quot; vote in the successful 2016 Brexit referendum (who usually lean to the right of the political spectrum). The conspiracy theory has since spread to Australia, with right-wing politician Pauline Hanson, a Queensland Senator who is the founder and leader of the One Nation party, promoted the conspiracy theory in the lead-up to the 2022 Australian federal election.

While pencils are provided at polling places in the United Kingdom and Australia, in neither country is it required that they be used. On their website, the Australian Electoral Commission states:
While the AEC only conducts federal elections, voters can use either pencil or pen in state, territory and local elections. Pencils are supplied at polling places for federal elections and for state elections in Tasmania and Victoria, while pens are supplied at polling places for state elections in New South Wales and Western Australia. In 2015, the New South Wales Electoral Commission made the decision to replace pencils with pens at polling places due to controversies regarding their usage and at the 2015 state election, pens began being supplied at polling places across the state. Similarly, the Western Australian Electoral Commission has provided pens instead of pencils at polling places since the 2017.

===QAnon===

QAnon is a far-right American political conspiracy theory and political movement that originated in 2017. QAnon centers on fabricated claims made by an anonymous individual or individuals known as &quot;Q&quot;. Those claims have been relayed and developed by online communities and influencers. Their core belief is that a cabal of Satanic, cannibalistic child molesters are operating a global child sex trafficking ring that conspired against Donald Trump. QAnon has direct roots in Pizzagate, an Internet conspiracy theory that appeared one year earlier, but also incorporates elements of many other theories. QAnon has been described as a cult.

=== State-sponsored kidnappings of Muslims in Sweden ===

Since December 2021, disinformation has been spread concerning Swedish social services taking Muslim children into care without a legal basis. As a result of the conspiracy theory, two Swedish people were killed in Brussels in 2023.

=== Sustainable development ===
Various theories have emerged in response to concepts or international agreements relating to sustainable development. These include theories that Agenda 21, a non-binding action plan of the United Nations, is a plot, disguised as an environmental movement, to end individual freedom and establish a one-world government to cut the world population by 85%, and/or to introduce surveillance by the 5G network.

Similarly, the Great Reset Initiative is an economic recovery plan drawn up by the World Economic Forum (WEF) in response to the COVID-19 pandemic that prioritizes sustainable development. It has been the basis for theories that the COVID-19 pandemic will be used, or was even created by a secret group in order to seize control of the global economy.

The urban planning concept of 15-minute cities envisages that all of life&#x27;s necessities (e.g. work, shops, schools, medical centres) should be within a short walk or bike ride from people&#x27;s homes. This would thereby encourage people to use their cars less and reduce emissions and pollution in neighbourhoods. However, it has been interpreted as a plan to restrict freedom of movement outside of the 15-minute neighbourhood. These theories occasionally overlap with anti-vaccine misinformation, and fears of a world government.

== Medicine ==
=== Alternative therapy suppression ===
A 2013 study approved by the University of Chicago suggested that almost half of Americans believe at least one medical conspiracy theory, with 37% believing that the Food and Drug Administration deliberately suppresses &#x27;natural&#x27; cures due to influence from the pharmaceutical industry. A prominent proponent of comparable conspiracy theories has been convicted fraudster Kevin Trudeau.

=== Artificial diseases ===
Scientists have found evidence that HIV was transferred from monkeys to humans in the 1930s. Evidence exists, however, that the KGB deliberately disseminated a notion in the 1980s that it was invented by the CIA. This idea, and similar ideas concerning Ebola, have since been promoted by persons such as actor Steven Seagal, Nation of Islam leader Louis Farrakhan and former South Africa President Thabo Mbeki. Similar conspiracy theories allege that pharmaceutical companies assist in the creation of conditions and diseases including ADHD, HSV and HPV.

=== COVID-19 pandemic ===
A number of conspiracy theories have been promoted about the origin and purported motive behind the SARS-CoV-2 virus and its spread. Some claimed that the virus was engineered, that it may have been a Chinese or United States bioweapon, a Jewish plot, part of which is to force mass vaccinations or sterilizations, spread as part of a Muslim conspiracy, a population control scheme, or related to 5G mobile phone networks.

=== Fluoridation ===
Water fluoridation is the controlled addition of fluoride to a public water supply to reduce tooth decay. Although many dental-health organizations support it, some conspiracy theorists claim that it was a way to dispose of industrial waste, or that it exists to obscure a failure to provide dental care to the poor. A further theory promoted by the John Birch Society in the 1960s described fluoridation as a communist plot to weaken the American population.

=== Vaccination ===
It is claimed that the pharmaceutical industry has mounted a cover-up of a causal link between vaccines and autism. The conspiracy theory developed after the publication in Britain in 1998 of a fraudulent paper by discredited former doctor Andrew Wakefield. The resulting anti-vaccine movement has been promoted by a number of prominent persons including Rob Schneider, Jim Carrey, former US President Donald Trump and Robert F. Kennedy Jr., Trump&#x27;s pick to lead the US Department of Health and Human Services. It has led to increased rates of infection and death from diseases such as measles and COVID-19 in many countries, including the US, Italy, Germany, Romania and the UK. Vaccine conspiracy theories have been widespread in Nigeria since at least 2003, as well as in Pakistan. Such theories may feature claims that vaccines are part of a secret anti-Islam plot, and have been linked to fatal mass shootings and bombings at vaccine clinics in both countries.

== Outer space ==
Scientific space programs are of particular interest to conspiracy theorists. The most prolific theories allege that the US moon landings were staged by NASA in a film studio, with some alleging the involvement of director Stanley Kubrick. The Soviet space program has also attracted theories that the government concealed evidence of failed flights. A more recent theory, emergent following the activities of hacker Gary McKinnon, suggests that a secret program of crewed space fleets exists, supposedly acting under the United Nations.

Conspiracy theorists have long posited a plot by organizations such as NASA to conceal the existence of a large planet in the Solar System known as Nibiru or Planet X, which is alleged to pass close enough to the Earth to destroy it. Predictions for the date of destruction have included 2003, 2012 and 2017. The theory began to develop following the publication of &quot;The 12th Planet&quot; (1976), by Russian-American author Zecharia Sitchin, was given its full form by Nancy Lieder, and has since been promoted by American conspiracy theorist and end times theorist David Meade. The notion received renewed attention during the period prior to the solar eclipse of 21 August 2017. Other conspiracy theorists in 2017 also predicted Nibiru would appear, including Terral Croft and YouTube pastor Paul Begley.

=== Extraterrestrials and UFOs ===

Among the foremost concerns of conspiracy theorists are questions of alien life; for example, allegations of government cover-ups of the supposed Roswell incident or activity at Area 51. Multiple reports of dead cattle found with absent body parts and seemingly drained of blood have emerged worldwide since at least the 1960s. This phenomenon has spawned theories variously concerning aliens and secret government or military experiments. Prominent among such theorists is Linda Moulton Howe, author of &quot;Alien Harvest&quot; (1989).

Many conspiracy theories have drawn inspiration from the writings of ancient astronaut proponent Zecharia Sitchin, who declared that the Anunnaki from Sumerian mythology were actually a race of extraterrestrial beings who came to Earth around 500,000 years ago in order to mine gold. In his 1994 book &quot;Humanity&#x27;s Extraterrestrial Origins: ET Influences on Humankind&#x27;s Biological and Cultural Evolution&quot;, Arthur Horn proposed that the Anunnaki were a race of blood-drinking, shape-shifting alien reptiles. This theory was adapted and elaborated on by British conspiracy theorist David Icke, who maintains that the Bush family, Margaret Thatcher, Bob Hope, and the British Royal Family, among others, are or were such creatures, or have been under their control. Icke&#x27;s critics have suggested that &#x27;reptilians&#x27; may be seen as an antisemitic code word, a charge he has denied.

== Science and technology ==
=== Climate change ===
A climate change conspiracy theory typically alleges that the science behind climate change has been invented or distorted for ideological or financial reasons—higher taxation, controls on lifestyle, and more authoritarian government. Former US President Donald Trump, US Senator James Inhofe, British journalist Christopher Booker, and Viscount Christopher Monckton have promoted such theories. Popular author Michael Crichton wrote a novel based on this premise.

=== Weather and earthquake control projects ===
Numerous theories pertain to real or alleged weather-controlling projects. Theories include the debunked assertion that HAARP, a radio-technology research program funded by the US government, is a secret weather-controlling system. Some theorists have blamed 2005&#x27;s Hurricane Katrina and 2024&#x27;s Helene and Milton on HAARP. HAARP has also been suggested to have somehow caused earthquakes, such as the 2010 Haiti earthquake, the 2011 Tōhoku earthquake and tsunami or the 2013 Saravan earthquake. Some HAARP-related claims refer to mind-control technology. Also, of interest to conspiracy theorists are cloud-seeding technologies. These include a debunked allegation that the British military&#x27;s Project Cumulus caused the fatal 1952 Lynmouth Flood in Devon, England, 
California drought manipulation conspiracy theory, and claims concerning a secret project said to have caused the 2010 Pakistan floods.

=== MKUltra ===
Genuine American research in the 1950s and 1960s into chemical interrogation and mind-control techniques were followed by many conspiracy theories (like Project Monarch), especially following CIA Director Richard Helm&#x27;s 1973 order to destroy all files related to the project. These theories include the allegation that the mass fatality at Jonestown in 1978 was connected to an MKUltra experiment.

=== Flat Earth ===
Flat Earth theory first emerged in 19th-century England, despite the Earth&#x27;s spherical nature having been known since at least the time of Pythagoras. It has in recent years been promoted by American software consultant Mark Sargent through the use of YouTube videos. Flat-earther conspiracy theorists hold that planet Earth is not a sphere, and that evidence has been faked or suppressed to hide the fact that it is instead a disc, or a single infinite plane. The conspiracy often implicates NASA. Other claims include that GPS devices are rigged to make aircraft pilots wrongly believe they are flying around a globe.

=== RFID chips ===

Radio frequency identification chips (RFID), such as those implanted into pets as a means of tracking, have drawn the interest of conspiracy theorists who posit that this technology is secretly widely implanted in humans. Former Whitby, England town councilor Simon Parkes has promoted this theory, which may be related to conspiracy theories concerning vaccination, electronic banking and the Antichrist.

=== Technology suppression ===
Numerous theories pertain to the alleged suppression of certain technologies and energies. Such theories may focus on the Vril Society Conspiracy, allegations of the suppression of the electric car by fossil-fuel companies (as detailed in the 2006 documentary &quot;Who Killed the Electric Car?&quot;), and the Phoebus cartel, set up in 1924, which has been accused of suppressing longer-lasting light bulbs. Other long-standing allegations include the suppression of perpetual motion and cold fusion technology by government agencies, special interest groups, or fraudulent inventors. Promoters of alternative energy theories have included Thomas Henry Moray, Eugene Mallove, and convicted American fraudster Stanley Meyer.

=== Weaponry ===
Conspiracy theorists often attend to new military technologies, both real and imagined. Subjects of theories include: the alleged Philadelphia Experiment, a supposed attempt to turn a US Navy warship invisible; the alleged Montauk Project, a supposed government program to learn about mind control and time travel; and the so-called &quot;tsunami bomb&quot;, which is alleged to have caused the 2004 Indian Ocean tsunami.

Other theories include Peter Vogel&#x27;s debunked claim that an accidental explosion of conventional munitions at Port Chicago was in fact a nuclear detonation, and a theory promoted by the Venezuelan state-run TV station ViVe that the 2010 Haiti earthquake was caused by a secret US &quot;earthquake weapon&quot;.

=== Targeted Individuals ===

Conspiracy theorists claim that government agents are utilizing directed-energy weapons and electronic surveillance to harass members of the population. Theorists often cite research into psychotronic weapons, the Cuban Health Attacks, and the Microwave Auditory Effect as proof of their theory. There are over 10,000 people who identify as Targeted Individuals. The &quot;Targeted Individual&quot; phenomenon has been featured on episodes of &quot;Conspiracy Theory with Jesse Ventura&quot; and History Channel&#x27;s &quot;In Search of...&quot;.

=== False history ===
Some theories claim that the dates of historical events have been deliberately distorted. These include the phantom time hypothesis of German conspiracy theorist Heribert Illig, who in 1991 published an allegation that 297 years had been added to the calendar by establishment figures such as Pope Sylvester II in order to position themselves at the millennium.

A comparable theory, new chronology, is associated with Russian theorist Anatoly Fomenko, who holds that history is many centuries shorter than widely believed, numerous historical documents have been fabricated, and legitimate documents destroyed, all for political ends. Adherents of have included chess grandmaster Garry Kasparov.

Another claim is that world governments have hidden evidence for an advanced worldwide civilization with access to free energy and partially populated by giants called Tartaria, which was destroyed in the 1800s by a great &quot;mud flood&quot; cataclysm, causing its remains to be buried.

=== Dead Internet theory ===

The Dead Internet theory is the belief that the modern Internet is almost entirely populated by bots and procedurally generated content.

=== Smartphones listening in on private conversations ===

According to the theory, smartphones with microphones listen to private off-line conversations and use the data for targeted ads.



=== 5G misinformation ===

Conspiracy theories about mobile phone technology have circulated since the 1990s, having historical parallels with 1903-era radiophobia. With 5G technology deploying in 2019, the same year that SARS-CoV-2 (the COVID-19 virus) was discovered, multiple conspiracy theories arose linking the two. From that origin, the list of presumed 5G risks expanded to causing cancers, the killing of wildlife, and government &amp; industrial surveillance.

== Sports ==
=== Boxing ===
Boxing has featured in conspiracy theories, such as the claims that the second Ali-Liston fight and the first Bradley-Pacquiao fight were fixed.

=== Shergar ===
The theft and disappearance of the Irish-bred racehorse Shergar in 1983 has prompted many conspiracy theorists to speculate about involvement by the Mafia, the IRA and Colonel Gaddafi.

=== Rigged selection processes ===
The &quot;frozen envelope theory&quot; suggests that the National Basketball Association rigged its 1985 draft lottery so that Patrick Ewing would join the New York Knicks. Theorists claim that a lottery envelope was chilled so that it could be identified by touch. A similar &quot;hot balls theory&quot;, promoted by Scottish football manager David Moyes, suggests that certain balls used in draws for UEFA and AFC competitions have been warmed to achieve specific outcomes.

=== 1984 Firecracker 400 ===
The 1984 Firecracker 400 at Daytona International Speedway in Daytona, Florida, was the first NASCAR race to be attended by a sitting US president, Ronald Reagan, and was driver Richard Petty&#x27;s 200th and final career victory. Rival driver Cale Yarborough&#x27;s premature retirement to the pit road has prompted conspiracy theorists to allege that organizers fixed the race in order to receive good publicity for the event.

=== Ronaldo and the 1998 FIFA World Cup final ===
On the day of the 1998 FIFA World Cup final, Brazilian striker Ronaldo suffered a convulsive fit. Ronaldo was initially removed from the starting lineup 72 minutes before the match, with the teamsheet released to a stunned world media, before he was reinstated by Brazil coach Mário Zagallo shortly before kick off. Ronaldo &quot;sleepwalked&quot; through the final, with France winning the game. The nature of the incident set off a trail of questions and allegations that persisted for years, with Alex Bellos writing in &quot;The Guardian&quot;, &quot;When Ronaldo&#x27;s health scare was revealed after the match, the situation&#x27;s unique circumstances lent itself to fabulous conspiracy theories. Here was the world&#x27;s most famous sportsman, about to take part in the most important match of his career, when he suddenly, inexplicably, fell ill. Was it stress, epilepsy, or had he been drugged?&quot; Questions also circulated into who made Ronaldo play the game. Zagallo insisted he had the final say, but much speculation focused on sportswear company Nike, Brazil&#x27;s multimillion-dollar sponsor—whom many Brazilians thought had too much control—putting pressure on the striker to play against medical advice.

=== New England Patriots ===
The New England Patriots have also been involved in numerous conspiracy theories. During their AFC Championship 24–20 victory over the Jacksonville Jaguars, several conspiracy theories spread stating that the referees helped the Patriots advance to Super Bowl LII where they were eventually defeated by the champion Philadelphia Eagles. However, sports analyst Stephen A. Smith stated the Jaguars were not robbed, but that they had no one to blame but themselves for the loss. There were also conspiracy theories regarding the Super Bowl LI matchup between the Patriots and the Atlanta Falcons stating that the game was rigged while others said the Falcons made questionable play-calls at the end of the game that resulted in them blowing a 28–3 lead.

<doc id="360135" wikidata="Q2986804" url="?curid=360135" title="Committee on the Present Danger">
<text>The Committee on the Present Danger (CPD) is the name used by a succession of American anti-communist foreign policy interest groups. Throughout its four iterations—in the 1950s, the 1970s, the 2000s, and 2019—it has influenced foreign policy since the administration of Harry S. Truman. Its first iteration disbanded as its leading members joined the Dwight Eisenhower administration, leading for it to be reformed in 1976 to counter the Soviet Union during the cold war. This iteration achieved notable success during the Reagan administration. The third iteration was formed by veterans of the Cold War in 2004 in support of the war on terror. The fourth iteration, the Committee on the Present Danger: China (CPDC) returned the group to its anti-communist roots with a focus on the threat posed to the United States by the China Communist Party.

==Overview==
The committee first met in 1950, founded by Tracy Voorhees, to promote the plans proposed in NSC 68 by Paul Nitze and Dean Acheson. It lobbied the government directly and sought to influence public opinion through a publicity campaign, notably a weekly radio broadcast on the Mutual Broadcasting System throughout 1951. This iteration was effectively disbanded after 1952, following the appointment of Voorhees and others to senior positions in the administration.

It was privately revived in March 1976 to try to influence the presidential candidates and their advisors. After Jimmy Carter won the election, CPD went public again and spent the next four years lobbying, particularly against détente and the SALT II agreement. Its hawkish conclusions influenced the CIA&#x27;s future reporting on the Soviet threat. This iteration of the CPD provided 33 officials to the Ronald Reagan administration, plus Reagan himself.

==History==

=== First CPD (1950s) ===
On December 12, 1950, James Conant, Tracy Voorhees and Vannevar Bush announced the creation of the committee on the Present Danger. The group was formed in order to support the Truman Administration&#x27;s remilitarization plans contained within NSC 68. The &#x27;present danger&#x27; to which the group&#x27;s title referred was &quot;the aggressive designs of the Soviet Union&quot;, the CPD announced.

=== Second CPD (1970s) ===
On November 11, 1976, the second iteration was announced. The name of this version of the committee was &quot;borrow[ed]&quot; from the 1950s version, and was not a direct successor.

Some of its members lobbied for, and were members of, the 1976 Team B, providing an opposing view to the CIA&#x27;s &quot;Team A&quot;.

Thirty-three officials of the Reagan administration were CPD members, including Director of Central Intelligence William Casey, National Security Advisor Richard V. Allen, United States Ambassador to the United Nations Jeane Kirkpatrick, Secretary of the Navy John Lehman, Secretary of State George Shultz, and Assistant Secretary of Defense Richard Perle. Reagan himself was a member in 1979.

===Third CPD (2004)===
In June 2004, &quot;The Hill&quot; reported that a third incarnation of CPD was being planned, to address the War on Terrorism. This incarnation of the committee was still active as of 2008. The head of the 2004 CPD, PR pro and former Reagan adviser Peter D. Hannaford, explained, &quot;we saw a parallel&quot; between the Soviet threat and the threat from terrorism. The message that CPD will convey through lobbying, media work and conferences is that the war on terror needs to be won, he said.

Members of the 2004 CPD included Vice President for Policy Larry Haas, Senator Joseph I. Lieberman, former CIA director R. James Woolsey Jr., former National Security Advisor to President Reagan, Robert C. McFarlane, and Reagan administration official and 1976 Committee founder Max Kampelman. At the July 20, 2004, launching of the 2004 CPD, Lieberman and Senator Jon Kyl were identified as the honorary co-chairs.

===Fourth CPD (2019)===

The fourth iteration of the Committee on the Present Danger was unveiled on March 25, 2019. The revived CPDC was focused on education and advocacy on a perceived existential and ideological threat posed by Communist China to the United States. 

The relaunched organization was announced with Frank Gaffney, a former White House official under President Ronald Reagan, playing a key role. Its stated aim is to &quot;educate and inform American citizens and policymakers about the existential threats presented from the People&#x27;s Republic of China under the misrule of the Chinese Communist Party&quot;. Between 2000 and 2023, there were 224 reported instances of Chinese espionage directed at the United States. The CPDC takes the view that there is &quot;no hope of coexistence with China as long as the Communist Party governs the country&quot;. In a statement on the launch of the committee, the Population Research Institute stated: &quot;The United States is in a new cold war. The Chinese Communist Party poses the greatest threat to both the United States and the world since the fall of the Soviet Union. Then, as now, the threat of a totalitarian regime with an evil ideology – one that is willing to kill 400 million of its own unborn children – must be stopped.&quot;

====Criticisms====
The CPDC has been criticized as promoting a revival of Red Scare politics in the United States, and for the involvement of Frank Gaffney and activist Steve Bannon. David Skidmore, writing for &quot;The Diplomat&quot;, described it as the latest instance of &quot;what was once referred to as the &#x27;military-industrial complex&#x27;&quot; influencing policy. Charles W. Freeman Jr. at the Watson Institute called the CPDC &quot;a &quot;Who&#x27;s Who&quot; of contemporary wing-nuts, very few of whom have any expertise at all about China and most of whom represent ideological causes only peripherally connected to it.&quot;

<doc id="360136" wikidata="Q1000120" url="?curid=360136" title="Maximal torus">
<text>In the mathematical theory of compact Lie groups a special role is played by torus subgroups, in particular by the maximal torus subgroups.

A torus in a compact Lie group &quot;G&quot; is a compact, connected, abelian Lie subgroup of &quot;G&quot; (and therefore isomorphic to the standard torus T&quot;n&quot;). A maximal torus is one which is maximal among such subgroups. That is, &quot;T&quot; is a maximal torus if for any torus &quot;T&quot;′ containing &quot;T&quot; we have &quot;T&quot; = &quot;T&quot;′. Every torus is contained in a maximal torus simply by dimensional considerations. A noncompact Lie group need not have any nontrivial tori (e.g. R&quot;n&quot;).

The dimension of a maximal torus in &quot;G&quot; is called the rank of &quot;G&quot;. The rank is well-defined since all maximal tori turn out to be conjugate. For semisimple groups the rank is equal to the number of nodes in the associated Dynkin diagram.

==Examples==
The unitary group U(&quot;n&quot;) has as a maximal torus the subgroup of all diagonal matrices. That is,
: formula_1
&quot;T&quot; is clearly isomorphic to the product of &quot;n&quot; circles, so the unitary group U(&quot;n&quot;) has rank &quot;n&quot;. A maximal torus in the special unitary group SU(&quot;n&quot;) ⊂ U(&quot;n&quot;) is just the intersection of &quot;T&quot; and SU(&quot;n&quot;) which is a torus of dimension &quot;n&quot; − 1.

A maximal torus in the special orthogonal group SO(2&quot;n&quot;) is given by the set of all simultaneous rotations in any fixed choice of &quot;n&quot; pairwise orthogonal planes (i.e., two dimensional vector spaces). Concretely, one maximal torus consists of all block-diagonal matrices with formula_2 diagonal blocks, where each diagonal block is a rotation matrix.
This is also a maximal torus in the group SO(2&quot;n&quot;+1) where the action fixes the remaining direction. Thus both SO(2&quot;n&quot;) and SO(2&quot;n&quot;+1) have rank &quot;n&quot;. For example, in the rotation group SO(3) the maximal tori are given by rotations about a fixed axis.

The symplectic group Sp(&quot;n&quot;) has rank &quot;n&quot;. A maximal torus is given by the set of all diagonal matrices whose entries all lie in a fixed complex subalgebra of H.

==Properties==
Let &quot;G&quot; be a compact, connected Lie group and let formula_3 be the Lie algebra of &quot;G&quot;. The first main result is the torus theorem, which may be formulated as follows:
:Torus theorem: If &quot;T&quot; is one fixed maximal torus in &quot;G&quot;, then every element of &quot;G&quot; is conjugate to an element of &quot;T&quot;. 
This theorem has the following consequences:
* All maximal tori in &quot;G&quot; are conjugate. 
* All maximal tori have the same dimension, known as the &quot;rank&quot; of &quot;G&quot;.
* A maximal torus in &quot;G&quot; is a maximal abelian subgroup, but the converse need not hold.
* The maximal tori in &quot;G&quot; are exactly the Lie subgroups corresponding to the maximal abelian subalgebras of formula_3 (cf. Cartan subalgebra)
* Every element of &quot;G&quot; lies in some maximal torus; thus, the exponential map for &quot;G&quot; is surjective.
* If &quot;G&quot; has dimension &quot;n&quot; and rank &quot;r&quot; then &quot;n&quot; − &quot;r&quot; is even.

==Root system==
If &quot;T&quot; is a maximal torus in a compact Lie group &quot;G&quot;, one can define a root system as follows. The roots are the weights for the adjoint action of &quot;T&quot; on the complexified Lie algebra of &quot;G&quot;. To be more explicit, let formula_5 denote the Lie algebra of &quot;T&quot;, let formula_3 denote the Lie algebra of formula_7, and let formula_8 denote the complexification of formula_3. Then we say that an element formula_10 is a root for &quot;G&quot; relative to &quot;T&quot; if formula_11 and there exists a nonzero formula_12 such that
:formula_13
for all formula_14. Here formula_15 is a fixed inner product on formula_3 that is invariant under the adjoint action of connected compact Lie groups.

The root system, as a subset of the Lie algebra formula_5 of &quot;T&quot;, has all the usual properties of a root system, except that the roots may not span formula_5. The root system is a key tool in understanding the classification and representation theory of &quot;G&quot;.

== Weyl group ==
Given a torus &quot;T&quot; (not necessarily maximal), the Weyl group of &quot;G&quot; with respect to &quot;T&quot; can be defined as the normalizer of &quot;T&quot; modulo the centralizer of &quot;T&quot;. That is, 
:formula_19 
Fix a maximal torus formula_20 in &quot;G;&quot; then the corresponding Weyl group is called the Weyl group of &quot;G&quot; (it depends up to isomorphism on the choice of &quot;T&quot;). 

The first two major results about the Weyl group are as follows.
* The centralizer of &quot;T&quot; in &quot;G&quot; is equal to &quot;T&quot;, so the Weyl group is equal to &quot;N&quot;(&quot;T&quot;)/&quot;T&quot;.
* The Weyl group is generated by reflections about the roots of the associated Lie algebra. Thus, the Weyl group of &quot;T&quot; is isomorphic to the Weyl group of the root system of the Lie algebra of &quot;G&quot;.

We now list some consequences of these main results.
* Two elements in &quot;T&quot; are conjugate if and only if they are conjugate by an element of &quot;W&quot;. That is, each conjugacy class of &quot;G&quot; intersects &quot;T&quot; in exactly one Weyl orbit. In fact, the space of conjugacy classes in &quot;G&quot; is homeomorphic to the orbit space &quot;T&quot;/&quot;W&quot;.
* The Weyl group acts by (outer) automorphisms on &quot;T&quot; (and its Lie algebra).
* The identity component of the normalizer of &quot;T&quot; is also equal to &quot;T&quot;. The Weyl group is therefore equal to the component group of &quot;N&quot;(&quot;T&quot;).
* The Weyl group is finite.
The representation theory of &quot;G&quot; is essentially determined by &quot;T&quot; and &quot;W&quot;.

As an example, consider the case formula_21 with formula_22 being the diagonal subgroup of formula_7. Then formula_24 belongs to formula_25 if and only if formula_26 maps each standard basis element formula_27 to a multiple of some other standard basis element formula_28, that is, if and only if formula_26 permutes the standard basis elements, up to multiplication by some constants. The Weyl group in this case is then the permutation group on formula_30 elements.

==Weyl integral formula==
Suppose &quot;f&quot; is a continuous function on &quot;G&quot;. Then the integral over &quot;G&quot; of &quot;f&quot; with respect to the normalized Haar measure &quot;dg&quot; may be computed as follows:
: formula_31
where formula_32 is the normalized volume measure on the quotient manifold formula_33 and formula_34 is the normalized Haar measure on &quot;T&quot;. Here Δ is given by the Weyl denominator formula and formula_35 is the order of the Weyl group. An important special case of this result occurs when &quot;f&quot; is a class function, that is, a function invariant under conjugation. In that case, we have
: formula_36
Consider as an example the case formula_37, with formula_22 being the diagonal subgroup. Then the Weyl integral formula for class functions takes the following explicit form:

: formula_39
Here formula_40, the normalized Haar measure on formula_22 is formula_42, and formula_43 denotes the diagonal matrix with diagonal entries formula_44 and formula_45.

<doc id="360138" wikidata="Q217294" url="?curid=360138" title="24 Hour Party People">
<text>24 Hour Party People is a 2002 British biographical comedy drama film about Manchester&#x27;s popular music community from 1976 to 1992, and specifically about Factory Records. It was written by Frank Cottrell Boyce and directed by Michael Winterbottom. The film was entered into the 2002 Cannes Film Festival to positive reviews.

It begins with the punk rock era of the late 1970s and moves through the 1980s into the rave and DJ culture and the &quot;Madchester&quot; scene of the late 1980s and early 1990s. The main character is Tony Wilson (played by Steve Coogan), a news reporter for Granada Television and the head of Factory Records. The narrative largely follows his career, while also covering the careers of the major Factory artists, especially Joy Division and New Order, A Certain Ratio, The Durutti Column and Happy Mondays.

The film is a dramatisation based on a combination of real events, rumours, urban legends and the imaginings of the scriptwriter, as the film makes clear. In one scene, one-time Buzzcocks member Howard Devoto (played by Martin Hancock) is shown having sex with Wilson&#x27;s first wife in the toilets of a club; the real Devoto, an extra in the scene, turns to the camera and says, &quot;I definitely don&#x27;t remember this happening&quot;. The fourth wall is frequently broken, with Wilson (who also acts as the narrator) frequently commenting on events directly to camera as they occur, at one point declaring that he is &quot;being postmodern, before it&#x27;s fashionable&quot;. The actors are often intercut with real contemporary concert footage, including the Sex Pistols gig at the Lesser Free Trade Hall.

== Plot ==
In 1976 television presenter Tony Wilson sees the Sex Pistols perform at the Manchester Lesser Free Trade Hall for the first time. Inspired, Wilson starts a weekly series of punk rock shows at a Manchester club, where the newly formed Joy Division perform, led by the erratic, brooding Ian Curtis.

Wilson founds a record label, Factory Records, and signs Joy Division as the first band; the contract is written in Wilson&#x27;s blood and gives the Factory artists full control over their music. He hires irascible producer Martin Hannett to record Joy Division, and soon the band and label have a hit record. In 1980, just before Joy Division is to tour the United States, Curtis hangs himself. Joy Division rename themselves New Order and record a hit single, &quot;Blue Monday&quot;.

Wilson opens a nightclub, the Haçienda; business is slow at first, but eventually the club is packed each night. Wilson signs another hit band, Happy Mondays, led by Shaun Ryder, and the ecstasy-fuelled rave culture is born.

Despite the apparent success, Factory Records is losing money. Every copy of &quot;Blue Monday&quot; sold loses five pence, as the intricate packaging by Peter Saville costs more than the single&#x27;s sale price. Wilson pays for New Order to record a new album in Ibiza, but after two years, they still have not delivered a record. He pays for the Happy Mondays to record their fourth studio album in Barbados, but Ryder spends all the money on drugs. When Wilson finally receives the album, he finds that Ryder has refused to record vocals, and all the tracks are instrumentals. At the Haçienda, ecstasy use is curbing alcohol sales and attracting gang violence.

The Factory partners try to save the business by selling the label to London Records. However, Wilson reveals that the Factory does not hold contracts with any of its artists and, therefore, doesn&#x27;t own a catalogue of recordings. This renders the company ultimately worthless and the deal falls through. While smoking marijuana on the roof of Haçienda after its closing night, Wilson has a vision of God, who assures Wilson he has earned a place in history.

== Production ==
Director Michael Winterbottom held talks with the BBC about financing the film, but the studio &quot;weren’t convinced anyone was interested in Tony.&quot; Once production got underway, Winterbottom emulated a documentary style of shooting and cinéma vérité, as cast members were encouraged to improvise and blocking was loose or non-existent. The character of Tony Wilson is an unreliable narrator who regularly breaks the fourth wall, referencing Wilson&#x27;s job as a TV presenter. Real documentary footage of the period was also spliced into the film.

Steve Coogan and Wilson were acquainted before filming, having first met in 1975. When Coogan later worked on a Granada Television late night show, the two men occasionally socialized. Winterbottom recalled that Wilson helped the production team make connections with &quot;everyone involved in the scene.&quot;

Production designer Mark Tildesley rebuilt the Haçienda nightclub interior to its exact proportions in a Manchester warehouse. The original building had been demolished and replaced with luxury flats in 2002. Coogan, who performed at the club in 1986, &quot;got goosebumps when [he] walked into the re-created Haçienda.&quot; To achieve the needed atmosphere, the production ran it as a real nightclub for a couple of nights, and New Order worked the DJ booth.

== Reception and awards ==

Roger Ebert gave it four out of four stars, writing, &quot;The movie works so well because it evokes genuine, not manufactured, nostalgia. It records a time when the inmates ran the asylum, when music lovers got away with murder. It loves its characters.&quot;

&quot;Empire&quot; gave it four out of five stars, highlighting the film&#x27;s director.

The film was nominated for the Palme d&#x27;Or at the 2002 Cannes Film Festival, competing against other films the same year, including &quot;About Schmidt&quot;, and &quot;The Pianist&quot;.

In 2019, &quot;The Guardian&quot; ranked the film 49th in its 100 best films of the 21st century list.

As usual with anything related to Factory Records, the film received its own FAC catalogue number – posthumously, in a sense, as Factory had already been bankrupt for nearly a decade. &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; is known as FAC 401, being first on the hundred that features other video &amp; multimedia releases.

== Soundtrack ==
The soundtrack to &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; features songs by artists closely associated with Factory Records who were depicted in the film. These include Happy Mondays, Joy Division (later to become New Order) and The Durutti Column. Manchester band the Buzzcocks are featured, as are The Clash. The album begins with &quot;Anarchy in the U.K.&quot; by the Sex Pistols, the band credited in the film with inspiring Factory Records co-founder Tony Wilson to devote himself to promoting music.

New tracks recorded for the album include Joy Division&#x27;s &quot;New Dawn Fades&quot;, from a concert performance by New Order with Moby and Billy Corgan.

<text>Charles Marie René Leconte de Lisle (; 22 October 1818 – 17 July 1894) was a French poet of the Parnassian movement. He is traditionally known by his surname only, Leconte de Lisle.

==Biography==
Leconte de Lisle was born on the French overseas island of La Réunion, in the Indian Ocean. He spent his childhood there and later in Brittany. Among his friends in those years was the musician Charles Bénézit. His father, an army surgeon who brought Leconte up with great severity, sent him to travel in the East Indies intending to prepare him for a business career. However, after returning from this journey, the young man preferred to complete his education in Rennes, Brittany, specializing in Greek, Italian and history. In 1845 he settled definitively in Paris.

He was involved in the French Revolution of 1848 which ended with the overthrow of the Orleans King Louis Philippe of France, but took no further part in politics after the Second Republic was declared.

His first volume, &quot;La Vénus de Milo&quot;, attracted to him a number of friends many of whom were passionately devoted to classical literature. However, as a writer he is most famous for his three collections of poetry: &quot;Poèmes antiques&quot; (1852), &quot;Poèmes barbares&quot; (1862), &quot;Poèmes tragiques&quot; (1884). He is also known for his translations of Ancient Greek tragedians and poets, such as Aeschylus, Sophocles, Euripides and Horace.

Leconte de Lisle played a leading role in the Parnassian poetic movement (1866) and shared many of the values of other poets of this generation, bridging the Romantic and Symbolist periods.

Although Leconte de Lisle was a fervent Republican, during the reign of Napoleon III he accepted the pensions and decorations offered to him by the Emperor. This was held against him after the fall of the Second Empire and its replacement by the Third Republic, in 1871.

However, Leconte de Lisle redeemed himself with the new government by writing two democratically-oriented books entitled &quot;A People&#x27;s History of the French Revolution&quot; and &quot;A People&#x27;s History of Christianity&quot;, respectively. These works earned him a post as Assistant Librarian at the Luxembourg Palace in 1873; in 1886 he was elected to the French Academy, in succession to Victor Hugo.

==Personal life==
Leconte de Lisle married Anna Adélaïde Perray (March 29, 1833 - September 8, 1916), daughter of Jacques Perray and Amélie Leconte, in Paris on September 10, 1857; they had no children.

Leconte de Lisle died on 17 July 1894 at Voisins in the township of Louveciennes, to the west of Paris.

==Works==
As well as poetry, Leconte de Lisle produced a number of theatrical plays, lyrical works, translations, and historical works. His works are shown below, in chronological order.

<doc id="360145" wikidata="Q2734568" url="?curid=360145" title="St Michael's Isle">
<text>St Michael&#x27;s Isle ( or ), more commonly referred to as Fort Island, is an island in Malew parish in the Isle of Man, noted for its attractive ruins. It covers an area of , is about long from west to east, and is connected to the Langness Peninsula, near Derbyhaven, by a narrow causeway. The island itself is made of rocky slate and the soil is very acidic. Nevertheless, it has important communities of maritime plants.

==History==
There is evidence for human activity on the island from the Mesolithic period onwards and there are two ancient buildings on the island. Both are in a state of ruin and closed to the public, though there are a number of walks which allow visitors to explore the surroundings.

The island commands the entrance to what was the vital strategic port of Derbyhaven. This was something which necessitated the construction of a fort in order to safeguard the entrance to the bay and which gave rise to the name of Fort Island. Work was initially carried out by Edward Stanley, 3rd Earl of Derby on the order of King Henry VIII with subsequent upgrading taking place in 1645 on the instructions of the 7th Earl.

The original name of St Michael&#x27;s Isle is recorded as early as 1250 when John McDougal, Lord of the Isles, whom the King of Norway had appointed regent of Man while succession to the throne was being decided, landed at Ronaldsway with his son-in-law, the future King Magnus. The reception to the landing was hostile and resulted in McDougal leading his men onto St Michael&#x27;s Isle where he marshalled his men into troops as they prepared to engage in battle. The Manx in turn also drew up for battle facing their adversaries, whom they were unable to reach because the high tide had cut St Michael&#x27;s Isle off from them and so the prospect of battle dissipated.

In 1275 after Alexander III, King of Scotland, had obtained possession of the Isle of Man, rebellion broke out on behalf of Godred, son of King Magnus, whom Alexander had defeated in battle and who had subsequently ceded the Isle of Man. John de Vesci, a Galloway nobleman, and other officers of the Scottish King landed on St Michael&#x27;s Isle and again peace was offered and refused. The following morning, prior to sunrise, battle was joined and the Manx were defeated.

Kirk Michael (not to be confused with the Manx village of the same name) is mentioned in a description of the boundaries of Rushen Abbey, which appears to have been compiled in or around the year 1376. &quot;Kirk&quot; is a Scottish and former Northern English word meaning &quot;church&quot;, and in this context, is a reference to Michael&#x27;s Church, now known as St Michael&#x27;s Chapel in modern English. St Michael&#x27;s Chapel, a 12th-century chapel, is on the south side of the island. This Celtic-Norse chapel was built on the site of an older Celtic .

The island is the site of two great battles for the control of the Isle of Man in 1250 and 1275, when England, Scotland and the Manx were fighting for control of the island. The Manx won the first battle, but as described above, 25 years later they lost control to Scotland.

==Derby Fort==

Derby Fort, a 17th-century fort, is at the eastern end of the island. It was built by James Stanley, the 7th Earl of Derby and Lord of Mann in 1645, during the English Civil War, to protect the then busy port of Derbyhaven.

The island is a bird sanctuary.

It was redesignated as the &quot;65th Battalion, Mount Royal Rifles&quot; on 5 November 1869, as the &quot;65th Regiment &quot;Mount Royal Rifles&quot;&quot; on 8 May 1900 as the &quot;65th Regiment &quot;Carabiniers Mont-Royal&quot;&quot; on 1 August 1902, as &quot;Les Carabiniers Mont-Royal&quot; on 29 March 1920, as &quot;Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal&quot; on 15 April 1931, as the &quot;2nd (Reserve) Battalion, Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal&quot; on 7 November 1940 and finally as &quot;Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal&quot; on 15 November 1945.

Upon redesignation as Les Carabiniers Mont-Royal on 29 March 1920 it was organized as a two-battalion regiment with the 1st Battalion (perpetuating the 69th Battalion (Canadien-Français), CEF) on the Non-Permanent Active Militia order of battle, and the 2nd Battalion (perpetuating the 150th Battalion (Carabiniers Mont-Royal), CEF) on the Reserve order of battle. The reserve unit was disbanded on 14 December 1936.

On 4 May 1951, Les Fusiliers Mont-Royal mobilized two temporary Active Force companies designated &quot;E&quot; and &quot;F&quot; Company. &quot;E&quot; Company was reduced to nil strength upon its personnel being incorporated into the 1st Canadian Infantry Battalion (later the 3rd Battalion, The Canadian Guards) for service in Germany with the North Atlantic Treaty Organization. It was disbanded on 29 July 1953. &quot;F&quot; Company was initially used as a reinforcement pool for &quot;E&quot; Company. On 15 May 1952, it was reduced to nil strength, upon its personnel being absorbed by the newly formed 2nd Canadian Infantry Battalion (later the 4th Battalion, The Canadian Guards) for service in Korea with the United Nations. &quot;F&quot; Company was disbanded on 29 July 1953.

<text>BBC Prime was the BBC&#x27;s general entertainment TV channel in Europe, Middle East, Africa, South Asia and Asia Pacific from 30 January 1995 until 11 November 2009, when it was replaced by BBC Entertainment.

The network was the result of BBC World Service Television&#x27;s split up, making the channel and BBC World (now known as BBC News).

==Launch==
BBC Prime officially started at 7:00pm GMT on Thursday, 26 January 1995 when the former BBC World Service Television was officially opening to split into two separate television stations:
*BBC World (since renamed to BBC News): 24-hour English free-to-air terrestrial international news channel: news bulletins, information, business and financial news magazines and current affairs programmes on 26 January 1995.
* BBC Prime (since replaced by BBC Entertainment): 24-hour English cable lifestyle, variety and entertainment channel: variety, culture, leisure, lifestyle, art and light entertainment programmes on 30 January 1995.

The goal was part of a new BBC strategy for Europe, in which the former service was to be split and given over to European Channel Management, the joint-venture created with Pearson. The goal was to reach 10 million households in Europe by year-end 1995; the existing service reached 2.3 million households. 75% of the output was drawn in from the BBC, while the remaining 25% came from Thames.

On 4 March 1999, BBC Prime launched in sub-Saharan Africa, on the DStv platform.

The channel was removed from HOT at the end of 2006 in Israel, being replaced by ethnic channels for the Ethiopian (IETV) and Georgian (GTV) diasporas. Some of its programmes were made available on HOT&#x27;s video-on-demand service.

==Programming==
The channel broadcast drama, comedy and lifestyle programmes which it repeated on a monthly basis. Every day since the channel&#x27;s 2000 rebrand, it allocated six hours per day to educational programmes from BBC Learning (shown in the European small hours, between 01:00 and 07:00 CET); this practice was abandoned on 23 July 2006 &quot;with the intention of improving the relevance and appeal of the channel to the widest audience&quot;. It also included a special children&#x27;s strand, using the CBBC brand and idents, by the name of CBBC on BBC Prime, or CBBC Prime.

When it first launched, BBC Prime also carried programming from the former ITV company Thames Television, since BBC Worldwide had a joint venture with Thames&#x27;s parent company, Pearson and Cox Communications, known as European Channel Management. This was dissolved in 1998, when the BBC became the sole owner of the channel, as its sister service BBC World was struggling financially. Pearson and Cox, on their behalf, were heavily dissatisfied with the BBC&#x27;s management ethos.

BBC Prime explained their decision to schedule older programmes in addition to newer ones: &quot;For the majority of our viewers, who are European and African nationals, this is the first chance to see these programmes, and often the only way to view them.&quot;

==Funding==
Unlike the BBC&#x27;s domestic channels, and some of their foreign channels paid for by the UK Foreign Office, BBC Prime was funded by subscription available either as part of a satellite package or as a stand-alone channel. It was also funded by adverts placed on the channel in breaks, and because of this, it was not available in the UK. Much of BBC Prime&#x27;s programming was available to watch through BBC One, Two or the UKTV network, part owned by the BBC and showing archive programming.

== Presentation ==
BBC Prime&#x27;s first ident consisted of five different diamonds shining, at first by each other, and then all of them, in a black background, with the BBC Prime logo placed in the bottom right corner. The logo at the time had the BBC logo, with &quot;Prime&quot; written in all capitals below in the Trajan Bold font. The ident had another version which had a jazz-styled music.

After the BBC went on its major rebrand, on 4 October 1997, BBC Prime rebranded for the first time. The logo now had the BBC blocks, with &quot;Prime&quot; in all capitals in the Gill Sans font next to it. The idents were designed by Martin Lambie-Nairn (along with the whole 1997 BBC branding) and start with epileptic water scenes with full of colours, before settling on the main part of the ident, which features the water in a blue to orange gradient with ripples and two marbles, reflected and inverted by each other. The logo is placed at the bottom.

On 4 December 2000, BBC Prime rebranded for the second time, also created by Lambie-Nairn. The idents were known as &quot;Festival&quot; and featured cartoon draws of famous UK sights, like the Big Ben, the Tower Bridge or the Stonehenge, shooting fireworks, followed by the looped, 15-second long sequence with exploding firework animations. The idents had a xylophone-and-trumpet music, with firework sounds playing in the background. Like the 1997 idents, the logo is placed at the bottom.

BBC Prime&#x27;s final rebrand took place on 23 July 2006 with BBC Learning&#x27;s discontinuation. The logo featured the 1997 logo being placed inside a turquoise circle (although the 1997 logo remained in use as the DOG). The idents consisted of differently coloured circles as people who do different situations, like going on a rollercoaster, jumping and swimming in the pool, or the grass being clipped with a lawnmower. These idents were used until BBC Prime was completely replaced by BBC Entertainment on 11 November 2009.

==Availability==

The channel was available in many areas through satellite and cable television
*In the Netherlands and Belgium, the channel was available on cable, alongside BBC One, BBC Two and BBC World News.
*It was available on digital terrestrial television (DTT) in the Netherlands and Malta.
*In Gibraltar, GBC relayed BBC Prime on its VHF and UHF channels with opt-outs. The terrestrial simulcast was cut in 1999 due to scheduling problems at GBC.
*In Turkey, it was available on Türksat Cable TV and Digiturk.
*In Italy, it was available on SKY Italia.
*In MENA, it was available on the Orbit Network Bahrain.
*The South Africa service was launched in 1999 and contained some different programmes to that broadcast in Europe, due to some programmes already being licensed to other channels.
*The Asia service was launched on 1 December 2004 and had a different schedule to that of the Europe service to reflect the different time zones, and cultural practices. It was available in Hong Kong (on Now TV&#x27;s Channel 529), Thailand (on TrueVisions&#x27; (Channel 35), Singapore (on StarHub TV&#x27;s Channel 76) and South Korea (on Skylife&#x27;s Channel 334).

In order to cater to a wider audience, who do not have English as their first language, BBC Prime carried subtitles in Swedish, Danish, Norwegian, Czech, Polish, Romanian, Hungarian, Italian, Hebrew and Serbian. The Asian service also had subtitles in Chinese, Thai, and Korean.

A similar channel, called BBC Japan, launched in Japan on 1 December 2004, but ceased broadcasting on 30 April 2006 owing to problems with its local distributor.

==Replacement==
In September 2006 it was announced that the BBC Prime brand was to be phased out and replaced by BBC Entertainment, one of a number of new international channels planned by BBC Worldwide.

The process began with the Asian services, which switched on 6 October 2006, followed by the South African service on 1 September 2008. BBC Prime was completely replaced by BBC Entertainment on 11 November 2009.

<text>François Edouard Joachim Coppée (; 26 January 1842 – 23 May 1908) was a French poet and novelist.

== Biography ==
Coppée was born in Paris to a civil servant. After attending the Lycée Saint-Louis he became a clerk in the ministry of war and won public favour as a poet of the Parnassian school. His first printed verses date from 1864. In 1869, his &quot;Poème modernes&quot; (among others &quot;La Grève de forgerons&quot;) were quite successful. In the same year, Coppée&#x27;s first play, &quot;Le Passant&quot;, starring Sarah Bernhardt and Madame Agar, was received with approval at the Odéon theatre, and later &quot;Fais ce que dois&quot; (1871) and &quot;Les Bijoux de la délivrance&quot; (1872), short poetic dramas inspired by the Franco-Prussian War, were applauded.

After holding a post in the library of the senate, Coppée was chosen in 1878 as archivist of the Comédie Française, an office he held till 1884. In that year, his election to the Académie française caused him to retire from all public appointments. He was made an officer of the Legion of Honour in 1888.

Coppée was famed as &quot;le poète des humbles&quot; (the poet of the humble). His verse and prose focus on plain expressions of emotion, patriotism, the joy of young love, and the pitifulness of the poor. Coppée continued to write plays, mostly serious dramas in verse, two of which were composed in collaboration with Armand d&#x27;Artois. The performance of a short episode of the Commune, &quot;Le Pater&quot;, was prohibited by the government in 1889. Coppée published his first prose work in 1875 and went on to publish short stories, an autobiography of his youth, a series of short articles on miscellaneous subjects, and &quot;La Bonne Souffrance,&quot; a popular account of his reconversion to the Roman Catholic Church. His conversion was due to a severe illness which twice brought him close to death.

Coppée was also interested in public affairs, joining the most violent section of the Nationalist movement (while remaining contemptuous of the apparatus of democracy) and taking a leading part against Alfred Dreyfus in the Dreyfus affair.
He was one of the founders of the Ligue de la patrie française, which originated in 1898 with three young academics, Louis Dausset, Gabriel Syveton and Henri Vaugeois, who wanted to show that Dreyfusism was not accepted by all at the University.
They launched a petition that attacked Émile Zola and what many saw as an internationalist, pacifist left-wing conspiracy.
Charles Maurras gained the interest of the writer Maurice Barrès, and the movement gained the support of three eminent personalities: the geographer Marcel Dubois, the poet François Coppée and the critic and literature professor Jules Lemaître.

== Criticism ==
The poet Arthur Rimbaud, a young contemporary of Coppée, published numerous parodies of Coppée&#x27;s poetry. Rimbaud&#x27;s parodies were published in &quot;L&#x27;Album Zutique&quot; (in 1871? 1872?). Most of these poems parody the style (&quot;chatty comfortable rhymes&quot; that were &quot;the delight of the enlightened bourgeois of the day&quot;) and form (alexandrine couplets arranged in ten line verses) of some short poems by Coppée. Rimbaud published them under the name &quot;François Coppée&quot;.

The poet Lautréamont cited his &quot;Grève de Forgerons&quot; in the list of the &quot;penpushers&quot; to be absolutely ignored (&quot;Poèsie, Part I&quot;).

<text>Claude Joseph Dorat (31 December 1734 – 29 April 1780) was a French writer, also known as Le Chevalier Dorat.

He was born in Paris, of a family consisting of generations of lawyers, and he joined the corps of the king&#x27;s musketeers. He became fashionable for his work, &quot;Réponse d&#x27;Abélard à Héloise&quot; (&quot;Abelard&#x27;s Answer to Heloise&quot;), and followed up this first success with a number of heroic epistles, &quot;Les Victimes de l&#x27;amour, ou lettres de quelques amants célébres&quot; (1776) (&quot;Victims of Love, or Letters from some famous lovers&quot;).

Besides light verse he wrote comedies, fables and, among other novels, &quot;Les Sacrifices de lamour, ou lettres de la vicomtesse de Senanges et du chevalier de Versenay&quot; (1771). He tried to cover his failures as a dramatist by buying up large numbers of seats for performances, and his books were lavishly illustrated by good artists and expensively produced, in order to secure their success. Nevertheless, he managed to attract hatred both of the &quot;philosophe&quot; party as well as of their arch-enemy, Charles Palissot de Montenoy, and thus cut himself off from the possibility of academic honours. &quot;Le Tartufe littéraire&quot; (1774) attacked La Harpe and Palissot, and at the same time D&#x27;Alembert and Mlle de Lespinasse.

<text>V&amp;S Group (&quot;V&amp;S Vin &amp; Sprit AB&quot;), founded in 1917, is an international producer and distributor of alcoholic beverages. The group is currently owned by Pernod Ricard. Headquartered in Stockholm, the capital of Sweden, the group employs approximately 2,500 people.

Until 1994, the group had the position of a national alcohol monopoly for production and distribution, but this was abolished when Sweden joined the European Union in 1995. However, the Swedish alcohol retailing monopoly, operated by Systembolaget, is still in force. On March 31, 2008 it was announced that the Swedish government intended to sell V &amp; S Group to Pernod Ricard for 5.626 billion euro, corresponding to 55 billion Swedish kronor. The deal was approved and finalized on July 24, 2008 at an estimated value of 5.69 billion euro.

The abbreviation &quot;V&amp;S&quot; comes from the name &quot;Vin &amp; Sprit&quot;, literally meaning &quot;Wine &amp; Liquor.&quot;

==Organization and brands==
V&amp;S Group is divided into three main areas:

*&quot;V&amp;S Absolute Spirits&quot; handles Absolut Vodka and the other international spirits brands, such as Level Vodka, Frïs Vodka.
*&quot;V&amp;S Distillers&quot; handles spirits on the Northern and Central European markets.
*&quot;V&amp;S Wine&quot; handles wines and fortified wines in the Nordic region.

==Production and distribution==
The production of the group&#x27;s international spirits takes place in Sweden, Denmark, Great Britain, and St. Croix, U.S. Virgin Islands. Production of their local and regional spirits takes place primarily in Sweden, Denmark, Finland, Germany, and Poland. In Northern Europe, V&amp;S Group is the largest importer and distributor of wine. The group offers their own brands of wine and also produces brands by well-known international companies.

Distribution in the Nordic area is primarily handled through the group&#x27;s distribution centers in Sweden, Denmark, and Finland. V&amp;S Group is represented by the subsidiary V&amp;S Norway in Norway, by V&amp;S Eesti in Estonia, and by the company V&amp;S Luksusowa Zielona Góra in Poland. In the United States, distribution was handled by Future Brands, LLC, a joint-venture with Fortune Brands. In most other regions of the world, distribution was handled by Maxxium, which was also partly owned by the group.

==Sales==
About three-quarters of the group&#x27;s sales come from spirits, whereas the remaining quarter comes from wine. Vodka is their largest selling spirit, in which Absolut holds the highest sales figures. Geographically, North America is the group&#x27;s single biggest market, accounting for 43% of total sales in 2007. The Swedish market accounts for one-sixth of sales. As volume is concerned, the group sold 158.4 million liters of spirits and 83.7 million liters of wine, totaling 242.1 million liters of product.

Alliance also received licenses for channels including National Geographic, IFC, and The Health Network, launched as Discovery Health. The channel was launched on 7 September 2001 as a joint venture between AAC and BBC Worldwide.

To promote the launch of BBC Canada&#x27;s 2007 fall season, a 16-page British-style tabloid insert called the &quot;BBC Telly&quot; was published in the &quot;Toronto Star&quot;. Toronto-based Pilot PMR created the campaign.

On 28 January 2008, a joint venture between Canwest and Goldman Sachs Capital Partners known as CW Media bought Alliance Atlantis and gained AAC&#x27;s interest in BBC Canada. On 27 October 2010, the channel&#x27;s ownership changed once again as Shaw Communications gained control of BBC Canada as a result of its acquisition of Canwest and Goldman Sachs&#x27; interest in CW Media.

On 13 May 2011, BBC Canada was separated from the now-defunct children&#x27;s channel BBC Kids due to its ownership changing hands to Knowledge Network.

On 1 April 2016, Shaw Media was sold to Corus Entertainment. BBC Canada also earned several sister networks to go with the existing ones.

In a notice to subscribers posted in early November 2020, Corus sister company Shaw Direct indicated that the channel would be shutting down on 31 December 2020.

In March 2021, Blue Ant Media, a company owned by former Alliance Atlantis executive Michael MacMillan which already owns the Canadian version of BBC Earth, announced that its HIFI channel would be rebranded as a Canadian version of the BBC&#x27;s international entertainment channel brand BBC First on March 16. Several programs that had been carried by BBC Canada prior to its closure, including &quot;Top Gear&quot; and &quot;Antiques Roadshow&quot;, were picked up by BBC First.

==Programming==

While BBC Canada was part-owned by the BBC, not all of the BBC&#x27;s programmes aired on BBC Canada. In general, while BBC Worldwide and its affiliated operations have a &quot;first look&quot; at the corporation&#x27;s output, this right only applies so long as BBC Worldwide pays no less than what the BBC Commercial Agency, which is at arm&#x27;s length, judges to be a particular property&#x27;s value. Furthermore, while BBC Canada served a similar purpose to the BBC America channel available in the United States, there are also significant differences between the programming rights owned by the two channels.

This meant that much of the BBC&#x27;s output (and, for that matter, BBC America&#x27;s original programming) aired on other Canadian channels which have either co-produced the programmes or simply bid more for the Canadian broadcast rights. Conversely, many of the British series that did air on the channel are not sourced from the BBC, with some having originally been produced by or aired on other British channels, such as the privately owned ITV or the independent public-service broadcaster Channel 4.

Despite its British focus, BBC Canada was licensed as a Canadian channel and was not exempt from the CRTC&#x27;s broadcasting regulations that required it to carry a quota of Canadian content. This meant that in addition to British programmes, it also broadcast a number of Canadian series, which according to the channel&#x27;s licence were required to &quot;explore or [be] informed by Canada&#x27;s relationship to the United Kingdom and the Commonwealth&quot;. Canadian programmes that aired on the channel included repeats of &quot;Disaster DIY&quot; and &quot;Holmes Inspection&quot;. In the early 2010s, the channel began airing American series featuring British personalities, such as the American version of the Gordon Ramsay programme &quot;Kitchen Nightmares&quot; (it has also in the past carried the British parent series &quot;Ramsay&#x27;s Kitchen Nightmares&quot;), and repeat airings of the American dramas &quot;House&quot; and &quot;Elementary&quot; (each of which has a British actor in the lead role).

Many of the channel&#x27;s programmes, whether British, American or Canadian, were shared with other Corus Entertainment channels such as the Global Television Network, Showcase, HGTV Canada and Food Network Canada.

BBC Canada did not ordinarily carry BBC News programming, as the BBC World News channel is also widely available in Canada, and BBC News also has a long-standing content-sharing agreement with the CBC. On the rare occasions that BBC Canada did carry news coverage, coverage may have been produced by Corus-owned Global News instead of the BBC, such as with the wedding of Prince William and Catherine Middleton.

==BBC Canada HD==
In October 2016, Corus Entertainment launched BBC Canada HD, a 1080i high definition simulcast of the standard definition feed. The HD feed was only available on Telus Optik TV and Shaw Direct. The HD simulcast was shut down on 31 December 2020.

==Related properties==
Apart from the television channel, BBC Worldwide directly operates a BBC Canada Shop website which sells merchandise related to British television series such as &quot;Top Gear&quot;, &quot;Little Britain&quot; and &quot;Doctor Who&quot;.

<doc id="360177" wikidata="Q450354" url="?curid=360177" title="Jeanne Julie Éléonore de Lespinasse">
<text>Jeanne Julie Éléonore de Lespinasse (9 November 1732 – 23 May 1776) was a French salon holder and letter writer. She held a prominent salon in Paris during the Enlightenment. She is best-known today, however, for her letters, first published in 1809, which offer compelling accounts of two tragic love affairs.

==Early life==
Julie-Jeanne-Éléonore de Lespinasse was born in Lyon, the illegitimate daughter of Julie-Claude-Hilaire d’Albon, who was the sole heir of an old family. Her mother, who was married to the Comte d&#x27;Albon, separated from her husband at the time of her birth, and the baby was baptized as the daughter of two fictitious persons, &#x27;Claude Lespinasse&#x27; and his wife &#x27;Julie Navarre&#x27;. The mystery of who her father really was did not get cleared up until her first careful biographer, the Marquis de Ségur (Pierre Marie Maurice Henri marquis de Ségur, 1853-1916), established that she was the daughter of Gaspard de Vichy-Chamrond, whose sister, Marie Anne de Vichy-Chamrond, marquise du Deffand, ran a famous Paris salon.

Looked down on for her poverty and illegitimate birth, Mlle de Lespinasse had an unhappy childhood marked by neglect. She acquired a basic education at a convent, but she was largely self-educated, an impressive feat given that she was later able to hold her own among France&#x27;s top intellectuals. In 1754, Madame du Deffand, who recognized her niece&#x27;s extraordinary gifts, persuaded her to come to Paris as her companion.

==The salons==
Julie moved into Mme du Deffand&#x27;s apartments in the Convent of St. Joseph, where Mme du Deffand&#x27;s salon attracted diplomats, aristocrats, philosophers, and politicians. The relationship lasted ten years until 1764, when Mme du Deffand became jealous of the younger woman&#x27;s increasing influence with the younger generation of salon attendees and a quarrel resulted.

Mlle de Lespinasse then set up a salon of her own that attracted many of the same people who had attended Mme du Deffand&#x27;s salon. The mathematician and writer Jean le Rond d&#x27;Alembert became a close friend, joined her new salon, and eventually came to live in her house, although they were not romantically involved. This arrangement lent further influence to Mlle de Lespinasse&#x27;s salon, which became a center for writers of the &quot;Encyclopédie&quot;. Diderot, for example, made her a protagonist of his controversial philosophical dialogues entitled &quot;D&#x27;Alembert&#x27;s Dream&quot;. Although she had neither wealth nor rank and was not an outstanding beauty, Mlle de Lespinasse had intellect, charm, and ability as a hostess, qualities that made her salon gatherings the most popular in Paris. Her continuing notability is due less to her social success, however, than to a literary talent that remained a secret during her lifetime, even from her closest friends.

==Letters==
Two volumes of Mlle de Lespinasse&#x27;s letters, first published in 1809, displayed her as a writer of rare intensity. The literary critic Charles Augustin Sainte-Beuve ranks her letters with those by Héloïse and with the &quot;Letters of a Portuguese Nun&quot; (the latter now believed to be epistolary fiction rather than real letters). Other writers, focusing on her theme of passionate love rather than on genre, place her work alongside that of novelists such as Abbé Prévost and Jean-Jacques Rousseau.

Mlle de Lespinasse&#x27;s letters center on her great and thwarted love for two men: Don José María Pignatelli y Gonzaga, Marquis de Mora, who was the son of Joaquín Pignatelli, Spanish ambassador in Paris, and Jacques-Antoine-Hippolyte, Comte de Guibert, a French general and writer. Less dispassionately philosophical than those by such later eighteenth century letter writers as Madame de Stael, they offer a portrait of someone who saw herself as a tragic heroine sacrificing all for love.

===Letters to the Marquis de Mora===
Mlle de Lespinasse first met the Marquis de Mora about two years after establishing her own salon. Encountering him again two years later, she fell in love with him, and he fully returned her feelings. He began to suffer symptoms of tuberculosis, however, and returned to Spain for his health. Mlle de Lespinasse&#x27;s letters reveal the pain she experienced from the separation and her anxiety over Mora&#x27;s poor health. On the way back to Paris in 1774 to fulfill promises exchanged with Mlle de Lespinasse, the marquis died at Bordeaux at the age of 30.

===Letters to the Comte de Guibert===
Soon after the Marquis de Mora returned to Spain, Mlle de Lespinasse became acquainted with the man who would become the main passion of her life, the Comte de Guibert, then a colonel. Her letters to Guibert began in 1773 and soon record her as torn between her affection for Mora and her new infatuation. Later letters describe her partial disenchantment occasioned by Guibert&#x27;s marriage to another woman in 1775 and her increasing despair.

==Death==
By early 1776, Mlle de Lespinasse was in a state of mental and physical collapse, apparently caused by the misery of her relationship with Guibert. She had earlier shown depressive tendencies and a consequent dependence on opium may have aggravated her breakdown. On her deathbed, she refused to receive Guibert and instead, was watched over by her friend d&#x27;Alembert. She died on 22 May 1776 in Paris at the age of 43, possibly of tuberculosis. Her last words are said to have been &quot;Am I still alive?&quot;

==Publications==
Following the first publication of Mlle de Lespinasse&#x27;s &quot;Letters&quot; in 1809, a spurious additional collection appeared in 1820. Some later editions included a portrait of her written by her friend d&#x27;Alembert. Modern editions include that of Eugène Asse (1876–77). An 1887 collection edited M. Charles Henry, &quot;Lettres inédités de Mademoiselle de Lespinasse à Condorcet, à D&#x27;Alembert, à Guibert, au comte de Crillon&quot;, contains copies of the documents available for her biography.

In addition to the &quot;Letters&quot;, she was the author of two unpublished chapters intended as a kind of sequel to Laurence Sterne&#x27;s &quot;Sentimental Journey&quot;.

==In popular culture==
Julie Le Breton, a protagonist in Mary Augusta Ward&#x27;s novel &quot;Lady Rose&#x27;s Daughter&quot; is said to owe something to the character of Mlle de Lespinasse.

The novelist Naomi Royde-Smith wrote a well-received biography, &quot;The Double Heart: A Study of Julie de Lespinasse&quot; (1931).

<text>&#x27; (, &quot;the System Company&quot;), colloquially known as &#x27; (&quot;the system&quot;) or  (&quot;the company&quot;), is a government-owned chain of liquor stores in Sweden. It is the only retail store allowed to sell alcoholic beverages that contain more than 3.5% alcohol by volume. Systembolaget acts as a portal for private companies selling alcohol on the Swedish market and , it represents 1,200 vendors ranging from small local breweries to large scale importers and multinational companies, selling products from a total of over 5,000 producers from all over the world.

Systembolaget also sells non-alcoholic beverages, although this product segment represents less than half a percent of the company&#x27;s total sales of beverages. The minimum age to buy alcohol at Systembolaget is 20 years. At Swedish restaurants and bars the legal age to buy alcoholic beverages is 18 years, though bars and clubs may voluntarily set an age limit higher than 18 if they prefer.

Systembolaget&#x27;s stores must close no later than 20:00 on weekdays and 15:00 on Saturdays. On Sundays and public holidays all Systembolaget&#x27;s stores are closed. Systembolaget&#x27;s stores are also closed on Christmas Eve and Midsummer Eve.

==Governing laws==

There are several laws and rules governing how Systembolaget stores operate, such as:
* All products, including beer cans and bottles (except products that are not kept in stock and have to be pre-ordered), are sold individually. Pre-ordered products may sometimes only be sold in quantities corresponding with the minimum order accepted by the manufacturer. Some traditional Swedish shots are also sold in holiday packs.
* Discounts, such as &quot;Buy 1, get 1 free&quot; and &quot;One can 20 kr two cans 30 kr&quot; type deals, are prohibited.
* No product may be favoured over another, which in practice means that the beers are not refrigerated, since otherwise all beer would have to be refrigerated which is too expensive.
* The minimum age to purchase beverages above 3.5% alcohol is 20 years of age. A main reason to have Systembolaget as a monopoly is to enforce this age limit. Several tests have shown that restaurants and food shops often sell 3.5% beer to people below the minimum legal age of 18.
* People who look under 25 have to show an identity document. This has to be certified identity cards or driving licenses from the Nordic countries, national identity card from an EU/EEA country or be a passport.
* Systembolaget is not allowed to sell alcoholic beverages to drunk people or to people that they have reason to believe are purchasing for someone under legal age.
* In villages too small for a profitable Systembolaget shop and too far away from a shop, Systembolaget contracts food shops to sell alcohol. Such alcohol must be sold on demand and not on shelves among other food or beverages.
Systembolaget has a strict monopoly status on alcohol sales to consumers in Sweden, with the following exceptions:
* Restaurant and bars can sell alcohol for consumption on site, which customers are not permitted to take away from the premises (bottles are opened by staff). In other countries people are able to take a bottle of wine home if there is some left over at the end of their meal, but in Sweden it must be consumed or wasted.
* Private imports for a consumer&#x27;s own consumption are allowed, based on EU regulations and court cases, both during private travel and by post. However, Sweden is able to levy taxes on recipients of alcohol sent by post.
* Other companies (producers and importers) can sell directly to restaurant and bars (EU enforced rule).
* Producers of alcohol, such as vineyards, are not allowed to sell their products directly to consumers, but have the right to sell them through the nearest Systembolaget shops if they are not large enough for nationwide sales. This was a point of debate in the 2022 election, and the new government has proposed a law to allow such shops, which they plan to be in force during 2025.
* Export and duty-free shops at airports can sell alcohol to people checked in for a flight outside the EU. Alcohol cannot be sold in shops on boats on Swedish waters, but the shop is opened at the border to international or foreign waters.

As part of their accession to the European Union in 1995, Sweden and Finland are the only two EU member states granted an exception of free trade agreements allowing state-run alcohol monopolies.

==Taxation and pricing==
As with other government-owned monopolies within free-trade areas, there are several aspects that govern the operation. All product selections and displays must be based on customer preferences, and every producer and distributor must be handled the same way. All marketing activities must be for the company itself and its own services, never for an individual product. This is also the reason why all products are taxed on alcohol content, not on price, and that all products are sold with the same profit margin. This explains why an off-brand vodka can be seen as very expensive when compared to a premium-brand spirit bottle of a similar size.

Beer is not so highly taxed anymore in order to protect Swedish breweries and their employment opportunities against purchase during travel abroad. It is () 2.12 SEK per % alcohol and liter, which means 5.3 SEK for a 5% beer can (50 cl). Such a can usually costs about 10 SEK (0.88 EUR) at Systembolaget. For wine, the tax increases based on the wine&#x27;s alcohol by volume. For 12% wine, the tax is 27.49 SEK per liter. For distilled products, the tax is 5.2697 SEK per % and liter (526.97 SEK per liter alcohol, or 263.48 SEK for 1 liter of 50%).
==History==

In 1766 the Swedish king, Adolf Frederick, decided, after several unsuccessful attempts at regulating alcohol consumption, to abolish all restrictions. This led to virtually every household making and selling alcohol.

At the turn of the 19th century, alcohol was highly popular among Swedes. An estimated 175,000 home distilleries had developed by this time, using tremendous amounts of grain and potatoes that otherwise would have been consumed as food to manufacture alcohol. It was later said that most men in Sweden abused alcohol. Women rarely drank alcohol, since it was considered inappropriate.

In 1830, the first moderate drinking society was started in Stockholm. In 1837, the Svenska Sällskapet för Nykterhet och Folkbildning (The Swedish Society for Temperance and Public Education) was founded as the country&#x27;s first fully-fledged temperance organization. It was immediately promoted by the King, and quickly grew to 10,000 members with local chapters around the country. The Church of Sweden also strongly promoted temperance. Private gain from selling alcohol was strongly criticised by these groups; this opinion was embraced by doctors and members of the Church of Sweden. In 1850, the state began to regulate alcohol. In the city of Falun, a regional organization was established to regulate all alcohol sales in the city and ensure that sales were being done responsibly.

In 1860, a bar was opened in Gothenburg where the state had handpicked the employees and decided how the bar should be run; antisocial and or intoxicated people were to be excluded. This was where people both bought and drank their alcohol, and this subsequently became the foundation for the Gothenburg Public House System used in Norway, Finland and the UK. This was also the year it became illegal to sell to people under the age of 18. Similar state-regulated bars and stores began to open in other towns across the country, and they were hugely successful. Originally the profits were kept privately by the owners, but in 1870 it was decided that all profits should go to the state.

During the First World War, alcohol was strictly rationed. Thus, the state bars and stores started registering purchases. People were allowed only two liters of liquor every three months, and beer above 3.6% ABV (2.8% ABW) was banned. After the war, the rationing continued, using the Bratt System of a household ration book called a . Gender, income, wealth and social status decided how much alcohol one was allowed to buy. Unemployed people and welfare recipients were not allowed to buy any alcohol at all, while as the was issued by household instead of per person, it meant that wives had to share their household allowance with their husbands and in effect got nothing at all. In 1917, &quot;Aktiebolaget Spritcentralen&quot; (now V&amp;S Group) was formed to take over all wholesale distribution of alcohol. A referendum on prohibition in 1922 advised government not to issue total prohibition. The rationing system was very unpopular. When even the temperance movement protested against it (they felt it encouraged consumption), the government decided a new policy was needed.

In 1955, all regional alcohol monopolies &quot;(Systemaktiebolaget)&quot; were merged into the present-day Systembolaget enterprise, and the above-mentioned rationing system was abolished, so people were allowed to start buying as much alcohol as they wanted from Systembolaget stores (as long as they are sober, over 21 and not suspected of buying for later private resale). This led to increased consumption, so the government increased taxes heavily and made it compulsory that everyone had to show ID to get served. There was also an age limit of 21, which in 1969 was lowered to 20. In 1965, it became legal for privately run stores to sell beer up to 4.5% with an age limit of 18. 12 years later, after alcohol consumption – especially that of light beers (&quot;mellanöl&quot;) – rose dramatically, the limit was lowered to 3.5%.

Originally, Systembolaget customers were required to ask shop attendants or use desk service to retrieve desired products. This policy was based on the hypothesis that personal, face-to-face interaction would discourage patrons from buying in conspicuous quantities. Customers would not be permitted to serve themselves until 1991. This self service policy was gradually and subsequently expanded into all Systembolaget stores between 1991 and 2014. The last Systembolaget store to convert to self service was the branch at Högdalen in southern Stockholm, which was converted in October 2014. Still, several shops have their hard alcohol at the checkout where customers need to ask for it.

In September 1996, Systembolaget began sales of bag-in-box cask wine after the European Court of Justice ruled in favour of the Swedish brewery Spendrups who complained that Systembolaget&#x27;s earlier refusal to sell boxed wine violated the EU&#x27;s free trade agreement with Sweden. By the mid-2000s boxed wine accounted for over half the volume of wine sold at Systembolaget.

In 2003, an almost free quota (for personal use) was allowed when traveling into Sweden from another EU country, resulting in lower sales for Systembolaget, especially in Scania, which borders Denmark by sea with a bridge. Increase in Danish prices has resulted in people driving to Germany instead for purchase. Some cars have been stopped by Swedish police for overweight but not for alcohol import, since four people are collectively allowed to have a total of 800 liters of beer and wine, which is above the allowed load of many standard cars.

In June 2007, the European Court of Justice ruled that restrictions on the private import of alcohol by postal package were unjustified; as a result, Sweden allowed this some time after.

Swedish municipalities retain the right to ban the establishment of Systembolaget shops within their jurisdiction. This has become much rarer over time, because of a more liberal political attitude and the belief that other shops lose customers when people drive to other municipalities for shopping.

==Corruption controversy==

A massive corruption scandal (&quot;Systembolagshärvan&quot;) first gained widespread media attention in the autumn of 2003, with Systembolaget issuing its first press release regarding the preliminary investigations on 7 November 2003. On 11 February 2005, 77 managers of Systembolaget stores were charged with receiving bribes from suppliers, and one of the largest trials in modern Swedish history followed. 18 managers were found guilty on 19 December, and then on 23 February another 15 managers were found guilty.

In January 2009 allegations were aimed against Fondberg &amp; Co, the second largest supplier of wine to Systembolaget with a market share of 8.5%, concerning large payments made to the Gibraltar firm Bodegas, and are under investigation by the Swedish Tax Agency.

==Advertisements==
Systembolaget makes advertisements on the side effects of drinking, and ones to encourage moderate consumption of alcohol. Many of their ads aim to stop teenagers obtaining alcohol and to encourage those under 25 to voluntarily show identification when purchasing. In November 2008, Systembolaget launched a campaign where people under 25 would get a free pack of chewing gum with a &quot;Thank you for showing ID&quot; compliment, if they showed ID to the cashier before they were asked to.

Systembolaget is not allowed to advertise its products to increase sales. However, since 2005 the producers are allowed to advertise their products in Sweden (only products of less than 15% alcohol, and not on radio and TV).

== Public opinion ==
According to a study conducted by David Karlsson, Sören Holmberg and Lennart Weibul in 2023, 59% of Swedes support that alcoholic beverages can still be purchased only in Systembolaget stores, and this proportion is constantly increasing.

<text>Apoteket AB is a state-owned pharmaceuticals retailer in Sweden which formerly held a monopoly on the retail sale of medicines in the country. Formerly known as Apoteksbolaget, the company is a government owned enterprise reporting to the Ministry of Finance.

==History==
The company was founded in 1970 under the name &quot;Apoteksbolaget AB&quot;. In 1998 the name was changed to the current one, &quot;Apoteket AB&quot;.

On 1 July 2009, the government monopoly was lifted, allowing the opening of private pharmacies in Sweden. The Swedish government cited the fact of Sweden being the only democracy, along with Cuba and North Korea, to retain its monopoly as an argument for its abolishment.

<text>George Foot Moore (October 15, 1851 – May 16, 1931) was an American historian of religion, author, professor, and Presbyterian minister.

==Life==
Moore was born in West Chester, Pennsylvania, the son of Rev. William Eves Moore and Harriet Foot Moore. He was educated at private schools, West Chester Academy and Wyer&#x27;s School, entered Yale College as a junior in 1870, then graduated from Yale in 1872, as a Phi Beta Kappa and member of the Skull and Bones society. After teaching at Hopkins Grammar School from 1872 to 1873, he engaged in study and private teaching in Columbus, Ohio, 1873–74, then served as principal of Lancaster (Ohio) High School 1874-75. He studied theology in Columbus 1875-76 and graduated from Union Theological Seminary (New York) in 1877. He was ordained to the Presbyterian ministry at Columbus February 8, 1878, and became pastor of Putnam Presbyterian Church in Zanesville, Ohio, from 1878 to 1883. He Married Mary Soper, daughter of Albert Gallatin and Mary Ann (Chester) Hanford on April 25, 1878, in Chicago. They had two sons, William Eves, who died in infancy, and Albert Hanford.

In 1883 he was appointed to the chair of Hebrew at Andover Theological Seminary where he taught until 1902, serving as president of the seminary from 1899 to 1901 and lectured on the history of religion from 1893 to 1901. During his service to Andover, he received the degree of Doctor of Divinity in 1885 from Marietta College, Ohio, and 12 years later, from Yale University in 1897. In 1902, he became a professor at the Harvard Divinity School, where he was appointed Frothingham Professor of the History of Religion in 1905, and Cabot Fellow for three years beginning in 1906. During his service at Harvard he obtained a degree of Legum Doctor in 1903 from Western Reserve University. He was a member of Harvard faculty from 1902 until retirement in 1928 and a preacher to the University from 1900 to 1903.

Moore was a member of the Deutsche Morgenlandische Gesellschaft, American Philological Association, Archaeological Institute of America, Society of Biblical Literature, among others, In addition, he was a Fellow of the American Academy of Arts and Sciences, serving as its president from 1921 to 1924, and was a member of both the American Oriental Society and the American Philosophical Society. Besides contributing many articles on Biblical and Oriental subjects in learned journals, he wrote extensively for the &quot;Encyclopaedia Biblica&quot; and served as editor of the &quot;Harvard Theological Review&quot;. Among his books, &quot;History of Religions&quot; (1914, 1919) and &quot;Judaism&quot; (two volumes, 1927) stand out as especially praiseworthy.

Moore served as an interim pastor and preacher at Central Congregational Church in Providence, Rhode Island from 1888-1889. He also preached at the dedication of the new building in 1893, and at the 50th Anniversary of the congregation in 1902.

Mrs. Mary Soper Moore died April 16, 1924. Moore died 7 years later due to general arteriosclerosis and chronic myocarditis, in Cambridge, Massachusetts, May 16, 1931.

<doc id="360194" wikidata="Q268325" url="?curid=360194" title="Mariana Alcoforado">
<text>Sóror Mariana Alcoforado (Santa Maria da Feira, Beja, 22 April 1640Beja, 28 July 1723) was a Portuguese nun living in the convent of the Poor Clares (Convento de Nossa Senhora da Conceição, &quot;Convent of Our Lady of the Conception&quot;) in Beja, Portugal.

Debate continues as to whether Mariana was the real Portuguese author of the &quot;Letters of a Portuguese Nun&quot; (comprising five letters). Her purported love affair with the French officer Noël Bouton, Marquis de Chamilly and later Marshal of France, has made Beja famous in literary circles, mainly in Portugal and France.

Some literary scholars consider the letters a fictional work and ascribe their authorship to Gabriel-Joseph de Lavergne, comte de Guilleragues (1628–1684), although a real nun named Mariana Alcoforado indeed existed. In her recent book &quot;Letters of a Portuguese Nun: Uncovering the Mystery Behind a Seventeenth-Century Forbidden Love&quot; (2006), the author Myriam Cyr has attempted to reassert the attribution of the letters to the real Mariana Alcoforado.

==Biography==
: &quot;Note: the following biography is based in large part on the letters and may contain, for that reason, fictionalized elements.&quot;
Mariana Alcoforado was born in Beja, daughter of landed proprietor of Alentejo Francisco da Cunha Alcoforado, born at Cortiços, Macedo de Cavaleiros, and first wife Leonor Mendes. She had three brothers: Baltasar Vaz Alcoforado, Miguel da Cunha Alcoforado and Francisco da Cunha Alcoforado, and two sisters: Anna Maria da Cunha Alcoforado, wife of Rui de Mello Lobo Freire, and Maria Peregrina Alcoforado. Beja was the chief garrison town of the province and the principal theatre of the twenty-eight years&#x27; war with Spain that followed the Portuguese Revolution of 1640. Mariana&#x27;s widowed father, occupied with administrative and military commissions, placed her in the wealthy convent of the Conception for security and education. He later remarried and had two more daughters, Maria da Conceição Alcoforado and Catarina Alcoforado, and was also made a Knight of the Order of Christ on 15 December 1647.
She made her religious profession as a Franciscan nun of the Poor Ladies at sixteen or earlier, without any real vocation, and lived a routine life in that somewhat relaxed house until her twenty-fifth year, when she purportedly met the young French nobleman Noël Bouton. This man, afterwards known as marquis of Chamilly, and marshal of France, was one of the French officers who came to Portugal to serve under the captain, Frederick Schomberg, 1st Duke of Schomberg, the re-organizer of the Portuguese army, campaigning against the Spanish army in the Alentejo.

During the years 1665-1667, the marquis of Chamilly spent much of his time in and about Beja, and probably became acquainted with the Alcoforado family through Sóror Mariana&#x27;s brother, who was a soldier. Custom permitted those in religious orders to receive and entertain visitors, and Chamilly found it easy to get round the trustful nun. Before long their affair became known and caused a scandal, and to avoid the consequences Chamilly deserted Soror Mariana and returned to France. This resulted in Soror Mariana writing the letters.

There are signs in the fifth letter that Soror Mariana had begun to conquer her passion. After a life of rigid penance, accompanied by much suffering, she died, aged 83. Soror Mariana&#x27;s life story has also been described in the novel by Katherine Vaz, &quot;Mariana&quot;, published by Aliform Publishing in 2005.

<doc id="360198" wikidata="Q509971" url="?curid=360198" title="Karl Lennart Oesch">
<text>Karl Lennart Oesch (8 August 1892 – 28 March 1978) was one of Finland&#x27;s leading generals during World War II. He held a string of high staff assignments and front commands, and at the end of the Continuation War commanded three Finnish army corps on the Karelian Isthmus. He received numerous awards, including the Finnish Mannerheim Cross during his service. Following the end of the Continuation War, he was tried and convicted for war crimes relating to the treatment of Soviet prisoners-of-war.

==Early life==
Karl Lennart Oesch was born on 8 August 1892 in Pyhäjärvi to Christian Oesch and Anna Barbara Stegman. His parents were of Swiss origin and had moved to Finland before his birth. He attended school in Sortavala and studied in the Department of Mathematics and Physics at the University of Helsinki from 1911 to 1915.

==Jaeger Movement and Civil War==
Oesch joined the Finnish Jäger Movement, traveling to Germany in 1915. As a member of the Royal Prussian 27th Jäger Battalion, he fought on the German side of World War I on the Eastern Front, participating in combat in the region of Misa. He briefly returned to Finland to recruit more volunteers, before returning to Germany. In 1917, he was promoted &quot;Oberzugführer&quot; ().

He returned to Finland in February 1918 with the main forces of the Finnish Jägers to take part in the Finnish Civil War on the side of the Finnish Whites. During the civil war, Oesch commanded the 8th Jaeger Battalion in the regions of Raasuli and Rautu. 

Oesch&#x27;s battalion saw action especially in the area of the Rautu railway station, which was held by the Finnish Reds who were supported by an armored train. The reds withdrew from the station following multiple White attacks which captured the armored train but failed to capture the station area. Oesch reported that the withdrawal resulted in significant casualties, with 1200 Reds killed and 600–800 captured. The 8th Jaeger Battalion lost 199 men with 160 wounded while the total White losses were 670 men.

1918 also saw Oesch commissioned as a captain in the Finnish Army, followed by a promotion to major. He briefly acted as the chief of staff of the Mountain Brigade () before taking the position of the chief of intelligence in the Finnish General Headquarters. Later that year, he took command of the Guards Jaeger Battalion (), a position he would hold until 1920.

==Interwar years==
Oesch married Anna Aitanga Niskanen in 1919. The couple had two children: son Karl Christian (born 1921) and daughter Ann-Mari (born 1922).

In the 1920s and 1930s Oesch advanced rapidly in the Finnish Defence Forces. He briefly acted as an aide to the chief-of-staff of the Army High Command, before being given command of the Vyborg Regiment (). While holding that command, he was promoted lieutenant colonel in 1921. 

From 1924 to 1926, Oesch studied in the French military academy. During this time, he was also promoted colonel. Once he had returned to Finland, Oesch commanded the newly created general staff academy &quot;Sotakorkeakoulu&quot;. He briefly held command of the 1st Division from 1929 to 1930, after which he was promoted to major general and appointed Chief of the General Staff. During the following years, he oversaw significant reforms in the Finnish armed forces, which, according to Mikko Uola, &quot;made possible the successes of the Finnish army in the Winter War&quot;. Oesch also served briefly as Deputy Minister of the Interior Affairs from 3 to 14 March 1932, during the crisis caused by the Mäntsälä rebellion. He was promoted to lieutenant general in 1936.

==Winter War and the Interim Peace==

When the Soviet invasion of Finland started the Winter War on 30 November 1939, Oesch continued as Chief of the General Staff at Finnish Supreme headquarters under the Finnish Commander-in-Chief, Marshal Carl Gustaf Emil Mannerheim. 

In early March 1940, just prior to the end of the Winter War, Oesch was given command of the Coast Group, whose sector along the Bay of Viipuri had become critical. Oesch replaced Major General Kurt Martti Wallenius, who had taken command only three days prior. According to Robert Edwards, Wallenius had &quot;retreated to his command post and became very drunk&quot; after losing his nerve from the intensity of the combat. The Battle of Vyborg Bay saw both sides suffer significant losses, but by the evening of March 5 the Soviet 173rd Motor Rifle Division had established a bridgehead over the bay. Further Soviet forces arrived at the bridgehead by 10 March, but the signing of the Moscow Peace Treaty on 12 March saw the hostilities end at 11 a.m. on 13 March.

Following the end of the war, Oesch first returned to his previous post as the Chief of the General Staff for a few weeks, before taking the command of II Corps.

==Continuation War==

Following Finno-German negotiations that had been ongoing from at least May 1941, the Finns mobilized on 10 June 1941 in preparation for the Continuation War, the Finnish component of the German invasion of the Soviet Union. As part of these preparations, Oesch&#x27;s II Corps was renamed IV Corps. Consisting of the 4th, 8th, 10th and 12th divisions, it was initially tasked with the defense of the southernmost sector of the Finno-Soviet border on the shore of the Gulf of Finland.

Following the Soviet 23rd Army&#x27;s withdrawal from Vyborg, parts of IV Corps followed in pursuit. A Finnish amphibious landing to Lokhaniemi, south of Vyborg, together with a by-land envelopment conducted by the 4th and 12th divisions, resulted in the pocketing of the Soviet 43rd, 115th and 123rd divisions following the Battle of Porlampi. While most of the 115th and 123rd divisions eventually escaped the encirclement, the operation resulted in the capture of some 3000 prisoners of war, including the commander of the Soviet 43rd Division, Major General Kirpichnikov, and large amounts of materiel.

In 1942, Oesch was given command of Olonets Group in the Olonets Isthmus between Lakes Onega and Ladoga. While the front had stabilized into trench warfare, Oesch&#x27;s forces soon came under attack by six soviet divisions and four brigades. The attack was eventually repulsed, but caused significant casualties for both sides.

The trench warfare period ended on 9 June 1944 with the Soviet Vyborg–Petrozavodsk Offensive, which soon broke the Finnish lines. On the morning of 14 June 1944, Oesch received a call from Lieutenant General Aksel Airo with the following message:
Oesch was given the title Commander of the Isthmus Forces, with the forces under his command soon including the III, IV and V Corps. The Soviet offensive pushed the Finnish forces first to the VT-line, and eventually to the VKT-line, where the situation eventually stabilized around 17 July, following the fall of Vyborg and the battles of Tali-Ihantala and Vyborg Bay. Oesch was awarded the Mannerheim Cross on 26 June 1944.

Following the stabilization of the situation, Soviet forces from the Finnish front were redirected to other fronts, and on 27 July the Soviets indicated they would be open to a negotiated peace that allowed for an independent Finland. The Finnish parliament accepted the Soviet demands on 2 September. As agreed during the negotiations, Finnish forces began to observe a cease-fire at 07:00a.m. on 4 September. Soviet forces followed suite some 25 hours later, at 08:00a.m. on 5 September.

After the end of the war, Oesch briefly commanded the General Staff of the Finnish General Headquarters before taking command of an army corps later that year.

==Trial for war crimes==
Oech was arrested for war crimes in 1945. In 1946, he was sentenced to 12 years in prison on involuntary manslaughter charges for having encouraged the killings of 17 Soviet prisoners of war. The sentence was later reduced to three years by the Supreme Court of Finland.

The trial and sentence stemmed from events in November 1941, when Oesch had given an order to shoot political commissars and other prisoners-of-war who refused to work or follow orders. Any paperwork related to such executions would not be properly filled, listing the executed as &quot;removed&quot; () In addition, in the fall of 1944, Oesch had ordered the destruction of documents relating to shot prisoners-of-war.

==Later life==
After Oesch was released from prison in 1948, he devoted himself to military history, researching and writing extensively on Finnish experiences in World War II. He founded the &quot;Kansa Taisteli&quot; magazine and wrote a book on the 1944 events on the Karelian Isthmus. According to Mikko Uola, Oesch was embittered by what he perceived as a lack of recognition for his actions.

Oesch died in Helsinki on 28 March 1978 and is buried in the Hietaniemi cemetery.

In 1960, he was given an honorary doctorate by the University of Turku.

<doc id="360206" wikidata="Q1149315" url="?curid=360206" title="Ie (Japanese family system)">
<text>Ie is a Japanese term which translates directly to household. It can mean either a physical home or refer to a family&#x27;s lineage. It is popularly used as the &quot;traditional&quot; family structure. The physical definition of an ie consists of an estate that includes a house, rice paddies and vegetable gardens, and its own section in the local cemetery. The symbolic definition of ie has been referred to as the cultural medium for the physical processes of kinship, such as mating and procreation. The symbolic ie refers not only to blood lines, however, but also to economic and socioreligious functions that take place within the family.

==Family registration and status==
The ie is a patriarchal household and is considered to consist of grandparents, their son, his wife and their children. In a &quot;traditional&quot; Japanese household, the eldest son inherits the household property as well as the responsibility of taking care of his parents as they age. The eldest son is also expected to live with his parents when they grow older.

Today all households are obligated to record their information in the koseki, the family registration system, which records any and all changes in family composition and identity. The koseki also requires a household to appoint one person as the head of the house. Although a woman may also be head of household, the heads are typically male (98 percent of households elect a male as the head of the household). Once the head is chosen, other members of the house must change their surnames to that of the head. Japanese law obligates married spouses to have the same surname. Although the chosen surname can be of the wife too, this rarely happens. In 2015, the Japanese Supreme Court upheld the constitutionality of the law, noting that women could use their maiden names informally, and stating that it was for the legislature to decide on whether to pass new legislation on separate spousal names.
Even with the death of a koseki, the family will keep the name as long as they are listed in the system as part of his koseki. One to two generations can be included in a koseki, a couple and their children. If a household consists of grandparents and children, then the grandparents must start to have their own koseki. This system has been noted to be particularly strict in that it excludes any families who do not fit into the patrilineal structure encouraged by the koseki. Another important aspect of the ie is the role of dead ancestors. Dead ancestors may be separated into two categories: the &quot;generation dead&quot;, and the &quot;juvenile dead.&quot; &quot;Generation dead&quot; are husband and wife pairs who held the status of household heads during their living years. These ancestors are representative of the history of the ie and provide living members of the ie means of relating to their history and ancestors. They play a pivotal role in the daily lives of most Japanese households in that they must be given a great deal of respect and are commemorated through Buddhist rites. In contrast, if an ancestor does not qualify as a &quot;generation dead&quot; then they are considered &quot;juvenile dead&quot; and are destined to be forgotten.
==Arranged marriage==
Marital and affinial ties are of great concern to the identity of an ie and therefore arranged marriage was very common in Japan prior to World War II. Studies have shown that families in the middle and upper classes are more committed to arranged marriages than those in lower classes because they are most concerned with the security of the household and recognize that “romantic love, ren’ai, cannot be counted on.” 

==Household duties==
The ie is often defined by the gendered roles within a family. These roles are most often exemplified by the household duties that each family member is expected to uphold. Until recently, wives took on the duties of cooking, cleaning, and raising the children, while the typical husband served as a salary man and earned the income for the family. While this familial structure is still in place, it is changing as more and more women join the workforce. Among the lower class society, a rising number of women are achieving economic independence and good career prospects leading to a shift in the typical patriarchic society.
Today, the Japanese government has encouraged working fathers to become Iku-men (or stay-at-home fathers), and in 1992, the Japanese government passed a law that allowed for time off for both the mother and the father of a newborn child.

<text>A Certain Ratio (abbreviated as ACR) are an English post-punk band formed in Greater Manchester in 1977 by Peter Terrell (guitar), Simon Topping (vocals, trumpet), Jez Kerr (bass guitar, vocals), Martin Moscrop (trumpet, guitar) and Donald Johnson (drums), with Martha Tilson (vocals) joining soon after.

One of the first indie groups to draw heavy influence from funk as well as disco and Latin percussion, the band were among the first to debut on Tony Wilson&#x27;s Factory Records in 1979 with &quot;All Night Party,&quot; produced by Martin Hannett. During ACR&#x27;s early years with Factory, they scored seven Top Ten UK independent releases, highlighted by &quot;Flight&quot; and &quot;Waterline,&quot; and released five studio albums beginning with &quot;The Graveyard and the Ballroom&quot; (1980).

Following late 1980s and early 1990s phases with A&amp;M Records and Rob Gretton&#x27;s independent Robs Records, ACR were intermittently active. They returned to the studio for their ninth studio album &quot;Mind Made Up&quot; (2008) and since then have continued to perform, with their back catalogue recirculated through an arrangement with Mute Records. 

They released their first new studio album in twelve years, &quot;ACR Loco&quot; in September 2020, followed by three EP&#x27;s &quot;A&quot;, &quot;C&quot; and &quot;R&quot; in 2021, and eleventh studio album, &quot;1982,&quot; in 2023. Their twelfth studio album, &quot;It All Comes Down to This&quot; was released in 2024.

== History ==
=== The Factory era ===

==== Formation and first releases ====
The band was formed by vocalist Simon Topping and guitarist and electronics player Peter Terrell, who after initially performing as a duo, were soon joined by bassist and vocalist Jez Kerr and then guitarist and trumpeter Martin Moscrop, the band played without a drummer for a year. The band&#x27;s name is taken from the lyric of Brian Eno&#x27;s song &quot;The True Wheel&quot; from his solo studio album &quot;Taking Tiger Mountain (By Strategy)&quot; (1974). Their early influences included the Velvet Underground, Kraftwerk, the Pop Group, Pere Ubu, Wire, Brian Eno, Parliament, Funkadelic, and Earth, Wind &amp; Fire. A Certain Ratio, by early 1979, were &quot;beginning to forge links between post-punk industrial and dance-floor funk&quot; (Tony Wilson, Factory Records).

ACR&#x27;s line-up, with a dark bass-heavy industrial and funk sound, recorded the group&#x27;s debut single, &quot;All Night Party&quot;, released by Factory Records in September 1979 (the label&#x27;s first single artist release), with Factory label boss Tony Wilson also becoming their manager, proclaiming the band to be &quot;the new Sex Pistols&quot;. The 5,000 copies that were pressed soon sold out.

On 1 October 1979, the band recorded a session for John Peel&#x27;s BBC Radio 1 show, by which time Donald Johnson had joined the band on drums. The session included &quot;Do the Du&quot;, &quot;All Night Party&quot;, &quot;Flight&quot; and &quot;Choir&quot; and was broadcast on 17 October.

ACR played their first tour of bigger venues as the opening act on American rock band Talking Heads&#x27; UK tour in December 1979. There are suggestions that watching ACR perform encouraged lead vocalist David Byrne and Talking Heads to go in a more funky musical direction.

==== Early albums ====
Their next release, the cassette-only compilation of demos and live tracks &quot;The Graveyard and the Ballroom&quot;, was released in January 1980. &quot;The Graveyard&quot; side of the album was recorded at Graveyard Studios, Prestwich, Greater Manchester in September 1979, produced by Factory&#x27;s Martin Hannett. &quot;The Ballroom&quot; side was a live recording of ACR’s October 1979 gig at the Electric Ballroom, Camden, London. A Certain Ratio consider the release to be &quot;our most punk-funk album. It&#x27;s got real indie undertones, post-punk undertones&quot;.

Martin Moscrop started a second band in 1980, Swamp Children (the name later changed to Kalima), that would go on to share several members with A Certain Ratio.

In July 1980, the band&#x27;s second single, a cover version of Banbarra&#x27;s &quot;Shack Up&quot;, recorded at a cost of £50, was released. This was followed in November with &quot;Flight&quot; on 12&quot;, which saw their first placing on the UK Independent Chart, peaking at no. 7. &quot;Shack Up&quot; got a US release in January 1981, going on to peak at no. 46 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Dance Club Songs chart, and the band expanded to a six-piece with the addition of former Occult Chemistry vocalist Martha Tilson, with Topping focusing on trumpet and percussion.

The expanded line-up recorded their debut studio album, &quot;To Each...&quot; The album was recorded in New Jersey with Martin Hannett producing, and released in May 1981. It topped the UK Independent Chart. &quot;To Each...&quot; represents a development in the ACR sound from the raw harshness of &quot;The Graveyard and the Ballroom&quot; to a percussion-based post-punk funk. 

They recorded a second Peel session in June 1981. The session, which included &quot;Knife Slits Water&quot;, &quot;Day One&quot; and &quot;Skipscada&quot;, was broadcast on 2 July. ACR finished the year with the single &quot;Waterline&quot;, which was another top 10 indie chart hit. &quot;Waterline&quot; was the first record self-produced by the group. All of ACR’s previous recordings had been produced by Factory&#x27;s Martin Hannett but the band wanted a different sound. &quot;We thought he was making us sound too much like Joy Division&quot; (Martin Moscrop, ACR). &quot;Waterline&quot; has a more funk and jazz sound than earlier recordings.

The band&#x27;s third studio album, &quot;Sextet&quot;, followed in January 1982, now incorporating elements of acid jazz, funk, and Latin music, and again topped the indie albums chart, also peaking at no. 55 on the UK Albums Chart. Tony Wilson had arranged for ACR to go to New York to record &quot;To Each…&quot; but that album had already been largely written and the influences of New York didn’t really appear in ACR’s music until &quot;Sextet&quot;. The band&#x27;s recent stay in New York had increased the Latin, jazz and Cuban percussion influences in their music. &quot;Sextet&quot; was the first album that was self-produced by ACR and is closer to the &quot;dark funk&quot; sound the band wanted. ACR rate &quot;Sextet&quot; as one of their stand out albums.

In February 1982, they released the dub reggae single &quot;Abracadubra&quot; under the pseudonym &#x27;Sir Horatio&#x27;. ACR had further indie charting singles that year with &quot;Guess Who?&quot; and &quot;Knife Slits Water&quot;. The group recorded a third Peel session in November, now without Tilson, but with Andy Connell added on keyboards and percussion. This session saw the group show more of a jazz influence in the three tracks (&quot;Who&#x27;s to Say&quot;, &quot;Piu Lento&quot; and &quot;Touch&quot;) which were broadcast on the John Peel show of 1 December 1982.

The band&#x27;s fourth studio album, &quot;I&#x27;d Like to See You Again&quot;, was released in November 1982, reaching no. 2 on the indie albums chart. &quot;The new music offered disciplined latin disco, inspired in part by Cameo.&quot; The album received mixed reviews. &quot;ACR aren&#x27;t sounding like ACR anymore so much as the latest New York disco imports&quot; (&quot;New Musical Express&quot;, 1982) &quot;&quot;I&#x27;d Like to See You Again&quot; represented an aesthetic low. In striving for a more accessible sound, the group had become overly clinical.&quot; (Adrian Thrills, &quot;New Musical Express&quot;, August 1985)

==== Founders leave ====
The band&#x27;s two founding members, Topping and Terrell, left the band in late 1982. Simon Topping recorded a solo single before forming T-Coy with former Quando Quango (and later M People member) Mike Pickering. The band regrouped and returned in October 1983 with the single &quot;I Need Someone Tonight&quot; (with Carol McKenzie on vocals), another top-10 indie hit. Tony Quigley of Kalima joined on saxophone, and the band released three singles in late 1984 and 1985 – &quot;Life&#x27;s a Scream&quot; (December 1984), &quot;Brazilia&quot; (February 1985) and &quot;Wild Party&quot; (June 1985).

&quot;The Old and the New&quot;, a compilation album bringing together many of the non-album singles released from ACR&#x27;s formation up to the end of 1985, came out on Factory Records in January 1986. Connell left in 1985 to form Swing Out Sister, whose lead vocalist Corinne Drewery guested on ACR&#x27;s next studio album, &quot;Force&quot; (1986), their last for Factory, released in November 1986. Stuart James co-produced the album with the band. It was recorded and mixed between July and August 1986 at Yello 2 Studios in Stockport, Greater Manchester. The album received good reviews from music critics, and spent nine weeks on the UK Independent Albums Chart, peaking at No. 2. &quot;Mickey Way&quot; was the first single from the album, released exclusively in the UK. &quot;Bootsy&quot; was the second single from the album and was released exclusively in Australia. Neither single charted. In January 1986, ACR performed live on Channel 4 music show &quot;The Tube&quot;.

=== 1989–1997: A&amp;M, Rob&#x27;s Records, and Creation Records ===
New releases were sparse during the next two years. Dojo Records released a 1985 live recording as &quot;Live in America&quot; in February 1987, and Italian label Materiali Sonori released the &quot;Greeting Four&quot; EP five months later. The band signed a recording contract with A&amp;M Records in 1987, the line-up now consisted of Kerr, Moscrop, Johnson, and Quigley, the first releases for the label the singles &quot;The Big E&quot; and &quot;Backs to the Wall&quot;, which preceded the band&#x27;s sixth studio album &quot;Good Together&quot;, released in September 1989. A 50–minute recording of a live show from London was broadcast on British television in October. They also set up their own SoundStation studio in Manchester. The band&#x27;s only significant chart success with A&amp;M came with the 1990 single &quot;Won&#x27;t Stop Loving You&quot;, which peaked at no. 55 on the UK Singles Chart, although the first two singles also made the lower reaches of the chart. The studio album &quot;acr:mcr&quot; (1990) followed bringing a new generation of fans from the dance/club scene to ACR. But the band were then dropped from the label.

In 1991, they signed with Rob&#x27;s Records, owned by New Order manager and former Factory Records partner Rob Gretton, releasing a string of singles and the album &quot;Up in Dowsnville&quot; (1992). In 1994, Creation Records began reissuing the band&#x27;s albums on the Rev-Ola sub-label, and also released two EPs of remixes. The band&#x27;s first original material for almost three years was released in August 1996, with the live &quot;Soundstation Volume 1&quot; EP, followed in November with the band&#x27;s ninth studio album &quot;Change the Station&quot;. A second &quot;Soundstation&quot; live EP was released in March 1997, the band&#x27;s last release for some time.

In 2002, Soul Jazz Records reissued the albums with bonus tracks (but using the same masters as the Creation editions). Further re-issues and a live recording from 1980 were also made available on the LTM label.

=== 21st century return ===
The band played occasional live shows between 2002 and 2007, and performed in the US for the first time since 1985 on 16 November 2008, headlining the Part Time Punks festival at The Echo in Los Angeles, releasing a new studio album &quot;Mind Made Up&quot; the same month, on French label Le Maquis. They performed a headline set at the Offset Festival in London in September 2009, playing alongside fellow post-punk artists the Slits, following a one-off live performance commemorating Factory Records in Dublin, in March that year. They performed at the Plan K, Molenbeek in West Brussels on 12 December 2009 as part of the event, A Factory Night (And Then Again). This event also featured Section 25, the Wake, the Names and Biting Tongues. Towards the end of 2009, the band announced a live appearance at a fund-raising event at Brighton&#x27;s Concorde 2 venue on 7 March 2010. Their 2008 studio album, &quot;Mind Made Up&quot; was re-issued via LTM Recordings during 2010, along with a redux version of the 1986 studio album, &quot;Force&quot;.

In 2018, Mute Records began reissuing their back catalogue, they released &quot;acr:set&quot;, an album of mostly old tracks with two new tracks, one (&quot;Dirty Boy&quot;) recorded with Barry Adamson of Magazine and featuring a recording of Tony Wilson, and undertook a tour of the UK with dates in Ireland and Finland. In November 2018 they recorded a session for Marc Riley&#x27;s BBC Radio 6 Music show, performing new song &quot;Dirty Boy&quot;, &quot;Mickey Way&quot;, and &quot;Flight&quot;.

They released a box set, a 40th anniversary retrospective named &quot;acr:box&quot;, in May 2019 and toured in support of this. It consists of 53 songs providing a detailed career overview to date. A Certain Ratio released &quot;ACR Loco&quot; in September 2020 on Mute. Their first album of new material in 12 years featured three of the original band members – Jez Kerr, Martin Moscrop, and Donald Johnson – along with members of the band&#x27;s current live ensemble. This was followed by three EP releases and remix album &quot;Loco Remezclada&quot; in 2021. ACR&#x27;s eleventh studio album, &quot;1982,&quot; was released in 2023. Their twelfth studio album, &quot;It All Comes Down to This&quot; was released in 2024.

== In film ==
&quot;Wild Party&quot; was used in the soundtrack of the British romantic comedy film &quot;Letter to Brezhnev&quot; (1985). &quot;Shack Up&quot; was used in the soundtrack of Patrice Chéreau&#x27;s &quot;Intimacy&quot; (2001). The band are featured in the biographical comedy drama film &quot;24 Hour Party People&quot; (2002) where Tony Wilson (played by Steve Coogan) describes them as &quot;having all the energy of Joy Division but better clothes&quot;. Martin Moscrop was musical supervisor of the film.

<text>Johan Hendrik Weidner (October 22, 1912, in Brussels, Belgium – May 21, 1994, in Monterey Park, California, United States) was a highly decorated Dutch hero of World War II.

==Early life==
Johan Hendrik Weidner Jr. was born in Brussels to Dutch parents. Although his birth name was Johan Hendrik, he used to call himself &quot;Jean&quot; and later in the U.S., &quot;John&quot;. He was the eldest of four children, and grew up in Switzerland, near the French border at Collonges-sous-Salève - a village in the French department of Haute-Savoie, where his father taught Latin and Greek at the Seventh-day Adventist Church seminary.

Following his education at French public schools, he attended basic courses at the Seventh-day Adventist Seminary in Collonges-sous-Salève. His father Johan Hendrik Weidner Sr. who studied at the University of Geneva, and had been a minister for the Seventh-day Adventists in Brussels and Switzerland, hoped Jean would follow in his footsteps. To his father&#x27;s regret, he decided to go into business, and in 1935 he established a textile import/export business in Paris, France.
Around this time he went to Geneva to attend sessions of the League of Nations, and saw firsthand how ineffective that body was in preventing the outbreak of war in 1939.

==Activities during World War II==
At the outbreak of World War II Jean was living in Paris. With the subsequent German occupation of France he fled with several others from Paris to Lyon in the unoccupied part of France. Because he had to abandon his Parisian business, he began a new business in Lyon. In 1941, Jean founded &quot;Dutch-Paris&quot;, an underground network of which the location of his Lyonnaise textile business soon became its headquarters. In order to get passes to go in and out of the Swiss frontier zone, he set up a second textile shop in Annecy at the end of 1942.

Dutch-Paris became one of the largest and most successful underground networks for people persecuted for faith or race, Allied pilots, and persons of great Dutch importance to help them escape via Switzerland and Spain. This escape route was also used for smuggling documents. In the Netherlands this message line was also known as &quot;The Swiss Way&quot;.

In its heyday, 300 people were part of this underground network, of which about 150 people were arrested. 40 people were slain or died from the effects of captivity, including his sister who helped to coordinate escapes from Paris. The escape route has greatly contributed to the French Resistance, and is responsible for the rescue of more than 1,080 people, including 800 Dutch Jews and more than 112 downed Allied pilots. Jean was one of the most sought after underground leaders of France, for whom the Gestapo at one time offered a reward of five million francs for his arrest.

==Arrests==
In February 1944, a young female courier was arrested by the French police and extradited to the Gestapo. Against all rules, she had a notebook with her containing names and addresses of Dutch-Paris members. She was brutally interrogated by a guard that held her head under cold water until she nearly drowned. Under torture she revealed many names of key members of the underground network. As a result, a large number of Dutch-Paris members were arrested (See more details in Suzanne Hiltermann-Souloumiac).
The name of Jean&#x27;s sister Gabrielle Weidner was among the names listed in the notepad. She was arrested by the Gestapo and imprisoned at the Fresnes prison in Paris, because it was hoped for that her comrades would try to free her. In Fresnes she was treated well, but when this ploy did not work, she was shipped to Ravensbrück concentration camp in Germany. She later died of the effects of malnutrition, only a few days after liberation by the Russians.
During the occupation, Jean was arrested by both French gendarmerie and French Milice, including the Swiss border police. The French gendarmerie beat him up brutally, but they had to release him later due to lack of evidence. In another arrest by the Milice in Toulouse he was tortured, but he managed to escape before they could transfer him to the Gestapo. The Gestapo were never able to get a hold of him.

==After the war==
In November 1944, after the Liberation of France Weidner was invited to London by Queen Wilhelmina, to come to tell her about the &quot;Dutch-Paris&quot; escape route, and the situation of Dutch civilians in France and Belgium. In the same year he was made a Captain in the Dutch Armed Forces, after which he could be in charge of the Dutch Security Service based in Paris. His service was in charge of vetting all the Dutch citizens in France and Belgium to look for any that collaborated with the Germans.

The Bureau of National Security, the Department of Justice, and the Dutch Embassy in Paris all claimed authority for Netherlands Security Service. Therefore, it has never become entirely clear under whose direction he fell.

In mid 1946, Jean was suddenly dismissed by the Dutch government, arguing that they needed a professional policeman on the post. After his work with the security he picked up the threads of normal life again, and returned to his import/export textile business. In 1955 he emigrated to the United States, eventually settling in California where from 1958 he and his wife Naomi operated a chain of health food stores.

==Recognition==

For his War efforts, Weidner was awarded the United States Medal of Freedom with Gold Palm, made an Honorary Officer of the Order of the British Empire, an Officer in the Dutch Order of Orange-Nassau. The French Government honored him with the Croix de Guerre and Médaille de la Résistance and the Légion d&#x27;honneur. The Belgian Government made him an Officer of the Order of Leopold.

At the 1993 opening of the United States Holocaust Memorial Museum in Washington, D.C. he was one of seven persons chosen to light candles recognizing the rescuers. The Israeli government honored Weidner as one of the gentiles designated as Righteous Among the Nations at Israel&#x27;s national Holocaust Memorial, Yad Vashem where a grove of trees was planted in his name on the Hill of Remembrance along the Avenue of the Righteous.

<doc id="360217" wikidata="Q964303" url="?curid=360217" title="U&amp;Gold">
<text>U&amp;Gold is a British premium television channel from the UKTV network that was launched in late 1992 as UK Gold before it was rebranded UKTV Gold in 2004. In 2008, it was split into current flagship channel Gold and miscellaneous channel, W, with classic comedy based programming now airing on Gold, non-crime drama and entertainment programming airing on W, and quiz shows and more high-brow comedy airing on Dave. It shows repeats of classic programming from the BBC, ITV and other broadcasters. Every December, from 2015 until 2018, the channel was temporarily renamed to Christmas Gold. This has since been discontinued, although the channel still continues to broadcast Christmas comedy. 

==History==

The channel was formed as a joint venture between the BBC, through commercial arm BBC Enterprises, American company Cox Enterprises and outgoing ITV London weekday franchisee Thames Television, known as European Channel Management. The channel, named &quot;UK Gold&quot;, was to show repeats of the &#x27;classic&#x27; archive programming from the two broadcasters. The channel launched on 1 November 1992 at 7pm with &quot;Just Good Friends&quot;. The first commercial shown on the channel was for Lucozade, and all commercials shown in the first three breaks on the channel&#x27;s launch night either had the word gold or golden in either the name of the brand advertised or mentioned in the commercial itself.

The rights to the BBC programmes previously were held by the BSB entertainment channel Galaxy, prior to the merger with Sky Television to form BSkyB in November 1990. The channel was initially broadcast on an analogue transponder from an SES satellite at 19.2°E which was less well suited for UK reception. As a result, the channel used to be notorious for being marred with interference, known as &#x27;sparklies&#x27;, in large parts of the UK. Another initial drawback was the cutting of programming down to fit commercial time slots, and the intensive use of commercial breaks. Reception improved however with the channel added to BSkyB&#x27;s basic subscription package in 1993, and the launch of the channel on cable services.

In 1993, Flextech gained its first stake in the station after acquiring Tele-Communications Inc.&#x27;s TV interests in Europe. In 1996, it started discussions about increasing its stake, to gain full control. At that point, Flextech held 27% with Cox (38%), BBC (20%) and Pearson (15%). By the Autumn, Flextech held 80% of UK Gold. Flextech&#x27;s main reason for increasing its stake in UK Gold was in participation of new talks with the BBC.

===UKTV===
The channel&#x27;s success led to the launch of the UKTV network on 1 November 1997, owned by BBC Worldwide and Flextech, and consisting of three other channels: UK Arena, UK Horizons and UK Style, focusing on the arts, factual and lifestyle programmes respectively. The UKTV network would expand to include numerous more channels as the years progressed.

To coincide with the launch of Sky Digital, a sister network entitled UK Gold Classics was launched on 2 October 1998, becoming UKTV&#x27;s first digital-exclusive network. The channel focused on older programs that aired on the main UK Gold within its launch, as the main channel was at the time focusing on more newer programmes. The channel only broadcast during the weekend, airing from 6:00pm–2:00am; Friday-Sunday. On 28 March 1999, the channel closed under the &quot;Classics&quot; format and on 2 April 1999 was relaunched as UK Gold 2, becoming a secondary timeshift service that broadcast UK Gold&#x27;s daytime schedule in the evening. Initially, the channel broadcast on weekends only, but expanded to a full 7-day-a-week schedule in June.

On 30 June 2002, UKTV announced the launch of a one-hour timeshift service of the network, entitled UK Gold +1. The channel launched on Sky the following month on 1 August. It initially only broadcast during the evening from 7:00pm–7:00am, much like UK Gold 2 but on 12 November 2003, the channel gained a full 24-hour slot.

On 29 October 2003, UKTV announced that UK Gold 2 would be relaunched as UK G2 on 12 November, being reinvented as a younger-oriented edgier youth network aimed towards a 16-34-year-old demographic. The channel rebranded as such on that day, and alongside that UK Gold +1 expanded to a full 24-hour schedule to match its parent network.
On 8 March 2004, to coincide with its sister channel&#x27;s rebranding, the channel rebranded to UKTV Gold with its timeshift becoming UKTV Gold +1. At approximately the same time, Granada-run archive channel Granada Plus closed to make way for ITV3. The channels had always been the main rivals to Gold due to the direct mix of archive BBC and ITV programming. ITV3 currently has a higher viewer share, often put down to the fact that the terrestrial platform Freeview shows ITV3 but not Gold. In late 2004, to show films produced in Hollywood in a marathon, UKTV Gold temporarily changed its name to &quot;USTV Gold&quot;.

Gold began transmitting in widescreen on 31 January 2008, although some programmes made in 16:9 format were screened in the compromise 14:9 semi-letterboxed ratio for a short while, before the 16:9 format became standard later in the year. The channel has been criticised by some, particularly in recent years, for featuring many recent programmes as opposed to &#x27;classics&#x27; as was the original concept, with some shows appearing on the channel mere months or weeks after their first television broadcast.

===2008 rebrand===
In 2008, UKTV began a process of rebranding and expanding its channels, removing &quot;UKTV&quot; from their name, following the rebranding of UKTV G2 as Dave in October 2007. On 7 October 2008, UKTV Gold became &quot;G.O.L.D.&quot; (with its timeshift becoming G.O.L.D. +1), exclusively showing comedy, both old and new. This is reflected by its new slogan, which now represents Gold as a backronym—&quot;Go On Laugh Daily&quot;. Unlike the complete name change for Dave, the Gold name was retained as having a resonance with viewers. The same day also saw the rebranding of UKTV Drama as Alibi, and the launch of a new channel, Watch. In Spring 2010, the channel dropped the acronym and is now known simply as &quot;Gold&quot;, with its timeshift known as &quot;Gold +1&quot;.

In October 2011, Virgin Media, owner of half of Gold and the rest of the UKTV network, sold their share to Scripps Networks Interactive, with the remaining half still retained by the BBC&#x27;s commercial arm, BBC Worldwide.

===2012 programming investment===
In February 2012, it was announced that UKTV was to invest millions into producing its own original shows. According to the trade magazine, Broadcast, Gold &quot;has secured a budget running into &quot;double-digit millions&quot; to create a raft of new comedy shows over the next two years&quot;. The article went on to say &quot;the channel is looking to develop a mix of panel shows, sketch shows, sitcoms and comedy dramas&quot;. This move meant that Gold would follow its sister, Dave, which has resurrected &quot;Red Dwarf&quot; and produced numerous different panel and entertainment series, and BSkyB, who have invested £600m into original comedy for Sky One and Sky Atlantic. The first set of new series for Gold were broadcast in the latter half of 2012.

UKTV executive Jane Rogers stated to Broadcast that the commissions would be high-quality, as &quot;they would need to sit confidently alongside classics such as &quot;Only Fools And Horses&quot; and &quot;The Vicar of Dibley&quot;&quot;. She also added: &quot;Gold is well entrenched in the UK&#x27;s psyche as the home of national treasure comedies, so we cannot afford to look cheap next to those programmes. It&#x27;s important that anything we order continues that love and feel, but we don&#x27;t want to look back; we want a contemporary stamp on the channel.&quot; Commissioning editor Sarah Fraser commented that &quot;there&#x27;s never been a better time to invest in homegrown comedy. Comedians are selling out arena tours, being cast in the West End and on the big screen here and in the US.&quot;

The first programme announced as part of the investment was a reboot of the BBC sitcom, &quot;Yes, Prime Minister&quot;, to be based on the 2010 stage production and written by original writers Sir Antony Jay and Jonathan Lynn. The reboot was the second classic BBC sitcom to be resurrected by a UKTV network, following the two Dave-commissioned series of &quot;Red Dwarf&quot;. News about other new commissions for the channel were announced during the summer.

The channel was removed from Digital Terrestrial in 2013, along with Home as part of the closure of Top Up TV and was replaced with Drama in July 2013. However, Home relaunched on the platform in March 2016. Gold and Home were not available to watch on Freeview boxes and televisions due to them being encrypted as subscription channels on Top Up TV.

An HD version of Gold was launched on 2 October 2017 exclusively to Sky, replacing Eden HD on the platform. Gold HD was added to Virgin Media on 25 September 2018, replacing Gold in standard definition. It was added to BT TV on 11 March 2019, along with Vice HD.

==On-air identity==

For the first few years, idents on UK Gold featured an animated golden retriever mascot named &quot;Goldie&quot; posing with the UK Gold logo. 
It was due to a study showing that the UK was leading in dog ownership, and this was to make the channel more friendlier. 
Goldie was never name-checked as such on air, possibly owing to the death of the &quot;Blue Peter&quot; dog Goldie some weeks before launch, although the late-night music video slot &quot;Dog House&quot; was originally listed as &quot;Goldie&#x27;s Video Bites&quot; in initial pre-launch listings. The Goldie idents were kept until 1993, when they were replaced with a form-up of the first logo against a blue background. A rebranding in 1994 saw UK Gold adopt idents based on the forging of gold bars, with the station&#x27;s logo appearing to have been stamped into gold. Variations on this theme were used until 1997, when the channel received a revamp as part of the formation of the UKTV network.
The new network&#x27;s corporate identity saw all its channels logos simplified to a boxed &quot;UK&quot; followed by the name (e.g. &quot;Gold&quot;) in the Gill Sans font, which had also been adopted by the BBC. The new network-wide ident theme would involve the splitting of the screen for different purposes. UK Gold&#x27;s new idents depicted objects such as apples or leaves falling through the top half of the screen, with only the gold coloured ones reaching the bottom half of the screen. These idents were briefly adopted for UK Gold 2 when it launched in 1998.

The theme changed again, this time with idents featuring fireworks making shapes in the air, was launched in April 1999. The fireworks theme was carried on in a new set of idents, alongside another network-wide rebranding of the logo in 2001, adopting a bolder font and merging UK into a single composite character. A range of live-action idents showing everyday activities from unusual perspectives appeared in 2002. The 2003 to 2007 idents showed channel hopping viewers with their TV set &quot;off stage&quot; being brought to a halt by the appearance of a golden light accompanied by the channel&#x27;s ident jingle. This new identity also featured a series of shifting yellow, orange and red blocks which suggested a gold bar at the centre of the screen.

On 4 April 2007, UKTV Gold unveiled a new on-air identity centred around a branded golden space hopper, playing to contemporary trends toward 1970s nostalgia, and emphasising the station&#x27;s re-run content. Twelve new live action idents featured the branded space hopper, either with people on them bouncing around normally serious scenes, or let loose to bounce around the natural environment, aired from 5 April 2007 to 7 October 2008.

On 7 October 2008, following the rebranding, Gold&#x27;s 2008 presentation debuted, featuring cartoon objects making a giant chain, in Heath Robinson fashion, which triggers an event to herald the next programme. The Gold logo features in the centre, with the channel slogan usually appearing alongside in the sequence. Programmes are announced by sole channel continuity announcer David Flynn, who has had the position since June 2009.

In 2010, the logo was changed slightly, with an updated ident package. These followed a similar style to the previous set, but instead of the previous backronym, the idents focussed on the slogan of ‘Stick Something Funny On’. In May 2012, the dots were removed from the logo, now falling inline with how the channel is called.

In July 2014, Gold rebranded after two years in its second identity. The logo is a ribbon with the letters &quot;GOLD&quot;. The new idents have funny and wacky stuff happening (such as dancing legs). At the end of the idents, the ribbon comes out saying &quot;GOLD&quot;, while the activity behind it is still going.

The 2014 idents were kept in the rebranding to U&amp;Gold, with the logo being changed to follow the other channels.

<text>Marinus (; born c. 440 AD) was a Neoplatonist philosopher, mathematician and rhetorician born in Flavia Neapolis (modern Nablus), Palaestina Secunda. He was a student of Proclus in Athens. His surviving works are an introduction to Euclid&#x27;s &quot;Data&quot;; a &quot;Life of Proclus&quot;, and two astronomical texts. Most of what we know of his life comes from an epitome of a work by Damascius conserved in the Byzantine Suda encyclopaedia.

==Life==
He was, according to his pupil Damascius, born a Samaritan. Whether this information is correct is disputed, but it is quite possible. Damascius also adds that he had converted from Samaritanism.

He came to Athens at a time when, with the exception of Proclus, there was a great dearth of eminent men in the Neoplatonist school. He was appointed as successor (&quot;&quot;) to Proclus, sometime before the latter&#x27;s death, during the period of the teacher&#x27;s infirmity. Proclus dedicated to Marinus his commentary to the Plato&#x27;s Myth of Er.

Proclus himself, it is reported, worried that Marinus himself was of delicate constitution. During this period, the professors of the old Greek religion suffered persecution at the hands of the Christians and Marinus was compelled to seek refuge at Epidaurus, where he died, at a date unknown.

==Works==
Only a remnant of his output survives. His chief surviving work was a biography of Proclus since it is the main source of information on Proclus&#x27; life. This was written in a combination of prose and epic hexameters, of which only the former survives.

The publication of the biography is fixed by internal evidence to the year of Proclus&#x27;s death; for he mentions an eclipse which will happen when the first year after that event is completed. It was first published with the works of Marcus Aurelius in 1559; it was republished separately by Fabricius at Hamburg in 1700, and re-edited in 1814 by Boissonade with emendations and notes. He is also the author of a commentary (or introduction) on the &quot;Data&quot; of Euclid, and a commentary on Theon&#x27;s &quot;Little Commentary&quot;. There is also a surviving astronomical text which discusses the Milky Way.

His lost works included commentaries on Aristotle, on Theon of Alexandria and on some of the dialogues of Plato. He is said to have destroyed his commentary on Plato&#x27;s &quot;Philebus&quot; on the advice of a pupil he was tutoring, Isidorus. According to a version of the story written by Damascius, when Marinus showed his student, to whom he taught Aristotelianism, this commentary, which he had just completed, Isidorus prevailed on him to destroy it, arguing that since the &#x27;divine&#x27; Proclus had himself written a definitive commentary which was the final word on the topic. Current scholarship suspects that this advice arose from fears that Marinus&#x27; commentary would, despite his best efforts, betray traces of material that might undermine the reigning Neoplatonic paradigm.

<text>Isidore of Alexandria also called Isidore of Gaza (; also Isidorus ; ; ) was a Greek philosopher and one of the last of the Neoplatonists. He lived in Athens and Alexandria toward the end of the 5th century AD. He became head of the school in Athens in succession to Marinus, who followed Proclus.

==Life==
Isidore was born in Alexandria. In Athens, he studied under Proclus, and learned the doctrine of Aristotle from Marinus. According to Damascius, &quot;Isidore was awestruck at the sight of Proclus, venerable and marvelous to see; he thought he was seeing in him the very face of true philosophy.&quot; Proclus for his part used to &quot;marvel at Isidore&#x27;s appearance, as it was possessed by the divine and full of the philosophical life within.&quot; Damascius further tells us that &quot;Isidore, besides simplicity, loved truthfulness especially, and undertook to be straight-talking beyond what was necessary, and had no pretence in himself whatsoever.&quot; The claim made in the &quot;Suda&quot; that Isidore was the husband of Hypatia, must be in error since Isidore was born long after Hypatia died. It is elsewhere related that Isidore had a wife called Domna, who died five days after the birth of their son whom they named Proclus.

Isidore returned to Alexandria accompanied by Sallustius. In Alexandria he taught philosophy. He was in Athens when Proclus died (in 485), and later when Marinus took over as head (&quot;scholarch&quot;) of the Neoplatonist school. Marinus persuaded him to be his successor as head of the school, but he left Athens not long after Marinus died, resigning his position to Hegias.

Isidore is known principally as the teacher of Damascius, whose testimony in his &quot;Life of Isidore&quot; presents Isidore in a very favourable light as a man and a thinker. Damascius&#x27; &quot;Life&quot;, which is dedicated to Theodora, a disciple of both Isidore and Damascius, is preserved in summary form by Photius in his &quot;Bibliotheca&quot;, and in fragments in the &quot;Suda&quot;.

==Philosophy==
It is generally admitted that he was rather an enthusiast than a thinker; reasoning with him was subsidiary to inspiration, and he preferred the theories of Pythagoras and Plato to the unimaginative logic and the practical ethics of the Stoics and Aristotelians. He seems to have given loose rein to theosophical speculation and attached great importance to dreams and waking visions, on which he used to expatiate in his public discourses.

<text>Zenodotus () was a Greek grammarian, literary critic, Homeric scholar, and the first librarian of the Library of Alexandria. A native of Ephesus and a pupil of Philitas of Cos, he lived during the reigns of the first two Ptolemies, and was at the height of his reputation about 280 BC.

==Biography==
Zenodotus was the first superintendent of the Library of Alexandria and the first critical editor ( &quot;diorthōtes&quot;) of Homer. In 284 BC, the Ptolemaic court appointed Zenodotus as the first Director of the library and also the official tutor to the royal children. His colleagues in the librarianship were Alexander of Aetolia and Lycophron of Chalcis, to whom were allotted the tragic and comic writers respectively, Homer and other epic poets being assigned to Zenodotus. 

== Work ==
Although he has been reproached with arbitrariness and insufficient knowledge of Greek, his recension undoubtedly laid a sound foundation for future criticism. Having collated the different manuscripts in the library, he expunged or obelized doubtful verses, transposed or altered lines, and introduced new readings. It is probable that he was responsible for the division of the Homeric poems into twenty-four books each, and possibly was the author of the calculation of the days of the &quot;Iliad&quot; in the &quot;Tabula Iliaca&quot;.

=== Homeric glosses ===
He does not appear to have written any regular commentary on Homer, but his Homeric (&quot;&quot;, &quot;lists of unusual words, glosses&quot;) probably formed the source of the explanations of Homer attributed by the grammarians to Zenodotus. He also lectured upon Hesiod, Anacreon and Pindar, if he did not publish editions of them. He is further called an epic poet by the &quot;Suda,&quot; and three epigrams in the &quot;Greek Anthology&quot; are assigned to him.

=== Library organisation ===
==== Classification ====
In addition to his other scholarly work, Zenodotus introduced an organization system on the materials in the Library of Alexandria whereby texts were assigned to different rooms based on their subject matter (verse or prose, literary or scientific), and the various sub-classifications within each. 

==== Ordering ====
Within their subjects, Zenodotus organized the works alphabetically by the first letter of the name of their author. The principle of the alphabetic organization was introduced by Zenodotus.

==== Tagging ====
In addition, library staff attached a small tag to the end of each scroll. These tags gave authors&#x27; names as well as other identification and had been added during the accessions procedure but often without a title; many a roll contained more than one work, and many works, such as compilations of poetry, warranted more than a single title. When a title was lacking, Zenodotus had to unroll and pass an eye over the text. Such tags enabled the scrolls to be easily returned to the area in which they had been classified and also ensured that library users did not have to unroll each scroll in order to see what it contained. This was the first recorded use of metadata, a landmark in library history. Not until the second century A.D. does fuller alphabetization make an appearance.

<doc id="360236" wikidata="Q503075" url="?curid=360236" title="Crates of Mallus">
<text>Crates of Mallus (, &quot;Krátēs ho Mallṓtēs&quot;; century BC) was a Greek grammarian and Stoic philosopher, leader of the literary school and head of the library of Pergamum. He was described as the Crates from Mallus to distinguish him from other philosophers by the same name. His chief work was a critical and exegetical commentary on Homer. He is also famous for constructing the earliest known globe of the Earth.

==Life==
He was born in Mallus in Cilicia, and was brought up at Tarsus, and then moved to Pergamon, and there lived under the patronage of Eumenes II, and Attalus II. He was the founder of the Pergamon school of grammar, and seems to have been at one time the head of the library of Pergamon. Among his followers were Hermias (Κρατήτειος Ἑρμείας mentioned in sch. Hom. &quot;Il&quot;. 16.207a), Zenodotus of Mallus and Herodicus of Babylon.

He visited Rome as ambassador of either Eumenes, in 168 BC, or Attalus in 159 BC. Having broken his leg after falling into an open sewer, he was compelled to stay in Rome for some time and delivered lectures which gave the first impulse to the study of grammar and criticism among the Romans.

==Works==
Crates made a strong distinction between criticism and grammar, the latter of which he regarded as subordinate to the former. A critic, according to Crates, should investigate everything which could throw light upon literature; the grammarian was only to apply the rules of language to clear up the meaning of particular passages, and to settle the text, prosody, accentuation, etc. From this part of his system, Crates derived the surname of &quot;Kritikos&quot;.

Like Aristarchus of Samothrace, Crates gave the greatest attention to the works of Homer, from his labours upon which he was also surnamed &quot;Homerikos&quot;. He wrote a commentary on the Iliad and Odyssey in nine books. Some fragments of this commentary are preserved by the scholiasts and other ancient writers. His principles were opposed to those of Aristarchus, who was the leader of the Alexandrian school. Crates was the chief representative of the allegorical theory of exegesis, and maintained that Homer intended to express scientific or philosophical truths in the form of poetry.

Besides his work on Homer, Crates wrote commentaries on the &quot;Theogony&quot; of Hesiod, on Euripides, on Aristophanes, and probably on other ancient authors; a work on the Attic dialect; and works on geography, natural history, and agriculture, of which only a few fragments exist.

==The Globe of Crates==

According to Strabo, Crates devised a globe representing the Earth, which is thus the earliest known globe representing the Earth:
We have now traced on a spherical surface the area in which we say the inhabited world is situated; and the man who would most closely approximate the truth by constructed figures must necessarily take for the earth a globe like that of Crates, and lay off on it the quadrilateral, and within the quadrilateral put down the map of the inhabited world. But since the need of a large globe, so that the section in question (being a small fraction of the globe) may be large enough to receive distinctly the appropriate parts of the inhabited world and to present the proper appearance to observers, it is better for him to construct a globe of adequate size, if he can do so; and let it be no less than ten feet in diameter.

Following the theory of five climatic zones, Crates considered that the torrid zone is occupied by the Ocean and that, by analogy, one can imagine people living beyond the torrid zone:
For Crates, following the mere form of mathematical demonstration, says that the torrid zone is &quot;occupied&quot; by Oceanus and that on both sides of this zone are the temperate zones, the one being on our side, while the other is on the other side of it. Now, just as these Ethiopians on our side of Oceanus, who face the south throughout the whole length of the inhabited land, are called the most remote of the one group of peoples, since they dwell on the shores of Oceanus, so too, Crates thinks, we must conceive that on the other side of Oceanus also there are certain Ethiopians, the most remote of the other group of peoples in the temperate zone, since they dwell on the shores of this same Oceanus; and that they are in two groups and are &quot;sundered in twain&quot; by Oceanus.

The classic drawing of the sphere displays the known world, or Oecumene (Europe, North Africa, and Asia), with three other continents, labeled the Perioeci, the Antipodes, and the Antioeci. Crates&#x27; Perioeci and Antipodes arguably do exist, corresponding roughly to North America and South America respectively, but the continent of the Antioeci, Terra Australis, does not, except in fragments (Australasia and southern Africa). And the earth does in fact have a ring of water around it, but at 60 degrees South latitude, not at the Equator.

==Honours==
Crates Bay in Antarctica is named after Crates of Mallus.

<doc id="360240" wikidata="Q6940053" url="?curid=360240" title="Musaeum Clausum">
<text>Musaeum Clausum (Latin for &quot;Sealed Museum&quot;), also known as Bibliotheca abscondita (&quot;Secret Library&quot; in Latin), is a tract written by Sir Thomas Browne which was first published posthumously in 1684. The tract contains short sentence descriptions of supposed, rumoured or lost books, pictures, and objects. The subtitle describes the tract as an inventory of &quot;remarkable books, antiquities, pictures and rarities of several kinds, scarce or never seen by any man now living&quot;. Its date is unknown: however, an event from the year 1673 is cited.
== Influence from Rabelais ==
Like his &quot;Pseudodoxia Epidemica&quot;, &quot;Musaeum Clausum&quot; is a catalogue of doubts and queries, only this time, in a style which anticipates the 20th-century Argentinian short-story writer Jorge Luis Borges, who once declared: &quot;To write vast books is a laborious nonsense; much better is to offer a summary as if those books actually existed.&quot;

Browne however was not the first author to engage in such fantasy. The French author Rabelais, in his epic &quot;Gargantua and Pantagruel&quot;, also penned a list of imaginary and often obscene book titles in his &quot;Library of Pantagruel&quot;, an inventory which Browne himself alludes to in his &quot;Religio Medici&quot;.
== Connections to the antiquarian collections ==

As the 17th-century Scientific Revolution progressed the popularity and growth of antiquarian collections, those claiming to house highly improbable items grew. Browne was an avid collector of antiquities and natural specimens, possessing a supposed unicorn&#x27;s horn, presented to him by Arthur Dee. Browne&#x27;s eldest son Edward visited the famous scholar Athanasius Kircher, founder of the &quot;Museo Kircherano&quot; at Rome in 1667, whose exhibits included an engine for attempting perpetual motion and a speaking head, which Kircher called his &quot;Oraculum Delphinium&quot;. He wrote to his father of his visit to the Jesuit priest&#x27;s &quot;closet of rarities&quot;.

== Reception ==
The sheer volume of book-titles, pictures and objects listed in &quot;Musaeum Clausum&quot; is testimony to Browne&#x27;s fertile imagination. However, his major editors, Simon Wilkin in the nineteenth century (1834) and Sir Geoffrey Keynes in the twentieth (1924), summarily dismissed it. Keynes considered its humour too erudite and &quot;not to everyone&#x27;s taste&quot;.
== Status as a parody ==
Browne&#x27;s miscellaneous tract may also be read as a parody of the rising trend of private museum collections with their curios of doubtful origin, and perhaps also of publications such as the so-called &quot;Museum Hermeticum&quot; (1678), one of the last great anthologies of alchemical literature, with their divulging of near common-place alchemical concepts and symbols.

<doc id="360243" wikidata="Q2052951" url="?curid=360243" title="Function of several complex variables">
<text>The theory of functions of several complex variables is the branch of mathematics dealing with functions defined on the complex coordinate space formula_1, that is, -tuples of complex numbers. The name of the field dealing with the properties of these functions is called several complex variables (and analytic space), which the Mathematics Subject Classification has as a top-level heading.

As in complex analysis of functions of one variable, which is the case , the functions studied are &quot;holomorphic&quot; or &quot;complex analytic&quot; so that, locally, they are power series in the variables . Equivalently, they are locally uniform limits of polynomials; or locally square-integrable solutions to the -dimensional Cauchy–Riemann equations. For one complex variable, every domain(formula_2), is the domain of holomorphy of some function, in other words every domain has a function for which it is the domain of holomorphy. For several complex variables, this is not the case; there exist domains (formula_3) that are not the domain of holomorphy of any function, and so is not always the domain of holomorphy, so the domain of holomorphy is one of the themes in this field. Patching the local data of meromorphic functions, i.e. the problem of creating a global meromorphic function from zeros and poles, is called the Cousin problem. Also, the interesting phenomena that occur in several complex variables are fundamentally important to the study of compact complex manifolds and complex projective varieties (formula_4) and has a different flavour to complex analytic geometry in formula_5 or on Stein manifolds, these are much similar to study of algebraic varieties that is study of the algebraic geometry than complex analytic geometry.

== Historical perspective ==

Many examples of such functions were familiar in nineteenth-century mathematics; abelian functions, theta functions, and some hypergeometric series, and also, as an example of an inverse problem; the Jacobi inversion problem. Naturally also same function of one variable that depends on some complex parameter is a candidate. The theory, however, for many years didn&#x27;t become a full-fledged field in mathematical analysis, since its characteristic phenomena weren&#x27;t uncovered. The Weierstrass preparation theorem would now be classed as commutative algebra; it did justify the local picture, ramification, that addresses the generalization of the branch points of Riemann surface theory.

With work of Friedrich Hartogs, , E. E. Levi, and of Kiyoshi Oka in the 1930s, a general theory began to emerge; others working in the area at the time were Heinrich Behnke, Peter Thullen, Karl Stein, Wilhelm Wirtinger and Francesco Severi. Hartogs proved some basic results, such as every isolated singularity is removable, for every analytic function 
formula_6
whenever . Naturally the analogues of contour integrals will be harder to handle; when an integral surrounding a point should be over a three-dimensional manifold (since we are in four real dimensions), while iterating contour (line) integrals over two separate complex variables should come to a double integral over a two-dimensional surface. This means that the residue calculus will have to take a very different character.

After 1945 important work in France, in the seminar of Henri Cartan, and Germany with Hans Grauert and Reinhold Remmert, quickly changed the picture of the theory. A number of issues were clarified, in particular that of analytic continuation. Here a major difference is evident from the one-variable theory; while for every open connected set &quot;D&quot; in formula_7 we can find a function that will nowhere continue analytically over the boundary, that cannot be said for . In fact the &quot;D&quot; of that kind are rather special in nature (especially in complex coordinate spaces formula_1 and Stein manifolds, satisfying a condition called &quot;pseudoconvexity&quot;). The natural domains of definition of functions, continued to the limit, are called &quot;Stein manifolds&quot; and their nature was to make sheaf cohomology groups vanish, on the other hand, the Grauert–Riemenschneider vanishing theorem is known as a similar result for compact complex manifolds, and the Grauert–Riemenschneider conjecture is a special case of the conjecture of Narasimhan. In fact it was the need to put (in particular) the work of Oka on a clearer basis that led quickly to the consistent use of sheaves for the formulation of the theory (with major repercussions for algebraic geometry, in particular from Grauert&#x27;s work).

From this point onwards there was a foundational theory, which could be applied to analytic geometry, automorphic forms of several variables, and partial differential equations. The deformation theory of complex structures and complex manifolds was described in general terms by Kunihiko Kodaira and D. C. Spencer. The celebrated paper &quot;GAGA&quot; of Serre pinned down the crossover point from &quot;géometrie analytique&quot; to &quot;géometrie algébrique&quot;.

C. L. Siegel was heard to complain that the new &quot;theory of functions of several complex variables&quot; had few &quot;functions&quot; in it, meaning that the special function side of the theory was subordinated to sheaves. The interest for number theory, certainly, is in specific generalizations of modular forms. The classical candidates are the Hilbert modular forms and Siegel modular forms. These days these are associated to algebraic groups (respectively the Weil restriction from a totally real number field of , and the symplectic group), for which it happens that automorphic representations can be derived from analytic functions. In a sense this doesn&#x27;t contradict Siegel; the modern theory has its own, different directions.

Subsequent developments included the hyperfunction theory, and the edge-of-the-wedge theorem, both of which had some inspiration from quantum field theory. There are a number of other fields, such as Banach algebra theory, that draw on several complex variables.

== The complex coordinate space ==
The complex coordinate space formula_1 is the Cartesian product of copies of formula_10, and when formula_1 is a domain of holomorphy, formula_1 can be regarded as a Stein manifold, and more generalized Stein space. formula_1 is also considered to be a complex projective variety, a Kähler manifold, etc. It is also an -dimensional vector space over the complex numbers, which gives its dimension over formula_14. Hence, as a set and as a topological space, formula_1 may be identified to the real coordinate space formula_16 and its topological dimension is thus .

In coordinate-free language, any vector space over complex numbers may be thought of as a real vector space of twice as many dimensions, where a complex structure is specified by a linear operator (such that ) which defines multiplication by the imaginary unit .

Any such space, as a real space, is oriented. On the complex plane thought of as a Cartesian plane, multiplication by a complex number may be represented by the real matrix
:formula_17
with determinant
:formula_18

Likewise, if one expresses any finite-dimensional complex linear operator as a real matrix (which will be composed from 2 × 2 blocks of the aforementioned form), then its determinant equals to the square of absolute value of the corresponding complex determinant. It is a non-negative number, which implies that the (real) orientation of the space is never reversed by a complex operator. The same applies to Jacobians of holomorphic functions from formula_1 to formula_1.

== Holomorphic functions ==
=== Definition ===

A function &quot;f&quot; defined on a domain formula_21 and with values in formula_22 is said to be holomorphic at a point formula_23 if it is complex-differentiable at this point, in the sense that there exists a complex linear map formula_24 such that

formula_25

The function &quot;f&quot; is said to be holomorphic if it is holomorphic at all points of its domain of definition &quot;D&quot;.

If &quot;f&quot; is holomorphic, then all the partial maps :

formula_26

are holomorphic as functions of one complex variable : we say that &quot;f&quot; is holomorphic in each variable separately. Conversely, if &quot;f&quot; is holomorphic in each variable separately, then &quot;f&quot; is in fact holomorphic : this is known as Hartog&#x27;s theorem, or as Osgood&#x27;s lemma under the additional hypothesis that &quot;f&quot; is continuous.

=== Cauchy–Riemann equations ===

In one complex variable, a function formula_27 defined on the plane is holomorphic at a point formula_28 if and only if its real part formula_29 and its imaginary part formula_30 satisfy the so-called Cauchy-Riemann equations at formula_31 :
formula_32

In several variables, a function formula_33 is holomorphic if and only if it is holomorphic in each variable separately, and hence if and only if the real part formula_29 and the imaginary part formula_30 of formula_36 satisfiy the Cauchy Riemann equations :
formula_37

Using the formalism of Wirtinger derivatives, this can be reformulated as :
formula_38
or even more compactly using the formalism of complex differential forms, as :
formula_39

=== Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula I (Polydisc version) ===
Prove the sufficiency of two conditions (A) and (B). Let &quot;f&quot; meets the conditions of being continuous and separately homorphic on domain &quot;D&quot;. Each disk has a rectifiable curve formula_40, formula_41 is piecewise smoothness, class formula_42 Jordan closed curve. (formula_43) Let formula_44 be the domain surrounded by each formula_41. Cartesian product closure formula_46 is formula_47. Also, take the closed polydisc formula_48 so that it becomes formula_49. formula_50 and let formula_51 be the center of each disk.) Using the Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula of one variable repeatedly, 

: formula_52

Because formula_53 is a rectifiable Jordanian closed curve and &quot;f&quot; is continuous, so the order of products and sums can be exchanged so the iterated integral can be calculated as a multiple integral. Therefore,

==== Cauchy&#x27;s evaluation formula ====
Because the order of products and sums is interchangeable, from () we get

&quot;f&quot; is class formula_54-function.

From (2), if &quot;f&quot; is holomorphic, on polydisc formula_55 and formula_56, the following evaluation equation is obtained.

: formula_57

Therefore, Liouville&#x27;s theorem hold.

==== Power series expansion of holomorphic functions on polydisc ====
If function &quot;f&quot; is holomorphic, on polydisc formula_58, from the Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula, we can see that it can be uniquely expanded to the next power series.

: formula_59

In addition, &quot;f&quot; that satisfies the following conditions is called an analytic function.

For each point formula_60, formula_61 is expressed as a power series expansion that is convergent on &quot;D&quot; :

: formula_62

We have already explained that holomorphic functions on polydisc are analytic. Also, from the theorem derived by Weierstrass, we can see that the analytic function on polydisc (convergent power series) is holomorphic.

:If a sequence of functions formula_63 which converges uniformly on compacta inside a domain &quot;D&quot;, the limit function &quot;f&quot; of formula_64 also uniformly on compacta inside a domain &quot;D&quot;. Also, respective partial derivative of formula_64 also compactly converges on domain &quot;D&quot; to the corresponding derivative of &quot;f&quot;.

:formula_66

==== Radius of convergence of power series ====
It is possible to define a combination of positive real numbers formula_67 such that the power series formula_68 converges uniformly at formula_69 and does not converge uniformly at formula_70.

In this way it is possible to have a similar, combination of radius of convergence for a one complex variable. This combination is generally not unique and there are an infinite number of combinations.

==== Laurent series expansion ====
Let formula_71 be holomorphic in the annulus formula_72 and continuous on their circumference, then there exists the following expansion ;

: formula_73

The integral in the second term, of the right-hand side is performed so as to see the zero on the left in every plane, also this integrated series is uniformly convergent in the annulus formula_74, where formula_75 and formula_76, and so it is possible to integrate term.

=== Bochner–Martinelli formula (Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula II) ===

The Cauchy integral formula holds only for polydiscs, and in the domain of several complex variables, polydiscs are only one of many possible domains, so we introduce the Bochner–Martinelli formula.

Suppose that &quot;f&quot; is a continuously differentiable function on the closure of a domain &quot;D&quot; on formula_1 with piecewise smooth boundary formula_53, and let the symbol formula_79 denotes the exterior or wedge product of differential forms. Then the Bochner–Martinelli formula states that if &quot;z&quot; is in the domain &quot;D&quot; then, for formula_80, &quot;z&quot; in formula_1 the Bochner–Martinelli kernel formula_82 is a differential form in formula_80 of bidegree formula_84, defined by
:formula_85
:formula_86

In particular if &quot;f&quot; is holomorphic the second term vanishes, so 
:formula_87

=== Identity theorem ===
Holomorphic functions of several complex variables satisfy an identity theorem, as in one variable : two holomorphic functions defined on the same connected open set formula_21 and which coincide on an open subset &quot;N&quot; of &quot;D&quot;, are equal on the whole open set &quot;D&quot;. This result can be proven from the fact that holomorphics functions have power series extensions, and it can also be deduced from the one variable case. Contrary to the one variable case, it is possible that two different holomorphic functions coincide on a set which has an accumulation point, for instance the maps formula_89 and formula_90coincide on the whole complex line of formula_91 defined by the equation formula_92.

The maximal principle, inverse function theorem, and implicit function theorems also hold. For a generalized version of the implicit function theorem to complex variables, see the Weierstrass preparation theorem.

=== Biholomorphism ===
From the establishment of the inverse function theorem, the following mapping can be defined.

For the domain &quot;U&quot;, &quot;V&quot; of the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional complex space formula_93, the bijective holomorphic function formula_94 and the inverse mapping formula_95 is also holomorphic. At this time, formula_96 is called a &quot;U&quot;, &quot;V&quot; biholomorphism also, we say that &quot;U&quot; and &quot;V&quot; are biholomorphically equivalent or that they are biholomorphic.

==== The Riemann mapping theorem does not hold ====
When formula_97, open balls and open polydiscs are &quot;not&quot; biholomorphically equivalent, that is, there is no biholomorphic mapping between the two. This was proven by Poincaré in 1907 by showing that their automorphism groups have different dimensions as Lie groups. However, even in the case of several complex variables, there are some results similar to the results of the theory of uniformization in one complex variable.

=== Analytic continuation ===
Let &quot;U, V&quot; be domain on formula_5, such that formula_99 and formula_100, (formula_101 is the set/ring of holomorphic functions on &quot;U&quot;.) assume that formula_102 and formula_103 is a connected component of formula_104. If formula_105 then &quot;f&quot; is said to be connected to &quot;V&quot;, and &quot;g&quot; is said to be analytic continuation of &quot;f&quot;. From the identity theorem, if &quot;g&quot; exists, for each way of choosing &quot;W&quot; it is unique. When n &gt; 2, the following phenomenon occurs depending on the shape of the boundary formula_106: there exists domain &quot;U&quot;, &quot;V&quot;, such that all holomorphic functions formula_36 over the domain &quot;U&quot;, have an analytic continuation formula_100. In other words, there may be not exist a function formula_99 such that formula_106 as the natural boundary. There is called the Hartogs&#x27;s phenomenon. Therefore, researching when domain boundaries become natural boundaries has become one of the main research themes of several complex variables. In addition, when formula_111, it would be that the above &quot;V&quot; has an intersection part with &quot;U&quot; other than &quot;W&quot;. This contributed to advancement of the notion of sheaf cohomology.

== Reinhardt domain ==
In polydisks, the Cauchy&#x27;s integral formula holds and the power series expansion of holomorphic functions is defined, but polydisks and open unit balls are not biholomorphic mapping because the Riemann mapping theorem does not hold, and also, polydisks was possible to separation of variables, but it doesn&#x27;t always hold for any domain. Therefore, in order to study of the domain of convergence of the power series, it was necessary to make additional restriction on the domain, this was the Reinhardt domain. Early knowledge into the properties of field of study of several complex variables, such as Logarithmically-convex, Hartogs&#x27;s extension theorem, etc., were given in the Reinhardt domain.

Let formula_112 (formula_113) to be a domain, with centre at a point formula_114, such that, together with each point formula_115, the domain also contains the set

: formula_116

A domain &quot;D&quot; is called a Reinhardt domain if it satisfies the following conditions:

Let formula_117 is a arbitrary real numbers, a domain &quot;D&quot; is invariant under the rotation: formula_118.

The Reinhardt domains which are defined by the following condition; Together with all points of formula_119, the domain contains the set

: formula_120

A Reinhardt domain &quot;D&quot; is called a complete Reinhardt domain with centre at a point &quot;a&quot; if together with all point formula_121 it also contains the polydisc

: formula_122

A complete Reinhardt domain &quot;D&quot; is star-like with regard to its centre &quot;a&quot;. Therefore, the complete Reinhardt domain is simply connected, also when the complete Reinhardt domain is the boundary line, there is a way to prove the Cauchy&#x27;s integral theorem without using the Jordan curve theorem.

=== Logarithmically-convex ===
When a some complete Reinhardt domain to be the domain of convergence of a power series, an additional condition is required, which is called logarithmically-convex.

A Reinhardt domain &quot;D&quot; is called logarithmically convex if the image formula_123 of the set

: formula_124

under the mapping

: formula_125

is a convex set in the real coordinate space formula_126.

Every such domain in formula_93 is the interior of the set of points of absolute convergence of some power series in formula_128, and conversely; The domain of convergence of every power series in formula_129 is a logarithmically-convex Reinhardt domain with centre formula_130. 
 But, there is an example of a complete Reinhardt domain D which is not logarithmically convex.

=== Some results ===

==== Hartogs&#x27;s extension theorem and Hartogs&#x27;s phenomenon ====
When examining the domain of convergence on the Reinhardt domain, Hartogs found the Hartogs&#x27;s phenomenon in which holomorphic functions in some domain on the formula_5 were all connected to larger domain.

:On the polydisk consisting of two disks formula_132 when formula_133.

:Internal domain of formula_134

::Hartogs&#x27;s extension theorem (1906); Let &quot;f&quot; be a holomorphic function on a set , where is a bounded (surrounded by a rectifiable closed Jordan curve) domain on formula_93 () and &quot;K&quot; is a compact subset of &quot;G&quot;. If the complement is connected, then every holomorphic function &quot;f&quot; regardless of how it is chosen can be each extended to a unique holomorphic function on &quot;G&quot;.
:It is also called Osgood–Brown theorem is that for holomorphic functions of several complex variables, the singularity is a accumulation point, not an isolated point. This means that the various properties that hold for holomorphic functions of one-variable complex variables do not hold for holomorphic functions of several complex variables. The nature of these singularities is also derived from Weierstrass preparation theorem. A generalization of this theorem using the same method as Hartogs was proved in 2007.

From Hartogs&#x27;s extension theorem the domain of convergence extends from formula_136 to formula_137. Looking at this from the perspective of the Reinhardt domain, formula_136 is the Reinhardt domain containing the center z = 0, and the domain of convergence of formula_136 has been extended to the smallest complete Reinhardt domain formula_137 containing formula_136.

==== Thullen&#x27;s classic results ====

Thullen&#x27;s classical result says that a 2-dimensional bounded Reinhard domain containing the origin is biholomorphic to one of the following domains provided that the orbit of the origin by the automorphism group has positive dimension:

# formula_142 (polydisc);
# formula_143 (unit ball);
# formula_144 (Thullen domain).

==== Sunada&#x27;s results ====
Toshikazu Sunada (1978) established a generalization of Thullen&#x27;s result:
:Two &quot;n&quot;-dimensional bounded Reinhardt domains formula_145 and formula_146 are mutually biholomorphic if and only if there exists a transformation formula_147 given by formula_148, formula_149 being a permutation of the indices), such that formula_150.

== Natural domain of the holomorphic function (domain of holomorphy) ==
When moving from the theory of one complex variable to the theory of several complex variables, depending on the range of the domain, it may not be possible to define a holomorphic function such that the boundary of the domain becomes a natural boundary. Considering the domain where the boundaries of the domain are natural boundaries (In the complex coordinate space formula_93 call the domain of holomorphy), the first result of the domain of holomorphy was the holomorphic convexity of &quot;H&quot;. Cartan and Thullen. Levi&#x27;s problem shows that the pseudoconvex domain was a domain of holomorphy. (First for formula_152, later extended to formula_93.) Kiyoshi Oka&#x27;s notion of &quot;idéal de domaines indéterminés&quot; is interpreted theory of sheaf cohomology by 
&quot;H&quot;. Cartan and more development Serre. In sheaf cohomology, the domain of holomorphy has come to be interpreted as the theory of Stein manifolds. The notion of the domain of holomorphy is also considered in other complex manifolds, furthermore also the complex analytic space which is its generalization.

=== Domain of holomorphy ===
When a function &quot;f&quot; is holomorpic on the domain formula_154 and cannot directly connect to the domain outside &quot;D&quot;, including the point of the domain boundary formula_53, the domain &quot;D&quot; is called the domain of holomorphy of &quot;f&quot; and the boundary is called the natural boundary of &quot;f&quot;. In other words, the domain of holomorphy &quot;D&quot; is the supremum of the domain where the holomorphic function &quot;f&quot; is holomorphic, and the domain &quot;D&quot;, which is holomorphic, cannot be extended any more. For several complex variables, i.e. domain formula_156, the boundaries may not be natural boundaries. Hartogs&#x27; extension theorem gives an example of a domain where boundaries are not natural boundaries.

Formally, a domain &quot;D&quot; in the &quot;n&quot;-dimensional complex coordinate space formula_93 is called a &quot;domain of holomorphy&quot; if there do not exist non-empty domain formula_158 and formula_159, formula_160 and formula_161 such that for every holomorphic function &quot;f&quot; on &quot;D&quot; there exists a holomorphic function &quot;g&quot; on &quot;V&quot; with formula_162 on &quot;U&quot;.

For the formula_163 case, the every domain (formula_164) was the domain of holomorphy; we can define a holomorphic function with zeros accumulating everywhere on the boundary of the domain, which must then be a natural boundary for a domain of definition of its reciprocal.

==== Properties of the domain of holomorphy ====
* If formula_165 are domains of holomorphy, then their intersection formula_166 is also a domain of holomorphy.
* If formula_167 is an increasing sequence of domains of holomorphy, then their union formula_168 is also a domain of holomorphy (see Behnke–Stein theorem).
* If formula_169 and formula_170 are domains of holomorphy, then formula_171 is a domain of holomorphy.
* The first Cousin problem is always solvable in a domain of holomorphy, also Cartan showed that the converse of this result was incorrect for formula_172. this is also true, with additional topological assumptions, for the second Cousin problem.

=== Holomorphically convex hull ===
Let formula_173 be a domain, or alternatively for a more general definition, let formula_174 be an formula_175 dimensional complex analytic manifold. Further let formula_176 stand for the set of holomorphic functions on &quot;G&quot;. For a compact set formula_177, the holomorphically convex hull of &quot;K&quot; is

:formula_178

One obtains a narrower concept of polynomially convex hull by taking formula_179 instead to be the set of complex-valued polynomial functions on &quot;G&quot;. The polynomially convex hull contains the holomorphically convex hull.

The domain formula_174 is called holomorphically convex if for every compact subset formula_181 is also compact in &quot;G&quot;. Sometimes this is just abbreviated as &quot;holomorph-convex&quot;.

When formula_163, every domain formula_174 is holomorphically convex since then formula_184 is the union of &quot;K&quot; with the relatively compact components of formula_185.

When formula_186, if &quot;f&quot; satisfies the above holomorphic convexity on &quot;D&quot; it has the following properties. formula_187 for every compact subset &quot;K&quot; in &quot;D&quot;, where
formula_188 denotes the distance between K and formula_189. Also, at this time, D is a domain of holomorphy. Therefore, every convex domain formula_190 is domain of holomorphy.

=== Pseudoconvexity ===
Hartogs showed that

If such a relations holds in the domain of holomorphy of several complex variables, it looks like a more manageable condition than a holomorphically convex. The subharmonic function looks like a kind of convex function, so it was named by Levi as a pseudoconvex domain (Hartogs&#x27;s pseudoconvexity). Pseudoconvex domain (boundary of pseudoconvexity) are important, as they allow for classification of domains of holomorphy. A domain of holomorphy is a global property, by contrast, pseudoconvexity is that local analytic or local geometric property of the boundary of a domain.

==== Definition of plurisubharmonic function ====
:A function
:formula_191
:with &quot;domain&quot; formula_192
is called plurisubharmonic if it is upper semi-continuous, and for every complex line

:formula_193 with formula_194

:the function formula_195 is a subharmonic function on the set

:formula_196

:In &quot;full generality&quot;, the notion can be defined on an arbitrary complex manifold or even a Complex analytic space formula_197 as follows. An upper semi-continuous function
:formula_198
:is said to be plurisubharmonic if and only if for any holomorphic map
formula_199 the function
:formula_200
is subharmonic, where formula_201 denotes the unit disk.

In one-complex variable, necessary and sufficient condition that the real-valued function formula_202, that can be second-order differentiable with respect to &quot;z&quot; of one-variable complex function is subharmonic is formula_203. Therefore, if formula_29 is of class formula_205, then formula_29 is plurisubharmonic if and only if the hermitian matrix formula_207 is positive semidefinite.

Equivalently, a formula_205-function &quot;u&quot; is plurisubharmonic if and only if formula_209 is a positive (1,1)-form.

===== Strictly plurisubharmonic function =====
When the hermitian matrix of &quot;u&quot; is positive-definite and class formula_205, we call &quot;u&quot; a strict plurisubharmonic function.

==== (Weakly) pseudoconvex (p-pseudoconvex) ====
Weak pseudoconvex is defined as : Let formula_211 be a domain. One says that &quot;X&quot; is &quot;pseudoconvex&quot; if there exists a continuous plurisubharmonic function formula_212 on &quot;X&quot; such that the set formula_213 is a relatively compact subset of &quot;X&quot; for all real numbers &quot;x&quot;. i.e. there exists a smooth plurisubharmonic exhaustion function formula_214. Often, the definition of pseudoconvex is used here and is written as; Let &quot;X&quot; be a complex &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold. Then is said to be weeak pseudoconvex there exists a smooth plurisubharmonic exhaustion function formula_214.

==== Strongly (Strictly) pseudoconvex ====
Let &quot;X&quot; be a complex &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold. Strongly (or Strictly) pseudoconvex if there exists a smooth strictly plurisubharmonic exhaustion function formula_214, i.e., formula_217 is positive definite at every point. The strongly pseudoconvex domain is the pseudoconvex domain. Strongly pseudoconvex and strictly pseudoconvex (i.e. 1-convex and 1-complete) are often used interchangeably, see Lempert for the technical difference.

==== Levi form ====

===== (Weakly) Levi(–Krzoska) pseudoconvexity =====
If formula_205 boundary , it can be shown that &quot;D&quot; has a defining function; i.e., that there exists formula_219 which is formula_205 so that formula_221, and formula_222. Now, &quot;D&quot; is pseudoconvex iff for every formula_223 and formula_224 in the complex tangent space at p, that is,

:formula_225, we have
:formula_226

If &quot;D&quot; does not have a formula_205 boundary, the following approximation result can be useful.

Proposition 1 &quot;If &quot;D&quot; is pseudoconvex, then there exist bounded, strongly Levi pseudoconvex domains formula_228 with class formula_229-boundary which are relatively compact in &quot;D&quot;, such that&quot;

:formula_230

This is because once we have a formula_212 as in the definition we can actually find a formula_229 exhaustion function.

===== Strongly (or Strictly) Levi (–Krzoska) pseudoconvex (a.k.a. Strongly (Strictly) pseudoconvex) =====
When the Levi (–Krzoska) form is positive-definite, it is called strongly Levi (–Krzoska) pseudoconvex or often called simply strongly (or strictly) pseudoconvex.

==== Levi total pseudoconvex ====
If for every boundary point formula_233 of &quot;D&quot;, there exists an analytic variety formula_234 passing formula_233 which lies entirely outside &quot;D&quot; in some neighborhood around formula_233, except the point formula_233 itself. Domain &quot;D&quot; that satisfies these conditions is called Levi total pseudoconvex.

==== Oka pseudoconvex ====
===== Family of Oka&#x27;s disk =====
Let &quot;n&quot;-functions formula_238 be continuous on formula_239, holomorphic in formula_240 when the parameter &quot;t&quot; is fixed in [0, 1], and assume that formula_241 are not all zero at any point on formula_242. Then the set formula_243 is called an analytic disc de-pending on a parameter &quot;t&quot;, and formula_244 is called its shell. If formula_245 and formula_246, &quot;Q(t)&quot; is called Family of Oka&#x27;s disk.

===== Definition =====
When formula_247 holds on any family of Oka&#x27;s disk, &quot;D&quot; is called Oka pseudoconvex. Oka&#x27;s proof of Levi&#x27;s problem was that when the unramified Riemann domain over formula_5 was a domain of holomorphy (holomorphically convex), it was proved that it was necessary and sufficient that each boundary point of the domain of holomorphy is an Oka pseudoconvex.

==== Locally pseudoconvex (a.k.a. locally Stein, Cartan pseudoconvex, local Levi property) ====
For every point formula_249 there exist a neighbourhood &quot;U&quot; of &quot;x&quot; and &quot;f&quot; holomorphic. ( i.e. formula_250 be holomorphically convex.) such that &quot;f&quot; cannot be extended to any neighbourhood of &quot;x&quot;. i.e., let formula_251 be a holomorphic map, if every point formula_252 has a neighborhood U such that formula_253 admits a formula_254-plurisubharmonic exhaustion function (weakly 1-complete), in this situation, we call that &quot;X&quot; is locally pseudoconvex (or locally Stein) over &quot;Y&quot;. As an old name, it is also called Cartan pseudoconvex. In formula_93 the locally pseudoconvex domain is itself a pseudoconvex domain and it is a domain of holomorphy. For example, Diederich–Fornæss found local pseudoconvex bounded domains formula_256 with smooth boundary on non-Kähler manifolds such that formula_256 is not weakly 1-complete.

=== Conditions equivalent to domain of holomorphy ===
For a domain formula_258 the following conditions are equivalent:
The implications formula_259, formula_260, and formula_261 are standard results. Proving formula_262, i.e. constructing a global holomorphic function which admits no extension from non-extendable functions defined only locally. This is called the Levi problem (after E. E. Levi) and was solved for unramified Riemann domains over formula_5 by Kiyoshi Oka, but for ramified Riemann domains, pseudoconvexity does not characterize holomorphically convexity, and then by Lars Hörmander using methods from functional analysis and partial differential equations (a consequence of formula_264-problem(equation) with a L2 methods).

== Sheaves ==
The introduction of sheaves into several complex variables allowed the reformulation of and solution to several important problems in the field.

=== Idéal de domaines indéterminés (The predecessor of the notion of the coherent (sheaf)) ===
Oka introduced the notion which he termed &quot;idéal de domaines indéterminés&quot; or &quot;ideal of indeterminate domains&quot;. Specifically, it is a set formula_265 of pairs formula_266, formula_36 holomorphic on a non-empty open set formula_268, such that
The origin of indeterminate domains comes from the fact that domains change depending on the pair formula_266. Cartan translated this notion into the notion of the coherent (sheaf) (Especially, coherent analytic sheaf) in sheaf cohomology. This name comes from 
H. Cartan. Also, Serre (1955) introduced the notion of the coherent sheaf into algebraic geometry, that is, the notion of the coherent algebraic sheaf. The notion of coherent (coherent sheaf cohomology) helped solve the problems in several complex variables.

=== Coherent sheaf ===

==== Definition ====
The definition of the coherent sheaf is as follows.

A quasi-coherent sheaf on a ringed space formula_270 is a sheaf formula_271 of formula_272-modules which has a local presentation, that is, every point in formula_197 has an open neighborhood formula_274 in which there is an exact sequence
:formula_275
for some (possibly infinite) sets formula_276 and formula_277.

A coherent sheaf on a ringed space formula_270 is a sheaf formula_271 satisfying the following two properties:
Morphisms between (quasi-)coherent sheaves are the same as morphisms of sheaves of formula_272-modules.

Also, Jean-Pierre Serre (1955) proves that

:If in an exact sequence formula_281 of sheaves of formula_282-modules two of the three sheaves formula_283 are coherent, then the third is coherent as well.

==== (Oka–Cartan) coherent theorem ====
(Oka–Cartan) coherent theorem says that each sheaf that meets the following conditions is a coherent.
From the above Serre(1955) theorem, formula_284 is a coherent sheaf, also, (i) is used to prove Cartan&#x27;s theorems A and B.

=== Cousin problem ===
In the case of one variable complex functions, Mittag-Leffler&#x27;s theorem was able to create a global meromorphic function from a given and principal parts (Cousin I problem), and Weierstrass factorization theorem was able to create a global meromorphic function from a given zeroes or zero-locus (Cousin II problem). However, these theorems do not hold in several complex variables because the singularities of analytic function in several complex variables are not isolated points; these problems are called the Cousin problems and are formulated in terms of sheaf cohomology. They were first introduced in special cases by Pierre Cousin in 1895. It was Oka who showed the conditions for solving first Cousin problem for the domain of holomorphy on the complex coordinate space, also solving the second Cousin problem with additional topological assumptions. The Cousin problem is a problem related to the analytical properties of complex manifolds, but the only obstructions to solving problems of a complex analytic property are pure topological; Serre called this the Oka principle. They are now posed, and solved, for arbitrary complex manifold &quot;M&quot;, in terms of conditions on &quot;M&quot;. &quot;M&quot;, which satisfies these conditions, is one way to define a Stein manifold. The study of the cousin&#x27;s problem made us realize that in the study of several complex variables, it is possible to study of global properties from the patching of local data, that is it has developed the theory of sheaf cohomology. (e.g.Cartan seminar.)

==== First Cousin problem ====
Without the language of sheaves, the problem can be formulated as follows. On a complex manifold &quot;M&quot;, one is given several meromorphic functions formula_285 along with domains formula_286 where they are defined, and where each difference formula_287 is holomorphic (wherever the difference is defined). The first Cousin problem then asks for a meromorphic function formula_36 on &quot;M&quot; such that formula_289 is &quot;holomorphic&quot; on formula_286; in other words, that formula_36 shares the singular behaviour of the given local function.

Now, let K be the sheaf of meromorphic functions and O the sheaf of holomorphic functions on &quot;M&quot;. The first Cousin problem can always be solved if the following map is surjective:

:formula_292

By the long exact cohomology sequence,

:formula_293

is exact, and so the first Cousin problem is always solvable provided that the first cohomology group &quot;H&quot;1(&quot;M&quot;,O) vanishes. In particular, by Cartan&#x27;s theorem B, the Cousin problem is always solvable if &quot;M&quot; is a Stein manifold.

==== Second Cousin problem ====
The second Cousin problem starts with a similar set-up to the first, specifying instead that each ratio formula_294 is a non-vanishing holomorphic function (where said difference is defined). It asks for a meromorphic function formula_36 on &quot;M&quot; such that formula_296 is holomorphic and non-vanishing.

Let formula_297 be the sheaf of holomorphic functions that vanish nowhere, and formula_298 the sheaf of meromorphic functions that are not identically zero. These are both then sheaves of abelian groups, and the quotient sheaf formula_299 is well-defined. If the following map formula_96 is surjective, then Second Cousin problem can be solved:

:formula_301

The long exact sheaf cohomology sequence associated to the quotient is

:formula_302

so the second Cousin problem is solvable in all cases provided that formula_303

The cohomology group formula_304 for the multiplicative structure on formula_297 can be compared with the cohomology group formula_306 with its additive structure by taking a logarithm. That is, there is an exact sequence of sheaves

:formula_307

where the leftmost sheaf is the locally constant sheaf with fiber formula_308. The obstruction to defining a logarithm at the level of &quot;H&quot;1 is in formula_309, from the long exact cohomology sequence

:formula_310

When &quot;M&quot; is a Stein manifold, the middle arrow is an isomorphism because formula_311 for formula_312 so that a necessary and sufficient condition in that case for the second Cousin problem to be always solvable is that formula_313 (This condition called Oka principle.)

== Manifolds and analytic varieties with several complex variables ==

=== Stein manifold (non-compact Kähler manifold) ===
Since a non-compact (open) Riemann surface always has a non-constant single-valued holomorphic function, and satisfies the second axiom of countability, the open Riemann surface is in fact a &quot;1&quot;-dimensional complex manifold possessing a holomorphic mapping into the complex plane formula_10. (In fact, Gunning and Narasimhan have shown (1967) that every non-compact Riemann surface actually has a holomorphic &quot;immersion&quot; into the complex plane. In other words, there is a holomorphic mapping into the complex plane whose derivative never vanishes.) The Whitney embedding theorem tells us that every smooth &quot;n&quot;-dimensional manifold can be embedded as a smooth submanifold of formula_315, whereas it is &quot;rare&quot; for a complex manifold to have a holomorphic embedding into formula_1. For example, for an arbitrary compact connected complex manifold &quot;X&quot;, every holomorphic function on it is constant by Liouville&#x27;s theorem, and so it cannot have any embedding into complex n-space. That is, for several complex variables, arbitrary complex manifolds do not always have holomorphic functions that are not constants. So, consider the conditions under which a complex manifold has a holomorphic function that is not a constant. Now if we had a holomorphic embedding of &quot;X&quot; into formula_1, then the coordinate functions of formula_1 would restrict to nonconstant holomorphic functions on &quot;X&quot;, contradicting compactness, except in the case that &quot;X&quot; is just a point. Complex manifolds that can be holomorphic embedded into formula_1 are called Stein manifolds. Also Stein manifolds satisfy the second axiom of countability.

A Stein manifold is a complex submanifold of the vector space of &quot;n&quot; complex dimensions. They were introduced by and named after Karl Stein (1951). A Stein space is similar to a Stein manifold but is allowed to have singularities. Stein spaces are the analogues of affine varieties or affine schemes in algebraic geometry. If the univalent domain on formula_1 is connection to a manifold, can be regarded as a complex manifold and satisfies the separation condition described later, the condition for becoming a Stein manifold is to satisfy the holomorphic convexity. Therefore, the Stein manifold is the properties of the domain of definition of the (maximal) analytic continuation of an analytic function.

==== Definition ====
Suppose &quot;X&quot; is a paracompact complex manifolds of complex dimension formula_175 and let formula_322 denote the ring of holomorphic functions on &quot;X&quot;. We call &quot;X&quot; a Stein manifold if the following conditions hold:
Note that condition (3) can be derived from conditions (1) and (2).

==== Every non-compact (open) Riemann surface is a Stein manifold ====

Let &quot;X&quot; be a connected, non-compact (open) Riemann surface. A deep theorem of Behnke and Stein (1948) asserts that &quot;X&quot; is a Stein manifold.

Another result, attributed to Hans Grauert and Helmut Röhrl (1956), states moreover that every holomorphic vector bundle on &quot;X&quot; is trivial. In particular, every line bundle is trivial, so formula_323. The exponential sheaf sequence leads to the following exact sequence:

:formula_324

Now Cartan&#x27;s theorem B shows that formula_325, therefore formula_326.

This is related to the solution of the second (multiplicative) Cousin problem.

==== Levi problems ====
Cartan extended Levi&#x27;s problem to Stein manifolds.
:If the relative compact open subset formula_327 of the Stein manifold X is a Locally pseudoconvex, then &quot;D&quot; is a Stein manifold, and conversely, if &quot;D&quot; is a Locally pseudoconvex, then &quot;X&quot; is a Stein manifold. i.e. Then &quot;X&quot; is a Stein manifold if and only if &quot;D&quot; is locally the Stein manifold.

This was proved by Bremermann by embedding it in a sufficiently high dimensional formula_5, and reducing it to the result of Oka.

Also, Grauert proved for arbitrary complex manifolds &quot;M&quot;.
:If the relative compact subset formula_329 of a arbitrary complex manifold &quot;M&quot; is a strongly pseudoconvex on &quot;M&quot;, then &quot;M&quot; is a holomorphically convex (i.e. Stein manifold). Also, &quot;D&quot; is itself a Stein manifold.

And Narasimhan extended Levi&#x27;s problem to complex analytic space, a generalized in the singular case of complex manifolds.
:A Complex analytic space which admits a continuous strictly plurisubharmonic exhaustion function (i.e.strongly pseudoconvex) is Stein space.

Levi&#x27;s problem remains unresolved in the following cases; 

:Suppose that &quot;X&quot; is a singular Stein space, formula_330 . Suppose that for all formula_331 there is an open neighborhood formula_332 so that formula_333 is Stein space. Is &quot;D&quot; itself Stein?

more generalized

:Suppose that &quot;N&quot; be a Stein space and &quot;f&quot; an injective, and also formula_334 a Riemann unbranched domain, such that map &quot;f&quot; is a locally pseudoconvex map (i.e. Stein morphism). Then &quot;M&quot; is itself Stein ?

and also,

:Suppose that &quot;X&quot; be a Stein space and formula_335 an increasing union of Stein open sets. Then &quot;D&quot; is itself Stein ?

This means that Behnke–Stein theorem, which holds for Stein manifolds, has not found a conditions to be established in Stein space. 

===== K-complete =====
Grauert introduced the concept of K-complete in the proof of Levi&#x27;s problem.

Let &quot;X&quot; is complex manifold, &quot;X&quot; is K-complete if, to each point formula_336, there exist finitely many holomorphic map formula_337 of &quot;X&quot; into formula_338, formula_339, such that formula_340 is an isolated point of the set formula_341. This concept also applies to complex analytic space.

==== Properties and examples of Stein manifolds ====
* The standard complex space formula_93 is a Stein manifold.
* Every domain of holomorphy in formula_93 is a Stein manifold.
* It can be shown quite easily that every closed complex submanifold of a Stein manifold is a Stein manifold, too.
* The embedding theorem for Stein manifolds states the following: Every Stein manifold &quot;X&quot; of complex dimension &quot;n&quot; can be embedded into formula_344 by a biholomorphic proper map.

These facts imply that a Stein manifold is a closed complex submanifold of complex space, whose complex structure is that of the ambient space (because the embedding is biholomorphic).
* Every Stein manifold of (complex) dimension &quot;n&quot; has the homotopy type of an &quot;n&quot;-dimensional CW-Complex.
* In one complex dimension the Stein condition can be simplified: a connected Riemann surface is a Stein manifold if and only if it is not compact. This can be proved using a version of the Runge theorem for Riemann surfaces, due to Behnke and Stein.
* Every Stein manifold &quot;X&quot; is holomorphically spreadable, i.e. for every point formula_345, there are &quot;n&quot; holomorphic functions defined on all of &quot;X&quot; which form a local coordinate system when restricted to some open neighborhood of &quot;x&quot;.
* The first Cousin problem can always be solved on a Stein manifold.
* Being a Stein manifold is equivalent to being a (complex) &quot;strongly pseudoconvex manifold&quot;. The latter means that it has a strongly pseudoconvex (or plurisubharmonic) exhaustive function, i.e. a smooth real function formula_346 on &quot;X&quot; (which can be assumed to be a Morse function) with formula_347, such that the subsets formula_348 are compact in &quot;X&quot; for every real number &quot;c&quot;. This is a solution to the so-called Levi problem, named after E. E. Levi (1911). The function formula_346 invites a generalization of &quot;Stein manifold&quot; to the idea of a corresponding class of compact complex manifolds with boundary called Stein domain. A Stein domain is the preimage formula_350. Some authors call such manifolds therefore strictly pseudoconvex manifolds.
*Related to the previous item, another equivalent and more topological definition in complex dimension 2 is the following: a Stein surface is a complex surface &quot;X&quot; with a real-valued Morse function &quot;f&quot; on &quot;X&quot; such that, away from the critical points of &quot;f&quot;, the field of complex tangencies to the preimage formula_351 is a contact structure that induces an orientation on &quot;Xc&quot; agreeing with the usual orientation as the boundary of formula_352 That is, formula_353 is a Stein filling of &quot;Xc&quot;.

Numerous further characterizations of such manifolds exist, in particular capturing the property of their having &quot;many&quot; holomorphic functions taking values in the complex numbers. See for example Cartan&#x27;s theorems A and B, relating to sheaf cohomology.

In the GAGA set of analogies, Stein manifolds correspond to affine varieties.

Stein manifolds are in some sense dual to the elliptic manifolds in complex analysis which admit &quot;many&quot; holomorphic functions from the complex numbers into themselves. It is known that a Stein manifold is elliptic if and only if it is fibrant in the sense of so-called &quot;holomorphic homotopy theory&quot;.

=== Complex projective varieties (compact complex manifold) ===
Meromorphic function in one-variable complex function were studied in a 
compact (closed) Riemann surface, because since the Riemann-Roch theorem (Riemann&#x27;s inequality) holds for compact Riemann surfaces (Therefore the theory of compact Riemann surface can be regarded as the theory of (smooth (non-singular) projective) algebraic curve over formula_22). In fact, compact Riemann surface had a non-constant single-valued meromorphic function, and also a compact Riemann surface had enough meromorphic functions. A compact one-dimensional complex manifold was a Riemann sphere formula_355. However, the abstract notion of a compact Riemann surface is always algebraizable (The Riemann&#x27;s existence theorem, Kodaira embedding theorem.), but it is not easy to verify which compact complex analytic spaces are algebraizable. In fact, Hopf found a class of compact complex manifolds without nonconstant meromorphic functions. However, there is a Siegel result that gives the necessary conditions for compact complex manifolds to be algebraic. The generalization of the Riemann-Roch theorem to several complex variables was first extended to compact analytic surfaces by Kodaira, Kodaira also extended the theorem to three-dimensional, and n-dimensional Kähler varieties. Serre formulated the Riemann–Roch theorem as a problem of dimension of coherent sheaf cohomology, and also Serre proved Serre duality. Cartan and Serre proved the following property: the cohomology group is finite-dimensional for a coherent sheaf on a compact complex manifold M. Riemann–Roch on a Riemann surface for a vector bundle was proved by Weil in 1938. 
Hirzebruch generalized the theorem to compact complex manifolds in 1994 and Grothendieck generalized it to a relative version (relative statements about morphisms.). Next, the generalization of the result that &quot;the compact Riemann surfaces are projective&quot; to the high-dimension. In particular, consider the conditions that when embedding of compact complex submanifold &quot;X&quot; into the complex projective space formula_4. The vanishing theorem (was first introduced by Kodaira in 1953) gives the condition, when the sheaf cohomology group vanishing, and the condition is to satisfy a kind of positivity. As an application of this theorem, the Kodaira embedding theorem says that a compact Kähler manifold &quot;M&quot;, with a Hodge metric, there is a complex-analytic embedding of &quot;M&quot; into complex projective space of enough high-dimension &quot;N&quot;. In addition the Chow&#x27;s theorem shows that the complex analytic subspace (subvariety) of a closed complex projective space to be an algebraic that is, so it is the common zero of some homogeneous polynomials, such a relationship is one example of what is called Serre&#x27;s GAGA principle. The complex analytic sub-space(variety) of the complex projective space has both algebraic and analytic properties. Then combined with Kodaira&#x27;s result, a compact Kähler manifold &quot;M&quot; embeds as an algebraic variety. This result gives an example of a complex manifold with enough meromorphic functions. Broadly, the GAGA principle says that the geometry of projective complex analytic spaces (or manifolds) is equivalent to the geometry of projective complex varieties. The combination of analytic and algebraic methods for complex projective varieties lead to areas such as Hodge theory. Also, the deformation theory of compact complex manifolds has developed as Kodaira–Spencer theory. However, despite being a compact complex manifold, there are counterexample of that cannot be embedded in projective space and are not algebraic.
