<text>Madden NFL (known as John Madden Football until 1993) is an American football sports video game series developed by EA Orlando for EA Sports. The franchise, named after Pro Football Hall of Fame coach and commentator John Madden, has sold more than 130 million copies as of 2018. From 2004 until 2022, it was the only officially licensed National Football League (NFL) video game series, and has influenced many players and coaches of the physical sport. Among the series&#x27; features are detailed playbooks and player statistics and voice commentary in the style of a real NFL television broadcast. the franchise has generated over $4 billion in sales, making it one of the most profitable video game franchises on the market.

Electronic Arts (EA) founder Trip Hawkins conceived the series and approached Madden in 1984 for his endorsement and expertise. Because of Madden&#x27;s insistence that the game be as realistic as possible, the first version of &quot;John Madden Football&quot; did not appear until 1988. EA has released annual versions since 1990 with the number used in each release generally representing the year after the game&#x27;s release date and the NFL season the game was based on. (For example Madden NFL 2005 was released in 2004 and was based on the 2004 NFL season.)

== History ==

===1980s – Creation===
Trip Hawkins created a clone of the Strat-O-Matic paper and dice-based football simulation game as a teenager. The game was unsuccessful due to its complexity, and he hoped to one day delegate its rules to a computer. At Harvard College, where Hawkins played football for the Crimson, he wrote a football simulation for the PDP-11 minicomputer which, he later said, predicted that the Miami Dolphins would defeat the Minnesota Vikings 23–6 (actually 24–7) in the 1974 Super Bowl. After founding Electronic Arts in 1982—&quot;The real reason that I founded [it] was because I wanted to make computerized versions of games like Strat-O-Matic&quot;, Hawkins later said—the company began designing a microcomputer football game. Hawkins first approached his favorite player Joe Montana to endorse the proposed game but the quarterback already had an endorsement deal with Atari, Inc., and his second choice, Cal coach Joe Kapp, demanded up-front royalties far in excess of what Hawkins was willing to pay.

In 1984, Hawkins approached Madden. He and game producer Joe Ybarra arranged a follow-up meeting with the broadcaster during an Amtrak train trip over two days because of Madden&#x27;s fear of flying. The EA executives promised that the proposed game would be a sophisticated football simulation and they asked the retired Oakland Raiders coach for his endorsement and expertise. Madden knew nothing about computers beyond his telestrator but agreed; he had taught a class at the University of California, Berkeley, called &quot;Football for Fans&quot;, and envisioned the program as a tool for teaching and testing plays. (Madden would continue to see the game as an educational tool. When asked in 2012 to describe &quot;Madden NFL&quot;, he called it &quot;a way for people to learn the game and participate in the game at a pretty sophisticated level&quot;.) Hawkins and Ybarra during the train trip learned football plays and strategies from Madden from sunrise to midnight.

EA likely expected Madden to endorse the game without participating in its design. Early plans envisioned six or seven players per team because of technical limitations but Madden insisted on having 11 players, stating &quot;I&#x27;m not putting my name on it if it&#x27;s not real&quot;. Ybarra, who had played chess, not football, in high school, became an expert on the subject through his work, but found that 11 players overwhelmed contemporary home computers. Most projects that are as delayed as &quot;Madden&quot; are canceled; Ybarra and developer Robin Antonick needed three years, more than twice the length of the average development process. The project became known within the company as &quot;Trip&#x27;s Folly&quot;, and Madden—who had received $100,000 advance against royalties that EA&#x27;s outside auditors advised to write-off because it would never be recouped—believed at times that EA had given up.

The company hired Bethesda Softworks to finish the game, but this only got them partway to their goal. While EA used many of its designs, including contributions to their physics engine, within a year Bethesda stopped working on &quot;Madden&quot; and sued EA over EA&#x27;s failure to publish new versions of Bethesda&#x27;s &quot;Gridiron!&quot; football game. This added to the delay. After a final development push, &quot;John Madden Football&quot; debuted in 1988 for the Apple II computers. Hawkins and an exhausted Ybarra (&quot;All my memories are of pain&quot;) could move on to other projects.

Contracted to provide plays, Madden gave EA the 1980 Raiders playbook, and EA hired &quot;San Francisco Examiner&quot; writer Frank Cooney, who had designed his own figurine football game with numerical skill ratings. Those skill ratings, also utilized in a spreadsheet based game called Grid Grade, were a precursor to player ratings in Madden Football. Although the company could not yet legally use NFL teams&#x27; or players&#x27; names, Cooney obtained real plays from NFL teams. The back of the box called the game &quot;The First Real Football Simulation&quot; and quoted Madden: &quot;Hey, if there aren&#x27;t 11 players, it isn&#x27;t real football.&quot; Documentation included diagrams of dozens of offensive and defensive plays with Madden&#x27;s commentary on coaching strategies and philosophy. In addition to submitting plays, Cooney worked with programmers and producers to create numerical ratings for every player so they would perform appropriately in the game, especially in man-to-man situations. In the beginning there were eight to 12 traits that were graded for each player. That number would grow to more than 200 as the game became more sophisticated. The game sold moderately well but given the sophisticated playbook its interface was complex, and Madden&#x27;s insistence on 11 players caused the game to run slowly.

During this period, Madden turned down the opportunity to buy an &quot;unlimited&quot; number of options for EA stock in its initial public offering, a decision he later called &quot;the dumbest thing I ever did in my life&quot;.

===1990s===
In early 1990, EA hired Park Place Productions to develop &quot;Madden&quot; for the Sega Genesis video game console. Park Place had developed &quot;ABC Monday Night Football&quot; with &quot;arcade-style, action-heavy&quot; game play, and its &quot;Madden&quot; also emphasized hyperreality compared to the computer version&#x27;s focus on exact simulation. Impressed with Park Place&#x27;s work, EA chose it for the Genesis &quot;Madden&quot; instead of completing an in-house version by Antonick.

EA reverse engineered the console to sell the game without paying the standard $8 to $10 license fee per cartridge to Sega, then proposed a compromise of $2 per cartridge and a $2 million cap on the fee. The console maker agreed, afraid that EA would sell its reverse-engineered knowledge to other companies; the agreement saved EA $35 million over the next three years. As its own Joe Montana-endorsed football game would miss the 1990 Christmas shopping season, Sega asked EA to let it sell &quot;Madden&quot; with the Montana name. EA refused, but offered an inferior alternative that lacked &quot;Madden&quot;&#x27;s 3D graphics and most of its 113 plays. &quot;Joe Montana Football&quot; sold well despite shipping after Christmas 1990, and it remained popular after BlueSky Software took over development. &quot;John Madden Football&quot; for the Genesis, however, became both the first hugely successful &quot;Madden&quot; game—selling 400,000 copies when the company expected 75,000—and the first killer app for EA and Sega, helping the console gain market share against the Super NES. From 1992 to 1994, &quot;Mega&quot; placed the game at #1 in their monthly Top 100 Mega Drive Games of All Time.

In 1990, EA producer Richard Hilleman brought in veteran sports game designer Scott Orr, who had founded the mid-1980s Commodore 64 game publisher GameStar and led the design of their best-selling sports games. The team of Orr and Hilleman designed and led the development of what is today still recognizable as the modern &quot;Madden&quot;. Early versions of &quot;Madden&quot; were created by external development studios such as Bethesda, Visual Concepts, and Stormfront Studios. &quot;John Madden Football &#x27;92&quot; also featured the ambulance which would run over any players in its path.

After Visual Concepts failed to deliver &quot;Madden NFL &#x27;96&quot; for the new PlayStation in 1995, EA hired Tiburon Entertainment for &quot;Madden NFL &#x27;97&quot; and later acquired the company, centralizing development in-house. It planned to release &quot;John Madden Football&quot; as its first sports-based arcade game, but the game was cancelled due to unenthusiastic reactions from play testers. EA&#x27;s refusal to release &quot;Madden&quot; and other sports titles for the Dreamcast in 1999 contributed to the console&#x27;s lack of success and Sega&#x27;s exit from the hardware market.

By 1996, &quot;Madden&quot; was the best-selling sports video game franchise, with more than eight million units sold up until then.

====Franchise Mode====

In 1998, Electronic Arts added &quot;Franchise Mode&quot; to &quot;Madden Football&quot;, giving players the ability to play multiple seasons, make off-season draft picks, and trade players.
Within Franchise Mode, players take on the role of general manager and manage all personnel matters, including contracts, free agency, draft picks, and hiring and firing coaches. The player also acts as a head coach-like character (although there is a head coach figure in-game), choosing which players to play, making substitutions, running practices, practicing gameplans, etc.

Players may play with any of the NFL&#x27;s 32 franchises; they can choose whether or not to have trade deadlines and salary caps and if they want to start their franchise with a 49-round fantasy draft of all active NFL players. Players can also upload created teams for use in the game.

Once in game, players run training camp (individual drills for improving players&#x27; attributes), play in preseason games and compete in a regular 16-game NFL season, including playoffs and the Super Bowl. The player has the option to play any game in the simulation, including those involving other teams if they so desire, or may simulate through the games as they choose. Most versions of &quot;Madden&quot; give a player 30 years with their franchise, sometimes with an opportunity to apply for the Hall of Fame at the end of the simulation.

Throughout the history of Franchise Mode, there have been many issues and glitches including data corruption, gameplay bugs, and developer mistakes. Franchise Mode is one of Madden&#x27;s most consistently criticized game modes each year.

===2000s===
====&quot;Madden NFL 2000&quot;====
&quot;Madden NFL 2000&quot; was the first Madden to have a play editor, arcade mode, and the Madden Challenge. The game was released on August 31, 1999, for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation, Game Boy, Nintendo 64, and Classic Mac OS. The cover athletes were former Raiders Coach John Madden and the Detroit Lions running back Barry Sanders in the background. This was the second Madden to have someone besides John Madden on the cover.

====&quot;Madden NFL 2001&quot;====
&quot;Madden NFL 2001&quot; featured a segment called &quot;Great Games&quot; where one would be put in a situation where they control one team and would have to win the game with a set amount of time. If the player wins, they unlock either a new team or a stadium. Overall, there were more than 60 teams and over 80 stadiums in &quot;Madden NFL 2001&quot;. Tennessee Titans running back Eddie George is the cover athlete.

====&quot;Madden NFL 2002&quot;====
&quot;Madden NFL 2002&quot; featured for the first time Create-A-Team where one would make a team and play with that team in either Play Now or Franchise mode. It also featured Create-A-League mode but it never caught on. Create-A-Team was not featured in &quot;Madden NFL 13&quot; and moving teams was first featured in &quot;Madden NFL 2004&quot; called &quot;Stadium&quot; in the Franchise mode of the game. &quot;Madden NFL 2002&quot; was the 2nd highest selling game in 2002. Minnesota Vikings quarterback Daunte Culpepper is the cover athlete.

====&quot;Madden NFL 2003&quot;====
There are multiple modes of game play, from a quick head-to-head game to running a team for a whole season or even multiple seasons. Online play, which was a new feature for &quot;Madden NFL 2003&quot; (in this version there are also mini-camp challenges) was only available for users of the PlayStation 2 console, Xbox console, or a Microsoft Windows PC until early 2004. St. Louis Rams running back Marshall Faulk is the cover athlete.

====&quot;Madden NFL 2004&quot;====
Also, starting with &quot;Madden NFL 2004&quot;, EA Sports created the new &quot;Playmaker&quot; tool, using the right analog joystick found on each of the adjustments previously unavailable in prior installments of the franchise. One such adjustment includes the ability to switch which direction a running play was going without changing the formation. Prior to the Playmaker tool, the Player could only call one of four available &quot;hot routes.&quot; With Playmaker and the use of the right thumb stick, the player is given 4 additional Hot Route options. When the quarterback has the ball the Playmaker Tool can be used to make receivers alter their routes mid-play. When running the ball on offense, the runner can control the direction in which the blocker is going. Defensive alignment adjustments, however, were not available leading to obvious imbalance in favor of the Offensive player. Atlanta Falcons quarterback Michael Vick is the cover athlete.

====&quot;Madden NFL 2005&quot;====
In &quot;Madden NFL 2005&quot;, EA Sports ran a campaign with the Theme &quot;Fear the D&quot; emphasising their improvements on the &quot;other side of the ball.&quot; In an attempt to re-balance the players experience, EA gave a Playmaker Tool to the defense. Similar to the offensive Playmaker Tool, the defensive Playmaker allows the player to make pre-snap defensive adjustments. EA Sports further utilized the right analog joystick on defense by creating the &quot;Hit Stick&quot;, an option on defense that allows the controlled player to make big hits, with a simple flick, that increases the chances the ball carrier will fumble. Also introduced for the first time is the &quot;Formation Shift.&quot; This new feature allowed players to shift their formation in the pre-snap audible menu without actually changing the play. For example, if you call a run play up the middle out of a goal line formation, you could then call a formation shift and make your players spread out into a four wide receiver formation while still in the same running play. The problem with this new function was that EA also added a fatigue penalty for the defense causing defensive players to get more tired each time there was a formation shift. This led to players on offense calling multiple formation shifts each play making the defensive players too exhausted to keep up and force them to substitute out of the game until they are fully rested. This led to more imbalance that could only be fixed by turning off fatigue. Baltimore Ravens linebacker Ray Lewis is the cover athlete.

&quot;2005&quot; also added &quot;EA Sports Radio&quot;, a fictional show that plays during the menu screen of Franchise mode to provide a greater sense of a storyline during gameplay. It features Tony Bruno as the host, who often interviews players and coaches about how the season is going and also has quiz questions in which fake listeners call in to make attempts at answering football-related questions. It included mock interviews of famous NFL players and coaches throughout the in-game season. Some fans have criticized EA Sports for not including new features to the &#x27;programming&#x27; as the radio became stale after only two seasons in franchise mode, but the feature drew acclaim for adding content to the Franchise menu. Also added was the Newspaper where the player could look at National News from licensed USA Today and Licensed Local papers for almost each of the 32 NFL teams. Lastly, 2005 also saw the introduction of multiple progressions during franchise mode. Previously NFL players in Madden would only progress or regress at the end of each season. Now at the end of Week 5, 11, and 17 the game would use a program to &quot;progress&quot; players based on their performance in addition to end of season progression.

====&quot;Madden NFL 06&quot;====
In &quot;Madden NFL 06&quot;, the &quot;Truck Stick&quot; was introduced. This feature allows the offensive player to lower his shoulder and break a tackle, or back juke to avoid one. Another new feature is the &quot;Superstar Mode&quot;, which allows the player to take control of a rookie and progress through his career. This includes an IQ test, interviews, workouts, the NFL Draft, hiring an agent, and other aspects of a superstar&#x27;s life. Philadelphia Eagles quarterback Donovan McNabb is the cover athlete.

EA also introduced the &quot;QB Vision&quot; feature in the 2006 installment. With this feature, a cone of spotlight emits from the quarterback during passing plays, simulating his field of vision. To make an accurate pass, the quarterback must have his intended receiver in his field of vision. Passing to a receiver not in the cone reduces pass accuracy significantly. The size of the quarterback&#x27;s vision cone is directly correlated to his Awareness and Passer Accuracy rating; Brett Favre and Peyton Manning see nearly the entire field at once, whereas an inexperienced quarterback such as J. P. Losman or Kyle Boller sees only a sliver of the field. This feature also allows for bigger plays and more interceptions.

Also, EA sports added the &quot;Smart Route&quot;. This means that when pressing a hot route to the corresponding receiver, you put the analog stick down and the receiver will run to the first down, and you can throw him the ball.

While current gen Madden remained the same with the exception of a &quot;Smart Route&quot; and &quot;QB Vision&quot;, this was also the first year Madden was released on the next-gen Xbox 360. It was completely stripped down, almost every change made in the previous gen was wiped away.

====&quot;EA Sports Madden NFL Football&quot;====
This is an arcade game developed by Global VR and released in 2005. The game comes in standard and deluxe cabinets. It can be played with up to four players and includes five game modes: Exhibition, Training, Tournament, Competition, and Career. It features rosters from the 2004–2005 season.

====&quot;Madden NFL 07&quot;====
In &quot;Madden NFL 07&quot;, EA introduced &quot;Lead Blocker Controls&quot; which allow users to control blockers during running plays. In addition, EA redefined the Truck Stick into the &quot;Highlight Stick&quot;. With the Highlight Stick, users can have their running backs perform different running moves and combos, instead of just bowling over defenders. Truck Stick features still exist for bigger backs, but not for smaller backs who would never realistically use them anyway. Instead, more agile backs perform acrobatic ducks and dodges to avoid tackles. Seattle Seahawks running back Shaun Alexander is the cover athlete.

====&quot;EA Sports Madden NFL Football: Season 2&quot;====
This game is the sequel to EA Sports Madden NFL Football. Like the original, it was also developed by Global VR. It was released in 2006 only in arcades. This version adds QB Vision, the Hit Stick, and the Truck Stick. The rosters are also updated for the 2006–2007 season.

====&quot;Madden NFL 08&quot;====
In &quot;Madden NFL 08&quot;, the &quot;Weapons&quot; feature was added, allowing superstar players to be noticed. Randy Moss, for example, is a Go-To-Guy, allowing him to make amazing one-handed grabs. Peyton Manning is a Franchise QB. It also includes new skill drills, Hit Stick 2.0, and Ring of a Champion features. Tennessee Titans quarterback Vince Young is on the cover. &quot;Madden NFL 08&quot; was also the last &quot;Madden&quot; game released for macOS and the last GameCube game ever released. It was also the last to appear on Windows until &quot;Madden NFL 19&quot; in 2018.

====&quot;Madden NFL 09&quot;====
&quot;Madden NFL 09&quot; was released on August 12, 2008. Citing business concerns, EA chose not to release the game on PC platforms. The game features quarterback Brett Favre on the front cover, initially in a Green Bay Packers uniform, but also with a downloadable cover featuring Favre in a New York Jets uniform. Favre had retired before the start of the season as a member of the Packers, but came out of retirement late in the summer and was traded to the Jets. &quot;Madden NFL 09&quot; was the first of the series to offer online, league game play, allowing up to 32 players to compete in an online, simulated NFL season. EA Sports Senior Producer Phil Frazier, up to 32 players were able to participate in competitive games, the NFL Draft and conduct trades between their teams. The game was also the first of the series to incorporate a Madden IQ. The Madden IQ is used to automatically gauge your skills through a series of mini-games consisting of run offense, pass offense, run defense, and pass defense. At the end of each of the drills, the player receives a score ranging from rookie to all-Madden. The final Madden IQ is a mixture of those scores which is used to control the game&#x27;s difficulty.

====&quot;Madden NFL 10&quot;====
&quot;Madden NFL 10&quot; was released on August 14, 2009. It features Arizona Cardinals wide receiver Larry Fitzgerald and Pittsburgh Steelers strong safety Troy Polamalu. Compared to previous iterations, Madden NFL 10 has been extremely transparent with its development efforts, maintaining a weekly blog updates as well as a constant presence on various message boards. A new design team has also taken over the game, including members from NFL Head Coach 09. The direction of Madden NFL 10 has been shifted to much more of a realistic and simulation focus, with info already released including Procedural Awareness (a robust head tracking system), a new philosophy on player ratings, and big improvements to realism in QB play, WR/DB play, and other areas across the game. Madden 10 has several new features including the PRO-TAK animation technology, which allows up to nine man gang tackles and fumble pile-ups to help players &#x27;fight for every yard&#x27;, in this year&#x27;s tagline. Madden 10 also features an in-game weekly recap show called The Extra Point. Madden 10 offers a series of multiple play packages. This allows for more options to score. This version features a completely overhauled rating system for players, featuring new categories such as throw on the run and specific ratings for short, medium, and deep passes. The game&#x27;s soundtrack features rap, alternative rock, rap metal and hard rock bands such as Nirvana, Pantera, System of a Down, and Kid Rock.

===2010s===
====&quot;Madden NFL 11&quot;====
&quot;Madden NFL 11&quot; was released on July 27, 2010 (moved up from its original release date of August 10, 2010 for promotional reasons), and features New Orleans Saints quarterback Drew Brees on the cover. It features several new additions to the franchise, such as Online Team Play, Online Scouting and online attribute boosts for co-op play. Along with these new game additions is a new rating (sponsored by Old Spice) known as Swagger. Although early speculation was that this new rating would be reflective of &quot;confidence&quot; or &quot;composure,&quot; it was quickly confirmed to be directly tied to a player&#x27;s personality for celebrations.

====&quot;Madden NFL 12&quot;====
&quot;Madden NFL 12&quot; was released on August 25, 2011. The release was delayed by two weeks due to the NFL lockout, and features Cleveland Browns running back Peyton Hillis on the cover. However, there is a limited edition in which the cover features St. Louis Rams running back Marshall Faulk.

====&quot;Madden NFL 13&quot;====
&quot;Madden NFL 13&quot; was released on August 28, 2012, and features Detroit Lions wide receiver Calvin Johnson as the cover athlete. &quot;Madden NFL 13&quot; is the first &quot;Madden&quot; game to be released on the PlayStation Vita, and it is also the first game in the series to have Kinect support as well as a new physics engine promoting real in game physics.

&quot;Madden NFL 13&quot; included a complete revamp to online franchise mode which became known as Connected Careers Mode (CCM). Some of the new CCM features included player contracts, the ability to trade draft picks, a salary cap, and up to 30 seasons worth of gameplay.

====&quot;Madden NFL 25&quot;====
In early 2013, EA Sports announced that the next installment of the Madden series would be released on August 27, 2013. As this installment is the 25th anniversary of the series, the game is called &quot;Madden NFL 25&quot;, instead of &quot;Madden NFL 14&quot; with the year like the previous versions. The cover vote consisted of two brackets containing past players (&quot;Old School&quot;) and active players (&quot;New School&quot;).

&quot;Old School&quot; player and Pro Football Hall of Famer Barry Sanders was chosen as the cover athlete for &quot;Madden NFL 25&quot; on the April 24, 2013, episode of ESPN&#x27;s &quot;SportsNation&quot;. The &quot;New School&quot; finalist was Adrian Peterson.

====&quot;Madden NFL 15&quot;====
On March 13, 2014 EA Sports posted on its website that user would be able to design and submit uniforms for Connected Careers by March 17, 2014, for &quot;the next Madden NFL.&quot; On April 28, 2014, EA announced the release of Madden 15 pre-ordering in a release video with NFL linebacker and 2013 Defensive Player of the Year Luke Kuechly. The game was released August 26 in North America and on August 29 in the EU for Xbox One, PlayStation 4, Xbox 360 and the PlayStation 3. The game featured &quot;dramatic all-new camera angles, as well as dynamic pre-game and halftime features.&quot; During the Detroit Lions 10th pick of the 2014 NFL draft, Barry Sanders announced fans again would be able to vote for the cover athlete. On June 6, Seattle Seahawks cornerback Richard Sherman was announced as the cover athlete.

====&quot;Madden NFL 16&quot;====
EA decided not to have players vote for the cover athlete through a traditional bracket, but rather through collectible cards in &quot;Madden NFL Mobile&quot;, or through Ultimate Team on the console devices. On May 4, 2015, the four finalists were announced for the 2016 game cover: New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski, Arizona Cardinals cornerback Patrick Peterson, New York Giants wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. and Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown. On May 13, Beckham Jr. beat out Gronkowski in a fan vote for the cover of &quot;Madden 16&quot;. It was released on August 25, 2015.

====&quot;Madden NFL 17&quot;====
&quot;Madden NFL 17&quot; was released on August 23, 2016. The features in the game include an upgrade of the Ground Game, a redesigned and better Franchise Mode, &quot;Madden 365&quot;, new Ball Carrier UI Prompts, the new Path Assist and more. New England Patriots tight end Rob Gronkowski serves as the cover athlete.

====&quot;Madden NFL 18&quot;====
&quot;Madden NFL 18&quot; was released on August 25, 2017. The game is the first in the series to be developed in the Frostbite Engine, and it incorporates a story mode titled Longshot Mode, akin to &quot;The Journey&quot; in FIFA 17. It was announced that New England Patriots quarterback Tom Brady would be on the cover, marking the second consecutive year where a Patriot will be on the cover. Furthermore, an enhanced G.O.A.T. edition was also announced.

====&quot;Madden NFL 19&quot;====
&quot;Madden NFL 19&quot; was announced with Pittsburgh Steelers wide receiver Antonio Brown as the cover athlete. It was released on August 10, 2018. This is the first entry since &quot;Madden NFL 08&quot; in 2007 to receive a Windows release.

====&quot;Madden NFL 20&quot;====
&quot;Madden NFL 20&quot; was announced with Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes as the cover athlete. It was released on August 2, 2019. This game features an online eliminator mode called Superstar K.O., as well as a revamped story mode titled Face of the Franchise: QB1.

===2020s===
====&quot;Madden NFL 21&quot;====
&quot;Madden NFL 21&quot; was announced with Baltimore Ravens quarterback Lamar Jackson as the cover athlete. It was released on August 28, 2020. Introduced that year was a new, backyard-football inspired online mode called The Yard, similar to NBA 2k&#x27;s &quot;MyPark.&quot;

Due to the Washington Redskins announcing the retirement of the team&#x27;s controversial moniker on July 13, 2020, EA announced on July 17 that it would be doing an update on &quot;Madden NFL 21&quot; to remove the team&#x27;s logo and name and replacing them with a generic Washington logo and name pending further developments.

====&quot;Madden NFL 22&quot;====
&quot;Madden NFL 22&quot; was announced with both Tampa Bay Buccaneers quarterback Tom Brady and Kansas City Chiefs quarterback Patrick Mahomes as the cover athletes. It was the second cover appearance for both players.

The cover of the next gen version is a picture of Madden celebrating his victory as the head coach of the Oakland Raiders at Super Bowl XI. The All Madden Edition is based on the cover of the series&#x27; 1st installment, &quot;John Madden Football&quot;, made by Chuck Styles.

====&quot;Madden NFL 24&quot;====

===License history and spinoffs===
====Licensing====
Until 1993, the Madden series did not have official licenses from the National Football League (NFL) or National Football League Players Association (NFLPA). &quot;Madden NFL &#x27;94&quot; was the first game in the series to include real NFL teams, and &quot;Madden NFL &#x27;95&quot; added an NFLPA license for real players through the National Football League Players Incorporated (NFLPI). The licenses restrict EA from including certain content in current &quot;Madden&quot; games, such as the humorous ambulance that picks up injured players in 1991&#x27;s &quot;John Madden Football II&quot;. The NFL Coaches Association sold the rights to have NFL coaches&#x27; names appear in the &quot;Madden NFL&quot; games; &quot;Madden NFL 2001&quot; was the first game in the series to feature this license. Neither New England Patriots coach Bill Belichick nor Bill Parcells appeared in the game as they are not members of the NFL Coaches Association. Likewise, non-NFLPA players (such as Thurman Thomas during his playing career) do not appear in the game, instead being replaced with generic placeholders.

====Exclusivity====
In 2004, EA signed an exclusive licensing rights agreement through 2009 with the NFL and the NFLPA to give the company the exclusive rights to use the NFL&#x27;s teams, stadiums, and players in a video game. Mike Mika, who was working on &quot;NFL 2K&quot;, described the agreement as &quot;like a nuclear bomb going off in the game industry&quot;, canceling rival NFL projects. This exclusive license prevents other rival video game developers from producing official NFL video games. The deal, reportedly worth $300 million and later extended to 2013, has been widely criticized. Some competitors, such as the &quot;&quot; series, have elected to continue, seeking to distinguish themselves through innovative gameplay while others, such as the &quot;NFL 2K&quot; series, have ceased production. In 2007, 2K Sports released &quot;All Pro Football 2K8&quot;, which used former NFL stars.

In 2020 2K gained the rights for &quot;non-simulation football game experiences&quot; from the NFL. The deal is said to not impact Madden which will remain the only &quot;simulation&quot; football game.

In 2020 the NFL extended its exclusive rights with EA which were due to expire in 2022, which changed to until 2026 for a reported $1.5 billion, with a provision for an additional year of exclusivity if EA hits revenue targets.

==== &quot;Head Coach&quot; series ====
In August 2006, EA Sports debuted &quot;NFL Head Coach&quot;, which utilized the &quot;Madden&quot; engine to create a football management simulation. The game was criticized as buggy and unrealistic. EA Tiburon rebuilt the game from the ground up, addressing flaws and creating a proprietary engine, over the course of three years. &quot;NFL Head Coach 09&quot; was released on August 12, 2008, bundled with the special edition of &quot;Madden NFL 09&quot; and as a standalone game on September 2, 2008.

====&quot;Madden NFL Social&quot;====
&quot;Madden NFL Social&quot; was an early version of &quot;Madden NFL Mobile&quot; for Facebook and iOS that was released November 1, 2012 and shut down September 2, 2013.

====&quot;Madden Arcade&quot;====
Released on November 24, 2009, the game is 5-on-5 and takes the best 10 players from each of the 32 NFL teams.

====&quot;Madden NFL Mobile &quot;====
&quot;Madden NFL Mobile&quot; was released on August 26, 2014, and is only the third Madden game on mobile devices. The game is very similar to the Madden Ultimate Team (MUT) game mode, and the game is currently on its 9th season.

====&quot;Madden NFL Football&quot;====
&quot;Madden NFL Football&quot; was released as a launch title for the Nintendo 3DS on March 27, 2011.

===Voice commentary===
Voice commentary in &quot;Madden&quot; allows players or watchers to hear the game being called as if it were a real game on TV. For early versions of the game, this commentary was performed by Madden himself and his play-by-play partner. Initially, this was Pat Summerall, his partner during their days at CBS and Fox from the early 1980s to the early 2000s until Summerall retired; the role was then filled by Al Michaels, John&#x27;s broadcast partner on &quot;Monday Night Football&quot; (2002–2005) and &quot;NBC Sunday Night Football&quot; (2006–2008). For the first Madden games on the Xbox 360 and PS3, they featured a generic EA Sports radio announcer doing play-by-play. This started with &quot;Madden 06&quot; and ended with &quot;Madden 08&quot;. Other versions of those games still featured Madden&#x27;s commentary.

Madden recorded thousands of lines for each &quot;Madden&quot; game. &quot;Madden NFL 09&quot; was the last version to feature Madden&#x27;s commentary, albeit in a reduced role. By that time, he felt that reciting a script covering every single scenario in the game was boring and tedious—Madden recalled the long hours spent alone in the recording studio as &quot;the most difficult part of any part that I&#x27;ve ever had in the game and the least amount of fun&quot;—but said that in the decision to remove him from game commentary, &quot;I feel that something is being taken away from me&quot;.

Madden and Michaels were replaced by Cris Collinsworth as color commentator and Tom Hammond on play-by-play in &quot;Madden NFL 09&quot; and &quot;Madden NFL 10&quot;. Gus Johnson replaced Hammond in &quot;Madden NFL 11&quot; and &quot;Madden NFL 12&quot;, with Collinsworth handling color commentary in both games. &quot;Madden NFL 13&quot; marked the debut of real-life announcing team Jim Nantz and Phil Simms, including them appearing in an in-booth cutscene before the game. Nantz and Simms stayed until &quot;Madden NFL 16&quot;, when they were replaced by Fox&#x27;s Brandon Gaudin and Charles Davis for &quot;Madden NFL 17&quot;. Nantz continued to work as the primary play-by-play announcer for CBS, while Simms later left the CBS broadcast booth to work on &quot;The NFL Today&quot;. Gaudin and Davis returned to the studio throughout the 2016 NFL season to add new commentary relevant to each week of the season.

New commentary teams were added to &quot;Madden NFL 25&quot;. In addition to Gaudin and Davis, NBC&#x27;s Mike Tirico and Fox&#x27;s #2 analyst Greg Olsen formed one new broadcast team, while Kate Scott, the voice of the Philadelphia 76ers and Seattle Seahawks preseason games, and Fox&#x27;s #2 college football analyst Brock Huard formed another team.

In addition, &quot;Madden NFL 08&quot; and &quot;Madden NFL 09&quot; were also released in Spanish, featuring ESPN Deportes announcer Álvaro Martín providing both play-by-play and analysis.

==Reception and legacy==
 Electronic Arts has sold more than 100 million copies of &quot;Madden NFL&quot;, and more than five million in one year, for more than $4 billion in total sales. At EA Tiburon in Orlando, Florida a team of 30 developers and more than 100 game testers works on each new game in the series, which contains more than 10 million lines of source code.

Madden, once better known for Ace Hardware commercials than football despite winning Super Bowl XI as the head coach for the Oakland Raiders, is now better known for &quot;Madden NFL&quot; than as coach or broadcaster. He received an estimated $2 to 3 million each year for his endorsement but describes himself as &quot;never a good player&quot; of &quot;Madden&quot; and prefers to watch others play. Although Madden says that &quot;a computer is a helluva lot smarter than me&quot; he has influenced the series&#x27; design from the first game, and since retiring from broadcasting and doing video-game voice commentary in 2009 his participation in each &quot;Madden&quot;&#x27;s development has increased:

EA estimates that the series has five to seven million dedicated fans, and an underground circuit of &quot;Madden&quot; cash tournaments exists. Marshall Faulk in 2010 estimated that &quot;50 percent on up&quot; of NFL players are &quot;Madden&quot; players, who play in the league with or against childhood heroes they once chose to play as in the game. Players typically play as themselves regardless of their electronic counterparts&#x27; abilities and immediately check new releases of the game for changes in the more than 60 ratings of their talent. They often complain to Madden and EA about allegedly inaccurate ratings (only Emmitt Smith has told him that the game rated him too high), or ask for changes in their in-game appearance. Such complaints began as early as 1990, confusing the broadcaster, who did not contribute the player statistics for that year&#x27;s version due to lack of time.

Coaches and players at all levels of the sport such as K. J. Wright and Joe Brady say that &quot;Madden&quot; has influenced them and recommend the game to learn football strategy and tactics, practice plays and assignments, and simulate opponents. Teddy Bridgewater, who has used &quot;Madden&quot; to practice plays since college at Louisville, created Brady&#x27;s playbook in the game to help his backups P. J. Walker and Will Grier. Young players who grew up with &quot;Madden&quot; reportedly understand plays better than those who did not. &quot;Wired&quot; in 2010 wrote that the growing use of rookie quarterbacks and the spread offense was influenced by the game, stating that &quot;the sport is being taken over by something you might call Maddenball — a sophisticated, high-scoring, pass-happy, youth-driven phenomenon&quot;. When the Denver Broncos&#x27; Brandon Stokley in 2009 burned six seconds of the clock with an unusual run before scoring the winning touchdown against the Cincinnati Bengals, &quot;Madden&quot; designers—who were watching the game with Madden—immediately recognized his action as &quot;what happens in the game!&quot;

Football broadcasts on television use &quot;Madden&quot;-like visual cues to more closely resemble it, and the NFL considers the series its &quot;33rd franchise&quot; because each week during the season EA Sports receives the same searchable film database of every play that each of the league&#x27;s 32 teams do. The game is the NFL&#x27;s second-largest source of licensing revenue, after apparel, and an important part of the league&#x27;s recruitment of children as new football fans

The Pro Football Hall of Fame in 2003 opened an interactive exhibit in which visitors play &quot;Madden&quot;, three years before its namesake&#x27;s induction. Museum of the Moving Image in New York City in early 2014 celebrated &quot;Madden NFL&quot;″s 25th anniversary, with an exhibit including five playable versions of the game.

In a similar approach used by the automobile industry, until &quot;Madden NFL 25&quot;, the &quot;Madden&quot; series has always historically been numbered one year later than the year in which it is released. However, the season it represents is the year in which the game is released (thus, &quot;Madden NFL 13&quot; was actually released in 2012 and is modeled after the 2012 NFL season).

In 1996, &quot;Next Generation&quot; listed the Genesis installments of the series collectively as number 30 on their &quot;Top 100 Games of All Time&quot;, calling them &quot;One of the best two-player games of all time, the game that reinvented EA, and, (along with &quot;Sonic the Hedgehog&quot;), the game that launched Sega&#x27;s 16-bit assault on Nintendo.&quot;

During the mid-1990s, the series came under increasing criticism for its exploitable AI in single-player mode, as certain plays would consistently trounce AI-controlled teams, and came to be regarded as primarily a multiplayer experience.

===Incidents===
On August 26, 2018, a mass shooting occurred at an esports tournament in Jacksonville, Florida, that was a qualification event for the &quot;Madden NFL&quot; Championship Series, playing &quot;Madden NFL 19&quot;. The incident was live-streamed on Twitch, and shots can be heard in the streaming coverage. 3 people, including the suspect were killed and at least 11 people were injured. One victim was not hurt by gunfire.

=== Criticism ===
Since &quot;Madden NFL 06&quot; on the seventh generation of consoles, Electronic Arts has received criticism for not evolving the Madden games for next generation consoles, while graphics have certainly improved, certain popular features from older games in the series have been removed for unknown reasons, then some come back in newer iterations slightly altered and advertised as a new feature. Many glitches and poor balancing of the meta have been seen in the games and some gamers and reviewers think there has been little to no improvement with recent iterations of &quot;Madden&quot;. The most notable bugs affecting the community have been extensive issues with franchise mode, commentary hiccups, gameplay/physics issues, and disconnection/loss of progress problems. Some reviews of recent &quot;Madden&quot; games have criticized the series for not evolving and not making changes to the series and saying older iterations of the series are better games. EA has also received criticism for not improving Franchise Mode, which was one of its flagship modes and instead only focusing on Ultimate Team, its team-building card game mode introduced in &quot;Madden NFL 10&quot; which gradually started to get monetized throughout the 2010s. The trailer release for &quot;Madden NFL 21&quot; on June 17, 2020, was widely panned by gamers and reviewers as seen in its like-to-dislike ratio and its user review score on&quot; Metacritic&quot; are at an all-time low, sitting at 0.2 as of January 2021.

==Curse==
Prior to 1998, every annual installment of the &quot;Madden NFL&quot; series primarily featured Madden on its cover. In 1998, Electronic Arts selected Garrison Hearst to appear on the PAL version&#x27;s cover, although Madden remained on the North American release. Beginning with Eddie George in 2000, the series has usually featured one of the league&#x27;s top players on every annual installment, despite Madden&#x27;s opposition. While appearing on the cover has become an honor akin to appearing on the Wheaties box, much like the &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; Cover Jinx, certain players who appeared on &quot;Madden&quot; video game box art have experienced a decline in performance or an injury. This run of misfortune for &quot;Madden&quot; cover athletes has been dubbed the &quot;&quot;Madden&quot; curse&quot;.

When asked about the Madden Curse, EA Sports&#x27; Chris Erb said, &quot;I don&#x27;t know that we believe in the curse. The players don&#x27;t believe in the curse.&quot; Running back Shaun Alexander, who was featured on the cover of &quot;Madden NFL 07&quot;, commented, &quot;Do you want to be hurt and on the cover, or just hurt?&quot; and &quot;Madden NFL 08&quot; cover athlete Vince Young expressed skepticism, while &quot;Madden NFL 12&quot; cover athlete Peyton Hillis attributed his subpar season that year to the curse.

The perception that the curse is real has resulted in fans lobbying for their favorite players not to be on the cover, such as fans of LaDainian Tomlinson who were strongly opposed to EA Sports&#x27; initial decision to feature him on the cover of &quot;Madden NFL 08&quot;, so much that a fan created &quot;SaveLTfromMadden.com&quot; to voice their disdain. Tomlinson declined the offer, but later said it was solely due to contract negotiations. Starting with &quot;Madden NFL 11&quot; EA has allowed fans to choose their favorite player for the cover. However, EA believes that many fans vote against their favorite player to avoid the &quot;curse&quot;. It has become so prominent that bookmakers create odds on how likely an injury will occur to the player appearing on the cover.

The injuries that &quot;Madden&quot; cover athletes experience can be attributed to the physical nature of football. Critics of the curse also note that several players had successful seasons when they appeared on the cover, such as &quot;Madden NFL 13&quot;″s Calvin Johnson, who set the single-season record for receiving yards, &quot;Madden NFL 18&quot;″s Tom Brady, who was named MVP, and &quot;Madden NFL 20&quot;″s Patrick Mahomes, who not only won Super Bowl LIV, but was also the game&#x27;s MVP, thus breaking the Madden Curse.

In December 2010, EA announced plans to develop a comedy film based on the Madden curse. However, EA Entertainment executive Pat O&#x27;Brien stated in October 2014 that EA is not working on a Madden curse movie.

==Annual events==
===Madden Bowl===
The Madden Bowl is a single elimination tournament held on the most current edition of &quot;Madden NFL&quot;. It has been held since 1995 during Super Bowl weekend in the host city and, in the past, participation included NFL players and celebrities. The Madden Bowl&#x27;s participation has changed over the years from being an event held with athletes, musicians, and celebrities, to become an event where only NFL players who are invited to participate get a chance to play. Participants in the Madden Bowl are free to choose whichever team they like. Winners receive a Madden Bowl trophy and recognition in the upcoming &quot;Madden&quot; video game.

The 2006 Madden Bowl, held during the weekend of Super Bowl XL in Detroit, was televised on ESPN and premiered in April 2006. Concurrently, ESPN also hosted a separate series of competitions called &quot;Madden Nation&quot;, which was a reality television show that chronicled a cross-country trip to crown the best Madden player in the United States and aired from 2005 to 2008.

From 2011 to 2012, the Madden Bowl competition utilizes the new Online Team Play feature included in &quot;Madden NFL 11&quot;. Rather than competing as individuals, players form groups of three to square-off for the trophy. After this feature was discontinued, the Madden Bowl competition continued in a Head-to-Head format.

===EA Super Bowl simulation===
Since 2004, EA Sports has run a simulation of the Super Bowl using the latest game in the &quot;Madden NFL&quot; series and announced the result. The game simulations conducted by EA have correctly predicted 13 of the last 22 Super Bowl winners. The company accurately predicted the final score for the 2015 game and other details, including a score of 24–14 in favor of Seattle in the third quarter, despite skepticism within EA that Seattle would lose after a double-digit lead. The predictions were incorrect in 2008, 2011, 2014, 2016, 2018, 2019, 2021, 2022, and 2023. The latter three was the first time that the predictions were inaccurate for three consecutive years. EA also releases a computer-generated description of the simulated game as if it were a summary of the real Super Bowl. The results of the simulated and actual Super Bowl games are listed below.

<text>Microhistory is a genre of history that focuses on small units of research, such as an event, community, individual or a settlement. In its ambition, however, microhistory can be distinguished from a simple case study insofar as microhistory aspires to &quot;[ask] large questions in small places&quot;, according to the definition given by Charles Joyner. It is closely associated with social and cultural history.

== Origins ==
Microhistory became popular in Italy in the 1970s. According to Giovanni Levi, one of the pioneers of the approach, it began as a reaction to a perceived crisis in existing historiographical approaches. Carlo Ginzburg, another of microhistory&#x27;s founders, has written that he first heard the term used around 1977, and soon afterwards began to work with Levi and Simona Cerutti on &quot;Microstorie&quot;, a series of microhistorical works.

The word &quot;microhistory&quot; dates back to 1959, when the American historian George R. Stewart published &quot;Pickett&#x27;s Charge: A Microhistory of the Final Attack on Gettysburg, July 3, 1863&quot;, which tells the story of the final day of the Battle of Gettysburg. Another early use was by the Annales historian Fernand Braudel, for whom the concept had negative connotations, being overly concerned with the history of events. A third early use of the term was in the title of Luis González&#x27;s 1968 work . González distinguished between microhistory, for him synonymous with local history, and &quot;&quot;, which is primarily concerned with anecdotes.

== Approach ==
The most distinctive aspect of the microhistorical approach is the small scale of investigations. Microhistorians focus on small units in society, as a reaction to the generalisations made by the social sciences which do not necessarily hold up when tested against these smaller units.
For instance, Ginzburg&#x27;s 1976 work &quot;The Cheese and the Worms&quot; – &quot;probably the most popular and widely read work of microhistory&quot; – investigates the life of a single sixteenth-century Italian miller, Menocchio. The individuals microhistorical works are concerned with are frequently those whom Richard M. Tristano describes as &quot;little people&quot;, especially those considered heretics.

Carlo Ginzburg has written that a core principle of microhistory is making obstacles in sources, such as lacunae, part of the historical account. Relatedly, Levi has said that the point of view of the researcher becomes part of the account in microhistory. Other notable aspects of microhistory as a historical approach are an interest in the interaction of elite and popular culture, and an interest in the interaction between micro- and macro-levels of history.

Since the 2010s, historical research has expanded to include the field of “global microhistory,” which seeks to combine the detailed focus of microhistorical studies with broader transregional or global perspectives.

==Appointments and staff==
The House of Commons of Canada appoints the chief electoral officer to head the agency. The chief electoral officer also appoints the commissioner of Canada elections (), who ensures that the &quot;Canada Elections Act&quot; is enforced. The broadcasting arbitrator (), who allocates paid and free broadcasting time during electoral events, is appointed by a unanimous decision of registered political parties in the House of Commons, or by the chief electoral officer if the parties fail to agree a candidate. The chief electoral officer is seconded by the deputy chief electoral officer, chief legal counsel and around 500 to 600 staff, mainly situated in the National Capital Region. During a general election or referendum, this rises to 235,000 workers

==Compliance, enforcement and regulation==

The Commissioner of Canada Elections is responsible for regulating federal electoral events and enforcing compliance with the &quot;Canada Elections Act&quot;.

Before 2018, the commissioner was appointed in consultation with the director of public prosecutions and was overseen by the director, but has since become part of the Office of the Chief Electoral Officer.

<doc id="368128" wikidata="Q2019221" url="?curid=368128" title="Yahya Ayyash">
<text>Yahya Abd-al-Latif Ayyash (, ; 6 March 1966 – 5 January 1996) was the chief bombmaker of Hamas and the leader of the West Bank battalion of the Izz ad-Din al-Qassam Brigades. In that capacity, he earned the nickname &quot;the Engineer&quot; (). Ayyash is credited with advancing the technique of suicide bombings against Israel by Palestinian militant groups. The bombings he orchestrated killed approximately 90 Israelis, many of them civilians. He was assassinated by the Shin Bet on January 5, 1996, through a booby-trapped mobile phone.

Ayyash is celebrated by local Palestinian communities who have named streets and other locales in his honor. His name was also given to the rocket Ayyash-250 produced by Hamas.

==Early life==
Ayyash was born in Rafat on 6 March 1966, the eldest of three brothers. As a child, he received an award from the Islamic Trust for his talent in memorizing the Quran.

As a boy, Ayyash&#x27;s hobby was repairing radios and television sets. After graduating from high school in 1985, he entered Birzeit University in 1987. He received a Bachelor of Science degree in electrical engineering in 1991.

Described as &quot;well educated, ambitious, and soft-spoken,&quot; Ayyash hailed from a relatively affluent family. He was married with one child. He planned to study for a master&#x27;s degree in Jordan, but soon after being denied a student visa, he joined Hamas.

==Work for Hamas==
Ayyash built the bombs used in a number of Hamas suicide attacks: the Mehola Junction bombing, the Afula Bus massacre, the Hadera central station massacre, the Tel Aviv bus 5 massacre, the Egged bus 36 bombing, the Ramat Gan bus 20 bombing, and the Jerusalem bus 26 bombing. As part of a strategic alliance between Hamas and Palestinian Islamic Jihad, Ayyash built the bombs used by Islamic Jihad at the Beit Lid massacre.

Unable to obtain TNT and other high explosives in the Palestinian territories, Ayyash used readily available household products such as a combination of acetone and detergent. When combined, these substances form acetone peroxide, an explosive known as &quot;Mother of Satan&quot; for its instability.

Ayyash came to the attention of Israeli security forces after a failed bombing attempt in Ramat Ef&#x27;al. Following a high-speed chase, three would-be Hamas suicide bombers were arrested by police. When police inspected their car, they found it rigged with a bomb—five gasoline tanks filled to capacity, connected to an acetone peroxide-based detonator. After evacuating the area, sappers used a robot armed with a shotgun to shoot the detonator in the hopes of defusing it but it blew up, causing a massive explosion. Police investigators said that if this had happened in a crowded area, hundreds would have been killed. Under interrogation, the three bombers revealed Ayyash&#x27;s identity.

==Assassination==
After the assassination of Yitzhak Rabin, the Palestinian Authority began to cooperate more closely with the Shin Bet. The Shin Bet learned that Ayyash often spent the night in the Gaza City home of Osama Hamad, a childhood friend whose uncle, Kamil Hamad, was known to the authorities.

In October 1995, Kamil Hamad met with Shin Bet operatives, demanding money and Israeli identity cards for himself and his wives. After they threatened to inform on him, he agreed to cooperate. Shin Bet agents gave him a cell phone and told him it was bugged so they could listen in on his conversations. They did not tell him that it also contained 15 grams of RDX explosive. Hamad gave the phone to his nephew Osama, knowing that Ayyash regularly used Osama&#x27;s phones.

At 08:00 on 5 January 1996, Ayyash&#x27;s father called him and Ayyash answered. Overhead, an Israeli plane picked up their conversation and relayed it to an Israeli command post. When it was confirmed that it was Ayyash on the phone, Shin Bet remotely detonated it, killing him instantly. He was in Beit Lahia at the time.

Israel did not confirm or deny its role in killing Ayyash, which led to rumors and speculation about the extent of Israeli involvement.
In 2012, former Shin Bet director Carmi Gillon confirmed the story in the documentary &quot;The Gatekeepers&quot;. Kamil Hamad disappeared and it is rumored that he received US$1 million, a fake passport and a visa to the US.

===Aftermath===
Following Ayyash&#x27;s death, four suicide bombings killed seventy-eight Israelis in February and March 1996. The first of these took place shortly after the end of the 40-day mourning period for Ayyash and the cell that claimed responsibility called itself &quot;Disciples of the martyr Yahya &#x27;Ayyash&quot;, stating it was a revenge attack for his assassination. Israeli security services who later interrogated one of the organizers of the attacks said they were carried out by a sub-group of the Qassam Brigades, and that, &quot;the attacks were most probably a direct reaction to the assassination of &#x27;Ayyash [with] no far-reaching political goal.&quot;

==Legacy==
&quot;The Militant&quot;, a newsweekly associated with the Socialist Workers Party (United States), reported that &quot;100,000 Palestinians... attended the funeral&quot;. Yasser Arafat, president of the Palestinian National Authority (PA), offered his condolences to Hamas leaders. In a speech soon after the death, Arafat praised Ayyash as a martyr and blamed Israel for his assassination.

In April 2010, Israel&#x27;s Channel 10 reported that the Palestinian Authority named a street in Ramallah after Ayyash. The future presidential compound of the PA is being built on the street. Only a few weeks earlier, a square in Ramallah was named after the Palestinian militant Dalal Mughrabi who directed the 1978 Coastal Road massacre. PA sources said the PA did not intend to name the street after Ayyash. The Ramallah Municipality stated that the street name had been chosen at the end of the 1990s shortly after Ayyash&#x27;s death.

In response, Israel, the United States and Canada condemned the Palestinian Authority. The Israeli Prime Minister&#x27;s Office called it an &quot;outrageous glorification of terrorism by the Palestinian Authority&quot; while a U.S. State Department spokesperson stated &quot;we also strongly condemn the glorification of terrorists. Honoring terrorists who have murdered innocent civilians either by official statements or by the dedication of public places hurts peace efforts and must end.&quot;

The PA had previously named streets in Jenin and Beit Lahia as well as square in Jericho in honor of Ayyash.

<doc id="368130" wikidata="Q3037176" url="?curid=368130" title="Dorothy Loudon">
<text>Dorothy Loudon (September 17, 1925 – November 15, 2003) was an American actress and singer. She won the Tony Award for Best Lead Actress in a Musical in 1977 for her performance as Miss Hannigan in &quot;Annie&quot;. Loudon was also nominated for Tony Awards for her lead performances in the musicals &quot;The Fig Leaves Are Falling&quot; and &quot;Ballroom&quot;, as well as a Golden Globe award for her appearances on &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot;.

==Early life and career==
Loudon was born in Boston, Massachusetts in 1925 (she later shaved eight years off her age), to James Edwin Loudon and Dorothy Helen Loudon (née Shaw). She was raised in Claremont, New Hampshire, and Indianapolis, Indiana. She attended Syracuse University on a drama scholarship but did not graduate, and moved to New York City to study at the American Academy of Dramatic Arts. She began singing in night clubs, one such being New York&#x27;s Blue Angel, mingling song with ad-libbed comedy patter, and was featured on television on &quot;The Perry Como Show&quot; and &quot;The Ed Sullivan Show&quot;.

Loudon made her stage debut in 1962 in &quot;The World of Jules Feiffer&quot;, a play with incidental music by Stephen Sondheim, under the direction of Mike Nichols. That same year she made her Broadway debut in &quot;Nowhere to Go but Up&quot;, which ran only two weeks but earned her good reviews and the Theatre World Award. In 1969, &quot;The Fig Leaves Are Falling&quot; ran for only four performances, although it won her the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Performance and a nomination for the Tony Award for Best Lead Actress in a Musical. She followed this with a revival of &quot;Three Men on a Horse&quot; directed by George Abbott; &quot;Lolita, My Love&quot;, which closed out-of-town during its pre-Broadway tryout; and a revival of the Clare Boothe Luce comedy &quot;The Women&quot;.

==Broadway==
Loudon&#x27;s performance as the evil orphanage administrator Miss Hannigan in &quot;Annie&quot; won her the Tony Award and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Featured Actress in a Musical in 1977. In the show she introduced the seminal showtunes &quot;Little Girls&quot; and &quot;Easy Street.&quot; Of her portrayal, Clive Barnes wrote, &quot;As the wicked Miss Hannigan, Dorothy Loudon, eyes bulging with envy, face sagging with hatred, is deliciously and deliriously horrid. She never puts a sneer, a leer, or even a scream in the wrong place, and her singing has just the right brassy bounce to it.&quot; Loudon later revisited the character of Miss Hannigan in the ill-fated 1990 sequel, &quot;Annie 2: Miss Hannigan&#x27;s Revenge&quot;, which closed quickly after a dismal pre-Broadway engagement in Washington D.C.

In 1979, Michael Bennett cast Loudon as Bea Asher, a widow who becomes romantically involved with a mail carrier she meets at the local dance hall, in &quot;Ballroom&quot;. She was nominated for the Tony Award for Best Leading Actress in a Musical and the Drama Desk Award for Outstanding Actress in a Musical. She performed the number &quot;Fifty Percent&quot; from the musical during that year&#x27;s Tony Awards ceremony. During her rendition of George Gershwin&#x27;s &quot;Vodka&quot; at the 1983 Tony Awards ceremony while resplendent in a blue sequined gown, she ad-libbed &quot;I&#x27;m too good for this room. I&#x27;m too good for this song...but I&#x27;m not too good for this dress!&quot; At the 38th Annual Tony Awards ceremony in 1984, Loudon performed &quot;Broadway Baby&quot; from &quot;Follies&quot;. In &quot;The New York Times&quot;, John O&#x27;Connor said of her performance, &quot;Miss Loudon has developed the art of mugging into something of a hyperactive disease.&quot;

In 1980, Loudon succeeded Angela Lansbury as Mrs. Lovett in Stephen Sondheim&#x27;s &quot;Sweeney Todd&quot;. In reviewing her performance for &quot;The Christian Science Monitor&quot;, David Sterritt said, &quot;Her body sways like a reed in the emotional storms of her own scatter-brained creation, and her off-hand manner becomes still more off-handed when the most explosive matters are at stake ... Loudon gives a comic characterization in the most classical tradition.&quot; The following year she co-starred with Katharine Hepburn and Julia Barr in the play &quot;The West Side Waltz&quot;. In 1982 she won the Sarah Siddons Award for her work in Chicago theatre. She appeared in the 1983 Jerry Herman revue &quot;Jerry&#x27;s Girls&quot; and later the same year she played the role of the miserable middle-aged actress Dotty Otley on Broadway in Michael Frayn&#x27;s farce &quot;Noises Off&quot;.

She was cast as Carlotta Vance in the Lincoln Center Theater production of &quot;Dinner at Eight&quot; but was replaced by Marian Seldes in November 2002 when Loudon left the play because of illness.

==Television and film==
Loudon was chosen as the replacement for Carol Burnett when Burnett left &quot;The Garry Moore Show&quot; in 1962. Although that collaboration was not altogether successful, the excellent reviews she received the same year for her Broadway debut in &quot;Nowhere to Go but Up&quot; proved prophetic. Coincidentally, the two roles Loudon later played so successfully on Broadway stage —Miss Hannigan and Dotty Otley — were both played by Burnett onscreen. She also was a frequent guest star on many New York based comedy and game shows. In 1979, Loudon starred in the television series &quot;Dorothy&quot;, in which she portrayed a former showgirl teaching music and drama at a boarding school for girls. It lasted only one season. She appeared in only two films, playing a photography agent in &quot;Garbo Talks&quot; (1984) and as Southern eccentric Serena Dawes in &quot;Midnight in the Garden of Good and Evil&quot; (1997). 

==Personal life==

Loudon was married to composer Norman Paris from 1971 to his death. Together they had no children and Loudon never remarried. She died in Manhattan, age 78, from cancer on November 15, 2003. Loudon was interred in Kensico Cemetery in Westchester County, New York. She left no immediate survivors except for two step-children from her marriage to Paris.

<text>The Washington Missourian is the Franklin County newspaper based in Washington, Missouri. The paper is owned by Missourian Publishing Company, a family-owned company. James L. Miller, Sr. purchased the paper in 1937. In addition to news stories in Washington, the paper covers the nearby cities of Union, St. Clair, and Pacific, as well as local stories from the surrounding areas. It is the most read local paper inside Franklin County and is available and read in many St. Louis County cities, such as Eureka. The paper contains obituaries from as far back as 1939.

== History ==
The &quot;Washington Missourian&quot; started in 1860 as the &quot;Franklin County-Gazette&quot; and received its name change in 1926. The Miller Family has owned the company since purchasing it in 1937 and delivers the newspaper bi-weekly. The combined circulation of the local newspaper is over 26,000, and the &quot;Missourian&quot; employs 135 part and full-time workers. John, Thomas, and William Miller own the Missourian Publishing Co., which prints the newspaper. William, the editor since 1957, has been at the helm for more than 40 years. The &quot;Washington Missourian&quot; has won awards, including first place awards in National Newspaper Association contests, the 1994 Missouri Gold cup award, and a General Excellence Award.

July 2012 was the 75th anniversary of ownership of the &quot;Washington Missourian&quot; by members of the James L. Miller Sr. family. &quot;The Missourian&quot; dates back to 1860. It began as the &quot;Franklin County Gazette&quot; on January 5, 1860. In April 1861, the name was changed to the &quot;Franklin County News&quot;. In April 1867, it became the &quot;Franklin County Observer&quot;. That name lasted until August 1926 when it was changed to the &quot;Washington Missourian&quot;.

== Sections ==
The &quot;Missourian&quot; features various sections such as Local News, Regional News, Sports, Opinion, Features, Obituaries, eMarket, Classifieds, and Business.

For their sports section, along with national and regional stories, the &quot;Washington Missourian&quot; picks a high school male and female athlete of the week(s) to feature both online and in their print newspapers.

== The Miller Family ==
Son Bill Sr. joined the newspaper full time in November 1953 when he returned from military duty with the Army in Korea. Before that, he had graduated from the University of Missouri with a degree in history and a minor in political science. He began as a sports editor, then became a news editor. Tom Miller joined the company in the late 1950s after college and after serving in the Army in Korea. He began in the circulation and classified ad department, then sold display ads before becoming the advertising director.

John E. Miller, another son of James L. Sr., came to the company in 1961 after college and after working at a paper company in St. Louis. He also served in the Army Reserve. He later became the commercial printing manager. Jim Miller Jr. joined &quot;The Missourian&quot; in the 1960s as the photo editor. After college and military service in Korea, he worked in classified advertising for the &quot;Kansas City Star&quot; and &quot;Times&quot;. He left the &quot;Star&quot; to sell advertising for a radio station, then for a television station. He also sold television advertising in Dallas, Texas, Buffalo, N.Y., and Indianapolis, Ind. During those years, he also worked as a freelance photographer. Jim, Jr., died in 1987.

Jim Jr.&#x27;s son, Bill Miller Sr., ran the newspaper until June 10, 2020, when he stepped down after facing backlash for publishing a racially insensitive political cartoon by Tom Stiglich. His daughters, Susan Miller Warden and Jeanne Miller Wood had resigned as owners of the company in protest earlier that day.

<doc id="368150" wikidata="Q1703254" url="?curid=368150" title="Uplink (video game)">
<text>Uplink (also known in North America as Uplink: Hacker Elite) is a simulation video game released in 2001 by the British company Introversion Software. The player takes charge of a freelance computer hacker in a fictional futuristic 2010, and must break into foreign computers, complete contracts and purchase new hardware to hack into increasingly harder computer systems.

The game, which was Introversion&#x27;s first release, was generally well received in Europe, and was released in North America by the publisher Strategy First as &quot;Uplink: Hacker Elite&quot; in 2003. &quot;Uplink&quot; was later ported to Android and iOS systems in 2012.

== Plot ==

In the game, the player assumes the role of a hacker in the year 2010, who begins work for the Uplink Corporation, a worldwide company providing work for hackers. The player amasses money, software, gateway hardware and skill in the course of performing jobs for various clients, and hacking servers of global corporations for profit.

The storyline of the game typically begins with the player receiving a delayed e-mail from a deceased top ranking Uplink agent concerning the research done by a faction within the Andromeda Research Corporation (ARC), described as an &quot;anti-capitalist, techno-anarchist&quot; group. The agent was contracted to aid in engineering a destructive computer virus known as &quot;Revelation&quot; in an attempt to destroy the Internet. A rival company, Arunmor, attempts to counter ARC&#x27;s plans by developing &quot;Faith&quot;, a counter virus that can purge &quot;Revelation&quot;.

The player can choose to side with ARC or Arunmor or even ignore the plot in its entirety, concentrating on freelance hacking, in which case the storyline plays out without the player&#x27;s participation with Arunmor untimely stopping &quot;Revelation,&quot; though not before some in-game servers and computer systems are infected and destroyed by the virus.

During the missions Andromeda contracts a hacker to steal files from &quot;The Darwin Project,&quot; digital lifeforms that exist and reproduce on the internet. The sophisticated artificial intelligence technology is used to improve &quot;Revelation,&quot; helping it spread quickly and autonomously. Numerous attacks on ARC and Arunmor systems also occur in the storyline, including a mission leading the chief technical director of Arunmor being framed for bank fraud. The government is also helping fund Arunmor&#x27;s &quot;Faith&quot; project, and is closely monitoring ARC, though they lack concrete evidence to warrant raiding the site or arresting any employees.

Regardless of the player&#x27;s choices, &quot;Revelation&quot; will eventually be completed and unleashed upon the world, thus beginning the endgame. If the player has supported Arunmor, they are tasked with running a counter-operation, hacking into infected systems and using &quot;Faith&quot; to restore them before they are destroyed. &quot;Revelation&quot; is wiped out completely, and the damning evidence against Andromeda leads to a federal raid and the subsequent arrest of suspected staff members in the company, along with a number of Uplink agents. The leader of Andromeda then issues a statement, making no apologies for releasing &quot;Revelation;&quot; he argues that the internet has become a mere extension of Western capitalism to serve the interest of elites, rather than the bastion of free speech and anonymity it once was. He claims that people will never be safe on the web – their entire lives are on file and anyone can tamper with their personal information at will. The leader denounces Arunmor, claiming they are simply profiteering off the crisis and are a yet another symptom of capitalist overreach. He is sentenced to 8 years in prison, and ARC shuts down operations.

In contrast, if the player supports Andromeda, the group instructs them to unleash &quot;Revelation&quot; on the world, infecting as many systems as they can to overwhelm &quot;Faith&quot; and render every computer in the world inoperable. If the player is successful, the virus claims their own Uplink gateway, ending the game immediately and implying Andromeda have succeeded in their goal. If the player fails to cause enough infections within fifteen minutes, federal agents seize their equipment and arrest them, dooming the &quot;Revelation&quot; project to a premature end.

== Style ==
&quot;Uplink&quot; focuses on emulating highly stylized, Hollywood-esque hacking, as seen in movies such as &quot;Hackers&quot;, &quot;Sneakers&quot;, &quot;WarGames&quot; and &quot;Swordfish&quot;. References to these movies can be found throughout the game, including joke servers for companies such as Steve Jackson Games (which in 1990 was raided by the Secret Service) and a nuclear missile control system from &quot;WarGames&quot;. It also features at least three references to the movie &quot;Sneakers&quot;, including one which can be found in the first version of the game (and was later removed in an update released by Introversion) which is a cheat code in which the user has to enter &quot;TooManySecrets&quot; (an anagram to the phrase &quot;Setec Astronomy&quot;) as the username thus allowing them to access a cheat menu. Another reference to the anagram is the password &quot;MySocratesNote&quot;, sent to the player in an e-mail which starts the plotline. In addition, the voice print sections use the phrase &quot;Hello. I am the system administrator. My voice is my passport. Verify me.&quot; which is similar to the one Sneakers used.

 Most of the &#x27;hacking&#x27; is of the form: &quot;there is a security system of type X, level Y that is stopping me from accessing or changing something I need to access or change, so I need to have an anti-X program of level Y+&quot;. There is some need for rapid selection of programs to run, but there is no actual difficulty in running them (provided that one can afford them).

The game has a certain number of unusual features, including an in-game IRC client and in earlier versions a multi-monitor feature requiring another copy of the game running on a second computer. The latter was removed in later versions due to lack of stability and popularity and, as it was called &quot;Network&quot;, was often confused with multiplayer gaming (that the game does not offer).

== Soundtrack ==
The game uses several songs originally made in S3M, mod and xm format. The original song files are included on the bonus CD-ROM of the game, a disc that was originally given as a free addition to those who referred the game to others. The disc also includes several songs which were not used in the final game.

== Release ==
&quot;Uplink&quot; was first released in October 2001, and was initially sold digitally and distributed by mail. The game was released for Microsoft Windows and Linux (2012) directly by Introversion, and ported to and released for Mac by Contraband and Ambrosia Software respectively. Chris Delay stated in an interview with &quot;PC Gamer UK&quot; that they did not pay for advertising of the game at all — it became known purely by word of mouth. A version released in the US was published and distributed by Strategy First under the title &quot;Uplink: Hacker Elite&quot;. Legal proceedings were undertaken when Strategy First filed for bankruptcy and ceased paying Introversion royalties, but the &quot;Hacker Elite&quot; version remains available from various sources. The game is now also available via Valve&#x27;s Steam online distribution service, via GOG.com, as well as via the Ubuntu Software Center. Uplink was also released for iOS on 7 June 2012. An Android version debuted as part of The Humble Bundle for Android 3, on 15 August 2012.

== &quot;Hacker Elite&quot; royalties ==
A version released in the US was published and distributed by Strategy First under the title &quot;Uplink: Hacker Elite&quot;. Strategy First ran into financial difficulties, and ceased paying royalties to Introversion shortly before filing for bankruptcy protection, but continued to sell the game in competition with Introversion.

On 20 January 2006, Introversion announced they were taking legal action against all retailers of &quot;Uplink: Hacker Elite&quot;, except Stardock. It transpired that, while filing for bankruptcy would have caused a breach of contract, Strategy First persuaded Canadian courts to grant a moratorium preventing termination of the contract. Strategy First has resumed paying limited royalties.

Stores and services currently reselling &quot;Hacker Elite&quot; in North America include:
* Direct2Drive, IGN&#x27;s digital distribution service (as of July 2006).
* Strategy First&#x27;s online store.
As some versions of &quot;Uplink: Hacker Elite&quot; have been modified, many game mods and patches will not run with the &quot;Hacker Elite&quot; version.

==Reception==
The iOS and PC versions received &quot;generally favorable reviews&quot; according to the review aggregation website Metacritic.

The editors of &quot;Computer Gaming World&quot; presented &quot;Uplink: Hacker Elite&quot; with their 2003 &quot;Adventure Game of the Year&quot; award. They summarized it as &quot;an immersive, original, and suspenseful little game.&quot;

<text>Ambrosia Software was a predominantly Macintosh software and gaming company founded in 1993 and located in Rochester, New York, U.S. Ambrosia Software was best known for its Macintosh remakes of older arcade games, which began with a 1992 version of Atari, Inc.&#x27;s &quot;Asteroids&quot; from 1979. The company also published utility software. Its products were distributed as shareware; demo versions could be downloaded and used for up to 30 days. Later the company released some products for iOS. Ambrosia&#x27;s best-selling program was the utility Snapz Pro X, according to a 2002 interview with company president Andrew Welch.

In 2017, customers reported on Ambrosia&#x27;s Facebook page that attempts to contact the company were unsuccessful and they were unable to make new purchases. As of July 2019, the website is offline. As of May 2021, the website resolves but leads to a domain parking page with ads unconnected to the company.

== History ==
The first game distributed under the Ambrosia Software name was &quot;Maelstrom&quot;, a 1992 remake of the 1979 &quot;Asteroids&quot; arcade video game. It uses raster graphics similar in style to Atari&#x27;s later &quot;Blasteroids&quot; (1987) and the Atari ST game &quot;Megaroids&quot; (1988). Despite the concept being 13 years old at the time of release, &quot;Maelstrom&quot; was popular at a time when Macintosh action games were in short supply, and it won some software awards.

&quot;Ambrosia Software&quot; was incorporated August 18, 1993, by Andrew Welch after he graduated from the Rochester Institute of Technology in 1992. &quot;Maelstrom&quot; was followed by more action games, including &quot;Apeiron&quot; (a remake of &quot;Centipede&quot;), &quot;Swoop&quot; (a clone of &quot;Galaxian&quot;), and &quot;Barrack&quot; (a clone of &quot;JezzBall&quot;). In 1999, Cameron Crotty of &quot;Macworld&quot; wrote that &quot;No other company has gotten so much mileage out of renovating mid-1980s arcade hits.&quot;

Nearly all of the company&#x27;s ten employees were laid off in 2013, but Welch denied rumors of the company closing. In late 2018, the company&#x27;s last remaining employee announced that Ambrosia was officially shutting down operations.

== Abandoned projects ==

In 1996, Ambrosia announced the development of a 3D horror-themed adventure game called &quot;Manse&quot; by Brian Barnes. It was demoed at Macworld Expo in 1998.

In 2014, Tod Baudais claimed to be continuing work on a cancelled Ambrosia project called&quot; Goo Moo&quot;, or &quot;Gooliens&quot;, a game about a green alien blob that must grow in size in order to abduct cows.

== Shareware policies ==
One of Ambrosia&#x27;s founding mantras was that shareware software should not be distributed as crippleware. The company&#x27;s software was released on the honor system with only a short reminder that you had used the unregistered software for &quot;x&quot; amount of time, creating what is commonly called nagware.

This policy was later changed and the company employed typical shareware piracy prevention measures, as well as more innovative ones such as used in the Escape Velocity line of games where the team&#x27;s mascot, Hector the Parrot (known in-game as Cap&#x27;n Hector), would use her heavily armed ship to ceaselessly attack players of unregistered copies after the trial period had expired. Their software products therefore began to fall under the category of crippleware. Although the company no longer provides new expiring license codes, Ambrosia&#x27;s founder Andrew Welch released Decoder Ring which allows anyone to generate new license codes.

Matt Slot has written about the factors that played into the policy change.

<text>Faith Renée Evans (born June 10, 1973) is an American R&amp;B singer, songwriter, and actress. Born in Lakeland, Florida and raised in New Jersey, she relocated to Los Angeles in 1991 in pursuit of a recording career. Evans initially performed as a backing vocalist for R&amp;B singers Al B. Sure! and Christopher Williams, and by the age of 20, signed with Puff Daddy&#x27;s Bad Boy Records as the label&#x27;s first female artist in 1994. Following her uncredited appearance on labelmate the Notorious B.I.G.&#x27;s single &quot;One More Chance&quot;, she released her debut studio album, &quot;Faith&quot; (1995), to critical acclaim and moderate commercial reception. Evans then guest performed alongside 112 on Puff Daddy’s 1997 single &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Missing You,&quot; which won Best Rap Performance at the 40th Annual Grammy Awards and became the first hip hop song to debut atop the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100. Her second and third albums, &quot;Keep the Faith&quot; (1998) and &quot;Faithfully&quot; (2001), peaked at numbers six and 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200, respectively, and saw further critical praise.

Evans parted ways with Bad Boy in favor of Capitol Records in 2003. Her fourth album, &quot;The First Lady&quot; (2005) peaked at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and topped the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, while her fifth album, &quot;A Faithful Christmas&quot; (2005)—a holiday album—failed to chart and served as her final release on a major label. After a hiatus, she released her sixth album, &quot;Something About Faith&quot; (2010) independently, followed by her seventh album, &quot;Incomparable&quot; (2014). With a career spanning two decades, Evans has sold over 20 million records worldwide.

Outside of recording, Evans is known as the widow of rapper Christopher &quot;the Notorious B.I.G.&quot; Wallace, whom she married on August 4, 1994, after meeting the rapper at a Bad Boy photoshoot. The turbulent marriage resulted in Evans&#x27; involvement in the East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry—which dominated much of hip hop music&#x27;s mainstream coverage at the time—and concluded with Wallace&#x27;s unsolved drive-by murder on March 9, 1997. Also an actress and author, Evans made her screen debut on the 2000 musical drama &quot;Turn It Up&quot; by Robert Adetuyi. Her 2008 autobiography, &quot;Keep the Faith: A Memoir&quot; was released by Grand Central Publishing and won a 2009 African American Literary Award for the Best Biography/Memoir category.

==Biography==

===1973–1994: Early life and career beginnings===
Evans was born on June 10, 1973, in Lakeland, Florida, to an African American mother, Helene Evans, a professional singer. Her father, Richard Swain, was a musician of English and possible Italian descent who left before Evans was born; Evans has said &quot;I&#x27;ve heard people mumble something about him being Italian, but I don&#x27;t know for sure&quot;. A half-year later, 19-year-old Helene returned to Newark, New Jersey, and left Faith with her cousin Johnnie Mae and husband Orvelt Kennedy, the foster parents of more than 100 children they raised during the time that Faith lived with them. Faith had known Johnnie Mae and Orvelt Kennedy as her grandparents. It was not until a couple of years later that Helene&#x27;s career floundered and she tried to take Evans back home. Faith, however, was afraid to leave what she had &quot;been used to,&quot; and instead, Helene relocated next door.

Raised in a Christian home, Evans began singing at church at age two. At age four, she caught the attention of the congregation of the Emmanuel Baptist Church in Newark when she sang The 5th Dimension&#x27;s song &quot;Let the Sunshine In&quot;. While attending University High School in Newark, she sang with several jazz bands and, encouraged by Helene, entered outside pageants, festivals and contests, where her voice would be noticed and praised. After graduating from high school in 1991, Evans attended Fordham University in New York City to study marketing but left a year later to have daughter Chyna with music producer Kiyamma Griffin. In 1993, she relocated to Los Angeles, where she worked as a backup vocalist for singer Al B. Sure!, when she was noticed by musician Sean &quot;Puff Daddy&quot; Combs. Impressed with her, Combs contracted her as the first female artist to his Bad Boy Entertainment record label during 1994.

===1994–2001: &quot;Faith&quot;, Biggie, &quot;Keep The Faith&quot;, motherhood and marriage===
Newly contracted to Bad Boy Records, Evans was asked by executive producer Combs to contribute backing vocals and co-write tracks for Mary J. Blige&#x27;s &quot;My Life&quot; (1994) and Usher&#x27;s self-titled debut album (1994) prior to starting work on her debut studio album &quot;Faith&quot;. Released on August 29, 1995, in North America, the album was a main collaboration with Bad Boy&#x27;s main producers, The Hitmen, including Chucky Thompson and Combs, but it also resulted in recordings with Poke &amp; Tone and Herb Middleton. &quot;Faith&quot; became a success based on the singles &quot;You Used to Love Me&quot; and &quot;Soon as I Get Home&quot;. The album was eventually certified platinum with 1.5 million copies sold, according to RIAA.

A year before, on August 4, 1994, Evans married rapper and label mate Christopher &quot;The Notorious B.I.G.&quot; Wallace, after having met him at a Bad Boy photoshoot. The couple had one child together, Christopher George Latore Wallace Jr.
After allegations of an affair with Tupac Shakur, Evans became involved in the East Coast–West Coast hip hop rivalry which dominated rap music at the time. Wallace was murdered in a yet-to-be-solved drive-by shooting in Los Angeles, California in March 1997. During early 1997, after her separation from Wallace, but before his death, Evans&#x27; friend Missy Elliott introduced her to record company executive Todd Russaw. Faith began dating Russaw during her and Wallace&#x27;s separation and after Wallace died, Evans became pregnant by Russaw. The couple had their first son Joshua on June 10, 1998 (her 25th birthday). During the summer of 1998, Evans and Russaw were married, and on March 22, 2007, they had their second son Ryder Evan Russaw.

After Biggie&#x27;s murder on March 9, 1997, Combs helped Evans produce her tribute song named &quot;I&#x27;ll Be Missing You&quot;, based on the melody of The Police&#x27;s 1983 single &quot;Every Breath You Take&quot;. The song, which featured Combs, Evans, and the all-male group 112, became a worldwide number-one success and debuted at number one on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart during 1997, scoring that for eleven weeks. It eventually won Puffy, Evans and 112 the 1998 Grammy Award for Best Rap Performance by a Duo or Group. The next year, she received another two Grammy nominations for &quot;Heartbreak Hotel&quot;, a collaboration with singers Whitney Houston and Kelly Price, that scored number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot 100 chart.

Two years in the making, Evans&#x27; second studio album, &quot;Keep the Faith&quot;, was released by Bad Boy Records on October 27, 1998. Almost entirely written and produced by her, Evans considered the album difficult to complete as she had initially felt discouraged about the progress at first. Upon its release, however, the album earned generally positive reviews by music critics, with Allmusic noting it &quot;without a doubt a highlight of 1990s soul-pop music&quot;. Also enjoying commercial success, it eventually went platinum and produced the top ten singles &quot;Love Like This&quot; and &quot;All Night Long&quot; (released on March 30, 1999) prompting Evans to start an 18-city theater tour with Dru Hill and Total the following year.

===2001–2007: &quot;Faithfully&quot;, legal issues, Capitol Records and &quot;The First Lady&quot;===
Evans&#x27; third album on the Bad Boy label, named &quot;Faithfully&quot; (2001), involved her working with a wider range of producers, including The Neptunes, Mario Winans, Buckwild, Vada Nobles, Cory Rooney, and others. Her first project with husband Todd Russaw as executive producer and creative partner, the album scored number 14 on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 album chart and number two on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, eventually being certified platinum, but yielded moderately successful singles, with the Jennifer Lopez-written &quot;I Love You&quot; becoming the only top twenty entry. Released amid Bad Boy Records&#x27; transition from distributor Arista Records to Universal, Evans felt &quot;Faithfully&quot; received minimum assistance by the company, and during 2004, she finally decided to end her business with Bad Boy as she was convinced Combs couldn&#x27;t improve her career any more due to his other commitments.
In January 2004, Evans and Russaw were arrested and charged with possession of marijuana and cocaine and an improper tag violation during a traffic stop in Hapeville, a suburb of Atlanta, Georgia.

After leaving Bad Boy Entertainment, Evans contracted with Capitol Records, becoming the first contemporary R&amp;B artist to do so, and started work on her fourth studio album &quot;The First Lady&quot;, named after her nickname on her former label. As opposed to having an in-house team of producers who supplied most of the previous material, she and Russaw were able to gain more creative control of the album and consulted producers such as Bryan-Michael Cox, Jermaine Dupri, Mike Caren, Pharrell Williams, and Chucky Thompson to contribute to it. Upon its release in April 2005, &quot;The First Lady&quot; scored at number two on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one on the Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums chart, becoming Evans&#x27; best-charting album to date. It was eventually certified gold by the RIAA.

At the end of the year, Evans released &quot;A Faithful Christmas&quot;, a holiday album of traditional Christmas songs and original tracks. The effort would become her last release on Capitol Records as the company was bought during 2007.

===2005–2012: Hiatus, arrest, divorce and &quot;Something About Faith&quot;===

Following a 5-year hiatus, Evans created her own record label imprint in 2010. She named the imprint Prolific Music Group and hired top talent to build the record label from scratch. Evans began recording songs with Keyshia Cole, Redman, Snoop Dogg and Raekwon, among others for the labels freshman album. Evans signed a deal with independent record label E1 Entertainment later that year. Her fifth studio album &quot;Something About Faith&quot; was released on October 5, 2010, in the United States, where it debuted and peaked at number fifteen on the &quot;Billboard&quot; 200 and number one on the Independent Albums chart. &quot;Something About Faith&quot; has spawned the leading single &quot;Gone Already&quot;, which spent over thirty-three weeks on the US &quot;Billboard&quot; Hot R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Songs chart, where it peaked at number twenty-two.

In August 2010, Evans was arrested on suspicion of misdemeanor drunken driving, after being stopped at a checkpoint in Marina del Rey, California. In 2011, Evans filed for divorce against Russaw. The couple agreed to spend 13 weeks in a drug-treatment program in exchange for halting any further prosecution of their drug-possession case. In May 2011, Evans and Russaw announced they were getting a divorce, and stated they would like to keep it quiet for their children&#x27;s sakes.

===2012–2016: &quot;R&amp;B Divas: Atlanta&quot; and &quot;Incomparable&quot; ===
In 2012, Evans co-executive produced and became a cast member on the TV One reality show &quot;R&amp;B Divas: Atlanta&quot; alongside fellow R&amp;B singers Nicci Gilbert, Syleena Johnson, Keke Wyatt and Monifah. The show offered an inside look at how the singers balance their music careers and personal lives as they work towards producing an Evans-led compilation album, &quot;R&amp;B Divas&quot; (2012), in memory of Whitney Houston. Broadcast to rating records for the network, the series produced a spin-off titled &quot;R&amp;B Divas: Los Angeles&quot; and was renewed for two further seasons. Evans, who left the show following its second season, earned a Grammy nomination for Best R&amp;B Album at the 55th awards ceremony.

In August 2013, Evans confirmed she had begun work on her seventh studio album &quot;Incomparable&quot;, with contribution from Chucky Thompson, Mike City, KeKe Wyatt, B.Slade and Karen Clark Sheard of The Clark Sisters. &quot;I Deserve It&quot;, a record featuring recurring collaborator Missy Elliott and her protégée Sharaya J, was released on August 25, 2014, as the album&#x27;s lead single and peaked at number 19 on &quot;Billboard&quot;″s Adult R&amp;B Songs chart. &quot;Incomparable&quot; was released on November 24, 2014, by Prolific Music Group and BMG Rights Management. It debuted at number 27 on the US Top R&amp;B/Hip-Hop Albums and number 17 on the US Independent Albums chart.

===2016–present: &quot;The King &amp; I&quot;, and &quot;The Masked Singer&quot;===

In 2016, Evans announced that she was finishing a posthumous Notorious B.I.G. album titled &quot;The King &amp; I&quot;, featuring duets with her late husband. The album was released on May 19, 2017.

On July 17, 2018, she married producer and &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop: Atlanta&quot; star Stevie J. The couple released the hit song &quot;A Minute&quot; on July 27, 2018. Between 2015 and 2019 Evans appeared in several episodes of &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop: Atlanta&quot;, and &quot;Leave It to Stevie&quot; alongside then friend Stevie J.

In May 2020, Evans was arrested for felony domestic violence against Stevie J. She was released on bond and the charges were later dropped. In 2021, Stevie J filed for divorce. The divorce was finalized in 2023.

In 2021, Evans competed in season six of &quot;The Masked Singer&quot; as &quot;Skunk&quot;. She was unmasked during the Group A Finals where she made references to the loss of The Notorious B.I.G. and her son being autistic.

==Other ventures==
===Acting===
Having previously appeared in stage plays as a teenager, Evans began acting with a supporting role in director Robert Adetuyi&#x27;s 2000 music drama &quot;Turn It Up&quot;, featuring Pras Michel from The Fugees, Jason Statham and Ja Rule. Released to generally negative reviews from critics, who noted it &quot;patently absurd in both the details and larger aspects&quot;, the indie film had a short play and became a financial disappointment, gaining US$1.24 million during its U.S. run only.

During 2003, Evans acted in the MTV-produced romantic comedy &quot;The Fighting Temptations&quot; in which she appeared in a brief but major role portraying a single mother and night club singer. Filmed in Columbus, Georgia and headed by Cuba Gooding Jr. (her character is his mother) and Beyoncé Knowles, the film garnered mixed reviews by critics, but scored top three of the U.S. box office, resulting in a domestic gross of US$30.2 million. In addition, Evans recorded a contemporary cover version of Donna Summer&#x27;s 1978 success &quot;Heaven Knows&quot; for the film which her character performs during one of the first in sequence in the film. The accompanying soundtrack scored the top twenty of the U.S. &quot;Billboard&quot; 200.

During 2004, Evans earned a brief guest stint on the UPN situation comedy &quot;Half &amp; Half&quot;. In 2009, Evans announced that she had been working on a synopsis for her own situation comedy that would be based largely on her life but with a more comedic aspect. It is unknown whether she has officially pitched the sitcom to any television networks, as of 2024.

Evans has had cameos on the reality show &quot;Love &amp; Hip Hop: Atlanta&quot;.

===Florence Ballard biopic===
In November 2010, several sources stated that Faith would portray Motown star Florence Ballard of the Supremes in an upcoming biopic, &quot;Blondie: The Florence Ballard Story&quot;. With the blessing of Ballard&#x27;s three daughters, Faith later appeared on &quot;The Wendy Williams Show&quot; to promote this role. In July 2014, &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reported that the movie, thought to be titled &quot;Blondie&quot;, was in fact a con artist&#x27;s scam.

===Writing===
Evans released her autobiographic book called &quot;Keep the Faith: A Memoir&quot; on August 29, 2008. Written with Aliya S. King, it detailed the singer&#x27;s life, but also discussed Evans&#x27; controversial relationship with her late husband, the Notorious B.I.G.:
&quot;I want people to understand that although he was a large part of my life, my story doesn&#x27;t actually begin or end with Big&#x27;s death. My journey has been complicated on many levels. And since I am always linked to Big, there are a lot of misconceptions about who I really am. It&#x27;s not easy putting your life out there for the masses. But I&#x27;ve decided I&#x27;ll tell my own story. For Big. For my children. And for myself.&quot; In its initial release, &quot;Keep the Faith: A Memoir&quot; landed in the Top 20 on New York&#x27;s Best Seller&#x27;s List two consecutive weeks in a row. During 2009, the book received The 2009 African American Literary Award for Best Biography/Memoir.

==Philanthropy==
In 2014, Faith showed support for Little Kids Rock by donating items for auction to raise money in support of music education in public schools.

==Artistry==
Faith Evans said that some of her biggest musical influences and favourite singers are gospel singer Karen Clark-Sheard (whom she has been often likened to), Shirley Murdock, Chaka Khan, Anita Baker and Aretha Franklin.

Evans is noted for her &quot;urban-edged honeyed soprano.&quot; Her vocal range extends from the low note of C#3 to high soprano C#6 . &quot;The Washington Post&quot; writer Craig Seymour called her &quot;angelic yet hearty soprano&quot; as showcasing emotion that is defined by Evans&#x27; personal experiences of tragedy, love, pain and heartbreak.

<doc id="368205" wikidata="Q1849053" url="?curid=368205" title="Triumph (band)">
<text>Triumph were a Canadian hard rock band formed in 1975 that was popular during the late 1970s and the 1980s, building on its reputation and success as a live band. Between its 16 albums and DVDs, the band has received 18 gold and nine platinum awards in Canada and the United States. They were nominated for multiple Juno Awards, including the &quot;Group of the Year Award&quot; in 1979, 1985, 1986, and 1987. They were inducted into the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame in 2007, into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame in 2008, and into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame in 2019.

Triumph is most known for its guitar-driven rock songs, such as &quot;Lay It on the Line&quot;, &quot;Magic Power&quot;, &quot;Fight the Good Fight&quot; and &quot;World of Fantasy&quot;, although it originally earned notice for strong cover songs, like &quot;Rocky Mountain Way&quot;. The band was formed in Toronto, and for much of its existence featured Rik Emmett (guitar, lead/backing vocals), Mike Levine (bass, keyboards, backing vocals), and Gil Moore (drums, lead/backing vocals). This line-up, which recorded the band&#x27;s first nine studio albums, lasted until 1988, when Emmett left Triumph to pursue a solo career. He was replaced by Phil &quot;X&quot; Xenedis, and Triumph recorded their last album to date, &quot;Edge of Excess&quot;, with him before going on indefinite hiatus in 1993. The classic line-up of Moore, Levine and Emmett reunited for two live concerts in 2008, at Sweden Rock Festival and Rocklahoma, and again in 2019 for a three-song performance in Toronto.

== History ==

=== Early days and first two albums (1975–1978) ===
Before Triumph was a four-piece blues-based band consisting of Fred Keeler (guitar), Peter Young (organ), Mike Levine (bass) and Gil Moore (drums, vocals). This group, called Abernathy Shagnaster, signed to Canada&#x27;s Attic Records in 1975 and issued the non-charting single &quot;Hobo&quot;/&quot;Got to Get You Back in My Life&quot;.

Keeler and Young left the group soon after the band&#x27;s first single was released and in the summer of 1975 Moore and Levine met guitarist Rik Emmett, who was playing at Toronto&#x27;s Hollywood Tavern in a band called ACT III. After jamming with the pair at Moore&#x27;s house in Mississauga and reviewing the group&#x27;s existing contracts, Emmett agreed to join the band, now called Triumph. Triumph&#x27;s first paid concert with Emmett was at Simcoe High School in September 1975.

Guitarist Emmett&#x27;s songwriting style brought both progressive rock and classical music influences; most Triumph albums included a classical guitar solo piece. Moore doubled as lead singer on many of the band&#x27;s heavier songs and in their later years, some softer ballads; bassist and pianist Levine produced their early albums. As with many progressive rock and heavy metal bands, Triumph&#x27;s style proved unpopular with rock critics; &quot;Rolling Stone&quot; reviewers labelled them a &quot;faceless band&quot;.

Triumph&#x27;s self-titled first album in was originally released in Canada in 1976. It was later renamed on re-issues as &quot;In the Beginning&quot;. The second LP &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Machine&quot; followed in 1977 and contained a version of the Joe Walsh song &quot;Rocky Mountain Way&quot;. Neither of these original albums were released in the United States; however, RCA Records released a debut US album in 1978 also titled &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Machine&quot;. This album, also released internationally, combines songs from both Canadian releases with new artwork. &quot;Rocky Mountain Way&quot; received some scattered US airplay.

In February 1978 Triumph subbed in for Sammy Hagar on a radio-station promotion date for 99.5 KISS-FM in San Antonio, Texas, followed by a run of five shows in Texas for JAM Productions (a promoter named Joe A Miller), then toured across Canada with fellow Canadian rockers Moxy and Trooper.

On August 26, 1978, they were headliners at the Canada Jam Festival at Mosport Park, playing before a crowd of about 110,000 people.

=== Mainstream popularity (1979–1985) ===
Triumph&#x27;s third album, &quot;Just a Game&quot; (1979), featured a moderate US radio hit, &quot;Hold On&quot;, which reached No. 38 on the Billboard Hot 100. &quot;Hold On&quot; became a significant song in some select markets; for example, in St. Louis the song made it to No. 1 on KSHE and KWK, album-oriented/classic rock FM radio stations. &quot;Hold On&quot; peaked at No. 33 on the RPM Singles chart in Canada. The second single &quot;Lay It on the Line&quot; received greater acceptance at album-oriented rock FM radio across the U.S. and Canada. &quot;Lay It on the Line&quot; received heavy FM radio airplay, and reached No. 86 on the Billboard Hot 100. In &quot;oldies&quot; classic-rock format radio stations in the US, it remains the most widely played and recognized song from the Triumph catalogue. The album eventually went gold in the US.

In 1980, the band&#x27;s fourth album &quot;Progressions of Power&quot; was released and peaked at No. 32 in the US, reaching gold in overall sales. Its single &quot;I Can Survive&quot; peaked at No. 91 on the Hot 100. That year the band performed their heavy metal show in Passaic, New Jersey; it was their first show in the New York area.

1981&#x27;s &quot;Allied Forces&quot; sold over a million copies in the US, while attaining the highest chart positions any Triumph album would attain; No. 23 in the US and No. 13 in Canada. It included the songs &quot;Fight the Good Fight&quot; and &quot;Magic Power&quot;, the latter of which reached no. 5 at Canada&#x27;s largest Top 40 radio station, CHUM-AM in Toronto. &quot;Magic Power&quot; peaked at No. 14 on the national Canadian RPM Singles chart, their biggest hit in their native Canada. &quot;Magic Power&quot; reached No. 8 on the Billboard Mainstream Top Rock Tracks chart and No. 51 on the Hot 100, while &quot;Fight the Good Fight&quot; went to No. 18 on the Top Rock Tracks chart.

&quot;Never Surrender&quot; was initially released in 1982 on Attic Records in Canada, and was not released in the United States until January 1983. The album attained gold status in the US, and peaked at No. 26 on the US album chart. It saw the band&#x27;s compositions take on more political overtones. Previously, Emmett had included a single political theme on each Triumph album. (&quot;Just a Game&quot;, &quot;Hard Road&quot;, and &quot;Ordinary Man&quot; portray Rik Emmett&#x27;s strong populist leanings.) However, &quot;Never Surrender&quot; featured five anthems. The Jimi Hendrix-inspired riff-rocker &quot;Too Much Thinking&quot; even samples Ronald Reagan from one of his presidential speeches. &quot;All the Way&quot; (No. 2) and &quot;A World of Fantasy&quot; (No. 3) became Triumph&#x27;s highest ever charting songs on the Top Rock Tracks chart, while the title track peaked at No. 23. The album earned gold record status in the United States (sales of 500,000 units). However, Triumph&#x27;s relationship with RCA Records soured at this point; MCA Records executive Irving Azoff co-opted their debts and signed them for five albums. Following their 1984 label change, MCA took over distribution of their old catalogue for ten years. After the shift to MCA, the band began to work with outside producers, and their studio albums became increasingly difficult to replicate onstage. Triumph eventually added Rick Santers, a Toronto guitar and keyboard player, in 1986 to support their last three tours.

&quot;Thunder Seven&quot; was released in late 1984, initially as a compact disc. Despite two hit singles and videos, &quot;Spellbound&quot; (No. 10 on the Top Rock Tracks chart) and &quot;Follow Your Heart&quot; (No. 13), the album failed to achieve expected levels of sales; cassette and vinyl formats were soon released. On &quot;Thunder Seven&quot; Emmett&#x27;s lyrics addressed social concerns in an adult context and Rik Emmett and Gil Moore sang alternating vocal parts in &quot;Follow Your Heart&quot; and &quot;Killing Time&quot;. Continuing in the direction of &quot;Never Surrender&quot;, the entire second side formed a loose concept focusing on different perspectives of time with &quot;Time Canon&quot; mostly featuring multiple part voice harmonies. &quot;Thunder Seven&quot; became an RIAA certified gold album in 2003.

In 1985, the band released &quot;Stages&quot;, a double live set culled from the previous three tours. It also included two new songs, including &quot;Mind Games&quot;, for which a video was filmed, but the song failed to chart in either Canada or the U.S. On June 7, 1985, Triumph was ranked No. 2 in Performance Magazine&#x27;s 6-week period ending &quot;Tops in Performance&quot; list. That year the band performed with Mountain at the Prairie Capital Convention Center in Illinois.

=== &quot;The Sport of Kings&quot;, &quot;Surveillance&quot; and split with Rik Emmett (1986–1991) ===
Triumph took a more commercial turn with their 1986 studio album, &quot;The Sport of Kings&quot;. Rik Emmett&#x27;s &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Out There&quot; reached the American Top 40 in late 1986, a significant amount of radio and video exposure. Written and recorded in the eleventh hour of &quot;The Sport of Kings&quot; sessions, in an attempt to deliver a hit single to satisfy the demands of the record company, &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Out There&quot; made it to No. 27 on Billboard Hot 100 during October and November 1986. &quot;Somebody&#x27;s Out There&quot; still stands as the highest-charting song from the Triumph catalogue on the Hot 100. It also reached No. 9 on the Top Rock Tracks chart, although it did less well in Canada, only reaching No. 84 on the singles chart there. Gil Moore&#x27;s &quot;Tears in the Rain&quot;, cut from the same cloth as &quot;Mind Games&quot;, did not fare as well in the charts in the US, as it peaked at No. 23 on the Top Rock Tracks charts. The third single, the slow-tempo &quot;Just One Night&quot;, which also had a video, did fairly well in Canada, hitting No. 33 on the singles chart in April 1987, but did not chart in the US. Adding the aforementioned Rick Santers to their line-up, Triumph toured with Swedish guitarist Yngwie Malmsteen across the United States in the fall of 1986.

In 1987 the band attempted a return to their usual style with &quot;Surveillance.&quot; While Gil Moore and Mike Levine remained firmly planted in blues-rock, Rik Emmett took a more modern progressive turn, even involving Dixie Dregs and Kansas guitarist Steve Morse. They collaborated on a dual-guitar solo for Gil Moore&#x27;s angst-ridden vocal on the Emmett/Santers-penned &quot;Headed for Nowhere&quot;. The first single released to radio stations in Canada was &quot;Let the Light Shine on Me&quot;, which did well on certain Canadian rock stations, such as reaching number 1 at Q107 in Toronto (as the lead one or two singles on most Triumph albums since 1979 had) while reaching No. 61 on the Canadian singles chart. It did not chart in the US. The first single released to radio stations in the US, &quot;Long Time Gone&quot;, reached number 23 on the Top Rock Tracks chart; the song did not chart in Canada. A video was released for the single &quot;Never Say Never&quot;, but the song was not able to chart on the Top Rock Tracks chart or on the Canadian Singles chart.

The 1988 tour, during which the band members experienced growing disharmony over business decisions and artistic direction, ended with a September 3 show on the Kingswood stage at Canada&#x27;s Wonderland. Later that year Emmett left Triumph and began a solo career; the three didn&#x27;t perform together again for many years. Emmett&#x27;s first album, &quot;Absolutely&quot;, yielded four hits in Canada. Meanwhile, Triumph released 1989&#x27;s &quot;Classics&quot; as their obligatory fifth album owed to MCA Records.

=== Phil X-era, &quot;Edge of Excess&quot; and hiatus (1992–2006) ===
In 1992, the remaining members of Triumph recruited Phil Xenidis, a Canadian guitarist known for his work with Aldo Nova and Frozen Ghost. Moore was the principal songwriter and lead singer for 1992&#x27;s &quot;Edge of Excess&quot;, with additional help from guitarist-producer Mladen Zarron. Rick Santers also remained on hand as touring guitarist/keyboardist and singer for the 1993 North American tour, singing Rik Emmett&#x27;s parts in fan favourites &quot;Magic Power&quot; and &quot;Fight the Good Fight&quot;. Initial reception of the album from American radio seemed quite favourable, until Triumph&#x27;s recording label, a subsidiary of Polygram, dissolved unexpectedly in 1993.

Moore, Levine and Rick Santers were joined by Triumph superfan Sebastian Bach of Skid Row and Phil X for a performance of &quot;Rock &amp; Roll Machine&quot; at the Q107 Rock Awards on December 1, 1993.

But by the end of 1993, the remaining members of Triumph had effectively disbanded, mostly due to their record label&#x27;s collapse.

In 1998 Rik Emmett resisted overtures from his former bandmates for a potentially lucrative twentieth anniversary US tour, stating he was not interested. Nevertheless, Moore and Levine purchased and acquired back their entire album catalogue from MCA and launched their own label TML Entertainment, and they continue to release live recordings and videos from their long career.

In 2003 TML released a live DVD album called &quot;Live at the US Festival&quot; originally recorded in San Bernardino, California at the US Festival in 1983. This historic festival, attracting nearly 250,000 rock fans, also featured Van Halen and the Clash. Triumph had earlier released this concert on VHS following the &quot;Never Surrender&quot; tour, featuring two videos from the forthcoming &quot;Thunder Seven&quot; album. In 2004, TML released a second DVD concert, &quot;A Night of Triumph&quot;, filmed in 1987 at Halifax Metro Centre during &quot;The Sport of Kings&quot; tour. The most comprehensive Triumph anthology, &quot;Livin&#x27; for the Weekend: Anthology&quot;, was issued in 2005. A CD of extended versions of some of the band&#x27;s most popular hits called &quot;Extended Versions: Triumph&quot; was released in 2006.

In the 1980s Moore opened and operated Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, originally for Triumph&#x27;s exclusive use; more recently the company has been training engineers and sound technicians for Canada&#x27;s music industry.

=== Reunion with Rik Emmett (2007–present) ===
On March 10, 2007, Triumph was inducted to the Canadian Music Industry Hall of Fame in a ceremony at Toronto&#x27;s Fairmont Royal York Hotel. All members of the &quot;classic&quot; group line-up (Emmett, Moore, Levine) were present for the event. Although there were no plans for a Triumph reunion, and Moore had taken on a full-time career at Metalworks, the band members didn&#x27;t rule out future collaborations; Nick Blagona, for example, mastered Emmett&#x27;s latest hard rock project, &quot;Airtime&quot; (2007), in the Metalworks mastering suite.

On April 6, 2008, Triumph was inducted into the Canadian Music Hall of Fame as part of the Juno Awards.

In 2008, Triumph&#x27;s classic line-up performed live for the first time since 1988 with two reunion concerts: the first on June 7 at the Sweden Rock Festival in Solvesborg, Sweden, and the second on July 11 at the Rocklahoma music festival in Pryor, Oklahoma.

In 2011, the band reissued &quot;Allied Forces&quot; as a vinyl package for their 30th anniversary.

On July 14, 2011, Triumph Lane in Mississauga, ON, was officially dedicated in honour of the band.

On August 28, 2012, the band released a CD+DVD package of their June 7, 2008, reunion concert in Sweden titled &quot;Live at Sweden Rock Festival&quot; on Frontiers Records in Europe and on the TML label in Canada and the United States.

In 2013, Triumph was inducted into Legends Row at the inaugural ceremony held at Mississauga City Hall.

In 2016, Rik Emmett released the album &quot;RES9&quot;, which included the song &quot;Grand Parade&quot;, on which Gil Moore played drums and Mike Levine played bass. The song is a ballad reminiscent of &quot;Suitcase Blues&quot; and even includes the line &quot;Me, I&#x27;m hanging out with Johnny Walker once again.&quot;

In 2019, Triumph were named Legends Of Live at the 2019 Live Music Industry Awards at Canadian Music Week.

On November 16, 2019, Triumph performed together for the first time in eleven years at an invite-only event at Metalworks Studios in Mississauga, Ontario, where they played three songs — &quot;When the Lights Go Down&quot;, &quot;Lay It on the Line&quot; and &quot;Magic Power&quot; — in front of approximately 300 &quot;superfans&quot; in attendance. This Superfan Fantasy performance was taped for the Banger Films documentary &quot;Triumph: Rock &#x27;n Roll Machine&quot;. That same month, Triumph were inducted into Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame. When asked if the band will perform again in the future, Emmett said, &quot;I think we&#x27;re gonna try and do it every 11 years or so. That&#x27;s the length of time it had been since we did a reunion in Sweden.&quot;

On September 10, 2021, &quot;Triumph: Rock &amp; Roll Machine&quot; documentary debuted at the Toronto International Film Festival (TIFF).

== Philanthropy ==
Since the group&#x27;s inception, individually and collectively, Triumph have contributed time, energy, music, facilities, equipment and funds in support of a wide range of charitable, educational and humanitarian causes.

Triumph&#x27;s largest single charitable contribution was its final appearance at Maple Leaf Gardens in Toronto, January 22, 1987. Staged by Gary Slaight for the &quot;Sounds United&quot; campaign of the United Way of Canada, Greater Toronto Division, all proceeds of $179,356.66 were donated. More recently, the trio has raised over $250,000 (and still counting) with its Signed Guitars Program. Since 2009 Triumph has signed over 100 Fender guitars and donated them to various charities for live and silent auctions, raising between $1,500 and $6,500 each. Individually, Emmett has also contributed guitars for Kids With Cancer, CNIB Ride For Sight and Barrett House Aids Hospice.

In 2011 Triumph donated their music and business archives to the University of Toronto Libraries.

Moore, Levine and Emmett have participated, together and separately, in many major fundraising events, including the latter&#x27;s appearance on &quot;Tears Are Not Enough&quot;, the Canadian music industry single for Ethiopian Famine Release in 1985, which would eventually raise over $3.5 million. Moore, along with Tom Cochrane and Rush&#x27;s Alex Lifeson, and others, served on the committee which spearheaded the tsunami relief effort, Canada for Asia, in 2005.

Other causes Triumph and Metalworks have supported and/or sponsored include: MusiCounts, Rock Star for a Day Program, the Children&#x27;s Wish Foundation, Canada&#x27;s Walk of Fame Emerging Artist Program, Canadian Music Week National Songwriting Contests, many High School Battle of the Bands, Full Circle, Camp Rock, Bike for Betty, and Friends of We Care – Easter Seals. The state-of-the-art facilities at Metalworks Studios have also been donated many times to help causes, including the Canadian Live 8 concert, held in Barrie, Ontario on July 2, 2005.

In 1996, Triumph donated royalties from one million units of the song &quot;Magic Power&quot; on the certified Diamond &quot;Oh What a Feeling: A Vital Collection of Canadian Music&quot; compilation CD in support of the Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Science and Juno Award, as they have done many times in support of charitable initiatives. Moore has participated in and donated Triumph autographed guitars to celebrity golf fundraising tournaments, Levine has bowled for TJ Martell Foundation and Emmett regularly performs at fundraisers for many causes, including AIDS, Food Bank and Shelter benefits.

In 2013 Emmett was awarded the Queen Elizabeth II Diamond Jubilee Medal in 2012 for Community Service and Moore was given a star on the Mississauga Music Walk of Fame for contributions to education and community support. Metalworks Production Group was given the 2014 Sam McCallion Small Business Community Involvement Award by the Mississauga Board of Trade. Metalworks Institute coordinates volunteers for Make Music Matter, a Calgary-based charity (formerly Song For Africa), by going to Africa and sharing their technological and musical training. In May 2015, Moore Received the Mississauga Arts Council, Laurie Pallett Patron of the Arts, MARTY Award for his contributions to the Mississauga arts community. In April 2016, Moore received the Mississauga Board of Trade, Lifetime Achievement Award for his dedication to business in Mississauga and the community.

The group members have also served on various boards over the years. In 2014, Moore joined the Advisory Boards of Music Canada and CAAMA (Canadian Association for the Advancement of Music and the Arts) and Levine serves on the board of directors and advisory board for the Musicians&#x27; Rights Organization Canada (MROC). In the past Emmett has served on the Advisory Boards at Humber College and the Songwriters Association of Canada. Moore has also served on the executive board at Canadian Academy of Recording Arts and Science (CARAS) as well as the Toronto Musicians Association (TMA).

<doc id="368208" wikidata="Q1191417" url="?curid=368208" title="Department of Conservation (New Zealand)">
<text>The Department of Conservation (DOC; Māori: &quot;Te Papa Atawhai&quot;) is the public service department of New Zealand charged with the conservation of New Zealand&#x27;s natural and historical heritage.

An advisory body, the New Zealand Conservation Authority (NZCA) is provided to advise DOC and its ministers. In addition there are 15 conservation boards for different areas around the country that provide for interaction between DOC and the public.

==Functions and history==

=== Overview ===

The department was formed on 1 April 1987, as one of several reforms of the public service, when the &quot;Conservation Act 1987&quot; was passed to integrate some functions of the Department of Lands and Survey, the Forest Service and the Wildlife Service. This act also set out the majority of the department&#x27;s responsibilities and roles.

As a consequence of Conservation Act all Crown land in New Zealand designated for conservation and protection became managed by the Department of Conservation. This is about 30% of New Zealand&#x27;s land area or about 8 million hectares of native forests, tussocklands, alpine areas, wetlands, dunelands, estuaries, lakes and islands, national forests, maritime parks, marine reserves, nearly 4000 reserves, river margins, some coastline, and many offshore islands. All of the land under its control is protected for either conservation, ecological, scenic, scientific, historic or cultural reasons, and for recreation.

Providing for recreation is a major part of its core work, and this covers the management of family picnic sites, as well as maintaining rugged backcountry tracks and over 1000 accompanying backcountry huts that are used by hunters and recreational trampers. DOC also administers the Nature Heritage Fund, and is responsible for supporting rural fire control by acting under the direction of Fire and Emergency New Zealand when a fire occurs on land it manages. Up until June 2017, DOC was the designated fire authority for all land under its control.

In addition to its work managing land and providing for recreation in New Zealand, DOC works to preserve its natural heritage. This includes preservation of historic sites on public conservation land, saving native threatened species, managing threats like pests and weeds, environmental restoration, caring for marine life, and assisting landowners to effectively preserve natural heritage.

The methods of achieving these goals have resulted in controversy, where some people claim that the Department of Conservation is overly biased towards environmentalists at the expense of New Zealand&#x27;s economy. This is particularly a concern amongst some farmers and other industries that are major users of neighbouring land, many of whom have been affected by decisions of the department. However, these criticised DOC efforts have also been lauded for achieving some success, for both conservationists and farmers, having led to a significant drop in possum populations during the last decades.

The DOC was floated as the agency to supervise the construction of the proposed New Zealand Cycleway, though this is now being managed primarily by the Ministry of Tourism, in coordination with the DOC where appropriate.

After a number of years of falling budgets, in 2013 the department announced it would be slashing 140 jobs and narrowing its 11-region structure into six.

As part of New Zealand&#x27;s programme of economic recovery post the peak of the Covid-19 pandemic and the following economic downturn DOC is working alongside the Ministry for the Environment, Department of Conservation, Ministry for Primary Industries, Land Information New Zealand and Ministry of Business Innovation and Employment to fund a number of temporary projects with the objective of creating jobs and assisting New Zealand&#x27;s efforts to further protect the environment. As of June 2023 the project, entitled &quot;Jobs For Nature&quot;, has employed 4,694 individuals over 193 projects. The programme&#x27;s investment is estimated to be worth approximately NZ$1.19Billion, with the projects undertaken focused on providing temporary employment as well benefit the environment, people, and regional New Zealand.

In April 2024, the department proposed slashing 130 roles as part of efforts to meet Government budget spending cut targets of 6.5%. In addition, DOC must also find NZ$7.2 million to meet cost operating pressures. The proposed job cuts include 24 &quot;Biodiversity, Heritage &amp; Visitors&quot; roles, 22 Policy &amp; Regulatory services roles, 18 public affairs roles and 54 Regional Operations support roles.

===Headquarters===
The Department of Conservation moved into a new headquarters, Conservation House, on Manners Street, Wellington in 2006. It is the first green building in New Zealand to be given a 5-star rating, having won numerous environmental awards, including a top 10 placing by Grist Magazine. The site was originally a cinema complex operated by the Hoyts Group from the mid-1980s until the early 2000s, when it closed down in the face of stiff competition.

== Conservation land ==
New Zealand has 13 national parks, and a wide number of other conservation lands with varying levels of environmental protection, called the &quot;conservation estate&quot; in total. About one third of this estate, generally the land considered most valuable, has been protected from mining since 1997 via being listed in Schedule 4 of the Crown Minerals Act 1991 (though recent (2010) moves by the Fifth National Government have proposed exemption some areas from Schedule 4).

While much of the conservation land not protected as national parks or Schedule 4 land is much more damaged or human-modified than the core conservation areas, these areas serve as boundary and species buffer zones.

==Incidents ==
===Cave Creek disaster===
In 1995, 14 people died when a viewing platform maintained by the Department of Conservation collapsed. Immediately following the tragedy, all of the department&#x27;s 106 viewing platforms throughout New Zealand were checked. Fifteen platforms were closed for repairs.

A Commission of Inquiry that followed the tragedy revealed that the department had acted illegally and negligently in constructing the viewing platform. The commission also stated that the department was seriously underfunded for the tasks with which it was delegated, resulting in a culture of sub-standard safety procedures having been used for the building and maintenance of some of its facilities.

Many people in New Zealand criticised the government for the department&#x27;s situation, and Denis Marshall, the presiding Minister of Conservation at the time, eventually resigned over the incident. Since the inquiry, radical changes have been made to the department&#x27;s procedures to prioritise safety, including the implementation of a comprehensive asset management system to catalogue, track and trigger regular inspections of all significant structures and facilities managed by the department.

===Raoul Island eruption===
In March 2006, a volcanic eruption at the Green Lake of Raoul Island, administered by the Department of Conservation, was believed to have killed DOC worker Mark Kearney. At the exact time of the eruption, Kearney is thought to have been taking temperature measurements of the lake as part of a programme for monitoring volcanic activity. Five other DOC workers, who were also living on the island, were forced to evacuate back to New Zealand shortly after the eruption. Searches for Kearney, which have been inhibited by the island&#x27;s remote location and the risks of further volcanic activity, have since failed to find any signs of him.

<doc id="368209" wikidata="Q352292" url="?curid=368209" title="David Michelinie">
<text>David Michelinie (; born May 6, 1948) is an American comic book writer best known for scripting Marvel Comics&#x27; &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; and &quot;Iron Man&quot; and the DC Comics feature Superman in &quot;Action Comics&quot;. Among the characters he created or co-created are Venom, Carnage, Scott Lang / Ant-Man and War Machine.

==Early career==
Michelinie grew up in Louisville, Kentucky, and worked at a commercial film production company before moving to New York to take part in an apprenticeship program started by DC Comics.

Some of Michelinie&#x27;s earliest work appears in DC Comics&#x27; &quot;House of Secrets&quot; and a run on &quot;Swamp Thing&quot; (#14–18 and #21–22), the latter illustrated by Nestor Redondo. Michelinie and artist Ernie Chan created &quot;Claw the Unconquered&quot; in 1975. Michelinie did a run on Aquaman in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; which led to the revival of the Sea King&#x27;s own title in 1977. In the Aquaman story in &quot;Adventure Comics&quot; #452, Black Manta killed Aquaman&#x27;s son Arthur Curry Jr. by suffocation. The infant&#x27;s death has affected the character ever since. While writing the &quot;Karate Kid&quot; series, Michelinie used the name &quot;Barry Jameson&quot; as a pseudonym. With artist Ed Davis, he created Gravedigger in &quot;Men of War&quot; #1 (Aug. 1977). The Star Hunters were created by Michelinie with editor Joe Orlando and artist Don Newton, debuted in &quot;DC Super Stars&quot; #16 (Sept.–Oct. 1977), and featured in their own short-lived series. The original storyline for Madame Xanadu in &quot;Doorway to Nightmare&quot; #1 (Feb. 1978) was developed by Michelinie and Val Mayerik.

==Marvel Comics==
Among Michelinie&#x27;s best-known work are his two runs on &quot;Iron Man&quot; with co-plotter/inker Bob Layton, in the late 1970s and early 1980s which introduced the character&#x27;s alcoholism and his specialized power armor variants. He introduced two of Stark&#x27;s closest comrades, Bethany Cabe and Jim Rhodes as well as new enmities with Justin Hammer and Doctor Doom. His most noted cliffhanger was when Tony Stark is thrown out of S.H.I.E.L.D.&#x27;s helicarrier and has to don his armor completely to use its flight function before he hits the ground. After leaving the title in 1981, Michelinie reunited with Layton on the book late in 1986, and along with penciller M. D. Bright, closed out preceding writer Dennis O&#x27;Neil&#x27;s Advanced Idea Mechanics arc and launched the &quot;Armor Wars&quot;; during this time he and Layton introduced the Ghost. Michelinie said that he had thought he would never return to &quot;Iron Man&quot;, feeling that by the end of his run he and Bob Layton had done everything they set out to do with the series, but when the editor offered him the assignment, he agreed to do it after thinking about it overnight. Michelinie left &quot;Iron Man&quot; again after issue #250, closing his second collaboration with Layton with a sequel to their Iron Man-Doctor Doom time travel episode from issues #149–150.

Michelinie was one of the writers of &quot;The Avengers&quot; from 1978 to 1982 and worked with artists John Byrne and George Pérez. During this time he and Byrne created Scott Lang in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #181 (March 1979), and he created the Taskmaster with Pérez in &quot;The Avengers&quot; #195 (May 1980).

From 1987 to 1994, Michelinie wrote &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; series, which featured the art of Todd McFarlane, Erik Larsen, and Mark Bagley, while introducing the supervillains Venom in issue #298 (March 1988) and Carnage in #361 (April 1992). Michelinie had planned to introduce Venom earlier and included a &quot;teaser&quot; scene in &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot; #18, in which Peter Parker is pushed by an offscreen Venom into the path of an oncoming train, the symbiote being unsusceptible to Spider-Man&#x27;s &quot;spider sense&quot; that would have normally warned him of the attack. This was the first of what was to be several clues leading to the reveal of Venom. Michelinie left &quot;Web of Spider-Man&quot; shortly after and was not able to continue the introduction of Venom until his time writing &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot;.

Behind Stan Lee, Michelinie had the second longest run on &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man&quot; as a writer.

He also wrote the limited series &quot;&quot; in 1993, where Venom was the main character and acted as an antihero instead of villain for the first time.

==Valiant, return to DC and Future Comics==
In the early 1990s David Michelinie worked at Valiant Comics on the titles &quot;Rai&quot;, &quot;H.A.R.D. Corps&quot;, &quot;Turok: Dinosaur Hunter&quot; and &quot;Magnus, Robot Fighter.&quot;

He began working for DC again with the launch of the &quot;Justice League Task Force&quot; series in 1993 with artist Sal Velluto. In 1994, Michelinie became the writer of &quot;Action Comics&quot; which he stayed on for three years. As one of the five principal Superman writers at that time he co-wrote &quot;&quot; in 1996. David Michelinie and artist Paul Ryan are the only comic book creators to have contributed to the wedding issues of both Spider-Man (Peter Parker marrying Mary Jane Watson in &quot;The Amazing Spider-Man Annual&quot; #21, 1987) and Superman (Clark Kent) marrying Lois Lane in &quot;&quot; (Dec. 1996). He also wrote issues of &quot;Superman Adventures&quot; and &quot;Steel&quot; as well as the miniseries &quot;Legion: Science Police&quot;, &quot;Superman&#x27;s Nemesis: Lex Luthor&quot; and &quot;Superman vs. Predator&quot;, his last credited work for DC Comics in 2000. The same year, he joined forces with Bob Layton again for the miniseries &quot;Iron Man: Bad Blood&quot; for Marvel Comics.

After a hiatus Michelinie returned to comics by teaming-up with Bob Layton and Dick Giordano to form Future Comics, where he wrote the series &quot;Freemind&quot;, &quot;Metallix&quot; and &quot;Deathmask&quot; from 2002 to 2003. The company closed in 2004.

==Later career==
In 2007, Michelinie wrote &quot; Tales: The Frankenstein Agenda&quot; #1–3 for Moonstone Books. Also for Moonstone, he wrote several prose short stories which appeared in the anthologies &quot;The Phantom&quot; &quot;Chronicles&quot; (2007), &quot;Werewolves: Dead Moon Rising&quot; (2007) and &quot;The Avenger: The Justice Inc. Files&quot; (2011).

In 2008, he and Layton collaborated again on a four-issue &quot;Iron Man: Legacy of Doom&quot; miniseries and in 2009 on the one-shot &quot;Iron Man: The End&quot; for Marvel Comics. It was followed by the one-shot &quot;What If? Iron Man: Demon in an Armor&quot; in 2011 and a four-issue-follow-up on the &quot;Armor Wars&quot; storyline published as &quot;Iron Man&quot; #258.1–258.4 in 2013. He returned to his creation Venom with stories for &quot;Venom&quot; #150 (2017), &quot;Venom Annual&quot; #1 (2018) and &quot;Venom&quot; vol. 4 #25 (2020), all penciled by Ron Lim, who had also worked on &quot;Venom: Lethal Protector&quot;. After the success of the two &quot;Venom&quot; films, in 2021 Marvel commissioned Michelinie to write a new five-issue-miniseries: &quot;Venom: Lethal Protector&quot; vol. 2, with art by Ivan Fiorelli, that was published in 2023. It was followed by &quot;Venom: Separation Anxiety&quot;, another limited series, drawn by Gerardo Sandoval in 2024.

== Screenwriting ==
As screenwriter, Michelinie worked on two episodes of the animated series &quot;Iron Man: Armored Adventures&quot; (with Bob Layton as co-writer) and wrote the short films &quot;Hellevator&quot; (2011) and &quot;Nobody&#x27;s Tomorrow&quot; (2018).

<text>The Apostolic Christian Church (ACC) is a worldwide Christian denomination from the Anabaptist tradition that practices credobaptism, closed communion, greeting other believers with a holy kiss, a capella worship in some branches (in others, singing is with piano), and the headcovering of women during services. The Apostolic Christian Church ordains only men, who are authorized to administer baptism, the Lord&#x27;s Supper, and the laying on of hands.

==History==
The origins of the Apostolic Christian Church are found in the conversion experience of Samuel Heinrich Froehlich (1803–57) of Switzerland. Froehlich was baptized in 1832 and soon founded the &quot;Evangelical Baptist Church.&quot; The first American church was formed in Lewis County, New York, in 1847 by Benedict Weyeneth (1819–87), who had been sent by Froehlich at the request of Joseph Virkler, a Lewis County minister in an Alsatian Amish-Mennonite church. In 1848 a church was formed in Sardis, Ohio. The church experienced primary growth in the Midwest, where many congregations gained membership from other Anabaptist denominations, chiefly local Amish and Mennonite churches. Though sometimes referred to as the &quot;New Amish&quot;, these believers generally called themselves &quot;Evangelical Baptist&quot;. In 1917, the church adopted a uniform name: &quot;Apostolic Christian Church&quot;.

==Branches==
There are currently at least five main divisions of this church in America. In the early 1900s a disagreement arose over the practice of some European customs (namely, the wearing of a mustache) and the church split into two bodies (from 1901 to 1911). In 1932 a second schism originated from a letter sent by elders in Europe asking for greater adherence to traditional teachings and practices. Those adhering to the request of the letter separated themselves from the Apostolic Christian Church of America and became known as the Christian Apostolic Church (later the German Apostolic Christian Church). The Apostolic Christian Church of America did not retain German language preaching. It is a common misconception that German language preaching was a primary issue in the division.
* The Apostolic Christian Church of America has about 93 congregations in 22 states, including 1 church in Canada, 5 in Mexico, and 2 in Japan. The total number of members is approximately 11,500. This church has a national missionary committee/humanitarian aid program called HarvestCall, eleven retirement communities/nursing homes for the elderly, a home for people with developmental disabilities (Apostolic Christian Timber Ridge) in Morton, Illinois, Apostolic Christian Counseling &amp; Family Services in Morton, IL, and a children&#x27;s home in Leo, Indiana.
* The Apostolic Christian Church (Nazarean) has 32 congregations in the United States, with 2756 members, 11 congregations in Canada with about 850 members, 6 congregations in Australia with roughly 200 members, 16 congregations in Argentina with about 1200 members, one congregation the Republic of Hungary with roughly 1,000–2,000 members as well as congregations in Brazil and Mexico. They have mission work in New Guinea, Argentina, Zambia, and Paraguay. Though the minority of the split, this body remained in fellowship with the European churches. There is also a small congregation of Nazareans in Israel.
* The Nazarene Christian Congregation is the result of a split during World War II which had to do with disagreements in caving to Communist demands in Yugoslavia. This church also split into two sides during the early 2000s. The NCC has churches in former Yugoslavia, Australia, United States, and Canada, with more members in Yugoslavia than anywhere else. In North America and Australia the church has shrunk considerably.
* The German Apostolic Christian Church has several congregations in the United States and Europe. , there are about 135 members in the United States, primarily in Illinois and Oregon, and this is down from 150 in 2017. This German Apostolic Christian Church is the result of a relatively small group splitting away from the Apostolic Christian Church in 1932 and 1933 with currently four congregations: Cissna Park, IL; Fairbury, IL; Peoria, IL; and Silverton, OR. Formerly it had also a congregation in Sabetha, KS, this became one of the Christian Apostolic Churches after 1955. Until 1955 this church was known as Christian Apostolic Church, afterwards it named itself German Apostolic Christian Church. The German language was up to 2020 still used in the forenoon Sunday worship service, but not anymore as the internal group&#x27;s language or mother language. After the death of their last chief elder, Robert Hari, in 2019 they switched to English totally in avt. 2020 and relaxed some rules in regard of visitations and fellowship with non-member families. German school in the evening once per week also stopped since. 
* The Christian Apostolic Church (formed in 1955 from a split with the German Apostolic Christian) has five churches in Bluffton, IN; Creston, OH; Forrest, IL; Salem, OR; and Sabetha, KS with approximately 100 members. A unification on the weekend of 4 July 2021 resulted in the addition of the Indiana and Ohio churches. Quite a number of other Christian Apostolic groups existed for a while beside this bigger group, some still do today as home gatherings. This new group retained its old church name in opposition to its mother group. Members have retained traditional teachings on divorce and remarriage, sins unto death, baptism, the head covering, voting, birth control, and higher education, whereas the Apostolic Christian Church of America and Apostolic Christian Church (Nazarean) have departed somewhat from earlier practice in these areas.
* The Apostolic Christian Faith Church (formed in 2012 from a split with the Apostolic Christian Church of America) has two churches in Canada, and about 25 churches in the United States with approximately 1,100 members. Members have retained what they believe are the church&#x27;s traditional teachings and doctrine. Their manner of worship and fellowship is currently very similar to the church they withdrew from. However, they reject the New Evangelical thinking that they believe has influenced a portion of the Apostolic Christian Church of America.

===Other divisions and smaller groups===

The European German language bodies (Neutäufer) have also faced divisions. Although once united throughout Germany, Austria and Switzerland, there are now four sides. The following two (one could say also three) sides belong to the beard (moustache)-accepting side:
* During the 1980s members and leaders were pushing for more liberties, which resulted in a vast majority of churches changing their doctrine and rules to more evangelical/free church standards. Reasons were also, that the church leaders saw no future in keeping the old ways. They formed their own branch (&quot;Bund Evangelischer Täufergemeinden&quot;) and adopted the name &quot;Evangelische Täufergemeinde&quot; for most congregations. They currently have churches in Germany, Switzerland, Austria and France (Alsace) and quote to have about 2500 members.
* The small fraction that did not join and emphasized more traditional/conservative standards call themselves &quot;Gemeinde Evangelisch Taufgesinnter (Nazarener)&quot; with churches in Germany and Austria and formerly about 400 members. 
* Some of these German Nazarener congregations do not fellowship with each other, so one could speak of two sides: moderate/liberal minded Nazarener congregations and conservative/traditional minded ones. Both sides are partly in a process to dissolve. The conservative Nazarener congregations maintain strong ties with the rest of the Nazarene congregations, especially to the Balkan states and are led by the Breidenbach congregation.
* There are some congregations of German Apostolic Christians in Germany and in Switzerland since the beginnings of 20th century: 
** Three in Germany which call themselves &quot;Gemeinschaft evangelisch Taufgesinnter-Altmennoniten&quot; plus one close to Basel, Switzerland, which is a dependence of the Swiss Basel congregation. 
** Ten (or eleven if one takes Kandergrund-Steffisburg as two congregations) in Switzerland, one thereof is in the Emmental at Bärau/Langnau. The Swiss German Apostolics have over 200–250 members, the German ones under 100. There have been official affiliations with the American side up to 2011. These congregations are the remnants of the beard-refusing-side in Europe. Formerly they had been the majority of all Neutäufer congregations in Switzerland and Germany, but their membership shrank immensely during the last decades.

The remainder of Europe is made up of independent congregations in communion:
* &quot;Nazarenes&quot; – in Sweden, Hungary, Serbia, Croatia, Romania, Ukraine and Slovakia
** In Hungary their official name is &quot;&quot; (Congregation of Nazarenes Believing in Christ)

==Conversion==
The conversion experienced by each member varies in timing and detail, but all include repentance for one&#x27;s sins, making restitution, confessing sins to God while in the presence of an elder of the church, and finding peace with God. The word &quot;convert&quot; is used throughout the denomination to describe anyone who begins repentance but has not been baptized into the church; it does not imply conversion from another denomination or religion, but from the carnal to the spiritual state. Once converts &quot;receive peace from God,&quot; this is announced to the church and a baptism date is set. Converts give a testimony before the members of the church prior to the public baptism service, telling the story of their personal conversion experience. This testimony, commonly referred to as a &quot;proving&quot;, typically takes place the night before the baptism and is a closed member meeting. Because baptism is identified with a &quot;death to sin&quot; in Romans 6 and other New Testament writings, congregational recognition of the convert&#x27;s repentance and death to sin is desired prior to baptism. The baptism service is open for anyone to attend and is performed before the entire congregation. Before the baptism takes place, the convert makes a covenant with Christ in the presence of the entire congregation. Once the covenant is made, the convert is fully immersed in water (unless they are physically unable to do so). After the baptism service, there is a laying on of hands by one or more elders and an accompanying consecration prayer. This laying on of hands and prayer of consecration places the seal of the Holy Spirit on the life of the newly baptized. In some of the branches, such as the Nazarene branch, this service is for members and converts only.

==Worship, biblical practices and tradition==
===Doctrine===
===Worship===
*In general, the Authorized Version (King James Version) of the Bible is the English translation used for church services in North American congregations. Some congregations use the corresponding translation in another language, such as Spanish (RVR 1960), Romanian, or Hungarian.
*Worship services are held on Sunday while various churches also conduct additional mid-week services.
*Sunday services in the ACCA (the Nazarean order of services) are similar in a few churches but widely vary in others, the order of worship in the Christian Apostolic Church and German Apostolic Christian Church are essentially identical—this is basically the same order of worship used in old order German Baptist, Mennonite and Amish churches as follows:
**Public worship services in the morning and afternoon, usually of the following format:
***The congregation sings several songs before the service starts
***The congregation prays together in silence asking for the Holy Spirit&#x27;s leadership
***A minister opens to a random Old Testament passage, and sometimes discusses it briefly
***The minister selects a hymn to be sung by the congregation, the congregation sings, and then the minister prays out loud
***The minister opens to a random passage in the New Testament – this passage serves as the basis of most of the sermon, although the Old Testament passage (or fore-reading) is often referred to as well. This minister will preach for the majority of the sermon.
***A second minister provides some closing or summarizing thoughts and either selects a closing hymn or asks the congregation to suggest one
***A minister gives the opportunity for a male member of the congregation to lead the group in prayer
***A minister &quot;takes greetings&quot;. Members stand up and announce other AC churches that they have recently traveled to or are traveling from
***A final hymn is sometimes sung following the afternoon service.
**A light meal is generally served between the morning and afternoon services
*Midweek services consist of a single service, generally of the same format as the Sunday services
*Some congregations conduct Bible studies and classes as part of the routine church schedule. In addition, some local fellowships have outside study groups and classes among members. However, there is no standard format for these bible studies across all churches. Some congregations do not encourage Bible studies among groups of members. Personal Bible study is always encouraged and expected.
*Female members are expected to wear a Christian headcovering during prayer and worship. Wearing of a head covering when praying outside of church, when with other believers, and at other times is encouraged to varying degrees among the congregations, but the Biblical basis is somewhat universally recognized. Not every Apostolic Christian Church practices the women&#x27;s headcovering; however, it is seen in most.
*Within the Apostolic Christian Churches (Nazarean), singing usually includes piano playing, and (on occasion) includes other instruments.
*The &quot;Zionsharfe&quot; (&quot;Zion&#x27;s Harp&quot;) is the primary hymnal used during worship services. The &quot;Zion&#x27;s Harp&quot; was assembled in the 19th century by a European elder, George Michael Mangold, and includes numerous hymns written by him, along with other hymns not generally used in other American denominations. Most of the hymns are either traditional Amish/Mennonite hymns or from the 19th-century Swiss state church. It is a good source for English metrical translations of Amish Ausbund hymns. Because the Apostolic Christian Church of America and the Apostolic Christian Church (Nazarene) were separated before both sides began using English in worship services, the &quot;Zion&#x27;s Harps&quot; used by the two denominations have lyrics somewhat differently translated from the German. When the ACCA revised their Zions Harp in the 50&#x27;s, many of the ACCN Verses were added because the original translators only translated the first 3 verses on many of the songs. A slightly different translation is also used in the Christian Apostolic Church.
*Another hymnal used in church services, the &quot;Hymns of Zion&quot;, includes arrangements and lyrics more commonly used in other denominations, but also includes several written by members of the American congregations. This hymnal was created as a combination of other hymnals previously used in the ACCA Churches, The &quot;Heft&quot;(Long Book)(which is included in the ACCN&#x27;s Zion&#x27;s Harp), and &quot;Songs of Praise and Worship&quot;. These books were selections of classic, and modern Hymns at their time of publishing. The &quot;Hymns of Zion&quot; was published around 20 years after &quot;Songs of Praise and Worship&quot; to combine the two. This step merged the current Sunday School and Sanctuary secondary hymnal into one, while adding new songs that had become popular in the 20 years between the two books publications. Starting around 2002, many ACCA churches have transitioned from the &quot;Hymns of Zion&quot; to the new &quot;combined hymnal&quot; which is a combination of the &quot;Hymns of Zion&quot; and the &quot;Tabernacle Hymns.&quot; The latter was used by several churches, and the combination served to keep the church united while keeping both sets of hymns in use. Some churches still use the &quot;Gospel Hymns&quot;, or &quot;Heavenly Highways&quot; in the sanctuary, but most use them as Fellowship Hall books. 
* In 2023 the ACCA published a new hymnal, the &quot;Hymns of Worship&quot; that includes selections from the time the &quot;Hymns of Zion&quot; was published to today, along with some classic hymns from the &quot;Gospel Hymns&quot; and &quot;Heavenly Highways&quot; that were not included in the &quot;Hymns of Zion&quot;. This Hymnal is in Sanctuary use by several ACCA churches, others are using it for singing in the home only, and others due to the contemporary style music and biblical inaccuracy of some of the songs are not using it at all.

===Biblical practices and tradition===
*Communion is served once (to several times) a year at varying times, usually near Easter or near to a Baptism. Communion services are a closed service, with only members and converts present. Communion is typically preceded by a period, typically around a month, of self-examination and restitution, if needed.
*The Holy Kiss is the greeting used in Apostolic Christian churches (practiced as in German Baptist, Amish, Mennonite churches, and other Anabaptist churches), based on the epistles of Paul and the general epistle of 1 Peter. Men greet men and women greet women. Men and women just shake hands and say &quot;Greetings Brother&quot; and &quot;Greetings Sister.&quot;
*Marriage between &quot;a man and a woman of like mind, faith, and fellowship&quot; is encouraged for all members where God leads. In the Apostolic Christian Church of America, Christian Apostolic Church, German Apostolic Christian Church, and the Apostolic Christian Church (Nazarean), dating is discouraged.
*Members of the Apostolic Christian Church of America, and Apostolic Christian Church [Nazarean], are somewhat discouraged from visiting churches of other denominations. In the German Apostolic Christian Church, visitors are requested to obtain an elder&#x27;s permission before attending services, and members do not visit other services, even for wedding or funerals.
*In all traditional AC groups, permanent lifelong excommunication is practiced in certain cases.
*In 1932 all Apostolic Christian groups required a beard without mustache (except the Nazareans), but by the 1950s it was discouraged in all groups. In 2017, The ACCA elder body rescinded the expectation that male members be clean-shaven.
*In the ACCA and ACC Nazarean, members are encouraged to wear modest attire that provides gender distinction.

==Leadership==
The all-male leadership of an Apostolic Christian church consists of the &quot;elders&quot; of local congregations. The term &quot;elder&quot; has a somewhat different meaning from that in other denominations. Most congregations have one elder, however some have none and in rare instances a congregation may have more than one. The office of elder is seen as equivalent to that of a bishop as described in the epistles of 1 Timothy and Titus. The elder of each congregation has the oversight of the local congregation but is subject to the authority of the other elders throughout the denomination. Once put in place, Ministers, Deacons and Elders can only be removed of their position by death, voluntary retirement or in extreme cases by the national elder body.

===Elders===
*Elders of local congregations are ordained by the Elders of the other congregations, usually after a ballot is taken from the local congregation. Elders are usually selected from the current ministers serving in the local church. Elders perform both religious rites and also conduct ministerial duties.
*Congregations who do not have a locally residing elder are assigned a &quot;Counseling Elder&quot; by the national elder body. Day-to-day business in these congregations is usually handled by an Ordained Deacon, Deacon or &quot;Lead Minister&quot;; depending on the specific situation of each congregation.
*Each local church Elder serves as an equal member within the collective &quot;Elder Body&quot; of all elders who make decisions regarding the denomination.

===Deacons and ministers===
*Ministers&#x27; duties include both preaching and teaching in their home congregation and in other Apostolic Christian congregations. They also assist the Elder or Deacon as the need arises in their home congregation.
*Ministers (including elders and deacons) do not pursue seminary or other education in preparation for the ministry and serve without compensation. An unpaid lay ministry is not considered a doctrinal issue, but a preference for it is recognized in Paul&#x27;s writings.
*A minister who is ordained as a deacon may assist the local elder with meeting with new converts, performing baptisms, and other duties usually carried out by the elder alone. Most congregations do not have a Deacon, rather they are ordained mostly in very large congregations where the elder needs assistance, or in very small congregations where there is no local elder.

==Footnotes==
* &quot;Froehlich&quot; is for all intents and purposes an anglicization of &quot;Fröhlich&quot;, although use of &quot;oe&quot; (or a similar digraph with a smaller &quot;e&quot; atop the &quot;o&quot;) to denote the same sound actually predates the use of the umlaut in written German.

<text>Rock &amp; Roll Machine (also Rock &#x27;N&#x27; Roll Machine) is the second studio album by Canadian hard rock band Triumph. It was first released in 1977 by Attic Records. The album contained in the band&#x27;s first hit, a version of Joe Walsh&#x27;s &quot;Rocky Mountain Way&quot;. 

A different &quot;international&quot; version of the album was released on RCA Records in the United States and other countries in 1978. This edition replaces some tracks from the original Canadian version with tracks from the self-titled debut &quot;Triumph&quot; (1976) album, along with new artwork. 

The album was released for a second time in Canada, with a different cover than the original one or the international one, using the re-sequenced tracks from the international version. The international version was re-issued in the US on MCA Records in 1985.

The song &quot;The City: War March / El Duende Agonizante / Minstrel&#x27;s Lament&quot; includes a rearrangement of Mars, &quot;the Bringer of War&quot; from Gustav Holst&#x27;s The Planets.

<doc id="368227" wikidata="Q82412" url="?curid=368227" title="Epicyclic gearing">
<text>An epicyclic gear train (also known as a planetary gearset) is a gear reduction assembly consisting of two gears mounted so that the center of one gear (the &quot;planet&quot;) revolves around the center of the other (the &quot;sun&quot;). A carrier connects the centers of the two gears and rotates, to carry the planet gear(s) around the sun gear. The planet and sun gears mesh so that their pitch circles roll without slip. If the sun gear is held fixed, then a point on the pitch circle of the planet gear traces an epicycloid curve.

An epicyclic gear train can be assembled so the planet gear rolls on the inside of the pitch circle of an outer gear ring, or ring gear, sometimes called an &quot;annulus gear&quot;. Such an assembly of a planet engaging both a sun gear and a ring gear is called a planetary gear train. By choosing to hold one component or anotherthe planetary carrier, the ring gear, or the sun gearstationary, three different gear ratios can be realized.

==Overview==

&quot;Epicyclic gearing&quot; or &quot;planetary gearing&quot; is a gear system consisting of one or more outer, or &quot;planet&quot;, gears or pinions, revolving about a central &quot;sun gear&quot; or &quot;sun wheel&quot;. Typically, the planet gears are mounted on a movable arm or &quot;carrier&quot;, which itself may rotate relative to the sun gear. Epicyclic gearing systems also incorporate the use of an outer &quot;ring&quot; gear or &quot;annulus&quot;, which meshes with the planet gears. Planetary gears (or epicyclic gears) are typically classified as simple or compound planetary gears. Simple planetary gears have one sun, one ring, one carrier, and one planet set. Compound planetary gears involve one or more of the following three types of structures: meshed-planet (there are at least two more planets in mesh with each other in each planet train), stepped-planet (there exists a shaft connection between two planets in each planet
train), and multi-stage structures (the system contains two or more planet sets). Compared to simple planetary gears, compound planetary gears have the advantages of larger reduction ratio, higher torque-to-weight ratio, and more flexible configurations.

The axes of all gears are usually parallel, but for special cases like pencil sharpeners and differentials, they can be placed at an angle, introducing elements of bevel gear (see below). Further, the sun, planet carrier and ring axes are usually coaxial.

Epicyclic gearing is also available which consists of a sun, a carrier, and two planets which mesh with each other. One planet meshes with the sun gear, while the second planet meshes with the ring gear. For this case, when the carrier is fixed, the ring gear rotates in the same direction as the sun gear, thus providing a reversal in direction compared to standard epicyclic gearing.

==History==
Around 500 BC, the Greeks invented the idea of epicycles, of circles travelling on the circular orbits. With this theory Claudius Ptolemy in the &quot;Almagest&quot; in 148 AD was able to approximate planetary paths observed crossing the sky. The Antikythera Mechanism, circa 80 BC, had gearing which was able to closely match the Moon&#x27;s elliptical path through the heavens, and even to correct for the nine-year precession of that path. (The Greeks interpreted the motion they saw, not as elliptical, but rather as epicyclic motion.)

In the 2nd century AD treatise &quot;The Mathematical Syntaxis&quot; (a.k.a. &quot;Almagest&quot;), Claudius Ptolemy used rotating deferent and epicycles that form epicyclic gear trains to predict the motions of the planets. Accurate predictions of the movement of the Sun, Moon, and the five planets, Mercury, Venus, Mars, Jupiter, and Saturn, across the sky assumed that each followed a trajectory traced by a point on the planet gear of an epicyclic gear train. This curve is called an epitrochoid.

Epicyclic gearing was used in the Antikythera Mechanism, circa 80 BC, to adjust the displayed position of the Moon for the ellipticity of its orbit, and even for its orbital apsidal precession. Two facing gears were rotated around slightly different centers; one drove the other, not with meshed teeth but with a pin inserted into a slot on the second. As the slot drove the second gear, the radius of driving would change, thus invoking a speeding up and slowing down of the driven gear in each revolution.

Richard of Wallingford, an English abbot of St. Albans monastery, later described epicyclic gearing for an astronomical clock in the 14th century. In 1588, Italian military engineer Agostino Ramelli invented the bookwheel, a vertically revolving bookstand containing epicyclic gearing with two levels of planetary gears to maintain proper orientation of the books.

French mathematician and engineer Desargues designed and constructed the first mill with epicycloidal teeth .

== Requirements for non-interference ==
In order that the planet gear teeth mesh properly with both the sun and ring gears, assuming formula_1 equally spaced planet gears, the following equation must be satisfied:

:formula_2

where

formula_3 are the number of teeth of the &quot;sun gear&quot; and the &quot;ring gear&quot;, respectively and

formula_4 is the number of planet gears in the assembly and

formula_5 is a whole number

If one is to create an asymmetric carrier frame with non-equiangular planet gears, say to create some kind of mechanical vibration in the system, one must make the teething such that the above equation complies with the &quot;imaginary gears&quot;. For example, in the case where a carrier frame is intended to contain planet gears spaced 0°, 50°, 120°, and 230°, one is to calculate as if there are actually 36 planetary gears (10° equiangular), rather than the four real ones.

== Gear speed ratios of conventional epicyclic gearing ==
The gear ratio of an epicyclic gearing system is somewhat non-intuitive, particularly because there are several ways in which an input rotation can be converted into an output rotation. The four basic components of the epicyclic gear are:

* Sun gear: The central gear
* Carrier frame: Holds one or more &quot;planetary&quot; gear(s) symmetrically and separated, all meshed with the sun gear
* Planet gear(s): Usually two to four peripheral gears, all of the same size, that mesh between the &quot;sun gear&quot; and the &quot;ring gear&quot;
* Ring gear, Moon gear, Annulus gear, or Annular gear: An outer ring with inward-facing teeth that mesh with the planetary gear(s)

The overall gear ratio of a simple planetary gearset can be calculated using the following two equations, representing the sun-planet and planet-ring interactions respectively:

: formula_6

where

: formula_7 are the angular velocities of the &quot;ring gear&quot;, &quot;sun gear&quot;, &quot;planetary gears&quot;, and &quot;carrier frame&quot; respectively, and formula_8 are the number of teeth of the &quot;ring gear&quot;, the &quot;sun gear&quot;, and each &quot;planet gear&quot; respectively.

from which we can derive the following:

: formula_9

: formula_10

: formula_11

: formula_12

and

: formula_13

only if formula_14
In many epicyclic gearing systems, one of these three basic components is held stationary (hence set formula_15 for whichever gear is stationary); one of the two remaining components is an &quot;input&quot;, providing power to the system, while the last component is an &quot;output&quot;, receiving power from the system. The ratio of input rotation to output rotation is dependent upon the number of teeth in each of the gears, and upon which component is held stationary.

Alternatively, in the special case where the number of teeth on each gear meets the relationship formula_16 the equation can be re-written as the following:

: formula_17

where

: formula_18 is the sun-to-planet gear ratio.

These relationships can be used to analyze any epicyclic system, including those, such as hybrid vehicle transmissions, where two of the components are used as &quot;inputs&quot; with the third providing &quot;output&quot; relative to the two inputs.

In one arrangement, the planetary carrier (green in the diagram above) is held stationary, and the sun gear (yellow) is used as input. In that case, the planetary gears simply rotate about their own axes (i.e., spin) at a rate determined by the number of teeth in each gear. If the sun gear has formula_19 teeth, and each planet gear has formula_20 teeth, then the ratio is equal to formula_21 For instance, if the sun gear has 24 teeth, and each planet has 16 teeth, then the ratio is , or ; this means that one clockwise turn of the sun gear produces 1.5 &quot;counterclockwise&quot; turns of each of the planet gear(s) about its axis.

Rotation of the planet gears can in turn drive the ring gear (not depicted in diagram), at a speed corresponding to the gear ratios: If the ring gear has formula_22 teeth, then the ring will rotate by formula_23 turns for each turn of the planetary gears. For instance, if the ring gear has 64 teeth, and the planets 16 teeth, one clockwise turn of a planet gear results in , or clockwise turns of the ring gear. Extending this case from the one above:

* One turn of the sun gear results in formula_24 turns of the planets
* One turn of a planet gear results in formula_25 turns of the ring gear

So, with the planetary carrier locked, one turn of the sun gear results in formula_26 turns of the ring gear.

The ring gear may also be held fixed, with input provided to the planetary gear carrier; output rotation is then produced from the sun gear. This configuration will produce an increase in gear ratio, equal to formula_27

If the ring gear is held stationary and the sun gear is used as the input, the planet carrier will be the output. The gear ratio in this case will be formula_28 which may also be written as formula_29 This is the lowest gear ratio attainable with an epicyclic gear train. This type of gearing is sometimes used in tractors and construction equipment to provide high torque to the drive wheels.

In bicycle hub gears, the sun is usually stationary, being keyed to the axle or even machined directly onto it. The planetary gear carrier is used as input. In this case the gear ratio is simply given by formula_30 The number of teeth in the planet gear is irrelevant.

== Accelerations of standard epicyclic gearing ==

From the above formulae, we can also derive the accelerations of the sun, ring and carrier, which are:

: formula_31

: formula_32

: formula_33

== Torque ratios of standard epicyclic gearing ==
In epicyclic gears, two speeds must be known in order to determine the third speed. However, in a steady state condition, only one torque must be known in order to determine the other two torques. The equations which determine torque are:
&lt;br&gt;
: formula_34
: formula_35
: formula_36
: formula_37
: formula_38
: formula_39
&lt;br&gt; where: formula_40 — Torque of ring (annulus), formula_41 — Torque of sun, formula_42— Torque of carrier. For all three, these are the torques applied to the mechanism (input torques). Output torques have the reverse sign of input torques. These torque ratios can be derived using the law of conservation of energy. Applied to a single stage this equation is expressed as:
&lt;br&gt;
: formula_43
In the cases where gears are accelerating, or to account for friction, these equations must be modified.

==Fixed carrier train ratio==
A convenient approach to determine the various speed ratios available in a planetary gear train begins by considering the speed ratio of the gear train when the carrier is held fixed. This is known as the fixed carrier train ratio.

In the case of a simple planetary gear train formed by a carrier supporting a planet gear engaged with a sun and ring gear, the fixed carrier train ratio is computed as the speed ratio of the gear train formed by the sun, planet and ring gears on the fixed carrier. This is given by

: formula_44

In this calculation the planet gear is an idler gear.

The fundamental formula of the planetary gear train with a rotating carrier is obtained by recognizing that this formula remains true if the angular velocities of the sun, planet and ring gears are computed relative to the carrier angular velocity. This becomes,
:formula_45

This formula provides a simple way to determine the speed ratios for the simple planetary gear train under different conditions:

1. The carrier is held fixed, ωc=0, 
::formula_46
2. The ring gear is held fixed, ωr=0, 
::formula_47
3. The sun gear is held fixed, ωs=0, 
::formula_48

Each of the speed ratios available to a simple planetary gear train can be obtained by using band brakes to hold and release the carrier, sun or ring gears as needed. This provides the basic structure for an automatic transmission.

===Spur gear differential===

A spur gear differential is constructed from two identical coaxial epicyclic gear trains assembled with a single carrier such that their planet gears are engaged. This forms a planetary gear train with a fixed carrier train ratio &quot;R&quot; = −1.

In this case, the fundamental formula for the planetary gear train yields,

:formula_49

or

:formula_50
Thus, the angular velocity of the carrier of a spur gear differential is the average of the angular velocities of the sun and ring gears.

In discussing the spur gear differential, the use of the term &quot;ring gear&quot; is a convenient way to distinguish the sun gears of the two epicyclic gear trains. Ring gears are normally fixed in most applications as this arrangement will have a good reduction capacity. The second sun gear serves the same purpose as the ring gear of a simple planetary gear train but clearly does not have the internal gear mate that is typical of a ring gear.

== Gear ratio of reversed epicyclic gearing ==

Some epicyclic gear trains employ two planetary gears which mesh with each other. One of these planets meshes with the sun gear, the other planet meshes with the ring gear. This results in different ratios being generated by the planetary and also causes the sun gear to rotate in the same direction as the ring gear when the planet carrier is the stationary. The fundamental equation becomes:

: formula_51

where formula_52

which results in:

: formula_53 when the carrier is locked,

: formula_54 when the sun is locked,

: formula_55 when the ring gear is locked.

==Compound planetary gears==

&quot;Compound planetary gear&quot; is a general concept and it refers to any planetary gears involving one or more of the following three types of structures: &quot;meshed-planet&quot; (there are at least two or more planets in mesh with each other in each planet train), &quot;stepped-planet&quot; (there exists a shaft connection between two planets in each planet train), and &quot;multi-stage structures&quot; (the system contains two or more planet sets).

Some designs use &quot;stepped-planet&quot; which have two differently-sized gears on either end of a common shaft. The small end engages the sun, while the large end engages the ring gear. This may be necessary to achieve smaller step changes in gear ratio when the overall package size is limited. Compound planets have &quot;timing marks&quot; (or &quot;relative gear mesh phase&quot; in technical term). The assembly conditions of compound planetary gears are more restrictive than simple planetary gears, and they must be assembled in the correct initial orientation relative to each other, or their teeth will not simultaneously engage the sun and ring gear at opposite ends of the planet, leading to very rough running and short life. In 2015, a traction based variant of the &quot;stepped-planet&quot; design was developed at the Delft University of Technology, which relies on compression of the stepped planet elements to achieve torque transmission. The use of traction elements eliminates the need to &quot;timing marks&quot; as well as the restrictive assembly conditions as typically found. Compound planetary gears can easily achieve larger transmission ratio with equal or smaller volume. For example, compound planets with teeth in a 2:1 ratio with a 50T ring gear would give the same effect as a 100T ring gear, but with half the actual diameter.

More planet and sun gear units can be placed in series in the same housing (where the output shaft of the first stage becomes the input shaft of the next stage) providing a larger (or smaller) gear ratio. This is the way most automatic transmissions work. In some cases multiple stages may even share the same ring gear which can be extended down the length of the transmission, or even be a structural part of the casing of smaller gearboxes.

During World War II, a special variation of epicyclic gearing was developed for portable radar gear, where a very high reduction ratio in a small package was needed. This had two outer ring gears, each half the thickness of the other gears. One of these two ring gears was held fixed and had one tooth fewer than did the other. Therefore, several turns of the &quot;sun&quot; gear made the &quot;planet&quot; gears complete a single revolution, which in turn made the rotating ring gear rotate by a single tooth like a cycloidal drive.

== Power splitting ==

More than one member of a system can serve as an output. As an example, the input is connected to the ring gear, the sun gear is connected to the output and the planet carrier is connected to the output through a torque converter. Idler gears are used between sun gear and the planets to cause the sun gear to rotate in the same direction as the ring gear when the planet carrier is stationary. At low input speed, because of the load on the output, the sun will be stationary and the planet carrier will rotate in the direction of the ring gear. Given a high enough load, the turbine of the torque converter will remain stationary, the energy will be dissipated and the torque converter pump will slip. If the input speed is increased to overcome the load the converter turbine will turn the output shaft. Because the torque converter itself is a load on the planet carrier, a force will be exerted on the sun gear. Both the planet carrier and the sun gear extract energy from the system and apply it to the output shaft.

== Advantages ==

Planetary gear trains provide high power density in comparison to standard parallel axis gear trains. They provide a reduction in volume, multiple kinematic combinations, purely torsional reactions, and coaxial shafting. Disadvantages include high bearing loads, constant lubrication requirements, inaccessibility, and design complexity.

The efficiency loss in a planetary gear train is typically about 3% per stage. This type of efficiency ensures that a high proportion (about 97%) of the energy being input is transmitted through the gearbox, rather than being wasted on mechanical losses inside the gearbox.

The load in a planetary gear train is shared among multiple planets; therefore, torque capability is greatly increased. The more planets in the system, the greater the load ability and the higher the torque density.

The planetary gear train also provides stability due to an even distribution of mass and increased rotational stiffness. Torque applied radially onto the gears of a planetary gear train is transferred radially by the gear, without lateral pressure on the gear teeth.

In a typical application, the drive power connects to the sun gear. The sun gear then drives the planetary gears assembled with the external gear ring to operate. The whole set of planetary gear system revolves on its own axis and along the external gear ring where the output shaft connected to the planetary carrier achieves the goal of speed reduction. A higher reduction ratio can be achieved by doubling the multiple staged gears and planetary gears which can operate within the same ring gear.

The method of motion of a planetary gear structure is different from traditional parallel gears. Traditional gears rely on a small number of contact points between two gears to transfer the driving force. In this case, all the loading is concentrated on a few contacting surfaces, making the gears wear quickly and sometimes crack. But the planetary speed reducer has multiple gear contacting surfaces with a larger area that can distribute the loading evenly around the central axis. Multiple gear surfaces share the load, including any instantaneous impact loading, evenly, which makes them more resistant to damage from higher torque. The housing and bearing parts are also less likely to be damaged from high loading as only the planet carrier bearings experience significant lateral force from the transmission of torque, radial forces oppose each other and are balanced, and axial forces only arise when using helical gears.

==3D printing==
Planetary gears have become popular in the maker community, due to their inherent high torque capabilities and compactness/efficiency. Especially within 3D printing, they can be used to rapidly prototype a gear box, to then be manufactured with machining technologies later.

A geared-down motor must turn farther and faster in order to produce the same output movement in the 3D printer which is advantageous if it is not outweighed by the slower movement speed. If the stepper motor has to turn farther then it also has to take more steps to move the printer a given distance; therefore, the geared-down stepper motor has a smaller minimum step-size than the same stepper motor without a gearbox. While down-gearing improves precision in unidirectional motion, it adds backlash to the system and so reduces its absolute positioning accuracy.

Since herringbone gears are easy to 3D print, it has become very popular to 3D print a moving herringbone planetary gear system for teaching children how gears work. An advantage of herringbone gears is that they don&#x27;t fall out of the ring and don&#x27;t need a mounting plate, allowing the moving parts to be clearly seen.

<text>Just a Game is the third studio album by Canadian hard rock band Triumph, released in 1979. The album contains one of Triumph&#x27;s most popular songs on FM album-oriented radio, &quot;Lay it on the Line&quot;, and the Top 40 hit &quot;Hold On&quot;, which peaked at No. 38 on the Billboard Hot 100 and at No. 33 in Canada.

==Artwork==
The vinyl LP version of the album featured a sleeve that folded open to reveal a board game (though later pressings just contained a regular vinyl sleeve without this). According to a &quot;Rockline&quot; interview, the board game was Rik Emmett&#x27;s idea, but Mike Levine was the one who actually designed it and decided to make it impossible to win.

The front cover of the album revealed a futuristic world where every symbol depicts a song featured on the album.

==Critical reception==

&quot;The Globe and Mail&quot; wrote that, &quot;as Rush has become bogged down in a sea of pretention, Triumph has stuck to the basics and honed its heavy-metal drone to a steely edge.&quot;

<text>Te Uru Rākau – New Zealand Forest Service is the agency within the Ministry for Primary Industries that is responsible for the New Zealand forestry sector. It is headquartered in Rotorua.

It was re-established in 2018 after previously existing from 1919 to 1987.

==History==
The New Zealand Forest Service was originally established in 1919 as the State Forest Service. The State Forest Service changed its name to the New Zealand Forest Service in 1949, at about the same time that the Forests Act of 1949 passed through Parliament.

The New Zealand Forest Service was responsible for the management of New Zealand&#x27;s state-owned forests, including forestry, conservation and recreational functions, and was abolished in 1987. The Ministry of Forestry was the government agency responsible for forestry policy until its merger with the Ministry of Agriculture (into the Ministry of Agriculture and Forestry) in 1998. That ministry became part of the Ministry for Primary Industries (MPI) in 2012.

Te Uru Rākau – New Zealand Forest Service was established as a business unit within MPI in May 2018.

== Abolition ==
The New Zealand Forest Service was abolished in 1987.

*Its environmental and conservation functions were taken over by the newly established Department of Conservation. 
*The logging operation and associated land was passed into the Forestry Corporation of New Zealand. 
*The policy advice, biosecurity functions and remaining Crown forests on leased Māori land passed to the Ministry of Agriculture, later merged into the Ministry for Primary Industries. 
*The logging operations and some land was sold, or leased to private logging companies in what were described as Crown Forest licences, under the management of Land Information New Zealand (LINZ). 
* The New Zealand Forest Research Institute remained as a new state-owned institute, later re-branded as Scion (Crown Research Institute)
&quot;Special Areas&quot;
Responsibility for the Crown&#x27;s production forests on the West Coast operation passed onto Timberlands West Coast Limited in 1990.

===Crown Forests===
In 1987 the NZ Forest Service was disbanded and the New Zealand Government began selling Forest assets. The majority of forests were sold between 1990 and 1992, with the SOE Forestry Corporation of New Zealand sold in 1996.

In order to offset against future Waitangi Tribunal Claims the Crown (public/government) retained ownership of the land, and sold a licence to fell the trees to a commercially operated forestry company. These forestry companies operated under what is known as Crown Forest Licences. The Crown Forestry Rental Trust works to 
expedite the settlement of Māori claims against the Crown, which involve or could involve Crown forest licensed lands.

===Recreation provisions in Crown Forest Licences===
Crown licensed forests contain limited recreational access, to reflect the historic public access in New Zealand forests and the continued Crown ownership. It is a commonly held belief in New Zealand that all Crown Forests are open to the public for any recreation. The Crown Forest Licences usually only provide for public access for walkers.

Recreational access may be provided for through Section 7, Public Access Easements or Appendices which set out &quot;Continuing Recreational Use&quot; for organisations (clubs) within the control of the Licensee (and with the ability for the licensee to charge for use). In practice, the licensed tree harvesting companies frequently breach these contracts, and LINZ does little or nothing to enforce the licence conditions on behalf of the public, nor rectify these breaches.

Anyone can obtain a copy of a Crown Forest Licence from LINZ. On each licence, Section 6 sets out the conditions for Public Entry.

===Waiuku Forest===
In 1966, the Crown entered into a 100-year mining licence with New Zealand Steel to extract iron sand. Trees are cleared before mining can start so a large area of the forest is not planted and is unavailable for public access. Once mining is complete over an area, mine tailings are re-spread and the area replanted. One of the last remaining Crown Forests, Waiuku offers a wide range of free recreational opportunities to the Auckland, and Waikato communities.

==Relaunch==

The New Zealand Forest Service was relaunched by the Labour–NZ First Coalition Government as Te Uru Rākau on 11 May 2018.

<text>Riverview (also known as Riverview Park) is a neighbourhood in Ottawa, Ontario, Canada. It is southeast of the downtown adjacent to the Rideau River, its location on which is its namesake. The 2021 Census population of Riverview is 13,113.

==Definition==

As defined by the Riverview Park Community Association, the neighbourhood is bounded on the west by the Rideau River, on the north by the CN railway tracks, on the east by St. Laurent Boulevard, and on the south by Smyth Road. Riverview is located adjacent to Old Ottawa East on the west (across the Rideau River), on the north by Eastway Gardens, on the south by Alta Vista and on the east by Sheffield Glen.

==History==
The area now known as Riverview was mostly farmland belonging to the Township of Gloucester until it was annexed by the city of Ottawa in 1950. During this time, the only settlement was on the northern edge of what is today Riverview, and was the village of Hurdman&#x27;s Bridge. There were also some buildings along River Road (today&#x27;s Riverside Drive) and the CN railway along the Rideau River. The neighbourhood was established in 1952 on a Central Mortgage and Housing Corporation plan. In the 1950s the neighbourhood was primarily built-up to serve the post-war baby boom era. Hurdman&#x27;s Bridge would be eventually demolished to make way for a parkland, rail land, and the new Queensway freeway. Over the next few decades, housing for lower class and lower-middle-class people were also built in the mostly middle-class neighbourhood. This included a large number of apartment buildings lining Riverside Drive, the Alta Vista apartments, community housing on Station Boulevard and on Russell Road. Construction of low-rent housing on Station Boulevard was opposed by many of the community&#x27;s residents, as well as both of the area&#x27;s aldermen. After this stage of development, townhouses were built in various locations of the neighbourhood. More recent developments are mostly middle-class developments, and also for retired people. The post-war housing is very heterogeneous, but newer developments are more homogeneous in character.

==Features==

Riverview is home to a number of hospitals, thanks to its central location. These include the Children&#x27;s Hospital of Eastern Ontario and the Ottawa General Hospital. The Riverside Hospital is also nearby, and the neighbourhood is also home to the National Defence Medical Centre, the Ottawa Rehabilitation Centre and the Perley and Rideau Veteran&#x27;s Health Centre.

Parks in Riverview include Dale Park, Hurdman Park, Balena Park, Riverview Park, Coronation Park and Hutton Park. Many of these are maintained by the Riverview Park Community Association.
Riverview is home to a diversity of schools. There is one French elementary school (Lycée Claudel), a French Catholic High School (Franco Cité), an English alternative education school (Riverview), an English public school (Vincent Massey), and a private Montessori school. There are also five churches, a fire hall, a community centre (Dempsey), two shopping areas, and a number of parks. Riverview is also served by three transitway stations: Hurdman, Lycée Claudel and Smyth. Riverview is home to one of the oldest shopping centres in Ottawa, in the Alta Vista Shopping Centre. Riverview is also home to the St-Laurent-Russell Shopping Centre. The neighbourhood is served by the Dempsey Community Centre and is home to the Ottawa Life Sciences Technology Park. 
The Riverview Park Community Association produced a free monthly newspaper for the neighbourhood, called &quot;Riverviews&quot;. When Riverviews stopped being published in December 2008, the &quot;Riverview Park Review&quot; became the community&#x27;s new independent newspaper.

==Sub neighbourhoods==
Riverside 

The Riverside neighbourhood consists of the area west of the CN Railway. Unlike the rest of Riverview, the area is part of Capital Ward, while the rest of the neighbourhood is in Alta Vista Ward. The Riverside neighbourhood is mostly all apartment buildings or condominiums, except for a few townhouses. The apartment buildings line the old alignment of Riverside Drive which was bypassed in the 1980s. The old alignment of Riverside was bifurcated in the late 2010s by the Hospital Link road, and the northern segment was renamed Lycée Place and the southern segment was renamed Frobisher Lane. The neighbourhood is home to the Lycée Claudel school and borders on the Rideau River.

The Riviera Apartment Complex located north of Riverside Drive next to Hurdman Station is a condominium complex which is home to many of Ottawa&#x27;s upper class. Despite being a gated community, the complex was home to a triple homicide on June 29, 2007. 

The area is home to about 1/3 of all Riverview residents. The population as of the Canada 2011 Census of this area was 4,076. This area is home to a large Arab Canadian population. Of the 4076 inhabitants of this area, 951 people live in the Riviera Condominiums. 

Alta Vista (Riverview West) 
This area of the neighbourhood should not be confused with the Alta Vista neighbourhood to the south. This part of the neighbourhood is located west of Station Boulevard, but does not include it. The central focal point of this area is the Alta Vista Shopping Centre, and it is also home to the Alta Vista Towers. It is home to Riverview Alternative Public School and the Ottawa Montessori School. Mostly built in the 1950s and 1960s, it has one new subdivision off Rolland Avenue. This area is home to Dale Park, which has a tennis facility in the summer and has an outdoor ice rink in the winter. Located adjacent to Riverview School is Riverview Park, which is named for the neighbourhood.

Coronation/Balena
This area is in the central part of the neighbourhood. It is mostly middle class, except for townhouses built in the 1980s. These are located on Pixley and Renova Privates, and on Avalon Place. The rest of the area is made up of post-war housing, except for new developments on the east side of Station Boulevard and along Avalon Place, and on Sonata Place and on the south side of Bathurst Avenue. This region is home to three churches, and two parks; Coronation and Balena Park. Balena has an outdoor swimming pool and a baseball diamond.

Blair Court (Station Boulevard) 

The Blair Court area exists solely on the west side of Station Boulevard, and on Blair Street. It is home of lower-class public housing built in the 1960s and is home to many immigrants and visible minorities.

Riverview East
The eastern part of Riverview is a contrast to the rest of the neighbourhood because of its straight parallel streets. It has access on the west to Balena Park, and has new townhouses on its north side off Coronation Avenue. The Perley and Rideau Veterans&#x27; home is located on the south.

Faircrest Heights (North)
The southwest is the part of Riverview that is home to the majority of all the hospitals and the Medical Centre. It was also home to Rideau Veteran&#x27;s Home until the 1990s when it was demolished. This was the only part of Riverview which existed before 1950. A new subdivision was built after 2000, and the street names have war remembrance themed names like, &quot;Great Oak&quot;, &quot;Valour Drive&quot;, and &quot;Remembrance Cress&quot;. The total population of this area is 1,203. This area is also under the jurisdiction of the Faircrest Heights Community Association.

Ottawa Life Sciences Technology Park
This area was first built up in the 1990s and is located off Smyth Road. The first building was built in the 1990s, but has since expanded. Alta Vista Manor, a retirement home, was built in the early 2000s. The University of Ottawa maintains a small campus here. South of the Park is Franco-Cité, a French language high school.

Elmvale Acres (North)
This area in the southeast of Riverview can also be considered part of Elmvale Acres which is a neighbourhood to the south. It is separated from the rest of Riverview by power lines, and from Elmvale Acres by Smyth Road. Built in the 1950s, it is home to Vincent Massey Public School, Hutton Park and two churches. Across from Russell Road on the east is Dempsey Community Centre, and some apartment buildings.

Russell Heights
&quot;Russell Heights&quot; has significant Arabic (28,185), Chinese (12,735), Spanish (10,850) and Italian (9,440) speaking populations. This part of Riverview is located on the east side of Russell Road. Located north of this subdivision is the run-down St-Laurent-Russell Shopping Centre. St. Laurent Boulevard on the east is home to many commercial establishments and is within view of the National Museum of Science and Technology. Further north along Russell Road and Industrial Avenue is home to many industrial establishments. The total population of this area is 1,083 (2011 census).

<text>Riduan Isamuddin, also known by the &quot;nom de guerre&quot; Hambali (born April 4, 1964), is the former military leader of the Indonesian terrorist organization Jemaah Islamiyah (JI). He is currently in American custody at Guantanamo Bay detainment camp in Cuba. He is currently awaiting trial in a military commission.

Hambali was often described as &quot;the Osama bin Laden of Southeast Asia&quot;. Some media reports describe him as bin Laden&#x27;s lieutenant for Southeast Asian operations. Other reports describe him as an independent peer. He was highly trusted by al-Qaeda and was the main link between the two organisations. Hambali was a close friend of Khalid Sheikh Mohammed, who planned the Bojinka plot and the September 11 attacks. Hambali envisioned creating a Muslim state, in the form of an Islamic superpower (a theocracy) across Southeast Asia, with himself as its leader (Caliph). His ambition was to rule Indonesia, Malaysia, Singapore, Brunei and parts of the Philippines, Myanmar, and Thailand.

He received increasing attention in the aftermath of the 2002 Bali bombings, in which 202 people died.
He was eventually apprehended in a joint operation by the CIA and Thai police in 2003. He is currently imprisoned in Guantanamo Bay detention camp in Cuba, after three years of CIA custody in a secret location.

==Early life==
Riduan Isamuddin was born Encep Nurjaman in the rice belt of Sukamanah, a small village in Cianjur Regency, in the province of West Java, Indonesia. He was the son of a peasant farmer, and was the second of thirteen children. He first became involved with Jemaah Islamiah as a teenager. He was a diligent student at his Islamic high school, Al-Ianah. He travelled to Afghanistan in 1983 to fight the Soviet Union during the Soviet–Afghan War. During his three years as a mujahid, from 1987 to 1990, he met Osama bin Laden. Friends and family in Indonesia say they did not know of his activities overseas.

His name has been transliterated into English text in several different ways over the years, including;
* His name was spelled Hambali, Riduan bin Isomuddin on the Summary of Evidence memo prepared for his Combatant Status Review.
* His name was spelled Ryuduan bin Isomuddin by Scott McClellan during a press briefing. McClellan spelled his name letter by letter.
* His name is spelled Riduan Isamuddin in the report of the 9/11 Commission.
* His name was spelled Nurjaman Riduan Isamuddin by the U.S. Treasury.

==Jemaah Islamiah==

In 1991, Nurjamin returned to Cianjur for one week, before going to Malaysia, where he met the two co-founders of JI, Abdullah Sungkar and Abubakar Bashir. The three lived in a housing compound in Kampung Sungai Manggis, Banting, Selangor. Nurjaman internationalized the terrorist group&#x27;s activities and took on a new name in his permanent residence permit: Riduan Isamuddin. His nickname, &quot;Hambali&quot;, is an allusion to Hanbali, an Islamic school of jurisprudence.

The two co-founders sent their students to &quot;study&quot; in Afghanistan and Pakistan. The students actually fought the Soviets until the Soviets pulled out of Afghanistan. A woman named Noralwizah Lee Abdullah had gone to Malaysia for religious schooling. She secretly married Isamuddin after meeting him at the Luqmanul Hakiem School in Ulu Tiram, Johor. The school was founded by Sungkar and Bashir.

Initially, Isamuddin struggled to make a living for his family. He switched from selling kebabs to patenting medicines. He soon disappeared from his home for weeks at a time, and he received many visitors at home. He eventually came to own a red hatchback and several cell phones. Investigators say that many calls on those cell phones were made to Mohammed Jamal Khalifa, Osama bin Laden&#x27;s brother in law, who had arrived back in Manila, Philippines in 1991.

After Arab visitors gave his family much money, he founded a shell company, Konsojaya, in June 1994. Ostensibly an import-export company trading in palm oil between Malaysia and Afghanistan, it was essentially a front company for terrorism. Wali Khan Amin Shah, who would become the financier of Operation Bojinka, was a director of Konsojaya. The company provided financial assistance to the project until it was discovered by investigators on a laptop computer after an apartment fire on January 6, 1995. Shah was arrested in the Philippines but escaped on a short order. Shah was arrested in Malaysia in December 1995. Both Shah and mastermind Ramzi Yousef, who escaped the Philippines but was arrested in Lahore, Pakistan, were extradited to the United States. They were both convicted and sentenced to life in prison for participating in the project.

==Hambali goes underground==
Hambali&#x27;s company attracted attention of investigators so his dealings went quiet for a while. He decided to preach, raise money, and recruit for his cause. He went underground in 2000 and started a wave of church-bombings in Indonesia. He always had a &quot;hands-on&quot; technique; he met his foot soldiers and came to them &quot;with detailed plans, plenty of cash and two of his own bombmakers.&quot; He always fled before the bombing commenced. Meanwhile, the spiritual leader of Jemaah Islamiah, Abu Bakr Bashir, was preaching jihad at his schools while denying links to Islamic militants.

Hambali planned and attended the January 2000 Al Qaeda Summit in Kuala Lumpur, Malaysia. Among the others present were two 9/11 hijackers, Khalid al-Mihdhar and Nawaf al-Hazmi. This gathering in Kuala Lumpur was observed by the CIA and Malaysian authorities, but what specifically was being said at the meetings was not picked up. Hambali also provided money and documents to Zacarias Moussaoui in October of that year. However claims by Singaporean security analyst Rohan Gunaratna that he had flown to Australia were dismissed by Australian authorities.

After the 2002 Bali bombings, in which 202 people were killed, Hambali received more attention from the United States. In the years leading up to the attack, the Indonesian government&#x27;s action against Islamic militants had been minimal. Following the attack, Abu Bakr Bashir was arrested as part of a crack down on Jemaah Islamiah. He was wanted in Indonesia
for the bombings of several churches in the region, and wanted for the Bali bombings and a failed plot on several targets in Singapore.

==Capture==
Hambali used a series of safe-houses throughout Southeast Asia, especially Thailand and Cambodia, to move around. While he was in Ayutthaya, Thailand, 75 kilometres north of Bangkok, he was planning a terrorist attack against several Thai hotels and the Asia Pacific Economic Cooperation summit (APEC) in Bangkok in October 2003. Hambali had used a false Spanish passport to enter Thailand while his wife used her Malaysian passport.

Thai police found him as part of a joint operation between the Thai police and the CIA on August 11, 2003. The twenty uniformed and undercover police smashed down the door to his one bedroom apartment in Ayutthaya, and arrested him and 33-year-old Noralwizah Lee Abdullah, a Chinese Malaysian who was considered to be his wife. Hambali was wearing a pair of jeans, a T-shirt, a baseball cap, and a pair of sunglasses. Police also seized explosives and firearms in the property. It marked the end of a 20-month hunt for Hambali, who was 37 years of age when he was captured.

According to a 2010 Associated Press report, by March 2004 Hambali was being held at a CIA black site in Rabat, Morocco, and by October of that year he had been transferred to a black site in Bucharest, Romania. On September 6, 2006, President George W. Bush confirmed that Hambali was being held by the CIA and revealed that he had been transferred to Guantanamo Bay. His wife is now in Malaysian custody.

On September 8, 2006, Indonesia formally requested access to Hambali to ensure a fair trial.

Hambali is also wanted in the Philippines for the transfer of explosives on Filipino soil in an attempt to transport them to Singapore.

==Detention, Interrogation and Torture==

Following his capture the USA would not confirm or deny that he was in their custody. But on September 6, 2006, President George W. Bush acknowledged the existence of covert, overseas CIA interrogation centres (colloquially known as black sites) and announced that 14 high-profile members (al Qaeda and other related groups) had been transported from those sites to Guantanamo Bay. Those 14 include Hambali and an alleged lieutenant of his called Mohammed Nazir Bin Lep alias Lillie or Li-Li.

On August 11, 2003, the United States government subjected Hambali to almost three years of isolation, interrogation and torture. Within days of his arrest, he was taken to an undisclosed secret detention facility where he was subject to &quot;enhanced interrogation techniques&quot; (EITs) inflicted by the Central Intelligence Agency (CIA) for approximately three years as part of the notorious Rendition, Detention and Interrogation (RDI) program, which is now commonly known as the &quot;Torture Program.&quot;

But a complete description of his torture as well as the locations in which it occurred remained classified by the United States government. Only limited amounts of information describing his torture have been released - first from the International Committee of the Red Cross Report on the Treatment of Fourteen &#x27;High-Value Detainees&#x27; in CIA Custody dated February 2007 and later by the SSCI Report in 2014.

According to the 2014 Senate Intelligence Committee report, Hambali was told by an interrogator that he would never go to court: &quot;We can never let the world know what I have done to you.&quot;

== Combatant Status Review ==

The Bush administration asserted that: 
the protections of the Geneva Conventions did not extend to captured prisoners who are not members of the regular Afghan armed force nor meet the criteria for prisoner of war for voluntary forces. 
Critics argued the Conventions obliged the U.S. to conduct competent tribunals to determine the status of prisoners. Subsequently, the U.S. Department of Defense instituted Combatant Status Review Tribunals (CSRTs), to determine whether detainees met the new definition of an &quot;enemy combatant&quot;.

&quot;Enemy combatant&quot; was defined by the U.S. Department of Defense as: 
an individual who was part of, or supporting, the Taliban, or al-Qaeda forces, or associated forces that are engaged in hostilities against the United States or its coalition partners. This includes any person who commits a belligerent act or has directly supported hostilities in aid of enemy armed forces.

The CSRTs are not bound by the rules of evidence that would normally apply in civilian court, and the government’s evidence is presumed to be “genuine and accurate.”
From July 2004 through March 2005, CSRTs were convened to determine whether each prisoner had been correctly classified as an &quot;enemy combatant&quot;.

Riduan Isamuddin was among the 60% of prisoners who chose to participate in tribunal hearings. A Summary of Evidence memo was prepared for the tribunal of each detainee, listing the allegations that supported their detention as an &quot;enemy combatant&quot;.

Riduan Isamuddin&#x27;s memo accused him of the following:

The Department of Defense announced on August 9, 2007 that all fourteen of the &quot;high-value detainees&quot; who had been transferred to Guantanamo from the CIA&#x27;s black sites, had been officially classified as &quot;enemy combatants&quot;. Although judges Peter Brownback and Keith J. Allred had ruled two months earlier that only &quot;&quot;illegal&quot; enemy combatants&quot; could face military commissions, the Department of Defense waived the qualifier and said that all fourteen men could now face charges before Guantanamo military commissions.

==Possible transfer to Washington, D.C. for a civilian trial==
According to Xinhua, the state-owned newspaper of the Chinese Communist Party, the Department of Justice was considering transferring Riduan Isamuddin to Washington, D.C. for a civilian trial.

==Joint Review Task Force==

When he assumed office in January 2009, President Barack Obama made a number of promises about the future of Guantanamo.
He promised the use of torture would cease at the camp. He promised to institute a new review system. That new review system was composed of officials from six departments, where the OARDEC reviews were conducted entirely by the Department of Defense. When it reported back, a year later, the Joint Review Task Force classified some individuals as too dangerous to be transferred from Guantanamo, even though there was no evidence to justify laying charges against them. On April 9, 2013, that document was made public after a Freedom of Information Act request.
Riduan Isamuddin was one of the 71 individuals deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release.
Although Obama promised that those deemed too innocent to charge, but too dangerous to release would start to receive reviews from a Periodic Review Board as less than a quarter of men have received a review. Isamuddin was denied approval for transfer on September 19, 2016.

<doc id="368300" wikidata="Q1131786" url="?curid=368300" title="Pulmonary heart disease">
<text>Pulmonary heart disease, also known as cor pulmonale, is the enlargement and failure of the right ventricle of the heart as a response to increased vascular resistance (such as from pulmonic stenosis) or high blood pressure in the lungs.

Chronic pulmonary heart disease usually results in right ventricular hypertrophy (RVH), whereas acute pulmonary heart disease usually results in dilatation. Hypertrophy is an adaptive response to a long-term increase in pressure. Individual muscle cells grow larger (in thickness) and change to drive the increased contractile force required to move the blood against greater resistance. Dilatation is a stretching (in length) of the ventricle in response to acute increased pressure.

To be classified as pulmonary heart disease, the cause must originate in the pulmonary circulation system; RVH due to a systemic defect is not classified as pulmonary heart disease. Two causes are vascular changes as a result of tissue damage (e.g. disease, hypoxic injury), and chronic hypoxic pulmonary vasoconstriction. If left untreated, then death may result. The heart and lungs are intricately related; whenever the heart is affected by a disease, the lungs risk following and vice versa. 

==Signs and symptoms==

The symptoms/signs of pulmonary heart disease (cor pulmonale) can be non-specific and depend on the stage of the disorder, and can include blood backing up into the systemic venous system, including the hepatic vein. As pulmonary heart disease progresses, most individuals will develop symptoms like:
* Shortness of breath
* Wheezing
* Cyanosis
* Ascites
* Jaundice
* Enlargement of the liver
* Raised jugular venous pressure (JVP)
* Third heart sound
* Intercostal recession
* Presence of abnormal heart sounds

==Causes==

The causes of pulmonary heart disease (cor pulmonale) are the following:
* Acute respiratory distress syndrome (ARDS)
* COPD
* Primary pulmonary hypertension
* Blood clots in lungs/Pulmonary embolism
* Kyphoscoliosis
* Interstitial lung disease
* Cystic fibrosis
* Sarcoidosis
* Obstructive sleep apnea (untreated)
* Sickle cell anemia
* Bronchopulmonary dysplasia (in infants)

==Pathophysiology==
The pathophysiology of pulmonary heart disease (cor pulmonale) has always indicated that an increase in right ventricular afterload causes RV failure (pulmonary vasoconstriction, anatomic disruption/pulmonary vascular bed and increased blood viscosity are usually involved), however most of the time, the right ventricle adjusts to an overload in chronic pressure. According to Voelkel, et al., pressure overload is the initial step for changes in RV, other factors include:
* Ischemia
* Inflammation
* Oxidative damage
* Epigenetics
* Abnormal cardiac energetics

==Diagnosis==

Investigations available to determine the cause of cor pulmonale include the following:
* Chest x-ray – right ventricular hypertrophy, right atrial dilatation, prominent pulmonary artery
* ECG – right ventricular hypertrophy, dysrhythmia, P pulmonale (characteristic peaked P wave)
* Thrombophilia screen- to detect chronic venous thromboembolism (proteins C and S, antithrombin III, homocysteine levels)
===Differential diagnosis===
The diagnosis of pulmonary heart disease is not easy as both lung and heart disease can produce similar symptoms. Therefore, the differential diagnosis (DDx) should assess:
* Atrial myxoma
* Congestive heart failure
* Constrictive pericarditis
* Infiltrative cardiomyopathies
* Right heart failure (right ventricular infarction)
* Ventricular septal defect

==Treatment==
The treatment for cor pulmonale can include the following: antibiotics, expectorants, oxygen therapy, diuretics, digitalis, vasodilators, and anticoagulants. Some studies have indicated that Shenmai injection with conventional treatment is safe and effective for cor pulmonale (chronic).

Treatment requires diuretics (to decrease strain on the heart). Oxygen is often required to resolve the shortness of breath. Additionally, oxygen to the lungs also helps relax the blood vessels and eases right heart failure. When wheezing is present, the majority of individuals require a bronchodilator. A variety of medications have been developed to relax the blood vessels in the lung, calcium channel blockers are used but only work in few cases and according to NICE are not recommended for use at all.

Anticoagulants are used when venous thromboembolism is present. Venesection is used in severe secondary polycythemia (because of hypoxia), which improves symptoms though survival rate has not been proven to increase. Finally, transplantation of single/double lung in extreme cases of cor pulmonale is also an option.

==Epidemiology==
The epidemiology of pulmonary heart disease (cor pulmonale) accounts for 7% of all heart disease in the U.S. According to Weitzenblum, et al., the mortality that is related to cor pulmonale is not easy to ascertain, as it is a complication of COPD.

<doc id="368302" wikidata="Q331190" url="?curid=368302" title="Two-barred crossbill">
<text>The two-barred crossbill or white-winged crossbill (Loxia leucoptera) is a small passerine bird in the finch family Fringillidae. It breeds in the coniferous forests of North America and the Palearctic.

==Taxonomy==
The two-barred crossbill was formally described in 1789 by the German naturalist Johann Friedrich Gmelin in his revised and expanded edition of Carl Linnaeus&#x27;s &quot;Systema Naturae&quot;. He placed it with the crossbills in the genus &quot;Loxia&quot; and coined the binomial name &quot;Loxia leucoptera&quot;. Gmelin specified the locality as Hudson Bay and New York. The specific epithet &quot;leucoptera&quot; is from Ancient Greek &quot;leukopteros&quot; meaning &quot;white-winged&quot; (&quot;leukos&quot; means &quot;white&quot; and &quot;pteron&quot; means &quot;wing&quot;). Gmelin based his account on the &quot;white winged crossbill&quot; that had been described in 1783 by the English ornithologist John Latham in his multi-volume work &quot;A General Synopsis of Birds&quot;. Latham had examined a specimen in the Leverian Museum in London.

Two subspecies are recognised:
* &quot;L. l. bifasciata&quot; (Brehm, CL, 1827) – north Europe to east Siberia and northeast China
* &quot;L. l. leucoptera&quot; Gmelin, JF, 1789 – Alaska, Canada and north USA

==Description==
The two-barred crossbill is in length and weighs . It has short legs, a forked tail, a crossed bill and two prominent white wing-bars. The male of the nominate subspecies has forehead, crown, nape and upper-parts bright raspberry-red. The are black or blackish brown with pink edges. The upper tail coverts are black with white fringes. The female lacks the pink and instead has greenish-yellow head and upperparts.

The two-barred is easier to identify than other crossbills, especially in North America, where only the red crossbill (&quot;Loxia curvirostra&quot;) and this species occur. Within its Palearctic range, this species is smaller-headed and smaller-billed than the parrot crossbill and Scottish crossbill, so the main confusion between species both there and in North America is with the red or common crossbill.

The main plumage distinction from the red crossbill is the white wingbars which give this species its English and scientific names. There are also white tips to the tertials. The adult male is also a somewhat brighter (pinker) red than other male crossbills. Some red crossbills occasionally show weak white wingbars, so care is needed with the correct identification of this species. The &quot;chip&quot; call is weaker and higher than that of the red crossbill.

Another crossbill species on Hispaniola in the Caribbean was previously treated as a subspecies (&quot;Loxia leucoptera megaplaga&quot;), but is now treated as a distinct species: the Hispaniolan crossbill (&quot;Loxia megaplaga&quot;). It is associated with the Hispaniolan pine tree (&quot;Pinus occidentalis&quot;), and differs from the two-barred crossbill in darker plumage, a stouter bill, and its geographic isolation compared to other crossbill species.

==Distribution and habitat==
This bird breeds in the coniferous forests of Alaska, Canada, the northernmost United States and across the Palearctic extending into northeast Europe. It nests in conifers, laying 3–5 eggs.

This crossbill is mainly resident, but will irregularly irrupt south if its food source fails. The American race seems to wander more frequently than the Eurosiberian subspecies. This species will form flocks outside the breeding season, often mixed with other crossbills. It is a rare visitor to western Europe, usually arriving with an irruption of red crossbills.

==Behaviour==
===Food and feeding===
They are specialist feeders on conifer cones, and the unusual bill shape is an adaptation to assist the extraction of the seeds from the cone. The two-barred crossbill has a strong preference for larch (&quot;Larix&quot;), in Eurosiberia using Siberian larch (&quot;Larix sibirica&quot;) and Dahurian larch (&quot;L. gmelinii&quot;), and in North America Tamarack larch (&quot;L. laricina&quot;). It will also take rowan (&quot;Sorbus&quot;) berries, and in North America, also eastern hemlock (&quot;Tsuga canadensis&quot;) and white spruce (&quot;Picea glauca&quot;) cones.

===Breeding===

The nest is placed above the ground, usually against the trunk of a conifer. The nest is built by the female and mainly consists of conifer twigs. The clutch of 3–4 eggs is incubated by the female for 14–15 days. The chicks are fed by both parents. They fledge after 22–24 days but then remain with their parents for up to 6 weeks.

<text>The Kepler conjecture, named after the 17th-century mathematician and astronomer Johannes Kepler, is a mathematical theorem about sphere packing in three-dimensional Euclidean space. It states that no arrangement of equally sized spheres filling space has a greater average density than that of the cubic close packing (face-centered cubic) and hexagonal close packing arrangements. The density of these arrangements is around 74.05%.

In 1998, Thomas Hales, following an approach suggested by , announced that he had a proof of the Kepler conjecture. Hales&#x27; proof is a proof by exhaustion involving the checking of many individual cases using complex computer calculations. Referees said that they were &quot;99% certain&quot; of the correctness of Hales&#x27; proof, and the Kepler conjecture was accepted as a theorem. In 2014, the Flyspeck project team, headed by Hales, announced the completion of a formal proof of the Kepler conjecture using a combination of the Isabelle and HOL Light proof assistants. In 2017, the formal proof was accepted by the journal &quot;Forum of Mathematics, Pi&quot;.

==Background==

Imagine filling a large container with small equal-sized spheres: Say a porcelain gallon jug with identical marbles. The &quot;density&quot; of the arrangement is equal to the total volume of all the marbles, divided by the volume of the jug. To maximize the number of marbles in the jug means to create an arrangement of marbles stacked between the sides and bottom of the jug, that has the highest possible density, so that the marbles are packed together as closely as possible.

Experiment shows that dropping the marbles in randomly, with no effort to arrange them tightly, will achieve a density of around 65%. However, a higher density can be achieved by carefully arranging the marbles as follows:
# For the first layer of marbles, arrange them in a hexagonal lattice (the honeycomb pattern)
# Put the next layer of marbles in the lowest lying gaps you can find above and between the marbles in the first layer, regardless of pattern
# Continue with the same procedure of filling in the lowest gaps in the prior layer, for the third and remaining layers, until the marbles reach the top edge of the jug.

At each step there are at least two choices of how to place the next layer, so this otherwise unplanned method of stacking the spheres creates an uncountably infinite number of equally dense packings. The best known of these are called &quot;cubic close packing&quot; and &quot;hexagonal close packing&quot;. Each of these arrangements has an average density of

:formula_1

The Kepler conjecture says that this is the best that can be done – no other arrangement of marbles has a higher average density: Despite there being astoundingly many different arrangements possible that follow the same procedure as steps 1–3, no packing (according to the procedure or not) can possibly fit more marbles into the same jug.

==Origins==

The conjecture was first stated by in his paper &#x27;On the six-cornered snowflake&#x27;. He had started to study arrangements of spheres as a result of his correspondence with the English mathematician and astronomer Thomas Harriot in 1606. Harriot was a friend and assistant of Sir Walter Raleigh, who had asked Harriot to find formulas for counting stacked cannonballs, an assignment which in turn led Raleigh&#x27;s mathematician acquaintance into wondering about what the best way to stack cannonballs was. Harriot published a study of various stacking patterns in 1591, and went on to develop an early version of atomic theory.

==Nineteenth century==
Kepler did not have a proof of the conjecture, and the next step was taken by , who proved that the Kepler conjecture is true if the spheres have to be arranged in a regular lattice.

This meant that any packing arrangement that disproved the Kepler conjecture would have to be an irregular one. But eliminating all possible irregular arrangements is very difficult, and this is what made the Kepler conjecture so hard to prove. In fact, there are irregular arrangements that are denser than the cubic close packing arrangement over a small enough volume, but any attempt to extend these arrangements to fill a larger volume is now known to always reduce their density.

After Gauss, no further progress was made towards proving the Kepler conjecture in the nineteenth century. In 1900 David Hilbert included it in his list of twenty three unsolved problems of mathematics—it forms part of Hilbert&#x27;s eighteenth problem.

==Twentieth century==
The next step toward a solution was taken by László Fejes Tóth. showed that the problem of determining the maximum density of all arrangements (regular and irregular) could be reduced to a finite (but very large) number of calculations. This meant that a proof by exhaustion was, in principle, possible. As Fejes Tóth realised, a fast enough computer could turn this theoretical result into a practical approach to the problem.

Meanwhile, attempts were made to find an upper bound for the maximum density of any possible arrangement of spheres. English mathematician Claude Ambrose Rogers (see ) established an upper bound value of about 78%, and subsequent efforts by other mathematicians reduced this value slightly, but this was still much larger than the cubic close packing density of about 74%.

In 1990, Wu-Yi Hsiang claimed to have proven the Kepler conjecture. The proof was praised by &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; and &quot;Science&quot; and Hsiang was also honored at joint meetings of AMS-MAA. claimed to prove the Kepler conjecture using geometric methods. However Gábor Fejes Tóth (the son of László Fejes Tóth) stated in his review of the paper &quot;As far as details are concerned, my opinion is that many of the key statements have no acceptable proofs.&quot; 
 gave a detailed criticism of Hsiang&#x27;s work, to which responded. The current consensus is that Hsiang&#x27;s proof is incomplete.

==Hales&#x27; proof==
Following the approach suggested by László Fejes Tóth, Thomas Hales, then at the University of Michigan, determined that the maximum density of all arrangements could be found by minimizing a function with 150 variables. In 1992, assisted by his graduate student Samuel Ferguson, he embarked on a research program to systematically apply linear programming methods to find a lower bound on the value of this function for each one of a set of over 5,000 different configurations of spheres. If a lower bound (for the function value) could be found for every one of these configurations that was greater than the value of the function for the cubic close packing arrangement, then the Kepler conjecture would be proved. To find lower bounds for all cases involved solving about 100,000 linear programming problems.

When presenting the progress of his project in 1996, Hales said that the end was in sight, but it might take &quot;a year or two&quot; to complete. In August 1998 Hales announced that the proof was complete. At that stage, it consisted of 250 pages of notes and 3 gigabytes of computer programs, data and results.

Despite the unusual nature of the proof, the editors of the &quot;Annals of Mathematics&quot; agreed to publish it, provided it was accepted by a panel of twelve referees. In 2003, after four years of work, the head of the referee&#x27;s panel, Gábor Fejes Tóth, reported that the panel were &quot;99% certain&quot; of the correctness of the proof, but they could not certify the correctness of all of the computer calculations.

 published a 100-page paper describing the non-computer part of his proof in detail.
 and several subsequent papers described the computational portions. Hales and Ferguson received the Fulkerson Prize for outstanding papers in the area of discrete mathematics for 2009.

===A formal proof===
In January 2003, Hales announced the start of a collaborative project to produce a complete formal proof of the Kepler conjecture. The aim was to remove any remaining uncertainty about the validity of the proof by creating a formal proof that can be verified by automated proof checking software such as HOL Light and Isabelle. This project was called &quot;Flyspeck&quot; – an expansion of the acronym FPK standing for &quot;Formal Proof of Kepler&quot;. At the start of this project, in 2007, Hales estimated that producing a complete formal proof would take around 20 years of work. Hales published a &quot;blueprint&quot; for the formal proof in 2012; the completion of the project was announced on August 10, 2014. In January 2015 Hales and 21 collaborators posted a paper titled &quot;A formal proof of the Kepler conjecture&quot; on the arXiv, claiming to have proved the conjecture. In 2017, the formal proof was accepted by the journal &quot;Forum of Mathematics&quot;.

<text>The Taurini were a Ligurian or Celto-Ligurian tribe dwelling in the upper valley of the river Po, around present-day Turin, during the Iron Age and the Roman period.

== Name ==
They are mentioned as &quot;Taurĩnoí&quot; (Ταυρῖνοί) by Polybius (2nd c. BC), &quot;Taurini&quot; by Livy (late 1st c. BC), &quot;Taurinoí&quot; (Ταυρινοί) by Strabo (early 1st c. AD), &quot;Taurinorum&quot; by Pliny (1st c. AD), and as &quot;Taurínōn&quot; (Ταυρίνων; var. Ταυρικῶν, Ταυρινῶν) by Ptolemy (2nd c. AD).

The ethnic name &quot;Taurini&quot; can be translated as &#x27;the tribe of the bull&#x27;. It is either an older form of the metathesized Celtic noun &quot;taruos&quot; (&#x27;bull&#x27;), or a non-Celtic Ligurian form.

== Geography ==
The Taurini lived between the Dora Riparia and the upper Po river and the lower Dandrune river. Their territory was located east of the Iemerii, west of the Libicii and Iadatini.

Their original capital, Taurasia, was destroyed by the Carthaginians after they opposed in vain Hannibal&#x27;s march into Italy in 218 BC. It was refounded by the Romans after 25 BC as Colonia Augusta Taurinorum (modern Turin), at the confluence of the Dora and Po. The settlement was hit by a fire in 69 AD.

==History==
They were involved in Rome&#x27;s wars against the Celts at the end of the 4th century BC.

In 218 BC, they were attacked by Hannibal, who had allied with their long-standing enemies, the Insubres. Their chief town was captured by Hannibal&#x27;s forces after a three-day siege.

<doc id="368319" wikidata="Q11393214" url="?curid=368319" title="Inertial electrostatic confinement">
<text>Inertial electrostatic confinement, or IEC, is a class of fusion power devices that use electric fields to confine the plasma rather than the more common approach using magnetic fields found in magnetic confinement fusion (MCF) designs. Most IEC devices directly accelerate their fuel to fusion conditions, thereby avoiding energy losses seen during the longer heating stages of MCF devices. In theory, this makes them more suitable for using alternative aneutronic fusion fuels, which offer a number of major practical benefits and makes IEC devices one of the more widely studied approaches to fusion.

IEC devices were the very first fusion products to reach the commercial market in 2000, as neutron generators. A company called NSD-Gradel developed a compact IEC device that fused ions and created neutrons and sold the product for several hundred thousand dollars. 

As the negatively charged electrons and positively charged ions in the plasma move in different directions in an electric field, the field has to be arranged in some fashion so that the two particles remain close together. Most IEC designs achieve this by pulling the electrons or ions across a potential well, beyond which the potential drops and the particles continue to move due to their inertia. Fusion occurs in this lower-potential area when ions moving in different directions collide. Because the motion provided by the field creates the energy levels needed for fusion, not random collisions with the rest of the fuel, the bulk of the plasma does not have to be hot and the systems as a whole work at much lower temperatures and energy levels than MCF devices.

One of the simpler IEC devices is the fusor, which consists of two concentric metal wire spherical grids. When the grids are charged to a high voltage, the fuel gas ionizes. The field between the two then accelerates the fuel inward, and when it passes the inner grid the field drops and the ions continue inward toward the center. If they impact with another ion they may undergo fusion. If they do not, they travel out of the reaction area into the charged area again, where they are re-accelerated inward. Overall the physical process is similar to the colliding beam fusion, although beam devices are linear instead of spherical. Other IEC designs, like the polywell, differ largely in the arrangement of the fields used to create the potential well.

A number of detailed theoretical studies have pointed out that the IEC approach is subject to a number of energy loss mechanisms that are not present if the fuel is evenly heated, or &quot;Maxwellian&quot;. These loss mechanisms appear to be greater than the rate of fusion in such devices, meaning they can never reach fusion breakeven and thus be used for power production. These mechanisms are more powerful when the atomic mass of the fuel increases, which suggests IEC also does not have any advantage with aneutronic fuels. Whether these critiques apply to specific IEC devices remains highly contentious.

==Mechanism==

For every volt that an ion is accelerated across, its kinetic energy gain corresponds to an increase of temperature of 11,604 kelvins (K). For example, a typical magnetic confinement fusion plasma is 15 keV, which corresponds to 170 megakelvin (MK). An ion with a charge of one can reach this temperature by being accelerated across a 15,000 V drop. This sort of voltage is easily achieved in common electrical devices; a typical cathode-ray tube operates in this range.

In fusors, the voltage drop is made with a wire cage. However high conduction losses occur in fusors because most ions fall into the cage before fusion can occur. This prevents current fusors from ever producing net power.

==History==

===1930s===

Mark Oliphant adapts Cockcroft and Walton&#x27;s particle accelerator at the Cavendish Laboratory to create tritium and helium-3 by nuclear fusion.

===1950s===
Three researchers at LANL including Jim Tuck first explored the idea, theoretically, in a 1959 paper. The idea had been proposed by a colleague. The concept was to capture electrons inside a positive cage. The electrons would accelerate the ions to fusion conditions.

Other concepts were being developed which would later merge into the IEC field. These include the publication of the Lawson criterion by John D. Lawson in 1957 in England. This puts on minimum criteria on power plant designs which do fusion using hot Maxwellian plasma clouds. Also, work exploring how electrons behave inside the biconic cusp, done by Harold Grad group at the Courant Institute in 1957. A biconic cusp is a device with two alike magnetic poles facing one another (i.e. north-north). Electrons and ions can be trapped between these.

===1960s===

In his work with vacuum tubes, Philo Farnsworth observed that electric charge would accumulate in regions of the tube. Today, this effect is known as the multipactor effect. Farnsworth reasoned that if ions were concentrated high enough they could collide, and fuse. In 1962, he filed a patent on a design using a positive inner cage to concentrate plasma, in order to achieve nuclear fusion. During this time, Robert L. Hirsch joined the Farnsworth Television labs and began work on what became the fusor. Hirsch patented the design in 1966 and published the design in 1967. The Hirsch machine was a 17.8 cm diameter machine with 150 kV voltage drop across it and used ion beams to help inject material.

Simultaneously, a key plasma physics text was published by Lyman Spitzer at Princeton in 1963. Spitzer took the ideal gas laws and adapted them to an ionized plasma, developing many of the fundamental equations used to model a plasma. Meanwhile, magnetic mirror theory and direct energy conversion were developed by Richard F. Post&#x27;s group at LLNL. A magnetic mirror or magnetic bottle is similar to a biconic cusp except that the poles are reversed.

===1980s===

In 1980 Robert W. Bussard developed a cross between a fusor and magnetic mirror, the polywell. The idea was to confine a non-neutral plasma using magnetic fields. This would, in turn, attract ions. This idea had been published previously, notably by Oleg Lavrentiev in Russia. Bussard patented the design and received funding from Defense Threat Reduction Agency, DARPA and the US Navy to develop the idea.

===1990s===

Bussard and Nicholas Krall published theory and experimental results in the early nineties. In response, Todd Rider at MIT, under Lawrence Lidsky developed general models of the device. Rider argued that the device was fundamentally limited. That same year, 1995, William Nevins at LLNL published a criticism of the polywell. Nevins argued that the particles would build up angular momentum, causing the dense core to degrade.

In the mid-nineties, Bussard publications prompted the development of fusors at the University of Wisconsin–Madison and at the University of Illinois at Urbana–Champaign. Madison&#x27;s machine was first built in 1995. George H. Miley&#x27;s team at Illinois built a 25 cm fusor which has produced 107 neutrons using deuterium gas and discovered the &quot;star mode&quot; of fusor operation in 1994. The following year, the first &quot;US-Japan Workshop on IEC Fusion&quot; was conducted. This is now the premier conference for IEC researchers. At this time in Europe, an IEC device was developed as a commercial neutron source by Daimler-Chrysler Aerospace under the name FusionStar. In the late nineties, hobbyist Richard Hull began building amateur fusors in his home. In March 1999, he achieved a neutron rate of 105 neutrons per second. Hull and Paul Schatzkin started fusor.net in 1998. Through this open forum, a community of amateur fusioneers have done nuclear fusion using homemade fusors.

===2000s===

Despite demonstration in 2000 of 7200 hours of operation without degradation at high input power as a sealed reaction chamber with automated control the FusionStar project was canceled and the company NSD Ltd was founded. The spherical FusionStar technology was then further developed as a linear geometry system with improved efficiency and higher neutron output by NSD Ltd. which became NSD-Fusion GmbH in 2005.

In early 2000, Alex Klein developed a cross between a polywell and ion beams. Using Gabor lensing, Dr. Klein attempted to focus plasma into non-neutral clouds for fusion. He founded FP generation, which in April 2009 raised $3 million in financing from two venture funds. The company developed the MIX and Marble machine, but ran into technical challenges and closed.

In response to Riders&#x27; criticisms, researchers at LANL reasoned that a plasma oscillating could be at local thermodynamic equilibrium; this prompted the POPS and Penning trap machines. At this time, MIT researchers became interested in fusors for space propulsion and powering space vehicles. Specifically, researchers developed fusors with multiple inner cages. In 2005, Greg Piefer founded Phoenix Nuclear Labs to develop the fusor into a neutron source for the mass production of medical isotopes.

Robert Bussard began speaking openly about the Polywell in 2006. He attempted to generate interest in the research, before passing away from multiple myeloma in 2007. His company was able to raise over ten million in funding from the US Navy in 2008 and 2009.

===2010s===

Bussard&#x27;s publications prompted the University of Sydney to start research into electron trapping in polywells in 2010. The group has explored theory, modeled devices, built devices, measured trapping and simulated trapping. These machines were all low power and cost and all had a small beta ratio. In 2010, Carl Greninger founded the northwest nuclear consortium, an organization which teaches nuclear engineering principles to high school students, using a 60 kvolt fusor. In 2012, Mark Suppes received attention, for a fusor. Suppes also measured electron trapping inside a polywell. In 2013, the first IEC textbook was published by George H. Miley.

===2020s===
Avalanche Energy is a start-up with about $51 million in venture/DOD funding that is working on small (tens of centimetres), modular, fusion batteries producing 5kWe. They are targeting 600 kV for their device to achieve certain design goals. Their Orbitron concept electrostatically (magnetron-augmented) confines ions orbiting around a high voltage (100s of kVs) cathode in a high vacuum environment (p&lt; 10 −8 Torr) surrounded by one or two anode shells separated by a dielectric. Concerns include breakdown of the vacuum/dielectric and insulator surface flashover. Permanent magnet/electromagnet magnetic field generators are arranged coaxially around the anode. The magnetic field strength is targeted to exceed a Hull cut-off condition, ranging from 50-4,000 kV. Candidate ions include protons (m/z=1), deuterium (m/z=2), tritium (m/z=3), lithium-6 (m/z=6), and boron-11 (m/z=11). Recent progress includes successful testing of a 300 kV bushing.

==Designs with cage==

===Fusor===

The best known IEC device is the fusor. This device typically consists of two wire cages inside a vacuum chamber. These cages are referred to as grids. The inner cage is held at a negative voltage against the outer cage. A small amount of fusion fuel is introduced (deuterium gas being the most common). The voltage between the grids causes the fuel to ionize. The positive ions fall down the voltage drop toward the negative inner cage. As they accelerate, the electric field does work on the ions, accelerating them to fusion conditions. If these ions collide, they can fuse. Fusors can also use ion guns rather than electric grids. Fusors are popular with amateurs, because they can easily be constructed, can regularly produce fusion and are a practical way to study nuclear physics. Fusors have also been used as a commercial neutron generator for industrial applications.

No fusor has come close to producing a significant amount of fusion power. They can be dangerous if proper care is not taken because they require high voltages and can produce harmful radiation (neutrons and X-rays). Often, ions collide with the cages or wall. This conducts energy away from the device limiting its performance. In addition, collisions heat the grids, which limits high-power devices. Collisions also spray high-mass ions into the reaction chamber, pollute the plasma, and cool the fuel.

===POPS===

In examining nonthermal plasma, workers at LANL realized that scattering was more likely than fusion. This was due to the coulomb scattering cross section being larger than the fusion cross section. In response they built POPS, a machine with a wire cage, where ions are moving at steady-state, or oscillating around. Such plasma can be at local thermodynamic equilibrium. The ion oscillation is predicted to maintain the equilibrium distribution of the ions at all times, which would eliminate any power loss due to Coulomb scattering, resulting in a net energy gain. Working off this design, researchers in Russia simulated the POPS design using particle-in-cell code in 2009. This reactor concept becomes increasingly efficient as the size of the device shrinks. However, very high transparencies (&gt;99.999%) are required for successful operation of the POPS concept. To this end S. Krupakar Murali et al., suggested that carbon nanotubes can be used to construct the cathode grids. This is also the first (suggested) application of carbon nanotubes directly in any fusion reactor.

==Designs with fields==
Several schemes attempt to combine magnetic confinement and electrostatic fields with IEC. The goal is to eliminate the inner wire cage of the fusor, and the resulting problems.

===Polywell===
The polywell uses a magnetic field to trap electrons. When electrons or ions move into a dense field, they can be reflected by the magnetic mirror effect. A polywell is designed to trap electrons in the center, with a dense magnetic field surrounding them. This is typically done using six electromagnets in a box. Each magnet is positioned so their poles face inward, creating a null point in the center. The electrons trapped in the center form a &quot;virtual electrode&quot; Ideally, this electron cloud accelerates ions to fusion conditions.

===Penning trap===

A Penning trap uses both an electric and a magnetic field to trap particles, a magnetic field to confine particles radially and a quadrupole electric field to confine the particles axially.

In a Penning trap fusion reactor, first the magnetic and electric fields are turned on. Then, electrons are emitted into the trap, caught and measured. The electrons form a virtual electrode similar to that in a polywell, described above. These electrons are intended to then attract ions, accelerating them to fusion conditions.

In the 1990s, researchers at LANL built a Penning trap to do fusion experiments. Their device (PFX) was a small (millimeters) and low power (one fifth of a tesla, less than ten thousand volts) machine.

===Marble===
MARBLE (multiple ambipolar recirculating beam line experiment) was a device which moved electrons and ions back and forth in a line. Particle beams were reflected using electrostatic optics. These optics made static voltage surfaces in free space. Such surfaces reflect only particles with a specific kinetic energy, while higher-energy particles can traverse these surfaces unimpeded, although not unaffected. Electron trapping and plasma behavior was measured by Langmuir probe. Marble kept ions on orbits that do not intersect grid wires—the latter also improves the space charge limitations by multiple nesting of ion beams at several energies. Researchers encountered problems with ion losses at the reflection points. Ions slowed down when turning, spending much time there, leading to high conduction losses.

===MIX===

The multipole ion-beam experiment (MIX) accelerated ions and electrons into a negatively charged electromagnet. Ions were focused using Gabor lensing. Researcher had problems with a very thin ion-turning region very close to a solid surface where ions could be conducted away.

===Magnetically insulated===

Devices have been proposed where the negative cage is magnetically insulated from the incoming plasmas.

==General criticism==
In 1995, Todd Rider critiqued all fusion power schemes using plasma systems not at thermodynamic equilibrium. Rider assumed that plasma clouds at equilibrium had the following properties:
* They were quasineutral, where the positives and negatives are equally mixed together.
* They had evenly mixed fuel.
* They were isotropic, meaning that its behavior was the same in any given direction.
* The plasma had a uniform energy and temperature throughout the cloud.
* The plasma was an unstructured Gaussian sphere.

Rider argued that if such system was sufficiently heated, it could not be expected to produce net power, due to high X-ray losses.

Other fusion researchers such as Nicholas Krall, Robert W. Bussard, Norman Rostoker, and Monkhorst disagreed with this assessment. They argue that the plasma conditions inside IEC machines are not quasineutral and have non-thermal energy distributions. Because the electron has a mass and diameter much smaller than the ion, the electron temperature can be several orders of magnitude different than the ions. This may allow the plasma to be optimized, whereby cold electrons would reduce radiation losses and hot ions would raise fusion rates.

===Thermalization===
The primary problem that Rider has raised is the thermalization of ions. Rider argued that, in a quasineutral plasma where all the positives and negatives are distributed equally, the ions will interact. As they do, they exchange energy, causing their energy to spread out (in a Wiener process) heading to a bell curve (or Gaussian function) of energy. Rider focused his arguments within the ion population and did not address electron-to-ion energy exchange or non-thermal plasmas.

This spreading of energy causes several problems. One problem is making more and more cold ions, which are too cold to fuse. This would lower output power. Another problem is higher energy ions which have so much energy that they can escape the machine. This lowers fusion rates while raising conduction losses, because as the ions leave, energy is carried away with them.

===Radiation===

Rider estimated that once the plasma is thermalized the radiation losses would outpace any amount of fusion energy generated. He focused on a specific type of radiation: X-ray radiation. A particle in a plasma will radiate light anytime it speeds up or slows down. This can be estimated using the Larmor formula. Rider estimated this for D–T (deuterium–tritium fusion), D–D (deuterium fusion), and D–He3 (deuterium–helium 3 fusion), and that breakeven operation with any fuel except D–T is difficult.

===Core focus===

In 1995, Nevins argued that such machines would need to expend a great deal of energy maintaining ion focus in the center. The ions need to be focused so that they can find one another, collide, and fuse. Over time the positive ions and negative electrons would naturally intermix because of electrostatic attraction. This causes the focus to be lost. This is core degradation. Nevins argued mathematically, that the fusion gain (ratio of fusion power produced to the power required to maintain the non-equilibrium ion distribution function) is limited to 0.1 assuming that the device is fueled with a mixture of deuterium and tritium.

The core focus problem was also identified in fusors by Tim Thorson at the University of Wisconsin–Madison during his 1996 doctoral work. Charged ions would have some motion before they started accelerating in the center. This motion could be a twisting motion, where the ion had angular momentum, or simply a tangential velocity. This initial motion causes the cloud in the center of the fusor to be unfocused.

===Brillouin limit===

In 1945, Columbia University professor Léon Brillouin, suggested that there was a limit to how many electrons one could pack into a given volume. This limit is commonly referred to as the Brillouin limit or Brillouin density, this is shown below.
:formula_1

Where B is the magnetic field, formula_2 the permeability of free space, m the mass of confined particles, and c the speed of light. This may limit the charge density inside IEC devices.

==Commercial applications==
Since fusion reactions generates neutrons, the fusor has been developed into a family of compact sealed reaction chamber neutron generators for a wide range of applications that need moderate neutron output rates at a moderate price. Very high output neutron sources may be used to make products such as molybdenum-99 and nitrogen-13, medical isotopes used for PET scans.

<text>The Sihásapa or Blackfoot Sioux are a division of the Lakota people, Titonwan, or Teton.

&quot;Sihásapa&quot; is the Lakota word for &quot;Blackfoot&quot;, whereas &quot;Siksiká&quot; has the same meaning in the Nitsitapi language, and, together with the &quot;Kainah&quot; and the &quot;Piikani&quot; forms the &quot;Nitsitapi Confederacy&quot;. As a result, the Sihásapa have the same English name as the Blackfoot Confederacy (correctly: Nitsitapi Confederacy), and the nations are sometimes confused with one another.

The Sihásapa lived in the western Dakotas on the Great Plains, and consequently are among the Plains Indians. Their official residence today is the Standing Rock Reservation in North and South Dakota and the Cheyenne River Reservation in South Dakota, home also to the Itazipco (No Bows), the Minneconjou (People Who Live Near Water) and Oohenumpa (Two Kettle), all bands of the Lakota.

==Historic Sihásapa thiyóšpaye or Bands==
In 1880, John Grass provided a list of the bands (tiyóšpaye) of the Sihasapa:

*Sihasapa-Hkcha or Sihasapa qtca (&quot;Real Blackfoot&quot;)
*Kangi-shun Pegnake or Kanxicu pegnake (&quot;Crow Feather Hair Ornaments&quot; or &quot;Wear raven feathers in their hair&quot;)
*Glaglahecha or Glagla heca (&quot;Slovenly&quot;, &quot;untidy&quot; or &quot;Too lazy to tie their moccasins&quot;)
*Wazhazha or Wajaje (&quot;Osage&quot;), Kill Eagle&#x27;s Band
*Hohe (&quot;Rebels, i.e. Assiniboine&quot;)
*Wamnuga Owin or Wamnugaoin (&quot;Cowrie-Shell Earrings&quot; or &quot;Shell ear ornaments or Pendants&quot;)

==Famous Sihásapa==
* Cante Peta &#x27;Fire Heart&#x27;
* Mahto Eennahpa &#x27;White Bear&#x27;
* Magashapa &#x27;Goose&#x27;
* Pezi &#x27;Grass&#x27;
* Mahto Wakouah &#x27;Charging Bear&#x27; alias Okihe Pezi &#x27;Young Grass&#x27; alias &#x27;John Grass&#x27;
* Wambli Kte &#x27;Kill Eagle&#x27;

<doc id="368323" wikidata="Q973104" url="?curid=368323" title="Cockney Rejects">
<text>Cockney Rejects are an English punk rock band that formed in the East End of London in 1978. Their 1980 song &quot;Oi, Oi, Oi&quot; was the inspiration for the name of the Oi! music genre. The band members are supporters of West Ham United, and pay tribute to the club with their hit cover version of &quot;I&#x27;m Forever Blowing Bubbles&quot;, a song traditionally sung by West Ham supporters.

==Career==
Few stories in British rock are as raw and turbulent as that of the Cockney Rejects. Formed in East London in the late 1970s, they rejected the art-school punk scene, delivering a fiercely working-class sound. Their lyrics reflected the realities of inner-city life—police harassment, street battles, and football—striking a chord with the youth of the time.

Signed by EMI after just four gigs, the Rejects quickly rose to fame with sell-out UK tours and a chart-topping debut album. Their wild antics on Top of the Pops earned them a ban from the show, adding to their rebellious reputation. In 1980, they recorded the iconic “I’m Forever Blowing Bubbles” to celebrate West Ham United’s FA Cup final.

In the 1990s, the Rejects gained new fans as bands like Rancid and Green Day cited them as inspirations. Returning to the stage in 2000, they have since performed to massive audiences worldwide, known for their high-energy live shows.

In January 2024, the band evolved. Lead singer Jeff “Stinky” Turner now fronts a revitalized lineup featuring Olga (Toy Dolls) on guitar, JJ Kaos (Last Resort, Anti-Nowhere League) on bass, and Ray Dust (The Business, Argy Bargy) on drums. This “punk rock supergroup” is bringing the Cockney Rejects’ legacy to fans across the globe.

<text>The gondola (, ; , ) is a traditional, flat-bottomed Venetian rowing boat, well suited to the conditions of the Venetian lagoon. It is typically propelled by a gondolier, who uses a rowing oar, which is not fastened to the hull, in a sculling manner, and also acts as the rudder. The uniqueness of the gondola includes its being asymmetrical along the length, making the single-oar propulsion more efficient.

For centuries, the gondola was a major means of transportation and the most common watercraft within Venice. In modern times, the boats still do have a role in public transport in the city, serving as &quot;traghetti&quot; (small ferries) over the Grand Canal operated by two oarsmen.

Various types of gondola boats are also used in special regattas (rowing races) held amongst gondoliers. Their primary role today, however, is to carry tourists on rides at fixed rates. There are approximately 400 licensed gondoliers in Venice and a similar number of boats, down from the thousands that travelled the canals centuries ago. However, they are now elegantly crafted, as opposed to the various types of homemade boats of the past.

==History and usage==

The gondola is propelled by a person (the gondolier) who stands on the stern facing the bow and rows with a forward stroke, followed by a compensating backward stroke. The oar rests in an elaborately carved wooden rest (&quot;forcola&quot;) shaped to project from the side of the craft so as to allow the slight drag of each return stroke to pull the bow back to its forward course. Because of the vessel&#x27;s flat bottom it may also be &quot;drifted&quot; sideways when required. Contrary to popular belief, the gondola is never poled like a punt as the waters of Venice are too deep. Until the early 20th century, as many photographs attest, gondolas were often fitted with a &quot;felze&quot;, a small cabin, to protect the passengers from the weather or from onlookers. Its windows could be closed with louvered shutters—the original &quot;Venetian blinds&quot;.

After the elimination of the traditional felze—possibly in response to tourists&#x27; complaining that it blocked the view—there survived for some decades a kind of vestigial summer awning, known as the &quot;tendalin&quot; (these can be seen on gondolas as late as the mid-1950s, in the film &quot;Summertime&quot; (1955)). While in previous centuries gondolas could be many different colors, a sumptuary law of Venice required that gondolas should be painted black, and they are customarily so painted now.

The gondola has existed in Venice since the 11th century, being first mentioned by name in 1094. It is estimated that there were eight to ten thousand gondolas during the 17th and 18th century, but there are only around four hundred in active service today, with virtually all of them used for hire by tourists. Those few that are in private ownership are either hired out to Venetians for weddings or used for racing. Even though the gondola, by now, has become a widely publicized icon of Venice, in the times of the Republic of Venice it was by far not the only means of transportation; on the map of Venice created by Jacopo de&#x27; Barbari in 1500, only a fraction of the boats are gondolas, the majority of boats are , , galleys, and other boats. Now, only a handful of batellas survive, and are used for racing only.

The historical gondola was quite different from its modern evolution; the paintings of Canaletto and others show a much lower prow, a higher &quot;ferro&quot;, and usually two rowers. The banana-shaped modern gondola was developed only in the 19th century by the boat-builder Tramontin, whose heirs still run the Tramontin boatyard. The construction of the gondola continued to evolve until the mid-20th century, when the city government prohibited any further modifications.

In the 1500s an estimated 10,000 gondolas of all types were in Venice; in 1878 an estimated 4000 and now approximately 400.

The origin of the word &quot;gondola&quot; has never been satisfactorily established, despite many theories.

===Current design===

Today&#x27;s gondola is up to 11 m long and 1.6 m wide, with a mass of 350 kg. They are made of 280 hand-made pieces using eight types of wood (lime, oak, mahogany, walnut, cherry, fir, larch and elm). The process takes about two months; in 2013, the cost of a gondola was about 38,000 euros. The oar or &quot;rèmo&quot; is held in an oarlock known as a &quot;fórcola&quot;. The forcola is of a complicated shape, allowing several positions of the oar for slow forward rowing, powerful forward rowing, turning, slowing down, rowing backwards, and stopping. The ornament on the front of the boat is called the &quot;fèrro&quot; (meaning iron) and can be made from brass, stainless steel, or aluminium. It serves as decoration and as counterweight for the gondolier standing near the stern.
According to a popular urban legend with no factual basis, every detail of the gondola has its own symbolism. The iron prow-head of the gondola, called &quot;fero da prorà&quot; or &quot;dolfin&quot;, is needed to balance the weight of the gondolier at the stern and has an &quot;Ƨ&quot; shape symbolic of the twists in the Canal Grande. Under the main blade there is a kind of comb with six teeth or prongs (&quot;rebbi&quot;) pointing forward standing for the six districts or &quot;sestieri&quot; of Venice (however, this is contradicted by the fact that old photographs and paintings show gondolas with 4 or 5 teeth). A kind of tooth juts out backwards toward the centre of the gondola symbolises the island of Giudecca. The curved top signifies the Doge&#x27;s cap. The semi-circular break between the curved top and the six teeth is said to represent the Rialto Bridge. Sometimes three friezes can be seen in-between the six prongs, indicating the three main islands of the city: Murano, Burano and Torcello. This symbolism is likely influenced by the need to explain the shape to tourists, rather than the shape being influenced by those symbols, as they are not mentioned in any writings about the gondola prior to the current evolution of the shape of the Fero.

The gondola is also one of the vessels typically used in both ceremonial and competitive regattas, rowing races held amongst gondoliers using the technique of Voga alla Veneta.

==Gondolieri==
During their heyday as a means of public transports, teams of four men would share ownership of a gondola three oarsmen (&quot;gondoliers&quot;) and a fourth person, primarily shore-based and responsible for the booking and administration of the gondola (&quot;Il Rosso Riserva&quot;).

However, as the gondolas became more of a tourist attraction than a mode of public transport all but one of these cooperatives and their offices have closed. The category is now protected by the Institution for the Protection and Conservation of Gondolas and Gondoliers, headquartered in the historical center of Venice.

The profession of gondolier is controlled by a guild, which issues a limited number of licenses (approximately 400), granted after periods of training (400 hours over six months) and apprenticeship, and a major comprehensive exam which tests knowledge of Venetian history and landmarks, foreign language skills, and practical skills in handling the gondola. Such skills are necessary in the tight spaces of Venetian canals. Gondoliers dress in a blue or red striped top, red neckerchief, wide-brimmed straw hat and dark pants. A gondolier can earn the equivalent of up to US$150,000 per year.

In August 2010, Giorgia Boscolo became Venice&#x27;s first fully licensed female gondolier.

==Outside of Venice==

There are about a half dozen cities in the United States where gondolas are operated as tourist attractions, including New Orleans, the Charles River in Boston, Stillwater (Minnesota), New York&#x27;s Central Park, and the Providence River in Rhode Island, as well as several in California. The annual &quot;U.S. Gondola Nationals&quot; competitions have been held since 2011, and feature American Gondoliers competing in sprints and slalom races,

== References in literature and history ==

Mark Twain visited Venice in the summer of 1867. He dedicated much of &quot;The Innocents Abroad&quot;, chapter 23, to describing the curiosity of urban life with gondolas and gondoliers.

The first act of Gilbert and Sullivan&#x27;s two-act comic operetta &quot;The Gondoliers&quot; is set in Venice, and its two protagonists (as well as its men&#x27;s chorus) are of the eponymous profession, even though the political irony that makes up the core of the piece has much more to do with British society than with Venice.

<doc id="368327" wikidata="Q1063245" url="?curid=368327" title="Identification friend or foe">
<text>Identification, friend or foe (IFF) is a combat identification system designed for command and control. It uses a transponder that listens for an &quot;interrogation&quot; signal and then sends a &quot;response&quot; that identifies the broadcaster. IFF systems usually use radar frequencies, but other electromagnetic frequencies, radio or infrared, may be used. It enables military and civilian air traffic control interrogation systems to identify aircraft, vehicles or forces as friendly, as opposed to neutral or hostile, and to determine their bearing and range from the interrogator. IFF is used by both military and civilian aircraft. IFF was first developed during World War II, with the arrival of radar, and several friendly fire incidents.

IFF can only positively identify friendly aircraft or other forces. If an IFF interrogation receives no reply or an invalid reply, the object is not positively identified as foe; friendly forces may not properly reply to IFF for various reasons such as equipment malfunction, and parties in the area not involved in the combat, such as civilian airliners, will not be equipped with IFF.

IFF is a tool within the broader military action of combat identification (CID), the characterization of objects detected in the field of combat sufficiently accurately to support operational decisions. The broadest characterization is that of friend, enemy, neutral, or unknown. CID not only can reduce friendly fire incidents, but also contributes to overall tactical decision-making.

With the successful deployment of radar systems for air defence during World War II, combatants were immediately confronted with the difficulty of distinguishing friendly aircraft from hostile ones; by that time, aircraft were flown at high speed and altitude, making visual identification impossible, and the targets showed up as featureless blips on the radar screen. This led to incidents such as the Battle of Barking Creek, over Britain, and the air attack on the fortress of Koepenick over Germany.

== British development ==

=== Early concepts ===
Already before the deployment of their Chain Home radar system (CH), the RAF had considered the problem of IFF. Robert Watson-Watt had filed patents on such systems in 1935 and 1936. By 1938, researchers at Bawdsey Manor began experiments with &quot;reflectors&quot; consisting of dipole antennas tuned to resonate to the primary frequency of the CH radars. When a pulse from the CH transmitter hit the aircraft, the antennas would resonate for a short time, increasing the amount of energy returned to the CH receiver. The antenna was connected to a motorized switch that periodically shorted it out, preventing it from producing a signal. This caused the return on the CH set to periodically lengthen and shorten as the antenna was turned on and off. In practice, the system was found to be too unreliable to use; the return was highly dependent on the direction the aircraft was moving relative to the CH station, and often returned little or no additional signal.

It had been suspected this system would be of little use in practice. When that turned out to be the case, the RAF turned to an entirely different system that was also being planned. This consisted of a set of tracking stations using HF/DF radio direction finders. Their aircraft radios were modified to send out a 1 kHz tone for 14 seconds every minute, allowing the stations ample time to measure the aircraft&#x27;s bearing. Several such stations were assigned to each &quot;sector&quot; of the air defence system, and sent their measurements to a plotting station at sector headquarters, who used triangulation to determine the aircraft&#x27;s location. Known as &quot;pip-squeak&quot;, the system worked, but was labour-intensive and did not display its information directly to the radar operators. A system that worked directly with the radar was clearly desirable.

=== IFF Mark II ===
The first active IFF transponder (transmitter/responder) was the IFF Mark I which was used experimentally in 1939. This used a regenerative receiver, which fed a small amount of the amplified output back into the input, strongly amplifying even small signals as long as they were of a single frequency (like Morse code, but unlike voice transmissions). They were tuned to the signal from the CH radar (20–30 MHz), amplifying it so strongly that it was broadcast back out the aircraft&#x27;s antenna. Since the signal was received at the same time as the original reflection of the CH signal, the result was a lengthened &quot;blip&quot; on the CH display which was easily identifiable. In testing, it was found that the unit would often overpower the radar or produce too little signal to be seen, and at the same time, new radars were being introduced using new frequencies.

Instead of putting Mark I into production, a new IFF Mark II was introduced in early 1940. Mark II had a series of separate tuners inside tuned to different radar bands that it stepped through using a motorized switch, while an automatic gain control solved the problem of it sending out too much signal. Mark II was technically complete as the war began, but a lack of sets meant it was not available in quantity and only a small number of RAF aircraft carried it by the time of the Battle of Britain. Pip-squeak was kept in operation during this period, but as the Battle ended, IFF Mark II was quickly put into full operation. Pip-squeak was still used for areas over land where CH did not cover, as well as an emergency guidance system.

=== IFF Mark III ===
Even by 1940 the complex system of Mark II was reaching its limits while new radars were being constantly introduced. By 1941, a number of sub-models were introduced that covered different combinations of radars, common naval ones for instance, or those used by the RAF. But the introduction of radars based on the microwave-frequency cavity magnetron rendered this obsolete; there was simply no way to make a responder operating in this band using contemporary electronics.

In 1940, English engineer Freddie Williams had suggested using a single separate frequency for all IFF signals, but at the time there seemed no pressing need to change the existing system. With the introduction of the magnetron, work on this concept began at the Telecommunications Research Establishment as the IFF Mark III. This was to become the standard for the Western Allies for most of the war.

Mark III transponders were designed to respond to specific &#x27;interrogators&#x27;, rather than replying directly to received radar signals. These interrogators worked on a limited selection of frequencies, no matter what radar they were paired with. The system also allowed limited communication to be made, including the ability to transmit a coded &#x27;Mayday&#x27; response. The IFF sets were designed and built by Ferranti in Manchester to Williams&#x27; specifications. Equivalent sets were manufactured in the US, initially as copies of British sets, so that allied aircraft would be identified upon interrogation by each other&#x27;s radar.

IFF sets were obviously highly classified. Thus, many of them were wired with explosives in the event the aircrew bailed out or crash landed. Jerry Proc reports:

== Germany ==
FuG 25a &quot;Erstling&quot; (English: Firstborn, Debut) was developed in Germany in 1940. It was tuned to the low-VHF band at 125 MHz used by the Freya radar, and an adaptor was used with the low-UHF-banded 550–580 MHz used by Würzburg. Before a flight, the transceiver was set up with a selected day code of ten bits which was dialed into the unit. To start the identification procedure, the ground operator switched the pulse frequency of his radar from 3,750 Hz to 5,000 Hz. The airborne receiver decoded that and started to transmit the day code. The radar operator would then see the blip lengthen and shorten in the given code. The IFF transmitter worked on 168 MHz with a power of 400 watts (PEP).

The system included a way for ground controllers to determine whether an aircraft had the right code or not but it did not include a way for the transponder to reject signals from other sources. British military scientists found a way of exploiting this by building their own IFF transmitter called Perfectos, which were designed to trigger a response from any FuG 25a system in the vicinity. When an FuG 25a responded on its 168 MHz frequency, the signal was received by the antenna system from an AI Mk. IV radar, which originally operated at 212 MHz. By comparing the strength of the signal on different antennas the direction to the target could be determined. Mounted on Mosquitos, the &quot;Perfectos&quot; severely limited German use of the FuG 25a.

== Further wartime developments ==
=== IFF Mark IV and V ===

The United States Naval Research Laboratory had been working on their own IFF system since before the war. It used a single interrogation frequency, like the Mark III, but differed in that it used a separate responder frequency. Responding on a different frequency has several practical advantages, most notably that the response from one IFF cannot trigger another IFF on another aircraft. But it requires a complete transmitter for the responder side of the circuitry, in contrast to the greatly simplified regenerative system used in the British designs. This technique is now known as a cross-band transponder.

When the Mark II was revealed in 1941 during the Tizard Mission, it was decided to use it and take the time to further improve their experimental system. The result was what became IFF Mark IV. The main difference between this and earlier models is that it worked on higher frequencies, around 600 MHz, which allowed much smaller antennas. However, this also turned out to be close to the frequencies used by the German Würzburg radar and there were concerns that it would be triggered by that radar and the transponder responses would be picked on its radar display. This would immediately reveal the IFF&#x27;s operational frequencies.

This led to a US–British effort to make a further improved model, the Mark V, also known as the United Nations Beacon or UNB. This moved to still higher frequencies around 1 GHz but operational testing was not complete when the war ended. By the time testing was finished in 1948, the much improved Mark X was beginning its testing and Mark V was abandoned.

== Postwar systems ==

=== IFF Mark X ===
Mark X started as a purely experimental device operating at frequencies above 1 GHz;
the name refers to &quot;experimental&quot;, not &quot;number 10&quot;. As development continued it was decided to introduce an encoding system known as the &quot;Selective Identification Feature&quot;, or SIF. SIF allowed the return signal to contain up to 12 pulses, representing four octal digits of 3 bits each. Depending on the timing of the interrogation signal, SIF would respond in several ways. Mode 1 indicated the type of aircraft or its mission (cargo or bomber, for instance) while Mode 2 returned a tail code.

Mark X began to be introduced in the early 1950s. This was during a period of great expansion of the civilian air transport system, and it was decided to use slightly modified Mark X sets for these aircraft as well. These sets included a new military Mode 3 which was essentially identical to Mode 2, returning a four-digit code, but used a different interrogation pulse, allowing the aircraft to identify if the query was from a military or civilian radar. For civilian aircraft, this same system was known as Mode A, and because they were identical, they are generally known as Mode 3/A.

Several new modes were also introduced during this process. Civilian modes B and D were defined, but never used. Mode C responded with a 12-bit number encoded using Gillham code, which represented the altitude as (that number) x 100 feet - 1200. Radar systems can easily locate an aircraft in two dimensions, but measuring altitude is a more complex problem and, especially in the 1950s, added significantly to the cost of the radar system. By placing this function on the IFF, the same information could be returned for little additional cost, essentially that of adding a digitizer to the aircraft&#x27;s altimeter.

Modern interrogators generally send out a series of challenges on Mode 3/A and then Mode C, allowing the system to combine the identity of the aircraft with its altitude and location from the radar.

=== IFF Mark XII ===

The current IFF system is the Mark XII. This works on the same frequencies as Mark X, and supports all of its military and civilian modes.

It had long been considered a problem that the IFF responses could be triggered by any properly formed interrogation, and those signals were simply two short pulses of a single frequency. This allowed enemy transmitters to trigger the response, and using triangulation, an enemy could determine the location of the transponder. The British had already used this technique against the Germans during WWII, and it was used by the USAF against VPAF aircraft during the Vietnam War.

Mark XII differs from Mark X through the addition of the new military Mode 4. This works in a fashion similar to Mode 3/A, with the interrogator sending out a signal that the IFF responds to. There are two key differences, however.

One is that the interrogation pulse is followed by a 12-bit code similar to the ones sent back by the Mark 3 transponders. The encoded number changes day-to-day. When the number is received and decoded in the aircraft transponder, a further cryptographic encoding is applied. If the result of that operation matches the value dialled into the IFF in the aircraft, the transponder replies with a Mode 3 response as before. If the values do not match, it does not respond.

This solves the problem of the aircraft transponder replying to false interrogations, but does not completely solve the problem of locating the aircraft through triangulation. To solve this problem, a delay is added to the response signal that varies based on the code sent from the interrogator. When received by an enemy that does not see the interrogation pulse, which is generally the case as they are often below the radar horizon, this causes a random displacement of the return signal with every pulse. Locating the aircraft within the set of returns is a difficult process.

=== Mode S ===

During the 1980s, a new civilian mode, Mode S, was added that allowed greatly increased amounts of data to be encoded in the returned signal. This was used to encode the location of the aircraft from the navigation system. This is a basic part of the traffic collision avoidance system (TCAS), which allows commercial aircraft to know the location of other aircraft in the area and avoid them without the need for ground operators.

The basic concepts from Mode S were then militarized as Mode 5, which is simply a cryptographically encoded version of the Mode S data.

The IFF of World War II and Soviet military systems (1946 to 1991) used coded radar signals (called cross-band interrogation, or CBI) to automatically trigger the aircraft&#x27;s transponder in an aircraft illuminated by the radar. Radar-based aircraft identification is also called secondary surveillance radar in both military and civil usage, with primary radar bouncing an RF pulse off of the aircraft to determine position. George Charrier, working for RCA, filed for a patent for such an IFF device in 1941. It required the operator to perform several adjustments to the radar receiver to suppress the image of the natural echo on the radar receiver, so that visual examination of the IFF signal would be possible.

By 1943, Donald Barchok filed a patent for a radar system using the abbreviation IFF in his text with only parenthetic explanation, indicating that this acronym had become an accepted term. In 1945, Emile Labin and Edwin Turner filed patents for radar IFF systems where the outgoing radar signal and the transponder&#x27;s reply signal could each be independently programmed with a binary codes by setting arrays of toggle switches; this allowed the IFF code to be varied from day to day or even hour to hour.

== Early 21st century systems ==

The United States and other NATO countries started using a system called Mark XII in the late twentieth century; Britain had not until then implemented an IFF system compatible with that standard, but then developed a program for a compatible system known as successor IFF (SIFF).

== Modes ==
* Mode 1: military only; provides 2-digit octal (6 bit) &quot;mission code&quot; that identifies the aircraft type or mission.
* Mode 2: military only; provides 4-digit octal (12 bit) unit code or tail number.
* Mode 3/A: military/civilian; provides a 4-digit octal (12 bit) identification code for the aircraft, assigned by the air traffic controller. Commonly referred to as a squawk code.
* Mode 4: military only; provides a 3-pulse reply, delay is based on the encrypted challenge.
* Mode 5: military only; provides a cryptographically secured version of Mode S and ADS-B GPS position.

Modes 4 and 5 are designated for use by NATO forces.

== Submarines ==

In World War I, eight submarines were sunk by friendly fire and in World War II nearly twenty were sunk this way. Still, IFF has not been regarded a high concern before the 1990s by the US military as not many other countries possess submarines.

IFF methods that are analogous to aircraft IFF have been deemed unfeasible for submarines because they would make submarines easier to detect. Thus, having friendly submarines broadcast a signal, or somehow increase the submarine&#x27;s signature (based on acoustics, magnetic fluctuations etc.), are not considered viable. Instead, submarine IFF is done based on carefully defining areas of operation. Each friendly submarine is assigned a patrol area, where the presence of any other submarine is deemed hostile and open to attack. Further, within these assigned areas, surface ships and aircraft refrain from any anti-submarine warfare (ASW); only the resident submarine may target other submarines in its own area. Ships and aircraft may still engage in ASW in areas that have not been assigned to any friendly submarines. Navies also use database of acoustic signatures to attempt to identify the submarine, but acoustic data can be ambiguous and several countries deploy similar classes of submarines.

<doc id="368328" wikidata="Q26336" url="?curid=368328" title="Electrostatics">
<text>Electrostatics is a branch of physics that studies slow-moving or stationary electric charges.

Since classical times, it has been known that some materials, such as amber, attract lightweight particles after rubbing. The Greek word (), meaning &#x27;amber&#x27;, was thus the root of the word &quot;electricity&quot;. Electrostatic phenomena arise from the forces that electric charges exert on each other. Such forces are described by Coulomb&#x27;s law.

There are many examples of electrostatic phenomena, from those as simple as the attraction of plastic wrap to one&#x27;s hand after it is removed from a package, to the apparently spontaneous explosion of grain silos, the damage of electronic components during manufacturing, and photocopier and laser printer operation.

The electrostatic model accurately predicts electrical phenomena in &quot;classical&quot; cases where the velocities are low and the system is macroscopic so no quantum effects are involved. It also plays a role in quantum mechanics, where additional terms also need to be included.

== Coulomb&#x27;s law ==

Coulomb&#x27;s law states that:
The force is along the straight line joining them. If the two charges have the same sign, the electrostatic force between them is repulsive; if they have different signs, the force between them is attractive.

If formula_1 is the distance (in meters) between two charges, then the force between two point charges formula_2 and formula_3 is:
: formula_4
where formula_5 is the distance of each charge formula_6 from the test charge formula_3, which situated at the point formula_8, and formula_9 is the electric potential that would be at formula_8 if the test charge were not present. If only two charges are present, the potential energy is formula_11. The total electric potential energy due a collection of &quot;N&quot; charges is calculating by assembling these particles one at a time:
: formula_12
where the following sum from, &quot;j&quot; = 1 to &quot;N&quot;, excludes &quot;i&quot; = &quot;j&quot;:
: formula_13

This electric potential, formula_14 is what would be measured at formula_15 if the charge formula_6 were missing. This formula obviously excludes the (infinite) energy that would be required to assemble each point charge from a disperse cloud of charge. The sum over charges can be converted into an integral over charge density using the prescription formula_17:
: formula_18

This second expression for electrostatic energy uses the fact that the electric field is the negative gradient of the electric potential, as well as vector calculus identities in a way that resembles integration by parts. These two integrals for electric field energy seem to indicate two mutually exclusive formulas for electrostatic energy density, namely formula_19 and formula_20; they yield equal values for the total electrostatic energy only if both are integrated over all space.

=== Electrostatic pressure ===
On a conductor, a surface charge will experience a force in the presence of an electric field. This force is the average of the discontinuous electric field at the surface charge. This average in terms of the field just outside the surface amounts to:
: formula_21

This pressure tends to draw the conductor into the field, regardless of the sign of the surface charge.

<text>Georgism, in modern times also called Geoism, and known historically as the single tax movement, is an economic ideology holding that people should own the value that they produce themselves, while the economic rent derived from land—including from all natural resources, the commons, and urban locations—should belong equally to all members of society. Developed from the writings of American economist and social reformer Henry George, the Georgist paradigm seeks solutions to social and ecological problems based on principles of land rights and public finance that attempt to integrate economic efficiency with social justice.

Georgism is concerned with the distribution of economic rent caused by land ownership, natural monopolies, pollution rights, and control of the commons, including title of ownership for natural resources and other contrived privileges (e.g., intellectual property). Any natural resource that is inherently limited in supply can generate economic rent, but the classical and most significant example of land monopoly involves the extraction of common ground rent from valuable urban locations. Georgists argue that taxing economic rent is efficient, fair, and equitable. The main Georgist policy recommendation is a tax assessed on land value, arguing that revenues from a land value tax (LVT) can be used to reduce or eliminate existing taxes (such as on income, trade, or purchases) that are unfair and inefficient. Some Georgists also advocate for the return of surplus public revenue to the people by means of a basic income or citizen&#x27;s dividend.

Henry George popularized the concept of gaining public revenues mainly from land and natural resource privileges with his first book, &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; (1879). The philosophical basis of Georgism draws on thinkers such as John Locke, Baruch Spinoza, and Thomas Paine. Economists from Adam Smith and David Ricardo to Milton Friedman and Joseph Stiglitz have observed that a public levy on land value does not cause economic inefficiency, unlike other taxes. A land value tax also has progressive tax effects. Advocates of land value taxes argue that they reduce economic inequality, increase economic efficiency, remove incentives to under-utilize urban land, and reduce property speculation.

Georgist ideas were popular and influential during the late 19th and early 20th centuries. Political parties, institutions, and communities were founded on Georgist principles during that time. Early devotees of George&#x27;s economic philosophy were often termed &quot;Single Taxers&quot; for their political goal of raising public revenue mainly or only from a land-value tax, although Georgists endorsed multiple forms of rent capture (e.g. seigniorage) as legitimate. The term &quot;Georgism&quot; was invented later, and some prefer the term &quot;geoism&quot; as more generic.

== Main tenets ==
Henry George is best known for popularizing the argument that government should be funded by a tax on land rent rather than taxes on labor. George believed that although scientific experiments could not be performed in political economy, theories could be tested by comparing different societies with different conditions and by thought experiments about the effects of various factors. Applying this method, he concluded that many of the problems that beset society, such as poverty, inequality, and economic booms and busts, could be attributed to the private ownership of the necessary resource: land rent. In his most celebrated book, &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;, George argues that the appropriation of land rent for private use contributes to persistent poverty in spite of technological progress, and causes economies to exhibit a tendency toward boom-and-bust cycles. According to George, people justly own what they create, but natural opportunities and land belong equally to all.
George believed there was an important distinction between common and collective property. Although equal rights to land might be achieved by nationalizing land and then leasing it to private users, George preferred taxing unimproved land value and leaving the control of land mostly in private hands. George&#x27;s reasoning for leaving land in private control and slowly shifting to land value tax was that it would not penalize existing owners who had improved land and would also be less disruptive and controversial in a country where land titles have already been granted.

Georgists have observed that privately created wealth is socialized via the tax system (e.g., through income and sales tax), while socially created wealth in land values are privatized in the price of land titles and bank mortgages. The opposite would be the case if land rents replaced taxes on labor as the main source of public revenue; socially created wealth would become available for use by the community, while the fruits of labor would remain private. According to Georgists, a land value tax can be considered a user fee instead of a tax, since it is related to the market value of socially created locational advantage, the privilege to exclude others from locations. Assets consisting of commodified privilege can be considered as wealth since they have exchange value, similar to taxi medallions. A land value tax, charging fees for exclusive use of land, as a means of raising public revenue is also a progressive tax tending to reduce economic inequality, since it applies entirely to ownership of valuable land, which is correlated with income, and there is generally no means by which landlords can shift the tax burden onto tenants or laborers. Landlords are unable to pass the tax on to tenants because the supply and demand of rented land is unchanged. Because the supply of land is perfectly inelastic, land rents depend on what tenants are prepared to pay, rather than on the expenses of landlords, and so the tax cannot be passed on to tenants.

=== Economic properties ===
Standard economic theory suggests that a land value tax would be extremely efficient—unlike other taxes, it does not reduce economic productivity. Milton Friedman described Henry George&#x27;s tax on unimproved value of land as the &quot;least bad tax&quot;, since unlike other taxes, it would not impose an excess burden on economic activity (leading to zero or even negative &quot;deadweight loss&quot;); hence, a replacement of other more &quot;distortionary&quot; taxes with a land value tax would improve economic welfare. Joseph Stiglitz argues that value tax can improve the use of land and redirect investment toward productive, non-rent-seeking activities. Because land value tax would apply to foreign land speculators, the Australian Treasury estimated that land value tax was unique in having a negative marginal excess burden, meaning that it would increase long-run living standards.

It was Adam Smith who first noted the efficiency and distributional properties of a land value tax in his book &quot;The Wealth of Nations&quot;.
Benjamin Franklin and Winston Churchill made similar distributional and efficiency arguments for taxing land rents. They noted that the costs of taxes and the benefits of public spending always eventually apply to and enrich the owners of land. Therefore, they believed it would be best to defray public costs and recapture value of public spending by applying public charges directly to owners of land titles, rather than harming public welfare with taxes assessed against beneficial activities such as trade and labor.

Henry George wrote that his plan for a high land value tax would cause people &quot;to contribute to the public, not in proportion to what they produce ... but in proportion to the value of natural [common] opportunities that they hold [monopolize]&quot;. He went on to explain that &quot;by taking for public use that value which attaches to land by reason of the growth and improvement of the community&quot;, it would, &quot;make the holding of land unprofitable to the mere owner, and profitable only to the user&quot;.

A high land value tax would discourage speculators from holding valuable natural opportunities (like urban real estate) unused or only partially used. Henry George claimed this would have many benefits, including the reduction or elimination of tax burdens from poorer neighborhoods and agricultural districts; the elimination of a multiplicity of taxes and expensive obsolete government institutions; the elimination of corruption, fraud, and evasion with respect to the collection of taxes; the enablement of true free trade; the destruction of monopolies; the elevation of wages to the full value of labor; the transformation of labor-saving inventions into blessings for all; and the equitable distribution of comfort, leisure, and other advantages that are made possible by an advancing civilization. In this way, the vulnerability that market economies have to credit bubbles and property manias would be reduced.

=== Sources of economic rent and related policy interventions ===

Income flow resulting from payments for restricted access to natural opportunities or for contrived privileges over geographic regions is termed economic rent. Georgists argue that economic rent of land, legal privileges, and natural monopolies should accrue to the community, rather than private owners. In economics, &quot;land&quot; is everything that exists in nature independent of human activity. George explicitly included climate, soil, waterways, mineral deposits, laws/forces of nature, public ways, forests, oceans, air, and solar energy in the category of land. While the philosophy of Georgism does not say anything definitive about specific policy interventions needed to address problems posed by various sources of economic rent, the common goal among modern Georgists is to capture and share (or reduce) rent from all sources of natural monopoly and legal privilege.

Henry George shared the goal of modern Georgists to socialize or dismantle rent from all forms of land monopoly and legal privilege. However, George emphasized mainly his preferred policy known as land value tax, which targeted a particular form of unearned income known as ground rent. George emphasized ground-rent because basic locations were more valuable than other monopolies and everybody needed locations to survive, which he contrasted with the less significant streetcar and telegraph monopolies, which George also criticized. George likened the problem to a laborer traveling home who is waylaid by a series of highway robbers along the way, each who demand a small portion of the traveler&#x27;s wages, and finally at the very end of the road waits a robber who demands all that the traveler has left. George reasoned that it made little difference to challenge the series of small robbers when the final robber remained to demand all that the common laborer had left. George predicted that over time technological advancements would increase the frequency and importance of lesser monopolies, yet he expected that ground rent would remain dominant. George even predicted that ground-rents would rise faster than wages and income to capital, a prediction that modern analysis has shown to be plausible, since the supply of land is fixed.

Spatial rent is still the primary emphasis of Georgists because of its large value and the known dis-economies of misused land. However, there are other sources of rent that are theoretically analogous to ground-rent and are debated topics of Georgists. The following are some sources of economic rent.
* Extractable resources (minerals and hydrocarbons)
* Severables (forests and stocks of fish)
* Extraterrestrial domains (geosynchronous orbits and airway corridor use)
* Legal privileges that apply to specific location (taxi medallions, billboard and development permits, or the monopoly of electromagnetic frequencies)
* Restrictions/taxes of pollution or severance (tradable emission permits and fishing quotas)
* Right-of-way (transportation) used by railroads, utilities, and internet service providers
* Issuance of legal tender (see seigniorage)
* Privileges that are less location dependent but that still exclude others from natural opportunities (patents)

Where free competition is impossible, such as telegraphs, water, gas, and transportation, George wrote, &quot;[S]uch business becomes a proper social function, which should be controlled and managed by and for the whole people concerned.&quot; Georgists were divided by this question of natural monopolies and often favored public ownership only of the rents from common rights-of-way, rather than public ownership of utility companies themselves.

=== Georgism and environmental economics ===
The early conservationism of the Progressive Era was inspired partly by Henry George, and his influence extended for decades afterward. Some ecological economists still support the Georgist policy of land value tax as a means of freeing or rewilding unused land and conserving nature by reducing urban sprawl.

Pollution degrades the value of what Georgists consider to be commons. Because pollution is a negative contribution, a taking from the commons or a cost imposed on others, its value is economic rent, even when the polluter is not receiving an explicit income. Therefore, to the extent that society determines pollution to be harmful, most Georgists propose to limit pollution with taxation or quotas that capture the resulting rents for public use, restoration, or a &quot;citizen&#x27;s dividend&quot;.

Georgism is related to the school of ecological economics, since both propose market-based restrictions for pollution. The schools are compatible in that they advocate using similar tools as part of a conservation strategy, but they emphasize different aspects. Conservation is a central issue of ecology, whereas economic rent is the central issue of geoism. Ecological economists might price pollution fines more conservatively to prevent inherently unquantifiable damage to the environment, whereas Georgists might emphasize mediation between conflicting interests and human rights. Geolibertarianism, a market-oriented branch of Geoism, tends to take a direct stance against what it perceives as burdensome regulation and would like to see auctioned pollution quotas or taxes replace most command and control regulation.

Since ecologists are primarily concerned with conservation, they tend to emphasize less the issue of equitably distributing scarcity/pollution rents, whereas Georgists insist that unearned income not accrue to those who hold title to natural assets and pollution privilege. To the extent that geoists recognize the effect of pollution or share conservationist values, they will agree with ecological economists about the need to limit pollution, but geoists will also insist that pollution rents generated from those conservation efforts do not accrue to polluters and are instead used for public purposes or to compensate those who suffer the negative effects of pollution. Ecological economists advocate similar pollution restrictions but, emphasizing conservation first, might be willing to grant private polluters the privilege to capture pollution rents. To the extent that ecological economists share the geoist view of social justice, they would advocate auctioning pollution quotas instead of giving them away for free. This distinction can be seen in the difference between basic cap and trade and the geoist variation, cap and share, a proposal to auction temporary pollution permits, with rents going to the public, instead of giving pollution privilege away for free to existing polluters or selling perpetual permits.

=== Revenue uses ===
The revenue can allow the reduction or elimination of taxes, greater public investment/spending, or the direct distribution of funds to citizens as a pension or basic income/citizen&#x27;s dividend.

In practice, the elimination of all other taxes implies a high land value tax, greater than any currently existing land tax. Introducing or increasing a land value tax would cause the purchase price of land to decrease. George did not believe landowners should be compensated and described the issue as being analogous to compensation for former slave owners. Other geoists disagree on the question of compensation; some advocate complete compensation while others endorse only enough compensation required to achieve Georgist reforms. Some geoists advocate compensation only for a net loss due to a shift of taxation to land value; most taxpayers would gain from the replacement of other taxes with a tax on land value. Historically, those who advocated for taxes on rent tax only great enough to replace other taxes were known as endorsers of &quot;single tax limited&quot;.

== Synonyms and variants ==

Most early advocacy groups described themselves as single taxers and George reluctantly accepted the single tax as an accurate name for his main political goal—the repeal of all unjust or inefficient taxes, to be replaced with a land value tax (LVT).

Some modern proponents are dissatisfied with the name &quot;Georgist&quot;. While Henry George was well known throughout his life, he has been largely forgotten by the public and the idea of a single tax of land predates him. Some now prefer the term &quot;geoism&quot;, with &quot;geo&quot; (from Greek &quot;earth, land&quot;) being the first compound of the name &quot;George&quot; &lt; (Gr.) &lt; &quot;farmer&quot; or &quot;agriculture, farming&quot; &lt; + &quot;work&quot; deliberately ambiguous. The terms &quot;Earth Sharing&quot;, &quot;geonomics&quot; and &quot;geolibertarianism&quot; are also used by some Georgists. These terms represent a difference of emphasis and sometimes real differences about how land rent should be spent (citizen&#x27;s dividend or just replacing other taxes), but they all agree that land rent should be recovered from its private recipients.

Compulsory fines and fees related to land rents are the most common Georgist policies, but some geoists prefer voluntary value capture systems that rely on methods such as non-compulsory or self-assessed location value fees, community land trusts and purchasing land value covenants. Some geoists believe that partially compensating landowners is a politically expedient compromise necessary for achieving reform. For similar reasons, others propose capturing only future land value increases, instead of all land rent.

Some libertarians and minarchists take the position that limited social spending should be financed using Georgist concepts of rent value capture, but that not all land rent should be captured. Today, this relatively conservative adaptation is usually considered incompatible with true geolibertarianism, which requires that excess rents be gathered and then distributed back to residents. During Henry George&#x27;s time, this restrained Georgist philosophy was known as &quot;single tax limited&quot;, as opposed to &quot;single tax unlimited.&quot; George disagreed with the limited interpretation, but he accepted its adherents (e.g., Thomas Shearman) as legitimate &quot;single-taxers.&quot;

== Influence ==

Georgist ideas heavily influenced the politics of the early 20th century. Political parties that were formed based on Georgist ideas include the Commonwealth Land Party in the United States, the Henry George Justice Party in Victoria, the Single Tax League in South Australia, and the Justice Party in Denmark.

In the United Kingdom, George&#x27;s writings were praised by emerging socialist groups in 1890s such as the Independent Labour Party and the Fabian Society, which would each go on to help form the modern-day Labour Party. The Liberal government included a land tax as part of several taxes in the 1909 People&#x27;s Budget intended to redistribute wealth (including a progressively graded income tax and an increase of inheritance tax). This caused a political crisis that resulted indirectly in reform of the House of Lords. The budget was passed eventually—but without the land tax. In 1931, the minority Labour government passed a land value tax as part III of the 1931 Finance act. However, this was repealed in 1934 by the National Government before it could be implemented.

In Denmark, the Georgist Justice Party has previously been represented in Folketinget. It formed part of a centre-left government 1957–60 and was also represented in the European Parliament 1978–1979. The influence of Henry George has waned over time, but Georgist ideas still occasionally emerge in politics. For the United States 2004 presidential election, third-party presidential candidate Ralph Nader mentioned George in his policy statements.

Economists still generally favor a land value tax. Monetarist economist Milton Friedman publicly endorsed the Georgist land value tax as the &quot;least bad tax&quot;. Economist Joseph Stiglitz stated that: &quot;Not only was Henry George correct that a tax on land is non-distortionary, but in an equilibrium society … tax on land raises just enough revenue to finance the (optimally chosen) level of government expenditure.&quot; He dubbed this proposition the Henry George theorem.

=== Communities ===

Several communities were initiated with Georgist principles during the height of the philosophy&#x27;s popularity. Two such communities that still exist are Arden, Delaware, which was founded in 1900 by Frank Stephens and William Lightfoot Price, and Fairhope, Alabama, which was founded in 1894 under the auspices of the Fairhope Single Tax Corporation. Some established communities in the United States also adopted Georgist tax policies. A Georgist in Houston, Texas, Joseph Jay &quot;J.J.&quot; Pastoriza, promoted a Georgist club in that city established in 1890. Years later, in his capacity as a city alderman, he was selected to serve as Houston Tax Commissioner, and promulgated a &quot;Houston Plan of Taxation&quot; in 1912. Improvements to land and merchants&#x27; inventories were taxed at 25 percent of the appraised value, unimproved land was taxed at 70 percent of appraisal, and personal property was exempt. This was calculated using the Somers System. This Georgist tax continued until 1915, when two courts struck it down as violating the Texas Constitution in 1915. This quashed efforts in several other Texas cities towards implementing the Houston Plan: Beaumont, Corpus Christi, Galveston, San Antonio, and Waco.

The German protectorate of the Kiautschou Bay concession in Jiaozhou Bay, China, fully implemented Georgist policy. Its sole source of government revenue was the land value tax of six percent which it levied in its territory. The German colonial empire had previously had economic problems with its African colonies caused by land speculation. One of the main reasons for using the land value tax in Jiaozhou Bay was to eliminate such speculation, which the policy achieved. The colony existed as a German protectorate from 1898 until 1914, when seized by Japanese and British troops in World War I. In 1922, the territory was returned to the Republic of China.
Georgist ideas were also adopted to some degree in Australia, Hong Kong, Singapore, South Africa, South Korea, and Taiwan. In these countries, governments still levy some type of land value tax, albeit with exemptions. Many municipal governments of the United States depend on real-property tax as their main source of revenue, although such taxes are not Georgist as they generally include the value of buildings and other improvements. One exception is the town of Altoona, Pennsylvania, which for a time in the 21st century only taxed land value, phasing in the tax in 2002, relying on it entirely for tax revenue from 2011, and ending it 2017; the &quot;Financial Times&quot; noted that &quot;Altoona is using LVT in a city where neither land nor buildings have much value&quot;.

In 2023, Detroit mayor Mike Duggan and Michigan State Representative Stephanie Young proposed replacing existing property taxes with a land-value tax. Following the 2008 Recession and city&#x27;s 2013 bankruptcy, speculators bought cheap property, expecting to profit from the city&#x27;s recovery. This plan to shift the cost of municipal services to owners of empty land, while exempting community gardens and parks, will require approval from the Michigan Legislature and Detroit City Council before being added as a ballot measure for Detroit residents.

=== Institutes and organizations ===

Various organizations still exist that continue to promote the ideas of Henry George. According to &quot;The American Journal of Economics and Sociology&quot;, the periodical &quot;Land&amp;Liberty&quot;, established in 1894, is &quot;the longest-lived Georgist project in history&quot;. Founded during the Great Depression in 1932, the Henry George School of Social Science in New York offers courses, sponsors seminars, and publishes research in the Georgist paradigm. Also in the US, the Lincoln Institute of Land Policy was established in 1974 based on the writings of Henry George. It &quot;seeks to improve the dialogue about urban development, the built environment, and tax policy in the United States and abroad&quot;.

The Henry George Foundation continues to promote the ideas of Henry George in the United Kingdom. The IU is an international umbrella organisation that brings together organizations worldwide that seek land-value tax reform.

== Reception ==
The economist Alfred Marshall believed that George&#x27;s views in &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot; were dangerous, even predicting wars, terror, and economic destruction from the immediate implementation of its recommendations. Specifically, Marshall was upset about the idea of rapid change and the unfairness of not compensating existing landowners. In his lectures on &quot;Progress and Poverty&quot;, Marshall opposed George&#x27;s position on compensation while fully endorsing his ultimate remedy. So far as land value tax moderately replaced other taxes and did not cause the price of land to fall, Marshall supported land value taxation on economic and moral grounds, suggesting that a three or four percent tax on land values would fit this condition. After implementing land taxes, governments would purchase future land values at discounted prices and take ownership after 100 years. Marshall asserted that this plan, which he strongly supported, would end the need for a tax collection department of government. For newly formed countries where land was not already private, Marshall advocated implementing George&#x27;s economic proposal immediately.

Karl Marx considered the single-tax platform as a regression from the transition to communism and referred to Georgism as &quot;capitalism&#x27;s last ditch&quot;. Marx argued that, &quot;The whole thing is ... simply an attempt, decked out with socialism, to save capitalist domination and indeed to establish it afresh on an even wider basis than its present one.&quot; Marx also criticized the way land value tax theory emphasizes the value of land, arguing that George&#x27;s &quot;fundamental dogma is that everything would be all right if ground rent were paid to the state.&quot;

Richard T. Ely agreed with the economic arguments for Georgism but believed that correcting the problem the way Henry George wanted, without compensation, was unjust to existing landowners. In explaining his position, Ely wrote, &quot;If we have all made a mistake, should one party to the transaction alone bear the cost of the common blunder?&quot;

John R. Commons supported Georgist economics but opposed what he perceived as an environmentally and politically reckless tendency for advocates to rely on a one-size-fits-all approach to tax reform, specifically, the &quot;single tax&quot; framing. Commons concluded &quot;The Distribution of Wealth&quot;, with an estimate that &quot;perhaps 95% of the total values represented by these millionaire [&quot;sic&quot;] fortunes is due to those investments classed as land values and natural monopolies and to competitive industries aided by such monopolies&quot;, and that &quot;tax reform should seek to remove all burdens from capital and labour and impose them on monopolies.&quot; However, he criticized Georgists for failing to see that Henry George&#x27;s anti-monopoly ideas must be implemented with a variety of policy tools. Commons wrote, &quot;Trees do not grow into the sky—they would perish in a high wind; and a single truth, like a single tax, ends in its own destruction.&quot; Commons uses the natural soil fertility and value of forests as an example of this destruction, arguing that a tax on the in-situ value of those depletable natural resources can result in overuse or over-extraction. Instead, Commons recommends an income tax-based approach to forests similar to a modern Georgist severance tax.

Other contemporaries such as Austrian economist Frank Fetter and neoclassical economist John Bates Clark argued that it was impractical to maintain the traditional distinction between land and capital and used this as a basis to attack Georgism. Mark Blaug, a specialist in the history of economic thought, credits Fetter and Clark with influencing mainstream economists to abandon the idea &quot;that land is a unique factor of production and hence that there is any special need for a special theory of ground rent&quot; claiming that &quot;this is in fact the basis of all the attacks on Henry George by contemporary economists and certainly the fundamental reason why professional economists increasingly ignored him&quot;.

Robert Solow endorsed the theory of Georgism, while being wary of the perceived injustice of expropriation. Solow stated that taxing away expected land rents &quot;would have no semblance of fairness&quot;; however, Georgism would be good to introduce where location values were not already privatized or if the transition could be phased in slowly.

George has also been accused of exaggerating the importance of his &quot;all-devouring rent thesis&quot; in claiming that it is the primary cause of poverty and injustice in society. George argued that the rent of land increased faster than wages for labor because the supply of land is fixed. Modern economists, including Ottmar Edenhofer have demonstrated that George&#x27;s assertion is plausible but was more likely to be true during George&#x27;s time than now.

An early criticism of Georgism was that it would generate too much public revenue and result in unwanted growth of government, but later critics argued that it would not generate enough income to cover government spending. Joseph Schumpeter concluded his analysis of Georgism by stating that, &quot;It is not economically unsound, except that it involves an unwarranted optimism concerning the yield of such a tax.&quot; Economists who study land conclude that Schumpeter&#x27;s criticism is unwarranted because the rental yield from land is likely much greater than what modern critics such as Paul Krugman suppose. Krugman agrees that land value taxation is the best means of raising public revenue but asserts that increased spending has rendered land rent insufficient to fully fund government. Georgists have responded by citing studies and analyses implying that land values of nations like the United States, the United Kingdom and Australia are more than sufficient to fund all levels of government.

Anarcho-capitalist political philosopher and economist Murray Rothbard criticized Georgism in &quot;Man, Economy, and State&quot; as being philosophically incongruent with subjective value theory, and further stating that land is irrelevant in the factors of production, trade, and price systems, but this critique is seen by some, including other opponents of Georgism, as relying on false assumptions and flawed reasoning.

Austrian economist Friedrich Hayek credited early enthusiasm for Henry George with developing his interest in economics. Later, Hayek said that the theory of Georgism would be very strong if assessment challenges did not result in unfair outcomes, but he believed that they would.

Economists Bryan Caplan and Zachary Gochenour have argued that a 100% Georgist tax would destroy the incentive to search for natural resources and discover optimal locations for businesses, as the additional profits that would result from such discoveries would lead to a corresponding increase in the unimproved value of the land, and so be taxed away.

<doc id="368330" wikidata="Q1435880" url="?curid=368330" title="Demons &amp; Wizards (band)">
<text>Demons &amp; Wizards was a power metal band conceived as a side-project by Blind Guardian vocalist Hansi Kürsch and Jon Schaffer, the guitarist for Iced Earth. Schaffer wrote the music and Kürsch wrote the lyrics. The band&#x27;s line-up during the recording of their first album in 1999 (&quot;Demons &amp; Wizards&quot;) featured Mark Prator, who was the drummer on a few Iced Earth albums, and Jim Morris, who has engineered for Iced Earth before, on lead guitar. The personnel for the second album (&quot;Touched by the Crimson King&quot;), released in 2005, included Morris on lead guitar and Bobby Jarzombek on drums. The band released a third studio album, &quot;III&quot;, in 2020, and disbanded in early 2021.

==Band history==
===Band name===
The original goal of the band was to forge the different musical styles of both Iced Earth&#x27;s dark melodies and Blind Guardian&#x27;s powerful vocals into one sound. In fact, according to the musicians, the band name is meant to describe the two styles: the self-proclaimed demon-like themes and sounds of Iced Earth and wizard-like themes and sounds of Blind Guardian (the moniker &quot;Demons &amp; Wizards&quot; was inspired by Schaffer&#x27;s wife always referring to him and Hansi as &quot;Demons and Angels&quot;. Hansi always corrected her, since he claims to &quot;not be at all angelic&quot;, and that it is more properly stated &quot;Demons and Wizards&quot;, in reference to Uriah Heep&#x27;s album of the same name). The band met with a fair deal of commercial success, though not as much as either of their individual bands.

The idea for the band arose in the spring of 1997 when Kürsch and Schaffer wanted to make music together, after being friends for several years.

===Album information===
The band&#x27;s first full-length release was in 2000, with the self-titled album &quot;Demons &amp; Wizards&quot;. In 2005, the band released their second album entitled &quot;Touched by the Crimson King&quot;. &quot;Touched by the Crimson King&quot; is partially based on &quot;The Dark Tower&quot; series of books (written by Stephen King), in which the Crimson King is the main antagonist.

===Recent activity, touring, and third studio album===

In a March 2009 interview, when asked about what projects he would be working on after taking a vacation, guitarist Jon Schaffer stated:

On March 15, 2011, singer Hansi Kürsch posted an update on the official Blind Guardian website, containing the following news:

On February 13, 2015, in an interview when asked about Demons &amp; Wizards and his relationship with Jon Schaffer, Kürsch replied:

On May 15, 2017, Schaffer confirmed in an interview with Metal Wani that he was working with Kürsch on material for a new Demons &amp; Wizards album.

Demons &amp; Wizards have confirmed that they will be playing at the Hellfest festival in June 2019, at the Wacken Open Air festival in August 2019, will headline ProgPower USA in September 2019 and they began their first North American tour in August 2019.

In December 2019, the band announced their third studio album, &quot;III&quot;. It was released on February 21, 2020. The album was cited as one of Paul Stenning&#x27;s albums of the year for Brave Words.

=== Disbandment ===
On January 6, 2021, guitarist Jon Schaffer was photographed among the protesters who stormed the U.S. Capitol building in Washington, D.C. After appearing on the Most Wanted section of the FBI&#x27;s website, Schaffer turned himself in on January 17 and was held on six felony charges. Century Media dropped the band from their roster two days later. On February 1, 2021, vocalist Hansi Kürsch ended his collaboration with Schaffer.

<doc id="368332" wikidata="Q271807" url="?curid=368332" title="European serin">
<text>The European serin, or simply the serin (Serinus serinus), is the smallest species of the family of finches (Fringillidae) and is closely related to the Atlantic canary. Its diet consists mainly of a combination of buds and seeds.

==Taxonomy==
The European serin was described by Carl Linnaeus in 1766 in the 12th edition of his &quot;Systema Naturae&quot; under the binomial name &quot;Fringilla serinus&quot;. The Latin &quot;serinus&quot; comes from the French word &quot;serin&quot; for a canary. The French word may be a corruption of the Latin word &quot;citrinus&quot; meaning &quot;lemon-coloured&quot;.

==Description==
The European serin is a small short-tailed bird, 11–12 cm in length. The upper parts are dark-streaked greyish green, with a yellow rump. The yellow breast and white belly are also heavily streaked. The male has a brighter yellow face and breast, yellow wing bars and yellow tail sides. The song of this bird is a buzzing trill, very familiar in Mediterranean countries.

It breeds across southern and central Europe and North Africa. Southern and Atlantic coast populations are largely resident, but the northern breeders migrate further south in Europe for the winter. Open woodland and cultivation, often with some conifers, is favoured for breeding. It builds its nest in a shrub or tree, laying 3–5 eggs. It forms flocks outside the breeding season, sometimes mixed with other finches.

The food is mainly seeds, and, in the breeding season, insects. This small serin is an active and often conspicuous bird.

<doc id="368350" wikidata="Q1366532" url="?curid=368350" title="Crotalus cerastes">
<text>Crotalus cerastes, known as the sidewinder, horned rattlesnake or sidewinder rattlesnake, is a pit viper species belonging to the genus &quot;Crotalus&quot; (the rattlesnakes), and is found in the desert regions of the Southwestern United States and northwestern Mexico. Like all other pit vipers, it is venomous. Three subspecies are currently recognized.

==Description==
A small species, adult specimens measure between in length. The females are larger than the males, which is unusual for this group of snakes.

Usually, 21 rows of keeled dorsal scales occur midbody. Males have 141 or fewer ventral scales; females have 144 or fewer. It is sometimes referred to as the horned rattlesnake because of the raised supraocular scales above its eyes. This adaptation may help shade the eyes or prevent sand drifting over them as the snake lies almost buried in it. As only pressure on top of the horns will cause them to fold down, it is concluded that they strike against the roof of rodent burrows to protect their eyes. 

The color pattern consists of a ground color that may be cream, buff, yellowish-brown, pink, or ash gray, overlaid with 28–47 dorsal blotches subrhombic or subelliptical in shape. In the nominate subspecies, the belly is white and the proximal lobe of the rattle is brown in adults. Klauber and Neill describe the ability of this species to display different coloration depending on the temperature—a process known as metachrosis.

==Common names==
Common names include sidewinder, horned rattlesnake, sidewinder rattlesnake, Mojave Desert sidewinder (for &quot;C. c. cerastes&quot;), and sidewinder rattler.

==Subspecies==
==Habitat==
In the Southwestern United States, this species is found in the desert region of southeastern California, southern Nevada, southwestern Utah, and western Arizona. In northwestern Mexico, it is found in western Sonora and eastern Baja California.

==Conservation status==
This species is classified as least concern on the IUCN Red List (v3.1, 2001). Species are listed as such due to their wide distribution, presumed large population, or because they are unlikely to be declining fast enough to qualify for listing in a more threatened category. The population trend was stable when assessed in 2007.

==Behavior==
The common name sidewinder alludes to its unusual form of locomotion, which is thought to give it traction on windblown desert sand, but this peculiar locomotor specialization is used on any substrate over which the sidewinder can move rapidly. As its body progresses over loose sand, it forms a letter J-shaped impression, with the tip of the hook pointing in the direction of travel. Sidewinding is also the primary mode of locomotion in other desert sand dwellers, such as the horned adder (&quot;Bitis caudalis&quot;) and Peringuey&#x27;s adder (&quot;Bitis peringueyi&quot;), but many other snakes can assume this form of locomotion when on slick substrates (e.g., mud flats). Sidewinder rattlesnakes can use sidewinding to ascend sandy slopes by increasing the portion of the body in contact with the sand to match the reduced yielding force of the inclined sand, allowing them to ascend up to the maximum possible sand slope without slip. In cybernetics, incorporating this control scheme into a snakebot can enable the robot to replicate sidewinding movement. Activity range does not change with sex or body size.

The species is nocturnal during hot months and diurnal during the cooler months of its activity period, which is roughly from November to March (probably longer in the southern part of its range).

Juveniles use their tails to attract lizard prey, a behavior termed &quot;caudal luring&quot;. Adults lose this behavior as they make the transition from lizard prey to their primary diet of desert rodents, birds, and other snakes. Sidewinder juveniles appear to mimic both life stages of lepidopterans in their luring motions. Their fast luring motions resemble the fluttering of a moth, and their slower tail movements resemble a caterpillar. Both movements have been observed to attract prey lizards.

Neonatal sidewinders engage in a remarkable behavioral homeothermy that has not been observed in any other type of snake. Following birth, the neonates mass together in their natal burrow. Most often, gravid females select an east-facing, small-diameter rodent burrow for giving birth. For the first week or so of their lives, neonatal sidewinders plug the entrance to this burrow during daylight hours, forming a dynamic multiple-individual mass that takes advantage of the hot exterior environment and the cool interior of the burrow to maintain an average aggregate temperature of 32 °C (the optimal temperature for shedding). The dynamic mass of neonates modifies the thermal environment at the burrow entrance such that the young can occupy a location that would ordinarily become lethally hot for an individual neonate (or even an adult). Because of the constant movements of the neonates, the aggregate assumes stable temperature properties reminiscent of a homeothermic organism (i.e., maintains tight temperature tolerance ± 2 °C).

==Reproduction==
Females produce up to 18 young, with an average of about 10 per litter. Like most other viperids, the young are born enveloped in thin embryonic membranes, from which they emerge shortly after being expelled from the mother. The young stay with their mother in a burrow for 7–10 days, shed for the first time, then leave their natal burrow. During this time, the mother is thought to guard and protect them from predators.

Sidewinders mature at 2–3 years of age, are capable of reproducing annually, and give birth to live young. Some females skip reproductive opportunities. Some might even skip two years if the food supply is scarce. Sidewinders mate in April through May and sometimes in fall. When the male and female mate, the male snake crawls along the female&#x27;s back, rubbing her with his chin to stimulate or arouse her. The male then will wrap his tail around her tail, and then will try to bring their cloacae together. The cloaca is the posterior body opening through which snakes both excrete waste and reproduce. If the female wants to mate, she lifts her tail and allows him to mate with her. The snakes can mate for several hours, and if one of the snakes decides to move, the other is dragged along. Females might mate with several males in a season. Females give birth to five to 18 young in late summer to early fall. The young are born 6-8 inches long. The birth takes only 2–3 hours altogether. Within a few minutes of being born, the newborn sidewinder escapes from a thin, transparent membrane. The young stay at their natal burrow for 7–10 days until they shed, and then they disappear and have no future contact with their mother or their littermates. While the density of sidewinders can be up to one individual per hectare, they rarely encounter each other except during mating season.

Sidewinders have an extraordinarily accelerated lifecycle, with natural life expectancies of females of about 5 years. Males may live quite a bit longer (maximum known natural lifespan of 13 years). Sidewinders can live more than 20 years when well fed in captivity (even females). Thus, energetics apparently factor heavily into natural female mortality, whereas predation might be the primary pressure on males. In the wild, females often die of exhaustion after giving birth, but the lives of sidewinders are also cut short by predation, diseases, and vehicle encounters.

==Venom==
These snakes are venomous, but possess a weaker venom than many other rattlesnakes. This, together with the smaller size of their venom glands, makes them less dangerous than their larger relatives. Regardless, any rattlesnake bite can be fatal and should be taken seriously and medical attention sought immediately.

Norris (2004) lists these venom yields: 33 mg average and 63 mg maximum (Klauber, 1956), and 30 mg average and 80 mg maximum (Glenn &amp; Straight, 1982). Brown (1973) gives a venom yield of 33 mg (Klauber, 1956) and values for mice of 2.6 mg/kg IV, 3.0, 4.0, 2.3 mg/kg IP and 5.5 mg/kg SC for toxicity. With these figures, Brown calculated that the LD50 for an adult human being weighing 70 kg would be 385 mg (SC).

Envenomation can cause pain, swelling, hemorrhagic bleb formation, and ecchymosis (&quot;i.e.&quot;, bruising). Swelling, while not particularly severe, occasionally may involve entire limbs and the trunk. Envenomation&#x27;s systemic symptoms include nausea, dizziness, chills, coagulopathy (blood disorders), and shock. Klauber (1997) includes an account of a man who had been bitten on the first joint of the index finger of the right hand, with only a single fang penetrating. Although the bite was described as no more painful than a pin prick, a doctor was seen within about 25 minutes, and 10 cm3 of antivenin were administered. Within 2.5 hours, his entire arm was swollen and the pain was severe, &quot;as if the arm were soaked in a bucket of boiling oil.&quot;

Ovine-derived antivenom, CroFab, for North American pit viper envenomation, has been widely available since 2001. Consultation with a local expert or regional poison control center should be obtained before administering antivenom. The previous antivenin (ACP) is no longer manufactured.

<doc id="368356" wikidata="Q423870" url="?curid=368356" title="Methylisothiazolinone">
<text>Methylisothiazolinone (), MIT, or MI, is the organic compound with the formula S(CH)2C(O)NCH3. It is a white solid. Isothiazolinones, a class of heterocycles, are used as biocides in numerous personal care products and other industrial applications. MIT and related compounds have attracted much attention for their allergenic properties, e.g. contact dermatitis.

== Chemistry ==
It is prepared by cyclization of &quot;cis&quot;-&quot;N&quot;-methyl-3-thiocyanoacrylamide:
The crystal and molecular structure of methylisothiazolinone, as determined by in situ cryocrystallography, was reported for the first time in 2024.

== Applications ==

Methylisothiazolinone is used for controlling microbial growth in water-containing solutions. It is typically used in a formulation with 5-chloro-2-methyl-4-isothiazolin-3-one (CMIT), in a 3:1 mixture (CMIT:MIT) sold commercially as &quot;Kathon&quot;. Kathon is supplied to manufacturers as a concentrated stock solution containing from 1.5 to 15% of CMIT/MIT.
Kathon also has been used to control slime in the manufacture of paper products that contact food. In addition, this product serves as an antimicrobial agent in latex adhesives and in paper coatings that also contact food.

== Hazards ==
MIT is allergenic and cytotoxic, and this has led to some concern over its use. A report released by the European Scientific Committee on Cosmetic Products and Non-food Products Intended for Consumers (SCCNFP) in 2003 also concluded that insufficient information was available to allow for an adequate risk assessment analysis of MIT.

Rising reports of consumer impact led to new research, including a report released in 2014 by the European Commission Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety which reported: 

The American Contact Dermatitis Society named methylisothiazolinone &quot;contact allergen of the year&quot; in 2013. The North American Contact Dermatitis Group found that methylisothiazolinone caused 10.9% positive reactions, being the third most common contact allergen in patch test results which surveyed close to 5000 contact dermatitis patients. Additionally, new research into cross reactivity of MIT-sensitized patients to variants benzisothiazolinone and octylisothiazolinone have found that reactions may occur if present in sufficient amounts.

In the United States, the Environmental Protection Agency has a 1998 data sheet on methylisothiazolinone in their Pesticides section which reads in part &quot;Human Health Assessment: Toxicity: In studies using laboratory animals, methylisothiazolinone has been shown to be of moderate acute toxicity by the oral and inhalation routes. It is highly acutely toxic when applied dermally or to the eye and is considered to be corrosive.&quot;

== Regulation ==
In 2014, the European Commission Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety further issued a voluntary ban on the MCI/MI mixture from leave-on products such as body creams. The measure applied for products placed on the market after 16 July 2015.&quot; Shortly thereafter, Canada moved to adopt similar measures in its Cosmetic Ingredients Hotlist.

Based on the opinion of the Scientific Committee on Consumer Safety (SCCS) of 2013, Commission Regulation (EU) 2016/1198 of 22 July 2016 amending Annex V to Regulation (EC) No 1223/2009 of the European Parliament and of the council on cosmetic products banned the use of methylisothiazolinone in leave-on products (skin creams and lotions) effective 12 February 2017 and limited it to 0.01% in rinse-off products (e.g. shampoo). Effective 27 January 2018 (placing on the market), the maximum concentration in rinse-off products was reduced to 0.0015%.

<doc id="368358" wikidata="Q522582" url="?curid=368358" title="Penny Singleton">
<text>Penny Singleton (born Mariana Dorothy McNulty, September 15, 1908 – November 12, 2003) was an American actress and labor leader. During her six decade career on stage, screen, radio and television, Singleton appeared as the comic-strip heroine Blondie Bumstead in a series of 28 motion pictures from 1938 until 1950 and the popular &quot;Blondie&quot; radio program from 1939 until 1950. Singleton also provided the voice of Jane Jetson in the animated series &quot;The Jetsons&quot; from 1962 to 1963.

Behind the scenes, Singleton was the first woman to serve as president of an AFL-CIO union, and served two terms as president of the American Guild of Variety Artists. She testified before a Senate subcommittee in 1962 on the union&#x27;s treatment of women variety workers, and led a strike of the Radio City Rockettes in 1967.

== Early life ==
Singleton was born in Philadelphia, Pennsylvania. She began performing professionally as a child, and only completed sixth grade in her schooling.

== Career ==

Singleton sang at a silent movie theater, and toured in vaudeville as part of an act called &quot;The Kiddie Kabaret&quot;. She sang and danced with Milton Berle, whom she had known since childhood, and actor Gene Raymond, and appeared on Broadway in Jack Benny&#x27;s &quot;The Great Temptations&quot;. She also toured nightclubs and in roadshows of plays and musicals.

Singleton appeared as a brunette nightclub singer in &quot;After the Thin Man&quot;, credited as Dorothy McNulty. She was cast opposite Arthur Lake (as Dagwood) in the feature film &quot;Blondie&quot; in 1938, based on the comic strip by Chic Young. They repeated their roles on a radio comedy beginning in 1939 and in guest appearances on other radio shows. As Dagwood and Blondie Bumstead, they proved so popular that a succession of 27 sequels was made from 1938 until 1950, with the radio show ending the same year. Singleton&#x27;s husband Robert Sparks produced 12 of these sequels. Also in 1950, she had her own program, &quot;The Penny Singleton Show&quot;, on NBC radio.

Singleton held top billing in &quot;Go West, Young Lady&quot; (1941), over her male co-star, Glenn Ford. Only two other female stars (Dorothy Page and Jane Frazee) were top-billed singing cowgirls at the time.

One of her last live-action roles was as Jessica Fletcher&#x27;s Aunt Mildred on the &quot;Murder, She Wrote&quot; episode &quot;The Perfect Foil&quot; (1986).

She provided the voice of Jane Jetson in the 1962–63 animated series, &quot;The Jetsons&quot;. From 1985 to 1987, Singleton reprised her role for the new seasons of &quot;The Jetsons&quot;. She also played Jane in &quot;The Jetsons Meet the Flintstones&quot; (1987), &quot;Rockin&#x27; with Judy Jetson&quot; (1988) and &quot;&quot; (1990).

== Labor activism ==
Singleton was active in union affairs as a vocal member of the American Guild of Variety Artists (AGVA). She was elected president of the AGVA in 1958–1959, and again in 1969–1970. Her union membership was suspended in 1962, when she was accused of slandering some of the union&#x27;s officers, and she countersued. Singleton was reinstated as a union member in 1963, after the dispute reached a legal settlement.

She testified on the exploitation of women in variety work, and the union&#x27;s shortcomings in representing those workers, before a United States Senate subcommittee in 1962. &quot;I charge here and now that the exotic and strip artists have been abandoned and made outcasts by the very union to which they pay dues for representation and protection,&quot; she announced to the subcommittee.

In 1967, she led a successful month-long strike by the Radio City Rockettes for better working conditions. During her presidency, she led negotiations with the Disney on Parade show (NAWAL Productions) during a variety artists&#x27; strike in the 1970 Disney on Parade (DOP) show – a joint venture between Walt Disney and NBC, and one of the most successful touring arena shows ever, with tours all over the world. With over 100 cast members, she led a slowdown in the performance in Hershey, Pennsylvania, followed by a walkout in Ft. Wayne, Indiana, and a settlement the next week in Houston, Texas. 
The issue was purportedly that the 16&quot; support stage used by the dancers was cut from the show to reduce trucking costs. The stage, which was laid down on the arena floor without the support, caused the dancers to reportedly get shin splints. The strike was settled and the show went on in Houston.

==Personal life and legacy==
Singleton married Laurence Scroggs Singleton, a dentist, in 1937; although they divorced in 1939, she kept his surname. She remarried, to Robert C. Sparks, a Marine Corps officer and film producer, in 1941. They remained wed until his death in 1963. Singleton had two daughters, Dorothy and Susan. She was a lifelong Catholic.

Singleton was a charter member of the Hollywood Republican Committee and campaigned for Republicans Thomas E. Dewey in 1948 and Richard Nixon in 1960.

For her contributions to both radio and the motion-picture industry, in 1960, Singleton was honored with two stars during her induction to the Hollywood Walk of Fame. Her star for radio is located at 6811 Hollywood Boulevard, and her film star is at 6547 Hollywood Boulevard.

==Death==
On November 12, 2003, Singleton died at the age of 95 of respiratory failure in Sherman Oaks, California. She was buried at San Fernando Cemetery.

<text>In social behavior, downshifting is a trend where individuals adopt simpler lives from what critics call the &quot;rat race&quot;.

The long-term effect of downshifting can include an escape from what has been described as economic materialism, as well as reduce the &quot;stress and psychological expense that may accompany economic materialism&quot;. This new social trend emphasizes finding an improved balance between leisure and work, while also focusing life goals on personal fulfillment, as well as building personal relationships instead of the all-consuming pursuit of economic success.

Downshifting, as a concept, shares characteristics with simple living. However, it is distinguished as an alternative form by its focus on moderate change and concentration on an individual comfort level and a gradual approach to living. In the 1990s, this new form of simple living began appearing in the mainstream media, and has continually grown in popularity among populations living in industrial societies, especially the United States, the United Kingdom, New Zealand, and Australia, as well as Russia.

==Values and motives==
&quot;Down-shifters&quot; refers to people who adopt long-term voluntary simplicity in their lives. A few of the main practices of down-shifters include accepting less money for fewer hours worked, while placing an emphasis on consuming less in order to reduce their ecological footprint. One of the main results of these practices is being able to enjoy more leisure time in the company of others, especially loved ones.

The primary motivations for downshifting are gaining leisure time, escaping from work-and-spend cycle, and removing the clutter of unnecessary possessions. The personal goals of downshifting are simple: To reach a holistic self-understanding and satisfying meaning in life.

Because of its personalized nature and emphasis on many minor changes, rather than complete lifestyle overhaul, downshifting attracts participants from across the socioeconomic spectrum. An intrinsic consequence of downshifting is increased time for non-work-related activities, which, combined with the diverse demographics of downshifters, cultivates higher levels of civic engagement and social interaction.

The scope of participation is limitless, because all members of society—adults, children, businesses, institutions, organizations, and governments—are able to downshift even if many demographic strata do not start &quot;high&quot; enough to &quot;down&quot;-shift.

In practice, down-shifting involves a variety of behavioral and lifestyle changes. The majority of these down-shifts are voluntary choices. Natural life course events, such as the loss of a job, or birth of a child can prompt involuntary down-shifting. There is also a temporal dimension, because a down-shift could be either temporary or permanent.

==Methods==

===Work and income===
The most common form of down-shifting is work (or income) down-shifting. Down-shifting is fundamentally based on dissatisfaction with the conditions and consequences of the workplace environment. The philosophy of work-to-live replaces the social ideology of live-to-work. Reorienting economic priorities shifts the work–life balance away from the workplace.

Economically, work downshifts are defined in terms of reductions in either actual or potential income, work hours, and spending levels. Following a path of earnings that is lower than the established market path is a downshift in potential earnings in favor of gaining other non-material benefits.

On an individual level, work downshifting is a voluntary reduction in annual income. Downshifters desire meaning in life outside of work and, therefore, will opt to decrease the amount of time spent at work or work hours. Reducing the number of hours of work, consequently, lowers the amount earned. Simply not working overtime or taking a half-day a week for leisure time, are work downshifts.

Career downshifts are another way of downshifting economically and entail lowering previous aspirations of wealth, a promotion or higher social status. Quitting a job to work locally in the community, from home or to start a business are examples of career downshifts. Although more radical, these changes do not mean stopping work altogether.

Many reasons are cited by workers for this choice and usually center on a personal cost–benefit analysis of current working situations and desired extracurricular activities. High stress, pressure from employers to increase productivity, and long commutes can be factors that contribute to the costs of being employed. If the down-shifter wants more non-material benefits like leisure time, a healthy family life, or personal freedom then switching jobs could be a desirable option.

Work down-shifting may also be a key to considerable health benefits as well as a healthy retirement. People are retiring later in life than previous generations. As can be seen by looking at The Health and Retirement Study, done by the Health and Retirement Study Survey Research Center, women can show the long term health benefits of down-shifting their work lives by working part time hours over a long period of years. Men however prove to be more unhealthy if they work part time from middle age till retirement. Men who down-shift their work life to part time hours at the age of 60 to 65 however benefit from continuing to work a part-time job through a semi retirement even over the age of 70. This is an example of how flexible working policies can be a key to being healthy while in retirement.

===Spending habits===
Another aspect of down-shifting is being a conscious consumer or actively practicing alternative forms of consumption. Proponents of down-shifting point to consumerism as a primary source of stress and dissatisfaction because it creates a society of individualistic consumers who measure both social status and general happiness by an unattainable quantity of material possessions. Instead of buying goods for personal satisfaction, consumption down-shifting, purchasing only the necessities, is a way to focus on quality of life rather than quantity.

This realignment of spending priorities promotes the functional utility of goods over their ability to convey status which is evident in downshifters being generally less brand-conscious. These consumption habits also facilitate the option of working and earning less because annual spending is proportionally lower. Reducing spending is less demanding than more extreme downshifts in other areas, like employment, as it requires only minor lifestyle changes.

===Policies that enable downshifting===
Unions, business, and governments could implement more flexible working hours, part-time work, and other non-traditional work arrangements that enable people to work less, while still maintaining employment. Small business legislation, reduced filing requirements and reduced tax rates encourage small-scale individual entrepreneurship and therefore help individuals quit their jobs altogether and work for themselves on their own terms.

===Environmental consequences===
The catch-phrase of International Downshifting Week is &quot;Slow Down and Green Up&quot;. Whether intentional or unintentional, generally, the choices and practices of down-shifters nurture environmental health because they reject the fast-paced lifestyle fueled by fossil fuels and adopt more sustainable lifestyles. The latent function of consumption down-shifting is to reduce, to some degree, the carbon footprint of the individual down-shifter. An example is to shift from a corporate suburban rat race lifestyle to a small eco friendly farming lifestyle.

===Down-shifting geographically===
Downshifting geographically is a relocation to a smaller, rural, or more slow-paced community. This is often a response to the hectic pace of life and stresses in urban areas. It is a significant change but does not bring total removal from mainstream culture.

==Sociopolitical implications==
Although downshifting is primarily motivated by personal desire and not by a conscious political stance, it does define societal overconsumption as the source of much personal discontent. By redefining life satisfaction in non-material terms, downshifters assume an alternative lifestyle but continue to coexist in a society and political system preoccupied with the economy. In general, downshifters are politically apathetic because mainstream politicians mobilize voters by proposing governmental solutions to periods of financial hardship and economic recessions. This economic rhetoric is meaningless to downshifters who have forgone worrying about money.

In the United States, the UK, and Australia, a significant minority, approximately 20 to 25 percent, of these countries&#x27; citizens identify themselves in some respect as downshifters. Downshifting is not an isolated or unusual choice. Politics still centers around consumerism and unrestricted growth, but downshifting values, such as family priorities and workplace regulation, appear in political debates and campaigns.

Like downshifters, the Cultural Creatives is another social movement whose ideology and practices diverge from mainstream consumerism and according to Paul Ray, are followed by at least a quarter of U.S. citizens.

In his book &quot;In Praise of Slowness&quot;, Carl Honoré relates followers of downshifting and simple living to the global slow movement.

The significant number and diversity of downshifters are a challenge to economic approaches to improving society. The rise in popularity of downshifting and similar, post-materialist ideologies represents unorganized social movements without political aspirations or motivating grievances. This is a result of their grassroots nature and relatively inconspicuous, non-confrontational subcultures.

<doc id="368374" wikidata="Q1015967" url="?curid=368374" title="Bilston">
<text>Bilston is a market town in the City of Wolverhampton in the West Midlands, England. It is in the Black Country, south east of Wolverhampton city centre and close to the borders of Sandwell and Walsall. The town was known for enamalling from the mid-17th century, and is a former coal and iron mining district. Iron works dominated in Victorian times and the area became a centre for steel production. The town had a population of 34,639 at the 2021 Census.

==History==
Bilston was first referred to in AD 985 as &quot;Bilsatena&quot; when Wolverhampton was granted to Wulfrun then in 996 as &quot;Bilsetnatun&quot; in the grant charter of St. Mary&#x27;s Church (now St. Peter&#x27;s Collegiate Church, Wolverhampton). &quot;Bilsetnatun&quot; can be interpreted as meaning the settlement (&quot;ton&quot;) of the folk (&quot;saetan&quot;) of the ridge (&quot;bill&quot;). It is mentioned in the Domesday Book as a village called &quot;Billestune&quot;. 

Historically in Staffordshire, Bilston was a largely rural area until extensively developed for factories and coal mining in the 19th century.

In 1866 Bilston became a civil parish. Bilston Urban District Council was formed under the Local Government Act 1894 covering the ancient parish of Bilston. The urban district was granted a royal charter in 1933, becoming a municipal borough and Alderman Herbert Beach its Mayor. Between 1920 and 1966, the council replaced most of the 19th-century terraced houses with rented modern houses and flats on developments like Stowlawn, the Lunt, and Bunker&#x27;s Hill. By 1964 there were more than 6,000 council houses.

On 1 April 1966 the Borough of Bilston was abolished, with most of its territory incorporated into the County Borough of Wolverhampton (see History of West Midlands), although parts of Bradley in the east of the town were merged into Walsall borough and part went to West Bromwich. The parish was also abolished on 1 April 1966 and merged with Wolverhampton, Walsall and West Bromwich. In 1961 the parish had a population of 33,067.

Bilston Town Hall, dating from 1872, has now been refurbished and re-opened. It had been derelict for more than a decade after Wolverhampton Council discontinued its use as housing offices, but now operates as a venue for events, conferences, performances and occasions.

Bilston lost its passenger railway station in 1972, although goods trains continued to pass through the site of the station for a further decade. The town&#x27;s new bus station opened in October 1991, linking with the town&#x27;s West Midlands Metro station, which opened in May 1999.

The huge British Steel Corporation plant to the west of the town centre was closed in 1979, after 199 years of steel production at the site, with the loss of nearly 2,000 jobs. Part of the site was developed as the Sedgemoor Park Housing Estate between 1986 and 1989, and a B&amp;Q superstore opened on another part of the site in December 1993, forming the first phase of a new small retail park and industrial estate which developed over the next decade. The GKN steel plant to the south of the town centre closed in 1989.

Construction of the long-awaited Black Country Route began in the mid 1980s, although the final phase was not completed until July 1995, by which time Bilston had a direct unbroken dual carriageway link with Dudley, Walsall and the M5 Motorway. The Black Country Spine Road opened at the same time, improving Bilston&#x27;s road links with West Bromwich and Birmingham.

21st century developments in Bilston include the South Wolverhampton and Bilston Academy and the adjoining Bert Williams Leisure Centre, which form the centerpiece of the town&#x27;s new Urban Village, which is planned to include an eventual total of more than 1,000 new homes.

==St Leonard&#x27;s Church==

Christian worship in Bilston can be traced back to 1090. In 1458, the chapel was replaced by St Leonard&#x27;s Chantry and a third renovated church was consecrated in 1733. The church seen today dates from a rebuilding of 1825–26 to the designs of Francis Godwin in the manner of John Soane and is the fourth church on the site, though a small amount of older stonework from the C14 or C15 remains visible inside the present tower. It was altered in 1882–83 by prolific church architect Ewan Christian. Ewan Christian altered the aisle windows into single tall, thin openings where there had previously been two. The church contains a font of 1673, probably from the older church. The church is painted stucco inside and out. It is also unusual in having a chamfered square tower, giving it an octagonal appearance, in being surmounted with a cupola, a golden globe with weather vane and a fenced viewing platform.

==Industry==

From the middle of the 18th century, Bilston became well known for the craft of enamelling. Items produced included decorative containers such as patch-boxes, scent boxes, and bonbonnieres.

With the opening of the Birmingham Canal to the west of the town in 1770, industrial activity in the local area increased, with the first blast furnaces near the canal at Spring Vale being erected by 1780.

Bilston was transformed by the Industrial Revolution. In 1800, it was still a largely rural area dependent on farming. By 1900, it was a busy town with numerous factories and coalmines, as well as a large number of houses for the workers and their families. The Bilston coal mines were reputedly haunted by an evil spirit, so the miners brought in a local exorcist known as The White Rabbit.

Six new blast furnaces were erected there between 1866 and 1883. Five of these were producing a total of nearly 25,000 tons of steel per year at what was now known as Bilston Steel Works. The first electric powered blast furnaces opened there in 1907, and finally in 1954 the &quot;Elisabeth&quot; blast furnace was erected, creating 275,000 tons of steel per year. However, by the 1970s the steel works had become uneconomic and the Labour government decided to close it, with closure taking place on 12 April 1979. The iconic &quot;Elisabeth&quot; was demolished on 5 October 1980. Local unemployment, which had been steadily rising for some years, was pushed even higher by the plant&#x27;s closure. A former railway bridge which connected parts of the steelworks site remains in situ across the canal.

The industry remained prolific during the interwar years, but much of the housing was now sub-standard, and during the 1920s and 1930s, many of the older houses were cleared and replaced by modern council houses.

==Transport==

=== Canal ===
The original line of the Birmingham Canal (now the BCN Old Main Line) was planned to serve Bilston amongst other towns. The bill for its construction stated that &quot;the Primary and Principal Object of this Undertaking was and is to obtain a Navigation from the Collieries to this Town [ie Birmingham]&quot;. The canal opened from Wednesbury to Birmingham on 6 November 1769 and through to Newell on 25 March 1772. Coal from Bilston was reaching Birmingham by May 1770. When the BCN New Main Line was built the Wednesbury section became a loop serving industry and collieries, the southern part of which was subsequently abandoned and filled in. A branch was also built from the Walsall Canal to Bilston, but was closed in 1953.

=== Railway ===
From 1850 to 1972 there was a railway station in Bilston town centre, but passenger services were then withdrawn and the line via Bilston (from Wolverhampton Low Level to Birmingham Snow Hill) had been almost completely abandoned within a decade. There was also a railway station, Bilston West on the now closed Oxford-Worcester-Wolverhampton Line. The final stub of the railway, connecting a town centre scrapyard with the South Staffordshire Line at Wednesbury, closed in 1992.

=== Tram ===

Bilston has three West Midlands Metro tram stops on the line between Wolverhampton and Birmingham; Bilston Central, Loxdale and The Crescent. The town was set to be served by 2 new lines by 2024, with trams travelling to Stourbridge &amp; Walsall, however budget constraints have put back the opening date to at least 2025.

=== Road ===
A significant development in the Bilston area was the A463 Black Country Route. With more cars, the roads around Bilston town centre became increasingly congested. In the late 1960s, the government drew up plans for a new motorway bypassing Bilston (and running from the A4123 near Coseley to Junction 10 of the M6 motorway at Walsall), which was scheduled to be completed by 1976, but nothing came of it. Plans for a new dual carriageway were revived in the early 1980s on a slightly different route, much closer to Bilston town centre. The first phase of the road (to be known as the Black County Route) was completed in 1986. Though initially running around east of the A4123, it was extended in 1990 to Oxford Street in Bilston town centre. In the town centre a number of buildings were demolished and roads re-routed, while one road, Market Street was obliterated. During 1995, completion of the final phase of the Black Country Route between Bilston and Junction 10 of the M6 motorway led to an improvement in traffic flow in and around the town centre.

=== Bus ===
Bilston Bus Station opened in 1991 and underwent refurbishment in 2005 by Centro. Buses run from the bus station to Wolverhampton, Willenhall, Wednesfield, New Cross Hospital, Tipton, Dudley and Walsall. In addition, surrounding areas such as Ettingshall, The Lunt, Stowlawn, Rocket Pool, Bradley, Moxley and Portobello are served. Service 79 (Wolverhampton - West Bromwich) does not stop at the bus station, instead its route is along Wellington Road and Lichfield Street. 

Services 25, 34, 39, 42, 79, 82 and 530 (Sunday) are operated by National Express West Midlands. Services 57, 82 (Evening/Sunday), 223, 229, 303 and 326 are operated by Diamond West Midlands. Services 53 and 530 are operated by Banga Bus and service 23/23A are operated by Carolean Coaches. Some services are subsidised by Transport for West Midlands. 

==Arts and culture==

At the Bilston end of the Black Country Route can be seen the group of wooden statues designed by Robert Koenig and called &quot;Steel Columns.&quot; &quot;This sculpture was made from 15 lengths of sweet chestnut which stretch up to 6 metres in height. The male and female figures depicted are based on those found in old Victorian photographs of Bilston. The title &quot;Steel Columns&quot; is a reference to Bilston&#x27;s steel making background and the connection the figures had with this history.&quot;

Art and craft works of local significance from the eighteenth century are displayed at Bilston Craft Gallery, which also has a temporary exhibition space where local art and crafts are often displayed. The craft gallery also hosts workshops for families and children, including school trips.

The artist William Harold Dudley was born in Bilston; several of his works are in the collection of Wolverhampton Art Gallery.

Bilston Carnival in the 1960&#x27;s travelled along Wellington Road before ending in Hickman Park where there would be Pat Collins&#x27; fun fair, horse jumping and an open air stage hosting various entertainment including wrestling and live music bands. The park also had one of the tallest slides for children in any park.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC West Midlands and ITV Central. Television signals are received from the Sutton Coldfield TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio WM, Heart West Midlands, Smooth West Midlands, Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire, Greatest Hits Radio Birmingham &amp; The West Midlands, Greatest Hits Radio Black Country &amp; Shropshire and WCR FM, a community based station which broadcast from nearby Wolverhampton. 

The town is served by the local newspaper, &quot;Express &amp; Star&quot;.

==Education==
Bilston has 15 primary schools, and two secondary schools – South Wolverhampton and Bilston Academy and Moseley Park School, which was originally Etheridge Secondary Modern (formerly Fraser Street Schools), and Bilston Boys&#x27; Grammar School. Manor Primary School, which used to be a secondary school, is sometimes incorrectly believed to be in Bilston, but is actually in Woodcross which is within the Wolverhampton-governed part of Coseley.

Bilston had a Cholera Orphan School which was opened on 3 August 1833 following a severe outbreak during the second cholera pandemic (1829–51) which had left 450 orphans in Bilston after the death of 742 sufferers. The Royal School, Wolverhampton has similar origins.

==Crime==
In 1862 the case of David Brandrick, the &quot;Bilston Murderer&quot; was heavily covered by all the local papers. According to the&quot; Windsor and Eton Journal&quot;, Saturday 11 January 1862, Brandrick was hanged outside Stafford Jail that morning for the murder of John Bagott, a clothier and pawnbroker.

On 30 September 2007, the body of 16-year-old Shane Owoo was recovered from a flooded clay pit near the Lunt estate. Two Wolverhampton men, Christopher Lewis and Marvin Walker, were found guilty of manslaughter on 25 April 2008 and sentenced to five and a half years in prison. The jury at Birmingham Crown Court heard that the pair had frogmarched Owoo to the pool amid allegations that he had stolen a bicycle from one of the defendants. A third man, Tobias Davies, received a 12-month prison sentence for assaulting Owoo, but had not been present when the other two men attacked him and chased him into the pool where he drowned.

On 28 July 2009, 47-year-old Moxley pub landlord Swinder Singh Batth was shot dead in the town centre outside Gavin&#x27;s Sports Bar. Jasbir Singh Takhar, of Coseley, and Sukwinder Singh Sanghera, of West Bromwich, were jailed for life a year later for the murder; it was established that they had been attempting to shoot someone else. The trial judge recommended minimum terms of 29 and 28 years respectively. Five other people received prison sentences of between 21 months and three years for conspiracy to commit violent disorder in connection with the crime, while a sixth person received a three-and-half-year prison sentence for witness intimidation.

On 21 November 2009, 50-year-old Dudley man Daniel McCalla was shot dead at the town&#x27;s Tropical Harmony nightclub.

==Demography==
At the 2021 census, Bilston&#x27;s built-up area population was recorded as having a population of 34,639. Of the findings, the ethnicity and religious composition of the wards separately were:

The religious composition of the built-up area at the 2021 Census was recorded as:

==Governance==
Four wards of Wolverhampton City Council now cover the town. These are Bilston South and Bilston North, which almost entirely comprise parts of the historic Borough of Bilston and Ettingshall North and Ettingshall South and Spring Vale, which comprise a part of Bilston and other parts of Wolverhampton.

The town was represented by Bilston parliamentary constituency from 1918 until 1974, which also included nearby Sedgley and Coseley. Bilston was then incorporated into Wolverhampton South East, where it remains.

<text>Bishop&#x27;s Stortford is a historic market town and civil parish in the East Hertfordshire district, in the county of Hertfordshire, England. It is in the London commuter belt, near the border with Essex, just west of the M11 motorway and Stansted Airport, 22 miles north-east of Central London and 34 minutes away by rail from Liverpool Street station. The town had an estimated population of 41,088 in 2020. The district of East Hertfordshire, where the town centre is located, was ranked as the best place to live in the UK by the Halifax Quality of Life annual survey in 2020.

==History==

=== Toponymy ===
The origins of the town&#x27;s name are uncertain. One possibility is that the Saxon settlement derives its name from &#x27;Steorta&#x27;s ford&#x27; or &#x27;tail ford&#x27;, in the sense of a &#x27;tail&#x27;, or tongue, of land. The town became known as Bishop&#x27;s Stortford due to the acquisition in 1060 by the Bishop of London.

The River Stort is named after the town, and not the town after the river. When cartographers visited the town in the 16th century, they reasoned that the town must have been named after the ford in the river and assumed the river was called the Stort.

=== First settlements: pre-Roman and Roman Stortford ===
Little is known of Stortford until the Roman era, with the evidence being small archaeological finds. Limited evidence of ancient Mesolithic and Microlithic peoples in the form of flakes, cores and an axe have been found on the Meads and Silverleys respectively. Most Bronze Age evidence is from the neighbouring parish of Thorley to the south as opposed to Stortford proper, but a 3,000 year old socketed spearhead has been found at Haymeads Lane within the town. Evidence of settlement has been found on Dunmow Road dating from the Middle Bronze Age through to Romano-British times. In &quot;Bishop&#x27;s Stortford: A History&quot;, Jacqueline Cooper concludes &quot;existing evidence suggests that the Stortford area was settled only sparsely in prehistoric times, and nearby places like Braughing and Little Hallingbury were of more importance.&quot;

Stortford was on the line of the Roman road, Stane Street, which ran from St Albans to Colchester via Braughing. Construction started around AD 50 on the road. Little evidence from the period survives except for excavations showing a section of the road, evidence of a cremation facility and a burial site. None of the excavations has shown evidence of the Roman fort which likely existed in Stortford. The settlement was probably abandoned in the 5th century after the break-up of the Roman Empire.

=== Refoundation: post-Roman and medieval Stortford ===

Following the end of the Roman era, a new Anglo-Saxon settlement grew up on the site.

However, little is known about Stortford until the 1060s with the evidence becoming much stronger after the Norman Conquest. In 1060 when William, Bishop of London, bought Stortford manor and estate for £8, leading to the town&#x27;s modern name. By 1086, the motte-and-bailey Waytemore Castle had been built as a local strongpoint for the area. It acted as a centre for defence and civil administration for roughly 125 years before it was dismantled but not destroyed by King John in 1211. Rebuilding of the castle started the following year at John&#x27;s expense, and John stayed the night in the castle in 1216. By the 15th century, the castle had fallen into disrepair, and the Bishop&#x27;s Court (one of the administrative structures for the area) moved to Hockerill, to the east of the town.

At the time of the Domesday Book in 1086 the village had a population of around 120, and grew to around 700 by the 13th century.

In terms of governance, early medieval Stortford was part of the Braughing Hundred, but acquired burgesses and between 1306 and 1336 was taxed as a borough. No charter survives however, and civil authority passed to two local manor courts at the Castle and the Rectory. Stortford briefly sent two members to parliament in the reigns of Edward II and Edward III, with writs being issued to the town in the 1311–1315, 1318, 1320, 1322 and 1340.

=== Plague and growth: early modern Stortford ===
At the start of the early modern period in the mid 15th century, Stortford was a primarily agricultural community, but had also acquired a tanning industry. By the 16th century, Stortford had become an important centre of the malting industry. Not only were the local soils well suited for grains, but the fact that the town was just 35 miles to London provided an impetus to its development. The economic draw of the maltings and the town&#x27;s market supported a large number of inns and public houses by the middle of the 16th century pointing to its prosperity.

Over the following hundred years, Stortford grew markedly. The population of Stortford reached 1,500 by 1660 as a result of a positive net birth rate and migration to the town. This was despite a series of a dozen plagues between the 1560s and 1660s. The town also enjoyed a series of royal visits in the 17th century, with Charles I visiting the town in 1625, 1629 and 1642.

The years following the last of Charles&#x27; visits were to prove somewhat turbulent for the town. During the English Civil War Stortford backed the Parliamentarians, with the Manor of Stortford being sequestered from the Bishop of London and sold off for £2,845. It was returned to the Bishop at the Restoration. The Great Plague of 1666–7, and its lasting effects, reduced the population to only around 600 by 1700. The effects of the plague were so severe that the town had to appeal to the Hertfordshire magistrates, who levied a rate on every parish in the county for the relief of Bishop&#x27;s Stortford, Hoddesdon and Cheshunt.

Despite the demographic impact of the Great Plague, perhaps the turning point in Stortford&#x27;s fortunes was the creation of the &#x27;Hockerill by-pass&#x27; in 1670. King Charles II had in the 1660s been increasingly travelling from London to Newmarket for the races and disliked the noise and congestion of Stortford, with its odorous market, maltings and tanneries. Moreover, the route was not always passable as noted by diarist Samuel Pepys who in made the following entry in his diary on 23 May 1668: &quot;‘and so to Bishop&#x27;s Stafford [sic]. The ways mighty full of water so as hardly to be passed’.&quot; As a result, the road from London to Newmarket was diverted to the east of the centre of Stortford, and instead ran through the outlying settlement of Hockerill. The inns of Hockerill become an important overnight location for stop overs for overnight coaches to East Anglia. Further demands for improved roads led to the creation of the Essex and Hertfordshire Turnpike Trust (later Hockerill Turnpike Trust) in 1744 to repair the road between Harlow Bush Common and Stump Cross in Great Chesterford. Later Acts of Parliament extended the term of the Trust and allowed new road construction. From March 1785 the mail coaches ran from London to Norwich via Stortford. Thus, the improved highways marked the first of the phases of Stortford&#x27;s growth driven by emergent transport technology.

The second major transport development to provide a significant boost to the town was the construction of the Stort Navigation, which canalised the River Stort, and opened in 1769. The improvements to the navigation of the Stort were driven by the inability of the malting industry to use the Stort for river transport, which caused significant damage to the local roads and handed a competitive advantage to neighbouring malting areas like Ware who were linked to London by the River Lea. The work on the canal undertaken by George Jackson (later Sir George Duckett) had the added benefit of alleviating the flooding risk in the town. 

=== Industrial revolution to World War II ===
With the roads and Stort navigation providing easy access to London markets, industrialisation came to Stortford. The advent of the Stort Navigation brought new industries to the town, with bargemen, lock-keepers, wharfingers, coal and timber merchants all appearing. The malting industry also saw output significantly increase, with brown malt production doubling between 1788 and 1811. Together with national trends in the brewing industry, the 40 malthouses in Stortford in early 1800s Stortford also helped to stimulate the local brewing trade. At the turn of the 19th century, there were 18 brewers in town which in turn boosted the inn trade. The boom in the town in turn boosted the metal working and bricklaying trades, and also aided the general retail trade. In 1791 there were 30 principal traders according to a contemporary directory.

The vibrancy of the local economy - especially the agricultural trade sector - was demonstrated in 1828 when a consortium of local businessmen built the Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Corn Exchange, which provided trading accommodation for 65 dealers. By this point, the town directory was listing 200 commercial entries, and 350 by the turn of the century.

The third major transport innovation to have a significant impact upon Stortford was the arrival of the railway in 1842. The line initially ran from London Liverpool Street to Stortford, but by 1845 the line was linked to Norwich. The new rail link brought an almost immediate end to the coaching industry, and the Stort Navigation entered terminal decline. The town, though boomed. Massive new residential estates grew up in the New Town (to the south and west of the historic core) and Hockerill (across the river to the east of the historic core) in the decades following the building of the railway. A Bishop&#x27;s Stortford–Braintree branch line was built to Braintree to bring goods into Stortford from the surrounding more rural areas, with the first section to Great Dunmow opening in 1864. The single track line struggled to gain traction, and by 1922 had only seven eastbound and six westbound trains per day. The bus service which started between Stortford and Dunmow in 1920 contributed to the demise of the line which closed to passengers in 1952 and freight in 1972.The mid-19th century onwards also saw the rapid growth in public utilities, public services and governance in the town. The first gas street lights were installed in the town in the 1830s, in 1855 the New Cemetery was opened, in the 1870s a sewage farm and an isolation hospital were built, while in 1895 the town&#x27;s first proper hospital was opened. By 1911, the &quot;Encyclopædia Britannica&quot; referred to the town as having strong educational pedigree: &quot;The high school, formerly the grammar school, was founded in the time of Elizabeth... There are a Nonconformist grammar school, a diocesan training college for mistresses, and other educational establishments.&quot;

During World War II, Stortford was a reception area for evacuees. This did not, however, mean that Stortford was immune from bombings, with 20 bombs recorded as having been dropped in 1940. Targets included Hockerill Training College where three students were killed on 10 October 1940. The railway station was hit twice during the war and a rocket landed near Farnham Road in the town in 1945.

=== The modern service-industry town ===
In the post-war era the town centre underwent changes with the demolition of a multi-storey car park and surrounding area to make way for a new town centre area and city-type apartments and penthouses on the riverside and elsewhere. Jackson Square (a modern shopping complex) was rebuilt and an extension added.

Stortford continued to grow as a commuter town from the second half of the 20th century onwards, spurred by the construction of the M11 motorway and Stansted Airport, as well as rail links to London and Cambridge. This contributed to its rise in population to almost 38,000 at the time of the 2011 census.

Of the seven suburbs of Thorley, Town, Havers, Stortford Fields, Bishop&#x27;s Park, St Michael&#x27;s Mead and Snowley the last is a separate ecclesiastical parish east of the River Stort, centred around the old coaching inns, All Saints in Stansted Road and Snowley Parade, bordering Birchanger Woods and Essex. Postwar development has enlarged the town&#x27;s area further.

==Demography==
=== Demographic history ===
The earliest reliable population figure for Stortford was 120 at the publication of the Domesday Book in 1086. Over the successive centuries the population waxed and waned as a result of economic growth and plagues, and generally only rough population estimates exist. By the time of the first nationwide census in 1801 Stortford&#x27;s population had reached 2,305 spurred by the town&#x27;s position on the Hockerill Turnpike and the canalisation of the River Stort. Steady growth continued over the coming decades as the railways spurred industrialisation. Population growth averaged 1.12% per annum through to 1911 and the advent of World War I. Inter-war growth averaged 1.54% per annum. Stortford&#x27;s population exceeded the county town of Hertford in the 1961 census, even though Stortford&#x27;s average population growth slowed to 1.39% between World War II and 2020. Sources of population growth have been predominantly natural growth and in-migration, but on a number of occasions the boundaries of Bishop&#x27;s Stortford parish have been expanded. Most recently this occurred in 1992 when some neighbouring parts of Essex were moved into the town and in 2018 when homes were moved into Stortford from neighbouring Thorley Parish. In 2020 Bishop&#x27;s Stortford was the largest town in East Hertfordshire.

=== Ethnicity and nationality ===
At the 2011 census, 93.6% of the population of Stortford described themselves as white, which was lower than the 96.2% recorded in the 2001 census. The number of people describing themselves as having a white background in 2011 was significantly higher than the England aggregate of 85.4%, but slightly lower than the overall East Hertfordshire figure.
The proportion of Bishop&#x27;s Stortford residents reporting having been born in the United Kingdom was 87.8%, and was only slightly higher than the English average of 86.2%. Stortford recorded a significantly higher proportion of European Union-born residents than either East Hertfordshire or England. The number of UK-born residents in 2011 was down from the 92.4% recorded in 2001.

=== Housing ===
The number of occupied dwellings in Bishop&#x27;s Stortford rose from 13,733 in 2001 to 14,920. In Stortford 3.0% of properties were recorded as empty in 2011, compared with 4.3% across England. Overall, the dominant type of housing are detached and semi-detached housing, although the proportion of flats has grown from 13.0% in 2001 to 17.6% in 2011. The proportion of flats is well below the English average of 22.1% 

Home ownership is high in Bishop&#x27;s Stortford at 72.3% of households, which is above both the East Hertfordshire and English averages. The proportion of properties available for social rent has risen from 9.8% in 2001 to 10.1% in 2011. 
==Government==
Stortford has three tiers of local government at parish (town), district, and county level: Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Town Council, East Hertfordshire District Council, and Hertfordshire County Council.

=== Historical development ===
Historically, Stortford was administered by its parish vestry, in the same way as most small towns and rural areas; no borough corporation was established for the town, despite some limited moves in that direction in the fourteenth century. Bishop&#x27;s Stortford was included in the hundred of Braughing. The Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Poor Law Union was established in 1835, covering the town and surrounding parishes in both Hertfordshire and Essex.

On 25 October 1866 a public meeting at the town&#x27;s corn exchange voted to establish a local board, the Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Local Board. The parish of Bishop&#x27;s Stortford was declared to be a local government district with effect from 25 December 1866, and the local board held its first meeting at the corn exchange on 23 February 1867. Jones Gifford Nash was chosen as the first chairman of the local board. The Local Board later established offices at 7 North Street.

Under the Local Government Act 1894, the Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Local Board was replaced by the Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Urban District Council in 1894. The new council held its first meeting on 5 January 1895. The last chairman of the local board, John Slater, was appointed the first chairman of the urban district council. The council continued to be based at 7 North Street until the First World War. In 1914 the council bought a large old house called Wharf House at 4 The Causeway. The house had been built by George Jackson, who had also built the adjoining Stort Navigation. Wharf House was renamed the Council House, and served as the council&#x27;s offices until October 1972, when the council moved to purpose-built offices at 1 The Causeway. The Council House was demolished shortly afterwards to make way for the Jackson Square shopping centre.
Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Urban District Council was granted a coat of arms on 20 August 1952.

Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Urban District was abolished under the Local Government Act 1972, becoming part of East Hertfordshire on 1 April 1974. Bishop&#x27;s Stortford Town Council was established as a successor parish to the old urban district. The former urban district council&#x27;s offices at 1 The Causeway were taken over by East Hertfordshire District Council, whilst the new town council was based at the former offices of the Braughing Rural District Council at 2 Hockerill Street. The town council moved to the Old Monastery on Windhill in 1994. East Hertfordshire District Council vacated 1 The Causeway in 2013, having consolidated most of its functions at its main offices in Hertford. The district council set up a smaller Bishop&#x27;s Stortford office in Charringtons House, adjoining 1 The Causeway. The vacated office at 1 The Causeway was demolished in 2017.

=== Parliamentary elections ===

Bishop&#x27;s Stortford is the largest town within the Hertford and Stortford County Constituency for elections to the House of Commons of the United Kingdom. The constituency covers Stortford, Hertford, Ware, Sawbridgeworth and the surrounding rural areas.

=== Electoral wards ===
For elections to East Herts District Council, Bishop&#x27;s Stortford has been divided into six wards since the May 2023 local elections wards: All Saints, Central, North, Parsonage, South and Thorley Manor.

==Economy and business==
Stortford is a prosperous town. The key drivers of its growth according to the &quot;Town Wide Employment Study for Bishop&#x27;s Stortford&quot; are &quot;Stansted Airport, an excellent rail service into central London and good road links via the M11 to London, the M25 northern sub-region and Cambridge. Stortford is well positioned in relation to the UK&#x27;s most dynamic economies.&quot; This study also highlights Stortford&#x27;s skilled population, as well as the importance of &quot;quality of life&quot; as an important economic asset. In addition to East Hertfordshire topping the Halifax Quality of Life survey in 2020, Stortford has been highlighted as a popular commuter town in articles in The Times, &quot;The Evening Standard,&quot; and the Metro newspaper London.

Like the UK as a whole, Stortford has a highly service-based economy. In the 2011 census, 84.5% of Stortford residents in employment stated that they worked in a service industry, which was higher than East Hertfordshire (81.2%) and England (81.2%). Of particular note is that 7.9% of local workers are employed in Transportation and Storage which is well above the English average of 5.0%. The most significant employer in this industry is Stansted Airport, which was estimated in 2013 to employ at least 1,000 people who live in Stortford.
Commuters represent a sizeable proportion of the local working age population. The &quot;Town Wide Employment Study&quot; estimated in 2013 around 3,000 people (round 15% of those in employment) commute from Stortford by rail, with the largest proportion &quot;in all probability&quot; travelling into Central London. This is reflected in Stortford in the 2011 census having a much higher proportion of workers in managerial and professional occupations than the national average, as shown in the table below.

Snow is often seen in the winter months because the town is near the east coast, where cold, moist air is brought in from the North Sea and cold fronts from northern Europe. In recent years there has been up to three inches of snow early in the year, which has resulted in minor disruption to transport and caused some schools to close for several days. However, the snow tends not to persist in any noticeable quantity.

<text>San Rafael High School is a public high school located at 150 Third St. in San Rafael, California, United States.

The school is part of the San Rafael City Schools school district. Its official nickname is the Bulldog; however, its athletic teams have been known casually as the Dawgs since the mid-1980s.

The school is located on a campus in central San Rafael.

Residents of the high school district may choose either San Rafael High or Terra Linda High School. The high school district includes San Rafael, Santa Venetia, Lucas Valley-Marinwood, and a portion of Larkspur.

==History==
San Rafael High School opened in 1888. The school&#x27;s current campus opened in 1924.

The school is cited as the 1971 origin of the time and codeword 420 in cannabis culture. Originally &quot;420&quot; served as a code word for &quot;The Waldos&quot;, a group of students who would meet in front of the 1940 Benny Bufano statue of Louis Pasteur at 4:20p.m. to smoke marijuana, both near the statue and at other clandestine locations on campus grounds. The &quot;420&quot; moniker was in widespread use on campus during the 1974–1976 timeframe by the school stoner community. As the usage spread, the original connotations of the term &quot;420&quot; faded away.

San Rafael High School served as the setting for the video of the 1984 power ballad &quot;Sister Christian&quot; by Night Ranger.

KSRH is the school&#x27;s radio station, which is completely operated by students. The station broadcasts with 10 watts of power on 88.1 FM and 107.3 Cable FM. The station takes requests during school hours at (415) 457-KSRH.

Facilities at the school were upgraded with funds from bond measures passed in 1999 and 2002.

Beginning with the 2001–2002 school year, San Rafael High School moved to an A/B rotating block schedule.

In 2006, the school scored 680 on the Academic Performance Index (API), the California Department of Education’s program for measuring school accountability. It also passed all Adequate Yearly Performance (AYP) criteria required by the federal No Child Left Behind (NCLB) Act of 2001.

In September 2008, the school served as a primary location for the independent feature film &quot;The Prankster&quot;. School was in session while filming took place and some students and teachers had background roles in the movie. Former principal Judy Colton had a small speaking part with Kurt Fuller, who played Dean Pecarino in the film.

In 2019 construction began on a new two-story building to house the school&#x27;s administrative offices, a kitchen, general student commons area and classrooms along with support spaces for Madrone High School, a continuation high school on the campus of San Rafael High School.

<text>Running on Ice is the second album by Vertical Horizon, released independently in 1995, and later re-released by RCA. It was produced by John Alagia (John Mayer, Dave Matthews Band), Doug Derryberry and Matt Scannell. Though still technically a duo and acoustic based, &quot;Running on Ice&quot; featured many guest musicians (most notably Carter Beauford of the Dave Matthews Band on drums), giving the album more of a full band sound. Derryberry also contributed keyboards and vocals. Two of the album&#x27;s songs (&quot;Wash Away&quot; and &quot;The Man Who Would Be Santa&quot;) appeared on the 2nd Aware Compilation.

<text>Nancy Marie Lopez (born January 6, 1957) is an American former professional golfer. She became a member of the LPGA Tour in 1977 and won 48 LPGA Tour events, including three major championships.

==Amateur career==

Lopez won the New Mexico Women&#x27;s Amateur at age 12 in 1969, and the U.S. Girls&#x27; Junior in 1972 and 1974, at ages 15 and 17, respectively. Shortly after graduation from Goddard High School in Roswell, she played in the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open as an amateur, first in 1974 and again in 1975 where she tied for second.

As a collegiate freshman in 1976, Lopez was named All-American and Female Athlete of the Year for her play at the University of Tulsa. That year she won the Association of Intercollegiate Athletics for Women (AIAW) national intercollegiate golf championship and was a member of the U.S. Curtis Cup and World Amateur teams. Lopez left college after her sophomore year and turned pro in 1977, and again was the runner-up at the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open.

==Professional career==
During her first full season on the LPGA Tour in 1978, Lopez won nine tournaments, including five consecutive. She appeared on the cover of &quot;Sports Illustrated&quot; in July, won the Vare Trophy for lowest scoring average, LPGA Rookie of the Year, LPGA Player of the Year and was named the Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year. She won another eight times in 1979, and won multiple times in each year from 1980 to 1984, although she played only half-seasons in 1983 and 1984 due to the birth of her first child.

Playing full-time again in 1985, Lopez posted five wins, five seconds, five thirds, won the money title, the scoring title, the Player of the Year Award, and was named Associated Press Female Athlete of the Year for a second time. She entered only four events in 1986, when her second daughter was born, but came back with multiple wins in 1987–89 - three times each in 1988 and 1989 - and once again won Player of the Year honors in 1988. Lopez&#x27; schedule was curtailed again in the early 1990s when her third daughter was born. In 1992 she won twice. Lopez continued to play short schedules - from 11 to 18 tournaments - through 2002, then in 2003 cut back to just a half dozen or fewer events a year.

Lopez was considered to be one of the greats of women&#x27;s golf, and she was the game&#x27;s best player from the late 1970s to late 1980s. She won three majors, and all were at the LPGA Championship, at the same course, in 1978, 1985, and 1989. Lopez never won the U.S. Women&#x27;s Open, but finished second four times, the last in 1997 when she became the first in the event&#x27;s history to score under 70 for all four rounds, yet lost to Alison Nicholas. She won the Colgate-Dinah Shore in 1981, two years before it became a major, and was a runner-up three times at the du Maurier Classic in Canada.

Lopez was inducted into the World Golf Hall of Fame in 1987. She was a member of the United States Solheim Cup team in 1990 and was captain of the team in 2005. Lopez retired from regular tournament play in 2002 and attempted a return in 2007 and 2008. In her return season, she played six tournaments, missed the cut in each, and only broke 80 in three of the 12 rounds. In 2008, she played in three events, with a low score of 76, never making the cut. She was inducted into the Georgia Sports Hall of Fame in 2002.

Lopez is the only woman to win LPGA Rookie of the Year, Player of the Year, and the Vare Trophy in the same season (1978). Her company, Nancy Lopez Golf, makes a full line of women&#x27;s clubs and accessories. She also does occasional television commentary.

==Personal life==
Lopez was married to Houston sportscaster Tim Melton from 1979 to 1982. Shortly after her divorce, she married Major League All-Star baseball player Ray Knight, then a member of the Houston Astros, in October 1982 in Pelham, Georgia. They were married for 27 years, divorcing in 2009, and have three daughters. While married, Lopez and Knight lived in Georgia in his hometown of Albany. Since 1986, she has hosted the Nancy Lopez Hospice Golf Classic at the Doublegate Country Club to raise money for Albany Community Hospice, returning yearly even after her divorce from Knight in 2009. She currently resides in The Villages, Florida where she hosts an annual golf tournament to benefit the charity AIM (Adventures in Movement), an organization that helps mentally challenged, visually impaired, hearing impaired, physically handicapped and other children and adults with special needs. She has hosted the tournament since 1981 and also serves as a national ambassador with AIM. In 2017, Lopez married for a third time to Ed Russell.

<text>Darwen is a market town and civil parish in the Blackburn with Darwen borough in Lancashire, England. The residents of the town are known as &quot;Darreners&quot;.
The A666 road passes through Darwen towards Blackburn to the north, Bolton to the south and Pendlebury where it joins the A6, about north-west of Manchester. The population of Darwen stood at 28,046 in the 2011 census. The town comprises four wards and has its own town council.

The town stands on the River Darwen, which flows from south to north and is seen in parks in the town centre and next to Sainsbury&#x27;s located in the town centre.

==Toponym==
Darwen&#x27;s name is Celtic in origin. In Sub Roman Britain it was within the Brythonic kingdom of Rheged, a successor to the Brigantes tribal territory. 
The Brythonic language name for oak is &quot;derw&quot; and this is etymologically linked to &quot;Derewent&quot; (1208), an ancient spelling for the River Darwen. Despite the area becoming part of the Anglo-Saxon Kingdom of Northumbria by the mid-8th century, its Brythonic name was never supplanted by an Old English place name.

==History==

The area around Darwen has been inhabited since the early Bronze Age, and the remains of a round barrow from approximately 2000 BCE have been partially restored at the Ashleigh Barrow in Whitehall. The barrow had ten interments, nine of which were Collared Urn burials. As well as human remains, items found at the barrow included a bronze dagger some 7.5 inches in length, a flint thumb scraper, a sub-plano-convex knife and a clay bead. Copies of the Collared Urns may be seen at the Darwen Library.

The Romans once had a force in Lancashire, and a Roman road is visible on the Ordnance Survey map of the area. Medieval Darwen was tiny and little or nothing survives. One of the earliest remaining buildings is a farmhouse at Bury Fold, dated 1675. Whitehall Cottage is thought to be the oldest house in the town, and was mostly built in the 17th and 18th centuries but contains a chimney piece dated 1557.

Like many towns in Lancashire, Darwen was a centre for textile manufacture during the Industrial Revolution. Samuel Crompton, inventor of the spinning mule, lived there for part of his life. Rail links and the Leeds and Liverpool Canal arrived in the mid-19th century. The most important textile building in Darwen is India Mill, built by Eccles Shorrock &amp; Company. The company was ruined, however, by the effects of the Lancashire Cotton Famine of the 1860s. Cotton manufacture was an important industry, and by 1907, the Darwen Weavers&#x27;, Winders&#x27; and Warpers&#x27; Association had more than 8,000 members in the town.

In the early 1840s Eccles Shorrock created a large mill lodge (industrial reservoir) in what is now the lower part of Bold Venture Park by constructing a dam where Inverness Road now runs across the valley cut by Bold Venture Brook. In 1848, during a night of heavy thunder storms and torrential rain, water rushed down from the moors and the dam failed catastrophically. The water level dropped by 40ft almost instantly, and a wall of water swept down into the town centre, doing considerable damage and drowning a number of poor people who slept in cellars under shops and houses in the Market Street area.

Much of the town was built between about 1850 and 1900; placenames, date stones in terraces, and the vernacular architecture of cellars, local stone, locally-made brick, pipework and tiles and leaded glass, the last now mostly gone, reflect this. It was one of the first places in the world to have steam trams.
Andrew Carnegie financed a public library here; the town also had an art and technology college and a grammar school.

In 1931, Darwen was visited by Mahatma Gandhi, he had accepted the invitation from Corder Catchpool, Quaker manager of the Spring Vale Garden Village Ltd, to see the effects of India&#x27;s boycott of cotton goods.

India Mill is now home to many companies, including Brookhouse (producers of aeroplane parts) and Capita Group, which runs TV licensing. Since the 1950s, the textile industry has strongly declined in the region, although many industrial buildings from the period survive, now used for other purposes. India Mill and its chimney have been sold in a £12 million deal.

Among Darwen&#x27;s other notable industries are Crown Paints, formerly Walpamur Paints, the earliest British paint manufacturer, which named one of its paints &#x27;Darwen Satin Finish&#x27;. Crown Wallpaper manufactured wallpaper, Lincrusta and Anaglypta in the town. ICI Acrylics (now called Lucite International) was where acrylic glass (Perspex for windows and signage, and Sani-ware or Lucite used for the manufacture of baths and shower trays) was invented; it is still manufactured in two separate plants within the town. Spitfire canopies and (later) coloured polythene washing-up bowls were first made here. A Heritage Centre opened in 2016

==Governance==
The municipal borough of Darwen existed for ninety-six years, from 1878. The borough was merged with Blackburn in 1974 under the Local Government Act 1972. The town became part of the Lancashire non-metropolitan district of Blackburn, which was renamed Blackburn with Darwen in 1997, shortly before it became a unitary authority.

The population of the town declined from 40,000 in the 1911 census to 30,000 in the 1971 census.

Locally, Darwen has been represented by Labour, Conservative and Liberal Democrat councillors in the main council wards for the town. In the 2008 local elections, the For Darwen Party picked up the majority of the wards in the town to put pressure on Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council for Darwen to have its own council again. In April 2009 Darwen Town Council was formed.

There are five council wards within Darwen out of the 23 in the Borough of Blackburn with Darwen. These are:
* Earcroft
* Marsh House
* Sudell
* Sunnyhurst
* Whitehall

Darwen had its own parliamentary constituency until 1983 when it became part of the present Rossendale and Darwen constituency. This seat is currently held by Member of Parliament Andy MacNae.

===Coat of arms===
The coat of arms for Darwen should not be confused with the coat of arms used by the unitary authority of Blackburn with Darwen, which is the coat of arms for Blackburn.

Darwen was granted its coat of arms on 7 August 1878. At the foot of the coat of arms is the town motto in Latin &quot;Absque Labore Nihil&quot;, which translates as &quot;Nothing without labour&quot;. The arms depicts three cotton bolls and the River Darwen which runs through the town. The cotton represents the cotton industry in which the town grew and prospered during the Industrial Revolution and the three bolls to represent the three main areas of Darwen – Over Darwen, Lower Darwen and Hoddlesden. At the helm of the coat of arms is a barred helmet representing nobility, and above it the torse in the town colours of blue and gold. At the crest a man stands shouldering a pickaxe, which refers to the town&#x27;s motto and also represents the mining industry that was present to the east of the town at that time.

==Education==

After the passing of the Education Act 1870, many schools were established to serve the ever-growing population. Many were later demolished.

Darwen Aldridge Community Academy opened in September 2008 at the premises of the former Darwen Moorland High School on the outskirts of the town, which had closed in July 2008 to reopen as the academy after the summer holidays. All pupils from Darwen Moorland transferred to the academy. Pupils have subsequently moved down to the new site, into a state-of-the-art £49m academy, with sixth form and modern facilities.

Darwen Vale High School was temporarily moved to the old Moorland site whilst a new build was completed on the original site. The original school façade was incorporated into the new build, and Darwen Vale transferred back to the original site in 2012. However, the move had caused major issues with the management at the school, which led to the head leaving and a new head taking over in 2013. Later in 2013, Ofsted ruled that the school was failing and the government ordered the school&#x27;s conversion to academy status, sponsored by the Aldridge Foundation, despite teaching staff and parents protesting governmental imposition on the school&#x27;s management.

In September 2013 Darwen Aldridge Enterprise Studio opened and in 2014 the school moved to its permanent home in the renovated former Model Lodging House on Police Street.

In January 2022 Crosshill School completed a £2million move from Blackburn Central High School to the vacant Sunnyhurst Centre on Salisbury Road, with the move adding extra places at the school, Crosshill is part of the Champion Education Trust.

==Geography==

===Location===
Darwen is located amid the West Pennine Moors south of Blackburn, it stands within a valley with the River Darwen flowing at its base. The river passes through the town from south to north, subsequently joining the River Ribble, which flows into the Irish Sea between Lytham St Annes and Southport. The A666 road follows the valley through the town centre as part of its route from the Ribble Valley, north of Blackburn, to Bolton and the boundary between Pendlebury and Irlams o&#x27; th&#x27; Height in Salford. The town&#x27;s weather conditions made it perfect for cotton weaving and as a result it became one of the largest mill towns in Lancashire.

The Guinness Book of Records records that Darwen had one of the largest flash floods in the United Kingdom, in 1848; 12 people died. See &#x27;History&#x27; above.

==Landmarks==
===Darwen Jubilee Tower===
In 1897 the town council met to deliberate how best to celebrate Queen Victoria&#x27;s Diamond Jubilee. The idea of building the Jubilee Tower, in conjunction with public access to the moors, was put forward. A competition to design the tower was won by Ralph Ellison from the borough engineer&#x27;s department and on 22 June 1897 work began. On 24 September 1898 the opening ceremony was held, attended by over 3,000 people. Present at the ceremony were Councillor Alexander Carus, Mayor Charles Huntington, the High Sheriff of Lancashire and Lord of the Manor Rev. W.A. Duckworth.

The tower, which is open to the public, overlooks the town from the moors and stands at an altitude of 1,227 ft (374m) and has a height of 85 ft (26m). A spiral staircase leads to the top from where, on a clear day, Blackpool Tower, the Isle of Man, North Wales and the Furness Peninsula can be seen. In November 2010 the dome of the tower was blown off by strong winds. The dome was restored in January 2012.

===Darwen Library===

Originally situated in the Peel Street, the library was transferred to the new technical school building in 1895.

Today, Darwen Library stands at the corner of Knott Street and School Street to the north of the Circus. It was commissioned by Andrew Carnegie, a Scottish migrant to the USA who made his fortune as a producer of iron and steel. He donated £8,000 in response to a speculative appeal for funds by the Library Committee. The opening took place on 27 May 1908 and was attended by Mayor Councillor G.P. Holde, Councillor Ralph Yates and Carnegie himself. The library has served the town ever since, with the original lecture hall being transformed into the Library Theatre in June 1971. On 27 April 2017 the library and theatre were designated as a Grade II listed building.

===Darwen Town Hall===

Darwen Town Hall was opened on 11 July 1882 and the clock tower was added in 1899 when Dr. James Ballantyne became mayor. In the 1920s part of the market ground was made into the town&#x27;s bus station which still remains today. Although local government proceedings were transferred to Blackburn in the 1970s, the council chambers remained in the building, and were used by the magistrates&#x27; court from 1983 until 1992. The town hall currently houses offices of Blackburn with Darwen Borough Council and the local Neighbourhood Policing Team, and is a venue for meetings of the Darwen Town Council established in 2009. Five shop units opened in 2011.

===Parks===
Darwen has four parks. Three of the parks in Darwen are on the west of the main road through the town, with paths leading to countryside and to Jubilee Tower. The fourth, and newest park, is Ashton Park, which is on the east side of Bolton Road, just behind the Spinners Arms public house.

====Bold Venture Park====

Bold Venture Park stands to the west of the town, at the foot of the moors and the path which leads to the Jubilee Tower. The land in which the park lies was bought by Darwen Corporation from Rev. W.A. Duckworth. It was designed by R. W. Smith-Saville, the borough engineer, and opened in 1889.
====Sunnyhurst Wood====
Sunnyhurst Wood was originally owned by the Brock-Hollinshead family and used for hunting stag. The area was later sold to Eccles Shorrock. To commemorate the coronation of Edward VII the land was turned into a public park on 2 July 1903.

====Whitehall Park====
Whitehall Park is a park in the south of the town. It was opened in 1879 on land acquired from John Adamson.

==Transport==
Darwen sits in a large valley strung along the A666 road along the valley floor. It is connected to the motorway system at Junction 4 of the M65 at Earcroft, on the town&#x27;s northern boundary, and considerable traffic passes through the town centre along the A666, causing high levels of air pollution. The local council has recently attempted to address the situation by adding a new road layout to the town centre, with public transport and junction improvements to reduce traffic.

Darwen stands along the Ribble Valley railway line, operated by Northern. Darwen railway station has up to two trains per hour between Blackburn and Rochdale (via Bolton and Manchester); one train per hour continues beyond Blackburn to Clitheroe.

Darwen&#x27;s bus terminal (Darwen Circus) hosts buses up to every 12 minutes to Blackburn/Accrington on weekdays. There is also a service, every 20 minutes on weekdays and hourly on Sundays, to Bolton and Clitheroe, but the Bolton service terminates at 7:00pm. Both services are operated by Blackburn Bus Company.

In 2008 the &quot;Pennine Reach&quot; scheme, to improve public transport between Darwen, Blackburn and Hyndburn, was proposed by Lancashire and Blackburn with Darwen councils, including plans for the addition of bus lanes to the A666. However, it has been controversial, with some residents placing &quot;Say no to Bus Lane, we don&#x27;t want it&quot; signs in their windows, and the neighbouring district of Hyndburn pulled out of the scheme. The scheme was put on hold in 2010 as local authorities reviewed their spending after their budgets were cut, before being abandoned later in the year due to lack of government funding, and the councils are now looking at other ways to improve public transport.
In 2004 Crown Wallcoverings, previously one of the biggest businesses in the town, closed with the loss of more than 200 jobs. The Crown building was a large redbrick ten-storey building with numerous chimneys. In 2006 the empty building and the 200 foot (60 m) chimney was demolished.

==Culture and community==
The Darwen News published a Maudley Medley on 9 March 1878:
&#x27;Tween two hillsides, both bleak and barren,
Lies lovely little &quot;Dirty Darren&quot;
The locals refer to themselves as &quot;Darreners&quot;. They are generally resistant to any attempts at submerging the identity of the town within Blackburn. A motorway service area at junction 4 of the M65 motorway lies within the town, and was originally named &quot;Blackburn Services&quot;. Following local protests it was renamed &quot;Blackburn with Darwen Services&quot;.

The town is the home of the Darwen Library Theatre (an extension to the library), and the TV show &quot;Hetty Wainthropp Investigates&quot;.
Darwen has a few footnotes in entertainment history: its theatre (now demolished) had appearances by Charlie Chaplin, and it featured in the film, &quot;There Was a Crooked Man&quot;, which starred Norman Wisdom and Alfred Marks.

The Beatles played in Darwen on Friday 25 January 1963, at the Co-operative Hall. They headlined &quot;The Greatest Teenage Dance&quot; which was commissioned by the Darwen Baptist Youth Club. Support acts included the Electones, the Mike Taylor Combo and the Mustangs with Ricky Day.

===Religion===
The Parish Church of Darwen is St Peter&#x27;s, a large and active Anglican church consecrated in 1829. Further Anglican Churches in Darwen include St Cuthbert&#x27;s (consecrated in 1878) serving the north of the town, and St Barnabas&#x27; (built 1884) serving the south.

Darwen Methodist Church meets on two sites in the town, at Bright Street and Spring Vale.

The Medina Mosque and Islamic Centre, Darwen&#x27;s first mosque, is located on Victoria Street.

Faizaan e Jamal e Mustafa, Darwen&#x27;s second mosque, is located on Railway Road. It was opened in 2018.

===Music===
Darwen has its own music school, Darwen School of Music (formerly Elite School of Music), situated on Blackburn Road. The school has a majority focus on popular music.

Darwen Live (formerly Darwen Music Live) is a free two-day music festival held each year over the second bank holiday in May. The main stage is built outside the town hall, and other smaller music stages are usually based around the town in pubs and bars. The festival has attracted artists such as Buzzcocks, China Crisis, Toyah and Paul Young, as well as being a showcase for local bands.

Darwen has one of the oldest brass bands in the country. Now named Blackburn and Darwen Band, its roots can be traced back to 1840. Another brass band, Darwen Brass, was formed in 2007 and under MD Steve Hartley has enjoyed many notable competition successes, including 4th section wins throughout the North West. In 2012 Darwen Brass qualified for the National Brass Band Championships, finishing 5th. The band was promoted to the 3rd section from the start of 2013.

===Media===
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC North West and ITV Granada. Television signals are received from the Winter Hill and the local relay transmitters.

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Lancashire, Heart North West, Smooth North West, Capital Manchester and Lancashire, Greatest Hits Radio Lancashire, and Central Radio North West, a community based station.

The Lancashire Telegraph is the local newspaper that covers the town.

===Sport===
The town was the home of Darwen Football Club, formed in 1870 and the world&#x27;s first football club to have paid professional players. The team reached the semi-final of the FA Cup in 1880-81 and played in the Football League at the Barley Bank ground between 1891 and 1899. The club was wound up at the end of the 2008–09 season and replaced almost immediately by A.F.C. Darwen. The new club plays in the First Division North of the North West Counties Football League and is based at the Anchor Ground.

The town has a strong cricketing tradition and Darwen Cricket Club was originally founded in the late 1800s as Darwen Etrurians CC playing at Barley Bank. The current club was constituted in 1911 and since 1920 has been based at Birch Hall Cricket Ground. The club was a founder member of the Northern League in 1951 winning that competition five times before successfully applying to play in the Lancashire League from the 2017 season. This change heralded a golden era for the club and within 5 seasons, it had won every club competition in the county. Twice holders of the Worsley Cup (2017 and 2019), T20 champions in 2021 and LCF Knockout Cup winners in 2018 with the set completed when crowned 2022 Lancashire League champions after defeating Greenmount by 13 runs on 4 September 2022. Past Professionals include David Wiese, George Linde (SA) Keith Semple (WI) and Scott Hookey (AUS). Following a successful debut season, Punit Bisht (IND) has been retained as the club&#x27;s paid man for 2024 and 2025.

To the north-west of the town lies Darwen Golf Club. The characteristics of the course have changed little since the club was established in 1893. Due to its geographical location within the moors, the course is regarded as a tough test of golfing ability.

Until the sports centre was demolished, Darwen was home to the North West Open Karate tournament, which hosted many national and world champions. Tower Shukokai Karate Club was resident at the sports centre from 1988 and remains active. Tower&#x27;s instructors, Andy Allwood, 5th Dan and Martyn Skipper 4th Dan, both won this tournament in their respective weight categories (Allwood, heavyweight, in the 1990s and Skipper, lightweight, in 2006 after the tournament had moved to Bury). In 2013 Martyn Skipper won the WUKF European Veterans&#x27; title when the European Championships were held in Sheffield.

<text>Lymington is a port town on the west bank of the Lymington River on the Solent, in the New Forest district of Hampshire, England. 

The town faces Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, to which there is a car ferry service operated by Wightlink. It is within the civil parish of [[Lymington and Pennington]]. The town has a large tourist industry, based on proximity to the New Forest and its harbour. It is a major yachting centre with three marinas. As of 2015, the parish of Lymington and Pennington had a population of 15,726.

==History==

The earliest settlement in the Lymington area was around the Iron Age hill fort known today as Buckland Rings. The hill and ditches of the fort survive, and archaeological excavation of part of the walls was carried out in 1935. The fort has been dated to around the 6th century BC. There is another supposed Iron Age site at nearby Ampress Hole. However, evidence of later settlement there (as opposed to occupation) is sparse before Domesday (1086).

Lymington itself began as an Anglo-Saxon village. The Jutes arrived in the area from the Isle of Wight in the 6th century and founded a settlement called &quot;Limentun&quot;. The Old English word &quot;tun&quot; means a farm or hamlet whilst &quot;limen&quot; is derived from the Ancient British word &quot;*lemanos&quot; meaning an elm tree.

The town is recorded in Domesday as &quot;Lentune&quot;. About 1200, the lord of the manor, William de Redvers created the borough of New Lymington around the present quay and High Street, while Old Lymington comprised the rest of the parish. He gave the town its first charter and the right to hold a market. The town became a parliamentary borough in 1585, returning two MPs until 1832, when its electoral base was expanded. Its representation was reduced to one member under the Second Reform Act of 1867, and it was subsumed into the New Forest Division under the Redistribution of Seats Act 1885.

Lymington was famous for salt-making from the Middle Ages up to the 19th century. There was an almost continuous belt of salt workings along the coast toward Hurst Spit.

In the 18th and early 19th centuries, Lymington possessed a military depot that included a number of foreign troops – mostly artillery but also several militia regiments. At the time of the Napoleonic Wars, the King&#x27;s German Artillery was based near Portchester Castle and sent sick soldiers to Lymington or Eling Hospital. As well as Germans and Dutch, there were French émigrés and French regiments. They were raised to take part in the ill-fated Quiberon Invasion of France, from which few returned (contrast the Battle of Quiberon Bay, or &quot;Bataille des Cardinaux&quot;, a 1759 victory).

From the early 19th century, Lymington had a thriving shipbuilding industry, particularly associated with Thomas Inman, builder of the schooner &quot;Alarm&quot;, which famously raced the American yacht &quot;America&quot; in the 1851 America&#x27;s Cup. Much of the town centre is Victorian and Georgian, with narrow cobbled streets in the area of the quay. In 1859 the Roman Catholic church of Our Lady of Mercy and Saint Joseph was built to a design by Joseph Hansom.

Lymington particularly promotes stories about its smuggling. There are unproven stories of smugglers&#x27; tunnels running from the old inns and under the High Street to the town quay.

Lymington was among the boroughs reformed by the Municipal Corporations Act 1835. In 1932 it was extended to include Milton (previously an urban district), the parishes of Milford on Sea and Pennington, and parts of Lymington Rural District, so extending it along the coast to the edge of Christchurch.

The borough of Lymington was abolished on 1 April 1974 under the terms of the Local Government Act 1972, becoming an unparished area in the district of New Forest, with Charter Trustees. The area was subsequently divided into the four parishes of New Milton, Lymington and Pennington, Milford-on-Sea and Hordle. A new library was added in 2002.

==Lymington today==

Due to changes in planning legislation, many older areas of the town have been redeveloped. Houses have been demolished and replaced with blocks of flats and retirement homes. In a Channel 5 programme, Lymington received the accolade of &quot;best town on the coast&quot; in the UK for living (ahead of Sandbanks), for scenery, transport links and low crime levels.

Lymington New Forest Hospital opened in 2007, replacing the earlier Lymington Hospital. This has a minor injuries unit but no accident and emergency facility. The nearest are at Southampton General Hospital, away, and the Royal Bournemouth Hospital, away.

The main Anglican parish church is St Thomas&#x27;s in the High Street. Lymington Town Hall, in Avenue Road, was opened in 1966.

===Neighbourhoods===
The northern neighbourhoods of the town are Buckland and Lower Buckland, the latter adjoining the Lymington River. However, to avoid confusion with Buckland, Portsmouth, also in Hampshire, many people refer to themselves and their businesses here solely as Lymington. The poet Caroline Anne Bowles (1786–1854) was born at Buckland Manor and died at Buckland Cottage.

Pennington is a village near Lymington, but is separated from the town by several schools with playing fields. Upper Pennington is a northern residential offshoot of Pennington, more rural in character, almost entirely surrounded by heath and farmland.

Lymington yacht basin and mudflats make up the former docks area known as Waterford.

Lower Pennington and Woodside lie adjacent to Woodside Park, a public park bequeathed to the people of Lymington in 1925 by Colonel Henry Douglas Rooke. The park includes formal gardens, a playground, a cricket ground and a sports field. The neighbourhood consists of a small southern triangle of residential and rural lanes, which include a manor house, church community hall, and All Saints&#x27; Church, Lymington. The church was built in 1909 by W. H. Romaine-Walker, architect of Danesfield House, Moreton Hall, Warwickshire, and the Tate Gallery extension, and a student of the High Victorian architect George Edmund Street.

Normandy is a coastal hamlet by a very small dock, salterns and estuary. It includes the buildings Normandy Garth, Little Normandy and Normandy Farm. The last backs onto De La Warr House, an early 19th-century listed building.

==Shopping==
The high street has seen rapid change over the last few years, with an increasing presence of chain stores and coffee-shop franchises. There is a local market, one of the New Forest producers&#x27; markets, held at the Masonic hall once a month in the game season. There are several marine outfitters in the cobbled street leading down to the quay.

Lymington has a wide range of shops and a large street market in the High Street, as well as three supermarkets: Waitrose, a small Tesco in the High Street, and a Marks and Spencer Food Hall. Local campaigns resulted in the rejection of proposals for the opening of branches of the Argos retail outlet, and in 2010 of the J D Wetherspoon pub chain. However, a second proposal by Wetherspoons in 2012 was successful and a pub named The Six Bells opened in 2013.

==Climate==
Lymington, like the rest of the South of England, has a maritime climate of warm summers and mild winters. The nearest official Met office weather station for which online records are available is Everton, about to the west of the town centre. Thanks to its coastal position, sunshine levels are high relative to the rest of Britain, and severe frost unusual. The lowest recorded temperature in 43 years of records was in January 1963. The highest locally recorded temperature was in June 1976.

==Sports and leisure==
The town&#x27;s leisure amenities include several parks, a nine-hole golf course, a rowing club, a community centre, a library, St Barbe Museum and Art Gallery, two swimming pools (one the Lymington Open Air Sea Water Baths built in 1833), a sports centre, a small cinema/theatre, a Skatepark (for skateboards), several tennis courts, and some youth football pitches. There is also a pétanque terrain near St Thomas&#x27;s church. Lymington Cricket Club was established in 1807 and plays in the Southern Premier and Hampshire Cricket leagues.

The proximity of the New Forest makes Lymington a popular base for walking, cycling and riding.

===Sailing===
Lymington is famous for its sailing history, and in recent years has been home to the world-famous regattas such as the Royal Lymington Cup, Etchells Worlds, Macnamara&#x27;s Bowl, and Source Regatta. The strong tides make it a challenging race track, and together with the shallow depth of the river has resulted in Lymington losing several regattas to the Central Solent, principally run from Cowes. Nevertheless, Thursday Evening Racing takes place with up to 100 boats registered to race every Thursday night during the summer, hosted by the Royal Lymington Yacht Club. Started in the 1990s, this has become increasingly popular.

There are two active sailing clubs in the town. The Royal Lymington Yacht Club, founded in the 1920s as Lymington River Sailing Club, has over 3,000 members and runs major keelboat and dinghy events. The Lymington Town Sailing Club, founded in 1946, hosts a popular Lymington Winter Series known as the Solent Circuit.

===Football===
Lymington has a non-League football club, Lymington Town F.C., which plays at the sports ground. The children&#x27;s football club, Lymington Sprites, is based in nearby Pennington.

===Cricket===
Lymington Cricket Club is an amateur cricket club that plays at the Sports Ground. The Third and Fourth XI play their home matches at Woodside Park. The club&#x27;s first team compete in the Southern Premier Cricket League, which is the highest level of club cricket in Hampshire.

===Rugby union===
Lymington has a rugby union club, Lymington Mariners RFC, whose two teams play at Woodside Park. It meets every Thursday evening for practice and most Saturday afternoons for tournament games in the Hampshire region, and friendlies around the South of England.

==Media==
Local news and television programmes are provided by BBC South and ITV Meridian. Television signals are received from the Rowridge TV transmitter. 

Local radio stations are BBC Radio Solent on 96.1 FM, Heart South on 96.7 FM, Capital South on 103.2 FM, Easy Radio South Coast on 107.8 FM, Nation Radio South Coast on 106.0 FM and New Forest Hospital Radio, that broadcast local programming to patients from the New Forest Hospital in the town.

The &quot;Lymington Times and New Milton Advertiser&quot; is the town&#x27;s local newspaper.

==Transport==
===Buses===
Lymington bus depot is owned by Go South Coast. Numerous local services operate, as do routes to Bournemouth and Southampton. In the summer, the New Forest Tour serves the town with open-top buses.

===Rail===
Lymington&#x27;s two railway stations – Lymington Pier (the terminus), on the east side of the river near the ferry terminal, and Lymington Town – are connected to the national rail network by a branch line to Brockenhurst. Services twice an hour are operated by South Western Railway.

===Roads===
The A337 road links Lymington to Lyndhurst and the M27 motorway to the north, and to New Milton and the South East Dorset conurbation to the west.

===Ferries===

Ferries have run between Lymington and Yarmouth, Isle of Wight, since the 19th century. Since 1990 they have been operated by Wightlink, succeeding the nationalised Sealink on the route. The current fleet comprises three car ferries, which entered service in 2009: &quot;Wight Light&quot;, &quot;Wight Sky&quot; and &quot;Wight Sun&quot;. The service runs about once an hour from a dock south-east of the old town on the far side of the Lymington River.

==In fiction and on screen==
Lymington features in &quot;The Children of the New Forest&quot; by Captain Marryat, in the historical novels of the local writer Warwick Collins (&quot;The Rationalist&quot; and &quot;The Marriage of Souls&quot;), and in &quot;The Forest&quot; by Edward Rutherfurd.

In Tom Clancy&#x27;s &quot;Patriot Games&quot;, a Wightlink ferry heading from the Lymington ferry terminal is intercepted and a prisoner extracted in heavy seas. Several men on board the ferry are murdered.

The 1980 Christmas special of the ITV children&#x27;s show &quot;Worzel Gummidge&quot; was filmed in the town during the summer of that year. During filming a sudden wind blew the titanium dioxide that was being used as a replica of snow into homes, shops and businesses, causing damage and a large compensation bill for the producers, Southern Television.

Lymington was occasionally featured in the 1980s BBC series &quot;Howards&#x27; Way&quot;.

==Notable people==
==Twin towns== 
Lymington is twinned with:
*Vitré (France)
* Mosbach (Germany)
* Almansa (Spain)
An active programme of exchange visits is coordinated by the local Twinning Association.

<doc id="368388" wikidata="Q373971" url="?curid=368388" title="Loughton">
<text>Loughton () is a suburban town and civil parish in the Epping Forest District of Essex, within the metropolitan and urban area of London, England, north-east of Charing Cross. The town borders Waltham Abbey, Theydon Bois, Chigwell, Chingford, and Buckhurst Hill. 

The parish of Loughton covers part of Epping Forest. It is the most populous in the Epping Forest district, and second most populous in Essex (after Canvey Island). At the 2021 census, it had a population of 33,353.

Loughton has three conservation areas and there are 56 listed buildings in the town, together with a further fifty that are locally listed.

==History==

The earliest structure in Loughton is Loughton Camp, an Iron Age earth fort in Epping Forest dating from around 500 BC. Hidden by dense undergrowth for centuries, it was rediscovered in 1872.

The first references to the site of modern-day Loughton date from the Anglo-Saxon period when it was known as &quot;Lukintune&quot; (&quot;the farm of Luhha&quot;). The earliest written evidence of this settlement is in the charter of Edward the Confessor in 1062 which granted various estates, including &quot;Tippedene&quot; (Debden) and &quot;Alwartune&quot; (Alderton Hall, in Loughton), to Harold Godwinson (later King Harold II) following his re-founding of Waltham Abbey. Following the Norman conquest, the town is also mentioned in the Domesday Book of 1086, with the name &quot;Lochintuna&quot;.

The settlement remained a small village until the early 17th century when the high road was extended north through the forest. The road quickly became the main route from London to Cambridge and East Anglia, and Loughton grew into an important stop with coaching inns. The most significant of the great houses of this period, built as country retreats for wealthy City merchants and courtiers, was Loughton Hall, owned by Mary Tudor two months before she became Queen Mary of England in 1553, and later by the Wroth family from 1578 to 1738. Sir Robert Wroth ( – 1614) and his wife Lady Mary Wroth (1587 – ) entertained many of the great literary figures of the time, including Ben Jonson, at the house. It was rebuilt in 1878 by Revd. J. W. Maitland, whose family held the manor for much of the 19th century. It is now a Veecare Homes care home and is a grade II listed building.

Loughton&#x27;s growth since Domesday has largely been at the expense of the forest. Expansion towards the River Roding was arrested owing to the often flooding marshy meadows, encroachments into the forest to the north and west of the village were nevertheless possible. Loughton landlords and villagers both exploited the forest waste (open spaces and scrub of the forest), but the trickle of forest destruction threatened to turn into a flood in the 19th century after royalty had lost interest in protecting the woodland as a hunting reserve.

The arrival of the railway spurred on the town&#x27;s development. The railway first came to Loughton in 1856 when the Eastern Counties Railway (later the Great Eastern Railway) opened a branch line via Woodford. In 1948 the line was electrified and transferred to London Transport to become part of the Central line on the London Underground.

Loughton was a fashionable place for artistic and scientific residents in Victorian and Edwardian times, and a number of prominent residents were renowned socialists, nonconformists, and social reformers. In the north-east is a post-war development being one of the London County Council&#x27;s country estates, built with the express purpose of co-locating industrial, retail and residential properties to facilitate supported re-location of London families affected by war damage within the capital.

Located within Debden&#x27;s industrial estate is the former printing works of the Bank of England; in 1993 the printing works were taken over by De La Rue on their winning the contract to print the banknotes. The headquarters of greeting card company Clinton Cards and construction firm Higgins Group are also located within the Debden Industrial Estate. In 2008, electronics firm Amshold announced their intention to move the group&#x27;s headquarters to Loughton from Brentwood. They moved to a site in Langston Road; in 2012, their property company Amsprop converted a headquarters building next to the Town Council offices in Rectory Lane.

In 2002, Loughton featured in the ITV1 programme &quot;Essex Wives&quot;, a documentary series about the lives of some of the nouveau riche who have resided in the Essex satellite towns of London since the 1980s. The series propelled Jodie Marsh, one of its featured characters, to fame. Journalists&#x27; use of the term &quot;golden triangle&quot; to describe the towns of Loughton, Buckhurst Hill and Chigwell for their propensity to attract wealthy footballers, soap-opera actors and TV celebrities as residents derives from this.
The town has been used as a backdrop in other television series, notably &quot;The Only Way is Essex&quot;, and two shops in the High Road are associated with members of its cast.

==Geography==
Loughton is bounded by Epping Forest to the west and the Roding river valley to the east. After the Epping Forest Act of 1878 prohibited any further expansion of the town into the forest, the forest and the river have formed two natural barriers constraining any expansion westwards or eastwards, and consequently most of the growth in the last 100 years has been through infilling and construction of new housing estates to the north and south of the old town centre, plus the purpose-built suburb of Debden to the north-east. The Roding valley is somewhat marshy and the river is prone to flooding, so construction close to the river is very limited and the majority of the land around it has been designated as a nature reserve or left as open space parkland. The M11 motorway that follows the course of the Roding along this section of its length is built on raised banks or flyovers, to avoid potential problems with flooding.

The highest parts of the town are the roads that border the forest&#x27;s edge; from the green outside the Gardeners Arms pub near the junction of York Hill, Pump Hill and Baldwins Hill there are views of London, south-west Essex, Kent and Surrey. From here, on a clear day, there is a panoramic view of London landmarks and the North Downs beyond. There are numerous other fine views from different parts of the town, including one roughly at the junction of Traps Hill, Borders Lane, Alderton Hill and Spareleaze Hill, and another on Spring Grove and Hillcrest Road. In the valley between these two hills flows Loughton Brook, which rises in Epping Forest near Waltham Abbey and flows through the forest and Baldwins and Staples Ponds before traversing the town and emptying into the Roding.

There are several distinctive neighbourhoods in Loughton mostly identifiable by the building types incorporated during their development:

*Old Loughton refers to the original settlement which grew up around Loughton High Road.
*Debden occupies about 650 acres/225 hectares to the north east of Loughton; London County Council built the woodland development between 1947 and 1952 out of county to rehouse people from London whose homes had been destroyed or damaged during the Second World War. The largest open space in Debden is Jessel Green, an open hillside towards its centre, deliberately planned as a central open resource by the LCC.
*Debden Green is a hamlet set around an ancient green in the north-east corner of the parish. Debden House in Debden Green is an adult learning and conference centre run by the London Borough of Newham; the grounds include a campsite.
*Goldings Manor is a modern estate of mostly large detached houses built in the grounds of &#x27;Goldings Manor&#x27;, a large mansion demolished after being hit during the Blitz. It comprises four residential streets; Broadstrood, Campions, Garden Way and Stanmore Way.
*Great Woodcote Park is a modern housing estate at the southern end of Loughton, built on the site of the former North Farm.
*Little Cornwall is a hilly area of north-west Loughton closest to Epping Forest characterised by steep hills, weatherboarded houses, narrow lanes and high holly hedges.
*Roding Estate or South Loughton is the area south-east of the London Underground Central line and was mostly built up between the First World War and Second World War.

== Demographics ==
At the 2021 census, Loughton had a population of 33,353, an increase from 31,106 in 2011.

The 2021 census showed that 73.5% of the town&#x27;s population identified as White British. In 2016, Loughton was assessed by the Policy Exchange as the third best ethnically integrated town in the country.
==Politics==

Loughton Urban District Council, established in 1900 was based at Lopping Hall. The area became part of Chigwell Urban District in 1933 and remained as such until 1974, when Epping Forest District Council was created. Loughton Town Council was established in 1996. The Town Council consists of 22 councillors representing 7 wards, elected for a four-year term. The Town Council started off in temporary accommodation, but in 2000 moved to offices on the newly constructed Buckingham Court in Rectory Lane. In 2017, the council moved to the newly redesignated Loughton Library and Town Hall in the town centre.

At district council level, Loughton is represented by two councillors from each of the 7 wards, elected for a four-year term. At county council level, Loughton is split between three divisions, Buckhurst Hill &amp; Loughton South, Chigwell &amp; Loughton Broadway, and Loughton Central, each returning one councillor elected for a four-year term.

Loughton has been part of the Epping Forest parliamentary constituency since its creation in 1974.

==Public services==
Between 1839 and 31 March 2000, policing and crime prevention was provided by the Metropolitan Police. From 1 April 2000, responsibilities were transferred to the Essex Police following the creation of the Greater London Authority.

Loughton has a fire station operated by the Essex County Fire and Rescue Service.

==Culture and the arts==

===Drama===
Loughton is home to the East 15 Acting School. East 15 grew from the work of Joan Littlewood&#x27;s famed Theatre Workshop. Joan Littlewood&#x27;s Theatre Workshop was based in Stratford, London, whose postal district is E15. The School, which became part of the University of Essex in 2000, includes the Corbett Theatre in its campus. Regular productions are staged at the theatre, which was named after Harry H. Corbett (1925–1982), himself a Theatre Workshop member and benefactor of East 15. The theatre building is actually a converted medieval flint barn from Ditchling, Sussex which was dismantled and rebuilt in Loughton.

The character actor Jack Watling (1923–2001) lived in Alderton Hall, Loughton. His son, Giles (born 1953), also an actor, was born there. Actor and playwright Ken Campbell (1941–2008), nicknamed &#x27;The Elf of Epping Forest&#x27;, lived in Baldwins Hill, Loughton, where a blue plaque to him was erected in 2013. Comedy-drama actor Alan Davies (born 1966) grew up in Loughton, and attended Staples Road school. Actress Jane Carr (born 1950), best known for her role as &quot;Louise Mercer&quot; in the American version of the sitcom &quot;Dear John&quot; from 1988 to 1992, was born in Loughton.

Amateur drama is performed mainly at Lopping Hall. Performances are from Loughton Amateur Dramatic Society, founded in 1924, which until 2006 alternated with those from the now-defunct West Essex Repertory Company, founded in 1945. Lopping Hall opened in 1884 and was paid for by the Corporation of London to compensate villagers for the loss of traditional rights to lop wood in Epping Forest, rights which were bought out when the management of the forest was taken over by the corporation in 1878. Lopping Hall served as Loughton&#x27;s town hall and was the venue for most of the parish&#x27;s social – and especially musical - activities during the early 20th century. There are ambitious plans by the Trustees for the building&#x27;s restoration.

===Music===
Loughton&#x27;s classical music scene dates back to the late 19th century, when there were regular concerts by the Loughton Choral Society in Lopping Hall under the conductorship of Henry Riding. Today, performances are mainly at two venues: Loughton Methodist Church hosts the annual Loughton Youth Music Festival, which showcases talented pupils from local schools and colleges. St. John&#x27;s Church festival choir undertakes extensive overseas tours, and in turn hosts well-known soloists, chamber and operatic groups. The music hall artiste José Collins (1887–1958) lived at 107 High Road. The hymn writer Sarah Flower Adams (1805–1848) lived with her husband William Bridges Adams (1797–1872) at a house called &#x27;Sunnybank&#x27;, demolished in 1888 and replaced by No. 9 Woodbury Hill.

Loughton boasts a few rock and pop music connections; Mark Knopfler of Dire Straits was a lecturer at Loughton College (now Epping Forest College). The &quot;Wake Arms&quot; public house (now demolished), which was about north of the Loughton boundary in Waltham Abbey on a roundabout, was a rock music venue from 1968 to 1973, hosting bands such as Black Sabbath, Deep Purple, Genesis, Pretty Things, Status Quo, Uriah Heep, and Van der Graaf Generator. Ray Dorset, the lead singer of Mungo Jerry, had his first taste of fame when his band &#x27;The Tramps&#x27; won the Loughton Beat Contest in 1964.

Roding Players is an amateur orchestra which rehearses at Roding Valley High School and gives three concerts a year in the Epping Forest area; composer Miles Harwood is Musical Director. Epping Forest Brass Band, founded in 1935, also has regular concerts in the Epping Forest area, and competes in national competitions and exhibitions. Loughton Cinema had a resident ladies&#x27; band during the 1930s.

Loughton also has its own music academy the &#x27;Loughton Music Academy&#x27; founded in 2001. Performances are with full orchestral participation.

Loughton Folk Club was founded on 28 October 2010 and held its first Loughton Folk Day on 9 April 2011. The Club meets weekly at 8pm at Loughton Club, Station Road, Loughton.

===Opera and dance===
In the 1930s, Loughton was home to the Pollards Operas, outdoor operatic performances in the garden of a large house. These were directed by Iris Lemare (1902–1997) and produced by Geoffrey Dunn (1903–1981), a prominent impresario, actor and cinematographer, and included several first British performances of operas. Loughton Operatic Society, founded in 1894, is one of the oldest arts organisations in Essex, and still stages regular musicals and operas at Lopping Hall.

Epping Forest District Council&#x27;s Arts Unit, Epping Forest Arts, stages occasional dance-based performance works in Loughton, with community and schools participation. Harlow Ballet, which stages full-scale amateur ballet productions at Harlow Playhouse, also recruits in the area.

===Visual arts===
The sculptor and painter Sir Jacob Epstein (1880–1959) lived at &#x27;Deerhurst&#x27; between 1933 and 1950, after having rented no. 49 Baldwins Hill; he produced some of works there. Sculptor Elsa Fraenkel lived at Elm Lodge, Church Lane, after World War II. Artist John Strevens (1902–1990) lived at 8 Lower Park Road from 1963 until his death. Walter Spradbury (1889–1969), best known for his iconic interwar London Transport posters, lived nearby in Buckhurst Hill. 

William Lakin Turner lived and painted at Clovelly, York Hill, Loughton, in the 1890s. From 1908 to 1936, William Brown Macdougall, artist, and his wife, the author and translator, Margaret Armour, lived in Loughton. Juggler Mark Robertson (1963–1992) lived at &#x27;The Avenue&#x27; and appeared at the London Palladium and on television.

===Cinema===
Early cinematic shows took place in the Lopping Hall. A purpose-built Loughton Cinema was opened by actress Evelyn Laye on 9 October 1928; designed by local architect Theodore Legg, it could seat 847. This was later reduced to 700. In July 2010 Loughton Town Council organised a screening of &quot;An Education&quot;, the first film screening in Loughton since the closure of the cinema, and its success prompted the formation of the Loughton Film Society in September 2010 to redress the lack of a local cinema.

George Pearson (1875–1973), a director and film-writer in the early years of British cinematography, was headmaster of Staples Road Junior School, Loughton 1908–1913. Charles Ashton (1884 – ), film actor from the silent movie era, lived at 20 Carroll Hill, Loughton, from 1917–34.

Several films have been set in the Loughton area, including the 2001 TV movie &quot;Hot Money&quot;, based on real events at Loughton&#x27;s Bank of England printing works.

===Literature===
Shakespeare&#x27;s &quot;Midsummer Night&#x27;s Dream&quot; was perhaps written for the marriage of Sir Thomas Heneage, Vice-Chamberlain of the Royal Household to the Countess of Southampton, who lived near Loughton at Copped Hall.

Lady Mary Wroth (1586–1652), niece of poet Sir Philip Sidney, lived at Loughton Hall with her husband Sir Robert Wroth, and they turned the mansion into a centre of Jacobean literary life. Ben Jonson was a frequent visitor, and dedicated his play &quot;The Alchemist&quot; to Mary and poetry collection &quot;The Forest&quot; to Sir Robert. Lady Mary was an author in her own right, and her book &quot;Urania&quot; is generally regarded as the first full-length English novel by a woman.

Anthony Trollope (1815–1882) who lived for some time at nearby Waltham Cross, set part of his novel &quot;Phineas Finn&quot; (1869), which parodies corrupt electoral procedures, in a fictitious Loughton. Robert Hunter, lexicographer and encyclopaedist (1823–1897) built a house in Loughton, and there compiled his massive Encyclopaedic dictionary. William Wymark Jacobs (1863–1943) lived at The Outlook, Upper Park Road before moving to Feltham House, Goldings Road. Best known as the author of the short story &quot;The Monkey&#x27;s Paw&quot;. Jacobs also wrote sardonic short stories based in &#x27;Claybury&#x27;, a thinly veiled fictionalisation of Loughton. Rudyard Kipling (1865–1936) stayed as a child at Goldings Hill Farm. 

Arthur Morrison (1863–1945), best known for his grim novels about London&#x27;s East End, lived in Salcombe House, Loughton High Road. Constance E. H. Inskip (1905–1945) an Evening News journalist who also wrote three novels amongst other translation work, lived in the town until her death at the birth of her daughter. Both were buried at nearby High Beach. Hesba Stretton (1832–1911) was a children&#x27;s author who lived in Loughton. Hesba Stretton was the pen name of Sarah Smith; her novels about the street children of Victorian London raised awareness of their plight. Horace Newte lived at Alderton Hall and the Chestnuts: he was a prolific novelist. Another children&#x27;s writer, Winifred Darch (1884–1960), taught at Loughton County High School for Girls 1906–1935 (now Roding Valley High School), as did the hymnodist and poet, Emily Chisholm (1910–1991), who lived in Loughton at 3 Lower Park Rd.

Ruth Rendell, Baroness Rendell of Babergh (1930–2015), who lived in Shelley Grove, Loughton, was educated at Loughton County High School for Girls and subsequently worked as a journalist in Loughton at the West Essex Gazette. Some of her fiction is set in Epping Forest, and &#x27;Little Cornwall&#x27;, the hilly area of north-west Loughton close to Epping Forest, takes its name from her description in the novel &quot;The Face of Trespass&quot;. Much of her 2014 novel &quot;The Girl Next Door&quot; is set in the Loughton of 1944 and 2013. There is a blue plaque on one of her former homes, 45 Millsmead Way.

Poets associated with Loughton include Sarah Flower Adams (1805–1848), and Sarah Catherine Martin (c. 1766–1826), author of the nursery rhyme &quot;Old Mother Hubbard&quot;, who is buried in the churchyard of St. Nicholas Church, Loughton. William Sotheby (1757–1833), poet and classicist, lived at Fairmead, Loughton. Alfred, Lord Tennyson (1809–1892) lived at Beech Hill House, High Beach 1837–1840 where he wrote parts of his magnum opus &quot;In Memoriam&quot;. John Clare (1793–1864) lived at a private asylum at High Beach 1837–1841. The First World War poet Edward Thomas (1878–1917) also lived at High Beach 1915–1917. The poet George Barker (1913–1991) was born at 116 Forest Road, Loughton.

The hut remains there, but in a state of disrepair.

===Museum and archives===

Loughton is home to two national archives:

* The British Postal Museum Store, in Lenthall Road, houses objects ranging from the desk of Rowland Hill (founder of the Penny Post), to mobile post office vehicles and an astounding range of post boxes.

Founded by jazz trumpeter Digby Fairweather in 1988, it includes a collection of British jazz recordings, photographs, posters and memorabilia. The archive holds regular celebrity and live jazz events.

Funding was pledged in 2006 to help establish a Street Museum in Loughton. There is also an Epping Forest District Museum store in the town, but this is not open to the public.

A number of Loughton buildings, including the Masonic Hall, Lopping Hall, Mortuary Chapel and several churches, were opened for Heritage Open Days in September 2007, the first time this had been done.

Its cricket ground, complete with thatched pavilion, and facing the war memorial, is one of the town&#x27;s most important open spaces and originated as a field named Mott&#x27;s Piece. One of the earliest presidents of the Loughton Cricket Club was Julius Rohrweger, a local German extraction who owned Uplands, a large house adjacent to the cricket ground. As he was politically a Liberal, the local Conservative party created and supported for some time a rival team, the Loughton Park Cricket Club, though this no longer exists.&lt;br&gt;The South Loughton Cricket Club was founded in 1938 and plays at the Roding Road Cricket Ground. In 2007, its 1st XI became Ten-17 Herts &amp; Essex League champions, having won the title following three consecutive promotions. The club also runs four other teams playing league-friendly cricket and has a junior section. The club was one of the first in the UK to gain Sport England&#x27;s &#x27;Clubmark&#x27; accreditation.

==Transport==

===Railway===

The town is served by both Loughton tube station and, further north-east, Debden tube station on the Central line of the London Underground. The line provides access to locations in the City, east and west London.

The current Loughton station was opened in 1940, but both the line and stations existed before that. The railway line dates back to 22 August 1856, when the branch from Stratford was opened by the Eastern Counties Railway. Debden station was named &quot;Chigwell Lane&quot; from 1865 until 1949 (although it was &quot;Chigwell Road&quot; for a few months in 1865). The route transferred to the Central line in 1949.

===Buses===
Bus routes serving Loughton are London Buses services, operated primarily by Stagecoach London. Services link the town with Buckhurst Hill, Chingford, Debden, Ilford, Walthamstow and Woodford. Other services include Route 66 operated by Arriva to Waltham Cross and various Central Connect services. 

===Roads===
The M11 motorway, which links Cambridge to London, is accessed on Loughton&#x27;s eastern boundary at junction 5 (south). The junction does not permit entry to northbound carriageway or exit southbound. The M11 was constructed in a number of phases beginning in the 1970s and finally opened in the 1980s.
